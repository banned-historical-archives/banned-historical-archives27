 SUBJECT:         The Soviet Information Technology Dilemma
 VC/NIC and I have discussed on numerous occasions the impact of the
 computer revolution on the Soviet Union, particularly the impact of the
 personal computer.  The attached analysis from Computerworld is an excellent
 treatise and I commend it to your attention.  In sum, it notes that the Soviet
 Union and indeed the Bloc, need computer technology to remain economically
 competitive, but at the same time full adoption of an information society is
 counter to Soviet-style Marxist-Leninism.

 By Rex Malik
 The arrival of inexpensive digital information
 technology poses a fundamental challenge to the
 survival of the Soviet system. The USSR and its
 associated countries cannot survive the large-
 scale introduction of information technology in
 any meaningful way and be recognizably the
 same system that has evolved, in the case of the
 USSR, over 70 years.
 The main reason is this: The infrastructure
 .necessary for the USSR to reap the benefits is
 absent and cannot be created without a massive
 administrative restructuring, which would be
 ideologically and politically more than difficult.
 In a recent broadcast from Moscow, the Soviet
 commentator Boris Belitsky said that the "fifth-
 `generation" computers the Soviet Union is set-
 ting out to create "embody the most valuable
 expertise built up by the computer industries of
 many countries, which was carefully and criti-
 cally reviewed by the computer designers of the
 socialist countries [italics mine)" Once, more,

 inimical to the continuation of the
 industrial society. That is the prob-
 lem. And the Soviet system has the
 Industrial society at its heart.
 We are talking here of Soviet-style
 communism. We are not referring to
 the USSR alone, but to the European
 bloc of the USSR, Bulgaria, Czecho-
 slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania
 and East Germany. In many matters,
 these countries are best understood
 as one bloc; and that is especially
 true with the development of infor.
 mation technology. The linking
 structure is the Council for Mutual
 Economic Assistance, known as Co-
 mecon. Strict Soviet-style commu-
 niam, as described here, centers on
 the USSR (notably Russia) and the
 satellite countries in Eastern Europe.
 To say that the bloc must be
 looked at as a whole is not to imply
 that it is a monolith. To a degree, the
 different countries evince different
 attitudes and behavior to the West
 and to information technology. In
 relative terms, the USSR is taking a
 stricter, mo4oilthodox line, whereas
 some of th?'e allites are being more
 adventurglts and innovative. This is
 not happeging with the encourage-
 ment of Mdscow, only with its grudg.
 ing acquiescence.
 In Bulgaria and Hungary, especial.
 ly, a new generation of management
 is taking risks with a series of eco-
 nomic reforms. In Hungary, planning
 is indicative, not prescriptive. Man.
 agers are increasingly accepting the
 opportunities for decentralization.
 Whereas in Hungary the managers
 tend to act independently, albeit
 with the tacit support of the party,
 in East Germany the management
 and party apparatchiks tend to favor
 collaboration. The result is progress,
 If somewhat slow. In contrast, the
 USSR moves hardly at all.
 Before we go any further, let me
 make my obeisance to the year of
 George Orwell, 1984. It is appropri.
 ate that one does, for computerized
 information technology is seen by
 many in the West as an Orwellian
 technology. They stress the power
 that it can give its operators should

 A Scenario is possil6$X which
 computing in the Soviet bloc is used
 primarily as an instrument of con-
 trol, in the sense of police control.
 But if this is all that it does, the
 system has essentially conceded the
 economic race. And this it cannot do,
 The bloc is a political entity whose
 ideological justification is economic,
 and competitively so. To give up the
 race would be unthinkable.
 It is important to understand that
 the challenge now facing the Soviet
 bloc is not an immediately dramatic
 one; forget Hollywood and High
 Nam. The decline instead will be
 gradual; the processes by which it
 occurs are akin to erosion. And this

 ourselves. Given that we seem to be
 able to steer through the escalation
 of nuclear weapons and still remain
 at peace, one can see a situation
 arising in which the Soviet system is
 relegated to the second division of
 economic power, a supplier of raw
 materials and not much else. What-
 ever one may believe about the
 USSR, that is not a postulate that
 any of its people (let alone their
 leaders) would be willing to accept.
 Yet it remains clear that informa-
 tion technology will bite deepest and
 have its most profound effects in
 "free" societies, which have a tradi-
 tion of a relatively unfettered free-
 dom of inquiry, a freedom from di-
 rection as to where intellectual
 curiosity may take you and the indi-
 vidual freedom to acquire the skills
 that individuals themselves consider
 important. It will flourish best in
 societies in which, as John Milton
 put it more than three centuries ago,
 there is "an open market of ideas."
 Broad range
 Information technology? That
 should be read as covering digital
 electronics and ranges from comput-
 ing in all forms and applications to
 cable and satellite technology; from
 advances in 1/O devices and proce-
 dures, which will make even cheaper
 electronics possible, to developments
 in high-speed, very large-scale inte-
 gration. Also included: advances in
 software, development of abstract
 theories of mathematics to give our-
 selves a better grip on reality and
 research In practical applications of
 cognitive psychology and systems
 development, This last gives us the
 likelihood of a technology with a
 "human face," one that can be seri-
 ously applied to the are of the sick,
 the disturbed and the elderly, as well
 as giving powerful data tool combi-
 nations to expand the performance
 of the rest of us.
 There may be, even in the Organl-
 sation for Economic Cooperation and
 Development (OECD), a mix of atti-
 tudes to the application of the tech-
 nology. But we have enough experi-
 ence (and evidence) of behavior,
 even in its sometimes still surprising
 Primitive state, to have some india-
 tions of the main thrusts. They an'
 be briefly summarized. Those people
 who have or can obtain access to the
 technology want it to do the hard
 the dull, the boring, t)te routine
 work, while extending their own
 control and providing greater per-
 socal interest. Properly applied and
 used. It is an immense amplifier of
 human ea Lability. The people - at
 whatever level - want this without
 any lop of status, income or career
 prospects.
 The way information technology
 Is now developing is Inimical to the
 continuation Of the structure of the
 Soviet bloc (and there is little poesl-
 bllityAf turning back) because the
 technology to not neutral. The cons-
 quences may Seem surprising. We are

 lope very stark choices which, how-
 ever ittirrlggles,'it viie evemually
 have to make. -
 in a market-based environment,
 where investment and other business
 decisions are made from the bottom
 up (in Its broadest sense) and the
 "people" may not initiate but still
 have the power of rejection, one can
 say: that, however imperfect the
 system, it has enough plasticity to
 reshape itself as change occurs. A
 key factor here is the extent to
 which the society generates new
 wealth and provides mechanisms to
 distribute it.
 No such adaptation in possible in a
 top-down economy without the con-
 sent of those at the top. Now there
 are good reasons why this support
 will be difficult to obtain, why it
 would not be forthcoming, unless the
 Soviet bloc were to face the sort of

 be observed, change is slow and
 patchy.
 The choice is fundamental: Reject
 or adapt and cease to be Marxist-
 Leninist, Soviet-style. If the choice is
 the former, face the possible erosion
 of Comecon's economic position;
 though its resources will still contin-
 ue to grow, they will not grow at a
 rate commensurate to that of the
 politically competitive industrialized
 societies. The effect of that, in turn.
 may well be to tip irrevocably the
 balance abroad against communism,
 Soviet-style, as a model for others to
 follow. It will be increasingly seen as
 an interesting experiment, if a costly
 one, but one that has failed: in the
 long scheme of things a very expen-
 sive and irrelevant sidetrack.
 The core notion at the heart of
 communism is that it will in the end
 provide a better life than that ulti-
 mately offered by other systems.
 This notion can still be held to,
 though the system has to find more
 excuses why it has not happened
 yet. But, increasingly, this tenet will
 be seen to be a delusion. And the
 Soviet people might well find out,
 which they have not as yet been
 officially and willingly allowed to,
 that their advances, where compara-
 ble to those made by others, have
 been bought at a much higher price
 than those others have had to pay.
 The best that will be able to be said
 for communism, Soviet-style, will be
 that it is of no more validity and
 importance than the idea that the
 application of almost any skill to the
 solution of a problem is better than
 no skill at all.
 Ironically, the Soviet system's
 large-scale dependence upon techno-
 logical advances in Europe, the U.S.
 and Japan means that there is a
 growing constituency that somehow
 or other has access to foreign materi-
 al. Electronics engineers, software
 specialists, telecommunications pro-
 fessionals, process control engineers.
 chemists of almost all kinds - all
 must have access to this literature if
 they are to keep up (even if it has
 first to be translated, usually by offi-
 cial, centralized agencies).
 Yet internal network and data
 base technology is still in its infancy.
 The routine inquiries made by aca-
 demics and scientists in Europe and
 North America using packet-
 switched communications networks
 are not routine in the Soviet Union.
 Some networks do exist. The State
 Committee for Science and Technol-
 ogy operates Viniti for general tech-
 nical data and Patent for patents.

 ately well, if in a passive mode, and
 with understandably strict condi-
 tions of access (easy to arrange if
 you restrict the number of termi-
 nals). Another network, called Aca-
 demnet, is scheduled to become oper-
 ational within the next year or so.
 But experience teaches us that the
 process of interconnecting research
 institutions and penetrating the re-
 search community is surprisingly
 difficult and has a long learning
 curve.
 Within information technology,
 the digital computer lies at the core
 of the challenge. To consider what
 one can perhaps call, in a shorthand
 phrase, the case of "communism vs.
 the computer," we must briefly con-
 sider some crucial aspects of the so-
 cieties being developed in the OECD
 countries in which computing is en-
 demic and intrinsic, for they could
 no longer run without it.
 There is no agreement in any de-
 tail about the changes that informa-
 tion technology is likely to bring
 about or make possible in society.
 For there are a number of schools of
 thought, and much of the writing is
 overlaid with special pleading not
 just about what might be or could be,
 but about what ought to be. Politics,
 philosophy and national viewpoints
 intrude (why should one expect any-
 thing different?). All that there is
 general agreement on is that infor.
 mation and its electronic handling
 are central to the structures and pro-
 cesses of the evolving societies in the
 West. And only those societies are in
 a position to pose the question: How
 do we get out of here?
 The key words are information
 and electronic handling, and we need
 to disentangle them as much as pos.
 sible. Let us now take our first push
 at considering information. I am not
 putting forward the proposition that
 information displaces the uses of en-
 ergy and other machines, rather that
 it takes its place within the basic
 equation about what is required to
 make a modern society run. This can
 mean a major readjustment about the
 way one thinks about the economy at
 its most basic structural level.
 It means not simply a major read-
 justment in the way we think, but
 also in the way we act. The evolution
 of work in the 20th century has been
 toward less and less human muscle
 power and morednd more knowl-
 edge. That k  w ledge is based on
 transmittable      ation which, in
 turn, is based on data (which will
 have the aatgp meaning and value to
 a task, irres{iective of who is doing
 it, which is another principle of
 great power).
 Where does the Soviet bloc stand
 on these trends? It is not surprising
 - it is part of my thesis - that no
 meaningful figures are accessible.
 However, we can make Intelligent
 guesses, especially about the USSR.
 At the start of the 1980s, the USSR
 had a population about 20% larger
 than that of the US. and a gross
 national product lea than half the
 size. Yet:
 ^ The USSR employs roughly
 twice as many people as, the US. in
 the manufacturing industry.
 ^ In industrial manufacturing,
 more than half its employed labor
 force is engaged in unskilled or semi-
 skilled physical labor, as opposed to
 10% to 20% (a figure that is steadily
 falling) in OECD countries.
 ? There were probably 15 times
 as many information workers pro-
 viding financial, Insurance and
