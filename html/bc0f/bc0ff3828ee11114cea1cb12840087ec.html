 US SHARE IN OPEC MARKET DECLINING
 The US share of Big Seven exports to OPEC member countries fell more than
 one percentage point between first half 1976 and first half 1977 even though the
 United States retains its number one position in this market.
 The decline-which has been measured in constant dollars, that is, net of
 changes in export prices and exchange rates-is a continuation of trends of the
 1970s. In 1970-72 the United States held 30 percent of the Big Seven share of the
 OPEC market compared with 27 percent in first half 1977. Among the Big Seven
 countries, West Germany and Italy have recently scored the biggest gains in exports
 to OPEC states.
 The US share fell in most of the OPEC countries in first half 1977; in the three
 major US markets, results were mixed. The US share increased in Saudi Arabia,
 remained steady in Iran, and fell in Venezuela. In Iran, however, the United States
 was able to hold its own only by sharp increases in agricultural and military exports;
 sales of nonmilitary manufactures fell off.
 Expansion of the OPEC Market
 The OPEC countries, taken together, are the most rapidly growing element of
 the world market of the 1970s. OPEC imports were rising 15 percent a year in
 constant dollars even before the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973/74. The rate of
 import growth jumped to more than 40 percent annually in 1974 and 1975. By late
 1975, the pace fell back to 15 percent as a result of payments problems in a few
 countries and limits on ability to absorb imports in others. In five OPEC states, Iran,
 Iraq, Libya, Algeria, and Indonesia, imports in constant dollars have remained
 essentially unchanged since late 1975. The first three ran into problems of absorp-
 tive capacity, caused by clogged ports and inadequate internal transport. In Algeria
 and Indonesia, the constraints were mainly financial. The other eight OPEC
 countries, led by Nigeria, continued to increase their imports, from 20 percent to 40
 percent a year.

 In 1976, imports of the 13
 OPEC countries reached $65 bil-
 lion, about one-half the $122 bil-
 lion combined imports of the
 more than 100 non-OPEC LDCs.
 Imports of Iran and Saudi Arabia
 each totaled more than $10 bil-
 lion. Only Brazil among the non-
 OPEC LDCs reached this level. At
 the other extreme were Ecuador,
 Gabon, and Qatar with imports of
 $1 billion or less. Imports by the
 remaining eight OPEC countries
 ranged between $3 billion and $6
 billion, making them sizable mar-
 kets by LDC standards. Iran and
 Saudi Arabia rank as two of the
 three major markets for each of
 the Big Seven countries, except
 France.
 Trends in Market Share
 The  seven  leading non-
 Communist developed countries-
 the United States, Japan, West
 Germany, France, the United
 Kingdom, Italy, and Canada-
 provided more than 70 percent of
 OPEC imports in  1976. As a
 group, their share remained ap-
 proximately unchanged between
 the early 1970s and 1976. The
 Communist countries, unable to
 supply the type of goods de-
 manded by the newly rich OPEC
 states, lost ground in this period.
 Among  the  non-OPEC LDCs,
 Brazil and South Korea registered
 the most substantial gains.

 Our examination of competition in
 the OPEC market focuses on the export
 performances of the Big Seven countries,
 for which more recent information is
 available. For comparative purposes, the
 OPEC market was defined as the sum of
 Big Seven exports to these countries.
 The United States, the United King-
 dom, and France lost market shares in the
 OPEC market in both value and volume
 (constant dollar) terms in the period be-
 tween the early 1970s and 1976. The US
 share increased in Saudi Arabia and Al-
 geria, held constant in Iran and Kuwait,
 and dropped off sharply in most other
 OPEC countries. The United Kingdom
 had the worst record among the Big

 Seven, with losses in nearly all markets. France also suffered widespread losses, with
 the largest coming from cuts in its market share in Algeria, its major OPEC outlet.
 In contrast, West Germany, Japan, and Italy have done well in the 1970s.
 Germany had the strongest performance, with gains occurring in nearly every OPEC
 state. Japan's share increased everywhere but in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Italy's
 gains largely reflected a 7-percentage-point increase in its important Libyan market
 and a good showing in the large Saudi Arabian and Nigerian markets.

 market share dropped by 2 percentage points, and the German and Japanese shares
 rose by about 1 percentage point.
 When dollar price changes are eliminated, the decline in the US market share is
 considerably less. In constant dollar terms, US exports grew 10 percent, resulting in
 a market share reduction of 1 percentage point.* West German and Japanese exports
 grew 22 percent and 11 percent, leading to a 1.2-percentage-point-share increase for
 Germany and a 0.7-percentage-point-share decline for Japan. The combined move-
 ments of currency exchange rates and domestic prices caused dollar export prices to
 rise 6 percent for the United States, compared with 11 percent for West Germany
 and 17 percent for Japan.
 Some Aspects of Product Mix
 With respect to product mix, we have been able so far to analyze the available
 trade data only in broad form. The results for the United States are mixed, varying
 from OPEC country to OPEC country and from product category to product
 category. In some instances, a single transaction or small group of transactions can
 radically change the short-term picture. The following discussion should be read
 with these observations in mind.
 *Constant dollar, 4e., volume, data should be used cautiously, as they depend on the accuracy of the price data,
 which are subject to inherent calculation problems. For example, changes in sophistication and quality of capital
 goods exports are rarely, if ever, captured by price indexes. Thus, changes in the volume market share of less
 than 0.5 percent are not likely to be meaningful.

 Only in Iran is the US share of imports of Big Seven manufactures significantly
 different from the US share of all imports from the Big Seven. In looking at the
 composition of Iran's imports in constant dollar terms, first half of 1977 versus first
 half 1976, we find that the United States lost 4.4 percentage points in manufactures,
 while its overall share remained constant. This shift reflects a tripling in the volume
 of US agricultural exports to Iran combined with a 20-percent fall in shipments of
 manufactures.

 ' First half 1977 over first half 1976, exports being measured in constant dollars.
 s Excluding military equipment.
 Military equipment deliveries play an important role in determining market
 shares, especially in Iran and Saudi Arabia. In first half 1977, 10 percent of US
 exports to Saudi Arabia and 21 percent of US exports to Iran were military
 equipment.* The United Kingdom also delivered. large amounts of military equip-
 ment to these two OPEC states. When military equipment is excluded from the
 volume of manufacturers exported, the US share slips even further in Iran, and the
 US gain in Saudi Arabia is diminished.
 The US loss in markets for nonmilitary manufactures in Iran and Venezuela has
 been taken up mainly by Japan and West Germany. In Venezuela, Japan wrested
 away motor vehicles business, West Germany captured electrical machinery sales,
 with both gaining at US expense in the nonelectrical machinery category. The
 Japanese also did well in expanding sales of steel, for which they already held more
 than half the Venezuelan import market. In Iran, roughly a quarter of the US
 market share loss was due to a decline in aircraft sales. The remainder reflects US
 losses in nonelectrical machinery to West Germany and in motor vehicles and
 electrical equipment to Japan.

 CANADIAN UNEMPLOYMENT: BLEAK OUTLOOK
 Rapid labor force growth and dragging economic recovery practically guarantee
 that Canadian unemployment will remain above the 7-percent level at least through
 the end of the decade. While most other developed countries have trimmed un-
 employment over the last two years, Canada's jobless rate now stands at a post
 World War II high of 8.3 percent, the highest rate in any major developed country.
 Even though unemployment will be a major issue in the national election, which
 may come next year, the Trudeau government has not made a commitment to
 bringing the jobless rate down.
 Dimensions of the Problem
 Unemployment has mushroomed since the Trudeau government took office
 nine years ago. The jobless rate, which grew from an average of only 4.2 percent in
 1965-69 to roughly 6 percent in the early 1970s, will top 8 percent at yearend 1977.
 In September, 8.3 percent of the labor force-886,000 persons-was unemployed.
 The jobless rate varies sharply by region. Hardest hit are the lightly populated
 and industrially undeveloped Atlantic provinces, where September unemployment
 rates ranged from 9.3 percent on Prince Edward Island to 15.8 percent in New-
 foundland. Quebec posted a 10.8-percent jobless rate in September, adding fuel to
 the separatist government's complaint that Ottawa has done little to correct regional
 disparities. Unemployment rates in the prairie provinces-Alberta, Saskatchewan,
 and Manitoba-were below the national average in September; even here, rates are up
 sharply from a year ago.
 Canada's current unemployment problem stems from a combination of secular
 and cyclical factors. The growth of the labor force has averaged nearly 3.5 percent
 per year since the mid-1960s, the fastest growth of any major developed country.
 The high rate is a result of the entry of workers born in the baby boom of the
 mid-l950s, increased participation rates, and the entry of 600,000 immigrants into
 the labor force.
 Record numbers of young workers born in the mid-1950s are entering the job
 market, creating a temporary bulge in the natural growth of the labor force. The
 share of 14- to 24-year-old workers has increased from one-fifth of the labor force in
 1965 to nearly one-half at the present time. Higher participation in the job market
 by the working age population, particularly by women, is another factor behind the
 rapid rise. In the 1970s, increased participation has added more than one-half
 million workers to the labor force, accounting for roughly one-quarter of labor force

 The downturn in Canadian economic growth beginning in 1974 has exacer-

 years, employment has increased by only 1.8 percent per year, with new entrants

 The slowdown reflects in part the effects of Ottawa's economic policies, which
 are geared mainly to fighting inflation. In addition, the reduced pace of growth
 stems from some deep-seated structural problems including a sharp loss in interna-
 tional competitiveness, which has stifled growth in the manufacturing sector. This
 loss of competitiveness has kept Canada from reaping the benefits of the US
 recovery. Ottawa's oil pricing policies are also to blame for the recent slowdown. As
 a net oil exporter, Canada was able to avoid most of the impact of higher energy
 prices in 1974-75 by holding down domestic energy costs. By raising prices now,
 Canada is experiencing the cost and growth adjustments that most countries felt two
 to three years ago.
 Ottawa's Reaction
 The Trudeau government continues to focus its efforts on combating inflation,
 while looking to the business upturn in the United States to stimulate the Canadian
 economy and reduce unemployment. Ottawa has relied on a variety of compensa-
 tion programs to take the edge off unemployment rather than directly attacking its
 roots; evidence suggests that these compensation programs may themselves add 1.0
 to 1.5 percentage points to the unemployment rate by changing the relative
 attractiveness of work versus idleness.
 Pressure is increasing from opposition parties and business leaders for stronger
 measures to boost employment. Some businessmen propose a tax credit for firms
 that increase employment. Proponents claim the plan could create up to 100,000
 jobs annually at a cost of only $2,500 per job. New Democratic Party leader
 Broadbent has recommended a plan that could result in as many as 300,000
 additional jobs involving a $1.5 billion tax cut, $900 million in public works
 spending, and $50 million in aid to small business. Some politicians are focusing on

 cutting immigration as a remedy. Because the number of immigrants entering the
 labor force in recent years has exceeded the increase in unemployed, this group
 makes a tempting target even though Ottawa has long viewed immigration as a
 needed source of semiskilled labor.
 The Outlook
 Canada is not likely to bring the unemployment rate below 7 percent before
 the end of the decade. Although labor force growth has slowed recently and is
 expected to average slightly less than 2.5 percent per year over the next three years,
 sluggish economic growth almost certainly will prevent a rapid reduction in the
 ranks of the unemployed. Even if GNP grows at a 4.5- to 5-percent rate through
 1980, the increase will do little more than absorb new entrants into the labor force.

 'Based on an assumed 5-percent annual growth in GNP.
 Assuming a 5-percent rate of GNP growth in 1978-80, for example, we estimate that
 employment would remain above 7 percent through 1980.
 Employment stemming from construction of the Alcan pipeline will not
 influence the job market much before 1980. Even then, many of the workers will
 come from outside the country because of the skills required. Furthermore, pipeline
 work will be done in the west, where unemployment is relatively low.
 Continued high unemployment will put strong pressure on the government to
 take remedial action. At present, Ottawa appears to be leaning toward expanding
 existing jobs programs. The government would find it expensive to make substantial
 cuts in the unemployment rate via these programs. Ottawa estimates that it must
 spend an extra $200 million per year for each one-quarter point redu tion in the
 overall unemployment rate.

 IRAN: SHAH SLOWS FRENZIED ECONOMIC PACE
 With a broad reshuffle of the Cabinet last August and a fusillade of public
 pronouncements, the Shah has openly abandoned his all-out development policy.
 The government is calling for restrained rates of growth in support of a new
 theme-growth that the economy can digest.
 Going for Broke
 When oil revenues jumped from $4 billion in 1973 to $21 billion in 1974, the
 Iranian Government quickly jacked up growth and spending targets of the 1973-78
 plan. The revised plan called for total investments of $123 billion over five years,
 including $70 billion in development projects. The main priority was placed on
 heavy industry-steel, copper, aluminum, petrochemicals-and related infrastructure.
 The Shah's theme was to industrialize before oil revenues level off, expected to
 happen in the mid-1980s.
 The boom in government spending quickly overheated the economy. Imports
 doubled between 1974 and 1975, causing port turnaround times to increase to
 between 120 and 200 days and severely overtaxing storage facilities and the inland
 distribution network. These constraints-compounded by shortages of skilled labor-
 disrupted project timetables and escalated the cost of labor, materials, and housing.
 The Shah responded by postponing certain projects and stretching out others by two
 to three years. Even so, budget allocations continued to increase sharply, reaching
 $37 billion for the Iranian year ending in March 1976.
 The effects of the spending spree gave a strong boost to growth in 1976, when
 real GNP rose 14 percent. At the same time, rising wages and housing costs helped
 fuel the 17-percent inflation rate. Port bottlenecks also contributed to the price
 spiral by preventing the growth in imports needed to satisfy demand. Rather than
 restraining demand, the government concentrated its efforts on rolling back prices
 on hundreds of items and pressed the antiprofiteering campaign begun in mid 1975.
 These steps had more impact on discouraging private investment than on inflation;
 an estimated $2 billion in private capital fled the country in the 16 months after the
 measures were adopted.
 Slowdown in 1977
 Imbalances generated by the development drive have contributed to a sharp
 slowdown in economic growth. Real growth in non-oil industries this year is
 expected to average 10 percent--less than half the 1976 increase-while the rise in
 GNP will slip to 6 percent or less. This lower rate largely reflects the mild slump in

 oil  production through
 mid-1977; the OPEC price
 split had helped to reduce
 demand for Iranian crude.
 For the year as a whole,
 we expect oil output-ac-
 counting for 36 percent of
 GNP-to remain at about
 last year's level of 5.9 mil-
 lion b/d.
 A variety of factors is
 holding down the non-oil
 sector. Manufacturing out-
 put has been curtailed by
 frequent electric power
 blackouts, which affected
 more than  1,000 plants
 last summer. Even though
 port congestion has been
 largely  alleviated-the
 turnaround time is now 25
 days or less at most ports-
 the  inadequate                        inland
 transport system remains a
 barrier to the expeditious
 movement of goods. Fin-
 ally, the domestic pool of
 skilled labor has been de-
 pleted; at least 100,000
 foreign workers have been
 brought in during the past
 three years, but needs have
 increased much faster.

 These problems have
 maintained the pressure on
 domestic prices; this year the rise in the cost of living may even exceed the
 17-percent increase of 1976. Government efforts to contain consumer price inflation
 through price rollbacks and controls on profits have continued to undermine
 business confidence and to cut sharply into private investment. Indeed, the cumula-
 tive outflow of private capital since mid-1975 may have reached $6 billion. Capital

 flows at this rate would eat up a large part of the 1977 current account surplus,
 which we estimate at $5 billion to $6 billion.
 The buildup of these problems has moved the
 Shah to reexamine his spending priorities. The re-
 assessment, apparently begun in early 1977, has al-
 ready affected the budget for the year ending in
 March 1978. The $50 billion budget represented only
 a 12-percent increase in nominal spending compared
 with allocations for the year ending in March 1977.
 Most of the budget rise is slated for infrastructure and
 projects already under way. No new projects were
 included in the budget for this year.

 2 At the end of August.
 Iran's new Prime Minister, Jamshid Amuzegar, has trumpeted the shift in
 policy, stressing that slower growth is necessary to eliminate past mistakes. By the
 conclusion of the five-year plan in March 1978, Iran will have spent practically all of
 the funds allocated, while meeting only three-fourths of the physical targets. Current
 operating expenditures will have exceeded the planned level by about 25 percent;
 development spending will be some 15 percent short of the target. Defense spending
 reached $10.4 billion last year, driving the five-year total $2 billion above the
 planned level.
 Progress on road and rail construction is lagging well behind schedule, while
 completion dates for copper, aluminum, and steel plants have been pushed back at
 least several years. Plans to construct 10 million to 11 million tons of steelmaking
 capacity by the early 1980s have no chance of meeting target dates. The plan to
 create a copper industry has been poorly managed; the mining operation is well
 along, but construction on the associated rail facilities and the refinery has not even
 begun.
 The Longer View
 The Shah announced last week that the traditional five-year format for eco-
 nomic development plans has been abandoned and that yearly plans will be prepared
 instead. It is not yet clear whether a formal document setting out long-term
 economic objectives will be published, but any future plans must heed the Shah's
 call for spending that can be absorbed. An annual growth target of less than 10
 percent, perhaps 7 to 8 percent, is likely. This presumably will entail the scaling
 down or elimination of many projects now on the books but not yet under way. At

 the same time, spending for education will receive high priority. Nonetheless, the
 number of primary and secondary school graduates entering the work force will not
 have a substantial impact on skilled labor shortages until at least the late 1980s.
 The Shah shows no inclination to extend his new gradualism to military
 spending. Moreover, the ambitious, multibillion dollar nuclear power program will
 generally retain its high priority. We doubt, however, that the current plan to build
 20 nuclear powerplants by the 1990s will be achieved.
 For the longer run, the Shah is still determined to establish a broadly based
 industrial sector to protect Iran's position when the oil runs out. Development
 projects now in train will provide increasing capacity in steel, copper, petrochemi-
 cals, machinery, and the like. The flow of industrial products will first supply
 domestic needs and then be used to supplement and ultimately to replace oil
 exports. Iran, however, almost certainly will face weak world demand for its
 industrial products. Further trimming of its development plans and greater use of its
 petrodollars for investment in North America and Europe make more economic
 Recession finally has hit Sweden, battering confidence in what many once
 regarded as the optimal economic system-a blend of capitalist efficiency and
 socialist compassion.
 Industrial production, profits, and investment are all falling, while inflation,
 unemployment, and foreign debt continue to rise. Recovery will be difficult because
 political commitments to full employment will impede retirement of outmoded
 industrial capacity. Prime Minister Falldin's nonsocialist coalition, whose first year
 in office was marred by a seven-month struggle over wage negotiations, may be
 unable to carry out a promised series of wide-ranging structural reforms.
 Recession Finally Comes
 In 1975 when other developed countries were painfully adjusting to the OPEC
 price hikes, Sweden avoided recession by implementing generous countercyclical
 programs to buttress demand. The government paid full wages to laid-off workers,
 subsidized retraining programs for redundant employees, and hired young people
 just out of school. It also offered incentives for investment in inventories by firms
 that pledged to maintain employment.

 Belatedly, Stockholm has recognized that this effort to ward off recession has
 reduced international competitiveness. With the government guaranteeing employ-
 ment, labor had no reason to moderate its wage demands. Despite stagnant industrial
 production, unions pushed through pay increases of 40 percent in 1975-76. Industry
 accepted narrower profit margins but could not hold the price line against such cost
 pressures. Swedish industrial export prices climbed 16 to 20 percent more than
 average world export prices. As a result, Sweden did not share in the revival of world
 trade. Instead, exporters witnessed a 17-percent decline in their share of OECD trade
 volume. Swedish labor costs are now the highest in the world; hourly compensation
 in manufacturing exceeds compensation in the United States and West Germany by
 20 and 25 percent, respectively.

 Wage increases negotiated this spring are calculated to add 10 to 11 percent to
 industry's wage bill. Firms will find it difficult to absorb the increases since profits
 this year are expected to average only one-fifth the 1974 level. Under the influence
 of the wage settlement, consumer price inflation-currently at 12 percent and
 rising-will remain high.

 Domestic demand has been insufficient to offset the decline in exports.
 Industrial output is languishing below 1973 levels and continues to slide. This year,
 real GDP, which rose 0.6 percent even in the depths of the 1975 worldwide
 recession, will suffer its first postwar decline. With exports down and import
 demand propelled by rising wages, the current account deficit has swelled. Last
 year's shortfall of $2.4 billion was a record, and a $3 billion gap is in prospect for
 1977.
 Direct government intervention in the labor market has kept the unemploy-
 ment rate low by international standards, around 2 percent. Another 4 percent of
 the labor force is in training programs and special public works activities. On top of
 this Stockholm is conducting expensive rescue operations to prevent troubled
 companies from shedding workers. Still, as firms trim work forces through attrition,
 industrial employment is edging down; 40,000 to 50,000 jobs will be lost this year.
 The young, who always suffer when hiring is slow, constitute nearly half of the
 unemployed.

 The Policy Response
 Faced with sagging exports and dwindling foreign exchange reserves, Stock-
 holm announced a stabilization package in late August. The measures represent an
 inadequate attempt to bolster industrial investment and demand:
 ? The krona was devalued 10 percent and removed from the joint Euro-
 pean float. It will now be pegged against a basket of 15 currencies-an
 arrangement designed to unbind. it from the rising West German mark.
 ? A temporary price freeze was imposed to be followed by price surveil-
 lance. This move was intended to minimize the inflationary impact of the
 devaluation.
 ? The employer payroll tax was reduced from 4 percent to 2 percent in
 order to relieve cost pressure.
 On the negative side, the freezing and surveillance of prices will threaten profit
 margins, erode business confidence, and discourage investment. The reduction in
 payroll taxes will only serve to offset increases in employer welfare contributions
 already in the works.
 While the government had intended to postpone its stabilization program till
 mid-fall, a sharp rundown in foreign exchange during July-August forced Stock-
 holm's hand. Still, the devaluation will only partly offset international labor cost
 differentials that have emerged in the last three years. To fully restore profitability,
 a much larger adjustment would be required.
 Tension Ahead
 Relations with labor could be the government's number one problem in the
 months ahead. The bond that existed between labor and the government under
 nearly 45 years of Social Democratic rule was broken with the election of Falldin's
 center-right coalition last fall. The unions already are demanding compensation for
 any increase in the cost of living brought on by the devaluation. Having little
 influence over the unions and facing tough economic decisions, the government will
 have to carefully conserve its small stock of political capital.
 Stockholm promised to follow up the August stabilization package with meas-
 ures to restructure investment, curb public spending, and foster a shift from
 consumption to exports. Such a program would involve substantial transfers of labor
 and probably would entail a jump in frictional unemployment. Yet to keep workers
 in place, Falldin's government has taken over all but one of the major shipyards and
 is negotiating a merger of private and state-owned steel firms. Generous subsidies are
 being lavished on the textile, clothing, and glass industries. If competitiveness is to
 be restored, Stockholm must encourage, rather than impede, diversion of redundant
 resources from these declining sectors to potential growth areas.
 More generally, the Swedes will have to become accustomed, whether they like
 it or not, to the common frustrations of contemporary Western industrial nations.

 Sweden, unscarred by World War II, had been enjoying the benefits of a homogene-
 ous population, a worldwide reputation in engineering products, one of the world's
 highest living standards, and a balance in its international accounts. Now, Sweden
 must face up to the long-term problems of high-cost oil, the inroads of vigorous and
 powerful rivals in international markets for high-technology products, high youth
 unemployment, and rising tensions among a population accustomed to, and softened
 by, the guaranteed good life of a welfare state.
 US SALES OF OIL INDUSTRY EQUIPMENT
 TO CHINA
 Since 1972, the United States has sold Peking nearly $90 million worth of oil
 industry equipment.* Direct sales by US firms have amounted to $70 million. In
 addition, US-licensed or US-manufactured equipment has been sold to the People's
 Republic of China through foreign firms or subsidiaries of US firms. Since 1972,
 Chinese imports of oil industry equipment have totaled $283 million; the other
 suppliers were firms in Canada, France, Italy, West Germany, Denmark, Singapore,
 and Japan.

 ' Of the import totals for 1974 and 1977, 58 and 78 percent consisted of the value of
 offshore platforms. The share of the United Staes for 1974 and 1977 would have been
 33 and 24 percent without the platforms.
 2 The 1975 and 1976 imports were depressed by a general retrenchment undertaken
 by Peking to overcome a $1.2 billion balance-of-payments deficit in 1974. A
 contributing cause was the ideological criticism that the "gang of four" directed
 against all programs to import plants and technology. The pickup during 1977 reflects
 the policy of the new leadership to revive imports supporting industrial development.

 US firms compete for Chinese business at a disadvantage. Because of the
 unresolved political issues between Peking and Washington, the Chinese turn to
 non-US suppliers whenever possible. When US technology is sold to China indirectly
 through deals by non-US firms, the monetary return to US companies is relatively
 small. Moreover, in sales to China of equipment in which technological gain is not an
 issue US firms have been almost completely shut out.

 ' The total is a conservative rackup of imports of oil equipment with technological significance for China.
 The actual total was certainly higher because:
 a. There were too many sellers and sales for our reporting sources to catch all imports. However, after
 comparing our listing with those of trade journals and of the National Council for US-China Trade,
 we are confident that our list is more comprehensive than any other available.
 b. Every effort was made to eliminate double counting arising from reports of the same sale by
 different sources. Where ambiguities could not be fully resolved, the figure represents the minimum
 number of sales possible.
 2 Excludes the following sales for which values are not available and cannot be deduced from available
 information: eight fracturing trucks from the US in March 1977, a 600-ton drill ship from Japan in June
 1975, a vibroseis seismic system from the United States in January 1975, and three Twin Otter aircraft with
 US geophysical equipment from Canada in June 1977.
 5 Including $138 million for platforms.
 The United States has played a dominant role in all sizable oil technology sales
 to China, even those by foreign firms. Of the major non-US sales, the three offshore
 rigs from Singapore and Japan were built to a US design for the Gulf of Mexico and
 are equipped mostly with US machinery; the Norwegian rig reportedly will be
 equipped with US machinery; the offshore support vessels and helicopters were
 equipment types that did not require the latest in technology. In those cases where
 US firms have not been directly involved, the Chinese with rare exceptions have not
 garnered the best in oil technology. The US firms that lead the world in oil
 technology normally sell their latest equipment directly.

 Currently, the main block to expanded sales by US firms to China is Peking's
 shortage of foreign exchange. The oil industry is still given high priority in state
 plans, but agriculture, steel, and petrochemicals, among other sectors, also need
 expensive support from abroad.

 eking's hope back in 1973-74 that exports of crude oil
 would earn abundant foreign exchange to pay for plants and equipment for every
 sector has not been realized. Oil exports to the Free World in 1977 will earn about
 $650 million out of total export earnings of approximately $6 billion. Peking still
 bans both product sharing as a means to pay for foreign oil equipment and direct
 foreign participation in the oil industry.
