 China:                 The Year in Review
 6 June 1985
 Summary
 China's economic and political situation continued to
 improve this past year, although some economic overheating
 problems began to develop early in 1985.  Deng Xiaoping
 continues to dominate the political system, and to push it
 in the direction of further reform, including increased
 trade with the developed countries.  Relations with the
 United States remained stable, and some improvement was
 evident in China's relations with the USSR, although
 fundamental differences still divide the two states.  The
 leadership has rededicated itself to continuing economic and
 political reform, and is pushing controversial policies to
 achieve its goals.  These policies are causing some
 political problems, but as we yet do not believe they
 seriously threaten China's efforts to reform its economy and
 improve its economic relationship with the United States.
 China continues to tilt toward the West for both
 strategic and economic reasons despite its claim to be
 following an "independent foreign policy."  Eager to use the
 United States as a counterweight to the Soviet Union and to
 obtain help for their modernization drive, Chinese leaders
 have moved over the past year to improve relations with
 Washington.  Beijing also has made friendly overtures to the
 new Soviet leader, probing for Soviet flexibility on the
 security issues that have long divided them and seeking some

 manuevering room in the China-US-USSR triangle.  Above all,
 Deng Xiaoping and his-reform-minded allies continue to seek
 greater access to Western technology, credits and markets
 while trying to keep tensions with Moscow manageable so that
 they can concentrate their energies on overcoming China's
 economic backwardness.
 Domestic Politics
 1984 was a year of marked progress for the reform wing of
 the party under Deng Xiaoping.  Beginning with their successful
 damage control efforts in the wake of the "spiritual pollution"
 campaign of late 1983, the reformers developed significant
 political momentum through the spring and summer, and capped
 their drive for dominance in the party at 3rd Plenum of the 12th
 Central Committee endorsement in October.  That party meeting saw
 the formal Central Committee approval of still controversial
 economic reform policies which have dominated the political
 agenda ever since.
 Deng Xiaoping is more than ever the key to leadership
 stability and policy continuity in China.  This was vividly
 demonstrated by China's 1 October National Day celebrations,
 complete with military parade, over which Deng presided in his
 capacity as Chairman of the party and state Military
 Commissions.' Deng has been quite successful in turning over many
 of the routine responsibilities of party and government
 administration to his chosen successors, General Secretary Hu
 Yaobang and Premier Zhao Ziyang, but he remains the most crucial
 actor in the system, adjudicating, arranging, or actually
 deciding the key issues before the leadership.
 Hu and Zhao both made considerable progress in firming up
 their leadership positions during 1984.  Although Hu was somewhat
 under a cloud during the "spiritual pollution" campaign, he
 regained the initative by mid-year, travelling throughout the
 country to gather support for increasing the pace of economic
 reform.   Zhao has been consistently active in developing and
 explaining reformist policies, and has accumulated considerable
 experience in foreign affairs as well.   Zhao has not been as
 active as Hu in developing a group of loyal proteges and placing
 them in key positions within the party.  He has, however, been
 effective in bringing into key government positions well
 educated, experienced technocrats better able to handle the real
 work of their ministries.
 1984 was an important year for party reform in China, and
 significant progress was made in rejuvenating the party's aged
 leadership ranks.  At the center, Hu Qili, 56, emerged as a major
 political figure, planned successor to Hu Yaobang.   In the State

 Council, Vice Premiers Li Peng, 57, and Tian Jiyun, 56, began to
 exercise more authority and were cited as model examples of
 future party leaders.  Deng and Hu Yaobang gave proof of their
 commitment to the continuation of this rejuvenation process on
 numerous occasions in 1984.  The most important was their
 scheduling of a Central Committee "conference of delegates" for
 September 1985, at which major leadership changes in the
 Politburo and Central Committee (perhaps the replacement of up to
 15% of its membership) would be approved.  The retirement
 guidelines established a few years ago became something more akin
 to retirement deadlines for many cadre in 1984.  Hu indicated
 that upwards of one million cadre would be retired in 1985,
 including 70 percent of the party committees of major state
 enterprises, and the majority of State Council ministers and
 provincial leaders over the age of 65.
 Party rectification moved into its-second year and second
 stage in late 1984, but with a change of focus that has led to
 some confusion and a tendency not to take the campaign
 seriously.  As a result, there are conflicting reports of how
 party members have actually been forced to give up their
 registration cards.  Hu Yaobang told Hong Kong journalists in
 early 1985..that 60,000 of the 1 million cadres reassessed in the
 first stage of rectification were dropped from party rolls.
 Aside from the purge aspect of rectification, the campaign served
 as a convenient vehicle to tighten discipline and educate party
 members on other areas of central concern.   In 1984, for example,
 rectification activities centered on "completely negating" the
 Cultural Revolution and eliminating factionalism from local party
 committees.  By late 1984, rectification had been specifically
 linked to generating political support for economic reform
 policies, and by early 1985, the elimination of corruption and
 other economic crime was declared to be the principal goal of
 rectification work.
 Clearly the most important political issue to be addressed
 in China in 1984 was economic reform and decisions made late last
 year will have long term consequences for how China manages its
 economy.  Even though urban and industrial reforms approved at
 the October plenum were not entirely new, and had been discussed
 and tested extensively in some local areas, Central Committee
 approval imparted a legitimacy and acceptability to policies that
 had heretofore been treated with distrust and caution by rural
 and urban cadre.  The Central Committee Decision on the Reform of
 the Economic Structure, which called for reduced government
 control of the economy, generated a remarkable wave of enthusiasm
 and support for reform, and an almost frenetic surge of economic
 activity dedicated to achieving the party's avowed goal of
 "making the people rich."

 The political agenda for 1985, will be dominated by the
 repercussions of those decisions.  The loosening of restrictions
 and controls on China's economy triggered a period of accelerated
 growth, accompanied by wage and price hikes, foreign currency
 speculation, and tax evasion that clearly caught even the most
 enthusiastic reformers by surprise.  The reform wing of the party
 clearly feels vulnerable as a result of these negative
 consequences of reform and their concern and anger is reflected
 in media commentary.   So far, conservative opponents of reform
 have been able to generate enough criticism to slow the pace of
 reform, but they have not been able to roll back the program.
 The reform group in the leadership is determined to press
 forward, but will depend largely on implementation of wage and
 price reforms this summer and on results of the party meeting
 this September.
 The-other major issue in 1985--personnel changes--is the
 focus of the September meeting.  Deng and the reformers are
 pushing hard to retire party conservatives and laggards on
 reform, and to build a coalition in the party that will have a
 stake in maintaining and expanding current policies.  The
 September meeting is intended to be a major step in this
 direction, and it can be expected that those whose careers or
 political influence are threatened by Deng's political
 steamroller will do all they can to preserve their positions or
 limit Deng's gains before the meeting.   In such a high-stakes
 situation, we expect that political tensions in Beijing will rise
 as planning for the meeting proceeds.
 Foreign Policy
 Sino-US relations have improved markedly over the past year
 and a half, symbolized by President Reagan's visit to China last
 spring.  Although differences remain over the long term grain
 agreement, US textile quotas and other bilateral issues, the
 Chinese are no longer using such issues as litmus tests of US
 friendship.  Beijing placed the Taiwan problem--the most chronic
 source of friction--on the back burner in 1984, but it has the
 potential to resurface as a contentious issue at anytime.
 China instead is increasing it efforts to obtain US
 technology and private investment capital.  US-China trade last
 year reached $6 billion--at least a quarter of that consisted of
 Chinese imports of US technology.  US companies, moreover, have
 now invested over $700 million in China--much of it in oil
 exploration--making the United States the second largest foreign
 investor in China after Hong Kong.
 In addition, Beijing is seeking US weapons technology and
 with it an implicit strategic relationship to counter the Soviet

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/08: CIA-RDP04T00447R000201700001-4
 threat China faces.  Despite their occasional denials, the
 Chinese clearly are worried about the continuing Soviet buildup
 of strategic forces (SS-20s, Backfire bombers, and nuclear attack
 submarines) in the Far East, as well as the pace of modernization
 of Soviet conventional forces along their border.  China
 obviously cannot afford to match this buildup; nor does it have
 the technological know-how yet to deal with the growing
 qualitative gap in weaponry.  The Chinese feel particularly
 vulnerable to Soviet armor and airpower.
 Even if China were to obtain the US weapons technology it
 wants, the Chinese recognize that it would take them years to
 produce and absorb such weapons in sufficient numbers to make a
 difference.  That places a premium on political means to handle
 any Soviet attempt at intimidation.  Reducing tensions with
 Moscow is one way.  But by seeking to develop an arms
 relationship with the United states--which the Soviets are likely
 to see as having' strategic overtones--the Chinese almost
 certainly want to signal the Soviets that they are not seeking
 better relations from a position of weakness, and, consequently,
 they are not isolated and susceptible to Soviet pressure.
 The Chinese tried to exploit President Reagan's visit to
 make that point to Moscow last year.  Shortly after the visit,
 for example, China increased military pressure on Vietnam and
 held naval manuevers in the South China Sea in reaction to a
 joint Soviet-Vietnamese amphibious exercise clearly timed to
 demonstrate Soviet support for a Vietnamese offensive against
 Chinese-backed insurgents in Cambodia.  The tough Chinese
 response--which may have seemed to the Soviets to have tacit US
 support--apparently prompted Moscow to postpone a scheduled visit
 of Deputy Premier Arkhipov to China,last May.
 Having strengthened ties with the United States, Beijing has
 recently sought to restore some momentum to stalled Sino-Soviet
 relations.  The Chinese gave Arkhipov a cordial reception when he
 finally arrived in December.  They also signed new trade and
 science and technology cooperation agreements with Moscow.  After
 Chernenko's death in March, Chinese leaders quickly signalled a
 readiness to improve relations further by making several
 important symbolic gestures to the new Soviet leader, including
 referring to the Soviet Union as "socialist" for the first time
 since the mid-60s.   In June both sides plan to sign a long term
 trade accord, which has the goal of increasing bilateral trade to
 $6 billion by 1990.  They have also agreed to raise the level of
 their political dialogue to the foreign minister level, but have
 not yet set a date for a Wu-Gromyko meeting.
 Prospects for greatly improved political relations, however,
 remain remote.  The Chinese continue to insist that Moscow

 I                    I
 accommodate at least one of their key security concerns--the so-
 called "three obstacles"--before political relations can improve
 appreciably.   Indeed, much of Chinese foreign policy remains
 keyed to checking Soviet influence, especially around China's
 periphery.  Although the Chinese media have recently tempered
 their criticism of Soviet policy in Afghanistan and Indochina,
 Beijing continues to back Afghan and Cambodian insurgents.  The
 Chinese also remain adamantly opposed to a compromise with Hanoi
 over Cambodia so long as Vietnam refuses to withdraw its troops.
 Beijing has been equally insistent that Moscow draw down its
 forces in Mongolia as a gesture of friendship.  And Beijing has
 encouraged North Korea to open its doors to more contact with the
 West and to hold talks with South Korea, in part, to limit Soviet
 influence there.
 China's-relations with Western Europe are governed by
 similar strategic and economic factors.  The Chinese support a
 strong NATO as a counterweight to the Soviet Union.   And they
 regard Western Europe as an important supplementary source of
 technology and investment capital.
 China is again closely associating itself with Third World
 causes, but this support is largely rhetorical.   Indeed, China
 tends to conduct its relations with most third world countries on
 a cash and carry basis these days and provides far less aid than
 it once did.
