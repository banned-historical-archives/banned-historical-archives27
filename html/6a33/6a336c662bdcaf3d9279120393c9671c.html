DAILY BRIEF 
Congo: Belgian Foreign Minister Wigny has directed 
the immediate recall of all Belgian military personnel who 
arrived in Katanga after 1 July 1960. 
 the government 
has no information on the identity of BelOan mercenaries 
under private contract with the Tshombe government. (The 
US consul in Elisabethville warns that wholesale and indis-
criminate withdrawal of the Belgian military cadre�about 
230 officers and men--would result in the disintegration of 
the Katanga army into lawless unitg:i 
 the Soviet ambassador had twice seen the Suda-
nese foreign minister but still had not obtained transit visas 
for Soviet diplomats to go to Stanleyville. The request for the 
visas was submitted in mid-February. 
Luluabourg was quiet on 2 March, 
with UN forces and Congolese troops cooperating to maintain 
order. (Backup, Page 1) 
USSR: A test vehicle was launched from Tyura Tam at 
about 1400 GMT (0900 EST) on 3 March. Preliminary analy-
sis  indicates the vehicle impacted in 
the Khabarovsk area--about 1,100 n.m. southwest of the nor-
mal ICBM impact area on the Kamchatka peninsula�after a 
flight of some 2,700 n.m. Although determination of the spe-
cific nature of the vehicle must await further information, the 
over-all character of the operation suggests an ICBM test in 
which the missile suffered a failure in guidance.

Britain - France - Communist China: rthe American 
Embassy in London believes that the Macmillan government 
will find it difficult to continue to support the moratorium on 
the question of Chinese representation in the UN this year. }-4-
The government assumes that Communist China will inevit-
ably be voted into UN membership this year or soon there-
after, replacing Taiwan in both the General Assembly and jr.j, 
Security CounciL In the embassy's view, the Macmillan gov-
ernment further believes that it has become impossible suc-
cessfully to attach any conditions to the seating of Peiping. 4.,,,,A-1) 
The embassy concludes that recent public statements by For- ip 
eign Secretary Home and others are part of a British initia-
tive designed to secure United States acquiescence to the 
shift in seats) 
Queried about the French position by the US Embassy in 
Paris, a Foreign Ministry official said his government will 
probably soon undertake a high-level review of French policy 
on diplomatic recognition of Communist China and Chinese 
representation in the United Nations. He denied, however, 
that any shift in the French position is imminent. In the past, 
Peiping's support of the Algerian rebels has been a major stum-
bling block, but Foreign Ministry officials are now considering 
whether a French ambassador in Peiping would be useful for 
Influencing the representatives of new French-speaking African 
states which have recognized Communist China or  may do so. 
(Backup, 
Page 3) 
Communist China: Peiping is negotiating additional grain 
purchases with Australia, Canada, and Argentina which may 
result in new orders for as much as two million tons. The Chi-
nese have already purchased about $200,000,000 worth of food-
stuffs in recent months, including about three million tons of 
food grains. Peiping has undertaken a variety of emergency 
measures, such as selling silver bullion and securing short-
term credits from Hong Kong banks, to ease the pressure of

these purchases on its foreign currency resources. Although 
there has been speculation that the USSR has advanced a hard 
currency loan to China to cover the emergency grain imports, 
there is no reliable evidence that such financial backing has 
been arranged. However, Sino-Soviet economic talks, which 
�have been under way in Peiping since early February, may re-
sult in an accommodation designed to ease the Chinese balance 
of payments with the USSR by  rescheduling Peiping's debt re-
payments. 
Poland= Cuba: A contract under which Poland will provide 
Cuba with a tool plant valued at $1,959,000 was signed on 11 
February. The agreement called for a 30-percent down pay-
ment, with the balance payable in 12 semi-annual installments, 
probably at 5-percent interest. A similar contract was signed 
on 14 February for a steel foundry, worth $1,486,922, calling 
for 16 semi-annual payments. Although Poland claims these 
agreements are normal commercial transactions, the terms of-
fered could be construed as economic aid by US standards. The 
fact that these agreements were made despite repeated US warn-
ings that they could jeopardize Warsaw's chances of receiving 
financial aid from the US suggests that Warsaw is under some 
pressure to con  ritnite fn thp Cnmrminist hincIS economic aid 
effort in Cuba. (Backup, Page 5) 
South Korea: Pressure stimulated by press and student 
groups for a status-of-forces agreement is creating an issue 
in South Korea's relations with the United States. The lower 
house of the national legislature on 2 March unanimously called 
for the "earliest" conclusion of an administrative agreement, 
and Prime Minister Chang Myon has been obliged to assure the 
public that the government is acting to resolve the issue. 
South Koreans consider that the lack of an agreement der-
ogates their sovereignty, particularly because Japan has a 
status-of-forces pact. In addition, public sensitivities have 
been sharpened by the belief that recent economic measures

/The US consul in Elisabethville believes that as many as 
250 Belgian mercenaries are integrated into Katanga army 
units with the full support of the Katanga government, and 
would be difficult to deport. Any deportation order would have 
to be enforced by the UN Command, with adequate strength 
to quell possible armed resistance 
The military cadre officers are members of the Belgian 
Army, and could be ordered by the Belgian Government to 
leave Katanga. However, reluctance to leave 10,000 Belgians 
in Katanga at the mercy of an undisciplined native army will 
probably cause the Belgian Government to proceed slow137-.3 
iThere are probably 40 important official Belgian civilian 
advisers distributed among the Katanga government ministries, 
as opposed to Belgian adventurers. The American consul feels 
that loss of the official advisers would paralyze the Katanga 
government. The US Embassy in Leopoldville reports that the 
Leopoldville provincial and central governments include 400 or 
500 Belgians and that their withdrawal would drastically reduce

Western Positions on Communist China and the UN 
lThe Macmillan government's public position remains as 
stated by Lord Home in the House of Lords on 8 February. 
He argued that despite Peiping's lack of credentials as a 
peace-loving government, "the facts of international life re-
quire that Communist China should be seated in the United 
Nations." He added that Britain had supported the morato-
rium only because the choice had been "between the admis-
sion of Communist China and the breakup of the United Na-
tions. So long as that was the choice there was only one 
answer. 
[Britain's grudging support of the moratorium has come 
under increasingly heavy fire from the Labor opposition, 
from many Conservative MPs, and from public opinion gen-
erally. Noting that the policy conflicts with Britain's 11-
year-old recognition of Peiping, where a charg�s main-
tained, the government's critics find the issue a most pop-
ular one on which to belabor American Far Eastern policy 
and to charge British subservience to Washington. The 
British preoccupation with achieving a disarmament agree-
ment provides powerful support for the argument that Com-
munist China's isolation from the international community 
should be reduced. British officials tend to believe that 
bringing Peiping into contact with pacifying influences in the 
UN might lessen the chances of an attack on Taiwan or other 
areas. The British also desire to get more closely in step 
with African and Asian members of the Commonwealth, 
whose leaders will participate in the prime ministers' meet-
tings opening in London on Wednesday, 8 March 
The American Embassy, as a result of its detailed ex-
amination of the British position, concludes that the British 
have anticipated that the new US administration might make 
some changes in US China policy, and want to appear to have 
influenced Washington rather than to have followed "obediently" 
behind3 
he French Foreign Ministry official in charge of Chinese 
affairs stated on 21 February that the British attitude as stated)

Cby Lord Home was unlikely to change the French Government's 
opposition to seating Peiping. He indicated, however, that 
Paris was going to restudy the question. He himself believed 
that the situation within the UN was changing, although he felt 
that Communist China would probably spoil its own chances of 
admission by demanding unacceptable preconditions:) 
g)fficial circles in Paris apparently feel that the British 
experience in recognizing Communist China has been disap-
pointing and that there is little likelihood of a major expan-
sion of trade possibilities. If at some future date De Gaulle 
decides that to recognize Peiping would give France an advan-
tage in its over-all power position, he would face no serious 
domestic opposition to doing so. Propaganda activity in sup-
port of Communist China is being stepped up in France. The 
Sino-French Friendship Society reportedly feels that its cam-
paign in favor of official recognition of Communist China and 
its admission to the United Nations has made enough progress 
to warrant extending its drive into the French provinces. The 
New China News Agency also plans increased activity in 
France. The prominent Paris weekly L' Express, which has 
hitherto concentrated on criticizing the Algerian war, is run-
ning a series of pro-Peiping articles by the non-Communist 
leftist political leader Francois Mitterrand about his visit to 
China and his interview with Mao Tse-tung-7-s 
COther countries are reconsidering their position. The 
new Quadros administration recently announced that Brazil 
will support inclusion of the Chinese representation question 
on the UN General Assembly agenda at its next session. 
Malayan Premier Rahman, according to an unconfirmed re-
port, plans to vote for the admission of Communist China 
next September. While Canada is reviewing its support of the 
moratorium, a preliminary paper on the subject contains no 
recommendation for a change in position

Poland Signs Aid Contracts With Cuba 
Polish diplomats were reminded by US officials in Jan-
uary and February that under the Mutual Security Appropria-
tions Act of 1961 the US will refuse to grant assistance to any 
country that provides economic or military aid to the Castro 
regime. At the same time the US asked for information which 
would confirm or deny reports that Poland plans to grant eco-
nomic aid to Cuba. 
Polish officials have made clear that they do not feel obli-
gated to explain their trade with Cuba to the US, and have in-
timated that some regime leaders objected to the American 
questioning. Nevertheless, a deputy minister of foreign trade 
allowed US Embassy personnel in Warsaw to scrutinize com-
modity lists that purported to "explain" Poland's trade with 
Cuba. These lists, however, contained no information on the 
extent or� terms of trade, and did not in fact constitute a reply 
to the American inquiry. 
Both in Warsaw and Washington, Polish diplomats and 
trade representatives have attempted to confuse the issue by 
stressing that the extent of Polish trade with Cuba will be very 
small--some estimates ranging as low as $1,000,000 annually. 
However, despite a record 1960 sugar beet crop, Poland has 
already contracted for the purchase of $4,000,000 worth of 
Cuban sugar, and extensive negotiations are going on in other 
fields. An agreement was reached in December 1960 that 
Polish-Cuban trade for 1961 would total $44,000,000.

e resolution passed by the lower house of the South 
Korean Assembly on 2 March called for a status-of-forces 
agreement "in which the legal status of United States armed 
forces stationed in Korea will be provided for, as promised 
in the joint communique issued by both governments on 8 
August 1953." The Rhee government repeatedly emphasized 
its desire for such an agreement, and on this issue polit-
ically conscious Koreans support their government now as

urge conclusion of an agreement. Several demonstrations 
have recently emphasized the status-of-forces issue, and ed-
itorial comment has been extensive. The chief opposition 
party advocates early, conclusion of an agreement, and Chang 
Myon has indicated his ruling party will adopt a similar posi-
tion. Chang maintains that since there has been no fighting 
for nearly eight years, the public will not swallow the argu-
ment that the "state of war" justifies special treatment of

Cpolitical dissatisfaction this year has been aggravated by 
economic conditions and the early depletion in the southern 
provinces of winter food stocks. Consumer prices have risen 
sharply since the first of the year. Grain shortages in urban 
areas, the result of hoarding by speculators, and projected 
increases in transportation and power rates are expected to 
compound the inflationary rise and increase public restiveness)
