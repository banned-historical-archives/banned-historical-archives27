 INSIDE CIA
 the story of
 OUR SPY NETWORK
 Will Russia launch a war this year? From all ayailablr
 evidence. Washington dues not think so. Our defense effort
 today is .geared to a gradual increase of strength. There is no
 surge of activity of the kind that ;in ingnnding emergency
 would demand. Pulicv makers appear certain that the Rus-
 sians. on the whole. have no immediate incentive for war,
 that the Soviets believe the punishment they would take
 would  imperil their regime; that Moscow expects to gain
 more   han we by marking time: that it has no hope of win-
 ning it star in the near future and still believes the world nmy
 he Russia', without the necessity of undertaking a war.
 (low dues Washington reach these conclusions? Its rod
 estimate almost certainly stems in large measure from a secret
 but vital organization that has top responsibility today for
 knowing what's going on in Russia and elsewhere in the world
 -the Central Intelligence Agency. Such in organization can
 determine the fate of America. For this reason. L(X)K recently
 asked one of the country's best reporters to dig for all the pub-
 lishable facts on the CIA and its associate agency. the Psycho-
 logical Strategy Board. Here is his report.-TIIF FDITORS
 CEASta.FSSt.v alert in Washington are two super hush-hush
 organizations dedicated to preserving the security and
 best interests of the United States against the Soviet Union.
 Both are as silent as a man with adhesive tape strapped across
 his mouth. They are like sunken watchtowers. like human
 seismographs.
 One is the Central Intelligence Agency and the other.
 even less well-known. is the Psychological Strategy Board.
 Each is autonomous. but they interlock. and their highly
 "classified" (   secret) reports help form the basis for our
 cold-war policy.
 Upon the quality of their work, the future of the United
 States vis-a-vis Soviet Russia may well depend.
 Recently members of a well-meaning women's organiza-
 tion in Washington wanted to pass a resolution publicly
 commending the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency). The CIA
 was sounded out. whereupon word went down to the women's
 organization: "If you commend us for good work. you know
 more about us than you should. And if you know that much
 about us. we are not doing good work.'
 The atmosphere around the CIA suggests-let us put it
 mildly-certain precautions. Every visitor is checked in and
 out of each office. but the words "Central Intelligence Agency"
 do not appear on the slip of paper he must fill out.
 Every official and employee of CIA. before being hired.
 must undergo an exhaustive security check. On top of the
 regular FBI and other checks. the CIA maintains a security
 office of its own. for further top-secret investigation. Although

 Under `Beetle'
 CIA head. Gen. Smith, right, is es-ambassador to Russia. He talks here with a Soviet attache.
 the CIA does not speak of it. some of its em-
 ployees voluntarily take lie-detector tests. If
 an employee engaged in particularly ".sensi-
 tiv(." work marries. the prospect ire wife or
 husband is carefully investigated.
 Office trash is shredded and burned in the
 CIA's own incinerator. When an official wants
 to destroy confidential notes or work sheets,
 he does not put them into the wastebasket.
 They are carefully packed into big envelopes.
 and then are actually put into his safe, to
 await the daily collection. Even the ashtrays
 are emptied by "classified" charwomen, and
 stenographers are obliged to take their type-
 writer ribbons out of their machines each
 night and lock them in the ottice safe, if secret
 documents have been typed and if the ribbons
 are new.
 If a CIA official is carrying important
 documents even on such a short trip as to the
 Pentagon, it is recommended that he go in a
 Government car with a chauffeur trained to
 know what to do in case of an emergency: for
 instance. if there should be an accident. On
 trips out of town. CIA officials themselves
 never carry important documents, which are
 transmitted by a special top-secret carrier
 service.
 If a CIA man should be hurt in a traffic
 accident, or otherwise. wheels instantly move
 within wheels and he is removed from the
 jurisdiction of local hospitals or police. If a
 CIA man should happen to blow up with ner-
 vous strain, and have to he placed in some in-
 stitution- it sometimes happens he will  be
 taken care of by the organization's own medi-
 cal staff.
 The main CIA building is not identified as
 such. The gate carries the street number, noth-
 ing more. It is, however. listed in the telephone
 book, because nonlisting would defeat its own
 purpose by making the organization more
 rather than less conspicuous. For a time, em-
 ployees calling at other Government bureaus
 were forbidden to reveal that they worked for
 the C'IA, but this had to be given up for the
 same reason. But the badges CIA officials carry
 land which they must show on entering and
 leaving every installation) do not carry the
 name of the organization.
 One day I met an officer, whom I knew to
 he it colonel, in civilian dress. I saw him again
 the next day and he was in uniform. This was
 because he had to attend a military meeting.
 and for him to have been nit of uniform might
 have groused comment. It is really something
 when a military man wears his uniform its a
 disguise.
 "An intelligence officer who talks about
 his business ceases to be an intelligence otti-
 ct'r." Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, the director of
 Central Intelligence, said recently. Indeed his
 men are close-mouthed, and in something like
 thirty years of journalism I have never en-
 countered an organization so difficult to write
 about.
 Function of CIA Is Explained
 Nevertheless the CIA--like the PSB -is
 willing to treat the visitor with courtesy, and
 say something. This, too, is as it should be,
 because both organizations are supported by
 public funds and owe a definite responsibility
 to the public.
 The Central  Intelligence Agency cam,'
 into being in 1947. Its function. informally
 stated. is to collect. correlate. analyze, evalu-
 ate and disseminate intelligence It co-operates
 with other intelligence groups serving the
 Government  in particular those of the Army.
 Vary, Air Force. Atomic Energy Commission.
 State Department. and FBI and attempts to
 make a clear pattern toy all in the field of na-
 tional security. It has the right to inspect the
 lilt's of the FBI and other organizations con-
 cerned- to the extent recommended by the Na-
 tional Security Council and approved by the
 President, and it is responsible only to the
 National Security Council itself, which means
 tl-e President
 The CIA protects the vital interests of the
 United States outside the country, just as the
 FBI works inside. The frontier between the
 CIA and FBI is the coastal fringe of America.
 The CIA has offices in more than 20 Amer-
 ican cities. and foreign installations scattered
 from Okinawa to Cyprus. In Washington alone
 it occupies :t4 different buildings, but most of
 these arc small. and they are widely separated
 throughout the city.
 One taboo subject is the number of eth-
 ployccs. This figure is so secret that not more
 than a dozen men in the CIA itself know it.
 A guess might be 5.000. Another guess might
 be 10.000
 Another taboo subject is the budget for
 intelligence. One estimate I heard was $75.-
 000.000. 1 do not vouch for it. If that is all it is.
 the CIA is cheap at the price. It costs $3,000.000
 to build a single jet bomber these days, and
 S200.000,000 to equip an armored division.
 Not until the Office of Strategic Services
 was set up under Gen. William J. (Wild Bill)
 Donovan in World War 11 did the United States
 possess an espionage structure on the national
 level, centrally directed and systematically
 organized.
 Agency Succeeded Wartime OSS
 The OSS broke up after the war, and its
 remains were split between the State Depart-
 ment and the Army. After several years of
 agony and frustration. it became clear to the
 people who count in Washington that some
 new organization must be created. The need
 was imperative. Hence at-use the CIA.
 The CIA limped badly at first, and got
 badly kicked around. Rival departments were
 reluctant to give up or share their functions,
 and hated the idea of a new autonomous or-
 ganization. The State Department, in particu-
 lar. zealously strove to keep all gathering of
 political  information  in its own  province.
 IA?adership in the CIA was not forceful enough.
 and good men melted away. Boners came in
 the utilization of intelligence, for instance in
 reference to Korea in 1950. and the CIA was
 among the organizations blamed.
 Two things then occurred. which ended
 this unhappy situation.
 First. a top-secret committee was ap-
 pointed by Mr Truman to go over the affairs
 of the CIA. and rake it from stem to stern.
 Second. Gen. Walter Bedell (Beetlel Smith
 was apisnnted to be director of Central Intel-
 ligence in October. 1950. And he has done a

 going to serve at a desk or out in the field as a
 secret agent, needs a lot of training. One hush-
 hush detail is that, by special act of Congress,
 the CIA may import into the United States a
 certain number of aliens every year. One diffi-

 CIA gets intelligence from spies, other sources; PSB uses
 I
 -some three million words a day. which is four
 and a half times longer than the Bible.
 Another important source of information
 is documents. Ceaselessly the CIA picks up
 newspapers, magazines, technical journals, re-
 ports of all kinds, from every corner of the
 globe and microscopically scrutinizes what
 they say.
 A fundamental problem in intelligence.
 one CIA expert told me, is "appropriate guid-
 ance from the consumer." It simplifies the
 work of the CIA immensely if it knows what
 the "consumer" (Mr. Truman, the National
 Security Council, or any interested body of the
 Government) wants to know, and more why
 it wants to know. Suppose a request comes for
 an analysis of the coastline of Country X
 Very good. But what is this analysis for? Mine-
 laying? Beach assaults? Capacity to grow new
 types of seaweed? The more refined and de-
 tailed the request, the better the CIA can
 operate. The CIA can deliver, if it gets proper
 guidance.
 These are some things, on various levels,
 that the CIA might be called upon to find out:
 What is current production in Mine
 817 in the Czech uranium fields? Is this
 better than last year? Any labor trouble
 in this particular mine?
 How many of the leading Japanese
 Communists have been in China recently,
 and what was their experience there?
 How many atomic bombs has the
 Soviet Union?
 an oil man may be asked for an opinion. Fi-
 nally, the report goes to a special (and ultra-
 hush-hush) panel of top-flight civilians not in
 the Government. The membership of this panel
 shifts according to the problem involved.
 The original contributors are empowered
 to comment on the finished product, and dis-
 senting minority reports are permitted. Then
 the documents go to the departments con-
 cerned. the National Security Council and the
 President, and become (in theory at least)
 a solid basis of an overall, integrated national
 policy.
 Scene Shortcomings Criticized
 These reports, though everybody concedes
 that they are conscientiously and competently
 done, have been roundly criticized on occasion
 on three scores: (1) Since, by and large, so
 many Government agencies sit in on their
 production, they are likely to represent the
 lowest common denominator of opinion. To
 get agreement, everybody sacrifices something.
 They are compromises, and compromise on
 intelligence is bad. (2) The high level people
 only begin to work after the junior experts
 have paved the way, and these juniors-being
 human - are not omniscient. The technical
 staff at the bottom ought to be better. (3)
 Even the wisest men are fallible on matters so
 broad. Suppose we want to calculate the future
 intentions of Mao Tse-tung toward India, or
 of India toward Mao Tse-tung. Either cal-
 culation will be quite a job.
 Who decides what will go all the way up
 to the President? Answer-the President. Mr.
 Truman is interested in every aspect of the
 CIA. and, quite aside from his role in supreme
 decisions, he likes to keep his finger on every-
 thing that is going on.
 Should the CIA, instead of being co-
 ordinator, be the boss? Should it in other
 words, take over all other Government intel-
 ligence functions? No. One reason is, that
 neither the military nor the State Department
 would agree. Another is that the CIA does
 not want to be bothered with purely tactical
 military intelligence. Another is that. al-
 though it has a large scientific section, its
 'unction in this field is primarily to be a co-
 ordinator. since science is so specialized.
 Does the present setup cause too much
 duplication?  Not  necessarily.  Duplication
 means competition, which is good.
 Can the CIA guarantee against another
 Pearl Harbor? Certainly not. General Smith
 has made this clear on several occasions. A
 sneak attack from the air, or by sabotage,
 is always possible; no radar screen, no intel-
 ligence system, is or ever can be absolutely
 fool proof. But the CIA thinks that it has
 produced the focussing mechanism whereby,
 if a sneak attack does occur, it can be countered
 with the maximum of promptness and effi-
 ciency.
 "Intelligence is always an unfinished busi-
 ness. We're never as good as we want to be,"
 says General Smith. "We can't talk about what
 successes we have achieved, because that
 would give our hand away."
 I met one high otikial in the Pentagon, an
 old friend whom I trust. He talked about the
 achievements of the CIA, and then said, "If
 only I could tell you some of the things it's
 done!"
 Analysis *I Facts Is lasperiant
 The CIA is an assembly line; it is not the
 boss. For a large part of its intelligence, it
 relies on other agencies. So a major question
 is-How well does it evaluate?
 On day-to-day issues, this is the province
 of a special desk geared for quick action, and
 its director works much like the city editor of
 a big newspaper. Suppose a monitored broad-
 cast, a news ticker, or the State Department
 teletype reports that a West German Commu-
 nist leader has made a cryptic, unexpected
 speech saying such-and-such. Will this have
 any effect on the American position in Berlin?
 The report is reviewed by expert analysts-
 who know German and Germany well. In a
 matter of minutes, the first "flash" will be on
 the appropriate desk; in a matter of hours, a
 full report will be ready.
 Every afternoon at a certain hour, the
 day's entire grist of current information is
 processed. The appraisals are worked over
 during the evening and are ready for mimeo-
 graphing by midnight: then they are delivered
 to the customers the next morning. Some gq
 straight to the President; some go to the Chiefs
 of Staff.
 On long-range matters, the procesas is
 more complex. A series of "National Esti-
 mates" is steadily in process of being written,
 on every conceivable variety of topic dealing
 with the country's interests. These are pro-
 pared after elaborate consultation-not merely
 within the CIA itself-but with representatives
 of the various agencies who meet with General
 Smith once a week, like the Office of Naval
 Intelligence, the Army's G2, Air Force intel-
 ligence and State Department experts. Out-
 side people may be called in for consultation;
 for instance, if a petroleum problem is at issue,
 PSB C?operatas with CIA
 Turn briefly now to the Psychological
 Strategy Board-PSB-with which CIA works
 closely. Just as CIA derives from the old OSS,
 so-does PSB derive (in one sense) from the
 old Office of War Information. The CIA, gen-
 erally speaking, is an intelligence agency; the
 PSB is concerned with cold-war strategy.
 Neither makes policy, but the PSB has a hand
 in developing policy.
 "Psychological Strategy" really means
 "Psychological Warfare." This, in turn, means
 propaganda. The PSB works in all fields of
 propaganda, both "black" and "white," but
 most" of its activity is too secret for any de-
 tailed mention. Both organizations are close-
 mouthed, PSB only slightly less so than the
 CIA. Shakespeare described their methods
 well: "Seal up your lips, and give no words but
 mum."
 The PSB is housed in a smallish double
 building in the middle of Washington, and
 there is no name plate on the door.
 The Presidential Directive (not Act of
 Congress) which set up the PSB in 1951 has
 been published only as a classified document,

 we rely on most is a fiercely tarp scrutiny of
 the whole Russian economy. rat merely from
 day to day. but tram month to month and year
 to year Mainly the job is a slow, detailed, la-
 borious. pdantic. dirty Job of meticulously
 fitting together small bits of information.
 The knowledge accumulated is then ap-
 plied to the crucial problems that confront us-
 for instance. Do the Russians intend to make a
 aeneral war'
 The CIA might set about analyzing this
 problem as follows'
 I  No prohibitions against war exist in
 Stalinist doctrine. war is recognized as an In-
 strument in Russian national policy. There-
 fore, on theory. the possibility of war cannot
 be ignored.
 2 The Russians are a severely realistic
 people. and, before embarking on war, would
 be certain to ask themselves if they would
 gain or lase by such action.
 3. To estimate their guesses on this, we
 have to estimate how well they think they are
 setting on with their present cold-war tactics.
 Always we must work on two levels. (a) What
 do they think, or. rather. what do we think
 they think' Ib) What do we think'
 4 It they think they are doing well with-
 out war. war s unlikely. Moreover, they must
 attempt to assess 1 a) what our response would
 hr to aggressive action in Europe. lb) how vul-
 nerable they are to counter attack. They know
 will that the American Strategic Air Force
 exists. and they probably have a toad idea of
 what it could do. Will they make a war. it they
 know that Moscow will be destroyed the next
 morning'
 S. A vast number of other, calculations
 have to be attempted. For instance, the Rus-
 sians might think that they could win a abort
 war. But what about a long war. which would
 brine into play the full power of American in-
 dustrial production'
 0 What about accidents? Could a blunder
 start a war that no one wanted'
 7 Could a civil war at Germany. if one
 should occur. provoke a general war?
 No human being can answer questions like
 these with certainty or prepare exact plans to
 take care of them. What the CIA and PSB are
 trying to do is get the best possible consoli-
 dated guess or estimate.
 The American people can be sure they are
 doing a first-class job
