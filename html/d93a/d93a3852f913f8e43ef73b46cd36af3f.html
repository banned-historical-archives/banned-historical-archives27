17078 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
the offbeat, the unpopular and?often?the 
unheard of. Material for KRAB has to meet 
only two conditions: it must have inherent 
quality and It must, by its very nature, be 
unlikely to get aired by any other radio 
station. 
The character of KRAB, both on and off 
the air, has been shaped by its founder, 
Lorenzo Milam, who also doubles as its pro-
gram director, chief announcer and head 
politician. "If there's just one guy who 
thinks that certain stuff is great," says 
Milam, "I'll play it." 
A tall, affable 30-year-old who was crip-
pled by polio in his youth, Milani spends 
much of his time coaxing the right people 
(he hopes) into appearing on KRAB as com-
mentators, interviewers or panelists?a role 
that is particularly attractive because panel 
members are served beer or wine while on 
the air. Mile= makes a special point of 
attracting extremists. "Those wild ideas," 
he says, "you've got to have them to form 
your own opinions somewhere in between." 
Perhaps the strangest thing about KRAB 
Is that it should have sprouted and flour-
ished here in Seattle when the original seed 
was sown some 3,000 miles away. That was 
In Jacksonville, Fla., Milam's hometown, 
where the young Lorenzo used to lie awake 
nights listening to east coast stations and 
Imagining how he might revolutionize their 
programing. 
Years afterward, in 1959, Milam appeared 
personally before the Federal Communica-
tions Commission in Washington, D.C., and 
proclaimed his wish to start a station. "They 
thought that was pretty funny," he recalls 
now. 
His initial ploy was to launch a KRAB-
type operation in Washington itself. This 
proved fruitless, so Milam decided to apply 
for a commercial license in some other city. 
His first choice was Seattle, which he had 
never visited but which, from everything be 
had heard, sounded like a reasonably civilized 
place. 
The application that he filed with the FCC 
made three essential claims: (1) He was 
legally qualified to own a station ("You have 
to prove you are a good guy," he says); (2) 
he was technically qualified by virtue of 
owning a transmitter of 1946 vintage which 
had cost him $5,000; and (3) he was finan-
cially qualified because of liquid assets ex-
ceeding $15,000 that he had inherited from 
his father. 
Milam mailed in his application and took 
off for Spain. A year later, he got the FCC's 
go-ahead. It was in April 1962 that Milam 
arrived here without fanfare to start KRAB. 
The choice of call letters had partially 
been a fluke. The FCC required applicants 
to submit 10 combinations of 4 letters, 
listed in order of preference. Milam headed 
his list with KLEE ("I like his paintings") 
and KANT ("the philosopher; I have not 
read his works, but"). The FCC passed 
these over in favor of No. 3?KRAB. It had 
been included "more or less facetiously," ac-
cording to /Clam, but he has no regrets. 
"A crab can go in all directions," he points 
out. "In time of danger, it can scuttle un-
der the nearest rock, and it is capable of de-
livering a vicious bite." 
After looking over Seattle, Milam decided 
to locate the station in an abandoned build-
ing at 91st Northeast and Roosevelt Way, 
which he now rents for $75 a month. Then 
he advertised in Broadcasting magazine for 
"an engineer to work with no pay." To his 
surprise, Milam got one?a teenage tech-
nical genius named Jeremy Lansman, of San 
Francisco, who, at 13, had run his own six-
station network by making 5-watt trans-
mitters and passing them out among his 
neighborhood pals?until the FCC smashed 
the illicit operation. 
After 6 weeks of tinkering, Lansman got 
KRAB's ancient transmitter to perk. 
"Then," recalls Milam, "the bloody power 
transformer started shooting blue sparks all 
over the place, so we took it out on the 
street and started beating and kicking it. 
That was our first live broadcast?us taking 
out all our aggressions on the old trans-
former." 
Even now, KRAB has only two paid em-
ployees. One of these is Charles Howlett, 
an engineering student who has succeeded 
Lansman and earns $25 a week as chief tech-
nician. The other is Robert Garfias, an 
ethnomusicologist at the university, who 
makes $25 weekly as the station's music 
director. 
All performers appear without pay, and 
they are a decidely diverse group. Among 
KRAB's commentators have been Dr. William 
Halliday, a physician who favors conserva-
tion and opposes Federal medical plans; 
Prank Krasnowski of the Socialist Workers' 
(or Trotskyite) Party; Father Thomas 
O'Brien, a conservative who is director of 
the honors program at Seattle University; 
Donald Flynn of the John Birch Soicety; 
Dr. Frederick Eimer, a radiologist and critic 
of fluoridation; and Deb Das, as Indian-born 
graduate student at the university who 
espouses a mystical approach to politics. 
The number of subscribers now exceeds 
500, which assures KRAB a monthly income 
of more than $500. The station costs $975 
a month to operate. The gap is closed, more 
or less, through such fundraising gimmicks 
as concerts, cover-charge parties and out-
right begging. Solicitations are spearheaded 
by a group called Claw?the Committee to 
Enlighten the Airwaves?which is run by Bud 
Havlisch and his wife, Sylvia. Havlisch is 
a longshoreman. 
But the station's best promotion is the 
bimonthly program guide that Milarn puts 
together. In it he writes passionate paeans 
to KRAB in a Dos Passos-esque style. To 
him, the transmitter has a "great smelly 
driving hum." The sound is therapeutic, 
for it means "that your scurrilous words are 
flooding the countryside, bouncing off hills 
and trees, ramming headlong into cows ? * ? 
filtering into that radio, into that tiny coil 
of heat ? * ? red, deep, mysterious." 
Not long ago, the program guide listed a 
discussion of "The Origin of the Species," 
which was to be followed by an "Origin of 
the Species Concert" blending Australian 
aboriginal music, Charlie Mingus and Pithe-
canthropus Erectus. A program of "Poems 
by TziontAs PELLy" (written long before he 
went to Congress and accompanied by ap-
propriate music) was followed several weeks 
later by "Poems by Mao Tse-tung" because 
the guide explained, "It has been claimed 
that our presentation of the poetry of 
Thomas PELLY did not give equal time to the 
other side." 
As a clearinghouse for ideas. Which makes 
KR.AB invaluable to Seattle, the station is 
wide open to charges of propagandizing. 
However, Milam himself is entirely apolitical. 
"I was sort of a mushy liberal in school," 
he concedes, "but this station has been an 
eye opener. I've found there are Just as 
many finks on the left as on the right. I'm 
confused. My views change from day to day. 
I tend to agree with the individual I'm drink-
ing beer with. To hell with politics?I 
prefer Baroque music."

NOTICE OF OBJECTION TO LIM-
ITING DEBATE ON FOREIGN AID 
BILL 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield. 
Mr. MORSE. I think, in fairness to 
the Senator from Montana and myself, 
I should say that, as I did last year, I 
take the position that the foreign aid 
bill should be discussed under the rules 
of the Senate, without any agreements 
involving any limitations fixing a time 
to vote or any of the other provisions 
that can be made by unanimous consent. 
But I want the Senator to know I speak 
In good faith when I tell him I have every 
Intention of expediting the handling of 
the foreign aid bill in every possible way, 
consistent with adequate and full dis-
cussion of the points involved. I be-
lieve time will be saved by following that 
course of action. 
I thought, in fairness to myself, I 
should make that statement, so it is un-
derstood that as we undertake consider-
ation of the foreign aid bill this year, I 
shall take the position that it should be 
discussed under the rules of the S te. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I th t 
ator. 
AMENDMENT OF SECTION 3 OF 
MINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT 
OF 1946 
-Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to reconsider Senate bill 1666, 
and that the Senate reconsider the votes 
by which the bill was ordered to be en-
grossed for a third reading, and was read 
the third time, and passed. 
Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, has this matter 
been cleared? 
Mr. HUMPHREY. Yes, it has been 
cleared, I assure the Senator. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
will be stated by title. 
The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. A bill (S. 
1 amend section 3 of the Admini-
strative Procedure Act, chapter 324, of 
the act of June 11, 1946 (60 Stat. 238), to 
clarify and protect the right of the public 
to information, and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the unanimous-consent re-
quest to reconsider the engrossment, 
third reading, and passage of the bill? 
The Chair hears no objection. 
The bill is before the Senate. 
Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, on 
Tuesday, July 28, 1964, the Senate passed 
without debate S. 1666, amendments to 
section 3 of the Administrative Procedure 
Act of 1946 (60 Stat. 238) , I entered sub-
sequently a motion of reconsideration of 
S. 1666, and the bill returned to the 
calendar. 
I want to make it crystal clear to every 
Senator that I am not opposed to S. 1666. 
It deals with the vital subject of access of 
Information in Federal agencies and 
every Senator knows that certain agen-
cies through the years have abused in a 
most flagrant manner the legitimate 
right to withhold certain privileged or 
confidential information. The time for

Declassified and Approved For Release 2014/02/21 : CIA-RDP66B00403R000300110002-6 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 17079 
a thorough revision of the statutes deal-
ing with governmental disclosure of in-
formation is long overdue. 
I did, however, believe that an oppor-
tunity should be afforded for some debate 
and discussion on this important bill. 
For this reason, and for this reason 
alone, I entered a motion of reconsidera-
tion. 
The Senator from Minnesota is not a 
lawyer and not a member of the Judi-
ciary Committee. The distinguished 
Senator from Missouri [Mr. LONG] con-
ducted hearings in October 1963, and 
again last week on this legislation. The 
committee approved 21 amendments to 
the original text of S. 1666; it is my 
understanding that these amendments 
removed a number of problems which 
had arisen in relation to the original bill. 
I commend the distinguished and able 
Senator from Missouri [Mr. LONG] for 
his diligent labors to produce a fair and 
balanced bill. 
There have been brought to my atten-
tion several areas where additional clari-
fication would be helpful. I have pre-
pared certain amendments which would, 
in my opinion, assist in clarifying these 
sections. It may, however, be possible 
to accomplish the objective of removing 
these potential ambiguities or uncer-
tainties through a more complete exposi-
tion of the committee's intention without 
actually having to amend S. 1666. 
I would, therefore, like to discuss these 
Possible amendments with the distin-
guished Senator from Missouri, seek his 
advice and counsel on their desirability, 
and achieve whatever clarification he 
deems to be necessary. 
Let me read through these proposals 
in their entirety. 
First. On page 4, lines 19-20, strike 
the words, "prior to the commencement 
of the proceedings". 
Since agencies often group cases for 
hearing and decision, it should not be 
necessary to index one of them before 
the others can be decided. 
Second. On page 5, lines 12-14, amend 
clause (4) of section 3(c) to read as 
follows: 
(4) trade secrets and information ob-
tained from the public in confidence or 
customarily privileged or confidential. 
The existing clause (4) of the revised 
section 3(c) which purports to exempt 
from disclosure information obtained 
from the public which is "customarily 
privileged or confidential" would not ap-
pear to exempt wage data submitted to 
the Bureau Of Labor Statistics, and the 
Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. De-
partment of Labor in confidence and 
used by them in preparing and publish-
ing wage studies and surveys. This 
situation should be remedied because 
these wage studies and surveys are used 
by the Department as a basis for pre-
vailing wage determinations which the 
Department is required to make. Unless 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics can con-
tinue to assure those from whom wage 
data are obtained that these data will be 
kept confidential, the Bureau's sources of 
information in these vital fields could be 
seriously jeopardized. As presently 
drafted, clause (4) might interfere with 
the effective enforcement of the Pair 
Labor Standards Act, the Labor-Man-
agement Reporting and Disclosure Act, 
and the Welfare and Pension Plans Dis-
closure Act. 
Third. On page 5, lines 14-15, amend 
clause (5) of section 3(c) to read as 
follows: 
(5) intra-agency or interagency memo-
randa or letters dealing with matters of fact, 
law or policy. 
As presently written clause (5) of the 
amended section 3(c) appears not to 
exempt intra-agency or interagency 
memoranda or letters dealing with mat-
ters of fact. For example, clause (5) 
would apparently not exempt memo-
randa prepared by agency employees for 
themselves or their superiors purport-
ing to give their evaluation of the credi-
bility of evidence obtained from wit-
nesses or other sources. The knowledge 
that their views might be made public 
information would interfere with the 
freedom of judgment of agency em-
ployees and color their views accord-
ingly. Memoranda summarizing facts 
used as a basis for recommendations for 
agency action would likewise appear to 
be excluded from the exemption con-
tained in clause (5) . 
Fourth. On page 5, lines 18 to 20, 
amend clause (7) of section 3(c) to read 
as follows: 
(7) investigatory files 
On page 5, beginning on line 18, insert 
a new clause (8) , as follows, and renum-
ber the present clause (8) as clause (9) : 
(8) statements of agency witnesses until 
such witnesses are called to testify in an 
action or proceeding and request is timely 
made by a private party for the production 
of relevant parts of such statements for pur-
poses of cross examination. 
Clause (7) of the amended section (3) 
would appear to open up investigatory 
files to an extent that goes beyond any-
thing required by the courts, including 
the decision of the Supreme Court in the 
Jencks case. This clause, for example, 
which provides for disclosure of investi-
gatory files as soon as they "affect an 
action or proceeding or a private party's 
effective participation therein" is suscep-
tible to the interpretation that once a 
complaint of unfair labor practice is filed 
by the General Counsel of the NLRB, 
access could be had to the, statements of 
all witnesses, whether or not these state-
ments are relied upon to support the 
complaint. 
Witnesses would be loath to give state-
ments if they knew that their statements 
were going to be made known to the 
parties before the hearing. While wit-
nesses would continue to be protected 
in testifying at the hearing, they would 
enjoy no protection prior to that time. 
Substantial litigation would be required 
before the full scope and effects of clause 
(7) would be clear. 
A pending draft report of the ABA 
Committee on Board Practice and Proce-
dure states that: 
In the consideration of section 102.118 of 
the Board's rules by last year's Committee 
on Board Practice and Procedure there was 
considerable opposition to any rule which 
would permit a party to engage in a fishing 
expedition into the Board's investigation files. 
It was felt that the opening of the Board's 
files to inspection would seriously handicap 
the Board in the investigation of charges. 
The committee concluded that the 
Board's investigatory files should be ex-
empt from disclosure. The Board would, 
of course, like all other administrative 
agencies of the Government, continue to 
be governed by the rule laid down by the 
U.S. Supreme Court in the Jencks case. 
Mr. President, I have cited these pro-
posals and I would welcome comment 
from the able chairman of the commit-
tee. 
Mr. LONG of Missouri. Mr. Presi-
dent, I thank the distinguished majority 
whip for bringing these matters to the 
attention of the Senate. I think it is 
very helpful to have discussions of 
these matters before the bill is finally 
passed and sent to the House. 
I have listened with great interest to 
the suggestions made by the Senior Sen-
ator from Minnesota and would like 
to comment on them one by one. 
First, there is a suggestion with re-
spect to an amendment to section 3(b) , 
eliminating the words "prior to the com-
mencement of the proceeding." These 
words ? were added to protect private 
parties from being surprised in a pro-
ceeding of which they could have had 
no knowledge. Therefore, I believe they 
should be retained in the section. 
The next suggestion relates to the ex-
emption in section 3(c), relating to 
"trade secrets and other information ob-
tained from the public and customarily 
privileged or confidential." This lan-
guage in itself is quite broad and I be-
lieve would certainly cover such material 
as "wage data submitted to the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics" as mentioned by the 
senior Senator from Minnesota. The 
suggestion that we add the words "in 
confidence" to the phrase "information 
obtained from the public" might result 
in certain agencies taking much infor-
mation from the public "in confidence" 
in the future that has not customarily 
been considered confidential or priv-
ileged. This is something which we 
should seek to avoid and I believe that 
the language in the present exemption 
number (4) is sufficiently broad. 
The suggestion with respect to excep-
tion (5) , adding "matters of fact" to 
"matters of law or policy" would result 
In a great lessening of information avail-
able to the public and to the press. 
Furthermore, the example cited with re-
spect to intra-agency memorandums giv-
ing evidence of the credibility of evidence 
obtained from witnesses or other sources, 
leads me to point out that there is noth-
ing in this bill which would override 
normal privileges dealing with the work 
product and other memorandums sum-
marizing facts used as a basis for recom-
mendations for agency action if those 
facts were otherwise available to the 
public. 
The last two suggestions relate to in-
vestigatory files and an inclusion in the 
bill of the substance of the Jencks rule. 
I believe that this is a valuable sugges-
tion but I would suggest as a substitute 
for the Senator's two proposals that we

combine them and restate exception (7) 
as a new proposal which would read as 
follows: "investigatory files compiled for 
law enforcement purposes except to the 
extent they are by law available to a 
private party." 
If this language is agreeable to the 
Senator from Minnesota, I hereby move 
that the bill is amended accordingly. 
Mr. HUMPHREY. In other words, one 
amendment can take care of the situa-
tion. 
Mr. LONG of Missouri. Yes; one 
amendment. 
Mr. HUMPRREY. I would be very 
appreciative if the Senator would do that. 
Mr. LONG of Missouri. The amend-
ment is at the desk. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
amendment will be stated. 
The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. On page 5, 
at lines 18 to 20, it is proposed to amend 
clause (7) to read as follows: "investiga-
tory files compiled for law enforcement 
purposes except to the extent they are by 
law available to a private party." 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
question is on agreeing to the amendment 
offered by the Senator from Missouri. 
The amendment was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
bill is before the Senate and open to 
further amendment. 
Mr. HUMPHREY. I thank the Sena-
tor from Missouri for his great courtesy 
and his patience in this matter. I deeply 
regret that I found it necessary to move 
to reconsider the vote by which the bill 
had been passed. I told the Senator pri-
vately, and I now tell him publicly, that 
this is a very complex piece of legislation, 
and he has devoted hours of work to it. 
He is to be highly commended for his 
diligence and careful attention to this 
very important subject. We all wish to 
have governmental information made 
available; and proper public access to 
information, I am sure, is one of the real 
objectives of a free society. We must 
seek to strilt e a workable balance in this 
controversial area. I know that the 
House will wish to examine into this pro-
posed legislation with the same diligence 
that the Senator and his subcommittee 
have given to this bill. This is a most 
difficult area in which to legislate and 
I know the House committee will ex-
amine these proposals with care and ob-
jectivity. 
Mr. LONG of Missouri. I thank the 
distinguished Senator from Minnesota 
for his help. I am grateful to him. I 
am sure the committee is very apprecia-
tive of his help and his courtesy and in-
terest in this matter. He has been very 
helpful. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
is open to further amendment. If there 
be no further amendment to be proposed, 
the question is on the engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
for a third reading, and was read the 
third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall it pass? 
The bill (S. 1666) was passed, as fol-
lows: 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House 
qf Representatives of the United States of 
America in Congress assembled, That section 
3 of chapter 324 of the Act of June 11, 1946 
(60 Stat. 238), is amended to read as follows: 
"SEC. 3. (a) PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL 
REsnrrza.?Except to the extent that there is 
Involved (1) any function of the United 
States requiring secrecy for the protection 
of national security or (2) any matter re-
lating solely to the internal management 
of an agency, every agency shall separately 
state and currently publish in the Federal 
Register for the guidance of the public (A) 
descriptions of its central and field organi-
zation and the established places at which, 
the officers from whom, and methods where-
by, the public may secure information, make 
submittals or requests, or obtain decisions; 
(B) statements of the general course and 
method by which its functions are channeled 
and determined, including the nature and 
requirements of all formal or informal pro-
cedures available, rules of procedure, descrip-
tions of forms available or the places at 
which forms may be obtained, and instruc-
tions as to the scope and contents of all 
papers, reports, or examinations; (C) sub-
stantive rules of general applicability 
adopted as authorized by law and statements 
of general policy or interpretations of gen-
eral applicability formulated and adopted by 
the agency and (D) every amendment, re-
vision, or repeal of the foregoing. Except to 
the extent that he has actual notice of the 
terms thereof, no person shall in any manner 
be required to resort to, or be bound or ad-
versely affected by any matter required to be 
published in the Federal Register and not 
published therein or in a publication In-
corporated by reference in the Federal 
Register. 
"(b) AGENCY OPINIONS, ORDERS, AND 
RuLas.?Except to the extent that matter (1) 
Is specifically required by Executive order to 
be kept secret for the protection of the na-
tional defense or foreign policy; (2) relates 
solely to the Internal personnel rules and 
practices of any agency; or (3) Is specifically 
exempted from disclosure by statute, every 
agency shall, in accordance with published 
rules, make available for public inspection 
and copying all final opinions (including 
concurring and dissenting opinions) and all 
orders made in the adjudication of cases, and 
those rules, statements of policy, and inter-
pretations which have been adopted by the 
agency, affect the public and are not required 
to be published in the Federal Register, un-
less such opinions, orders, rules, statements, 
and interpretations are promptly published 
and copies offered for sale. To the extent 
required to prevent a clearly unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy, an agency may 
delete identifying details when it makes 
available or publishes an opinion or order; 
and to the extent required to protect the 
public interest, an agency may delete iden-
tifying details when it makes available or 
publishes a rule, statement of policy, or in-
terpretation; however, in any case the justi-
fication for the deletion must be fully ex-
plained in writing. Every agency also shall 
maintain and make available for public in-
spection and copying a current index provid-
ing identifying information for the public as 
to each final order, opinion, rule, statement 
of policy, and interpretation of general ap-
plicability. No final order or opinion may 
be cited as precedent, and no opinion, rule, 
statement of policy, or interpretation which 
Is issued, adopted, or promulgated after the 
effective date of this Act may be relied upon, 
used, or cited as precedent by an agency 
against any private party unless it has been 
indexed and either made available or pub-
lished as provided in this subsection or un-
less prior to the commencement of the pro-
ceeding all private parties shall have actual 
notice of the terms thereof. 
" (C) AGENCY Riscosns.?Every agency shall, 
in accordance with published rules stating 
the time, place, and procedure to be followed, 
make all its records promptly available to 
any person except those particular records 
or parts thereof which are (1) specifically 
required by Executive order to be kept secret 
for the protection of the national defense or 
foreign policy; (2) relates solely to the in-
ternal personnel rules and practices of any 
agency; (3) specifically exempted from dis-
closure by statute; (4) trade secrets and 
other information obtained from the public 
and customarily privileged or confidential; 
(5) intra-agency or interagency memoran-
dums or letters dealing solely with matters 
of law or policy; (6) personnel files, medical 
files, and similar matter the disclosure of 
which would constitute a clearly unwar-
ranted invasion of personal privacy; and (7) 
investigatory files compiled for law enforce-
ment purposes except to the extent they are 
by law available to a private party; and (8) 
contained in or related to examination, op-
erating, or condition reports prepared by, on 
behalf of, or for the use of any agency re-
sponsible for the regulation or supervision 
of financial instttutions. Upon complaint, 
the district court of the United States in the 
district in which the complainant resides, or 
has his principal place of business, or in 
which the agency is situated shall have juris-
diction to enjoin the agency from further 
withholding, and to order the production of 
any agency records or information improperly 
withheld from the complainant by the agency 
and to assess against the agency the coot and 
reasonable attorneys' fees of the complainant. 
In such cases the court shall determine the 
matter de novo and the burden shall be upon 
the agency to sustain its action by a prepon-
derance of the evidence. In the event of 
noncompliance with the court's order, the 
district court may punish the responsible 
officers for contempt. Except as to those 
causes which the court deems of greater im-
portance, proceedings before the district 
court as authorized by this subesction shall 
take precedence on the docket over all other 
causes and shall be assigned for hearing and 
trial at the earliest practicable date and ex-
pedited in every way. 
"(d) AGENCY Paocxxonms.?Every agency 
having more than one member shall keep a 
record of the final votes of each member in 
every agency proceeding and except to the 
extent required to protect the national de-
fense or foreign policy, such record shall be 
available for public inspection. 
"(e) LIMITATION or ExExtrriox.?Nothing 
in this section authorizes withholding of in-
formation or limiting the availability of rec-
ords to the public except as specifically stated 
In this section, nor shall this section be au-
thority to withhold information from Con-
gress. 
(f) PRIVATE PARTY.?AS used in this sec-
tion, 'private party' means any party other 
than an agency. 
"(g) ErrEcrrvz DATE.?This amendment 
shall become effective one year following the 
date of the enactment of this Act." 
Mr. LONG of Missouri. Mr. Presi-
dent, I move that the Senate reconsider 
the vote by which the bill was passed. 
Mr. HUMPHREY. I move to lay that 
motion on the table. 
The motion to lay on the table was 
agreed to.

SIONS OF Ttu.: SENATE AUGUST 5
