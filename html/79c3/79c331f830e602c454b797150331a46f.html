 VIETNAM
 South Vietnam's constituent assembly continues to
 undertake additional projects, but has so far avoided
 controversy with the government.   Military activity
 shifted to the coastal highlands of Binh Dinh Province.
 Government leaders are preparing for the Manila con-
 ference scheduled for late October.   Buddhist moderate
 Tam Chau has begun negotiating with the government
 without approval from the militants, raising the pos-
 sibility of a formal organizational split.   Hanoi,
 still balancing relations between Peking and Moscow,
 was unusually active in meetings with its Communist
 allies.
 ANNIVERSARY OF INDONESIAN COUP ATTEMPT
 The major feature of the occasion was the trial of
 President Sukarno's chief lieutenant,  former foreign
 minister Subandrio,  for his role in the abortive
 coup.   Student demands that Sukarno himself face trial
 seem to have exceeded army guidelines.
 NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS  IN PEKING
 All major pronouncements during the regime's 17th
 anniversary indicate continuing preoccupation with
 internal problems.   The absence of important foreign
 dignitaries provided new evidence of Peking's isolation.
 Europe
 EXCELLENT CROP PROSPECTS        FOR USSR AND EASTERN EUROPE
 This year's wheat crop in the USSR,  in excess of 65
 million metric tons, is above average and approaches
 the record set in 1964.   East European prospects are
 also generally good to excellent.

 WEST CONFRONTED BY POLISH-CZECH NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS OFFER
 Public offers by Poland and Czechoslovakia at last
 month's IAEA conference to place their nuclear fgacil-
 ities under IAEA inspection--provided West Germany
 does the same--have introduced a new element into the
 debate over nuclear safeguards.
 CONGO MUTINEERS STILL AT LARGE
 The approximately 2,500 Katangans who left Kisangani
 (Stanleyville)  are seeking negotiations that will per-
 mit their return home.
 NIGERIAN CRISIS DEEPENS
 Widespread violence in the North seems checked for the
 moment but might resume at any time.   The disorders may
 negate modest progress made in constitutional talks
 that adjourned on 3 October for three weeks.
 ALGERIA HIT BY SEVERE DROUGHT
 Summer grain harvests are less than half of normal,
 threatening a famine and a further depression of gen-
 eral economic conditions.

 VIETNAM
 The Constituent Assembly
 South Vietnam's Constituent
 Assembly continues to undertake
 projects in addition to drafting a
 constitution, but thus far has
 avoided controversy with the gov-
 ernment.                     In working sessions on
 30 September and 1 October, the as-
 sembly created a subcommittee to
 deal with flood relief in the delta
 region south of Saigon, and decided
 to send messages to various inter-
 national groups including the United
 Nations.   It also adopted a resolu-
 tion urging the government to re-
 lease political prisoners under de-
 tention, but left it to the govern-
 ment to decide who merited amnesty.
 In line with the assembly's con-
 stitution drafting function,  sub-
 committees have begun work on pro-
 cedural rules for the assembly and
 an examination of the credentials
 of its elected deputies.   Work on
 the constitution itself, however,
 will probably not begin for several
 weeks,  as subcommittees have only
 begun to draft procedure rules and
 examine the credentials of the
 elected deputies.
 Political maneuvering is con-
 tinuing among the assembly deputies
 and may intensify along regional
 lines as a result of a controversy
 within Premier Ky's cabinet this
 week.   Although the incident has
 apparently now been settled within
 the cabinet by the resignation of
 Health Secretary Nguyen Ba Kha,  it
 heightened long-standing regional
 antagonisms.   Several southern min-
 isters,  including the civilian dep-
 uty premier, held Kha responsible
 for the temporary arrest of a
 southern subcabinet official by
 police chief Loan, a northerner.
 Page   1
 This incident as well as another
 reported instance of heavy-handed-
 ness by a northern official, how-
 ever, are being discussed by
 southern assembly delegates and
 could heighten their suspicion of
 the northern-dominated military
 leadership.
 South Vietnam Military
 The scene of major fighting
 in South Vietnam during the past
 week shifted from northernmost
 Quang Tri Province to the Commu-
 nist-infested coastal highlands
 of central Binh Dinh Province.
 Elements of the US lst Air
 Cavalry Division engaged a possi-
 ble regimental-size Viet Cong/
 North Vietnamese Army force during
 the opening phase of Operation
 IRVING, a 15-battalion search-and-
 destroy ground sweep targeted
 against units of the Communist
 610th Division in the Phu Cat Moun-
 tain area of Binh Dinh Province.
 By week's end, the running battle
 that began on 1 October had re-
 sulted in enemy losses of 314
 killed,  191 captured, and 463 sus-
 pects apprehended, as against US
 casualties of nine killed and 52
 wounded.
 To the north,  six US Marine
 battalions continued to press
 their two-month-old offensive--
 Operation PRAIRIE--against the
 9,400-man North Vietnamese Army
 324B Division just south of the
 Demilitarized Zone  (DMZ)  separating
 North and South Vietnam.   Although
 no major engagements occurred, evi-
 dence continued to mount of an in-
 tensive enemy logistics,                                                                                    infiltra-
 tion, and troop buildup effort in
 Quang Tri Province.

 Several enemy documents re-
 cently captured in Quang Tri Prov-
 ince by US Marines have provided
 additional insight into the mission
 of North Vietnamese units in north-
 ernmost South Vietnam.   The docu-
 ments give the general impression
 that the 324B Division has two ma-
 jor objectives.   The first is to
 prepare an impenetrable defensive
 stronghold between the DMZ and
 Route 9.   The second is to take
 some limited offensive action south
 of Route 9, both to draw US forces
 outside of their fortifications and
 to try to "develop liberated areas
 and corridors."   The documents in-
 timated that a large body of as-
 yet-uncommitted North Vietnamese
 Army forces had secretly moved into
 the area.
 The Manila Conference
 Government leaders are pre-
 paring for the seven-nation con-
 ference scheduled to be held in
 Manila. late in October.   Of partic-
 ular concern to military leaders is
 the proposed discussion of a joint
 policy on a negotiated settlement.
 In recent public statements, Premier
 Ky and. Foreign Minister Do stressed
 that the inclusion of the Viet Cong
 as a separate party at negotiations
 is unacceptable, although Do indi-
 cated that they might be included
 as part of a North Vietnamese del-
 egation.   Premier Ky also told
 newsmen on 1 October that the 1954
 Geneva Accords were no longer use-
 ful as a basis for any settlement.
 Buddhist-Government Cooperation
 After making no progress
 since mid-September toward resolv-
 ing his difficulties with militant
 Buddhists, moderate Institute
 chairman Tam Chau has begun to ne-
 gotiate with the government with-
 out their approval. On 2 October,
 government officials publicly
 turned over to Tam Chau the Vien
 Hoa Dao pagoda,  the Institute's
 formal headquarters which had
 been under government supervision
 since duly.   Eleven Buddhist
 "struggle" prisoners were also re-
 leased in Chau's custody at the
 ceremony.   Militant Buddhists, who
 did not attend,  reacted by declar-
 ing that a scheduled national Bud-
 dhist congress--which was intended
 to patch up differ6nces between
 Institute leaders--would now be
 useless, raising once again the
 possibility of a formal organiza-
 tional split between militant and
 moderate Buddhists;
 Hanoi's Relations With Other
 CommunAts
 Hanoi was unu.Sually active
 this week in meetings with its Com-
 munist allies.   Featured in DRV
 propaganda were a joint communique
 with the CzechosloVakian Communist
 Party, the celebration of Chinese
 National Day,  the signing of a new
 aid agreement with 'the Soviets,  and
 the announcement that a delegation
 from the Bulgarian Communist Party
 would soon visit Hanoi.
 Throughout all the publicized
 activity, Hanoi reaffirmed its basic
 policy of balancing its relations
 between Peking and Moscow.   The com-
 munique with the Czechs was largely
 pro forma and uninformative, with
 Hanoi once again endorsing the So-
 viet-sponsored principle of bloc
 unity in aid to North Vietnam.   As
 a counterbalance,  almost the entire
 North Vietnamese leadership,  led
 by Ho Chi Minh, turned out on 30
 September for the Hanoi celebra-
 tions of Chinese National Day, and
 the DRV press gave the anniversary
 extensive coverage.! The signing of
 the new Soviet aid .pact pact on 3 Octo-
 ber was also well publicized and,
 although no details were given,
 Hanoi commented appreciatively on
 the nature and extent of the assist-
 ance.

 ANNIVERSARY OF INDONESIAN COUP ATTEMPT
 The focus in Djakarta this
 week has been on the trial of
 former foreign minister Suban-
 drio,  once President Sukarno's
 chief lieutenant.   Subandrio,
 who has been in prison since
 March,  appeared in court on 1 Oc-
 tober,   the anniversary of last
 year's abortive coup.
 His trial had been delayed
 partly to permit General Suharto
 and his civilian colleagues to
 structure their anti-Sukarno
 campaign and to build the polit-
 ical context in which they wished
 Subandrio to appear as the ac-
 cused.   Although the delay may
 have caused some loss in the
 trial's dramatic impact,  it has
 enabled the government to exploit
 Subandrio as a representative of
 misgovernment and not solely as
 another figure in the murder of
 the six generals last year.
 Students who had been dem-
 onstrating against Sukarno dur-
 ing most of the month of Septem-
 ber now have surfaced demands
 that he too face trial.   Their
 activity involved violence on at
 least one day,  and both their
 pace and their demands appear to
 have exceeded guidelines laid
 down for them by the army.   A
 series of conferences between
 army and student leaders seems to
 have achieved an understanding,
 at least for the time being,  that
 student activity will continue
 but on a considerably lower
 scale.
 The anniversary passed
 quietly in East and Central Java,
 where left-wing elements have re-
 sisted the anti-Sukarno campaign.
 The Subandrio trial is being
 given wide publicity in the hope
 that its revelations will reduce
 the President's still considerable
 prestige in these areas.
 In North Sumatra, currently
 the main center of anti-Chinese
 activity,  the anniversary also
 passed without incident.   A Chi-
 nese ship sent by Peking to Me-
 dan, North Sumatra,  has picked up
 about 1,000 of some 7,000 Chinese
 refugees gathered there.   Although
 it arrived on 21 September,  Indo-
 nesia had refused for security
 reasons to let the ship dock un-
 til 2 October or to allow the
 crew to go ashore.   Several Chi-
 nese officials, however, were per-
 mitted ashore to examine the refu-
 gees' documentation.
 Harassment of indigenous Chi-
 nese during the past year has been
 a by-product of Djakarta's anti-
 Peking foreign policy.   The pro-
 Peking policy espoused by Sukarno
 and Subandrio is another aspect
 of the former regime that is be-
 ing held up for severe censure in

 NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS IN PEKING
 All major pronouncements from
 Peking on the occasion of the re-
 gime's 17th anniversary indicate
 continuing preoccupation with the
 struggle within the Chinese lead-
 ership.   Only perfunctory atten-
 tion was given to foreign affairs
 and the economic picture.   Pro
 forma and unconvincing claims were
 made that the "situation abroad is
 excellent," that a "new all round
 leap forward is emerging" at home,
 and that the harvest is "good."
 The dominant theme of Lin
 Piao's keynote speech at the 1
 October review and of editorials
 in the major party journals was
 the continuing and apparently
 broadening drive against powerful
 but errant party officials.   The
 editorials stressed that the "cul-
 tural revolution" is aimed not
 only at outright enemies within
 the party who will be ruthlessly
 "crushed," but also at less cul-
 pable officials who will merely
 be criticized and presumably de-
 moted.   These latter officials
 are said to have a "very poor
 understanding" of Mao's cultural
 ideas,  to "fear" them,  and to
 resist them by "practicing fac-
 tionalism consciously or uncon-
 sciously."
 One senior official against
 whom such charges almost certainly
 are being made is Liu Shao-chi,
 Mao's former party deputy.   Al-
 though Liu appeared prominently
 as chief of state at the 1 Octo-
 ber review,  he has been publicly
 demoted from second to eighth
 place in the party structure.
 Other officials
 who may be in the same category
 are party general secretary Teng
 Hsiao-ping,  two regional bureau
 chiefs who probably owed their
 appointments tp Teng, and economic
 planner Po I-pb, who has past as-
 sociations with Teng.   All four
 reportedly have been criticized
 in wall posters displayed by Red
 Guard vigilantes in Peking.
 New Leadership Possibly Unsure
 The slow,  hesitant develop-
 ment of the drive against do-
 mestic opponents suggests that
 the new leadership is unsure and
 divided.   It is probable that Mao
 and his new team, an uneasy al-
 liance of disparate forces,  are
 unable to reach agreement on their
 goals, how to reach them, or who
 can be trusted.   The Peking press
 is claiming--probably with some
 truth--that the campaign is tak-
 ing so long because it is encoun-
 tering considerable resistance.
 The lackluster turnout of
 guests from abroad provided new
 evidence of the extent to which
 Peking has become isolated in the
 international; community.   There
 were no important foreign digni-
 taries present--from either Com-
 munist states!cr free world coun-
 tries.   In past. years,  the Chinese
 have been able to display at least
 one foreign chief of state.   This

 time the top-ranking guest was
 the president of the Somali na-
 tional assembly.
 Strains in Foreign Relations
 Increasing strain in rela-
 tions between Peking and the
 other Communist countries was
 pointed up during Lin Piao's
 speech.   Diplomats representing
 the USSR,  Bulgaria, East Germany,
 Hungary,  Czechoslovakia, Poland,
 and Mongolia walked out when he
 charged that the Soviet Union
 was "colluding" with the US to
 promote peace talks on Vietnam.
 This attack--the first time the
 Chinese have used National Day
 celebrations as a forum for ex-
 plicit anti-Soviet polemics--
 shows how far Peking's go-it-
 alone attitude toward the rest
 of the Communist world has de-
 veloped.
 There were no party-to-
 party greetings from Hungary,
 Poland,  Czechoslovakia,  and Bul-
 garia.                   Congratulatory messages
 from other Communist states were
 pro forma.   Only Hanoi even men-
 tioned the "cultural revolution,"
 which was the central theme of
 the celebration.
 Pronouncements on foreign
 policy indicated no change in
 the caution displayed during the
 past year.   Lin Piao and Chou
 En-lai again promised support
 for Vietnam in standard general-
 ities.   The People's Daily ac-
 count of the celebration, which
 summarized the main points of
 Lin's speech, did not mention
 Vietnam but noted only the the
 Chinese people "together with
 the revolutionary people of all
 countries" would carry on the
 struggle against the US  "to the
 end."   Chinese references to a
 possible confrontation with the
 US were cast in defensive terms
 --declaring that Peking's armed
 forces and people were ready if
 the US "imposed" war on China.
 Economic Aspects
 On economic issues, National
 Day pronouncements suggest that
 the main concern of the leader-
 ship has been to reduce the dis-
 ruptive effects of the "cultural
 revolution" on economic produc-
 tion.   Exaggerated or misleading
 claims were made in routine propa-
 ganda items on the eve of the
 holiday, but these were ignored
 in the more authoritative state-
 ments.   Peking's failure nine
 months after the nominal begin-
 ning of the third five-year plan
 to issue guidelines for the econ-
 omy suggests disagreement over
 objectives.   It also suggests
 awareness that the economy is not
 producing enough over current
 needs to back stepped-up economic
 growth.

 EXCELLENT CROP PROSPECTS FOR USSR AND EASTERN EUROPE
 The outlook for the 1966
 harvest in the USSR and Eastern
 Europe is excellent.   In the
 USSR, according to preliminary
 US estimates,  the harvest will
 approach the record set in 1964.
 This year's wheat crop in the
 USSR, which is already in, will
 be in excess of 65 million metric
 tons,  above average and well
 above last year.   East European
 prospects are also generally
 good and are excellent in the
 Balkans.
 The USSR had varied weather
 in the early spring.   However,
 abundant rainfall and increased
 use of mineral fertilizers in
 European USSR,  together with ex-
 cellent harvesting weather in the
 New Lands, combined to produce
 a well above average grain crop.
 Total East European breadgrain
 production is expected to be only
 slightly below the high level
 reached in 1965  (31 million
 metric tons),  and the output of
 coarse grains, especially corn,
 will exceed both 1965 and the re-
 cent annual average.
 In both the USSR and Eastern
 Europe,  sugar beets, potatoes,
 vegetables,  and sunflowers have
 done well.   Soviet cotton pro-
 duction, however, probably will
 be below the record established
 last year.   In Eastern Europe,
 the most outstanding improvement
 over 1965 is in the spring-
 planted crops of Czechoslovakia
 and the Balkans, with both Yugo-
 slavia and':Bulgaria predicting
 a record harvest for 1966.
 The favorable outlook for
 feed grainland roughage is prom-
 ising for livestock production
 at least through the first
 quarter of 1967.   In the USSR,
 state procurements of meat, milk,
 and eggs for the first eight
 months of 1966 have been well
 above those for the same period
 in 1965.
 The excellent Soviet wheat
 crop indicates that the USSR's
 contracts to import almost four
 million metric tons of wheat in
 the 1967 consumption year  (1
 July - 30 June)  are aimed at re-
 plenishing stocks and fulfill-
 ing part of its export commit-
 ments to Eastern Europe and
 Cuba.   East European grain-im-
 port requirements in the 1967
 consumption year are expected
 to fall several hundred thou-
 sand tons below the 8.5 to 9.0
 million metric tons imported
 in the 1966 consumption year.
 East Germany, Poland,  and Czech-
 oslovakia, however, will continue
 to be major importers.   Record
 harvests in Yugoslavia and Ru-
 mania may provide each with an
 exportable surplus of one million
 tons of corn.   Rumania and Bul-
 garia reportedly have offered
 a small quantity of wheat to
 free  world  countries.

 WEST CONFRONTED BY POLISH-CZECH NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS OFFER
 Public offers by Poland and
 Czechoslovakia during last month's
 conference in Vienna of the Inter-
 national Atomic Energy Agency
 (IAEA)  to place their nuclear fa-
 cilities under IAEA inspection--
 provided West Germany does the
 same--have introduced a new ele-
 ment into the debate over nuclear
 safeguards.   The offers,  endorsed
 by the Soviet delegation, were
 set in the context of European
 disarmament and were accompanied
 by reminders of Bonn's "nuclear
 pretensions."   A parallel offer
 by East Germany seems to have
 been merely another effort to
 gain international recognition,
 since it was conditioned on mem-
 bership in IAEA.
 Soviet bloc propaganda pur-
 poses would clearly be served
 if West Germany were to reject
 outright the East European initi-
 atives, and this may be a major
 motive behind them.   The bids
 nevertheless raise the possibil-
 ity of applying IAEA safeguards
 in East Europe and of challeng-
 ing Soviet intransigence on out-
 side inspectors.                 Soviet dis-
 pleasure reportedly   stifled
 tentative Polish and Czech in-
 terest last year in accepting
 IAEA safeguards, but the current
 offer was reportedly endorsed by
 Moscow at the Warsaw Pact confer-
 ence last July.   Indeed, Moro-
 khov, the Soviet member of the
 IAEA board, had told the US dele-
 gate that "each socialist coun-
 try would decide for itself
 whether facilities would be sub-
 mitted for safeguards."
 At the Vienna conference,
 some Western delegations were
 inclined to accept the East Euro-
 pean overtures at face value,
 viewing them as a possible break-
 through in both EURATOM and East
 European resistance to IAEA inspec-
 tion.   Although particularly skep-
 tical of East Germany's motives,
 Bonn apparently intends to retain
 some flexibility and has delayed
 replying, merely reminding the
 Poles and Czechs that German fa-
 cilities are already fully safe-
 guarded under EURATOM.
 Despite the EURATOM commis-
 sion's initially negative reac-
 tion, the whole issue will likely
 be intensively discussed by the
 six EURATOM countries.   Although
 the commission--largely under US
 urging--has not ruled out the
 ultimate objective of a single
 international safeguard system,
 both EURATOM and the US have
 taken the position that EURATOM
 inspection is equivalent to that
 of IAEA.   The French,  in particu-
 lar, have always opposed any IAEA
 intrusion into the EURATOM pro-
 gram.
 EURATOM thus is likely to
 find itself being pulled in dif-
 ferent directions.   The community,
 which may come under some inter-
 national pressure to respond posi-
 tively to the East European of-
 fers, might see some possibility
 of using this issue to gain of-
 ficial East European recognition
 for EURATOM.   On the other hand,
 EURATOM will have to consider
 whether acceptance of interna-
 tional safeguards would conflict
 with its own objectives of estab-
 lishing a truly supranational
 system among its own members.

 CONGO MUTINEERS STILL AT LARGE
 Approximately 2,500 mutinous
 Katangan soldiers who left Kisan-
 gani                        (Stanleyville) two weeks ago
 have moved to the Lubutu-Punia
 area en route to Katanga.   They
 have so far held their own against
 the government forces,  including
 mercenaries,  that have been sent
 to force their surrender.
 Although Mobutu would like
 to end this mutiny, which is ty-
 ing up a good part of the Congo-
 lese Army and virtually all of
 the mercenary forces, he is ap-
 prehensive lest the Katangans
 stir up other troubles if allowed
 to return home.   Nevertheless,  in
 spite of his repeated demands for
 their unconditional surrender,
 Mobutu has declared a cease-fire
 while the mercenary commanders
 try to arrange a settlement.
 Meanwhile, Mobutu continues
 his moves against suspected Euro-
 pean opponents.   On 5 October he
 announced his intention to close
 all consulates in the Congo and
 to break relations with Portugal.
 The break with Portugal apparently
 was designed to buttress his image
 SECRET
 as an African nationalist and to
 give emphasis to his charges in the
 UN Security Council that Lisbon was
 allowing his enemies to use Angola
 as a staging area.   By closing the
 consulates, he probably seeks to
 put further pressure on the Belgians,
 who have long been one of Mobutu's
 prime targets despite his dependence
 upon their aid.   Mobutu has told Am-
 bassador Godley that US consulates
 would be reopened upon application
 to the Congolese aovernment.

 NIGERIAN CRISIS DEEPENS
 Belated exercise of leader-
 ship by Northern authorities has
 checked for now large-scale mob
 violence against Easterners in
 parts of the North, but new dis-
 orders are likely to break out
 there or elsewhere as refugees
 are evacuated to their region of
 origin.   There is a danger that
 tribal violence, until now di-
 rected primarily at the hated Ibo
 tribesmen, will spill over into
 other tribal communities,  leading
 to a complete breakdown of law
 and order.
 A major factor in the dete-
 riorating security situation is
 the collapse of army discipline,
 especially in the units in the
 Northern region.   Last week
 Northern soldiers joined civilian
 mobs--and occasionally the po-
 lice---in hunting down, molesting,
 and killing Ibos.   By the time
 the authorities moved to restore
 order., probably more than 1,000
 Ibos had been killed,  and hundreds
 more injured.   Rumors of mass kill-
 ings  of  Northerners residing in
 the East apparently triggered the
 disorders, but hard-line Northern
 political elements may well have
 had a hand in stirring up the
 mobs.
 The Nigerian Government will
 probably need foreign help to re-
 store discipline among the North-
 ern troops.   The cadre of offi-
 cers is extremely thin,  and it-
 self contains mutinous elements.
 Last weekend, Hausa and Tiv sol-
 diers--both from the Northern re-
 gion--fought against each other.
 Both Supreme Commander Gowon and
 Northern military governor Katsina
 have hinted that they will request
 British and American troops,  as
 well as technicians.   London ap-
 pears willing to send a team of
 officers to find out what mili-
 tary assistance is needed but will
 not be put in a position where
 British troops might be forced to
 fire on Nigerians.
 Nearly all Easterners have
 now fled the North or are in the
 process of doing so.   The depar-
 ture of civil servants and public
 corporation employees--who were
 the last to go--has created se-
 vere staffing problems in essen-
 tial services and in private busi-
 nesses.   There is considerable
 fear among the expatriate commu-
 nity and among certain non-Ibo
 tribes that violence will turn
 against them once all the Ibos
 have left. No expatriates have
 been harmed so far,  but some Yoruba
 tribesmen from the West have been
 forced to flee.
 Several retaliatory attacks
 on Northerners resident in the
 Ibo-ruled Eastern region have
 strengthened the hand of Northern
 extremists who wish to invade the
 East.   Eastern military governor
 Ojukwu has ordered that all of
 the non-Easterners in his region
 be evacuated.

 talks, which adjourned on 3 Oc-

 had reached some agreement on the

 strongly opposed to any imposed

 ALGERIA HIT BY SEVERE DROUGHT
 A drought last winter has so
 reduced this summer's grain har-
 vests in Algeria as to threaten
 a famine and a further depression
 of general economic conditions.
 The Boumediene government is
 seeking to fill the gap with im-
 ports, but has limited resources
 with which to do this.
 The summer's harvest of
 wheat and barley, Algeria's two
 main cereal crops, was less than
 half of normal--an estimated
 800,000 to 900,000 tons, in con-
 trast to the 2.1-million-ton av-
 erage of the past four years. An-
 nual consumption has been running
 at about 2.3 million tons, with
 the difference between this and
 the fluctuating production fig-
 ures filled by imports, mainly
 from the US and France.   Even so,
 availability of grain on a per
 capita basis has been gradually
 declining.
 Algiers'  early bids for for-
 eign wheat in the current crop
 year have had but a limited re-
 sponse so far.                            The US has sold
 112,000 tons.   Of 200,000 tons
 requested from France by the end
 of 1966, Paris has sold only
 40,000 but is promising to review
 the situation by December.   The
 US Embassy in Paris reports that
 France has "allocated" a total of
 200,000 tons for cash sales to
 Algeria.   However, the French
 hope to avoid any long-term cred-
 its and that the US will provide
 most of Algeria's needs beyond
 what it can pay for in cash. The
 chances of any :Large-scale aid
 from France are reduced by the
 suspension of negotiations since
 last spring over financial
 claims and counterclaims,  and by
 Algeria's nat:Lonalization of
 French-owned mines.
 The grain crisis hits Al-
 geria at a time when its unfa-
 vorable balance of payments has
 gradually eroded hard-currency
 holdings to the point that they
 are now estimated at only $75
 to 100 million.   Algeria's ris-
 ing earnings from oil,  compris-
 ing over half of the value of
 its exports, have not mounted
 rapidly enough to offset the
 dwindling of French aid.
 A drought as serious as
 this year's affects both rural
 and urban areas.   Some 80 per-
 cent of A1ger:La's farmers are
 engaged in subsistence agricul-
 ture; rural fatn:ine tends to drive
 them into the cities, which are
 already jammed, with the unem-
 ployed and under-employed.   Low
 production on the modern,  for-
 merly French-owned, wheat-grow-
 ing farms cuts into the demands
 for services and supplies from
 the urban centers, and accentu-
 ates the difficulties.   So far
 there has been :Little active ex-
 pression of discontent, but sev-
 eral weeks ago'Boumediene in-
 stalled a competent technician
 with strong rural ties as his
 new minister of agriculture.

 UN FACING DIFFICULTIES OVER SOUTH-WEST AFRICA
 Forty-nine Afro-Asian mem-
 bers of the United Nations have
 tabled a resolution on South-West
 Africa which,  if passed by the
 General Assembly, will result in
 a head-on confrontation with the
 Republic of South Africa and its
 possible withdrawal from the UN.
 The resolution states that
 the General Assembly will take
 over the South African mandate
 and assume direct responsibility
 for administration of South-West
 Africa.   It calls for a UN ad-
 ministering authority to recom-
 mend to the next General Assembly
 a date for the territory's inde-
 pendence, and requests the Secu-
 rity Council to take the neces-
 sary measures to enable the ad-
 ministering authority to discharge
 its functions.
 Attempts by the West and
 moderate Africans to win support
 for a milder resolution have so
 far failed.   Liberia has a pro-
 posal that it is reluctant to
 table, doubting that it would get
 African support.   This proposal
 provides for certain steps lead-
 ing to the creation of a UN Com-
 mission for South-West Africa
 that would recommend to the as-
 sembly ways in which the UN could
 assert a presence in the terri-
 tory.   Another possibility is a
 request for an advisory opinion
 from the International Court.  How-
 ever, this would only be a hold-
 ing action.
 If the Afro-Asian resolution
 is passed,  the critical problem
 would be organizing measures
 for international enforcement.
 The General Assembly has no such
 powers and it would have to ask
 the Security Council to compel
 compliance.   It is doubtful that
 any measures short of the use of
 force would obtain South Afri-
 ca's compliance,  and a resolu-
 tion that could not be enforced
 would only produce greater frus-
 tration and anger among the Af-
 ricans.
 Britain finds itself in a
 difficult situation on this is-
 sue.   It wants to avoid a row
 with the Africans but, because
 of the Rhodesian problem and
 its own economic difficulties,
 it also wants to avoid a con-
 frontation with South Africa.
 The UK will probably abstain on
 the resolution.   France prob-
 ably will also abstain because
 of concern about enforcement
 measures and because of its
 trade with South Africa.   The
 USSR will probably vote with
 the Africans but is arguing
 that rather than UN administra-
 tion of the mandate, a strictly
 African one would be preferable.
 Despite the lack of support
 from the major powers and the
 legal and constitutional prob-
 lems it raises, the Afro-Asian
 resolution seems well on the way
 toward passage.   The sponsors
 are likely to pick up some Com-
 munist votes as well as some ad-
 ditional support from other
 Afro-Asians and possibly from
 among the Latin Americans.

 COMMUNIST ACTIVITY IN URUGUAYAN LABOR
 The Uruguayan Government
 acted vigorously on 4 October to
 try to halt the latest round of
 Communist-inspired labor agita-
 tion.   The National Council of
 Government voted 7 to 2 to expel
 four Soviet officials in Monte-
 video whom it accused of inter-
 fering in Uruguayan labor affairs.
 The action was based on the Coun-
 cil's belief that the Communist
 Party of Uruguay  (PCU)  cannot af-
 ford to continue leading strikes,
 which it has been sponsoring
 mainly for political purposes,
 if the USSR suffers consequent
 expulsion of its diplomatic of-
 ficers.   However, by expelling
 the four Soviets simultaneously,
 the government may actually have
 reduced its leverage on the PCU.
 Furthermore, the PCU probably
 feels sure that unless Uruguay
 breaks relations with all the
 Communist bloc countries--which
 is unlikely--the party will con-
 tinue to receive the necessary
 financial and propaganda support
 to maintain its political and
 labor activities.
 The PCU position in labor
 is exceptionally strong at pres-
 ent.   Party leaders,  supported
 by leftist trade unionists,  ful-
 filled a long-time goal on 2 Oc-
 tober by establishing a nation-
 wide labor confederation.   They
 united the unions of the Commu-
 nist-dominated Uruguayan Workers'
 Central with those of the Commu-
 nist-created National Workers'
 Convention  (CNT),  retaining the
 latter's name.   The new CNT en-
 compasses much of organized labor
 and can claim with considerable
 authority to speak for the coun-
 try's workers.
 Astute PCU exploitation of
 soaring living costs, declining
 real wages, and unpopular as-
 pects of various constitutional
 reform proposals has induced
 unions previously unresponsive
 to the Communists to affiliate
 with the new CNT.   Party spade-
 work in the interior also paid
 off in the affiliation of sev-
 eral rural cooperatives and
 unions.   Other independent
 unions are expected to join as
 the new organization proves its
 leadership ability.
 The PCU has demonstrated
 its capacity for disrupting
 Uruguayan economic life on is-
 sues that are more political
 than economic.   Its latest ma-
 jor effort,  a general strike on
 15 September,  nearly paralyzed
 the country,  and a subsequent
 series of strikes and stoppages
 has caused widespread incon-
 venience and interrupted public
 services in Montevideo.
 The PCU expects to convert
 labor support into votes in the
 27 November general elections.
 It believes that the government
 will be reluctant to use repres-
 sive measures against workers
 with elections so near, but never-
 theless hopes to provoke the au-
 thorities into creating a few
 martyrs,  F_                         I

 BRAZIL ELECTS COSTA E S I LVA PRESIDENT
 Retired Marshal Arthur da
 Costa e Silva, the only candi-
 date, was elected president by
 the Brazilian Congress on 3
 October, his 64th birthday.   Only
 one opposition congressman ignored
 his party's decision to boycott
 the indirect election.
 Costa e Silva will take
 office on 15 March 1967 for a
 four-year term as successor to
 President Castello Branco.   He
 will not, however,  assume most
 of the extraordinary powers granted
 to Castello Branco by the 1964
 revolution that ousted leftist
 COSTA E SILVA
 New President-Elect
 of Brazil
 The long interim prior
 to Costa e Silva's inaugura-
 tion has led to speculation
 that the date would be moved
 up.    However, he has pointed
 out that the period is none
 too long for him to form a
 government and establish
 policies.   Furthermore, he
 intends to campaign until 15
 November for progovernment
 congressional candidates,  and
 also expects to spend part
 of the time before 15 March
 in travel abroad, possibly
 including a trip to the US.

 president  Goulart. These powers--
 including the right to dismiss
 elected officials and deprive
 them of their political rights--
 expire on 15 March, although
 many of  the  basic principles of
 the revolution are expected to
 be codified :Ln a new constitu-
 tion that Castello Branco hopes
 to have enacted by Congress be-
 fore March..
 In a speech following his
 election, Costa e Silva reiter-
 ated his desire to return Brazil
 to fully democratic processes.
 He also stressed his preoc-
 cupation with alleviating
 oppressive social and eco-
 nomic conditions,  saying
 that the nation's greatest
 problems center on "the ne-
 cessities of man."

 THE SITUATION I N GUATEMALA
 Guerrilla leader Luis
 Turcios was killed this week
 in an automobile accident.
 On 3 October,  the Communist
 Party's action arm,  the FAR,
 announced that Cesar Montes
 would replace Turcios as its
 commander.   Montes, a 24-
 year-old former law student
 who served as Turcios'  dep-
 uty, is believed to be a
 member of the Communist
 Party  (PGT) and ideologi-
 cally more disciplined than
 Turcios.   If so,  the party's
 control over its guerrilla
 wing now may be enhanced.
 Turcios had insisted on
 maintaining the separate
 identity of the FAR.
 The FAR is disciplined
 and well organized.   Al-
 though the change of leader-
 ship may initially cause
 some  disorientation, it  is          64092
 not likely to have a sub-
 stantial effect on the organiza-
 tion's ability to carry on guer-
 rilla activity.

 UNEXPLAINED BOMBINGS I N COSTA RICA
 A series of ten bombings
 in and around San Jose between
 14 and 30 September has created
 alarm among public security of-
 ficials in Costa Rica.   The au-
 thorities have no clues to the
 identity of the perpetrators.
 Damage has been slight and no
 injuries have resulted.
 The latest incidents in-
 clude detonation of a small bomb
 at the base of an electric trans-
 mission tower north of the capi-
 tal on the evening of 29 Septem-
 ber and two more bombings the
 next night, one of which was the
 first in a residential area.
 The public has taken the inci-
 dents calmly so far, but concern
 is certain to mount if the bomb-
 ings continue, especially if
 there are deaths or injuries.
 Costa Rican officials have tended
 to accuse the Communist Popular
 Vanguard Party  (PVP).   A policy
 of terrorism would be uncharac-
 teristic of the present PVP
 leadership, but the incidents
 might be an independent effort
 by militant Communists within
 the PVP or from another country.
 The sophistication of the bomb-
 ing devices and the planning in-
 herent in each case lend weight
 to a theory that the incidents
 were carried  out by persons
 trained in demolition techniques.
