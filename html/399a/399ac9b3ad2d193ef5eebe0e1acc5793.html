 This study grew out of an inquiry into the origin,
 nature, and seriousness of the crisis in the International
 Communist Movement (ICM) which bxoke into the open
 after the "secret speech"' denigrating Stalin, delivered
 by Khrushchev at the 20th Soviet Party Congress in
 February 1956,  Certain aspects of tHs crisis are clearly
 recognizable:  it is in its general nature both ideological
 and organizational (or political); and its chief instigators
 and supporters are creative writers and intellectuals,
 Party ideologists and theoreticians, youths and students,
 and national patriots.  These two aspects of the ICM
 crisis were clearly observable in the demonstrations of
 unrest within the whole Sino-.Soviet bloc, in the ever
 bolder demands by Bloc regimes and by Communist
 parties for greater latitude of thought and action, and
 in the outright rebellion of certain Communist parties,
 factional groups, individual party leaders, and front
 organizations.  The following factors pertaining to the
 crisis are less obvious, however, or have been entirely
 unnoticed:  its severity and probable duration, the
 indispensability of the affected individuals for the smooth
 functioning of the ICM machinery, and the relationship
 of the forces behind the crisis to those organizations,
 movements, groups, and individuals )utside the ICM
 Additional insight into the crisis was provided by
 the November 1957 meeting of top ICM leaders assembled
 in Moscow to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the
 October Revolution.  This meeting was devoted to an

 analysis of the ICM crisis and to the formulation of
 general procedures and specific methods of combatting
 it.  The results of the analysis and the formula for
 solving the crisis were incorporated in the widely-
 publicized Twelve-Party Declaration.  The Declaration
 contains two points which have a direct: bearing on the
 subject of this study.  First, the Declaration labels the
 force underlying the crisis as "Revisionism", defines it,
 and designates it as the "chief danger".  Secondly, the
 Declaration calls for an obligatory ICM-wide crusade
 against "Revisionism" and announces a. decision to found
 an official ICM journal, subsequently named Problems
 of Peace and Socialism, charged with a "paramount
 duty to fight against all expressions of bourgeois ideology
 and first of all against revisionism. "
 The ICM definition of "Revisionism" identifies it
 as violation of the established, basic Marxist-Leninist
 principles.  Revisionists are alleged to violate three
 basic principles.   These are:  (1) recognition of the
 existence of antagonistic class struggle which can be
 resolved only by establishing a dictatorship of the
 proletariat; (2) insistence on the leading role of the
 Party, which can be implemented only by organizing the
 Party in accordance with democratic centralism; and
 (3) avowal of international workers' solidarity (or
 proletarian internationalism) by accepting the leading
 role of the Soviet Union.  On the surface this analysis
 appears to reflect a reasonable view o:: the phenomenon of
 "Revisionism", for the "Revisionists" do in fact hold
 different views regarding these three principles.  The
 Communist record in dealing with dissidence and in-
 subordination is itself a sufficient warning, however,
 against acceptance at face value of even the most

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 plausible-sounding declarations, slogans, and definitions.
 Therefore, it is safe to assume that the real objective of
 the Twelve-Party Declaration is not to clarify the phe-
 nomenon of "Revisionism" objectively but to define and
 present it in such a way as to discredit it.
 A closer examination of the Twelve-Party definition
 of "Revisionism" discloses that it rests on deceptive
 premises.  One such premise is that "established basic
 Marxist-Leninist principles" actually exist.  It may
 rightly be asked who decided which principles are "basic"
 to Marxism-Leninism and by what authority they were
 so "established"; the only apparent answer is that the
 Soviets did so on their own unilateral authority.  "Re-
 visionism" accepts all three of the "basic" and "estab-
 lished" principles as such but offers different explanations
 of their meaning and applicability.  Thus the somewhat
 camouflaged chief premise on which the Twelve-Party-
 definition rests is that the Soviets possess a special and
 exclusive authority, not only to specify which principles
 are "basic" and "e stablished" but also to proclaim how
 these principles are to be interpreted and applied in "the
 only correct" manner; the implication is that any other
 interpretation or application of these principles is
 automatically wrong and :illegitimate,  The Twelve-Party
 definition, resting on such deceptive premises, must be
 rejected if we do not wish to become victims of Soviet
 propaganda and if we do not want to contribute to the
 spreading of the pernicious notion that our potential allies,
 the "Revisionists", are despicable, Lllegitimate Marxist-
 Leninists.
 What, then, would be an acceptable working definition
 of "Revisionism"?  Though hidden, it is implied in the

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 premises on which the Twelve-Party definition is
 based:  "Revisionism" is a challenge to and/or a
 rejection of the claimed special Soviet authority in
 the ICM to provide the sole "scientific" philosophy, the
 only "basic" principles, the only "true" interpretation
 of these principles, the only "correct" method of their
 application, and the only "creative development" of
 Marxism-Leninism in its philosophy, methodology, and
 action.  This conclusion can be reached also by a dif-
 ferent line of reasoning which is presented in paragraph
 II-A-1, below,
 Further, it may be safely assumed that the past and
 present reaction to this aggressive and imperialistic Soviet
 concept will continue to exist and sporadically to break
 out into the open as long as the claim to a privileged
 position within the ICM is pressed by the Soviets.  "Re-
 visionism", which arose as a reaction to Soviet Communist
 dogmatism and "orthodoxy",* will no doubt persist and be
 combatted, although not necessarily under the same label.
 The study is divided into two parts.  Discussed in
 Part I are the origin, development, and use of the label
 The term "orthodox" Communist is used throughout
 this study in the sense of a doctrinaire Party member
 who believes in Communist unity of action on the
 international level, a unity which can be achieved
 only when there is a recognized, single, authoritative
 ICM policy-making center, Moscow.  The term
 "orthodox" is quite synonymous with the terms
 "Bolshevik", "Cominternist", "Corninformist".

 "Revisionism" as a means of "orthodox" Communist
 political attack.  Particular attention is given in this
 section to the methods used by the CPSU and "orthodox"
 Communists in their efforts to establish that "Revisionism"
 is a violation of Marxism-Leni.nisrn rather than a chal-
 lenge to their authority,?  Part II is devoted generally
 to the essence of "Revisionism" from the standpoint of
 the "Revisionists" and to the views of "Revisionists'"'
 as contrasted with those of "orthodox" Communists.
 Various Soviet propaganda myths are exposed, and a
 special subsection is devoted to Soviet use of other
 labels in relation to the current main epithet of "Re-
 visionism".  What the "Revisionist s" call their scientific
 approach to or guideline for interpreting and applying
 the principles of Marxism-Leninism is contrasted with
 the dogmatic approach of the CPSU.  Finally, various
 Communist ideological principles, the respective "Re-
 visionist" and orthodox Communist views, are discussed
 in some detail; and a summation ii made of the strengths
 and weaknesses of "Revisionism",
 The suggestion that there: be L long-range and
 systematic approach to the question of "Revisionism"
 is based on the following observations.
 a,    It has existed under various labels throughout
 the whole history of the ICM and has alienated
 a sizable faction of Marxists and their erstwhile
 sympathizers from the ICM.
 b.    It has been. an important factor in the upheavals
 in the Communist bloc since World War II, up-
 heavals which exposed both the aggressiveness and
 the inhumanity of the Soviet Communist system.

 c.   It is presently considered by the CPSU and
 other "orthodox" Communists to be the chief
 danger and has a clearly indicated potential
 for continued existence and, possibly, growth.
 d.   It is, objectively speaking, a real danger
 to the Soviet-controlled ICM because it is, in
 effect, the outward manifestation of the ever-
 present internal contradictions in the Com-
 munist system- -contradictions between theory
 and practice.
 e.   It contains all the chief philosophical and
 ideological principles on which all trends of
 internal resistance to Soviet-dominated Com-
 munism are based.
 f.   It is one of the more potent ideological
 weapons available to the non-Communist world
 for undermining Soviet control of the ICM and
 therefore deserves to be encouraged and sustained.
 The indications for the continued existence and, possibly,
 growth of "Revisionism" and, therefore, the continued
 existence of the general problem of dissidence within the
 ICM, derive from the following general considerations.
 First, the Sino-Soviet bloc by its own
 testimony is now rapidly concluding the "con-
 struction of Socialism"--the first stage on the
 road to total Communization- -and has entered
 in some areas the phase of "transition to

 An examination of the use of the term Revisionistr

 labeled Revisionists are not only devc id of original ideas
 but are in the same category as evw:!- oer s and traitors.*
 This linking of Revisionism with other derogatory terms
 to denounce opponents is done not openly but under the
 guise and in the name of scierice,  sufposedly in defen:,e
 of "Scientific Socialism",.
 A.        Origin of the Term
 The term Revisioni.srn was a neologism
 coined by the French hi stor cal writer Pierre.

 Deviation", "National Communism", "Opportunism",
 "Reformism", "Social Dernocratism", "Anarchism",
 "Anarcho-Syndicalism", "Liberal Bourgeois
 Syndicalism", "LigUidationisrn' , and "Treason to
 Socialism".

 it to describe those political speakers, writers,
 and activists whose chief or even sole occupation
 had been to revise the French Constitution not,
 in Tenot's opinion, for the purpose of improving
 it or introducing new ideas, but for the sole
 purpose of presenting a different text.  The
 term Revisionism entered the Socialist-Com-
 munist vocabulary for the first time at a
 congress of the Social Democratic Party of
 Germany held at Stuttgart from 3 to 8 October 1898.
 Eduard Bernstein, the editor of the Party's news-
 paper, presented his views on. Socialism in a
 paper read by Bebel, one of the Party's founders.
 These views were opposed to the dogmatic
 analysis and interpretation of social and economic
 developments on the basis of simple quotations
 from Marx.  Bernstein pointed out that actual
 developments in England and Germany had taken
 different courses from those prophesied in
 Marx's Communist Manifesto.  He charged that the
 self-declared followers and students of Marx
 closed their eyes to new facts and new develop-
 ments, that they occupied themselves to the
 exclusion of all else with "revolutionary phrase-
 ology", and that they continued to uphold re-
 ligiously Marx's "theory of catastrophe" befalling
 the capitalist system despite new data which
 tended to disprove the validity of this thesis.
 Regard for the recently deceased Marx was so
 great among the congress delegates that
 Bernstein's views calling for a:i adjustment of
 Marx's theses to fit new facts met with wild
 outbursts of criticism and name-calling.  The
 epithet most frequently used was Revisionist,

 and debate of the Bernstein paper ended in a
 formal resolution condernni.ag Revisionism.
 A resolution was also proposed for Bernstein's
 expulsion from the Party or grounds that he
 was weakening the member >' faith in Socialism.
 However, Karl Kaut.sky, one of Bernstein's
 influential critics, defended him, stating
 that those whose faith in So :ialism could be
 weakened so easily should get out of the Party
 for the good of the Party.  In conclusion
 Kautsky thanked Bernstein for his paper,
 saying, "Bernstein did not lead us away from
 the correct path, but forced us to think, and
 for this we should be grate`'ul to him. "
 Subsequently, one of the most fanatical
 followers of Marx, G. Plekhanov, wrote an
 open letter to Kautsky which was published
 in three installments in the Saechsische
 Arbeiterzeitung, Numbers 253-255, during
 the period 30 October - 3 November 1898.
 Plekhanov called Bernstein interchangeably
 an Opportunist and a Revisionist and criticized
 Kautsky for his expression of left-handed
 "gratefulness" to Bernstein.  Plekhanov main-
 tained that thanks could have been expressed
 to Bernstein only if he had brought out something
 new.  Bernstein, according to Plekhanov, was
 merely trying to present as new that which had
 been or was being taught by bourgeois

 writers.*  He particularly condemned Bernstein's
 works, ** pointing out that if Bernstein's Re-
 visionist views and program were accepted, there
 would be no reason for the existence of a highly-
 disciplined militant party pressing for revolution
 and no need for revolution itself.
 '    Two such writers were Schulze-Gae-vernitz /Zum.
 Sozialen Frieden (Toward Social PeaLce), Leipzig,
 1890, Der Grossbetrieb ein wirtschaftlicher and
 sozialer Fortschritt (The Big Enterprise, an Economic
 and Social Progress), Leipzig, 1892,x; and Paul-Leroy
 Beaulieu (Distribution of Wealth and Tendencies Toward
 Social Equalization, Paris, 1881).
 Particularly Bernstein's article, "Der Kampf der
 Sozialdemokratie and die Revolution der Ge sellsc:haft."
 published in Die Neue Zeit, No. 16-113, 1898.  In this
 article Bernstein announced one of his famous Socialist
 slogans, "The Movement is Everything, the Goal-
 Nothing,"  This slogan was later elaborated on in a
 book called Die Voraussetzungen des Sozialismus und.
 die Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie (The Prerequisites
 of Socialism and the Tasks of Social Democracy),
 Stuttgart, 1899.  Also condemned was a book entitled
 Social Democratic Struggle and Social Revolution.
 In the book Bernstein denounced the preoccupation of
 the Marxists with the final beautiful goal of Socialism-
 Communism at the expense of fighting, for attainable
 "practical-political" gains for the workers.

 B.          Lenin's "Orthodox" Definition of Revisionism
 In an article entitled "Marxism and Re-
 visionism, "* published in 1908, Lenin sought
 to give an authoritative "orthodox" dissertation
 on Revisionism.  Accepting the line on Re-
 visionism taken by Plekhanov in 1898, Lenin
 largely reiterated and expanded upon Plekhanovts
 "Open Letter" to Bernstein.  Plekhanov himself,
 however, was later denounced as an Opportunist
 and, by implication, a Revisj.onist.**  Lenin's
 method of attacking Revi.sion..sm was to present
 himself as an interpreter of Marx and at the
 same time an authoritative law-giver--the
 latter aspect being carefully hidden in his dis-
 sertation.  His stated objective was to defend
 Scientific or Marxist Socialism and to disprove
 Revisionism scientifically.  However, Lenin's
 argumentation began with a simple, unsupported
 assertion that Revisionism was a trend alien and
 hostile to the "established" basic principles of
 "Scientific Socialism".  Noteworthy in this
 assertion is Lenin's postulation of "established"
 basic principles, but nothing is said as to how

 lishers), pp. 71-79.

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 and by whom these principles were established.
 Moreover, these "established" principles, unlike
 scientific principles generally, are somehow
 exempt from continuous scient:fic testing.  Lenin
 thus shifts from his stated scientific investigation
 of Revisionism to a dogmatic condemnation of
 it for being contrary to Marxian principles which
 Lenin transmutes to doctrines.
 Having implied that Revisionism is scientifically
 incorrect, Lenin then passed to a condemnation
 of it as evil.  Actually, Lenin had no other choice
 than subjective and emotional rejection of Re-
 visionism; for if Marxism-Leninism is a science,
 then its theses, like those of other sciences,
 must be subject to continuous testing and revision
 in accordance with new facts.  Revisionism, in
 the sense of revising for the purpose of improve-
 ment, would thus have to be commended, not
 condemned.
 In turning Marx's basic pri.nciples or tentative
 "scientific" theses into doctrines which were to
 be accepted largely on faith, Lenin effected the
 transition casually and surreptitiously.  For
 example, as stated by Lenin:     "Revisionism did
 really try to revise the foundation of Marxism,
 namely, the doctrine of the cla:;s struggle."  To
 be noted in this quotation is the claim that the
 concept of the class struggle is no longer a
 scientific thesis subject to continuing verification
 but a firmly-established doctrine, and that Lenin
 is interested in gaining converts to his own line
 of reasoning and beliefs rather than in presenting

 evidence that such reasoning and beliefs rest
 on logic and have been reached scientifically.
 Thus Lenin was able to convince some
 gullible and ultraradical Socialists that there
 was no discrepancy between the concept of
 Communism as "Scientific Socialism" and that
 of Communism as consisting of a set of firm
 established doctrines not  ubject to scientific
 examination.
 C.   Stalin's Interpretation of Revisionism
 Plekhanov in 1898 and Lenin in 1908 had
 prepared the ground for Stalin's definition of both
 Revisionism and true "Scientific Socialism".
 Stalin proceeded from the ;)osition that, if Lenin
 could convert Marx' tentat ve theses into
 doctrines, he, Stalin, could go one step further
 ("creatively developing Marxism") and make
 of them untouchable and sacred dogmas.  Simi-
 larly, if Lenin could popularize the term Re-
 visionism as meaning a violation of basic
 doctrines, he, Stalin, could extend its meaning
 to cover violat:ions of all irportant theses,
 doctrines, and dogmas.  Stalin was not content
 to apply the Revisionist label only to actual
 violations of basic and important doctrines;
 he extended it to cover inclination toward
 violation, as interpreted by himself.  Whereas
 Lenin as a rule distinguished between Revisionism
 and other lesser or greater so-called deviations
 to the right, Stalin lumped all existing terms
 for right deviation together with Revisionism.

 Moreover, Stalin extended the Revisionist label
 to cover so-called deviations in any other
 direction or any disagreement with him and.
 applied labels then new to Corr..munisni, such
 as "Enemy of the People" and "Anti-Party
 Group".  For example, disagreement: with
 Stalin's pronouncement on the aesthetic value
 of the Russian language was termed Revisionism.
 D.   Current Orthodox Interpretation of Revisionism

 was officially launched in November 1.957,
 numerous articles on Revisionism have appeared

 Some of the articles examined are:  (1) Soviet:  "The

 Lenin, they find Revisionism to be evil on the
 basis of doctrine established by their own authority
 and then condemn those who disagree with them
 as Revisionists or violators o.: Marxism-Leninism
 itself.  Like Lenin, they conceal their claim to be
 the sole true authority on Marxism-Leninism.
 For example, they carefully avoid any statement
 about who determined that the doctrine or "science"*
 on which Revisionism was founded is basically
 evil.  However, unlike the 1908 era, when Lenints
 authority in the international Socialist movement
 depended upon his eminence as a theoretician,
 orthodox interpreters today represent the views
 of the CPSU; and these views are backed by the
 power and authority of the Soviet State.  In
 attempting to mask this background of power and
 to condemn those who disagree with them as Re-
 visionists or violators of Marxism-Leninism,
 orthodox interpreters resort to several Leninist
 techniques.  The three most important of these
 The closest the orthodox Communists come to
 admitting that Communism today is not a science but
 a body of dogma is found in a reference to Communism
 as an "infallible theory" and a "flawless philosophy".

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 techniques are discussed in some detail in the
 following paragraphs.
 1. Purposeful Misdirection,  This
 technique calls for the diversion of a
 reader's or listener's attention from the
 essence of the subject. which is under
 discussion.  In denouncing certain theories
 as un-Marxist, and therefore incorrect,
 Lenin and his successors carefully lead the
 reader away from what is really at stake.
 They present the view that certain theories,
 theses, and tenets can have only "one
 correct interpretation".  Yet they care-
 fully avoid showing that the claim to one
 correct interpretation means that there
 can be only one correct and true interpreter:
 Lenin and, subsequently, the Soviet Com-
 munist Party.  Those who disagree with
 the CPSU as to the meaning of Marxism-
 Leninism are cited as holding not merely
 different views but incorrect and un-
 Marxist-Leninist views.  They are
 characterized not as dissidents or non-
 conformists who question only the Soviet
 interpretation of Marxism-Leninism, but
 as Deviationists and Revisionists.  In de-
 nouncing Revisionism, the Soviets picture
 the concept of Marxism-Leninism as having
 life of its own,  something like Schopenhauerts
 "the-thing-in-itself":  i. e. , some mysterious
 force which is definite, potent, and persistent,
 although unrelated to either the human body or
 the human intellect.    Thus, the Soviets would

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 have the world believe not that Marxism-
 Leninism is and means what the Soviets
 make it but that in some mysterious way
 it is what it is.  They would have people
 believe that Marxism-Leninism is not being
 interpreted by them in the way that suits their
 interest but that through some mysterious
 powers granted only to them they can see
 Marxism-Leninism as it is, i.e., "Marxism-
 Leninism-in-itself".  The very choice of the
 word Revisionism in describing the indepen-
 dent, rebellious, and nonconformist interpre-
 tation of Marxism-Leninism is calculated to
 mislead, to direct attention toward "Marxism-
 Leninism-in-itself" and away from the concealed
 CPSU claim that it alone can determine what is
 and what is not true Marxism-Leninism.  Should
 this deliberate Soviet misdirection be accepted,
 one would also have to accept the Soviet proposition
 that Revisionists are persona who violate an
 established law which, like a. law of nature, is
 operative regardless of any human factor and
 which any realistic man has -to recognize and
 accept unconditionally.  Denial of the Soviet-
 defined Marxist-Leninist truth is, according to
 this proposition, as devastat:.ng as the non-
 acceptance of the nutritive value of food or the
 nonrecognition of the poisonous nature of cyanide.
 The Revisionist Tito is thus pictured as a person
 who refuses to eat wholesome Marxist-Leninist
 food, who subsists on bourgeois poison, and
 whose doom is therefore sealed.
 The technique of misdirection is also evident
 in the orthodox Communist practice of fighting

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 every kind of opposition on the ideological
 level although in reality the opposition arises
 out of economic problems, political interests,
 or organizational matters.  Slapping the Re-
 visionist (i. e. , ideological) label on opposition
 arising out of matters wh:.ch have nothing to
 do with ideology effectively leads the observer
 away from that which the Soviet Union (and/or
 China) would not dare to feature publicly (the
 self-interest of the Soviet Union as a world
 power) and toward that which the Soviet Union
 can proudly espouse:  unselfish and noble
 defense of Socialist science, dialectical truth,
 world peace, universal progress.  A good.
 example of this technique is the Soviet propa-
 ganda treatment of the U. S. economic aid
 program for Yugoslavia.  Clearly it would not
 do for the Soviets to announce their real
 reason for opposition:  the fact that this aid
 does not serve the interest of the Soviet state
 because it makes Yugoslavia economically
 independent of the Soviet Union.  Presenting
 this aid, instead, as one point of evidence
 designed to demonstrate that the Yugoslav
 Communists put an incorrect and Revisionist
 interpretation on basic Marxist-Leninist
 principles (in this case on the principle of
 international solidarity of Socialist forces)
 allows the Soviets to denounce Yugoslavia
 and its acceptance of U. S? aid with the
 voice of an unselfish defender of the purity
 of Marxism-Leninism and transforms the
 independent-minded Yugoslavia into an
 erring and deformed Socialist country.

 2. Use of Broad Terms in Denouncing
 Revisionism.  In order tc denounce and
 discredit an undesirable trend, such as
 Revisionism, Communists always brand
 it as a violation of a much broader concept
 containing this trend.  Thus, although Re-
 visionists may question only certain orthodox
 interpretations of Marxism-Leninism, they
 are pictured as violating the whole of
 Marxism-Leninism:  the Marxist-Leninist
 world view, Marxist-Leninist methodology,
 Marxist-Leninist scientific theses, tenta-
 tive tenets, set doctrines, sacred dogmas,
 and the practical application of these theses,
 tenets, doctrines, and dogmas.  The Com-
 munist technique in condemning Revisionism
 is to operate within the broadest possible
 meaning of a concept and then to shift subtly
 from one aspect of this concept to another.
 For example, although in one place in an
 anti-Revisionist article Marxism-Leninism
 is pictured as Scientific Socialism, in
 another part of the same article the term
 'Marxism-Leninism' suddenly acquires an
 entirely different meaning.  It no longer
 stands for scientific theses but for crystallized
 doctrines which are not subject to re-examination
 or modification on the strength of new facts.
 This tactic is particularly evident in Lenints
 1908 article "Marxism and Revisionism".
 Lenin speaks in one place of Marxism which
 "struggled with theories which were funda-
 mentally hostile to it"; in another place of
 Marxism which "is already absolutely
 22

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 victorious over all other ideologies in
 the labor movement"; and in still another
 place of Marxism the f :)undation of whi ch
 is "the doctrine of the class struggle"
 Thus, in the se three irstances Marxism
 is referred to as a scientific theory
 (tentative in nature Rana subject to either
 partial or total re jectiun should new data
 require it), as a political ideology (firmly
 adhered to but. put aside, usually tempo-
 rarily, whenever different political goals
 are decided upon), and as a firm dogma
 (a sacred and untoucha)le basis on which
 rests the ultimate justification of the whole
 Communist cause).  It can therefore be
 readily seen how a term conceived so
 broadly and containing such contradictions
 can be manipulated in ~.rgumentation with
 those who, reasoning more logically, are
 unable to integrate the various contradictory
 meanings cf the te. rni i ito a unified intelligible
 whole,
 3.   Guilt by Association.  In order to
 attack and to discredit 3 person as a foul
 Revisionist,, the orthodox often conduct. a
 secret examination of his possible connection
 with selected persons, either dead or
 old and discredited.  Ocice some connection
 (not necessarily relevait to the case) is
 uncovered between the oerson singled out for

 the denunciation and a given number of
 already discredited or defenseless persons,
 the latter are openly charged with sponsoring
 Revisionism.  At this stage "scientific" and
 overt examination is made to "discover"
 who is at present the exponent of views once
 held by the discredited individuals.  A
 dramatic exposure of connecting lines from
 these discredited persons to the target is
 then made.  It is obvious and only natural
 (to the orthodox Communist) that the target,
 who is connected with not one but several
 Revisionist-minded persons, must himself
 be a Revisionist, and that therefore whatever
 he stands for and whatever he writes and says
 must be branded as Revisionism.  The method,
 makes it possible to brand a person as a
 Revisionist without even examining his writings.
 E.   Current Use of the Revisionist Label
 A review of representative orthodox Communist
 articles on Revisionism indicates that Khrushchev
 and the orthodox ideologists (with the exception of
 the Chinese Stalinists) do not use the term Re-
 visionism quite as indiscriminately as Stalin did.
 Generally a formal and Lenin-like distinction is
 made by the current CPSU leaders between Re-
 visionism and other labels for so-called deviations
 to the right.  The more important labels covering such
 so-called deviations to the right can be arrayed on
 a gradated scale according to the degree of dis-
 pleasure which the CPSU desires to indicate re-
 garding the individual disagreeing with its view.

 labels for so-called right c.eviations.  In a book
 entitled V. I. Lenin AgainE.t Revisionism, which
 was reviewed in the 1.4 April 1958 issue of
 Pravda, the reviewer lists under the heading of
 Revisionism all the usual -o-called right de-
 viations and includes even Anarcho-Syndicalism,
 which is not normally so designated.

 THE ESSENCE OF REVISIONISM AND
 CHAR ACTERISTICS OF REVISIONISTS
 A.    The Essential Characteristic of Revisionism
 1.   There is one ever-pre sent, common factor
 in the whole Revisionist trend:  rebellion against
 authoritarian dictation by a single center, most
 specifically the CPSU and the Soviet State.  (The
 frequently repeated thesis that  he Chinese CP
 and Mao Tse-tung are becornin? the ideological
 leaders in the ICM is as of the late of this study
 still a speculation.  Pres+_nt.ly the Chinese Communists
 still emphasize publicly tho leading role of the Soviet
 CP and of the Soviet: goveruirnent.)  In accordance with
 this observation, Rcevisio u srn i s in its essence
 a challenge of the privileged Soviet State and
 Soviet Party authority with n and over the 1CM.
 This is one of several views on the essence of
 Revisionism and on trends clos ly allied to it, views
 which are valid and acceptable.  The above view can,
 for instance, be acceptably expressed in positive terms.
 It would then read more or less as follows:  Revisionism
 is a conscious and firm demand for actual equality
 of each member party within th ~ ICM regarding the
 interpretation and applicati_on o!' Marxism-Leninism.

 2.  Several significant points should be noted
 in connection with the above identification of
 Revisionism.
 First, neither the whole body of the "Marxist-
 Leninist doctrine" nor its most important "basic
 principles" are the central or even ;significant issue
 in the orthodox Communist struggle against Revisionism.
 This observation is true despite the orthodox claim
 that the only reason Revisionism is denounced is
 that it violates these doctrines and Principles.  For
 if we distinguish between Revisionists and outright
 Communist apostates (i. e. , defectors), Revisionists
 in a body accept Marxism-Leninism and its chief
 theses as their philosophy; indeed, the main
 Revisionist charge against orthodoxyr is that it is
 Another acceptable view of Revisionism notes that in
 its essence Revisionism has to do wit:i discipline, that
 it is an insubordination (on the international level) with
 respect to the arrogated authority of the CPSU and
 (on the national level) with respect to the excessive
 and arbitrary authority of Party leaders, central organs
 of the Party, lower organs, cell leaders.  Still other
 viewpoints disclose that Revisionism is (1) a fight for
 more freedom within the ICM and within national parties,
 (2) a stress on the democratic concept; of the principle
 of "democratic centralism", or (3) an insistence that
 true "international workers' solidarity" (or true "pro-
 letarian internationalism") can be attained only among
 equals who are free to express and to apply their own
 views and their own ideas.

 orthodoxy itself which violates Marxism-Leninism
 and its meaning and "true sp rit".  It is evident that
 any number of "basic principles" may be ascribed to
 the term Marxism-Leninism, like such other
 abstract concepts as Socialism or Democracy.  Such
 "basic principles" are subjec t to a great many defini-
 tions and interpretations and to countless ways and
 means of practical application.  Lenin and his succes-
 sors have been attempting, however, for more than
 half a century to sell the world the notion that (1)
 Marxism-Leninism is uniquely definite, (2) that
 it consists of a specific nurnl~er of basic principles,
 and (3) that these principles have only one correct
 interpretation and application.  Actually, as noted
 briefly in Part I, this argum~:nt provides a pretext
 for the Soviets to claim that Marxism-Leninism can
 mean only what they say it means, that its basic prin-
 ciples are only what they say they are, and that only
 the CPSU can correctly interpret and apply these
 basic principles.
 Acceptance of the Soviet viewpoint on the essence
 of the orthodox-Revisionist controversy is fairly gen-
 eral even in the n.on-Communist world and stems
 apparently from the efficacy of orthodox Communist
 propaganda.  Another factor is that whereas the dissi-
 dent Communists are subjected to massive orthodox
 propaganda branding then-1 as Revisionists, they usually
 are not given any substantial assistance by non-
 Communists in maintaining their position vis-a-vis
 the orthodox Communists.  There may be two reasons
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 for the general non-Communist aversion to assisting
 the Revisionists.  First, Revisionists are still Com-
 munists, and the general trend in the West is to attack
 Communism in its entirety (including As Revisionist
 manifestations).   Secondly, there is an inclination
 on the part of some non-Communist students of Com-
 munism to accept the orthodox definition of ideological
 deviations.  This attitude appears to rest on the view
 that since such deviations are Communist, only the
 orthodox Communists can tell us what they really
 mean.
 Revisionists,' although accepting the broad concept
 of Marxism-Leninism and the general basic principles,
 attempt to interpret and apply Marxism-Leninism in
 their own way.  Because they incline toward independent
 thinking, their view of Marxism-Leninism may be
 different from the Soviet interpretation and application,
 although it does not necessarily have t:) be different,
 nor need it differ in all points.
 Secondly, Revisionism does not question the right
 of the Soviets to their own interpretation and appli-
 cation of the "socialist science".  What Revisionism
 challenges is the Soviet insistence upon exclusive
 right to interpret and apply Marxism-Leninism
 It should be understood by the reader that in writing
 "Revisionists accept..." and "Revisionists state...
 the accepted literary use of a general term is intended;
 such expressions do not necessarily refer to all Revi-
 sionists, but to many, or some, for the most part.

 correctly for the whole ICM,  T!ie Revisionist Challenge
 to the Soviet authority is not an aggressive act; it
 is a simple insistence that. all persons and all pa:-ties
 in the ICM should be truly equal; it is a denial of the
 proposition that the Soviet Party is "more equal"
 than other  Communist parties; it is a rebellion
 against the Soviet demand that the Soviet Party and the
 Soviet State be granted a "leading role" or the r:.ght
 to discipline those in the ICM who do not follow the
 Soviet lead.
 Thirdly, Revisionists view the ICM as a fraternal
 association of equal. parties bond by common basic
 ideological principles and doctrines, wherein each
 party is free to apply these principles as it see,, fits
 They reject the Soviet view that the 1CM must be an
 organized and highly disciplined political, economic,
 paramilitary, and conspiratorial force in which the
 Soviets play the "leading / i o e o   controlling/ rol,,".
 From the Revisionist viewpoint, acceptance of this
 Soviet concept is tantamount tc. recognizing that the
 ICM is an International Communist Party with the
 CPSU as its Central Committee and the Soviet First
 Secretary as its Secretary General, and that the CPSU,
 as the general staff of the ICM, is entitled to discipline
 any Communist "soldier", start campaigns, conclude
 treaties with the enemy -- all in its own right and on
 its own responsibility.  Revisionism does not even
 attempt to revise this vie'cv, but simply rejects it on
 the grounds that it is a Stalinist deformation of
 Marxism-Leninism.
 Fourthly, as previously noted, there is little
 practical (operati.onal) differ( nce between Revisionism
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 and other derogatory terms applied by the CPSU and
 orthodox Communists to those who challenge their
 interpretation of Marxism-Leninism.  In declaring
 Revisionism to be evil and a violation of Marxism-
 Leninism, the CPSU and supporting orthodox Commu-
 nists are in effect asking acceptance of this view on
 faith.  They subsequently present their declaration as
 an established principle, and Comrunists who disagree
 with the Soviet interpretation of Marxism-Leninism
 are characterized as Revisionists.  It follows that,
 because those who disagree are Revisionists and
 Revisionists are evil, the CPSU must exclude them
 from the congregation of believers, as was done,
 for instance, with the Communist Party of Yugoslavia
 in 1948, when it was declared to be "outside the family
 of the fraternal Communist Parties. "*
 Finally, the Soviet-propagated and generally-held
 view (even among non-Communists) that Revisionism.
 of necessity attacks Marxism-Leninism must be rejected
 unequivocally.  The record of Tito serves to illustrate
 this point.  Tito affirms Marxism-Leninism and rejects
 none of its basic principles as such.  He certainly
 does not reject the two basic control principles, namely
 democratic centralism and dictatorship of the prole-
 tariat, which Soviet and pro-Soviet propaganda single
 out as the most important.  The expulsion of Djilas

 from the LCY and his subsequent jailing, as well as
 the overwhelming evidence that the Party-controlled
 Yugoslav state will not tolerate any organized political
 opposition to its authority, attest to Tito's belief in
 and application of these two basic principles,  Yet
 Tito was denounced by the Soviets in 1959, as in
 1948, for practicing "out-and-out Revisionism'".
 B.   Orthodox Struggle A ainst Revisionism Under Other
 Labels
 Although "Revisionism" i5 currently the main
 epithet hurled by the CPSU and orthodox Communists
 at any Communist challenging the privileged Soviet
 authority in the 1CM, other labels may be used to
 indicate the degree of Soviet displeasure over a dis-
 senting view or activity and also to fit the specific
 circumstances in which the dissent took place.  There
 is an almost inexhaustible number of variant labels
 which have been. used once or which may be invented.
 But except for those already listed, these variants
 appear to be short-lived or only rarely used.  Examples
 of these ephemeral labels are ""Khvostism" (or "tailism")
 used during the Stalin era bit not now, and "populism",
 used in Hungary and at times in Czechoslovakia but
 seemingly not anywhere else.
 How the Soviets use five of the most common labels
 and relate them to Revisionism is here set forth.
 1.  Revisionism Fought under the Label of
 Opportunism..  These two labels have been used
 interchangeably ever since the term Revisionism
 was introduced sixty years ago.  Plekhanov, Lenin,

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 and Stalin -- and the CPSU in the 1957 "Twelve-
 Party Declaration" - - stated that the main danger
 was Revisionism, which was equated to Right-Wing
 Opportunism.* In Kommunist No. 18 of 1957,
 CPSU spokesman D. Shevlyagin in an article
 entitled "The Struggle of the Fraternal Communist
 Parties Against Opportunism" again equates
 Revisionism with Rightist Opportunism.  Soviet
 usage of the two terms does, however, indicate
 a slight semantic nuance.  A Revisionist challenges
 Soviet ideological and political authority on grounds
 that the Soviets do not take into account new facts
 in regard to the social, political, and economic
 developments in the world (both in the Sino-Soviet
 bloc and in the West) which have been brought
 to light after Marx' and Lenin's death.  An
 Opportunist, on the other hand, challenges Soviet
 political authority on grounds that it continue s
 to point to the distant final blessings of perfected
 Communism and neglects to utilize the present
 opportunity for immediate improve::nent of the lot
 of the workers.
 See Plekhanov's "Open Letter" to Kautsky
 of 1898; Lenin's article of 1908 on Marxism and
 Revisionism; Stalin's article of 1938 on philosoph-
 ical and economic Revisionism contained in History
 of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Short
 Course , pp. 126-127; and the "Twelve-Party
 Declaration" as published in Pravda on 22 November
 1957.

 2.   Revisionism Focht under the Label
 of Reformism or Social Derr cratism.  The
 struggle against Revisionism within the Sino-
 Soviet bloc is also synonymous with the struggle
 against Reformism, or SociiJ Democratisrn.
 A challenger of Soviet autho~?ity in the ICM in
 his role as a critic of the blLaak realities under the
 dictatorship of the prol~.tariit is called a Revisionist.
 As soon as he begins to point out possible methods
 of improving the situation, iie would be more cor-
 rectly labelled a Reformist or a Social. Dernocratist,
 Because all responsible critics also offer a pos-
 itive program for improving the situation, probably
 even in the same speech or in the same article,
 a Revisionist is at the sam  time also a Reformist.
 Under the existing situation in the Bloc, Revi-
 sionist critics often are not afforded an oppor-
 tunity to come out with a positive program and,
 therefore, never "graduate" to the title of
 Reformists.
 Outside the Bloc the term Reformist is used
 more frequently than within the Bloc. Non-Bloc
 CP's are not inclined to criticize the Soviet system
 but, in efforts to gain sup:)ort, often call for reform
 of the capitalist system,   e. , measures which
 would improve the lot of the worker.  However,
 propagation of a reform program within a non-
 Communist-controlled system, originally conceived
 as desirable for tactical reasons,rra.y over a
 longer period of time tend to become the main
 and the sole objective of such a CP.  Such an
 attitude is Reformism and is denounced by the
 Soviets under this label.  During the present period

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 of massive propaganda against Revisionism,
 however, a Reformist tendency in the West may
 still be fought under the general label of Revi-
 sionism.
 3.   Revisionism Fought under the Label of
 National Deviation or National Communism.  The
 challenge to Soviet authority may at times arise
 because the patriotic concern of a Communist for
 his own nation and its culture causes him to object
 to Soviet dictation and to the arbitrary transplanting
 of all features of the Soviet system to his country
 Such an individual is denounced by the CPSU as
 a National Deviation st or National Communist.
 But a National Deviationist would naturally be
 simultaneously a Revisionist in his criticism of
 the Soviet and Soviet-sponsored system and a
 Reformist and Opportunist in the positive program.
 with which he proposes to displace the system
 patterned on the Soviet model.
 4.   Revisionism Fought under the Label of
 Anarchism, Anarcho-Syndicalism, or Liberal
 Bourgeois Anarchism.  Whenever the challenge to
 The term National Communism is rarely used
 by the Communists; it was coined nct by them but
 in anti-Communist circles.  Whenever Communists
 use this term, they always put it in quotes in order
 to indicate that it is a label. Communism is
 supposed to be an international concept by its very
 nature; Communism is supposed to solve all
 national questions, to eliminate nationalism.

 Soviet authority involves a critical (Revisionist)
 appraisal of Soviet policy for using the trade unions
 only as transmission belts for Party orders,
 rather than giving; them real --conomie and political
 power, the challenger is denounced generally as
 an Anarchist, or more specifically as an Anarcho-
 Syndicalist.  If the challenger calls for increasing
 worker participation in the administration of the
 nationalized economy at the expense of the Party
 organs or if he insists that tie trade union,
 rather than the Party, is the chief instrument
 for introducing or building socialism, he is again
 generally labeled an Anarcho-Syndicalist or a
 Liberal Bourgeois Anarchist.  However, during a
 period of massive propaganda against Revisionism,
 such as the present, the over-all label for such a
 trend is Revisionism..
 5.   Circumstances in which Revisionism is
 Fought under the Label of Either Simple Deviation
 or Liquidationism and Treason-to-Socialism.  Nor-
 mally neither simple Deviation nor its extreme
 forms -- Liquidationism and Treason-to-Socialism --
 are used interchangeably with Revisionism.  How-
 ever, during a particularly bitter campaign against
 Revisionism, all niceties of distinction between it
 and the very mild and very indirect challenge to
 the Soviets -- Deviation -- are lost.  The danger
 of deviation is equated with Deviationism, Deviationism
 becomes a trend toward Revisionism, and finally
 a trend toward Revisionism. becomes Revisionism
 itself.  Similarly, Revisionism is equated with the
 danger of Liqui_dationism, and finally with Treason-
 to Socialism.  At other tirr:es - - for instance between

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 1955 and October 1956 -- great effort is made to
 differentiate between a simpl-a misguided and
 misinformed Deviationist and the conscious, stub-
 born, and arrogant Revisionist.  Similarly, under
 normal circumstances, a Revisionist usually is
 not charged with total repudiation of the value and
 achievements of Marxism- Le:rinism (Liquidationism)
 or with a conscious betrayal of the Socialist cause
 (Treason-to-Socialism).
 C.        Revisionist versus Orthodox Interpretation of Marxist-
 Leninist Ideology.
 The difference between the Revisionist ideological
 position and the orthodox interpretation of Marxist-
 Leninist ideology stems from a different concept of
 the essence of "Socialism" and from a different
 general approach to the interpretation of Marxism-
 Leninism.
 1.   The Orthodox or Soviet Approach to Inter-
 preting Marxism-Leninism.  The orthodox or Soviet
 guide-line to the interpretation of each specific
 Marxist-Leninist tenet and to the application of
 each tenet to current problems rests on a principle
 which has not been designated ;specifically as a
 Marxi-st-Leninist principle -- the "leading role of
 the Soviet Union".  In accordance with this principle
 a.   there must be only one correct inter-
 pretation and application of basic Marxist-
 Leninist tenets, and that can be true only if
 there is only one center, the CPSU and the USSR;

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 b.   interpretations differing froni those
 made by the Soviets are incorrect because they
 cause disunity in the ICM and in the S:no-
 Soviet bloc, undermine the strength and inter-
 national authority of the Soviet Union which
 is the political-economical-military bastion
 of the IC.M, and witti igly or unwittingly give
 aid or comfort to the ICM (and Soviet) enemy.
 It follows that. to be today a "correct"' and non-
 Revisionist Marxist a Communist must not only
 subscribe to those Marxi.,t-Leninist doctrines
 which are generally accel.ted as "basic principles"*
 but must first. accept the `italinist principle of the
 leading role of the CPSU** or, more correctly, of
 the head of the CPSU--a principle which Stalin's
 post-mortem denigration aid not destroy o:-
 Such as primacy of matter, pr.macy of the economic
 base; existence of an antagoni-tic class struggle which
 demands the setting up of the cictatorship of the pro-
 letariat for the suppression of the "enemies of Socialism"
 and for provision of central economic planning; adoption
 of the organizational principle of democratic centralism
 which alone can enable the Party to establish and to
 maintain the dictatorship of the, proletariat.
 Pravda of 1 October 1958 in discussing the value of
 Stalin's doctrinal contribution Ln his Short History of
 the CPSU states, "Only those z~re true proletarian
 internationalists... who unconditionally uphold and
 defend the USSR...."

 weaken.'  It is a principle unknown to either
 Marx or Lenin, and it is not only challenged but
 totally rejected by Revisionists.  The leader-
 ship of Marx and Lenin was of an entirely dif-
 ferent nature from that of Stalin or of the current
 ICM leaders.  They were satisfied with their
 de facto status and, unlike Stalin and his suc-
 cessors, did not demand for themselves a de 'ure
 recognition--a demand clearly made in the
 Twelve-Party Declaration.  Also, in exercising
 their leadership they relied on qualities other
 than the physical and economic power available
 to rulers of a country.
 2.   The Revisionist Guiding Principles for
 Interpreting Marxism-Leninism.  The Revisionist
 guiding principles in the interpretation of Marxism-
 Leninism, on the other hand, de-emphasize the
 The Twelve-Party Declaration of November 1957, the
 objective of which was to separate "true" Marxist-
 Leninists from the Revisionists, demands of all
 Marxist-Leninist parties the "banning of factions and
 groups sapping unite" of the "Socialist Camp", which
 is "headed /and led/by the Soviet Union".  Such Marxist.-
 Leninist parties are obligated to "support the Soviet
 Union" and to combat Revisionism as the "main danger"
 to the ICM (Pravda, 22 November 1957).     The 21st
 CPSU Congress--in its secret proceedings--modified
 this position only to the extent that overt references
 to.the leading role of the Soviet party government are
 to be omitted in Communist literature, apparently in
 order to neutralize anti-Communist propaganda.

 mechanics of b,rildirg Socialism and stress its
 goals.  The Preoccu.;_)ation and infatuation of the
 Revisionists with no ale Socialist goals is,
 however, so all - ernc)mpassing and so passionate
 that it exposes them to the possibly justifiable
 charge of pretentiou yness, self-righteousness,
 and utopianism.  Re-nsionism does, however,
 show at least some genuine concern for man,
 the builder and i'utur ~ occupant of the Socialist
 edifice.  Therefore, in the common Revisionist
 opinion, -s any specific Marxist-Leninist tenet is
 to be interpreted so Chat the Socialism which
 alone is wortii fighti.rg for should be:
 a?  creative and scientific, i, e? a
 Socialism subject to such modifications as
 new data demand, a Socialism wh:ch can
 also be a guide fox a rational explanation of
 new data;
 It should be clearly under st )od that any positive
 evaluation of Revisionist positions here is measured
 not against the generally -accepted non-Communist
 standards but against the standard of Communist
 orthodoxy.  If Revisionism i s stated, for instance,
 to be "democrat.:Lc", it means that it appears so only
 against the background of th,~ orthodox totalitarianism.
 And in our acceptance of the Revisionist claim to
 "scientific" attitude we grant only that the Revisionists
 are just a bit less dogmatic than the orthodox and that
 they have at least some scientific inclinations in the
 field of sociology.  This ace ~ptance does not mean,
 however, that we recognize Revisionist sociology as a
 genuine science.

 individual and as a member of his own  _
 family, his own culture and his own nation/
 the ultimate in justice, in social and economic
 equality, and a steadily increasing measure
 of political freedom;
 c,  peaceful and fraternal, i. e. , a
 Socialism actively engaged in the elimination
 of the causes of war and in the promotion of
 principles in international relations which
 are conducive to a peaceful solution of all
 problems arising between individual nations;
 and,
 d. real and realizable, i. e, , a Socialism
 not limited to declarations,  slogans, and
 promises of long-range benefits.
 It should be noted in regard to the above
 beautiful objectives describing the Revisionist
 concept of Socialism that Revisionist practice, like
 orthodox practice, will not always correspond
 to theory, and never completely.  Thus, Revisionist
 Tito allows little science in the LCY ideology and
 little real democracy in his Socialist State; the
 reality and realizability of the LCY program out-
 lined at the 7th Congress is also debatable.  The
 Trotskyite's lack of particular concern for
 humanism or for world peace is quite evident.

 The RevisionistsI cL,i.n-m to the above noble-sounding
 principles is less part of their ideological creed
 than a sloganistic eepre sion of their human
 qualities, their aspi r. ati:)ns, and wishful thinking.
 It is evident that, g..ven the two different gen-
 eral attitudes toward Marxism-Leninism, con-
 flicting inte1Tretations cf many of the Marxist-
 Leninist tenets result, as well as different views
 as to how these tenets should be applied.  But, from
 an unbiased point of view, there is no reason to
 consider eitl-.er the orthodox or the Revisionist
 interpretation as a greater revision of Marxism-
 Leninism than the other?  Each is from the view-
 point of logic or historical fact as much or as
 little entitled to call itself Marxist-Leninist, and
 each can produce an equal number of quotations
 from Marx and Lenin to prove that it alone repre-
 sents "true" Marxism-Leninism and that the other
 is Revisionist,  An .bjective view would probably
 allow the Revisionist claim that their attitude
 toward Marxist Socialisri (and, by extension,
 toward Marxism-Leninism) is closer to the
 original position of Marx and Engels and that the
 orthodox Communist view of Socialism and of
 Marxism-Leninism is closer to Stalin's outlook,

 zationally-minded doctrinaire Communists?

 "scientific" lines and for individual freedom
 in interpreting the Marxist-Leninist. tenets.
 The only semi-integrated current Revisionist
 views are those of Trotskyites, * Titoists, and
 Gomulkaites.  From these views and from
 the views of more important past and present
 Although Trotskyism is included here among Right
 Deviationist and Revisionist trends, this concept
 holds true only in regard to Trotskyism as it has
 developed since the Cominform expulsion of Tito.
 Prior to that time Trotsky himself and the Trotskyites
 generally vehemently insisted--probably with some
 justification--that they were part of the "left opposition"
 to Stalinism (cf., for example, The History of American
 Trotskyism by James P. Cannon, New York, Pioneer
 Publishers, 1944),  Examination of the current
 Trotskyite literature particularly of the 4th International,
 and specifically of its assessment of the Titoist program
 adopted by the 7th Congress of the League of Com-
 munists of Yugoslavia (4th International, Amsterdam,
 Spring 1958) shows that today's Trotsky:.tes fall into
 the general category of right Revisionists.  For the
 reason stated above Trotsky himself is however not
 listed as an established Revisionist authority.

 Revisionists, such as Bernstein, Kautsky,
 Milleran.d, Bukharir, Djilas, Kolakowski, Nagy,
 Lukacs, Harich, Giolitti, Levy, E. P. Thompson,
 Sartre, Lefebvre, Barata, Clark, and Fast, it
 is possible to arrive at a composite picture of
 what Revisionism stands for generally.
 In viewing Revisionism (which can be brought
 out only in juxtaposilaon with the orthodox beliefs
 and programs) care must be taken not to ascribe
 absolute values to the Revisionist views.  The
 apparent Revisionist freshness of outlook and
 its inclination toward scientific, liberal, and
 democratic concepts are not fresh, scientific,
 liberal, or democr.ar:ic in the absolute sense;
 they appear thus only in comparison with the
 dogmatic, narrow, and non- democratic concepts,
 attitudes,, and practices of the Communist
 orthodoxy shaped by Stalin.
 The Revisionist attitude toward some of the
 more important Socialist-Communist topics is
 as follows.
 a. Over-all Marxist-Leninist Ideology,
 Revisionists insist that Marxism-Leninism
 must be a sc iencE ("Scientific Socialism"),
 and therefore insist that the tenets, theses
 or principles of Marxism-Leninism cannot
 be allowed to harden with time into rigid
 doctrines and untouchable dogmas.  As a
 a living science Marxism-Leninism has
 to continue to be developed creatively--or
 revised--with all its tenets subject: to

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 adjustment, modification, or even abandon-
 ment if new facts and developments require
 it.  An example is Marx's theory concerning
 the progressive pauperization of the workers.
 This theory has been proved by statistics
 derived from later developments to be in-
 correct and should, therefore, be discarded.
 Revisionists believe that such an abandon-
 ment not only does not violate Marxism but
 is in accordance with a sound and scientific
 Marxist attitude.
 The Soviets and all orthodox Communists
 also subscribe to the creative development
 and adjustment of Communist tenets to "life".
 Their practical attitude, however, gives the
 lie to this formal claim.  Moreover, the
 orthodox claim is effectively caxicel.ed by the
 contradictory current assertion that Marxism-
 Leninism is an "infallible theory" and a
 "flawless philosophy."
 b. International Workers, Solidari  .
 Revisionists observe that solidarity cannot
 be demanded or enforced.  It must be based
 on the principle of a voluntary feeling of unity,
 the voluntary recognition of a community of
 interests, and the actual practice of equality
 of all ICM members.  International workerst
 solidarity attained through force and domi-
 nation by one strong member (the Soviet
 Union) is an un-Socialist practice and smacks
 of great-power chauvinism and imperialism.
 The essence of international workers' solidarity
 46
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 consists of the extension of aid and assistance
 by a stronger anc. richer member to the
 smaller and less developed fraternal nations
 (or parties).  Solidarity does not require
 uniformity or conformity.  Non-Soviet Socialist
 systems need not, and indeed should not,
 slavishly pattern themselves on the Soviet
 model.  Rather Socialist forms and practices
 should be develof ed to fit the local conditions
 resulting from each country's particular
 cultural and histc.;rical background.
 c. Methods and Forms of Building Socialism.
 Revisionists assert that there are many methods
 and forms of building Socialism.  In countries
 where there is no democratic tradition and
 democratic freed)ms are almost totally sup-
 pressed, Revisio lists accept the thesis that
 without a violent revolution Socialism cannot
 start to develop.  The minimum objective of
 such a revolution must be twofold--elimination
 of foreign domination and the introduction of
 a generally democratic type of government.
 However, the subsequent building of Socialism
 should go hand-in-hand with the ever-expanding
 collective rights ~)f the workers, which should
 be passed down from the central administrative
 levels to lower echelons and. finally to the
 individual worker-citizen.
 Revisionists a ?e inclined to believe that
 countries with a c emocratic tradition build
 some Socialism even in the absence of either
 Communist or Socialist parties.  It is built,
 47

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 even if slowly, because only Socialist
 solutions can satisfactorily and permanently
 solve problems arising in the modern, over-
 populated, and atom-threatened world.  The
 instruments of Socialism in countries without
 Socialist or Communist parties are the labor
 unions and the increasingly centralized state.
 The state in many capitalist countries no
 longer represents only the class interests of
 the bourgeoisie; it is coming to represent
 more and more impartially the interests of
 all its citizens.  No foreign power and no
 foreign organization or association should
 interfere with the native forms of Socialism
 developing in these countries.  The only
 proper Socialist form and the only correct
 road to Socialism in each country is the
 form evolved and the road taken by the most
 democratic and progressive indigenous
 forces.  The more divergent Socialist forms
 there are in the world, the richer will be
 the content of international Socialism.  Uni-
 formity is thus neither needed nor desirable.
 d. Nationalization and Socialism.  Re-
 visionists emphasize that, although nationali-
 zation of the main means of production and
 of the chief natural resources is necessary,
 nationalization does not automatically intro-
 duce Socialism.  Nationalization may only
 encourage Socialism and is, at best, only
 the lowest form of the socialization process.
 Nationalization, when viewed as a final goal
 of Socialism, leads to the development of
 48

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 Statism rather than Socialism, both in
 capitalist countries and in countries under
 the dictatorship of the proletariat.  In fact,
 in Socialist countries where nationalization
 is considered to be the end product of
 Socialism, the dictatorship of the proletariat
 itself degenerates into a dictatorship of
 bureaucracy.  There is in such countries
 a good chance that a new powerful class--the
 bureaucrats--will arise aLnd exploit the
 workers as mercilessly aas they were ex-
 ploited under classical (19th century)
 capitalism.  Nationalization, therefore, must
 lead to socialization, i. e., the introduction of
 Socialist relations.  It siaould be noted, however,
 that these Socialist relations have not been
 specifically identified by any known Revisionist
 beyond the appraisal of Them as good and
 desirable.  They are to be based somehow on
 each worker's concern both for the welfare of
 all other workers and for the welfare of society
 as a whole. Entirely unstated is the method
 of inducing such a feeli,ag in each individual
 worker and the motivating force which is to
 generate the development of the necessary and
 desirable "Socialist consciousness".
 e. Contemporary World Situation.  Re-
 visionists maintain that the present division of
 the world into two geographically identifiable
 exclusive and antagonistic power blocs is not
 only not conducive to world peace but will
 inevitably result in World War III.  Relations
 between capitalist and socialist countries should
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 be governed by the principle of "peaceful,
 active coexistence, "* In accordance with
 this principle both blocs should be de-
 nounced for endangering peace and economic
 and social progress.  "True lovers of peace,"
 "true Socialists, " and "true Marxist-Leninists"
 must not join either of the blocs.  However;,
 as long as these blocs exist, it is better to
 have them balanced and thus in a sense
 neutralized.  Thus, both the Warsaw and the
 NATO pacts should be liquidated, but it is
 dangerous to liquidate only one of them or
 to weaken one of them at the expense of the
 other.  The two main forces in the world,
 Socialism and Capitalism, are not distinguishable
 solely as two existing power blocs but are
 present in various forms throughout the world.
 It should be noted that this principle of
 "peaceful, active coexistence, " particularly
 widely publicized by Titoist Yugoslavia, is
 a Revisionist extension of the Leninist-
 Stalinist principle of "peaceful coexistence.
 This Titoist principle of active and straightforward
 effort on the part of every Communist, Socialist,
 Liberal and Progressive is to be distinguished from its
 Stalinist counterpart, "peaceful coexistence".  The
 latter is only an empty slogan which supports the Soviet-
 controlled tool of Soviet State policy, the World Peace
 Movement, and other maneuvers aiming at "peaceful"
 penetration of the non-Communist world.

 The latter principLf rc~as designed to tije
 the Soviet onion during its period of  rr-
 circlement by a hostile world a breathing
 spell and a chance to -onsolidate the Partyls
 power within the country and the new state's
 power on the internat onal arena.  Having
 found this slogan useful in concealing the
 aggressive nature of Communism, Stalin and
 his successors continued to use it as an
 ideological foundation for the various tools of
 Soviet foreign policy,  such as the Wo,rtd Peace
 Movement and other Gommunist international
 organizations.  Without trying to pass judge-
 ment as to whether tl e Revisionists honestly
 believe in coexh-ting peacefully with the non-
 Communist countries, it is probably safe to
 say that the Revision sts are inclined to consider
 such an attitude to be a principle rather than
 merely a useful but otherwise empty slogan,
 as do the orthodox Communists.
 f,  Attitude toward the Chief Basic Marxist-
 Leninist :Principles.  It should be pointed out
 that use of the word "doctrine" is generally
 avoided by Revisioni its.  When the word is
 used by them, it, is i i the sense of a general
 guiding principle anc never in the sense of an
 absolute untouchable dogma.  Nevertheless,
 the chief principles commonly accepted as
 basic to Marxisni-Leninism are not challenged
 by Revisionists, altl ough their interpretation
 of some of theme usually differs from the
 orthodox: Soviet interpreation,  The Revisionist

 doctrines is as follows.
 (1) Dialectical Materialism.  Although
 accused of being influenced by "idealism",
 "fideism", "positivism", "existentialism",
 and "empiricism", and therefore violating
 dialectical materialism, Revisionists
 appear to be innocent of this charge.  If,
 as Engels states and Lenin accepts, there
 are only two philosophical camps, "the
 camp of idealism" and "the various schools
 of materialism, "* then Revisionists belong
 among the latter, for they regard material
 nature and existence as primary to man's
 thought and spiritual nature.  If a dialectician
 is one who accepts the tenet ,;hat "all develop-
 ment is the 'struggle' of opposites, "** then
 Revisionists are dialecticians, for they
 believe in the employment of the dialectical
 method of studying the phenomena of nature.
 (2) Historical Materialism,  Revisionists
 are often accused groundless.y of violating
 'historical materialism because of an alleged
 belief in "idealism", "fideism", etc.  Like
 Marx, Revisionists believe that the principle
 of dialectical materialism should be extended

 Necessitating the Establishment of the
 Dictatorship of the Proletariat.  Re-
 visionists are also often accused, on
 grounds of "idealism", etc? of violating
 the principle of the antagonistic class
 struggle whicl-i demands the setting up of
 the dictatorship of the proletariat.  Although
 accepting this principle as such, they insist
 that the dictatorship of the proletariat
 should be maintained for the purpose of
 suppressing the exploitation of man by
 man, preventing the few from exploiting
 the labor of the working majority, preventing
 the bourgeoisie from setting up a dictator-
 ship of the bourgeoisie, effecting rational
 planning and a just distribution of the fruits
 of production.  The best known and most
 vocal Revisionists do not accept the
 Stalinist interpretation that dictatorship of
 the proletariat means a highly centralized

 government exclusively in the hands of a
 "narrow" Party. * Such a concept, claim
 the Revisionists, constitutes rule by a
 chosen elite and is a Platonic rather than
 a Marxist concept of government.  They
 also claim that the narrow Party concept,
 expressed originally by Lenin, was
 meant to apply only during the period
 prior to the seizure of power and during
 the process of establishing the dictatorship
 of the proletariat, not after it had been
 successfully established.
 (4)  Democratic Centralism.  Finally,
 Revisionists are often accused of v:.olating
 the principle of democratic centralism.
 However, they accept this Leninist organi-
 zational principle (the minority bowing to
 the expressed views of the majority in the
 Party machine for the purpose of practical
 "The government passed completely and entirely into
 the hands of one Party, into the hands of our Party,
 which does not share guidance of the state with any
 other party.  This is what we mean by the dictatorship
 of the proletariat."  (Stalin, "The Reply to Comrade
 Yansky, " Bolshevik, No. 7-8, 1927).  And this "Party
 of the proletarians.. must be numerically much
 smaller than the class of the proletarians."  Sochineniya,
 Moscow, Gospolitizdat, 1946).

 implementation )f these views).  Together
 with the orthodox, the Revisionists assert
 that without the principle of democratic
 centralism the Party could not serve as
 an effective vanguard of the proletariat.
 A Party denying this principle could neither
 effect a revoiuti)n (in non-democratic
 countries where Socialism is completely
 stymied) nor set up a dictatorship of the
 proletariat (again, in the countries where
 Socialism could be introduced only through
 such a drastic: method).  However, they
 reject as anti-Marxist and anti-Leninist
 the retention in([ rigid application of this
 principle (i, e., stressing its centralized
 natu:re and completely ignoring its demo-
 cratic cont(-nt) i' the dictatorship is firmly
 established or if it need not necessarily be
 established.  Revisionists are on firm
 ground in c r:itici zing such a practice as
 anti-Marx ist, bi It it is debatable whether
 it can be termed anti-Leninist, since Lenin
 was not specific on this point.  H:. wever,
 he was, in comparison to Stalin, undogmatic
 and was known to reverse himself even on
 ideologically important issues.  The Re-
 visionist case is therefore as good as or
 better than the orthodox.
 (5)  Leadin  Role of the Soviet Union.
 Although, as previously noted, this concept
 is not a bona fide basic Marxist-Leninist
 principle, it is i i the CPSU view the touch-
 stone of Marxist-Leninist purity--the

 ultimate principle to which Marxist-Leninist
 tenets are but stepping stones.  The Soviet
 ideological linkage of this principle with
 Marxism-Leninism is as follows.
 (a) Philosophical recognition of the
 primacy of matter (dialectic materialism)
 is an empty phrase unless the same
 principle is applied to society in its
 historical development (historical material-
 ism, primacy of the economic base);
 (b)  "Scientific" recognition of the
 "law" that all thought and all human
 institutions depend on the o:-ganizational
 character of the economy (historical
 materialism) is an empty phrase unless
 practical conclusions are d--awn from this-
 namely, that the capitalist economic system
 is but a mechanism for the exploitation of
 the working class, that an irreconcilable
 class struggle exists, that this class
 struggle demands the destruction of the
 old exploiting class (bourgeoisie), and
 that this destruction must be made ir-
 revocable through the establishment of
 the dictatorship of the proletariat.
 (c)  Realization of the necessity of
 setting up the dictatorship of the prole-
 tariat is only wishful thinking unless a
 suitable mechanism for its realization
 and maintenance is created, i.e., a
 Party organized according to the principle

 organizational principles, democratic
 centralism for the Party and dictatorship

 the smaller and weaker Communist
 parties and State i only a dream wiless

 which make: the leading role principle
 the main criterion of "true" contemporary
 Marxism-Lenini:m,* is rejected by
 Revisionists, as was previously and
 briefly rioted.  However, the Revisionist
 attach, on this "doctrine" does not reject
 Soviet; leadership as provided by example,
 advice, and financial and propaganda sup-
 port to the other [CM member nations
 and parties.     Moreover, the Revisionist
 rejection of the leading role principle
 does not rest on hatred of the Soviet Union,
 as Soviet propaganda alleges.  Revisionists
 are forced to reject this principle because
 "A revolutionary /or a true nor -Revisionist Communist/
 is he who... unreservedly, without hesitation, , . , without
 arguments, unconditionally, openly and.hone stly.. , is

 it has been interpreted by the CPSU
 to mean that the Soviets control the
 ideological content, the organizational
 form, and the political orientation of
 the ICM.  Revisionists believe that
 this principle is but a mask for modern
 imperialism and that it is not consonant
 with either the general goals of Socialism
 or the concept of scientif:.c Socialism.
 They also attack the Soviet cover-names
 for the principle, namely "proletarian
 internationalism," "international workerst
 solidarity, " "unbreakable unity of the
 Socialist camp, " and "solidarity of the
 Socialist States. "  Each one of these slogans
 presupposes, according to the Soviet view,
 the leading role of the Soviet Union, and
 without Soviet backing and Soviet leader-
 ship the workers cannot be international,
 united, solid, or invincible.
 g. Principal Orthodox Concepts Attacked by
 Revisionists.
 (1)  Leading Role of the Soviet Union.  This
 principle, the main ideological target of Re-
 visionism, is strongly attacked by Revisionists
 as noted above.
 (2)  Socialist Realism.  Revisionists do
 not attack the general aims of this principle.--
 the picturing of Socialism in all creative
 activity (art, literature, theater, music,
 propaganda) as desirable and realizable--but;

 they attack the methods employed in making
 Socialism "real",  such as lies, distortion,
 gilding of truth, aid the picturing of distant
 goals as present-clay reality.  They particu-
 larly attack the Soviet interpretation which
 led to Stalin's total control over people's
 minds,  suppression of objective truth, and
 idolization of Communist Party leaders
 generally and those of the CPSU in particular.
 Probably the best way in which to ap-
 preciate the differ once which exist:. between
 the Orthodox and. tie Revisionist Communists
 regarding the meaiing of Socialist realism
 is to view some examples of practices listed
 by the orthodox as violations which the Re-
 visionists consider as having no bearing on
 the "true" meaning of the Socialist realist
 principle. These practices consist of
 (a)  permitting a character in a
 novel who is an "enemy of the people"
 (or of "Socialism", "progress", "Marxism-
 Leninism", or the "Soviet Fatherland")
 to go unpunishec or undenounced;
 (b)  failing to reward those who are
 working for the "people", for "Socialism",
 for "progress", or against the "dying
 systems" (currently "imperialism", and
 formerly feudalism);

 better results of non-Marxist-Leninist

 methods without simultaneously pointing
 out that such results are either tempo-

 orthodox attitude is somewhat akin to
 the Christian attitude which differentiates
 between a gift made by a believer "out

 h. Most Important Theoretical Principles.
 (1)  Socialist Morality and Socialist
 Humanism.  The Marxist-Leninist concept
 of morality is that everything is moral which
 helps in the working class struggle.  Thus,
 morality consistE, first, of bringing about
 the revolution, which establishes the basic
 condition of progress in Socialist morality,
 namely, the Socialist ownership of the
 means of production.  Socialist ownership
 in turn will bring about the objective
 condition of the progress of the new morality,
 namely, the rise a.nd extension of Socialist
 democracy. *  Stalin simplified this notion
 "At the root of Communist morality, said Lenin, lies the
 struggle for the consolidation and the completion of Com-
 munism;" Radio Moscow broadcast, 20 August 1950, as
 quoted in The Red Interpreter, Vol. II, p. 982.

 to mean that the statutes of the Communist
 Party contain all the basic concepts of
 Socialist morality and ethics.  This
 concept of "Socialist morality", * prevalent
 during the "period of errors and warpings"
 (i.e., during the Stalinist period), had
 party discipline "squelching the very voice
 of conscience" and personal conviction,
 according to the Polish Revisionist
 Adam Schaff.  Schaff rejects the Stalinist
 concept in these words:  "Do not be a
 conformist!  Remember personal re-
 sponsibility, particularly moral responsibility
 The persistence of the Stalinist concept of morality is
 clearly evident in the official journal of tie Slovak CP,
 Pravda (25-26 September 1958).  The Slovak CP
 adequately represents the acceptable "orthodox" stand
 on morality because this Party is probably the only
 one which, while under close guidance and supervision
 of a Party almost entirely free of any "Revisionist"
 inclination (i.e., the Czechoslovak CP), is still. in-
 tensely interested in the problems of mo:?ality and
 ethics.  The Polish Revisionist, Adam Schaff, grants
 that "the problem of moral responsibility in politics
 is one of those with which Marxism has hitherto not
 concerned itself" /"Moral Responsibility of Politicians, "
 in Przeglad Kulturalny (Cultural Review), 4 September
 1958/.   He also points out that one of the "gaps" in
 Marxist-Leninist ideology is "the persoral moral
 responsibility of man for his deeds."

 for your deeds. '*  Additional condern.:iation
 of the Stalinist concept is made by another
 Gomulkaite Revi.sion_st, Barbara Ols,ewska:
 in the "so-called previous period.. an
 unethical deed was an ethical one if the
 authority of superior /Party/ orthodoxy
 stood behind it, morality was identical
 with Socialist: orthodoxy, those and only
 those who fought for Socialism were moral,
 all the rest co,ild. go to hell."  Such a
 concept is asse ;sed by the Revisionists
 as "meta.phvsical", riot Marxist-Leninist.**
 The Stalinist inte-pretation is seriously
 questioned by the Revisionists, particularly
 those in Poland, Great Britain, and France.
 They assert that certain things may be
 true, beaut. ful 4)r noble (or false, ugly and
 vile) irrespective of who and why he does
 them and that they are recognizable as
 such apart from their relation, if any, to
 Socialism and Communism.  But, being
 Marxists, and holding a naturalist view of
 man and his world,  Revisionists reject
 belief in any absolutes and, as a result of
 this rejection,  `ind at hard to establish the
 "Moral Responsibility :f .b?olitcians, " Przeglad

 standards against which morality, truth

 speak of the "unchanging values of
 culture"* and of "essential human values"**
 without specifying which values are
 either "essential" or "unchanging" and
 precisely what makes them so,  Other
 Revisionists claim that in moral principles
 there is both an eternal and a relative
 element; that the father of Communism,

 search for methods to overthrow capitalism,
 merely concentrated on the relative elements;

 Certain Revisionist moral philosophers
 present their "finding.," with much fanfare
 as great new discDveres.  They state that
 they are following and are "creatively"
 developing the main th)ughts of the great
 humanists of the past.  In fact, they equate
 "humanism" with their concept of "Socialism".
 For a Revisionist, "So :ialist humanistn"**
 For an objective treatment of this topic see Professor
 H. B. Mayo's "The Marxist Theory of Morals",  in
 Encyclopedia of Morals (New York, Philosophical
 Library, 1956), pp. 323-329 and Professor G. L. Kline's
 "Current Soviet Morality" (ibid. ), pp. 569-580. For a
 comprehensive presentation of the "true" (i.e., Re-
 visionist) attitude to morals see John Lewis' Marxism
 and the Open Mind (London, Routledge and Kegan Paul,
 1957), particularly the chapters on "Marxism and
 Ethics" (p. 94-131) and "Communis-n the Heir to the
 Christian Tradition" (pp. 193-220).
 This term seems to be used by most Revisionist writers
 and, at one time or another, in all established Revisionist
 publications; however, the most repetitious usage of
 the term is found in The New Reasoner, a publication
 of the British dissidents John Saville and E.P. Thompson;

 is a concept which contains all that is true,
 moral, and beautiful.  Some Revisionists,
 who accept the concept of "Socialist hu-
 manism" and declare themselves to be its
 proponents, exclude any positive value out-
 side this concept and appear to set them-
 selves up as the fount of human wisdom
 and the crown of human virtue.  One such
 Revisionist "high priest" is the British
 ex-Stalinist, E. P. Thompson.   He himself
 reports that the writer Colin Wilson attacked
 his attitude, stating that "the most irritating
 of the human fleas is a humanist with his
 conceited parading of the intellect and with
 his ignorance of his own stupidity. "* This
 particular attack may not be specifically
 applicable to Thompson, but it must be
 admitted that over-exposure to the literature
 of such Revisionist moralizers as Giolitti,
 Lefebvre, Sartre, Kolakowski, Fast, and
 Thompson can be very irritating.

 attack on Soviet Communism.  It is,
 however, an equally powerful denunciation
 of capitalism.  in fact, the anti-capitalist
 orientation of the "Socialist humanist"
 Revisionists is probably deeper and more
 basic than their anti-Stalinism.  When they
 denounce Stalinism,it appears to be for the
 purpose and with the hope of reforming it.
 To -wit, all that is needed is to place "men
 and women at the center of Socialist theory,
 instead of resounding abstractions such as
 the Party, the Two Camps, and the Van-
 guard of the Wo ?king Class. "*  Capitalism,
 on the other hand, is denounced because in
 its very essence it supposedly is a "negation...
 of the great human capabilities--economic,
 intellectual, spiritual."  If, for an intel-
 lectual, approval of Stalinism is a sin of
 casuistry and sophistry, approval of
 capitalism constitutes an even greater sin
 of selfishness and opportunism.**

 as standing for a scientific and non-
 dogmatic appraisal of economic and social
 development; and for a Socialism which is
 "humanisrn in practice", it logically
 follows that there can be no such thing as
 Revisionism  (as it is used in a derogatory
 sense by the crthodox) but only revision
 (a more or leas effective adjustment to
 facts and realities).  Likewise, if anyone
 claims to accept Marxism-Leninism in
 the above sense but simultaneously
 criticizes others who interpret the Marxist-
 Leninist goals differently but in accordance
 with Marxist-Leninist methodology (i. e. ,
 the "scientific principle" of dialectic and
 historical materialism), then the critic
 either (a) pay:; only lip service to Socialism/
 Communism as a science or (b) claims for
 himself the prerogative of being the sole
 arbiter of truth or falsity.
 D.        Strengths and Weaknesses of Revisionism
 Revisionism, viewed as a firm refusal to accept
 the CPSU as the final authority on the meaning of
 Marxism-Leninism in its interpretation and appli-
 cation in the various, parties and in the ICM as a
 whole, has both weaknesses and strengths.  In this
 discussion, weaknesses are treated first because
 they are inherent in the development of Revisionism
 itself.  These weaknesses might better be termed
 limiting factors, be,ause in spite of them Revisionism
 has developed to the point of being branded as the
 "chief danger" to th ~ ICM.

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300140001-9
 The first limiting factor is the Revisionists'
 hatred of capitalism and continued belief in the
 superiority of Communism.  Strong hatred of
 capitalism tends to act as a brake on Revisionist
 activity which might jeopardize the victory of
 Communism over capitalism.    The optimis-:ic
 orthodox interpretation set forth in the Twelve-
 Party Declaration of November 1957 is designed
 to capitalize on this very fact.  This interpretation
 states that the victory of Communism over capitalism
 is "inevitable" in view of the fact that Communist
 control has been established over a vast area
 containing nearly one billion people; that the Com-
 munist economy is expanding at a much greater
 rate than the economy of the capitalist countries;
 and that the Communist military establishment is
 second to none.  It follows that the only thing which
 could prevent the final and world-wide victory of
 Communism would be disunity within the bloc of
 Communist countries and within the parties of the
 ICM in and outside the Bloc.  This ideological appeal
 for acceptance of Soviet leadership is followed by a
 call for an uncompromising struggle against internal
 disruptive forces, of which Revisionism is the chief.
 Such a struggle of course implies the use o:: all
 feasible methods of coercion available to the CPSU
 and the orthodox leaders in the ICM.  Within the
 Soviet bloc, in particular, the overwhelming force
 available to the CPSU acts as a damper on the Re-
 visionist challenge.
 Secondly, Revisionists are neither organized
 in their challenge to Soviet orthodox Communist

 authority nor do they a',3pear capable of producing
 a unified world-wide front against Soviet and
 orthodox domination of the IGM.  There are only
 three organized Revisionist groups (Titoists,
 Gomulkaites, and some  national sections of the
 Trotskyite movements'i in which individual unity
 is also expressed in a more or less coherent
 and all-encompassing ideology.
 Although Gomulkaism was definitely a Re-
 visionist trend during 1956-1958, the 3rd PZPR
 Congress of March 191)9 and the current PZPR
 press indicate a considerable shift toward more
 orthodox positions.  Nevertheless, sufficient,
 remnants of Revisionist thinking appear to exist
 in the Gornulka-controlled Polish Party to justify
 the continued classification of Gomulkaism as
 Revisionism.  But any- significant additional
 muzzling of Party and non-Party intelligentsia,
 any significant additional tightening of control
 over press and publications, and a reversal of
 the current policies on agriculture and small
 industry, together wish an enthusiastic acceptance
 of the principle of the leading role of the CPSU,
 would eliminate Gomulkaism as a trend distinct
 from orthodox Communism.
 Titoists avoid like the plague any identification
 with the followers of the discredited Trotsky.
 Gomulkaites are determined to avoid identification
 with either Titoists cr Trotskyites, and the
 Trotskyites have hardly more in common with
 Titoists and Gomulka.ites than a hatred of Stalin
 and of his interpretation and application of

 Marxism-Leninism.  Actually the only firm
 common denominator for all Revisionists is
 their resistance to Stalinist practices, but un-
 fortunately there is no agreement among the
 Revisionists as to the meaning and full content
 of Stalinism.  For example, Trotskyrites consider
 Stalinism as a betrayal of "world revolution"
 and are not particularly concerned about features
 of Stalinism to which other Revisionists object,
 such as the lack of regard for human dignity.
 Others allude to Stalinist crimes, immorality,
 chauvinism, rigidity, etc.
 In 1957 and 1958 two important French
 Revisionists, Auguste Lecoeur and Pierre Herve,
 made an unsuccessful attempt to organize an
 international Revisionist center. *  The only
 agreement reached was a vague formula that it
 is good for anti-Stalinists to meet (without saying
 how often and on what basis) in order "to exchange
 experiences and study the best mean: for pursuing
 our battle which, at heart, is the same for all
 countries: the struggle for Socialisrn in liberty and
 justice. "**
 Lecoeur's Revisionist newspaper, La Nation Socialiste,
 devoted much space to this project throughout 1957 and
 early in 1958.

 Corrispondenza Socialista, as reported in February 1958.

 Finally, Revisionists too often criticize the
 CPSU and orthodox Communist authority with-
 out having a coherent and clearly outlined
 program of their own.  As noted in the Soviet
 press, "not one single revisionist group in Italy
 or France succeeded in establishing at least a
 bureau of its own ideology, to draft at least
 general outlines of a program. "*  It should be
 observed. here as a conjecture that when Re-
 visionist (or critical) activity is largely negative,
 people are prone to tire of cries of indignation
 and repeated criticism.  Then Revisionism
 disappears from public view and temporarily
 ceases to act as an open challenge to the Soviet
 authority.
 Althoiigh Revisionism is limited by the above
 factors, there can be no doubt--based on the
 extent and persistence of anti-Revisionist propa-
 ganda--that the Soviet leaders are seriously
 concerned about the Revisionist threat to their
 hegemony in the ICM. **  This concern appears
 to rest on the following two chief strong points of
 Revisionism.
 J. Putrament, "The Quicker the Better," Izvestia,
 26 July 1958.
 The Soviet journal Moskva, No. 1, 1958, states:
 "Revisionism and national communism must be beaten
 and destroyed ideologically... ; either we bury re-
 visionism or revisionism buries us.  There is no third
 course."

 First, Revisionism, as a trend wi':hin the
 ICM, has real knowledge of the situation in the
 ICM and presents criticism which distinguishes
 between the bleak realities and the embellished
 claims of Communism.  Revisionism exposes
 with authority the counterfeit value of "Socialist
 realism"; it presents clearly and unmistakably
 the many contradictions within the Communist
 ideological, political, social, and economic
 system.
 Secondly, Revisionism encompasses all the
 major factors of anti-Soviet resistance, such as
 nationalism, respect for the rule of law, ad-
 miration for democratic procedures, concern
 for morality, and an appreciation of human
 dignity and personal freedom.  Thus, Revisionism
 is seen by the orthodox Communists as a serious
 and lasting danger because it attempts to provide
 a documented, Marxist ideological basis for
 rebellion against the Soviet-imposed interpretation
 which currently predominates over this ICM.
 The potential of Revisionism has been aptly
 demonstrated since World War II:  first by Tito's
 defection; then the East Berlin workers' uprising
 in 1953; the Poznan workers' demonst:?ations and
 the Hungarian revolution in 1956, and the sub-
 sequent formation of factions within CPIs; the
 organization of splinter groups; and numerous
 defections of important Communist figures through-
 out the ICM.  There appears to be sufficient
 presumptive evidence that Revisionist thinking had
 been the chief danger to orthodox ideological and
 organizational concepts throughout the whole history

 of the international worl.erst movement, that it
 had resulted in the setting up of independent
 non-Communist parties representing the workers
 (Social Democratic parties), that it had trans-
 formed the separate Social Democratic parties
 into anti-Communist organizations, and finally,
 that it had been the chief cause of all significant
 individual Communist dF fections and purges.
 Politically, the most important Revisionist
 today is, of course, Tito (in addition to its
 lessening intensity, Goniulkats brand of Re-
 visionism has much more limited international
 significance than that of Tito).  His defiance of
 Soviet authority and independent interpretation
 and application of Marxism-Leninism provide
 a living example that Socialism can be built
 independently, free of Suwiet direction and with-
 out copying the e stablis} ed Soviet model.  More-
 over, Tito has stated hiii willingness to assist
 other Revisionists in fighting "old Stalinist
 positions".  In his 11 November 1956 speech at
 Pula, Tito stated:  We must "act in closest
 contact with the Polish Government and Party,
 and help them as much as we can.  Together with
 the Polish comrades, we shall have to fight such
 tendencies /:i. e? , the clinging to the "old Stalinist
 positions/. "*

 Because Revisionism generally undermines
 Soviet ideological and organizational control of
 the ICM, it is in the interest of all democratic
 forces to sustain and encourage it, e.g., by
 acceptance and propagation of the interpretation
 of Marxism-Leninism and the essence of Com-
 munism from the standpoint of Revisionism.
 This is obviously not to be understood as
 approval of Revisionism per se or to suggest
 the propagation of Revisionism as a substitute
 for any existing non-Communist programs or
 systems outside the Sino-Soviet orbit.
