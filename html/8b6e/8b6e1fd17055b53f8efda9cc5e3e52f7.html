 PEIPING BUYS MORE FREE WORLD INDUSTRIAL PLANTS
 Since mid-1963 Peiping has
 bought from the West at least
 ten complete industrial instal-
 lations worth almost $100 mil-
 lion.               It is negotiating for sev-
 eral more.   Most of the contracts
 already signed are for petroleum
 refineries and chemical plants--
 fertilizer-              and syn-
 thetic fiber--and most of them
 provide for five-year credits
 and technicians to help operate
 the plants.   To date, Peiping
 has spread its purchases among
 a number of free world countries
 with contracts concluded in Italy,
 West Germany, France, Britain,
 the Netherlands, and Japan.
 The most recent purchases
 are a $12.5-million plastics
 plant from Britain, and a small
 synthetic fiber plant and a pe-
 troleum refinery from West Ger-
 many.               The Chinese have con-
 cluded a provisional contract
 for a Japanese synthetic fiber
 plant and have also inquired
 about a wide variety of other
 industrial installations in
 Japan and Western Europe.
 Along with these new plant
 deals, the Chinese are accepting
 substantial numbers of non-bloc
 technicians needed to supervise
 construction and operations.   In
 addition, some Chinese techni-
 cians will be sent to the free
 world for training.   While no
 less xenophobic than in the past,
 Peiping faces the necessity of
 accepting outside assistance to

 perform many technically ad
 vanced tasks.   In any event
 most, if not all, free worlc
 suppliers would refuse to
 guarantee their equipment un-
 less installation was super-
 vised by their own experts.
 Because of lags in deliv-
 eries and construction it will
 be several years before all the
 plants already purchased will
 be in full operation.   Equip-
 ment and increased numbers of
 free world technicians, however,
 should begin arriving in Chiaa
 soon.   Construction on a $20-mil-
 lion Japanese synthetic fibe
 plant is to begin early in 1965
 near Peiping.   A fertilizer com-
 plex purchased from Dutch and
 British firms will be started
 next summer at Lu-chou.   Sev_
 eral other Western plants art,
 also scheduled for construction
 beginning next year.                       25X1

 DISCORD IN THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY
 As Peiping and Moscow move
 steadily toward a formal split, the
 Chinese Communists have been simul-
 taneously  sharpening attacks on
 "revisionists" within their own
 ranks.   By Chinese definition, a
 revisionist is anyone who is willing
 to be conciliatory toward the USSR
 or indifferent toward the class
 struggle at home.   So far,  the main
 target of the attacks seems to have
 been middle-level party officials,
 although the recent criticism of a
 low-ranking central committee member
 has led to speculation that a high-
 level shake-up may be in the offing.
 The chief scapegoat named to
 date is Yang Hsien-chen, 92nd in
 the 93-man party central committee,
 head of the Higher Party School un-
 til about 1959, and a Moscow-
 trained Marxist philosopher of some
 note.   This is the first time since
 the antirightist. purge of 1957-58
 that a high party figure has been
 criticized by name.   Since mid-
 July the party journals People's
 Daily and Red Flag have repeatedly
 at' arcked Yang for espousing re-
 visionist views at the Higher Party
 School where he reportedly still
 continued to lecture, at least as
 recently as April 1964.   The chief
 accusation against Yang is that he
 propagated a dialectical theory
 which provides a basis for recon-
 ciliation with Soviet revisionism.
 Peiping asserts that Yang's "com-
 bine two into one" theory runs di-
 rectly counter to Mao Tse-tung's
 thesis that at this time a split in
 the Communist movement would be
 natural because "everything tends
 to divide into two."
 According to a Red Flag article
 broadcast on 7 Septemrer,  the de-
 18 Sept 64
 bate over Yang's heresy i.i be-
 coming "ferocious" and resembles
 the one that raged in the USSR
 during Stalin's struggle against
 what the article called the "Trot-
 sky-Bukharin antiparty grouping."
 There was no other sugges-ion
 that a parallel antiparty grouping
 might be developing in China, how-
 ever, and most likely the state-
 ment was intended chiefly as a
 new, sharper warning to w+..uld-be
 revisionists.
 The moderate, conciliatory
 philosophy Yang stands fo? probably
 appeals to many middle-of--the-road
 party members.   Peiping has con-
 ceded that even in the reatively
 clean Chinese society theie are
 some "degenerates" who must be
 weeded out.
 It has long been an anomaly
 that Chou En-lai and a few other
 politburo figures seemingly hold
 views not markedly different from
 those attributed to Yang. There is
 no evidence, however, that their
 political health is in decline.  In
 Chou's case at least, his political
 position was confirmed in an offi-
 cial announcement on 12 September
 listing him among the "close com-
 rades-in-arms of Mao Tse-tung" who
 had been elected along with Mao as
 delegates to the forthcoming Third
 National Peoples Congress from the
 Peiping municipality.
 Chou En-lai could well be in
 poor physical health, however.   Us-
 ually very active, he has been out of
 public view since 10 August and,ac-
 cording to the head of the New       25X1
 China News Agency in Hong =Cong, may
 not resume his government 1uties
 until the end of September.

 YUGOSLAVIA AND THE SECOND NONALIGNED CONFERENCE
 The second nonaligned con-
 ference opening in Cairo on 5
 October will probably be no more
 favorable to Western interests
 than was the first in Belgrade
 in September 1961.   At that time
 Tito sharply criticized the West
 and condoned Khrushchev's deci-
 sion to resume nuclear testing
 in the atmosphere.
 Although Yugoslav officials
 claim they will play a moderating
 role at the conference, it is
 doubtful that they will sacrifice
 any opportunity to enhance the
 Yugoslav position among the non-
 aligned countries.   Tito,  the
 UAR's Nasir, and Indonesia's Su-
 karno,  jockeying to dominate the
 conference, probably will exag-
 gerate statements catering to
 the diverse interests and prej-
 udices  of the delegates.
 Yugoslavia already opposes
 Western positions on many of the
 items on the conference agenda.
 Tito's strong statement of 11
 August, condemning the West for
 its activities in Vietnam, Cy-
 prus, and the Congo, specifically
 calls for the conference to deal
 with these issues.   The Yugoslav
 press has implied that Soviet
 policy in these countries has
 been helpful to world peace.
 On disarmament and nuclear
 weapons--an important item on
 the agenda--Yugoslavia's posi-
 tion is sharply pro-Soviet.
 Tito has consistently supported
 Moscow's call for complete and
 total disarmament, even to the
 point of including such a Ira-
 vision in the Yugoslav conEti.tu-
 tion.
 Tito's efforts to assErt
 leadership of the nonaligned
 states will be enhanced by a
 discussion of the proposed cod-
 ification by the UN of the prin-
 ciples of coexistence, an item
 which is especially attractive
 to the less developed states.
 Tito first broached this subject
 in a 1960 speech before the UN.
 Yugoslav officials have indi-
 cated that they will exert a mod-
 erating influence on the discus-
 sions of "colonialism" but they
 may be unable to do so because
 of the strong emotions this  is-
 sue arouses among the African
 nations.

 In an effort to reconcile

 HANOI'S INFILTRATION ROUTES
 North Vietnam has four ma-
 jor logistic and infiltration
 routes over which it furnishes
 support to insurgents in South
 Vietnam and Laos.   Since 1960,
 when men and supplies began mov-
 ing down these life lines in
 large quantities, Hanoi has in-
 vested considerable effort in
 improving and protecting roads
 and installations.   It is es-
 timated that through 1963 at
 least 12,000 and possibly as
 many as 20,000 well-trained mili-
 tary and political cadres have
 followed these routes to pro-
 vide the Viet Cong in South Viet-
 nam with the backbone of their
 forces.   Modern weapons and am-
 munition, as well as other sup-
 plies not available locally to
 the Viet Cong, have also been
 moved south from North Vietnam.
 The net result of Hanoi's sup-
 port has been a gradual and con-
 tinual improvement in Viet Cong
 capabilities for guerrilla war-
 fare.
 Recent infiltration studies
 by COMUSMACV indicate that most
 guerrillas enter South Vietnam
 over three major land routes and
 one seaborne infiltration route.
 One of the land routes crosses
 the Demilitarized Zone along the
 17th parallel; the other two use
 secure routes through Laos and
 Cambodia.   The route into Laos
 extends from the rail terminus
 at Vinh and the convoy staging
 area at Bai Due Thon down Route
 12 to several Communist logisti-
 cal installations along Route 9
 in Laos.   Vehicular traffic ap-
 parently stops at Muong Phine,
 Tchepone, and Ban Thay, and sup-
 plies are then carried by men
 or animals over numerous trails
 into South Vietnam.   Many of
 the trails apparently enter
 South Vietnam along the Qua;ng
 Nam Province border.   This
 route serves as a major Viet
 Cong logistic channel.
 Aerial photography from
 March through May of this year
 revealed that truck traffic on
 Route 12 would have been con-
 siderably in excess of the re-
 quirements of Communist forces
 in Laos estimated to be in this
 area.   Many of the trucks re-
 portedly carried troops.   Some
 of the supplies trucked in were
 probably intended for stock-
 piling before the rainy season
 when the roads became impassable
 but it is believed that  a con-
 siderable amount was probably
 intended for the Viet Cong.
 Recently,. Hanoi has ap-
 parently taken measures to

 reduce the vulnerability of ex-
 posed installations to aerial
 attack.   The precaution probably
 stems from recent statements in
 the Western press that US offi-
 cials are considering the bomb-
 ing of infiltration or logistic
 targets as one measure to try
 to make Hanoi "cease and desist"
 in its support of the Viet Cong.
 In recent aerial photog-
 raphy, the Bai Due Thon instal-
 lation appears to be abandoned.
 At least 24 of its 30 buildings
 have been completely dismantled.
 A heavily traveled path, not
 evident on previous photography,
 leads into the woods south of
 Route 12.   On many occasions
 large numbers of trucks were
 photographed at Bai Due Thon as
 they formed their convoys for
 movement down Route 12.
 Farther south, at the Mu
 Gia camp on the North Vietnam -
 Laos border, several buildings
 have been dismantled.   In addi-
 tion, a bunker appears to be
 under construction in front of
 the large headquarters building,
 suggesting some expansion of un-
 derground facilities or defenses.
 Other defenses include six bunk-
 ers and numerous automatic weap-
 ons and antiaircraft emplacements.

 relatively new installations and
 both played a major part in the
 logistic activity noted earlier,
 this year.   In Laos, vegetation
 is overgrowing one area of  the
 Muong Phine camp and several
 buildings have been dismantled.
 No change is apparent in the
 Tchepone complex although very
 little activity has been noted
 here on almost daily low-level
 photographic missions.
 The dismantling of these in-
 stallations does not indicate that
 Hanoi intends to slow down ats
 logistical support for the 'Viet
 Cong and Pathet Lao.   Rather,
 these facilities are probao'y
 being moved to nearby areas in
 the jungle where they will be dif-
 ficult to detect and where they
 will not present such tempting
 targets for aerial attack.  Hanoi
 has amply demonstrated its (apabil-
 ities  for, moving men and jnateriel
 clandestinely. If anything, Hanoi's
 apparent willingness to re-urn to
 such techniques underscores the
 fact that it is determined to keep
 the supplies flowing.
 Supplies also come fro, the
 Cambodian ports of Sihanoukville
 and Kep and are then broug?it to
 the Viet Cong by the many rivers
 and canals in the *ekong D4,1ta

 ABORTIVE COUP ATTEMPT IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 The abortive coup attempt
 against Premier Khanh on 13
 September further exposed the
 deep internal divisions both in
 the government and the general
 public.  The coup leaders were
 IV Corps commander Duong Van
 Duc, and the outgoing Interior
 Minister, General Lam Van Phat.
 Initially successful in Saigon,
 the coup quickly foundered when
 its leaders failed to attract
 support from other military
 commands and the US affirmed its
 strong disapproval.  Khanh's
 key support  came from the air
 force commander, General Nguyen
 Cao Ky, with assistance from
 commanders of the marines, navy,
 airborne brigade, rangers and
 I Corps in the north.
 Most of the coup principals
 had recently been transferred
 or relieved of command as part
 of a broad reshuffle intended
 to curb Khanh's political rivals
 and to remove targets of Buddhist
 criticism.  The coup probably
 also reflected more generalized
 concern in the armed forces that
 Khanh had gone too far in acced-
 ing to Buddhist demands.  Many
 who supported Khanh probably
 share this concern.   Khanh's
 plans for the early reinstate-
 ment of the five generals of
 the Minh junta, whom he had
 earlier accused of neutralist
 plotting, may also have been a
 factor.
 The coup and its aftermath
 have led to yet another shift
 in Khanh's power base.   Ky and
 the other generals who saved
 Khanh have occupied the center
 of the stage ever since.  They
 have referred by implication
 to Khanh's dependence on then
 and publicly warned that if tie
 does not accede to their demands
 within a reasonable time, they
 will act themselves.  Among
 their demands is an extensive
 purge of the armed forces at
 the senior officer level, in-
 cluding not only the coup
 instigators, now under arres?,
 but also the five generals o
 the Minh junta.   They also
 prefess support for Khanh's
 announced intention to turn
 the government over to civil=ans
 within a few months, although
 reserving the option to seize
 power if the civilians fail.
 Viet Cong activity, prim. rily
 widely scattered small-scale
 attacks, harassment, and sabo-
 tage, rose gradually during
 the week to 582 incidents,
 somewhat above the 1964 week
 average.    A recent broad-
 cast by the National Front fc?r
 the Liberation of South Vietnam
 exhorted "compatriots" to rise
 up on all fronts to exploit
 the government's disarray.
 This suggests the Viet Cong
 activity may soon intensify
 significantly.

 Indonesia-Malaysia:   Ten-

 then announced month-long naval
 exercises in the Sunda Strait

 The second Arab summit con-
 ference on 5-10 September pro-
 duced some progress on plans to
 divert the Jordan River headwa-
 ters and on the creation of an
 Arab military force.   Fears of
 Egyptian domination, however,
 put a. brake on Nasir's desire
 for more energetic moves.   He
 was forced to accept compromises
 that made the conference less
 of a. personal political triumph
 than was the first summit held
 last January.
 The United Arab Command
 (UAC), established in January
 to create a, military force cap-
 able of warding off an Israeli
 military response to the Arab
 diversion projects, received
 additional financial backing.
 Syria.; Jordan, and Lebanon, how-
 ever, refused to permit mixed
 Arab forces to be stationed in
 their territory.   This refusal
 has considerably lessened the
 UAC's capability to be a. quick
 and effective force along Is-
 rael's frontiers as originally
 envisaged.
 Jordan reaffirmed its com-
 mitment to expand its own mili-
 tary forces, and a.dditona.l funds
 for this purpose were pledged.
 Both Jordan and Lebanon suer-ess
 fully resisted Egyptian pressure
 to acquire Soviet arms--osten-
 sibly to achieve standardization.
 This pressure is likely to  in-
 crease if they do not fill their
 requirements from Western sources.
 On diversion itself,  i'.
 was agreed that two projects
 are to be started soon:      Vie
 Mukhayban Dam on the Yarmuc
 River between Jordan and Syria.,
 and the diversion of the Ba.nyas
 River in Syria..   Lebanon,  iow-
 ever, refused to begin any work
 on its tributaries until Vie
 Arab states are prepared t,,
 counter any Israeli milita-_y
 response.   The Lebanese esz,.-
 mated it would take at  Lea ii
 three years to build such a
 force.

 and President Makarios have
 reduced tension on Cyprus in re-
 cent days, but no progress has
 been made toward a solution of
 the basic problem--the coexist-
 ence   of Greek and Turkish Cyp-
 riot communities.   Ankara,claim-
 ing that refugees at Kokkina
 faced starvation, had threatened
 to use force to ensure that re-
 lief supplies got through to hard-
 pressed Turkish Cypriot communi-
 ties.   This latest threat of a
 military confrontation ended,
 however, when UN Commander Thi-
 mayya's report tended to sub-
 stantiate the claims and the UN
 forces dispatched emergency re-
 lief.
 Subsequent proposals from
 President Makarios, if imple-
 mented, could lead to a more gen-
 eral relaxation of tension.   On
 15 September he announced that
 the economic blockade had been
 lifted throughout the island and
 that relief shipments from Turkey
 would be allowed to land at Fama-
 gusta apparently duty free.   The
 first Turkish relief ship was
 slated to arrive on 17 September.
 Makarios also proposed a.
 general amnesty, the removal of
 all fortified positions by both
 sides, and the granting of fi-
 nancial aid to Turkish Cypriot
 refugees wishing to return to
 attempting to place his regime
 in a favorable light during the
 UN Security Council debate on ex-
 tending the UN mandate for Cyprus.
 The Security Council is
 expected to extend the mandate
 for an additional three morths--
 to 26 December.   Secretary Gen-
 eral Thant hopes to strengthen
 the UN forces' position by in-
 cluding in his latest report
 "assumptions" upon which he  in-
 tends to have them act.   Thant
 "assumes" the UN cannot discharge
 its functions unless it has un-
 restricted freedom of movement,
 and the right to remove positions
 and fortified installations en-

 necessary measures in self-de-

 With the military situation
 in the Congo considerably im-
 proved, Premier Tshomb6 is moving
 to extend the diplomatic gains
 scored at last week's Organi-
 zation of African Unity foreign
 ministers' meeting.
 Government forces have re-
 captured several important towns
 from the rebels.   Lisala, a pro-
 vincial capital 300 miles below
 the rebel center of Stanleyville,
 fell early this week, as did
 Boende east of Coquilhatville.
 In the central Congo:  another
 provincial capital, Lodja,  is
 under heavy government pressure.
 Rebels reportedly are fleeing
 the rail town of Kongolo as
 Tshombd's men move northward to-
 ward Kindu.
 Near Lake Tanganyika, gov-
 ernment  forces advancing toward
 Fizi have stopped to reorganize.
 Farther north, troops holding
 Bukavu are reported to be expect-
 ing a new rebel attack, although
 air strikes by T-28s  probably
 have kept the military balance
 in their favor.
 Tshombe goes this weekend
 to Nairobi for the first meeting
 of the OAU's newly established
 Congo conciliation commission.
 Kenyatta also seems
 likely to use his influence
 to limit involvement in Congo-
 lese internal affairs.   With
 his aid, and that of moder-
 ates on the commission,
 Tshombt probably will be able
 to withstand immediate radi-
 cal pressures to hold early
 round-table talks with all
 "Congolese factions."  Con-
 tinuing rebel dissension pre-

 If the government continues

 cesses the insurgents will
 soon lose all claims to le-

 control of large sections of

 SOUTHERN RHODESIAN INDEPENDENCE ISSUE
 The immediate threat of a
 unilateral declaration of inde-
 pendence by Southern Rhodesia
 apparently has been staved off
 as a result of the conference
 earlier this month between the
 prime ministers of Britain and
 Southern Rhodesia.   No fundamen-
 tal issues have been resolved,
 however, and a new crisis is
 likely to occur within a few
 months.
 After the London talks,
 Southern Rhodesian Prime Minis-
 ter Ian Smith acknowledged that
 Britain must be satisfied that
 a majority of the population--
 and not just the 230,000 white
 settlers--supported a request
 for independence.   Smith publicly
 declared that unilateral inde-
 pendence had been "chucked out
 of the window for the time being,"
 although he hoped the self-gov-
 erning colony would attain inde-
 pendence by agreement this year.
 In Southern Rhodesia, senti-
 ment for independence in the
 white community has grown during
 the summer.   In early August,
 cabinet radicals presented Smith
 with an ultimatum to take steps
 to achieve this, or be forced
 out of office as Winston Field
 was last April.   As a result,
 Smith went to London in an uncom-
 promising mood.                           The government
 had scheduled two by-elections
 for 1 October; one of them, be-
 tween deputy prime minister Du-
 pont and former federal prime
 minister Welensky, was being
 fought on the issue of independ-
 ence.
 London and Salisbury differ
 in their interpretation of the
 key point regarding a "popular
 mandate" for independence.   In
 Britain's view, there would be
 no "popular mandate" unless the
 entire population of the colony
 endorsed independence undex  the
 present constitution which ef-
 fectively restricts African vot-
 ing.   The Southern Rhodesian Gov-
 ernment, on the other hand.                                                                       in-
 tends to use the present voting
 rolls--about 85,000 Europeans
 and 15,000 Africans--and the
 traditional African tribal struc-
 ture.   Conservative chiefs would
 thereby speak on behalf of over
 three million Africans.   Airican
 nationalist leaders have already
 voiced strong opposition to in-
 dependence under the present
 constitution.
 Smith's position in South-
 ern Rhodesia appears to have
 been strengthened by the consul-
 tation with British leaders.   He
 has been given time to build up
 strength in the colony among some
 moderate sectors of the white
 community--businessmen, military
 leaders, and relatively recent
 arrivals from Britain.   The prime
 minister has probably also been
 able to satisfy temporarily  she
 radical elements in his own  gov-
 ernment.   If he gains his ex-
 pected Rhodesian approval for in-
 dependence, Smith will be in a
 far stronger position to press
 London for immediate independence.
 Although the British Government
 seems to have removed the Rhode-
 sian issue from the campaign for
 the 15 October elections, London
 later will face the same basic
 dilemma.   Acquiescing in iide-
 pendence would arouse the ire of
 African Commonwealth members.
 whereas risking a unilateral dec-
 laration                                                                        might oblige Britain to

 A new Berlin pass agreement
 remains as elusive as ever after
 eight months of negotiations. The
 two chief negotiators--Horst Kor-
 ber of West Berlin and Erich Wendt
 of East Germany--had worked out
 a, new formula., but Bonn turned it
 down.
 Although Wendt this week re-
 jected modifications suggested by
 Bonn, talks to break the impasse
 will probably continue.
 West Germany's position re-
 flects Chancellor Erhard's opposi-
 tion to any arrangement like the
 one negotiated for last Christmas.
 The provision allowing East German
 officials to issue passes in West
 Berlin, the degree to which the
 signature formula. seemed to recog-
 nize the East German regime, and
 reference to Berlin on the applica-
 tion as "the capital of the GDR,"
 were features Bonn found most ob-
 jectionable.
 The latest Korber-Wendt pro-
 posal considerably relaxed the re-
 strictions against West Berliners
 visiting East Berlin.   Visiting
 would have been allowed next Christ-
 mas, Easter, Whitsuntide, and for
 a. period this fall.   A permanent
 pass office was also proposed,
 through which arrangements could
 be made for visits throughout the
 year in cases of illness, deaths,
 births, and marriages.
 The new proposals, however,
 did not overcome Bonn's chief ob-
 jections.  The only change made
 was to add West Berlin officials,
 in a. minor role, to the pass-is-
 suing operation to create a "mixed
 presence."
 The Bonn Cabinet decided on 9
 September to hold out for better
 terms.   Its trumps are Khrushchev's
 presumed desire to create a favor-
 able atmosphere for his visit to
 Bonn, and East Germany's need for
 fertilizers which Bonn has said it
 will not supply unless there is a.
 satisfactory pass agreement.
 Erhard,nevertheless, took the
 precaution to obtain broad politi-
 cal endorsement of the cabinet's
 decision.   He called a. special
 meeting of the leaders of all the
 Bundestag parties and with Mayor
 Brandt--a. supporter of the Korber-
 Wendt draft --at his side won a
 unanimous agreement that Ktirber
 should seek a better deal.   ro`
 help his case, Erhard broke> the
 news of the recent poison gas at-
 tack on a West German diplomat
 in the Soviet Union.
 The meeting with Wend' on 14
 September took place in a  frosty
 atmosphere."   Korber,  nevertheless,
 proposed elimination of the offensive
 clause describing Berlin a:~; the "cap-
 ital of the GDR," advanced an innocu-
 ous signature formula and asked that
 the agreement remain valid through the
 1965 Christmas season.   Tw+= days
 later, Wendt rejected the proposals.
 It is not known whether these devel-
 opments are connected with the East
 German slowdown of Berlin truck
 traffic, which began on 15 September,
 Despite the momentary show of
 harmony in the West German camp, Er-
 hard will be in political hot water
 if the negotiations break down com-
 pletely.    He will probably come un-
 der attack not only from the opposi-
 tion Social Democrats, but also from
 his coalition partners, th   Free
 Democrats.

 Belgian Foreign Minister
 Spaak has given further impetus
 to the reviving interest in Eu-
 ropean political union with the
 proposals he advanced at last
 week's Western European Union
 meeting.   He urged the creation
 of a political commission of
 "three wise men" with a three-
 tc five-year mandate to encour-
 age political cooperation and,
 based on that experience, to
 work out definitive plans for
 European unification.   His idea

 mission can help push sover-
 eignty-conscious states toward
 closer economic integration.

 The British are always fear-

 a closer union without there, and
 the Dutch--in addition to their
 usual support of London on this
 issue--are annoyed by Spaak's
 failure to notify them of hits
 intention to disclose his plan
 at this time.

 NATO'S UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ON MALTA
 The North Atlantic Council
 (NAC) has approved an overture to
 Malta aimed at retaining NATO's
 installation on that island for
 the time being, but leaving unde-
 cided Malta's post-independence re-
 lationship to NATO.
 The NAC agreed this week to
 request the Maltese Government to
 honor existing agreements regarding
 the headquarters on Malta of the
 commander-in-chief of allied forces
 in the Mediterranean at least un-
 til new arrangements have been
 discussed.   In addition, Deputy
 Secretary General James Roberts,
 who will. attend the independence
 ceremonies on 21 September,  has
 been authorized to sound out the
 Maltese on the possibilities of a
 broader agreement.
 This cautious approach fuzzes
 over the question of whether Malta
 --which is also the site of an im-
 portant British base--will be le-
 gally within NATO's defense per-
 imeter after independence.  It also
 reflects   the council's sharp divi-
 sions over what an independent
 Malta's connection with NATO ought
 to be.   The Belgians,  for example,
 favor offering Malta full mt'rrbership
 in NATO.   The French,  on th i other
 hand, are against any dealings un-
 less Malta specifically ask:;.  In-
 deed, French resistance to   he
 Roberts mission was overcome only
 when it was stipulated that the en-
 voy's explorations would be purely
 oral.
 Some thought has been ?;iven to
 transferring the NATO commaito to
 Naples.   Malta,  however,  haE  also
 been considered as a possib=e base
 for the   seaborne multilateral. nu-
 clear force (MLF) now under consid-
 eration by several NATO countries.
 The possibility that Dow Min-
 toff, head of Malta's oppos.tion
 Labor Party, will win the first post-
 independence general elections also
 complicates the picture.  Mintoff
 would, at best, be politica?ly un-
 predictable.   He has advocated Mal-
 tese neutrality and London Las long  25X1
 been suspicious of his flirtations
 with Moscow, Cairo, and Alg_ers.
 Finland:   The inauguration last
 week of a -new coalition government
 under Johannes Virolainen, the
 chairman-elect of the dominant
 Agrarian Party, ended nine months
 of rule by a caretaker government
 of civil servants.   It probably
 also precludes the need for a spe-
 cial parliamentary election before
 the regularly scheduled one in 1966.
 In addition to the Agrarians,
 the coalition consists of two cen-
 ter parties--the Finnish and Swed-
 ish People's Parties--and the Con-
 servatives.   Of the 15 cabinet posi-
 tions, the Agrarians hold 7, the
 Conservatives 3, and the two center
 parties 2 each.   The 15th n_inister is
 a nonparty civil servant.   The cabi-
 net is supported by 113 of 200 par-
 liament members.                                                                       In opposition are
 the Communists and Socialists who re-
 spectively control 47 and 40 parlia-
 mentary seats.
 The most difficult prcblems fac-
 ing the new government are of a budg-
 etary nature.  In order to get agree-
 ment on the coalition,Virolainen ap-
 parently had to agree to retract cer-
 tain fiscal proposals of the care-
 taker government.  These included an
 increase in personal income taxes and25X1
 an increase in'interest rates on
 state loans for housing and land set-

 Guerrillas and intriguing
 politicians continue to pose
 problems for the Peralta govern-
 ment.  The regime, however, seems
 well informed of the cabals and
 is ready to take precautionary
 protective measures.
 The arrest on 6 September
 of a key urban guerrilla leader
 seems to have thwarted terrorist
 plans to cause trouble in Gua.te-
 ma.la City during this week's in
 dependence celebrations .r
 Internationally, the Guate-
 malan Government is preoccupied
 with its campaign to block
 London's plan--which has Mexico's
 blessing--to grant eventual
 independence to British Honduras.
 The Guatemalan Constituent Assem-
 bly has recently reaffirmed
 Guatemala's claim to Belice,the
 local name for the area..   Iii
 British Honduras, however,  inter-
 est in association with Guate-
 mala is only negligible.
 High-level talks between a.
 British official and the Guate-
 malans are scheduled in Guatemala
 later this month on the Bel ice
 problem.   The mutually incompati-
 ble position of the two countries,
 however, seems to preclude any
 significant movement toward a
 mutually satisfactory settlement.
