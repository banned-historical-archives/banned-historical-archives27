 LEBANON
 l
 Sulayman Franjiyah's term as presi-
 dent finally came to an end this week, and
 his successor, Ilyas Sarkis, assumed of-
 fice-under less than auspicious cir-
 cumstances. The lo-awaited Sarkis in-
 auguration took place only four days after
 the virtual collapse of the latest Arab
 League peace initiative and in the midst of
 a new upsurge of fighting in Beirut.
 The breakdown on September 19 of
 tripartite  talks  that Arab  League
 mediator al-Khuli promoted to work out
 a cease-fire and reconciliation between
 Syria and the Palestinians dimmed the
 already     bleak  prospects  for  a
 breakthrough in negotiations to end the
 18-month-old civil war. It also increased
 the likelihood that Syria will soon resume
 military operations in Lebanon.
 The most immediate effect of the
 deadlock was to trigger renewed fighting
 in Beirut, forcing a change in the venue of
 Sarkis' inauguration from the capital to
 Shaturah, a Lebanese town under Syrian
 occupation. Leftist leader Kamal
 Jumblatt and Muslim Prime Minister
 Karami boycotted the inauguration, but
 65 deputies-a quorum-were on hand.
 Before leaving office, Franjiyah
 stripped Karami, a long-time political foe,
 of most of his cabinet responsibilities, in-
 cluding the defense and finance portfolios.
 Franjiyah named his ally, Christian ex-
 tremist Camille Shamun, who already
 holds the positions of interior minister and
 foreign minister, to the defense post and
 to the job of acting prime minister in
 Karami's  absence.  Shamun doubtless
 hopes to use his position as defense
 minister to gain a dominant role in the
 formation of a new Lebanese army.
 Egyptian President Sadat and Syrian
 President Asad reportedly agreed this
 week to attend an oft-postponed four-
 power Arab summit conference in Saudi
 Arabia. The meeting may take place
 sometime next week, after the Muslim
 holiday celebrating the breaking of the
 month-long Ramadan period of fasting.
 Sarkis and several other prominent
 Lebanese leaders apparently were in-
 strumental in arranging the meeting in the
 hope that Asad and Sadat can be per-
 suaded to put aside their differences and
 work together to resolve the Lebanese
 crisis. (An assessment of Sadat's rivalry
 with Asad appears on page 7.)
 There is no indication, however, that
 the two Arab leaders are ready to
 cooperate. Sadat doubtless welcomes the
 opportunity to gain a role in determining
 the shape of any political settlement in
 Lebanon. Judging by the continued harsh
 Syrian propaganda attacks on Sadat,
 however, Asad has agreed to attend the
 summit more out of deference to the
 Saudis than from any compelling interest
 in making up with Sadat. (The prospects
 for President Sarkis' administration are
 reviewed on page  9.)

 Soviets Shifting Positions
 The USSR is cutting back its criticism
 of Syria in reaction, apparently, to recent
 Arab    political  activity  concerning
 Lebanon. The Soviets seem to want to en-
 courage all sides toward a political settle-
 ment, but we have no evidence that they
 foresee an early solution to the crisis.
 The USSR is being more evenhanded
 toward the Syrians and the Palestinians in
 its public statements. On September 8, an
 authoritative "Observer" article in Prav-
 da for the first time upbraided "leftist
 elements" of the Palestine Liberation
 Organization along with the Syrian
 government for failing to achieve a cease--
 fire. Soviet public statements on Syria
 have softened in subsequent weeks, and
 the central press has stopped calling for
 Syrian troop withdrawals.
 On September 20, a Soviet diplomat in
 Cairo told US officials that Moscow is
 urging both the Syrians and the
 Palestinians to reach a compromise. The
 Soviets, he said, have been using "friendly
 persuasion" to try to get Syrian President
 Asad to adopt a more impartial position
 toward the Christians and Muslims in
 Lebanon, and at the same time have been
 pressing the Palestinians to be more ac-
 commodating with the Syrian leadership.
 The Soviet official added that the re-
 cent visit to Damascus by Vladimir
 Vinogradov, the cochairman of the
 Geneva conference on the Middle East,
 was meant to put pressure on Syria
 An article in Pravda by Yuri Glukhov
 on September 19 called for a solution to
 the Arab-Israeli crisis as a prerequisite to
 ending the Lebanese civil war. Glukhov
 also emphasized the "urgency" of conven-
 ing  the  Geneva  conference.

 Chinese leaders stand in order of rank at the memorial service in Peking on September 18
 eulogy seemed designed to placate civilian
 and military leaders across the political
 spectrum and reinforced the notion that a
 collective leadership,  composed of
 members of the major contending
 political factions, is now at work.
 Hua included enough references to
 political struggle to appease the party's
 left wing but omitted explicit mention of
 some of the leftists' pet programs, a move
 that undoubtedly pleased the right. As he
 did in his first public speech on September 25X1
 I, Hua went out of his way to praise the
 military.
 Virtually the entire party Central Com-
 mittee was in Peking during the mourning
 period, but most Central Committee
 members from the provinces returned
 home before Mao's funeral, thus failing to
 make use of an opportunity to hold a Cen-
 tral Committee meeting to discuss the
 succession issue. Party leaders may have
 postponed the potentially disruptive
 meeting in order to preserve the facade of
 unity displayed since Mao's death.
 The contending political factions may
 be playing for time in hopes of strengthen-
 ing their positions, and one of them may
 push for a meeting when it feels sufficient-
 ly  strong.  More conservative leaders
 would like to continue to tone down the
 campaign against Teng 1-lsiao-ping and
 emphasize production themes. Leftists
 will probably try to rejuvenate the cam-25X1
 paign in an effort to discredit a number of
 rightists on the Central Committee.
 NORTH KOREA - UN I~ IG~
 North Korea, in a sudden turnvout,
 has withdrawn its draft resolution from
 the UN General Assembly's agenda.
 South Korea has followed suit. The North
 Korean decision appears to be a tactical
 one and does not mean that the com-
 munists are abandoning their long-stand-
 ing effort to build international pressure
 against the US presence in South Korea.
 The North Koreans probably detected
 some weakening in the support for their
 position at the UN this fall. Last year two
 conflicting  Korean  resolutions  were
 passed, and the North was hoping this
 year to achieve an outright. defeat of
 the South's resolution.
 A number of recent developments had
 improved the prospects for passage again
 of South Korea's resolution. These in-
 clude:
 ? The unusual display of dissent
 registered by 23 countries against
 North Korea's position at the non-
 aligned conference in Sri Lanka.
 ? An improved pro-South lobbying
 effort.
 ? The lack of enthusiasm among
 North Korea's traditional supporters
 for the harsh language of this year's
 draft UN resolution.
 ? Adverse publicity stemming from
 the Panmunjom incident in
 mid-August.
 Although the move to defer debate runs
 sharply counter to North Korea's original
 objective, the North is already pointing
 to the decision as evidence that it is
 the responsible party seeking a reason-
 able approach to the Korea issue. North
 Korea took a similar line in the after-
 math of the Panmunjom incident last
 month.
 CHINA
 15-/f
 With the nine-day mourning period for
 Mao Tse-tung now over, the Chinese
 leadership has apparently decided to try
 to return to business as usual and to post-
 pone temporarily efforts to arrange a
 successor leadership.
 The top party personalities, arranged in
 strict protocol order, stood together
 before the Chinese people at the memorial
 service on September 18 for the first time
 in more than five years. Mao's unpopular
 wife, Chiang Ching, took her place in the
 lineup and was accorded no special public
 treatment by other leaders as the Chair-
 man's widow.
 Premier and party first vice chairman
 Hua Kuo-feng, who is now the de facto
 party leader, delivered a carefully bal-
 anced eulogy that avoided the excessive
 praise lavished on Mao at the height of
 the cult of personality in the 1960s. The

 USSR-JAPAN z 3 -Z,
 The Soviet decision to attack the
 Japanese government publicly both for its
 handling of the MIG-25 incident and for
 an unprecedented trip in early September
 by the Japanese foreign minister to the
 area of the Northern Territories is intend-
 ed to put the onus on Japan for the
 deterioration in Soviet-Japanese
 relations. The Soviets probably hoped to
 elicit some conciliatory gesture from
 Japan, such as restricting US access to the
 MIG-25 or hastening the plane's return to
 the USSR.
 Soviet tactics have not succeeded. Even
 before Moscow went public with its
 criticism of the Japanese, Tokyo had
 suggested that a more conciliatory Soviet
 tone-along with a satisfactory explana-
 tion by Moscow of the MIG-25 in-
 cident-was in order. Joint US-Japanese
 exploitation of the plane is now under
 way, and the director of Japan's Defense
 Agency has justified Tokyo's thorough
 examination of the aircraft by citing the
 need to improve Japan's air defense
 capabilities.
 The MIG-25 incident has tended to
 obscure recent exchanges between the
 Soviets, the Chinese, and the Japanese on
 the Northern Territories. In July, the
 Japanese, in effect, asked the Chinese to
 stop supporting Japanese claims to the
 Northern  Territories because Japan
 regards the problem as a bilateral matter
 between Moscow and Tokyo. The foreign
 minister's trip may not have been made so
 much to antagonize the Soviets as for
 domestic political purposes and to
 demonstrate to the Chinese that Japan
 can handle its own problems.
 Moscow clearly does not see it that
 way. After Japan announced the trip, the
 Soviets informed the Japanese that
 henceforth the group of Japanese who
 visit the Northern Territories annually to
 pay their respects to the graves of their
 ancestors must have passports and visas.
 Until now, the Japanese have been ad-
 mitted to the Northern Territories simply
 with their Japanese identity cards. The
 Japanese have refused to comply with the
 Soviet demands and canceled this year's
 visit.
 Some Japanese are interpreting the
 Soviet seizure two weeks ago of three
 Japanese fishing vessels in the waters near
 the Northern Territories as Soviet retalia-
 tion for the foreign minister's trip. The
 Soviets, however, seize about 50 Japanese
 fishing boats a year for violating Soviet
 territorial waters, and the most recent
 seizures may have been coincidental.

 Maltese Prime Minister Mintoff's
 Labor Party won a close but decisive vic-
 tory over the opposition Nationalists in
 the parliamentary election on September
 17 and 18.
 The official count is likely to give
 Labor about 52 percent, which will
 translate into a three-seat majority for
 Mintoff in the new parliament. This is
 more than enough to guarantee the con-
 tinuation of a strong Labor government
 for the next five years, given Mintoff's
 tight control of his party and the unwaver-
 ing loyalty of the Laborites in parliamen-
 tary votes.
 The result is a personal triumph for
 Mintoff, and he will interpret it as a man-
 date to continue his controversial foreign
 policy aimed at avoiding alignment with
 either the US or the USSR. Since taking
 office in 1971, Mintoff has gradually
 loosened Malta's traditional ties to the
 UK and NATO and has sought to extract
 bilateral pledges of economic assistance
 and guarantees of Maltese neutrality from
 nearby Arab and European countries.
 In recent months, Mintoff has directed
 his appeal mainly to Libya, Algeria,
 France, and Italy. Paris and Rome have
 temporized,  but  Libyan  President
 Qadhafi and Algerian President
 Boumediene gave him public pledges of
 support in late August.
 With the election behind him, Mintoff
 is likely to push harder for commitments
 from the French and Italians. Some
 Italian officials, including Rome's am-
 bassador to Malta, are reportedly lob-
 bying on behalf of Mintoff, but the An-
 dreotti government is probably too preoc-
 cupied with domestic problems to for-
 mulate an official response any time soon.
 There are signs that the French are in-
 terested in finding a way to guarantee
 Maltese neutrality, although Paris would
 probably want to avoid a treaty to that
 Supporters, with poster of Prime Minister Mintoff, celebrate victory
 effect, as suggested by Mintoff. The
 French have apparently concluded that
 there is no real prospect of tying Malta
 firmly to the West and that some form of
 guaranteed neutrality might be the best
 way to prevent the USSR from gaining
 substantial  influence  in  Malta.
 The opening of the Italian Parliament
 next week will mark the beginning of a
 crucial round of political maneuvering in
 which the legislature will be a more im-
 portant political arena than in the past.
 Prime Minister Andreotti's Christian
 Democratic minority government was
 able to take office last month only
 because the Communists agreed to aban-
 don their traditional opposition status and
 join the Socialists, Social Democrats,
 Republicans, and Liberals in abstaining
 on his parliamentary confidence vote.
 Because none of these parties is
 represented in Andreotti's cabinet, the
 final shape of the legislative program will
 be influenced, more than in the past, by
 parliamentary debate-in which the Com-
 munists have the potential to play a domi-
 nant role.
 Many Christian Democrats fear that
 their party could easily slide into a
 legislative accord with the Communists
 that could eventually set the stage for
 Communist chief Berlinguer's "historic
 compromise"-a governing partnership
 between the two parties. Christian
 Democratic leader Zaccagnini underlined
 this problem in a major address this week,
 in which he said that the new situation
 required the closest possible liaison
 between the party's leadership and its
 parliamentary delegation.
 Meanwhile,  Republican leader La
 Malfa-whose party joined the Christian
 Democrats   in  most  previous
 coalitions-has provoked considerable
 controversy by asserting that the "historic
 compromise" has already occurred, for
 all practical purposes, and that its for-

 malization is only a matter of time.
 Recent meetings of various Christian
 Democratic groups have demonstrated
 that the vast majority of the party remains
 opposed  in  principle  to  Berlinguer's
 proposal.  The Christian Democrats,
 however, have yet to agree on a strategy
 aimed at avoiding closer collaboration
 with the Communists. They remain at
 odds, moreover, on the broader question
 facing their party: how to establish a
 positive image based on something more
 than anti-communism.
 For their part, the Communists are ap-
 parently having to deal with unease
 among the rank and file over the party's
 indirect support  for a  Christian
 Democratic government. In a major
 speech this week, Berlinguer went out of
 his way to try to convince Communist
 supporters that he is not selling out to the
 Christian Democrats.
 Berlinguer forcefully rejected the thesis
 that his party is becoming social
 democratic and asserted that it would
 continue to pursue traditional communist
 goals within the Italian context. He
 assured his audience that the Communists
 25X1 would insist on a significant policy voice
 now and continue to work for full par-
 ticipation in  the government.

 The Social Democrats will be closely
 watching the progress of the talks in the
 hope of exploiting any signs of a crack in
 the nonsocialist front.  Despite Prime
 Minister Palme's promise to "give them a
 chance," he may try to woo the Liberals
 into a government led by his Social
 Democrats if the nonsocialists appear
 stymied in coalition negotiations.
 If the nonsocialist parties succeed in
 forming a government, the Social
 Democrats, with their strong support in
 the Swedish labor federation, will be a
 formidable opposition. This will become
 apparent in the next six months when
 labor-management bargaining must take
 place on a national scale.
 The Impact Elsewhere in Europe
 Perhaps nowhere in Western Europe
 were the Swedish election results followed
 as closely as in West Germany.
 Chancellor Schmidt's coalition Social
 Democrats, who face a close election on
 October 3, are probably worried that the
 defeat in Sweden may be a harbinger of
 trouble for their own party. Other Euro-
 pean socialists believe there are signs of a
 shift to the right that will help all conser-
 vative parties.
 In Finland, where the five-party coali-
 tion of Prime Minister Miettunen resign-
 ed last week, the Swedish result may
 benefit the local Conservative Party in
 municipal elections on October 17 and 18.
 The Finnish Conservative Party is the
 fourth largest in the country, but it has
 been excluded from government since
 1966 because of Soviet distrust of its
 leaders and policies. The other non-
 socialist parties could also receive a boost,
 and if a new parliamentary election is
 necessary there may be a significant
 change in the composition of the next Fin-
 nish government.
 In Denmark, politicians will watch
 local polls closely in the next few weeks.
 Prime Minister Jorgensen's minority
 Social Democratic government has been
 tolerated by opposition parties for the
 past year because polls had indicated that
 there would be no significant changes in
 The outcome of the election
 September 19 gives Sweden's nonsociq
 parties the opportunity to form their first
 government in more than four decades.
 The Center, Liberal, and Conservative
 parties will have a total of 180 seats in the
 new 349-seat parliament that convenes on
 October 4.  The incumbent  Social
 Democrats and their Communist allies
 won 169 seats.
 The Swedish electorate did not reject
 social democracy but simply asked for a
 respite from the demands of a highly cen-
 tralized government and the constantly
 growing burden of taxes needed to finance
 a comprehensive social welfare program.
 Public concern about the government's
 plans to expand Sweden's nuclear energy
 program may also have contributed to the
 election outcome. Only the Center Party
 has a consistent record of opposition to
 the nuclear energy program and then only
 in recent years. Center Party chairman
 and probable new prime minister Thorb-
 jorn Falldin had originally supported the
 government energy program, but became
 skeptical after studying potential en-
 vironmental dangers. The Liberal Party
 never strongly opposed the energy
 program, and the Conservative Party sup-
 ported it. Both of these parties were big
 winners in the election.
 Once the euphoria of victory has worn
 off, the nonsocialists face the problem of
 reconciling their long-standing differences
 over domestic policies and beginning
 negotiations for a coalition government.
 The apportionment of cabinet posts and
 the need to hammer out policy on a
 number of issues may be difficult. Coali-
 tion leaders may decide to resolve the
 nuclear energy issue by calling a referen-
 dum.

 PANAMA
 0
 Finland's five-party coalition resigned
 last week after it failed to reach agree-
 ment on budgetary legislation. No succes-
 sion is in sight, and Prime Minister Miet-
 tunen has agreed to stay on as caretaker.
 The cumbersome nine-month-old coali-
 tion government,  which included the
 Communists, nearly fell twice last spring
 over economic issues that still plague in-
 flation-wracked Finland. Communist in-
 sistence on a budget that would provide
 for more jobs for Finland's unemployed
 regardless  of its  inflationary  impact
 proved  irreconcilable  with  the  posi-
 tions of most other parties. Although
 the four other parties had a majority
 without the Communists, Miettunen de-
 cided to resign when the Social Democrats
 and his own Center Party disagreed on
 the level of agricultural subsidies.
 There are a number of options open to
 President Kekkonen as he attempts to end
 the impasse; none promises a lasting solu-
 tion. The most likely prospects appear to
 be a reconstituted coalition of the same
 five parties or of the three nonsocialist
 parties and the Social Democrats. If these
 fail, political leaders might try to put
 together a minority government of the
 centrist parties that would rely on support
 from either the Social Democrats or the
 Conservatives, depending on the issue.
 If these schemes also prove un-
 workable, Kekkonen may install a tem-
 porary government of nonpartisan experts
 to govern until a new election can be held.
 Kekkonen may first want to review the
 results of the municipal elections sched-
 uled for October 17 and 18 to determine
 whether another national election would
 be likely to change the current line-up in
 Parliament.
 A decision for an early election might
 be affected by the outcome of the West
 German election on October 3. If the
 West German Christian Democrats do as
 well as Swedish conservatives did on
 September 19, Kekkonen might be inclin-
 ed to delay an election out of concern that
 a swing to the Finnish Conservatives
 might complicate relations with Moscow.
 The government has apparently halted
 the student-incited protests over the cost
 of living that began on September 10.
 Hundreds of arrests, a strong show of
 force by the National Guard, and the tem-
 porary closing of secondary schools and
 the university seem to have quieted the
 situation for the moment. Government
 charges that the US was involved in the
 disturbances appear to have had little im-
 pact despite the wide media play they
 received.
 The protests-the most serious the
 Torrijos government has faced since it
 took power in 1968-attracted support
 from  worker groups and other
 organizations and from the public in the
 poorer sections of Panama City. There
 were millions of dollars of property
 damage but no deaths, largely because of
 restraint by the National Guard. General
 Torrijos was reluctant to crack down on
 the students on whom he has counted for
 support.
 The regime attempted to make the US
 a scapegoat for the disorders, alleging the
 existence of a US "destabilization" cam-
 paign under the direction of intelligence
 agents. Following a familiar pattern, of-
 ficial spokesmen later backed off from
 these accusations, although still conten-
 ding that a group of Canal Zone residents
 hoped to wreck chances for a new treaty
 between the US and Panama. The US
 serviceman arrested in Panama and
 charged with involvement in the distur-
 bances will apparently be released shortly.
 There  is  no  short-term  economic
 upturn  in  sight,  and  plans  to  im-
 pose austerity measures could cause
 further political problems. A new and
 more serious round of disorders may oc-
 cur, and efforts to blame the US for
 Panama's troubles are likely to be

 President Sadat sees Lebanon as the battleground for
 leadership of the Arab world, and he thinks Egypt is losing
 there to Syria. Sadat's rivalry with his Syrian counterpart is
 affecting his perspective on a variety of issues.
 sc  6,--2  c7
 tinues to devote the' major portion of his
 attention to developments in Lebanon,
 where Egypt's rivalry with Syria is being
 played out. Lebanon is the battleground,
 in Sadat's eyes, for the leadership of the
 Arab world-and Egypt is losing.
 In the two years following the 1973
 war, Sadat conducted Egypt's foreign
 policy with confidence and an
 ability-shared by few of his fellow Arab
 leaders-to chart a long-range strategy.
 Egypt's isolation from the rest of the
 Arab world following the second Sinai
 agreement in September 1975, however,
 and its inability to counter Syria's rising
 influence have left Sadat floundering.
 Sadat prides himself on his ability to
 act rather than merely react, but under
 present circumstances he seems unable to
 do more than react to Syrian actions.
 Sadat decries the Arab penchant for emp-
 ty sloganeering, but he now finds himself
 in the company of radical Arabs who have
 nothing more in common than the
 negative goal of thwarting Syria. His
 overriding concern is to regain the stature
 he and Egypt have lost, and his policy is
 now affected heavily by his rivalry with
 Syrian President Asad.
 Egypt and Syria in Lebanon
 Egyptian-Syrian  competition  for
 leadership in the Arab world is not new.
 Nor is Sadat's present antagonism toward
 Syria unprovoked. For the past year,
 Syrian officials and Syrian media have
 carried venomous propaganda attacks on
 Egypt: Sadat's Rivalry with Syria
 Egypt and Sadat personally, asserting
 that signing the Sinai agreement with
 Israel amounted to "treason" to the Arab
 cause.
 The Egyptians' response has gone well
 beyond a mere defense of their position,
 however. Egyptian statements have open-
 ly advocated Asad's overthrow, declaring
 in tones that approach hysteria that the
 Syrian army is certain to "tread upon"
 the Asad regime for its "shameful" ac-
 tions in Lebanon.
 Sadat is actively attem  in  to thwart
 Syria's course in Lebanon.
 Egypt's political outlook is fundamen-
 tally opposed to that of the leftists it now
 is arming, and Egyptian policies would
 not be served by the rise of a radical
 government in Lebanon. Early in the civil
 war, in fact, Egypt sympathized with the
 Christians because it was concerned that a
 Muslim government would prove to be
 too radical. Sadat may calculate that the
 leftists will be unable to seize power even
 with his aid, but he no longer appears in-
 fluenced by such longer term con-
 siderations; he supports the leftists simply
 because Syria does not.
 The Egyptians have been attempting in
 the past two weeks to put themselves
 forward as mediators in the Lebanon
 problem, but this seems primarily a bid to
 pre-empt, or at least to share the credit
 for, Syria's mediation efforts. The Egyp-
 tians have thus far carefully selected their
 contacts, ignoring some of the Christian
 leaders-notably  Camille  Shamun-
 whose  acquiescence  in  any  truce
 plan would be essential.
 Sadat is apparently also, despite his
 reported agreement to meet with Asad
 and other Arab leaders to discuss
 Lebanon, still refusing to consider a
 reconciliation with Syria. This is
 something many Lebanese leaders have
 recently said is essential to a resolution of
 the Lebanon crisis.
 The Palestinian Factor
 Syria's  confrontation  with  the
 Palestinians has given Sadat a new oppor-
 tunity to portray himself as the champion
 of the Palestinian movement, a role
 played with success by Asad last fall.
 This too has been motivated largely by a
 desire to counter Syria's progress in
 Lebanon.
 The Egyptians have almost certainly
 been secretly pleased to see Palestinian
 wings clipped. They were themselves at
 odds  with  the  Palestine  Liberation
 Organization over the Sinai agreement
 before the  Syrian-Palestinian conflict
 arose. Egypt has always believed that
 peace negotiations with Israel could
 proceed only if the PLO were under the
 strong influence of the Arab states,
 primarily Egypt.
 Sadat seems to believe that if Syria
 tries to replace the PLO leadership with a
 leadership controlled from Damascus, the
 rank and file of the so-called moderate
 Palestinian organizations will break away
 and turn leftward, upsetting prospects for
 progress in Arab-Israeli negotiations.
 Sadat's attitude toward the Palestinians
 is inconsistent in several respects. He ap-
 parently sees no contradiction between his
 professed fear that Syrian control of the

 SECRET
 PLO would cause a turn toward
 radicalism and his confidence that control
 exercised by Egypt would not have the
 same results.
 Sadat also seems unprepared for the
 possibility that Syria and the PLO will
 reach an accommodation in which the
 PLO is responsive to Syrian influence but
 under something less than full Syrian con-
 trol. In his present state of mind, Sadat
 would be unlikely to maintain amicable
 ties with a PLO closely associated with
 Syria. He is playing an all-or-nothing
 game that could leave him with nothing.
 Irritating His Friends
 Sadat has allowed his competition with
 Asad to dictate his policies in areas other
 than Lebanon. The rivalry has had a
 damaging effect on his relationship with
 his most important ally, Saudi Arabia.
 The Saudis have made it clear that they
 sympathize with Syria's objectives in
 Lebanon, that they support the means
 Syria is using, and that they regard
 Egypt's actions there and its anti-Syrian
 propaganda  as  short-sighted, even
 dangerous. Sadat listens to their counsel
 but does not heed it.
 Sadat is aware that there is little danger
 the Saudis will completely withdraw their
 support. They still place much stock in
 their partnership with Sadat. They have
 made an art, moreover, of avoiding firm
 stands on either side of any inter-Arab
 quarrel and, while they now sympathize
 more with Syria, they are unlikely ever to
 throw the full weight of their support
 behind the Syrians. Sadat has been able
 effectively to exploit this Saudi am-
 bivalence.
 The Saudis do, however, wield con-
 siderable influence by virtue of their
 financial assets and-for reasons related
 both to Egypt's poor financial manage-
 ment and to its disruptive tactics toward
 Syria-they have recently shown a greater
 reluctance to continue doling out money
 to the Egyptians without a political
 return. Egyptian-Saudi ties show signs of
 fraying, and Sadat risks a further
 deterioration in a relationship of critical
 importance to Egypt if he pursues his an-
 ti-Syrian policies.
 DIA does not believe that Sadat
 continues to devote the "major por-
 tion" of his attention to developments
 in Lebanon, and we do not believe that
 Lebanon is the win-or-lose-all arena
 within which Egypt's rivalry with Syria
 is being decisively played out.
 DIA's views are these:
 With respect to leadership of the
 Arab world, Lebanon for, Egypt
 represents a-nolo contendere situation.
 Lebanon traditionally has fallen within
 the Syrian sphere of interest and Syria
 clearly holds the trump cards insofar
 as current Lebanese affairs are con-
 cerned. Egypt does not have con-
 tiguous borders with Lebanon, nor
 does Egypt have the military
 resources, given present cir-
 cumstances, to decisively influence
 events in Lebanon. Egypt has never ex-
 ercised hegemony over Lebanon; thus
 there is no reason why Lebanon should
 be perceived by Sadat as the
 "battleground" for leadership of the
 Arab world.
 Sadat does perceive that Asad'sin-
 fluence has been enhanced by the
 Personal Antagonism
 Governing, and particularly the con-
 duct of foreign policy, are highly per-
 sonalized matters for Sadat. He is jealous
 and protective of Egypt's position of
 leadership in the Arab world and of his
 own personal standing as the premier
 Arab leader. When his leadership is
 challenged-as it now is being challenged
 by Syria-he reacts as if to a personal af-
 front.
 He is allowing his attitude toward Syria
 to affect his perspective on relations with
 Syria's friends. He criticizes the Saudis,
 for example, in sarcastic speeches about
 their financial "generosity."
 He sees Soviet conspiracies with Syria
 where none exist. Finally, he is increasing-
 ly jealous of the US relationship with
 latter's actions in Lebanon, and Sadat
 is certainly concerned about what final
 effect any resolution of the Lebanese
 crisis will have on Asad's influence. At
 the same time, Sadat recognizes that
 there are many pitfalls into which
 Asad may potentially plunge.
 Sadat is a shrewd and very
 pragmatic politician; recognizing early
 on that his ability to influence the
 Lebanese situation was limited, he
 decided that it was not in Egypt's
 national interest to become deeply in-
 volved because there was nothing
 significant to be gained, as compared
 with what could be lost. Since there is
 .much territory yet to cover and there
 are many options open to both leaders,
 DIA believes that Sadat elected a
 "wait and see" strategy.
 DIA believes that Sadat's
 "overriding concern" is that of solving
 Egypt's domestic ills, not the least of
 which is territory occupied by the   25X1
 Israelis. The stature of Egypt in the
 Arab world, while important, is clearly
 Syria, convinced that the !US is urging
 Syria on in Lebanon, and reluctant to talk
 frankly with US officials in Cairo about
 Egyptian attitudes toward the Lebanon
 problem.
 Sadat once talked of his goals for Egypt
 and the Arab world; he talks now in his
 speeches of little else but his hatreds-of
 Syria, of Libya, of the Soviets, of his
 domestic opponents.
 He once avoided direct discussion of his
 leadership of the Arab world, confident
 that he was exercising it b  example; he
 now speaks continual)

 Lebanon's new president faces imposing obstacles; to a
 large extent, resolution of the civil war depends on factors
 beyond his control. Even so, his pragmatism and his commit-
 ment to reconciliation open some new chances for an end to the
 conflict.
 ress ent Ilyas
 The inauguration of President'
 Sarkis on September 23 by no means
 promises an end to Lebanon's civil war. It
 will create some new frictions as alliances
 shift to accommodate the new Christian
 leader, and it could prompt extremists to
 initiate new violence. Over the long term,
 however, the replacement of the intran-
 sigent Sulayman Franjiyah with a leader
 committed to reconciliation opens up new
 chances for ending the conflict.
 In the eyes of many Lebanese, Fran-
 jiyah bears personal responsibility for
 what has happened in Lebanon. He
 became a symbol of Christian "tyranny"
 to the country's Muslim majority. He
 often provided left-wing leaders with
 justification for their militancy and dis-
 couraged  conservative  Muslims  from
 seeking a settlement as long as implemen-
 tation would be under Franjiyah's
 auspices.
 Christian extremism flourished under
 Franjiyah's leadership. He never had a
 broad following, and his often parochial
 viewpoint was easily manipulated by
 former president Camille Shamun and
 Shamun's militant Christian allies. The
 end of Franjiyah's presidency allows those
 Christians seeking a compromise to speak
 out more forcefully against extremism.
 Franjiyah's departure may also provide
 combatants on both sides a face-saving
 pretext for softening positions they know
 to be untenable. Leftist leader Kamal
 Jumblatt has made Franjiyah's removal a
 personal cause and may now welcome the
 chance to temper his militancy as his con-
 servative Druze constituency has been
 Lebanon: Presidential Turnover
 urging. Jumblatt is probably also worried
 about his growing isolation from key
 leftist and Palestinian allies, some of
 whom have been saying that they must
 make concessions.
 With Franjiyah gone, the relatively
 conciliatory leaders of the Christian
 Phalanges Party will be better able to per-
 suade their followers that compromise is
 necessary.
 Franjiyah's determination to serve out his 25X1
 term and came to believe the argument
 that any compromise by the Christians 25X1
 will erode their political dominance. The
 transfer of power to another Maronite
 Christian president should help refute this
 argument.
 Sarkis' Dilemmas
 The psychological impact of Fran-
 jiyah's departure will be an important
 asset to Sarkis and, coupled with his own
 determination to forge a settlement, will
 help create an atmosphere for serious
 peace talks. This effect may be only tran-
 sitory, however, and Sarkis will be work-
 ing not only against time but against a 25X1
 number of serious liabilities.
 As long as this dispute festers, Sarkis
 cannot even begin to cope with differences
 among the Lebanese, and he stands to lose
 stature as the conflict drags on. Although
 the Syrians have recently shown a
 willingness to give negotiations with

 Palestinian leaders one last try, they seem
 no less determined to dictate terms and
 are preparing to take new military action
 if the talks break down.
 The Syrians recognize that new fighting
 could hurt Sarkis, and they would like to
 avoid that if possible. They see Sarkis
 primarily as an instrument for fulfilling
 their own policy goals, however, and not
 necessarily the only one.
 Syria's determination to bring the
 Palestinians to heel has already placed
 Sarkis in an awkward position. Sarkis is
 acutely aware that he must retain the
 respect and confidence of the Palestinians
 if he is to have any chance of negotiating a
 durable peace. On the other hand, he is
 beholden to the Syrians for his election
 four months ago, and he can rely on no
 other source of power to give credible
 backing to his leadership.
 Sarkis has so far been able to dissociate
 himself from the military moves Syria has
 made and to skirt the broader and more
 controversial questions concerning his
 future authority over Syrian troops in
 Lebanon and the conditions under which
 they will be asked to withdraw. Now, he
 will be held responsible for Syria's actions
 in Lebanon and will come under intense
 pressure to establish ground rules for the
 presence of Syrian troops and a timetable
 for their withdrawal.  However deftly
 Sarkis handles these issues, he is bound to
 alienate some key players in the dispute.
 The new President also faces difficulties
 in dealing with Lebanese Christians. He
 has no popular base within the Christian
 community nor is he part of the estab-
 lished  Christian  leadership.  He  has
 started to regroup associates of his po-
 litical mentor, the late president Fuad
 Shihab, but it will take some time for
 him to establish any significant author-
 ity over the existing Christian power
 blocs. Sarkis must remain in the good
 graces of present Christian leaders if
 he is to have any constituency at all.
 At the same time, he must persuade the
 Christians to acknowledge their minority
 status and to accept a diminution of their
 political prerogatives and a more flexible
 approach to the reunification and
 reconstruction of the country. In this ef-
 fort, his most formidable opponent will be
 Camille Shamun.
 Shamun has a long-standing grudge
 against Sarkis stemming from Shamun's
 intense rivalry with the Shihab regime.
 Shamun has never publicly endorsed
 Sarkis and accepted his assumption of the
 presidency only as an expedient for
 protecting the Christians' current alliance
 with the Syrians. Shamun also believes
 Sarkis' efforts to negotiate with the
 Palestinians and the Lebanese left are
 futile and perhaps not in the Christians'
 best interest.
 Sarkis may not be without allies in
 dealing with Shamun. Phalanges Party
 chief Jumayyil criticized with unusual
 sharpness Shamun's blatant manipulation
 of cabinet posts during the final weeks of
 the Franii  h
 Shamun, moreover, may be on a colli-
 sion course with the Syrians who intend to
 play a central role themselves in
 rebuilding the Lebanese government and
 military. Their current cooperation with
 Shamun is for the purpose of cutting the
 Palestinians down to size and of ultimate-
 ly balancing off the strengths of all the
 major combatants. They presumably
 would have no compunction about
 limiting Shamun's power if it begins to in-
 terfere with their own objectives.
 Prospects
 The immediate obstacles in Sarkis'
 path and the sheer magnitude of the task
 before him make his prospects for success
 bleak. Resolution of the conflict to a large
 extent depends on factors beyond his con-
 trol; Lebanon has become the victim of
 broader problems in the Middle East.
 We know little about the approach
 Sarkis intends to take with regard to
 specific issues, but he has already set a
 positive tone. As a Christian., he is no
 doubt committed first to protecting Chris-
 tian interests, but he has nevertheless
 found common ground even with Kamal
 Jumblatt on issues of social and economic
 change. He recognizes his dependence on

 endless wrangling over which side is right
 and which is wrong. It will also help him25X1
 to set attainable goals and realistic
 priorities where there have been none.
 Oil Sales Rising in Volume and Price
 Higher volumes and prices pushed the
 oil bills of non-communist nations to a
 record $60.6 billion in the first half of
 1976. We expect the total cost for 1976 to
 reach $127 billion, 19 percent above the
 1975 level.
 Higher oil import volume accounted for
 more than half the increase in oil bills.
 Imports were 27-million barrels per day,
 compared with 25-million barrels per day
 in the first half of 1975.
 Because of the price hike imposed in
 September 1975 by the Organization of
 Petroleum Exporting Countries, the
 average price of imported oil in the first
 half of 1976 was 9.5 percent above the
 level a year earlier.
 Import volumes in the seven major in-
 dustrial countries-the US, UK, France,
 Italy,  West Germany, Japan,  and
 Canada-in the first half of this year were
 roughly 8 percent above levels a year
 earlier. US oil import volume jumped
 nearly 13 percent.
 Net oil imports of non-OPEC develop-
 ing countries as a group grew to an es-
 timated 3-million barrels per day in the
 first half of 1976, up 10 percent from the
 first half of 1975. Import growth in the
 stronger economies such as South Korea
 and Taiwan has been particularly rapid,
 running close to 20 percent annually. In-
 creasing oil production, primarily in Mex-
 ico and Egypt, has kept the overall
 developing  countries'  deficit  from
 skyrocketing.
 Despite the recent slackening in the
 pace of economic recovery in several ma-
 jor countries, the volume of oil imports by
 the seven major industrial countries in the
 second half of this year will be 1 I percent
 above the volume for the first half of 1976
 and 17 percent above the average 1975
 rate. Stockpiling in anticipation of the ex-
 pected December OPEC price hike will
 account for some of the increase. We ex-
 pect imports by the small developed coun-
 tries to rise by about 2 percent in the se-
 cond half of 1976.
 Prospects Next Year
 In 1977, oil bills will be determined
 mainly by the price decision taken by
 OPEC oil ministers at their December
 meeting. At the 1976 volume, each 1-per-
 cent change in price will have a $1.3-
 billion effect on non-communist coun-
 tries' oil bills. If economic activity con-
 tinues to rise as expected in 1977, the oil
 import bill could reach $152 billion.
 The increase in oil bills next year will
 not be evenly distributed.
 Even without a price hike, the US bill
 would increase by roughly $6 billion in
 1977 because of rising consumption and
 declining production. A 15-percent OPEC
 price rise would add $5 billion, bringing
 the oil import bill to $44 billion next year,
 compared with $32 billion in 1976.
 We expect the volume of Japanese oil
 imports to increase 5 percent in 1977. A
 15-percent rise would boost Japan's oil
 bill to roughly $28 billion next year, com-
 pared with $23 billion in 1976.
 Britain's oil bill will fall substantially
 because of rapidly rising North Sea
 production. France and Italy, which lack
 alternative energy sources, will import
 substantially more oil next year. Import
 bills are likely to rise by about $2.1 billion
 and $1.7 billion respectively. The West
 German bill will rise by $2 billion.
 Canada's net oil import bill will more
 than triple in 1977 because the expected
 5-percent rise in oil demand will have to
 be covered entirely by imports.
 The expected $25-billion increase in oil
 bills next year should not, of itself, prove
 an unmanageable burden for the con-
 suming countries. It will, however, ex-
 acerbate existing economic problems for
 many.
 The higher oil bills will intensify current
 account problems in some countries. Italy
 and France, after achieving near balances
 in their current accounts last year, have
 already seen their balances shift into the
 red.
 The expected oil price hike will also hit
 hard at the current accounts of some
 countries such as Greece and Portugal,
 which have experienced deficit problems
 over  the  last  few  years.

 SECRET
 Emigre terrorists, particularly Croatians, have been a
 thorn in the side of the Yugoslav regime since its inception.
 They have been unable to mount a serious challenge to Presi-
 dent Tito but may try to test the new regime after his death.
 S.
 The recent hijacking of a TWA aircraft
 by Croatian emigre terrorists underlines a
 problem for Yugoslavia as it prepares for
 the period after President Tito's death.
 Emigre attempts to create serious in-
 stability in Yugoslavia are likely to inten-
 sify after Tito dies or becomes in-
 capacitated.
 The emigres, badly divided even within
 their own nationalist sub-groups, have
 never been able to mount a direct, con-
 certed challenge to Tito, but their opposi-
 tion constantly nibbles at the leadership's
 confidence that Tito has created a unified,
 multinational state that will hold together
 when he is gone.
 The regime has tried to intimidate the
 emigres. In the past two years there have
 been at least 11 unsolved murders of
 emigres abroad. Many, if not all, were
 probably ordered by the Yugoslav secret
 police. Yugoslav officials tend to react in-
 temperately to emigre acts of violence,
 often in ways that undermine
 Yugoslavia's case as the victim of
 terrorism.
 Croat Emigres
 The Tito regime's most serious emigre
 problems  are with  the Croatians.
 Organized Croat opposition from outside
 Yugoslavia was led initially by the fascist
 Ustashe, the group that ran the pro-Nazi
 Independent State of Croatia during the
 war. Most of the key Ustashe leaders have
 died or gravitated into smaller, even more
 extreme emigre organizations. With their
 passing, younger emigres of the postwar
 generation-many of whom grew up in
 Yugoslavia-have replaced them.
 Yugoslavia: The Emigre Problem
 The Croat emigre opposition is now
 made up of several major groups, which
 have defied attempts to unite them. The
 current umbrella organization, the Croat
 National Council, resulted from an effort
 two years ago to impose common goals
 and strategies, but it has had rough going
 because of jealousies and the rigid
 autonomist ideals of the four major
 founding groups.
 At present, the Council is reportedly
 torn by sharp disagreements between
 "moderates" and "radicals" over the
 desire of the moderates to break totally
 with the movement's early fascist-Ustashe
 origins, and thus to attract Western sym-
 pathies.
 The Croat National Committee, based
 in West Germany, is a much older
 organization that has also tried to adopt a
 more respectable image. It is affiliated
 with the Croat National Council, but, un-
 like the umbrella organization, its
 leadership endorses violence. On occa-
 sion, the National Committee has even in-
 dicated that it would accept Soviet aid-if
 offered-in overthrowing Tito.
 Several other Croat groups are openly
 terrorist. They provide most of the man-
 power for terrorist attacks on the Tito
 regime.
 ? The Croat National Resistance
 and its unruly offshoot, the Drina
 Group, have conducted attacks on
 Yugoslav officials abroad and have
 carried out bombings and other
 sabotage in Yugoslavia. Yugoslav
 Ambassador Rolovic was assassinated
 in Sweden by the group five years ago.
 ? The Croat Liberation Movement
 (known  by its Croatian acronym,

 Approved For Release 2008/01/31 : CIA-RDP79-00927A011400140001-2
 HOP) is largely made up of younger
 militants with a smattering of old
 Ustashe hands. HOP leaders are
 dedicated and ruthless.
 ? The extremely  radical Croat
 Revolutionary Brotherhood is regard-
 ed by moderates in the National Com-
 mittee as totally unpredictable. The
 Brotherhood took credit for an abor-
 tive guerrilla raid into Yugoslavia in
 the summer of 1972.
 ? The Croat Liberation Army has
 in recent years conducted several
 daring-but unsuccessful-assassina-
 tion operations against prominent men
 in Tito's regime.
 Several other anti-Tito Croat groups ex-
 ist, but they are generally weak and in-
 effective. A number of emigrants have
 made halting efforts to organize a
 nominally communist opposition abroad
 that might attract disaffected Croat
 leaders within Yugoslavia.
 Serbs
 While the Croats are the regime's
 primary concern, Belgrade is also sen-
 sitive about Serb emigres--part icularly
 those who might exploit lingering sym-
 pathies for Draza Mihailovic's Chetniks
 of World War 11. Except for occasional
 actions by a group called Fatherland,
 Organ of Serb Fighters for Freedom, the
 Serb emigres do not often resort to
 terrorism.
 To some extent, Tito's nervousness
 about Serb emigres stems from his failure
 to develop a strong and reliable power
 base in Serbia. The Serbian party has
 been ravaged by several major purges in
 the last decade, and no single leader can
 realistically claim to speak for Serbian in-
 terests. In this vacuum, the emigres have
 been able to pose ready, attractive
 answers without employing the desperate
 measures of their Croat counterparts. At
 least three Serb leaders in exile have been
 murdered in the past two years.
 Terrorism
 Until a few years ago, Croatian
 terrorist groups worked from apparent
 safe havens mainly in West Germany,
 Spain, Portugal, and Australia. Growing
 international revulsion against terrorism
 has complicated their efforts, and many
 terrorists have been expelled or their
 organizations made unwelcome in a
 number of Western countries.
 Most of the funds for the terrorist
 groups are evidently donated by Croat
 organizations in the US and Western
 Europe that on their own do not under-
 take overt actions against Tito's govern-
 ment. Recurring rumors have circulated
 that Croat terrorists have been trying to
 establish links with the Irish Republican
 Army and to attract financial aid from
 Western  governments  or-failing
 that-Libya. There is no evidence that
 they have succeeded.
 We do not know how much support the
 emigres have inside Yugoslavia. The
 evidence of collaboration by resident
 Croatians with the emigres is spotty.
 There is residual distaste among many
 Croatians for Ustashe atrocities against
 Serbs during the war. The assassinations
 of non-Croat  diplomats  abroad
 presumably have kept alive fears that the
 emigres are fanatics.
 Belgrade has tried to counter the
 emigre threat by:
 ? Pressing foreign governments to
 deny them bases of operation.
 ? Undermining the new "respon-
 sible" groups that pose a more difficult
 problem because they usually abide by
 the letter of the law.
 ? Eliminating as many troublesome
 emigre leaders as possible and in ways
 that could set the emigre groups
 against one another.
 ? Identifying and isolating any
 potential sources of support for the
 emigres either in Yugoslavia or among
 the 850,000 Yugoslavs temporarily
 employed abroad.
 These measures may help to ensure that
 no coordinated, strong challenge to the
 Titoist system emerges, but they cannot
 stop terrorism or greatly influence the
 groups that finance and otherwise support
 the terrorists.
 When Tito dies, available evidence
 suggests that the regime will tighten inter-
 nal security controls in expectation of a
 wave of desperate acts by emigre
 terrorists. We expect that the borders will
 be watched closely, special counterterror
 operations will begin immediately, and
 suspected troublemakers will be arbitrari-
 ly detained.
 These steps will provide no guarantees
 against terrorist attacks on Yugoslav in-
 stallations and personnel abroad,    25X1
 however, and they will not prevent
 daring-if suicidal-actions  within
 Yugoslavia itself.
