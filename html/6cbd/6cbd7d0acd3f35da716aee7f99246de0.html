 AUTHOR'S PREFACE
 This title of this booklet is: "Taiwan's Fate."
 The basis and purpose of my.writing this booklet stem
 from my sincere appeal to my countrymen and to all those
 countries of the Free World to increase their vigilance to
 guard against the red political coup instigated, conspired
 and staged by the Communist Chiang Ching-kuo right there
 in Taiwan (Formosa), and thereby to save it from doom;
 and, at the same time, to remove that Chiang Kai-shek,
 stumbling block to the mainland's anti-Communist revolu-
 tionary movements; so as to overthrow as soon as possible
 the Peking regime which has been the chief cause of all
 the world's turmoils today-and finally to seek world peace
 thereof.
 "Taiwan's on the verge of a red political coup crisis!"
 This was not in any way meant to be an alarm-mongering.
 As early as October, 1956 1 have put forth this warning
 to all my countrymen and the whole Free World: "Chiang
 Ching-kuo will hoist the red .(5-star) flat in Taiwan!" Six
 months afterwards, namely, on May 24, 1957, serious
 anti-American riots had broken out in Taiwan which were
 the by-product, directly or indirectly, of Chiang Kai-shek
 as he either encouraged them or directed them from behind
 the scenes.  Since then, and in the course of the past two
 years or so, my such warning has already aroused wide-
 spread attention and apprehensions from all over the Free
 World's top statesmen and leading newspapers.
 As proofs I need only cite two particular instances:
 (a) in a Reuter despatch from London daletined
 August 7, 1958, it quoted The Daily Mail as
 having received reports from Eastern capitals to
 the effect that "a Communist coup was being

 prepared in the Far East     which might he
 either in Thailand or Formosa Y, Taiwan) ";
 (b) U.S. Senator Warren G. Magntson (Democrat,
 Washington) has also openly expressed his grave
 concern towards Chiang Ching*t:uo's pro-Soviet,
 anti-American mentality.
 Perhaps they may be those who would have this to
 say in defence of Chiang Ching-kuo: Today he is an active
 anti-Communist element! Then, as has bi~::n known to all,
 the Chinese Communists hate America Very much.   In
 order to strike at what they thought to b,, their enemies,
 the Americans, Mao Yan-ying, Mao Ts-tung's one and
 only son, took part in the Korean War,, and was at the
 front lines "shooting it out" at the Americans till he him-
 self died in the battle.  If Chiang Ching-uo is truly anti-.
 Communist, why did he not make use of his past Conc.
 munist training as a guerilla fighter and infiltrate into the
 mainland to join the other patriots to t. Le up arms to
 "shoot it out" at the Chinese Communist lie professes to
 hate?
 I appeal to bring about the downfall of Chiang Kai-
 shek-all just for the very sake of anti-Co munism. When
 one opposes Chiang Kai-shek, it does not mean that one
 is opposing the Republic of China, too.  No, sir!  On the
 contrary, one does so in order to preserve and save the
 very destiny of one's country and one's people so that they
 need not be "buried to death" on account of Chiang Kai-
 shek.  Down with Chiang Kai-shek will not affect th,;
 internal security of Taiwan.  As to the of i=ntention "whe-
 ther there would be serious repercussions on Taiwan once
 Chiang Kai-shek is ridded from Taiwan"--at was merely a
 poor alibi, a "cry wolf" to deceive the people on the part
 of those slaves who have all their lives be :i depending on
 Chiang Kai-shek for government posts and for personal

 enrichment.  As a matter of fact, once Chiang Kai-shek.
 is downed, Taiwan, as a base  of  operations  for  anti-
 Communist and recovery of the country, will only become
 even more secured and more stabilised than ever.   And
 never for a moment contend either that America's Commit-
 ment to help defend Taiwan was itself a commitment to
 support Chiang Kai-shek!   By "there's  no  change to
 America's `China Policy' ", it simply means that there's no
 change in America's policy to help defend Taiwan and to
 oppose the Chinese Communist, but it certainly does not
 imply that there'll be any change in America's policy to
 support Chiang Kai-shek, the dictator.  Today, it needs
 only for the Chinese people to outline a way to rid Chiang
 Kai-shek and which will in no way affect the security and
 safety of Taiwan, then there will be no reason,. nor any
 ground, for America, champion of democracy and freedom,
 to continue to tolerate the very existence of this fascist
 dictator Chiang Kai-shek!
 Hong Kong-shop window of democracy, symbol of
 freedom! Although she is a British colony, yet all freedom-
 loving, democracy-loving Chinese people have risked their
 lives to escape from the iron curtain and seek haven (and,
 in a way, asylum) in Hong Kong, under the protection of
 the British Government.  If only Taiwan could have also
 become "shop window of democracy, symbol of freedom",
 then not only the whole China situation, but indeed the
 whole Asian situation, would long  have  been  entirely
 changed!
 Hence, I deeply believe I am not the only one who
 opposes Chiang Kai-shek, but that it won't be long now
 there will be a great number of my compatriots, all anti-
 Communist patriots themselves, who will rise as one to
 bring about the downfall of Chiang Kai-shek!

 TAIWAN'S (FORMOSA) FATE
 - The Crisis of a Red Politcal Coup
 and the Future of China -
 FOREWORD
 The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
 Party announced on December 17, 1958:  "In accordance
 with a request made by Comrade Mao Tse-tung, the Cen-
 tral Committee of the Chinese Communist Party resolves.
 that Comrade Mao shall not again be nominated as a
 candidate for the post of the President of the People's
 People's Republic at next session of the People's Congress
 which will be held very soon."
 Under the affect of Mao Tse-tung's r'clinquishing his
 post as the "President of the People's Rep,:.dblic", dictato,;
 Chiang Kai-shek, who in the course of th past year has
 secretly been urging those delegates to ths: National As-
 sembly who are affiliated with his ruling Kuomintang to
 propose for the amendment of the Constitution in order
 to enable him to be the Nationalist Presidf nt for the rest
 of his life, was forced to declare on December 23, 1958
 during a meeting of the Mainland Recovery Planning
 Board there in Taiwan (Formosa) : "I hereby solemnly
 declare on behalf of our (Kuomintang) Para, and on behalf
 of my (Nationalist) Government that not only we have
 no intention to amend the Constitution, we are even
 opposed to it."
 If the Constitution is not amended, aid amended in
 time, then Chiang Kai-shek will have torelinquish his
 present post (as President of the Nationalist Government
 at Taiwan), too, towards the end of May, 1960, and

 '4pprovehdall?hRreltoareenb90~/e0f'gthlpl-F[?M7tJ1Q0?10130010-9
 election.
 Chiang Kai-shek's statement expressing his "opposi-
 tion" to amend the Constitution immediately brought about
 a very welcome response from Washington official quarters
 on his such decision that at the expiration of his present
 term of duty, he will relinquish his authority to his suc-
 cessor.  The people in general, the press in particular,
 have unanimously sung their praise and approval.  (In
 a speech, Dr. Hu Shih himself has given his unequivocal
 endorsement too!)
 All Kuomintang organs, which  are controlled   by
 Chiang Kai-shek, have, -however, come out openly voicing
 their disapproval to this issue.  The third day after Chiang
 Kai-shek's announcement opposing the amendment of the
 Constitution, already all the Kuomintang-affiliated dele-
 gates attending the annual meeting of the National As-
 sembly still came out adamantly to insist the amendment.
 Furthermore, they have advocated the adoption of certain
 provisional measures which will enable Chiang -Kai-shek
 to continue to be the President of the Nationalist China.
 Such action should well increase the vigilance and con-
 sciousness of the Chinese people and of their overseas com-
 patriots!  Conscious of Chiang Kai-shek's character as a
 man who says and does things differently, and of the
 working style of his ruling clique, they fully realize that
 a dire consequence will befall upon the political develop-
 ment at Taiwan during the year 1959 to 1960!
 CHIANG KAI-SHEK'S POLITICAL TRICK
 Insofar as Chiang Kai-shek's declaration (that he is
 opposed to the amendment of, the Constitution and that
 he would not seek the Presidency again) was concerned,

 while official circles in Washington welcomed. Chiang's de-
 cision that he intends to relinquish his authority to his
 successor at the expiration of his present tern::. the attitude
 of the Chinese people was one of skeptical because they
 knew too well that it was only a mere interlude in a series
 of political tricks that Chiang had been play, ing all these
 years.
 During the past 2-3 years, the Chinese people and
 the Chinese Press' waves of anti-Chiang Kai-r,hek and his
 clique have risen everyday.   Chiang Kai-t"iiek himself
 knew very well that the possibility of his amending the
 Constitution by legal and constitutional mearq~ in order to
 enable him to continue to assume the Presidetkcy was very
 dim indeed.  Hence, even before he made the declaration
 that he opposed the amendment of the Con titution, he
 had already conspired all necessary arrange,nts on the
 question of how could be best preserve his "Etipire" when
 his term of the Presidency would expire toward ; 1960 and
 all his fame and fortune would be gone by that time-
 Chiang Kai-shek's action on July, 1958 iia. appointing
 Chen Cheng to become the Prime Minister (President of
 the Executive Yuan, tantamount to the Cabinet) of his
 Nationalist Government comprised of two sinister tricks:
 one for external purpose, the other for internal =.mrpose.
 External Purpose:   Chen Cheng is the incumbent
 Vice-President, and he is also the Deputy Direct,)r-General
 (Tsung Tsai) of the ruling Kuomintang.  T1c, meaning
 of Chiang's giving the concurrent job of the Ps emiership
 to Chen Cheng in his present capacity as the Vice President
 was to give the Chinese people and their int rnationaI
 friends-especially the people and government 01", America
 -some kind of an illusion, as if he was lendira> support
 to Chen Cheng by asserting and affirming the lat#?r's No. 2

 position and. status in both the Party and the Government,
 so that at the .end of the present term of Presidency, Chen
 Cheng would accordingly and affectively become his suc-
 cessor; and by thus Chiang expects to lessen the suspicion
 and caution the outside world has cast on him during
 the past 10 years for his continuous cultivation of his
 Communist  son  Chiang Ching-kuo.   American  news
 agencies in Taiwan were certainly fooled by Chiang Kai-
 shek when they despatched such report that "the signifi-
 cance of the appointment by Chiang Kai-shek of Vice-
 President Chen Cheng to the Premiership was to establish
 Chen Cheng as his `heir apparent' ".
 Internal Purpose:  Not only Chiang Kai-shek is a
 'dictator, since his retreat to Taiwan he has even trodded
 on the old path of the ill-fated warlord Yuen Sze-kai--
 building up a "family empire".   In  this  great  anti-
 Communist era of ours, however, Chiang Kai-shek after
 all has had to be discreet about it and he just could not
 directly make his Communist son Chiang Ching-kuo as
 "heir apparent".  In the past, apart from making his son
 the head of all secret police, and thus exercising the control
 of all military and political matters from behind the cur-
 tain by means of his secret service men, Chiang Kai-shek
 has never pushed Chiang Ching-kuo onto the front stage.
 But now, with Chiang Kai-shek facing a most unfavour-
 able political environment today, he knows very well that
 at the expiration of his term of the Presidency, when he
 simply would have to withdraw to behind the curtain,
 then it would be time for him to arrange to push Chiang
 Ching-kuo onto the front stage.  However, the fact re-
 mains that Chiang Ching-kuo's position and status (as the
 Secret Service Chief) do not yet qualify him to become,
 when necessary, either as a successrr to the Presidency or
 an acquirer of the Premiership.  And so, Chiang Kai-

 Approved For Release 2003/04/22 : CIA-RDP80R01731 R000200130010-9
 shek has only to employ indirect but inge jiious sideways
 to push up Chiang Ching-kuo.   All  the  followers  of
 Chiang Kai-shek tully apprehend his such thoughts anu
 intentions; and of whom the one who would most obedient-
 ly conform to his thoughts and intentions o as to realize
 his wishes is Chen Cheng.  But then Che o Cheng is an
 ambitious man, too!   Today Chen Chen- and Chiang
 Ching-kuo are the two titular heads of two large groups
 which have been secretly at odds with each other and who
 constitute the bulk of followers surroundin  Chiang Kai-
 shek today.  But Chiang Ching-kuo is, after all, still "the
 Prince", and so, under the yoke of Chi.:xng Kai-shek's
 dictatorship, Chen Cheng would only hav~.~ to obey and
 submit to Chiang's wishes and would not dare to make a
 wrong move about it whatsoever.  The in?,:ernal purpose
 of Chiang Kai-shek appointing Chen Cheng to form a new
 Cabinet was merely to make use of Chen Cheng in order
 to push up his own son Chiang Ching-kuo.  Sure enough,
 Chen Cheng fully understood His Master'`i wish so that
 in forming his Cabinet, he faithfully invited Chiang Ching-
 kuo to join him and, alas, today Chiang Ching-ktilo is a
 member of Chen Cheng's Cabinet.  Should Fine day under
 internal and external pressures Chen Cheijg suce ed to
 the Presidency, then Chiang Ching-kuo, being already a
 Cabinet man, could emerge and form a Cabinet, too, and
 becomes the nation's highest political executive. """"Within

 IS CHIANG KAI-SHEK WILLING TO GIVE UP
 THE PRESIDENCY?
 Having first made all arrangements in favour of his
 Communist son Chiang Ching-kuo, and then openly com-
 butting himself to opposing the amendment of the Con-
 stitution, is Chiang Kai-shek really willing, at heart, to
 give up the Presidency towards 'the expiration of his present
 term`?
 Chiang Kai-shek has made it known that in opposing
 the amendment of the Constitution, he spoke both for the
 Kuomintang and the Government.  In fact, there was no
 need of his making such a statement, because if his ruling
 Kuomintang Government does respect the country's-Con-
 stitution,, then it would be utterly impossible for anyone
 to talk about the amendment of the Constitution in the
 first place.  Everyone knows that during the Kuomintang
 Government's so-called constitutional rule of 11 years'
 tenure, all the doings, political and otherwise, of Chiang
 Kai-shek and his clique have all been unconstitutional.
 With the Constitution never at any time faithfully observed
 anyway, how else could one talk about its amendment?
 The truth is, those who proposed the amendment of the
 Constitution was not due to there being any discrepancy
 in the Constitution itself, but merely due to their wanting
 to amend and do away the 'restrictions stipulated in Article
 47 of ' the Constitution, clearing away thereby the only
 obstacle to enable Chiang Kai-shek to assume the Presi-
 dency- for the consecutive third term.  Those were the
 slaves who have shamefully served their master Chiang
 Kai-shek.  They were also a bunch of corruptive and

 avaricious officials who depended on Chiang Kai-shek to
 enrich themselves with filthy lucre and fra government
 jobs.  And so the real purpose of their stre-n tously launch-
 ing a campaign for the amendment of the t onstitution in
 order to enable Chiang Kai-shek to care, on. with the
 Presidency was merely to continue to cling to him in order,
 also, to continue to enrich themselves.
 Consequently, not only Chiang Kai-she. s declaration
 in opposing the amendment of the Constitution has not
 quieted down the proponents of its amendment, on the
 contrary, a campaign for it is being schemeii and carried
 out with even greater valour.  There are two concrete
 measures which they have been scheming hxu t-d to realize,
 namely: (1) no amendments whatsoever w  be made to
 the Constitution itself, but merely adding a upplementary
 provision to it:   "Chiang Kai-shek will t main as the
 President before the recovery of mainland China"; (2) a
 motion by the Legislative Yuen, in accordariee with Pro-
 vision Two of Article 174 of the Constitution, to formu-
 late a set of measures to suit the requirement:, of an emer-
 gency, and which will be submitted to the . National As-
 sembly for its endorsement, with the equivalent effect of
 virtually amending the Constitution, or something tanta-
 mount to some provisional regulations in limes of an
 emergency, which will nullify the restriction in Article 47
 about the tenure of the Presidency, by having t suspended
 for the duration of an announced period of emergency.
 The first method is now being vigorously pu} sued by the
 National Assemblymen who owe their allegiance to the
 Kuomintang or who are their fellow-travellers, on the pre-
 text that extraordinary times call for special i easure and
 which, in essence, will be a disguised form ,4 Ef amending
 the Constitution.  The second method finds is exponent
 in the person of Taiwan's Supreme Judge, N.;+hih Shang-

 kuen, who wrote specifically on January 15th, 1959 issue
 -of the United Daily in Taipei, expounding,  as  a  trial
 balloon, as a formal interpretation of the Constitution, and
 gave it his blessing and a lead.
 In his special article, Judge Shih specifically referred
 to the various procedures for amending the Constitution:
 (1) a motion to be put forth and carried by the National
 Assembly; (2) a motion to be put forth by the Legislative
 Yuen and which will be eventually endorsed by the Na-
 tional Assembly.  In giving to the above two points his
 diagnosis and analyses, 'Judge Shih gave his interpretation
 of. the provisions in the Constitution.   He opined that
 judging from the present number of the National Assembly-
 men, the stipulation as set forth in Provision One of Article
 74 of the Constitution will utterly rule out the possibility
 of such a motion being proposed and carried out by the
 National Assembly.  However, according to the interpreta-
 tion of Judge Shih on Provision Two of Article 174, he
 emphasized the feasibility of a motion by the Legislative
 Yuen and carried by the National Assembly with their
 respective numbers at the present time.
 Now, being the Supreme Judge of the Highest Court,
 .himself a Kuomintang National Assemblyman, yet Judge
 Shih dared to go against the professed wish of Chiang Kai-
 shek in opposing the amendment of the Constitution, and
 to depart from his position as a non-political, bipartisan
 judicial member of the nation's highest law-enforcing organ
 to give his biased opinions and misinterpreted the Constitu-
 tion thereby violating the Constitution itself.  Why? The
 reason' is simple enough and apparent enough: Judge Shih
 was only performing a dual act of double-talk together with
 Chiang Kai-shek.  It is generally, known -that Chiang Kai-
 shek's declaration of opposing the amending of the Con-
 stitution was merely a gesture and a trick to hoodwink the

 people.  Judge Shih is serving as a slave and an accom-
 plice of Chiang Kai-shek.  It is recalled when Chiang
 Kai-shek nominated him to the Legislative Yuen for his
 present appointment, he met with consider. ihle rebuffs as
 the legislators were critical of his behaviour and a heated
 dispute had ensued.  But, of course, under Chiang Kai-
 shek's thumb, his nomination was finally approved.   No
 wonder now that Judge Shih should become so impatient
 as to rush to express his shameful opinions in the amend-
 ment of the Constitution.  How about Chiwing Kai-shek`?
 He is a facist dictator who would reprunar'3d and punish
 anyone who dares to go against his wish.  if at heart he
 was really an opponent of the amendment of the Con-
 stitution, and one who sincerely no longer sk to continue
 the Presidency, then he would have taken disciplinary
 action to suppress them.
 In all his life Chiang Kai-shek has never said a word
 which he has meant to keep it, nor done anything right
 about it.  But today not only the Chinese j_aeople would
 no longer be hoodwinked into accepting his empty pledges,
 neither would the people of the world at large allow therm
 selves to be fooled by him any more.  In their despatch
 reporting Chiang Kai-shek's professed intention to oppose
 the amendment of the Constitution, the American-owned
 Associated Press has this to say: "Chiang Kai--,hek opposes
 the amendment of the Constitution and does not wish to
 be the President again when his present term expires. It
 is impossible to say whether he really meant to make an
 exit, or he might continue to exercise the control of his
 Government in his capacity  as  the   DireCtor-General
 (Tsung-tsai) of the ruling Kuomintang.  It has been it
 Chinese tradition to seek advance by makirf > a 'retreat,
 and then only to exert himself to carry on ur#der `popular
 demand'.  Judging from past events, the professed inten-

 tion of Chiang Kai-shek to retire will certainly evoke the
 unanimous demand for retaining him from the various
 quarters of the ruling Kuomintang."
 Chiang Kai-shek is  a  selfish  individualist  hero-
 worshipper, one who's devoid of any affection nor loyalty
 for his country and his people, and one who will use any
 means to serve his own end. Therefore, at heart he would
 never be willing to give up the Presidency at the expira-
 tion of its present second term.
 A FAR EAST "IRAQ"
 In the course of the past ten years since the fascist
 dictator Chiang Kai-shek's retreat to Taiwan, he has out-
 wardly tried to show that he has put his confidence in Chen
 Cheng, when actually he has been cultivating with his
 utmost his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, who was sent to Soviet
 Russia at the age of 1.4 to receive their rigid education
 and training, and where he stayed 14 years, returning to
 China when he was already 28, and who, therefore, is a
 model Communist himself, into a Secret Police Chief-
 using him just like Laurenti.Beria was being used, during
 the Stalinist era, in controlling all military and political
 machineries.
 During his stay in Soviet Russia, Chiang Ching-kuo
 had always been an active and model member of the
 Communist Youth Corps (his Russian wife who returned
 to China with him was herself a member of the same
 organization).  Except they are different in names, all
 his doings at Taiwan have been of the Communist pattern
 and Communist style.  In his thoughts and in his actions,
 they have been pro-Communist and anti-American.   In
 Taiwan he criticised, attacked and caused the eventual
 removal and downfall  of  General  Sun  Jih-jen,  an

 American-trained and American-liked West  -)inter, who
 had won praise everywhere for having traine    some 400
 thousand modern armies for Chiang Kai-she.   In May,
 1957, Chiang Ching-kuo directly or indirecti  instigated
 or directed anti-American riots.
 During the critical situations brought alout by th:;
 Chinese Communists' bombardments of the      uemoy off-
 shore islands on May 23, 1958, Chiang Kai-, rjek's Com-
 munist son, this man Chiang  Ching-kuo,  see retly                                      held
 "Peace" talks with the Chinese Communists through their
 emmisary in the person of Tsao Tze-jen.  J t   as Ameri-
 can marines were being landed at Taiwan to ,ssist in the
 defence of this last Nationalist stronghold, Ca.ng Ching-
 kuo made a request to the Chinese Conimu sists to tem-
 porarily cease shelling Quemoy so as to frustrate increased
 landings of American marines at Taiwan,     itich would
 make it more difficult, if not more unfavoural.'le also, for
 him and the Chinese Communists.  At the stiwne time, it
 was Chiang Ching-kuo who has suggested to. the Chinese
 Communists to point their fingers, in their talks at Warsaw,
 at the Americans for being "aggressors" of I .t.iwan: and
 also to demand for the withdrawal from that i ?a not only
 of the American 7th Fleet alone, but of all American
 military powers.
 Let me cite the following three events:

 holding talks with Chiang Ching-lei,. a (through
 his own channel, too, of course), i.: f s only one
 of the latter's most trusted lieutem nts on the
 mainland, and who has written a biography of
 Chiang Ching-kuo.  In recent years n. his capa-
 city as a free-lance, roving reporter, the has come

 to and from Peking and Hong Kong, on one
 hand doing liaison work for Chiang Ching-kuo,
 on the other he's a vanguard of Peking's United
 Front, seemingly having  acquired  the  "con-
 fidencc " of both sides.' During the years 1956/
 1957, it was Tsao Tze-jen who had brought
 about the then, reported "Peace"   talks (the
 American TIMES Weekly has also touched on
 this subject at that time) between Chiang Ching-
 kuo and the Chinese Communists.
 (2) During the crisis along the Taiwan (Formosan)
 Straits in 1958, Chiang Ching-kuo again "in-
 vited" Tsao as a middleman to hold "Peace"
 talks with the Chinese Communists.  In response
 to a suggestion made by  Chiang     Ching-kuo
 Communist Defence Boss Marshal. Peng Teh-
 hwai gave order for the temporary suspension
 of Quemoy shelling for a limited period of two
 weeks-this secret news was tipped off by Tsao
 Tse-jen to the Nanyang Commercial News of
 Singapore (he has on the surface been its Special
 Correspondent) in advance.   From this we
 could see that Tsao had not failed in his con-
 duct with Chiang Ching-kuo, and it also went to
 show the degree of confidence the Chinese Com-
 munist had had in him  (by giving him the
 "scoop")-last but not least, it showed, too, in-
 sofar as their talks with Chiang. Ching=kuo were
 concerned,  the  Chinese  Communists'  "sin-
 cerity", urging whereupon Chiang Ching-kuo to
 take action by going a step forward!

 1958, of Mao Tse-tung's request to relinquish
 his post as the "President of the Fit ople's Re-

 in informing Chiang Ching-kuo well En advance
 on their 2-week cease-fire in the Out moy area,
 the Chinese -Communists had this time again
 notified Chiang Ching-kuo in advance on this
 "decision", through Tsao Tse-jen also, at the
 same time telling him that it was motivated by
 a strong desire to bring about an early reunion
 and unity between  the  Chinese  Communist
 Party and the Kuomintang. They hoped Chiang
 Kai-shek would also give up the ]'residency,
 while Taiwan (Formosa)  will remain  at its
 status quo to be "governed" by ChitLng Ching-
 kuo.  This accounted for the very reason why
 Mao Tse-tung's "decision" was first.;: announced
 by Taiwan.  The Nationalists boasted tL: t they
 had their agents well planted right ir,,- the midst
 of the Chinese Communist Party, which is of
 course sheer "baloney", entirely devd of truth
 and was meantto hoodwink the West only. The
 agents of Chiang Kai-shek had not had the
 slightest idea about the Seventh Plenary Meet-
 ing of the Chinese Communist Party held in
 Shanghai between April 2nd and April. 4th, this
 year 1959.  They also made a wrong report
 that Marshal Chu Teh was to succeed Mao Tse-

 actual event.

 Chiang Ching-kuo himself will not likely succeed his old
 man as the President, then the period between 1959 to
 May,, 1960 will be the year in which Chiang Ching-kuo
 will launch his well-planned, long-anticipated "red ?up-
 rising" aiming at the grabbing  of Taiwan's  permanent
 power.   And if Chiang Ching-kuo should stage such a
 coup this" year, he will have been in a better and more
 favorable position than the one afforded General Kassam.
 when he staged his bloody coup in his country Iraq!
 Chiang Ching-kuo could easily raise high the 5-star Red
 Flag over and in Taiwan overnight even without the
 slightest knowledge on the part of the Americans-this
 would be made readily feasible because of the shield and
 shelter he has enjoyed under 'his old man, Chiang Kai-
 shek, who is himself basically  not  a  staunch  anti-
 Communist and perhaps who is himself anti-American
 also!
 A Far East "Iraq" may take place at any moment
 now, and is in fact in the offing!
 CONCLUSION
 Under the pretext of the cause of anti-Communism
 and to save the fate of the country, Chiang Kai-shek re-
 assumed the Presidency in Taiwan in the year 1950, where-
 upon he issued a manifesto pledging to redeem himself by
 recovering the country and emphasized that it was with a
 repenting sincerity and behavior that he was thereafter to
 strive in the work of anti-Communism and recovering the
 country in order to deliver all his faults.  Yet as evidenced
 by the political measures and the working style he has taken
 and adopted in the course of the past 10 years since his
 re-assumption of the Presidency, not only he has not been
 anti-Communist, on the contrary he became specialized,

 either directly or indirectly, in anti-anti-Como..uni.sm do-
 ings.  Not only he has not strived to recover the country,
 he has even actively endeavoured to build up and bolstered
 his own "little kingdom" of the family-empire s,wl.e.
 Anti-Communism and recover the country is a popu-
 lar and unanimous demand of the Chinese pt ople, it is
 also the first and foremost policy of the State as well as
 the supreme task of the Government.  Chian  Kai-shek
 knows well that with his past perversities which serve con-
 trarily to the interests of the Chinese people's aspirations
 and his crimes which constitute the greatest dagers to the
 country's security, he would no longer be accepted by the
 Chinese people and he would find it impossible; o continue
 to stay on in the Presidency upon the expirai ion of the
 present term.  Therefore he has again resorted to his old
 political trick and made all necessary arrangements to carry
 on with his conduct behind the stage when his ; erm as the
 Nationalist President comes to an end, by placing his own
 son, Chiang Ching-kuo, in the fore-front as the Govern-
 ment's executive.  However, when the U.S. State Depart-
 ment made an open hint in giving support to General Chen
 Cheng as Chiang Kai-shek's successor of strength, thereby
 delivering a "coup de grace" to Chiang Chingl,.uo's ambi-
 tions, Chiang Kai-shek is forced to change hi mind ab-
 ruptly, giving up his original plan of conducting the State's
 national affairs from behind the scene and, it >tead, now
 strives to continue to stay, on at the Presidency ndefinitely.
 Chiang Kai-shek's avowal in opposing the amendment
 of the Constitution is nothing but a trick and treachery
 of the typical "one-step-backward, two-steps-forward" pat-
 tern.  For he has since been exerting, though on the sly,
 his strong efforts, using, whatever means at tits disposal
 and irrespective of any consequences, to achieve his end,

 which is to stay on at the Presidency by amending the Con-
 stitution. (With Chiang Kai-shek representing the Govern-
 ment in opposing the amendment of the Constitution, any
 provisional measures adopted, and approved by either the
 Legislative Yuen or the Congress in an attempt to amend
 the Constitutional would therefore be unconstitutional.)
 Such shameless act and sinful scheme of his will no longer
 be tolerated or pardoned by the Chinese people.  Instead,
 the Chinese people, at the appropriate moment, will arise
 to take positive action disregarding any sacrifices made or
 the President.   Under the circumstance, the Communist
 prices paid to oppose and stop him from continuing to be
 Chiang Ching-kuo will exploit such a most opportune mo-
 ment, also his last chance, to stage a red political coup and
 plant the five-star red flag over Taiwan.
 Some might say: "As to  this  Communist Chiang
 Ching-kuo, not only the Chinese people alone, but the
 entire Free World also will all be keeping a close watch
 on him; what 'is more, the Chinese people as well as the
 American military pledged to defend Taiwan are all in.
 alertness, keeping him in strict surveillance, and which will
 for sure nip his conspiracy to stage a red political coup
 in the bud.  Today ChianChing-kuo's power and posi-
 tion in. Taiwan are wholly-acquired through the personal
 support of his dictatorial father Chiang Kai-shek-with
 Chiang Kai-shek's term expiring in May of next year,
 1960, stop him from continuing to .be the President and
 even down with him, would not the question solved by
 itself?"   Yes,  that's  right.   Since we now know that
 Chiang Ching-kuo has acquired his present power and
 position entirely through his dependence on Chiang Kai-
 shek, then with the latter down, will not the former be
 done for too?    Having to face such an actuality, and in a
 circumstance under which he would have no choice, the

 so Chiang   ing-kuo would have to stage his red
 political coup before his old man, Chiang Kai-shek ter-
 inmates the Presidency.  Furthermore, when Chiang Kai-
 shek's efforts in scheming to amend the Constitution in
 order to enable him to continue to hold ontheoffice having
 met with the Chinese people's opposition and the Free
 World's pressures, and when at the rope's end he would
 find it futile to carry on the fight, then Chiang Kai-shek,
 a person who has always practised a doctrine of "it's better
 wat .t betrayed people than to let them betray me", would
 for sure be secretly harbouring and helping his Communist
 son Chiang Ching-kuo to realize and fulfil his: red political
 coup.  As to the disposition. of Chiang Kai-shti=k, well, the
 Chinese Communists will at that time probable be inclined
 to reality, and in accordance with their agreement reached
 with Chiang Ching-kuo, let the "People's Government" in
 Peking to afford an appropriate position and protection.

 munists and recover their motherland, front post of the
 Free World, bulwark of all the free countrie'; in the Far
 East against Communist threats, and a ring of the entire
 defence chain in the Pacific islands of the Free World.
 When and if Chiang Ching-kuo stages a political coup,
 Taiwan will fall into the Communist hands, then not only
 the Chinese people wit! be deprived of their base from
 which to attack the Communists and recover their mother-
 land, Japan, the Philippines and the whole Southeast Asia
 will be gravely threatened, and America will be chased out
 from the West Pacific.  Taiwan will become the Chinese
 Communists' anti-American front post-they will even use
 the very military supplies which the Americans have fur-
 nished the Chiang Kai-shek government  to  oppose  the
 Chinese Communists regime and turn them loose on the
 Americans themselves, exactly like their using American

 military supplies formerly furnished the Chiang Kai-shek
 government while he was still on the mainland to fight
 and kill the Americans in Korea.  Therefore, the Chinese
 people as much as the Free World should never allow
 t aiwan to fall into the hands of the Communists.  With
 the situation in Taiwan today so complicated, so critical
 and so ' grave, apart from increasing our vigilance to be
 more closely on guard, keep more surveilance and be more
 alert, we must gain time to first remove the crisis of Chiang
 Ching-kuo staging a red political coup in Taiwan, so that
 all concerned need not be caught napping in allowing it
 to became a Far East "Iraq", or that a conflict against
 the Chinese Communists would result from any actions:
 designed to forestall and suppress Chiang Ching-kuo from
 staging such a red political coup, . touching the general
 flare-up of another World War, and let Mankind undergo
 and experience the unpreced.entedly destructive disaster in
 history.
 But, then, how to forestall and remove the crisis of
 Chiang Ching-kuo staging a red political coup in Taiwan?
 We all know that Chiang Kai-shek is the chief culprit
 responsible for the grave crisis over Taiwan today.  We
 need only to gain time and bring about the downfall of
 Chiang Kai-shek and which would automatically remove
 the crisis of his Communist son Chiang Ching-kuo staging
 a red political coup in Taiwan, thereby saving the fate of
 Taiwan from falling into Communist hands.  Chiang Kai-
 shek is not only Chinese Communists' asset in Taiwan?
 he is in fact one of the greatest supporters in strengthening
 the Communist regime in Peking-Chiang Kai-shek is in-
 deed the stumbling block to the anti-Communist revolution
 on Mainland China!

 Mainland, all the cruel political measures, ttiider the dis-
 guise of "reforms", adopted by the Peking. regime have
 aroused the popular dissatisfaction among the A}road masses
 of the Chinese people.  In 1958, the Peking regime took
 a step further in implementing their most inht: tuna experi-
 ment, "the People's Communes", which brokt up China's
 traditional family system.  The China Mair in(l has be-

 people, as a rule, living under the yoke of t rannical re-
 gimes would be submissive and subjective      It first, but
 would explode their revolutions when the op )ression be-
 came too excessive.  At the same time, theta are cadres
 among. the Communist military and political e:als who are
 obsessed with nationalism, especially the leasng class in
 the locals, who, inside their hearts, are opposed to the cruel
 and arrogant doings of the ruling class of the Peking re-

 people who uses his anti-Communism merely as a cover,
 but in all truthfulness a real dictator and a fake democrat,
 to reap their fruitful successes-even  Chiang  Kai-shek
 himself has openly intimated that  he  would   like  his
 countrymen on the Mainland to start a revolution and
 overthrow the Peking regime, and then to sit, with arms
 folded, to reap their triumphs.  The most apparent demon-
 stration is this: when the Tibetans could no longer endure
 the oppression of the totalitarian Chinese Communist rule,
 they rose to engage in the greatest struggle, to win both
 "freedom & autonomy", against the Chinese Communists,
 by couragously staging a bloody and difficult revolt on
 March 10, 1959, in a manifesto issued to the Tibetan com-
 patriots on March 26, Chiang Kai-shek said: "... as long
 as you (Tibetans) are more resolved and courageous than
 ever, and continue to struggle to the bitter end, I shall
 lead the armies and the people of the country to meet in
 junction with you on the mainland."  In other words, in
 the midst of the mainland people engaging in a do-or-die
 anti-Communist revolution, Chiang Kai-shek with his arms
 folded is sitting idly to let it- (the revolution) die a natural
 death.  If the fighting Tibetans could bear it out by being
 more resolved and courageous,  and   by  continuing to
 struggle to the bitter end, by that time their victory will
 probably be in sight or indeed already won-and then
 Chiang Kai-shek under a honeyed pretext will lead his
 bureaucratic clique to meet in junction the revolutionary
 people on the mainland, in reality to "take over" once
 again in the same manner and the same pattern he and
 his clique "took over" the Japanese-occupied  territories
 after the V-J Day (rob, grab, and loot), and thereby re-
 build his "Chiangs' Dynasty", and continue to rule, as an
 old-hand dictator more experienced than ever, the Chinese.

 man uhiang  ai-snnek as China's ruler, ho4.,, could the
 Americans ever expect the people on mainland China and
 those Chinese Communist cadres with an obsession of
 nationalism to promote and stage a revolution' and to sacri-
 fice their blood and heads just to enable Chiang Kai-shek
 to come in to reap the fruits?  How could :Chiang Kai-
 shek, belonging to the old school type of Turk>h monarch,
 be ever suitable to become a Chief of State of a modern
 nation?  No China people would ever accept his control
 and domination.   The  anti-Communist  rP,volutionary
 armies in Tibet have since set up a Provisional Govern-
 ment; even in his anti-Communist declarationmade inside
 Indian territory on April 18, 1.959, no mention whatsoever
 was made of, and in fact there was nothing but contempt
 for, Chiang Kai-shek-were not these solid facts enough
 to serve as proofs?  As a matter of fact, back in a Press
 Conference when touching on the China Problem, the
 former U.S. Secretary of State, Mr. John Fenster Dulles,
 has had this to say:  "If an anti-Communist revolution
 should break out on the mainland, the question of whether
 anybody would be inviting Chiang Kai-shek try lead such
 an anti-Communist regime is itself  a hypothetical  and
 problematical question."
 In implementing his "People's Conirnuness" last year
 (1958), Mao Tse-tung has himself sown the  seeds of
 failures and collapse for the Chinese Cornrnurist regime;
 and when they still wanted to continue to stagier on with
 this system of "People's Communes" for this yv ar (1959)
 under the slogan of "big leap forward for prod:ction", the
 next fiscal year (1959-1960) would see the Chinese Com-
 munists facing their greatest and gravest crisis since the
 birth of their regime at Peking.  Under such a circum-
 stance, it might as well be the most opportun. time for
 the Chinese people on the mainland to stag.-, an anti-

 Therefore, we must actively try to win time to get rid of
 Chiang Kai-shek.  Apart from efforts to eliminate the
 crisis of a possible red, political coup there in Taiwan,
 wnile at the same time, more important still, we must, do
 away with Chiang Kai-shek who constitutes a stumbling
 block to such an anti-Communist movement on the main-
 land, as only thus would such a movement be accelerated
 and advanced inside the mainland iron curtain.  It must
 be taken cognizance that as long as there's in Taiwan a
 Chiang Kai-shek who is still permitted and recognised to
 be China's ruler, a nation-wide anti-Communist revolution
 on a grand scale would never take place on the mainland
 at all-and so, thanks to Chiang Kai-shek, the life of the
 Peking regime would last just as long as that, too!
 During a Press Conference given in Singapore, the
 young Chinese pianist Fou Ts'ong (who escaped from the
 iron Curtain and rushed towards Freedom at the end of
 1958) showed scorn for both the Chinese Communists
 and the Chinese Nationalists and said:  "I am not in
 sympathy with either side.  Most of the Chinese Com-
 munist policies are ridiculous; as to Taiwan, it has not
 done anything good so far for the Chinese people.  For if
 it had, then the Chinese Communist regime would not
 have existed until today."  Another statesman who under-
 stands and appreciates the China Problem well in the per-
 son of Mayor Arsenio Lacson of Manila, Philippines, who,.
 speaking as a member of a panel discussing foreign rela-
 tions over the Columbia Broadcasting System's nationwide
 television programme "Small World" in New  York. on
 March 15, 1959, has this to say to Chiang Kai-shek: "It
 is a tragedy of the Free World that we have to support a
 man like Chiang Kai-shek." - He also asserted that "In
 China, you (referring to the American government) sup- .

 ported a thoroughly rotten, corrupt and Fasc:- t:ic regime
 (meaning Chiang Kai-shek's government in Ta~.van) with-
 out offering the Chinese people  a  democrati=,  alterna-
 tive.
 Under the oppression and enslavement of't e Chinese
 Communist regime, the Chinese people on the mainland
 today have had quite enough and. are at the  id of their
 tethers. It needs only for someone to light up the torch,
 a Hungarian-pattern anti-Communist revolution would
 spread and sweep the whole country in no time.    By
 that time, a great number of those Chinese Communist
 armies would also take to defection, join the anti-Com-
 mun.ist revolution of their Chinese compatriots,                                   march
 pointedly towards Peking, and., in one  triumphant and
 successful stroke, overthrow the Chinese Cori; nunist re-
 gime.  China is a vast country-all her conditions and
 circumstances, geographical, political, militaryilnd econo-
 mical, are entirely different from those of Hungary, there-
 fore the outbreak and outcome of  a                                      nation:ide anti-
 Communist revolution on the mainland would not be a
 second Hungary.  By that time Soviet Russia ';.ill not be
 in a position, nor have the strength to interfere, and sup-
 press the anti-Communist revolution movement  of the
 Chinese people.   At the same time, under the iiluence of
 such anti-Communist revolution on the part of the Chinese.
 Communists, the Kremlin will probably guard,  th its full
 efforts, against any potential and probable outbreak of
 similar movements (anti-Communist  revolutionn)  inside
 Soviet Russia, and she would not be able or dare, all the
 more, to interfere into China.  Hence, by prom Ling revo-
 lution within Communist Chinese to overthrow the Chinese
 Communist regimes, there will be no danger, nor risk, of
 touching off a third World War, so to speak!

 "To promote revolution within Communist Chinese
 to overthrow the Chinese Communist regime" has become
 the most effective means as recognized by the world over.
 Today the Chinese Communists are taking all sorts of
 measures which serve only the purpose of destroying them-
 selves, the 'crisis of their economic difficulty as well as
 their internal instability is becoming more and more serious
 everyday.  Furthermore, their brutalities as reflected in
 their violent actions against the Tibetans have exposed
 them to the world at large as a frightful new imperialist.
 Their lies which used to hoodwink the world are being
 unmasked, and they have become more and more isolated
 from amongst the world's communities.
 Today on the mainland, the subjective conditions as
 well as the objective circumstances as required by the
 Chinese people to promote, and stage a popular anti-
 Communist revolution were ripe and ready and there--
 the only obstacle to it is to merely wait for the Chinese
 people both in Taiwan and in overseas to take concerted
 actions and rise as one to "down with Chiang Kai-shek",
 thereby do away with the stumbling block to the main-
 land's anti-Communist revolution movements.  (As early
 as in 1956 the author has put forth "The Ways to Solve
 the `China Problem' "-in which I strongly advocated for
 the "retirement" of Chiang Kai-shek,  abolition of  the
 system of Presidency, revival of the old organic law of the
 Nationalist Government, so as to open the door in admit-
 Ling the return of the Chinese Communists to the coopera-
 tion of an enlarged coalition government, thereby remov-
 ing any likely obstacles which will hinder the uprisings and
 defections  of  those  nationalist-minded Chinese Com-
 munist cadres as well as  high-ranking  military  officers.
 Judging from the development. on the China Mainland
 during the past three years, if my such formulae have been

 put into practice, even step by step, I would dare say that
 not only the situation of China today would have substan-
 tially changed already, Mao  Tse-tung's  Peking  regime
 might have become a passing word and a forgotten name
 by now.)
 For the sake of saving Taiwan from its fait of falling
 into the hands of the Chinese Communists, for the sake
 of realizing as early as possible the wish of ocrthrowing
 the Chinese Communist regime, for the sakes of seeking
 world peace, all of us are duty-bound, and from which
 none could shrink or retreat, to arise, most positively, to
 bring about the eventual downfall of the fascist dictator
 Chiang Kai-shek!
 (N.B.-As to what concrete steps ought to be taken
 in order "to bring about the downfall of Citiang Kai-
 shek", eliminate this "stumbling block" to all anti-
 Communist revolutions on the mainland, which would
 be workable and yet would not in any wa  affect the
 security and safety of Taiwan-as well as a detailed
 "blueprint" for a future China--the author regrets
 that they will not, for the time being, andx'or certain
 reasons, be included in this booklet, and for which
 I beg to be excused by my readers.)
