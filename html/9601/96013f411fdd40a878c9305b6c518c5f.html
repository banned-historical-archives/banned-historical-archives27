 Msxxism does not tell the proletariat to turn away
 from the bourgeois revolution, or to refrain Pram par-
 ticipating in it, 'or to give its leadership to the bour-
 geoisie.  On the contrary, it tells the proletariat to
 participate in the bourgeois revolution with all its
 ,might, to fight with the'greatest determination and eon-
 .sistency far proletarian democracy, and to carry out the
 revolution to the very end.  We cannot deviate from the
 framework of bourgeois democracy in the Russian revolu-
 tian, but we can. expand this framework.  Within its
 limits we can, and must, fight far the interest of the
 .proletariat, far achieving its immediate needs, and for
 creating conditions for training the proletarian forces.
 '~in preparation for our eventual, complete triumph.
 :When the,proetasiat achieved the bourgeois democratic revolution in
 Russia;, it must mean, according to Lenin,_ that the "revolutionary demo-
 cratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasants" had been estab-
 lashed.  Defining "decisive victory ,over Tsarism" as "revolutionary demo-
 ~x~atic dictatorship of the, proletariat and the peasants," Lenin stressed
 't3~e foll,awing three paints in regard to the nature of this revolutionary
 d3Ctatorship and its relationship to a world revolution:

 demr~cratc revolution.

 Fuat*tlier summarizing these points, Lenin showed the general course-for the
 Rtzss~.an revvolution., from a democratic revolution to a socialist revolution.,
 3as the '' fol~.owing remarks

 or a proletarian saciallist revolution?  Evidently,
 `it`is the former, not the latter.
 Since Chinese society is still a colonial, semi-
 colonial, or semifeudalistic society, and since im-
 perialism and feudalistic forces still remain the
 chief enemies of the Chinese revolution, what the
 Chinese revolutionaries must achieve is a nationalist
 revolution and a democratic revolution to beat these
 two chief enemies.  The revolutions for beating these
 `:two enemies may sometimes be participated in by the
 nationalist bourgeoisie, and even if the brig bour-
 geoisie turm.s against the revolution and b~c~mes its
 enemy, the target of the revolution nevertheless will
 ~'be imperial:ism and feudalism, and.-not-capitalism in

 they both seek to achieve bourgeois democratic revolutions in backward coon-
 tries under proletarian guidance and to obtain the best conditions for transi-
 ~ionto a socialist revolution.  And in this point, we may safely say, lies
 `'the theoretical and practical core of the Communist movement after. Lenin.
 Now,-how ".revolutionary democratic dictatorship by the proletariat and
 tk~e peasants" should pave the way for transition from a democratic revolution
 tea a socialist revolution has remained unanswered, for, a#`ter his April 1917
 Lenin converted himself to the proletarian dictatorship theory with-
 ~otat waxning  Mao Tae-tung, on the other hand, made public a thesis entitled
 "()n the .Peoples Democratic Dictatorship" on 1 duly 199, right before the
 establishment~:of the Peoples Republic of China, and. made. clear (1) that the
 ;peoples democratic dictatorship should_be based on an alliance of the workers,
 ;peasants, and urban petty bourgeoisie (primari'ly on an alliance of the workers
 and pea,sants):and (2) that under the peoples democratic dictatorship China
 would :shift from neodemocracy to socialism.  Mao Tse-tung's ".peoples demo-
 cratic.dictatarship" is another nra~me for Lenin's "revolutionary .democratic
 'dictatorship.hy the proletariat-and the peasants," but one difference between
 that. t&e former seeks not merely to achieve a democratic revolution
 and thus pave the way for a socialist revolution but also to-achieve transi-
 tion to socialism.:  This presumably. comes from the-;fact that;, whereas, Lenin
 hai3 theprernise' that a backward, agricultural country like- Russia cannot
 alone shift'to socialism, Mao had the conviction -that his Country's transi-
 tc~a to socialism was possible with Soviet experience and assistance.'

 'China may be found, in my opinion, on the following trae points.  We will eon-
 eider these in detail mainly through-the .analysis of Maoism.
 Emphasis on the Heritage of China
 dne of the major features of Maoism is an emphasis on the,fact that China
 has a history of thousands of years and peculiarities of its own and therefore
 a stress Qn-the need :for adapting the theories of Marx-Leninism to the actual
 circumstances of China.  In a report entitled "The.Position of the. Chinese
 :Communist. Party in the National War," made at a general meeting of the Central'
 Committee,iri October :1938, Mao Tse-twig asserted that- the Chinese Communists '
 "should not merely understand the conclusions on general laws drawn by Marx,
 Lenin, and Stslin from the arxal~sis of their wide experience in~actual
 `7.ife`and revolutions taut also should learn from what viewpoints and in what
 mann.ex's they studied and .solved their problems." 11   He also said a little
 late:C~ speaking enrpha~tically for the, historical heritage and peculiarities of
 Ciur people have a history of thousands of years.

 In, .spite of this self-analysis by Lorain, Stalin's view that "Leninism is
 M~rx~cism in the stage of imperialism and the proletarian revolution" became the
 o~f'icial definition of Leninism.  Before making this definition, Stalin crib-
 e~Lzed the other definition that."Leninism is. Marxism adapted t,a the peculiar
 ~c~nditions of the situation in Russia" and stated:
 This definition contains same truth but not the,
 whole truth.  Zt is true that Lenin applied Marxism
 to the realities in: Russia, and that ingeniously..  But.
 if Leninism were nothing mere than an application of
 :'Marxism tv the special environment in Russia, Leninism
 would be purely a one-nation ideology and nothing more.
 -than. that, or purely Russian and nothing more than
 'Russian.  We know, however, that Leninism is an inter-
 national ideology with roots in international develop-
 men.ts as a whale and not a simply Russian ideology.
 In my opin:i.on, therefore, this definition is partial
 snd: faulty.
 Although in-:the ease of Leninism the emphasis is thus on internationality
 and universal-applicability, the peculiarities and historical heritage of
 China. are .stressed in :Maoism.  Even in Maoism the international nature of
 the ideology is not neglected, for it "will make it-rpvrtant, useful contribu-
