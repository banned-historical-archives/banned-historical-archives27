 France: Photo Finish .
 The French presidential hopefuls are coming
 down to the wire in a dead heat. Giscard and
 Mitterrand are both flailing about in search of
 new issues, endorsing everything from minimum
 wages to indemnification of czarist bonds in a
 last-ditch effort to win the crucial floating votes
 that will decide the election on May 19.
 Some of the most recent polls show voters
 split 50-50. Rival polls have put Giscard mar-
 ginally ahead, but the race will obviously be a
 close one. Should the election be as close as
 predicted, the outcome may hang on the 2.6
 percent overseas vote, which wil, delay the ver-
 dict.                           in the event of
 a "photo finish"-one percent or less-ballots will
 be recounted. This procedure could cause a three-
 day delay in the publication of the official results.
 25X1     The ideolcgical views of the two candidates
 differ sharply, but the distinctions between their
 platforms have gradually become blurred as both
 Giscard and Mitterrand have sought to appeal to
 as broad a spectrum of voters as possible. Giscard
 has wooed the working class and suggested a
 minimum wage of $240 a month, while Mitter-
 rand has promised that he has no intenti_ i of
 increasing the taxes of middle-level executives or
 of fiddling with their private pension schemes.
 Both are for "change" and their slogans are al-
 most identical: Mitterrand-"A president for all
 the French"; Giscard-"The president of all the
 French."
 The most distinctive features contained in
 the "common program" Mitterrand has nego-
 tiated with the Communist and other leftist
 parties are the nationalization of eight or nine
 giant industrial firms and the state control of
 private banks and insurance companies. Mitter-
 rand has asserted that he would draw the line
 there, and that he does not favor wholesale na-
 tionalization.  By raising the spe +or of even
 limited nationalization, however, Mitterrand has
 driven many centrist political leaders, including
 Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, and their fol-
 lowers reluctantly into Giscard's camp.
 The televised debate between the candidates
 on May 10 was generally conceded a draw, but
 during his concluding remarks Giscard struck a
 significant blow when he accused Mitterrand of
 being a man of the past-a man, by implication,
 who not only represents an outdated socialism,
 but who also refuses to grapple with the effects of
 his  "common program" on  France's future.
 Earlier Giscard had characterized his own first
 round victory as the birth of a "great wave of
 youth and enthusiasm."
 Giscard is considered by many Frenchmen
 to have a better grasp of the complexities of
 modern society-to have judged more accurately
 the pulse of contemporary France, which he sees,
 not as a society of classes, but as an industrialized
 "national collectivity." Giscard is gambling that
 the prevalent French mood is a desire to change
 the  existing society, not to create a  new

 Portugal
 A broadly based coalition government that
 includes two communists was sworn in this week
 with the avowed aim of guiding Portugal into a
 democratic era after nearly 50 years of authori-
 tarian rule.
 It is a provisional government that will rule
 only until elections are held sometime before
 April  1975.  The military junta, which seized
 power last month, will roonitor the government's
 activities. Under an interim constitutional decree
 issued this week, the armed forces w,  be com-
 pletely independent from the government. The
 armed forces chief of staff General Costa Gomes
 will have equal status with the prime minister.
 The 15-member cabinet arpears to have rep-
 resentatives from all portions of the political spec-
 trum, although the absence of political parties in
 Portugal for so many years makes it difficult to
 pinpoint political affiliations. The foreign, justice,
 and information ministries went to members of
 the Socialist Party. Alvaro Cunhal, secretary-
 general of the Communist Party, was named min-
 ister without portfolio, and another Communist
 official was appointed minister of labor.
 The new prime minister is former bar asso-
 ciation president  Adelino da Palma Carlos, a
 wealthy lawyer and professor who has not been
 aligned with any political party. His political phi-
 losophy is thought to be right of center.
 General Spinola, who assumed the office of
 President on May 15, remains the most powerful
 man in Portugal. In his inaugural address, he
 warned  against  excesses  and  bestowed lavish
 praise on the Armed Forces Movement. Ile was
 especially  complimentary  to  the  "younger
 cadres" whose "nobility," he said, "rescued the
 country from national tragedy."
 In contrast to the blandishments Spinola lav-
 ished on the younger officers, the junta an-
 Page 2
 pounced yesterday that 42 senior officers had
 been placed on the reserve list, bringing to 66 the
 number of high-ranking officers who have been
 purged since the coup. Among those purged Eire
 several prominent conservatives who do not sup-
 port Spinola's notions of self-determination for
 the African territories.
 These members of the Portuguese provisional government
 and their offices are: (L, front to back) Alvaro Cunhal,
 Communist, minister without portfolio; Mario Soares, So-
 cialist, foreign minister; Avelino Pacheco Goncalves, Com-
 munist, minister of labor. (Centex) Raul Rego, Socialist,
 information minister. (R, front to back) Adelino da Palma
 Carlos, nonaigned, prime minister; Manuel Roclra, non-
 aligned, minister of public works; and Francisco Salgado
 Zenha, Socialist, minister of justice.

 In his address, Spinola repeated many of the
 promises for a more open society that he made
 immediately after the junta seized power. He also
 stressed that minorities "whether they be here or
 in Africa" should not interfere with the demo-
 cratic process. He did not identify the minorities,
 but in Africa it cc Id apply both to the white
 settlers and the brick insurgents. At home, he
 probably was referring to leftists who have moved
 to take over local government offices and por-
 tions of the business community.
 The new provisional government in Lisbon
 faces a wide array of problems in the African
 territories. The insurgent movements have either
 rejected outright Lisbon's offer of a cease-fire, or
 they have proposed conditions the Portuguese
 may find hard to meet. Some white settlers,
 meanwhile, are voicing concern over Lisbon's in?
 tentions in the territories, and there have been a
 few incidents between blacks and whites.
 On May 13, leaders of the insurgent move.
 ment in Portuguese Guinea announced that they
 were prepared to begin negotiations with Lisbon
 "with or without a cease-fire." The rebel offer,
 which gives both sides considerable leeway, in-
 cluded the condition that Lisbon recognize the
 "right of independence" for the "Republic of
 Guinea-Bissau," proclaimed by the insurgents last
 fall, as well as tor the peoples of Angola and
 Mozambique.
 The junta termed the offer "constructive."
 The newly formed government in Lisbon will give
 it careful consideration, but may find it difficult
 to accept all the rebel conditions. Lisbon prefers
 to deal with the three territories separately, and is
 likely to make its response applicable only to
 Portuguese Guinea. So far, the Portuguese Gov-
 ernment has offered the insurgents an equal
 chance with newly emerging political organiza-
 tions to determine the future of the territories.
 Lisbon has recognized the territories' right of
 self-determination, acknowledging the risk of
 eventual independence, but it hopes for a close
 federation with them, particularly with Angola
 and Mozambique.
 On the same day the Portuguese Guinea
 rebels made their offer, Angolan and Mozambique
 insurgent leaders and representatives of black
 African governments supporting them, meeting in
 Dar es Salaam, called for increased military activ-
 ity by the rebels. In Mozambique, the rebels have
 recently intensified military action in the central
 part of the territory, an area of heavy white
 settler concentration, following a brief lull after
 the coup last month in Lisbon..
 Unrest is high in the area as a result of the
 insurgency and an economic decline. A visit last
 weekend by armed forces chief of staff General
 Costa Gomes was marred by demonstrations by
 angry whites protesting inadequate military pro-
 tection.                                                                          On May 12, an angry rock-throwing
 crowd of whites broke up a political rally in a
 black suburb of Beira. Blacks retaliated by ac-
 costing whites who later tried to pass through the
 suburb.
 Many Mozambicans believe Lisbon is ready
 to offer favored treatment to the insurgents. This
 belief has probably been reinforced by knowledge
 that Lisbon has commissioned several  former
 political  prisoners,  all  well-known blacks, in-
 cluding a brother of an insurgent leader, to pre-
 sent its case to the rebels. The ex-prisoners are
 expected to arrive in Dar es Salaam, where the
 rebels maintain headquarters, within a few days.
 In Angola, the level of insurgency has been
 low for the past few years, and Lisbon is under no
 immediate  military pressure to accommodate
 rebel groups there. The Portuguese Government,
 however, is apparently worried that the insurgents
 are preparing for a military push in northern
 Angola and is augmenting its military forces there
 with  troops   from  other  parts  of  the  terri-
 tory.

 CAMBODIA: POLITICAL STIRRINGS
 Some familiar political problems upstaged
 the military situation this week. Student and
 teacher activists in Phnom Penh, who tended to
 their academic pursuits for the past month, have
 resumed criticism of the government. Students
 decorated some schools in the capital with ban-
 ners and posters denouncing the government for
 its inability to reduce inflation and curb corrup-
 tion, and student leaders called for large anti-gov-
 ernment demonstrations. Some teachers have
 gone back on strike to protest anew their inade-
 quate salaries, while others have been pushing for
 another national teachers' congre~> on May 17 to
 voice their lack of confidence in the government.
 Trying to keep the unrest within bounds,
 Prime Minister Long Boret announced a few new
 measures aimed at easing some of the teachers'
 economic problems. Defense Minister Thappana
 Nginn, meanwhile, accused the Khmer Commu-
 nists of stirring up the students and teachers and
 stated that tighter security measures were being
 put into effect in Phnom Penh. Cambodian Army
 Chief General Fernandez, however, has indicated
 that government security forces in the capital will
 avoid confrontations with students and teachers
 in order to prevent major disorders from oc-
 curring.
 Lon Nol has used the unsettled situation to
 force another "state of danger" declaration from
 the legislature, similar to the one that expired in
 early April. The new declaration, which is valid
 for six months, gives the government special
 powers enabling it to suspend such constitutional
 rights as freedom of assembly. The President
 presumably  intends to use the document,  if
 necessary, as a legal basis for any moves against
 antigovernment  elements exploiting legitimate
 grievances.
 Khmer Communist forces well north of
 Phnom Penh launched their anticipated attacks
 against the provin. ial capital of Kompong Thom.
 Sporadic Communist artillery fire caused little
 damage, however, and ground assaults against the
 city's outlying defenses were repulsed. The at-
 tacks did not prevent the airlifting of additional
 reinforcements to Kompong Thom.

 Laos ? North Vietnam - China
 THE FOREIGN TROOP ISSUE
 One of the most important provisions of the
 Lao Accords of 1973 calls for the withdrawal of
 all foreign troops and military personnel from
 Laos 60 d-ys after the formation of a coalition
 government.  The  North  Vietnamese have  the
 largest number of troops in Laos but have shown
 little interest to date in complying fully with the
 withdrawal provision.

 CHINA: CHOU STILL IN THE SADDLE
 For years, Premier Chou En-lai has main-
 tained a grueling pace while managing China's
 affairs, showing remarkable physical and mental
 stamina. Recently, however, he cut back on some
 aspects of his job. On May 9, he did not attend a
 stag banquet given by visiting Senegalese Presi-
 dent Senghor. During the visit earlier this week of
 Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto, Chou missed al-
 most all of the purely protocol functions and two
 substantive discussions as well. The official ex-
 planation, and Chou's own, is that he is slightly
 unwell because of his old age-he is 76. He has,
 nevertheless, kept a fairly active schedule amid a
 number of signs that his political health is as
 sound as ever.
 There has been much speculation outside of
 China that the 76 year old Premier is being forced
 by his political enemies into a state of semi-retire-
 ment. The Chinese have been at pains, however,
 to counter speculation about Chou's political
 demise. The two vice-premiers who stood in for
 Chou at banquets for the high-level visitors com-
 mented that they were acting on behalf of the
 Premier. One of the vice-premiers, Li Hsien-nien,
 is Chou's closest associate in the leadership; the
 other, Teng Hsiao-ping, has seemed to work
 closely with Chou since the former's political
 rehabilitation a year ago. Chinese media noted
 repeatedly during the Bhutto visit that the Pakis-
 tani Prime Minister was in China at Chou's invita-
 tion. Bhutto's complimentary references to the
 Premier were duly reported by the official Chi-
 nese news agency, and the banquet for Bhutto
 was officially described as being given by Chou,
 even though he was not present. The joint com-
 munique issued at the end of the visit mentioned
 Chou four times.
 Chou's wife was  unusually  prominent  during  this
 per o   Portions of her speech to a Vietnamese
 women's delegatico were even published by the
 official news agency. A lesser government official
 who is close to Chou has appeared with unusual
 frequency-over the years his pattern of appear-
 ances has proven to be a reliable gauge of Chou's
 political status.
 Chou is clearly not incapacitated. Although
 he did not meet Bhutto at the airport, he accom-
 panied him later that day to a lengthy session
 with  Mao.  Television coverage of that event
 showed Chou looking apparently fit. The follow-
 ing day, Chou conducted the initial talks with
 Bhutto that lasted nearly two hours, but he did
 not participate in the follow-up discussions.
 It is possible that Chou has been ore-
 occupied of late with domestic business, espe-
 cially the ongoing anti-Confucius campaign. A
 member of the inner circle around Mao and Chou
 hinted as much by suggesting that Chou missed
 the Senghor banquet because he had "more im-
 portant matters" to attend to.
 The anti-Confucius campaign has been re-
 cently characterized by increasing factional strife
 in the provinces that seems to reflect serious
 differences at the top over major policy and per-
 sonnel issues. Chou has apparently devoted con-
 siderable attention to these problems, and with
 some success. There has been a steady flow of
 official  instructions emphasizing the need for
 order during the campaign, and the propaganda in
 recent weeks has taken on a decidedly "Chouist"
 tone. On May 7, for example, a local Peking
 newspaper lashed out at the extremists who in-
 cited armed conflict during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion. Most of them have since been purged, but
 their most prominent survivor is Mao's wife,
 Chiang Ching, who is Chou's major ar.tagcnist in
 the current campaign. Chiang Ching did in fact
 urge young people to take up weapons during the
 Cultural Revolution.
 During the past year, Chou has begun 25X6
 share some of his duties in the foreign policy
 arena with his deputy premiers. No doubt he wi125X6
 continue to do so, especially with domestic poli-
 tics demanding so much of his time and energy.
 But a good indication that Chou remains firmly in
 the saddle is the fact that his lower public profile
 over the last week has not sparked a correspond-
 ing increase in the activity of his political ene-

 USSR - EASTERN EUROPE: CROP PROSPECTS
 Grain crops are off to a poor start in Com-
 munist Europe this year. Bad weather slowed
 Soviet sowing operations in April, while rain in
 Eastern Europe has brought only marginal relief
 to drought-stricken crops there. The season is still
 early, however, and much will depend on weather
 conditions ovE,- the next two months.
 Sowing operations in the western USSR
 were hindered by cold, rain, and snow in mid-
 April, when the sowing campaign was scheduled
 to shift into high gear. Favorable weather during
 the first week in May permitted a faster pace, but
 by May 6 only about 38 million hectares, 39
 percent of the planned area, had been sown to
 grain. At the same time in 1972 and 1973, the
 areas sown amounted L'o about 41 million and 48
 million hectares respectively.
 A successful  spring sowing campaign is
 needed this yi.ar to help offset a higher than
 average loss of crops sown last fall. In mid-April,
 Deputy Minister of Agriculture Kuznetsov esti-
 mated that between 5 and 10 million hectares of
 the 35 million sown in the fall would require
 resowing this spring, compared with the long-run
 average of about 4 million.
 While wresiling with these problems, Mos.
 cow has taken steps to assure a smooth grain
 harvest. For the sixth successive year, the party's
 central  committee and the government have
 issued a joint decree providing specific guidelines
 for the harvest. Reducing losses is of regular con-
 cern to the leadership.
 The Soviet grain harvest starts in July and
 continues into October, but is beset by a shortage
 of proper machinery, dependable manpower, and
 grain drying fac;lities.
 This year's decree directs ministries sup-
 plying agricultural machinery to speed up de-
 liveries, authorizes the state bank to make emer-
 gency short-term loans to state and collective
 farms, and authorizes the transfer of urban trucks
 and urban workers to rural areas to help with the
 harvesting.
 The slow progress of the spring sowing cam-
 paign,  coupled  with  above-average winterkill,
 raises doubts that the goal of a 206-million-ton
 grain harvest will be met. Above average soii
 moisture in the eastern part of the spring grain
 belt, where sowing is about to begin, brightens
 the outlook in an otherwise cloudy picture.
 Eastern Europe
 Rain in early May removed crops in Hungary
 and Czechoslovakia from the critical list, but
 brought only marginal relief to those in other
 East European countries. Thus far, accumulated
 precipitation has not been enough to restore sub-
 soil moisture to normal levels, and more will be
 required this month if the yields of winter grain
 last year are to be equaled. Soil moisture at the
 end of April ranged from 48 percent below nor-
 mal in Hungary to 17 percent below normal in
 Poland.
 Precipitation in the first week of May un-
 doubtedly spurred the development of spring-
 planted crops--particularly root crops and sun-
 flowers-and ensured the germination of corn.
 The rains were probably too late, however, to
 p.,event a reduction in first cuttings of hay in
 several countries.
 Unless the drought is broken this month,
 Eastern Europe's import requirements for the
 year ending June 1975 could approach 10 million
 tons, ti.e highest level in several years. The
 amount of livestock feed on hand in Eastern
 Europe almost certainly will not be large enough
 to maintain livestock numbers and roductivity at
 last year's level.

 The lopsided vote for divorce in the Italian
 referendum was a sharp rebuff to the dominant
 Christian Democratic Party and the Vatican. It
 was an unexpectedly large win for the broad
 pro-divorce grouping, which included the Chris-
 tian Democrats' three coalition partners and the
 Italian Communist Party. There was a 59.1-per-
 cent vote to retain the 3-year-old divorce law.
 The outcome was a particular shock to
 Christian Democratic Party chief Amintore Fan-
 fani, who led the campaign to repeal the divorce
 law. Fanfani pushed his party into the battle,
 against the judgment of many other Christian
 Democratic leaders-including Prime Minister
 Rumor-who preferred to cancel the referendum
 by working out a compromise with the pro-
 divorce groups. Fanfani, a major figure in the
 party for more than 25 years, has shown a re-
 markable ability to land on his feet after previous
 setbacks. He will have to do some furious rhetor-
 ical backpedaling this time, however, because he
 strongly implied during the campaign that a vote
 for divorce was a vote for the Communists.
 F
 YN
 The Communists are building on this theme
 by taking a conciliatory line and stressing that it
 is now time to move on to the solution of "more
 important problems." Berlinguer will probably re-
 turn soon to his "historic compromise" proposal,
 which calls for a rapprochement between the
 Communists and Christian Democrats.
 The Communists will get the major credit
 for the victory, although the pro-divorce front
 also included Socialists, Social Democrats, Repub-
 licans, and Liberals. Communist leader Enrico
 Berlinguer was, from the outset, the most active
 campaigner for retention of legalized divorce. The
 Socialists, fearful of being overshadowed by the
 Communists, also worked hard, but the other
 parties in favor of divorce did not mount a major
 public effort until the last week of the campaign.
 Since the divorce issue cuts across party
 lines, the outcome does not necessarily mean that
 the Communist vote would increase in a general
 election. The Communists are jubilant, however,
 because the referendum tally suggests that they
 are in tune with the mainstream of Italian opin-
 ion, and that the Christian Democrats are not.
 This impression will help the Communists make
 more credible the claim chat their party-Italy's
 second largest-is a respectab:e, legitimate organi-
 zation and therefore entitled to a role in the
 national government.
 All party leaders are now trying to figure out
 what the referendum outcome implies for the
 future of Italian politics. So far, most politicians
 have remained silent, but they are probably im-
 pressed by the failure of the anti-communist
 theme and the sternest admonitions of the
 Church to mobilize enough voters to repeal the
 divorce law. Many Italians are already interpreting
 the result as a vote for modern versus traditional
 values. Shortly alter the results of the referendum
 became known, th3 headline in the country's
 most prestigious newspaper proclaimed: "Italy is
 Now a Modern Country."

 Though stung by the defeat, the Christian
 Democrats will remain the major voice in any
 political "clarification" that may result from the
 referendum. Both the Christian Democrats and
 Socialists-on apposite sides of the divorce issue-
 stressed during the campaign their intentions to
 continue governmental collaboration. If tensions
 over the outcome of the referendum cause the
 government to fall, however, the ensuing negotia-
 tions on the formation of another center-left coa-
 lition may be difficult and protracte.
 Although national elections are still almost
 six weeks away, statements by the contending
 political parties make it clear that Iceland's deteri-
 orating economic situation, the controversy over
 the Keflavik base, and the fishing limits question
 will be the principal issues in the campaign. A
 combination of public discontent with the gov-
 ernment's handling of the economy and a recent
 successful signature campaign in support of the
 base appear to have improved the electoral pros-
 pects of pro-Western groups, such as the opposi-
 tion Independence Party and the Social Democrats.
 Prime Minister Johannesson decided to dis-
 solve parliament on May 9, after the Liberal Left
 Organization withdrew from the center-left coali-
 tion because of differences over the government's
 anti-inflation program. Freeing wages from ties to
 the cost-of-living index and banning wage in-
 creases in excess of 20 percent were the two most
 controversial proposals in the program. Johannes-
 son will continue to head the government on an
 interim basis until after the elections on June 30.
 Iceland's grave economic situation will re-
 quire immediate attention when the new govern-
 ment takes office. Johannesson has stated that
 until that time he will decree provisional measures
 to avert an economic catastrophe. The cost of
 imports, especially oil, increased by about one
 third in the second half of 1973. The import price
 rise has been especially damaging because wages
 are linked to the cost-of-living index. Huge wage
 increases and a decline in earnings in the vital
 fishing industry have also contributed to the
 gloomy outlook. The inflation rate may approach
 60 percent this year if the wage-price linkage
 remains.
 The new government must also renegotiate a
 defense agreement under which the US has main-
 tained forces at the Keflavik air base. Last March,
 the Johannesson government tabled proposals
 calling for the complete withdrawal of US troops
 from Keflavik by 1976. Although a more mod-
 erate coalition would probably demand some
 modifications of the present arrangement, it
 would likely be more flexible than the outgoing
 coalition. The new government's attitude toward
 the base may be influenced by the outcome of a
 pro-base signature campaign in February, indi-
 cating that a majority of Icelanders support the
 base.
 Although  the conservative  Independence
 Party will probably remain the strongest single
 party, the outcome of the election is clouded by
 internal disputes within the major parties. All
 three members of the outgoing coalition-the Pro-
 gressive Party, the Liberal Left Organization, and
 the Communists-are split internally over the base
 issue. The Communists, all but a few of whom are
 vocal opponents of the base, may pick up some
 support from dissident members of the Progres-
 sive Party and the Liberal Left Organization.
 If the opposition coalition forms a gov-
 ernment after the elections, the chairman of the
 Independence Party, Gier Hallgrim,son, would
 probably become the new prime minister and
 Social Democratic chairman Gylfi Gislason would
 take over as foreign minister. In the meantime,
 Johannesson, anticipating a government 'ad by
 the Independence Party, is trying to steer his
 Progressive Party away from the Communists and
 along more moderate lines so it will not be frozen
 out of the new government.

 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR 1974
 The economic situation of the developed
 countries in the first half of 1974 will turn out
 somewhat better than forecasters anticipated in
 January. Even so, depressed real growth, soaring
 inflation, and mounting current account deficits
 will dominate the economic outlook for Canada,
 Japan, and Western Europe.
 The revised projections indicate that real
 gross national product in the UK, and possibly in
 Japan, is declining in the first half of this year but
 is increasing moderately in Canada, France, West
 Germany, and Italy. Inflation rates generally ex-
 ceed 10 percent, and, except for West Germany
 and Canada, the current accounts  are in sub-
 stantial deficit.
 Most forecasts point to a recovery in the
 second half of the year, on the assumption that
 restrictive economic policies will be relaxed or
 stimulative policies introduced in a number of
 countries. It is also ant'cipated that investment
 will be encouraged by shortages of capacity and
 the introduction of energy-conserving processes.
 For the year as a whole, real growth of gross
 national product in the developed countries will
 probably fall to half the rate of 1973. Japan's
 growth will be negligible in the first half. In-
 creased investment spending and business pressure
 for relief from restrictive policies should increase
 real growth to nearly 6 percent in the second half.
 The UK's gross national product will probably
 plummet by 8 percent in the first half bec=.use of
 the coal strike, weak consumer demand, and de-
 flationary budget and credit policies. 1 -he rsump-
 tion of a normal work week and renewed con-
 sumer confidence should result in a spurt of 8-9
 percent in the second half.
 With the threat of recession diminishing,
 however, many governments are hesitant to stim-
 ulate demand for fear of worsening inflation:
 ? Tokyo is expected to maintain its re-
 strictive monetary and fiscal policies at least
 until July; if recovery is then evident, policies
 could remain tight until the fall.
 ? London has adopted a tighter fiscal pol-
 icy in view of the prospects of a second half
 recovery; the new budget increases taxes by
 $1.6 billion.
 ? Paris has strengthened price controls,
 speeded up tax collections, and kept credit
 tight.
 Thus, better than expected performance in the
 first half of the year could, paradoxically, have
 the effect of moderating the  ro'ecte l second
 half recovery.

 for the Italian Communist-dominated labor con-
 federation-will not be on the agenda, but is sure
 to be debated vigorously in informal exchanges.
 The admission of the World Confederation
 affiliates was foreseen when the Europeans of the
 Socialist-oriented International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions founded the ETUC in Feb-
 ruary 1973. The new European group will now
 represent almost all trade unionists in Western
 Europe-33 million workers in 16 countries-
 except -i.hose  in Ccmmunist-dominated union
 organizations in Italy and France. To most West
 European workers, a unified labor movement ap-
 pears to be the way of the future.
 The delegates to the Congress will elect a
 new president to succeed Vic Feather, former
 head of the giant British Trades Union Congress.
 Contrary to earlier speculation, it now appears
 that West German Heinz Oskar Vetter, chief of
 the ETUC's other giant federation, does not want
 the job. The leading candidates are Belgian Social-
 ist Georges Debunne and Danish trade union
 leader Thomas Nielsen. Another Dane,  Peer
 Carlsen, is scheduled to be elected deputy genera!
 secretary, with Belgian Socialist Theo Rasschaert
 remaining as general secretary, despite the general
 lack of enthusiasm for his past performance.
 The ETUC Congress will also adopt an ac-
 tion program, giving priority attention to employ-
 ment, price stability, more equal income distribu-
 tion, formulation of a common energy policy for
 Western Europe, a greater voice for labor in indus-
 trial management, and aid to developing coun-
 tries. The threat of inflation and the power of
 multinational corporations will also be prominent
 topics. Help for the fledgling Portuguese labor
 movement may be discussed as well; thus far, the
 ETUC has left the initiative to individual mem-
 bers and to the international organizations.
 It now appears that the Italian Communist-
 led federation will be admitted within the next
 several months, possibly as early as July. The
 Italians seem to have given sufficient proof that
 they are acting sincerely and independently of
 Soviet direc-don in participating in labor initia-
 tives at the EC level and in Italy. Their principal
 champions have been the Italian Christian Demo-
 cratic and Socialist unions, with which they hope
 to form a united Italian labor front. The British
 and Debunne's Belgian Socialists have also been
 strong supporters of the Italian Communists,
 arguing that all West European labor federations
 should eventually join the ETUC. West German
 opposition seems to be waning, albeit reluctantly.
 There is no impetus for early membership of the
 more hard-line pro-Soviet French Communist-
 dominated labor federation, although this issue
 may also be discussed informally in Copenhagen,
 and eventual membership is considered inevitable
 by most ETUC members.
 Future encounters with !abor organizations
 in Eastern Europe are still a subject of c..ncern,
 but plans are being made for a meeting next
 January similar to the one held at the Inter-
 national Labor Organization n Geneva last Jan-
 uary. Most ETUC members remain opposed to
 Soviet suggestions that pan-European labor co-
 operation should be formalized. The British have
 tended to support the Soviet view, much to the
 chagrin of the other members.
 The British role in the ETUC continues to be
 ambivalent. The smaller federations fear that the
 British and the West Germans might cooperate to
 dominate ETUC affairs. This does not appear
 likely, however, in view of the differing views of
 the two organizations toward the role of the
 ETUC. The West Germans favor a strong organiza-
 tion, while the British, suspicious of strong West
 European institutions in general, prefer a more
 loosely organized confederation. The British, for
 example, have boycotted all ~:C activities. Never-
 theless, the British federation sought and won
 election for its chief as the first ETUC president
 15 months ago, and it plays a prominent role in
 the ETUC executive committee. A continued
 "Gaullist" approach on the part of British labor
 would doubtlessly dampen ETUC effectiveness.

 I                               I
 Romanian party chief Ceausescu's talks in
 Bulgaria on May 11-12 with Todor Zhivkov, his
 Bulgarian counterpart, have sparked speculation
 about their purpose, mainly because they came
 shortly after Zhivkov's whirlwind visit to Moscow
 on May 8. The talks were cloaked in unusual
 secrecy, but fragmentary information suggests
 that the two leaders focused on questions con-
 cerning the international communist movement
 rather than on economic issues as initially rumored.
 The entourages of both leaders consisted al-
 most exclusively of party officials responsible for
 inter-party and foreign rei4tions. This and the size
 of the Bulgarian delegation suggests that the
 Soviets may have asked Zhivkov to try to over-
 come Romanian resistance to the Soviet-inspired
 call for a world conference of communist parties.
 The Bulgarians at least probably tried to mod-
 erate Ceausescu's strong resistant? to attending a
 pan-European conference of communist and
 workers' parties, a necessary prelude to a world
 conclave.
 Zhivkov played a similar role in 1966 when
 the Soviets, in preparation for the international
 communist conference in Moscow in 1969, called
 on him to try to induce the Romanians to attend
 a preparatory all-European conference held at
 Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia, early in 1967.
 Zhivkov failed, and the Romanians, along with
 the Yugoslavs, boycotted the Karlovy Vary meeting.
 Available portions of the apparently bland
 communique summarizing last week's talks hint
 at disagreements, thereby suggesting another Bul-
 garian  failure. The independent-minded  Ro-
 manian leader is :,pparently determined to con-
 tinue opposing Moscow's format for multilateral
 communist meetings.
 Miliiary activity on the Syrian front in-
 creased this week after a quiet weekend. Israeli
 fighter-bombers flew strikes against fedayeen
 positions inside Lebanon and on the slopes of
 Mount Hermon. They also struck once at Syrian
 positions south of the Israeli-held salient. Air ac-
 tivity over Lebai,in was particularly heavy on
 Thursday morning when Israeli planes struck
 several Palestinian refugee camps in retaliation for
 the terrorist incident at Maalot. Artillery, tank,
 and mortar exchanges occurred along the front
 throug;iout the week, but were noticeably lighter
 than in previous days.
 The US Embassy in Beirut has learned that
 Lebanon has persuaded Syria to remove its sur-
 face-to-air missile batteries from Lebanese terri-
 tory near Mount Hermon. A reliable source of the
 embassy reports that some batteries were with-
 drawn on May 7. The source speculated that Syria
 had agreed to remove the missiles because it
 expects a disengagement agreement to be reached,
 and because they provided only minimal protec-
 tion against Israeli aircraft flying over Lebanon
 toward targets in Syria. The source said Israeli air
 strikes against these batteries may have been
 another factor in their withdrawal.       25X1
 Officials of the Israeli Air Force told the US
 defense attache in Tel Aviv on May 9 that the
 surface-to-air missile units that were located in
 Lebanon had returned to Syria.

 SOVIET ECONOMIC AID TO EGYPT
 Soviet economic programs in Egypt are con-
 tinuing, despite the suspension of military ship-
 ments. It is now more than five weeks si;ice the
 USSR's last arms delivery to Egypt by sea. On the
 economic side, however, the Soviets seem to be
 honoring existing commitments. Some 1,500 So-
 viet technicians remain at work in Egypt. Never-
 theless, both sides remain cautious in assuming
 new undertakings.
 Moscow's position as Egypt's principal eco-
 nomic aid donor ended with the 1967 war, when
 other Arab states agreed to underwrite the Egyp-
 tian economy with $250 million annually in
 grants. Since the October war, even more aid has
 been forthcoming from a variety of donors. In
 contrast, Moscow has not granted any new eco-
 nomic aid to Egypt since early 1971, when some
 $195 million in credits was extended. Egypt has
 used about 70 percent of the nearly $1.2 billion
 in credits extended by the USSR since 1957.
 The Soviets were initially anxious to play a
 significant role in clearing the Suez Canal and
 rehabilitating war-damaged industries in the canal
 area. Moscow, however, was stung w;ien Egypt
 decided to turn to the US and the UK for aid in
 canal clearance. It now appears that the USSR
 will play only a minor role, and any view aid that
 may be extended will be small.
 Underwater mine clearance
 US training Egyptians
 In April, an Egyptian ccoromic delegation
 went to M),cow to discuss the expansion of the
 Hulwan iron and sieel complex and the Naja
 Hamadi aluminum plant, major ongoing Soviet
 aid projects. The Soviets will apparently prepare
 feasibility studies. Expansion of the plants will
 require additional financing of as much as $250
 million; new Soviet aid will depend not only on
 the results of the studies but on the political
 relationship then prevailing between Cairo and
 Moscow.
 The first stage expansion of the Hulwan iron
 and steel complex, completed late last year, in-
 creased  Egypt's annual steel capacity from
 300,000 tons to nearly 1 million tons. Hulwan's
 present capacity can satisfy more than half of
 Egypt's current domestic requirements and, if
 completed, the second stage expansion would
 make Egypt nearly self-sufficient in steel.
 The Naja Hamadi aluminum plant will begin
 trial operations later this year. By next year, the
 plant will have a capacity to produce 100,000
 tons of aluminum, three fourths of which will be
 exported, mostly to the USSR. Proposed plans
 call for the plant's capacity eventually to reach
 165,000 tons annually.
 Moscow and Cairo are also negotiating a
 contract to enlarge the capacity of the Soviet-
 built Alexandria shipyard, completed in 1968.
 Terms must still be ironed out because of Cairo's
 objection to the prices of some items. Egypt is
 building some 35 small tankers and cargo ships
 for the USSR in repayment for aid i -)r the ship-
 yard. Soviet engineers and technical personnel are
 directing repair work at the facility on Soviet
 merchant marine and naval ships.
 Moscow also remains involved in Egypt's
 fishing industry, as well as in irrigation, rural
 electrification, and other projects. The USSR is to
 complete studies this year on improvements to
 the Nile River, including plans for construction of

 ETHIOPIA: CONSER !ATIVES WIN A ROUND
 New appointments and shifts of key military
 and civilian personnel announced on May 14
 represent a victory for conservatives over the mili-
 tary moderates, their rivals for power and in-
 fluence.
 On the whole, the appointments on May 14
 appear more an attempt by the conservatives to
 regain a measure of political control than an ef-
 foi t t j reverse the changes set in motion by the
 military revolt in February. Nonetheless, the mili-
 tary moderates,  'ready angry over the nobility's
 intrigues, will ; yard the appointments as a direct
 challenge to their plans for ensuring social and
 political change in Ethiopia.
 Politically the most significant new appoint-
 ments in the armed forces were chief of staff,
 commander of the army, and commander of the
 Third Infantry Division, which is stationed along
 the border with Somalia. All three officers are
 believed to be important members of the con-
 servative faction. Their appointment will further
 strengthen control over the military chain of corn-
 mand by General Abiye Abebe, the conservative
 minister of defense. Abiye and his close associ-
 ates, Prime Minister Endalkatchew and Ras Asrate
 Kassa, the president of the Crown Council, have
 emerged as the real pillars of the present govern-
 ment.
 In the past, both Asrate Kassa, an important
 nobleman and one of Haile Selassie's closest
 advisers, and Abiye have urged reforms on a reluc-
 tant Emperor and the more reactionary members
 of the aristocracy. As time passed without mean-
 ingful reform, their "progressive" reputations be-
 came tarnished, and the younger moderates now
 consider them part of the discredited conservative
 hierarchy. The moderates distrust Asrate Kassa in
 particular as they consider him the chief agent of
 those conservatives maneuvering behind the
 scenes, playing on personal loyalties and tribal
 connections, and dispensing money in an effort to
 weaken and divide moderate forces.
 In addition to changes in the army, the gov-
 ernment also announced the appointment of
 several new provincial governors general who are
 both more capable and more aware of the need
 for change than their predecessors but who still
 owe their loyalty mainly to the conservative fac-
 tion. Several new deputy governor generals were
 also  appointed from among qualified and
 respected provincial officials.
 Meanwhile, the resignation last week of
 Minassie Haile as foreign minister points to
 divisions within the Endalkatchew cabinet that
 may lead to further cabinet changes. Several of
 the more progressive ministers reportedly are
 threatening to quit over policy difference, with
 Endalkatchew. Others believe Endalkatchew relies
 :oo heavily on advice from Abiye in making
 decisions, to the exclusion of the rest of the
 cabinet. This issue probably played a part in the
 resignation of Minassie.
 Minassie, one of the few holdovers from the
 previous government, had long been at odds with
 the Prime Minister and other cabinet colleagues
 who considered him indecisive and lacking in
 initiative. His resignation will probably have little
 effect on Ethiop;a's foreign relations.
 CYPRUS: GROWING TENSIONS
 Tensions have increased in Cyprus since the
 adjournment on April 2 of the intercommunal
 talks that have been going on for six years
 between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. On the
 Greek Cypriot side, there have been renewed
 clashes between supporters of President Makarios
 and the followers of the late General George
 Grivas, who advocate the union of Cyprus and
 Greece (enosis). These pro-enosis forces enjoy the
 support  of elements of the Greek-officered

 riots. They view it as the first step toward parti-
 tion of the island. The Greek Cypriots charge that
 the Turkish Cypriot side is attempting to modify
 the terms of reference for the talks. According to
 the Greek Cypriots, the terms of reference, pro-
 vided for a "unitary, independent, and sovereign"
 Cypriot state.
 The Turkish Cypriots claim that neither side
 agreed to such terms of reference. They have
 played down the Ecevit statement, however, in-
 terprc 'Ling it to mean a functional type of feder-
 alism rather than geographic separation of the
 two communities.
 Osorio Tafall, the UN special representative
 in Cyprus, is attempting to get the talks resumed
 on the basis of a mutually agreed formula. The
 Makarios government rejected his first proposal as
 too vague, and he is now making a second effort.
 Although Makarios probably will permit the talks
 to resume eventually, he appears to be in no
 hurry. He hopes to extract concessions from the
 Turkish Cypriots, who are more anxious to re-
 open the talks. Their anxiety has been aroused by
 the growth of anti-Turkish sentiment within the
 Greek Cypriot community. This has been fueled
 by the Ecevit statement and by the Greece-
 Turkey  dispute  over  Aegean  oil  exploration
 rights, both of which are being exploited by the
 pro-enosis Greek officers of the national guard.
 Turkish Cypriots became especially alarmed after
 an incident on May 9 in a mixed village when
 national guardsmen harassed Turkish Cypriot
 residents.
 By stalling, Makarios is also protecting him-
 self from accusation by national guard officers
 and other pro-enosis elements that he is too ac-
 commodating with the Turkish Cypriots. Because
 tension between the two communities on the
 island is usually reflected in relations between
 their mainland sponsors, Makarios' abstention
 from the talks could stir up trouble between
 Athens and Ankara. This would distract the
 Greek rulers and strengthen  Makarios' hand
 against their possible machinations, but it would
 also further inflame intercommunal tensions on

 National Guard on the island. Relations between
 the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot com-
 munities have also worsened.
 Following General Grivas' death last Janu-
 ary, members of EOKA-B, his pro-enosis terrorist
 organization, became embroiled in a struggle over
 who would succeed him and what strategy to
 pursue. On April 22, a hard-line faction severely
 beat and injured a group of Makarios sup-
 porters-the first instance of EOKA-B violence
 since the death of Grivas. Reacting strongly,
 Makarios formally outlawed EOKA-B, set a dead-
 line of April 27 for the general amnesty extended
 to all wanted men in January, and announced his
 determination to wipe out those remnants of
 EOKA-B who rem,'-ied in hiding. Only a few
 turned themselves in before the deadline, thereby
 setting the stage for more clashes.
 Makarios has also been angered by a series of
 arms thefts from national guard stores and by
 anti-government  incidents  involving  pro-enosis
 elements of the national guard whom he suspects
 are in collusion with EOKA-B. The latest incident
 involved the theft of light weapons on May 7
 from a national guard armory and their probable
 transfer to EOKA-C. The theft will probably lead
 Makarios to try again to restrict the activities of
 the national guard and ultimately replace it with a
 full-fledged Greek Cypriot army formed around
 his personal military force. Makarios' determina-
 tion to break the back of the remnants of EOKA-
 B and his attempt to curb the national guard may
 well prompt a dispute with the Athens govern-
 ment, which views these two elements as indis-
 pensable tools for maintaining its influence in
 Cyprus.
 The intercommunal talks were suspended by
 the Greek Cypriots when the Turkish Cypriot
 negotiator refused to disavow Turkish Prime Min-
 ister Ecevit's statement in late March calling for a
 "federal" system of government for Cyprus.
 Any system that would preclude majority
 Greek Cypriot rule is anathema to Greuk Cyp-

 Amid rumors of a possible coup against
 Chief of State Lopez, students last week plunged
 the capital city into two days of violence that
 nearly brought the army into the streets to con-
 trol them. Had the army done so, it might have
 gone on to take direct control of the government.
 The demonstrations  began  as  a  protest
 against Guatemala for its harsh treatment of
 workers during May  Day observances. The
 demonstrations degenerated into riots when one
 student was killed, allegedly by a policeman.
 The rioting continued into the night of May
 8 and resumed the next day. Property damage
 amcunted to about $200,000, and 43 persons
 were injured, some seriously. Police detained 240
 persons and are still holding 200 of them.
 At the height of the disturbances, police
 began running low on tear gas, and students ap-
 peared to be gaining the upper hand. The army
 was placed on alert, and a number of unit com-
 manders wanted to assist the police. General
 Lopez, who is also chief of the armed forces,
 would not give the order, however. Had the riot-
 ing resumed on May 10, the army would probably
 have intervened, with or without Lopez' permission.
 Lopez' fa;!ure to reinforce the poiice is
 another example of his indecisiveness, a quality
 that is persuading many military officers and
 prominent civilians that he should be replaced.
 Lopez has exercised practically no leadership, and
 in times of crisis he appears incapable of making
 decisions. Consequently, Honduras, already the
 least deve'ope 1 country in Central A-,ierica, is
 falling farther behind its neighbors.
 Rumors about a coup have been circulating
 since last fall, but have gained intensity in recent
 weeks. Latest indications are that Lopez himself
 has been persuaded that his resignation during or
 shortly after some disorder would be a face-saving
 way to retire.
 Even though events move slowly in Hon-
 duras, some change seems in the offing. Lopez,

 who in the past has been largely responsible for
 the slo1V marsh, may no longer be the key person
 in the action. More dynamic leaders within the
 military argue that the military must exercise
 firmer control-and soon.

 BRAZIL: PRESS CENSORSHIP INCREASED
 Despite earlier hints that President Geisel
 was contemplating some degree of liberalization,
 the administration has instituted new, tougher
 controls on some press organs.
 The government has ordered the publishers
 of Veja, a weekly news magazine, to submit all
 textual material to Brasilia prior to publication.
 Veja had written on topics the government
 deemed overly controversial-such as the expira-
 tion of certain political restrictions on a number
 cf once prominent public figures. The effects of
 the new censorship order could so hamper the
 magazine's produ. Lion schedule as to put it out of
 business.
 Censorship has been ren wed at Opiniao, a 25X1
 leftist weekly that had recently enjoyed relative
 freedom. In addit':on, full-scale censorship con-
 tinues at 0 Estado de Sao Paulo, the nation's
 most prestigious newspaper, despite a report that
 official scrutiny was to be lessened.
 Cardinal Arrs of Sao Paulo, commenting on
 the new censorship order, noted that he has "Ios+
 all hope that the administration would end abuses
 in the areas of civil and human rights." The Cardi-
 nal, long a critic of the military regimes that have
 controlled Brazil for the past ten years, added
 that arbitrary arrests and torture are continuing.
 The new censorship order comes at a time
 when  unrest-primarily  among  students and
 workers -is growing, and it may be intended as a
 wary ing to all critics of the government. The
 PreFident may also be responding to pressure
 from conservative members of the military hierar-
 ch who oppose any liberalization.

 PERU: MORE ARMS
 The Soviet merchant ship that arrived at
 Lima's port of Callao on May 9 unloaded tank-
 related equipment and probably the second in-
 stallment of medium tanks under a contract that
 may call for a total delivery of up to 200.
 Although this shipment is not likely to have
 any immediate effect on relations with Chile, the
 presence in Peru of additional tanks will almost
 certainly reinforce Chile's determination to
 acquire more arms to counter what it sees as an
 alarming Peruvian buildup.
 Peruvian President Velasco has become in-
 creasingly sensitive to charges that his country is
 unduly building up its armed forces and thereby
 raising tensions among its neighbors. Lima Jso is
 concerned atout charges by its neighbors that by
 purchas.',ig Soviet weapons Peru is or will become
 a base for Soviet and Cuban penetration in Latin
 America. Last December, news stories reporting
 the tank purchase forced Velasco to admit
 publicly that Peru had accepted delivery of Soviet
 armaments. Apparently in order to lessen the
 impact of his disclosure, Lima quickly proposed
 arms limitation talks with its neighbors. It will be
 harder this time to divert attention from the new
 influx of equipment should the story be made
 public.
 Another item that is causing sensitivity is
 Velasco's recent announcement that the armored
 school will be moved from Lima to southern
 Peru; some armor may already have been trans-
 ferred. If more Soviet tanks in fact arrived last
 week, at least some are likely to be stationed in
 the south to guard a ainst the  ossibility of
 hostilities with Chile.
 25X1
 Lima and Santiago are likely to continue
 their current arms procurement drives,  irre-
 spective of how each views the chances for aggres-
 sive moves by the other. Both sides, however, will
 probably continue publicly to play down hints of
 tension and to stress that any military purchases
 are consistent with long-standing plans to re lace
 worn-out materiel and obsolete equipment
