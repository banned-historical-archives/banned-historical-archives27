 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 April 1959
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 EAST-WEST NEGOTIATIONS
 In line with the USSR's
 general posture toward East-
 West negotiations, the two-day
 meeting of Warsaw Pact foreign
 ministers, attended by the Chi-
 nese Communist deputy foreign
 minister, struck a "moderate"
 tone with the avowed purpose of
 encouraging Western "flexibili-
 ty" in the forthcoming talks.
 The conference communique is-
 sued on 28 April expressed unan-
 imous    approval and support of
 Moscow's proposals for a German
 peace treaty and for converting
 West Berlin into a free city.
 The communique repeated
 charges made in the recent So-
 viet notes to the Unites States
 and West Germany that alleged
 measures to speed up the nun='
 clear rearmament of West German
 .forces are designed to confront
 the foreign ministers' confer-
 ence with a fait accompli.   It
 also denounced Bonn's policies
 as "counteracting" all proposals
 to ease tensions and achieve a
 disarmament agreement, includ-
 ing a nuclear-free zone in Cen-
 tral Europe.   The communique,
 avoided, howeV'et, bellicose
 threats and pledged that bloc
 governments will do "everything
 in their power to ensure the
 success of the negotiations."
 Foreign Minister Gromyko's
 general line of action at Geneva
 was foreshadowed in the commu-
 nique, which called for "full
 participation" of Poland and
 Czechoslovakia in both the for-
 eign ministers' and summit meet-
 ings.   It asserted that the two
 German states have the right to
 "take their due place at the
 conference table in Geneva,"
 suggesting that the-USSR will
 not insist on full participation
 of the East German representa-
 tive and will accept observer
 or consultant status for the
 two German delegations.
 The communique served no-
 tice that one of Gromyko's main
 tactical aims will be to defeat
 Western insistence that Berlin
 and a German treaty must be dis-
 cussed in the broader context-
 of German reunification and
 European security.   It reiter-
 ated that reunification is the
 exclusive problem of the two
 Germanys, and charged that pro-
 posals to "tie those problems
 up in one knot" would be aimed
 at "making it difficult to adopt
 any agreed decisions" on any
 of them.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 April 1959
 Moscow's confidence that
 it will enter the foreign min-
 isters' meeting with a strong
 bargaining position was reflect-
 ed in Soviet propaganda stress-
 ing disunity among the Western
 powers.
 Nuclear Test Cessation
 In a characteristically
 bold maneuver to divide his
 opponents and extricate himself
 from a difficult position, Khru-
 shchev,          in letters to Prime
 Minister Macmillan and President
 Eisenhower on 23 April, accepted
 a suggestion by Macmillan for
 a predetermined number of annual
 on-site inspections of suspected
 nuclear explosions.   This shift
 in the Soviet position was pre-
 sented as an effort to break
 the deadlock on the crucial is-
 sue of inspection procedures
 and pave the way for an agree-
 ment to halt all nuclear-weap-
 ons,, tests.
 Khrushchev rejected the
 American and British proposal
 for a phased approach, beginning
 with suspension of atmospheric
 tests, as on "unfair deal" de-
 signed to mislead public opinion
 and enable the Western powers
 to continue their nuclear weap-
 ons  development programs.   The
 Western proposal, advanced on
 13 April, had thrown the USSR
 on the defensive, and Khrushchev
 probably believed acceptance
 of Macmillan's compromise pro-
 posal. would not only enable him
 to regain the initiative in the
 nuclear test talks but also to
 exploit any Western differences
 on this issue.
 Soviet delegate Tsarapkin
 at Geneva is resorting to the
 time-honored Soviet tactic of
 demanding that the West must
 first accept Khrushchev's new
 proposal in principle before
 details can be discussed.   On
 28 April, however, he clarified
 the Soviet position by stating
 that the USSR will drop its de-
 mand for a veto on the dispatch
 of inspection teams if the num-
 ber of inspections of suspected
 nuclear explosions to be per-
 mitted each year is agreed on
 in advance.   He also announced
 that Moscow would agree to hav-
 ing a "permanent inspection team
 located somewhere" and to permit
 automatic inspection when con-
 trol-system instruments indicate
 a suspicious event.
 Tsarapkin made it clear
 that the USSR contemplated only
 a small number of annual inspec-
 tions, echoing a statement by
 Khrushchev in his letter to
 President Eisenhower.   Moreover,
 Tsarapkin insisted that the an-
 nual quota must be fixed by a
 "political decision," not on a
 technical basis, and that the
 three nuclear powers must now
 work out a "political compro),-'
 mice."
 The political objectives
 of dividing the United States
 and Britain underlying this
 latest Soviet move were evident
 in Tssarapkin's remark that he
 expected the American and British
 delegates to support Khrushchev's
 new proposal, in view of the
 fact that the original suggestion
 for an inspection quota had been
 made by Macmillan.   Khrushchev
 also expressed confidence in his
 letter to the prime minister
 that the British delegate at
 Geneva would be instructed to
 work for a solution on this

 basis,      "taking into account the
 considerations you (Macmillan)
 expressed in Moscow."
 West Germany and West Berlin
 A recent public opinion
 survey revealed that on the
 question of accepting East Ger-
 man control over Berlin access
 routes or sending a convoy
 through at the "risk of war,"
 over 50 percent of the Berliners
 would prefer a risk of war,
 while only 21 percent of the
 West Germans would advocate
 such a move.   Some dealings with
 East Germans on access would
 be acceptable to 41 percent in
 West Germany, while 38 percent
 were undecided.
 A majority of both West
 Germans and Berliners believed
 that the Western powers would
 "stand firm" in insisting on
 free access to Berlin.   Although
 the chances for unification
 were considered poor by over
 50 percent, a majority of those
 interviewed expected some worth-
 while results from the forth-
 coming East-West conferences.
 Eighty percent in Berlin and
 59 percent in West Germany ex-
 pected the Soviet Union to com-
 promise or back down on the
 Berlin question.
 Almost two thirds of the
 West Germans interviewed favored
 direct political negotiations
 between Bonn and the East'Ger-
 man"Government on unification,
 indicating that Bonn's policy
 of rejecting such negotiations
 is apparently not supported by
 the majority of the public.
 West Berlin opinion on the ques-
 tion.was almost evenly divided.
 Free elections, however, are
 considered an essential condi--
 tion for unification by a major-
 ity of those questioned.
 The poll shows a general
 indecisiveness over East-West
 troop withdrawals from Germany
 prior to unification.   While
 39 percent of the West Germans
 fell: that such a move would en-
 danger German security, 37 per-
 cent; believed it would not be
 dangerous or would make no dif-
 ference, and 24 percent were un-
 decided.
 Prime Minister Macmillan's
 decision not to call general
 elections this spring will tend
 to increase pressures on his
 government to,promote compro-
 mises in coming East-West ne-
 gotiations.   The elections,
 mandatory by May 1960, now are
 most likely in October.   The
 holding of elections soon after
 summit talks would place Mac-
 millan under maximum pressure
 to secure agreement there,  in
 view of the expected closeness
 of the electoral contest.
 Meanwhile, the government
 has publicly reiterated its
 endorsement of a special zone
 of arms limitation in Central
 Europe.   Despite the toning
 down of its controversial ideas
 for the sake of immediate agree-
 ment on a united Western posies'.
 tion for the Geneva foreign min-
 isters' meeting, Foreign Secre-
 tary Lloyd told Parliament on
 27 April that he believed ten-
 sion might be lessened by means
 of a special zone of arms limi-
 tation and inspection.   He did
 not tie this directl  to Ger-
 m n reunification.

 30 April 1959
 MIDDLE EAST HIGHLIGHTS
 Iraq
 New appointments to a re-
 vamped Iraqi cabinet still
 not been announced
 because lead-
 ers
 e National Democratic
 party (NDP)--the extreme left-
 wing element which forms the
 core of the present cabinet and
 which is collaborating with the
 Communists in a "national front"
 --are trying to bargain with the
 Communists in an effort to limit
 Communist influence.   The Commu-
 nists, in line with their appar-
 ent tactic of avoiding the ap-
 pearance of an abrupt take-over
 in Iraq, may agree  to  limit
 their participation in the cabi-
 net, but recent articles in the
 Iraqi Communist press indicate
 that they are seeking direct,
 open membership in the govern-
 ment for the first time since
 the revolution.
 The position of the NDP
 has almost certainly been seri-
 ously weakened by the departure
 last week  end  of  its chief,
 Kamil Chadirchi, for medical
 treatment in  the  USSR.
 The Communists meanwhile
 are further consolidating their
 position elsewhere in the coun-
 try.                 New instances of Cpmmunist-
 ifisp redi  terror tactics have
 occurred in Basra, in southern
 Iraq, where an army officer was
 killed by his own troops and
 where other officers apparently
 have been murdered following
 disputes with the Communist-
 dominated Popular Resistance
 Force.
 Economy Minister Kubba,who
 spearheads the Soviet economic
 penetration effort in Iraq,an-
 nounced on 27 April that he
 would seek revision of trade
 agreements with nonbloc states
 in order to bring Iraq's trade
 with the free world in line with
 the controlled economy he wants
 to impose on the country.
 Iraq's first budget, an-
 nounced this week, reflects the
 economic stagnation which now
 characterizes the country.   It
 shows an estimated d?ficit of
 more than $21,000,000, despite
 the fact that a higher propor-
 tion of oil revenue is to be
 used for current operations
 than was the practice under the
 Nuri government.   The deficit
 is due in large part, however,
 to a decline in world oil prices
 rather than to the specific
 practices of the regime.   Budg-
 eted military spending--and
 there is probably spending not
 included in the published fi-
 gures--will account for about
 $94,,000,000, about'.'.a third.'.. _
 of the planned total expenditure
 of $286,000,000.
 The Baghdad government aaso
 remains concerned over border
 problems with the UAR, Turkey,
 and Iran.
 A Turkish Foreign Ministry
 announcement on 26 April stated
 that some 700 Kurds have been
 given asylum in southern Turkey.
 This group reportedly comprises
 largely women and children, who
 have fled Iraq as a result of a
 dispute between the leader of
 their tribe and Mulla Mustafa
 Barz;ani, the pro-Soviet Kurdish
 leader.   The Kurds repatriated
 recently from the USSR to Iraq
 are 3arzanis.   The UAR apparent-
 ly is still hopeful that it can
 use the Shammar tribesmen who
 have been disturbing the Iraqi-
 Syrian border area.
 Ankara has become increas-
 ingly concerned over the Com-
 munist threat in Iraq and its
 implications for Turkish secu-
 rity.                                                       Prime Minister Menderes

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 April 1959
 has proposed immediate American-
 Turkish talks on Iraq and the
 Middle Eastern situation in
 general and maintains that the
 adoption of a common US-Turkish
 policy is a matter of utmost
 urgency.  While Ankara may still
 hope that Qasim can be persuaded
 of the Communist danger,   Tur-
 key's  action in giving asylum
 to Kurdish refugees from Iraq
 suggests that it is seeking to
 exert greater influence over
 the situation in Iraq even at
 the risk of jeopardizing its
 tenuous access to Qasim.
 UAR-Soviet Relations
 Soviet leaders are continu-
 ing their effort to convince
 Nasir that his long-term inter-
 ests will be best served by re-
 laxing his anti-Communist cam-
 paign.
 On 20 April Khrushchev
 sent Nasir a conciliatory 20-
 page letter in which he apolo-
 gized for his remark on 16 March
 that Nasir was using the "lan-
 guage of imperialism." He flat-
 tered the UAR President as "the
 only leader of the Arab world"
 and observed that Soviet support
 of Iraq merely. fulfilled Nasir's
 own request during his Moscow
 visit last summer. Khrushchev
 cautioned Nasir not to look to
 the West for aid, and observed
 that, despite the "humiliation"
 to which the USSR had been sub-
 jected by Nasir's remarks,Soviet
 aid would be forthcoming as prom-
 ised. for the Aswan High Dam. The
 Soviet leader concluded by pro-
 posing that Nasir call off the
 anti-Communist campaign. Khru-
 shchev reportedly added a per-
 sonal appeal by asserting that
 Nasir's attacks on him had hurt
 his position, since the Soviet
 policy toward the UAR is iden-
 tified as his own.
 Following up Khrushchev's
 letter, Radio Moscow this week
 announced that there is "no
 foundation" for "talk" of a stop-
 page of Soviet aid to the UAR,
 and the UAR High Dam Committee
 has been informed--almost three
 weeks'Ahead of schedule--that
 studies of detailed plans for
 construction of -the dam have
 been completed. The', Egyptian min-
 ister of public works, heading
 an,  expert committee,  is sched-
 uled to fly to Moscow next week
 for discussions.
 Nasir nevertheless report-
 edly said he intends to continue
 to attack Communism in the Arab
 world--although he might not re-
 peat his criticism of conditions
 in. the USSR and Eastern Europe.
 As a tactic to promote a quarrel
 between the Iraqi prime minister
 and the Communists, he has ordered
 all attacks on Qasim personally
 to cease.   In his recent speech-
 es, Nasir has followed this line,
 and has also included attacks

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 April 1959
 by its continuing criticism
 of Chinese actions., Peiping
 is stepping up fit-,,accusations
 against India.   It is attempt-
 ing to prove Indian complicity
 in the revolt by "documenting"
 charges that Tibetans in Kalim-
 pong "had asked the Indian Gov-
 ernment to carry                    out  open
 interference."  The  Chinese
 Communists  also  hope  to
 .keep pressure  on  New Delhi
 to  curtail  its  criticism
 by  charging  that  the Dalai
 Lama's  "abductors"  are  abet-
 ted  by  Indian  "expansion-
 ists."
 People's Daily on 26 April
 said   a ru s admission that
 the Dalai Lama wrote three
 letters to the Chinese repre-
 sentative in Tibet in an effort
 to avoid  an armed  clash in
 Lhasa "automatically  confirms"
 that the Tibetan leader  is
 "held under  duress." The Da-
 lai Lama                has  claimed  the
 letters   were "doctored" by
 Peiping.  This duress line is
 useful in Peiping's efforts
 to "prove" that the Dalai Lama
 supports  its  policies and to
 keep  the  door open  for  any
 future  negotiations with
 him.
 The Peiping press has main-
 tained its bitter tone toward
 all detractors.   An Indonesian
 newspaper was accused  of "dis-
 torting the facts" by suggest-
 ing Communist China did not
 recognize religion as a nation-
 al way of life.                The UAR was
 charged with "scurrilous  at-
 tacks" on China.  The crown
 prince of Sikkim was charged
 with "slander."
 Official Communist protests
 have been lodged with New Delhi
 over the defacing of Mao Tse-
 tung's portrait by a mob of
 tomato-hurling Indians, and
 Cambodian Premier Sihanouk's
 remark, made in France, that he
 would not have shown Nehru's
 restraint was reportedly pro-
 tested by the Chinese Communist
 ambassador in Phnom Penh last
 week.
 Prime Minister Nehru, re-
 acting to this tougher line,
 has lashed out  at  Peiping.
 Following his 24 April meeting
 with the Dalai Lama at Mussoorie,
 Nehru  categorically  denied
 charges  that the   Dalai  Lama
 had  been abducted.   He  "then
 launched his strongest rebuttal
 of Communist China's charges,
 accusing Peiping of using lan-
 guage                                                              of  the cold war     and
 maintaining  that its  charges
 against  India were  made "re-
 gardless of truth or propriety."
 Terming the charges "so    fan-
 tanstic, I find it difficult
 to deal with them," Nehru added
 that he had made a formal pro-
 test to Peiping.
 Nehru, clearly angered by
 the growing attacks on.India,
 despite his efforts to cairn. the
 situation, apparently believes
 that his past efforts to avoid
 recriminations have been inter-
 preted in Peiping as a sign of
 weakness.  He probably intends
 to make Communist China aware

 that while he hopes to keep the
 breach between New Delhi and
 Peiping from widening, a con-
 tinuation of such charges could
 have serious long-term effects
 on Sino-Indian relations.   Pei-
 ping, for its part, has kept
 the way clear for eventual rap-
 port with Nehru by avoidin
 personal attacks on him.
 CHINESE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT CHANGES
 The naming of Liu Shao-chi
 to the chairmanship of the Pei-
 ping regime is another indica-
 tion that Mao Tse-tung wishes
 Liu to succeed him eventually
 as chairman of the Chinese Com-
 munist party.  The government
 post, although largely ceremo-
 nial, adds to Liu's prestige
 and will facilitate the task
 of building up the image of Liu
 as a benign father-figure like
 Mao.
 No significant change in
 the Chinese Communist scene
 is expected to result.   Both
 Mao and Liu--who has identified
 himself closely with Mao and
 his policies--advocated a close
 relationship with the USSR
 while preserving China's free-
 dom from Soviet control.
 Mao told the party last
 December he did not want to be
 nominated for the government
 chairmanship again because he
 wanted to devote his time to
 theory and questions of nation-
 al policy.   Shortly thereafter,
 the regime began to encourage
 discussion of Vice Chairman
 Chu Te for the top government
 post.  Chou, as an esteemed
 party elder with nothing much
 to do, seemed the right man
 for the .ob.

 Mao,   apparently changed his

 tributed to this, contending
 that he was too old (72) or
 lacked the ability to deal ef-
 fectively with foreign visitors.
 Moreover, Liu himself may have
 decided he wanted the post and
 persuaded Mao to give it to
 him.   In any case, it is virtu-
 ally certain that the appoint-
 ment is a mark of favor for
 Liu, not a "kick upstairs."
 The most important govern-
 ment post, the premiership,
 will remain in Chou's hands.

 --which probably is the basis
 of his power in the party--ap-

 Chou's new cabinet--ap-

 of the National People's Con-

 same as the previous one, al-
 though four deputy premiers have
 been added.  These include the
 party's principal spokesmen on
 agriculture and on propaganda,
 and the regime's public securi-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SAY
 30 April 1959
 COMMUNIST CHINA_ TEMPERS OPTIMISM ON ECONOMIC PLAN
 The session of the Chinese
 Communist National People's
 Congress just concluded has
 given its stamp of approval to
 the regime's highly ambitious
 1959 plan and budget.   Based on
 the leadership's belief that
 the economy can continue to leap
 ahead in 1959 at rates which
 compare favorably with those
 said to have been achieved last
 year, these plans reflect the
 general air of economic optimism
 prevalent at the congress. There
 was a growing recognition, how-
 ever, that achievement of these
 objectives would not be easy.
 The principal
 speakers at the con-
 gress pointed out that
 despite the undoubted
 victories of the re-
 gime's policies in
 general, there was
 little ground for
 complacency, since
 China was still poor
 and unable to meet
 all the demands of
 its huge population
 and expanding economy.
 They admitted that
 shortages of materials,
 power, and transport
 would continue to
 plague the rapid in-
 dustrialization drive,
 that the lack of ma-
 chinery, chemical fer-
 tilizer, and adequate
 protection against ca-
 lamities would hamper
 agricultural develop-
 zlYent, and that the
 output of daily nec-
 essities would con-
 tinue to lag behind
 demand.
 The ~ speakers
 enumerated "not a few
 shortcomings" which
 have characterized
 the leap to date and which the
 regime is aiming to overcome
 this year.   It will, for example,
 try to overcome the lack of di-.
 rection evident in the enthusi-
 astic pursuit of many of the re-
 gime's programs by a close in-
 sistence on a state-directed
 system of strict priorities in
 both construction and production.
 In industry the priority
 system starts with steel, since,
 as Premier Chou En-lai observed,
 an insufficient supply has "ham-
 pered" the growth of the entire
 economy.   Thus the weight of the

 industrial production effort
 this year and a large share of

 In agriculture, priority
 is to be given to ensuring that
 the regime's seemingly extrava-
 gant grain and cotton targets
 will be reached,   To help achieve
 this, misuses of rural manpower
 and irrationality in some agri-
 cultural practices are to be
 corrected.   Tong Tzu-hui, a
 leading spokesman on agriculture
 in earlier days, told the con-
 gress that shortages of rural
 manpower had led to improper
 gathering and handling of late
 crops last year, resulting in
 an anomaly which he described
 as "high production but not a
 bumper harvest."
 Premier Chou En-lai has
 directed that at least 80 per-
 cent of rural manpower should
 be assigned to farming and re-
 lated tasks like forestry, ani-
 mal husbandry, and fishing.  In-

 munes, he said, should be pro-

 in mind,"  Touching on some of
 the new farming practices popu-
 larized during last year's leap,
 Chou cautioned that they should
 not be applied "indiscriminately."
 Tong Tzu-hui reported that
 crop failures had been caused
 in some areas last year by in-
 judicious close planting and
 ,recommended that new methods be
 completely proved in experimental
 plots before being widely used.
 He also played down the effec
 tiveness?of some water conserv..
 anoy` projects and stressed, as
 did other speakers,the continued
 dependence of Chinese agriculture
 on the weather.
 Public recital of diffi-
 culties such as these is not
 new in China,although they were
 generally played down during
 the height of the leap.   The
 growing prominence given them
 at this time suggests that Pei-
 ping is beginning to lay the
 groundwork for a gradual easing
 of the intensive pace of the
 giant leap.,

 INTRAPARTY DIFFERENCES FLARE UP IN EAST GERMANY
 The present drive in East
 Germany to increase production
 may well reopen the fundamental
 conflict between economic real-
 ists and doctrinaire party bu-
 reaucrats which led last year
 to the purge of Karl Schirdewan
 and Others opposing party boss
 Ulbricht's program of accelerat-
 ed socialization.   As a result,
 those of Ulbricht's critics who
 still hold office are likely to
 find their positions increasing-
 ly difficult.
 The regime's demand for
 major increases in production
 will place new strains on the
 party organization and may fur-
 ther undercut the position of
 the remaining moderates.  The
 regime is,attempting to under-
 cut opposition to its econom-
 ic policies by the use of in-
 centive plans and wage increas-
 es.   Nevertheless, East German
 workers are said to be "testy
 and assertive" in the face of
 the regime's demands.  One pro-
 Ulbricht functionary reportedly
 summed up the situation:   "If
 we don't attain our goal, the
 masses will laugh at us.   If
 we do reach it, we'll have lost
 the workers."
 Like Schirdewan, Selbmann
 was dropped from the Socialist
 Unity (Communist) party (SED)
 central committee because of
 his opposition to the economic
 policies and tactics of Ulbricht.
 Despite self-criticism at the
 party congress last summer,Selb-
 mann, has remained in a precar-
 ious professional and political
 position.   Ulbricht has several
 times included him in general
 charges of factionalism and "con-
 servatism" leveled at Schirdewan
 and in addition has charged him
 with failing to wage a suffi'
 ciently resolute struggle a-
 gainst "enemy agencies."  Selb-
 mann, not a Moscow-trained pro-
 fessional bureaucrat like Ul-
 bricht, often came into conflict
 with Moscow-trained top party
 officials when he was one of
 the leading figures in East
 German industry,
 The regime in recent weeks
 has been conducting a campaign
 against middle- and low-level
 party functionaries suspected
 of sympathies for Schirdewan
 and opposition to accelerated
 socialization.   The regime's
 campaign is in line with Ul-
 bricht's demand at the fourth
 party plenum for elimination
 of all such elements,  andl
 some such officials have been

 has permission to open a con-
 sulate in Katmandu, may also
 press for establishment of an
 embassy.
 The decision was announced
 by Moscow on 23 April and in
 Katmandu on 24 April following
 the signing of two agreements
 covering Soviet economic assist-
 ance in the form of outright
 grants of about $7,500,000 to
 Nepal.   These agreements pro-
 vide for a hospital, construc-
 tion of 'power plants, sugar
 factory, a cigarette  factory,
 and a survey for an east-west
 road.   The Soviet ambassador
 to New Delhi, Ponomarenko, who
 is also accredited to Nepal,
 believes the embassy in Katmandu
 will be opened  by summer, and
 that the technicians will ar-
 rive by duly,                   These specialists
 are to supervise construction
 and train Nepali hospital per-
 sonnel.
 Ponomare.nko is being re-
 placed in New Delhi by I. A.
 Benediktov, who served as ambas-
 sador there for five months in
 1953.   It is not known whether
 Benediktov will also be appoint-
 ed to head the new mission in
 Nepal.
 The agreements apparently
 were pushed through by a small
 Nepali government-palace clique,
 including disgruntled lame-duck
 ministers defeated in the re-
 cent national elections which
 resulted in a landslide victory
 for the Congress party.  Ac-
 cording to the Katmandu news-
 paper Kalpana, which reflects
 Congress pay views, the agree-
 ment to establish embassies was
 made without the party's knowledge,
 This is supported by the' fact; that
 General Subarno, chairman of
 the Council of Ministers and
 a Congress leader who opposed
 the agreement, was absent from
 Katmandu at the time.
 Kalpana  accused  the
 Nepalese oreign   Ministry
 of "international adventur-
 ism"  and  said  it  is  in-
 volving                                                             the      country  in
 power  blocs.   The paper's
 report  suggests  that the
 new  government, which  is
 soon to  take  office, may
 stall on  the  openin   of
 the  Soviet  embassy.
 The Communist bloc's in-
 fluence in Cambodia is growing.
 There is a continuing belief
 among Cambodian leaders that
 the United States was involved
 in some degree in the recent
 Sam Sary - Dap Chhuon plotting
 against the Sihanouk govern-
 ment.   Tape recordings of  Pre-
 mier Sihanouk's demagogic
 speeches, in which he virtually
 said that the United States was
 a co-conspirator with South
 Vietnam and Thailand, are being
 broadcast in provincial centers
 throughout Cambodia.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 April 1959
 In contrast, Sihanouk's
 critical remarks regarding
 Chinese Communist repression
 in Tibet--made in an interview
 in France, where he is con-
 valescing from a recent opera-
 tion--have been suppressed in
 the Cambodian press.  This ap-
 parently resulted both from
 pressure by the Chinese Commu-
 nist and Soviet embassies in
 Phnom Penh and from the incre-
 dulity of Cambodian officials
 that Sihanouk had been quoted
 correctly.
 Communist influence in the
 Cambodian Ministry of Informa-
 tion has become increasingly
 apparent during  the  past year
 and the Cambodian press now is
 oriented toward the left.  The
 growing role of radio as a
 propaganda medium is indicated
 by Communist China's supplying
 of three transmitters to the
 Sihanouk government; one medium-
 wave unit already is in opera-
 tion and two for short-wave
 broadcasting are to be ready by
 the end of this year.   The Cam-
 bodian market has been flooded
 with low-priced radio receivers
 made in Communist China, and
 radio stations in Peiping and
 Hanoi. have stepped up their
 Cambodian- and Chinese-language
 broadcasts beamed to Cambodia.
 In addition to exploiting
 radio in Cambodia for internal
 subversion, the Communist bloc
 probably hopes to derive prop-
 aganda gains from a multilingual
 international broadcasting pro-
 gram envisaged by Cambodia with
 its new facilities.   Sihanouk
 has referred to Peiping's "gen-
 erous" assistance as providing
 Cambodia with the means to break
 out of its international isola-
 tion and to "answer victoriously
 the gross calumnies and insults"
 of certain foreign press and
 radio sources.   Current anti-
 Sihanouk broadcasting by "Radio
 Free Cambodia"--a clandestine
 operation apparently supported
 by South Vietnam and Thailand--
 and -a threatened renewal of the
 Phnom Penh - Saigon press war
 can only serve to perpetuate Cam-
 motives.
 bodia's  distrust of free world
 Prime Minister Sarit re-
 turned to Bangkok on 27 April
 amid reports that Lt. Gen. Krit
 Punnakan may be plotting a coup
 against him.   Krit, who like
 most of the other leaders of
 Thailand's ruling military
 clique,  is pro-Western and anti-
 Communist, has long been at odds
 with Sarit.   Although Sarit has
 sought to reduce Krit's power
 by placing him in an unimpor-
 tant staff position, Krit is
 popular among junior officers--
 who are perennially dissatis-
 fied with their share of the
 spoils--and is believed to re-
 tain substantial support among
 the armored units which he
 formerly commanded.   Moreover,
 his brother, Maj. Gen.  Pony;
 Punnakan, holds the lucrative
 Communications Ministry port-
 folio in Sarit's cabinet.
 Sarit is probably aware of
 Krit's machinations.   While he
 would probably prefer to avoid
 an early showdown, Sarit may
 feel it essential to his con-
 tinued control to deal decisive-
 ly with the problem of Krit's
 disaffection before it assumes
 more serious proportions.  His
 most likely solution would be
 to order Krit out of the country
 on some face-saving diplomatic
 assignment.   Such a course might
 cause considerable tension with-
 in the military group, but Sarit
 probably has ample power at this
 point to accomplish it.

 30 April 1959
 At the governmental level,
 Sarit and his colleagues have
 been preoccupied with economic
 matters.   In addition to coping
 with the chronic problems of
 sluggish retail trade and "c,reep-
 ing inflation," Sarit is anxious
 to accelerate the pace of Thai-
 land's economic development by
 attracting substantial foreign
 investment.   Several proposed
 ventures now are under consid-
 eration,  including competing
 offers by Shell-Stanvac and
 Standard Oil of Indiana to
 build a 25,000-barrel-per-day
 refinery.
 There are indications that
 former Premier Pridi Phanomyong
 wishes to leave Communist China,
 where he has been in exile for
 ten years.   However, his implica-
 tion in the 1946 regicide case re-
 mains a serious obstacle to his
 return to Thailand. Sarit and
 other Thai leaders are said to
 regard Pridi as potentially of
 great use as an economic adviser.
 It is also open to question, how-
 ever, that Peiping would permit
 Pridi to leave China, particularly
 if he has broken with the Commu-
 nists as recent reports have
 claimed.
 Recent events in Singapore
 appear to have enhanced the pros-
 pect that the Conun=ist-infil-
 trated People's Action party
 (PAP) will form the next govern-
 ment with a clear majority in
 the island's first legislative
 assembly to be entirely elected.
 The elections on 30 May will
 immediately precede the grant-
 ing of a large measure of self-
 government to the new State of
 Singapore.
 Filing of candidacies by
 the other Singapore parties re-
 flects the nearly complete col-
 lapse of Chief Minister Lim Yew
 Hock's plans for forming an anti-
 PAP coalition to prevent split-
 ting the vote among moderate and
 conservative voters. Lim's mod-
 erate Singapore People's Alli-
 ance  nominated 39 candidates
 and the conservative Liberal So-
 cialists 32.   In addition, there
 are 34 independent candidates
 as well as numerous nominees
 representing ten other parties,
 most of whom will add to the
 fragmentation of the moderate
 vote.   Even Lim may have trouble
 retaining an assembly seat in
 his supposedly "safe" district,
 since the'non-PAP vote will be
 split with his bitter enemy,
 former Chief Minister David
 Marshall, and with a Liberal
 Socialist candidate.
 The group of well-known
 PAP candidates was bolstered
 by the party's nomination of
 the popular former mayor of
 Singapore,  Ong Eng Guan,  and
 12 city councilors following
 the resignation of Ong and the
 entire city council faction on
 18 April.   On nomination day,
 the PAP was the only party to
 file a complete slate of candi-
 dates for all 51 assembly seats.
 Initial analysis of the candidate
 lists indicates that the party
 has averted serious competition
 from other left-wing parties
 and independent candidates.
 Despite the apparently in-
 creased friction between the
 PAP "moderates" and the pro-
 Connnunist left wing, the party
 is expected to avoid an open
 split prior to the elections.
 Indications are growing, however,
 that a serious fight may develop
 shortly  after; the  election
 which could easily result in

 JAPANESE CONSERVATIVES
 The decisive victories of
 Japan's ruling conservative par-
 ty over the opposition Social-
 ists in the 23 April elections
 for key gubernatorial and munic-
 ipal posts stemmed the pro-So-
 cialist trend of recent years
 and should provide a favorable
 climate for the conservatives
 in the upper-house election in
 early June.   They should also
 strengthen Prime Minister K.ishi's
 personal position and quell,
 at least temporarily, dissident
 elements in the party.   The So-
 cialist leadership is certain
 to come under fire from both
 the right and left wings, and
 the party's adverse showing
 will possibly weaken its unity.
 With approximately 80 per-
 cent of the electorate voting,
 conservatives were elected in
 18 of the 20 gubernatorial con-
 tests, including the key gov-
 ernorships  of Tokyo, Osaka,
 an  Hokkaido.   Socialists were
 elected governors only in
 Fukuoka and Ibaragi prefectures,
 Conservatives won mayoral races
 in the important cities of
 Osaka and Yokohama and, despite
 some Socialist gains, the con-
 servatives maintained over-
 whelming control in Japan's 46
 prefectural assemblies.   Most
 Japanese commentators tenta-
 some of the moderate candidates.
 It is doubtful, however,  if
 any  action  taken  by  him
 at this late date,  short of
 instigating disorders to force
 postponement of  the elections,
 can reverse  the trend    to-
 ward  a  PAP                                                             election  victory.

 tively  agree that young voters
 were less inclined than in pre.-
 vious elections to support So-
 cialist candidates.
 While local issues and per-
 sonalities were major factors in
 the outcome, both parties made
 foreign policy an issue in the
 major contests.   The conserva-
 tive party charged the Social-
 ists with "pro-Communism" be-
 cause of their recent endorse-
 ment of the Chinese Communist
 position on several Asian ques-
 tions,  and the Socialists at-
 tackEed the US-Japanese security
 treaty.  Conservative victories,
 at least in the big cities, ap-
 pear to reflect some popular
 disillusionment with the Socic,.--

 the postwar period,   The new con-

 the Council for the Republic,
 and thus possesses a closer

 than the rightist-dominated Na-

 a political role almost equal

 permitting the evolution of
 autonomous republics into sov-

 probably goes far beyond any-
 thing contemplated by Paris.
 French representatives at Dakar
 reportedly are already recon-

 will soon be independent.
 Meanwhile, Felix Houphouet-

 Ivory Coast,, is developing a
 pro-French Community grouping
 based on economic cooperation
 between his resources-rich pub-
 lic and the underdeveloped re-
 publics of Volta, Niger, and
 Dahomey.   The Ivory Coast ap-

 states., to enter into a customs
 union, and to share in the con-

 interior.
 If economic cooperation
 should spread beyond the pres-

 of former French West Africa--
 Senegal, Soudan, and Mauritania
 --it might be possible to re-

 if, as is likely, Ivory Coast
 economic assistance develops
 into political influence--

 30 April 1959
 AUSTRIA'S GENERAL ELECTIONS
 The campaigning for the
 10 May parliamentary elections
 has further stimulated strong
 pressures for drastic revision
 of the coalition pact which has
 given Austria a stable and
 strongly pro-Western government
 since 1945.   It still seems
 likely that the People's party
 and the Socialists will recon-
 stitute the coalition in some
 form, but a radical shift in
 party strengths as a result of
 the elections might make it ex-
 tremely difficult to achieve a
 coalition agreement at all.
 While both major parties
 are nominally in favor of the
 coalition, several
 developments have
 combined to make it
 the only really con--
 troversial election
 issue.  During the
 past two years, in-
 terparty relations
 have progressively
 deteriorated to the
 point where govern-
 ment operations have
 become extremely dif-
 ficult.  Moreover,

 upper ranks of both parties has
 caused many to question the
 system of allocating public of-
 fices on a rigidly proportioned
 basis.
 Ostensibly in an effort to
 meet these problems, the People's
 party has declared its inten-
 tion to revise the coalition
 agreement so as to deprive
 either party of a "veto."  Under
 the proposed system, the two
 parties would be required to
 concert their views only on
 foreign policy and financial
 questions; all other issues
 would be resolved by parliamen-

 SOVIET OVERTURES FOR WESTERN CREDITS
 The USSR has renewed its
 search for credits to finance
 growing imports from Western
 industrial countries... Soviet
 representatives are probing
 Western European governments,
 financial institutions, and
 exporters in an attempt to
 secure government loans, gov-
 ernment-guaranteed credits,
 and long-term. commercial credits.
 During British Prime Minister
 Macmillan's recent visit to
 Moscow, Khrushchev sought five-
 year credits worth a total of
 $700,000,000 to run from 1959
 to 1963.
 The Soviet Union's demand
 for Western equipment, particu-
 larly for the chemical industry,
 is greater than its ability to
 finance purchases in the West
 through exports, despite efforts
 to increase sales to the free
 world.   The USSR presumably also
 wishes to secure credits to
 permit it to develop a reputa-
 tion as a reliable long-run.

 on the ballot in 1949, they have
 recently shown some revival of
 strength in local elections.
 Disappearance of the coal-

 While the People's party and
 the Socialists have reconciled
 many of the differences which
 brought their predecessor
 parties to armed conflict in the
 1930s, it is not entirely cer-
 tain the fundamental antago-

 and the emergence of the Liberals
 in a "balance-of-power" role
 would sharpen these antagonisms.
 A Soviet purchasing mis-

 The wide
 range of equipment and goods
 involved reveals a Soviet at-

 from numerous industries for
 government participation in

 of goods to the USSR.   The Soviet
 group reportedly also urged
 Italian producers "not to miss
 the favorable turning point in
 Soviet foreign trade" but to
 procure five-year credits to
 enable the USSR to purchase a

 the group alleged it could get

 PART III
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 THE PROBLEM OF WESTERN ACCESS TO BERLIN
 The Western powers' rights
 of access to Berlin derive from
 their participation in the de-
 feat of Germany in World War II
 and the agreements reached with
 the USSR concerning the postwar
 occupation.   These are embodied
 in a number of documents includ-
 ing a London agreement of Sep-
 tember 1944 and an exchange of
 letters between President Tru-
 man and Stalin, and
 a verbal agreement be-
 tween General Clay and
 Marshal Zhukov during
 the summer of 1945.
 The Paris Agreement
 of 1949 terminating
 the Berlin blockade
 is also relevant.
 There is, however,
 no single document
 signed by all four
 powers providing for
 unrestricted access
 to the city by sur-
 face and air. Allied
 rights are based on
 precedent and usage.
 At the time of
 the Soviet-East Ger-
 man treaty of 1955
 which granted "sov-
 ereignty" to East
 Germany, there was
 an exchange of let-
 ters between East
 German Foreign Min-
 ister Bolz and Soviet
 Deputy Foreign Minis-
 ter Zorin in which
 the USSR stated that
 it would "temporar-
 ily" retain control
 of Allied access to
 Berlin pending the
 `-,REPUBLIC
 '
 conclusion of further agree-
 ments with the Allies.   It is
 the Soviet contention that the
 USSR's planned peace treaty
 with East Germany will inval-
 idate all Allied occupation
 agreements, including those
 governing control of access to
 West Berlin.  This control
 would then pass to the "sover-
 eign" East German regime.
 Road and Rail Access
 The West's right to ground
 access to Berlin was established
 during a June 1945 meeting be-
 tween General Clay, Marshal Zhu-
 kov, and a British representa-
 tive,  The memorandum of conver-
 sationL resulting from this meet-
 ing was never authenticated,
 however.                                                                                   The agreement has, in
 practice, been interpreted to
 mean that the Allies would sub-
 mit to Soviet traffic regula-
 tions and document checks but
 not to inspection of vehicles
 or cargo.   Zhukov stated at the

 meeting that he did not deny
 the right of Allied access, but
 that the Soviet Union would not
 "give a corridor."      The agree-
 ment is vague enough to be open
 to honest differences of opin-
 ion by both sides and has given
 the USSR manifold opportunities
 to harass traffic.
 All Allied road traffic
 must travel via the Helmstedt-
 Berlin autobahn.  There are
 three other routes open to non-
 Allied nationals, but 80 per-
 cent of all road traffic goes
 via Helmstedt.   Some 37 percent
 of Berlin's imports and 57 per-
 cent of its exports by tonnage
 go by road.   Of military inter-
 est is the fact that the 105-
 mile stretch in East Germany
 includes 47 bridges (the Elbe
 bridge is over 1,200 yards
 long, including 160 yards over
 water) and 91 overpasses. There
 are Allied, West German, Soviet,
 and East German barriers or
 checkpoints at each end.
 After passing the Western
 checkpoints, Allied vehicles
 come to a barrier manned by
 East Germans which normally is
 raised automatically.  Then
 comes the Soviet checkpoint,
 where the movement order--is-
 sued unilaterally by Allied
 military authorities--is
 stamped, but the delay is
 generally longer than would
 seem necessary.  The Allied
 vehicle driver or convoy com-
 mander is given a small white
 form when he leaves the Soviet
 checkpoint.  This is surren-
 dered at another East German
 barrier--some 75 yards farther
 inside East Germany--which nor-
 mally is raised without ques-
 tion.
 The form appears to be no
 more than permission from the
 Russians to the East Germans to
 permit the vehicle to proceed.
 This procedure for passing
 through an East German   manned
 barrier gives the East Germans
 a foot in the door toward full
 control of access. When Allied
 vehicles leave East Germany go-
 ing east or west, the East Ger-
 mans merely raise the barriers
 and no white form is involved.
 The Russians do, however, check
 the travel documents at their
 checkpoint.
 All Allied rail traffic
 and all rail freight goes via
 the Marienborn-Berlin rail line,
 which roughly parallels the
 Helmstedt autobahn.   There are
 five other interzonal rail lines
 in use.   Some 35 percent of West
 Berlin's imports and 21 percent
 of its exports, by tonnage, as
 well as 98 percent of Allied
 freight to the Berlin garrisons,
 are handled by rail.   Allied
 trains while in East Germany are
 hauled by East German locomotives
 with ].3ast German crews.
 The Allies operate 24 reg-
 ularly scheduled trains per
 week, with the arrangements be-
 ing made between West and East
 German railway officials.  There
 are a considerable number of
 similar low-level trade and com-
 mercial agreements between the
 two railroad systems.   There is
 only one checkpoint on the rail
 line, four miles from the zonal
 border at Marienborn.   Allied
 trains have no contact with East
 German officials; processing is
 handled by the Russians.
 Air Access
 The question of air access
 is the only one governed by a
 properly authenticated document.
 This was approved by the Allied
 Control Council in 1945 and up-
 dated in 1949.   There are a num-
 ber of  points, however, which
 are not entirely clear:   one is
 whether the Allies have exclu-
 sive or priority rights to the
 three air corridors.  Thus far
 the Russians have, in general,
 appeared to recognize that the
 Allies have exclusive rights,
 since they have seldom used the
 corridors themselves.
 The most pressing question
 is that of minimum and maximum

 altitudes.   A maximum altitude
 of 10,000 feet was mentioned
 in a draft of the 1945 agree-
 ment, but did not appear in the
 final document.  There is a
 10,000-foot altitude limit with-
 in 20 miles of Berlin.
 The air space.  around Ber--
 lin, known as the Berlin Control
 Zone, is administered by one
 of the two remaining quadripar-
 tite bodies:   the Berlin Air
 Safety Center (BASC). The group
 administering Spandau Prison is
 the other such body. The BASC,
 located in West Berlin, coordi-
 nates traffic in and out of the
 three airfields in West Berlin
 and the one airfield just out-
 side East Berlin but within
 the Berlin Control Zone.   This
 does not mean, however, that
 the Soviet Union normally sub-
 mits its flight plans to the
 BASC, as the Allies do; the
 USSR schedules its flights so
 as not to conflict with Allied
 flights.
 In addition to military
 traffic, three civil air lines
 from the three Allies regular-
 ly operate to and from West
 Berlin.   None of the naviga-
 tional aids, such as beacons
 or radars, servicing the three
 corridors are in East Germany.
 Air travel to Berlin is
 the only means.of travel which
 is not subject to Communist
 control.  This freedom made
 possible the Berlin airlift;
 it also enables the Allies to
 transport East German refugees
 from West Berlin to West Ger-
 many.
 The Allied garrisons
 could be supplied almost indef-
 initely by airlift if a sur-
 face blockade were enforced--
 even if the Communists jammed
 Allied air navigational aids,
 making all but visual flights
 impossible.   An airlift could
 not, however, sustain the West
 Berlin civil population if
 surface  access  were  de-
 nied.
 Canal Traffic
 Barge traffic via the ex-
 tensive canal and river system
 is of considerable importance
 to West Berlin, although not
 to the Allies.   Some 2,600
 West German barges are licensed
 for interzonal movement, and
 last year they carried some 25
 percent of all freight in and
 out of West Berlin.   All canals
 and locks in East Germany are
 controlled by the East Germans.
 As in the case of rail access,
 arrangements for barge traffic
 are made at a technical level
 between West and East German
 authorities.  The canals were
 closed during the Berlin block-
 ade, and since then the East
 Germans have from time to time
 harassed traffic by closing the
 locks "for repairs."
 RESUMPTION OF POLITICAL CONTROVERSY ON CYPRUS
 The spirit of conciliation
 on Cyprus which grew out of the
 signing of the London agree-
 ments in February is being dis-
 sipated by acts of violence
 committed by rightist Greek
 Cypriots against leftist Greek
 Cypriots as well as against the
 British.   In addition, the fa-

 The London agreement es-

 functions of government from
 the British.
 A constitutional committee
 is also meeting on Cyprus, while
 in London a joint committee is
 negotiating on such matters as
 British base rights and the
 treaties guaranteeing the in-
 dependence of Cyprus.  The con-
 stitutional and joint committees

 next spring.

 (SEK) in order to recruit mem-
 bers at the expense of the is-
 land's largest trade union, the
 Communist Pan-Cyprian Federa-
 tion of Labor (PEO).
 Of the seven "provisional
 ministers" chosen by Makarios,
 two were high-ranking EOKA
 leaders and most of the others
 had cooperated with EOKA.   The
 average age of these Greek
 Cypriot "provisional ministers"
 is 32.   Few have been prominent
 in politics or civil affairs on
 Cyprus.
 Since his selections pro-
 vided no representation for con-
 servative business or left-wing
 elements, Makarios included
 representatives of these groups
 in a widely representative 50-
 man advisory council.   He has
 also publicly urged Governor
 Foot to end the ban on the Com-
 munist party--the Reform Party
 of the Working People (AKEL).
 Turkish and Greek Cypriots
 The concern of the Turkish
 Cypriots over the youth and ex-
 tremist background of the mem-
 bers of Makarios' provisional
 cabinet, as well as his appeal
 to end the ban on AKEL, was
 probably responsible for the
 Turkish Cypriots' pressing their
 political and economic demands
 more vigorously than previously.
 The London agreements stipulated
 that the Greek Cypriots would
 select seven of the ten "provi-
 sional ministers" and that the
 Turkish Cypriots would select
 three, including one of the im-
 portant ministries.   When the
 transitional committee  dis-
 cussed how the posts would be
 distributed, the hard bargain-
 ing engaged in by the Turkish
 and Greek Cypriots destroyed
 some of the good will which had
 prevailed on both sides.
 The agreements left for
 later negotiation the status of
 separate Turkish and Greek Cyp-
 riot municipal authorities in
 the five major towns on Cyprus.
 Makarrios' public statement that
 the London agreement never rec-
 ognized any Turkish Cypriot right
 to administer separate zones in-
 creased the Turkish Cypriots'
 suspicions and caused them to
 press their campaign for eco-
 nomic self-sufficiency more
 vigorously.   However, Makarios
 now apparently has agreed to a
 compromise on the Turkish Cyp-
 riots' demands to administer
 their own municipal zones.
 Turkish Cypriot leader Dr.
 Fazi1L Kucuk visited Ankara last
 month and sought a $5,600,000
 loan to assist his followers in
 developing cooperatives and other
 enterprises.   Since his return,
 other Turkish Cypriot leaders
 are encouraging Turkish Cypriot
 landowners living in predom-
 inantly Greek Cypriot areas to
 sell their farms and move to
 Turkish areas on Cyprus.   Such
 efforts to achieve partition in
 economic and geographic terms
 face major obstacles, since Turk-
 ish and Greek Cypriot landhold-
 ings throughout the island can-
 not be separated easily ,and
 the  Greeks are  more' experi-
 enced  businessmen  and  trad-
 ers.
 Makarios' statement to the
 press in March that no inhabited
 areas should be included in the
 bases to be retained by Britain
 has added to the difficulty of
 solving the base problem.
 In the declarations pub-
 lished after the London talks,
 Britain agreed to cede sover-
 eignty over the island with
 the specific exception of two
 base areas.   The British now
 are determining the precise
 limits of the areas they will
 require.   While British Defense
 Minister Sandys has recently
 expressed willingness to take
 Makarios' views into considera-
 tion, it seems unlikely that
 the base areas, located in the
 populous sections of the island,
 could entirely exclude inhabited
 places.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 April 1959
 Future Implications
 The former EOKA leaders,
 now at the peak of their pop-
 ularity, are publicly committed
 to cooperate with Makarios.
 Their acceptance of prominent
 roles in the provisional cab-
 inet, the major rightist polit-
 ical party, and other right-
 wing organizations may keep
 their energies within normal
 political channels.   However,
 the individuals who now lead
 EDMA could be an unstable in-
 fluence.   They might resort to
 their old habits of intimida-
 tion and violence, particular-
 ly  if AKEL resumed activity
 as a legal party or if the Com-
 munist union, PEO, countered
 rightist efforts to win away
 its members.   Greek Cypriots
 have already clashed with po-
 lice, who prevented them from
 posting  EDMA  slogans  on
 walls.
 The Communists on Cyprus,
 apparently wanting to avoid
 open competition for popular
 support while the right wing
 is at the peak of its popu-
 larity, appear to be limiting
 their response to EDMA's pre-
 dominant position.   They have
 only remonstrated that EDMA
 should adopt policies which
 would allow all Greek Cypriots
 to rally behind it.   They prob-
 ably expect their own strength
 to increase as factional splits
 occur and individual rivalries
 for posts in the government de-
 velop among  the   non- Com-
 munists.
 Andreas Ziartides, the
 capable leader of PEO, appears
 willing to support Makarios'
 candidates for the legislative
 elections, to be held sometime
 in 1960.   Bargaining appears to
 be in progress over the legis-
 lative seats the Communists
 should get in return for their
 cooperation.   Makarios appears
 desirous of maintaining the. sup-
 port of all Greek Cypriots dur-
 ing the transition to independ-
 ence.
 George Grivas, leader of
 the EOKA terrorists, has left
 Cyprus, has renounced any fur-
 ther personal political role,
 and has urged all Greek Cyp-
 riots  to  unite  behind Maka-,
 rios,
 Governor Foot believes
 Makarios has capitulated to the
 EOKA elements in the provisional
 cabinet choices and that they
 may have exerted pressure on
 him.   EOKA appears to be urg-
 ing Makarios to have a showdown
 with the Communists while right-
 ist elements are still stronger
 than the Communists.
 Probably the key factor in
 Makarios' tactics is his desire
 to retain personal political
 power.   His remarks to the press
 on British base rights and Turk-
 ish separate municipal zones ap-
 pear to reflect a desire to re-
 tain his support in the face of
 extremist contenders for leader-
 ship, like Bishop Kyprianos of
 Kyrenia, who still loudly de-
 mands union with Greece.
 For their part, the Turkish
 Cypriots can be expected to re-
 spond to any further hard bar-
 gaining by the Greek Cypriots
 with extreme demands of their
 own.   Since the Turkish Cypriots
 are generally subject to close
 control from Ankara, however,
 they are unlikely to remain un-
 cooperative in the face of An-
 kara's desire for a settlement.
 While Athens' influence over the
 Greek Cypriots is less direct,
 Greece is likely to influence
 Makarios against actions which
 would seriously endanger ;the
 achievement of independence

 30 April 1959
 During the past year, the
 European Economic Community
 (EEC) or Common Market has come
 to play an increasingly impor-
 tant role in the economics and
 politics of the free world.
 While nonmembers view the six-
 nation Common Market's future
 relations with the international
 trading community with suspi-
 cion and concern  the organiza-
 tion seems bound to play an
 influential role in determin-
 ing the rules which govern world
 trade.   Whether that influence
 will be cohesive or divisive
 will depend largely on the res-
 olution of conflicting tendencies
 which have already become ap-
 parent.
 The "Hallstein Report"
 The reaction in Western
 Europe to a report prepared
 early in March by President
 Hallstein of the EEC Commission
 has disclosed the complexity
 of the problems posed by the
 community.   Compiled at the
 request of the EEC Council,
 which wanted a solution to the
 deadlocked dispute over the
 proposed Free Trade Area (FTA),
 the report instead was an at-
 tempt to write a general for-
 eign policy for the community.
 The report's central thesis
 is that since the Common Market
 has joined the  United States
 and Britain as one of the three
 major forces in the free world
 economy, it has assumed world-
 wide responsibilities.   Accord-
 ingly, the EEC's priority objec-
 tives must be to participate in
 a program of assistance to the
 underdeveloped countries and
 actively support the  General
 Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
 (GATT).   In this larger context,
 the problems posed by the FTA
 would themselves be minimized,
 and interim intra-European trade
 concessions might pave the way
 for a broader European economic
 association.
 Politics and a European Policy
 Since its official release,
 the Hallstein report has been
 severely criticized, particularly
 by those who are reluctant to
 see the commission establish
 itself as spokesman for  the
 community.   Much of this criti-
 cism has reflected the funda-
 mental conflicts within the
 European movement, the extent
 of which was indicated in an
 EEC memorandum of early April.
 According to this analysis,
 there are three fundamental ob-
 stacles to any solution to the
 problem of a larger European
 economic association:   (1) the
 opposition of the French, who
 hope by opposing British desires
 for an FTA to advance De Gaulle's
 claims to a larger role in At-
 lantic councils;   (2) the per-
 sisting view in London--guided
 by its "balance-of-power" tradi-
 tion--that early collapse of
 the European community would
 pave the way for a European as-
 sociation on British terms;   (3)
 the encouragement of London in
 this view by elements within
 the community--particularly in
 the Netherlands and West Germany
 --which are anxious to maintain
 economic and political ties with
 Britain.

 There are other factors in-
 volved in French opposition to
 the PTA, but these obstacles
 suggest the divisive impact of
 the dispute on the EEC.          They
 make it extremely doubtful that,
 short of a broad political agree-
 ment, efforts to write a "Euro-
 pean policy" for the community
 are likely to succeed soon.
 Trade Conflict
 With hope receding for a
 broader European association
 like the FTA, several disruptive
 trends are emerging.   The most
 formidable of these is the in-
 creased support for an agree-
 ment which would meet the es-
 sential needs of the
 non-EEC countries
 without regard  for
 mutual obligations
 to the GATT.   Such a
 preferential agree-
 ment might involve
 tariff and quota con-
 cessions on an intra-
 OEEC basis without
 guarantees that the
 resulting association
 would fulfill GATT
 requirements either
 for customs unions
 or free trade areas.
 Benelux off1*
 ciais, who are among
 the advocates of this
 approach, note that
 the United States and
 Canada since World
 War II have accepted
 OEEC discrimination
 against dollar imports
 to promote European
 recovery and consider
 as a delusion any
 hope that further
 discrimination can be
 prevented within the
 GATT.
 A series of agree-
 ments now being ne-
 gotiated by the French
 is also encouraging
 a trend toward bilat-
 eralism.   Intended as
 SUMMARY
 an interim answer to the charges
 of preferential treatment leveled
 at the EEC, such an agreement
 has been concluded between Paris
 and London, and the French now
 are talking with the Scandinavians
 and Austrians.   In principle,
 these agreements are contrary
 to the community approach fore-
 seen by the EEC treaty, they
 undermine the position of the
 EEC's institutions, and they are
 in opposition to the multilateral
 principle implicit in the FTA
 plan.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 April 1959
 Switzerland, and Portugal--are
 surveying the possibility of a
 customs union to compete with
 the EEC.   Ostensibly intended
 to improve the bargaining posi-
 tion of its members in future
 talks on the FTA, such "alter-
 natives" also have as their
 objective a weakening of the
 EEC--by threatening West Germany,
 in particular, with isolation
 from its other European markets.
 This promises to deepen the
 present cleavage and offers
 little comfort to those under-
 developed countries--such as
 Greece and Turkey--which would
 probably be left out of both
 groups.
 An African Policy
 The chaotic state of the
 EEC's relations with the rest
 of Europe should not, however,
 obscure a number of more hope-
 ful developments on other fronts
 --particularly the prospect of
 closer ties with Africa.   In
 those African areas associated
 with the community by the EEC
 treaty, progress is being made
 toward launching the projects
 for which a half-billion-dollar
 development fund has been set
 aside.   The EEC mission  to
 Africa earlier this year and
 the more recent tour of the
 community countries by African
 leaders were intended to es-
 tablish the Africans' confidence
 in the EEC as an entity separate
 from its colonialist members.
 The present tense relations
 between Tunisian President
 Bourguiba and Paris and  his
 refusal to accept France as in-
 termediary for the community
 have made  contacts between
 Tunis and the.EEC exceedingly
 delicate.  Formal EEC-Tunisian
 talks, once they are launched,
 will be crucial.   The EEC Com-
 mission feels that Tunisian
 association might pave the way
 for ties with other states which
 become free, and some progress
 has already been made among the
 newly independent African states
 toward establishing ties with
 Tunisia.
 EURC13EAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (EEC)
 The organization of six Continental countries,                                                   also
 known cs the European Common ;Market, which came into
 being cn 1 January 1958.  It has as its major objec-
 tive the establishment of a complete economic                                                                                                             union
 during a 12- to 15-year transitional period. At the
 and of thts.pertod, all restrictions on the circula-
 tion oj' goods, workers, and capital would be removed,
 a common external tariff would be enforced   by  the
 member countries,  and social and economic  policies
 would be concerted.
 ORGANIZATION FOR EUROPEAN
 ECGNOMIC COOPERATION (O EEC)
 The organization of 17  Western  European  countries
 formed in 1947 to facilitate cooperation in fulfill-
 ing the objectives of the Marshall Plan.                                                                                                             Initially
 concerred with preparation of economic recovery pro-
 grams, it has since sought to promote cooperation to
 increase production and trade,   modernize industry,
 stabilize finances, and reduce trade barriers-
 -pri-marily by removing quota restrictions.
 FREE TRADE AREA (FTA)
 The projected organization initially proposed by the
 United Kingdom in 1956 as a means of linking the six
 ETC countries with the other OEEC  countries  in   a
 broader free trading area. Its major objective would
 be the removal of restrictions on commerce among its
 membero, but in contrast with the EEC,  member coun-
 tries  would  retain  jurisdiction over the level of
 their tariffs on imports from non-FTA countries.
 GENERAL AGREEMENT GN TARIFFS
 AND TRADE (GATT)
 The multilateral trade agreement negotiated in  1947
 in  Geneva and now including 37 contracting parties.
 The GA T is primarily a code of international conduct
 on commercial policy, attempting to enforce the gen-
 eral rule of unconditional mostfavored-nation treat-
 ment on customs matters, to  prevent                                                                                                            discriminatory
 and preferential application of tariffs  and quotas,
 and to discourage introduction of  other  trade  re-
 strictions.
 The Hallstein report recom-
 mends a coordinated approach to
 the problem of all underdeveloped
 areas;, and Belgian Foreign Min-
 ister Wigny is the author of a
 plan for a cooperative program
 of world-wide technical and f i-
 nancial assistance supported by
 the community, Britain, and the
 United States.

 The difficulties
 over the FTA have also tended
 to cloud the extent to which
 the EEC--outside the area of
 its European relations--has
 apparently accepted the GATT
 regulations as setting the
 standard in international trade.
 In keeping with a compromise
 agreement of last year, GATT
 machinery is being utilized by
 those countries which complain
 that their trade is being harmed
 by the Common Market, and con-
 sultations on a number of
 primary products--mostly of
 tropical origin--have been com-
 pleted.   The results have been
 disappointing, however.   The
 complaining producing countries
 showed little disposition to
 push their cases, and the EEC
 was unresponsive to claims of
 damage.   Nonetheless, an im-
 portant precedent has been
 established.
 More hopeful is the ap
 parent disposition of the EEC
 to accept the Hallstein recom-
 mendation that the EEC  part'ic--
 ipate         in a round of GATT ne-
 gotiations beginning in 1960.

 GATT talks have been strongly
 supported by the United States
 as a means of utilizing the
 tariff reductions authorized
 by the US Reciprocal Trade Agree-
 ments Renewal Act of 1958, and
 as the best hope of negotiating
 a reduction in the EEC's common
 tariff which begins to take
 effect in 1962.
 Whether this hope is justi-
 fied will depend on whether pro-
 tectionist-minded countries-
 particularly France--are then
 prepared to lower tariffs, and
 whether they are willing to
 utilize the EEC Commission as
 an instrument of negotiation.

 Despite the extent to which
 the EEC has been accepted, dif-

 federalists have accepted this

 achievement  by  accession

 The federalists are opposed
 by those who are more concerned
 with the retention of political,
 military, and commercial ties
 outside the community and would
 be willing to sacrifice it if
 necessary for the sake of a
 broader and looser arrangement.
 The community?s major task is to
 mediate between these extremes,
 to preserve itself intact, and to
 avoid the emergence of solutions
 which would create chaosin inter-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 April 1959
 COMMUNIST CHINA'S FOREIGN AID PROGRAM
 Communist China's foreign
 aid program continued its expan-
 sion in late 1958 and early 1959
 with new aid totaling $275,000,-
 000,   Peiping  has allocated
 from $160 million  to  $190
 million to carry the drive for-
 ward this year.               Since 1953J.
 China has extended nearly $800,-
 000,000 in foreign economic aid,
 one third of which was made
 available since the end of 1957.
 Grants constituted the main form
 of China's foreign assistance
 until 1958, when repayable loans,
 which tend to strengthen econom-
 ic ties between the parties in-
 volved,became the usual practice.
 The major portion of Chi-
 nese aid--$630,000,000--has been
 made to bloc countries, includ-
 ing during the last year long-
 term loans of $75,000,000 to
 North Vietnam, an estimated
 $50,000,000 to North  Korea,
 $25,000.,000 to Mongolia, and
 $13,500,000 to Albania.   With
 the exception of Albania, where
 these credits will be used
 chiefly to finance limited Sino-
 Albanian trade for several years,
 these agreements specify large
 deliveries of Chinese equipment
 and supplies, plus technical
 assistance, for the industrial
 and agricultural development of
 the liar Eastern satellites, In
 Mongolia, 10,000 Chinese labor-
 ers have been employed since
 1955 on projects receiving
 this aide
 While Peiping's economic
 offensive in the free world has
 been focused principally on in-
 creased trade, marked by an in-
 tensive export drive in Asia, it
 also includes a foreign aid pro-
 gram of increasing importance.

 when a $40,000,000 loan was ac-

 Thus far, at least $11,500,000
 has been spent, and negotiations
 are in progress for'the utili-

 also recently become involved
 in the bloc's arms transactions
 with Djakarta, but the value of
 the credits for this purpose
 is not known.
 Ceylon is now receiving
 aid under a 1957 grant of $15,-
 750,000 to be delivered in the
 form of commodities, the sale
 of which provides funds for
 local aid projects.   This aid

 aid activity in the Middle East.
 Approximately one third of Pei-
 ping's              $16,300,000 interest-
 free loan was allocated in
 1958, and increased Chinese
 activity has been apparent in
 recent months.   At least 300
 Chinese specialists and labor-
 ers arrived to carry out road
 construction and factory proj-
 ects. Egypt is the only other
 Middle East country to Dave re-
 ceived Chinese aid. In  Secem-
 ber of last year Cairo accepted
 a $5,600,000 gift to assist in
 meeting its Suez Canal debts,
 a grant similar tothat pro-
 vided by China during the 1956
 Suez crisis to meet Egypt's
 foreign exchange needs.
 Early this year, Peiping
 extended its influence into
 North Africa by granting $5,-
 000, 000  to  t:he."Algerian

 of iwhtch is.  .td; be . used. for
 the purchase of arms and military
 supplies.  Presumably this grant
 is being implemented by an Al-
 gerian military mission now
 visiting China.
 Although China's economic
 aid program is small in compari-
 son to total bloc assistance to
 underdeveloped areas, it is an
 important factor in Peiping's
 drive for recognition as a world
 power.  Through long-term re-
 payment provisions and the in-
 troduction of Chinese consumer
 goods in new markets, Peiping
 is able to enjoy the prestige
 associated with economic assist-
 ance and at the same time en-
 courage the growth of future
 economic relations.
