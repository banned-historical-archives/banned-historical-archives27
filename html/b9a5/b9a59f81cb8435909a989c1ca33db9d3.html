 Soviet physicist Andrey Sakharov (r) toasts his winning of the Nobel Peace Prize
 USSR
 The already sizable headache presented the
 Soviet regime by dissident spokesman physicist
 Andrey Sakharov seems destined to grow worse,
 now that he has been awarded the Nobel Peace
 Prize. This spring, Sakharov lent his name to the
 organizers of a blue-ribbon international tribunal
 on the status of human rights in the Soviet Union.
 The conclave, which has been almost a year in the
 planning, is slated to be held in Copenhagen Oc-
 tober 17-19.
 Soviet officials have so far declined to com-
 ment on SAkharov's Nobel award. Moscow's
 foreign-language broadcasts, however, have at-
 tacked the Nobel Committee's "political
 gesture," saying it was designed to "kindle the an-
 ti-Soviet campaign and impede the easing of in-
 ternational tension." In calling Szkharov a man
 who has "put himself in a position of an anti-
 patriot and an opponent of peaceful coex-
 istence," Moscow's broadsides suggest that a ma-
 jor campaign to discredit Sakharov is in the mak-
 ing. The first domestic assault on Sakharov as a
 "hater of peace" appeared in the Soviet press on
 Ocober 15.
 Sakharov, meanwhile, has told Western
 reporters that he views the prize as beneficial to
 the cause of human rights in the USSR, and he has
 renewed his call for a general amnesty for
 political prisoners. In telephone interviews with
 Western media, Sakharov said that the CSCE
 agreements and his Nobel award should give im-
 petus to an "international crusade" for human
 rights in the USSR.
 Sakharov has also said that he hopes the
 Kremlin will not see his Nobel award as a
 "challenge" and that he believes it would
 "violate the spirit of detente" if he  were
 not permitted to go to Oslo in December to
 collect the prize. The Norwegian embassy in

 Moscow reportedly has assumd Sakharov of its
 government's support.
 Whether to let Sakharov go to Oslo-and
 to  return-will, nevertheless, be a  difficult
 decision for the Soviet leaders, even more so
 now  that  prominent  Soviet  non-dissident
 scientist  Dr.  Leonid  Kantorovich  has been
 named co-recipient of the 1975 Nobel prize
 for economics.     The  Kremlin may  find  it
 embarrassing to charge the Nobel Committee
 with playing politics in Sakharov's case, while
 recognizing in  Kantorovich-a   Lenin-prize
 winner-the contributions of a major establish-
 ment scientist.
 Soviet leaders also remember clearly the
 case of exiled writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,
 who won the Nobel Literature Prize in 1970,
 but declined to go to Stockholm unless assured
 he could return to the USSR. The affair ended
 with  his  expulsion  in  February  1974.  In
 the  intervening  four  years,  Solzhenitsyn's
 name remained in the headlines and tarred
 the Soviet reputation abroad.
 Moscow has not yet commented directly on
 the Copenhagen tribunal. Tass, however, has
 replayed for foreign consumption some of the
 more derisive comments by Western leftist media,
 including questioning of the dissident physicist's
 "humanist" credentials and dark hints about the
 sources of the meeting's financial backing.
 If the tribunal follows early plans, it will range
 across human rights violations in the USSR, from
 religious oppression to curbs on freedom of
 movement. Its focus will be on testimony from
 survivors of Soviet prisons, labor camps, and psy-
 chiatric hospitals.
 The sponsors, a group of Soviet and East
 European exiles resident in Denmark, have
 solicited testimony, oral and written, from "any
 person able to give it." Several prominent Soviet
 exiles are expected to testify. Solzhenitsyn has
 been invited but has reportedly declined to at-
 tend.
 Sakharov's prominence at home and abroad,
 along with his record of public appeals on behalf
 of the very causes the tribunal intends to ex-
 amine, made his name an obvious and early
 choice for the sponsors of the Copenhagen
 meeting. There is no evidence that they knew
 beforehand that Sakharov would win the Nobel
 Peace Prize. The award will be sure to attract add-
 ed attention to the tribunal's proceedings.
 The two events, the Peace Prize and the
 tribunal, will intensify speculation about
 Sakharov's future.
 Sakharov gradually took up dissident ac-
 tivities in the 1960s and was slowly cut off from his
 work on the Soviet nuclear program. He was fired
 and his security clearance lifted shortly after
 publication in the West during 1968 of his essay,
 "Progress, Coexistence, and Intellectual
 Freedom." Since May 1969, he has held a low-
 ranking job as a parttime researcher at the
 Lebedev Institute of Physics in Moscow.
 Sakharov, however, remains a member of the
 Soviet Academy of Sciences. He even attended
 the opening of the academy's 250th anniversary
 celebrations in Moscow on October 7 and listen-
 ed to General Secretary Brezhnev's keynote ad-
 dress. Sakharov's contacts there with numerous
 visiting Western scientists increases the size of the
 problem he poses for the regime.
 The strongly democratic, soberly reformist
 Sakharov has never subscribed to the
 authoritarian, nationalistic outlook expressed by
 Solzhenitsyn. Sakharov has thus been able to
 reach a wider Western audience as a spokesman
 for human rights in the USSR. The contrast
 between Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov is a further
 measure of the Kremlin's problem in dealing with
 the dissident physicist.

 SIBERIAN DEVELOPMENT CHUGS ALONG
 The Soviet Union opened two bridges along
 the route of the Baykal-Amur railroad in
 September, crossing another hurdle in Siberian
 railroad construction. These two are among the
 largest of 142 major bridges envisioned for the
 railroad, and their completion will have a signifi-
 cant psychological and technological impact. The
 construction techniques were new to the USSR,
 and the experience gained should aid construc-
 tion of the other bridges.
 fhe 1,100-meter Amur River bridge at the
 eastern end of the railroad provides a major year-
 round connection between the railroad and the
 Pacific Ocean. This link should alleviate
 bottlenecks in existing rail capacity. Until now,
 the Soviets have relied on a rail ferry during
 srummer and tracks across the ice during winter.
 At the western end, the Lena River bridge will
 simplify moving heavy equipment needed at two
 of the largest planned tunnel sites-one near
 Nizhneangarsk and the other, which will be the
 longest tunnel in the USSR, at Severo-Muyskiy.
 Railroad construction-particularly the
 Baykal-Amur railroad-has top priority in the
 Kremlin's plans for developing Siberia. Construc-
 tion on the Baykal-Amur was to increase fivefold
 this year and is planned to double again in 1976.
 Although work on the railroad generally has
 progressed on schedule, it is still too early to
 evaluate whether the 1982 completion deadline
 can be met because construction over the most
 rugged terrain has yet to start in earnest.

 The railroad is viewed as critical to any inten-
 sive Siberian development  program because
 more than 75 percent of the machinery in Siberia
 is transported from other regions. Complaints
 about recurrent equipment breakdowns, repair
 difficulties, and shortages of equipment have
 resulted in imports of more reliable equipment
 from the US.
 The Soviets have also completed several
 other rail projects this year. Among them are the
 Bam-Tynda rail line, facilitating the movement of
 construction materials to sites along the
 Baykal-Amur railroad, and a bridge across the Ob
 River on the Tyumen-Surgut line, expanding
 access to West Siberian energy resources. The
 Barn-Tynda line is being extended north to
 Berkakit and the Chulman coal deposits.
 Moscow is planning to upgrade existing lines
 from Pivan to Sovyetskaya Gavan and from
 Tayshet to the Lena River to permit more inten-
 sive use of the Baykal-Amur railroad. Only track
 laying is needed to complete the extension of the
 Tyumen-Surgut line to Nizhnevartovsk and the
 Samotlor oil fields.
 Other transportation projects under con-
 sideration for Siberia include the extension of a
 rail line from Nizhnevartovsi, eastward to the
 Baykal-Amur to form a grand "North Siberian
 Railroad" and the construction of several north-
 south road and rail "tentacles" to intersect with
 the Baykal-Amur and provide direct access to
 mineral deposits and other resources.
 The Soviets reportedly are considering a road
 paralleling the Baykal-Amur to handle short-haul
 traffic. It is unlikely, however, that sufficient
 resources for these projects will be available until
 the  Baykal-Amur  line  nears  com-
 L) letion.
 USSR-SYRIA: AN IMPORTANT SYMBOL
 Whatever the practical results of Syrian
 President Asad's brief visit to the USSR last
 weekend turn out to be, there is no doubt
 Moscow considered the visit an important sym-
 bol of its continuing role in the Middle East.
 Party boss Brezhnev and other top Soviet
 leaders greeted Asad at the airport and saw him
 off when he left.
 One obvious purpose of the visit, aside
 from  demonstrating the solidarity of
 Syrian-Soviet opposition to Sinai II, was almost
 certainly to discuss strategy for the next round
 of Middle East diplomacy. The Soviets
 doubtless sought to explore Syria's attitude
 toward new talks, especially since Damascus,
 unlike Moscow, is cool to the idea of
 reconvening the Geneva conference.
 The composition of Asad's delegation,
 which included Defense Minister Talas as 'veil
 as Foreign Minister Khaddam, indicates that
 military issues were also high on the agenda.
 Talas and Khaddam remained in Moscow until
 October 15, probably to try to negotiate more
 Soviet military aid for Syria as a counterbalance
 to new US arms commitments for Israel.
 The two sides probably also discussed the
 situation in Lebanon. Moscow has applauded
 Syrian efforts to mediate the conflict there.
 The brevity of the communique issued
 after Asad's departure suggests that the two
 sides did not see eye to eye on .ill matters. At
 the least, however, their silence on substantive
 issues keeps the options of each open as they
 consider the next steps in the Middle East
 negotiating process.

 British Foreign S .cretary Callaghan (I) at recent EC foreign ministers meeting
 THE UK, THE EC, AND ENERGY
 Delegates from several industria! and
 developing countries agreed this week in Paris to
 hold a conference of 27 states on "international
 economic cooperation." The session, which con-
 venes in Paris on Decembe-, 16, will bring
 together rich and poor nations to consider
 energy, raw materials, economic development,
 and related financial issues.
 Foreign Secretary Callaghan's firm stand at the EC
 Council last week caused surprise and dism?y
 among London's EC partners. Predictably, most of
 them assailed the British for threatening EC
 "solidarity" by neglecting to make any reference
 to the need for a common stand, even though all
 recognize that agree:nent on an EC energy policy25X1
 is an extremely difficult matter.                25X1
 London's decision not to allow the EC to
 represent it at i:he meeting has had little effect as
 yet on the preparations, but the UK's action will
 enormously complicate the process of selecting
 which countries will represent the industrialized
 nations and how they will coordinate policies.
 The move reflects Britain's difficulty in balancing
 national and community interests and is another
 example of the trouble the EC has had recently
 reaching common stands on international
 economic issues. If the EC members make Lon-
 don's move a matter of principle, a bitter, divisive
 wrangle could develop.
 The UK had been on record for some time
 that it might seek its own seat. Nevertheless,
 Most EC members are taking London's move
 as a serious threat to the community.
 Callag'ian contends that Britain-as the only
 potential  1 exporter among the Nine-could not
 have K. interests adequately represented by the
 community. This )ighlights the disparate con-
 cerns among the partners that obstruct their
 search for a cc-mmon energy policy. Satisfaction

 of even the UK's principal demand-a long-range
 energy price guarantee for its North Sea
 oil-would, in itself, do little to narrow the gap.
 The Wilson government has been under
 domestic pressure on the issue of sovereignty
 over North Sea production since well before last
 summer's referendum that confirmed the UK's
 continued participation in the EC. The Labor
 government, faced with a deteriorating economic
 situation, cannot afford to give the impression
 that it has surrendered control over the resource
 many have touted as Britain's best hope for the
 future.
 USSR
 London's reluctance to delegate representa-
 tion may be aimed in part at getting the com-
 munity to develop a common energy policy. The
 UK's impatience with its partners can also be seen
 in other areas, however. On relations with the
 developing countries, the EC has yet to formulate
 a coherent stand. As recently as Monday, the
 Nine failed to agree on an aid program for those
 developing states that are not already associated
 with the community-many of them Asian coun-
 tries with ties to Britain.
 The EC took a back seat to the US at last
 month.'s special session of the UN, where a com-
 promise was struck between the developed and
 developing states. London had advanced its own
 program for development cooperation to its com-
 monwealth associates last spring, and the Wilson
 government may feel that the lack of inter-
 national response is, at least in part, because of
 London's difficulty in securing the support of its
 community partners. London can thus also make
 the argument that its development policy cannot
 be adequately represented by the community and
 could further insist that its importance as an inter-
 national financial center dictatf s the need for
 separate representation or finacicial issues.
 near-earth orbit, an improved Meteor satellite        The EC and the other industrialized states
 Cosmos 775, launched last week into a
 stationary orbit over the Indian Ocean, may be
 part of the "three-tier" meteorological satellite
 system the Soviets have been talking about for
 many years. Soviet literature describes the
 three-tier system as a manned satellite in
 in a medi';m-altitude orbit, and a stationary    will, of course, have to settle the representation

 TURKEY: STRONGER HAND TO DEMIREL
 Last Sunday's  partial Senate elections in
 Turkey strengthened Prime Minister Demirel's
 position within the governing coalition and in
 relation to his political opponents.
 According to the unofficial tabulation,
 Demirel's conservative Justice Party won 27 of the
 54 Senate seats and 5 of the 6 National Assembly
 seats that were contested. Although Demirel's
 main  opponent-Bulent Ecevit's Republican
 People's Party-won a higher percentage of the
 vote (43.3 compared to 40.8 for the Justice Party)
 the Republicans took only 25 Senate seats and 1
 assembly seat.
 Ecevit has claimed victory, pointing to his
 party's higher percentage of the vote and its net
 gain of 17 Senate seats. These figures may,
 however, somewhat exaggerate  the party's
 nationwide strength. A larger percentage of the
 seats at stake were in Republican strongholds
 than would be the case in a general election.
 Turkey's minor conservative parties did poor-
 ly. US embassy officials think this may mean
 that-for the present at least-Turkey is moving
 back toward a two-party system after two years
 during which no party had a majority and only
 weak coalition or caretaker governments were
 possible.
 Among the small parties that lost ground was
 Necmettin Erbakan's National Salvation Party, a
 partner in the government coalition. Erbakan's re-
 cent uncompromising stands on several issues
 had largely immobilized the government. Its poor

 1977 and could even be held earlier. He will try,
 therefore, to avoid taking positions that could
 harm  his  party's  electoral chances. F

 PORTUGAL: TESTING AZEVEDO
 Portugal's anti-Communist leaders have
 backed down in the face of a serious incident of
 military indiscipline instigated by the far left and
 the Communists. If further such challenges are
 not countered, an early end to the Azevedo
 government is probable.
 The week-long occupation of an artillery unit
 in Porto by leftist soldiers and their civilian sup-
 porters-the most serious challenge faced by the
 month-old Azevedo government-was resolved
 earlier this week by a compromise worked out by
 Army Chief of Staff Fabiao. The agreement meets
 many of the demands of the rebellious troops and
 skirts the issue of their open defiance of the
 government. No punishment is called for, despite
 a government  announcement  during the
 rebellion that those responsible for the civil un-
 rest would be prosecuted. Scores of people were
 injured when center-left Popular Democratic Par-
 ty supporters were fired on by the militants.
 The government's failure to take a strong
 stand on this issue is probably due to the lack of a
 reliable securit; force. The military intervention
 force, announced several weeks ago, still exists
 only on paper. Lack of support from President
 Costa Gorses may also have been a factor.
 Calls for the return of pro-Communist former
 prime minister Vasco Goncalves to power have
 occurred at leftist gatherings, and the Com-
 rnunist-influenced Lisbon press is increasingly
 referring to such a possibility. The Porto incidents
 and other anti-government activities on the part
 of the military are linked with Goncalves and
 other pro-Communist officers who formerly held
 key positions and have been allowed to remain
 on duty.
 A challenge is also developing in the labor
 sector. Metallurgical and agricultural worker un-
 ions have threatened to paralyze southern Por-
 tugal by strikes within a few days if $160 million in
 agricultural credits promised by the Goncalves
 regime are not forthcoming. The Communists
 have solidified their control over the
 metalworkers-the most important blue-collar
 federation in Portugal-in recent elections and
 also succeeded in obtaining wage increases
 despite government appeals to the workers to
 curb their demands.
 Both the Communists and the extreme left
 had refrained from criticizing Azevedo personally
 but-following his speech on October 13 on
 economic problems-he was attacked by
 newspapers of both factions. The far-left
 Republica sharply criticized him for saying that
 the workers are partially to blame for the
 economic crisis, while the pro-Communist Diario
 de Noticias questioned whether Azevedo is on
 the side of the majority political parties or of the
 workers and farmers.
 The government's conciliatory stand on the
 Porto incidents raises difficult questions about its
 resolve to enforce its own decisions and is likely
 to encourage similar incidents elsewhere. A flurry
 of anti-government demonstrations and strikes
 fomented by the far left and the Communists is
 expected to further test Azevedo's mettle in the
 weeks to come.                          25X1

 MPI_A head Agostinho Neto (r)
 ANGOLA: LITTLE CHANGE
 After a week of renewed fighting, Angola's
 three warring liberation groups have made little
 headway toward improving their respective
 military positions. The Popular Movement for the
 Liberation of Angola, the dominant political and
 military organization in the territory, still projects
 itself as the only group capable of governing after
 independence on November 11.
 Military offensives by all three groups an-
 parently are being hampered by logistic
 problems. The Soviet-backed Popular Movement
 has not been able to drive the National Union for
 the Total Independence of Angola from its
 headquarters in Nova Lisboa, Angola's second
 largest city. Nor cu  the National Union push the
 Popular Movement out of Lobito, the territory's
 major port. Both groups are having difficulty
 providing a continuous flow of fresh troops and
 supplies to their forces.
 In northern Angola, the National Front con-
 tinues to move very slowly toward Luanda from its
 base of operations at Caxito, some 40 miles to the
 northeast. The Front naively hopes that by laying
 siege to the capital it can buttress its claims to
 political legitimacy and pressure the Popular
 Movement into accepting the Front as a partner
 in an independent government.
 Lisbon maintains that all three liberation
 groups have a legitimate and equal claim to
 political participation after independence, and to
 transfer sovereignty to a single liberation group
 would be contrary to Portugal's philosophy of
 decolonization. Nevertheless, the Popular Move-
 ment seems to believe that Portugal will have no
 choice on November 11 but to turn over power
 exclusively to the Movement. Movement Presi-
 dent Agostinho Neto stated this week that he
 hopes a reconciliation committee recently sent to
 Angola by the Organization of African Unity will
 recognize his group as the sole legitimate
 representative of the Angolan people. In Neto's
 view, this would place heavy pressure on the Por-
 tuguese to follow suit.
 Neto has also said that, in the event the Por-
 tuguese refuse to transfer sovereignty officially to
 the Popular Movement, his organization is
 prepared to proclaim the independence of
 Angola under its own banner. The Portuguese
 could do nothing to counter such a move. Por-

 tugal still plans to have all of its troops out of the
 territory by November 11.
 The Popular Movement prefers to gain
 power with the legitimacy a Portuguese transfer
 of sovereignty would confer. To that end, it is
 continuing to project itself as the unoffic;al
 successor to Portugal, most recently by sending a
 delegation to the UN General Assembly. The
 delegation will receive no formal recognition
 from the UN, but will probably engage in heavy

 INDIA: ECONOMIC PROSPECTS GOOD
 Shortly after extending her authority in June,
 Prime Minister Gandh! announced a 20-point
 econon,;c program to reduce the prices of essen-
 tial commodities, expand agricultural and in-
 dustrial production, and improve the position of
 the rural poor. Most of the 20 points were
 restatements of earlier promises, but the Prime
 Minister's new authority gave her more power to
 implement changes.
 Now,  several months  later, short-term
 economic prospects are good:
 ?  The best monsoon i iins in five years
 are likely to produce a record grain harvest
 this fall.
 ?  Increased supplies of hydroelectric
 power and agricultural raw materials will
 stimulate industrial recovery.
 ?  Strict monetary controls have reduc-
 ed inflation  dramatically, and the large
 harvest will help keep inflationary pressure,
 in check.
 Good weather, rather than government in-
 itiative, is responsible for the favorable outlook;
 Gandhi, nonetheless, will take credit for any
 economic upturn.
 Food grain imports this year will probably be
 some 1 to 2 million tons less than the 6 million im-
 ported last year. About 2,5 million tons were on
 hand at the beginning of the year, compared with
 a peak of 10 million tons in 1972; New Delhi in-
 tends to import substantial amounts of food
 grains to build up buffer stocks.
 To date, India has arranged to import about
 3.5 million tons of wheat for 1975, with 2.5 million
 tons coining from the US. Continuing foreig.. ex-
 change shortages will limit additional purchases,
 and New Delhi will probably seek concessional
 grain.
 India's trade deficit, $1.4 billion in the year.
 ending March 1975, will increase moderately, at-
 tributable to higher prices for petroleum, fer-
 tilizer, and food grain. These have caused trade
 deficits for the past two years in contrast to a sur-
 plus in 1972. India now pays $1.5 billion for im-
 ported petroleum. The recent 10-percent price
 hike for oil and increased consumption will cost
 India $200-$300 million more next year. Offshore
 oil exploration and exploitation is not far enough
 along to reduce Indian dependence on foreign
 oil before 1980.
 The trade deficits have resulted in a massive
 increase in foreign borrowing. Despite rising
 debt-service payments, net capital receipts in-
 creased sharply in 1973 and 1974. During these
 years, India obtained nearly $700 million from the
 International Monetary Fund, in addition to $1.7
 billion in net aid from other sources. Much of the
 IMF borrowing will be due by 1978, when total
 debt service obligations will rise about 20 percent
 to $900 million. India's ability to meet payments
 will continue to hinge largely on new loans,
 repeated rescheduling of payments, and  IMF
 borrowings.
 Promising short-term prospects notwithstand-
 ing, the long-term outlook remains pessimistic.
 Changes more fundamental than those embodied
 in the 20-point program are needed to attack
 deep-rooted economic problems of Population
 pressure, low domestic savings and investment,
 dependence on forei n aid, and huge externa'
 debts.                              25X1

 LEBANON: CEASE-FIRE THREATENED
 The security situation in Beirut improved
 markedly following the cease-fire arranged dur-
 ing Prime Minister Karami's trip to Damascus late
 last week. In midweek, however, the developing
 truce was marred by new clashes between Muslim
 and Christian militiamen in the eastern suburbs of
 Beirut. There has been no significant progress
 toward resolving fundamental political issues that
 underlie the continuing crisis.
 The fighting on the night of October 14-15 in-
 volved a refugee camp under the control of "re-
 jectionist" fedayeen who fired anti-aircraft
 batteries at an adjoining Christian community.
 Some of the rounds fell on a nearby Armenian
 quarter, threatening to bring the Armenians into
 the conflict for the first time.
 This week, the national reconciliation com-
 mittee for the first time took steps to come to
 grips with the underlying causes of the crisis. On
 October 13, subcommittees were formed to con-
 sider political, economic, and social reforms. 13oth

 SPANISH SAHARP: COURT DECISION
 The International Court of Justice and a UN
 fact-finding group released their findings on the
 status of Spanish Sahara this week, moving the
 long-simmering dispi;te over the territory into a
 crucial stage.
 The International Court's advisory opinion
 on October 16 asserted that both Morocco and
 Mauritania had legal ties with the "Western
 Sahara" at the time of Spanish occupation, but
 not ties of territorial sovereignty. The Court
 decided, by wide majorities, that these ties do not
 preclude the application of the principle of
 self-determination to the territory. The Court
 took up the case in response to a request from the
 UN General lssembly last December.
 The report by the UN group-a delegation
 from the Decolonization Committee that visited
 the area last spring-suggested that the UN en-
 courage dialogue among all "interested parties"
 includirg Saharan refugees living in exile. It also
 recommended that the UN designate a commis-
 sion of e. nerts to determine who is a Saharan, but
 stopped short of explicitly backing a referendum.
 In an apparent reference to Morocco, which has
 threatened to use force if necessary to "recover"
 the territory, the report urged all parties to
 recognize Spain's  responsibility during the
 decolonization process and avoid provocative
 acts that could upset the status quo.
 Both the UN report, if adopted in committee,
 and the Court's opinion will be submitted to the
 current session of the UN General Assembly,
 which has to decide whether to formulate a
 proposal for decolonization of Spanish Sahara or
 to leave settlement of the dispute to the countries
 invol'.ed. Earlier assembly resolutions have en-
 dorsed self-determination.
 Morocco's King Hassan is committed to
 annexing at ;east part of Spanish Sahara. In a
 speech following the release of the Court's opi-
 nion, Hassan announced he will organize a
 "peaceful" mass march into the Spanish Sahara.
 He said he would not seek an armed conflict with
 Spain, but would fight in self-defense.
 At the same time, Hassan may interpret the
 Court's opinion as supporting partition of Spanish
 Sahara between Morocco and Mauritania. The
 two counties reached an agreement in principle
 earlier this year that would partition the territory,
 giving Morocco tie northern region with its
 phosphates and granting Mauritania some of the
 southern portion containing iron ore.
 Rabat probably will try to have the UN report
 shelved in committee or submitted to the General
 Assembly as information only. The report implies
 a role for Algeria, which insists it is an "interested
 party," in settling the Saharan dispute. Morocco
 vigorously opposes any such ro'e.
 King Hassan has apparently not abandoned
 his year-end deadline for resolving the dispute or
 his threat to use force. Rabat has taken various
 measures to meet any military contingency that
 may arise with Spain or P,I eria.
 Algeria opposes Morocco's aspirations and
 has publicly supported a referendum, supervised
 and guaranteed by the UN. It also has been sup-
 porting a Saharan group seeking independence
 for the territory. Algiers will probably argue that
 the Court opinion and the UN report's call for
 consultations with Saharans is recognition of their
 right to self -determinatic;,.
 Spain, for its part, would welcome new talks
 with Morocco in order to achieve a peaceful .id
 orderly withdrawal from the Sahara. Madrid may
 view the Court's findings as a basis for an
 amicable solution and drop its earlier wish for a
 referendum. Spain has been unwilling in the past
 to disregard Algeria's interests, however, and this
 may still be a major stumbling block.

 PANAMA: NO FIREWORKS
 The celebration on October 11 of the 1968
 "revolution" that brought General Omar Torrijos
 to power was a peaceful and rather sober affair.
 The government went out of its way to stress the
 positive image of a responsible, popularly sup-
 ported government and to take a moderate line
 toward the treaty talks.
 Chief of Government Torrijos and President
 Lakas delivered sober, moderate speeches. Lakas
 dwelt on the regime's accomplishments while
 Torrijos emphasized that national unity and
 patience would be needed to weather the dif-
 ficult canal negotia ions. Torrijos stressed the
 need for restraint, pointing out the realities of
 negotiating with a "sometimes irrational"
 colossus with a formidable military presence in
 the zone. He said any treaty that could be achiev-
 ed quickly would only be rejected when sub-
 mitted to his promised popular referendum. His
 toile and specific reference tc US political needs
 regarding the 1976 election again made clear that
 he is resigned to continue negotiating at least
 through text year. Also on a conciliatory note,
 Torrijos uromised US canal workers that his
 governmt nt would respect labor gains and that
 extraterritorial protection is unnecessary. Those
 who think otherwise, he war ned, should leave.
 Torrijos commented on two major sticking
 points in the negotiations-US bases and the
 durat;on of the treaty-by stating that Panama was
 not negotiating on US military bases, only the
 period within which they must be dismantled;
 any presence beyond the end of the century
 would be unacceptable. By constantly reiterating
 this position, even in the context of an otherwise
 generally conciliatory speech, Torrijos has made
 retreat on this issue extremely difficult, if not im-
 possible.
 The press had anticipated that some 128,000
 persons would attend the main rally, but only 35,-
 000 were present, even though the government
 provided free transportation  from outlying
 provinces and probably pressed government
 employees to attend. Several secondary events
 were canceled, apparently to build attendance at
 the main rally. The disappointing crowd was the
 combined result of poor weather, the weekend
 rather than weekday anniversary date, and the
 absence of any recent noteworthy government
 achievement or prospective announcement to
 generate enthusiasm.
 The government carefully scheduled main
 events away from the Canal Zone and did not
 emphasize the concurrent 50th anniversary of the
 1925 renters' strike, when US troops were called
 by the Panamanian government to put down riots
 in the capital. Students apparently got the word
 that the National Guard wanted no incidents to
 detract from the negotiations; no anti-US
 demonstrations  of  any  kind  were

 CHILE: CHANGING ADVISERS
 President Pinochet's dismissal off four ul-
 traconservative civilian advisers seems likely to
 soften some of the hard-line policies that have
 been so damaging to the government's image-
 building attempts.
 The outspoken air force member of the junta,
 General Leigh, frequently has been contemp-
 tuous of decisions made at the behest of
 Pinochet's civilian team. On several occasions
 these objections, shared by other junta members,
 caused the President to change his mind and steer
 away from the more extreme positions advocated
 by the ultraconservatives.
 The Human Rig is Com,.iission
 released an ex?remely harsh report in the UN this
 week that is certain to stir renewed attacks on the
 military regime.
 The advisers' ouster evidently was calculated
 to check fighting within the regime and to res-
 pond to army complaints about the dictatorial,
 right-win; influences created by their presence.
 Another important motivation undoubtedly was
 to foster some measure of international respec-
 tabil;ty by el1minating the most vocal exponents
 of the government's right-wing philosophy.
 Less conservative elements within the military
 and some members of the junta have resented
 this sma". -;gl,tist clique and have blamed its
 members for the poor advice given to Pinochet
 on domestic and foreign affairs. Even conservative
 politicians who strongly support the government
 have voiced reservations about the "unhealthy"
 influence of these advisers, whom one prominent
 National Party leader described as "semi-fascist."

 they were exiles operating from Argentina have
 not been substantiated, and the government's
 credibility has grown so thin that the whole inci-
 dent is now a source of acute embarrassment.
 In another shift involving a civilian adviser,
 Pinochet demanded and received the resignation
 of respected economist Fernando Leniz, vice
 president of the Chilean Copper Corporation and
 a for, -,er econGmy minister. He was dismissed ap-
 parently because Pinochet and some senior army
 officers opposed his policies. His replacement by
 a general believed to be close to Pinochet will
 give the military closer control over the planned
 reorganization  of  the copper  ccrporation.
 Meanwhile, there are strong indications that
 another high-level  member of the civilian
 economic team may be leaving the government
 BRAZIL: SHIFTING OIL POLICY
 Last week's announcement that foreign oil
 firms will be invited to prospect in Brazil--a
 dramatic departure from past practice-points up
 the urgency that President Geisel and his advisers
 attach to the search for energy in general and
 petroleum in particular. Geisel's announcement
 was the culmination of a well-planned effort to
 prepare the public for such a move and blunt the
 arguments of ardent nationalists opposed to it.
 Brazil relies on imports for approximately 80
 percent of its oil and has suffered under the rapid
 price hikes imposed by OPEC. Costly imports
 have aggravated serious balance-of-payments and
 inflationary problems, sharply reducing the high
 growth rates the military regime has come to
 count on as its justification for holding power.
 The pressing need for more energy supplies
 has led Brazil to push ahead in other
 areas-notably nuclear power-while continuing
 the search for more oil. While new deposits are
 being discovered and developed, production
 from these areas thus far has done little more than
 offset declining output from older fields.
 Even before gaining the presidency, Geisel as
 head of the state oil monopoly was believed to
 favor some form of participation for foreign firms
 possessing greater cap;tal and technology. Eariy
 this year, his administration floated a proposal for
 overseas companies to enter Brazil on a risk con-
 tract basis. The general reaction, however, was
 not favorable, and the idea was shelved tem-
 porarily because of opposition from nationalists.
 In recent weeks, the government has sought
 to focus attention on the need to take more
 definitive action. The heavily censored press, for
 example, gave considerable play to September's
 domestic price increase in order to curb demand
 and to the most recent OPEC price hike.
 Moreover, newspapers highlighted reports that
 some developing nations had invited foreign
 firms to explore for oil. Possible rationing and the
 prospect of stretching motor fuel by increasing
 the alcohol content were also featured.
 Last week, Geisel presented the cabinet with
 the proposal to invite foreign exploration through
 risk contracts as part of an overall economic and
 energy program designed to cope with  the
 nation's serious balance-of-payments problem.
 Geisel appears to have 25X1
 the all-important backing of the military high
 command, * as  well  as  others  in govern-

 ECUADOR: COUNTING DOWN
 Despite the continuing deterioration of sup-
 port from military officers and civilians, General
 Guillermo Rodriguez Lara remains President of
 Ecuador. The painful prolongation of his tenure
 owes largely to the absence of a widely accep-
 table alternative; that his days are numbered is
 now virtually beyond dispute. He could readily be
 forced to step down by the three service chiefs,
 who might then rule as a junta or appoint a
 civilian to the presidency. The change could oc-
 cur at any time, but probably no later than
 February 15, the fourth anniversary of the coup
 that brought Rodriguez to power. The President
 would be likely to step down then if his support
 continued to dissolve.
 Rodriguez, undoubtedly now aware that his
 position is precarious, was reportedly amazed at
 the extensive dissatisfaction revealed by his in-
 vestigation of the coup attempt on September 1.
 Fearful that a second and more successful coup is
 imminent, he seems to be looking for a face-
 saving way out and apparently envisions a transi-
 tion to civilian government that would be more
 gradual than most of his critics would be like!y to
 tolerate. He may be obliged to settle for an in-
 terim government that is neither military nor
 uite civilian.
 In their almost four years in government, the
 armed forces have brought about significant
 changes in the style of Ecuadorean administra-
 tion. Perhaps their major accomplishment was to
 reduce the incidence of corruption among
 gcvern,nent officials. This is all the more
 remarkable in these years of growing national
 wealth from petroleum. The military has also
 reduced nepotism and launched a new tradition
 of bringing technical expertise to bear on the
 problems of administration. Concerned officers
 now want to be reasonably certain that these in-
 novations will not be swept away after the military
 bows out. This will make very difficult any agree-
 ment on even an interim solution, much less a
 permanent  successor  government
 ARGENTINA: THE STATE OF THE PRESIDENCY
 Maria Estela Peron's resumption of the
 presidency, in the face of opposition from several
 powerful sectors, is likely to intensify the coun-
 try's political and economic crisis.
 Many middle-of-the-road political and union
 leaders had joined the military high command in
 pressing the President to extend her leave of
 absence. They believed that the governing team
 of  Acting  President  Luder,  Interior  Minister
 Robledo, and Economy Minister Cafiero was
 maKing creditable progress in the key areas of the
 economy and counterterrorism.
 Other Perui.ists, particularly those conser-
 vative labor bosses who have staked their political
 future on her retention of the presidency, urged
 her return. Their support reinforced Peron's own
 stubborn determination to continue her dead
 husband's work despite the physical and
 emotional toll of the job.
 The forces arrayed against President Peron
 could have prevented her return. They chose not
 to, however, because she is the legitimate presi-
 dent and most Argentines still prefer a con-
 stitutional solution to their leadership crisis.
 This sentiment, though steadily eroding, was
 strong enough to convince military leaders to

 Acting President Luder waves to crowd seeking his continuation as president

 Aires. They have apparently decided again to
 stand aside and allow her government to fall vic-
 tim to its own incompetence. They undoubtedly
 reason that public disenchantment will then
 create a situation amenable to more direct
 military intervention in politics.
 Peron's acceptance of the role of a
 ceremonial head-of-state is crucial to her survival.
 If she listens to the high command and allows
 Robledo and Catiero a free hand, her government
 could limp along for several more months, with
 the military staying on the sidelines. If she insists
 on trying to rule as well as reign, the least she can
 expect will be another period of enforced rest
 away from the capital.
 Cafiero's emergency economic program is
 another key to her survival. He has acquired
 significant foreign assistance and adopted
 reasonable, gradual measures at home which
 might succeed if he is able to fend off the exorbi-
 tant wage demands which the unions are
 making.                                 25X1

 Chiang Ching's star began to fade when she
 failed to win a government position at the
 National People's Congress in January. This failure

 Chiang Ching on the distribution of a docurnen-

 personally authorized the rehabilitation of several

 CHINA
 CHIANG CHING, A FADING STAR
 Chiang Ching, wife of Mao Tse-tung, has suf-
 fered a series of setbacks this year that have vir-
 tually stripped her of the power she had wielded
 over cultural matters for nearly a decade. Her mis-
 fortunes raise serious doubts about her present
 and future role in politics. Significantly, Mao has
 been personally associated with the moves against
 Chiang Ching's last solo outing with an
 official visitor was a year ago, when she played
 host to Imelda Marcos of the Philippines. After
 the establishment in June of diplomatic relations,
 the Philippine government offered to name an
 orchid after Madame Mao, only to be told by Pek-
 ing to rename the orchid to commemorate
 Sino-Filipino friendship.
 Incidents such as these may have been
 behind the six prohibitions on Chiang Ching's
 political activity that Mao reportedly ret down in a

 document recently circulated within China. She is
 prohibited from meeting with foreigne-s alone,
 from making speeches without prior party ap-
 proval, and from meeting with Mao. The word is
 clearly out to the Chinese people that Chiang
 Ching does not have Mao's support. This deprives
 her of a powerful weapon she has used effectively
 in the past and could have been expected to use
 after Mao's death; namely, that opposition to her
 is tantamount to opposition to Mao, that she is
 the sole repository of Mao Tse-tong's thought,
 and that others in the leadership distort Mao's
 policies.
 She cannot credibly make these claims today,
 and, more important, she will not be able to do so
 in the post-Mao era, unless she finds some way to
 promote her ambitions. This is not to say that the
 left wing of the party, which she represents, is
 politically dead. Chiang Ching's views have a con-
 stituency throughout the country, and she per-
 sonally may still have supporters in the cultural
 field.
 Given Mao's dissociation from hrr, however,
 it appears that her personal political future is
 bleak and that the party's left wing will have to
 find another spokesman, one more adept at the
 political game than Chiang Ching has been.
 The fall Canton Fair, to be held October 15
 through November 15, will provide some indica-
 tion of the prospects for China's foreign trade in
 1976. Peking is undoubtedly hoping that sales will
 be better than the low levels of the previous two
 fairs. The slow economic recovery in the West,
 however, will probably inhibit any large increase
 over the $700-million level for the last two fairs.
 Purchases by Japanese traders, traditionally
 the largest contingent at the fair, will show a con-
 tinued slack demand for Chinese goods in Japan.
 The less-develcped countries have recently been
 represented in greater numbers, but the prospect
 of higher oil import bills may inhibit purchasing
 by these countries.
 US visitors, including dependent:,, may reach
 500. At the spring fair, US sales of about $35
 million exceeded the $30 million in US purchases,
 which were mostly minerals and metals. Chinese
 consumer goods have a limited market in the US.
 Peking will probably again stress exports at
 the fair. Last spring, the Chinese cut prices on
 many items and were forthcoming on matters of
 styling, labeling, packaging, and delivery dates.
 Techimport, China's whole plant import corpora-
 tion, is not likely to be represented because major
 Chinese import deals are conducted outside the
 fair.
 China's record $1-billion trade deficit in 1974
 has led to a retrenchment in imports this year.
 Total trade is expected to increase less than 10
 percent, perhaps between $14 and $15 billion.
 Preliminary trade returns from its Western trading
 partners over the first half of this year show
 China's imposts up only 1 percent and exports up
 3 percent over the same period in "1974.
 Sharp  reductions  in purchases of  US
 agricultural products have accounted for most of
 the cutbacks in iriports. Deliveries under 1973-74
 whole plant contracts are boosting imports of
 machinery and equipment, but new plant
 purchases this year total less than $50 million, a
 fraction of the total in the past two years.
 China's trade in 1975 will still show a deficit,
 although a smaller one than last year. Credits and
 other short-term borrowing will finance much of
 the deficit, and the balance of payments will likely
 improve. Sales of Chinese petroleum are only
 offsetting the decline in traditional exports.
 Unless oil exports can be boosted above current
 levels, Peking will probably maintain its present
 policy of restricting import growth to reduce its
