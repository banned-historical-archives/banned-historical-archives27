 5 JANUARY 1972
 INDOCHINA
 The heavy, continuous U.S. air strikes against the DRV from
 26 through 30 December prompted daily protests from the DRV Foreign
 Ministry, with ministry statements on the 26th and 29th and lower-
 level routine protests by the ministry spokesman on the other three
 days.  Hanoi claims the Administration had to announce the end of
 the five-day bombing because it was "being defeated militarily and
 politically."  But at the same time propagandists point to U.S.
 threats of more bombing and call for continued implementation of
 the 28 December VPA High Command order on vigilance.  President
 Nixon's 2 January TV interview is assailed as the latest evidence
 of U.S. intent to continue the strikes.  Hanoi's reaction is
 typified by a 4 January editorial in the party daily NHAN DAN
 which asked how Nixon could be so naive as to hope to win by
 following in the footsteps of his predecessor, whose air war
 against the DRV was defeated.
 Moscow's official protest on the air strikes was not issued until
 30 December, but it came in the form of a government statement
 rather than at the foreign ministry level at which Peking as
 well as Hanoi had protested.  On the same day Moscow also reported
 the signing of an agreement on "additional" Soviet assistance to
 the DRV.  The government statement was couched in relatively mild
 terms, and it may have been issued at the high level to suggest
 greater support than had come from Peking.  Moscow continues to
 link the U.S. air strikes with Peking's "rapprochement" with the
 United States.  And a TASS report of the President's TV interview
 pointedly notes his remark that the POW issue would be raised
 during his PRC visit.
 Peking's only substantial comment on the air strikes following
 the 29 December PRC Foreign Ministry statement is a PEOPLE'S
 DAILY Commentator article on the 31st which, like the statement,
 avoids personal criticism of the President.  Peking media have
 not yet mentioned his TV interview.  A Chinese speaker at a
 4 January ceremony opening a Vietnamese art exhibition made a
 passing reference to the strikes.  But Li Hsien-nien did not
 mention them in a speech at a banquet on the 29th for a visiting
 Iraqi delegation.
 DRV, PRG SCORE PRESIDENT'S TV INTERVIEW AS "BRAZEN. INSOLENT"
 The Vietnamese communists reacted promptly to the President's
 2 January radio-TV interview with CBS correspondent Dan Rather,

 with statements by both the PRG and DRV spokesmen in Paris and
 routine Hanoi radio and Front media comment.          There has as yet
 been no such authoritative propaganda as a NHAN DAN Commentator
 article, the standard Hanoi vehicle for reacting to major
 Presidential announcements.
 The first monitored reaction came in a Hanoi radio commentary
 early on the 4th--some 24 hours after the interview.  Although
 the statements in Paris were transmitted to Hanoi on VNA's
 service channel on the 3d, they were not carried in DRV and
 Front media until after the Hanoi radio commentary had been
 repeated several times on the 4th.  The statements did not
 deal with the details of the President's interview in
 declaring--in the words of the DRV spokesman--that
 his remarks again demonstrated that the Nixon policy is one of
 prolonging the war in South Vietnam, expanding it to all of
 Indochina, threatening the sovereignty and security of the
 DRV, refusing to negotiate seriously at Paris, and continuing
 to oppose the PRG's seven-point proposal.
 The initial Hanoi radio commentary said that "Nixon brazenly
 said he had personally ordered the bombing raids against North
 Vietnam," and it took issue with his justification of the
 "acts of war" by repeating the "old, groundless allegation"
 that North Vietnam has violated the understanding which led
 to the bombing halt in 1968.  The commentary countered this
 "sheer falsehood" by saying it was the United States which
 had "brazenly violated" its commitment to halt the bombing
 totally and unconditionally.     As documentation of its claim,
 it observed that former Defense Secretary Clark Clifford had
 said that he did not understand the reasons given by the Nixon
 Administration to justify the recent bombing raids.  Without
 explicitly mentioning the bombing halt, the DRV Paris spokesman
 had cryptically said that the President in his interview "once
 again made unreasonable and deceitful allegations and repeated
 the absurd history of the so-called 'secret understandings,'
 which have been resolutely rejected by us and condemned by world
 public opinion . . . ."  This ambiguity accords with other
 comment on the recent air strikes.
 A 4 January NHAN DAN editorial rounding up the Moscow and Peking
 and other communist and worldwide condemnations of the air
 strikes included a passage on the President's interview.  As
 broadcast by Hanoi radio--some five hours after the initial
 commentary on the President--the editorial said that "everyone"

 has pointed out that the air strikes again proved, among other
 things, that the Nixon Doctrine has gone bankrupt, and that
 "public opinion has also exposed Nixon's boasts that the war
 is going to end and that the United States is gradually
 withdrawing from Vietnam."  Claiming that the President had
 been "seriously upset" by his "serious" military defeats in
 the air strikes and worldwide protests, the editorial said
 that in his interview "Nixon sought by every means to defend
 his crimes while continuing to make insolent threats . . . .
 How can people believe in his arguments about 'self-protective
 reaction?"'  The editorial went on to attribute to the "U.S.
 Government," rather than the President, a series of arguments
 to justify the strikes--"self-protective reaction, measures
 aimed at protecting the lives of U.S. troops and cutting off
 supplies and preventing losses in Laos, and action taken
 because U.S. POWs have not been released."  Insisting that the
 real motive behind the President's move was to salvage something
 from his "heavy, basic defeats" throughout Indochina, the
 editorial labeled U.S. arguments as "inconsistent and illogical"
 and "smelling of banditry."
 POW ISSUE      Initial comment on the 4th and 5th assails the
 President's justification of the air strikes so
 long as American prisoners are held by the communists.  But
 propagandists skirt the exchange in which the President asserted
 that in Paris "the communists had totally rejected" the notion
 of a prisoner release if the United States set a deadline for
 withdrawal.  The only known reference in available Vietnamese
 communist propaganda is in two VNA English-language news items
 on the 5th which quote Senator McGovern's contradiction of the
 President's remarks.  These VNA items have not been repeated
 for domestic Vietnamese audiences to date.  VNA says without
 comment:
 Senator George McGovern said in a television
 interview Monday that President Nixon had
 deceived the American people with his statement
 that his idea of releasing captured U.S.
 armymen in return for a declared deadline for
 American withdrawal from Southeast Asia was
 rejected by North Vietnam negotiators.  It is
 simply not true--and the President knows it is
 not true--that our negotiators in Paris have
 ever discussed with the North Vietnamese the
 question of total U.S. withdrawal from Indochina
 in conjunction with the release of our prisoners,
 the Senator said.

 Both the PRG and DRV spokesmen in Paris had merely said
 cryptically that the President made "deceitful" or "perfidious"
 statements in an attempt to shift the blame for the deadlock
 of the Paris talks which has prevented the repatriation of
 prisoners.  But both also refer to points one and two of the
 PgG proposal--on withdrawal and a settlement in the South--in
 the more intransigent terms which have been fairly standard
 since last fall.  Thus the PRG statement, after calling for
 withdrawal, says "at the same time" the United States must
 "immediately give up all support" of Thieu.  And the DRV
 spokesman spells out some of the hardened elaboration that
 Pham Van Dong had voiced during his November visit to Peking.
 For example, the spokesman specified that the United States
 must end all action in both zones of Vietnam.  And a Hanoi radio
 commentary on the 5th repeats this and goes on to say under point
 two that the United States must "renounce its support for and
 commitments to the fascist Thieu clique."
 Hanoi, of course ignores the President's remark that the
 prisoner issue might be brought up during both his February trip
 to Peking and his Moscow visit* next May and his revelation that
 the issue has already been discussed with both the Chinese and
 the Soviets--between Kissinger and Chou En-lai in Peking in July
 and October and with Gromyko in Washington in late September.
 *  Hanoi studiously avoided any explicit mention of the President's
 trip to Peking despite its vitriolic anti-Chinese polemic during
 July and August.  The only known explicit mention of either trip
 in Hanoi media appeared in the November issue of a Journal of
 the Central Committee's Propaganda and Training Department THOI
 SU PHO THONG (CURRENT EVENTS).  The article charged the
 President with "using vague hints to create the illusion that
 those trips will help the United States to resolve the Vietnam
 problem."  The only known reference to the Peking visit in Front
 media also appeared in November in a broadcast in English to
 U.S. servicemen on the 25th which quoted a U.S. general as
 dismissing the trip as having no significance for the Vietnamese
 problem.

 TASS REPORT NOTES PRESIDENT INTENDS TO RAISE POW ISSUE IN PRC
 Moscow's fullest account of President Nixon's 2 January radio-TV
 interview is provided by TASS in a 3 January dispatch which selectively
 reports his comments on Vietnam.     TASS says that the President
 "refused" to give assurances that by election day there would be no
 Americans anywhere in Indochina, and that he pointed out that if no
 progress were made in negotiations "we will have to continue to retain
 a residual force in Vietnam" and "continue the possibility of air
 strikes on the North Vietnamese."  TASS says that the President "side-
 stepped" a question asking how, then, he could campaign saying he had
 ended the American involvement.  The report notes that the President
 again tried to "justify" the bombing by saying that it is necessary
 to protect American troops and "get back" the POWs.  TASS interjects
 the observation that the United States has never answered the PRG's
 "constructive proposal" that would create conditions for solving the
 Vietnam issue and "all questions connected with this problem."
 The TASS report mentions that the President declared his intention to
 raise the question of American POWs during his visit to Peking, but
 fails to note that he also said he had talked to Gromyko about the
 question and intended to discuss it during his visit to Moscow as
 well.  A Moscow radio domestic service report on 2 January similarly
 picks up the President's expression of intention to discuss POWs in
 Peking and cites speculation by "journalists" that General Haig,
 now leading the advance delegation in Peking, has been "authorized
 to give an explanation of the recent American bombing raids on
 North Vietnam."
 There has been no comment on the interview in the Soviet press and
 the only available Moscow radio comment comes in a Mandarin-language
 broadcast on 5 January which, in the course of criticism of Peking's
 "collusion" with the United States in Indochina, refers to the
 President's remarks.  It says the President indicated that the
 United States hoped to achieve a dual objective with the bombings--
 to "intimidate" the people of the DRV and inflict heavy losses on
 them, and to demonstrate that the United States has no desire to
 withdraw from Southeast Asia and that-it is prepared to solve
 problems by force.   A 4 January commentary on the "unofficial"
 Radio Peace and Progress, broadcast in English to Asia, takes issue
 with the President's reasoning that the bombing is necessary to
 free the POWs and protect the lives of U.S. troops.  It acknowledges
 that if the present withdrawal rate continues by the end of the year
 there will be only some 25-35,000 U.S. troops left in Vietnam, but
 says that this means that the war will go on "for at least another
 year," and points out that everything the President said is
 essentially the same as was being said three years ago.

 DRV CLAIMS 24 PLANES, 7 POWS DURING LATE DECEMBER B(t1BING
 Hanoi's claim that eight U.S. planes were downed and two pilots
 captured on 30 December, the fifth and last day of the
 continuous U.S. bombing of North Vietnam which had begun on
 26 December, came first in a Hanoi radio report on the 30th.
 A few minutes later Hanoi broadcast the DRV Foreign Ministry
 spokesman's statement charging that the Nixon Administration
 "again mobilized hundreds of aircraft to continue to carry
 out air raids against many densely populated areas including
 the Trang pagoda and a suburban area of the Vinh provincial
 capital" in Quang Binh and Nghe An provinces.  Although the
 spokesman says that "hundreds" of planes "again" bombed on
 the 30th, the four earlier protests had not mentioned numbers,
 instead referring to "many" or "many waves."   A QUAN DOI
 NHAN DAN editorial on the 30th, however, says that since
 17 December the "U.S. imperialists" have sent '-hundreds" of
 jet fighters to repeatedly bomb or strafe many populated
 areas.
 Like the earlier protests, the 30 December one says that the
 bombings "cynically violate", the U.S. commitment to end the
 bombing of the DRV and are "an insolent challenge to the
 broad public opinion in the world and the progressive people
 in the United States."  It says that at a time when the
 President "is clamoring that he is 'finding every possible
 means to bring home all American POWs', the U.S. war
 escalation against the DRV will but lengthen the list of
 captured American militarymen."  It predicts heavier defeats
 for the Nixon Administration "the more obstinate and truculent"
 it is.
 The spokesman's statement notes the downing of the eight
 aircraft but does not mention the two captured pilots, saying
 only that "many" other planes were damaged and a number of
 pilots killed or captured.  The initial radio announcement had
 specified that seven of the claimed planes were downed in
 Nghe An and one in Quang Binh.  The pilots, however, were
 reportedly captured in Nghi Xuan district of Ha Tinh Province--
 which borders both Nghe An and Quang Binh.  The 31 December
 NHAN DAN editorial said that "the Ha Tinh armed forces and
 people, in coordination with the Nghe An armed forces and
 people, captured aggressor pilots who had been shot down."
 The radio report additionally said that the armed forces and
 people of the coastal district of Nghe An and Ha Tinh

 ''courageously fought the enemy coming to rescue aggressor
 pilots who had fallen into the sea."  And it reported that
 a total of 19 planes were downed during the five days of
 bombing:  ten in Nghe An, seven in Quang Binh and two in
 Thanh Hoa.  Hanoi on 1 January reported the downing of an
 unmanned reconnaissance plane over Nghe An that day, bringing
 Hanoi's total of downed planes to 3,428.*
 The downing of the eight planes and the capture of the two
 pilots was immediately acclaimed that day, the 30th, by a VPA
 High Command communique which "warmly commends the fresh
 exploits of the armed forces in Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh
 provinces and reaffirms the determination of the Vietnamese
 people to foil any new adventurous acts taken by the U.S.
 aggressors against the DRV."
 Just as it had presented four pilots at a press conference on
 20 December, Hanoi on the 31st presents the two captured
 the day before.  The conference was again held by the Information
 and Press Department of the DRV Foreign Ministry and foreign and
 local newsmen were again present.  Ngo Dien, head of the press
 department, said the purpose of the conference was to give further
 evidence of the U.S. war escalation and its "ignominious failure."
 Newsmen were invited to go to a hospital to photograph a third
 U.S. pilot--captured on the 26th--who was injured.  Citing the
 29 December foreign ministry statement, Dien said that the
 bombing was "an extremely serious step of war escalation, a big
 crime and an impudent challenge to world public opinion."
 Referring to the VPA High Command communique of the 30th, which
 had also reported the downing of 19 planes in the five days
 of bombing, Dien recalled that downings during the 17-18
 December action brought the total to 24 planes and seven U.S.
 pilots captured in the 17-30 December period.  (The three
 prisoners were identified as David Wesley Hoffman and Norris
 Alphonso Charles, and Lynn Ellis Guenther, the injured pilot;
 brief statements attributed to them, giving their identity and
 thanking the Vietnamese for the treatment they had received,
 were carried by Hanoi radio in English to Southeast Asia on the
 31st.)
 * A 31 December Hanoi radio roundtable discussion on the Indo-
 Chinese peoples' victories in 1971 claimed that during the year
 56 U.S. planes--"mostly jet fighters and one B-52"--were downed,
 a number it said was "markedly greater than in the previous year."

 Also on the 31st, the DRV War Crimes Commission held a press
 conference to denounce the U.S. "crimes" recently committed
 "against the civilian population in North Vietnam."  The VNA
 account of the conference noted that "a film and an exhibition
 of photographs on these crimes" were shown.  Newsmen were given
 a special communique by the commission detailing the alleged
 results of the U.S. bombings from 26 to 30 December.  The communique
 spelled out the number of sorties and bombs used per day in a
 given province and detailed damages.  No total of Vietnamese
 casualties was released; in some cases the numbers of people killed
 and injured were combined, but the various reports add up to at
 least 44 deaths.
 The reported attacks against two hospitals during the raids
 prompted a statement by the DRV Ministry of Public Health on the
 31st which denounced to the world public "the savage crimes" of
 the United States.  It said that on the 26th, 27th and 29th "many
 flights" of aircraft attacked the provincial hospital of Thanh
 Hoa and the hospital in Dong Hoi, capital of Quang Binh, which
 had been destroyed prior to 1968 and had been rebuilt.
 HANOI HAILS "PROPER EXECUTION" OF VPA ORDER ON VIGILANCE
 The role of vigilance and combat readiness continues to be stressed
 in the propaganda as it has since the U.S. strikes on 17-18
 December.  There is frequent reference to the VPA High Command
 order, dated 28 December and released on the 29th, which called
 for continued vigilance and combat readiness.*  The downing of
 eight planes on the 30th is hailed as an example of properly
 executing the order and comment frequently warns, in urging
 continued awareness, that additional U.S. attacks may be
 forthcoming.  Thus the 30 December NHAN DAN editorial, claiming
 that the downings of U.S. planes have increased the North's
 "enthusiasm and confidence," cautions that the "U.S. aggressors
 are still very stubborn and warlike.  They still cultivate the
 illusion of using their air force as a trump card to extricate
 themselves from total defeat on the Indochinese battlefield.
 They will commit other crimes."  NHAN DAN says that from now
 until "total victory" the North "will have to continuously cope
 with the cunning plots and frenzied actions" of the United States
 "because the more it sustains heavy defeats in South Vietnam,

 Laos, and Cambodia, the more intense its reckless actions
 against the DRV."  It goes on to urge heightened vigilance on
 the part of the armed forces; earlier it had praised various
 specific units of the armed forces--for example, antiaircraft,
 air force, missile, radar, engineer, and signal units--for
 their role in defending North Vietnam in the past few days.
 A radio broadcast on the 30th cites various defense preparations
 in response to the High Command order, noting, for example,
 that in Nghe An militia units in coastal areas "have built
 new watch towers and combat positions" from which they can
 attack commandos and "fight the enemy who may land by boats
 or by aircraft."  In Thanh Hoa, the broadcast reports, the
 people and self-defense militia forces "in all localities, at
 all agencies and along all communications lines are
 expeditiously building or repairing many communications tunnels
 and trenches, shelters, and combat positions."
 A Hanoi radio commentary on the 30th, hails the downing of the
 eight planes on 30 December as an example of executing the High
 Command order and notes that 19 planes have been dowtied in five
 consecutive days.  It warns "Nixon and his subordinates":  "The
 firepower of the Vietnamese armed forces and people throughout
 this heroic and indomitable country is a hatred-boiled firepower
 of an entire nation that is determined to fight and win.
 Definitely this firepower will reduce to ash the frenzied and
 perfidious intimidating allegations of the U.S. President and
 defense secretary, will burn all insidious and cruel war designs
 and tricks of the U.S. Imperialists and will reduce to ash their
 Vietnamization policy."
 A NHAN DAN editorial on the 31st also praises Nghe An and
 Quang Binh provinces for downing the eight planes in compliance
 with the VPA order, and hails the antiaircraft and missile units,
 and the artillery and self-defense militia forces "which
 resolutely fought off the enemy coming to rescue the aggressor
 pilots who had parachuted into the sea," as well as engineer
 and signal combatants.  The editorial, observing that the
 United States "has not renounced its evil aggressive designs,"
 warns that the U.S. "imperialists will resort to cunning tricks
 and criminal acts against the people in the northern part of
 our country."  NHAN DAN urges cadres and combatants everywhere
 "to devote all their efforts to executing the High Command
 order."  The editorial says that "our armed forces have achieved

 close coordination of combat, raised an intense fire-net and
 directed stunning blows at the U.S. aggressor pilots.'
 The NHAN DAN editorial notes that some of the attacking planes
 came from bases in South Vietnam when it quotes "some panicky
 enemy pilots, who safely returned" to Da Nang after the air
 raids on the 29th, as saying that "North Vietnam's air
 defense forces are much stronger than they were in 1968"
 and the JRV's firepower better than ever before.  While the
 editorial also mentions that U.S. planes used for the raids
 came from U.S. ships off the Vietnamese coast and bases in
 Thailand, as well as South Vietnam, only one of the official
 protests--the 29 December DRV Foreign Ministry statement-,-
 points out that the planes came from the three locations.
 The DRV War Crimes special communique released on the 31st
 refers only to the carriers and the bases in Thailand.
 A QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial on the 31st also praises the
 antiaircraft and air force troops and militia and self-defense
 forces in the provinces which downed the eight planes on the
 30th.  Similarly suggesting there will be further raids, the
 editorial says that the U.S. "imperialists remain stubborn
 until their death.  They still recklessly threaten to continue
 to strike the North if the DRV resists U.S. aircraft."*  It
 warns that U.S. planes which violate DRV airspace "will
 certainly be downed."  And the paper says that "everywhere
 in the North, there is a determination to fight and win, to
 strictly carry out the High Command's orders, to sharpen one's
 vigilance, to deal violent blows at the enemy and to
 wholeheartedly" assist the South.
 *  VNA on 30 December atypically carried an account of the
 downing of one of the U.S. planes on the 18th by a MIG.
 Earlier statements by the U.S. Command in Saigon on the involve-
 ment of MIGs during the 17-18 December weekend had typically
 been ignored by Hanoi.

 PRG, NFLSV DENOUNCE STRIKES AGAINST DRV, WARN OF "PUNISHMENT"
 Official PRG and NFLSV protests denouncing the 26-30 December U.S.
 bombing raids against North Vietnam were not issued until the
 day the air strikes ended.  A PRG Foreign Ministry statement*
 and a NFLSV Central Committee statement on the 30th condemned the
 raids, and the air strikes were scored a day later in a statement
 from the Vietnam Alliance of National Democratic Peace Forces.
 Both the PRG Foreign Ministry and the Vietnam Alliance statements
 voice support for the DRV Foreign Ministry statement issued on
 the 29th and echo its claim that the DRV is a sovereign and
 independent country, with a right to self-defense.  Neither
 statement, however, characterizes it as a "socialist" country
 as the DRV statement had.  Both statements score the U.S.
 justifications for the raids--that they were "protective
 reaction" raids and that North Vietnam had violated the "under-
 standings" between it and the United States--as an attempt to
 deceive public opinion.  The PRG statement calls the strikes
 'extremely serious criminal acts" and a "premeditated step of
 war escalation."  It charges that the raids--along with the
 intensification' of the war throughout Indochina, "the .evast6n
 of the PRG's seven-point peace initiative," and U.S. "sabotage"
 of the Paris talks--"have further laid bare the Nixon
 Administration's aggressive, stubborn, and bellicose nature."
 South Vietnamese communist comment uniformly warns the United
 States that its action against the North will bring a
 response from the South.  Thus the PRG statement says that
 the South Vietnamese people are "determined to turn their hatred
 into stormy attacks on the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys and
 duly punish them for any one of their criminal acts against our
 people in the North."  The NFLSV statement, expressing
 indignation "at the new heinous crimes" against the North, says
 that the United States "is mistaken if it thinks that its
 frantic war acts can shake the combat will of the Vietnamese
 people.  All its aggressive designs, however brutal, will only
 incense the people and army in both zones. . . ."
 *  The earlier DRV charges of U..S, intrusions and strikes
 on the 17th and 18th were similarly echoed in a 21 December
 PRG Foreign Ministry statement.

 Comment from the South does not reiterate many of Hanoi's
 claims concerning the raids, although a Liberation Radio
 commentary on the 30th does cite some of the details,
 including the allegations that 24 U.S. planes have been
 downed since the 17th and that four pilots w'are captured
 on the 18th and two more on the 30th.  An NFLSV/PRG message
 to the Vietnam Fatherland Front and the DRV Government,
 broadcast by Liberation Radio on 30 December, hails the
 "victories" of the North but fails to mention any specific
 figures, instead citing the downing of "scores" of aircraft
 and capture of "many" pilots.  An LPA commentary on the lot
 echoes Hanoi comment when it says that President Nixon
 "had to o-4er a halt" to the bombings on the 30th and calls
 this action an admission of the Administration's "glaring
 failure."

 USSR GOVERNMENT STATEMENT SCORES BOM{3iNG; AID ACCORD SIGNED
 Moscow waited until the end of the five-day series of heavy U.S.
 air raids on the DRV, which began on 26 December, to condemn
 them in a USSR Government statement on the 30th.  While Moscow's
 statement is at a higher level than the !.RV Foreign Ministry
 statements it suppoxts and the 29 December PRC Foreign Ministry
 statement, it is nevertheless cast in relatively mild terms.
 It routinely promises to continue giving the DRV the "necessary
 assistance",; simultaneously, Soviet media report a new agreement
 providing additional Soviet aid to "further strengthen the DRV's
 defense capacity."  The brief announcement of the agreement is
 publi9hed on the front pages of PRAVDA and IZVFSTIYA directly
 below the government statement,
 Other propaganda on the bombing includes further protest
 statements by Soviet public organizations and the usual protest
 meetings in factories and enterprises throughout the country
 which have customarily followed Soviet Government statements
 on Indochina.  Routine-level attention includes reportage of
 Vietnamese communist comment and reports of protests being
 voiced throughout the world, including the United States.  TASS
 on 3] December briefly cited critical remarks by Senators
 Fulbright, Church, McGovern, Muskie, Humphrey, and Mansfield.
 Many Moscow commentators continue to link the U.S. decision
 ~o initiate the bombings with Peking's policies of
 ''rapprochement" with the United States, particularly President
 Nixon's forthcoming visit.
 GOVERNMENT     Although the USSR Government statement scores
 STATEMENT      the "barbarous" bombings and notes, like routine
 propaganda, that Secretary Laird said that they
 are being made on instructions of the White House," it does
 not mention President Nixon by name.  (A 25 February 1971
 government statement on the Laos incursion warned that actions
 of the United States "undermine the very foundations on which
 interstate relations are built . . . and cannot but affect
 Soviet-American relations too.'7)
 The statement once again, like routine propaganda, says that
 the aggression shows the "hypocrisy" of American statements
 about the "curtailment" of U.S. involvement in Indochina and
 about striving for a peaceful settlement, and shows that
 Washington really seeks a "military solution."  It says nothing

 about the Furls talks.  And it ciao fails to specifically mention
 the PRG's seven-point proposal although it does demand an end to
 U.S. aggression, full and uncord:Ltiinal troop withdrawal from
 Indochina, and respect for the Indochinese peoples' right to
 solve their own affairs.
 BACKGROUND:  The most recent Soviet Government statement on
 Indochina was on 25 February 1971, belatedly scoring the Laos
 incursion which had been announced on the 8th.  Since the
 official cessation of the sustained U.S. bombing in November
 1968, Moe:;aw has normally supported DRV Foreign M:.nistry
 statements ot- U.S. bombing raids only with lower-level
 propaganda.*  The 2]. September 1971 strikes were denounced in
 a belated 1 October TASS statement,** apparently to place Moscow
 officially on record in support of the DRV before Podgornyy's
 arrival in Hanoi on 3 October.  The air strikes of March 1971
 prompted no such formal statement.  On 16 December 1970 a Soviet
 Government statement had belatedly supported the 10 December
 DRV party-government appeal for vigilance in the wake of the
 21 November raids and had denounced President Nixon's 1.0 December
 press conference containing "threats" to resume bombing.  The
 21 November raids had earlier been condemned in a TASS statement
 on the 23d.  A Soviet Government statement, read by Kosygin at
 a 4 May 1970 press conference, had included a denunciation of the
 1-2 May bombings of the DRV but was mainly concerned with the
 incursion into Cambodia.
 AID AGREEMENT     Moscow media cryptically reported on the 30th
 that as a result of talks in Moscow "of major
 significance" an agreement was signed on the USSR's "additional
 assistance gratis" to "further strengthen the DRV's defense
 capacity."  There has been no elaboration so far from Moscow and
 virtually no followup comment.  VNA's 1 January report, however,
 says that the agreement, signed on 29 December, was for
 "supplementary non-refund military aid" to the DRV for 1972.
 VNA adds that the accord was signed by Soviet Col. Gen. G.S.
 Sidorovich, vice chairman of the State Committee for Economic
 Relations with Foreign Countries, and the DRV charge d'affaires.
 *   Before the cessation of the sustained bombing Moscow had
 customarily supported the DRV on various developments in
 connection with the bombings with USSR Government statements.
 **  The TRENDS of 29 December 1971 on page 10 erroneously stated
 that the September strikes had prompted only routine comment.

 Other officials of the Soviet committee and a defense ministry
 representative attended the ceremony, as did the PRG Ambassador
 and the DRV military attache.
 The aid agreement:, although signed at a low level and receiving
 little publicity, takes on added interest in the wake of the
 air attacks.  VNA quotes Sidorovich as expressing "indignation"
 at the latest bombing raids in a speech at the signing ceremony.
 The limited publicity given the current accord, however, is not
 without precedent.  On 18 August 1971 TASS had similarly
 tersely reported the signing of agreements in Moscow on
 additional aid "to strengthen the ARV defense potentialities,'
 giving neither the date of the accord nor the names of the
 signatories.  VNA's report shed no further light on the
 circumstances of the signing, and the general secretiveness
 seemed to have been designed to cover up prolonged and difficult
 negotiations.*  But Moscow does normally give considerable
 publicity to its aid agreements--both the usual annual ones,
 the most recent of which was signed or 7 October during
 Podgornyy's visit to Hanoi, and "supplementary" ones signed in
 June 1970 and November 1968.
 ATTACKS       Many Moscow commentators continue to link Peking's
 ON PEKING     policy of "rapprochement" with the United States
 and its invitation to President Nixon with the
 U.S. decision to make the bombing raids.  A RED STAR article by
 Lt. Col. Ponomarev on 31 December on Secretary Laird's year-end
 press conference even says that he "was ultimately contelled to
 make it understood" that the true purpose of the bombings was
 to "intimidate the peoples of Indochina before Nixon's trip to
 Peking."
 Ignoring the 29 December PRC Foreign Ministry statement, some
 commentators continue to point to Peking's "silence" on or
 low-key response to the bombings.  A PRAVDA article by
 Mayevckiy, as summarized by TASS on 4 Jr-iuary, says that
 "foreign commentators" feel that the new U.S. aggression "has
 a direct bearing" on the President's forthcoming visit to
 Peking and cites Sulzberger of the New York TIMES as saying
 that "the Chinese did not come out with energetic, to Peking's
 standards, objections."  A roundup of foreign comment on
 *  The August 1971 agreement is discussed in the 18 August TRENDS,

 Peking's attitude in LITERARY GAZETTE on 1 January is preceded
 by the editorial comment that "the Peking press is writing
 about anything and everything except" the U.S. raids on the
 DRV.  TASS on 30 December and a radio broadcast in Mandarin
 the next day cite an AFP report that in a 29 December speech
 for a visiting Iraqi delegation, Li }isien-nien "did not say
 a word about the massive bombing of North Vietnam," and
 comment that this confirms Peking's intention not to draw
 attention to the American raids while the American advance
 delegation is in the PRC.
 The only available Moscow acknowledgments of the PRC Foreign
 Ministry statement are in Mandarin-language commentaries by
 Vasiliyev broadcast on 31 December and 2 January* which say
 that the U.S. "ruling clique" has "completely ignored" the
 statement because  it knows that Peking's "serious warnings"
 and ''verbal threats" are not worthy of attention.  Vasiliyev
 adds that some of the most intensive bombing came after Peking
 issued the statement.
 PEOPLE'S DAILY COMMENTATOR ECHOES FOREIGN MINISTRY ON BCr1I3ING
 The 29 December PRC Foreign Ministry statement condemning the
 U.S. bombings is followed by a 31 December PEOPLE'S DAILY
 Commentator article which denounces the air strikes without
 recalling the foreign ministry statement.  The raids are given
 little attention in other comment, and as yet Peking has not
 mentioned President Nixon's 2 January radio-TV interview.
 The Commentator article does not directly criticize the President
 in claiming that the bombing of North Vietnam shows that the
 Nixon Administration's Vietnamization plan is suffering defeats.
 Similarly, the PRC Foreign Ministry statement referred to the
 "Nixon Administration" but not to the President himself.  While
 Peking does not attack the President on its own authority, a
 rcutine-level NCNA commentary on 30 December employs the
 the device of quoting statements by American spokesmen to show
 *  TASS has not reported the PRC statement.  The 13 December 1970
 PRC party-government statement supporting the DRV appeal was not
 reported by TASS until the 17th--a report which was published
 in PRAVDA on the 18th--after the release of the belated
 16 December Soviet Government statement supporting the DRV
 appeal.

 President Nixon's personal responsibility for the bombings.
 Thus NCNA notes that SecreLdiy Laird, in his 27 December press
 conference, disclosed that the raids were approved by the
 President, and it cites White House spokesman 7.legler for the
 statement that the bombings are "totally consistent'! with
 President Nixon's stated policies.  Adding that the raids
 have aroused widespread domestic and foreign condemnation,
 NCNA says 30 Democratic Representatives sent the President a
 telegram on the 28th urging that he stop the current bombing,
 and it cites an unnamed Democratic Senator as saying that the
 bombings show the bankruptcy of the "Nixon policy of
 Vietnsmization."
 The PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article, in language reminiscent
 of the 24 December Commentator article scoring the 18 December
 air intrusions, charges that the new "air crime" has"exposed
 the aggressive features of U.S. imperialism' and "torn off its
 peace mask with regard to the Vietnam question.'  It scores
 the U.S. imperialists for trying to justify their action by
 saying that the raids "are for withdrawing their forces from
 South Vietnam," and repeats that if the United States really
 wants to withL~_aw it can do so unconditionally and completely
 without anyone standing in the way.  Commentator recalls that
 the United States has all along refused to reply to the PRG
 seven-point proposal.  The article 1Rbels as "shameless
 sophistry" U.S. statements that the bombing is of "limited
 duration" and not in violation of U.S. commitments to cease
 the bombing.  After again praising the Indochinese peoples'
 "splendid new exploits," PEOPLE'S DAILY reiterates that the
 Chinese people will, as always, "resolutely support" the
 Vietnamese and other Indochinese peoples, and it expresses
 confidence that the "iron bastion" of the three Indochines^
 people fighting in unity will defeat any new U.S. military
 adventures.
 A passing reference to the bombings was made by Shih Shao-hua,
 "a leading member of the cultural group under the State
 Council," in a speech at a 4 January ceremony opening a
 ?               Vietnamese art exhibition.  According to NCNA, he briefly
 condemned U.S. imperialism for recently bombing the DRV
 "savagely and repeatedly," and expressed the indignation of
 the Chinese people and their "firm support` for the DRV
 Foreign Ministry statements.  He reiterated that the Chinese
 people "firmly support and assist" the people of Vietnam and
 the other Indochinese countries in their war against U.S.

 YEAR-END REVIEWS OPTIMISTIC ON STRUGGLE IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 Vietnamese communist propaganda on the fighting in 1971 claims
 that the United States has failed in its efforts to prepare
 the ARVN to replace U.S. troops, has not met its pacification
 goals, and has not been able to strengthen and stabilize the
 Saigon government.  The propaganda repeatedly stresses that
 the strongest allied efforts were "strategically" defeated and
 that the way is now open for the "complete" defeat of allied
 forces.  While this may merely be rhetoric to bolster the
 morale of the communist forces, some of the language used
 suggests genuine optimism on the course of the war.
 PLAF CO+1UNIQi':     Military developments in South Vietnam
 during the past year were authoritatively
 assessed in a 24 December communique of the PLAF Command,
 publicized by Hanoi and PRG media on 3 January.  While
 reflecting the reduced level of military action in South
 Vietnam during 1971, the communique axudes confidence about
 the future.  It argues that the PLAF and "people" have
 frustrated the most severe allied efforts to win a "decisive
 victory" for Vietnamization and that, with U.S. and other
 foreign troops withdrawing and the ARVN "seriously clibintegrating,':
 the PLZF is "fully capable of defeating the Saigon puppet army
 even if it received more U.S. dollars, weapons, and air support."
 It routinely claims that the balance of forces is tipping more
 and more in favor of the ^ommunist forces and then adds
 cryptically:  "All the three kinds of our armed forces are
 being deployed for attack on the enemy in all the three strategic
 zones"--the'mountains, plains, and urban areas.
 Discussing the alleged decline of the ARVN, the communique
 claims Saigon's troops have never faced "so serious a collapse"
 since the Tet offensive in 1968 and that they have never
 surrendered or been captured in such numbers as in 1971.  It
 claims that a total of nearly 300,000 Saigon troops were put
 out of action throughout all of Indochina during the past year.

 5 JANUARY 1972
 For the second year in a row, the year-end communique's tally of
 alleged allied losses in South Vietnam contains lower claims
 than the previous year's.*  The communique asserts that its
 forces in South Vietnam during 1971 wiped out a total of nearly
 250,000 allied troops, a figura sharply reduced from the
 420,000 allied troops which the PLAF supposedly "annihilated"'
 in 1970.   (The peak year for the communists, according to
 their statistics, was 1969 when 645,000 allied troops were
 allegedly put out of action in South Vietnam.)
 Claimed casualties among U.S. and other foreign troops are even
 more dramatically red'.ced from the previous year, the current
 communique claiming 20,000 non-Vietnamese troops wiped out in
 1971 while the communique a year ago said that 110,000 foreign
 troops were among the 1970 casualties.  Alleged allied material
 losses are also down from the previous year.  Thus the communique
 claims 1,800 airy '-ft downed or destroyed in 1971 in comparison
 with the 5,900 aircraft claimed in 1970.  Similarly, 8,000
 military vehicles were allegedly wrecked or captured in 1971,
 while 14,000 were claimed in 1970.
 OTHER COMMENT     The PLAF Command's optimistic evaluation of the
 communists' military position in South Vietnam
 and elsewhere in Indochina has been echoed in other propaganda,
 including editorials in the 4 January issues of NHAN DAN and
 QUAN DOI NHAN DAN pegged to the PLAF communique.  Thus, the
 4 January NHAN DAN editorial reiterated that the "great
 strategic" victories of 1971 created "a new and very favorable
 offensive position" for the "southern revolution," and that "the
 PLAF is strong enough to completely defeat the Saigon puppet army."
 The QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial praised "noticeable" PLAF
 progress in "coordinated combat involving various armed branches
 and in fighting big battles of annihilation" and it claimed that
 the allies, following "their defeat in early 1971," were "no
 longer capable of launching large-scale operations."  The paper
 also underlined the importance of building up local political
 and military forces and other tasks--"of the greatest strategic
 importance"--aimed at defeating rural pacification.
 Prior to the release of the PLAF communique, its tone was
 anticipated in the 1 January NHAN DAN editorial which maintained
 *  The PLAF Command communique on fighting in 1970 was analyzed
 in the 6 January 1971 TRENDS, pages 9-10.

 that "the puppet troops cannot fight alone without the U.S.
 forces as their prop, and U.S. aircraft are not strong enough
 to protect them."  It held that the U.S. "war of aggression
 is going downhill" and that the situation is favorable for the
 Indochinese "people" to completely defeat the "U.S. aggressors
 and their lackeys."
 A Liberation Radio editorial marking the New Year, broadcast
 on 31 December, also expressed communist confidence in strong
 terms.  It maintained that the PLAF's regular troops are in
 good shape, have experience in big battles, and "are capable
 of launching big, annihilating attacks on various battlefields."
 The editorial held that the allies are, among other things,
 trying to "avoid big annihilating battles," to save
 Vietnamization and lessen losses.  It predicted "more difficulties
 and hardships" for its side in "a very arduous but glorious phase
 of struggle," and stated that the armed forces and 'people"
 will develop their "winning position" and "stage relentless
 offensives" with determination to "intensify their activities on
 all fronts and in all three strategic zones."
 Other PRG comment included an article in the army paper QUAN GIAI
 PRONG, broadcast by Liberation Radio on 4 January.  The commentary
 repeated standard claims and went on, after pointing to the
 alleged failure of the pacification effort, to assert that "new
 concerted uprisings will break out throughout the South, fierce
 ones that will completely smash the pacification scheme"' and
 which will be "a painful blow to the Vietnamization strategy
 and the Nixon Doctrine."  Discussing the urban areas, the
 commentary maintained that the "people's struggles" in the
 cities are "preparations for revolutionary storms" and "are
 capable of turning into a revolutionary high tide which will
 make the cities the enemy's basic weakness and our important
 political strength."

 S I NO- SOVIET- U, S,                                RELATIONS
 SINO-SOVIET TROUBLES MARK ONSET OF YEAR OF NIXON VISITS
 The collision of Soviet and Chinese interests in South Asia and
 in the United Nations, intensifying the strains arising. from
 developments in the two communist powers' triangular relations
 with the United States, has brought Sino-Soviet relations to an
 acrimonious state at the onset of the new year.  The policy
 review in Peking's authoritative New Year's Day joint editorial,
 a paean to the successes of Chouist moves in the world arena,
 offers a rationale for Chinese efforts to gain leverage in the
 international community in order to compete with the two super-
 powers and to take advantage of their clashes of interest.  The
 editorial confers Mao's sanction on these policies by quoting the
 chairman as stating that international affairs must be settled
 through consultation by all concerned and not be left to the
 two big powers.
 The Chinese editorial, which sharply denounces "the Brezhnev
 renegade clique" while sparing President Nixon any direct attack,
 repeats the charge of unspecified conspiracies by Liu Shao-chi
 "and other swindlers who had illicit relations with foreign
 countries."*  In the context of Peking's invitation to the
 President and the purge of Lin Piao and other military leaders,
 such a charge raises the question of possible opposition by the
 purge victims to developments in Sino-U.S. relations in the past
 year--developments which Peking interpreted as part of an effort
 to isolate the Soviet Union as its main enemy.  While Moscow has
 not cited this charge and has treaded carefully in discussing the
 purge, Soviet comment has given some play to suggestions that
 the recent Chinese internal upheaval is connected with the
 President's impending visit.  Moscow has also complained that
 strongly anti-Soviet figures in Puking are- involved in these
 developments, and an article in the Soviet military organ RED
 STAR on 29 December chose to raise the border issue in
 ?              discussing the Chinese leadership struggle in connection with
 Peking's moves within the triangular setting.
 * A similar charge was also made in major editorials on 1 July
 and 1 December.  The 1 December editorial, a veil;:d explanation
 of the recent purge, included the charge in a passage recalling
 conspiracies by Kao Kang, Jao Shu-shih, Peng Te-huai, and Huang
 Ko-cheng--an intriguing list in that these former purge victims
 were tainted with suspicion of connivance with the Soviets.

 In a significant departure from its heretofore notably restrained
 treatment of Chou En-tai, Moscow has rebuked the Chinese premier
 for his anti-Soviet stand and has suggested. that he is receptive
 to deals with the United States which others in Peking would
 oppose.  Also in anticipation of the President's visit to Peking,
 the Soviets have seized on the U.S. air strikes against the DRV
 as an occasion for warning Hanoi that its interests are menaced
 by Sino-U.S. developments.  In fact, Moscow's extensive polemical
 campaign keyed to the Indian-Pakistani conflict, featuring-
 charges of Sino-U.S. collusion and of Chinese betrayal of the
 national liberation movement, can be interpreted in large
 measure as intended for the benefit of Hanoi and other such
 targets of the Sino-Soviet rivalry.
 PEKING SEES REGROUPING OF FORCES IN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
 Peking's New Year's Day joint editorial provides 3 review of
 the world situation designed to justify moves toward enhancing
 the PRC's influence in the international community and its
 maneuverability vis-a-vis the superpowers.  Stressing the clashes
 of interests between the two superpowers as well as those
 dividing the latter from the "small and medium countries" and
 the third world countries being championed by Peking, the
 editorial sums up the world situation as being one of "global
 upheaval."  Similarly, a lengthy NCNA review on 30 December
 portraying growing opposition to dominance by the superpowers
 explained that political forces in the world arena are
 regrouping in a process of "great upheaval, great division,
 and great reorganization."
 The formulation regarding a great upheaval and regrouping of
 international forces was revived last August in the wake of
 Peking's announcement of its invitation to President N-xon.*
 This significant cue, which figured to a major policy statement
 in November 1965 signaling Peking's rejection of any accommodation
 with Moscow despite pressures within the communist movement to
 close ranks behind the Vietnamese comrades, serves to give notice
 of important policy developments such as the shifts .that produced
 the invitation to the President and Peking's flexible moves in
 the international community.  Likewise, the quotation from Mao
 *  The use of the formulation at that time is discussed in the
 TRENDS of 1 September 1971, pages 18-19.

 calling for consultation by all concerned in determining
 international affairs justifies Peking's recourse to the
 diplomatic and negotiating tracks in place of its former
 emphasis on obstructionist and insurrectionist approaches.
 "Gone are the days," the editorial observes, when the super-
 powers could decide the destinies of other countries by "making
 deals behind their backs."
 At a time of hostility toward Moscow and relative restraint
 toward Washington, the joint editorial directs its animosity
 mainly at the Soviets.  Most notably, where the 1971 New Year's
 editorial denounced "Nixon's reactionary rule" while soft-
 pedaling attacks on the Soviet leadership, the 1972 editorial
 does not mention the President but assails "the Brezhnev renegade
 clique" for oppressing its people and attempting-to extend its
 influence throughout the world.  The editorial charges that
 Moscow has colluded with the United States in "nuclear deals,"
 sold out the GDR on the Berlin question, threatened the Balkans,
 undermined the armed struggla of the Palestinians and Arabs,
 "and, above all, shamelessly end flagrantly supported the Indian
 reactionaries' armed aggression against Pakistan."
 Implicitly offering a rationale for negotiating with. the United
 States in order to cope with an expansive Soviet Union, the
 editorial points out that the "powers of aggression" of the
 United States have been "enormously weakened" in the Indochina
 war and that there has been a "profound change" in the balance
 of forces between the United States and its capitalist competitors.
 These judgments reflect Peking's optimistic reactions in the past
 year to developments in Indochina and in the political and
 economic relations among the capitalist countries.  Most
 recently, in reacting to the U.S. air strikes against the DRV,
 Peking went no further than necessary in condemning Washington
 while implying that the North Vietnamese and their.. allies in
 Indochina could handle the situation and that ongoing S.ino-U.S.
 developments were not in jeopardy.  Shortly after the series of
 concentrated U.S. air raids, Peking announced on 3 January that
 an American advance party arrived that day to prepare for
 President Nixon's visit the next month.  On the 4th Peking
 announced that Acting Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fei had held
 talks with the U.S. delegation.

 In contrast to the 1971 New Year's editorial, which contained
 but a brief ritualistic call for liberation of Taiwan, the
 editorial this year includes a passage reaffirming Peking's
 position on the Taiwan question.      The discussion is consistent
 with the major attention devoted to this issue in the past year
 and with Peking's diplomatic moves, reflecting concern over a
 possible tendency within the international community to accept
 the permanent alienation of Taiwan from the PRC.  Thus, the
 editorial refers to "our compatriots" on the island who are
 "our brothers by flesh and blood."  It reiterates opposition to
 formulas that would dilute Peking's claim to sovereignty over
 Taiwan--such as "one China, two governments"--and again demands
 the withdrawal of all U.S. armed forces.  But there is no
 attempt to convey a sense of urgency or threat, the editorial
 closing its discussion of Taiwan by expressing confidence that
 "the day is bound to come" when the island will be liberated.
 MOSCOW WARNS OF "MAJOR POLITICAL DEALS" BETWEEN PRC. U.S.
 Moscow's bitter polemical campaign against the Chinese arising
 out of the Indian-Pakistani confli,:t and Sino-Soviet clashes
 in the United Nations has been seeded with charges of collusion
 and bargaining between Peking and Washington.  The U.S. air
 strikes against the DRV in late December afforded Moscow further
 opportunity to develop this theme, accompanied by increasing
 references to President Nixon's Peking visit.  Moscow has also
 sought to exploit the Chinese leadership crisis in its effort
 to discredit Peking's policies in general and the President's
 visit next month in particular.
 A lengthy article by V. Vasilyev in RED STAR on 29 December, based
 mainly on foreign as well as Chinese press reports for an account
 of the Chinese leadership crisis, explains that this development
 reflects more than a mere power struggle but is rooted in
 fundamental disagreements over domestic and foreign policy.
 According to Vasilyev, the "Maoists" have had recourse to
 "shameless anti-Sovietism" in order to divert attention from
 the crisis and to gain time for consolidating their rule.
 Documenting Peking's anti-Soviet actions, Vasilyev mentions
 not only the polemics over the Indian-Pakistani conflict but
 also raises the sensitive border question by noting that a
 provocative Chinese film on the 1969 border clashes is now
 showing in Peking.  The film openly expresses territorial
 claims, Vasilyev points out.

 Significantly, it is against this background that Vasilyev
 ?             introduces the charge of Sino-U.S. collusion, citing the
 "world progressive forces" as having concluded that the Chinese
 position in the United Nations "confirms the possibility of
 major political deals between Peking and Washington at the
 expense of the interests of the peoples of diffe_ent parts of
 the world during Nixon's forthcoming visit to Peking."  Vasilyev
 himself concludes that the present course of "the great-power
 chauvinist Mao Tse-tung group," which is "hostile to Marxism-
 Leninism and hostile to socialism," is fraught with "serious
 consequences for the Chinese people themselves" and "conceals
 a threat to the interests of the peoples of other countries."
 As in other recent Soviet comment, Vasilyev takes note of the rise
 in the Chinese hierarchy of individuals distinguished by "particularly
 unbridled anti-Sovietism"--namely, Chiang Ching, Chang (hun-chiao,
 and "Mao's son-in-law Yao Wen-yuan."  Vasilyev cites the Western
 press as explaining that "the Chiang-Chang-Yao group" had reason
 to oppose the recently purged military leaders in view of the
 army's role in suppressing the Red Guards during the turmoil of
 tis cultural revolution.  Vasilyev remains vague, however, about
 what connection Lin Piao and the other purge victims might have
 with opposition to what he describes as Maoist policies
 contradicting "the objective requirements of China's development
 along the path of socialism and along the path of restucing friend-
 ship and international. ties with the USSR."
 Though Vasilyev does not repeat the personal attacks on Chou that
 have recently appeared in Soviet media, he alludes to Chou in
 an unfavorable context centering on the President's visit to
 Peking.  Vasilyev quotes the Washington POST as saying that it
 is possible for the United States to have dealings with the
 Chinese leaders "who have been educated in the traditions of
 the mandarins," and that support should be given to those
 leaders who are removing the party and military figures whose
 interests are undermined by the President's visit.  Again,
 Vasilyev fails to spell out Lin Piao's role in this scenario.
 In a notable attempt to fish in troubled waters, a 31 December
 article by V. Filippov in SOVIET RUSSIA cites a pamphlet
 entitled "Problems of Sino-American Relations" which allegedly
 appeared for only ?i few hours in Peking last September.  Basing
 himself on a summary of the pamphlet carried in a Japanese
 weekly, Filippov notes the pamphlet's claim that the announcement
 of the President's forthcoming visit to Peking provoked bitter

 issues, with Mao and Chou Htressi.ng that the Soviet Union poses
 a greater threat to China than the United States while
 unspecified "comrades who follow Marxist-Leninist theory"
 oppose this line as "a far-reaching rightwing deviation."
 In a remark that makes the pamphlet seem too good for Soviet
 purposes not to be false, Filippov quotes it no charging that
 Peking is "facilitating the implementation of American provocations
 against the DRV and of the policy of splitting Vietnam."
 Earlier, on 22 December, the pamphlet had been the subject of
 a broadcast to the Chinese by the purportedly unofficial Radio
 Peace and Progress, a channel especially suited for the more
 provocative Soviet meddling in other countries' affairs.  The
 broadcast version was notably more derisive toward Chou,
 attributing the invitation to the President to what it described
 as Chou's two-faced foreign policy.  According to the broadcast,
 the pamphlet Fays many people in China disapprove of Chou's
 pro-U.S. policy and regard the invitation to the President as
 a surrender to U.S. imperialism.
 In another difference between the two Soviet accounts of the
 pamphlet, Radio Peace and Progress quoted foreign observers as
 saying that Chou persuaded Mao to purge Lin, with whom Chou had
 a bitter dispute.  The broadcast also went on to cite unnamed
 foreign specialists on China as suggesting that Chou himself
 may become a future purge victim should Mao need a scapegoat
 for difficultieL resulting from the policy of Sino-U.S.
 rapprochement.

 SOVIET PROPAGANDA ON RHODESIA INCLUDES ANTI-PEKING BARBS
 Moscow sustains its largely one-sided polemic against Peking's
 policy regarding Rhodesia, while spokesmen for both communist
 powers condemn in similar fashion  he 24 November 1.971 Anglo-
 Rhodesian agreement.  In Lhe face of a steady diet of Soviet
 propaganda denunciations of the Anglo-Rhodesian accord and
 other "colonialist" phenomena in Africa, Peking has had little
 ammunition with which to counter the Soviet attacks on PRC
 policy in Africa.  A lengthy NCNA commentary on 31 December,
 for example, on the medium and small nations' united front
 against "the two superpowers," explicitly scored Soviet policy
 vis-a-via India and Pakistan and the 1968 intervention of
 Czechoslovakia, but attacked oily the alleged policies of
 Portugal and "the United States and its allies" on the African
 continent.
 Moscow has leveled its heaviest attacks against Peking's stance
 on Rhodesia via the purportedly unofficial Radio Peace and
 Progress in English to Africa.  Thus a typical commentary
 broadcast on 27 December, on the PRC's behavior as a newly
 elected member of the United Nations, observed that while
 "in its propaganda Peking is sparing no efforts" in its
 condemnation of "the racist and colonialist regimes in Africa,"
 it is actually "maintaining with them a most favorable trade,
 being thereby one of those who are thwarting the trade and
 economic blockade against the racists and colonialists as
 proclaimed by the Organization for African JTnity."  The
 broadcast went on to charge that "the Peking leaders are
 sabotaging the economic sanctions imposed against the
 Rhodesian racists" by purchasing large quantities of
 Rhodesian chrome ore.  It added that the Peking leaders are
 "hindering the alliance of the national liberation movement
 forces" by supporting the ZANU movement against ZAPU in
 Zimbabwe (Rhodesia).
 An 11 December broadcast by Radio Moscow in English to Africa,
 in which Observer Vasiliy Stepanov answered questions purportedly
 from listeners in Africa, similarly charged that the Peking
 leaders were trying to "split the national liberation movement"
 in Rhodesia, as well as in Angola, Mozambique, and South Africa.
 It added that, "in Rhodesia, China buys chrome."  These
 policies, it declared, were aimed at "turning Africa into a
 seat of Maoism."

 Both Moscow and Poking had issued authoritative condemnations of

 charge that the United States, in defiance of the will of the
 African countries in the United Nations, had "obdurately stuck
 to its position of importing chrome from Rhodesia."  Soviet

 PRC-JAPAN
 PEKING REITERATES ITS CLAIM TO SOVEREIGNTY OVER SENKAKUS
 Reacting to recent legislative action in the United States and
 Japan on the Okinawan reversion agreement, Peking has issued its
 most authoritative and detailed pronouncement to date on the
 Tiaoyu (Senkaku) island question.  A 30 December Foreign
 Ministry statement firmly declared that the Okinawan reversion
 agreement does not alter "the sovereignty of the PRC over her
 territory of the Tiaoyu and other islands."  No specific course
 of action was outlined, however, as the statement argued that
 since the disputed islands are "appertaining to Taiwan" their
 recovery is linked to the eventual recovery of Taiwan.  The
 statement did not demand settlement of the Ti'.aoyu island issue
 as a specific prerequisite for ameliorating relations between
 China and Japan.
 "Like Taiwan,' the statement declared, the Tiaoyu island group
 has 'been an inalienable part of Chinese territory since
 ancient times," and "it is utterly illegal for the U.S. and
 Japanese governments to include China's Tiaoyu and other
 islands in the so-called 'area of reversion' in the Okinawan
 'reversion' agreement."  Drawing a sharp distinction between
 the Japanese people and the Japanese Government, the statement
 specifically castigated the Sato Government for working in
 "collusion with U.S. imperialism" to reach an agreement on the
 "'reversion"' of Okinawa which includes '"the Tiaoyu and other
 islands in the 'area of reversion."'  Reiterating Peking's
 standard line on the Okinawan reversion agreement, the statement
 portrayed it as a "fraud . . . jointly contrived by the U.S.
 and Japanese governments . . . to strengthen U.S.-Japanese
 military collusion and to accelLrate the revival. of Japanese
 militarism."  It then asserted that the Chinese Government and
 people support "the Japanese people's valiant struggle to smash
 the fraud of the 'reversion' of Okinawa' and to oppose the
 attempt by the  U.S. and Japanese reactionaries" to -tse the
 agreement "to sow seeds of discord in the friendly re.Latione
 between the peoples of China and Japan."
 Following release of the Foreign Ministry statement, NCNA carried
 an article which went beyond the issues contained in the statement
 and aimed an additional volley at "Japanese reactionaiies" for
 working in "collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique" in an
 attempt--proposed in November 1970--to jointly develop  the oil
 resources of the seabed and subsoil of the seas around these
 islands" by "temporarily 'shelving' the dispute over the title to
 these islands."

 C H I N A
 JOINT EDITORIAL AT NEW YEAR SKIRTS LEADERSHIP ISSUE
 The New Year's Day editorial of PEOPLE'S DAILY, RED FLAG, and
 LIBERATION ARMY DAILY, while plainly reflecting the. recent
 leadership changes in China, sheds no new light on the reasons
 for the changes or their ultimate effect.  Recent media
 references to intrigue and conspiracy are given Mao's personal
 imprimatur via the instruction to "Practice Marxism and not
 revisionism; unite and don't split; be open and aboveboard,
 and don't intrigue and conspire."
 There is no indication-in the editorial that. the coming year
 will see any expansion of the recent purge.  Stressing. Mao's
 injunctions for unity around the center's line, the editorial
 states that the old principle of "curing the sickness to save
 the patient" must be applied to those who have fallen into
 error and unity can be reached with those "who have wrongly
 opposed us but are sincerely correcting their mistakes."  But
 the editorial does also reiterate Mao's October 1968 instruc-
 tion that in party building it is necessary to "get rid of
 the stale and take in the fresh."
 ROLE OF PLA     In line with recent practice,.the political.
 role of the PLA receives less attention.   The
 editorial emphasizes that the PLA must reform itself and
 "raise ics political and military qualities higher."  Lin
 Piao's "four good" standards for improving. army. units,. men-
 tioned in last year's editorial in this regard, have dropped
 out of PRC media.
 The most obvious sign of the PLA's changed status comes in a
 well-known Mao quote which has been revised since its inclusion
 in last year's editorial.  Last year Mao was said. to have
 enjoined:  "In industry learn from Taching; in agriculture
 learn from Tachai; the whole nation should learn from the PLA."
 The editorial this year adds a final phrase:  "the Liberation.
 Army should learn from the people of the whole country."
 Broadly intimating that army opposition to the new diplomatic
 line is a cause of the purge of PLA leaders, the editorial
 singles out "armymen and people" in enjoining study of "the

 international situation and the party's line and policies in
 foreign affairs" and defense against both "aggr'asion and
 subversion."*
 To greet the traditional "support the army and cherish the
 people" campaign, the State Council and the-CCP Military
 Commission issued a circular on 3 January, and this too
 reaffirms the army's less"npd status.  Like the joint editorial,
 the circular quotes Mao to the effect.that.the army must learn
 from the people; it also affirms that the PLA must.improve
 discipline and follow the party's guidance.
 Last year separate circulars for the PLA and- for civilians
 were issued by the State Council and. the PLA General Political
 Department.  The change this year to a single. circular. issued
 by the Government and a party organ seems designed to. stress.
 the PLA's subordination to state and party. .The circulars
 last year stressed the achievements of the.PLA and. its role
 as "mainstay of the dictatorship of the. proletariat.'.'  The
 phrase is repeated this year, but in thecontext.of several
 paragraphs on the importance of the masses and of the local
 cadres.
 PARTY     Perhaps in part because the issue. was thoroughly
 covered by the special joint editorial of_30 November,
 the current editorial devotes little attention. to. party. leader-
 ship, simply noting that the principle should be followed..
 More attention is devoted to informing.party members-that they
 must still learn from the masses and be concerned. for. their..
 well-being.  Unlike last year, there is no closing-slogan  .
 wishing long life to "the great, glorious and correct Communist
 Party of China."
 PRC CLAIMS RECORD HARVEST. TEN PERCENT INDUSTRIAL GAIN
 Both the joint editorial and a NCNA roundup on 31 December
 broke with the pattern established- of ter. the-.fiasco of . the.
 "leap forward" by providing concretefigures for grain, yields. and for outputs of some major industrial products.. Total.

 up about 10 percent over last year.  While the actual figures
 may be somewhat exaggerated, they are consistent with those
 for 1970 given Edgar Snow in his interview with Chou En-lai
 la't year.  Also, again without reference to magnitude, the
 Chinese have been selective in their economic claims-in recent
 years, choosing not to make claims in relation to preceding
 years unless in a direction actually reflected by yields.
 AGRICULTURE     China's grain output was said.to be 246 million
 tons this year; this compares with.the."over
 240 million" figure cited by Chou En-lai for the 1970 harvest.
 This year's record was said to have been. achieved.despi.te the
 obstacle of natural disasters three times. as..great-as.last
 year.  Much credit is given to irrigation projects and advances
 in mechanization and in supplies of fertilizers.
 From figures given in the NCNA account and by Chou.En-lai-it
 appears that the gains in fertilizer production were almost
 exclusively in output from small local plants, whose.product is
 of relatively lower quality.  These plants. are. now. said. to
 account for 60 percent of China's supply,.indicating.a.rise -
 in local production for the year of about.two-thirds over 1970.
 Besides claiming that China is now "self-sufficient in. grain
 and has a surplus," the NCNA report notes that output of some..
 industrial crops, whose cultivation has increasingly. been urged-
 by propagandists, was stepped up this year.  Some crops.for.  .
 which increases were not claimed are apparently being.-encouraged
 by new pricing policies.  The report'states that state purchase.
 prices for sugar cane and beets, oil-bearing crops, and bast-
 fiber crops have been raised.
 INDUSTRY     Industrial production seems generally to have risen
 more in fields given special-emphasis-in the
 media over the past year.   Thus mining.machinery,.which has
 been the focus of numerous articles stressing that steel.  .
 cannot be made without ore, showed a gain of. nearly 70 percent,
 the largest percentage gain given.  Iron ore output increased
 by 26 percent.
 Although excessive concentration on metallurgical equipment has
 been a charge aimed at the Liuist "swindlers," production. of -
 metallurgical equipment is said to be up nearly-one-quarter.
 Total steel output is said to have reached 21-million-tons;
 Chou had indicated that the 1970 figure was around 18.million,
 but he told Snow that "a rapid increase is expected this year."

 HUNAN HOLDS SECOND PARTY PLENUM. FIRST PROVINCE TO DO SO
 On 26 December, the Changsha radio reported on Hunan's second
 provincial party plenum, held from 13 to 20 December--about one
 year plus two weeks following the first plenum.  This could be
 an indication of a pattern of anniversary plenums to be followed
 by other provinces, but it is also possible that Hunan, as Mao's
 native province, will stand alone in holding a plenum amidst
 the unsolved leadership problems at the center.
 A total of 79 members and alternates attended the plenum, against
 the 90 named to the new committee a.year ago; but some may have
 absented themselves because of illness. or other duties.  The.
 December 1970 announcement of the committee's formation did not
 state that all members were l.:esent; and, to cite one known
 example, Hsieh Fu-chih failed to attend the congress and plenum
 that confirmed his election as Peking first secretary.
 Hunan has probably fared better than most provinces in the
 upheavals this fall.  Its first secretary Hua Kuo-feng.has
 been promoted to a post in Peking, the only provincial chief
 who has so far risen in the aftermath of Lin's.downfall.  The
 secretary and deputy secretary, respectively commissar-and
 commander of the military district, both attended the plenum.
 The plenum apparently discussed political and economic tasks,
 stressing party leadership over all areas.  Although-Lin-was
 not mentioned by the plenum report, a speech by deputy secretary
 Yang Ta-i on party leadership and Mao.'s line and a.discussion.
 of 10 measures on "repudiation of revisionism and rectification
 of work style" were probably concerned with Lin's fate. The
 conference also discussed  P. 10-year plan..for industrialization
 and agricultural mechanization.  Other provinces-have also
 recently referred to 10-year plans, and it maybe that.provincial
 planning generally is to proceed on a 10-year basis.

 MIDDLE EAST
 MOSCOW SEES U.S. PHANTOM DECISION AS THREATENING PEACE
 Moscow responds in predictable fashion to President Nixon's
 statement, in his 2 January CBS interview, that the United States
 has made a "commitment in principle" to sell additional jet
 aircraft to Israel.  TASS in reporting the interview on the 3d
 typifies Soviet reaction in declaring that the decision shows
 that the United States continues to aid the "aggressor" and
 thus creates obstacles to a political settlement.  Moscow radio's
 Cairo correspondent Kudryavtsev, in an Arabic-language broadcast
 on the 4th, says Cairo observers point out that President Nixon
 announced the decision at the time Jatring's mission was to be
 resumed.  Kudryavtsev asserts that U.S. media have been trying to
 portray the decision as a quid pro quo for Mrs. Meir's undertaking,
 in her meeting with the President, to make concessions, bv* that
 this has been denied by an Israeli spokesman.
 A Potemkin article in PRAVDA on the 3d and one by Nikanorov in
 IZVESTIYA on the 4th claim the U.S. decision disproves Washington's
 assertions of lack of bias in the Middle East and ends U.S.
 attempts to play the role of an impartial mediator.  Potemkin
 sees the discarding of the "farcical unofficial embargo" on the
 sale of Phantoms to Israel as evidence of the tremendous influence
 of Zionist circles on the U.S. Government, and Nikanorov
 similarly calls the decision the result of Zionist pressure
 "capable of influencing the outcome of the presidential election."
 Moscow had promptly noted, in a 31 December Arabic-language
 broadcast, reports by U.S. media that day that the United States
 had decided to resume the sale of Phantoms to Israel, but at
 first gave the development little further publicity other than
 to report Cairo press "indignation."  TASS on 1 January cited
 a statement by an unidentified Egyptian "informed source"--also
 quoted by the MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY--that such reports are
 considered as encouraging Israel's expansionist policy and
 aggravating the Middle East crisis.  The Egyptian official
 spokesman's statement, reported by MENA on the 4th, is
 briefly cited by TASS the following day as declaring that
 the U.S. decision to supply more Phantoms to Israel is a
 challenge to world public opinion, creating a still more
 dangerous situation in the area.

 An Arabic-language commentary on the 3d pegged to the U.S.
 decision approvingly cited Arab press comment advocating
 "decisive measures" against imperialist interests in the Arab
 world.  A Primakov article in the 5 January PRAVDA, as reported
 by TAS-: routinely assails U.S. assistance to Israel without
 mentioning the Phantom issue.  Primakov remarks that "objective
 observers" draw the conclusion that the United States, while
 supporting Israel's "aggressive policy," fears for its positions
 in the Arab countries "where its principal economic interests
 in the Middle East are concentrated,"
 PRIMAKOV URGES POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IN YEAR-END REVIEW
 Former PRAVDA Middle East specialist Yevgeniy Primakov, rc-:
 deputy director of the USSR Academy of Sciences' Institute of
 World  Economy and International Relations, again underscored
 Soviet support for a political settlement in a year-end radio
 series touching on various aspects of the Middle East situation.
 And in a 5 January PRAVDA article, Primakov again presses Moscow's
 proposals for a political settlement, as he had done in a Moscow
 domest'c service commentators' roundtable on 19 December, and
 expresses the belief that many conditions are available for
 normalizing the Middle East situation.
 Primakov's series of four talks, broadcast in the Arabic service
 27-30 December, employs some of the same arguments and touches
 on some of the same themes as the series of talks by Maksimov
 broadcast in Arabic in November.*  In his first installment,
 Primakov dealt with the military balance in the Middle East,
 stressing that there is a "tendency" toward an equilibrium
 but that the process of achieving a balance of military power
 between the Arabs and Israel "is long and complex."  As an
 example of Egypt's improved military position, Primakov--like
 Maksimov in November--cited the September downing of an
 Egyptian aircraft by Israel, the downing of an Israeli plane
 in return, and Israeli retaliatory action in firing Shrike air-
 to-ground missiles at Arab positions "for the first time" with
 "mediocre results."  (Maksimov said the Shrike salvo "caused
 no harm or losses to the Egyptian forces.")  Primakov assured
 his listeners that the trend toward military equilibrium "is
 developing," and declared that the Soviet Union furnishes "the

 appropriate conditions" for strengthening Arab military power.
 He recalled the Soviet declaration, in the joint communique on
 Egyptian President as-Sadat's October visit to Moscow, that the
 USSR would continue to render "whatever is necessary to strengthen
 the military power" of Egypt.
 While Primakov asserted that these Soviet measures "are continuing,"
 he left the impression that the military negotiations might not
 have been entirely smooth.  He juxtaposed to his remark on the
 "continuing" measures the observation that Soviet-Arab relations
 "as a whole" developed successfully, but immediately conceded
 that 1971 "was very complicated from this aspect as well."  He
 explained that events in certain Arab countries, such as the
 "anticommunist hysteria" in Sudan, were exploited by imperialist
 propaganda in an effort to foster Soviet-Arab differences.
 Recalling that Ponomarev was visiting Egypt during the anti-
 communist campaign in Sudan, Primakov said "the wisdom of the
 Egyptian statesmen prevailed" in that the communique on Ponomarev's
 visit condemned hostility toward communism, as did the later
 communique on as-Sadat's Moscow visit.
 In the context of further attempts to exploit "differences of.
 opinion" between certain Arab countries and the USSR, Primakov
 in his second talk implicitly responded to Arab criticism--most
 vociferously from Libya--of the Soviet position on the Indian-
 Pakietani conflict.  He rejected the "inadmissible" contention
 that the Arabs should support Pakistan in all its actions because
 it is a Moslem country, and argued that the Islamic label in
 itself does not make a movement or a country good or bad.  In
 his third talk Primakov gave the standard propaganda assessment
 of Washington's "so-called good offices" in efforts for an
 interim settlement along with a routine picture of Israel's
 "growing international isolation."
 Primakov's concluding talk emphasized a Middle East political
 settlement, mentioned 10 times in four paragraphs.  Like Makismov,
 who had declared that support for a political settlement did not
 mean peace at any price, Primakov explained that such a solution
 does not mean searching for "peace in any way possible."
 Rather, the Soviet Union, he said, equates a political
 settlement with the struggle to eliminate the consequences
 of "Israeli aggression."  Also like Maksimov, Primakov
 insisted that there is no contradiction between seeking a
 political solution and assisting the Arabs in consolidating
 their "defense capability" since the stronger the Arabs become
 militarily, the more rapidly a political settlement will be
 achieved.

 Primakov also touched on the importance of recognition of the
 ralestinians' legitimate rights in any settlement.  He observed
 that the Palestinian movement has been weakened militarily as
 a result of attacks by extreme rightist elements which exploited
 "leftist actions by some Palestinian groups."       But he noted that
 every liberation movement has its ups and downs, and asserted
 that the Palestinian movement must still be taken into account,
 particularly in light of the support it receives from the Arab
 people "and the Soviet Union."
 But while pledging unspecified Soviet support to the Arab
 Palestinians, Primakov typically offered no suggestions for
 solving the Palestinian problem and indeed immediately went on
 to reiterate, in effect, Israel's right to exist:  The Soviet
 Union, he said, "wants all countries in this area to be assured
 of survival and secure boundaries for these countries maintained."
 Otherwise, he concluded, a situation might arise which could again
 activate "imperialist forces" and jeopardize Arab revolutionary
 achievements and progressive changes.
 SOVIET         Primakov in the broadcast series did not take the
 PROPOSALS      occasion to mention the Soviet proposals for a
 Middle East settlement, but in a 5 January PRAVDA
 article he does bring up the subject.  The proposals are not
 known to have been detailed in Soviet propaganda since Primakov
 outlined them in a 15 October 1970 PRAVDA article.
 Affirming that the USSR stands for a political settlement,
 Primakov analyzes "specific features" of the Soviet measures
 in his PRAVDA article, listing first the need for Israeli with-
 drawal from all occupied Arab territories along with simultaneous
 termination of the state of war and establishment of peace
 between Israel and the Arab states.  Primakov observes that it
 is "evidently necessary" to call attention to the fact that
 only the borders established for Israel by the United Nations
 in 1947 have a basis in international law. In the roundtable
 discussion on 19 December, Primakov had noted that the Soviet
 proposals aim at insuring the existence of "generally recognized
 frontiers" in the area, and Israel could find security in this
 recognition of "existing frontiers."  In PRAVDA, he declares that
 ?             the Soviet plan is a "well-considered system of measures to
 provide guarantees for the security of the borders of all
 countries" in the region, including guarantees by "a number of
 great powers" or the UN Security Council or both.

 Primakov advises the Arabs that a "major prerequisite" for a
 successful struggle is the solidarity and unity of the Arab
 countries themselves on an anti-imperialist basis, and
 cautions them that imperialism is "trying to capitalize on
 differences between Arab countries in their approach to the
 solution of individual problems."
 Expressing the opinion that many conditions are available for
 normalizing the situation, Primakov points to Resolution 242
 as a basis for a political settlement and says the resolution
 could be implemented now.  He recalls Israel's failure to give
 "an official reply" to Ambassador Jarring's 8 February 1971
 memorandum, but does not, according to the TASS review, call
 for a positive Israeli reply now--a condition set by Egyptian
 President as-Sadat in his 11 November speech to the People's
 Assembly.

 YUGOSLAVIA
 FOREIGN CURRENCY ISSUE RESOLVED, TITO CRACKDOWN CONTINUES
 Federal and republic authorities, at Tito's insistence, have
 agreed to a compromise solution of the controversial foreign
 currency problem--the issue that triggered the 10-day November-
 December strike by Croatian students and was seized upon by
 Tito as an opportunity for a showdown with the Croatian leaders.
 At the same time, the Yugoslav Pres'dent has sustained his
 pressure on nationalist and other dissident elements throughout
 the country.  A League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY)
 Presidium document on the tasks of the party, published in the
 30 December BORBA in preparation for the second League confer-
 ence,  calls for a continuing struggle against the class enemy
 and warns that there will be no democracy for those who try
 to undermine the system.  According to TANJUG, the Zagreb city
 committee of the League of Communists met on the 30th and
 decided on a thorough housecleaning of all "champions of
 nationalist ideology" in all conference organizations and
 "particularly of some university professors."
 Meanwhile, the media continue to carry isolated reports of
 Croatian unrest and arrests of Croatian citizens for "nationalist
 excesses."  Demonstrating that the Yugoslav authorities' crackdown
 on nationalist elements extends to other republics as well,
 TANJUG reported on the 30th that the Serbian security police
 had arrested Slobodan Subotic, the chairman of both the Serbian
 and Yugoslov bar associations, for "hostile activity against the
 state."  Subotic, and an unemployed engineer and five other
 unidentified persons arrested with him, were charged specifically
 with writing, printing, and distributing nationalist, anti-
 communist propaganda.
 REFORM OF             Following Tito's 18 December demand for a
 FOREIGN EXCHANGE      rapid solution to the foreign exchange
 problem--long a cause of discontent in
 Croatia--the Federal and republican authorities reached an
 agreement on the controversial question, TANJUG reported on the
 29th.  According to the agreement, Croatia and the other
 republics will be allowed to keep more of their foreign currency
 earnings.  Where in the past exporters were allowed to keep only
 7 percent of these funds, the reform allows them to keep 20 per-
 cent.                       It also provides for an increase from 40 to 45 percent
 for foreign exchange earnings from tourism.

 In an apparent effort to sell the reform to the Croatians,
 the Zagreb daily VJESNIK on 1 January carried a lengthy
 interview with Ratko Karlovic, a member of the Council of
 the Croatian Assembly, in which he hailed the agreement
 as a victory for commonsense rather than a triumph of any

 Presidium document entitled "The Development
 and Current Tasks of the LCY" published in BORBA the next day.
 According to TANJUG, the document is designed to serve as a
 basis for public debate in preparation for the second LCY
 conference scheduled for 25-26 January, ,hich will take up
 the problem of the League's reorganization.  Judging by the
 content of the document, TANJUG commented on the 29th, "a
 further sharpening can be expected in the open clash between
 the LCY and those trends which put obstacl?ai in the way of
 reinforcing the decisive role of the working class."
 Describing the present situation as one of "deepening ferment"
 in many sectors of Yugoslav life, the document warns against
 efforts of "nationalist and other opponents" to challenge  the
 class basis of the Yugoslav revoluticaary movement and calls
 for a strengthened party to deal with them.  It pointedly
 adds that there will be no democracy foY those who seek to
 undermine the Yugoslav social system.  Attempting to maintain
 a middle position between nationalists and unitarists, who
 prefer strong central rule, the document goes on to voice
 opposition to any concept that would lead to a loose coalition
 of republican organizations or to any restoration of "centralistic,
 supra-republican organization."  Although the document professes
 to envisage more autonomy for republic parties in the planned
 reorganization, it emphasizes that the principle of democratic
 centralism must be observed "from tot- to bottom" and underlines
 that the prime goal of the League reorganization must be to
 strengthen the party's role in political and social life
 throughout the country.

 NEW INCIDENTS     Although the compromise solution on the foreign
 IN CROATIA              currency issue may assuage Croatian grievances
 and bolster the new Croatian party leadership,
 the problem of republic nationalism and the new animosities
 generated between the Croats and the Belgrade center by Tito's
 intervention in Croatian affairs will continue to pose difficulties.
 The Yugoslav authorities' concern over this problem seemed
 inflected in press reports on 28 and 29 December that the ousted
 leaders--Dabcevic-Kucar, Tripalo, and Pirker--had requested that
 tite Zagreb daily VJESNIK publish their statemints dissociating
 themselves from "some individuals and small groups" who are using
 their names and who support "hostile positions."  According to
 TANJUG reports on 13 and 14 December on student protests in
 the wake of the ouster of the Croatian leaders, the demonstrators had
 shouted slogans expressing support for Dabcevic-Kucar and Tripalo.
 Although there have been no new reports of such manifestations,
 Zagreb's VJESNIK reported on 3 January that seven youths were
 sent to prison for 60 days for singing nationalist songs.  The
 same paper also reported that four person,3 in Bosanka Krupa were
 given similar sentences for "nationalist and chauvinist excesses
 and insults to the highest organs of authority of the Federal
 Republic of Yugoslavia."
 According to a TANJUG report on 5 January, a mail room employee
 in BORBA's Zagreb printing plant was killed by an exploding parcel
 which the police assumed contained a time bomb.  TANJUG on
 the 1st had reported that Yugoslav customs officers on the
 Yugoslav-Greek border apprehended two persons attempting to
 smuggle mines into the country.

 USSR  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 BELATED PUBLICATION OF STALIN-ERA HISTORY ANNOUNCED
 PRAVDA on 29 December announces the publication of the long-awaited
 Book 2, Volume 4 in the official multivolume "History of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union."  This work deals with the
 most sordid period of Stalin's regime, the 1929-37 era of the
 collectivization of agriculture, the assassination of Kirov, and
 the launching of the great terror.  Publication was suspended in
 late 1970, presumably because of unresolved differences in the
 leadership over the Stalin issue or concern over the book's
 potentially disruptive impact on public opinion, and another,
 later book in the series was released in January 1971, covering
 the 1938-45 period.*
 The new work will provide the most up-to-date and comprehensive
 assessment of Stalin by Khrushchev's successors.  However, in
 view of Brezhnev's statement at the 24th CPSU Congress that
 the "problems" connected with the Stalin cult have "irrevocably
 receded into the past," it seems likely that the new work will
 not depart markedly from those historical assessments of recent
 years which have uniformly extolled the virtues of the `heroic"
 past while muting criticism of Stalin's "mistakes."
 For background, see the TRENDS for 3 February 1971, pages 38-39.
