 LIN PIAO AND THE STRUCTURE OF POWER
 MEMORANDUM TO RECIPIENTS:
 The frail and enigmatic Lin Piao has seemed to
 many observers a strange choice as the designated heir
 to Mao Tse-tung.  Many believe that he cannot long
 survive Mao.   The message of this research study is
 that in view of Lin's apparent organizational strength,
 his potential for holding power should not be dismissed
 lightly.
 It should be noted that this study concentrates
 on one factor only in the succession:  Lin's position
 in the structure of power.  It considers Lin's rela-
 tionships with both his proteges and his peers, and the
 implications of these for Lin's policies.   Identifying
 those who might reasonably be regarded as Lin's proteges,
 the study traces the striking degree to which military
 leaders purged in the Cultural Revolution have been
 replaced with these apparent proteges of Lin's -- who
 now dominate the military establishment, the most
 important part of the existing structure of power.   It
 also traces the lines on which Lin seems to be moving
 to achieve a similar domination over the emerging Party
 structure.  The paper concludes that Lin's heavy reli-
 ance on military proteges, and his preference for one
 type of civilian leader over another, will both tend
 to deter him from pursuing Maoist policies to the ex-
 tremes to which Mao has pursued them.
 The study's methodology approaches with care the
 question of what constitutes a protege and whether such
 a relationship necessarily translates into effective
 political power.   Additionally, the study recognizes that
 many factors other than organizational structure will
 come into play in determining succession leaders and
 policies after Mao.

 This Staff has received constructive comment from
 the Office of National Estimates and from the Office
 of Current Intelligence.   This paper does not, however,
 present a coordinated view of Lin's position and prospects.
 The judgments expressed in the study are solely those
 of its author                     and of this Staff.                 25X1

 LIN PIAO AND THE STRUCTURE OF POWER
 Summary
 Lin Piao has been completely loyal to Mao.   Yet
 as Mao's designated successor, he has had to look to-
 ward the day when he must work without Mao.  With Mao's
 acquiescence, he has indeed been making preparations
 for that day.
 Throughout the Cultural Revolution, the real
 base of power for both Mao and Lin has been the armed
 forces (PLA).   Lin has not hesitated to purge PLA
 leaders -- including his own proteges -- who dis-
 pleased Mao or who, in Lin's judgment, did not meet
 Mao's standards.   Yet in the process of making the
 PLA reliable both for Mao and for himself, he has been
 able to install many more of his proteges in key posi-
 tions in the military structure than have been lost in
 the purges.   Lin now overwhelmingly dominates -- through
 his proteges -- the central military leadership in
 Peking and the Military Region headquarters.  Thus he
 dominates the power-system which protects the central
 leaders and carries out their orders, which super-
 vises many central ministries and is the strongest force
 in local governing bodies, and which constitutes the
 main coercive instrument throughout China.
 Lin is to be the leader as well of a Communist
 Party, shattered in the Cultural Revolution but now
 being reconstructed.   Lin has a long way to go, before
 he can dominate the Party apparatus in the way that he
 now dominates the military structure.   His relations
 with the other four members of the Politburo standing
 committee, the top policy-making body, are uneven.   He
 seems still to have the complete confidence of Mao,
 and is unlikely to forfeit it.   And his relations with
 Chou En-lai seen very good.   But they seem less good

 with the other two, Chen Po-ta (Mao's writer and trouble-
 shooter) and Kang Sheng (Mao's policeman).  The known
 officers of the Cultural Revolution Group, said to be
 the Party's de facto secretariat, are Chen and Kang and
 some others close to those two, not to Lin. That same
 group has reportedly had the largest responsibilities
 in reconstructing the rest of the Party apparatus, in
 Peking and in the provinces.
 But Lin knows which components of the emerging
 Party apparatus are important, and he seems to be tak-
 ing steps analogous to those he took in progressively
 dominating the PLA.   It is possible that the composition
 of the Politburo standing committee is already changing
 (Chen is missing), and, if so, Lin's protege Huang
 Yung-sheng, the second-ranking military leader, is a
 likely candidate.   Beyond this possibility, Mao has
 reportedly given Lin the job of supervising the de facto
 secretariat in its rebuilding of the Party, and Lin is
 probably adding some of his proteges to that body.
 His proteges are expected to appear also in the upper
 levels of the great Party apparatus subordinate to the
 secretariat, and proteges of his proteges at lower
 levels.   Still other proteges of Lin's are expected to
 head many of the new Party committees in the provinces,
 particularly those provinces which contain the power-
 ful Military Region headquarters.
 Lin's prospects for holding power, if his health
 holds, seem fairly good.   He will have Mao's clear
 mandate, his own impressive record in the Cultural Re-
 volution (in which he successfully purged the PLA at
 the same time that he was successfully using it as the
 main instrument of the Revolution), and what seem to
 be formidable organizational assets and unequalled
 opportunities to increase them.
 The chances seem good that Lin and Chou En-lai
 will continue to hang together, both before and after
 Mao's death. There seems only an outside chance that
 Lin will come to see Chou as a dangerous rival.   Lin
 will probably work well too with most of the military
 leaders, who have reason to be loyal to him.   If Lin

 SECRET
 were to make extreme demands on these military leaders
 and threaten or try to carry out another great purge,
 he might well be overthrown in a coup; but Lin seems
 to have no intention of putting the PLA through all
 this again.
 Lin's apparent preference for Chou En-lai and
 Lin's military comrades, over the civilian radicals
 of the de facto secretariat, may have implications for
 Lin's policies as the successor.   It may mean that
 Lin's predispositions are not as radical and militant
 as Mao's are.  This would not mean the abandonment of
 abiding features of Maoism in practice -- the emphasis
 on loyalty to the leader personally, on the heavy
 responsibility of cadres, on the importance of poli-
 tical indoctrination and moral incentive, and on the
 need for great national campaigns pressing hard on
 the populace.   But it might well mean a willingness
 to continue on these lines without reaching the extremes
 that Mao has reached.   Those leaders whom Lin seems
 to like best -- Chou and the military -- are expected
 to influence him in the moderate direction, the more
 easily if his predispositions are indeed less extreme
 than Mao's.

 Introductory Note;  The Concept of "Proteges"
 The term "protege" is used frequently in this
 paper.   It designates, even more in Chinese than in
 Western society, a man whose career has seemed strik-
 ingly related to that of a more powerful figure -- with
 whom he apparently identifies, and by whom he is ad-
 vanced and protected.  Chinese Communist leaders, as
 other Chinese before them -- the officers of the Party,
 and directors of the Party apparatus and of the state
 machinery, the chiefu of the military esta,lishment,
 the most powerful regional figures -- have all seemed
 to have such proteges.  These proteges have risen and
 often fallen with their mentors, have sometimes col-
 lapsed under the demands made upon them, and have some-
 times deserted or challenged them.
 The careers of most of the past and present lead-
 ers of Communist China are fairly well known.  There
 are voluminous records on many of them.   It is usually
 possible to discover whether a given leader -- say,
 one of the officers of the powerful Military Affairs
 Committee or the General Staff, or one of the top-rank-
 ing officers of a Military Region headquarters -- served
 and prospered under Lin in Lin's early career.   (Lin's
 main assignments,  in ascending order, were as a divi-
 sion and army commander, as Mao's assistant in special
 jobs in Yenan, as the commander of Chinese Communist
 forces in the Northeast after World War 11, and as com-
 mander of the 4th Field Army in the Central-South in
 the late 1940s and early 1950s -- and concurrently Party
 leader in that area -- until illness forced his with-
 drawal in the early 1950s.)  And it is almost always
 possible to discover which of those men were then chosen
 by Lin for key posts in the centr_.l and regional mili-
 tary structure after he became Minister of National
 Defense and head of the Military Affairs Committee in
 1959.   A Chinese military officer whose record showed
 both of those features as of 1965 -- substantial early

 association with Lin, and later preferment by him --
 might reasonably be regarded as an apparent or likely
 protege at that time. Many of these men were then
 given additional signs of special favor during the
 Cultural Revolution -- for example, were taken into
 Lints confidence iii the first stages; were not punished
 for their "mistakes" in handling mass organizations
 (whereas less favored men were often demoted and some-
 times purged); were given especially sensitive assign-
 ments such as the conduct of the purge in the PLA it-
 self and the supervision of political security work
 thereafter, or the command of forces moved into troubled
 provinces; were installed as the commanders and poli-
 tical officers of military regions and districts, and
 as the heads of local governments, to replace purged
 leaders; and so on.   Such men the study considers fully-
 established proteges.
 There are only a few dozen Chinese leaders
 -- almost all of them military men, divided about
 equally between Peking and the military regions --
 out of several hundred examined who qualify as pro-
 teges in this full sense of early, middle and late
 association.   But these tend to occupy the most im-
 portant positions in the military structure.
 This concept of "protege" is of course open to
 some objection, on the ground that such bonds -- even
 where the record of association and preferment is in-
 disputable -- are too fragile to support a projection.
 One may point to proteges of long standing who have
 challenged their principals: for example, Peng Te-huai
 in 1959, or Liu Shao-chi more recently.  Peng, the
 military leader who openly criticized Mao's plans for
 military and economic development and his attitude
 toward the Russians, and Liu, who covertly but systematic-
 ally obstructed Mao in the early 19609, both had unques-
 tionably been proteges of Mao before questions of high
 policy led them to become "disloyal."  One can point
 to other instances in which a protege has attached him-
 self to a new principal out of opportunism, or has
 come to hate his benefactor for no apparent reason.

 SECRET
 And from the principal's point of view, there are many
 proteges who fail to measure up, and are abandoned by
 their principals.   Lin's proteges in the General Poli-
 tical Department were given special assignments one
 after another in the early stages of the Cultural
 Revolution and were then purged one after another for
 failure -- failures which were sometimes seen as "dis-
 loyalty. "
 But such bonds do not in general seem fragile.
 Peng Te-huai and Liu Shao-chi had served Mao well and
 faithfully for many years, carrying out policies which
 were often disagreeable to them, and helping Mao to
 conceal his mistakes and to minimize the ill effects
 of them.  They turned against him only when his policies
 seemed so extreme as to pose a question virtually of
 national survival.   Similarly, Join's proteges -- most
 of those who fell, as well as these who prospered --
 tried hard for him in the Cultural Revolution, doing
 their best to carry out opaque or conflicting directives,
 standing firm while the great purge was going on around
 them and even when they themselves seemed threatened;
 rather than combining forces against him, they in general
 conducted themselves as loyal lieutenants and reliable
 instruments.   Those few of Li.n's proteges who were purged
 in the Cultural Revolution -- four or five in the highly
 hazardous General Political Department, and four or
 five more outside it -- seem in general to have been
 men placed in an impossible position.   That is, the
 demands made on them were so extreme that they could
 not personally survive.   Thus, a protege will occasion-
 ally challenge or desert his principal out of conviction
 or to advance or save himself, or he may be crushed by
 an extreme demand, but a protege is likely to adhere
 longer and to endure larger demands than a non-protege.
 The Chinese Communists themselves seem pretty
 clearly to take the concept of "protege" seriously.
 When Peng Te-huai fell, several of his proteges fell
 with him.  When Liu and Teng fall, the proteges with
 whom they had packed the Party apparatus were almost
 all swept out with them.   Many of the proteges of

 SECRET
 military leaders purged in the first stages of the
 Cultural Revolution were later purged expressly as
 "their" men.   And it does not seem coincidental that
 so many of L?in's proteges have risen dramatically on
 the Cultural Revolution, while so few have fallen.
 In sum, while it is not possible in any given
 case to be certain that a principal-protege relation-
 ship is stable, Lin's ability to appoint his proteges
 to key positions testifies to his strength in the
 leadership, and his strength tends to be increased by
 the men he appoints.  This is of course not the only
 consideration governing Lin's overall strength and
 his prospects for holding power after Mao goes; ques-
 tions of policy are likely to be more important.  But
 the character of Lin's proteges seems to be one import-
 ant factor in questions of policy too, because prin-
 cipals and proteges are mutually dependent; if, as
 this paper will argue, Lin's proteges tend to be men
 of a certain kind, their influence on his policies is
 likely to he exercised in one direction rather than
 another.

 1.  Lin and the Cultural Revolution
 The original objective of the Great Proletarian
 Cultural Revolution was to make the structure of power
 reliably responsive to Mao Tse-tung -- which it had not
 been for some years.  Lin Piao, completely identified
 with Mao, had already been secretly chosen by Mao as
 his successor.   It was thus Lin's problem, in the Cul-
 tural Revolution, to make the new structure of power
 reliably responsive to himself as well -- looking toward
 the day when he, without Mao, would have to use it to
 direct the activity of 800 million people.
 The Party Apparatus:    The Chinese Communist
 Party was, o  course, the primary instrument of com-
 mand-and-control throughout China, and, as such, the
 principal casualty of the great purge which was central
 to the Cultural Revolution.    When the Revolution began,
 Lin's position in the Party was not strong.  He was one
 of several vice-chairmen (not the senior one) of the
 central committee, and thereby a member of the politburo
 standing committee, the summit of power; but the great
 apparatus of the Party below the politburo level was
 directed by two other members of the standing committee,
 Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping, the two leaders of
 those  resisting Mao's will.  Teng as secretary-general
 dominated the party secretariat, charged with managing
 the daily activity of the party.  The rest of the
 apparatus -- the central departments concerned with all
 aspects of Chinese life, the powerful regional bureaus

 and provincial committees (the first secretaries of
 which were often the political officers of the PLA
 commands in those areas), and the network of Party
 committees in government organs and the military es-
 ta blishment -- was stocked largely with proteges of
 Liu and Teng.  Apart from some of the Party committees
 in the PLA, the Party apparatus contained very few
 proteges of Lin Piao.
 The PLA:    The PLA was in better shape, from
 the point' of-view of Mao and Lin, than was the party
 apparatus.  Mao and Lin had been industriously indoc-
 trinating it -- and on a small scale, purging it --
 from the t i.me of Lin's assumption of command of the
 PLA in 1959, and Mao had in fact transferred his own
 true base of power from the Party to the PLA in the
 years before the Cultural Revolution began.  It was
 Mao's intention to use the PLA as his reserve force
 while he prepared to purge the Party.
 Lin had been the dominant figure in the PLA since
 1959, as de facto chief of the Military Affairs Committee
 which directed the entire military establishment and
 as Minister of National Defense, and he had installed
 some of his proteges in key positions.  Neither the
 central nor the regional leadership of the PLA, however,
 was dominated by Lints proteges at the outset of the
 Cultural Revolution in 1965, and Mao and Lin did not
 regard the PLA as fully reliable.  Many of its ranking
 political officers (regional and district) were pri-
 marily functionaries of the disloyal Party machine
 (rather than career PLA men), and much of the indoctri-
 nation of the PIA had-been carried out by these men.
 From the start, it was the intention of Mao and Lin to
 make the PLA the secondary target of the great purge.

 Mao and Lin had concluded that one of their
 Joint proteges, Chief-of-Staff Lo Jui-thing -- con-
 currently secretary-general of the MAC and probably
 the principal supervisor of political security work
 in the PLA -- was disloyal.  They were also suspicious
 of certain other central military leaders, of senior
 officers of the powerful regional military headquarters
 whom they believed to be closer to Party-machine
 leaders than to themselves, and of the entire political
 officer network responsive to the Party secretariat.
 It seems, however, that when the Cultural Revolution
 began, comparatively few career PLA leaders (as
 distinct from Party leaders) were already marked for
 purging; most of those who finally fell appear to have
 been purged for resistance to features of the Cultural
 Revolution as it developed, for inability to meet the
 sometimes impossible demands made of them, and for
 being proteges of military leaders who fell in the
 first stages.
 Lin as Mao's Confidante:    Throughout the Cul-
 tural Revolution, Lin has   en Mao's principal
 confidante.  Late in 1965, the PLA newspaper took the
 lead in making an anti-Mao play the symbol of all
 opposition to Mao and thus the touchstone of loyalty.
 Lin then went into retreat with Mao to plan the cam-
 paign.   In early 1966, Lin wrote and spoke on the need
 for an ideological revolution.  He then made the key
 speech at the May 1966 Party conference which officially
 launched the Cultural Revolution and confirmed that a
 great purge was underway.  In early August, at the
 Central Committee plenum which approved Mao's plans
 for the Cultural Revolution, Lin again made the main
 speech, defining the criteria for judging all Party
 cadres -- fidelity to Mao's thought, devotion to
 political work, and militancy.   In mid-August Lin spoke

 for Mao at the rally which unveiled the Red Guards --
 organized and indoctrinated students -- as Mao's
 chosen instrument for attacking the Party apparatus
 throughout China.  At another top-level Party meeting
 in October, Lin outlined Mao's plans for continuing
 the Revolution.  Continuing to speak for Mao

 on National Day (1 October), defining the tasks of
 the next stage.  Again on National Day in 1968 (after
 spending the summe.? with Mao) he did so, and in the
 same month summarized the gains and losses of the
 Revolution for a Party plenum.  And he made the main
 report at the Party's Ninth Congress in April 1969.
 Purging and Reorganizing the PLA:    Lin's
 organize  one  activity during   e  u  ural Revolution
 has understandably centered on the PLA:  first, to
 make it a reliable reserve force, and, since January
 1967, to make it a reliable instrument of Mao's will
 in its complex task as the principal executor of Mao's
 policies.
 Lin took the lead in purging the first high-
 level victims, who included his Chief-of-Staff, in
 December 1965.  He began soon thereafter to reorganize
 some of the central military organs and some of the
 regional and provincial commands, at first slowly and
 quietly.

 In January 1967, following the collapse of
 the Party apparatus throughout China under the as-
 saults of the Red Guards, the PLA was ordered into
 action to "support the Left," and it quickly became
 a de facto governing apparatus in the name of the
 Left.*   In the prolonged period of dependence on the
 PLA which followed -- a dependence that continues
 today -- Mao and Lin continued to purge the PLA, but
 in smaller groups, not risking a general revolt.
 They also continued methodically to reorganize the
 military region and district commands, and moved
 armies around China, sometimes with the apparent in-
 tention of putting especially reliable armies in
 sensitive places.  At the same time, showing the
 same deep suspicion of his associates that Mao had
 shown, Lin installed his wife as the chief of his
 staff office.  He also added to the leadership of the
 MAC several younger military men -- of the compara-
 tively few he was prepared to trust -- who were play-
 ing important roles in the Cultural Revolution.
 Further, he reorganized the PLA's special cultural

 1967 -- that it was very hard to tell "left" from

 be the main reason why few PLA leaders were severely
 punished for their "mistakes'' in dealing with mass
 organizations.

 revolution (purge) group around his own proteges --
 his wife and several military figures long close to
 him.
 Lin continued in 1968 to reorganize both the
 central and regional military structures.   He re-
 placed the PLA's special purge group with a more
 nearly orthodox Political Work Group, still composed
 of his proteges, and charged it with investigating
 every PLA leader to support a judgment as to his
 trustworthiness. (He has said again and again that
 nobody is to be completely trusted, that everyone must
 be under surveillance constantly.)  Soon thereafter
 (in March), Lin felt obliged to purge one of his most
 important proteges, his chief-of-staff and concurrently
 the MAC secretary-general and senior supervisor of
 political security work in the PLA; this person was
 charged with challenging him by building his personal
 power and with offending Madame Mao.  Lin replaced
 the purged protege in all three posts by another pro-
 tege even closer to himself, Huang Yung-sheng, a
 regional commander.*  Finally, he again reorganized
 the MAC; he set up, under Huang, an Administrative
 Unit composed of seven proteges who had had key posts
 in the various special organs for the conduct of the
 Cultural Revolution in the PLA, and gave this unit
 supervisory authority over all political security
 work in the PLA -- that is, the entire process of
 screening, investigating and purging PLA leaders, sub-
 ject to review by himself.  This group, perhaps sur-
 prisingly, has remained stable.

 Lin has continued in 1969 and 1970 to purge
 and reorganize the PLA, on a small scale.  Since the
 Ninth Congress, a few PLA leaders have fallen out of
 sight and are thought to have been purged.  A few
 regional and provincial commands have been given new
 top leaders.  The General Political Department is
 again operating, under a new director who had been a
 career military commander, and this department will
 probably recommend other changes.
 Constructing "Revolutionary Committees":    Lin
 has also   en concerned w       e operations and staff-
 ing of the "revolutionary committees" throughout China,
 which have been sharing power with the PLA while the
 Party is being rebuilt.  Mao in February 1967 called
 for the formation of "revolutionary committees" --
 composed of PLA officers, acceptable Party cadres, and
 representatives of mass organizations -- as provisional
 organs of government.  From the start, these committees,
 especially at the highest, provincial level, have in
 general been dominated by military men.
 The spring and summer of 1967 were periods of
 great disorder in China, as mass organizations competed
 for position in the emerging structure of power and
 denounced and attacked PLA leaders, the existing
 "authorities" in China after the collapse of the Party
 apparatus.  Mao and Lin at first gave the PLA substan-
 tial authority to deal with this violence, then
 withdrew it, then gave some of it back.  The problem
 of the shifts in line was complicated by the considera-
 tion that some of the attacks on PLA leaders may have
 been encouraged -- were at least not discouraged -- by
 some of the civilian leaders of Mao's team, causing a
 tension between those leaders and Lin's military com-
 rades which has probably persisted to this day.  Many
 PLA leaders, under attack or at best confused, handled

 the mass organizations roughly, dragged their feet
 in implementing orders from Peking to carry out per-
 missive policies, and declined to admit the young
 revolutionaries to important positions in the revo-
 lutionary committees shaping up.   The few PLA leaders
 who actually defied Peking's orders were purged, while
 the many more who had made "mistakes" were summoned
 to Peking for Mao-study.
 The young militants resumed their large-scale
 violence in late 1967 and the early months of 1968.
 Mao and Lin together, possibly taking counsel from
 PLA leaders, cracked down hard in July 1968.  The
 provincial revolutionary committees then unformed
 were quickly shaped up, in orderly conditions, in the
 summer and early fall of 1968.  Lin in his report to
 the Party Congress in April 1969 was to associate
 himself with Mao's general exoneration of those
 military leaders who had made "mistakes" (and then
 self-criticisms), on the ground that it had indeed
 been very difficult to distinguish friends from ene-
 mies.                 (Lin himself had made this point earlier.)
 These revolutionary committees have continued
 to be very troublesome for Mao and Lin, largely be-
 cause they operate on the "three-way alliance"
 principle.  This has in fact institutionalized con-
 flict, even among the leaders themselves of these
 committees, and Peking is still purging and replacing
 these leaders.  Moreover, Mao himself was responsible
 for re-emphasizing (at the Ninth Party Congress) the
 role of the revolutionary masses, an intervention
 which led to renewed violence.  Even where violence
 is avoided, the revolutionary committees are inherently
 unstable, poor instruments for the implementation of
 Peking's policies and directives.  The rebuilt Party
 apparatus is expected to be a much more stable and
 responsive governing structure.

 Purging and Rebuilding the Part :    Lin has played
 a large roe in the massive purge, and a lesser role
 (until recently) in the slow rebuilding, of the Party in
 the Cultural Revolution.  He stood with Mao in the May
 1966 Party meeting which purged the first of the top-
 ranking Party-machine leaders.  At that time, Mao un-
 veiled a new instrument -- called the central Cultural
 Revolution Group -- for the conduct of the Cultural
 Revolution as a whole and for the coordination of the
 work of smaller such groups.  Lin in May was the first
 to tell Party leaders that the Cultural Revolution was
 to be directed primarily against them, and in August
 Mao and Lin turned the Red Guards loose against the
 Party apparatus.
 At the August 1966 Party plenum, Lin was revealed
 as Mao's choice as "deputy supreme commander of the entire
 party," and Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping, the
 two principal leaders of the Party apparatus, were re-
 moved from power.  The Politburo and (more importantly)
 its standing committee were reorganized accordingly.
 The new standing committee consisted of Mao, Lin, the
 long third-ranking Chou En-lai, and three leaders of
 the central CRG: Chen Po-ta (Mao's chief writer and
 trouble-shooter), Kang Sheng (Mao's political security
 specialist), and a promising regional leader brought
 from South China.   By the end of 1966, the Politburo
 standing committee, dropping the regional figure, had
 assumed essentially the shape it was to keep throughout
 the Cultural Revolution, at least into 1970:  Mao, Lin,
 Chou, Chen, and Kang, with Madame Mao as a possible de
 facto member from time to time.*  Also by the end of 1966,
 ere is some question-as to whether Chen Po-ta,
 missing since 1 August 1970, is still a member.

 the leadership of the central CRG, dropping the same
 man dropped by the Politburo standing committee, became
 stabilized:  Chen, Kang, and Madame Mao.   By this time,
 the CRG had replaced the Party secretariats at the
 center of the work of what remained of the Party appa-
 ratus -- had become, that is, a de facto secretariat.
 Although Lin as vice chairman had authority over this
 CRG, it included no proteges of his.
 Following Mao's call in January 1967 for the
 destruction of the regional and provincial Party com-
 mittees, constructive efforts were concentrated on the
 "revolutionary committees" which were to replace them.
 By autumn 1967, after purging several second-level
 figures of the central CRG, Mao issued instructions to
 certain officers of the CRG -- Kang Sheng and tc r.
 younger ideologues who had served Mao well in sc!tting
 up the Cultural Revolution -- on preparing for a party
 congress and rebuilding the party.  The CRG -- already
 active in handling mass organizations like the Red
 Guards, and in helping the MAC with the reindoctrina-
 tion of regional PLA leaders brought to Peking -- was
 now to play the central role in reconstructing the
 Party.   In December, the central Party organs called
 for rebuilding the Party structure, outside the Party
 center, within the revolutionary committee structure.
 Early in 1968, Lin apparently lost a round in
 his presumed effort to keep the reconstructed Party
 apparatus from compromisin  his own control of political
 security work in the PLA.

 supervising this work, meaning that the work has in
 effect been supervised since 1968 by the entire
 Politburo standing committee.
 In October 1968, Lin defined the main tasks
 of the next stage of the Cultural Revolution as those
 of consolidating the revolutionary committees and
 rebuilding the Party in accordance with Mao's call
 to "take in new blood."  This proceeded slowly, owing
 in large part to Mao's insistence on the "three-way
 alliance" principle -- already established in compo-
 sing the revolutionary committees -- in Party-bt'.lding
 as well.  The principle was apparent in the selection
 of a new Central        25X1
 Committee at the Ninth Party Congress in April 1969.
 That Congress approved a new Party constitution
 which provided for Lin to become Mao's successor with-
 out any nonsense of a Party' election, and reaffirmed the
 principle of Party control of the PLA.  Lin in his
 report to the Congress called on the Party to ensure that
 leadership of Party organizations at all levels "is
 truly in the hands of Marxists" -- meaning Maoists,
 although it seemed doubtful that there were enough
 hard-core Maoists at hand to occupy all key posts even
 at the upper levels of the Party.   In any case, a plenum
 following the Congress elected (reappointed) the Polit-
 buro's five-man standing committee of four Left-inclined
 Maoists (including Lin) and Chou En-lai.
 Since the Ninth Congress  Party-building has
 continued to move very slowl
 E:::~. During the late summer of 1970, however,
 the Party press suggested high-level dissatisfaction
 with the course of Party-building, and shortly there-
 after it was reported that Lin himself had now been
 assigned the central role in this process.*  If this is
 true, Lin has taken a large step in his effort to con-
 struct a Party apparatus reliably responsive to himself.

 II.  Lin and The Super-Elite
 The Big Seven: The super-elite consists,
 strictly, of  ao,    n, and the other three members
 of the politburo standing committee, Chou En-lai,
 Chen Po-ta and Kang Sheng.  The standing committee
 is the core of power, the body which makes those
 decisions that Mao and Lin have not reserved for
 themselves, or which passes matters on to appro-
 priate party organs (e.g., it calls meetings of the
 full politburo), and which sets up and supervises
 the entire party apparatus (including the powerful
 MAC).  Those five members among themselves answer
 (if not always expertly) for the full range of Peking's
 political, military and economic concerns.   It seems
 necessary, however, to consider also Madame Mao, who
 has been less visible since 1968 but who may still be
 a de facto member from time to time when the standing
 committee operates as a discussion group, and has
 been as important in the Cultural Revolution as some
 of the official Big Five; and also Huang Yung-sheng,
 another possible de facto member and in any case the
 second-ranking military leader, whose position in the
 structure of power seems stronger than that of some
 of the foregoing six.

 has had Mao's confidence as a political leader for many
 years, has been Mao's closest comrade since about 1962,
 was designated officially in 1966 as Mao's successor,
 and throughout the Cultural Revolution has been given
 every sign of Mao's continuing trust, reliance, and high
 favor.  This high favor will not necessarily continue:
 Mao is unstable, and he may recently have set aside or
 even purged another of his lieutenants with a record of
 fidelity almost as impressive as Lin's.  Yet the proba-
 bility seems strong that Mao will not arbitrarily
 change his mind about Lin as the most willing and able
 of his lieutenants to carry on with Mao's essential
 policies, and that Lin will not do anything to give
 Mao reason to change his mind.  The practical question
 then seems to be that of Lin's relationships with those
 with whom he will have to work after Mao's death.  Even
 in the small politburo standing committee, the picture
 is mixed.
 Lin and Chou:   Apart from the father-son type
 of bond with Mao. Lin's best relationship appears,
 surprisingly, to be with Chou En-lai, the leader tem-
 peramentally least like himself.  Lin began as a student
 and protege of Chod's in the mid-20s, and there is
 reliable testimony (from a defected Chinese Communist
 leader whose information on other top leaders has been
 excellent) that the two worked closely and welltin the
 early years of the movement.  Chou took Lin with him
 to Chungking for negotiations in 1942-1943, and, although
 the two were largely separated for the next 15 years,
 continued.  They have been close again since 1958
 ~and

 Chou, if consulted, probatlly genuinely favored Mao's

 bad feelings and even conflict between them, Lin and

 with many delicate missions in expounding and en-
 forcing the Mao-Lin policy, including the defense
 Ole Lints military proteges under attack by mass
 organizations.  Chou has apparently been careful to
 consult with Lin when necessary (even on foreign
 affairs), and has done whatever he was asked to do.
 Chou may have reservations P.bout Lin; for example,
 during the Cultural Revolution, Lin at one time made
 contemptuous remarks about the old "state machine"
 which Chou had put together, remarks which probably
 contributed to Chou's inability to save certain of
 his friends and proteges under attack.  And Lin may
 have mixed feelings about Chou, as the constitutional
 provision for Lin to succeed Mao without an election
 is an indirect admission that the very popular Chou
 (the only Chinese leader regularly described by
 non-Communists as "charming") would probably win
 any such election.  But the overall record seems to
 support the view of diplomatic observers in Peking
 that Lin and Chou are fairly close and have thus far
 been a good team.*
 Lin and Other Hard-Core Maoists:  Lints
 relations with the Other two member a of the polit-
 buro standing committee, Chen Po-ta and Kang Sheng,
 and with their close associate, Madame Mao, have
 seemed to be more troubled and less friendly than
 s on y;fair to admit that some observers,
 while not disputing the record, believe that the
 evidence is simply too thin to support any judgment
 on the Lin-Chou relationship.

 his relations with Chou.  This has been true despite
 the fact that all three have the same apparent record
 of simple-minded, whole-hearted allegiance to Mao
 that Lin himself has.     (Chou too has been loyal, but
 has often indicated reservations about some of Mao's
 policies; the other three have not done this.)  The
 four have managed to work together passably well --
 under Mao's guidance and with Mao as arbiter -- during
 the Cultural Revolution, but in an erratic, abrasive
 fashion that has suggested a potential for serious
 conflict.
 Lin did not work well with any of these
 three in the early years (although Chen was with Chou
 and Lin in Chungking in 1942-1943).  Lin had little
 to do with any of the three in the years 1945-1958.
 From 1958, he was forced into a closer association with
 all three -- first Chen, then Kang, then the Madame --
 as each was given special assignments by Mao (prepar-
 ing rationales for Mao's policies and identifying Mao's
 opponents).  During the Cultural Revolution, these
 three have been the principal leaders of the central
 Cultural Revolution Group (said to be the de facto
 party secretariat), and in this role and other special
 assignments have seemed to cut into Lin's territory
 and put Lin himself in an embarrassing position.  Red
 Guard and other mass organizations -- either incited
 by the CRG leaders or permitted by them to get out of
 hand -- attacked many of Lin's proteges and friends.
 While Lin was apparently strong enough to protect all
 of these military leaders (e.g., the military men iiow
 on the politburo) who were not in disfavor with Mao
 as well as with the CRG, he may well have resented the
 way in which the CRG leaders handled their jobs.  Such
 resentment could not be openly expressed; Kang Sheng,
 reflecting Mao's position, described all criticism of
 the central CRG as "enemy activity."  It is suggestive,

 however, that Madame Mao was dropped from the PLA/CRG
 when it was reorganized in the late summer of 1967.
 Moreover, the continued important roles of Chen and
 Kang in the PLA's affairs after that time -- Chen
 and Kang were made responsible, together with MAC
 officers, for the reindoctrination of PLA leaders,
 together
 with the MAC secretary-general, for supervising po-
 litical security work in the PLA -- does not necessarily
 indicate that they had Lints confidence.            Both of
 those tasks were given the CRG leaders by Mao, not
 Lin.
 Kang Sheng might be the hardest of the three
 for Lin to handle.
 it is Kang who chiefly compromises
 'U 99 control of political security work in the PIA.
 There is some possibility that Lin is moving against
 Kang as a man whom he does not like or trust and
 regards as dangerous to him.  The recent report (from
 diplomatic sources) that Lin himself is now playing
 the central role in party-building -- that indeed he
 has taken "personal charge" of it -- may mean that Lin
 himself took the initiative to induce Mao to put him
 in a position to control and restrict Kang, or even
 ease him out.  Moreover, Chou En-lai's participation
 in the task of supervising political security work in
 the PLA may represent another Lin initiative; that
 is, Lin, forced to accept Kang's interference in that
 work, may have asked for Chou in the interest of
 diluting Kang's rple.  Two of the three figures known
 or believed to exercise this supervision are now

 responsive or close to Lin -- Huang Yung-sheng and
 Chou.*  And the recent appointment of a career
 military commander (the natural enemy of a Kang
 Sheng) to head the General Political Department may
 also make it harder for Kang to operate in the
 PLA's political structure.
 In sum, the evidence does not compose a
 clear picture of a hostile relationship between
 Lin and Chou on one hand and Chen Po-ta,, Kang
 Sheng and Madame Mao on the other, but there seems
 an important difference between the kind of rela-
 tionship Lin has had with Chou and the kind he has
 had with the other three.**  There is as yet no
 solid evidence that Lin is moving against any one
 of the three, but it will not be surprising if he
 does so move.
 ou would probably support Lin in any initia-
 tive against any of these three civilian radicals
 which would not risk a collision with Mao.  Chou
 has reason to dislike all three, for attacks on
 policies with which he has been identified and on
 his proteges and friends, attacks which fell just
 short of Chou himself.  Chou is rumored to detest
 Kang Sheng, and there have been some indications
 that he dislikes Madame Mao.
 **Again, it must be admitted that some observers
 regard the evidence as too scanty to support any
 Judgment.

 Lin and His Protege:   Lin's relationship with
 the seventh anT  aTst putative member of the super-
 elite, Huang Yung-sheng, seems of critical importance.
 Huang at least appears to be the model protege.  The
 same age as Lin, he served under Lin throughout the
 1930s, served under another Lin protege elsewhere for
 a few years, was back with Lin in the late 1940s and
 early 1950s, and by 1952 was Lin's chief-of-staff in
 the Central-South.  With Lin's transfer to Peking in
 1955, Huang was named (almost certainly on Lin's re-
 commendation) to succeed him as commander of the
 Canton MR, and kept the post for many years.  Attacked
 by Red Guard groups early in 1967, Huang was twice
 defended by Chou En-lai as a close comrade of Lin's
 (he may be an old friend of Chou's too), and Huang's
 record in the Cultural Revolution was praised even
 by Madame Mao (perhaps under pressure, as her young
 riends had attacked him).   Attacked again later in
 1967, Huang was given a vote of confidence by Mao
 himself.   When in March 1968 Lin was obliged to find
 a new chief-of-staff, secretary-general of the Mili-
 tary Affairs Committee, and supervisor of political
 security work in the PLA, he brought Huang up from
 Canton to fill these posts.  There has been every
 indication since that time -- including his addition
 to the politburo in April 1969 -- that Mao and Lin
 have been pleased with Huang's performance, and that
 Lin has a very close and friendly relationship with
 him.
 Lin seems to need a man of his own, in addition
 to himself and his friend Chou, on the Politburo stand-
 ing committee -- if not now (which would be best), then
 as soon as he succeeds to Mao's position.  Although Huang
 does not appear to share Mao's ideological positions
 to the degree that Lin does (Huang seems more represen-
 tative of professional military men, a relatively con-
 servative class), it is believed that Huang would be
 Lin's first choice for this small group at the summit
 of power . *
 *Some observers, while agreeing that Huang is the
 leading candidate for the standing committee, would re-
 gard his appointment not as evidence of a strengthening
 of Lin's hand but as evidence that the regional military
 leaders had succeeded in placing their own man -- not
 Lin's ^an -- on the standing committee.

 III.  Lin and the Politburo
 The importance of the full politburo (21 voting
 members, four non-voting) is conjectural.  It probably
 plays an important role in decision-making when Mao and
 Lin do not know what they want to do and put the question
 up for a wider discussion than is possible in the five-
 man standing committee.  It is a voting body, but is
 not known ever to have actually voted; if it has, it
 seems most unlikely that Mao has ever (since 1935) lost
 a formal vote.  Mao's troubles of the early 1960s -- in
 effecting his will -- came not from reversals in the
 Politburo but from obstructionism in the Party apparatus
 below the Politburo.  Nevertheless, if the Politburo is
 used by Lin in any way -- as a voting body or as a body
 of consultants or as a deliberative body -- its composi-
 tion might be of much importance.
 Principal-Protege Groupings:  When Mao is not
 included, the 20 full members, considered in terms of
 principals and proteges, seems to fall into three groups.*
 One group consists of Lin and seven other active military
 leaders, every one of whom is a protege and close as-
 sociate of Lin, plus Madame Lin, making a formidable
 bloc o. nine.  Another consists of the five civilian
 leaders of the central CRG -- Chen Po-ta, Kang Sheng,
 Madame Mao, and two younger persons -- every one of
 whom is a protege of Mao or Madame Mao.  And the third,
 a much looser group of six, consists of government lead-
 ers and inactive old-timers, all believed closer to Chou
 En-lai than to any other principal.   In these terms,
 Lin-Chou coalition could of course control the voting,
 if there were any.
 *The two members who have not appeared in public for
 some months -- and may have fallen -- are included in
 this figure.

 SFCR FT
 Radical-Conservative Groupings:  The Politburo
 can also     divided along "radical" and "conservative"
 lines -- that is, between those on one hand closely
 identified with radical and disruptive initiatives in
 the Cultural Revolution, and those on the other hand
 whose roles were more concerned with maintaining or re-
 storing order.                          This is a less satisfactory division,
 because most Politburo members were concerned with the
 implementation of both advances and retreats, depending
 on the phase of the Revolution.   It is true, however,
 that some leaders have seemed to show a  predisposition
 to radical policies, like Mao himself, and others have
 seemed to prefer if not conservative than at least more
 nearly moderate policies, like Chou and most military
 figures.   In these terms, the "radicals" make a group
 of nine, including Lin and his wife, all five central
 CRG leaders, and two other central military leaders;
 the "conservatives" total six, Chou and the other five
 active military leaders; and the "neutrals" (inactive
 or impossible to assess) total four.  Expressed in these
 terms, the "radicals" would not necessarily dominate a
 vote.
 The Politburo in Action:  Thus Lin Piao, whether
 standing w       e military leaders or with the "radicals"
 in a given vote in the Politburo, would need to put
 together a coalition in order to prevail.   There is a
 question, however, as to whether it is realistic to
 expect the Politburo to vote Lin down on a matter of
 importance to him.  Those Politburo members more closely
 associated with central CRG figures or with Chou En-lai
 than with Lin would have to recognize that, in a show-
 down on those lines, the means of coercion would be
 almost entirely in the hands of Lints group.   (Mao
 successfully employed this stratagem =- displaying the
 armed force at his command -- at the August 1966 plenum
 which approved his plans for the Cultural Revolution.)
 Similarly, those disposed to vote against a "radical"
 initiative by Lin would have to recognize that the
 Politburo standing committee -- which is in the hands
 of the "radicals" -- could simply nullify an adverse
 vote and decide the matter among its five members.

 SECRET
 The true importance of the Politburo seems to
 lie in its potential as a sounding-board and discussion
 group, which could provide Lin with counsel on those
 matters on which he might feel a need for several points
 of view.  In such cases, the various backgrounds, pre-
 dispositions, and particular experiences of the Polit-
 buro's members might be honestly reflected in the dis-
 cussion and might be truly helpful to Lin.  The range
 of knowledge and competence on the present Politburo
 is considerable, although a non-Maoist would think that
 Lin would do well to have on his Politburo fewer radical
 ideologues and agitators of the CRG type and more
 specialists in sectors of the economy -- fewer "reds,"
 more experts.  Apart from the omnicompetent Chou En-
 lai, there is only one Politburo member (Li Hsien-nien)
 with substantial experience in economic management,
 and he seems to be concerned now with other things.

 1V.  Lin and the Central Military Leaders
 The PLA does not dominate the "national" govern-
 ment:                         that is, the group of leaders, all in Peking, who
 make the fundamental decisions on such large matters
 as national defense, foreign policy, development of the
 economy, and the conduct of nation-wide political cam-
 paigns.  As previously seen, such decisions are made by
 Mao, by Mao and Lin, or by the five-man Politburo
 standing committee, who may or may not consult others
 first. The PLA has been, however,'.the base of power
 for Mao (in recent years) and for Lin (since 1959),
 the "enforcer" of those decisions that need to be en-
 forced, the protector of Mao and Lin and other central
 leaders, the supervisor of many central ministries, the
 de facto government outside Peking for most of the
 Cultural Revolution, the dominant force within most of
 the local governing bodies charged with carrying out
 Mao's policies, and (in the field armies) the coercive
 power throughout China.  The central leadership of
 the PLA power-system in recent years has come to be
 strikingly dominated by Lin Piao and those regarded in
 this paper as his proteges.
 The MAC Standing Committee:  The most important
 organs of the central military apparatus are:   the
 Military Affairs Committee (MAC), which has authority
 over the entire military establishment and can send
 orders directly to any component; the administrative
 unit of the MAC, which handles its daily work and
 supervises all political security work in the PLA (in-
 cluding the work of the General Political Department);
 and the General Staff or Joint Chiefs-of-Staff -- i.e.,
 the Chief-of-Staff and his deputies, the planning organ
 of the MAC and the source of most of the orders going
 to the PLA.   It is in these three key organs that Lin's
 proteges are most heavily clustered.

 When the Cultural Revolution began, Lin was (as
 he remains) the de facto chairman of the MAC, but its
 key posts -- officers of the MAC and members of its
 standing committee -- were divided about equally between
 (a) old-timers who had made their careers independently
 of Lin and (b) a small group of Lin's proteges.  During
 the Cultural Revolution, Lin purged or helped to purge
 several of them (including four who were his own proteges
 or joint Mao-Lin proteges), and has set aside others.*
 The MAC leadership is now composed almost entirely of
 Lin's proteges.  The MAC leaders, who hold many other
 key posts in the central military apparatus, are:
 (1) Yeh Chien-ying, the only vice-chairman known to be
 active, Lints deputy in the old Central-South command
 and a spokesman for him in recent years, although
 believed to be closer personally to Chou En-lai; (2)
 Huang,Yung-sheng, Lin's "model" protege previously
 discussed, who as secretary-general and chief of the
 administrative unit is second in importance only to
 Lin; x,3,4,5) three leaders with a common profile, Wu
 Fa-hsien, Li Tso-peng, and Chiu Hui-tso, each of whom
 long served with Lin, was named by Lin to a key military
 post in the 1959-67 period (respectively Commander of
 the Air Force, lot Political Officer of the Navy,
 Director of Logistics), and has been given key posts
 in political security organs of the PLA in recent years;
 (6) Yeh Chun, Lin's wife and the head of his staff
 office;  (7) Wen Yu-cheng, commander of the Peking Gar-
 rison, a joint Lin-Huang protege from the Central-
 South**;(8) Liu Hsien-chuan, who long served with Lin
 *The most recent to fall seems to be Hsieh Fu-chih,
 not a Lin protege but a protege of the disgraced Teng
 Hsiao-ping, who, surprisingly, was added to the leader-
 ship of the MAC and even to the Politburo, but has now
 been missing for many months.
 **Wen has been missing since 1 June, together with
 some of the political officers of the Garrison.

 and was brought from a district command in 1968 to a
 key central post, possibly with Second Artillery (mis-
 siles); (9) Su Yu, not a Lin protege, an oldtime field
 army commander with a spectacular combat record who in
 recent years has headed the Office of National Defense
 Industries, and who is believed to be close to Chou En-
 lai'; And, finally,'' (10)' Li Te-sheng, not -a' Lin protege
 but the protege of a protege, recently brought from
 an army command to be Director of the General Political
 Department.   (Seven of these persons -- the first six,
 and the last -- are also members of the Party Politburo.)
 The MAC Administrative Unit:  The composition
 of the administrative unit o  the   C -- the equivalent
 of a Party secretariat -- has been reported only once
 (in 1968); it has probably added at least one officer.
 The seven reported officers as of 1968 were secretary-
 general Huang Yung-sheng and six others (all discussed
 above) from the standing committee -- the seven regarded
 (among MAC officers) as closest to Lin, every one of
 them a Lin protege in every sense.*  Lin was obviously
 determined to have political security work in the PLA
 controlled by people he could trust. because
 could trust.  The officer probably added is Li Te-sheng,
 the General 'olitical Department director noted above.
 The General Staff:  Although Lin himself is
 Minister o  National     ense, this Ministry appears to
 be a superfluous echelon, largely bypassed in recent
 years, between the MAC and the General Staff.**  It is

 the Deputy Chiefs-of-Staff, not the Deputy Ministers of
 Defense, who are members of the Politburo and of the
 MAC standing committee and administrative unit; the MAC
 has not even bothered to replace the deputy ministers
 who were purged, and those still identified have not
 been close to Lin in recent years.
 The General Staff is clearly the most important
 organ below the level of the MAC.  Under C/S Huang Yung-
 sheng, who represents the ground forces, are 10 or 11
 deputy chiefs who are concurrently the commanders or
 political officers of other service arms (Air Force,
 Navy, possibly Second Artillery), the heads of at least
 two of the three known general departments (Staff, Poli-
 tical, Logistics), the probable heads of certain key sub-
 departments of the General Staff Department, and two or
 three other key figures.
 Again the clustering of Lin's proteges, and the
 occupancy of several key posts concurrently, is striking.
 Of the 10 or 11 military leaders who comprise this group
 (depending on whether Li Te-sheng has been added to
 the deputies), four or five -- Huang, Wu Fa-hsien, Li
 Tso-peng, Chiu Hui-tso, and Li Te-sheng if added --
 have been encountered above as concurrently members of
 the Politburo, of the MAC standing committee, and of
 the MAC administrative unit; and another, Wen Yu-cheng,
 on the MAC standing committee and the MAC administrative
 unit.  Five of those six (all but Li)are Lin's proteges.
 Of the remaining five deputy chiefs-of-staffs, two are
 Lin proteges, and three are not.
 Other Central Military Leaders:  The other key
 figures of the central military Leadership are the other
 leading officers of the principal service arms and the
 three general departments, other specialized service
 headquarters (artillery, armored, engineers, railway
 engineers, signal, public security, eta), the National
 Defense Scientific and Technological Commission (research
 and development of advanced weapons), the Office of
 National Defense Industries (production of advanced

 weapons), and the Peking Garrison.  The picture is less
 striking at this level.  Whereas Lints proteges occupy
 the great majority of posts at the very top level dis-
 cussed above, at this second level they occupy fewer
 than half.  At this level they fill more than half of
 the leading posts only in certain arms and headquarters
 and offices which Lin presumably regards as especially
 sensitive -- the Air Force, Artillery, and 2nd Artillery
 (missiles).  On this reasoning, an abundance of Lin
 proteges would be expected too in the General Political
 Department and the Peking Garrison, but this is appar-
 ently not the case at this time.*
 s Of-1968-69,
 the General Political Department was
 inactive, and its work of indoctrination and surveillance
 was being handled by two special bodies, the Political
 Work Group and the Support-the-Left Group.  The more
 important of the two, the Political Work Group, charged
 with investigating PLA leaders from army-level up, was
 apparently led by the Lin protege Wu Fa-hsien; the other
 was a mixed group.  The Political Work Group may still
 exist, as yet another supervisory authority over the
 reconstructed General Political Department, but this
 seems unnecessary, as the MAC administrative unit, com-
 posed of the same Lin proteges, already exists for this
 purpose.  The Political Work Group has not been heard
 from in the past year, and probably faded away as the
 General Political Department began operating again late
 in 1969.  However, the Political Work Group very prob-
 ably assembled the new General Political Department,
 which means that hard-core Lin-men were satisfied as to
 the reliability of the GPD's new leaders, even though'
 most of those identified in the GPD do not seem to be
 Lin proteges themselves.  Lira's control over the GPD is
 put into question not by the GPD leadership but by the
 fact that supervisory authority was divided -- as of
 1968 -- between the MAC and Kang Sheng's political
 security apparatus.  The latter may, as before, work
 through special political security groups in the poli-
 tical departments at all levels.  However, as previously
 suggested, Chou En-lai's role in supervising political
 security work at least dilutes Kang's role.

 There is a large group in the central military
 leadership -- several dozen people -- in unidentified
 posts of sufficient importance to rate a mention of
 their occupants on ceremonial occasions.  Many of these
 are military positions at lower levels than those
 discussed above -- e.g., junior deputies in the service
 arms and headquarters, the directors of unpublicized
 military organs (e.g., ir..;;elligence), and the leaders
 of military schools.  Many others, however, are the
 chiefs and deputy chiefs of Military Control Commissions
 in central government ministries, unspecified key figures
 in ministries from which the MCCs have been withdrawn,
 and key figures in the central Party apparatus now being
 constructed.  There are several of Lin's proteges in
 this group, but they seem to be a small minority.
 Lints Domination:  In sum, Lin Piao seems to
 dominate      a central military leadership to the degree
 he wants to -- overwhelmingly (on this readings at the
 top level, to a degree never before seen, largely
 through a small number of proteges in concurrent posts
 in the three most important organs; and selectively
 at the second level, although this may increase as
 new leading figures are identified.  He does not seem
 to concern himself much with lower levels of the central
 leadership:  he is content with a mixture of old-timers,
 proteges of other top-level and second-level leaders,
 and promising young people.

 V.   Lin and the Regional Military Leaders
 The headquarters of the 11 Military Regions (MRs)
 have been in effect China's regional governments since
 the destruction of the Party's regional bureaus in
 1966-67.  The commander and political officer of each
 of these MRs are powerful figures, with authority (un-
 less Peking chooses to exercise it directly) over the
 armies disposed in them; moreover, one or the other
 always heads the "revolutionary committee" (government)
 of the province in which the MR headquarters is located.
 The commanders and political officers of the 36 or more
 armies disposed in these MRs are also powerful f.'.gures;
 while subject to orders from the MRs or directly from
 Peking, they command the forces on which the leaders in
 Peking primarily depend for the imposition of their will
 outside Peking.  The commanders and political officers
 of the 24 Military Districts (MDs) are normally less
 important, in that they normally control only PLA security
 forces, garrison commands, and the militia; but some
 have been concurrently (and first) the leaders of
 armies sent into sensitive areas, some have been given
 command of major tacticn* units in emergencies,  and
 many have been important in the Cultural Revolution as
 the heads of "revolutionary committees" in those pro-
 vinces not dominated by the MR leaders.
 The Purged and the Proteges:  When the Cultural
 Revolution began, the 11    s were dominated by the
 Party's regional bureaus (generally coterminous), which
 were of course parts of the Party machine directed by
 Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping.  The regional first
 secretaries, stronger in their own right than the mili-
 tary commanders of these regions, were also the first
 political officers of all of these MRs, thus doubling
 their strength, and usually the first secretaries of
 the Party committees of the MRs.  Most of the military
 commanders of the MRs, unlike the secretary - political

 officers, were apparently not marked for purging when
 the Revolution began; however, a few were under suspicion,
 others came under suspicion with the purge of certain
 central military figures to whom they had been close,
 and others ran afoul of the Revolution Itself.
 All 11 of the Party-machine figures who were
 regional first secretaries and first political officers
 were brought down in the early stages of the Cultural
 Revolution.  At the same time, however, Lin Piao
 strongly expressed his confidence in several of his
 regional military commanders.  At least four of them
 -- Huaag  unY g-shong of Canton, Chen Hsi-lien of
 Shenyang, Hsu Shih-yu of Nanking, and Han Hsien-chu of
 Foochow -- were summoned by Lin in August 1966, to-
 gether with a few central military leaders, to be told
 about Lin's plans for the conduct of the Cultural
 Revolution in the PLA.  A fifth apparent favorite of
 Lin's, Yang Te-chih of Tsinan, may also have been present.*
 *Four of theme five had been pretty firmly established
 as proteges of Lin Piao long before the Cultural Revolu-
 tion began.  All five, the some age as Lin or a little
 younger, had served under Lin in their early careers
 and had gone on to important regional posts in the 1950s.
 Lin had probably arranged for Huang to succeed him as
 commander of the Canton MR in the early 1950s, and,
 soon after becoming Minister of National Defense in
 1959, had named Chen, Hsu and Han to key posts (respectively
 commander of the Shenyang MR, deputy minister of national
 defense, and commander of the Foochow MR).  The fifth
 ?          of these figures, Yang Te-chih, became commander of the
 Tsinan MR soon after Lin returned to action in Peking
 in 1959, but it is not known whether Lin recommended
 him for the post; Yang's status was in some question
 for a time after the fall of Peng Te-huai in 1959, owing
 to his close association with Pang, and he may have been
 on probation in Lin's mind; by spring 1960, however,
 he was confirmed as the Tsinan commander, and from early
 1962 seemed clearly in good favor.  As it turned out,
 Yang was to have the easiest time of any of the regional
 commanders in the Cultural Revolution.  Again, it must
 be admitted that some observers see these men -- and
 other MR leaders -- not as Lin's proteges but as inde-
 pendently powerful figures with whom he must "compromise."

 In the course of the Revolution, Lin has continued to
 show great confidence in those five, but has replaced
 the military commanders of the other six MRs.   The
 Peking MR was reorganized in 1967; Chengtu twice, in
 1966 and 1967; Kunming in 1966-67; Wuhan in 1967;
 Sinkiang in 1968; and Lanchow in 1969.   In each case
 but one (Lanchow), the replaced commander was purged.
 The leaders of the armies disposed in the MRs
 and MDs, and the commanders and political officers of
 the MDs, were also a problem for Lin.   The armies were
 in better shape than the MRs and MDs, but their poli-
 tical departments were responsible to the MR political
 officers (that is, Party-machine figures); and most of
 the MDs, like the MRs, were dominated by Party-machine
 types who were concurrently first secretaries and fii.
 political officers.   In the course of the Revolution,
 Lin ias changed the commands of several of the armies,*
 and has replaced 20 of the first political officers of
 the MDs and 19 of the military commanders of the MDs.
 Several of the MDs have been reorganized twice.
 In these various reorganizations, many of Lin's
 proteges have moved into key positions, or have been
 promoted from key positions to higher and dominating
 positions.   It seems apparent in these reorganizations,
 just as in the reorganizations of the central military
 structure, that Lin has been concerned to get his
 proteges -- men he has good reason to trust -- into
 the top-level positions, not into the second-and-third
 level positions:   that is, to place them as commanders
 of MRs, for example, rather than MDs.   Nevertheless,
 *A precise figure for the armies cannot be provided;
 most of their leaders, when the Revolution began, were
 not known.  There is general agreement that the purge
 of the armies has been substantial, but on nothing like
 the scale of the MR and MD headquarters.

 he has not installed in these top positions as many
 proteges as he might have; he could, if he chose, have
 placed them in _e_vveery top-level post in each MR, by
 taking some from- other MRs saturated with them (Canton
 and Foochow), or -- probably -- in command of every
 army, by moving up some deputy commanders of other
 armies.  But he has not done this, he has often been
 content with the man in place, and has sometimes as-
 signed proteges of other leaders (even disgraced leaders)
 to key positions.
 The Four Most Important MRs:  The generally-
 accepted 'strategic areas" of     na -- so defined
 for a combination of political, military and economic
 regions -- center on Peking, Shenyang, Nanking and
 Canton.  Peking too regards them as the most important.
 The largest numbers of armies are in these four M':is.
 Both the commander and the first political officer of
 one of these (Nanking) are on the Party politburo, the
 commander of another (Shenyang) is there, the political
 officer of another (Peking) is there, and the ea-
 commander of the fourth (Canton) is there.   No other
 MRs are represented on the politburo.
 The Shenyang MR, the center of the Northeast
 region once commanded by Lin, seems secure under Chen
 Hsi-lien, named to the post by Lin in 1959, shown to
 be in Lin's confidence during the Cultural Revolution,
 and added to the Politburo in 1969.   (The first poli-
 tical officer is an old Party cadre restored by the
 Revolution.)  The senior deputy commanders are also
 Lin's proteges. Most of the known army commanders in
 ?          this MR are Lift-men or at least out of Lin's old forces.
 The military districts subordinate to this MR are
 apparently still being reorganized, and may or may
 not show the same pattern.
 The Nanking MR is commanded by Hsu Shih-yu, an-
 other named to a key post by Lin.,_in...195   whose troops
 protected Mao and Lin in their winter ret  a  of 1965-66,
 who was working with Lin  on hip2Th  for the Cultural
 Revolution even prior to mid-1966, wa protected by Mao

 and Lin during the Revolution, and was added to the
 Politburo in 1969.   (The first political officer, an
 old Party cadre who helped Mao to launch the Revolu-
 tion, spends little time here and has apparently been
 replaced de facto by a Lin protege.)  Most of the
 leading figures of armies and MDs here sees to be
 proteges of Hsu himself, presumably thought reliable
 for that reason.
 The Canton MR, commanded until 1968 by the
 model Lin protege Huang Yung-sheng (then brought to
 Peking as Lin's first deputy), is commanded now by
 Ting Sheng, also a Lin protege from the 4th Field
 Army but not as close to Lin over the years as several
 others who were available.  Ting was promoted from
 another area, apparently for exceptional service.
 Virtually all of the leading figures -- military and
 political -- of this MR, of the armies disposed in
 it, and of the subordinate MDs, are proteges of Lin
 and/or Huang.  This MR seems to be just as solid as
 Shenyang and Nanking.
 Among the four key MRs -- and now in fact among
 all 11 MRs -- Peking is the curious and inexplicable
 exception.  Neither the acting commander nor the poli-
 tical officer is a Lin protege, nor are their senior
 deputies*; and in the Peking Garrison -- the immediately
 available coercive force -- only the commander is known
 to be a Lit man, and he is missing.  However, some of
 the armies in this MR are commanded by men who are Lin's
 *  n began the Cultaral Revolution with one of his
 long time proteges -- Yang_Yung -- in the key post of
 commander of this MR.  Purged in 19.67, Yang is the only
 Lin protege among the 60-odd tonal military leaders
 known or believed purged.  There are several Lin
 proteges among the missing, but some of these have
 been reported under rehabilitation (perhaps saved by
 their ties with Lin), and most are expected to show up
 eventually.

 proteges or out of his old forces, and his proteges
 are beginning to appear in the MD commands.
 The Seven Lesser MRs:  The seven other MRs all
 sees to be in generally good shape, from Lin's point
 of view.  The Tsinan MR is commanded by a Lin favorite,
 Yang Te-chih, the acting political officer is a long-
 time Lin protege, and there may be others in the armies
 there.  The Foochow MR under Han Hsien-chu is a model,
 with all of the leading posts in the MR, and others
 in the armies and the MDs, held by proteges and personal
 friends of Lin's.  The Wuhan MR is commanded by Lin's
 protege and friend Tseng Szu-yu and has some other
 Lin-men in the MR headquarters.  The Chengtu MR is
 commanded by two figures described by Lin as "old
 friends," one of whom is in fact his protege,  the
 other apparently favored by Mao for his support at a
 critical time; the subordinate Tibet MD is dominated
 by Lin's proteges, and there may be others in the
 armies.  The Kunming MR has also been led by two men
 described by Lin as his "old friends," who have appar-
 ently been reorganizing the armies and MDs; that one
 of the two who fits the pattern of a Lin protege has
 just now died; and the other may replace him in the
 top post.  The Sinkiang MR, troublesome until 1968,
 has been stable for the past two years under two of
 Lin's proteges, one of whom may have been transferred
 recently to the less satisfactory Peking MR.
 The Lanchow MR, as of summer 1970, was an ex-
 ception, and an important one, because it contains the
 ancillary PLA headquarters (at Sian) and a number of
 China's most sensitive military facili;,ies.  Neither
 the commander nor the political officer was a Lin
 protege, and the senior figures throughout the MR were
 old-timers in the area  no had had ties with two
 purged military leaders.  In recent months, however,
 Lin has sent into this MR a strong army commanded by
 his longtime proteges, and has installed another pro-
 tege, Pi Ting-chun, as the new commander of the MR.
 (Pi's profile resembles that of Ting Sheng in Canton.

 He was serving with Lin as early as 1937, but has been
 closer over the years to other Lin proteges -- Hsu
 Shih-yu, Chen Hsi-lien, and Han Hsien-chu -- than to
 Lin himself.)  Pi seems to have become the head of
 the MR Party committee, a post reportedly held pre-
 viously by the first political officer.   Lin may in-
 creasingly arrange for his proteges to get these key
 Party posts.*
 In sum, Lin's position with respect to the Mili-
 I tary Regions seems very strong.  Almost all of the MR
 commanders are his proteges.   So are several of the
 first political officers, and the others have seemed
 also to serve him well tn the Cultural Revolution.  Many
 other leading figures in the MRs, and in the armies
 disposed in them, are Lin's proteges.   Only the Peking
 MR still seems to require reorganization.   Lin's pro-
 teges do not dominate the relatively unimportant mili-
 tary districts to anything like the degree that they
 dominate the powerful military regions, and Lin does
 not seem to feel a need for this degree of domination
 at the lower level.   But Lin's men are still reorganiz-
 ing the MDs, and additional proteges of Lin's are ex-
 pected to appear in them as well.
 * n t e past, the first political officer was almost
 always the first secretary of the Party committee of
 ,the military region or other organization.   Lin mma  be
 changing that, making the military commander normally
 the dominant figure.   Evidence is inconclusive.  Only
 two first secretaries -- or untitled heads -- of Party
 committees in the MRs had been credibly reported earlier:
 Chang Chun-chiao in the Nanking MR, who is the first
 political officer, and Lung Shu-chin in the Sinkiang
 MR, who is the military commander.   If Pi is now the
 head of the Party committee in the Lanchow MR, two of
 three would be military commanders.

 VI.  Lin and the State Machinery
 As Lin himself observed, the PLA in 1967 was
 forced to take over the state machinery, regarded by
 Mao and himself as being almost as unsatisfactory as
 the Party apparatus which controlled it.  Lin said at
 the time that the PLA did not intend to remain in the
 state machinery longer than necessary.  But it is still
 there, and is evidently to stay.
 The Central Government:  The Military Affairs
 Committee had control of the National Defense Scientific
 & Technological Commission (research and development of
 advanced weapons) long before the Cultural Revolutii-
 began, and in spring 1967 it took over the Office of
 National Defense Industries (production of advanced
 weapons), which directs the work of the important
 ministries of heavy industry.  The MAC was apparently
 to keep control of these organs permanently.  Those
 organs -- staff offices, other ministries and commis-
 sions, bureaus and special agencies -- which were to
 be supervised only temporarily by the PLA were placed
 under Military Control Commissions.   These MCCs were
 apparently installed in almost all central government
 organs, including the Ministry of Public Security and
 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 Many of the PLA leaders in the state machinery
 have been identified, but only a few have been tied to
 particular posts.  Some of them are proteges of Lin
 Piao -- e.g., the head of the ministry believed to be
 concerned with nuclear weapons -- but most of them
 are not.  Lin has apparently not been interested in
 establishing himself strongly -- through proteges --
 in the state machinery across the board.
 In recent months the central government has been
 briskly reorganizing, consolidating the ministries and
 -39-

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/07/29: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010041-1
 reducing their number, deactivating the Military Control
 Commissions and appointing top officials.   In the pro-
 cess, PLA officers who have presumably been the leaders
 of MCCs in the ministries are being appointed as civilian
 officials.  For example, in recent weeks a PLA leader
 has been listed in second place among officers of the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and another has been named
 the new Minister of Agriculture and Forestry.  Many other
 career military men have appeared in the nova in such
 a way as to indicate  that they will be named to similar
 posts.   In general, these men are not well-known figures.
 This means that they are not Lin'N longtime proteges,
 the sense in which "protege" has been used in this paper.
 The chances are that they are not even more recent
 proteges.  The appointments of PLA officers at this
 level are probably handled not by Lin or even by the
 MAC standing committee but by some lesser body such as
 the MAC administrative unit in consultation with Chou
 En-lai's State Council.
 Beyond the purview given him by the MAC's control
 of the NDS&T Commission and the NDIO and by the MCCs in
 the ministries, Lin apparently relies of Chou En-lai
 to tell him what he needs to know about the work of the
 government.  There is some evidence that Chou clears
 with Lin (as the Party vice-chairman with a need-to-
 know) the important decisions made by Chou himself and
 by the state machinery.
 Provincial Machiner :  There is no regional state
 machinery, and, s nce 1907, no regional Party machinery
 outside the MR commands; as noted above, the MR commands
 have been the de facto regional governments.  However,
 there has been a provincial government machinery, in
 the form of the "revolutionary committees" in which
 power is theoretically shared equally by PLA represen-
 tatives, old Party cadres, and representatives of mass
 organizations (students and workers).  These committees
 were not up largely by Chou En-lai and the central CRG,
 but there is much testimony that the PLA has dominated
 their operations on the spot from the start.  This would
 be expected, as the weapons, the Support-the-Left troops,

 SRC:R RT
 and the security departments of the committees themselves
 are all in the hands of the PLA.  This has not, however,
 been a stable domination, which the PLA figures could
 impose if left to themselves.  Mao intervenes periodi-
 cally to improve the relative positions of the Party
 and mass components, telling the military to avoid
 coercion and work patiently for agreements, a policy
 which, as noted above, institutionalizes conflict in
 a novel way.
 Of the 26 provincial revolutionary committees,
 some five to seven are apparently being reorganized,
 and their present leading figures are not known.*  Of
 the remainder, proteges of Lin Piao are the chairmen
 of 10, and are the first vice-chairmen of two or three
 others.  Two other provincial committees are headed
 by Party cadres who worked under Lin in the old Central-
 South apparatus and who may have been sponsored by his
 in recent years.  Several of Lin's proteges are in
 positions in yet other committees -- for example, as
 one of several vice-chairmen -- which are less important
 but in which they can at least watch what goes on.
 It can be argued that Lin is making an effort
 to dominate these committees through his proteges, but
 the appearance of this is probably deceptive.  Lin
 does of course have an interest in having reliable
 leaders in all of the provinces, just as in the military
 districts.  But, just as it was found that Lin felt no
 need to install his proteges in the Military District
 commands, he does not appear to be trying to install
 then in most of these provincial committees, an equivalent
 *The leading figures are the chairman and the first
 vice-chairmen.  In most cases, either the chairman or
 the first vice-chairman has had long experience in the
 area; sometimes both have had.  In the few cases in
 which neither has had this history, there are others
 on the committees who have worked a long time in those
 areas.

 level of power.  The exceptions are the provinces in
 which the MR headquarters are located.  There the com-

 rently the chairmen of the revolutionary committees.
 In other words, each holds the provincial post in order
 to facilitate his tasks in the far more important MR
 post.  In provinces which do not contain an MR head-
 quarters, few of the revolutionary committee chairmen
 are Lin's proteges.  If Lin felt it necessary, he
 could probably put proteges into almost all of those
 chairs.  Moreover, even if the assumption here -- that
 Lin does not feel a need to dominate the lower levels
 to the degree he does the higher -- is mistaken,
 control of the new Party committees in the provinces
 would be more useful to

 VII.  Lin and the Emerging Party Aooaratus
 As noted above, the true base of power for Mao
 and Lin in recent years has been the PLA, not the Party.
 While Mao and Lin are both committed in principle to
 restoring the primacy of "the Party", some years will
 probably be required to make this actual.  The present
 situation -- in which "the Party" consists largely of
 the Party apparatus in the PLA -- is presumably agree-
 able to Lin for the time being, as he is the head of
 the military establishment, and the military Party ap-
 paratus is responsive to the MAC.  But he must turn
 his attention to constructing an overall Party apparatus
 which, by the time that he becomes the head of the Party,
 will be as responsive to him as the military Party ap-
 paratus is now.  He cannot, of course, know  how such
 time he will have to work in.
 The Old Central A  aratus:  Prior to the Cultural
 Revolut on,   a central Party apparatus under the Polit-
 buro standing committee -- and apart from the MAC --
 consisted essentially of:  the Party secretariat, i.e.,
 the secretary-general (the Party's chief executive of-
 ficer) and several secretaries, each of whom had some
 large area of concern (e.g., political security, propa-
 ganda, agriculture) and supervised one or more of the
 Party's central departments; the staff office, an
 administrative organ for the secretariat which had also
 some sensitive political security responsibilities
 (records of Party meetings, personnel files, protection
 of Party leaders); the central departments (e.g., or-
 ganization, propaganda, political security, foreign
 liaison, united front work, various political depart-
 ments for sectors of the economy); the central control
 commission, which examined and dealt with violations
 of discipline by Party members; a political research
 office (under Chen Po-ta) responsible to Mao personally;
 and a special five-man group, also not up by Mao,

 charged with purging the arts.   Except for the staff
 office  the director of which was replaced), this entire
 structure was destroyed in the early stages of the
 Cultural Revolution, and most of its ranking personnel
 were purged.
 The Cultural Revolution Grou :  As noted pre-
 viously, a central Cultural Revolution Group set up
 in the spring of 1966 had become the de facto secre-
 tariat by the end of 1966,* and in 1967 certain of its
 officers were given the central roles in rebuilding
 the Party.  The Party congress of 1969 did not estab-
 lish a new Party secretariat, and the central CRG has
 reportedly continued to function as the de facto
 secretariat.  With Chen Po-ta missing since 1 August
 and out of action (if not favor), the effective
 secretariat has seemed to consist of Kang Sheng,
 Madame Mao, the Ideologues Chang Chun-chiao and
 Yao Wen-yuan, and Wang Tung-hsing (long Mao's body-
 guard and since 1966 the head of the sensitive
 staff office).
 These officers -- all of them Politburo members --
 have continued to be-'7treated in Peking's media as the
 most prestigious group below the level of the Polit-
 buro standing committee -- more so than the military
 leaders as a group.  This treatment seems to reflect
 Mao's view of them, all of whom have records of absolute
 fidelity to Mao.  This group would not seem satisfactory
 to Lin, however, as a Party secretariat.   Some of them
 *The special five-man group was abolished and replaced
 by the CRG, the political research group was absorbed
 by the CRG (headed by the same person, Chen Po-ta), the
 central control commission was set aside, the central
 departments were put out of business one by one, and
 finally the secretaries themselves -- with a few excep-
 tions -- were purged.  The process was complete by
 early 1967.

 have clashed seriously with people close to Lin if not
 with Lin himself, and in any case there is no person
 close to Lin in this group.  Moreover, these five of-
 ficers do not have the range of the old secretariat.
 Kang and Wang can answer for one very important function,
 political security; Kang, Chang and Yao have been con-
 cerned in recent years with organizational work; Chang,
 Yao, and Madame Mao have had much experience with propa-
 ganda work; and Kang is an old hand in liaison with
 foreign Communist Parties.  But this de facto secretariat
 clearly needs to have someone to handle liaison between
 the Party apparatus and the Military Affairs Committee
 and at least one person to coordinate the work of the
 economic departments.
 The Politburo standing committee as a whole probably
 reviews the key appointments both in the Party center
 and in the provinces, and Mao probably keeps for him-
 self the power to resolve disputes.

 It is impossible to judge whether Lin is in any
 way responsible for the current inactivity of Chen Po-
 ta.  However, apArt from this, it seems likely that
 Lin is taking or has already taken action to change the
 composition of the central CRG.  Lin has among his
 proteges in the PLA structure specialists of the kinds
 the secretariat seems to require -- men who have acquired
 considerable competence in liaison with non-military
 organs and in non-military affairs generally in recent
 years.  It is possible that PLA figures are already
 working on the CRG, without publicity, in some such
 status as the alternate secretaries of the old secre-
 tariat.
 The Subordinate Apparatus:  The organization of
 the central Party apparatus,  a ow the level of the
 central CRG, is conjectural.  Peking has spoken of

 It may be that, in accordance with Mao's and
 Lin's expressed determinatirn to simplify all ad-
 ministrations, the central Party apparatus has been
 simplified -- at least nominally.   It may be divided,
 as the revolutionary committees in the provinces
 seem to be, into four large functions! areas:  admin-
 istration, political work, production, and security.
 If no, there are probably various departments within
 these areas.
 As for administration, the chances are that the

 has seemed to be subordinate directly to the politburo
 standing committee, has been taken over again by the

 of the central CRG would thus supervise himself as
 head of the staff office.
 The political work area would include the work
 of the old departments of organization and propaganda,
 united front work, and liaison.  Any combination of
 Chen Po-ta, Kang Sheng, Chang Chun-chiao and Yao Wen-
 yuan could supervise this.
 The production area would include the work of
 the several old departments concerned with economic
 planning, finance and trade, industry and commerce,
 and agriculture and forestry.  No one known to be an
 officer of the secretariat is qualified to supervise
 this area.
 The security area would be concerned both with
 political security (the party, especially the leader-
 ship) and public security (the populace).  The chances
 are that the de facto political security directorate,
 believed to exist in recent years, subordinate at
 first to Mao directly and then (like the staff office)
 to the Politburo standing committee, has now been re-
 absorbed by this de facto secretariat.  Kang Sheng
 and Wang Tung-hsing as officers of the CRG may super-
 vise themselves as heads of the security area, and
 may concurrently head some of the departments of this
 area, e.g., a reconstituted Social Affairs Department
 or (a later name) Political Security Department.
 Various PLA officers at the Central Coswai t tee

 'these men, including proteges of Lin, appear in the
 Central Committee lists on ceremonial occasions rather
 than in the lists of those working in the central ap-
 paratus.  The latter lists are composed mostly of un-
 known or little-known figures, all below the Central
 Committee level, who have rise.i on the Cultural Revo-
 lution.  However, many PLA leaders -- both commanders
 and political officers, when last seen -- have been

 identified on these lists; more than one-third of the
 thus-far identified cadres of the central Party appara-
 tus are known to be PLA officers, and as  any as half
 may be.  It seems apparent that Lin means to have PLA
 ^en in at least the sensitive departments of the central
 Party apparatus.
 One such department is the reconstructed poli-
 tical security department under whatever name.*  Known
 and suspected political security specialists appear on
 Peking's lists of those working in the central Party
 apparatus; some of them are ALA officers.  Moreover,
 the PLA political officers identified on these lists
 are experienced in similar work and some have probably
 been assigned to this area in the apparatus.  Lin is
 ,well aware, from Mao's experience in the years before
 the Cultural Revolution, of the importance of having
 one's own men in political security work -- if not
 directing it, then watching from above and below those
 who do direct it.
 Others identified on Peking's lists for the
 central apparatus have been specialists in united front
 work, liaison, and economic organizational work.  No
 cadres from the old organization and propaganda depart-
 ments have been identified, but, again, the PLA poli-
 tical officers can easily be redirected to these kinds
 of work, and some probably have been.

 of the Cultural Revolution; the Military Region head-
 quarters became the only regional authorities, while
 the provincial committees were replaced provisionally
 by provincial "revolutionary committees."  Beginning
 in early 1967, these committees were directed to form
 Party "core groups" which in turn were to reconstruct
 full-scale Party committees.  These Party committees,
 when formed, were to operate within the "revolutionary
 committees," and were to exercise "absolute leadership"
 within them.   In other words, the Party committee was
 to use the established machinery of the revolutionary
 committee, and was to be the stable and controlling
 element.*
 The PLA members of the revolutionary committees
 have apparently taken the lead in forming these "core
 groups," which, to judge from the few known examples,
 have normally been composed of the leaders of the exist-
 ing revolutionary committees.  The composition of the
 core groups has reportedly had to be approved by the
 national leadership in Peking -- notably by the central
 CRG, although it seems likely that the MAC also has a
 voice.  The composition of the Party committees must
 also be approved by the central CRG -- and again,,
 probably, by the MAC -- before the committee can begin
 to operate.
 Many counties -- more than 100 -- have produced
 approved Party committees, but as of aid-December only
 one province had done no.  The process of forming these
 committees has moved very slowly -- in part because
 Mao and Lin have emphasized that these committees are
 to be composed of true Maoists, and it is necessary

 for the three components of the revolutionary commit-
 tees (the military, the old Party cadres, and the mass
 representatives) to agree among themselves as to which
 of themselves are the most true.  Beyond this, it seems
 likely that some agreements have been reached but have
 then been rejected by Peking.   Such rejections ^ay
 reflect differences in Peking itself, e.g., between
 the CRG and the MAC.
 There are members of the CCP Central Committee
 in all three categories -- military, cadres, and mass --
 in almost every one of the provinces.  The selections
 for the Central Committee were reportedly made (in
 early 1969) by the central CRG, the body which has to
 approve the composition of the provincial Party com-
 mittees.   It was apparently the CRG's intention -- ap-
 proved by Mao and Lin -- to have its selections for
 the Central Committee serve in the Party core group
 in each province and to be named then as the core of
 the full-scale Party c..mmittee.   in other words, the
 same people -- the CRG at the top, and the Central
 Committee members in the provinces -- were to dominate
 the process from start to finish.
 There is no single category which now dominates
 the provincial revolutionary committees.   "Military
 men" dominate most of them, but these are divided into
 career militay commanders and career political officers.
 The others are headed, with few exceptions, by career
 Party-machine men who are now acting as political of-
 ficers.
 In choosing the heads of the provincial Party
 committees, there are three possible strategies.  One
 is to return to the pre-1954 emphasis, in which men
 who were  rima~~ril~y militay  leaders took regional or
 provincialParty posts as their second posts.   (Lin
 Piao himself, in the period 1949-54, was the commander
 of the Central-South Military Region and of the great
 4th Field Army,and was concurrently first secretary
 of the Party's Central-South Bureau.)  Another r.i to

 as leaders in the Party apparatus -- were installed as
 the first secretaries of Party regional bureaus or
 provincial committees and took as their second posts
 those of first political officers of the military re-
 gions and districts.  Peking could do this now, by
 naming civilian Party figures (acceptable old Party
 cadres) to head all of the new provincial Party com-
 mittees and assigning them as political officers con-
 currently.  The third course would be to name as the
 heads of the new provincial Party committees -- as the
 heads of the "revolutionary committees" are now -- a
 ^ix of people, some primarily military commanders,
 some primarily political officers, and some primarily
 civilian Party cadres.*
 This third course will probably be chosen.  The
 first two categories combined will probably be, then
 as now, much larger than the third.  (There ^ay be two
 or three mass representatives, a fourth category, in-
 stalled as First Secretaries.)  Thus men identified
 primarily with the PLA will dominate most of the pro-
 vincial Party committees.
 In the present situation, the principle of Party
 "control" of the ^ilitar y is expressed chiefly as
 ^ilitar  Party control of the military, through the
 military Party committees running up to the MAC.  This
 will probably be true for some time to come.   If as
 expected military commanders are chosen to head some
 of the new provincial Party committees, Mao and Lin may

 post will dispose of more power than three or four
 lesser posts as simple secretaries or standing com-
 mittee members.

 choose to improve appearances immediately, and prepare
 the ground for a transfer of allegiance eventually,
 by requiring them to divest themselves of their mili-
 tary titles and uniforms.*              This would not be necessary,
 in the cases of men who are to be both provincial Party
 secretaries and political officers.
 One simple solution would be to name the poli-
 tical officer as the first secretary and the military
 commander as his senior deputy, in which case both
 could continue as PLA officers concurrently with their
 Party roles.  This arrangement, which would not pose
 the problem of the military commander as first secre-
 tary, has been noted in a few instances at the county
 level.**
 **Of the one provincial Party committee thus far
 announced (Hunan, not the seat of an MR headquarters),
 the first secretary is an old Party cadre who had been
 the acting chairman of the revolutionary committee,
 the next-ranking secretary is a career political of-
 ficer who has been first political officer of the
 Hunan ND for the past year or so, and the deputy
 secretary is a career military commander who has been
 commander of that MD for the past two years or?-so.
 Only this third-ranking secretary is regarded as a
 protege of Lin's.  The three are ranked in the Party
 hierarchy precisely as they have been ranked -- one,
 two, three -- in the press for several months, a
 pattern that may be followed in other provinces.

 It is not clear, however, that Mao and Lin are
 ready to emphasize the primacy of the "civilian" Party
 apparatus at this time. Some military commanders may
 simply take over the Party committees concurrently
 (like Lin in 1949-54) and may wear a third hat as chair-
 man of the "revolutionary committee" and even a fourth
 as head of the military Party committee.   In such in-
 stances, these commanders would continue to be respon-
 sible to two hierarchies -- the military Party system
 answerable to the MAC and the "civilian" (really mixed)
 Party system said to be answerable primarily to the
 central CRG.   Peking would have to take care to ensure
 that the same orders are passed down the two chains of
 command.  Moreover, in the absence of a regional Party
 organization, the Party committee of a Military Region
 headquarters would presumably be superior to all pro-
 vincial Party committees; so Peking would have to work
 out some system to prevent conflict between those
 military Party committees and the provincial committees,
 the military members of sh ich would have to obey the
 MR Party organization.
 As noted previously, at present the revolution-
 ary committee of every province in which a Military
 Region headquarters is located is chaired by either
 the military commander or the political officer of
 that MR, apparently to facilitate the control of all
 developments in these critical centers of power.  While
 Lin and other military leaders may feel secure on this
 point now (with the mass organizations under control),
 this consideration may persist for a time.  If no, the
 military men chosen as heads of the new provincial Party
 committees may be mainly from this group.  And if no,
 most will probably be proteges of Lin Piao.

 VIII.  Lin's Prospects
 Mao, now 77, may die or become incapacitated at
 any time, but he may conceivably last for some years
 yet (he might decide to live forever), and Lin's own
 health is not robust.   Lin, although only 63, might
 die first, or might die soon after becoming Party
 chairman.  Assuming that Lin does outlast Mao for a
 substantial period, his prospects seem fairly good
 for holding the post as long as his health holds.*  He
 would seem, at least, to have more going for him than
 :lily one else has, and more than outside observers have
 generally been willing to credit to him.
 Lin Without Mao:   In considering Lin as the suc-
 cessor, one must begin from the recognitioi of what
 he has accomplished in recent years.  He has trans-
 formed the PLA, from its state of uneven competence and
 low morale in 1959, into a formidable force and in-
 strument.   In the Cultural Revolution, he has accomplished
 the almost incredible feat of massively purging the PLA
 at the same time that he has used it successfully as
 Tile prinal instrument of the Revolution.   Such a man
 has got to be taken seriously.
 *If his health does not hold and he and Mao both
 die in the next few years, Chou En-lai and Huang Yung-
 sheng will probably be the dominant figures.  A Chou-
 Huang alliance might soon lead to the suppression of
 the civilian radicals of the central CRG.   If Chou
 too dies, the military leaders around Huang will prob-
 ably dictate the choice of a successor, but there does
 not seem to be any individual after Chou so outstand-
 ing as to be acclaimed the Leader; thus a collective
 would be likely.

 It is true that Lin has never in his adult life
 been without Mao, the source of his authority and as-
 surance.   It is probably also true that Lin, without
 Mao, would never have dared to make the demands on
 the PLA that he has made.   And it is probably further
 true that, if Mao had not been standing behind Lin,
 the PLA would not have responded as it has.  In other
 words, it seems likely that only Mao, among Chinese
 leaders, can command such awe that heavily-armed men
 will meekly accept their ruin at his hands, and that
 other heavily-armed men will try persistently to carry
 out policies which can result in their own ruin if
 anything goes wrong or if the great man changes his
 mind.
 But it does not follow from this that Lin will
 simply come apart when Mao goes, or will soon be blown
 away.    Lin seems to be made of sterner stuff than that,
 and to have more assets than that.   Even if it is Mao's
 will rather than Lin's which is commanding, Lin will
 begin with Mao's clear and emphatic mandate.  He will
 also benefit from the common interest of Chinese leaders
 in appearing at a time of crisis to be unified and to
 be moving forward with confidence.   He will have his
 record in the Cultural Revolution, which should inspire
 at least respect and caution.  And he will have what
 seem to be formidable organizational assets and un-
 equalled opportunities to increase them.
 Lin and Chou:  The most critical relationship
 would seem to be   at with Chou En-lai, if both Lin
 and Chou last.  Lin seems to need Chou badly -- as by
 far the most intelligent and able man in the leader-
 ship, with the best record as a  manager of all kinds
 of affairs.  Unlike the other members of the Politburo
 standing committee, Chou can do many things for Lin
 that Lin cannot do for himself. (Chen Po-ta could of
 course be useful, to help Lin to formulate his version
 of Mao's "thought," and Kang Sheng could of course be
 useful, to the degree that Lin were willing to let a
 man not close to himself do his police work for him;

 but Chou seems really indispensable, as the only member
 of the super-elite with any substantial knowledge of
 the non-Communist world and of the economy.)  And Chou
 would seem at least for a while to need Lin, as the
 holder of the mandate and as a Maoist protector against
 those elements of the leadership who may feel now, or
 come to feel, that Chou is not a true Maoist.   Thus it
 would seem likely that, while their predispositions
 differ, they would get along the way Mao and Chou have
 got along:  Lin would value Chou for the many reasons
 that he should, Chou would work within the boundaries
 set by Lia, and they would oe a stron?   artnership.
 It is true that calculations of mutual need have
 sometimes been mistaken.*  And there id a potential for
 serious conflict in the Lin-Chou relationship.   The
 main reason for thinking so is not that Chou is likely
 to challenge Lin, but that Lin's tendency is to be
 suspicious and mistrustful; he seems to trust compara-
 -tively few people.  Chou has seemed to be established
 as one of those few, but this could change.  With Mao
 gone, the very popular Chou, believed to be more popular
 than Lin even with PLA leaders, and the only Chinese
 leader with the stature to challenge Lin, might be seen
 increasingly by an insecure and apprehensive Lin as
 *About ten years ago, surveying the visibly troubled
 Chinese leadership in the wake of the Leap Forward and
 commune programs and the split with Moscow, the present
 writer tried to guess which of Mao's lieutenants -- among
 the many who had reason to wish for another leader --
 might be disposed to challenge him.   In considering
 Liu Shao-chi and his proteges, it was concluded that
 Mao and Liu would need each other for mutual protection
 against other elements of the leadership whose record
 in recent years had been better.  As is now well known,
 soon after that time Liu among others began to work
 against Mao; and Mao, after transferring his base of
 power to tht. PLA, slid not need Liu.

 the central figure of a military-moderate cabal work-
 ing against himself and all true Maoists.
 On balance, the probability seems to be for a
 continuing good relationship between Lin and Chou, who
 are not expected to divide sharply on policy.  The
 possibility of a deterioration is simply one of the
 many factors in the picture of the Chinese leadership
 that require a continuing assessment.*
 Lin, Chen and Kan g.  Lin's relations with the
 other two ^em ers of   e Politburo standing committee,
 Chen Po-ta and Kang Sheng, will probably continue to
 be strained in some respects -- at leabt, less amiable
 than with Chou.  Lin seems more likely, now and in the
 future, to work with Chou to limit tie influence of Chen
 and Kang, than to work with Chen and/or Kang to limit
 the influence of Chou. As noted above, however, there
 is a chance that Lin will come to distrust Chou after
 Mao's death, and in this event Lin might regard Chen
 and Kang, if still in place, as the true Maoists at
 his side.
 If Chen, now missing, has fallen from Mao's
 favor and a Vacancy has been created on the Politburo
 standing committee, Lin will probably do his best to

 the other, Chou seems to be trying to arrange a purge
 of Lin's proteges in the PLA, or Lin seems to be trying
 to surround and bind Chou with  unqualified military
 ^en, one might reasonably forecast a showdown struggle
 after Mao goes.  There is, however, no present evidence
 of this.

 place one of his own proteges -- one would suppose
 Huang Yung-sheng -- on it.  This would appear to
 give Lin effective control of the standing committee
 -- himself, Chou, and Huang or some other protege --
 at the time of Mao's death without the need for
 making changes in the leadership at an already agitated
 time.   If Lin cannot manage this now, he and Chou will
 probably act together to change the composition of the
 standing committee soon after Mao's death.
 The Politburo:   If the politburo is to be a
 voting body,    n w  l probably be able to dominate it
 even without changing it.  The chances tro, however,
 that it will not be a genuine voting body under Lin,
 just as it has not been under Mao.  Lin will probably
 make much greater use of it as a discussion group, in
 which various points of view are heard and considered.
 Chou En-lai will probably prevail on Lin to add some
 economic specialists to the Politburo.
 The Military Leaders:  The Chinese military
 leadership w     continue to constitute Lin's principal
 base of power, as the men he can call upon to enforce
 his decisions.   Lin will almost certainly continue to
 dominate the central military leadership through the
 three critical organs, the Military Affairs Committee,
 its administrative unit, and the General Staff.  This
 domination will depend on the continued fidelity of a
 handful of Lin's longtime proteges and close associates,
 especially Huang Yung-sheng, the second-ranking military
 leader (who has a share in several of Lin's key proteges
 and has others of his own).   In this connection, Lin
 is probably right about his military comrades -- that
 is, that while most of them are not Maoists to the
 degree that Lin is, they will nevertheless be loyal
 to him.
 It is probably true that most military leaders
 have mixed feelings about Lin, and that he has alienated

 lifelong military man who is most comfortable with
 other military men, he has been above all faithful to
 Mao.  This has meant unwavering support of Mao in his
 periodic purges, humiliations and reindoctrinations
 of the PLA.   However, the surviving members of the
 central military leadership are for the most part men
 whom Lin has favored for many years and has advanced
 and protected in the Cultural Revolution, men who
 have reason to be loyal to him.   So long as Lin does
 not make demands on these men so extreme that they
 cannot be met, and does not threaten or attempt to
 carry out another great purge for failure to meet such
 demands, a revolt by the central military leadership
 seems quite unlikely.*  If, however, Lin were to make
 extreme demands and threaten or begin to carry out
 such a purge -- if, in other words, he were to behave
 just like Mao -- there would seem to be a strong pos-
 sibility of a coup by his own proteges.  That is to
 say:  there is undoubtedly a limit to what can be
 demanded of any group of men, and the limit has prob-

 Lin have constructed an elaborate system of mutual
 surveillance to prevent such an attempt against them-

 be reliable.  That is, a successful conspiracy would
 probably require the participation of a substantial
 number of officers -- to seize and hold strategic

 treatment in return -- the chances are that he could
 not get away with it.
 The most important military leaders outside
 Peking are also men who have reason to be loyal to
 Lin, and to remain so except in an extreme situation.
 Lin will probably continue to think it important to
 dominate the 11. Military Region headquarters -- the
 centers of real power outside Peking -- through his
 proteges there.   He may be acting now, or may act
 soon, to place more of his proteges in the Peking MR

 side chance of a rebellion by one of these regional
 commands, but no regional center could hold out for

 would be expected only if some part of the center were
 to lead the way.  More of Lin's proteges will probably
 appear as commanders of Military Districts as well as
 MRs, but this level of power is not critical, and Lin
 will not try to blanket the MDs with his men.

 remain of much  ess Importance in the structure of

 probably retain control over the research and develop-

 apparatus.  PLA officers will probably take over
 -- whether as PLA officers or as civilians -- a number
 of the ministries.*  In general, Lin probably will
 not try to install his proteges throughout the state
 machinery, but will rely heavily on Chou En-lai to keep
 him informed and on the reconstructed Party apparatus

 within the state machinery to supervise and direct it.
 This will probably be true at the provincial level too;
 that is, Lin will probably not aim at the chairmanships
 of revolutionary committees per se, but will seek to
 place proteges at the heads Ut e emerging Party com-
 mittees in the most important provinces, some o  whom
 may head the revolutionary committees concurrently.
 The Emerging Part% A  aratus:  The now emerging
 central Party apparatus 0010w the Politburo level) will
 steadily increase in importance, and within a few years
 will rival the MAC and the rest of the military Party
 apparatus as a power system.  Lin can be expected to
 supervise closely the reconstruction of this apparatus.
 It seems very likely that Lin will try to change the
 composition of the de facto Party secretariat, if he
 has not already done so.  Those added will probably be
 PLA figures, now in the MAC and its subordinate bodies,
 who in recent years have acquired additional skills.
 As the central Party apparatus subordinate to
 the secretariat gets sorted out, proteges of Lin will
 very probably appear at the top level, while proteges
 of his proteges (other PLA leaders) will probably ap-
 pear at lower levels.  As a general proposition, the
 strength of Lints men in the apparatus seems likely to
 increase in strength as the apparatus itself increases.
 Lin will probably make a special effort to get control
 of the political security department -- as vital to his
 survival -- or at least to restrict its role in the
 affairs of the PLA.  Lin will almost certainly put his
 own man at the head of this department after Mao's death.
 As the Party committee system in the provinces
 get reconstructed, proteges of Lin will probably be
 well represented there too.  Most of the new Party com-
 mittees will probably be headed by men who either remain
 organizationally a part of the PLA or at least have
 made their careers in the PLA.  Lin may experience some
 difficulty in bringing such men to identify themselves
 with, and respond smoothly to, a reconstructed Party
 apparatus.  However, Lin does not seem to see organiza-
 tional loyalty as the central problem.  That is, what

 Lin wants is what Mao has wanted -- lieutenants whose
 allegiance is primarily to himself, not to an abstract
 "PLA" or "Party."
 Lin as a "True Maoist":  Lin has been previously
 been described, In the   rs  paper in this series and
 in this one, as a "true Maoist."  The essential char-
 acteristic of the true Maoist -- exemp.ified by Lin
 above all others -- has been his loyalty to Mao person-
 ally, his identification with Mao in all circumstances,
 his willingness to subordinate his own interest to Mao's,
 and in particular his readiness to take the blame for
 Mao'. mistakes.  (For many years, those who have attempted
 to place the responsibility for failure on Mao's policies,
 rather than on their own misunderstanding or faulty
 execution, have been purged.)  And the Cultural Revolu-
 tion has been in fact -- rather then in theory -- con-
 cerned above all with examining and testing this loyalty
 to Mao personally, not to any body of doctrine,  In
 this  sense, all of the members of the Politburo stand-
 ing committee, including Chou En-lai, and most of Peking's
 other current leaders, have been true Maoists.
 The term "true Maoist" has also implied, however,
 a high degree of acceptance of Mao's "thought."  (This
 has been clearly implied in another term used to describe
 Lin -- "reliable revolutionary successor," which it was
 the declared purpose of the Cultural Revolution to pro-
 duce.)              At the center of this "thought" has been not
 so much a set of ideological propositions as a faith
 -- in the eventual perfectibility of the Party cadre,
 and in his ability to transform even common men.   In
 practice, the "thought" calls for unremitting political
 indoctrination, which instills moral incentives and
 produces the indomitable revolutionary will.  The will
 thus produced in the cadres, and to a lesser degree in
 the masses, is mobilized in great campaigns -- whether
 destructive, like the campaigns against counter-revo-
 lutionaries, or constructive, like the Leap Forward and
 "people's commune" programs, or both, like the Cultural
 Revolution.  The aim of these campaigns is to create

 a new Chinese society, egalitarian, austere, and self-
 purifying through class struggle, which is to serve
 as the model and liberating instrument for other peoples.
 Because Mao's own predispositions are radical
 and militant, calling for maximum advance on a revolu-
 tionary line, Mao's "thought" is sometimes equated with
 just these features of his thought.  However, Mao's
 "thought" does provide for periods of retreat and con-
 solidation, sobriety and caution.  His leadership for
 many years has shown this pattern: of militant advance
 until such time as the real world (e.g., human nature,
 or Soviet and American military strength) compels a
 retreat.  He is skilled in retreating:  no other head
 of any Communist Party has shown such an ability to
 survive as has Mao.  Observers who have failed to
 recognize that retreat and consolidation are also fea-
 tures of Mao's "thought" have sometimes incorrectly
 concluded, in periods of retreat and consolidation,
 that Mao was no longer the leader.
 The "true Maoists" among Mao's lieutenants -- in
 the sense of those loyal to him personally, whether in
 advance or retreat--have seemed to be divided among
 themselves in an important way.  On one hand, there are
 those who associate themselves most happily with periods
 of militant advance, and on the other those who seem
 to work beat in an atmosphere of sobriety and caution.
 Lin Piao's predispositions have seemed to be, like Mao's,
 radical and militant.   Most other Party leaders, in-
 cluding Chou En-lai and almost all of the military
 leaders, have seemed to be less no.  Chou in particular,
 and the military leaders for the most part, have seemed
 to serve Mao well even in periods of militant advance,
 but their preference has seemed to be for the less glar-
 ing colors in the spectrum of Mao's thought.
 while Lin might soon be deposed or forced to make
 substantial modifications in Mao's policies, he would
 begin as a "true Maoist radical."  This formulation has
 proved misleading for some readers, when taken as imply-
 ing that Lin accepts only the radical features of Mao's

 thought, that he is a partisan of blind, insensate
 militancy, and that he would immediately initiate
 radical policies where they did not already exist.
 Lin in fact has subscribed to the full range of
 Mao's "thought," has associated himself when neces-
 sary with periods of retreat and consolidation,
 might find himself in such a period (like the pre-
 sent period) at the time of his succession, and
 might well remain in it or even initiate such a
 period if not already in it.
 Yet the formulation "true Maoist radical" was
 intended to convey a sense of Lin's predisposition to
 be radical and militant:  that is, to be more inclined
 to initiate radical policies, to push them harder,
 and to stay with them longer, than would either a
 "non-Maoist" or a relatively conservative leader like
 Chou and the military men.  The present survey of
 Lin's proteges and peers does not sees to discredit
 the proposition that Lin is more radical and militant
 than most of those men are.  It does, however, qualify
 the conclusion -- implied in the formulation "true
 Maoist radical" -- that Lin's predispositions are
 fully as radical and militant as Mao's own.
 The survey suggests that they may not be.
 Because the question must be answered:  why does Lin
 seem to prefer the relatively conservative leaders
 like Chou and the military men, over the more radical
 and militant types tike the leaders of the Cultural
 Revolution Group?*  One possible answer -- assuming
 that he does indeed prefer Chou and the military --
 is that he does not see Chou and the military as
 posing any threat to him personally, whereas he does
 see the Cultural Revolution Group types as posing such
 a threat.   But another possible answer is that Lin's
 *Some observers would any that this is a false ques-
 tion, that he does not prefer these men, but is forced
 to work with them.

 emphatic association with the most radical and militant
 features of Mao's thought -- so that he seems clearly
 in the "radical" camp when the leadership is divided
 on those lines -- reflects not so much his own predis-
 position as his sense of what loyalty to Mao entails.
 That is, when Mao clearly favors a "radical" line, Lin
 feels obliged to state his own favor in even stronger
 terms; and when Mao fails to make his position clear,
 as is often the case, Lin feels obliged to state his
 own position in terms which he knows to be in  accord
 with Mao's predisposition.  This is perhaps the true
 meaning of Lin's notorious formulations to the effect
 that he and others will faithfully carry out Mao's
 policies "even when we do not understand them."
 Abiding features of Maoism in practice -- the
 emphasis on absolute loyalty to the leader personally,
 the absolute responsibility borne by the cadre, the
 critical importance of political indoctrination and
 moral incentive, the imperative of class struggle,
 the inescapable need for great national campaigns
 aimed at extracting the maximum from the human
 material -- can and probably will continue under Lin,
 as will the examinations and purges which inevitably
 accompany all of this.  Rut it is possible to continue
 on these lines without reaching the extremes which
 Mao has reached in the past 15 years.  It is possible,
 in other words, to follow a Maoist course but to
 impose less of a burden on the human material,  to
 place less strain on one's personal relationships
 with other leaders, to begin the periods of retreat
 and consolidation earlier, and to remain in them
 longer.  Those leaders whom Lin seems to like best
 -- Chou and the military men -- are expected to in-
 fluence his in this direction, the more easily if
 his predispositions are indeed less extreme than
 Mao's.
 It has also been contended in this paper that
 Lin's self-interest coincides with the course that his
 friends and favorites are likely to urge on him:  that
 is, that he cannot behave as Mao In his manic periods
 has behaved, without a high risk of being overthrown.

 This does not mean that Lin's policies will not be
 onerous for the Chinese or offensive to other coun-
 tries; they certainly will be.   Indeed, as other
 observers have remarked, it may be harder for Lin
 to make a sudden reversal of a militant policy -- say,
 Mao's presen  policy toward the Russians -- than it
 would have been for Mao, because he will not have
 Mao's stature and prestige.   But even Mao did not
 pursue his extreme policies to a suicidal end, and
 Lin seems even less likely to do no.
 If the two judgments expressed above are
 correct -- that Lin will take counsel from Chou
 and from his own military comrades, and for this
 reason and others will conduct himself with a decent
 regard for the real world -- Lin should be able to
 survive for some time as Mao's successor.  The length
 of time cannot be forecast, because it depends on
 factors -- and the interaction of factors -- which
 cannot be assessed at this time.*  These include the
 state of Lin's health at the time of succession, his
 progress toward solving China's problems through what-
 ever combination of policies, and the willingness of
 Chinese leaders to be content with something less than
 total solutions.
 *Many observers have concluded that Lin is not
 credible as a long-term successor.   It is not hard
 to agree with this judgment, because Lin himself
 does not seem to have the prospect of a long term;
 it would be surprising if he were to live out the
 decade.
