 North Korea:  Kim Chong-il in Charge
 Summary

 manages North Korea's day-to-day affairs, although his father apparently
 retains control over foreign policy.  The  ounger Kim's long-term
 survivability is more problematic.
 Kim Chong-il appears to be responsible for several new policy
 directions.  He wants to modernize his country, for example, and probably
 is behind limited efforts at economic reform, but he is having trouble
 overcoming the inertia inherent in North Korea's rigid bureaucratic
 structure.  He hopes to attract Western capital to North Korea, suggesting
 he may have pushed for the joint venture law passed in 1984, but he is
 uncomfortable around foreigners and knows little about the West except
 what he learns from movies and television.
 This memorandum was prepared by Office of East Asian Analysis, and ~
 Office of Leadership Analysis.  Information available as of 25 June 1986 was
 used in its preparation.  Comments and queries are welcome and may be directed to the

 Among his international contacts, Kim Chong-il prefers the Chinese
 over the Soviets, but on policy issues recognizes the importance of good
 relations with Moscow and apparently has not blocked stronger bilateral
 ties.  We have only limited information on Kim Chong-il's views on
 reunification of the peninsula, but the little we do know suggests it may
 not be the all-consuming goal it has been for Kim II-song. ~~
 The Transition Takes Shape
 continue to quote both Kims as authorities for policy guidance and ideological
 inspiration; Kim II-song, in fact, appears at more important public affairs than his son.
 Nevertheless, it is clear                                             that Kim
 Chong-il is assuming an increasingly prominent role and has taken over many of his
 father's responsibilities:

 It is also clear, however, from the evidence available that Kim Chong-il remains
 loyal to his father.  For most of his public and private life, Kim Chong-il--even more
 25X1
 than other North Koreans--has been dominated by his father's views.
 the son's political education consisted largely of observing,     25X1

 Kim Chong-il has had virtually no contact with anyone challenging the official line.
 Moreover, the pervasiveness of his father's insistence on conformity appears to have
 impeded, and perhaps prevented, the emer ence of rival courtiers who could fan rivalry
 between father and son.                   Kim II-song, for his part, views Kim                25X1

 The steady drumbeat of public adulation for both Kims is designed to prepare the
 North Korean populace for the dynastic succession, and the little we know about North
 Korean political dynamics suggests that Kim Chong-il possesses all the levers of power

 ?  Defense Minister 0 Chin-u, Kim II-song's old comrade-in-arms who is ranked
 third in the leadership, reportedly is Kim Chong-il's leading factotum.  His
 obsessive flattery of Kim Chong-il belies his status as Kim's elder.
 O is genuinely dedicated to the succession, although his fawning
 behavior could well mask other plans, possibly an intention to push the son aside
 once the father dies.  The military would be best placed to take over if Kim
 Chong-il stumbles, but we have no evidence suggesting OChin-u is not loyal to
 his masters.
 ?   Ho Tam, Premier Kang Song-san, and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam are among
 the younger leaders most sources claim owe their positions to Kim Chong-il.  In
 addition, one US scholar has noted that 83 percent of the Politburo and 57
 percent of the Central Committee that emerged from the last Party Congress
 (when the son became the official heir) belong to this younger generation and
 persumably are beholden to Kim Chong-il.
 as the emerging and
 future head of North Korea, he will demonstrate many of the characteristics that have
 marked his father's leadership.  Like Kim II-song, he is a micromanager who intervenes
 in every project, taking an ad hoc approach to managing events:
 ?  Kim works 19 to 20 hours a day and demands his staff work in shifts around the
 clock.
 ?   The slightest deviation from his orders can result in demotion or imprisonment.
 For example, Kim had his brother-in-law (an architect) exiled to a minor rural
 post because he introduced slight modifications to Kim's design of an aquarium.
 ?   On the other hand, Kim Chong-il is lavish in his attention to his favorites, and,
 often on the spur of the moment, will promote officials who please him,
 regardless of the bureaucratic chain of command.

 despite his power, he is an
 insecure man whose need for constant and uncritical admiration almost certainly reflects
 underlying doubts about his own self-worth.  Although                    he realizes
 public displays of affection are insincere, his desire for adoration makes him susceptible
 to syncophancy.                   he does not let flattery change his decisions on
 key policy issues, but we believe it may, at times, impair his ability to make objective
 assessments.   While Kim Chong-il is a political pragmatist, he also can act on impulse,
 makins~ rash decisions or promises he later forgets completely.
 Policy Priority:  Economic Modernization
 Kim is already using his authority to try to change selected North Korean policies.
 P'yongyang's press campaigns clearly identify Kim Chong-il's preference for technical
 experts over ideological zealots to implement his push for development of light industry
 and to improve the standard of living.                              a "general
 understanding" among party and government officials that Kim Chong-il is attempting to
 correct his father's economic mistakes--although no one refers to any of Kim II-song's
 "mistakes" in front of either Kim.  The younger Kim reportedly wants to open North
 Korea to new economic methods and to adapt Chinese economic reforms.  Kim's
 interest in modernization suggests he may have been behind P'yongyang's joint venture
 law, passed in 1984 and patterned after the Chinese model.  This law is designed to
 attract Western technology and capital.  We believe North Korean media calls for
 increased reliance on technical expertise in industry is evidence that Kim Chong-il's
 reform efforts are under way.
 Kim's modernization policies will face a variety of roadblocks, perhaps most
 important his own management style, which will dissuade even senior officials from
 offering candid advice and no doubt stunt initiative in the bureaucratic ranks.  Other
 factors that will hold back his efforts probably include:
 ?  Raw material shortages.
 enterprises are reluctant to share scarce resources, and do so only when Kim
 Chong-il orders them to.
 ?   A bureaucratic obsession with security.  For example, while Kim Chong-il
 reportedly is behind the public North Korean effort to promote a tourist industry,
 he has commented that the great number of closed military areas in North Korea
 will prevent the country from attracting many foreigners.
 Failure of expensive, highly publicized public works projects also could set back
 modernization efforts, and might weaken Kim Chong-il as well.  For example
 the Nampo lock gate--a major project personally
 supervised by Kim--is constructed on an inadequate foundation and is settling rapidly.
 problems there might reflect badly on Kim Chong-il.

 Foreign Policy
 Although change in North Korean economic policy is possible under Kim
 Chong-il's guidance, we expect continuity in foreign policy, at least over the short term,
 in part because Kim Chong-il-                        -has less to do with
 international affairs than with other aspects of North Korean affairs.
 Kim is uneasy around foreigners, a fact substantiated by press coverage that
 makes it clear that Kim II-song, but not his son, greets foreign visitors.  While the elder
 Kim often receives gifts personally, his son almost always receives them only after they
 have first been handed to a "responsible official."  Pro-Pyongyang Koreans living in
 Japan have reported that, while they can expect an audience with Kim II-song, they
 probably cannot expect to meet his son.  Kim Chong-il's apparent xenophobia could well
 be associated with his need for uncritical adoration.  His reluctance to meet foreigners
 probably reflects less his fear of non-Koreans than his concern about entering a
 situation that would expose his lack of knowledge or ability to handle himself on an
 international stage.
 North Korea                         is now doing all it can to improve
 relations with Tokyo and Washington.  The North may believe its role in the North-South

 way toward meeting
 US conditions for direct contacts.

 believes the United States will be unresponsive as long as President Reagan is in office.
 ~
 25X1
 The defectors report Kim Chong-il considers the United States and Japan
 "fantasy islands," presumably because of their wealth, but perhaps also because he
 absorbs so much of what he knows about the outside world from Western films and
 television.                          for example, he believes capitalists are like the
 gangsters he has seen on film.  But given his interest in modernization and reform we
 believe it is reasonable to expect Kim Chong-il will continue present efforts to improve
 economic ties to the West and may be willing to open North Korea to limited doses of
 Western culture. ~~
 A major feature of North Korean foreign policy over the past two years has been
 improving ties to the Soviet Union, and we expect Kim Chong-il will stay that course,
 despite his personal preference for the Chinese.  He lived in China as a child, and
 has great regard for Deng Xiaoping and Hu
 Yaobang.                                      Kim has referred to the Soviets as
 "barbarians" and "hairy armed animals."                     Kim Chong-il has
 little regard for East European "beggar nations" with the exception of Romania--perhaps
 because it is the only other Communist country with dynastic pretensions or because it
 isis t~ly East European country to cultivate a relationship with North Korea.)

 The differences in Kim's treatment by Moscow and Beijing may both reflect his    25X1
 preferences and reinforce them.  Kim was enteftained lavishly when he visited China in
 1983, but he has yet to visit the USSR, and it is clear the Soviets are reluctant to
 recognize his succession publicly.  North Korean press reports of last December's visit
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/03/04 :CIA-RDP86T01017R000606160001-1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/03/04 :CIA-RDP86T01017R000606160001-1
 by Soviet Foreign Minister Schevardnadze highlighted the presence of father and son at
 the meetings.  Soviet reports, on the other hand, barely mentioned Kim Chong-il.
 Moreover, while Schevardnadze issued a public invitation to Kim II-song to come to the
 USSR, press coverage of his visit only noted that "other invitations" also were made,
 presumably a reference to Kim Chong-il.
 Despite widespread public and diplomatic speculation, Kim Chong-il did not head
 the North Korean delegation to the Soviet Communist Party Congress in February 1986.
 Explanations varied between those who thought the two sides had agreed that Kim
 would not receive the attention he deserved and others who argued there had been
 friction over protocol.  We believe the latter contention.  As early as September 1985,
 Soviet officials preferred Kim be only a
 member, rather than the head, of the delegation.
 25X1
 25X1
 We do not have a coherent picture based on plausible reporting to explain North
 Korea's current tilt toward the Soviets, but some of Kim Chong-il's statements0
 25X1
 confirm our speculation that it is motivated by practical considerations and
 2~x"I
 pique with the Chinese.  Kim Chong-il apparently shares
 25X1
 a general North Korean belief that Moscow is more reliable than Beijing as a source of
 economic and military aid.
 Although he has                     warm regard for
 the Chinese, he
 recognizes that Moscow "has the money."  In
 25X1
 addition, he complained
 about China's indirect trade with South Korea
 25X1
 and noted
 that fri tions over t e economic relationship are damaging Sino-North Korean
 relations.
 25X1
 In view of Kim Chong-il's realistic appraisal of his country's reliance on Soviet
 aid, we do not believe his differences with Moscow pose an immediate threat to the
 blossoming Soviet-North Korean relationship.  We judge a Kim Chong-il visit to Moscow
 likely, perhaps this year.  In the longer run, the son could reverse his country's tilt
 toward Moscow if Western aid and Chinese-style reforms prove beneficial to the North's
 economy, and if he comes to perceive China as a more reliable source of economic aid.
 In addition, perceived personal slights by the Soviets could eventually affect Kim's view
 of the bilateral relationship.
 Korean reunification remains a key issue for Kim II-song,
 but the information we have on the younger Kim's views indicates he may not be as
 obsessed with it.                                               he has some
 doubts about the advantages of reunification, at the same dime highlighting his limited

 Chong-il is increasingly involved with policy toward the North-South dialogue.  We
 believe reunification will remain a powerful theme on both sides of the DMZ, and the

 younger Kim almost certainly will  a  it li  service to strengthen his claim to be his
 father's successor.  Kim once told             all South Korean intellectuals,
 advanced technology, and industria  ac ievements would become "his" once the
 peninsula was reunified, but he does not now appear interested in using force to
 achieve that goal.                        both he and his father have denied 0
 Chin-u permission to invade the South.  Nonetheless, pressure from military advisers
 probably will lead the younger Kim to reserve this option if economic modernization
 efforts founder and diplomatic initiatives fail to stem North Korea's declining fortunes.
 Could Things Change?
 The limited evidence we have suggests Kim Chong-il will indeed succeed his
 father and already is guiding an increasingly wide range of both domestic and foreign
 policy activity.  If opposition does exist in Pyongyang, it must be one of the best hidden
 political movements in the world.  We still know very little about North Korea, however,
 and cannot judge with confidence the political preferences of leaders who currently
 guard every word to prevent running afoul of Kim II-song and his son.
 Although the initial succession appears fairly secure, we believe Kim Chong-il's
 prospects for a long tenure will depend on his ability to maintain the loyalty of younger
 North Korean political and military leaders and--at the same time--to ameliorate his
 country's serious economic problems.  Indeed, the defectors doubt the younger Kim will
 be able to stay in power after his father is gone. They believe he lacks Kim II-song's
 charisma and that North Korea's troubled economy and repressive political system
 cannot hold together without the elder Kim.  We are inclined to believe the younger Kim
 initially will be able to consolidate his authority, and that any leaders opposed to him
 will need time to overcome their organizational disadvantage. lul
 We note the possibility that Kim Chong-il, who reportedly is a reckless driver and
 at one time had a drinking problem, could die before his father.  We believe the North is
 thoroughly unprepared for this eventuality; it would force Kim II-song to rethink
 completely North Korea's future.  The elder Kim would not only have to build an entirely

 Appendix:  Personal Data

 Kim Chong-il is devoted to the
 memory of his mother, who died when he was eight years old.  She is the object of yet
 another North Korean cult of personality.  Kim apparently resents his stepmother, Kim
 Song-ae.                          Kim Chong-il cuts her figure out of photographs.

 publicity surrounding the visit to North Korea of Romanian President Ceaucescu and his
 powertul wife, Elena.  Kim Song-ae's presence at official functions apparently was
 needed to balance the attention given to her Romanian counterpart.  Her pictures also
 were prominent in Romanian coverage of the Ceaucescus' 1985 visit to Pyongyang, but
 North Korean papers carried no pictures of her--presumably at the direction of Kim

 make himself look taller.  Although he encouraged                         new styles
 into North Korean clothing, he continues to wear Mao-style tunics, reportedly because
 he fears Western dress would make him look too fat.  Kim Chong-il once was a heavy
 drinker but cut back after warnings from his doctors.  He reportedly is imaginative and
