 0_% JAPAN-US:   Concern About Relations
 Prime Minister Nakasone has directed various government and
 party officials to develop proposals designed to ease strained
 relations with the US.
 Nakasone's efforts are aimed at his trip to Washington
 in mid-January.   On Tuesday he asked his cabinet to draw
 up measures to open Japan's markets further.  A press
 report states the new measures will feature tariff cuts
 ~        on some farm products and expansion of import quotas on
 ~
 others.
 The Prime Minister also assigned a task force of
 Liberal Democratic Party members to identify ways to
 ease trade friction.  According to the press, Nakasone
 last week told the Ministers of Trade and Foreign Affairs
 and the head of the Defense Agency to develop a unified
 government position on sharing defense technology with
 the US before his trip.
 In the meantime, a senior Foreign Ministry official
 will visit Washington next week to sound out US officials
 Comment:   Japanese leaders usually bring a "gift"
 to Washington in the form of concessions on some conten-
 tious issue.   Longtime supporters of farm interests are
 key members of Nakasone's administration and may be able
 to persuade farm groups to temper their opposition to
 lower import barriers.   Nakasone's view of Japan's
 defense role also is more compatible with Washington's,
 suggesting some agreement on sharing technology is pos-
 Although Nakasone has emphasized Japan has to re-
 solve outstanding problems with the US, he still operates
 under the same economic and political constraints as
 his predecessor.   The Finance Ministry will put pressure
 on Nakasone to limit the defense budget, and recent
 /     opinion polls show the public opposes increased defense
 tv    spending.   Farm interest groups have already met with
 the Prime Minister to warn him of their opposition to

 Foreign Minister Salim, who visits Washington next
 week, will be looking for a reaffirmation of US backing
 in pressing for the withdrawal of foreign forces.   His
 visit is aimed at exploring alternatives toward breaking
 the current deadlock over procedural arrangements for
 Lebanese-Israeli negotiations.
 Comment:   Salim's visit is largely a symbolic move
 v to keep up the momentum on efforts to solve Lebanon's
 problems.   President Jumayyil's government is upset by
 Israel's attempts to delay the beginning of withdrawal
 negotiations and believes only US pressure will secure
 concessions from Tel Aviv.   Without such concessions,
 the Lebanese believe they cannot persuade Syria or the
 PLO to begin withdrawal talks.
 President de la Madrid this week held an unprece-
 dented meeting with leaders of all registered opposition
 parties to develop broad support for his austerity pro-
 gram and to remove uncertainties concerning the change
 in government.   Rightist parties generally supported the
 austerity policies, while leftist groups protested that
 the measures favored the wealthy.   De la Madrid plans more
 such meetings to keep lines of communication open.
 Comment:   The meeting is similar to recent discus-
 sions with military leaders and businessmen and is
 primarily aimed at establishing de la Madrid's political
 dominance.   The President so far has given no indication
 he intends to expand the role opposition parties gained
 in the national legislature under former President Lopez
 Portillo's political reforms.   Opposition parties, how-
 ever, are likely to exploit de la Madrid's need for their

 CHINA:   People's Congress Adjourns
 The 15-day National People's Congress ended on
 schedule yesterday after adopting resolutions to ratify
 a new national constitution,  the five-year plan for
 1981-85, and the national budget for 1983.   Chinese
 media depicted the session as uniformly harmonious and
 thus far have abstained from the past practice of citing
 delegates' views that diverge from national policy.   fl
 Comment:   Although the documents ratified at the
 meeting further institutionalize policies promoted by
 Deng Xiaoping and his allies, the session was marked
 by apparent concessions to interests not wholly in step
 with the reform leadership.   Both the constitution and
 the economic plan are compromise documents.   Constitu-
 tional changes worked out since April, when a draft
 document was circulated, include a diminution of the
 formal powers of the newly established state president.

 j)WEST GERMANY - TURKEY:   OECD Aid Approved
 The long-delayed West German OECD aid pledge to
 Turkey has been approved by the necessary committees in
 the Bundestag.   The decision came after consideration of
 Foreign Minister Genscher's required report on the human
 rights situation in Turkey, following his brief trip to
 Ankara last month.   In addition to the aid package of
 approximately $170 million for project and project-related
 assistance and benefits for Turkish workers returning to
 Turkey, the committees approved $53.7 million in NATO
 Comment:   The aid vote succeeded despite the Social
 Democrats' continuing opposition to providing financial
 assistance to Turkey because of alleged undemocratic
 behavior and human rights violations.   There are no
 7           further obstacles to full West German participation in
 the Turkish aid consortium meeting that was rescheduled
 for 20 December to accommodate Bonn.   The action in the
 3           Bundestag also clears the way for Japan to announce its
 / own aid pledge.   Although Tokyo's contribution probably
 will be substantial, Ja an is unlikel   to exceed its
 pledge of last year.

 Baghdad's search for a face-saving end to the war continues
 to be frustrated by Tehran's apparent determination to maintain
 military pressure until President Saddam Hussein falls from power.
 Iraq forfeited the strategic initiative early in the war and, with
 it, the ability to control the scope, direction, and duration of
 the conflict.  Iraq's unwillingness to change its ineffective
 military strategy, its inability to initiate a serious mediation
 3    effort, and its increasing financial problems will combine to put
 even greater pressure on Baghdad through the winter.  The long-
 range advantage thus rests with Iran.  It is better able to bear
 the economic pressures and manpower losses.
 Saddam's overthrow remains the primary aim of Iran's
 clerical regime.   Secondary objectives include obtaining
 sizable reparations, condemning Iraq as the aggressor,
 repatriating Iraqi exiles, and forcing a total Iraqi with-
 3                   drawal from disputed border areas.   To some extent,  the
 war has become an end in itself for Iran because it unifies
 Iran is using its superior manpower resources to main-
 tain military pressure all along the front.   To continue
 this strategy, Ayatollah Khomeini recently issued a reli-
 gious edict calling on all able-bodied men to register for
 /   active service and to respond immediately if called by the
 military authorities.
 Assembly Speaker Rafsanjani last month boasted that some
 400,000 volunteers, have served at the front in the past year.
 ,   This suggests that as many as 200,000 volunteers may be at
 the front at any given time.   A force of this size,  if
 regularly augmented by volunteers, could maintain or even
 expand the scope of offensive operations against the Iraqis
 Under total mobilization,  Iran would have enough
 '   manpower to attempt a full-scale assault along several
 fronts.   On the other hand, it almost certainly cannot
 provide adequate command and control or logistic support
 to such a force.
 Top Secret
 11 December 1982
 Iran's next offensive, which could begin this month,
 probably will be directed against Iraqi forces in Iran
 west of Dezful.   It is likely to involve the equivalent
 of three regular divisions supplemented by irregulars.
 3            If the Iraqis are driven out,  the Iranians probably
 would then try to occupy additional Iraqi territory and
 threaten the key Baghdad - Al Amarah highway and the
 logistics center at Al Amarah.   F       -1
 Whatever the results, Iran is likely to continue
 its attacks--when weather permits--against remaining
 Iraqi enclaves in Iran.   By retaining the initiative,
 Iran can choose the time and location of each attack,
 keep the Iraqis off balance, and stretch Iraqi forces
 along the border.
 Baghdad's View of the War
 Saddam is willing to make almost any concession
 2     that would end the war without a loss of face.   Baghdad
 believes its search for a peaceful solution has been
 frustrated by continued foreign purchases of discounted
 Iranian oil and by sales of military equipment to Iran.
 The Iraqis apparently believe their best--and
 perhaps only--chance of success is to hold the Iranians
 at the border and make them pay a heavy price in lives
 ' and equipment.   Baghdad so far has been unwilling to
 launch even a probing attack across the border to disrupt
 Iranian plans.
 To exert economic pressure, Iraq will continue to
 use its advantage in airpower to carry out periodic
 attacks on merchant ships and Iran's oil terminal on
 Khark Island.   Unless driven to the point of complete
 3             desperation, however, Iraq probably will continue to
 resist the only military step likely to force a major
 change in the course of the conflict--a sustained,  full-
 scale air assault on Iranian oil facilities and oil
 Costs of the Conflict
 Iran's economy has suffered less than Iraq's, de-
 spite destruction of the port of Khorramshahr and much
 3            of the refinery at Abadan early in the war.   Tehran has
 since managed to divert shipping and refining operations
 to other facilities.
 As a result of price discounts, Tehran is selling
 three times more oil than the level at the time of Iraq's
 invasion.   Since the end of 1981,  Iran's liquid foreign
 2       exchange assets have risen from about $3 billion to over
 Iraq has sustained less damage to its cities and
 economic facilities than Iran, but its oil revenues have
 dropped from about $25 billion in 1980 to a projected
 $9 billion in 1982.   This drop, and a reduced flow of
 3       financial aid from the Persian Gulf states since April,
 have forced Saddam to suspend his extensive development
 program.
 Although Baghdad so far has insulated the population
 from serious hardships by drawing heavily on foreign ex-
 change reserves,  it will not be able to do so much longer.
 Barring receipt of new aid, Iraq will be nearly bankrupt
 by the end of January, and major austerity moves will be
 necessary in 1983.   As a result, public su  orpp  t for the
 war and the regime seem certain to drop.
 Iran's continued preparations for mobilization sug-
 gest a willingness to maintain the military pressure in-
 3                   definitely.   Neither side, however, can end the war
 through a decisive battlefield victory.
 Unless Saddam falls or Iran changes its military
 or political strategy, the war of attrition, punctuated
 2    by occasional Iranian offensives, will continue.   During
 the winter months,  fighting is likely to decrease.
 At this stage, neither army appears in danger of
 Z    collapse.   If Iraqi morale holds up,  spring should find
 J    the  frontl i nes  still  near  the  horde Ira

 PORTUGAL:   Balsemao's Shaky Hold on Power
 Prime Minister BaZsemao's visit to Washington next week comes
 at a time when Portuguese politics appear on the brink of a major
 realignment that threatens his job as well as the unity of the
 ruling Democratic Alliance coalition.  BaZsemao's political woes,
 in combination with Portugal's tight fiscal straits and pressure from
 the military, have Zed his government to push hard for increased
 assistance in the current negotiations with the US for a new de-
 fense cooperation agreement.
 Balsemao will arrive on Tuesday, two days after
 nationwide local elections.   The voting is the first
 broad sampling of opinion since the parliamentary elec-
 tion two years ago and will shape the tactics of the
 major political croups over the next several months.
 I,          The Prime Minister's centrist Social Democratic
 /v   Party is not likely to do well.   He does not appear able
 /1   to hold together the diverse constituencies of the Dem-
 ~/                  ocratic Alliance.   Although Balsemao pushed a major
 revision of the constitution through parliament and did
 a good job in handling Communist labor agitation earlier
 this year, his party and the government recently have
 There is growing opposition to Balsemao in his own
 party, with the leftists even calling for a coalition
 with the Socialists.  A poor showing by the party in
 the local elections would aggravate these tensions,
 and Balsemao could lose the top party job and the pre-
 miership at the Social Democrats' congress in February.
 By contrast,  the conservative Social Democratic
 Center Party--the junior partner in the Alliance--has
 improved its public standing and is expected to do well
 in the balloting.   Party leaders believe they are en-
 titled to equal standing with the Social Democrats in
 the Alliance.
 In the absence of a new parliamentary election to
 substantiate this claim, neither Balsemao nor other
 Social Democratic leaders are likely to concede it.   If
 the returns in towns where the two parties are in direct
 competition tend to favor the claim, the Alliance prob-
 The Socialist Party, the largest political grouping
 and the main opposition party, also is likely to make a
 strong showing.   This probably would rekindle national
 The Communists also are likely to fare well.   This
 could prompt the Communist-dominated labor movement to
 offer tougher opposition to the government's economic
 policies.
 Temporizing on the Economy
 Balsemao's shortcomings have been particularly
 v     evident in his management of the economy.  Although he
 has opened the economy to more private enterprise, he has
 lacked the will or the ability to cut back on the over-
 sized, costly public sector.
 The Prime minister also has kept Portugal's economic
 policies out of phase with those of its major trading
 partners, which have generally pursued constrictive,
 anti-inflationary policies over the past two years.  As
 a result, both Portugal's budget deficit and its balance-
 of-payments situation have deteriorated substantially.
 The austerity budget Balsemao announced last month
 is at best a temporizing step.   Its reliance on tax
 increases rather than a public-sector cutback to balance
 the budget and its surcharge on imports are likely to
 perpetuate economic problems.
 Security Issues
 Balsemao's concern about his deteriorating political
 position probably has shaped his attitude toward the
 current negotiations to renew the Portuguese-US defense
 cooperation agreement, which expires in earl  February.
 He is pushing for increased US aid.

 The Prime minister is worried Portuguese legislators
 will take a hard look at the final text of the pact,
 which will be the first international military agreement
 submitted to them under the new constitution.   Balsemao
 is particularly concerned, however, about the military's
 resentment over a recent constitutional revision and a
 new national defense law limiting its autonomy.   As a
 result, he is looking for ways to fund equipment pur-
 To meet Portugal's NATO commitments, the armed
 services want continued modernization of the Army's
 NATO brigade, a second squadron of A-7 attack aircraft,
 and three new frigates.   The frigates are in particular
 jeopardy, because Portuguese worries about unanticipated
 costs have delayed the start of construction to the point
 that the West German and Dutch Governments have threat-
 ened to withdraw their offers to contribute.
 Outlook
 The growing strains in the Social Democratic Party
 and in the Democratic Alliance suggest the government
 may collapse this winter.   If a parliamentary election
 is held in the spring, it probably would produce a
 Socialist - Social Democratic coalition under Socialist
 Although Balsemao would be likely to play a second-
 ary role in such a government, his successors probably
 would continue his ineffectual economic policies.   More-
 over, if Balsemao falls from power soon, his likely
 successors would be under the same political and eco-
