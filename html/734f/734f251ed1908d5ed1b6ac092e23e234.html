 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SIENATIE          March 13, 1979
 talk and continue to negotiate, then
 there has not been failure.
 The President has kept the negotia-
 tions moving. While we all would like to
 see an immediate treaty, I have not la-
 bored under any illusions, and I hops
 that most Americans have not suffered
 illusions in this regard. It is a long proc-
 ess. We should realize, from the years
 of pain and suffering and strife and
 bloodshed, that it is a thorny, difficult,
 profoundly complex matter, and that it
 will take time.
 During my own conversations with
 Middle Eastern leaders last year, I
 learned first hand how infinitely com-
 plex and difficult diplomatic negotia-
 tions on the conflicts. in that area are,
 and how imperative it is that such nego-
 tiations be pursued with patiende and
 tenacity. President Carter could well have
 departed from his meetings with Pres-
 ident  Sadat  and  Prime  Minister
 Begin with some kind of instant limited
 agreements on peripheral Issues, and the
 impression would have been imparted
 that great success had been realized.
 However, the mettle of such agreements
 would have become evident to all when
 the pressures of the real conflict began
 to build once again.
 President Carter understands the na-
 ture and the complexity of the challenge
 that he has accepted in the Middle East,
 I believe, and I commend him.
 I appreciate the fine spirit that has
 been exemplified on the floor just now by
 the minority leader and by the distin-
 guished Senator from Arizona, as they,
 too, have commented on the dedication
 that President Carter has demonstrated
 in his efforts for peace.
 The tragic and chronic confrontation
 in the Middle East has lasted for more
 than three decades. Moreover, it has
 Arab and Israeli alike. Already, in jus
 than any of his predecessors, in spite of
 all their commendable efforts.
 I congratulate President Carter on his
 efforts as he returns from Egypt and
 Israel today, and I encourage him to con-
 tinue to exert his efforts and use his in-
 fluence to achieve the peace that all men
 of good will around the world hope will
 come eventually to the Middle East. Not
 only will our generation give him its
 thanks, but all future generations will be
 indebted to him for this effort.
 ORDER OF PROCEDURE

 TAIWAN ENABLING ACT
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the
 previous order, the Senate will now re-
 sume                                                          consideration  of  the  pending
 business, S. 245, which the clerk will
 report.
 The legislative clerk read as follows:
 A bill (S. 245) to promote the foreign pol-
 icy of the United States through the main-
 tenance of commercial, cultural, and other
 relations with the people of Taiwan on an
 unofficial basis, and for other purposes.
 The Senate resumed the consideration
 of the bill.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I suggest the absence of a quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will call the roll.
 The second assistant legislative clerk
 proceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unan-
 imous consent that the order for the
 quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objedtion, it is so ordered.
 AMENDMENT NO. 100
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I understand
 the parliamentary situation to be that
 each side has 5 minutes, the yeas and
 nays have been ordered, and a motion to
 lay on the table has been made: is that
 correct?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the
 Senator's  preceding  question  is  on
 amendment 100 of the Senator from
 Kansas, on which there is a limitation of
 5 minutes of debate for each side, the
 Senator is correct. The yeas and nays
 have been ordered on the motion to lay
 on the table.
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I would just
 say very quickly that I think the issue is
 not particularly complicated.. It may be
 controversial, but it is certainly not com-
 plicated. It is just a question of whether
 or not we want the Senate to have any
 voice in confirming, advising, and con-
 senting on the director of the institute.
 We have simply provided that our Amer-
 ican Institute-
 shall be headed by a Director, who shall be
 appointed by the President, by and with the
 advice and consent of the Senate and who
 shall hold such appointment for a period of
 not to exceed two years.
 Mr. President, my amendment con-
 cerns the question of Senate responsi-
 bility and the Senate's obligation to the
 American people and to the Constitution-
 I believe, it is vital that the Senate
 have a provision for passing on the
 qualifications of the director of the
 American Institute on Taiwan. This
 amendment creates  such  an official
 avenue and safeguards the principles
 of advise and consent set forth in the
 Constitution.
 I am not asking for official recogni-
 tion of Taiwan by this amendment. I
 am only urging the Senate to have the
 opportunity to pass on the worthiness
 and judgment and ability of the person
 who will be the instrument of the United
 States. The institute will be carrying
 out U.S. foreign policy. On some occa-
 sions the director of the institute may
 even be placed in the position of tnitiat-
 ing policy and actions that will affect
 U.S. strategic interests.
 Again, let me state that it is not my
 intention to upset the balance my dis-
 tinguished colleagues on the Foreign Re-
 lations Committee have carefully worked
 out, nor to destroy the delicate under-
 standing upon which our normalization
 with the mainland rests. I am in favor of
 the normalization process when properly
 carried out. We have much to gain, in
 a closer relationship with Peking.
 My concern here, however, is with the
 constitutional responsibility of the Sen-
 ate. It seems to me that this bill, as it
 stands now, is asking the Senate to
 ignore some of that responsibility which
 we in the Senate now have to advise and
 consent to certain actions by the execu-
 tive department.
 As my distinguished colleague on the
 Foreign Relations Committee remarked
 yesterday, various elements of the execu-
 tive department will be performing over-
 sight functions in regard to the Institute,
 including the Comptroller-General. U.S.
 taxes are going to be channeled into the
 Institute to provide its operating funds.
 These facts only further indicate, the
 legitimate need for the Senate also to
 fulfill its oversight responsibilities.
 Now it is certainly true that the rela-
 tionship we are implementing in this leg-
 islation with Taipei is unprecedented. We
 cannot, therefore, lightly address the

 expiration o the recess, and was called

 ator from the   to of West Virginia.
 L. R. Elson, D.D., offked the following
 prayer:
 Let us pray.
 0 Lord our God, in who  we live and
 move and have our being,    know not
 what any day may bring. O   this, we
 know that every day is judgm   t day.
 Thou dost judge us in the mo   nt of
 action and in the grand climax of h tory.
 Thou dost judge us for what we are nd
 what we do. Thou dost judge the  .y
 we work, the way we think, the way
 speak, the way we vote, the way we play'
 the way we pray. Thou dost judge us ac-
 cording to the love we show and the help
 we bring. Judge us then according to Thy ,
 loving kindness for "Thy judgments are
 true and righteous altogether."
 Let the words of our mouths and the
 meditations of our hearts be acceptable
 in Thy sight, 0 Lord our strength and
 our Redeemer. Amen.

 THE JOURNAL
 Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, I ask unan-
 imous consent that the Journal of the
 proceedings of the Senate to date be ap-
 proved.
 TUESDAY, MARCH 13, 1979
 (Legislative day of Thursday, February 22,1979)
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator
 from Arizona.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore. The Senator from Arizona (Mr.
 GOLDWATER)  is recognized for up to 5

 Mr. GOLDWATER. I thank my friend

 Mr. STEWART assumed the chair.
 PRESIDTT CARTER'S PEACEMAK-
 ING E    ~TS IN THE MIDDLE EAST
 Mr. GO  WATER. Mr. President, I
 doubt thatt1ere is any one person in
 this country, k maybe the world, who
 has been more c tical of President Carter
 in the field of for 'gn policy than have I.
 I do not want an one to think for one
 moment that by wh t I am going to say
 this morning I have  uddenly changed
 my spots and will wak up on the other
 side of the bed.
 I think that with the n ws we all read
 and heard and saw last n ht, with the
 news we all read and heard *d saw this
 morning, it is rather evade t that the
 peace President Carter went t?kthe Mid-
 dle East to try to achieve is  of going
 to be achieved.
 I am not one American, nor p rticu-
 larly one Republican, who is go g to
 chastise President Carter for making his
 effort. I believe it took a great dea of
 courage. I think his performance ov r
 being forthright, even though we do not
 agree with him.                 _
 I would like to see him receive.the
 accolade in this field that I think he de-
 serves, and I urge my friends who are
 running for office at any level not to
 make of this Mideastern trip a political
 subject but, rather, to recognize that in
 this effort he has joined other Ameridans
 who served us as President, who showed
 courage in acting even though their ac-
 tions were not fruitful.
 So, Mr. President, I merely am offering
 these words as a man who is highly criti-
 cal of this administration but as one who
 feels that the President does deserve a
 pat on the back for this trip, because we
 all have to admire a little guts.
 Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, I join the
 distinguished Senator from Arizona in his
 remarks.
 I think it would not be unseemly of me
 to remind our colleagues that before the
 President went, I said from this place
 on this floor that I thought it was a risk
 worth taking, and I still think so.
 I do not know what the final result
 of the President's efforts will be or what
 will happen in the. remaining hours be-
 fore he returns to the United States, but
 it was a risk worth taking. From the
 appearances that generate from newspa-
 per and television accounts that we have
 seen, I believe that some progress has
 been made.
 I admire the President for his efforts in
 this matter, and I join the distinguished
 Senator from Arizona in his remarks and
 in his evaluation.
 PRESIDENT CARTER'S LATEST EF-
 FORTS ON BEHALF OF PEACE
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 President Carter flew to Cairo and Jeru-
 salem last week in the latest phase of
 his ongoing efforts to achieve a perma-
 nent peace between Egypt and Israel. In
 spite of the fact that advisers closest to-
 the President warned prior to this mis-
 sion that Mr. Carter did not expect to
 return with a treaty, some observers are
 -already pronouncing that this most
 recent effort is a failure, and they are
 predicting the direst consequences for
 the hopes of peace in the Middle East.
 I share with the distinguished Sena-
 tor from Arizona (Mr. GOLDWATER) and
 with Mr. BAKER, the distinguished minor-
 ity leader, the compliments they have
 stated here publicly for the President's
 efforts. To have done nothing would
 have justified criticism.
 As I view it, the President's efforts
 may have brought the parties closer to-
 gether. I have no way of knowing yet
 what the results are or what has been
 achieved. In any event, they have kept
 the negotiations moving forward; and
 a  ieved immediately, I am not about
 to  y that the President's efforts have
 bee   in vain.
 Bo   of the parties in the Middle
 East- hese are the people who would
 be the ictims of failure-will pay the
 immedia a price of failure, if and when
 there is f ilure. But as long as there is
 flexibility  nd as long as leaders on
 both sides o the question are willing to

 director of this nongovernmental insti-
 tute is appointed, he will not be subject to
 our direct control. It is necessary for us
 to have an opportunity to judge the
 -worthiness of this unofficial official, be-
 fore he is granted such unconditional
 scope for action.
 Mr. President, that is the issue. I un-
 derstand the questions being raised. One
 question raised is that Senate confirma-
 tion would destroy the nongovernmental
 character of the institute. I believe it
 does not. If the Secretary of State, acting
 for the President, has the authority to
 appoint this individual without giving an
 air of officiality to the proceeding, then
 surely the Senate can merely inspect the
 candidate for merit without doing the
 same. It is my understanding that the
 Senate must advise and consent to the
 directors of the corporation for public
 broadcasting, yet that body remains a
 nongovernmental corporation.
 We have all the questions raised as
 to why Congress does not pay more heed
 to what goes on in our so-called foreign
 policy. It seems to me that this is an
 opportunity to know one little thing. It
 does not shake the balance, or destroy
 that delicate balance worked out by the
 committee.
 I would like to say again that I sup-
 port closer ties with Peking in the hope
 that they will lead to a better under-
 standing between our countries. Normal-
 ization may lead to greater chances for
 peace and economic prosperity. The
 United States under the Carter admin-
 istration has gone a long way, has bent
 over backwards-perhaps too far-to
 accommodate the People's Republic on
 the issue of Taiwan.

 Bergland, where we discussed an increase
 in agricultural trade with the People's
 Republic of China. it. Is a growing

 The question of congressional over-

 than this transitory problem of Taiwan.

 Sincerely,
 CYRUS VANCE.
 Mr. BIDEN : It says in part :
 However, the names of prospective trustees
 and officers will be forwarded to the Foreign
 Relations Committee. If the Committee ex-
 presses  reservations  about  a  prospective
 trustee or officer, we will undertake to dis-
 cuss and resolve the matter fully with the
 Committee before proceeding.
 Mr. President, I think the proposed
 amendment is unnecessary to accomplish
 the goals for which it was ostensibly in-
 troduced in the first instance, and I think
 it would run serious risk of upsetting the
 delicate balance which we are attempt-
 ing to achieve here through our legisla-
 tion.
 I fully concur with the Senator from
 Kansas when he says that the normal-
 ization process is useful and in our own
 self-interest for many of the reasons that
 he cited. I again respectfully suggest that
 passage of this amendment will put in
 jeopardy the very end that the Senator
 from Kansas is seeking.
 I would also conclude by saying that if
 the Senator from Kansas is successful in
 his quest, he may find that he, in prac-
 tice, prefers the arrangement proposed
 by the committee.
 So for a number of reasons, both per-
 sonal, practical, and official, I suggest
 that the Senator from Kansas is ill-ad-
 vised in moving the amendment.
 Assuming the Senator from Kansas is
 willing to yield back the remainder of his
 time, I am willing to yield back the re-
 mainder of my time. I move at this time
 to table the amendment, if that is agree-
 able to the Senator.
 Mr. DOLE. That is not what I have
 in mind.
 Mr. BIDEN. I yield to the Senator from
 West Virginia, the distinguished major-
 ity leader.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER, The Chair
 will advise the Senator from Delaware
 that he has 20 seconds remaining and
 and the Senator from Kansas has a min-
 ute-and-a-half remaining.
 Mr. BIDEN. I suggest the absence of
 a quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is
 not sufficient time for a rolicall. The re-
 quest is out of order.
 Mr. BIDEN. Then I suggest I keep
 speaking so the Senate is not out of
 'order. Then I will yield for the minute-
 and-a-half to the Senator from Kansas.
 I do not really have much more to say,
 especially in 20 seconds. I have difficulty
 saying  my  name  in  20  seconds.
 [Laughter.]
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator's time has just expired. The Senator
 from Kansas has a minute-and-a-half.
 Mr. DOLE. I have no desire to use that
 time, Mr. President. I would be happy
 to yield to the distinguished majority
 and minority leaders.

 As the Senator from Kansas knows, the                      to retain its character as a private corpora- dent, I thank the distinguished Senator.
 comments I would like to make. The Sen-
 ator from Kansas indicates that he is
 merely asking that the institute be
 headed by a director appointed by the
 President with the advice and consent
 of the U.S. Senate. I suggest that that
 does complicate this Institute and raise
 it to a level that is not contemplated in
 the initial agreement with the People's
 Republic.
 The amendment is, I believe, also in-
 consistent with normalization. Our abil-
 ity to have diplomatic relations with PRC
 and simultaneously maintain commer-
 cial, cultural, and other relations with
 the people on Taiwan depends on the
 latter relations being conducted on an
 unofficial basis. The American Institute
 in Taiwan was established under District
 of Columbia nonprofit corporation law as
 a private corporation precisely to avoid
 the appeaarnce of officiality that this
 amendment, I believe, would create.
 The appointment of a director of the
 AIT through the procedures specified in
 the Constitution for appointing officers
 of the United States would, I think, be
 disruptive to the delicate set of relation-
 ships this legislation is intended to pro-
 mote.
 Second, Mr. President, I think this
 amendment is unnecessary. Congres-
 sional oversight over the operation and
 management of the Institute is assured,
 I believe, in the present bill. In reflection
 of this amendment, I hope the Senator
 will turn to page 20 of the bill, title III.
 He will see that the committee spent a
 good deal of time dealing with that par-
 ticular aspect of relationship.
 We also have, and I would like to sub-
 mit it for the RECORD, a letter to the
 chairman of the Foreign Relations Com-
 mittee from the Secretary of State. I will
 not trouble the Senate with reading the
 entire submission. I ask unanimous con-
 sent that it be printed in the RECORD at
 this point.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
 Washington, D.C., February 23, 1979.
 Hon. FRANK CHURCH,
 Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,
 U.S. Senate.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN. As you know, under

 (CUNGR1E55][UNA1jL REQ:URD- bEN i ii 1         march 13, 1979
 The President of the United States just
 called me from Air Force 1 to say that
 he had talked again with President
 Sadat, and President Sadat has agreed
 to the proposals that have been dis-
 cussed. The President did not go into
 any details as to what the proposals are
 or have been. But he said that Mr. Sadat
 has agreed to them; that Mr. Begin is
 going to submit those to his cabinet
 shortly and to the Knesset; that hope-
 fully the Israel Cabinet and the Knesset
 will agree to the remaining issues, and
 that a treaty may result.
 That was the sum and substance of
 what the President had to say to me.
 The distinguished minority leader re-
 ceived a call. I yield at this point to the
 minority leader for any comment he
 may have.
 Mr. BAKER. I thank the distinguished
 majority leader.
 Mr. President, the Vice President of
 the United States called me a little while
 ago to say that the President had re-
 quested that I be notified. It appeared
 that an agreement had been reached for
 submission, as I understood it, to the
 Parliament of Egypt and to the Knesset
 in Israel. My information coincides ex-
 actly with that described by the dis-
 tinguishel majority leader.
 I would only add that I am pleased
 and relieved. I think the President took
 a risk that was worth taking. I am hope-
 ful now that these other negotiations
 and considerations by the governing au-
 thorities of each country will result in a
 peace treaty.
 Early on I commended the President
 of the United States for his initiative in
 undertaking this trip: I think the indi-
 cations are now that the result may be
 favorable. I join with him and with the
 majority leader in our statement of
 pleasure at that result.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I thank the
 distinguished minority leader.
 Mr. President, it is hoped, following
 what the minority leader has stated, that
 impending developments will result in a
 favorable action. My understanding is
 that President Sadat has agreed with
 all of the matters at issue. Again, I am
 not aware of all the details.
 I can see, I think, the difference in the
 positions of Mr. Begin and Mr. Sadat. I
 have had the impression that Mr. Sadat,
 is in a little better position within his
 country to authorize and to give approval
 to proposals which Mr. Begin alone
 might not be equally able to do within
 his country.
 I am hopeful that the Israeli Cabinet
 and the Knesset will add their stamps
 of approval.
 It seems, Mr. President, based on these
 conversations  that  the  distinguished
 minority leader and I have had with the
 Vice President and the President re-
 spectively, that things are looking up and
 that the hoped-for agreement may yet
 be achieved. Let us hope this will be the
 result.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator's time has expired.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I thank the
 distinguished Presiding Officer. I ask that
 the time that he has so graciously al-
 lowed us to proceed to use be charged
 against both sides on the bill.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 TAIWAN ENABLING ACT
 The Senate continued with the con-
 sideration of S. 245.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from Delaware is recognized.
 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I move to

 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 question is on agreeing to the motion.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I suggest the absence of a quorum and
 ask that the time be charged equally
 against both sides on the bill.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will
 call the roll.
 The assistant legislative clerk pro-
 ceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I ask unanimous consent that the order
 for the quorum call be rescinded.
 . The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 The question now is on agreeing to the
 motion by the Senator from Idaho to lay
 on the table the amendment of the Sen-
 ator from Kansas. The yeas and nays
 have been ordered. The clerk will call the
 roll.
 The assistant legislative clerk called
 the roll.
 Mr. CRANSTON. I announce that the
 Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. BOREN),
 the Senator from Florida (Mr. CHILES),
 the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr.
 DURKIN), the Senator from Alaska (Mr.
 GRAVEL), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr.

 absent.
 Mr. BAKER. I announce that the Sen-

 Senator  from  South  Carolina  (Mr.
 THURMOND) are necessarily absent.
 I further announce that, if present and
 voting,- the Senator from South Carolina
 (Mr. THURMOND) would vote "nay."

 every Senator had a chance to vote?
 The result was announced-yeas 54,

 AMENDMENT NO. 101 (AS MODIFIED)
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 PRYOR). Under the previous order, the
 Senate will now proceed to the consider-
 ation of amendment No. 1@l, offered by
 the Senator from New Hampshire, with 1
 hour of debate.
 The amendment will be stated.
 The assistant legislative clerk read as
 follows :
 The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr.
 HUMPHREY)  proposes an amendment num-
 bered 101.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ate will be in order.
 The Senator from New Hampshire is
 recognized.
 Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I
 have a technical correction to my
 amendment which I send to the desk,
 and I ask unanimous consent that it be
 accepted.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection? The Chair hears none, and
 it is so ordered.
 The modified amendment is as follows:
 On page 23 after "SEC. 501", and before
 "This Act shall have taken effect on January
 1, 1979" insert the following: "Contingent
 upon the President of the United States se-
 curing written assurances from the People's
 Republic of China that the People's Republic
 of china will not undertake military opera-
 tions of any nature against the people of
 Taiwan.".
 Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I be-
 lieve that S. 245 will be vastly improved
 by my amendment. It would make the
 effectiive date of this law January 1,
 1979, if approved by Congress, contin,e-
 gent upon the President's securing from
 the People's Republic of China written
 assurances that the People's Republic of
 China will not engage in military activi
 ties against the Republic of Taiwan. I
 believe that the bill would be improved
 vastly; and I think it goes without saying
 that the security of the Republic of
 Taiwan, the security of the people of
 Taiwan, would be improved vastly.
 I believe it is quite possible that the
 People's Republic of China would agree

 ill a 'ch 13, 1979          CONGRESSIONAL RECORD-SENATE
 to give those concessions. I think the
 People's Republic of China has a great
 deal more to gain from improved and
 formal relations with the United States
 than the United States has.
 It is highly unfortunate that in his
 negotiations with the People's Republic
 of China, President Carter and his peo-
 ple failed to press for such an assurance.
 In fact, it came out during the hearings'
 of the Foreign Relations Committee not
 only that the President did not press for
 such assurances, but also, that he never
 even bothered to ask for them, which is
 a shocking revelation, in my opinion.
 There are those who will say that my
 amendment works against the best inter-
 ests of the people on Taiwan. I point out
 that today, at this moment, we have
 neither an ambassador nor an embassy
 in Taiwan; at the same time, neither do
 we have the so-called American Insti-
 tute. We are in a hiatus. Yet, the people
 on Taiwan remain free, they remairf
 prosperous, our American Investments in
 Taiwan remain secure, and the mutual
 agreements between this country and the
 ROC remain in force. So, should the
 Senate decide, in its wisdom, to approve
 this amendment, we would not be creat-
 ing any further vacuum than exists at
 this moment.
 Mr. President, I reserve the remainder
 of my time.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from Idaho is recognized.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, it would
 be ruinous to adopt this amendment.
 The whole purpose of this bill is to
 establish a basis whereby the United
 States can continue to maintain its rela-
 tions with the people on Taiwan. The
 whole purpose of this bill is to serve the
 needs of that relationship. The commer-
 cial aspects, the cultural aspects, and
 our concern for the future security of
 the people on Taiwan are embraced in
 this bill.
 Why is it necessary to bring this bill
 to the Senate in the first place? The
 answer to that question is.. known to
 Senators. We are faced with a unique
 condition. There are two Qovernments
 that continue to maintain that, each is
 the Government of China. Both Govern-
 ments agree that there is but one China,
 and that Taiwan is a part of it. That is
 not only an assertion of Peking; that is
 also an assertion of Taipei. The choice
 before the United States is, which of
 these Governments shall we recognize
 officially?
 ,Obviously, the circumstances do not
 permit that we recognize both. The
 President of the United States has found
 the resolution to put aside 30 years of
 self-deception and to acknowledge that
 the-People's Republic of China does in
 fact constitute the Government of China
 and the seat of that government is in
 Peking. It exercises effective jurisdiction
 over a billion human beings, who com-
 prise one-fourth of the human race.
 If this amendment were to be adopted
 we would be saying that everything con-
 tained in this bill that benefits Taiwan
 is made contingent upon some future
 written guarantee furnished us by the
 government in Peking that there never
 will be an armed attack upon the island
 of Taiwan.
 Mr. President, Senators appreciate
 that when both the Chinese on Taiwan
 and the Chinese on the mainland re-
 gard the resolution of the Taiwan issue
 as an internal question, a Chinese ques-
 tion, there is no possibility of ever ob-
 taining such written assurance. Thus, the
 adoption of this amendment effectively
 kills the bill through which we Will other-
 wise be able to maintain all of our exist-
 ing relations with the people on Taiwan
 on an unofficial basis. If Senators want
 to kill the bill, this is the way to do it.
 I certainly have confidence that the
 Senate will show more mature judg-
 ment than to act favorably upon this
 amendment.
 Mr. STONE. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. CHURCH. I am happy to yield to
 the distinguished Senator from Florida.
 Mr. STONE. As a vigorous supporter
 of the Republic of China on Taiwan and
 one who in the committee worked as
 hard as possible to strengthen our rela-
 tionships with the Republic of China on
 Taiwan, I believe that to adopt this
 amendment would not be in the interests
 of the Republic of China on Taiwan. We
 have a gap. We have a hiatus which we
 are now engaged in and we are doing our
 best to live through it. If this bill be-
 comes law in the next few days, as it can,
 then our tremendous trade relations
 with the Republic of China on Taiwan,
 which exceeds $7 billion a year, can and
 will go on and even improve. And I think
 there could come a day in which strong-
 er, more governmentally based relations
 with the Republic of China on Taiwan,
 could again take place.
 At this moment, though, the best we
 can do for our relationship with them is
 to pass this bill which is far different than
 the bill initially presented to the Foreign
 Relations Committee. This bill has been
 strengthened in so many ways that it
 really does the job.
 And I think that we should oppose
 this amendment as well-meaning as I
 am sure the Senator from New Hamp-
 shire is in this regard. He does want to
 help the Republic of China on Taiwan,
 as does the Senator from Florida. But
 I think that it is very, very important
 now to get on with this bill, which has
 strong definitions, strong property rights,
 and strong standing in court for our
 friends on Taiwan, and let us get on with
 it and pass this bill very quickly, because
 otherwise our friends could suffer sub-
 stantially and- that is not appropriate.
 I think I should also say one other
 thing. This bill also has not merely a
 commitment to supply appropriate de-
 fensive weapons to Taiwan, but at my
 suggestion the Senator from Idaho and
 the Senator from New York incorporated
 the concept of a sufficiency of weapons,
 enough weapons so that they can defend,
 themselves successfully.
 Under those circumstances, and with
 what this bill now represents, and par-
 ticularly after the amendment of yester-
 day, what this bill represents in every
 way, I really believe that it is time for us
 rapidly to pass this bill, send it to the
 President, and let us get on with our very
 S2573.
 good and we hope steady and improv-
 ing relations with our friends on Taiwan.
 Mr. CHURCH. I thank the Senator
 very much for his statement. I wish to
 add to it that the hiatus he refers to
 is one that should be of concern to us. It
 is one that should spur us on not only
 to enact this bill, but to reject any
 amendment that would put the effective
 date into the indefinite future, because
 there is nervousness right now about the
 hiatus to which the Senator from Florida
 has referred. I am informed that some
 Taiwanese banks and business firms
 have already withdrawn several hun-
 dred million dollars in funds because of
 the uncertainties about when this bill
 will take effect.
 To prolong those uncertainties would,
 of course, simply aggravate the problem
 and doubtlessly result in massive with-
 drawals of Taiwanese funds from Ameri-
 can banks.
 Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. CHURCH. I am happy to yield to
 the distinguished Senator from Cali-
 fornia.
 Mr. CRANSTON. Mr. President, I join
 in opposition to the amendment for all
 the reasons spelled out so succinctly by
 the distinguished Senator from Idaho
 and the distinguished Senator from
 Florida.
 I add that I applaud the work that
 they and Senator JAvITs, Senator STONE,
 Senator GLENN, and others have done in
 the Chamber in handling this measure so
 very, very effectively.
 An amendment like this one, like
 several others that have been proposed,
 would destroy our efforts to develop a
 meaningful substantive relationship with
 the People's Republic of China.
 I make plain that I support the Tai-
 wan Enabling Act as reported by the
 Foreign Relations Committee and with
 the perfecting amendments that have
 been adopted to date. I have long been
 a proponent for U.S. diplomatic recog-
 nition of the People's Republic of China.
 It is in the interest of the United States.
 the most powerful country in the world,
 to establish a viable working relation-
 ship with the People's Republic of China.
 the most populous country in the world.
 I do not see how we can be expected to
 deal with many worldwide problems of
 vast importance that are of vast sig-
 nificance to the people of our country if
 we are unable to talk in any direct and
 meaningful fashion with the People's
 Republic of China when we take into ac-
 count how many people on the face of
 this world that Government represents.
 Our two countries have very different
 systems and values. Yet, we also have
 many common interests. Our mutual
 concerns can now be discussed in an at-
 mosphere conducive for resolution of
 our common problems. The recent agree-
 ment for the settlement of frozen assets
 is an example. But more important, the
 cooperation and participation of China
 are crucial in our search for solutions to
 such global issues as food, population,
 energy, and arms control.
 At the same time, I am an advocate
 of continuing our commercial. educa-

 tional, cultural, and scientific relations
 ,with the people of Taiwan. The United
 States and Taiwan have enjoyed a long
 and valued friendship and it is in our
 mutual interest to continue these good
 relations. While we nurture a new friend-
 ship, we cannot and should not forget
 our old ones.
 I believe the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee should be commended for the
 excellent job it has done in putting to-
 gether the Taiwan Enabling Act, S. 245.
 This bill clarifies much of that which
 the administration implied but left am-
 biguous. Further, the committee has
 added an appropriate and necessary
 component to the framework of our fu-
 ture relations with the people of Taiwan.
 That essential component is the security
 clause asserting the continuing American
 concern and interest in the security of
 Taiwan and the western Pacific area.
 This provision in section 114 of the act
 is particularly necessary in the absence
 of an express pledge by Peking not to
 use force against Taiwan.
 On several occasions I have spelled out
 the many reasons why I believe Peking
 will not use force against Taiwan, and I
 will not repeat them here for the record
 again. But since Peking would not re-
 nounce expressly the use of force against
 Taiwan, the United States must keep
 open its options to respond in the un-
 likely event there is a use of force by
 Peking. Therefore, I am pleased that
 the committee has incorporated the es-
 sential thrust of the resolution Senator
 KENNEDY and'I introduced with the broad
 bipartisan support of 28 other Senators
 regarding the peace, prosperity, and wel-
 fare of Taiwan. And I am pleased that
 the Senate yesterday adopted a perfect-
 ing amendment by voice vote to section
 114(b) (3) reflecting this substance.
 The committee, in its thorough delib-
 erations, has tackled a difficult and un-
 precedented situation. And the resulting
 committee language demonstrates the
 committee members' understanding of,
 and sensitivity and commitment to our
 future relations with the people of Tai-
 wan.
 As we preserve the substance of our
 commercial, cultural, and other relations
 with the people to Taiwan, it is impor-
 tant that we maintain these bonds on
 an unofficial-though no less substan-
 tive-basis. It would be inconsistent to
 maintain official relations with both
 Peking and Taipei.
 The Taiwan Enabling Act establishes
 the necessary balance in our relations
 with the  people of Taiwan and the
 Peking Government. And it is a balance
 that must be maintained. The adminis-
 tration can live with this bill. I believe
 the Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan
 Strait can also live with it-as it is with-
 out further changes. This bill will es-
 tablish the balance which is in the inter-
 ests of all parties. To upset the balance
 serves no one.
 I am convinced that S. 245 is adequate
 and appropriate in governing our future
 unofficial relations with the people of
 Taiwan. I ask my colleagues to join
 me in this support, and I urge them to
 oppose amendment like the pending pro-
 posal that would destroy our opportunity
 to develop appropriate relations with the
 People's Republic of China.
 Mr. MUSKIE. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. CHURCH. I thank the Senator
 very much for his intervention, and I
 yield now to the distinguished Senator
 from Maine.
 Mr. MUSKIE. Mr. President, I am sure
 that any comments by me at this point
 following the clear and lucid analysis of
 this amendment by the distinguished
 manager and the chairman of the For-
 eign Relations Committee and my col-
 leagues, Senators STONE and CRANSTON,
 is not necessary. However, it seems to me
 as an opportune time for me to indicate
 my support for the pending legislation as
 well as my opposition to this amendment.
 On December 15, 1978, President Carter
 announced that effective January 1, 1979,
 the United States would recognize the
 People's Republic of China. At the same
 time he asserted that the American peo-
 ple and Taiwan "would maintain com-
 mercial, cultural and other relations
 without official basis."
 Since President Nixon  signed  the
 Shanghai Communique in 1972, a U.S.
 policy goal has been to work toward
 normalization of ties with mainland
 China. This was difficult to achieve due
 to our recognition of a strong alliance
 with the Republic of China. Both Taiwan
 and mainland China take the position
 that there is only one China, but that
 each considers itself the sole legitimate
 government of the Chinese people.
 Recent U.S. recognition of the People's
 Republic of China as the sole legitimate
 Government of China now precludes our
 Government from dealing with Taiwan
 on an official basis.
 The legislation before us assures the
 continuation of full commercial, cul-
 tural, and other relations between the
 United States and the people of Taiwan,
 on an  unofficial  basis. U.S. relations
 and  interests  with  Taiwan  will  be
 handled by the American Institute of
 Taiwan, a private organization funded by
 the U.S. Government, established ex-
 pressly for this purpose. The institute will
 be the channel through which most U.S.
 agencies and departments will carry out
 programs, transactions, and other rela-
 tions with Taiwan. The institute will
 conduct its business with Taiwan through
 a similar private institution established
 by the people of Taiwan which will rep-
 resent their interests.
 Mr. President, let me emphasize that
 this legislation is independent of the
 President's decision to recognize the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China. This. legislation
 cannot  affect that decision and no
 amendments to it or rhetoric about it
 can change that fact.
 This legislation is important to Tai-
 wan. It is important to American inter-
 ests in Taiwan. It is the only vehicle
 available to legally assure a continuing
 commercial, social, and military rela-
 tionship with Taiwan.
 I know that some of my colleagues who
 disagree with the recognition of the PRC
 are frustrated by the fact that there is no
 legislative vehicle available to overturn
 the President's decision to culminate the
 policy initiated by President Nixon to
 normalize relations with China. I know,
 too, that some of my colleagues would
 like to amend this legislation so as to
 create a political issue-though obviously
 not a partisan issue.
 But, Mr. President, the fact is that
 this effort and this amendment smacks of
 biting off one's nose to spite one's face.
 Taiwan needs this bill. America's Inter-
 ests in Taiwan need this bill. conversely,
 I suggest the People's Republic of China
 might be pleased to see this bill die.
 This amendment would have as its
 sole.effect the denial of all of the bene-
 fits which S. 245 would confer upon the
 people of Taiwan. The entire thrust of
 this bill is the protection of the relation-
 ship with the United States and the peo-
 ple on Taiwan, their eligibility for pro-
 grams and relationships, the standing of
 Taiwan's authorities and people in the
 U.S. courts, the applicability of Taiwan's
 laws in U.S. courts, the continuation in
 force of treaties and agreements with
 Taiwan, the protection of Taiwan's as-
 sets, the security amendment, and so on.
 The administration has not made the
 continued relationship with the United
 States and the people on Taiwan contin-
 gent upon the PRC's conduct.
 For Congress to do so would be com-
 pletely inconsistent with its desire to
 protect the people on Taiwan.
 We may wish the Chinese would issue
 a statement formally renouncing the
 use of force. There is no reason to believe
 they will do so.
 To make our continued relationship .
 with the people on Taiwan contingent
 upon the PRC taking an action that
 clearly it has no intention of taking will
 simply punish the people on Taiwan.
 I would hope that each of my col-
 leagues would bear this in mind as they
 consider amendments to and final pas-
 sage of this legislation. With this in
 mind, Mr. President, I would like to ad-
 dress the bill in specific terms.
 For purposes of U.S. domestic law, this
 legislation :views Taiwan as a country,
 absent the official sovereign status. It ex-
 tends to those representing Taiwan in-
 terests, all privileges and immunities
 necessary in conducting business with
 our country. Thus Taiwan will continue
 to be eligible under such statutes as the
 Arms Export Act, the Export-Import
 Bank Act, and the Atomic Energy Act.
 All existing international agreements,
 with the exception of the Mutual Defense
 Treaty, made between the United States
 and the People's Republic of China will
 continue in force notwithstanding the
 changed status of Taiwan.
 This legislation also details the close
 relations between the American Insti-
 tute of Taiwan and the U.S. Government:
 The Institute is authorized to enter into
 new agreements  as necessary.  Such
 agreements will continue to be subject to
 congressional approval and consultation,
 pursuant to U.S. law.
 The basic structure of the bill as sub-
 mitted by the administration remains
 intact. However, the committee has clar-
 ified and specified some of the provisions
 to guard against legal loopholes or ques-
 tionable application of U.S. domestic laws.

 which would have the effect of under-
 mining American-Taiwan relations.
 TAIWAN AND THE SECURITY QUESTION
 One of the most discussed issues of the
 bill has been the nature of our defense
 ties with Taiwan. The committee decided
 to add a section to S. 245 under which
 the United States would continue pro-
 viding defensive arms to Taiwan and
 would assist the people of Taiwan to
 maintain a sufficient self-defense capa-
 bility, whether through the provision of
 arms or other means. This section also
 directs the President to immediately in-
 form Congress of any threat to Taiwan's
 security or to U.S. interests related to
 Taiwan. Any U.S.  reaction to such
 threats would be carried out within the
 confines of U.S. law and constitutional
 processes. These confines include the
 provisions of the war powers resolution
 which insures congressional consultation
 by the President before any U.S. Armed
 Forces  are committed to hostilities.
 U.S. law and constitutional procedures
 precludes any absolute security guaran-
 tee for Taiwan or any country.
 IMPACT OF U.S.-PRC NORMALIZATION ON TAIWAN
 AND THE ASIA REGION
 Normalization of relations between the
 United States and the People's Republic
 of China provides for a more cooperative
 relationship between our Government
 and their Government and enhances the
 prospects for a peaceful resolution of
 the Taiwan issue. The Mutual Defense
 Treaty which will be terminated in Jan-
 uary 1980 has not and cannot in itself
 guarantee a peaceful future for Taiwan.
 This in no way diminishes our continued
 concern for the welfare of Taiwan. We
 have made it very clear to the People's
 Republic of China that our relations with
 them rests on the expectation that the
 Taiwan question be peacefully resolved.
 During my trip to the People's Repub-
 lic of China in the latter part of Novem-
 ber 1978, the Chinese made clear to the
 congressional delegation their commit-
 ment  to  the  "four  moderizations,"
 China's plan for large-scale economic
 development. They frankly stated that
 China's access to U.S. credit, agricul-
 tural commodities, and technology is a
 key to their country's development pri-
 orities. Furthermore the People's Repub-
 lic of China seems far more preoccupied
 with Soviet influence in many parts of
 the world than with a forced takeover of
 Taiwan. Their trade interests with the
 United States coupled with their con-
 cern over Soviet expansionism are in-
 icentives for the People's Republic of
 China to seek a peaceful coexistence
 with the people of Taiwan.
 Likewise U.S. normalization of ties
 -with the People's Republic of China re-
 duces the likelihood of a confrontation
 between China and the United States in
 the Asia region. This is especially signif-
 icant for our Asia allies. Our coinciding
 interests in the Soviet role in Asia will
 also diminish possibilities of China pre-
 cipitating political and economic up-
 heaval in the region.
 This bill is vital to our future relations
 with Taiwan, as it lays the groundwork
 upon which commercial, cultural, and
 other relations between our country and
 Taiwan will continue on an official basis.
 There is no reason to believe that this
 new basis will hamper our bilateral rela-
 tions. On the contrary, there is every rea-
 son to believe that our relations will
 flourish and expand. Under a similar ar-
 rangement between Taiwan and Japan,
 established a few years ago, trade be-
 tween them has actually increased.
 I am sure my colleagues here share the
 same deep concern that the members of
 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
 felt during their deliberations on S. 245:
 That the United States will not abandon
 Taiwan. With this concern very much in
 mind, the committee held extensive heax-
 ings on this bill, carefully considering
 wide-ranging views including those of
 the State Department, legal experts,
 business interests, congressional mem-
 bers, and defense experts. At the same
 time the committee was careful to avoid
 including language in the bill which
 would risk undermining or disrupting
 relations between the United States and
 the People's Republic of China. Such pro-
 visions would not safeguard Taiwan's
 future or our relations with them. Rather
 such provisions could only jeopardize
 Taiwan's future. I appeal to my col-
 league's to not be misled by amendments
 that may seem to strengthen our ties with
 Taiwan, but which actually undermine
 them and thus place in jeopardy the en-
 tire purpose of this bill.
 Quite simply if this legislation is not
 passed, our relations with Taiwan go
 down the drain. We should waste little
 time in passing S. 245.
 There are risks involved in this new
 policy toward the People's Republic of
 China and Taiwan, but I believe that this
 new policy is of such mutual interest to
 the People's Republic of China and to the
 United States and other countries whose
 'future is of concern to us in the Western
 Pacific that the end result will be sta-
 bilization of the situation in the Western
 Pacific. Such a stabilization will work to
 achieve what this amendment seeks to
 achieve explicitly, but which it cannot,
 given the realities, achieve today on the
 Senate floor.
 For that reason, Mr. President, I sup-
 port the position taken by Senator
 CHURCH and others of my colleagues in
 opposing this amendment and support-
 ing the pending legislation.
 May I say I particularly appreciated
 the observations of my good friend from
 Florida (Mr. STONE) with whom I had
 the privilege of visiting and touring
 through the People's Republic of China
 last November.   /
 We returned just 3 weeks before the
 President's historic decision, and I think,
 at least so far as I am conserned, that
 I am assured the Chinese at this point
 view it as in their interest to begin and
 continue an open relationship with the
 West, and that that objective would be
 inconsistent  with  the  use  of  force
 directed toward Taiwan.
 In the pending legislation, as Senator
 STONE has so articulately said, we have
 made it eminently clear to the People's
 Republic of China that we would regard
 it as against our interest for them to use
 S 2575
 force against the people of Taiwan. So
 I am delighted to have followed, and
 am prepared to follow, Senator STONE's
 comments on the pending amendment
 here this morning.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I yield
 to the Senator from New York such
 time as he requires.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I think
 Members have already put their fingers
 on the critical points here, but I would
 like to sum them up, as one of the
 authors of this bill.
 This measure.we are passing, as Sen-
 ator MUSKIE so very properly said, is for
 the benefit of Taiwan. The People's
 Republic of China would probably be
 delighted if we did not pass this, because
 then all we do is exchange ambassadors.
 Everything is normalized, everything is
 regularized, and they have a free hand
 in respect of Taiwan, and we leave the
 Taiwanese up in the air as to whether
 they are going to be backed, defended,
 or traded with respect to what unilat-
 eral commitment we are making to
 them. That is all left up for grabs.
 I could not think of anything that
 would be more satisfying to Teng than
 the collapse of the relations between the
 United States and Taiwan, which would
 result in leaving them totally alone.
 Where else are they going to go? They
 are orphans, at the mercy of 900 million
 people, who can certainly overwhelm
 them sooner or later.
 So the passage of this bill is our way
 of giving them the assurance which they
 need and, for a change, in American
 policy-which has been bedeviled by the
 idea that the President cannot deliver
 has begun to stand out in the world, so
 that nations now doubt that we are reso-
 lute and are going to come through-
 here is a situation in which we are join-
 ing with the President, and we say as
 a totally united United States "We are
 going to fee that you are not overrun,
 that you are not prejudiced, that you are
 not coerced either by force or by the im-
 plication of force or by boycott or
 blockade."
 It seems to me that is a critical point,
 and there is no question about the fact
 that this will kill this whole proposition,
 because can you conceive of Teng, who
 is the inventor of this policy, swallowing
 this one?
 He was just here, he just debated this
 proposition, and just told that they have
 got lots of time; they can wait forever.
 They do not intend to use force or change
 the social conditions, and so forth, on
 Taiwan. They value what is now their
 American connection. They do not want
 to jeopardize it, and in the face of that
 we say, "We want it in writing, or else."
 The second point, which I think is
 exceedingly important, is this: What al-
 ternative do we offer to this way of ap-
 proaching this problem? The alternative
 now is one of complete uncertainty for
 the people on Taiwan, and for this rea-
 son: let us assume, for the sake of argu-
 ment, that we obtained this written
 promise, which is inconceivable under the
 circumstances. It seems to me anybody
 can see that, that the Chinese cannot do
 it, and if we should do this and incorpo-
 rate it in this law it would simply mean

 CONGRIESSIONAIL RECORD -SENATE          March 13, 1979
 the collapse of all the negotiations with
 respect t o where we are today.
 But let us assume we can get it. What
 is the sequel to that? We now have a
 written agreement with the Chinese. We
 do not have to do anything further. We
 do not have to assure them of arms, as-
 sure them of trade, assure them of back-
 ing down the road, and a solemn promise
 by the United States. The Chinese have
 written it and have said they are not
 going to use force, and we are out of it,
 and that is all this amendment says. It
 says:
 Contingent upon the President securing
 written assurances from the People's Re-
 public that they will not undertake military
 operations.
 What about boycott? What about
 blockade? What about telling every na-
 tion in the world "If you do any business
 with Taiwan, don't you show your nose
 in the People's Republic of China?
 They have no promise from us, because
 we will have done all that you wished
 us to do by proposing this amendment.
 We get a written statement which just
 says that China will not use any military
 operations. Well, they can strangle them
 about 50 ways from the middle without
 any military operations.
 So with all respect to our colleague,
 and I respect and appreciate the oppo-
 sition to this measure, I really think it
 is better to kill it in open combat and
 fair duel than by stealth, and that is all
 this would do. Instead of knifing him in
 the front you are going to knife him in
 the back, and I do not believe that this
 is what our country wants.  .
 Now, as to the differences between
 Teng and ourselves on the question of
 force, I think that is a very important
 question, and I wish to point out again,
 as one of the conceptualists in respect
 of this legislation, that it was my pur-
 pose, and I can only account for myself
 and I think it is carried out in'the legis-
 lation, to make a unilateral promise by
 the United States which was not depend-
 ent or contingent upon anybody else's
 promise. We know that people forget,
 and we know that notwithstanding that
 this is a highly interdependent world,
 Taiwan is far away, so are the people
 of the People's Republic of China, and it
 is very hard for our people to get accus-
 tomed to the idea that that is where our
 frontiers are. If it is a war, that is where
 it is going to start, whether it is on that
 frontier, the European frontier, the Mid-
 dle East frontier; it certainly is not going
 to start in Los Angeles, San Francisco,
 or New York.
 So we felt this had to be enshrined in
 some way in American policy, like any
 other major declaration, that our people
 for generations would not forget what
 we have promised the Taiwanese in
 terms of their survival and their ability
 to exist under whatever system they de-
 cide to adopt.
 So, it seems to me that we can under-
 stand Teng's statement, that they can-
 not give up the right of the use of force.
 "Maybe these people someday will deny
 their motherland," as he put it; they
 cannot denigrate their own concept that
 there is one China, including Taiwan,
 by agreeing to anything which denigrates
 that idea.
 And we say, "All right, that was in-
 corporated In the Shanghai communi-
 que, which we accepted, and you can
 feel that way, and even the people on
 Taiwan can feel that way. Although we
 doubt that they do; we really think it is
 the people who came over from the
 mainland who have those strong feelings.
 But be that as it may, we are telling you
 now we will not stand still for it, and
 will react with everything we have ac-
 cording to the constitutional processes
 of this country-and you do not have to
 agree to this, we are saying it) unilat-
 erally-if-you use force, direct or indi-
 rect, or coercion against these people, not
 only to suppress them but to suppress
 their social or. governmental system."
 It seems to me that when a great nation
 makes that kind of a condition, not based
 on something those people say or do or
 do not do, that is the strongest kind of
 commitment we can give the people on
 Taiwan.
 And the proof of that is that whereas
 there was consternation on Taiwan when
 this policy was announced, everything
 has calmed down and the people there
 now have a sense of assurance that, with
 the people of this country unilaterally in
 back of them-x,pt just industry or busi-
 ness-based, upon what people may do,
 they can now fgel secure in developing
 their society and their economy. I think
 that was the intent of the people of this
 country, which will be expressed by this
 bill.
 So, while I deeply appreciate the fact
 that our colleague who proposes this
 amendment believes it will give more
 assurance to the people of Taiwan, I re-
 spectfully submit that it will give. them
 much less than they have by this bill.
 That would appear from the impracti-
 cality of dreaming for a moment that we
 can get such a thing as this amendment
 proposes, or that there will be any other
 result than the total collapse of what we
 are trying to accomplish, if we should
 accept the amendment and it should be
 incorporated in the law.
 So I hope very much that the Senate
 will reject it.
 Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, there
 have been several references in this dis-
 cussion to the security of Taiwan, and
 how wonderful S. 245 is in that respect.
 It is not wonderful at all. It represents
 a step backward when you compare it
 with the Mutual Defense Treaty which is
 in force today between the United States
 and the Republic of China.
 The section dealing with military ag-
 gression in S. 245 is section 114. Let me
 read what it says. It says it is the policy
 of the United States-
 to consider any effort to resolve the Taiwan
 issue-
 I would like to know what that issue
 is, by the way.
 by other than peaceful means a threat to the
 peace and security of the Western Pacific area
 and of grave concern to the United States;
 What entity is the Western Pacific
 area? And what military forces does that
 entity of the Western Pacific area have
 at its disposal? Will this entity, the West-
 ern Pacific area, come to the defense of
 Taiwan?
 That is vague, deliberately vague lan-
 guage, and it means nothing.
 The very least we could do for our
 friends on Taiwan, whose only sin was
 that they trusted us, would be to obtain
 assurances from the PRC that it will not
 resort- to force against the Republic of
 China. We should have done that months
 ago. I believe such assurances could have
 been obtained; I believe they can still be
 obtained, because the PRC has far more
 to gain by improved relationships be-
 tween our two countries than the United
 States does.
 Our colleague from Idaho has spoken
 of the need for speedy action on this leg-
 islation. I believe our country suffers
 from undue haste in bowing to the de-
 mands of the Communists. Who made all
 the concessions? Did the PRC make one
 major concession? No, they did not. It
 was the United States which made all the
 major concessions. It bowed to the Chi-
 nese demand that we derecognize Tai-
 wan, which. is a sovereign country sup-
 ported by its people. We bowed to their
 demands that we derecognize Taiwan,
 that we terminate our Mutual Defense
 Treaty, and that we withdraw our mili-
 tary presence. That is underway today;
 it is in fact virtually completed.
 Who made all the concessiosn? We
 did. I suggest that haste has botched up
 this thing. President Carter made a very
 poor deal, which stinks to high heaven
 and begs for rectification. That is what
 my amendment aims to do, Mr. President.
 Mr. President, if there is no further
 debate on this issue from the other side
 of the question, then I am prepared to
 relinquish the remainder of my time.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, a par-
 liamentary inquiry.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Senator will state it.
 Mr. CHURCH. How much time re-
 mains to the opponents of the amend-
 ment?
 The    PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 opponents of the amendment have 5
 minutes remaining.
 Mr. CHURCH. First of all, let me say
 there is a fine irony-I am sorry; has
 the  Senator from New Hampshire
 yielded the floor?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has
 yielded the floor.
 Mr. CHURCH. There is a fine irony
 in this amendment. If it were sponsored
 by a Senator who carries a liberal label,
 I am quite certain that it would be op-
 posed by the very Senators who may vote
 for it. The argument then would be
 how on earth can you trust the word of
 Peking? what good is a written assur-
 ance from Peking? what value does that .
 have to the people on Taiwan? Conserva-
 tives would be in here en masse, criti-
 cizing and ridiculing the amendment,
 suggesting that there is no basis what-
 ever for depending upon any assurance
 from Peking, written or verbal, and that
 the guarantee contained in the amend-
 ment is worthless. '
 I submit, Mr. President, that if we put
 the proposition to the. people on Taiwan
 and asked them, "Which would you
 prefer, a written statement from the

 Peking Government that they never will
 attack you in the future, or a unilateral
 statement by the Government of the
 United States that we base our whole
 new relationship with Peking upon the
 expectation that they will never resort
 to force in the settlement of the Tai-
 wan issue; that furthermore, we pledge
 ourselves to furnishing Taiwan, in the
 future, whatever weapons it may need
 for its own defense; and that further-
 more, we would regard any attack upon
 Taiwan, including a boycott or block-
 ade, to be a threat to the peace and se-
 curity of the Western Pacific and of
 grave concern to the United States."
 Mr. President, I know what they would
 say. They would say, "Give us that uni-
 lateral declaration of support from the
 United States. Do not force us to rely
 upon written assurances from Peking."
 What a fine irony to have this amend-
 ment proposed by the very Senators who
 would ridicule it and vote against it if
 it were sponsored by some liberal Sena-
 tor.
 I find no good reason for the support
 of this amendment and its adoption by
 the Senate. Every Member should know
 that the amendment would kill the bill
 and  suspend  indefinitely  everything
 within the bill that would enable us to
 proceed with our normal relationships
 and our peaceful ties with the people of
 Taiwan.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Will the Sen-
 ator yield?
 Mr. CHURCH. I am happy to yield.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I will be very brief. I support the man-
 ager of the bill, Mr. CHURCH, and the
 ranking p lnority member, Mr. JAVITS, in
 opposing this amendment. I do not for a
 moment speak in derogation of the au-
 thor of the amendment or any of its
 supporters, but I think it would be a se-
 rious mistake if the Senate were to
 adopt this amendment. It would, in my
 judgment, effectively negate all that we
 are seeking to do in the bill. Let me say
 it this way: It would operate ultimately
 to the detriment of the very people about
 whom we are concerned here, in regard to
 our continuing relationships.
 The effect of this amendment would be
 to injure the Status of the people of Tai-
 wan. It would have the realistic effect
 of killing the bill. I am sure the Presi-
 dent would not sign the bill. He would
 veto the bill, if this amendment were in-
 cluded. He would have no alternative.
 The People's Republic of China does
 'not want to injure the relations which
 it is developing with the United States.
 It does not want to jeopardize those re-
 lations. The PRC is in no position to
 - militarily attack Taiwan or to take Tai-
 wan by military force at this time. And,
 at any time in the future that military'
 action might be taken, the United States
 always has the option of acting within
 its constitutional processes in its own
 best national and security interests.
 Mr. President, this amendment does
 not say anything about blockades. It says
 nothing about boycotts. It talks about
 military operations. I do not think there
 is a Member of this body who thinks for
 one moment that the People's Republic
 of China is going to give any written
 assurance that it will not undertake mili-
 tary operations of any nature against
 the people of Taiwan at any time. Pre-
 mier Teng was in this country and he
 stated very clearly that the PRC has no
 intention of taking such action, but he
 would not completely close the door. He
 would not completely forgo the option
 of taking action at some future point.
 I can see from his standpoint why he
 would not do that. He is not going to
 give any written assurances.
 For us now to demand that there be
 written assurances would be to. jeopar-
 dize the very legislation that is in the
 best interests of the people of Taiwan.
 If this amendment passed, I have an
 idea where some other happiness would
 prevail, and that would be the Soviet
 Union.
 Just for once, Mr. President, let us
 think about the interests of our own
 country. We are all interested in Taiwan.
 We are all interested in cultural rela-
 tions, and in continuing educational, sci-
 entific, and trade relations with Taiwan.
 That is what this legislation is all about.
 I think, and I hope most of us believe,
 that this legislation is in the interest not
 only of the people of Taiwan, but of the
 people of the United States.
 So let us think once in a while of what
 is in the best interests of the United
 States.
 Let the Senate adopt this amendment
 and the leader of the Soviet Union will
 say, "Amen." They will say, "Hurrah."
 Perhaps "amen" is not in their lexicon.
 But they would be happy, they would
 be deliriously happy to see this amend-
 ment adopted, because they do not want
 to see the normalization of relations be-
 tween the United States and the People's
 Republic of China go forward.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 NELSON). All time has expired.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I ask for 2 minutes on the bill.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I grant 2
 more minutes on the bill.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 the Soviet leaders do not want to see
 our relations with the People's Republic
 go forward. Normalization was bad news
 in Moscow.
 I do not want to go out of my way to
 offend anybody. We want to continue to
 cooperate with the Soviet Union where
 we can, to be friendly with the Soviet
 leaders. But the interests of the United
 States of America should come first.
 Where do those interests lie? They lie in
 passing this legislation without this
 amendment.
 So let us be concerned about the inter-
 ests of the United States. Let us not for
 a minute, not for 1 minute, be deluded.
 This would not be to the benefit of the
 people of Taiwan. But the leaders of the
 Soviet Government would be delighted to
 see this, because it would be a roadblock
 in the path of normalization of relation-
 ships between the United States and the
 People's Republic of China. I am not for
 1 minute about to support this amend-
 ment, and I hope the Senate will reject
 it shortly.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from New Hampshire.
 S 2577
 Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I
 must say I am delighted at the high-
 powered opposition which floor mana-
 gers have mustered against this amend-
 ment. I certainly was entertained by the
 statements prepared overnight  which
 shows  they  are worried  about this
 amendment. Well, they ought to be.
 I am not opposed to realistic relations
 with the People's Republic of China, Mr.
 President. That has been implied. I am
 not. Neither are a great many of us who
 are opposed to the weaknesses in S. 245.
 I am, however, adamantly opposed to
 knifing our friends, either in the front.
 the back, it the side, and that is what
 President Carter proposes to do.
 My colleagues in this room have auto-
 matically dismissed the possibility that
 the PRC might be willing to grant in
 writing those assurances which I seek.
 I think they might. I point out again
 that the PRC needs us far more badly
 than we need the PRC. Why do we need
 them? I am not against having realistic
 relations with them, but we have gotten
 along beautifully now for decades with-
 out a close connection with the PRC.
 We can get along nicely for a few more
 months without those connections.  T
 say there is a good possibility. that we
 could receive those assurances if we de-
 mand them. They ought to have been
 demanded. We ought now to demand
 them in the President's place.
 There seems to be worry expressed
 about a Presidential veto. Well, what is
 the worry about that? Are we a rubber
 stamp? Must we rubber stamp a bad.
 stinking deal the President has made in
 notifying our friends? I say no. I say let
 us pass this amendment. Let us, in ef-
 fect. renuire the President to go out and
 deal again with the PR.C and come back
 with a deal that is better for our friends.
 Mr. President, if those who oppose me
 in this amendment wish to have no fur-
 ther discussion. I am prepared at this
 time to relinquish the remainder of my
 time.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President. I am
 prepared to yield back my time. I believe
 it has expired anyway.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time
 yielded back? All time has been yielded
 back.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I move to
 table the amendment and I ask for the
 yeas and nays.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a
 sufficient second? There is a sufficient
 second.
 The yeas and nays were ordered.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
 tion is on agreeing to the notion of the
 Senator from Idaho. The yeas and nays
 have been ordered and the clerk will call

 The legislative clerk called the roll.

 So the motion to lay on the table
 Amendment No. 101, as modified, was

 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I move to
 reconsider the vote by which the motion
 to table was agreed to.
 Mr. JAVITS. I move to lay that motion
 on the table.
 The motion to lay on the table was
 agreed to.
 AMENDMENT NO. 99
 (Purpose: To permit individuals representing
 the people on Taiwan to be admitted to
 the Senate diplomatic gallery)
 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have
 an amendment at the desk and ask that
 it be stated.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 amendment will be stated.
 The second assistant legislative clerk
 read as follows:
 The  Senator  from Mississippi (Mr.
 COCHRAN) proposes amendment No. 99.
 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that further reading
 of the amendment be dispensed with.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 The amendment is as follows:
 On page 13, line 15, before "The" Insert
 (a)?
 On page 13, after line 24, insert the fol-
 lowing:
 "(b) In exercising its duty under paragraph
 2 of rule XXXIV of the Standing. Rules of
 the Senate, the Committee on Rules and Ad-
 ministration of the Senate shall issue regula-
 tions providing that the head and first sec-
 retary of the instrumentality referred to in
 section 109, and their families and suites,
 shall be admitted to the gallery in the Senate
 Chamber set apart for the use of the diplo-
 matic oorps. This subsection is enacted as
 an exercise of the rulemaking power of the
 Senate.".
 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the
 purpose of this amendment, which is to
 section 113 of the bill before the Senate,
 is to require that there be extended to
 the first Secretary, and others designated
 in the amendment, the privileges of the
 diplomatic gallery for those who are in
 that capacity representing the instru-
 mentality of Taiwan which is created to
 carry on relations here in the United
 States.
 It is in keeping, in my judgment, Mr.
 President, with the intentment of the
 section as it now reads.
 I hope that through discussions here
 on the floor with the distinguished chair-
 man of the Committee on Foreign Rela-
 tions and the: distinguished chairman of
 .the Committee on Rules and Adminis-
 tration that we may establish that this
 can, in fact, be done under the existing
 rules of the Senate. If it cannot, then we
 would pursue the amendment.
 With that hope in mind, Mr. President,
 I reserve the remainder of my time, to
 permit the distinguished charman of the
 Committee on Foreign Relations to re-
 spond to this hope.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, it is my
 understanding that the objective of the
 amendment lies within the discretion of
 the Committee on Rules and Adminis-
 tration of the Senate. Therefore, it
 would not be necessary nor advisable to
 write this language nito the statute.
 I note that the able chairman of the
 Senate Committee on Rules and Admin-
 istration is present; and with the Sena-
 tor's permission, I will ask him, as the
 chairman, to respond to the Senator's
 question.
 Mr. PELL. I am glad to do so.
 Mr. President, as we know, the diplo-
 matic gallery-the gallery on the south
 side, behind the clock very often is
 empty. It is entirely for diplomats,
 except the first and second rows on the
 east side. The first one on the east side
 is for guests of the President, and the
 second one is for guests of the Vice
 President. All the other rows are for
 diplomats. The original rule said that it
 was open only to the Secretary of State,
 foreign ministers, and so forth. Through
 usage, this has been expanded to include
 all members of the diplomatic corps.
 From my point of view, I would think
 that, by the same custom of usage, the
 representatives of Taiwan, or Formosa-
 whatever we call it-should continue to
 have the same access to that gallery as
 long as they are being treated as they
 are, in a diplomatic manner, by the Gov-
 ernment of the United States. That is
 my thought, and the thought which I
 would convey to the doorkeepers there.
 If there is any questioning of this
 thought, it can be raised in the Rules
 Committee at a later date, to see if the
 committee will sustain this recommend-
 ation or suggestion of mine. That would
 be my intention.
 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank
 the distinguished manager of the bill. I
 believe that under the provisions of the
 rule, the chairman of the Committeee on
 Rules and Administration clearly has au-
 thority to issue, to such persons who are
 entitled to its privileges, cards which will
 permit them access to that gallery.
 With that assurance, I will withdraw
 my amendment. I ask permission to with-
 draw my amendment.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Senator has a right to withdraw it.
 W. CHURCH. Mr. President, I thank
 the Senator for withdrawing the amend-
 ment in the light of the assurances he
 has received. I appreciate his coopera-
 tion.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill
 is open to further amendment.
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest
 the absence of a quorum.
 The. PRESIDING OFFICER. On whose
 time?
 Mr. HELMS. To be divided equally.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, reserving
 the right to object-and I shall not ob-
 ject-I say to the Senator that-
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Chair cannot hear the Senator.
 Mr. HELMS. I withdraw it, then. The
 time is still running.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, there is
 plenty of time, on the bill. There are 5
 hours on the bill. So I suggest that the
 Senator suggest the absence of a quorum,
 with the time chargeable to the time on
 the bill.
 Mr. HELMS. All right. I suggest the
 absence of a quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 The clerk will call the roll.
 The second assistant legislative clerk
 proceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the order for the
 quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I yield to
 the Senator from New Hampshire.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator from New Hampshire.
 Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, I am
 concerned about a particular provision
 of S. 245; namely, section 113 on page 13
 of the printed document which states:
 The President is authorized and requested,
 under such terms and conditions as he deter-
 mines, to extend to the instrumentality es-
 tablished by the people on Taiwan and the
 appropriate members thereof, referred to in
 section 109, privileges and immunities com-
 parable to those provided to missions of
 foreign countries,.
 And so forth.
 Mr. President, it has been alleged in`
 some quarters, and I do not know wheth-
 er it is true or not, that pressure was
 brought to bear on the Republic of China
 to accept the institute concept, pressure
 along the lines of threats to expell their
 personnel from this country, and I am
 concerned that in the future that kind of
 pressure could be exerted against the
 representatives of the people on Taiwan.
 I am informed by counsel that the
 Senate cannot compel or direct the
 President to grant such privileges and
 immunities, but I wish to solicit the
 opinion of the floor managers relative to
 this section.
 Is it their feeling that.the threat of

 withdrawal of diplomatic privileges and
 immunities by a President in order to
 sway the representatives of the people on
 Taiwan to a particular point of view be
 inappropriate behavior on the part of the
 President?
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. HUMPHREY. I yield.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, in my
 judgment that would run counter to the
 purpose and intent of this section.
 The purpose and intent of this section
 is that the appropriate members, that
 means in my definition, the senior peo
 pie in this Taiwan Institute shall have
 privileges and immunities comparable to
 those provided to missions of foreign
 countries.
 When the President signs this bill
 into law, in my Judgment, he is at the
 same time to follow the intent of Con-
 gress undertaking a moral obligation to
 extend these comparable privileges and
 immunities, and the word "comparable"
 is the word used in the bill, as well as
 the word "appropriate," to the appropri-
 ate members of the Institute, to wit, the
 senior people.
 When he signs the bill, he undertakes
 that moral obligation as a result of the
 intent of Congress in this provision.
 Mr. HUMPHREY. I thank the Senator.
 Mr. CHURCH. I concur in the re-
 marks made by the distinguished rank-
 ing member of the committee.
 Mr. HUMPHREY. I thank the Senator
 very much.
 I understand it is the opinion of the
 Senator that the threat of withdrawal
 of privileges and immunities by a Presi-
 dent would be counter to the intent of
 this section.
 Mr. JAVITS. Based on differences of.
 opinion in trying to make him do some-
 thing he does not want to do, yes.
 Mr. HUMPHREY. Yes.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 does the Senator from North Carolina
 wish to be heard?
 Mr. HELMS. No.
 RECESS FOR i nova
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. I ask unani-
 mous consent that the Senate stand in
 recess for 1 hour, and that the time be
 charged equally against both sides.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 BAUCUS). Without objection, it is so
 ordered.
 Thereupon, at 1:12 p.m., the Senate
 took a recess for 1 hour.
 The Senate reassembled at 2:12 p.m.,
 when called to order by the Presiding
 Officer (Mr. HeLIN).
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Who
 yields time?
 . Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, a parlia-
 mentary inquiry.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator will state it.
 Mr. HELMS. Does the unanimous-con-
 sent agreement automatically bestow
 time upon the Senator from North
 Carolina?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the
 Senator offers an amendment, he will
 have time on his amendment.
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent before we begin with
 my amendment that Vhe distinguished
 Senator from New Menfes ba heard
 briefly.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, we will
 yield 2 minutes to the Senator. I yield 2
 minutes to the Senator.
 Mr. DOMENICI. I thank my friend
 from New York. I do not believe I will
 need 2 minutes.
 Mr. President, the Senate will soon
 complete its work on S. 245, legislation
 designed to outline the framework of our
 future relations with Taiwan. This leg-
 islation is a unique exercise in diplomacy
 because we are seeking to establish quasi-
 official relations with a nation we no
 longer recognize. A special burden is
 placed upon us, and our colleagues in the
 House, because the decisions we make
 could well determine the fate of 17 mil-
 lion people. If we act wisely and firmly
 we will enhance the future security and
 freedom of these people.
 I, along with many of my colleagues,
 are greatly troubled that the executive
 branch yielded to all the major demands
 made by the People's Republic of China
 without receiving any appreciable con-
 cessions in return. By acting as it did,
 the administration did. little to insure
 the future freedom and security of the
 people of Taiwan. It must not be forgot-
 ten that since before the turn of the cen-
 tury, Taiwan has fallen under the con-
 trol of the Chinese Government for less
 than 5 years. Fifty years of Japanese
 rule and 30 years of separate "nation-
 hood" since 1949, have enabled the peo-
 ple on Taiwan to create a distinctly dif-
 ferent socioeconomic-political and cul-
 tural system from the one that exists in
 mainland China.
 In his December 15 speech President
 Carter spo2e of the existence of the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China as a "simple re-
 ality." I do not differ with the President's
 judgment-as far as it goes. There may
 be only one China, as acknowledged by'
 Chinese officials in both Taipei and Pe-
 king, but there are two sovereign gov-
 ernments exercising effective control over
 portions of China's territory. For 30
 years we refused to recognize the exist-
 ence of the People's Republic of China.
 Now, however, we are refusing to recog-
 nize the existence of the 40th largest na-
 tion in the world by population, and our
 eighth largest trading partner. The true
 Asian reality is that there are two Chinas.
 The Foreign Relations Committee has
 gone a long way to compensate for the
 deficiencies that existed in the original
 legislation transmitted to the Congress.
 I commend the members of , the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee for the dili-
 gent effort made to strengthen this leg-
 islation. It is my intention to vote for
 final passage of S. 245.
 Having said that, however. I do not
 want to leave the impression that I be-
 lieve we have done enough to secure the
 future right of self-determination for
 the people of the Republic of China.
 That is why I supported those amend-
 ments that were designed to upgrade fu-
 ture U.S. relations with Taipei, and
 strengthen the degree of our commit-
 ment to the security, freedom, and right
 of self determination for our friends and
 former allies on Taiwan. In particular, I

 not end our involvement with or our
 commitment to Taiwan; it just embarks
 us on a new phase in our relations with
 the people .and the government we have,
 until recently recognized as the Repub-
 lic of China. Many questions remain to
 be answered:
 Can and will the United States, over
 the long run, act forcefully to deter mili-
 tary action against Taiwan?
 Does the United States consider the
 Taiwan Strait to be international water?
 If so, are we prepared to assert ourselves
 to establish and maintain this principle?
 Will the Carter administration and
 succeeding administrations have the will
 and the courage to resist Peking's pro-
 tests and sell. Taiwan the up-to-date
 weapons they will need to maintain a
 modern defense capability?
 Will the United States, in concert with
 our allies, seek to limit the transfer of
 advanced military technology to the PRC
 so as to reduce the danger of aggression
 .against Taiwan and.China's other neigh-
 boring states?
 . If we do sell armaments to the PRC
 in the future, will we insist upon the
 usual restrictions against the use of
 American-supplied weapons for offensive
 purposes? Will we make it clear to Pe-
 king that we will not tolerate the use of
 American-supplied weapons in any at-
 tack upon the territory controlled by the
 Republic of China on December 31, 1978?
 If future Presidents and Congresses
 act with firmness and courage, the future
 of Taiwan can be secure, peaceful, and
 prosperous. That is my hope, as we con-
 clude our consideration of S. 245.
 EXHIBITION 1
 CHINA
 Imagine that 30 years ago there was a tre-
 mendous  uprising  in  the  United  States
 among military elements that backed a to-
 talitarian regime; and imagine further, that
 the uprising won and took over our country.
 We fought and lost; but before the takeover,
 you and I and millions of Americans includ-
 ing the President, managed to escape onto
 the Hawaiian Islands.
 Our friends stood by us. Great Britain was
 particularly horrified over the events and the
 Parliament of Great Britain voted unani-
 mously for a mutual defense pact with us.
 The new dictatorship on the Mainland of
 North America called itself the People's Re-
 public of America. We, on Hawaii, retained
 our flag and name of the United States
 of America because it's what we represented,
 not simply representing Hawaii alone.
 As time passed, new refugees escaped the
 Mainland of America and told us of mil-
 lions who were being tortured and executed
 in   California    . people   we   knew .. .
 friends ... relatives ... and millions upon
 millions  of  others  in  the  country.    We
 learned that all civil liberties had been taken
 away     . that  all  churches  and     syna-
 gogues had been closed .. _. that all                          pri-
 vate property had been confiscated    . no
 free press      . and that in Washington,
 the statues of Lincoln and Jefferson had been
 removed      from  their  memorials  and  de-
 stroyed . . . with the shells of the shrines
 re-dedicated to the conquerors  .  .        . and
 we  learned  that  American     children were
 taken from their parents and educated in
 political schools  with   their  main  course
 being the future takeover of Hawaii. The new
 generation was being brainwashed into being
 political, atheistic robots.
 During the ensuing years, Great Britain
 became engaged in its own foreign conflicts;
 and to keep our side of the Mutual Defense
 Treaty, we sent troops to fight beside the
 British for their cause, and we supplied them
 bases while the People's Republic of America
 killed English soldiers and killed our soldiers
 with them.
 Then, one night, little more than a week
 before Christmas, while Parliament was out
 of session, the new Prime Minister of Eng-
 land, who was unschooled in foreign affairs,
 and a self-proclaimed moralist, went on tele-
 vision, smiled, and said, "In this season of
 peace, I take special pride in announcing
 that as of Jan. 1, 1979, Great Britain will
 recognize the People's Republic of America
 as the sole legal government of America.
 And we acknowledge the People's Republic
 position that there is but one America and
 Hawaii is part of it. And these decisions and
 actions open a new and important chapter
 in world affairs."
 The story I told you is true. Only the
 names have been changed to protect the
 identity of those who are bringing about a
 new world order, without morality, loyalty
 or liberty. Some day, the names we used here

 (Purpose: To declare that the people on
 Taiwan, as defined in this Act, constitute
 an international personality)
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I send to
 the desk an unprinted amendment and
 ask that it be stated.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk
 will report.
 The legislative clerk read as follows:
 The Senator from North Carolina  (Mr.
 HELMS)  proposes an unprinted amendment
 numbered 43:
 On page 14, after line 12, insert the follow-
 ing paragraph:
 "(5) to declare that the people on Taiwan,
 as defined in section 101(b)  of this Act,
 constitute an international personality with
 the right to maintain its territorial integrity
 and sovereignty, notwithstanding the with-
 drawal of diplomatic relations with the en-
 tity recognized by the United States prior
 to January 1, 1979 as the Republic of China."
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as I have
 noted in my additional views in the com-
 mittee report, the legislation before us,
 S. 245, is based upon a fatal contradic-
 tion. At one time or another, to one de-
 gree or another, and in one way or an-
 other, I think most Senators agree with
 that statement because, on the one hand,
 this legislation assumes that the United
 States can continue a normal relation-
 ship with the people on Taiwan but, on
 the other hand, it dismisses all the at-
 tributes of sovereignty upon which such
 a relationship could be based.
 The committee report itself attempts
 to draw a distinction between domestic
 law and international law. The report
 says on page 7:
 The Administration has stated that it rec-
 ognizes the People's Republic of China (PRC)
 as the sole legal government of China. It
 has also acknowledged the Chinese position
 that Taiwan is a part of China, but the
 United States has not itself agreed to this
 position. The bill submitted by the Admin-
 istration takes no position on the status of
 Taiwan under international law, but does re-
 gard Taiwan as a country for purposes of
 U.S. domestic law. The bill assumes that any
 benefits to be conferred on Taiwan by statute
 may be conferred without regard to Taiwan's
 international legal identity.
 I note also that our official policy to-
 ward Taiwan is referred to on page 6
 as "derecognition," a term, I believe,
 which has no basis in international law.
 And further on, on page 6, the committee
 report correctly summarizes the admin-
 istration testimony:
 ,The Administration did not press the PRC
 for a pledge not to use force against Taiwan
 during the negotiations preceding normal-
 ization, on the ground that no Chinese gov-
 erment would renounce the use of force
 against what it regarded as a province of
 China-a position repeatedly stated by the
 PRC.  However,  the  Administration  states
 that it made clear to the PRC that nor-
 malization rested upon the expectation that
 the Taiwan issue would be resolved peace-
 fully.
 Thus, Mr. President, the report makes
 this clear that the United States is seek-
 ing to avoid any action in international
 law which would prejudice the PRC
 claim, the Red Chinese claim, to exer-
 cise  sovereignty  over  Taiwan,  our
 friend, our ally, and anti-Communist
 government. This in itself is an action
 that obviously supports the claim of the
 People's Republic of China.
 But is it really possible to take one
 position in our domestic law, and an-
 other in our conduct of international
 relations? In the judgment of the Sen-
 ator from North Carolina, it is an im-
 possibility. So the question that we must
 really settle before we act upon this
 legislation, is whether the arrangement
 is one that is expected to continue in-
 definitely, or whether it is a framework
 for the so-called peaceful transition
 of the people of Taiwan into domination
 under the Communist yoke.
 That is the essential question. Much
 as I regret to raise this question this
 afternoon, it is one that in good con-
 science the Senator from North Caro-
 lina cannot avoid or ignore.
 Although the.committee report seems
 to say that we can ignore Taiwan's in-
 ternational status while concentrating
 on our domestic law, let us look at that
 status for a moment. For, if the United
 States does not make clear its position
 on the international status of Taiwan,
 we will not be able to challenge success-
 fully  any  threatening  PRC  moves
 against  Taiwan.  Moreover, Taiwan's
 status does not depend objectively upon
 what the President of the United States
 does or says. Its status is independent
 of what we say. Yet in the long run
 Taiwan must be able to defend its status,
 either alone, or with the help of allies.
 By withdrawing our support of what,
 Taiwan believes to be its status, we, as
 Taiwan's major ally, are actually con-
 tributing to the demise of that status.
 So we cannot escape the consequences
 of our actions. As testimony presented to
 the committee by Professor Hungdah
 Chiu has pointed out, the Government of
 the Republic of China has had effective.
 control of Taiwan for more than 30 years.
 The Republic of China possesses all four
 essential elements of statehood in inter-
 national law, namely: First, a defined
 territory;- second, a permanent popula-
 tion; third, a government; and fourth,
 the capacity to enter into international
 relations. There is nothing in interna-
 tional law to prevent the United States
 from recognizing the Republic of China,
 even if the United States at the same
 time recognizes the People's Republic of
 China.

 March 13, 1979          CONGRIESSXONAIL RECORD - SIENA1I'IE
 As Professor Chiu stated:
 How can the United States maintain its
 existing close relations, including treaty re-
 lations, with Taiwan without recognizing
 the Republic of China in Taiwan's interna-
 tional personality? According to internation-
 al law, "the existence in fact of a new stag
 or a new government is not dependent on its
 recognition by other states." (Hackwor'th.
 Digest of International Law, Vol. 1, 1940, p.
 161). This principle also finds support in the
 1933 Inter-American Covention on Rights
 and Duties of States which provided in
 Article 3 that "The political existence of the
 state is independent of recognition by other
 states." While the United States may not
 want to formally recognize the ROC even as
 a state and government within the territory
 under its control, it may take    position
 somewhere in between recognition and non-
 recognition with respect to the international
 legal status of the Republic of China in
 Taiwan.
 The point is, Mr. President, that we
 cannot "derecognize" Taiwan. We can
 recognize Peking as the "sole govern-
 ment of China" if we wish; but once we
 have recognized Taiwan and Taiwan
 continues to control its territory, we can-
 not take back that recognition. We can
 break relations, or withdraw our Ambas-
 sador. We did that to our enemies in
 World War U. But it is impossible to
 withdraw recognition. Not eyen the Pres-
 ident has claimed to withdraw recogni-
 tion. He has made no statement to that
 effect at all. Nor have administration
 spokesmen made any such statement.
 Rather, they have asserted that the
 United States takes no position on the
 PRC's claim to Taiwan. All that we have
 done is to withdraw diplomatic represen-
 tation from Taiwan.
 But I ask, Mr. President, is it possible
 to revise our domestic law, as the pend-
 ing bill would do, without taking a posi-
 tion in international law? I submit that
 it is not. If we do not admit that the
 Republic of China Government is the
 legal governing authority on Taiwan,
 how can we have any relationship at all
 that is legal in international law? Can
 we have any relationship with the peo-
 ple of any nation that is not sanctioned
 first by the governing authorities in that
 territory?  And if the authorities in
 Peking are the legitimate authorities-
 the "sole government," in the President's
 term-then how can we continue a rela-
 tionship with a rival entity that claims
 to be the governing authority on Tai-
 wan?
 How can we sell military equipment
 and arms to the people on Taiwan when
 we have recognized Peking as the "sole
 government" of China? Are we not,
 then, selling arms to a rebellious prov-
 ince? And more to the point, how can
 the United States itself defend Taiwan
 against any economic or military pres-
 sure from the government that we have
 declared to be the sole. government of
 China?
 Mr. President, I think that it is clear
 in international law that we have no
 right to do any of these things under the
 circumstances. This bill says that the
 President can conduct relations with the
 people on Taiwan; but the President has
 recognized another government as the
 sole government of China.
 This bill says that we can maintain
 commercial, cultural, and other rela-
 tions with the people on Taiwan; but
 under international law, such relations
 cannot be conducted with "a people."
 This bill says that the United States will
 assist the people on Taiwan to maintain
 a  sufficient  self-defense  capability
 through the provision of arms of a de-
 fensive character; but how can we pro-
 vide arms to the people on Taiwan when
 we refuse to take a clear position on the
 international status of the people to
 whom we are supplying the arms?
 It should be plain, Mr. President, that
 we bannot accept the sophistry that our
 domestic law can authorize something
 that is in conflict with our position in in-
 ternational law. We must resolve that
 conflict before we approve this legisla-
 tion.
 =Mr. President, I think that a middle
 position can be found that would recog-
 nize the realities of the situation with-
 out invading the President's preroga-
 tives or powers. The basic principles
 would be as follows :
 First. A middle way would not contra-
 dict                                                the 'President's  statement  that
 Peking is the sole government of China.
 Second. A middle way would not'insist
 upon diplomatic relations, government-
 to-government relations, or any com-
 ment upon the legality of the governing
 authorities of the people on Taiwan.
 Third. A middle way would confirm
 that the people on Taiwan had the right
 to act to maintain their independence
 from  the  mainland  regardless  of
 whether peaceful or military pressures
 were imposed.     ?
 Now we get down to the difficult ques-
 tions Mr. President. That is why I am
 proposing that a fifth paragraph be
 added in section 114 in the declaration of
 the policy of the United States. This
 paragraph would say that it is the policy
 of the United States "to declare that the
 people on Taiwan, as defined in section
 101(b) of this act, constitute an inter-
 national personality with the right to
 maintain its territorial integrity and
 sovereignty, notwithstanding the with-
 drawal of diplomatic relations with the
 entity recognized by the United States
 prior to January 1, 1979 as the Republic
 of China."
 Now what about this language-what
 does it do? First of all it is a declaration
 of U.S. policy. Taiwan's rights do not
 derive from what the United States says
 about those rights; but a declaration of
 policy with the force of law makes it
 clear where we stand, and enables us to
 defend Taiwan against the protests of the
 PRC.
 Second, it states that the people on
 Taiwan constitute an international per-
 sonality; that is to say, they are a dis-
 tinct entity that can be treated in a way
 distinct from the mainland.
 Third, it provides the basis for the
 defense of the territorial integrity of that
 personality.
 Fourth, it declares that the people on
 Taiwan are not in violation of interna-
 tional law in conducting international
 relations and defensive actions.
 Fifth, it would solve an anomalous
 S 2581
 problem that has not yet been addressed;
 namely, the legal status of the mutual
 Defense Treaty.
 We have walked all around the peri-
 phery on this issue, but we have not
 come to a confrontation with it.
 As we all know, the President on
 December 15 announced that he would
 give 1 year's notice of termination of the
 Mutual Defense Treaty on January 1,
 1979, and did so. Yet on the same date,
 he recognized Peking as the "sole govern-
 ment" of China. That being the rase, it
 would appear that for one more year we
 have a treaty with an entity which we do
 not recognize as a state.
 Now it should be recognized that the
 Mutual Defense Treaty is not with the
 so-called people on Taiwan. The treaty
 is with the Republic of China. Perhaps
 we can can somehow change our domestic
 law to enable us to have relations with
 the people on Taiwan, but we cannot
 unilaterally change the terms of an in-
 ternational treaty. Whether we like it or
 not, for one more year we have a Mutual
 Defense Treaty with the Republic of
 China, even though we have withdrawn
 diplomatic representation. Therefore, in
 order to abide by our international obli-
 gations, we must take action that takes
 note of Taiwan's status as an interna-
 tional personality, capable of defending
 its territorial integrity and sovereignty.
 If that is not the policy of the United
 States, then we have no right to be fur-
 nishing arms to the people on Taiwan.
 Alternatively, if that is not the policy
 of the United States, then the proper 1
 year's notice, required under the treaty.
 was not given. If we ceased to recognize
 Taiwan as an entity with an interna-
 0
 tional personality on January 1, then the
 President gave only 15 days notice, not 1
 year's notice.
 The logic of it is very simple. We can-
 not continue defending an entity that
 has no right of self-defense, not even
 for 1 year. Either the President gave 1
 year's notice, or he did not. If this legis-
 lation before us is to have any consis-
 tency whatsoever, it has to take a stand
 on whether or not it is proper under in-
 ternational law to extend military as-
 sistance to the people on Taiwan as an
 entity with international personality and
 the right of self-defense. If we do not
 take such a stand, then we are declaring
 that the President acted improperly in
 only giving 2 week's notice, instead of 1
 year's notice, of termination of the
 treaty. A vote against this amendment.
 then, is a vote against the President.
 Mr. President, this amendment does
 not invade the President's perogatives.
 It is only a declaration of policy, like the
 other four paragraphs of this section.
 and just as valid as the other four para-
 graphs. It does not insist upon diplo-
 matic relations with the people on Tai-
 wan. It is not incompatible with the
 concept of the American Institute on
 Taiwan. And finally, it does not contra-
 dict any of the publicly expressed agree-
 ments with Peking.
 If we really believe that the people
 on Taiwan have the right to resist uni'
 fication, have the right to resist coming

 re      'on has not affected the manner in
 whi h the authorities and 17 million inhabit-
 ants of Taiwan conduct their affairs. The
 United States simply is acknowledging the
 fact that Taiwan continues to manage its
 affairs in an autonomous manner.
 I should note that the above suggestion
 does not violate the principle of one China.
 The de facto entity concept deals with pres-
 ent political realities, and does not require
 or preclude eventual reunification or any
 other outcome. Indeed, Vice-Premier Teng's
 recent indication that Taiwan may retain its
 own political and economic systems as well
 as maintain separate armed forces acknowl-
 edges the same realities.
 The United States may derive some short
 term benefits from refusing to clarify the
 legal rationale for continued dealings with
 Taiwan. After all, explicitly calling it a de
 facto entity would aggravate the PRO, while
 adopting the successor government theory
 would damage Taiwan. This policy of inten-
 tional ambiguity may be difficult to maintain
 for an indeterminate time. In the years to
 come I suspect that we will see many situa-
 tions where the PRC would attempt to assert
 its position as the successor. Each instance
 would set a precedent for future dealings.
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, if my
 friend from Idaho would not object, I
 would like to raise a few questions with
 him and perhaps we can come to an un-
 derstanding on this question.
 Does the Senator believe the People's
 Republic of China has de j ure sovereignty
 over Taiwan?
 Mr. CHURCH. I think that the exist-
 ing Government on Taiwan, the one we
 formerly recognized as the Republic of
 China, has the de facto jurisdiction over
 the people of Taiwan. It is the de facto
 government.
 Mr. HELMS. So the answer to my
 question is "Yes"?
 Mr. CHURCH. I would prefer to state
 the answer in my own words, if the Sen-
 ator does not mind.
 Mr. HELMS. I am not trying to-
 Mr. CHURCH. Rather than say "Yes"
 I rely instead upon the answer that I
 gave the Senator. to his question.
 Mr. HELMS. Will the Senator repeat
 it?
 Mr. CHURCH. My answer to the Sen-
 ator's question was that the government
 in Taipei is the de facto government of
 Taipei. It is in charge and presently ex-
 ercises jurisdiction over the people liv-
 ing on Taiwan.
 Mr. HELMS. If it is a de facto gov-
 ernment over Taiwan, then it obviously
 would have sovereignty. I understand
 what the Senator is saying.
 As the Senator said earlier-
 Mr. CHURCH. If the Senator would
 not  mind  my  intervention  at that
 .,point-
 Mr. HELMS. Not at all.
 Mr. CHURCH. I think that the sub-
 ject of sovereignty is a broader subject,
 inasmuch as the government in Taipei
 as well as the government in Peking hold
 to the proposition that there is but one
 China and that Taiwan is part of that
 China.
 So the argument having to do with the
 exact legal status of Taiwan under those
 conditions is one we prudently could
 leave to the Chinese.
 It is a problem for them to resolve in
 the fullness of time. I believe it would be
 unwise for us to attempt to define the
 exact legal status of the Government in
 Taipei for purposes of this legislation.
 Mr. HELMS. What we are doing with
 this legislation is understanding our po-
 sition for ourselves here in the Senate. I
 take it that we are not attempting to dic-
 tate either to Peking or to Taiwan.
 Mr. CHURCH. The Senator is correct.
 We are not.
 Mr. HELMS. Let me ask the Senator
 this: Does Peking have the right to de-
 fend the people on Taiwan?
 Mr. CHURCH. I believe that is a ques-
 tion that can be answered only by the
 Government in Peking. But the fact Is
 that the Government in Taipei possesses
 the means to defend the island and its
 people, and it has expressed the deter-
 mination to do so.
 Mr. HELMS. That was my next ques-
 tion: Does the Government in Taipei
 have the right to defend the people of
 Taiwan?
 Mr. CHURCH. The Government in
 Taipei asserts that right, and we do not
 quarrel with it. In fact, as the Senator
 knows, we have expressly included in
 this bill, as a part of the stated policy
 of the United States, that we will assist
 the people on Taiwan to maintain a
 sufficient self-defense capability through
 the provision of arms of a defensive
 character.
 Mr. HELMS. I take it that the Senator
 will not seriously object to this Sena-
 S 2583
 Mr. CHURCH. And we do that, I say
 to the Senator.
 Mr. HELMS. That is the purpose of
 this amendment.
 Mr. CHURCH. We do that exceedingly
 well I think. My compliments to the
 committee and, indeed, to the Senator,
 himself. I think he contributed to the
 definition that we set forth on line 19,
 page 8, under title 1 of the bill, section
 101(b), which reads:
 Except as provided in section 205(d) of
 this Act, the term "people on Taiwan", as
 used in this Act, shall mean and include the
 governing authority on Taiwan, recognized
 by the United States prior to January 1, 1979
 as the Republic of China; its agencies, in-
 strumentalities, and political subdivisions;
 and the people governed by it in the islands
 of Taiwan and the Pescadores.
 I do not know how we could better de-
 fine the people on Taiwan than in the
 words chosen by the committee.
 Mr. HELMS. As the able Senator
 knows, the difficulty is not in what he
 and I may want. We are trying to obtain
 a piece of legislation that will escape
 being regarded as a sham.
 I ask the Senator this: Does the with-
 drawal  of  diplomatic  representation
 constitute withdrawal of recognition
 that the governing authorities of the
 people of Taiwan constitute an interna-
 tional entity?
 Mr. CHURCH. I am unable to answer
 the Senator's question, because I do not
 Taiwan occupy a defined territory. Is_ believe it is within our power to define
 that right?                              an entity for purposes of international
 Mr. CHURCH. I agree.
 Mr. HELMS. And he would not object
 to my assertion that the people on Tai-
 wan have effectively controlled that ter-
 ritory for 30 years.
 Mr. CHURCH. I agree.
 Mr. HELMS. And I take it that he
 would not dispute my assertion that the
 people on Taiwan have. governing au-
 thority at this time.
 Mr. CHURCH. I agree.
 Mr. HELMS. I take it that he would
 not dispute that the people on Taiwan
 have carried on international relations
 for more than 30 years and are continu-
 ing to carry on international relations.
 Mr. CHURCH. I agree.
 Mr. HELMS. The Senator was good
 enough to say earlier that a government
 exists on Taiwan.
 Mr. CHURCH. I agree. And is not that
 enough?
 Mr. HELMS. No, sir.
 Mr. CHURCH. Do we have to go fur-
 ther and attempt to define its exact
 status in international law, when that
 would complicate matters for us? ,
 The purpose of this bill, as the Sena-
 tor knows, is to serve the interests of the
 United States by continuing to maintain
 commercial and cultural relations with
 the people on Taiwan. It is not necessary
 that we define their legal status with
 precision.
 Mr. HELMS. The Senator, I am sure,
 would acknowledge that the Senator
 from North Carolina is not trying to
 confuse the issue. My purpose is to try
 to make clear the status of Taiwan for
 the purposes of enacting this legislation.
 the floor?
 Mr. CHURCH. I believe the Senator
 from North Carolina has.
 Mr. JAVITS. I believe we should yield
 on our time.
 Mr. HELMS. We can work that out.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. CHURCH. I yield.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I rise be-
 cause this is the particular point which
 it seems to me is critical. I ask the
 Senator from North Carolina to follow
 me carefully.
 Mr. HELMS. I am delighted to do so.
 Mr. JAVITS. It is a legal argument.
 We have proceeded on the theory that
 we are drawing a statute which will de-
 termine our action unilaterally..
 Mr. HELMS. Precisely.
 Mr. JAVITS. Whether we will give
 them arms, whether we will come to their
 defense, whether we will trade with
 them, whether we will give their people
 the right to sit in the gallery, whether
 we will give them a house and home here,
 like Twin Oaks, and so on. We have dealt
 with all that. Those are things we can
 do.
 The thing that troubles me about this
 amendment-
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER   (Mr.
 PRYOR). The time of the Senator from
 North Carolina has expired.
 Mr. JAVITS. The Senator has yielded
 on our time. I yield myself 5 minutes on
 our time.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator may proceed.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE         March 13, 1979
 Mr. HELMS. I say to the Senator that
 I have no intention of calling up another
 amendment, so perhaps we can have
 latitude in the disposition of time.
 Mr. JAVITS. The thing that troubles
 me about this amendment is that the
 Senator from North Carolina wants us
 to say something we cannot say but
 which only they can say. That is the real
 sticking point.
 We have defined the people on Taiwan
 as including the governing authorities
 on Taiwan. We say that in section 101
 (b), page 8, line 21: "the term 'people on
 Taiwan,' as used in this act, shall mean
 and include the governing authority on
 Taiwan."
 The Senator from North Carolina
 wants to say that this governing author-
 ity on Taiwan has the right to maintain
 its territorial integrity and sovereignty.
 We say, "We are sorry, Senator HELMS.
 We don't have to say that in order to do
 all the things we want to do for them in
 this act unilaterally."
 So let them say that, if they wish; and
 if they want to fight with the People's
 Republic of China about that concept,
 that is their problem. We may or may
 not come to their defense if they do that.
 We said here that we have to go through
 our constitutional processes, and so
 forth, and we did not contemplate that
 kind of quarrel between them; because
 in the Shanghai communique they, too,
 said they were part of China. But if they
 want to do this, that is their pigeon, not
 ours.
 That is the real sticking point in this
 thing. The Senator from North Carolina
 wants to do something which we cannot
 make or unmake; only they can do that.
 That defeats the whole concept of this
 legislation. That is why I cannot accept
 the amendment.
 All the law we had cited to us says
 that the authorities on Taiwan, the peo-
 ple on Taiwan, are whatever we make it,
 whatever we say it is. If we say it can
 sue in the United States, it can sue. If we
 say it can own property, can trade, can
 have agents, can have an office, that is
 it. But we cannot say that these authori-
 ties on Taiwan have "the right to main-
 tain its territorial integrity and sover-
 eignty." That is not in our power; that
 is in their power, if they want to do it.
 Mr. HELMS. Obviously, it is within
 their power.'
 Mr. JAVITS. Therefore, this amend-
 ment defeats the concept of what we are
 trying to deal with here, and that is why
 I would have to oppose it.
 Mr. HELMS. I just do not see how it
 does defeat anything of interest to the
 United States; it merely makes explicit
 the implicit rationale of the bill.
 I presume that I may ask a few more
 questions, even though the time situa-
 tion is tight.
 Mr. CHURCH. On our time.
 Mr. JAVITS. There is no problem with
 that. Po not worry about that.)
 Mr. HELMS. Can the United States
 supply arms to an entity which we do not
 recognize?)
 Mr. JAVITS. Of course. Why not?
 There is no law of the United States that
 I knc-a of, and we are making this one
 prec=.ct everyth.ing, .so even if there is
 one that I do not know about this pre-
 empt-so it. We have a full preemption
 clause in hare which I wrote myself pre-
 c.sely for that reason, so there could be
 no question about it. Notwithstanding
 any other raw, we say "was gi7en suf-
 ficient arms." We can do it. That is
 something we control.
 Mr. CHURCH. Besides we have an
 many occasions in the put furnished
 arms to groups that we did not officially
 recognize as governmental entities.
 Mr. HELMS. Such as?
 Mr. CHURCH. Such as the guerrilla
 forces during World War II in various
 countries,  including  Yugoslavia.  The
 United States is not limited to dealing
 only with governments that it officially
 recognizes.
 As the Senator from New York has
 pointed out, the very purpose of this
 bill is to establish an unofficial basis for
 continuing to do business with the peo-
 ple on Taiwan.
 Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator for
 his statement that the United States
 is not limited to dealing only with gov-
 ernments that it officially recognizes. If
 I could ask the Senator from New York,
 does he feel that with this legislation we
 are saying that Taiwan is subject to the
 sovereignty of Peking?
 Mr. JAVITS. No. We are taking no
 position on that except whatever may
 be implied from the fact that we have
 recognized Peking. I do not know what
 that is. It is going to be very arguable.
 Nonetheless, that is something that in
 this world we cannot settle everything.
 Mr. CHURCH. It is, after all, a Chi-
 nese question to be settled among the
 Chinese themselves.
 Mr. JAVITS. That is right.
 Mr.  HELMS.  The  Senator  under-
 stands that. I do not purport that we
 have the right to settle that question
 for China, either one of them, and I am
 pleased with the distinguished Senator's
 clarification that with this legislation
 we are not saying- that Taiwan is sub-
 ject to the sovereignty of Peking. I am
 just saying for our own purposes- that
 this legislation should be clear as to the
 position of the United States, and it
 has not been sufficiently clear to me.
 That is my problem.
 Mr. JAVITS. Let me restate my prop-
 osition, I say to Senator  HELMS.  My
 proposition is that there is an entity,
 a people, and a structure which satis-
 fies the definition of 101(b), to wit,
 there are people and there are govern-
 ing authorities on Taiwan.
 Mr. HELMS. Therefore, a government.
 Mr. JAVITS. Pardon?
 Mr. HELMS. Therefore, a government.
 Mr.  JAVITS.  I cannot  say  that.
 There are governing authorities. That
 is what we said here. There are govern-
 ing authorities.
 Now, then, whatever we wish to do
 with them we can do under our domestic
 law. We can say they can, buy, they can
 sell, they can own, they can sue, they
 can sit in the gallery, and so on. That is
 complete as far as we are concerned.
 But when the Senator is going to ask
 us to say that they have the right to
 maintain their territorial integrity and
 sovereignty, I say we do not.
 Mr. CHURCH. That is an interna-
 tional issue.
 Mr. JAVITS. This is net within our
 power or authority or the whole concept
 of this legislation. If they feel that way,
 they will do what they can about it, if
 anything. But we cannot give it to them.
 We cannot confer it an them, and we
 should not. And it is unnecessary to the
 purpose of this particular piece of legis-
 lation.
 Mr. HELMS. It is not the intention of
 my amendment to confer status upon
 Taiwan-only to provide the rationale
 for this unique legislation. Will the Sen-
 ator say that it is U.S. policy insofar as
 we are concerned to allow Taiwan to re-
 sist unification if it des?res to do so?
 Mr. JAVITS. I m not going to pass on
 that because it Is unnecessary to the de-
 cision of this case, I say to the Senator
 from North Carolina. All that I say is
 that we will give them sufficient moneys
 to resist any effort to suffocate, suppress,
 or coerce them, and that is what we say
 and that is what we mean and we will do
 it. But as to their decision as to how
 they will deal with the People's Repub-
 lic of China, no. We will give them the
 means, but they make the decision.
 Mr. HELMS. The Senator from Idaho
 had some problem with the word "per-
 sonality." Would he feel more secure if
 I inserted "entity" there instead of "per-
 sonality"?
 Mr. CHURCH. I do not think so. This
 amendment, I say with all due deference
 to the distinguished Senator, is funda-
 mentally flawed.
 Mr. HELMS. Just like this bill is.
 Mr. CHURCH. Well-
 Mr. HELMS. And that is the problem.
 It is going to be a lawyer's paradise, I
 will tell the Senator that.
 Mr. CHURCH. The Senator may vote
 for or against the bill. I think the Sen-
 ator is going to vote for it. I do not pre-
 dict the Senator's vote, but I will be sur-
 prised if he does not vote for it, because
 it does many of the things that he and
 I both want to see done for Taiwan.
 Mr. HELMS. It Is the only game in
 town as the Senator knows.
 Mr. CHURCH. And it is a bill that the
 committee has strengthened and im-
 proved. We bring to the Chamber with
 pride, and I commend the Senator for
 his part. He was a fellow architect of
 this bill. He joined with us in improving,
 strengthening, and perfecting this bill.
 Mr. HELMS. I did the best I could.
 Mr. CHURCH. Yes, the Senator did.
 Mr. JAVITS. He did mighty well.
 Mr. CHURCH. Now, the Senator goes
 too far with this amendment, because all'
 we can do in this bill is to determine
 how as a matter of our domestic law we
 are going to deal with the people and
 governing authorities and other entities
 that exist in Taiwan. That is all the Sen-
 ate has the authority to do. But the
 amendment offered by the Senator from
 North Carolina goes further and at-
 tempts to define the status of Taiwan
 under international law, which Is beyond

 the province of the Senate of the United
 States.
 Mr. HELMS. This Senator has not
 done anything except state what inter-
 national law is. I went down the four
 points generally accepted in interna-
 tional law and the Senator said yes to
 each one of them. So, in effect, what the
 Senator says was that the people on
 Taiwan have sovereignty. But we have
 made a pretty good legislative history
 here.
 Is there no way that we could modify
 this amendment so that it would be more
 appealing to my friend? I will be willing
 to strike the word "sovereignty" and in-
 sert the word "security" if that will help.
 Mr. CHURCH. Yesterday the Senator
 had more amendments accepted to this
 bill than any other Member of this body.
 Mr. HELMS. I appreciated the distin-
 guished  chairman's . cooperation  and
 comity.
 Mr. CHURCH. And I would appreciate
 it very much if as a reciprocal gesture
 the  Senator  would  Withdraw this
 amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the
 time on the amendment has expired.
 Mr. JAVITS. I yield him time on the
 bill.
 Mr. HELMS. As I said earlier, Mr.
 President, there was a total period of
 3 hours set aside for three amendments
 by the Senator from North Carolina,
 and I am willing to dispense with two of
 them provided we can ventilate this one
 a little bit.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield for a question?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection?
 Mr. HELMS. I do not have any time,
 but I am sure the Senator from New
 York will yield time.
 Mr. JAVITS. I yield time.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. I have been listen-
 ing to this debate, and I have read the
 Senator's amendment. I might say for
 the edification of my friend from North
 Carolina that I discussed this with the
 Taiwan people. In fact, I first discussed
 it when they were summarily tossed out
 of the United Nations.
 You can very well call yourself an-
 other nation. You do not have to be a
 part of China.
 And I took this matter up again in a
 friendly way with Ambassador Shen, and
 he did not make any comments about it.
 I hate to find myself in the position of
 disagreeing with my friend, but I do be-
 lieve that if Taiwan is to become a
 separate nation it is up to the people
 living on Taiwan to'make that decision.
 I really do not think that we have the
 power. As I say, I have agreed with my
 two friends from the Foreign Relations
 Committee before but damn seldom, but
 I find myself in agreement with. them
 this time.
 Mr. HELMS. I say to the Senator, if
 the able chairman will yield to me, I
 do not propose nor does this amend-
 ment propose to stipulate what either
 China may do or,be. This amendment
 is simply for the purposes of the U.S.
 Senate understanding the role of the
 U.S. Government in this thing.
 I am perfectly willing to strike the
 word  "sovereignty"  and  substitute
 therefor the word "security." I am not
 trying to take over any responsibility of
 either Peking or Taiwan.
 This amendment does not declare
 Taiwan a nation. It only stipulates that
 it is an entity, which it is, and which
 has been admitted, acknowledged, on
 this floor. It is an entity with which we
 can legitimately deal.
 I say to my friend from Arizona there
 is no disagreement between him and me.
 I shall always be distressed when there
 is.
 But I say again that while the dis-
 tinguished Senator from New York, the
 distinguished Senator from Idaho and
 some of the rest of us have worked hard
 on this thing, it is still going to be a
 lawyer's paradise. It could be described
 as the Lawyers' Relief Act of 1979.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 question before the Senate,  as the
 Chair sees it, is the Senator from North
 Carolina has requested that 2 hours on
 the other two amendments be trans-
 ferred to the pending amendment be-
 fore the Senate. Is there objection?
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we do not
 need that. I thought we could abandon
 the time, and we are just about through.
 Mr. CHURCH. There are some other
 amendments we need to take up at some
 other time.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The re-
 quest is withdrawn.
 Who yields time?
 Mr. HELMS. I wish to speak frankly
 With the chairman and ranking Re-
 publican of the committee, and I ask
 that it be in order for me to suggest
 the absence of a quorum, with the time
 bharged to no one.
 Mr.  GOLDWATER. Mr. President,
 can I mace a parliamentary inquiry?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Senator will state it..
 Mr. GOLDWATER. Do I understand
 that we vote on this matter by 5 o'clock
 regardless?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Senator is correct.
 Mr.  GOLDWATER.  I  thank the
 Chair.
 Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence
 of a quorum.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 clerk will call the roll.
 The assistant legislative clerk pro-
 ceeded to call the roll.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The. Sen-
 ator from North Carolina is recognized.
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the order for
 the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I have
 been very pleased with the legislative
 history that has been made here in
 discussing this  amendment.  I think
 nothing more can be accomplished by
 a rollcall vote, whether it went with me
 or against me.
 I want to say to my friend from Idaho
 and my friend from New York that I
 appreciate their candor in their effort
 to clarify certain issues, and I think
 they have.
 S 2585
 With that in mind and with my grati-
 tude to them, Mr. President, I withdraw
 the amendment.
 The  PRESIDING OFFICER.  The
 amendment is withdrawn.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I want
 to thank the distinguished Senator from
 North Carolina for his cooperation. I am
 grateful to him for withdrawing the
 amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill
 is open to further amendment.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I sug-
 gest the absence of a quorum.

 IIP AMENDMENT NO. 44
 (Purpose: To provide for the maintenance of
 the appropriate number of offices for the
 Taiwan Institute)
 Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I offer an
 amendment to permit the People on
 Taiwan to maintain the present number
 of offices they have in the United States.
 I take this action to promote what I
 see. as one of the goals of the piece of
 legislation before us today. So I call up
 an unprinted amendment and ask for its
 immediate. consideration.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 amendment will be stated.
 The assistant legislative clerk read as
 follows:
 The Senator from Utah (Mr. HATCH) pro-
 poses an unprinted amendment numbered

 On page 13, line 25, insert the following
 new section:
 SEC. 113. (b) The President is authorized
 to extend to the instrumentality established
 by the people on Taiwan-
 Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that further reading
 of the amendment be dispensed with.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 The amendment is as follows:
 On page 13, line 25, insert the following
 new section:
 SEc. 113. (b) The President is- authorized
 to extend to the instrumentality established
 by the people on Taiwan, that in order to
 continue the present range of commercial,
 cultural, economic, and other relations with
 the people of Taiwan, the representatives of
 the people of Taiwan should be allowed to
 maintain the same number of offices and
 complement of personnel as previously op-
 erated in the United States by the govern-
 ment recognized as the Republic of China
 prior to January 1, 1970 upon the condition
 that the American Institute in Taiwan is
 reciprocally allowed such  offices  and per-
 sonnel.
 Mr. HATCH. I offer this amendment to
 permit the people of Taiwan to maintain
 the present number of offices they have
 in the United States. I take this action
 to promote what I see as one of the goals
 of the current piece of legislation before
 us today. The administration has been
 outspoken in its intent that all existing
 agreements with Taiwan, commercial,
 cultural and others, will continue in ef-

 feet except for termination of the de-
 fense treaty. I point out to my colleagues
 that aside from the defense and mutual
 security agreements between the two
 parties, there are accords in the follow-
 ing  fields:  Agricultural  commodities,
 atomic energy, aviation, claims, customs,
 economic and technical cooperation, ed-
 ucation, finance, health and sanitation,
 investment guarantees, a language and
 area study school, maritime matters,
 narcotic drugs, postal matters, relief
 supplies and packages, scientific coop-
 eration, surplus property, taxation, trade
 and commerce, and visas. In order to
 maintain all of these agreements, it
 would become necessary for both the
 United States and the people of Taiwan
 to maintain a large staff in each locality.
 Mr. President, all of the agreements
 which I mentioned previously have led
 to a substantial investment by the U.S.
 business community 4a Taiwan. It is esti-
 mated that the total U.S. financial com-
 mitment in Taiwan is nearly $3 billion,
 including both government and private
 investments and loans. It is an acknowl-
 edged fact that the trade between the
 two nations has reached a significantly
 large amount. For these reasons I feel
 it becomes imperative that the people
 of Taiwan be able to maintain an ade-
 quate number of offices in this country
 to maintain the business and commercial
 as well as cultural and social ties that
 they have with the American community.
 This issue came up in the hearings be-
 fore the Foreign Relations Committee
 and I would like to relay a part of that
 debate to my colleagues here today. Dur-
 ing these hearings, Senator STONE ques-
 tioned Mr. Roger Sullivan of the State
 Department concerning the issue of the
 number of offices and their staffing that
 would be allowed the Republic of China.
 The dialog went as follows:
 Senator STONE. Can I turn briefly, then, to
 Mr. Thomas? Mr. Thomas do you or Mr. Sul-
 livan have any idea as to whether we are
 going to require a reduction in the number
 of staffing of offices that the Republic of
 China now maintains when and if they es-
 tablish other relations with us? Are we tell-
 ing them that they cannot have the same
 offices and the same number of personnel?
 Mr. TnoMAS. May I defer to Mr. Sullivan,
 please?
 Senator STONE. Yes.
 Mr. SULLIVAN. Yes, Senator. We have told
 them that they can keep four offices other
 than the main offices.
 Senator STONE. How many do they have
 now?
 Mr. SULLIVAN. I think they have 14.
 Senator STONE. How can we continue to
 do $7 billion worth of business for which
 they have 14 offices by telling them they can
 have only 4?
 Mr. SULLIVAN. We think 14 offices is exces-
 sive to their needs.
 Senator STONE. But they think that 14
 offices takes care of their needs.
 Mr. SULLIVAN. They have specifically said,
 Senator, that one of the reasons why they
 need many of those offices is to maintain
 their relationship with the Chinese com-
 munities in those cities and we think it
 would be inappropriate to have a Chinese
 civil war imported into our cities.
 Senator STONE. Is that what their offices
 cre doing,- maintaining a Chinese civil war?
 Mr. SULLIVAN. Well, they have told me the
 .purpose of some of their offices Is to main-
 tain contacts with the Chinese community,
 cud we do not think It appropriate to allow
 them to have more offices than they need
 to maintain the practical relationships be-
 tween us.
 Senator STONE. Do you mean they can only
 have those offices which deal with American
 citizens,  not  with  American  citizens  of
 Chinesa origin?
 Mr. SULLIVAN. American citizens. We do not
 make  a    decision  between   Americans  of
 Chinese origin or any other origin.
 Senator STONE. You just did.
 Mr. President, I do not think that 14
 offices is excessive in view of the large
 amount of trade between the two par-
 ties. The business community of the
 United States is widespread, and the
 headquarters of many large corporations
 are in various cities. In order to ex-
 pedite matters of business it makes it
 simple to have offices and representa-
 tives in regionally located offices. Four-
 teen offices would be about the right
 number to achieve this goal.
 The economic aspect of this problem
 is only one part of the issue. The admin-
 istration has also stressed the continued
 culture and social relationship with Tai-
 wan. A large number of the American-
 Chinese communities have ties in Tai-
 wan. They look to the offices of Taiwan
 to nurture the Chinese culture they hold
 so dear. I would dare say they would find
 little assistance from the offices of the
 People's Republic of China, a Communist
 nation. Yet Mr. Sullivan of the State
 Department spoke of a Chinese civil war.
 I find this quite contradictory. We are
 writing safeguards for Taiwan's security
 into this legislation and refusing to allow
 them offices in this country on the
 grounds it will bring a Chinese civil war
 to American cities. What I think the real
 issue is, concerns more economic matters
 than those of a civil war. The People's
 Republic of China would like to eradicate
 all Taiwanese presence in this Nation. To
 them, the 14 offices might be a loss of the
 so-called oriental "face." It matters not
 that there might be a need for these of-
 fices. It matters not that both the Amer-
 ican and Taiwanese business communi-
 ties desire them. All it appears the ad-
 ministration is interested in doing is ap-
 peasing the Red Chinese. I think it is
 time we look at what we need from this
 agreement. Let us save our "American
 face."
 Mr. President, as I understand it, the
 managers of the bill have agreed to take
 this amendment, as modified, and it will
 read as follows:

 for him as well as for myself in indicating
 the amendment is acceptable.

 der of my time and move the adoption

 The amendment was agreed to.
 Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to

 ment was agreed to.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I move to
 lay that motion on the table.
 The motion to lay on the table was
 agreed to.
 Mr. HATCH. I thank the managers of
 the bill for their cooperation.

 Senator from New Hampshire.
 Mr. HUMPHREY. Mr. President, the
 Senate will soon be voting on final pas-
 sage of S. 245 after 6 weeks of con-
 sideration in committee and on the floor.
 It has made some minor improvements
 in a bill which, in its original form,
 largely disavowed the Republic of China
 and left it to its own fate. In committee,
 it is important to note that a security
 section was included, as was a definition
 of the "people on Taiwan" that specifi-
 cally cites the country's government.
 Similarly, a handful of constructive
 amendments were adopted on the floor.
 The Senate voted to create a Joint Com-
 mission on Security and Cooperation in
 East Asia, and to include a reference to
 Taiwan's membership in international
 organizations. It passed language that
 will secure to the ROC a steady supply
 of nuclear fuel from the United States.
 Reporting  requirements  were  added
 under which the President will have to
 report to the Congress on prospective .
 arm sales both to the Republic of China
 and to Peking.
 So the legislation is slightly better.
 But it is still not good. In essence, the
 Senate made slight improvements with-
 in the framework sent to it by the Presi-
 dent, but unfortunately stopped short of
 making any real changes in that frame-
 work itself.
 There are two main aspects to the
 President's basic policy, both of which
 have emerged largely unscathed. One is

 I am very grateful to the managers of
 the bill for being willing to take this
 amendment in this form, and I would like
 to express that appreciation at this time.
 Mr.  CHURCH. Mr. President,  the
 amendment in its modified form is ac-
 ceptable to the managers of the bill. It
 was worked out in collaboration with the
 distinguished Senator from New York,
 the ranking Republican committee mem-
 borating was described by Dr. Ray Cline
 of the Georgetown Institute on Strategic
 and International Studies as a "hasty,
 ill-conceived decision ? ' ? to sell out
 Taiwan lock, stock and barrel, territory
 and people to the Communist regime in
 Peking, the People's Republic of China."
 Clearly, the Congress has no power to
 recognize or derecognize a country. That
 is strictly the prerogative of the Presi-

 dent. Still, options were open to Congress
 which it unfortunately did not choose
 to pursue. It could have passed sense of
 Congress language urging President to
 renew diplomatic relations with the Re-
 public of China. At the very least, it
 could  have  established  that  United
 States-Republic of China relations would
 be conducted on a government-to-gov-
 ernment level.
 The most eloquent reason arguing in
 favor of the exchange of liaison offices is
 simple fairness. At the time that we did
 not recognize Peking, our relations with
 that country were conducted through
 liaison offices. Why not do so now with
 Taiwan? It is, moreover, the height of
 absurdity to suddenly adopt the legal
 position that there is no Republic of
 China; that the government which effec-
 tively controls the 17 million free Chi-
 nese on Taiwan has suddenly vanished
 into thin air.
 I am similarly concerned about the
 absence of adequate language on the
 question of Taiwan's future security.
 We have had at least one opportunity
 to make a committment to the survival
 of Taiwan in the context of a military
 threat. Last week, the distinguished
 Senator from Illinois (Mr. PERCY) intro-
 duced an amendment establishing as our
 policy that the use of force to settle the
 Taiwan issue was a "threat to the secu-
 rity interests of" the United States. In
 my view and that of others this was the
 very least we should have been prepared
 to approve. As the amendment's own
 sponsor asserted, it in no way even
 pledged us to defend Taiwan with our
 own military force. --
 But the administration opposed even
 this slight change in the wording..Dur-
 ing consideration of the amendment we
 heard much rhetoric on this floor about
 the need to have a vote in support of the
 President, given the crucial negotiations
 he was engaged in in the Middle East. It is
 amusing that, as the distinguished Sen-
 ator from North Carolina (Mr. HELMS)
 noted on the floor, that very morning a
 constituent had observed to him that
 this would be the very argument used to
 sway votes. In the end, the amendment
 of the distinguished Senator from Illi-
 nois was defeated.
 Nor has Taiwan, in my opinion, been
 properly protected against the threat of
 embargoes by the PRC. This, Mr. Presi-
 dent, is a very real threat. According to
 'Robert B. Parker, president of the Amer-
 ican Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan,
 it is already happening. The PRC, for
 example, refuses to honor American Ex-
 'press  travelers  checks  because  that
 company operates in Taiwan. At the
 same time, Pan American World Airways
 suddenly dropped its scheduled service to
 Taipei-and a few weeks later made a
 major hotel deal with Peking. According
 to Mr. Parker, Ambassador Leonard
 Woodcock has "inadvertently confirmed
 the existence of such a boycott when he
 said that Pan American is now the
 favored U.S. carrier in China and that
 no U.S. airlines will be granted landing
 rights on the mainland as long as it
 serves Taiwan."
 So the problem -exists. It has serious
 implications-and, although it is against
 the Export Administration Act for Amer-
 ican companies to be parties to such boy-
 cotts, there has not been a single inves-
 tigation of the matter that I am aware
 of by the U.S. Government. It is a posi-
 tive contribution that, in the course of
 the colloquy on this floor, the Senate
 made legislative history that such eco-
 nomic boycotts be interpreted by the
 United States as a threat to the survival
 of Taiwan. Nevertheless, I regret that it
 was impossible to include language ex-
 plicitly expressing that feeling, such as
 has been done by the other Chamber.
 In summary, Mr. President, we have
 made some improvements in what has
 been described as the "unprecedented,
 indeed bizarre"-and certainly inade-
 quate-proposal submitted to us by the
 President. We cannot measure our suc-
 cess, however, on the basis of relative
 improvement. The only significant yard-
 stick is whether or not we have provided
 security for Taiwan's future territorial
 integrity. Sadly, in my opinion, we have
 not.
 Mr. President, the decision, in effect,
 to disavow Taiwan will have serious re-
 percussions throughout the world. At the
 very least, it will strengthen the already
 substantial. concerns of many of our
 allies, encouraging them to give still more
 serious thought to political realinement.
 It is safe to say that, at this moment,
 leaders of many small countries which
 have heretofore been U.S. allies are ask-
 ing themselves, "Will we be next?" We
 already know that the President's deci-
 sion sent a tremor through Israel, mak-
 ing many of its leaders relutant to trust
 any U.S. guarantee of protection. Our
 new Taiwan policy has seriously affected
 the integrity of our international alliance
 system and our credibility worldwide as
 an ally.
 The President's decision and its execu-
 tion are as inept an exercise in foreign
 policy as we have witnessed for a long
 time. In the first place, all but the
 staunchest supporters of President Car-
 ter agree that he did little more than
 cave in to Chinese demands without
 making any real attempt to negotiate
 conditions favorable to Taiwan. It has
 been pointed out repeatedly that the
 terms which he accepted-and which he
 has been seeking to portray to us as con-
 stituting a diplomatic coup-are exactly
 the same as could have been accepted by
 Presidents Nixon or Ford some years ago,
 but which both rejected as being tanta-
 mount to a sellout. The White House af-
 firms that we were involved in intense
 negotiations-but who, in fact, made all
 the concessions? The answer is obvious:
 We did. I challenge anyone to point out
 to me a single substantive concession we
 received from Peking. In every case, the
 side to cave in was the United States; and
 the victim in every instance will be Tai-
 wan.             ? -
 The White. House aggravated its diplo-
 matic mistake by the cavalier manner it
 adopted toward Taiwan immediately
 after the decision was reached. Both the
 President of the Republic of China and
 its ambassador to this country were given
 notice of only several hours of the De-
 cember 15 announcement which has so
 radically altered the position of their
 country. During subsequent negotiations,'
 it put increasing pressure on the ROC
 Government to accept all its terms, in-
 cluding the concept of strictly unofficial
 relations. Taiwan reluctantly accepted
 this arrangement,, incidentally, only days
 before the old relations were to lapse al-
 together, and it is safe to assume that the
 fear of having no relations at all played a
 major role in its final acquiescence.
 Finally, in what can only be described as
 a  petty  gesture,  the  administration
 sought, through a legal maneuver, to
 hand the diplomatic real property of the
 Republic of China to the PRC.
 Mr. President, I have been to Taiwan,
 and I have been impressed and inspired
 by the dedication and achievements of its
 people. As Dr. Ray Cline has stated,
 Taiwan is an island of hope, prosperity, and
 human liberty in an Asian sea of poverty and
 turbulence. There the best of American and
 Asian  political philosophies  and economic
 technologies have been blended to show how
 to modernize Chinese society without giving
 up freedom. The "modernization" of-main-
 land China is a hope, a dream, quite possibly
 an impossible dream. In Taiwan it is a present
 reality.
 I share Dr. Cline's grief that the United
 States has adopted a policy of premedi-
 tated murder of this gentle and prosper-
 ous land to use his words.
 Mr. President, Senate consideration of
 the future of Taiwan will soon be his-
 tory. Our new relationship with Taiwan
 will  be inadequate  regarding  many
 fundamentals. The President made what
 has been described as a "morally shabby"
 deal with Peking, and, in many ways,
 our vote will serve to ratify that agree-
 ment. I can only hope that all of us will
 work diligently to protect Taiwan from
 the harrassment, large and small, it will
 inevitably suffer from the PRC in years
 to come, and that our actions in the face
 of real threat to the survival of the ROC
 will be in keeping with the spirit of
 commitment to its future which has been
 expressed so often on this floor.
 Mr. President, the President of the
 United States and the Senate are about
 to present the ROC an empty box. It is
 a box which is gaily wrapped, a box
 festooned with ribbons of vague phrase-
 ology. But it is an empty box, Mr. Presi-
 dent, because it is empty of sovereignty.
 The Senate, apparently is about to en-
 dorse President Carter's giveaway of Tai-
 wan to the Communists. Implict in the
 passage of this bill is the tacit acknowl-
 edgement of the Communists' contention
 that they own Taiwan.
 Mr. President, I do not wonder that
 the world has fallen into chaos-that
 communism is everywhere on the ad-
 vance. American leadership has lost its
 nerve-not her people, but her leader-
 ship.
 Mr. President, I passed the statue of
 President Harry Truman as I entered
 the Chamber a few minutes ago. There
 was a man who called a spade a spade.
 There was a man who would have called
 President Carter's proposals just what
 they are: a shameless, cowardly sellout
 of a valuable ally.

 UP AMENDMENT NO. 45
 Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I'have
 an amendment which I send to the desk
 and ask for its immediate consideration.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 amendment will be stated.
 The legislative clerk read as follows:
 The Senator from Idaho (Mr. MCCLURE)
 proposes an unprinted amendment numbered
 45, as follows:
 On page 9, line 10, following the word Tai-
 wan, insert the following: "by the people on
 Taiwan."
 On page 12, line 3, following the word
 Taiwan, insert the following; "by the people
 on Taiwan."
 Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, this
 amendment merely states more explicitly
 what I believe is the obvious intention
 of this section of the bill. By making the
 bill clear, we shall prevent trouble that
 possibly could occur if the State Depart-
 ment claimed that the term "the law ap-
 plied to Taiwan" means the law of the
 Communist regime on the mainland.
 Since the Carter administration wants
 the Chinese Communists to be viewed as
 the sole legal government of all China,
 including Taiwan-at least that is the
 legal framework for the agreement-it
 is important that the law which we pass
 be precise in saying that the law on Tai-
 wan is the law which is recognized by the
 people on Taiwan. I think that that pre-
 serves and follows the format of the bill
 as presented to us.
 I understand that the managers of the
 bill have the opportunity to look at this
 amendment and, while they do not neces-
 sarily embrace it with, enthusiasm, they
 do not think it does violence to the bill.
 I hope that, if that is true, they can
 accept the amendment.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, first of
 all, I think the record should be clear
 regarding the position of the United
 States. It is true that we have agreed in
 the Shanghai Communique entered into
 by President Nixon some years ago, and
 again at the time that President Carter
 normalized relations with the People's
 Republic of China, that the Peking gov-
 ernment, as well as the Taipei govern-
 ment, both agreed that there is but one
 China, and Taiwan is part of that China.
 The position of the Government of the
 United States is to acknowledge that the
 Chinese take this view. But the U.S. Gov-
 ernment itself has not adopted this view,
 or any particular view regarding that
 matter.
 As for the amendment offered by my
 able colleague from Idaho, I think that
 it bears out what the committee intended
 in the report on page 27 in the section-
 CONGREESSIONAL RECORD --SENATE         March 13, 1979
 by-section analysis of the bill; namely,    The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 section 110.                                        METZENBAUM). The Senator from Idaho.
 The committee says:                       UP AMENDMENT NO. 45 (As MODIFIED)
 This section provides that when the ap-
 plication of United States law depends upon
 foreign law, the law actually applied by the
 people on Taiwan shall be looked to for that
 purpose. The provision does not affect the
 enforceability of judgments rendered by the
 courts on Taiwan.
 So it is clear that the law to which
 the language of the statute itself refers
 on line 3, page 12, of the printed text is
 meant to be the law actually applied on
 Taiwan.
 I think that the amendment suggested
 by the Senator would eliminate any pos-
 sible doubt on that score, and bring the
 text of the bill into full. conformity with
 the intention of the committee and the
 explanations contained in the committee
 report.
 For that reason, I have no objection
 to the amendment. I would like to hear
 from Senator JAVITS, the ranking Re-
 publican member, before we proceed to
 a vote.
 Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, while
 we are awaiting the expression of the
 minority floor manager of the bill, I
 might just remark in passing that I ap-
 preciate the comment that has been
 made. I appreciate also the chairman's
 pointing out that the report does, in
 effect, say precisely the same thing that
 this amendment says.
 Oftentimes, there is a gap between the
 enforcement of a statute when, after the
 passage of some time, people forget what
 was in the report and read only what is
 in the statute. It would seem to me, to
 preclude that possibility as far as it is
 humanly possible, the statute should
 conform to the intention that is ex-
 pressed in the report. I do not think this
 does vary from that intention.
 I appreciate what my colleague from
 Idaho has said. I hope that the Senator
 from New York will come to the same
 conclusion and that perhaps this amend-
 ment will then be accepted.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, while
 the Senator from New York is studying
 the matter, I would suggest to the Sena-
 tor from Idaho that the best way to
 settle this is for him to trade this amend-
 ment for the other amendment, in which
 case we have everything settled.
 Mr. DAVITS, Mr. President, I suggest
 the absence of a quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. On whose
 time?
 Mr. JAVITS. On the time of the bill.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the
 time of the bill.
 The clerk will call the roll.
 The second assistant legislative clerk
 proceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the order for
 the quorum call be rescinded.
 Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the wording of
 the amendment be changed to read "by
 the people on Taiwan." So that the
 wording on line 3 of page 12 with the
 change would be "The law applied by
 the people on Taiwan."
 I would ask that a similar change be
 made in the second place that is referred
 to in my amendment, and .that the
 amendment be modified accordingly.
 Mr. JAVITS. That is the second page?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ator has a right to modify his amend-
 ment. Would the Senator be good enough
 to send his amendment to the desk?
 Mr. McCLURE. Yes.
 Mr. President, the amendment would
 then read as follows, and I will send it
 to the desk, that on page 9, line 10, fol-
 lowing the word "applied" insert the
 following, "by the people."
 On page 12, line 3, following the word
 "applied" insert the following: "by the
 people."
 It has the same effect and is consistent
 with the words of art that are used
 throughout the bill and in the report.
 Mr. JAVITS. Would the 'clerk state
 the amendment as modified?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 amendment will be stated.
 The second assistant legislative clerk
 read as follows:
 On page 9, line 10, following the word
 "applied" insert the following: "by the peo-
 ple".
 On page 12, line 3, following the word "ap-
 plied" insert the following; "by the people".
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, the amend-
 ment is acceptable to me.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, as I al-
 ready have indicated, the amendment is
 acceptable to me. If the Senator from
 Idaho will yield back the remainder of
 his time, we will yield back ours.
 Mr. McCLURE. I yield back the re-
 mainder of my time on this amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
 tion is on agreeing to the amendment, as
 modified.
 The amendment, as modified,  was
 agreed to.
 Mr. McCLURE. Mr.. President, I have
 a second amendment, which I send to the
 desk, and ?I ask for its immediate con-
 sideration.
 The  PRESIDING'  OFFICER.  The
 amendment will be stated.
 The legislative clerk read as follows:
 The Senator from Idaho  (Mr. MCCLURE)

 have said so, in a variety of ways, in the
 bill and in the report. We have said that
 is what our concern is.
 Economic strangulation could be at-
 tempted through political blackmail,
 boycotts, attempts to interfere with in-
 ternational trade of Taiwan or claim
 its foreign assets. These efforts will not
 succeed if major trading partners such as
 the United States and Japan refuse to
 go along. However, complicity on our
 part would put our longtime friend, the
 Republic of China, in the untenable posi-
 tion of having to submit to the Commu-
 nists' demands or face economic collapse.
 Therefore, I believe it is necessary for
 us to state clearly at the outset of our
 formal relations with Red China, that
 any such act, whether unilateral or
 through international organizations, will
 be opposed- by the United States. By add-
 ing the word "voluntary" to this sec-
 tion, we put on notice the Communist
 rulers of the mainland and our friends
 in the State Department that any at-
 tempt to place the people of Taiwan
 under a Communist subjugation by mili-
 tary conquest or economic. strangula-
 tion is of grave concern to the United
 States.
 Mr. President, it is my understanding
 that there is some concern about this
 language. I hope that concern is ex-
 pressed not in terms of the objective of
 this language, but I am perfectly willing
 to discuss with the managers of the bill
 the effects or the proposed effects of the
 terms that say that this should be volun-
 tary.
 It seems to me that that is really our
 intention as we go through the entire
 discussion of this bill over the last 2 or 3
 days in the Senate. It will be my hope
 that it is not our intention, conversely,
 to say that the reunification or the join-
 der together of these two parts of China,
 as properly has been stated-both the
 government ? in Taipei and the govern-
 ment in Peking have indicated that is
 their view-will not be accomplished by.
 means that are other than voluntary,
 according to the procedures in effect
 under the rubric used in this bill of "the
 people on Taiwan."
 The question of whether or not the
 people on Taiwan may agree or disagree
 certainly should not detract from the
 basic premise upon which we proceed,
 that the people on Taiwan have an
 existence that is somewhat different
 from that of just another province of
 China. We certainly are not setting up a
 parallel procedure for dealing with other
 provinces  of  the  People's  Republic.
 Therefore, we do have a special relation-
 ship with the people on Taiwan; and
 without calling them a government, we
 have carefully called them, throughout,
 the people on Taiwan.
 I am not trying to indicate by this
 that we establish that voluntarism by
 any means other than that which is ac-
 ceptable and usual to the forms and the
 laws in effect, under the rest of the the-
 ory of the bill, with respect to the people
 on Taiwan.
 Mr. President, I reserve the remainder
 of my time.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, the ob-
 jection we have to this amendment is
 that it again interjects us into a Chinese
 question.
 The interest of the United States has
 nothing to do with whether the main-
 land and Taiwan are reunified as long
 as the Chinese decide that question
 -peacefully. We have an interest in the
 peaceful resolution of that question. We
 recognize that it is a Chinese question,
 not an American question. Our only in-
 terest is that, when and if it is possible
 for the Chinese themselves to settle the
 question, it be settled peacefully.
 That is what was said in the Shanghai
 Communique entered into by President
 Nixon in his much-praised opening to
 China. The same interest was reiterated
 by President Carter when he decided to
 consummate what Nixon began, with the
 recent normalization of relations be-
 tween the United States and the govern-
 ment in Peking. The same terminology
 is used in the pending bill.
 If this amendment were adapted, we
 would be interjecting for the first time
 a new word. I suggest that it is difficult,
 if not impossible, to know what that
 word means in the context of this par-
 ticular question.
 For example, the bill defines the
 people on Taiwan as, first, the govern-
 ing authority on Taiwan, which was
 recognized by the United States prior to
 January 1, 1979 as the Republic of China,
 and also as its agencies, instrumentali-
 ties,  and  political  subdivisions,  and
 finally as the people governed by it in
 the islands of Taiwan and the Pesca-
 dores. So in the definition of "the people
 on Taiwan," we include both the govern-
 ing authorities and the people. If we
 interject the word "voluntary" as the
 Senator from Idaho proposes, many
 questions would immediately arise.  ?
 Now does the United States determine
 whether or not some future agreement
 between the Chinese has been voluntary?
 What, indeed, does "voluntary" mean
 when we are dealing with two authori-
 tarian governments, neither of which
 rests upon the consent of the governed
 in the sense that our Government does?
 Does "voluntary" refer to some future
 pact between the Taiwan authorities and
 their counterparts in Peking? Is it ade-
 quate if the authorities at the top volun-
 tarily agree? Or is it necessary, before
 this standard is satisfied, that some kind
 of referendum be held and that the
 people give their consent in national
 elections? If one would go that far, then
 how could we ascertain whether those
 elections were in fact free?
 It is obvious. that this amendment is
 fraught with problems. I suggest that it
 would be unwise to adopt it, particularly
 in view of the assurance we give the peo-
 ple on Taiwan contained in subsection 1
 of part (b) of section 114 of the bill,
 which reads:
 The United States will maintain its capa-
 city to resist any resort to force or other
 forms of coercion that would jeopardize the
 security or the social or economic system
 of the people on Taiwan.
 What more can we do than that?
 The committee has gone very far to.
 give all the necessary assurances to the
 people on Taiwan, mindful as we have
 been all along of the alliance that has
 S 2589
 existed between those people and our-
 selves. This amendment would not clar-
 ify our intention; it would cloud our in-
 tentions with ambiguity.
 Therefore, it is the feeling of the com-
 mittee, insofar as r can speak for the
 committee as manager of this bill, that
 the amendment offered by the Senator
 from Idaho-though I am sure it is well
 intended-should not be approved.
 Mr. JAVITS. I yield myself 5 minutes.
 Mr. President, this amendment raises
 very much the same issue which we found ?
 so troublesome with the amendment of
 Senator HELMS, in the sense that it seeks
 to take us out of the area of unilateral
 declaration as to what we will do in given
 circumstances and makes us dictate or
 prescribe what the people on Taiwan will
 do.
 And, the difference is the difference
 between a state of facts and a state of
 mind. A state of facts, which we can
 find out ourselves and objectively ascer-
 tain, is we believe there has been coer-
 cion or we believe there has been force
 or blockade or boycott. That is a state
 of facts which is perceptible by factual
 proof. On the other hand, the word "vol-
 untary" is a state of mind of the people
 on Taiwan. God knows what secret,
 clandestine, Byzantine propositions may
 have influenced them so that it is in-
 voluntary and how much argument, al-
 most theological, there can be as to
 whether it is voluntary or involuntary.
 As Senator CHURCH, and I associate
 myself with everything he said, has prop-
 erly outlined, what indicia are we go-
 ing to have of voluntarism, a vote, a con-
 stitution, a plebiscite, a Harris poll? It
 simply puts us, in my judgment, in the
 untenable situation of trying to pene-
 trate the mind of the Taiwanese, in-
 stead of allowing us to make our deci-
 sions based upon factual evidence, and
 those factual evidences are now fully in-
 corporated in the bill. Therefore, in my
 judgment to add this additional qualifi-
 cation relating to the state of mind of
 17 million people would make it impossi-
 ble and would be causb for all kinds of
 controversy, mischief, claims, and coun-
 terclaims.
 Hence, I really do not see how we can
 find our way out of this except by the
 Senate voting it up or down. I hope very
 much the Senate-having labored now
 through the process, and we have taken
 many amendments which have fortified,
 locked in, insured everything that we
 can do unilaterally to preserve the
 economic and social system on Taiwan-
 will not now undo everything it has done
 by adding this new test which depends
 upon the state of mind of the people on
 Taiwan and, therefore, would completely
 change and make impossible the admin-
 istration of the concept upon which this
 bill is based.
 Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I am
 not sure whether I thank my friends
 from Idaho and New 'York for their
 commentaries  on  the  amendment,
 because I am not sure whether I under-
 stand what it is they have been trying
 to say, and that perhaps is my lack of
 understanding or perhaps the artfulness
 of their argument.
 As I understand what they have tried

 to say it is that everyone understands
 the words "force" and "coercion," but
 they do not understand the term "volun-
 tary," and I can proceed to a diction-
 ary ' and look up the term "force". I
 could raise some issues about what is
 force and what is not force and say
 there is all kinds of ambiguity in that
 term, but that is not so ambiguous that
 we cannot use it. I could get the defini-
 tion of the term "coercion," and supply
 it for the Senate, and I could raise some
 questions about whether or not that term
 is precise or ambiguous, and apparently
 it is precise enough for some and too
 ambiguous for others.
 And similarly the term "voluntary,"
 and I understand what my friend from
 New York has said with respect to a
 state of mind, but certainly the actions
 that are taken tell what the state of
 mind of the legal authorities is. We do
 recognize legal authorities on Taiwan.
 We do that throughout. If they took
 actions pursuant to their laws that were
 set in conformance with their laws, to
 say that this reunification was what they
 desired to do, in accordance with their
 laws, not ours, their understanding, not
 ours, their state of mind, not ours, their
 judgment of their state of mind, not
 ours, it would satisfy the requirements
 of this amendment.
 But I guess beyond that what concerns
 me is the unspoken, the other side of
 this issue. What happens if as a matter
 of fact the People's Republic of China
 attempts to enforce some action against
 the people on Taiwan and attempts to
 exert pressure to force them to give up
 their demand for independence? Would
 we then say that that was coercion?
 Is my friend from New York prepared
 to say that the U.S. representatives to
 multinational organizations will resist
 the efforts made by the People's Repub-
 lic of China to force the people on
 Taiwan to give up their claim of
 independence?
 My understanding from the earlier
 debate is that no, we would not, that
 apparently the term "force or coer-
 cion" is ambiguous enough to permit
 them to use that kind of force and coer-
 cion. I might ask my friend from New
 York if that is correct.
 Mr. JAVITS. Give me a minute and
 I will comment on it.
 Mr. McCLURE. All right.
 Perhaps my friend from Idaho would
 like to  answer  the question as to
 whether or not the U.S. representatives
 in international organizations will be
 instructed by this statute to resist the
 attempts to use membership in or ac-
 tivities of multinational organizations
 to protect the people on Taiwan against
 the attempts by the People's Republic
 of China to exert pressures on them to-
 ward their relinquishment of their in-
 dependence.
 Mr. CHURCH. I am sorry but I think
 I only heard part of the question and,
 therefore, I am not in position to re-
 spond.
 Mr. McCLURE. I will try to rephrase
 the question, because it has been argued
 that the term "voluntary" is ambiguous
 but that the terms "force" and "coer-
 cion" are well understood and unam-
 D - SIENATIE          March 13, 1979
 biguous. If, indeed, the terms "force"
 and "coercion" are so unambiguous that
 they do not need any further definition
 by the term "voluntary," then I would
 like to ask whether or not it is the under-
 standing of the managers of the bill that
 the U.S. representatives being directed
 by the congressional expression in this
 statute, this bill before us today, S. 245,
 as a mended, will resist the attempts if
 made by the People's Republic of China
 to exert pressures upon the people bn
 Taiwan through multinational organiza-
 tions, their memberships in those organi-
 zations, or their rights to be represented
 there.
 Mr. CHURCH. As the Senator knows,
 the instructions given to our repre-
 senatives in multilateral  institutions
 are given by the executive branch of the
 Government. Therefore, I am not in a
 position to respond to the Senator's
 question.
 However, I would draw his attention
 to the fact that on page 14, beginning
 on line 14, the phrase in question is:
 Tho United States will maintain its ca-
 pacity to resist any resort to force or other
 forms of coercion that would jeopardize
 the security, or the social or economic sys-
 tem, of the people on Taiwan.
 In other words, the term "coercion" as
 as used in the bill does not exist in a
 vacuum. It is related to the other words
 in the phrase, and those other words are
 directed toward the security of the peo-
 ple on Taiwan and toward their social or
 economic system.
 The forms of coercion referred to are
 forms of coercion that would jeopardize
 their security, or the social or economic
 system that exists on the island.
 Mr. McCLURE. Might I say to my
 friend, first of all, that indicates the term
 "coercion" Is ambiguous and requires
 some understanding, and that it also
 would require a judgment on our part as
 to whether or not it would jeopardize the
 security or, the social or the economic
 system of the people on Taiwan. That is
 a matter of judgment equally as grave
 and equally as difficult as the judgment
 of whether or not the action take is vol-
 untary.
 But let me point out beyond that that
 the section to which he refers is subsec-
 tion (b), a subsection under that, in order
 to achieve the objectives of this section.
 The section that I seek to amend is on
 the same page, line 6, in that expecta-
 tion upon which this whole thing is pre-
 mised. It has nothing to do with whether,
 a test of whether or not, we will recog-
 nize the action. As the Senator from New
 York has suggested, it has only to do with
 what is our expectation at this time of
 the matter by which the dissolution of
 the independence of the people on Tai-
 wan might be effected in the future.
 It seems to me that since that is our
 expectation we ought to be able to say
 that we think that whatever the process
 may be it will seek the voluntary action
 of the people on Taiwan, however, that
 may be expressed, pursuant to their own
 forms and their own laws.
 If that is not our expectation-and
 certainly that must be read into the re-
 jection of it-then we are saying, in
 effect, that there are some circumstances
 under which we would expect perhaps
 that the People's Republic of China  ...-
 would force the people on Taiwan to ac-
 cept a change by means other than vol-
 untary. That is one of the things that a
 number of us have been very concerned
 about and, as I had understood my col-
 league from Idaho to be concerned about,
 whether or not this could be a peaceful
 and voluntary evolution or whether or
 not it would be effected by other means.
 Mr. President, I reserve the remainder
 of my time.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I made
 the argument against this amendment. I
 think the argument still stands. It is
 much easier to legislate against such ac-
 tions as maybe coercive or forceful than
 it is to either define or enforce affirma-
 tive standards.
 I have tried to explain the difficulties
 involved in knowing what is meant by
 "voluntary," given the circumstances of
 the case, and there is no need for me to
 reiterate those arguments at this time.
 My colleague from Idaho has asked
 what American policy might be relative
 to membership by the Taiwanese in cer-
 tain international organizations.
 Earlier in the debate, either yester-
 day or late last week, an amendment by
 Senator HOLLINGS from South Carolina
 was approved making clear that nothing
 in this bill affects in any way American
 policy relating to Taiwan representation
 or Taiwanese representation in interna-
 tional organizations. The bill does affect
 this one way or another.
 I think I came to a period, I am not
 quite certain, but I believe it was a com-
 plete sentence. [Laughter.]
 Mr. McCLURE. If it is not I am sure
 the Record will be corrected to reflect it.
 Mr. CHURCH. In any case, Mr. Presi-
 dent, we are about out of time and I
 think we have made the argument
 against the amendment.
 I believe it will be unwise of the Sen-
 ate to adopt this amendment. It would
 add confusion and not clarification, and
 it would be at variance with 'the stated
 policy of this country under two admin-
 istrations, one Republican, the other
 Democratic.
 So, for these reasons I hope the Senate
 will reject the amendment.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I yield
 myself 3 minutes merely to point out
 that I state, as the draftsman, that the
 legislative intention, as I understand it,
 is that the words "by peaceful means
 on page 14, line 6, exclude the facts or
 the situation referred to on page 14,
 lines 15 to 17, inclusive, to wit, "any
 resort to force or other forms of coercion'
 that would jeopardize the security, or
 the social or economic system, of the
 people on Taiwan." There will be no
 argument or question as to our con-
 struction of the words "will be by peace-
 ful means," and the reason I say that
 is because I think this is, with all re-
 spect, a very bad amendment, because
 it depends on the state of mind of the
 people on Taiwan. We cannot go into
 that.
 We can, and it is an absolutely normal
 and commonsense experience, make an
 assessment as to the use of force or

 other forms of coercion that would
 jeopardize the security or the social or
 economic system of the people on Taiwan.
 Those are acts not states of mind. So I
 oppose the amendment.
 Mr. McCLURE. Mr. President, I do
 not want to get this dialog locked into
 the framework of pride of authorship,
 pride of authorship on behalf of the
 committee that thinks they have con-
 sidered every eventuality and take pride
 in their work product, or the pride of
 authorship of the Senator who offered
 this amendment who believes this is a
 constructive addition to the meaning
 by offering the word "voluntary," and I
 think that is where we have got our-
 selves locked in now.
 The Senator from New York says he
 thinks it is a bad amendment, because
 he thinks it would be difficult to deter-
 mine whether or not the actions are
 voluntary but,' at the same time, we can
 assess the factor that there has been
 force or coercion.
 To me, if you can assess the facts to
 determine whether it was voluntary you
 can assess the fact of whether there has
 been force or coercion. I do not want to
 get locked into that impasse of difference
 of approach to an identical problem, to
 an identical objective.
 If I read correctly or hear correctly
 what the Senator from New York said
 in terms of what the word "peaceful"
 means, what it is to actually expect, and
 whether we use the term "peaceful" or
 whether we use the term "voluntary"
 our expectation is that whatever may be
 be done to resolve the issue of Taiwan-
 and that is the context of the language
 in this section-will be done as the result
 of the will of the peoples involved and
 not by force or coercion brought upon
 the people of Taiwan by any other
 force.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. McCLURE. I am happy to yield to
 Senator from New York.
 Mr. JAVITS. I cannot accept that. The
 words stated mean to me the will of the.
 people on Taiwan. That is the toughest
 thing in the world to define. But let me
 state what I am saying. Any resolution
 of the Taiwan issue will be by peaceful
 means, and that includes any resort to
 force or other forms of coercion that
 would jeopardize the security or the so-
 cial or economic system of Taiwan. That
 is out.
 In other words, we incorporate that
 .concept as the negative of the words
 previously mentioned.
 Mr. McCLURE. I see.
 Mr. JAVITS. If we stay with that, I am
 all with you, and that is the legislative
 intent.
 Mr. McCLURE. I understand what the
 Senator is saying. He has repeated again
 the language of subsection (2).
 Mr. JAVITS. Right.
 Mr. McCLURE. And again the lan-
 guage of subsection (b) (1).
 Mr. JAVITS. Right.
 Mr. McCLURE. But he has done so in
 the context of a discussion of whether
 or not it is voluntary. If we can set aside
 for a moment-I used the term "the will
 of the people of Taiwan." I certainly
 would not want the record to indicate
 the Senator from New York is suggesting
 that this action be taken against the will
 of the people of Taiwan.
 Mr. JAVITS. Of course not. And I did
 not say that.
 Mr. McCLURE. All right. Second, I
 would like to point out that that same
 curious lack of a positive is apparent in
 the amendment to which my colleague
 from Idaho referred earlier, of Senator
 HOLLINGS. I read:
 Nothing in this Act may be construed as
 a basis for supporting the exclusion or expul-
 sion of the people on Taiwan from continued
 membership in any international financial
 institution or any other international orga-
 nization.
 But it does not say that we will resist
 that exclusion.
 I would think that in the context of
 this discussion, and again not to com-
 plicate the discussion, we are again say-
 ing that our expectation is that the reso-
 lution of the issue on Taiwan will be done
 without force or coercion, and I will not
 use the term "voluntary," I will not use
 the term "according to the will of the
 people on Taiwan," but express it in the
 opposite way, that says our expectation
 is that coercion and force will not be
 used. If that is our understanding of
 the terms that are meant, in the context
 of my having offered the word "volun-
 tary," and that having caused some diffi-
 culty, I would be prepared to withdraw
 the amendment.
 Mr. JAVITS. There is only one quali-
 fication, and that is coercion of the size,
 character, and quality that would jeop-
 ardize the security or the social or eco-
 nomic system of the people on Taiwan.
 Mr. McCLURE. I understand what the
 Senator is saying, but again recognize
 that that requires a judgment, a judg-
 ment difficult to make, and perhaps just
 as subjective as what is in the state of
 mind of the people on Taiwan.
 Mr. JAVITS. That is our criterion.
 Sure, it calls for a judgment, but at
 least a judgment based on acts. That is
 all I say, and that is what we are saying.
 Mr. McCLURE. Again I would say to
 my friend from New York whether or not
 it is voluntary, you say, is in the minds
 of the people on Taiwan. That could be
 a judgment we make, based upon our
 evaluation of the way in which it has
 been expressed. The Senator rejects that.
 I have just as great difficulty with ac-
 cepting the question of whether or not
 coercion is sufficient to threaten
 Mr. JAVITS. To Jeopardize.
 Mr. McCLURE. To jeopardize the
 security or the social or economic system
 of the people on Taiwan. That is still to
 be judged on the basis of the future
 facts. I hope that the record is clear that
 the United States is in a position not
 only to reject the attempts to coerce, but
 to resist the attempts to coerce. We have
 entered into a mutual defense treaty
 with a government that does not exist
 any more. We have given notice of the
 abrogation of that treaty, although I
 suppose under that treaty we are still
 bound to defend a government that does
 not exist for the year in which the treaty
 52591
 does exist, as I understand the legal fig-
 ments under which we are operating
 here.
 But, again, with the assurances of my
 colleague from Idaho and my friend
 from New York, I will withdraw the
 amendment.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I thank
 my  colleague  for  withdrawing  the
 'amendment  and  engaging    in  the
 colloquy.
 Mr. JAVITS. I thank the Senator also.
 The      PRESIDING     OFFICER.  The
 amendment is withdrawn.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. Mr. President, will
 the Senator from Idaho yield me a min-
 ute or two, so that I may explain my
 position on this measure?
 Mr. CHURCH. Surely; I am happy to
 yield to the Senator from Arizona.
 Mr. GOLDWATER. Mr. President, at
 the outset of these several days of debate
 on this matter, I said I would support
 the legislation. I rise to say, Mr. Presi-
 dent, that I have changed my mind. I
 cannot support this, as much as I would
 like to support it.
 We had several chances during the
 course of the debate to have cleared some
 things up that need clearing up badly,
 chief of which is the position .of the Sen-
 ate in future treaty negotiations, should
 they be created, on abrogating.
 Because of the failure of several
 amendments to pass which I think would
 have added some muscle and strength
 and meaning to this measure, Mr. Presi-
 dent, I very reluctantly have to say that
 I will vote against it.
 That does not take away for one mo-
 ment from my appreciation for the very
 hard work done by the managers of the
 bill. They have come up with something
 that was better than nothing; but it is
 not good enough.
 I thank the Senator for yielding.
 Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I
 rise in support of S. 245, the Taiwan
 Enabling Act. My support; however, is
 not without reservations. The issues in-
 volved are complex and the implications
 of this legislation are enormous. In the
 final analysis, however, I concur in the
 opinion of the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee that this "bill as amended
 and approved will, if implemented prop-
 erly, enable the United States to con-
 tinue to have a close and friendly rela-
 tionship with the people on Taiwan while
 simultaneously developing a mutually
 beneficial relationship with the People's
 Republic of China."
 Mr. President, let me make clear at
 the outset that I emphatically do not
 condone President Carter's withdrawal
 of diplomatic recognition from a long-
 time ally and friend, the Republic of
 China (Taiwan). As pointed out in the
 additional views of Senator HELMS of
 North Carolina to the report of the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
 the Taiwan Enabling Act-
 This precipitant action not only was un-
 necessary, it came at the worse possible
 time. As the world looked to the United
 States for a demonstration of resolve and
 fidelity after a period of growing setbacks
 for American interests, the world saw in-
 stead vacillation, weakness and betrayal of
 friendship  in  the  derecognition  of  the

 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050008-4
 S2592
 Republic of China. It is not up to the Con-
 gress to change that action. The President
 may choose the Nations he wishes to rec-
 ognize, and which he does not. The issue
 of derecognition may well be a matter to be
 dealt with in the 1980 Presidential Elections.
 That is a more proper form of settlement of
 that issue.
 . The essence of this legislation, S. 245,
 is to preserve existing commercial, cul-
 tural and other unofficial relations by
 authorizing the continuation of existing
 agreements,  statutory  programs  and
 other relevant sections of U.S. laws.
 This legislation creates an American
 Institute in Taiwan, a private nonprofit
 corporation which is the entity through
 which  future  relations between  the
 United States and the people on Taiwan
 are to be primarily conducted. The ac-
 tivities of the Institute will be governed
 and controlled by a contract executed
 between the Institute and the Depart-
 ment of State. Although I would prefer
 that relations be handled through offi-
 cial channels; namely, liaison officers. I
 think the Institute is workable and
 therefore not a serious impediment to
 enactment of this legislation.
 Mr. President, I feel that it is signifi-
 cant that this legislation provides for
 the continued security of Taiwan, both
 in an economic sense, and a military
 sense. Among other things, this legisla-
 tion provides that all treaties and other
 international agreements in existence
 between the United States and the Re-
 public of China (Taiwan) will remain
 in force. Thus, we may be assured that
 the strong cultural and financial ties be-
 tween the People on Taiwan and the
 United States will continue.
 Mr. President, the continued security
 of Taiwan is of grave concern, to me.
 I am disappointed that the negotiations
 did not obtain firm assurances by the
 People's Republic of China that they
 would not try to reunite Taiwan with
 mainland China by use of force. Chinese
 leaders have recently made statements
 on a number of occasions indicating a
 desire for peaceful reunification, such as
 the statement made by Vice Premier
 Teng Hsiao-P'ing to the Senate Foreign
 Relations Committee during his recent
 visit to Washington that "so long as
 Taiwan is returned to the mother land,
 and there is only one China, we will
 fully respect the realities on Tiawan."
 Other reports, however, are not so re-
 assuring. The National Chinese News
 Agency recently reported that Teng
 stated on January 5 that "we cannot
 commit ourselves to use no other than
 peaceful means to achieve reunification
 of the mother land ? 0 ? we cannot tie our
 hands in this matter." The inherent in-
 stability of the 'present system of gov-
 ernment in the People's Republic of
 China must be considered in dealing
 with that country. The instability of the
 present system is evident in the fact that
 Teng Hsiao-P'ing has been purged twice
 in the past and rehabilitated three
 times.
 Caution must be exercised to avoid
 any policy that hinges on the personal-
 ity of any individual who happens to be
 in power at this time. Moreover, there is
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE         March 13, 1979
 no established mechanism for the trans-
 fer of power within the framework of the
 present Government of the People's Re-
 public of China.
 It is in this context that legislation is
 critically important to reaffirm the U.S.
 commitment to the freedom and security
 of the people on Taiwan so that future
 changes in the Government of the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China will not have an
 adverse effect on Taiwan.
 A military invasion of Taiwan seems
 unlikely  given  the  present  military
 strength of Taiwan and U.S. Commit-
 ments to continue arms sales to Taiwan.
 However, I am concerned that the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China may use other
 pressure tactics to force reunification,
 such as an economic boycott, a military
 blockade, seizure of the offshore islands,
 or nuclear blackmail. For these reasons,
 I view section 114 of the proposed legis-
 lation, which was added by the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee, to be es-
 sential to this legislation. The impor-
 tance of this section cannot be over-
 emphasized:
 SEC. 114. (a) It is the policy of the United
 States-
 (1)  to maintain extensive,  close,  and
 friendly. relations with the people on Tai-
 wan;
 (2) to make clear that the United States'
 decision to establish diplomatic relations
 with the People's Republic of China rests on
 the expectation that any resolution of the
 Taiwan issue will be by peaceful means;
 (3) to consider any effort to resolve the
 Taiwan issue by other than peaceful means
 a threat to the peace and security of the
 Western Pacific area and of grave concern
 to the United States; and
 (4) to provide the people on Taiwan with
 arms of a defensive character.
 (b) In order to achieve the objectives of
 this section-
 (1) the United States will maintain its
 capacity to resist any resort to force or other
 forms of coercion that would jeopardize the
 security, or the social or economic system,
 of the people on Taiwan;
 (2) the United States will assist the people
 on Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-
 defense capability through the provision of
 arms of a defensive character;
 (3) the President is directed to inform the
 Congress promptly of any threat to the se-
 curity of Taiwan and any danger to the
 interests of the United States arising there-
 from; and
 (4) the United States will act to meet any
 danger described in paragraph (3) of this
 subsection in accordance with constitutional
 processes and procedures established by law.
 The language of the committee report
 explaining this section is of great signifi-
 cance, and therefore, Mr. President, I
 ask  unanimous  consent  that  it  be
 printed in the RECORD at the conclusion
 of my remarks.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection. it is so ordered.
 [See exhibit 1.1
 Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the
 language of the report makes it unequiv-
 ocal that the United states will main-
 tain its capacity to resist not only direct
 force, but indirect force as well, such as
 a blockade or boycott that would jeop-
 ardize the social or economic system of
 the people on Taiwan. The report also
 emphasizes the importance and necessity
 of assisting the people on Taiwan to
 maintain a sufficient defense capability
 through the provision of arms to that
 country. It is made clear that in assist-
 ing the people on Taiwan, the United
 States will not be limited solely to the
 supply of arms, but could assist in other
 appropriate ways. Thus, actions taken by
 the United States may be military if such
 actions would be in compliance with the
 war powers resolution. This does not,
 however, restrict the United States from
 using.whatever means would be most ef-
 fective to aid the people on Taiwan,
 whether such action be diplomatic, eco-
 nomic or in some other form.
 Mr. President, I find this "New China
 Policy" objectionable not because of the
 recognition of the People's Republic of
 China, but rather because of the aban-
 donment and sudden nature of the de-
 recognition of a long-time friend and
 ally, the Republic of China (Taiwan).
 My foremost consideration here today is,
 therefore, the continuing interest of the
 United States in the security and the de-
 fense of the people on Taiwan.
 The social, cultural, economic, and fi-
 nancial ties between our two countries
 should be preserved and to that end, I
 find this legislation to be necessary.
 Congress must, however, keep a close
 oversight on the Institute to insure that
 it is used to preserve the freedom and in-
 dependence of the people of Taiwan and
 not to destroy it. Section 402 of the
 Taiwan Enabling Act was adopted by the
 Foreign Relations Committee to aid Con-
 gress in fulfilling this mandate.
 This provision requires that every 0
 months, a report describing and review-
 ing economic relations  between the
 United States and the people on Taiwan
 shall be transmitted to the Speaker of
 the House of Representatives and the
 Committee on Foreign Relations of the
 Senate, noting any interference with
 normal commercial relations. This re-
 quirement must be utilized by Congress
 not as a merely perfunctory exercise, but
 rather as a tool to enable Congress to
 insure the continuance of normal com-
 mercial relations between our countries.
 The announcement made by President
 Carter of normalization of relations be-
 tween the People's Republic of China
 and the United States on December 15
 came as a surprise to the American people
 and to Congress. There was no meaning-
 ful prior consultations with Congress de-
 spite section 36 of the International Se-
 curity Assistance Act of 1978 which called
 for prior consultation on any proposed
 policy changes affecting the continuation
 in force of the mutual defense treaty
 with Taiwan.
 The additional views of Senator HELMS '
 Of North Carolina succinctly state the
 issues raised and the consequences of this
 precipitous action by the President as:
 First, the perceptions of the world com-
 munity, particularly among our allies is
 that the United States lacks any cohesive.
 or comprehensive foreign policy, and
 abandons its friends and allies whenever
 the United States views it expedient to
 do so.
 Second, the actions of the President are
 of doubtful legality and constitutional
 validity both because of the President's.

 ties is clearly indicated by the circumstances
 shall not be inferred-
 (1) from any provision of law (whether or
 not in effect before the date of the enact-
 ment of this joint resolution), including any
 provision contained in any appropriation Act,
 unless such provision specifically authorizes
 the introduction of United States Armed.
 Forces into hostilities or into such situations
 and states that it is intended to constitute
 specific statutory authorization within the
 meaning of this joint resolution. .
 The consequence'of this provision is two-
 fold: (1) it precludes the President from in-
 ferring authority from paragraph (4) to in-
 troduce the armed forces into hostilities or
 into situations wherein involvement in hos-
 tilities is clearly indicated by the circum-
 stances; and (2) it reinforces the non-auto-
 maticity of the United States' undertakings,
 since, unless the President were authorized to
 introduce the armed forces into hostilities,
 the United' States could not be considered to
 have undertaken to respond, automatically,
 in the event of danger.
 While the Committee inserted the refer-
 ence to "procedures established by law" pri-
 marily to make clear that the War Powers
 Resolution is fully applicable to all actions
 taken in connection with this section, it
 would note that the reference is not legally
 necessary since all provisions of the Resolu-
 tion are applicable under their own terms.
 Accordingly, the inclusion of this reference
 in this bill should not be construed, in the
 case of some other, similar statute enacted
 in the future, as suggesting in any way that
 the absence of any such reference in that
 statute has rendered the Resolution inappli-
 cable. The provisions of the Resolution will
 continue to apply ex proprio vigore.
 O Mr. WEICKER. Mr. President, this
 Nation's diplomatic recognition of the
 People's Republic of China is a welcome
 event which I whole-heartedly support.
 But the manner in which the Carter ad-
 ministration has handled that decision
 and the legislation before us falls short
 of the standards we should expect of
 American diplomacy.
 On December 15. President Carter
 stated that we were establishing full re-
 lations with the PRC in recognition of
 "simple reality." It is certainly ti.' a that
 we are rectifying a diplomatic mistake
 therefore nearly 1 billion Chinese people
 with whom we should have full relations.
 But to glibly derecognize 17 million
 people of Taiwan in the process is not
 my idea of "simple reality." We as a
 people and as a government should do
 everything in our power to realize and
 recognize that we have two entities here,
 not one China.
 'The security arrangements of this
 agreement are clouded by reports that
 the Carter administration did not seek
 a guarantee from the mainland Chinese
 against military action against Taiwan.
 Based on that frank and forceful display
 'of American dealings with our new
 friend, provisions.in this bill which ex-
 press our "grave concern" for the securi-
 ty of Taiwan do not amount to much. We
 know it and the Chinese know it.
 In terms of the integrity of our word
 and system of government, the Presi-
 dent's hastily engineered recognition re-
 flects poorly on us and how we conduct
 ourselves in this democracy.
 On the matter of the "American Insti-
 tute in Taiwan," we are asked in this bill
 to enact a falsehood. The Carter admin-
 D - SENATE          March 13, 1979
 istration tells us in one breath that first
 governmental  relations  with Taiwan
 must cease and second that the Congress
 must authorize and appropriate funds
 for an Institute to carry out those func-
 tions.
 Mr. President, it is a hoax to call an
 institute which is conceived, authorized,
 funded by the United States Government
 "nongovernmental." I will have no part
 in devaluing our moral currency just to
 close this particular deal.
 The integrity of our democratic sys-
 tem is challenged, Mr. President when
 our Chief Executive Officer ignores the
 expressed intent of Congress. President
 Carter's failure to respect the unanimous
 vote of this body requesting prior consul-
 tation on any change in status in the
 Mutual Defense Treaty, damages the
 constitutional dynamics of our foreign
 policy decisionmaking, now and for the
 future.
 Mr. President, by passing this bill in
 its present form, the Senate would certi-
 fy a logic and morality which have no
 place in our foreign policy. When we deal
 realistically, forcefully and honestly with
 our own people and the people of the
 world we earn their respect. When we
 settle for expediency, compromise and
 gimmickry we cheapen everything the
 United States stands for and hopes to
 be.O
 O Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I will vote
 for passage of the Taiwan enabling leg-
 islation which we are considering today
 because it provides the best possible
 means for maintaining and assuring the
 the continued prosperity and security
 for the people of Taiwan. This is in our
 vital national interests to do.
 I belive that the Senate Committee on
 Foreign Relations has produced a flinely
 crafted bill which will enable both the
 United States and the Government of
 the Republic of China on Taiwan to con-
 tinue to derive mutual economic, cul-
 tural and political benefit from a strong
 and stable relationship. The fact that
 Taiwan is the second most successful
 and that our trade turnover with that
 island last year was over $7 billion indi-
 cates the significant role Taiwan plays in
 the stability and progress of the region.
 The Government of Taiwan has also
 been a longtime ally and friend of the
 United States. We therefore have a moral
 responsibility to provide Taiwan with
 the defensive weapons it needs to main-
 tain its own security and discourage the
 People's Republic of China for settling
 the final status of Taiwan unilaterally
 and by other than peaceful means.
 The security section of the bill is very
 clear on this point. What is equally as
 clear is the strong support which the
 people of Taiwan enjoy in this country.
 If the PRC Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping
 learned anything from his trip to the
 United States, it was the continuing con-
 cern which Americans feel for the future
 of Taiwan. I believe the security section
 of S. 245 is appropriately worded so as
 to leave no doubt in the mind of any
 present or future PRC leader that to use
 military  force  against  Taiwan  puts
 China's relationship with the United
 States at great risk. While I do not be-
 lieve that the PRC has either the mili-
 tary capability or political intentions to
 attempt an armed takeover of Taiwan  -
 now or in the foreseeable future, we must
 firmly state our expectations as to this
 regard. President Carter himself recently
 commented that nothing in the agree-
 ment to establish diplomatic relations
 with the PRC would prevent him or some
 future President from direct military
 support of Taiwan if attacked by the
 PRC or threatened from some other
 source.
 Last Thursday, I voted with my col-
 leagues to defeat an amendment to sub-
 stitute language in section 114 which
 states specifically that any effort to re-
 solve the Taiwan issue by other than
 peaceful means would be considered a
 threat to the peace and security of the
 ? Western Pacific area and of grave con-
 cern to-the United States. The amend-
 ment which was defeated sought to state
 specifically that such efforts would not
 only be considered a threat to the peace
 and security of the Western Pacific area
 but also to the security interests of the
 United States. While I appreciate and
 share the concern of my colleagues who
 voted for this change, I concluded that
 this change in language was unnecessary
 since the security interests of the United
 States extend to the Western Pacific area.
 Despite the value of such a redundant
 statement for domestic political pur-
 poses, this small change in the wording
 of a paragraph in section 114 of the bill
 could not be decisive in terms of whether
 the United States would act if the time
 ever came when Taiwan came under at-
 tack from mainland China. Nothi~g in
 the legislation restricts the President
 from taking any action he deems appro-
 priate to meet such a contingency. Every-
 thing in section 114 is an affirmative mes-
 sage to the people of Taiwan and the
 People's Republic of China that the
 United States will uphold our moral obli-
 gation to help assure their safety and
 security and protect our vital interests in
 the area.
 Mr. President, I think the complexity
 of the issue S. 245 addresses should also
 impress upon us that the security of Tai-
 wan means more than the ability to beat
 back an armed invasion attempt. There-
 fore, it is especially important that part
 of the security section of this bill spe-
 cifically states that-
 The United States will maintain its capac-
 ity to resist any resort to force or other forms._
 of coercion that would jeopardize the secur-
 ity, or the social or economic system, of the
 people of Taiwan.

 tem is so highly developed also makes it
 vulnerable to economic boycott and
 blackmail. While the prevailing economic
 conditions in the East and Southeast
 Asian area where Taiwan has extensive
 commercial relationships owning to its
 high level of technology intensive indus-
 tries certainly make it hard to imagine
 what non-Communist countries would
 abet such an effort, it is important that
 the United States state clearly its con-
 cern and retain our capacity to help our
 friends on Taiwan resist such coercion.
 Because of my own concern, I cospon-
 sored an amendment which was accepted

 by the Senate to go further by adding a
 new section which provides that noth-
 Ing in S. 245 shall be construed as a basis
 for supporting the expulsion or exclusion
 of the people of Taiwan from continued
 membership in international financial
 ' and other international organizations.
 The importance of the Asia Develop-
 ment Bank, the World Bank, the Inter-
 national Monetary Fund, and other mul-
 tilateral economic institutions cannot be
 stressed too strongly in a world growing
 Increasingly dependent upon financial
 cooperation in undertaking development
 projects. How tragic it would be if one of
 the foremost examples of an underde-
 veloped nation becoming a highly de-
 veloped one and good customer for
 American products were to be systemat-
 ically excluded from participation In
 these important enterprises.
 Because the legislation we are con-
 sidering seeks to assist the President in
 doing something literally without prece-
 dent in our diplomatic history, I believe
 it is also only right that Congress be a
 full partner in this process, Accordingly,
 I also cosponsored and the Senate ac-
 cepted an amendment establishing a
 Joint Commission for Security and Co-
 operation in East Asia. Again, the im-
 portance of this oversight when I refer
 to our considerable mutual economic in-
 terests with Taiwan and when we realize
 that the instrumentality to carry for-
 ward this relationship-the American In-
 stitute in Taiwan-is untested.
 The commission will have 12 members,
 6 from the House and 6 from the Senate
 and would monitor and report on the full
 range of policy concerns expressed in the
 bill, including the operation and pro-
 cedures of the instrumentality responsi-
 ble for our relations with Taiwan, the
 degree of success in maintaining free
 and unfettered cultural, commercial, and
 other relations between Taiwan and the
 United States; and human rights.
 Finally, Mr. President, the normaliza-
 tion of our relations with the People's
 Republic of China has required a "de-
 recognition" that the Government of the
 Republic of China on Taiwan is the sole
 and legitimate government for all of
 China. To insist that we could succeed
 or devise. a plan under the present cir-
 cumstances where we could impose upon
 the PRC acceptance of the political fic-
 tion of the Government of the Republic
 of China's claim is wholly inconsistent
 with the Shanghai Communique of 1972.
 But it is more than that. It is an un-
 helpful Impulse to see the world as we
 would wish it to be and not as it truly
 Is. While some critics of this course would
 dismiss such a realization as a retreat
 by the United States, I would strongly
 disagree. On the contrary, the decision
 to establish formal ties with the PRC
 signals a renewed U.S. commitment to
 participate in the process of peace and
 stability in Asia and the Pacific basin.
 It enhances our influence in the area
 and helps us assure the security of Ja-
 pan, our principal ally in the region and
 the real anchor of our security interests
 in East Asia. I say this to point out that
 a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue
 is not just In the interest of the United
 States but important to the other na-
 tions committed to peace, progress, and
 stability in the region.
 In short, the "derecognition" of the
 Government of the Republic of China
 on Taiwan is not and, as long as I am
 in the Senate, will not be an abandon-
 ment of the people of Taiwan. I cannot
 tell my colleagues in this Chamber what
 the precise future of the people on Tai-
 wan will be in terms of their final polit-
 ical status. But I can say a determination
 of that status will come about through
 the process of negotiation rather than
 through force of arms, because of the
 dedication and concern for the future of
 these brave people shared by my col-
 leagues and the American people whom
 we represent.O
 o Mr. SCHMITT. Mr. President, after a
 great deal of consideration, _I have re-
 luctantly decided to vote for final pas-
 sage of S. 245, the Taiwan Enabling Act.
 I shall vote for S. 245 because there is
 no realistic alternative at this time. This
 issue has been handled poorly from the
 beginning.
 -with the Congress prior to his surprise
 December 15 announcement can only in-
 dicate that the President does not recog-
 nize the constitutional and political role
 of Congress in the formulation of for-
 eign policy which has evolved over the
 years. His decision to terminate the Mu-
 tual  Defense  Pact  is  particularly
 troubling. I am certain, Mr. President,
 that many nations are now reconsidering
 the value of a treaty with the United
 States. It is of grave concern to me that
 If the President's decision on this treaty
 is allowed to stand, this President or any
 future President can unilaterally. termi-
 nate any treaty such as the NATO
 Treaty, the SALT Treaty, or the Mutual
 Defense Pact with the Republic of Korea.
 Mr. President, while I support the rec-
 ognition of the People's Republic of
 China, there is absolutely no reason why
 that recognition was contingent on the
 derecognition of the Republic of China
 and the abrogation of the Mutual De-
 fense Pact. The normalization of rela-
 tions with Peking is of greater benefit to
 the PRC than to the United States. It is
 absurd that the United States made the
 greater concessions in the negotiations.
 Be that as it may, the legislation to
 provide for relations with the people and
 Government on Taiwan which was sub-
 mitted by the President did not even
 adequately provide for the security of the
 island. Only after extensive reworking
 by the Senate Foreign Relations Commit-
 tee has the legislation become somewhat
 acceptable. It has, however, been obvi.
 ous that only certain changes in the bill
 will be tolerated. Efforts to strengthen
 the security guarantees to our allies on
 Taiwan have been defeated. The argu-
 ment has been that these amendments
 "would weaken the office of the.Presi-
 dent." Since when, Mr. President, do
 guarantees for the security of our friends
 weaken the Presidency? If the improv-
 ing of this legislation does, in fact,
 weaken the Presidency, then we certainly
 do not need this bill.
 Mr. President, I supported the amend-
 ment to establish a liaison office in Taipei
 since one existed in Peking for a number
 S 2595
 of years. This amendment was defeated.
 I supported the amendment to more
 clearly define the term "people . on
 Taiwan." This amendment was defeated.
 I supported the amendment to send a
 loud and clear message to Peking that
 no threat to the security of Taiwan will
 be tolerated at any time in the future.
 This amendment was also defeated. At
 that point, it was obvious that the Sen-
 ate failed to write the type of bill which
 was beneficial to the.long-term interests
 of both the United States and Taiwan
 and of our allies everywhere.
 The reality of the situation, however,
 is that we must establish some type of
 relationship with the people and Gov-
 ernment on Taiwan. Due to the poor
 handling of the situation by the admin-
 istration and due to the hurried time-
 table. which the administration arbi-
 trarily imposed, Taiwan is today left
 without any type of formal or informal
 relations with the United States. In an
 effort to resolve this embarrassing situa-
 tion, I shall reluctantly support S. 245.0
 sINO-AMERICAN  RELATIONS
 0 Mr. PERCY. Mr. President, we have
 been fortunate in the foresight of the
 leaders and diplomats who have made
 possible the dramatic breakthrough in
 diplomatic relations between China and
 the United States.
 First there was Chairman Mao and
 Premier Zhou on the Chinese side and
 President Richard Nixon and Secretary
 of State Henry Kissinger for the United
 States who succeeded in negotiating the
 Shanghai Communique of 1972.
 Ambassador Huang Zhen, who later
 became the first Chinese Ambassador to
 be stationed in Washington, was Am-
 bassador to France in 1972 and promoted
 relations between the two countries
 through his contacts with his counter-
 part, U.S. Ambassador to France Ar-
 thur K. Watson.
 These important initial meetings were
 followed by meetings with President Ford
 and Henry Kissinger, President Jimmy
 Carter, Secretary Cyrus Vance, and As-
 sistant to the President for National
 Security Zbigniew Brzezinski, together
 with such congressional leaders as Mike
 Mansfield, Hugh Scott,  TED KENNEDY,
 and many others who have traveled to
 Beijing to speak directly to Chinese
 leaders. U.S. Ambassador Leonard Wood-
 cock, an established expert in labor nego-
 tiations, played a key role in the final
 weeks of progress. Both Chairman Hua
 Guofeng and Vice Chairman Deng Xia-
 oping have provided the leadership nec-
 essary on their side to see our negotia-
 tions culminate in full diplomatic rela-
 tions. And former Ambassador Huang
 Chen, former Deputy of the PRC'liaison
 -office Hua Xu, as well as His Excellency
 Chaff Zemin, China's new Ambassador to
 the United States, have all- played im-
 portant roles in establishing our new re-
 lations.
 We owe a great deal to these distin-
 guished leaders on both sides of the
 Pacific and to many others, both Repub-
 licans and Democrats, who have con-
 tinued to work toward normalization of
 relations  between  our,  two  nations.
 Normalization is in the best interest of

 S 2596
 CONGRESSIONAL R]ECORD -SENATE          March 13, 1979
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the
 Congress is now completing a historic
 process begun last December 15. On that
 date, President Carter announced our
 Nation's recognition of the People's Re-
 public of China. Since then, we have
 demonstrated our ability to adopt a real-
 istic policy toward the nearly 1 billion
 people on the Chinese mainland. We
 have recognized the fact that Peking has
 governed these people for nearly three
 decades. We have made it possible to
 move forward, at long last, toward nor-
 mal and enduring relations between our
 two countries.
 At the same time, we are behaving with
 responsibility to the people of Taiwan.
 Through the Taiwan Enabling Act (S.
 245), the Congress will demonstrate our
 ability and our readiness to maintain a
 full range of unofficial relations with
 Taiwan. Our ties with its people should
 remain unimpaired, because they should
 remain the same in substance even
 though they change in form. The Taiwan
 Enabling Act will maintain "commercial,
 cultural, and other relations with the
 people on Taiwan," on unofficial instead
 of official terms.
 This achievement is due in no small
 part to the careful and thorough work of
 the Committee on Foreign Relations and
 its chairman, Senator CHURCH.
 I was pleased to be able to testify be-
 fore the committee and contribute to its
 work. I welcome particularly its subse-
 quent incorporation of section 114, de-
 signed to help insure the future security
 of the people on Taiwan.
 This section reflects the full substance
 of the Taiwan Security Resolution (S.J.
 Res. 31) introduced by 30 Senators,,in-
 cluding Senators CRANSTON and myself,
 as well as by Congressman WOLFF and
 106 Members of the House. As a result
 of its incorporation in the Taiwan En-
 abling Act, we have made legislative pro-
 vision for substantive 'continuity in our
 relations ? wi$h the people on Taiwan in
 the vital security sphere-also on unoffi-
 cial terms, in a manner consistent with
 our new diplomatic relationship with the
 People's Republic of China.
 Mr. President, I am confident that our
 ties with the people on Taiwan will not
 only remain unimpaired, but will actu-
 ally be enhanced in the months and
 years ahead. We have finally removed
 Taiwan as a diplomatic issue between
 China and the United States. No longer
 do the Chinese feel duty-bound to object
 to official relations based on our past
 pretense that the government of 17 mil-
 lion controls a nation of almost 1 billion.
 In turn, the Chinese have agreed to con-
 tinue unofficial ties between us  and
 Taiwan-ties which should expand and
 strengthen just as Japan's did after it
 normalized relations on the same basis
 in 1972. It is no accident that Japanese
 trade with Taiwan as well as with the
 mainland has quintupled since normali-
 zation, from roughly $1 billion each in
 1971 to over $5 billion each in 1978.
 The senior Senators from Virginia and
 Arizona  (Senators  BYRD  and  GOLD-
 WATER)                      and others resurrected their
 argument last week that the President
 lacked authority to give 1 year's notice
 of termination of our mutual Defense
 Treaty with Taiwan-in spite of that
 treaty's explicit provision for such termi-
 nation under its article X, which states
 that-
 Either party may terminate it 1 year after
 notice has been given to the other party.
 They argue, furthermore, that the con-
 sent of two-thirds of the Senate or a
 majority of both Houses of Congress is
 required for the termination of any
 Mutual Defense Treaty concluded by the
 United States. These arguments are of
 great interest to members of the Com-
 mittee on the Judiciary, which I have the
 privilege of chairing.
 I have carefully examined the consti-
 tutional and historical basis of these
 objections, and I am personally con-
 vinced that the President had full au-
 thority to take the actions he did to
 normalize relations with Peking, includ-
 ing termination of the defense treaty
 with Taipei. I am confident that the
 President's decision will not be reversed,
 either by the courts or by the Congress,
 and I look forward to the debate on
 this issue in committee and on the floor
 later this spring.
 While focusing on the exact terms of
 normalization for both Taiwan and the
 Chinese mainland, I believe that we
 should all bear in mind the broader con-
 text in which these terms have become
 possible.
 There are some who say that normali-
 zation was a reflection of American
 weakness. I say the opposite. Normaliza-
 tion is a reflection of American strength:
 Our strength to recognize the reality of
 nearly 1 billion people controlled not by
 Taipei but by Peking. Our strength to
 act with responsibility to the 17 million
 people on Taiwan, with whom we have
 enjoyed close ties for over three decades.
 Our  strength  to  consolidate  and
 strengthen relations with the creative,
 industrious  and  rapidly modernizing
 Chinese people, and thus to contribute
 to the peace and stability riot only of
 Asia but of the world.
 Mr. President, last week I received very
 thoughtful statements on the implica-.
 tions of normalization from academic,
 business, civic, religious, and other com-
 munity leaders throughout the United
 States. I would like to share some of these
 statements with my colleagues, who
 I believe will find them'as helpful as I
 have in assessing the broader Implica-
 tions of our China policies now and in the
 future. I request that the statements be
 printed at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ments were ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 STATEMENTS
 Prof. Harlan Cleveland, Director, Program
 in International Affairs, Aspen Institute for
 Humanistic Studies, Austin, Tex.
 "Normalization of relations with the PRC
 was overdue. But our debate about it risks
 making this move look a lot more than it ip.
 Let's be clear about three things that normal-
 ization is not:
 "1. It is not the dawn of a nice, easy,
 comfortable relationship. Diplomatic rela-
 tions don't protect us against unpleasant
 surprises-not on China's southern border
 and not in the Middle East or Africa or the
 Persian Gulf either.
 "2. It is not the end of Taiwan's chance
 to live its own life. The Japanese have al-
 ready shown how to conduct business as
 usual without an embassy in Taipei.
 113. It is not an anti-Soviet move. The rift
 between Moscow and Peking was not made
 in Washington. Our cue is to get along with
 both the Soviet Union and China, even if they
 elect not to get along with each other."
 Prof. Okira Iriye, Department of History,
 University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.
 "I am irf favor US-PRC normalization as
 it facilitates greater commercial and cultural
 interactions between the two countries. They
 have a great deal to offer to each other. I
 do hope, however, that normalization will not
 lead to any kind' of military alliance which
 will unnecessarily create tensions among the
 countries of the Far East, especially between
 the US and the Soviet Union. I favor nor-
 malization in the hope that it will lead to
 lessening of tensions and eventual arms re-
 duction in Asia, rather than  to increased
 chances of war."
 Prof. Victor H. Li, Stanford University,
 U.S.-China Relations Program, Stanford, Cal-
 ifornia.
 "I am delighted that normalization of re-
 lations with the People's Republic of China
 has finally taken place. The announcement
 of December 15, 1978 marks a fundamental
 point in developing cooperative ties with that
 major country.
 "But it should be stressed that normaliza-
 tion, in and of itself, does not lead to full
 friendly relations. Many political and legal
 issues must still. be resolved. For example,
 in the short term we must consider the
 means by which normal dealings with China
 could be enhanced-including how to cope
 with the unrealistically high expectations for
 trade and investments held by some persons.
 More importantly, we must examine the long-
 term strategic effects that improving US-
 China relations would have on our relations
 with the Soviet Union, Japan, and other
 areas. In addition, the normalization process
 has successfully avoided confronting the Tai-
 wan problem. Yet that problem must be
 dealt with eventually. As the people on Tai-
 wan go about the difficult and potentially
 disruptive business of deciding their future
 course, the US will likely face a series of
 politically and morally troublesome decisions
 concerning our dealings with China and with
 Taiwan."
 Mr. Winston Lord, President, Council on
 Foreign Relations, New York, N.Y.
 "As one who has been directly involved
 from the outset in the opening to China, I
 strongly favor improved relations with that
 country. I believe this process can lessen ten-
 sions and strengthen stability in Asia and
 the world, improve our overall international
 position, and bring cultural, economic and
 other bilateral benefits. Normalization of re-
 lations with Peking is a significant step in
 that process which I support, although the
 crucial factor in our relationship will remain
 the vision and steadiness of our world role.
 We also have a deep obligation to the people
 on Taiwan, who have been loyal friends and
 have behaved with great decency and re-
 straint through troubled times. Thus I wel-
 come firm Congressional expressions of con-
 cern for the future security and prosperity
 of the people on Taiwan. These add an im-
 portant element of reassurance to the series
 of actions announced by the Administration
 since December."
 Mr. Richard A. Melville, President, and
 Chief Executive Officer, Allied Bank Interna-
 tional, New York, New York.
 "I believe that normalization between the
 U.S. and the People's Republic of China, the
 country with the largest population on earth
 and both countries situated, with long coast
 lines on the periphery of the Pacific Ocean

 sessions, such as Guam, Samoa, almost in
 the middle of the Pacific) is essential for
 the peaceful development within the Pacific
 basin and this normalization has been held
 off for too long.
 "Only by being able to communicate di-
 rectly with the Chinese government will we
 'be able to influence China's movements and
 developments of which perhaps hydrogen
 power and weaponry may be the most im-
 portant.
 "China, I believe, is clearly afraid of now
 being encircled by Russia also from the south,
 in addition to their long mutual border in
 the north. This may well be at least part
 of their quick agreement to normalization
 of their relations with the U.S.
 "For this reason, I do not believe that they
 would undertake any drastic measures to in-
 corporate Taiwan politically and economically
 into China anywhere in the near future. I be-
 lieve militarily they could not handle it and
 they know it would be a devastating blow to
 their new relationship with the U.S. With
 the history of thousands of years behind
 them another few years are of little signif-
 icance.
 "With the new leadership in Peking, the
 old traditional ideology of self-development
 and self-reliance appears to have been put
 aside for the time being and new develop-
 ment plans seem to be surfacing almost
 everyday. Within the next two or three dec-
 ades, this huge country is to catch up with
 the industrial world, and the old American
 businessman's dream of eyeing the hundreds
 of millions of Chinese as potential customers
 may still become reality. From the technolo-
 gical point of view, they need just about
 everything, and with thhe United States
 growing interest in expanding its exports it
 is of the utmost Importance for us to estab-
 lish as quickly as possible economic, politi-
 cal and cultural relations to build up our
 trade. If we do not act now, we will find that
 we have lost this enormous market to ag-
 gressive Japanese and European competition."
 Dr. Shirley Sun, Executive Director, Chi-
 nese Cultural Foundation, San Francisco,
 California.
 "As an Asian American and an Asian art
 historian, I fully support President Carter's
 enlightened and sensible policy in the nor-
 malization of relations between the US and
 the PRO.
 "This policy, so late in coming, is finally
 dealing with global reality. At the same time,
 it will open up avenues of profitable ex-
 change between the US and China that we
 cannot afford to ignore-in the areas of sci-
 ence, culture and trade that will greatly
 benefit the lies of all Americans, not to
 mention the importance it will bring to the
 maintenance of world peace."
 Dr. James C. Thomsen, Curator, Nieman
 Foundation for Journalism, Harvard Univer-
 sity, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
 "The Carter Administration, with deft skill
 and fine timing, has successfully concluded
 the overdue process of normalization of rela-
 tions between the United States and China
 that Presidents Nixon and Ford made pos-
 sible. It has done so in a way that assures the
 security and well being of the people of Tai-
 wan while averting the creation of a self-
 styled second "China" whose status would be
 constantly under threat. The people of Tai-
 -wan will now be as well protected as before;
 and Chinese-American relations can at last
 proceed on a rational and peaceful basis
 after nearly thirty years of largely unneces-
 sary hostility."
 Dr. Franklin J. Woo, China Program Direc-
 tor, Division of Overseas Ministries, National
 Council of Churches of Christ in the USA,
 New York, N.Y.
 "Generally speaking constituent members

 of diplomatic relations between the PRC and

 League of Women Voters of the United
 States.
 "League of Women Voters President Ruth
 J. Hinerfeld has heralded the establishment
 of the U.S. diplomatic relations with the
 People's Republic of China as a bold and
 historic step. She disclaims any direct con-
 nection between President Carter's dramatic
 announcement on December 15 and her early
 .December trip to the People's Republic of
 China with a prestigious delegation of civic
 and world affairs leaders. What is "right
 on target", the League president readily
 admits, is the credit frequently given the
 LWV for its vanguard role over a decade
 ago in paving the way for normalization of
 U.S. relations with the PRC.
 "In early 1969, three years before the
 Shanghai Communique, the League's mem-
 ber study culminated in a forward looking
 position. In that position, the League called
 for U.S. initiatives to facilitate PRC par-
 ticipation in the world community and to
 relax tensions between the U.S. and China.
 The League recommended a range of policies
 to encourage normalization of relations-
 through travel, cultural exchanges and un-
 restricted trade in nonstrategic goods. The
 League also urged the U.S. to withdraw its
 opposition to PRC -representation in the
 UN and to move toward establishing dip-
 lomatic relations with the PRC.
 "Ms. Hinerfeld stresses that the League
 was aware from the outset of the need for
 political astuteness and careful timing, and
 its actions during the late 60s and early
 70s were carefully calculated to support
 various Presidential and Congressional ini-
 tiatives at the most propitious times. She
 also emphasizes the pride League members
 take in their role in helping to open the
 diplomatic doors between the most populous
 and the most powerful nations.
 "The League stands ready to support such
 legislative proposals as most-favored-nation
 treatment of the PRC."

 The second assistant legislative clerk
 proceeded to call the roll.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the order for the
 quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, it,might
 be appropriate at this time for me to
 express my very deep appreciation to the
 members of the staff of the Foreign Re-
 lations Committee who worked so very
 hard to organize the hearings and to
 draft for the committee various amend-
 ments that, in my judgment, greatly im-
 proved this bill.
 When the legislation first came to us
 from the administration, it was inade-
 quate. I said at that time that it was
 woefully inadequate, and I do- not believe
 that I overstated the case. But in the
 course of the committee's deliberations
 the bill was amended. It now gives fully
 adequate protection to the property
 holdings of the authorities on Taiwan
 and the people of Taiwan, and to the
 corporate entities in Taiwan that may
 be located here in the United States. It
 was also amended to give the people an
 access to the courts of this country, and
 to sue or to be sued.
 The question of extending appropriate
 privileges and immunities to those who
 will represent Taiwan in the institution
 which they are expected to establish was
 dealt with through committee action.  .
 Finally, and most importantly, a very
 strong unilateral statement was included
 in the bill giving full recognition to the
 continuing responsibility that the com-
 mittee felt this country owed the people
 on Taiwan by virtue of our long alliance
 with them. Thus we removed any basis
 for the charge that has previously been
 made that the United States has walked
 away from an old ally in order to do
 business with mainland China.
 The various weaknesses which were
 apparent in the administration's bill
 have been corrected, and I think the pos-
 ture of the United States is honorable
 and strong.
 Throughout this debate I have said, as
 have others. who support this legislation,
 that we commend the President of the
 United States for having at last faced up
 to the realities in Asia, for having had
 the political courage and conviction
 necessary to consummate the opening of
 mainland China that President Nixon
 initiated in 1972.
 Finally, Mr. President, we are on
 course again in Asia. The old policy of
 self-deception, which created for us a
 posture of endemic weakness respecting
 Asia, which contributed to our involve-
 ment in two indecisive wars and cost us,
 very dearly, is over. Even though we are
 late coming to the recognition that it is
 in our national interest to have direct
 dealings with China, in a government
 that exercises jurisdiction over one-
 quarter of the human race, it has, in fact,
 occurred at long last. For this I com-
 mend the President of the United States.
 Mr. President, the various changes in
 this bill to which I have referred, made
 by the committee and made by the Sen-
 ate as a whole in the past few days in
 the amendments that we have adopted,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE         March 13, 1979
 present, when taken together, a good bill
 in which we can take justifiable pride.
 I want to pay my respects to those
 members of the committee staff who as-
 sisted us throughout our deliberations:
 Mr. William Bader, the director of the
 staff; Patrick Shea, and William Barnds,
 who have been with me here on the floor
 of the Senate throughout the debate; Mr.
 Michael Glennon, our counsel; Mr. Peter
 Lakeland, the special assistant to our
 ranking member, Senator JAVITS, along
 with Ray Werner and Hans Binnedijk,
 who worked extensively on preparing the
 briefing books for the hearings.
 Mr. JAVITS. Will the Senator yield?
 Mr. CHURCH. I am happy to yield.
 Mr. JAVITS. I would like to add the
 name of Fred Tipson, who has been work-
 ing on this legislation.
 Mr.  CHURCH.  Yes.  He  definitely
 should be, included. I thank the Senator
 for mentioning his name.
 Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, may I say
 that I consider this piece of legislation to
 be statesmanlike, just, and well within
 the compass of our implementation, with
 every promise that it can work. What we
 have done is to base the legislation on
 what we are able to do and what we are
 able to judge and perceive. We have, I
 feel, avoided all of those amendments
 which would have sought to substitute us
 for the authorities on Taiwan. That is
 why I think this can work and work ef-
 fectively, giving deep assurance and safe-
 guards to the people on Taiwan. Just as
 we are having normal relations with the
 People's Republic of China, so within the
 limits of that policy we can have normal
 relations and express the morality as
 well as the practicality of our solicitude
 for the security and, very importantly,
 the social and economic system of the
 people on Taiwan as they design it as
 time goes on.
 I thank my colleague for his coopera-
 tion and for the magnificent work which
 he has done in the management of this
 bill.
 Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, may I
 say to the ranking minority member (Mr.
 JAVITS) that had it not been for his own
 initiatives it would never have been pos-
 sible for the committee to finally reach
 a unanimous vote on this bill, recom-
 mending it favorably to the Senate, nor
 would it have been possible to have
 achieved so commanding. a majority in
 connection with the language dealing
 with the future security of the people on
 Taiwan. To him I am especially indebted,
 as well as to all the other members of
 the committee who have participated so
 actively in bringing this matter to a final
 vote.
 It was once predicted that this would
 be extraordinarily divisive, that the com-
 mittee itself would be unable to reach a
 consensus, and that the Senate would be
 deeply divided. I think all of those pit-
 falls have been successfully avoided and
 that the Senate will, in fact, endorse this
 measure by an overwhelming vote.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 will the Senator yield?
 Mr. CHURCH. I yield.
 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. Mr. President,
 I believe this request has been cleared on
 the other side of the aisle:
 I ask unanimous consent that when
 H.R. 2479 is received from the House it
 be considered as having been read twice,
 that the Senate proceed to its immediate
 consideration, and, without any interven-
 ing debate or motion, that all after the
 enacting clause be stricken, that the text'
 of S. 245 as passed by the Senate, as we
 expect it to be passed shortly, be substi-
 tuted in lieu thereof, that without any
 further amendment or intervening mo-
 tion or debate the bill be read a third
 time and passed, that that action be
 deemed as having been reconsidered and
 laid on the table, that the Senate insist
 upon its amendments, request a confer-
 ence with the House and that the Chair
 be authorized to appoint the conferees.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection? Without objection, it is so
 ordered.
 Mr. McCLURE. Will the Senator from
 Idaho yield to his colleague 1 minute on
 the bill before the vote?
 Mr. CHURCH. Yes, but before I do
 that, may I express my thanks to the
 majority leader for the extremely helpful
 way in which he intervened on more
 than one occasion in the course of this
 debate to assist us when we needed his
 help, and for the effectiveness with which
 he did so. I appreciate it.
 Mr. JAVITS. And my thanks, as well,
 as the minority manager.
 Mr. BAKER. Mr. President, as we con-
 clude the debate on this difficult and im-
 portant legislation which establishes the
 foundation on which to build a new rela-
 tionship with Taiwan, I would like to
 take this opportunity to commend the
 distinguished ranking member of the
 Foreign Relations Committee for the role
 that he has played in its passage. In both
 the committee, and then on the floor, he
 has managed to blend widely divergent
 points-of-view, and he has protected well
 the rights of those on this side of the
 aisle who desired to contribute to this
 legislation. It was a demanding responsi-
 bility performed extraordinarily well, as I
 am certain it will be performed during
 the difficult issues ahead.
 Mr.- ROBERT C. BXRD. Mr. President,
 the establishment of full diplomatic rela-
 tions with the People's Republic of China
 is a step that is both realistic and in the
 national interest of the United States. In
 addition to meeting these basic criteria
 for American foreign policy, this action-
 opening official relations with the largest
 and one of the most important nations in
 the world-enhances U.S. credibility in
 the international arena. Relations be-
 tween the United States and China are
 also an important counterbalance in the
 triangular relationship involving our two
 countries and the Soviet Union.
 Normalization of relations was the log-
 ical extension of a policy which was set
 in motion by President Nixon during his
 visit to China in 1971. That policy, ex-
 pressed in the Shanghai Communique,
 was subsequently carried forward by
 President Ford and then by President
 Carter, who reached agreement with the
 Peking Government on normalization.
 While I have strongly supported this
 continuum in our foreign policy, I also
 have been concerned about assuring the
 continuing prosperity and security of the
 people of Taiwan.
 We want to maintain commercial, cul-
 tural, and other relations with Taiwan,
 and that is the purpose of the legislation
 which has been before the Senate in re-
 cent days. This bill, the Taiwan Enabling-
 Act, provides the mechanism by which
 those relations will be administered and.
 carried out.
 This mechanism, the American Insti-
 tute in Taiwan, will, I believe, prove to
 be a workable instrument for admin-
 istering United States-Taiwan relations.
 The Committee on Foreign Relations
 added important provisions to. the leg-
 islation in order to assure appropriate
 congressional oversight of the institute.
 In addition to our cultural and com-
 mercial relations with Taiwan, the fu-
 ture security of the people of Taiwan is
 a matter of particular concern to us.
 This was reflected in the extensive dis-
 cussion within the Committee on For-
 eign Relations as well as within the
 Senate.
 The committee's amendment to the
 bill. submitted by the administration
 makes absolutely clear to the People's
 Republic that its new relationship with
 the United States would be severely jeop-
 ardized if there is any use of force or
 other coercion against Taiwan.
 The assurances provided by Vice-Pre-
 mier Deng Xiaoping during his visit here
 earlier this year considerably allayed my
 concern for Taiwan's security. Deng said
 Taiwan would retain its autonomy as a
 governmental unit, its armed forces and
 the management of those forces, and its
 trade and commerce.
 In my discussion with him, Deng said
 that the People's Republic would not
 impose leaders on Taiwan and that the
 people living on Taiwan could select their
 own leaders. The one point upon which
 Deng insisted very strongly is that there
 is one China, and that Taiwan is part
 of China. This, of course, is something
 the United States acknowledged in the
 Shanghai Communique in 1972.
 I believe that the leaders of the Peo-
 ple's Republic recognize that any at-
 tempt to resolve the reunification ques-
 tion by other than peaceful means would
 be both extremely costly and counter-
 productive.
 Mr. President, the amendment by the
 Committee on Foreign Relations  and
 other Senate actions during our con-
 sideration of this bill, have left no room
 for doubt as to our continuing concern
 about the well-being of the people of
 Taiwan, notwithstanding our recogni:' "
 tion of the People's Republic.
 The committee,' under the leadership
 of its chairman, Mr. Cxvxcrr, has made
 a significant contribution to this legis-
 lation. I want to commend the chair-
 man, along with Senator JAVITS, the
 ranking minority member, and Senator
 GLENN, who helped manage this bill, for
 their efforts. A number of other Senators
 have taken active roles in the lengthy
 debate which has occurred here. The
 result is a bill which is deserving of our
 support and which will serve U.S. foreign
 policy interests.
 Mr. CHURCH. I thank the Senator
 very much. I yield to the Senator from
 Idaho.
 Mr. McCLURE.' Mr. President, I first
 of all want to state my concern that the

 bill may not have accomplished what we
 set out to accomplish. I think it is very
 clear that if the United States is com-
 mitted  to  resist         economic  pressure
 against Taiwan, that that economic
 pressure would not succeed. If, however,
 we fall short of that commitment it is
 only a question of time, and that may
 only be a short period of time. That
 ? would be my concern and the reason
 why I will not support the legislation. I
 thank the managers of the bill for the
 courtesy which they have extended to
 me throughout the debate. I do not mean
 to imply any personal criticism in my
 criticism of the result.
 ORDER FOR CONSIDERATION OF S. RESOLUTION 50

 dent, I ask unanimous consent that,

 eration of calendar order No. 39, Senate
 Resolution 50.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection?
 Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, reserving
 the right to object, what is it?
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. It is a resolu-
 tion disapproving the proposed deferral
 of budget authority to promote and de-
 velop fishery products and research per-
 taining to American fisheries.
 Mr. HELMS. I have no objection.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.

 is open to further amendment. If there
 be no further amendment to be pro-
 posed, the question is on agreeing to the
 committee amendment in the nature of

 ture of a substitute, as amended, was
 agreed to.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
 tion is on the engrossment and third

 condition that the American Institue in Tai-
 wan is reciprocally allowed such offices and

 States-
 (1)               to  maintain  extensive,  close,  and
 friendly relations with the people on Tai-

 the expectation that any resolution of the
 Taiwan issue will be by peaceful means;
 (3) to consider any effort to resolve the Tai-
 wan issue by other than peaceful means,

 DISAPPROVAL OF PROPOSED
 BUDGET DEFERRAL
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
 the previous order, the Senate will now
 proceed to the consideration of Calendar
 No. 39, Senate Resolution 50, which will
 be stated by title:
 The legislative clerk read as follows:
 A resolution (S. Res. 50) disapproving the
 proposed deferral of budget authority to pro-
 mote and develop fishery products and re-
 search pertaining to American fisheries.
 The Senate proceeded to consider the
 bill.
 Mr. MAGNUSON. Mr. President, may
 we have order in the Senate? The Sen-
 ate is not in order.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
 ate will be in order.
 Mr. MAGNUSON. Mr. President, I ask
 the majority leader if he has asked
 unanimous consent that.the Senate pro-
 ceed to the consideration of the bill.
 Mr. ROBERT C. BYRD. That has been
 done, and the matter is before the Sen-
 ate.
 I ask the distinguished chairman of
 the Appropriations Committee, for the
 benefit of other Senators, if he antici-
 pates any rollcall vote on this measure
 tonight.
 o Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in Oc-
 tober 1978, OMB deferred $12,060,000
 from the Saltonstall-Kennedy reserve
 fund for fiscal year 1979. Presently, $6,-
 579,000 of Saltonstall-Kennedy funds are
 still being deferred. Approximately 21
 fisheries development projects across the
 nation are not being funded, because of
 the deferral. These programs are de-
 signed to help American fishermen de-
 velop new techniques for harvesting and
 processing, and to develop new and' un-
 derutilized fisheries.
 American fishermen need our assist-
 ance if they are to compete effectively
 with foreign fishermen in our 200-mile
 fishing zone. As a cosponsor of Senate
 Resolution 50, I urge the Senate to vote
 favorably -on it.0
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. MAGNUSON. I yield.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I com-
 mend the chairman, Mr. MAGNUSON, for
 the strong support he gave to our resolu-
 tion in the committee and for the strong
 support we received from all the members
 of the colfmmittee. I understand that
 there was a unanimous vote in commit-
 tee. I believe this was as a result of the
 knowledge and understanding of the im-
 portance of these limited, but very im-
 portant resources, to the development of
 our fisheries.
 Even though it is a small amount of
 money, it has had an enormous impact in
 assisting fisheries in the East-in my own
 State of Massachusetts as well as all of
 New England-and on the west coast. it
 relates to legislation that was originally
 sponsored by then Senators John Ken-
 nedy and Leverett Saltonstall.
 It has been a small but vital resource
 to help our fishing industry. I think the
 results from these limited resources will
 be benefits many times over in terms of
 budget, in terms of tax revenues, and in
 terms of supporting an extremely impor-
 tant and vital industry.
 I congratulate the Senator from Wash-
 ington and thank him for the strong
 leadership he has shown in this matter.
 Mr. MAGNUSON. No, I do not.            Mr. MAGNUSON. I point out to the
