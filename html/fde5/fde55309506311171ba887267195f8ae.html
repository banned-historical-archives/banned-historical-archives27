 [To accompany H.R. 2479]
 [Including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office]
 The Committee on Foreign Affairs to whom was referred the.* bill
 (H.R. 2479) to help maintain peace, security, and stability in. the
 Western Pacific and to promote continued extensive,-close, and friendly
 relations between the people of the United 'States and the people on
 Taiwan, having considered the same, report favorably thereon without
 amendment and recommend that the bill do pass.
 BACKGROUND. AND COMMITTEE Ao'i oN .
 ,On December 15, 19,78,- President Carter announced agreement by the
 United 'States and the People's Republic of China 'to recognize each
 other and to establish 'diplomatic relations as of January 'I, 197.9. In a
 joint communique,, the United States recognized the government of the
 People's Republic of" China as "the sole legal government'of'Chma,"
 but stated that "the people of the United 'States will maintain cultural,
 commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people -6f Taiwan.:"
 The exchange of Ambassadors and estblishment of embassies was set
 'for March 1, 1979.
 In furtherance-of a policy of maintaining relations with Taiwan
 without official government representation and without diplomatic re-
 lations, and pending enactment of legislation on the subject, the Presi=
 'dent issued a Memorandum to all U.S. Government departments and
 agencies. The Presidential ' Memorandum directed the departments
 and agencies to continue to conduct l11'ogr ms, transactions Wand 'other

 relations with Taiwan; it stated that existing international agreements
 and arrangements with Taiwan would remain in force; it ordered that
 laws, regulations or orders of the United States which refer to a foreign
 country, state, government or similar entity be construed to apply to
 Taiwan; and it directed that U.S. interests will be represented, as ap-
 propriate, by an unofficial instrumentality in corporate form. On Janu-
 ary 16, 1979, an entity was incorp'orated' under the laws of the District
 of Columbia to serve as this instrumentality. It was named "The Amer-
 ican Institute in Taiwan."
 The President subsequently, on January 26, 1979, transmitted to
 Congress a draft bill -to provide for legislative implementation of the
 above policy in regard to continuing relations with Taiwan. The pur-
 pose of the proposed legislation was "to promote the foreign policy of
 the United States through the maintenance of commercial, cultural
 and other relations with the people on Taiwan on an unofficial basis,
 and for other purposes." The President asked for prompt enactment
 of the legislation. The bill was introduced on January 29, as H.R. 1614,
 by Chairman Zablocki, by request, and referred to the Committee on
 Foreign Affairs.
 . The full Committee heard initial Administration testimony on
 Taiwan legislation from Secretary 'of. State Vance on February 5,
 On February 7 it received testimony from Warren Christopher,
 Deputy Secretary of State. Deputy Secretary Christopher was ac-
 companied by Herbert J. Hansell, State Department Legal Adviser,
 John M. Thomas, Assistant Secretary for Administration, and
 Harvey Feldman, State Department Taiwan Coordinator. On Febru-
 ary 8, in morning and ~ afternoon sessions, the Committee heard
 testimony from the Honorable George Hansen, Member of Congress
 from Idaho, from Ambassador Leonard Unger, former Ambassador
 to the Republic of China, from Ambassador David Kennedy, Chair-
 man of the USA-ROC Economic Council, and from Ray S. Cline,
 Executive Director, World Power ,Studies, The Center for Strategic
 and International Studies, Georgetown University.
 Following the hearings of the full Committee on Foreign Affairs,
 the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs held public sessions
 on February 14 and 15, . at which Executive branch and public
 witnesses testified. On February 14, Richard Holbrooke, Assistant
 Secretary of State for East Asian and. Pacific Affairs, Michael Arma-
 cost, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia, Pacific and
 Inter-American Affairs, and Lee Marks, State Department Deputy
 Legal Adviser, appeared. On February 15, the Honorable Jim Leach,
 Member of Congress from Iowa, Dr. Peng Ming-min, Director of the
 Taiwanese-American Society, Winston Lord,-President of the Coun-
 cil on Foreign Relations, and Ambassador Walter. P. McConaughy,
 former Ambassador to the Republic of China, appeared. Additionally,
 extensive material was received for the record by the. full committee
 and 'the subcommittee in the course of the hearings.
 During the hearings, various shortcomings in the Administration
 legislation were discussed and additional and alternative provisions
 were suggested. Chairman Zablocki subsequently circulated among
 Commit-tee 'Members a-new draft bill which was-designed to remedy
 the deficiencies and reflect views expressed by Members, while also
 providing the President with the requested authority.

 markup sessions, using the new. draft as its markup document. The
 following day; February 28, H.R., 2479, a clean bill reflecting the Com-
 mittee's action in markup, was. introduced, by Chairman Zablocki

 lations between the American people and the people of Taiwan.
 PRINCIPLE FEATURES OF THE BILL
 The bill combines in one package a declaration of principles gov-
 erning U.S. policy toward Taiwan, protection of Taiwan security, and
 a legislative framework for carrying forward the full range of U.S.
 relationships with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties. It stresses

 security, and economic interest and must be maintained. Con-
 tinued close and friendly commercial, cultural and other re-
 lations with the people of Taiwan must be assured.
 -Taiwan's future must be determined by peaceful means without
 prejudice to the'well-being of-the people on Taiwan. Any armed
 attack against Taiwan, or use of force, boycott, or embargo, would
 be a threat to the peace and stability of the Western Pacific area
 and of grave concern to the United States.
 -The United States will make available to Taiwan defense articles
 and services' for' its' defense against armed attack. If Taiwan's
 security is threatened, the President shall promptly inform the
 Congress of any danger to U.S. interests, and the President and

 stitutional processes.
 -U.S. laws and programs will continue to apply with respect to
 Taiwan as if derecognition had not taken place. These include
 laws relating to rights, obligations, standing to sue and be sued,
 legal capacity, or eligibility for Taiwan to take part in programs
 and other activities under U.S. laws.
 -All treaties and international -agreements between the United
 States and the Republic of China which were in force on Decem-
 ber 31, 1978, will continue.in force unless terminated under their

 lic of China acquired' before January 1, 1979, shall not be affected

 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050016-5
 U.S. laws may be applied to the designated entity by the Presi-
 dent as if it were a U.S. Government agency.
 -Taiwan dealings with the U.S. Government shall be conducted
 through an instrumentality established by Taiwan in agreement
 with the President.

 Government service to work for the U.S. entity on Taiwan, with-
 out disadvantage to their government careers upon returning to
 government service and without loss of benefits.
 -Employees of the U.S. entity on Taiwan are authorized to perform
 services for protection of U.S. citizens and businesses which would
 be performed byU.S. consular officers in countries with which the
 United States has diplomatic relations.
 Taiwan is defined in the bill as including, as the context requires :
 The islands of Taiwan and the Pescadores; the inhabitants of those
 islands corporations and other entities and associations created or or-
 ganized under the laws applied there; and the authorities exercising
 governmental control on those islands, including their agencies and
 instrumentalities.
 COMMITTEE COMMENT
 The establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United
 States and the People's Republic of China (PRC), which has been
 widely welcomed in the Congress and by the American people gen-
 erally, has been accompanied by concern that this action not affect
 adversely the future well-being of the people on Taiwan or the wide
 range of non-diplomatic relationships between the United States and
 Taiwan. Such concern was reflected by the President when, in his
 December 15, 1978, announcement of the agreement with Peking, he
 stated that the American people will continue to have "extensive, close,
 and friendly relations" with the people of Taiwan. The intention of
 the Committee in approving H.R. 2479 is to give legislative embodi-
 ment to the policy of continuing and promoting the 'extensive range
 of nongovernmental relations between the United States and Taiwan
 within a framework of peace and stability in the Western Pacific area.
 The draft legislation submitted' by the Executive branch provided
 for the continuation of daily relationships between the United States
 Government and Taiwan previously. handled through embassies,
 through new instrumentalities. set up as private entities. The executive
 branch legislation specified that, for the, United States, the entity is
 to be the "American Institute in Taiwan," anon-profit corporation
 incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia. In the com-
 mittee's view, the executive branch. bill, H.R. 1614, did not address
 the broader concern for future peace and security of Taiwan, particu-
 larly in view of the President's announcement of intent- to terminate,
 as of December 31, 1979, the U.S.-ROC Mutual Defense Treaty; nor
 did it give sufficient emphasis to' assuring, a strong legal foundation
 for continuing, as. if derecognition. had not taken place, the broad

 scope of private commercial, cultural, and other nongovernmental ac-
 tivities that constitute the great bulk of relationships between the
 United States and Taiwan. Accordingly, the committee drafted and
 approved a clean bill, H.R. 2479, which addresses future U.S. policy
 toward Taiwan as a package : it deals with policy, with security, and
 with the legal foundation for continuing business and other relation-
 ships with Taiwan, as well as providing for a nongovernmental entity
 to handle matters previously handled by the American Embassy in
 Taipei.
 SECURITY FOR TAIWAN
 Since continued security for Taiwan and peace in the Western
 Pacific. are in the U.S. national interest and are a necessary condition
 for maintaining United States-Taiwan relationships, the Committee
 gave particular attention to security provisions in the bill.
 Two principles in the bill's policy declaration specifically address
 the question of protection for Taiwan, The fourth principle states that
 the. future-of Taiwan must be determined. through peaceful means in
 a way that will not prejudice the well-being of the people on Taiwan.
 The fifth principle declares that an armed attack against Taiwan or
 use of force, boycott or embargo to prevent Taiwan from engaging in
 foreign trade would threaten peace and stability in the region and be
 of grave concern to the United States.
 These principles are followed in the bill by a section for protection
 of U.S.. security interests. This section stipulates that the United States
 will supply Taiwan with defense articles. and services for. its defense
 against armed attack. Secondly, it requires the President to inform
 Congress promptly of any danger to U.S.. interests arising from threats
 to Taiwan and for joint Presidential-congressional determination of
 appropriate. action in response.
 The security provisions are designed to. make clear, among other
 things, that settlement of issues involving Taiwan by use of military
 force or coercion, such. as through interference with economic relation-
 ship, by boycotts, embargoes, or other means, is unacceptable to the
 United States. The committee has taken into account policy statements
 made, by the executive branch at the time of establishment of diplo-
 matic relations with, the, People's. Republic. of China. In the President's
 statement on last December 15, for example, he said "the, United States
 is confident that the people of Taiwan face a peaceful and prosperous
 future. The United States continues to have an interest in the peace-
 ful resolution of the Taiwan issue and expects that the Taiwan issue
 will be settled peacefully by the Chinese themselves." The parallel
 Chinese statement of the same date did not contradict the U.S. stand
 on a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question.
 The committee also notes various political and military factors that
 help insure the security of Taiwan and encourage a peaceful resolution
 of issues affecting Taiwan likely. Executive branch witnesses testified
 that an armed attack on Taiwan is'unlikely, that militarily the PRC is
 not now capable of mounting a successful invasion across the 100-mile-
 wide. Taiwan Strait, and that any PRC' attempt, to mount an invasion
 of Taiwan would require the PRO to weaken important defenses on its
 borders with the U.S.S.R. and Vietnam. From a political standpoint,
 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050016-5
 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050016-5
 the administration witnesses stated that such an attack would under-
 mine the PRC'smodernization effort and particularly jeopardize the
 active cooperation' required of the United States, Japan and the West
 in general for the modernization-to-succeed. It would also undermine
 Chinese relations with many, countries in Asia-which rem ain'extremely
 sensitive to Taiwan's fate. Also, in the judgment of executive branch
 witnesses, a PRC blockade of trade with Taiwan would pose prohibi=
 tivecosts'and,risks while offering little assurance of success.
 These judgments, while not in themselvesa guarantee of security for'
 Taiwan in future years, do indicate l that `inilitary action against
 Taiwan is unlikely in the near term and would be readily detected by
 the United States and other countries of the world ' and that appro-
 priate response would be possible. In the meanwhile, the committee is
 making clear in this legislation that the United States will continue to
 sell arms to Taiwan for its defense. The United States currently is
 preparing to deliver previously ordered defense equipment in the
 pipeline valued at more than $850 million.. It is the committee's intent
 that the United States will continue to make available modern weapons
 for Taiwan, and not shift to a policy of supplying only obsolete weap-
 ons. In fact the United States should make available those types of
 conventional weapons and equipment needed for Taiwan's defense and
 not upon the reaction that supplying such defense articles or defense
 services might stimulate.
 If, . nonetheless, an armed attack or use of force against Taiwan
 were, to occur, the legislation makes clear that there should be a'prompt
 response by the United States. What would be appropriate action,
 including possible use of force in Taiwan's defense, would depend on
 the specific circumstances. The committee does not attempt to specify
 in advance what the particular circumstances or response might be;
 and in any event, U.S. action is to be according to Constitutional proc-
 esses. In the, committee's opinion, at the very least, the United States
 should seriosly consider withdrawing recognition of the PRC.
 Finally, the committee takes particular note of recent statements by
 Chinese leaders, most notably by Chinese Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-
 p'ing, which indicate that the PRC will accept a Taiwan. that will
 maintain its present economic and social system, that 'will continue
 foreign trade. and investment and people-to-people contact, and main-
 tain its own armed forces. These policy statements are welcomed and
 are of some consultation to the many Americans concerned about the
 future security of Taiwan.
 MAINTENANCE. .OF COMMERCIAL, CULTURAL, AND OTHER RELATIONS WITH
 The bill is intended to assure that the many commercial, cultural,
 and other relations between the United States and Taiwan continue
 as they had prior to the establishment of diplomatic relations with
 the People's Republic of China and that there be no hiatus 'in such
 relations nor' inadequate protection given to such relations by U.S.
 law. Title II of the bill contains provisions which continue the applic-
 ability of U.S. law with respect to Taiwan and continue the validity
 of Taiwan law with respect to the United States. Under the title, provi-
 sion is also made for continuation of relations through a nongovern-

 ?China'mainland, and all -other peoples.of the. Western Pacific area'.
 Second, peace and stability in.the Western Pacific are in the U.S.
 political, security and economic interest, are of international concern,
 and must be maintained.
 Third, continued. extensive; close, and friendly commercial, cultural,
 and other relations between the American people and the people on
 Taiwan must be assured.
 Fourth, the future of Taiwan must be determined,through peace-
 ful means without prejudice to the well-being of the people on. Taiwan.
 Fifth, any armed. attack against. Taiwan, or use of force; boycott,
 or embargo to prevent Taiwan from trading with other nations, would
 -be a threat to the peace and stability of the area and of grave concern
 to the United States.
 TITLE I-PROMOTION OF. SECURITY IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC : PROTECTION
 OF UNITED STATES SECURITY INTERESTS
 Section 101(a) .-This section states that the United States will; make
 available to Taiwan defense articles and services -for ? its defense
 against armed attack. The provision would continue U.S. arms supply
 policy which was in effect under the Mutual Defense- Treaty with- the
 Republic of China prior to the President's notification of intent to
 terminate the treaty. ., .
 Section 101-(b).-This section requires that the President. promptly
 inform Congress of any dangers to U.S. interests arising from any

 threat to the security of Taiwan. Where possible,, the President should
 inform Congress of anticipated dangers. and should not await their
 actual occurrence. Information relevant to this, section would include
 information about development of military capability that, might
 threaten Taiwan, deployment. of armed forces in positions that could
 threaten Taiwan and any perceived intentions to undermine continued
 peace and prosperity on Taiwan. Such information would also in-
 clude information about. actions or anticipated action of an economic
 -nature, such as boycott, or embargo, which also would be a threat to
 Taiwan.
 This section also specifies that in the event such information is
 received, the President and Congress shall determine an appropriate
 response in accordance with Constitutional processes., This. section is
 not intended to, supersede other statutory requirements. In particular,
 all of the provisions of the War . Powers Resolution, including, its
 provisions regarding consultation and reporting, remain fully appli-
 cable with respect to Taiwan.
 ,TITLE II-MAINTENANCE OF COMMERCIAL AND OTHER RELATIONS
 Title II is designed to provide legislative implementation for the
 purpose, as stated in the title. of the bill, of promoting. continued exten-
 sive, close, and friendly relations between the people of the United
 States and the people on Taiwan. Paragraphs (1), (2), and' (3).,. of
 the Declaration of Principles in section. 2', are particularly applicable
 to! this title.
 Seetion 201-Application of United States laws to Taiwan.
 This section deals with U.S. domestic law as it, affects or relates'to
 Taiwan. It is designed to,continue.the application of all U.S. laws, both
 Federal and State, with respect to Taiwan, as if derecognition had not
 occurred. In other words, derecognition is to be legally irrelevant in
 deciding issues involving Taiwan under U.S. law. In particular, this
 section preserves, the rights, and obligations of Taiwan under U.S.
 law.
 Section 201(a) provides that no U.S. legal requirement, explicit or
 implicit, concerning existence of diplomatic relations or governmental
 recognition shallapply with respect to Taiwan. This provision makes
 clear that any legal' requirements for maintenance of diplomatic rela-
 tions with the United States or for recognition of a foreign govern-
 ment-by the United States shall not apply to, or be. a bar to, Taiwan
 participation in activities of any kind under United States law, includ-
 ing government programs. For example, provisions of laws such as
 section 620(t) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.
 2370(t) ), which prohibits U.S. assistance to any country with which
 U.S. diplomatic relations have been severed, will not apply to Taiwan.
 The provision is, also. intended to make inapplicable the requirements
 for diplomatic relations with, or recognition by, the United States
 which might be. implied by terms such as- "friendly country" contained
 in various statutes. One such provision of particular importance is
 section 4A of the Export Administration Act of 1969.which prohibits
 U.S. persons from complying with a foreign boycott directed against
 a friendly country. The bill will ensure that those prohibitions would
 apply with respect to any boycott against Taiwan.

 Section '201('b) ?(1) provides that the absence of diplomatic rela-
 tiousand recognition'shall not. affect the application of U.S. laws with
 respect to'Taiwan, and the laws of the United'States shall apply with
 respect to Taiwan in the manner that the laws of the United States
 applied with respect to Taiwan prior to January 1, 1979. This section
 continues the'application of U.S. laws to Taiwan after January 1, 1979,
 the date of derecognition, inthe mannerthat U.S. laws applied prior
 to that date. This section expressly provides that among the laws
 which shall continue to apply ,are those relating to rights, obligations,
 standing to sue and be 'sued, legal capacity, or eligibility to take part
 in U.S. Government programs and other activities. Accordingly, the
 legal rights and obligations of the Republic of China remain valid
 under i .S. law and are unaffected by derecognition. The rights and
 obligations of corporations and other entities established under the
 laws. of Taiwan are similarly protected. Legal rights assured by this
 section 'include both contract rights and property rights. They include
 rights involving bank'assets and other intangible assets. Obligations.
 which will -remain 'binding under this section include the obligations ?of
 the Republic of 'China with respect to loans and guarantees, 'oblig a-
 tions that will continue unaffected by derecognition. Regarding rights
 and, obligations, the bill is applicable both to those which existed prior
 to January 1, 1979,.the'date of derecoaiiition of the Republic of China
 by the President, and the rights anc obligations which, might arise
 subsequent to that date.
 Tn providing that the U.S. laws will continue to apply with respect
 to Taiwan without regard to the presence of diplomatic relations or
 recognition, this section will also insure that the Republic of China
 will continue to have standing to sue and 'be shed. in U.S. Federal and
 State courts as before. Similarly, the ability to sue and be sued of
 corporations and other entities established under the laws of Taiwan
 remains unchanged. The laws of 'Taiwan will have the same validity
 under U.S. laws as before. For example, marriages performed under
 Taiwan law will continue to be recognized as valid in the United
 States. Likewise, a business contract entered into under Taiwan law
 will continue to be dealt with under U.S. law as before. Judgments
 rendered by the counts of Taiwan will continue to be enforceable in
 U.S. courts.
 Furthermore, derecognition will not affect the applicability, to
 Taiwan of U.S. laws referring to foreign countries, governments,,
 states, nations, and similar entities. Similarly; restrictions applicable
 to communist countries will not apply to Taiwan. Thus Taiwan will
 continue to be eligible under such U.S. laws as the Arms Export. Con-
 trol Act,,'the Atomic Energy Act of 19.54, the Export-ImportB ank
 Act, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, (including its provisions
 authorizing overseas private investment insurance)., the Mutual Edu
 cational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, and the trade laws of the
 United States (including nondiscriminatory trade treatment (most-'
 favored-nation status) and the generalized system of preferences
 (GSP) ). Exports from Taiwan to the United States will not be com-
 bined with those from the People's Republic of 'China in determining
 GSP or orderly marketing agreement limits.
 Because Taiwan continues to be treated as a foreign country, taxes
 imposed by Taiwan will be treated as taxes imposed by a foreign
 H. riept.

 country. Thus, Taiwan real property taxes would generally be deduct.
 ible (Section 164 of the Internal Revenue Code) and income taxes.
 would-be deductible or creditable (Section 33 of the Internal Revenue
 Code) for Federal income tax purposes if the other requirements of
 the Internal Revenue Code are met.
 Moreover, any U.S. source income of the governing authority or,
 Taiwan would be exempt from Federal income taxation to the same
 extent as the income of a foreign government (Section 89.2 of the
 Internal Revenue Code). (The. exemption from tax. for foreign, gov-;
 ernments would, not apply to the people governed,by. that gayernmg,
 authority.) Similarly, employees of the governing. authority.;on Tai-
 wan could qualify-for exemption. from Federal income taxation under.
 the same rules which apply to. employees of a foreign government;
 (Section 893).
 Because section 205 (2) of the bill provides that the term "Taiwan,".
 when used in a geographical sense,. includes the islands of Taiwan and
 the Pescadores, that definition will apply under the provisions of the
 internal revenue laws of the United States which refer to foreign coun-,
 tries in a geographic sense. Thus, for example, residence or presence in
 Taiwan would be treated as residence or presence in a "foreign coun-.
 try" to determine eligibility for the deduction for excess foreign living.
 costs (Section 913 of the Internal Revenue Code).
 This section of the bill does not "freeze" the application of U.S. law
 with respect to Taiwan. It affects application of future laws as well
 as existing laws. Likewise, this section does not affect the future resolu-
 tion of; legal issues 'based on changed circumstances; it simply makes
 the fact of Aerecognition irrelevant,to the resolution of those issues.
 For example, under this section .the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
 will-be able to make the required findings and determinations under the
 Atomic Energy Act of 1954 in order to permit continued nuclear ex-
 ports to Taiwan, and derecognition will not constitute a basis for not
 making those findings and determinations. At the same time, nothing in
 this bill will prevent the Commission from taking into account sub-
 sequent changes in circumstances in its application of the statutory
 criteria in particular cases.
 Section 201 (b) (2) creates a specific exception to continue unchanged
 application of U.S. laws with respect to Taiwan. This exception is
 made for the first sentence of section 202(b) of the Immigration and
 Nationality Act of June 27, 1952. The exception makes it possible for
 Taiwan to be granted a U.S. immigration quota of 20,000 annually,
 rather than sharing such a quota with the People's Republic of China
 as has been the case in the past.
 Section 201('b) (3) provides that pursuant to section 201(-b) (1)
 above, dealing with the continued unchanged application of U.S. laws
 with respect to Taiwan, all interests in real or intangible property ac-
 quired by the Republic of China prior to January 1, 1979, shall not be,
 affected by U.S. recognition 'of the People's Republic of China. Claims
 of the People's Republic of China will not affect property rights or
 assets of the Republic of China in the United 'States. This section
 applies to real- property used for diplomatic purposes as well as all
 other property owned by the Republic of China before derecognition.
 Section 201(c) is designed to make clear that all treaties and other
 greements between the United States and the Republic
 international 'agreements-

 of China; which wem in force before derecognition will continue to be
 in force. For gxample, the U.S.-ROC Treaty of Friendship, Commerce
 and Navigation, which provides a legal.foundation for commercial re-
 lations.between, the United States and Taiwan, will continue without
 interruption. No United States-Republic of China treaty or interna-
 tional agreement would be terminated' except that which is terminated
 under its terms or otherwise, pursuant to U.S. law.
 The President has given notice of termination of the United States-
 Republic of China Mutual Defense Treaty under terms of the treaty.
 However, this provision is not intended to deal with that issue. It is
 intended to confirm as a matter of U.S. law the President's statement
 of December 30, 1978, that all other treaties and agreements then in
 force.shall continue in force.
 Section 202-Maintenance of relations
 This section provides the modalities under which dealings between
 the United States Government and the authorities on Taiwan shall be
 conducted. Nothing in this bill requires that dealings by private parties
 be conducted through the entities described below.
 Section 202 (a) (1) provides that U.S. Government dealings with
 Taiwan shall be by or through a nongovernmental entity to be desig-
 nated by the President after consultation with Taiwan. The Executive
 branch has indicated its intention to use, for this purpose the "Amen-
 can Institute in Taiwan," a nonprofit corporation incorporated -under
 the laws of the District of Columbia. The committee would have pre-
 ferred an entity with a name such as a "Commission," because of the
 Committee's desire to continue United States-Taiwan relations on as
 close to a government-to-government basis as possible. The language
 of this section, by not naming the designated entity, leaves flexibility
 for the choice of an entity other than, or with a name other than,
 "American Institute in Taiwan."
 Section 202 (a) (2) provides that Taiwan dealings with the'United
 States shall be by or through a similar instrumentality established by
 Taiwan in agreement with the President for dealings with the United
 States. The Taiwan entity must hold whatever authority is necessary
 under Taiwan laws to act on Taiwan's behalf. It must be able to provide
 assurances as may be required of foreign governments by such U.S.
 laws as the statute governing exports of nuclear materials. In general,
 stipulations in U.S. laws for dealing with a "foreign government" will
 be satisfied, with respect to Taiwan, by dealing with this instrumen-
 tality. The authorities on Taiwan have established a Coordination
 Committee for North American Affairs as a nongovernmental entity to
 act on Taiwan's behalf in this regard.
 Under the exception clause prefacing section 202(a), the President
 is given broad power to provide for dealings between the United States
 Government and the authorities on Taiwan without use of the desig=
 nated entities. Thus he is not precluded by this bill from dealing on a
 government-to=government basis generally, or in specific instances, if
 he so chooses. Also, the provision for existence of the two entities is not
 intended as a requirement that they be the exclusive channel for deal-
 ings between the' U.S. Government and private persons on Taiwan.
 For example, the U.S. Export-Import Bank will be able to continue
 activities on Taiwan, as it has in the past, without going through either
 of the new entities.

 Under this legislation, existing provisions of law concerning report-
 ing to Congress and Congressional review in relation to international
 agreements and other transactions continue to apply to agreements and
 transactions made by or on behalf of the United States Government in
 relation to Taiwan. For example, agreements entered into by the desig-
 nated entity with the Taiwan instrumentality will be subject to the
 reporting requirements of the Case-Zablocki Act (1 U.S.C. 112b) and
 other applicable, congressional review provisions, such as section 123
 of the Atomic Energy Act. Statutory procedures applicable to other
 types of transactions such as various provisions of the Nuclear Non-
 Proliferation Act of 1978 and the Arms Export Control Act, continue
 to apply.
 Section 202 (b) is intended to provide the U.S. designated entity with
 .all attributes necessary to function in the absence of a diplomatic mis-
 :sion in Taipei. Under Section 202(b) (1) U.S. laws applying to U.S.
 `Government agencies shall apply to the designated entity, to the extent
 the President may specify, as if it were an agency of the U.S. Gov-
 'ernment. For example, under this provision the designated entity may
 be audited by the General Accounting Office and would not be subject
 to antitrust action.
 Also, the designated entity, its property, and its income could be ex-
 -empted from all taxation imposed by the United States or by any
 State or local taxing authority of the United States. The only excep-
 tion to this rule would befor Social Security taxes of certain employees
 of the designated entity, as discussed below. In addition, contributions
 to or for the use of the designated entity could qualify (within the
 limits otherwise applicable) as deductions for Federal income, estate,
 and gift tax purposes.
 If the designated entity is treated as a Federal agency for social
 security purposes, the designated entity and its employees generally
 will not be subject to social security (FICA) taxes and service for
 the designated entity generally will not earn its employees quarters of
 coverage toward qualification for social security benefits. However,
 under section 203 (a) (3) of the bill, employees of the designated en-
 tity who have been separated from Federal service are entitled to con-
 tinue to participate in any benefit program in which they were covered
 prior to employment by the designated entity. This includes the So-
 cial Security program. Thus, in the event that an employee of the
 designated entity was covered by Social Security in his Federal em-
 ployment immediately prior to separation, he will continue while em-
 ployed by the designated entity. In that situation, both the designated
 entity and the employee will be subject, to FICA taxes on wages paid
 by the designated entity, and his service for the designated entity will
 be covered employment under title II of the Social Security Act. Treat-
 ment of the designated entity as a Federal agency would not prevent
 its former employees from using their service for the designated en-
 tity toward qualification for coverage under State unemployment
 compensation programs. This coverage would be pursuant to the right
 of employees of the designated entity separated from Federal service
 to continue to participate in two benefit programs, Unemployment
 Compensation for Federal Civilian Employees and Unemployment
 Compensation for Ex-Servicemen. The designated entity would not
 be subject to taxation under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act
 (FUTA).

 Under Section 202(b) (2) any U.S. Government agency may sell,
 loan, or lease property to and perform support functions and serv-
 ices for the designated entity as the President may direct. Reimburse-
 ments to the agencies under this subsection shall be credited to the
 current applicable appropriation of the agency concerned.
 Under Section 202(b) (3) any U.S. Government agency may acquire
 and accept services from the designated entity on such terms and con-
 ditions as the President directs, notwithstanding laws and regulations
 normally applicable to federal procurement.
 Section 202(c) authorizes the granting of privileges and'immuni-'
 ties for the Taiwan instrumentality, including both property and per-
 sonnel, to the extent needed for it to carry out its functions in the
 United States. The granting of such privileges and immunities is con-
 ditioned on comparable privileges and immunities being accorded by
 Taiwan to the U.S. designated entity and its personnel. It is the Com-
 mittee's expectation that the President will accord extensive priv-
 ileges and immunities to the Taiwan instrumentality on a reciprocal
 basis,: including secure pouch comnnuiications, inviolability of 'prem-
 ises, exemption from property and income taxes, exemption from
 foreign agent registration requirements, and immunity of personnel
 with respect to the performance of their functions.
 Section 203-Separation of Government personnel for employment
 with the designated entity
 Section 203(a) (1) provides that a federal officer or employee who.
 accepts employment with the Institute may be separated from his-or-
 her agency.
 Section 203 (a) (2) provides that any officer or employee so sep-.
 arated is entitled, upon termination of employment with the desig-
 nated entity, to be reemployed or reinstated in the Federal service..
 Normally, reemployment for an employee in the classified service will
 be to the position from which the employee was separated. However;.
 the President is authorized to determine the appropriateness of the
 position for reemployment. It is anticipated that, especially in per-
 sonnel systems based on the rank in person concept, reemployment
 could be in a higher class.
 Section 203(a) (3) provides for continuity-of federal benefits during
 service with the designated entity, including compensation .for job-
 related death, illness, or injury; health and life insurance, leave, and
 retirement., Contributions, where required, must be paid in order to
 preserve these benefits. This section also provides that death or re-
 tirement by a federal employee separated under. subsection. (a) while
 employed by the designated entity shall be considered a death in or
 retirement from the Federal service for purposes of benefit entitlement..
 The provision for continuation of eligibility to participate in Fed-
 eral benefit programs is intended to permit the affected individuals to,
 retain the opportunities they would have as Federal employees to elect
 changes in those benefits, as in the case of "open season" for changes.
 in health insurance coverage.
 Section 203 (a) (4) authorizes the extension of the benefits of, this
 section of the bill to Federal employees serving with the designated?
 entity on leave without pay prior to the bill's enactment.

 Section. 203 (b) . authorizes the transfer to the designated entity of
 alien employees of the U.S. Government, and preserves their benefits
 under the local compensation plan applicable; in Taiwan under sec-
 tion 444 of the Foreign Service Act of 1946 (22 U.S.C. 889). It is ex-
 pected that the designated entity will adopt this 'plan for its alien
 employees. This section also authorizes the continued participation in
 U.S. Government retirement systems by those transferred alien em-
 ployees who have heretofore been covered by such systems, subject to
 continued payment of contributions and deductions to the appropriate
 fund.-
 . Section 203 (c) stipulates that employees of the designated entity
 shall not be U.S. Government employees and, in representing the des-
 ignated entity. shall be exempt from section 207 of title 18, United
 States Code, which otherwise would prohibit employees. of the entity
 from dealing with their former agencies, in representing the entity.
 Section 203(d) provides that the salaries and allowances paid to
 employees of the designated entity are to be treated the same way for
 tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as salaries and
 equivalent allowances paid by, agencies of the U.S. Government. Thus,
 employees of the designated entity will be exempt from tax on over-
 seas allowances and benefits they receive which, are equivalent to the
 tax-exempt overseas allowances and benefits received by civilian officers
 and employees of the U.S. Government (under section 912 of the
 Internal Revenue Code). As ' a corollary, compensation paid to em-
 ployees by the designated entity will not be "earned income" qualify-
 ing them for the deduction or exclusion provided to individuals
 working in the private' sector (under sections 911; and 913 of the
 Internal Revenue Code).
 The 'Committee on Post Office and Civil 'Service has advised the
 Foreign Affairs Committee that, from the standpoint of its. jurisdic-
 tion over the Civil Service, it has no objection to consideration of this
 section of H.R. 2479. The exchange of letters between Chairman Za-

 DEAR MR. , CHAIRMAN : I am writing with reference to H.R. 2479,
 the United States-Taiwan Relations Act, which was ordered favorably
 reported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs on February 28, 1979.
 In. order to maintain relations with Taiwan to the maximum extent
 possible on a nongovernmental basis in view of the President's action
 in shifting U.S. governmental recognition to Peking, the bill author-
 izes the creation of a nongovernmental entity to conduct dealings of
 the United States Government with Taiwan. Section 203 of the bill
 provides authority for the President to separate from the Government
 any officer or employee'who accepts employment with the new entity
 without advantage or disadvantage to such officer or, employee's rights,
 privileges, and benefits as a government, employee. ' Section 203 will
 affect, for the most-part, Foreign Service officers and.employees. The
 bill does not create a new class of Federal employees nor does it change
 in any way the rights, privileges, and benefits now available to such
 employees.

 ters, the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service could request se-

 U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR CLEM : Thank you for your letter of March 1, 1979, concerning
 certain provisions of H.R. 2479 ("United States-Taiwan Relations
 Act") which pertain to matters within the jurisdiction of this
 'Committee.
 Under section 203 of the bill, any employee of a Federal agency may
 be separated from Government service for a specified period for the
 purpose of accepting employment with the nongovernmental entity
 established under the bill to conduct dealings of the United States
 Government with Taiwan. An employee who is so separated is entitled
 to be reemployed by his former agency in an appropriate position
 without loss of rights or benefits. While employed with the new entity,
 the employee may continue to participate in any employee benefit
 program, such as retirement, life insurance and health insurance pro-
 grams, but only to the extent that the appropriate employee and em-
 ployer contributions to the programs are made.
 As you pointed out in your letter, our Committee could request the
 Speaker to sequentially refer H.R. 2479 to this Committee for the pur-
 pose of considering those provisions which pertain to matters under
 our jurisdiction. However, I understand that expeditious consideration
 of this legislation is necessary to ensure uninterrupted relations be-
 tween the United States and Taiwan and that consideration of the
 measure by the House has ? been scheduled for next week. In view of
 these facts, our Committee will interpose no objection to consideration
 of H.R. 2479, provided that such action is not construed as relinquish-
 ment of jurisdiction over the employees to whom section 203 of, the
 bill applies.
 I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter in your Committee's
 Sincerely yours,
 report on H.R. 2479.
 With kind regards.
 Sincerely,
 JAMES M. HANLEY, Chairman.

 ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF THE HONORABLE WILLIAM
 S. BROOMFIELD
 I would like to commend my good friend, the distinguished Chair-
 man of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Clement J. Zablocki, for
 his leadership, in developing H.R. 2479. This bill reflects the deep
 concern for the security needs and economic freedom of the people on
 Taiwan, as well as the national security interests of the United States
 in the Western Pacific. Under his leadership, the legislation drafted
 by the Committee remedies many of the deficiencies of the Adminis-
 tration's original.legislative request.
 In particular, H.R. 2479 strengthens the Administration's legisla-
 tion in relation to the legislative provisions concerning threats to the
 security of Taiwan. In this regard, I personally offered an amend-
 ment, which received broad bipartisan support, stating that beyond
 an armed attack, any economic boycott or embargo to prevent Taiwan
 from engaging in trade with other nations would also be a threat to the
 security of Taiwan. Other distinguished Members of our Committee
 were constructive in strengthening the Administration's legislation
 by providing language to better protect America's commercial inter-
 ests on Taiwan as well as the embassy property of the Republic of
 China.
 I have never questioned the right of the Administration to normalize
 relations with the People's Republic of China. What I do question,
 however, is the Administration's specific arrangements-or lack there-
 of-in normalizing relations including the lack of consultation with
 the Congress and with our ally, Taiwan. Moreover, the Administration
 not only failed to consult the Congress in relation to the specific nor-
 malization arrangement but also in relation to proposed changes
 affecting the continuation of the Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan,
 a consultative procedure called for by Section 26(b) of the P.L.
 95-384, the International Security Assistance Act of 1978.
 I am also deeply concerned about the kinds of signals which the
 Administration has been sending to our friends and allies abroad. In
 particular, the Administration, which has always made human rights
 the keystone of its foreign policy, has abandoned the diplomatic recog-
 nition of more than 17 million people and formally recognized an
 oppressive Communist dictatorship. Moreover, because of the way in
 which the Administration treated an ally I am very much concerned
 over the reactions of other countries-small and large-with whom we
 have mutual security interests. In particular, I am deeply disturbed
 over recent events in Southeast Asia which could complicate the Ad-
 ministration's announcement that the United States will make no new
 arms sales agreements in 1979 with Taiwan, an ally which has been
 totally dependent on the United States for its defense equipment.
 In conclusion, I believe that the Committee on Foreign Affairs-and
 its staff-have developed a bill which is a significant improvement
 over the Administration's request. In light of these legislative im-
 provements, I urge my colleagues to favorably consider H.R. 2479.
 WM. BROOMFIELD.

 ADDITIONAL VIEWS ON H.R. 2479.
 The Administration has played its China Card but without the
 positive effects it hoped for either at home or abroad. The Adminis-
 tration seems to have under-estimated the lack of enthusiam-indeed
 resentment-in the Congress and the country at large for its treatment
 of the Republic of China. Teng Hsiao-ping's deftly managed trip to
 the United States cleverly drew the Administration, albeit unwill-
 innly, into China's dispute with the USSR. Also in allowing itself
 tote associated with Teng's calls for united action against "hegemon-
 ism," the Administration seems to have forgotten that only a short
 time ago the People's Republic of China (PRC) was condemning !both
 the USSR and the 'U.'  for the same offense. The constitution of the
 PRC approved unanimously on August 18, 1977, only a year and a half
 ago, stresses China's opposition to "the hegemonism of the two super-
 powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, to overthrow impe-
 rialism, modern revisionism and all reaction." (The constitution also
 calls for the "liberation" of Taiwan.)
 This bill reflects the strong sentiment in the Congress that the Presi-
 dent should have consulted with the Congress, in compliance with the
 law, before taking such a controversial foreign policy step as he has.
 ?        It also demonstrates the strong desire to undo as much of the Admin-
 istration's -damage as possible in this legislative vehicle. It goes a long
 way to improve a poor situation.
 We understand that recognition doesn't mean approval of a par-
 ticular form of government. But what troubles us, in addition to its
 lack of caution, is the Administration's excessive pretense that nor-
 malization is 'anything more than it actually is. Despite all' the hoopla
 and claims to the contrary, normalization of relations with the PRC
 is not the greatest event since Georgia statehood.
 Given the circumstances with which .the Administration has pre-
 sented us, we cannot be certain that even the efforts of this bill suffi-
 ciently protects Taiwan from attempts by the PRC to strangle her
 economically. There have already been reports that American firms
 have been told by Peking that they must stop trading with Taiwan to
 be able to trade with the Mainland. We must resolve here to act to
 thwart 'Chinese Communist trade, embargoes and secondary boycotts
 against Taiwan. We must uphold our laws and take the timely and
 effective action required to protect Taiwan's flourishing economy.
 To abandon a free society of more than 17 million persons to one of
 the most oppressive dictatorships of all time, would be a human rights
 disaster. The People's Republic of China has one of the worst human
 rights records in history and if, as the President has said, "human
 rights is the soul of our foreign policy," not much could be said for our
 national soul, if we were to let that happen. No one says the Adminis-
 tration seeks that end, only that it has been careless in its machinations
 and hasty in implementing its ill-conceived decisions.

 We strongly believe that the flow of material in the defense pipeline
 to Taiwan should not be interrupted. Our supply of weapons to Tai-
 wan should be based on the latter's own assessment of its defensive
 needs and should not be influenced by negative Administration atti-
 tudes reflecting PRC views.
 There are many unanswered questions about the way our new ar-
 rangement with Taiwan will be handled. Since the Republic of China
 does not exist anymore in the new Carter Administration and Taiwan
 is only a province of the PRC we will not be dealing directly with a
 government but through unofficial institutions with-as the Adminis=
 tration insists-"the people on Taiwan." To use the administration's'
 pet term "the reality of the situation is that there are two Chinese
 states.
 Administration witnesses before the Foreign Affairs Committee
 stressed the absolute need that our future representation in Taipei be
 unofficial in nature. They said the American Foreign Service personnel;,
 temporarily on duty as non-official diplomats in Taiwan, would not be
 representing the United States government in their dealings with the
 "people on Taiwan," as they are pleased, to put it. Does this mean that
 our unofficial officials will accost individuals on the streets and by-ways,
 of Taiwan asking to be of service to. them ? It will be interesting to
 watch their progress. A commercial non-officer, for example, (or per_
 hags a non-commercial officer) will leave the American unofficial insti-
 tute established by our government for these non-governmental 'con-
 nections. He will approach the first person he sees to discuss a purchase
 by Taiwan of American electrical machinery, let's say, "I would like
 to talk about the deal," the local will say, "but I'm not sure you exist."
 Through the Looking Glass provides the most apt model for this Ad-
 ministration, dream.
 This bill, fortunately, preserves for the Republic of China its em-
 bassy property of Twin Oaks in Washington. Largely symbolic, this
 provision is, nonetheless, important. Congressman Lagomarsino's
 amendment, adopted in the full Committee, provides that in this case
 the property of the Republic of China-including its real property=
 its embassy, remains in its possession.
 There remains a nagging suspicion that there are still secret agree-
 ments in this. affair since details of both the Panama Canal treaty and
 the Camp David accords somehow failed to surface immediately. In
 those cases too the Administration claimed that everything had been
 made public only to provide some errant detail later. In the case of
 US/PRC normalization, only sometime after the President's announce-
 ment did an important aspect of the agreement work its way to the
 surface. We had forgotten to mention, it seems, that we had agreed
 with the PRC not to allow any Free China purchases of arms during
 the remaining years of our Mutual Defense' treaty. 'Were there any
 other lapses of memory?
 There will be further perfecting amendments to this bill offered on
 the Floor.

 ADDITIONAL VIEWS OF THE HONORABLE ROBERT J.
 LAGOMARSINO ON H.R. 2479
 The new China policy of the United States, which was proudly pro-
 claimed by President Carter on December 15,1978, clearly has a serious
 effect upon the parties which were directly affected by the recognition
 of the People's Republic of China (PRC), and upon the United States
 foreign policy toward the .rest of the world. The Administration's leg-
 islative, proposal (H.R. 1614) concerning this development reflected
 the naivete of this Administration's view of Congress and the world.
 The new legislation (toward which these comments are specifically
 directed) is still an inadequate statement of proper American policy,
 but it is certainly a substantial improvement over the initial executive
 proposal.
 Although Congress is constitutionally prohibited from determining
 which countries this nation recognizes, it clearly possesses a number of
 ways in which it can offer its suggestions and directives to the executive
 branch: One of those areas which is of great concern to me and to many
 of the Taiwanese who are directly affected by the President's action,
 concerns the disposition of the Taiwanese Embassy in Washington,
 D.C. Because of the. concerns that the Embassy not be permitted-as
 the Carter Administration has advocated-to be relinquished to the
 People's Republic of China, I offered an amendment permitting the
 Taiwanese government to maintain its interest in that Embassy. Two
 reasons, discussed below, prompted me to. introduce the amendment
 which was inserted in the legislation reported to the House.
 My. first concern was that in allowing the Taiwanese to maintain
 ownership. of their Embassy, Congress can demonstrate that Taiwan
 still has allies in the United States, despite President Carter's dis-
 courteous behavior toward the Taiwanese diplomats. The affirmation
 of the Taiwanese ownership of the Twin Oaks Embassy is a clear
 congressional signal to Taiwan, and other U.S. allies, that the United
 States is still extremely interested in the safety and.protection of
 Taiwan.
 A second reason to maintain Taiwanese interest in the Washington,
 D.C. Embassy involves the actual occupation of the building by the
 new PRC officials. By disallowing the Carter/PRC intention to occupy
 the former Taiwanese premises, Congress is underscoring its under-
 standing that there is absolutely no continuity between the policies of
 Taiwan and those of, the PRC. Essentially, it is an affirmation that the
 occupation should not be regarded as a continuation of relations, as
 some might conclude when observing the,PRC in the old Taiwanese
 offices.
 Another amendment which I introduced relates to the possibility of
 an eventual embargo and/or attack on Taiwan by the PRC. Although
 administration officials have insisted that these "unlikely" events
 should not concern Congress, the recent PRC invasion of Vietnam
 (21)
 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050016-5
 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050016-5
 raises serious questions about this possibility. Although the Commit-
 tee rejected this amendment, I support it for two important reasons
 which I still believe are pertinent to our new relationship with the
 PRC.
 The first concerns the emphasis upon the fact that U.S. recognition
 of the PRC should not be construed as an irreversible process. By in-
 dicating to the PRC that such hostile action would, at the very least,
 mandate that the President consider "derecognition," it would prop-
 erly demonstrate the- legitimate U.S. concern about the attitude toward
 reunification.' of the PRC. It would effectively serve to remind the PRC,'
 that;the.U.S. is extremely interested in reminding the PRC'that such.
 actions would have a serious impact upon our relations with them and
 with Taiwan.
 The United States has withdrawn recognition from various nations
 in the past to demonstrate our disapproval of certain action ; in light,
 of the new southeast Asian. hostilities the proposed language .would
 be particularly applicable.
 A second concern which I have relates to comments made by some
 of my colleagues that "derecognition" would be the minimum in the
 list of U.S. responses to hostile ,PRC actions. Although I share the
 hope that the, U.S..react with a positive response in the event that Tai-
 wan were invaded by the PRC, the experience -of watching the reaction
 of this administration to a number of foreign policy developments
 does not suggest that we would have the hoped-for result. .
 The amendment certainly. would. not limit the options. available to?
 the U.S. response in this scenario. It is simply another indication of
 the concern for the safety and protection of Taiwan.
 I would like to join with several of. my colleagues who have ex-
 pressed their opposition to the manner in which the recognition process
 was managed by the President. Carter's failure to consult with Coro-.
 gress again demonstrates the view which the Executive branch has of
 Congress. It is no wonder that the President continues this policy in
 light of the feeble response of many Members to pass legislation to
 demonstrate the outrage over the presidential attitude toward Congress.
 Another. concern which I have involves President Carter's referral
 to both Presidents Nixon and Ford in his December 15 statement of
 recognition. Although the President was attempting to demonstrate,
 that he was continuing a process which these two Republican Presi-
 dents had initiated, he neglected to mention that both Nixon and Ford
 were extremely concerned that the interests of Taiwan be protected.
 Either of those Presidents could have obtained recognition on the terms
 Carter has, but did not because of the paramount concern for Taiwan's
 safety. All of their efforts in Taiwan's behalf, however, have been lost.
 by a President who did not even ask for a "no force" agreement on
 Taiwan.
 Finally, I would like to directly address the issue concerning the
 military defense of Taiwan. The defense' of that island and the others
 which are part of the Republic of China is primarily dependent, upon.
 deterrence, which in the past has been directly attributable-to United
 States interests in. that part of the world. Without our specific inter-,
 ests, the effect of deterrence is lost, and increases the likelihood of for-
 eign pressures on Taiwan. For this reason, I supported the Quayle

 amendment in the Committee hearings which would have inserted lan-
 guage in the bill which spoke to the United States "security interests,"
 in Taiwan.
 Few would dispute the fact that the U.S. commitment to Taiwan has
 been the cornerstone of that country's defense for the past thirty years.
 Congress can contribute to this defense of Taiwan, and of the other
 friendly Asian regimes, if it inserts language in the legislation which
 more properly reflects our interest in the safety and autonomy of those
 countries.

 ADDITIONAL  VIEWS  OF  REPRESENTATIVE  DAN
 QUAYLE, INDIANA,, ON H.R. 2479, DEALING WITH THE
 MAINTENANCE OF U.S. COMMERCIAL,' CULTURAL,
 AND OTHER RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN
 For the past 30 years the United States has recognized and main-
 tained full diplomatic relations with a government on Taiwan and
 its 17 million citizens. Suddenly, and with little notice, a. decision was
 made by the President of the, United States in concert with the gov-
 'erument of the People's Republic of China that a government does not
 exist .on Taiwan. This is not a realistic approach for a responsible
 American foreign policy, and, in fact, smacks of hypocrisy.
 We have had a liaison office for nearly seven years with. the People's
 Republic of China, and we. maintained full diplomatic relations with
 Taiwan. Since our government now has established. full diplomatic
 relations with the PRO, it is only common sense that, we reverse the
 situation and have at least a liaison office with Taiwan. A liaison office
 is less than full diplomatic recognition.
 Regretfully the committee. bill 'remains silent on this vital point
 regarding our, continued relations with our friends in Taiwan: While
 the bill is improved over the Administration draft proposal, I am op-
 posed to the retreat: to unofficial, nongovernmental relations with Tai-
 wan. We. should recognize'the realities of the situation.
 First, we can not.'justify nonrecognition of Taiwan anymore than
 we could the nonrecognition of the PRC. Both are functioning and
 viable governments with whom the United Staten wishes to carry on
 important trade and cultural relations. We do not. have the right to
 cede, Taiwan to, the PRC', but do have a responsibility to maintain
 strong relations' with Taiwan along with the normalization of relations
 with the PRC.
 Secondly, we will be engaging in a game of political charades in
 the very nature of the proposed nongovernmental instrumentality,
 .which was labelled by the Administration as an. Institute. Its func-
 tions will be those of a liaison office-the primary difference' being its
 lack of official status. In fact, it will be staffed by State Department
 personnel who will be "temporarily separated" for the, purpose of
 maintaining this charade.
 I do not believe the U.S. Government, whose current international
 status is, shaky at best, should be openly playing such games. The
 entity will function as a liaison office and should bear its just title and
 recognition.
 If the Administration refuses-to: deal honestly with the government
 of Taiwan, then-the Congress must. There are strong arguments for
 the maintenance of government-to-government relations with Taiwan
 in the form., of a liaison office.
 ?? 1. Taiwan has. a viable,government which has been in power for
 over 30 years. It has jurisdiction over 17 million people. The country
 is economically viable and ranks in the top ten of our trading partners.

 Approved For Release 2008/10/27: CIA-RDP85-00003R000100050016-5
 W
 We recognize the need to continue our trade with Taiwan, to guaran-
 tee the security of the people and the islands, to continue in force all
 other treaties with Taiwan, and yet this legislation attempts to put in
 question the legitimacy of Taiwan and its governing authority.
 2. There is no, reason why the establishment of a liaison office. in Tai-
 wan,, with. a corresponding Taiwanese office in Washington, should
 undermine our relations with the People's Republic of China. We were
 able to' conduct a. similar relationship with the PRC for nearly 7 years
 withoutterminating our relationship with Taiwan.
 3. For the United States to remove the security umbrella provided
 by. our formal: relationships and Mutual Security Treaty; we. are,. in
 .effect, cutting Taiwan diplomatically ' adrift.. Once allied, to and
 recognized by the strongest . economic and military power on earth,
 Taiwan will now become a political outcast. This separation from the
 political mainstream of the rest of the world can hardly be reassuring
 to other nations planning investments or other forms of long-term
 dealings with Taiwan.
 4. In the absence of some form of official relations between Taiwan
 and the United States it will prove difficult for the U.S. to legally
 come to Taiwan's aid in the event of an attack or blockade by the
 PRC. Having recognized Peking as the sole legitimate Chinese' Gov-
 ernment. U.S..aid to Taiwan in those circumstances would amount
 to interference in China's internal affairs, ' Taiwan being no more
 (by our admission) than a 'rebellious Chinese province. Should the
 United States decide to limit its 'ties to Taiwan to a corporate frame-
 work, the 'resulting political isolation of Taiwan will constitute a
 standing invitation to eventual mainland aggression.
 The establishment of a liaison office in Taiwan need not, and should
 not, undermine the normalization process. President Carter could ad-
 vise Vice Premier Tenng that Congress- wholeheartedly endorses nor-
 malization and that trade agreements and other necessary negotiations
 will be dealt with expeditiously.' However, the. Legislative Branch,
 -which is elected by the people of the United States and is a partner
 in the implementation of foreign policy, does not endorse, and can
 not accept, the nonrecognition of Taiwan. We, therefore, insist on the
 maintenance of government-to-government relations with Taiwan as
 one of the U.S. conditions for normalization.
 It can be made clear that, we do not seek `full diplomatic standing
 for Taiwan-but feel that it is entitled- under American standards to
 a similar relationship of liaison status which was enjoyed previously
 by the PRC.
 While the President has stated that he would veto any legislation
 which would differ with'his secretly-concluded agreements with the
 People's Republic of China. the Congress surely has a responsibility
 to place its imprint on any foreign agreements reached- by the Execu-
 tive Branch.
 Mr. Carter;'on December 1:5,1978; played what was described as his
 "China card;" without promised consultation with the Congress. The
 general consensus in both the House and the Senate is that the Presi-
 dent's proposed legislation and the terms of his agreement with the
 PRC are inadequate to protect U:S'. interests in Taiwan and to honor
 'our' long-standing commitment to Taiwan.

 It is now time for Congress to play the American card and assure
 ,government-to-government relations with Taiwan as we move into a
 new period of relations with the People's Republic of China.
 In recent years, we have heard much about the need for "honesty
 in government." America's credibility and standing in the world now,
 .depend on its "honesty in foreign policy."
