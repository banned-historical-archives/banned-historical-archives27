 FAR EAST
 Both Saigon and Hanoi issued major pronounce-
 ments setting forth their positions on negotiations
 and a political settlement of the war.   At the Guam
 meeting with President Johnson, Premier Ky took a
 militant line against any negotiations with the Viet
 Cong and against a coalition government.
 Hanoi reacted to the Guam conference by pub-
 lishing an exchange of letters in February between
 President Johnson and Ho Chi Minh in which Ho re-
 jected the President's proposal for steps leading
 to private talks and reiterated Hanoi's insistence
 on an unconditional cessation of US bombing and
 "other acts of war" against North Vietnam.
 On the eve of the Guam meeting, Premier Ky and
 Chief of State Thieu secured the ruling Directorate':.
 acceptance of the Constituent Assembly's draft con-
 stitution--reportedly over the objections of several
 prominent leaders who voiced concern over the "ex-
 cessive" powers accorded the legislature.
 In Communist China,  efforts to restore order
 and competing drives for power point to new tension
 and discord.   A high-level meeting of party members
 may have been called to work out key policy ques-
 tions connected with the organization of the coun-
 try's administrative machinery.   In the current atmo-
 sphere of dissension,  any such meeting would be a
 stormy one.   Although Premier Chou En-lai still
 speaks for the regime and espouses a relatively mod-
 erate line,  daily parades organized by the Red Guard:
 in the capital denounce some of his close associates.
 The army has increasingly become Peking's main agent
 for transmitting its policies to the    ovinces.

 VIETNAM
 The Communists continued
 to put heavy military pressure
 on allied positions near the De-
 militarized Zone  (DMZ)  this week,
 and additional indications ap-
 peared that enemy forces in the
 area have been substantially
 augmented.
 Mortar and artillery at-
 tacks were again conducted
 against US heavy artillery posi-
 tions at Gio Linh and the South
 Vietnamese army encampment at
 Con Thien, while a US supply
 convoy south of Gio Linh was
 ambushed by enemy infantry.   Ele-
 ments of at least four North
 Vietnamese Army  (NVA)  regiments
 have recently been identified
 south of the DMZ.  Reports
 of defectors  indicate  that the
 Communists are in a position to
 attack in multibattalion strength.
 The current activity re-
 flects an effort to neutralize
 the American heavy artillery
 which began firing into the DMZ
 and southern North Vietnam late
 in February.   The Communists
 may also hope to deter US reac-
 tion to the reported infiltra-
 tion of North Vietnamese units
 from the DMZ and Laos into the
 mountainous western regions of
 Quang Tri Province.
 Fighting also flared up
 heavily closer to Saigon on 20
 and 21 March when two regimental-
 size attacks were directec
 against US forces from Operation
 JUNCTION CITY which has been
 combing Communist War Zone  "C"
 in Tay Ninh Province.   In these
 assaults,  the Communists appar-
 ently abandoned their usually
 cautious tactics,  reportecly
 sending waves of infantry across
 relatively open ground against
 US units equipped with  heavy
 fire power;  they may have been
 seeking a spectacular victory
 to coincide with the Guam talks
 between US and South Vietnamese
 leaders.   More than 850 enemy
 soldiers were killed--raising
 the total killed during JUNCTION
 CITY to nearly 1,800,  the high-
 est   of any single operation of
 the war.
 The Communist attacks could
 also have been provoked by  the
 approach of allied forces to
 sensitive enemy headquarters
 or storage depots.   The area of
 operations for JUNCTION CITY,
 recently shifted eastward,  now
 extends into Binh Long anc Binh
 Duong provinces where elements
 of the 272nd and 273rd Viet Cong
 Regiments and some other units
 subordinate to the Communists'
 Central Office for South Vietnam
 evidently relocated while the
 allied forces were concentrated
 north of Tay Ninh city.

 constitution and the ruling Mili-
 tary Directorate's speedy ac-
 ceptance of the document without
 changes late last week were
 largely the result of the mili-
 tary leaders'  desire to exhibit
 major accomplishments at'the
 Guam Conference.
 Although the full constitu-
 tion is in many important in-
 stances a compromise between the
 Directorate and the assembly,
 the Directorate granted most of
 the final concessions.   On 14
 March,  the Directorate had pro-
 posed a number of changes con-
 cerning the election of province
 chiefs the right of the legis-
 lature to vote no-confidence in
 the government,  and transitional
 arrangements between promulga-
 tion of the constitution and.
 the holding of national elec-
 tions.
 In a meeting with a large
 number of assemblymen on 16 March,
 however, Premier Ky agreed to
 compromise   on transitional pro-
 visions and to ignore Directorate
 suggestions on other issues.
 The assembly then voted its
 final approval of the-document
 on 18 March.   In a stormy meet-
 i_ng the next day,  the Director-
 ate accepted the constitution
 without changes, but not with-
 out expressing dissatisfaction
 with some provisions.   However,
 the objections of both military
 and civilian members apparently
 were finally overcome by the
 pressure of the Guam Conference
 which began on the 20th.
 Before the constitution is
 promulgated,  it must be approved
 by the Armed Forces Congress,
 but indications are that its
 deliberations on this matter will
 be strictly pro forma.
 As the constitution now
 stands,  the Constituent Assembly
 will remain in existence until
 a lower legislative house is
 elected and assumes office.   Un-
 til the future president takes
 office,  it will ratify treaties
 and exercise legislative powers
 regarding electoral laws,  the  .
 formation of the supreme court,
 and the status of political par-
 ties.                                                                          The Directorate will re-
 tain all other powers.   Once the
 president is inaugurated, however,
 the Directorate will be dissolved
 and the assembly will assume full
 legislative powers until the
 elected lower house of the legis-
 lature is convened.   Elections
 for president, vice president,
 and the senate are scheduled
 for early September, and for the
 lower house on 1 October.
 It remains to be seen
 whether Premier Ky's tactic of
 gaining acceptance for the con-
 stitution by maneuvering inde-
 pendently of the Directorate
 will work for or against him
 in the long run.   The outcome
 will prove to be especially

 significant in terms of Premier
 Ky's presidential aspirations.
 There are indications that the
 military establishment might
 favor Chief of State Thieu over
 Ky if both men pursue their
 candidacies and agree to ask
 the military to decide between
 them.   On the other hand,  it is
 possible that Premier Ky might
 announce his candidacy throuqh
 a civilian political front be-
 fore a military nominating ses-
 sion is convened,  thus present-
 ing the military leadership with
 another fait accompli.   Politi-
 cal developments in the near fu-
 ture will continue to focus on
 the problems of selecting a
 military candidate and in main-
 taining military unity.
 Hanoi on Negotiations
 Hanoi capped a week-long
 propaganda assault on the Guam
 Conference by disclosing a secret
 exchange of letters on negotia-
 tions between President Johnson
 and Ho Chi Minh.   Although the
 actual exchange occurred during
 the first two weeks of February,
 Hanoi held the release until 21
 March,  apparently in an effort
 to divert some publicity away
 from the Guam meetings,  aid per-
 haps to dispel apprehensions
 in either Peking or among rank-
 and-file South Vietnamese Commu-

 SERIOUS DISCORD CONTINUES IN PEKING
 Efforts to re-establish or-
 der and conflicting drives for
 continuing the Cultural Revolu-
 tion have produced new tension
 and discord in Peking. A high-
 ='Level meeting of party members
 evidently has been called in
 Peking, probably to work out key
 policy questions connected with
 the reorganization of adminis-
 trative machinery both in Peking
 and in the provinces.   Indica-
 tions of renewed top-level dis-
 sension in recent weeks suggest
 that the gathering is a stormy
 one.
 bills announcing the central
 committee meeting, but giving
 no further details concerning
 the issues in dispute.   At :Least
 one alternate member of the com-
 mittee is known to be in the city.
 The last full meeting of
 the central committee was held
 in August 1966.   During October
 1966,  another period of confu-
 sion over what direction the
 Cultural Revolution should take,
 the central committee convened
 an unpublicized "work confer-
 ence."   The current meet=ing may
 be similar in character.
 A wall poster put up on 16
 March quoted Nieh Yuan-tzu,a
 radical female Red Guard leader
 who is an important member of
 the Maoist faction,  as saying
 that this is the most important
 stage of the revolution since the
 rebel drive for power began in
 January.   In a recent speech,
 another ultramilitant Red Guard
 leader described the current
 situation as the "lull before
 the decisive battle," and major
 Red Guard newspapers in Peking
 are claiming that a "reactionary
 adverse current" runs from the
 top to the bottom of the regime.
 Nieh Yuan-tzu was also
 quoted as claiming that the cen-
 tral committee was meeting in an
 atmosphere of "struggle" over
 who is to hold positions of
 power.   On 18 March, Czech cor-
 respondents in Peking saw hand-
 Other signs of disagreement
 have appeared in relation to the
 Red Guards.   During February the
 Guards were often, criticized for
 their immaturity and lack of dis-
 cipline, but a recent editorial
 in the Shanghai Wen Hui Pao gave
 them high marks.   This paper,
 which was in the vanguard of the
 Cultural Revolution last year,
 said that anyone who criticizes
 Red. Guards for their "relatively
 few errors"  is a "counterrevo-
 lutionary," and it denied that
 they had at any time "gone too
 far."   This could reflect behind
 the scenes criticism of Premier
 Chou En-lai, who has often taken
 the Red Guards to task for their
 excesses.
 Government officials asso-
 ciated with Chou En-lai have
 been the main targets of Red

 Guard wrath in the past two
 weeks. Well-organized rallies
 of Red Guards,  often attended
 by large numbers of army troops,
 have been held almost daily in
 Peking since 11 March to denounce
 Tan Chen-lin,  the politburo's
 agricultural specialist.   Spo-
 radic attacks have been made
 against four other politburo mem-
 bers,  including Finance Minister
 Li Hsien-nien and Li Fu-chun,  the
 head of the State Planning Com-
 mission.   Most of these officials
 were defended by Chou last Novem-
 ber and again in January.
 Although criticism of men
 who work for Chou may be designed
 to weaken his authority, he him-
 self continues to speak for the
 regime.    Chou addressed a Congress
 of Peasants in Peking on 19 March
 on behalf of Mao Tse-tung and Lin
 Piao, neither of whom normally
 attends a rally of this sort.
 Chou's speech was characteris-
 tically moderate.   He stressed
 the need to concentrate on farm-
 work and reaffirmed recent cen-
 tral committee statements that
 there are to be no "power seiz-
 ures"  in the countryside during
 the busy farm season.
 In its concern to bring or-
 der out of the confusion and in-
 action of the recent past, Pe-
 king is apparently turning more
 openly to the army as the pr,:--_n-
 cipal agent for administeri.zu
 the country.   At both natio-ial
 and provincial levels,  the m-l-
 itary is replacing shattered
 party and government apparatus
 as the channel by which Peking
 transmits policy.   The army now
 appears to be in charge of
 Kwangtung and Hupeh provinces
 and there are strong indicatj_ons
 that the military has at le 3:=t
 the dominant voice in most ,_)ther
 provinces.
 Peking had directed the army
 to become involved in a wide range
 of functions essential to t:e
 economy.   It controls the civil
 airline and in some areas  tte
 railroads,  as well as the post
 and telecommunications facil.ties.
 The army also is responsible for
 a large segment of China's mer-
 chant shipping.

 NEW JAPANESE DEFENSE PLAN
 The five-year defense pro-
 gram recently adopted by the
 Japanese cabinet provides for
 only modest progress toward a
 significant defense capability.
 Although Prime Minister Sato and
 his colleagues have succeeded in
 stimulating public discussion
 cf Japan's defense responsibil-
 ities,  strong pacifist sentiments
 still limit their initiatives in
 expanding military forces.
 This third five-year plan,
 which begins on 1 April, provides
 for only a slight increase in the
 defense share of national in-
 come--from 1.22 percent during
 the past five years to an esti-
 mated 1.27 percent in the coming
 period.   In the cabinet discus-
 sions the Finance Ministry suc-
 ceeded in trimming the Defense
 Agency's projections from a de-
 sired two percent of Japan's gross
 national product at the end of
 the period.   The approved $6.5-
 billion program for the full
 five-year period,  although
 roughly double the cost of the
 current five-year program, is al-
 most $1 billion below the amount
 requested.   In response to pres-
 sure from Japanese industry,  how-
 ever, most procurement items have
 been assigned for more costly
 domestic production.
 Despite the cut,  defense
 circles are reported to be
 pleased that some major items
 of modern equipment are provided
 for.   These include missiles for
 four Hawk battalions and two Nike-
 Hercules battalions,  jet fighters,
 transports, and training aircraft.
 The plan also envisages a modest
 increase in manpower, although
 the authorization probably will
 continue to run well ahead of
 actual strength.
 The plan will be debated
 extensively next month when the
 Diet considers the budget.   The
 opposition is expected to con-
 centrate its attacks on the
 nuclear capability of Nike-
 Hercules missiles.   Defense
 spokesmen are already countering
 with the assertion that these
 missiles will be built so as
 to preclude the use of nuclear
 warheads.   With the government
 in firm control of the Diet
 following last January's elec-
 tions,  little further change in
 the defense budget is likely.
 The Sato government is
 hoping to use the debate as
 part of its long-term campaign
 to educate the Japanese public
 on the need for greater defense
 effort, as well as for continua-
 tion of the US-Japan Mutual
 Security Treaty, which is sub-
 ject to revision or termination
 in 1970.   In recent months a
 government information program
 has elicited postwar Japan's
 first responsible,  serious debate
 on military problems,  including
 defense against a nuclear-armed         25X1
 China.

 EUROPE
 Soviet Party General Secretary Brezhnev's
 meeting this week in Moscow with East German party
 boss Ulbricht ended a series of talks Brezhnev has
 been having with Russia's East European allies.
 Bulgaria and Hungary were persuaded at least to
 delay recognizing West Germany.   Bulgaria also
 agreed to an early renewal of its defense treaties
 with the USSR and Poland, but Hungary apparently
 was unwilling to make this gesture now.   No greater
 cooperation was won from Rumania,  and the need to
 resort to bilateral dealings exposed the Warsaw
 Pact's weakness as a mechanism for coordinating
 political policies.
 The disarmament talks in Geneva were recessed
 for six weeks in a concession to the Western Euro-
 peans who want more time to consider the implica-
 tions of the projected nonproliferation treaty.
 Top-level delegations will meet in Geneva next
 week in a final push to conclude the Kennedy Round
 negotiations by the agreed target of 30 April.   The
 "'all or nothing" nature of the final bargaining
 carries the possibility of last-minute failure, but
 the current feverish activity in all the delegatin
 is generating a modest optimism-

 SOVIET DIPLOMACY ON EUROPEAN SECURITY
 The Soviets are keeping their
 proposal for a European security
 conference alive.   The idea turned
 up again in the 21 March communi-
 que ending the visit of Austria's
 Chancellor Klaus  to the  USSR.
 Moreover,  the meeting of European
 Communist parties,  scheduled for
 Czechoslovakia next month,   is
 being organized around the theme
 of European security, which in
 the present context means the
 German problem and the future of
 NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
 The Soviets hardly expect
 serious multilateral negotiations
 on these subjects to come about
 soon, but are using the idea as
 an instrument for disrupting
 Western unity.   Moscow hopes to
 reap political gains by implying
 its readiness to consider new
 security arrangements for all
 Europe,  a tactic that complements
 continuing efforts to develop its
 bilateral relations with major
 Western European countries.
 The idea of a security con-
 ference of all European states
 is more a diplomatic gambit than
 a realistic goal.  Moscow has
 kept the notion current for the
 past year.   By doing so,  it helps
 foster a mood of expectation and
 exploits a general desire for
 detente in Europe.   Soviet spokes-
 men, however, have avoided such
 concrete proposals as the sub-
 stance or timing of a conference,
 lest they be taken too seriously
 too soon.
 The gathering of Communist
 leaders which will begin in late
 April in the Czech resort town
 of Karlovy Vary is intended to
 suggest that the Communist parties
 of Europe are focusing seriously
 on the security problem.   A second
 purpose is to foster unity of out-
 look among European Communists.
 A regional conference of
 Communists  is also of value to
 Moscow in its dispute with
 Peking.   Even though the Chinese
 question need not be raised form-
 ally,  the meeting of and by it-
 self would serve to point up
 Moscow's rapport with other Com-
 munist parties in contrast with
 China's isolation?

 GENEVA DISARMAMENT TALKS RECESSED
 After a month of indecisive
 discussion,   the Eighteen Nation
 Disarmament Committee (ENDC)  has
 recessed for six weeks to allow
 further attempts to resolve prob-
 lems the European Allies still have
 with the draft nonproliferation
 treaty.   In recent visits to Euro-
 pean capitals, Ambassador Foster--
 the US delegate to the ENDC--had
 some success in convincing the Euro-
 peans that interpretations or adjust-
 ments of the treaty's text can be
 made so that it will not restrict
 their peaceful nuclear activities.
 Nevertheless,  the remaining politi-
 cal and technical reservations are
 serious and,  in the US view, nothing
 would be gained by resuming the
 ENDC talks until they are resolved.
 The most serious problems
 center on the proposed treaty pro-
 vision for international safeguards
 to prevent surreptitious diversion
 of nuclear materials to weapons
 uses.   EURATOM's officials  continue
 to maintain that the community's
 supranational safeguards system
 would be undermined if controls by
 the International Atomic Energy
 Agency  (IAEA) were to be superim-
 posed.   EURATOM Commissioner Sassen
 has  indicated that EURATOM could
 possibly accept IAEA "verification"
 of community safeguards--as the US
 is now prepared to suggest--but
 it is questionable whether either
 the IAEA or the Soviet Union will
 accept this.   Moreover,  unless
 there is a prior agreeement between
 the IAEA and EURATOM on what "ver-
 ification" would mean in practice,
 it is doubtful EURATOM would agree
 in advance to the proposed three-
 year transition period for phasing
 EURATOM safeguards into --he IAEA
 system.
 The interruption of the ENDC
 negotiations may well increase
 suspicions among the non--European
 members that a final draft is
 being worked out behind their
 backs.   They have their own prob-
 lems in renouncing the dEvelopment
 of nuclear weapons,  and resent not
 having been consulted in the form-
 ative stages of the treaty talks.
 India in particular is urlikely
 to sign the treaty as it stands
 unless it gets some security guar-
 antee against threats of nuclear
 attack and unless more tharn a
 promise of nuclear disarmament
 is given by the nuclear powers.
 Moreover,  if the safeguards pro-
 vision is dropped in response to
 pressures from the Europeans,  the
 others may well make a determined
 effort to have one restor3(J.
 The delay in the ENDS proceed-
 ings will also provide the USSR

 OUTLOOK FOR SOVIET WINTER WHEAT CROP
 Conditions are favorable
 for another good winter wheat
 crop in the USSR.   This would
 be the third good crop in a row.
 The total area sown to
 winter grains is somewhat less
 than the 41 million hectares
 planned, partly because of dry
 weather in some areas at sowing
 time.   About 20 million hectares--
 approximately that officially
 reported for 1965 and 1966--
 probably were sown to winter
 wheat.   Lack of germination and
 winter kill will require some
 resowing but the condition of
 the wheat now is about the same
 as in 1965 and 1966,  years when
 good crops were harvested.
 The slight reduction in the
 sown area should be offset to
 SECRET
 some degree by the larger por-
 tion of the winter wheat area
 that was sown with high--yielding
 varieties.   Moreover,  the So-
 viets plan to apply nitrogen
 fertilizers to 30 mill'-on hec-
 tares of winter grains this
 spring compared with 18 million
 last year.
 Precipitation in the prin-
 cipal winter wheat areas since
 seeding time approximated--and
 in many cases surpassed---the
 levels of the past two years,
 and soil moisture at the end of
 February was estimated to be
 generally above average for this
 time of year.   Snow cover, which
 is extremely important for win-
 ter grains, was 50-100 percent
 above normal in some areas.

 MIDDLE LEAST - AFRICA
 The Indian cabinet has fairly handily beaten
 off initial opposition assaults in the new parlia-
 ment, but fresh troubles are in the making. Leftists
 in the West Bengal state government are using their
 position to wrest control of key labor unions in the
 teeming Calcutta area.   Across the border in East
 Pakistan, rioting over contaminated food supplies
 is shaking the local government and may lead to an
 anti-US campaign.
 In the Middle East, Nasir is calling ever more
 sharply for other states to join him in opposing
 what he calls US  "pressure."   Intra-Arab quarrels
 again have brought turbulence in Lebanon, where pro-
 and anti-Nasir elements are pressing the moderate
 government to take a clearer stand in their favor.
 Tension along the Jordan-Israel border has risen
 again;  UN observers there have been alerted for
 possible incidents.   Israel also has internal eco-
 nomic problems which could raise its frustration
 level.   (For details on these problems,  see page
 22).
 In South Arabia,  another British mission has
 made fresh proposals offering an earlier independ-
 ence date for the South Arabian Federation and a
 promise to leave some military forces at hand for
 use against pro-Nasirists during the immediate
 postindependence period.
 In Africa,  there were postreferendum riots
 in French Somaliland and postelection tensions in
 Sierra Leone.   Pre-election politics are also heat-
 ing up in Senegal, where President Senghor was the
 object of an assassination attempt this week.   One
 long-standing dispute, the rivalry between Rwanda
 and Burundi, edged a bit toward resolution last
 weekend when Presidents Micombero of Burundi and
 Kayibanda of Rwanda met in the eastern Congo
 (Kinshasa)  under Mobutu's aegis.   Farther south,
 the South African Government is taking new image-
 building initiatives, while a special UN committee
 in New York wrestles with the problem West Africa.

 NIGERIAN CRISIS MOVES INTO A NEW PHASE
 Supreme Commander Gowon has
 finally taken a decisive step in
 an attempt to break the deadlock
 with Eastern governor Ojukwu over
 Nigeria's form of government.
 On 17 March the federal gov-
 ernment issued a "Constitution
 (Suspension and Modification)
 Decree," which amounts to a new
 constitution for Nigeria.   The
 decree establishes the ruling
 Supreme Military Council  (SMC)  in
 which all regions are represented
 as a collegial legislative and
 executive body.   The unanimous
 consent of council members is re-
 quired for action in such impor-
 tant areas as the armed forces,
 the police,  trade,  commerce,  in-
 dustry,  and transport.   The decree
 thus takes into account in large
 measure Ojukwu's advocacy of
 greater regional autonomy.
 To declare a state of emer-
 gency in any region, however,  the
 consent of only three of the four
 regional governors,  plus the head
 of the federal government,  is
 required.   Ojukwu believes this
 provision is aimed directly at
 him,  and before the decree was
 even promulgated he declared it
 was unacceptable.   Western gover-
 nor Adebayo, on the other hand,
 told the US consul in Ibadan it
 would be impossible to get three
 governors to agree,  and he re-
 stated his opposition to the use
 of force to solve Nigeria's in-
 ternal squabbles.
 Adebayo does not believe
 the East can be successfully in-
 vaded,                                                                 a view apparently shared
 by Northern governor Katsina,
 who reportedly was willing to
 "let Ojukwu stew in his own juice
 for a while."   The SMC meeting--
 minus Ojukwu--held in Lagos on
 19 March discussed possible
 economic actions against the
 Eastern Region and is to take up
 specific steps at another meet-
 ing scheduled for 29 March.
 It is unlikely that Gowon
 will initiate measures that
 would result in Eastern seces-
 sion, nor would Ojukwu secede
 without extreme provocation. The
 Eastern governor probably will,
 however,  go ahead with plans to
 take control by 1 April of at
 least some Eastern revenues
 currently paid to the federal
 government.   Thus, a series of
 economic moves and countermoves
 seem to be in the. offing..   There
 also still exists a threat of
 unilateral military action against
 Ojukwu by fire-breathing Northern
 officers who are unhappy over
 the federal government's failure
 so far to take significant ac-
 tion against the East.

 FRENCH SOMALILAND OPTS FOR CONTINUED FRENCH TIES
 Slightly over 60 percent of
 French Somaliland's registered
 voters chose to continue living
 under French rule in the referen-
 dum on 19 March, but the terri-
 tory's rival Afar and Somali com-
 munities have become so deeply
 split that there seems to be
 little prospect of political sta-
 bility in the near future.
 The final vote was strictly
 along communal lines.   The rural
 Afar majority voted solidly for
 association with France, while
 the Somali minority   who are con-
 centrated in the main city of
 Djibouti voted for independence.
 The rioting that broke out among
 the Somalis after the result was
 announced never spread beyond
 the Somali areas of Djibouti and
 was put down by French security
 forces.   Somali instigated dis-
 turbances could recur, however,
 and the French will probably have
 to maintain strict security meas-
 ures for some time.
 Somali opposition to the
 French is unlikely to diminish
 and almost certainly will be the
 principal block to French efforts
 to get the Afars and Somalis to-
 gether in a new territorial gov-
 ernment.

 ritory's finances,  foreign af-

 head of government would replace
 the present French governor,  and
 a government council responsible
 to an elected Chamber of Deputies
 would be established.   Somali
 political leaders, however, have
 informed the French govern.r- that
 they intend to protest the refer-
 endum's   results and have  decided
 to boycott any government that is
 formed. Moussa Idris, head of

 POSTELECTION CRISIS IN SIERRA LEONE
 Sierra Leone's political
 stability is in serious jeopardy
 in the wake of last week's
 closely contested election and
 army commander Lansana's subse-
 quent extraconstitutional inter-
 vention in behalf of incumbent
 Prime Minister Margai.
 Capitalizing on widespread
 dissatisfaction with the previous
 government, the opposition All
 People's Congress  (APC)  won more
 seats than did Margai's Sierra
 Leone People's Party   (SLPP)  in
 the 17 March balloting.   Neither
 side came away with a clear ma-
 jority of the 66 ordinary par-
 liamentary seats, however.
 Lansana's 21 March declara-
 tion of marital law and virtual
 annulment of the governor gen-
 eral's appointment of APC leader
 Saika Stevens as the new prime
 minister was almost certainly in-
 spired by Margai,  to whom Lansana

 has long been close.   Lansana
 contended that the governnor gen-
 eral had acted prematurely inas-
 much as the election returns were
 still incomplete.
 The army-imposed stalemate
 --involving the confinement to
 the State House of both Stevens
 and the governor general and the
 imposition of a curfew--has given
 Margai time to bargain with in-
 dependents and marshal other
 support.   After the election on
 21 March of 12 paramount chiefs
 as additional full members of
 parliament,  10 of them promptly
 made unprecedented declarations
 of allegiance to the SLPP.   Al-
 though by custom the chiefs have
 been formally apolitical, most
 of them have in fact long been
 closely allied with Margai's
 party.
 With a claimed 32 ordinary
 seats--including four won by in-
 dependents who allegedly declared
 for the SLPP after their election
 --Margai appears to have a major-
 ity of the 78 seats in the new
 parliament within his grasp.   The
 elections of six of the ordinary
 members are, however, being
 formally challenged by the APC,
 and some other successful SLPP
 candidates would like to dump
 Margai as party leader.   A number
 of political combinations E_re
 thus still possible,  inclucing
 a broad coalition led by scmeone
 else from Margai's party--possibly
 incumbent Minister of Education
 Sheriff.   An eventual complete
 take-over by the army, perhaps
 with Margai serving as "political
 adviser" to Lansana,  also cannot
 be excluded.
 The current crisis is rooted
 in and has in turn sharpened tradi-
 tional tribal and regional a:itago-
 nisms.   These pit the large Mende
 tribe, which predominates in the
 Southern and Eastern provinces and
 is the mainstay of the SLPP,
 against the important Temne and
 Limba tribes of the North from
 which the APC draws its basis: sup-
 port.   As an opposition party,
 the APC has also profited from
 the support of Freetown's Creoles,
 the politically dispossessed
 descendants of freed slaves who
 constitute the bulk of the  -:_vil
 servants.   The same ethnic Split
 undermines the cohesiveness of
 the 1,300-man army and casts doubt
 on the ability of Lansana,  :a Mende
 to maintain military control over
 the country for very long.   Light
 antiregime officers--all bu- one      25X1
 of them Northerners--were a_-rested
 only last month on charges    of
 plotting a coup.

 ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IN ISRAEL
 For the first time in Isra-
 el's history unemployment has be-
 come a serious problem,  and there
 is little prospect for improve-
 ment this year.   Some 60,000 work-
 ers,                   about seven percent of the
 total labor force, were unem-
 ployed at the end of 1966,  and
 some labor rioting has occurred.
 The economic situation is thus
 an embarassment to the govern-
 ment,  although at present it
 does not appear to threaten Prime
 Minister Eshkol's tenure.
 Tel Aviv's sensitivity to
 the problem was reflected in the
 recent dismissal of Jon Kimche,
 long-time editor of the London-
 based Jewish Observer and Middle
 East Review.   When Kimche pub-
 lished a story claiming that
 90,000 workers were unemployed,
 the government pressured the
 British Zionist organization
 which sponsors the magazine to
 fire him.
 The chief cause of the slow-
 down was a severe drop in con-
 struction activity last year.
 A high rate of construction,
 partly to accommodate the inflow
 of immigrants,  had been a major
 factor in Israel's sustained
 boom--an annual growth of more
 than ten percent in GNP between
 1948 and 1964.   In its later
 stages, the boom was accompanied
 by growing inflation and trade
 deficits.   In an effort to sta-
 bilize the economy and put it
 on a sounder footing,  the gov-
 ernment in 1965-66 adopted a
 "tight money" policy and reduced
 its expenditures.   But these ac-
 tions in turn have caused large
 cutbacks in both private and
 public investment.
 The government now has
 turned back to a more expansionary
 fiscal policy in the 1967--68
 budget.   This policy will be
 used. cautiously, however,  since
 inflation has not ceased despite
 the high unemployment rate,   and
 unemployment probably will re-
 main high for some time.
 Before Israel. can regain
 a rapid rate of growth, a major
 restructuring of the economy is
 necessary.   Much industry is
 small scale and inefficient.
 In recent years,  inflation and
 rising costs of production have
 encouraged imports and inhibited
 exports.   Unless political fac-
 tors--an Arab attack,  for ex-
 ample--intervene,  the economy
 also must adjust to a continuing
 decline in foreign assistance
 and in immigration.   Corrective
 measures for any of these prob-
 lems will be very difficult po-
 litically, will need consider-
 able time to take effect, and
 initially will tend to inhibit
 economic growth.   There is no
 evidence that the government is
 seriously considering the most
 obvious stimulant to exports,
 devaluation of the Israeli
 pound.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 The tempo of international and national prepa-
 rations for the 12-14 April presidents' meeting in
 Punta del Este, Uruguay, has picked up appreciably.
 Special representatives of the hemisphere's
 presidents continued their meetings in Montevideo
 during the week to work out the detailed agenda
 for the summit conference.   No insurmountable ob-
 stacles were encountered,  although negotiations on
 the subjects of the timetable for achieving full
 economic integration and the terms of Latin America's
 trade with the US are taking longer than anticipated.
 Meanwhile,  the various presidents are beginning
 to firm up their plans for attending the summit.
 Some will be anxious to raise bilateral problems
 and other topics not on the agenda;   Ecuadorean
 President Arosemena,  for example, reportedly will
 insist on publicly addressing the meeting and rais-
 ing Ecuador's border problem with Peru if he attends.
 This would automatically mean that Peruvian Presi-
 dent Belaunde--who now says he will go to the
 meeting--would have to try to respond in kind.  For
 his part, Panamanian President Robles intends to
 discuss the canal issue with President Johnson.
 Other chief executives are planning to meet
 with each other before the summit.   President Leoni
 of Venezuela will see Chilean President Frei in
 Santiago on the eve of the meeting, and the five
 Central American presidents are planning to travel
 to Punta del Este together;  they may even
 meet
 beforehand.

 CASTRO DEFENDS REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE
 Fidel Castro's annual 13 March
 speech was his most outspoken de-
 fense to date of his policy of revo-
 lutionary violence in Latin America.
 In it,  he criticized Communists in
 the hemisphere who back away from
 armed struggle when the going gets
 tough.   Recent Soviet diplomatic
 and economic overtures to Latin
 American governments evoked the
 comment that "whoever helps those
 oligarchies where guerrillas are
 fighting will be helping to sup-
 press the revolution."
 The speech was also an answer
 to Venezuelan charges of Cuban com-
 piicity in the assassination of Dr.
 ,Tulio Iribarren Borges,  the brother
 of Venezuela's foreign minister.
 Castro denied any involvement in
 the affair and countered by accus-
 ing the "chorus of hangmen ruling
 Venezuela" of "bloody and intoler-
 able repression."   To document his
 counterattack he read off a list of
 ov,rer 100 "Venezuelan patriots" who
 had been "murdered" by the Betan-
 court and Leoni administrations.
 Castro's most scathing remarks,
 however, were reserved for Venezue-
 lan Communist Party leaders, who
 had been quick to disassociate
 themselves from the assassination.
 fie denounced the party leaders as
 vacillators, defeatists,  cowards,
 and theorizing charlatans for hav-
 ing avoided armed struggle.
 In a public reply,  the Vene-
 zuelan party characterized his at-
 tack as ignoble,  self-seeking,
 and treacherous, and rejected the
 "role of revolutionary pope that
 Fidel Castro asks for himself."
 The gap between Castro and the
 Venezuelan Communist Party has
 never been wider.
 In discussing support for
 Latin American Communists, Castro
 ignored a 10 March Pravda commen-
 tary cautioning that "any weakening
 of the Communist parties or any
 splitting of their ranks, whatever
 motives may lie behind it, would
 bring irremediable damage to the
 vital interests of their countries
 and peoples."   He bluntly stated:
 "If in any nation those who call
 themselves Communists do not know
 how to fulfill their duty, we will
 support those who--even though
 they do not call themselves Commu-
 nists--behave like real Communists
 in the struggle... What defines
 Communists of this continent is
 their action in the guerrilla move-
 ment in Guatemala, Colombia,  and
 Venezuela."
 Although tactical differences
 are undoubtedly eroding the pa-
 tience of both Havana and Moscow,
 there is no reason to believe that
 Cuba's relations with the USSR are
 in serious jeopardy.   Relations
 with Latin American Communists,
 however,  are a different. matter.
 Castro's continued support of
 armed rebels in the field may well
 force orthodox Latin American Com-
 munist leaders to follow the lead
 of the Venezuelans in denouncing
 Cuban meddling and provoking an
 open break with the Castro regime.
 Indeed,  the leaders of the Colom-   25X1
 bian Communist Party are already
 considering a break with Castro
 over this issue.

 URUGUAYAN LABOR AGITATION LIKELY TO CONTINUE
 Renewed labor agitation,
 much of it Communist-inspired,
 can be expected in Uruguay despite
 the apparent settlement of a
 protracted strike by government
 health workers.
 The outcome of the strike,
 which may well have been an early
 test of wills between the Commu-
 nist-dominated National Workers'
 Convention  (CNT)  and the new
 administration of President Oscar
 Gestido, was a stalemate.   Al-
 though the workers did not win
 wage increases greater than the
 90 percent already granted them
 (many other public employees re-
 ceived hikes averaging 125 per-
 cent),  the government admitted
 that they were badly underpaid
 and promised them special consid-
 eration in the next budget.   The
 CNT, which originally had strongly
 backed the strike by calling a
 reasonably successful 24-hour
 general strike and a one-hour
 work stoppage to support it,
 tried to back away when the
 strike became unpopular.   A
 fractious Communist faction in
 the union apparently disregarded
 party instructions, attempted to
 force an escalation of the strike,
 and lost.
 Despite their failure to
 make major gains in this sttrike,
 the Communists probably wi 1
 have many opportunities to stir
 up labor unrest in the near fu-
 ture.   Economic conditions are
 deteriorating--the cost of living
 rose 16.7 percent in the f_rst
 two months of 1967,  and could
 pass 1965's record of near---y 90
 percent--and worker discontent
 remains high.   President Ge=stido
 is concerned that internal tiru-
 guayan problems may defy short-
 term solutions.   The government
 has not yet attempted to enforce
 a restrictive wage policy  in the
 private sector nor to control
 prices.
 The Communists have ai ready
 demonstrated their ability to
 use labor agitation over le-giti-
 mate economic grievances fcr po-
 litical ends.   They reportedly
 hope to pursue this tactic to
 promote a general strike and
 widespread agitation durinc  the
 inter-American summit meeting
 scheduled in Punta del Este next
 month.   They may well succeed
 in mounting sizable demonstra-
 tions in Montevideo--some  10
 miles away--but it seems urlikely
 that they could seriously threaten
 stability.                                 25X1

 CHANCES FOR STABILIZATION IMPROVE IN ARGENTINA
 The prospects for economic
 and political stability in Argen-
 tina have been improved consider-
 ably in the past few weeks by the
 government's decisive actions on
 labor and economic problems.
 The regime's success in
 forcing the General Confederation
 of Labor  (CGT)  to call off a 48-
 hour strike scheduled for this
 week has considerably weakened
 the opposition group with the
 greatest potential for thwarting
 government reform efforts. Presi-
 dent Ongania's strong stand
 against the unions not only broke
 their strength, but also increased
 military support for his policies,
 which the generals had severely
 criticized in the past.
 On the economic front,  the
 40-percent devaluation of the
 peso announced on 13 March    (350
 pesos = $1 US)  together with re-
 forms in the tax structure and
 increases in public utility tar-
 iffs have qualified Argentina for
 an International Monetary Fund
 stand-by agreement which probably
 will be announced soon.    The
 unexpectedly large devaluation,
 which exceeded the prevailing
 "black market" rate,should

 provide a respite from further
 speculation against the peso.  It
 should also encourage exporters
 and stimulate foreign investment
 in Argentina.
 The devaluation was accom-
 panied by an increase in tariffs
 on traditional agricultural ex-
 ports--already competitive in
 world markets--which should add
 40-50 billion pesos to government
 revenues.   Surcharges on a broad
 range of imports have been low-
 ered, on the other hand,  in an
 attempt to reduce inflationary
 pressures.
 Progress has been made to-
 ward establishing the regional
 organizations of the National
 Development Council, which are
 to apply economic planning to
 the interior of the country.
 The president is also reviewing
 a draft university reform law
 which would substitute a govern-
 ing body composed of faculty
 members for the autonomous uni-
 versity administration estab-
 lished in 1908.   Students would
 have a voice but. no vote in uni-
 versity administration, and po-
 litical activity on campus would
