 was used in this  eort (the so-called three obstacles), the last two years have seen a sharp growth
 r
 in economic and scientific-technological ties.
 Sino-Soviet economic ties are showing the greatest growth. Sino-Soviet
 trade has doubled in the last two years to reach $2.4 billion in 1986, and
 three Soviet economic delegations met with senior Chinese in 1986. Recent
 agreements to exchange trade exhibitions, build additional rail links, and
 open reciprocal trading and shipping offices could help boost Sino-Soviet
 trade to a $3 billion average annual figure for the rest of the term of a five-
 year trade agreement that extends to 1990. Although this is sufficient to
 raise the Soviet Union to the position of China's sixth-largest trading
 partner, Moscow's nearly 4-percent share of total trade falls well behind
 the shares of Japan (27 percent), Hon Kong (22 percent), and the United
 States (11 percent).
 years-signed by the Chinese since 1979.
 China's scientific and technical contacts with the Soviet Union are also
 increasing, although less rapidly than in the trade sphere. In 1986 the
 Soviets agreed to renovate 17 factories and construct seven new facilities,
 most in northeastern China. Several hundred Soviet technicians ultimately
 will be sent to China for these and other industrial programs and an equal
 number of Chinese personnel will be sent to the USSR for training. In our
 judgment, Beijing will seek greater Soviet assistance over the next few
 years, particularly in the energy and heavy-industry sectors, where Soviet
 technology is often on a par with that available from the West. Nonethe-
 less, Sino-Soviet projects number fewer than 30 and will continue to be
 dwarfed by thousands of major contracts for Western assistance-involv-
 ing more than 10,000 Western technicians in China over the past two
 Even in the political arena, where movement is not as striking, changes are
 evident. The number of venues and levels of contact suggest that, although
 Moscow and Beijing continue to have sharp disagreements, the sessions are
 no longer the "dialogue of the deaf" described by a Chinese diplomat early
 last year. We see signs, moreover, that China has decided to maintain an at-
 mosphere conducive to greater contacts and to pass up opportunities to score
 propaganda points on the Soviet Union. Beijing, for example, did not play up
 a shooting incident between Soviet and Chinese patrols in July 1986 or the
 errant landing, probably in China, of an unarmed Soviet submarine-
 launched missile the following September, even after the incidents were

 widely publicized in the Western press. Moreover, the Chinese have not
 reacted to Soviet reconnaissance flights over the Yellow Sea since October
 1986 or publicized a recent Soviet violation of Chinese airspace.
 We do not believe China has changed its assessment that the Soviet Union
 poses a long-term military threat to China. Articles in China's restricted
 publications argue that Moscow is attempting to reform its economy to
 confront China and the United States more effectively early in the next
 century. China continues to devote great resources to improving its military
 forces along the Sino-Soviet border, and Beijing has shown no indication of
 backing away from its relationship with Washington. Indeed, it is most
 interested in expanding US-China military ties.
 What has changed, in our judgment, is how China has chosen to manage
 the Soviet threat. We believe a number of things account for Beijing's
 decision to move forward without real Soviet concessions on the three
 obstacles. Among them are China's need for reduced tensions as it reforms
 and modernizes, the obvious economic and S&T benefit to China, and
 China's belief that some improvement in Sino-Soviet relations increases its
 leverage in Washington and creates tension in Soviet-Vietnamese relations.
 Perhaps more important, we believe Beijing is reacting to the rise of
 General Secretary Gorbachev, his interest in Asia, and his different style.
 Chinese leaders apparently believe that Gorbachev sincerely desires better
 relations, and we see the expansion of the political venues, in particular, as
 an effort to probe the limits of Gorbachev's flexibility. Finally, deeper,
 more visible US ties increase the pressure on Beijing to demonstrate to the
 Third World-by increasing ties to Moscow where it can-that, despite
 appearances, it pursues an independent foreign policy.
 We believe Sino-Soviet relations are entering a period that will see
 additional movement in the trade and S&T areas, and the political
 dialogue will also broaden. Progress is likely to be unsteady, and affected
 by two factors:
 ? China's perception of Gorbachev's motives and power.
 ? The reaction in the West, particularly in the United States. Continued
 stress on the three obstacles, vigorous criticism of Soviet foreign policy,
 and repeated assurances by Chinese leaders of the permanence of China's
 opening to the West suggest that concern about a negative US reaction
 will act as a brake on the development of Sino-Soviet ties.

 China's Growing Relations
 With the USSR:
 Beijing's Agenda
 China continues to insist that there can be no funda-
 mental improvement in relations with the Soviet
 Union until Moscow reduces its threat to Chinese
 security. Specifically, China is demanding a reduction
 of the Soviet military presence along its border to
 1950s' levels, an end to Soviet support for Vietnam,
 and a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not
 mentioned specifically, but of evident concern as
 Is the continuing Soviet naval
 build-up in the Pacific and Moscow's warming rela-
 tions with P'yongyang.
 While continuing to press Moscow to address its
 security concerns, Beijing nonetheless has permitted a
 significant expansion of Sino-Soviet contacts over the
 last two years as part of its efforts to assuage the
 tensions in the relationship.' Trade and scientific and
 technological exchanges have expanded the most, but
 even political contacts have grown, although the
 Chinese do not characterize them positively.
 Trade is the most active area in China's evolving
 relations with the Soviet Union. Trade with Moscow
 accounts for less than 4 percent of Beijing's total
 trade, but the dollar value has doubled in the last two
 years (see table). Under the goods exchange and
 payments agreement that began in 1986, bilateral
 trade is set to total $14 billion for the five-year period
 ending in 1990. We estimate that the total trade for
 1986 was slightly above the average annual rate of
 increase implicit in the $14 billion goal. Moreover, we
 believe an increasing level of border trade and the
 recent moves toward technical cooperation will fur-
 ther accelerate trade growth and the five-year target
 will be easily met.
 Diversification in the composition of trade to include
 new categories of goods is also an indication of the
 expanding bilateral trade relationship. In 1982 chemi-
 cals and crude materials represented more than four-
 fifths of Chinese imports from the Soviet Union. By
 1985, however, manufactured products and machin-
 ery and transportation equipment represented two-     25X1
 thirds of total Soviet exports to China. At the same 25X1
 time, Chinese exports to the Soviet Union shifted
 from being heavily weighted toward crude materials 25X1
 to being almost 50 percent food and live animals.
 More significant for the atmosphere, in our judgment,
 is the growth in high-level economic exchanges. In
 1985, Chinese Vice Premier Yao Yilin led an econom-
 ic delegation to Moscow, reciprocating a visit in late
 1984 by Soviet First Deputy Premier Ivan Arkhipov;
 both visits resulted in new trade agreements. In 1986   25X1
 the Soviets sent three separate economic delegations
 to Beijing and in each case met with senior Chinese
 economic officials, including Premier Zhao Ziyang,
 who has since become General Secretary of the
 Chinese Communist Party as well:
 ? In January, Soviet First Vice Minister of Foreign
 Trade G. K. Zhuravlev headed a transport and
 trade delegation to Beijing, and met with Vice
 Premier Li Peng and Minister of Foreign Economic
 Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin.
 ? In March, Arkhipov visited Beijing to cochair the
 inaugural session of the Joint Commission on Trade,
 Economics, Science, and Technology, created to
 manage overall economic contacts. According to the

 Soviet Embassy in Beijing, a special committee to
 examine transportation problems and the obstacles
 they present to increased trade was created. The
 visit also included meetings with Zhao Ziyang, Li
 Peng, and Vice Premier Wan Li.
 ? In September, Soviet First Deputy Premier and
 Chairman of the State Planning Committee Niko-
 lay Talyzin met with Chinese officials in Beijing
 and signed a cooperation agreement providing a
 formal framework for trade, commercial, and tech-
 nical exchanges that will take place through 1990.
 Accompanying Talyzin were the Chairman of the
 Soviet State Committee for Foreign Economic Re-
 lations, the Minister of Timber, and Deputy Foreign
 Minister Igor' Rogachev. The Soviets met with
 Zhao Ziyang, Yao Yilin, Li Peng, Vice Foreign
 Minister Qian Qichen, and head of the Chinese
 State Planning Commission Song Ping.
 The visits have led to new economic agreements (see
 inset "Recent Sino-Soviet Economic Exchanges"). In
 addition to those noted above, China and the Soviet
 Union agreed to set up a committee to guide planning
 for the comprehensive use of the water resources of
 the Argun and Amur Rivers (Ergun and Heilong
 Rivers in Chinese). In March 1986, Moscow was
 allowed not only to open an economic office in
 Beijing, but also to locate it outside the Soviet
 diplomatic compound-the first time since the Sino-
 Soviet rift. According to the US Embassy, the office
 is ably staffed and taking a businesslike, outgoing
 approach that contrasts sharply with traditional Sovi-
 et practices in developing Sino-Soviet contacts. The
 two sides also resumed cooperation in commodity
 shipping, opening shipping offices in Shanghai and
 Odessa.
 And, for the first time in more than three decades,
 Beijing and Moscow in 1986 exchanged trade and
 industry exhibitions under a new protocol calling for
 reciprocal exhibitions through 1990. The Chinese
 exhibition in Moscow featured a model of China's

 lites, computers, televisions, textiles, and handicrafts,

 When Did the Thaw Begin?
 ? December 1984. Arkhipov visited Beijing and
 signed a significantly expanded trade agreement
 plus new agreements on economic cooperation and
 exchanges in culture and science and technology.
 Originally scheduled for May 1984 but delayed
 because of a Chinese military attack on Vietnam,
 this was the highest ranking direct Sino-Soviet
 contact in 15 years.
 ? March 1985. Chinese Vice Premier Li Peng repre-
 sented China at the funeral for Soviet General
 Secretary Konstantin Chernenko. Li personally
 conveyed to new General Secretary Gorbachev the
 congratulations of Chinese General Secretary Hu
 Yaobang on being elected General Secretary.
 ? July 1985. Chinese Vice Premier Yao Yilin recipro-
 cated the Arkhipov visit of December 1984 with a
 visit to Moscow. Yao signed a goods-and-payments
 agreement for the period 1986-90 as well as a
 separate agreement on technical cooperation and
 was received by Soviet Premier Nikolay Tikhonov.
 The new economic relationship is an outgrowth of
 Beijing's reassessment of its foreign policy strategy
 during the period 1980-82. The Chinese-disturbed
 by differences with the United States over Taiwan
 and other issues and seeking to increase China's
 room to maneuver in the strategic triangle-pro-
 claimed an "independent "foreign policy and in 1982
 agreed to open "consultative talks" with Moscow.
 Visits by Soviet and Chinese deputy/vice premiers in
 1984 and 1985 set the stage for the expansion of
 economic ties:
 while the Soviet show in Beijing displayed models of a
 Tokamak 15 nuclear fusion reactor, a Salyut orbital
 space station, and a Vega scientific satellite, in addi-
 tion to the latest automobiles, aircraft, and other
 sophisticated hardware.
 Trade Constraints
 Sino-Soviet trade is constrained by two major factors.
 First, the cumbersome barter arrangement requires
 trade to be balanced and involves arduous and pro-
 longed negotiations. Although both sides acquire
 needed goods without drawing down foreign reserves,
 ? December 1985. Li Peng, on his way home from
 Eastern Europe, stopped over in Moscow at Gorba-
 chev's invitation. Xinhua reported that the two
 discussed "bilateral relations and some interna-
 tional issues. "
 Chinese and Soviet officials admit that first priority
 goes to earning hard currency and the barter system
 gets the leftovers, according the the US Embassy in
 Beijing. Often this means that both sides approach the
 barter negotiations with the intent to dump their        25X1
 second-rate goods on one another, while saving their
 best export commodities for Western and Japanese
 markets. Some barter sales to the Soviet Union have

 Secret
 The second major constraint is the poor transportation
 infrastructure at the major border transshipment
 points in the northeast and the west. To alleviate this,
 the two sides are cooperating on railroad projects.
 Construction on the extension of the railroad in
 Heilongjiang Province northward to Heihe on the
 Soviet border is scheduled for completion next year,
 and the railroad ending at Urumqi in the Xinjiang
 Autonomous Region is also being extended west to the
 Soviet border (see figure 1).
 Trade Outlook
 These problems notwithstanding, we expect China's
 trade with the Soviet Union to grow over the next
 three years, perhaps reaching 5 percent of China's
 total trade. Fueling the growth will be China's desire
 to offset potential market losses as a result of growing
 protectionism in the West and new policies that allow
 Chinese enterprises to use countertrade to acquire
 Soviet technology. According to US Consulate offi-
 cials in Shanghai, enterprises there that export to the
 Soviet Union can even earn foreign exchange alloca-
 tions on the basis of the amount of hard currency
 saved.
 these countertrade
 arrangements are often very profitable, with Chinese-
 manufactured products selling for three to four times
 the value they could command on the international
 market. Moreover, the US Embassy in Beijing reports
 that in some cases China appears to have been able to
 mesh its barter trade with hard currency trade to gain
 advantages from both sides. Some traders in Beijing
 believe that China has been able to get such a good
 rate on the soybeans that it exports to the Soviet
 Union that it has been able to justify hard currency
 imports of soybeans from the United States.
 We expect border trade will continue to rise and could
 offer a significant new source of trade growth if
 China's relatively less-developed western provinces-
 which cannot compete with the exports of the coastal
 cities-take full advantage of increased trading au-
 tonomy.' Border trade is still relatively small-ac-
 counting for approximately 3 percent of total trade-
 but has grown rapidly since it was permitted to
 resume in 1982. Reciprocal trading offices opened in
 Heilongjiang Province and Siberia in 1985 and will
 help expand the trade and-despite an apparent
 impasse-additional offices in Xinjiang Autonomous
 Region and Kazakhstan appear to be in the offing.
 In the next few years, we believe China may look
 outside the barter mechanism in its trade with the
 Soviet Union if it encounters difficulty supplying the
 enormous volume of goods-at quality and prices
 acceptable to Moscow-that will be needed to pay for
 both trade and planned Soviet technical assistance.
 Although theoretically balanced, the recent growth in
 Sino-Soviet trade provided Beijing with a surplus until
 1986, when imports of Soviet goods outweighed Chi-
 nese exports to the Soviet Union by an estimated $200
 million. The planned import of capital goods and
 technical assistance most likely will continue this
 trend. Although the current five-year goods exchange
 and payments agreement permits Beijing to balance
 the import of capital goods and technical assistance
 over a multiyear period, the Chinese approached
 Talyzin during his September visit about the possibili-
 ty of obtaining Soviet concessionary loans. According
 to Soviet Deputy Counselor for Economic Affairs
 A. V. Goryunov, the Soviet side responded that,
 although in principle such loans are possible, they
 could only be discussed in a specific context
 2 Border trade represents trading over and above that controlled by
 the annual bilateral agreements. During Talyzin's visit in Septem-
 ber 1986, both sides agreed to liberalize border trade to allow trade
 of locally produced goods. Previously, most trade was channeled
 through central trade organizations that concentrated on delivering
 manufactured goods from factories in the interior areas. Now,
 according to the Soviet Embassy in Beijing, border areas are
 allowed to trade directly at the provincial /autonomous region level.
 Provinces not on the border are also permitted to trade goods
 through the border provinces.

 We estimate that Sino-Soviet trade reached $2.4
 billion in 1986, sufficient to raise the Soviet Union to
 the position of China's sixth-largest trading partner.
 Moscow's nearly 4 -percent share of total trade still
 falls well behind the shares of Japan (27 percent),
 Hong Kong (22 percent), and the United States (11
 percent), however. China's share of total Soviet trade
 is even lower; in 1985 it amounted to slightly over 1
 percent.
 Under annual trade protocols, the Chinese exchange
 nonferrous metals, agricultural goods, textiles, and
 light industrial products with the Soviets for other
 nonferrous metals, steel, pig iron, urea, automobiles,
 logs, aircraft, and helicopters. The Soviets, presum-
 ably with low-priced equipment, are now entering the
 extremely competitive market for locomotive sales to
 China. A Soviet official told US Embassy officers in
 Beijing that China recently agreed to buy 200 Soviet
 electric locomotives for about $250 million.
 Sino-Soviet trade is conducted almost entirely on a
 barter basis. Negotiators from both sides meet annu-
 ally at yearend to determine any imbalances in trade,
 which must then be settled by the end of the first
 quarter of the subsequent year.
 China is also increasing its science and technology
 contacts ' with the Soviet Union, although movement
 in this sphere has been less rapid than in the trade
 area. Many of the bilateral S&T activities are also
 managed by the Joint Commission on Trade, Eco-
 nomics, Science, and Technology (JCTEST)-the
 same commission that oversees Sino-Soviet trade-
 but negotiators have had more difficulty agreeing on
 the scope and direction of technical and scientific
 exchanges than on commodity trade. An indication of
 ' Chinese statements use the term technology loosely, generally
 referring to both the knowledge and equipment used in production
 processes-separately referred to as technology software and hard-
 the strong prospects for bilateral S&T activities,
 however, is the separate Soviet office opened in
 Beijing in March 1986 to oversee technical coopera-
 tion projects between the two countries. The office,
 headed by Deputy Counselor for Economic Affairs A.
 V. Goryunov, has a staff of eight and may be
 expanded to 20 as technical cooperation develops. In
 discussions with US Embassy officials, Goryunov
 sharply distinguished his office's activities from those
 of the Soviet Embassy Trade Representative's Office,
 which handles bilateral barter trade.
 The Soviets have also beefed up the staff of the
 science section of their Embassy, which generally
 handles cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese
 Academies of Science and between the countries'
 State Science and Technology Commissions. Moscow
 increased the number of officers in the science section
 from three to seven, and reportedly intends to further
 enlarge the staff to 10 persons when space and
 housing become available. Even more significant,
 Moscow dispatched a new Science Counselor to head
 the section. The counselor, A. N. Bykov, has impres-
 sive educational credentials (including work at Massa-
 chusetts Institute of Technology and Columbia Uni-
 versity) as well as important connections in the Soviet
 bureaucracy; he has pushed the evolving Sino-Soviet
 S&T relationship much more energetically than his
 predecessor, according to the US Embassy in Beijing,
 and appears to be targeting areas for future coopera-
 tion that will yield scientific as well as political
 benefits for Moscow.
 Beijing and Moscow signed a broad agreement on
 technical cooperation through 1990 during Yao's
 visit, and subsequent contacts have filled in the
 specifics:
 ? During Arkhipov's visit in March 1986, Soviet and
 Chinese officials discussed general sectors rather
 than specific projects in which the Soviets would
 provide equipment and technical advice for the
 renovation of 17 Chinese factories and the construc-
 tion of seven new facilities.

 ? In September 1986, during Talyzin's trip to Beijing,
 specific projects were tentatively agreed upon, ac-
 cording to Goryunov. According to the Soviet diplo-
 mat, details, timetables, and locations have been
 worked out for all but 10 of the projects. Most are in
 energy or heavy industry and are located in north-
 east China.
 According to the Soviet Embassy in Beijing, Talyzin
 also discussed the possibility of Sino-Soviet joint
 ventures directly between enterprises, rather than
 managed by the two governments. Although no spe-
 cific projects were raised, the scope for such joint
 ventures appears limited to Soviet provision of raw
 materials for the Chinese to process into finished
 goods for reexport to the Soviet Union, according to
 the US Embassy in Beijing.
 Apart from the technical cooperation covered by the
 1985 accord, Beijing and Moscow have agreed to
 several other joint projects. In the largest Sino-Soviet
 contract in recent years, China is buying 10 Soviet
 coal-fired thermal power generators for $500 million
 for use in four power stations. Two other projects may
 be independent of the accord as well: a coal mine in
 Heilongjiang and an electric transmission line along
 the Beijing-Tianjin corridor. According to Goryunov,
 100 Soviet technicians have been sent to China for the
 latter project."
 Cooperation in the nuclear energy field, however, has
 not materialized, although the Soviets continue to
 play up the possibility. In June 1986, Chinese nuclear
 energy officials visited Moscow to discuss possible
 bilateral activities. The trip, agreed to in March 1986,
 did not yield any concrete accords, no doubt reflecting
 diminished Chinese interest following the Chernobyl'
 accident.
 Progress was also made in 1986 in planning for future
 cooperative scientific exchanges and joint research:
 ? In June, the Chinese and Soviet Academies of
 Science signed a five-year cooperation agreement
 that provides for exchanges of research personnel
 The Soviets and the Chinese are discussing technical cooperation
 in up to 28 projects in such sectors as energy (15), metallurgy (5),
 transportation (1), chemicals (3), and general industry (4).F_
 and publications in the natural and physical sci-
 ences. The Soviet Science Counselor in Beijing
 mentioned biotechnology as one area of cooperative
 activities, according to US Embassy reporting.
 ? In October, at the first meeting of the S&T Cooper-
 ation Subcommittee of the JCTEST, the Soviet and
 Chinese State Committees for Science and Technol-
 ogy signed a protocol specifying fields for S&T
 cooperation under the general agreement signed
 during Arkhipov's trip in December 1984. Scientists
 from the two countries will work together on agri-
 culture, fisheries, meteorology, nonferrous metallur-
 gy, petrochemicals, machine building, oil and natu-
 ral gas, and railways. The protocol made no mention
 of joint research in two areas earlier proposed by the
 Soviets-space sciences and seismology-indicating    25X1
 Chinese rejection. Bilateral scientific exchanges had
 been taking place for several years before they were
 formalized in the protocol; press reports indicate
 that the two countries exchanged nearly 30 groups
 of specialists between 1982 and 1985.
 ? In October, the Soviet Chamber of Commerce and
 Industry and the Chinese Center for International
 S&T Exchanges signed a memorandum outlining
 future exchanges of information on inventions and
 patents.

 Several of the trade agreements signed in 1986 will
 also contribute to the expansion of S&T exchanges
 between the two countries. In March, during Arkhi-
 pov's visit, a countertrade agreement was signed that
 included a provision for China-for the first time in
 30 years-to repair Soviet merchant and scientific
 research ships in Chinese shipyards. Trade exhibits
 have also provided a forum for exchanges of scientific
 and technical information; the Soviet exhibit in Beij-     25X1
 ing in December included a series of lectures for
 Chinese technical audiences even though the Chinese
 exhibit in Moscow several months earlier had not.
 Finally, the agreement to set up a committee to
 examine the use of common waterways provided a
 framework for technical feasibility studies for possible
 joint projects such as power generation, flood preven-
 tion, and pollution control, according to a Chinese
 diplomat.                                 25X1

 Secret
 S&T Cooperation in Context
 Sino-Soviet cooperation in industrial technology is
 dwarfed by Chinese cooperation with the West in this
 field. The 24 to 28 Sino-Soviet technical cooperation
 projects represent only a fraction of a percent of
 China's foreign technology-assisted projects. Since
 1979 central Chinese trading corporations alone have
 signed approximately 2,500 major contracts for
 Western equipment and technical assistance; together
 with those signed by provincial and municipal au-
 thorities, technology import contracts exceeded
 13,000.
 Sino-Soviet technical cooperation also involves a
 comparatively small number of technical personnel.
 Several hundred Soviet technicians will probably
 work in China on the new projects; more than 10,000
 Western technicians have supervised China's use of
 imported Western technology in the last two years
 alone.
 In dollar terms, however, Sino-Soviet technical co-
 operation may be more significant. In 1986 the Soviet
 Union became China's fourth-largest technology sup-
 plier, after France, Japan, and the United States,
 according to Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations
 and Trade Statistics. The value of Sino-Soviet tech-
 nology contracts signed in 1986 reached $512 million
 and accounted for 11.5 percent of China's total
 technology contracts. If Soviet estimates are correct
 and the USSR supplies China with more than $2
 billion worth of equipment and technical services
 under the 1985 accord by the end of the decade-and
 if additional contracts outside the accord are
 signed-Soviet technology will account for roughly
 10 percent of China's technology imports through
 1990.
 Sino-Soviet scientific cooperation is similarly dwarf-
 ed by China's formal S& T cooperation with Western
 countries. Beijing has signed 27 S& T protocols with
 the United States alone, covering such fields as
 telecommunications, nuclear safety, high-energy
 physics, and seismology. China has similarly exten-
 sive bilateral S& T protocol arrangements with the
 United Kingdom, West Germany, Sweden, and many
 other Western countries.
 Although recent agreements on Sino-Soviet technical
 cooperation are a major upswing from the bilateral
 economic relationship of the last 25 years, they
 remain modest by 1950s'standards. During the hey-
 day of Sino-Soviet cooperation, the Soviets assisted
 in the construction of several hundred Chinese indus-
 trial and energy facilities, in contrast with the 24 to
 28 planned over the next five years. Similarly, be-
 tween 1950 and 1960, Moscow sent 11,000 techni-
 cians to work or teach in China, compared to the
 several hundred likely to assist with Chinese projects
 over the next five years; Beijing sent nearly 30,000
 scientists, technicians, and workers to the USSR
 during the 1950s, but will probably send only several
 hundred for current projects.

 Secret
 Future Growth
 We believe scientific and technical cooperation will
 grow as these agreements are implemented. Accord-
 ing to a Soviet diplomat, roughly one-third of the
 value of Sino-Soviet trade from 1986 through 1990
 will be related to technical cooperation. Bilateral
 technical cooperation will probably involve several
 hundred Soviet advisers sent to China and an equal
 number of Chinese technicians sent to the USSR for
 training.
 In our judgment, Beijing will be particularly interest-
 ed in Soviet technology in the energy and heavy
 industry sectors. In some areas-for example thermal
 power, open pit mining, hydroelectric generation, and
 long-distance electric transmission-Soviet technol-
 ogy is on a par with that available from Western
 countries. Beijing also is likely to seek Soviet assis-
 tance in modernizing Soviet-designed heavy industry
 facilities where it has been unable to attract Western
 investment. Water resource management is another
 area where joint activities are likely to develop.F_
 Beijing and Moscow will probably continue to sign
 contracts for bilateral technical cooperation projects
 outside of the 1985 accord. Moscow will probably
 reiterate its interest in joint ventures directly between
 Chinese and Soviet enterprises, but we believe Beijing
 will want Sino-Soviet technical cooperation to remain
 scientific cooperation. Beijing has, for example, ex-
 pressed interest in Soviet mathematics, physics, and
 geophysics. We believe, however, that Beijing will
 continue to refuse Soviet overtures to cooperate in the
 space sciences and seismology, areas in which military
 and civilian research are intertwined. Similarly, Chi-
 na will closely monitor the exchange of scientists to
 ensure that Soviet experts are kept away from sensi-
 tive areas.
 Constraints. In our opinion, two other factors will
 constrain cooperation in the S&T area. First, China is
 reevaluating its policy on the import and use of
 foreign technology, becoming more selective in the
 process.' Beijing still prefers Western technology, and
 considers Soviet technology not only inferior, but also
 no easier to absorb in cases where it is incompatible
 with Western equipment introduced in recent years.
 Second, China does not want to create concern in the
 West about Sino-Soviet cooperation in this area.
 China calculates that such fears would jeopardize its
 access to the technology it seeks and delay, if not
 reverse, the gradual easing of US and multilateral
 export controls. To allay concerns in the West, China
 has been careful to restrict Soviet access to sophisti-
 cated Western hardware it already has.'
 subject to government oversight.
 Exchanges of research literature and patent informa-
 tion will grow as a result of the agreement concluded
 in 1986, and China may pursue additional areas of
 A Soviet consular official in December 1986 anticipated his country
 would send 2,000 technicians by 1990. And a Western newspaper
 Movement in this area has not been as striking as the
 growth of trade and S&T ties, but we believe that
 atmospheric changes are taking place here as well.
 The number of venues and the level of contact suggest
 that, although Moscow and Beijing may be agreeing
 on very little, the sessions are no longer quite the
 "dialogue of the deaf" that a Chinese diplomat
 citing Soviet sources indicated 100 Soviet experts would be sent to
 China over the next few years. We believe this latter figure is
 conservative, especially if the Soviet diplomat's contention that 100
 Soviets are already working on construction of the electric trans-
 mission line is true. More moderate Soviet estimates have suggested
 that 500 to 600 Soviet technicians will go to China, with the bulk
 going in the period 1988-89. Beijing has said only that it expects
 "several hundred" Soviet technicians to be involved in the technical
 cooperation program.

 described following the frosty eighth round of normal-
 ization talks in Moscow in April 1986. Although both
 parties have an interest in keeping Washington uncer-
 tain about where their relationship is going (without,
 however, disrupting relations with client states and
 important friends), more than posturing seems to be
 going on.
 Old Venues
 The Chinese and Soviet Foreign Ministers have held
 annual consultations at the opening of the United
 Nations General Assembly in September for the past
 three years. At the most recent session, Chinese
 Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian reportedly surprised
 Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze by proposing
 and authorizing the announcement of a resumption in
 February 1987 of border talks suspended in 1978.
 Wu's move followed Gorbachev's unprecedented pub-
 lic statement in Vladivostok of Moscow's willingness
 to use the main channel of the Heilong/Amur River
 as the line of demarcation along one stretch of the
 border. The vice foreign ministerial-level border talks
 are expected to be protracted and difficult, because of
 differences over defining main channels for the
 Heilong/Amur and Wusuli/Ussuri Rivers, resolving
 ownership of the islands at the confluence of the rivers
 opposite the Soviet city of Khabarovsk, and deciding
 which ridge in the Pamir Mountains was agreed to as
 the border in a 19th-century treaty. Beijing's proposal
 to resume the talks despite the absence of progress on
 the three obstacles, however, suggests the Chinese
 have decided at least to appear flexible to encourage
 additional Soviet concessions.
 Gorbachev's hints of flexibility in his Vladivostok
 speech of 28 July 1986, plus the announcement of
 plans to unilaterally withdraw one division along with
 some smaller units from Mongolia, breathes new life
 into the normalization talks, which after eight rounds
 had become stale. At the ninth round, held in Beijing
 in October 1986, the new Soviet chief negotiator,
 Deputy Foreign Minister Rogachev, agreed to place
 the Cambodian obstacle on the agenda for the first
 time, but no progress was made as Moscow insisted
 that the Chinese must take the matter up with the
 Vietnamese directly. We do not expect any significant
 developments in the 10th round, which begins in April
 1987 in Moscow, but the talks are now the prime
 venue at which Beijing can probe the limits of Soviet
 flexibility in eliminating the first of the three
 obstacles
 New Wrinkles
 These two developments are supplemented by three
 others. In September 1986, China and the Soviet
 Union concluded the first new consular agreement
 since 1962, when each side closed all its consulates in
 the other country. The agreement paved the way for
 the reopening in December of consulates in Leningrad
 and Shanghai. It also set the stage for negotiations to
 improve visa reciprocity and better protection for the
 rights of Soviet citizens in China-both of which
 should make life easier for Soviet technicians assigned
 to help with Chinese development projects. Beijing
 will probably allow Moscow to open a new consulate
 in the northeast in 1988 (with China opening a
 consulate in the Soviet Far East in return), but is
 tying Soviet requests to reopen its consulate in
 Guangzhou to a general improvement in political
 relations. China has refused even to discuss Moscow's
 request to reopen its old post in Urumqi.
 In May 1986, China and the Soviet Union signed a
 two-year cultural cooperation agreement calling for
 exchanges in the fields of science, education, culture,

 art, information, radiobroadcasting, and television.
 Under this accord, the two nations' official news
 agencies, Xinhua and TASS, concluded a journalistic
 exchange agreement in December. In addition, recip-
 rocal visits by special touring groups of friendship,
 medical, theatrical, cinematic, and musical officials
 have picked up over the past year. The two sides in
 1987 plan to exchange 200 students, the same number
 as in 1986. The cultural exchanges will probably
 increase, and the heightened concern in Beijing about
 the spread of Western values in China may lead to
 some increase in the number of students sent to the
 Soviet Union.
 Perhaps the most interesting development is the ex-
 panding bilateral dialogue. For the first time, high-
 level Soviet officials in 1986 visited Beijing-on three
 separate occasions-to present Moscow's position on
 US-Soviet arms control negotiations. The Chinese
 subsequently informed the US Embassy in Beijing
 that the first two briefings were "empty and long,"
 and characterized the third as not overly informative.
 At the same time, however, the Chinese took care to
 say that both US and Soviet briefings have been
 useful. This characterization of the briefing may have
 been offered to encourage Washington to expand its
 own briefing program for China. Meanwhile, the
 Chinese have noted to the US Embassy that both
 Rogachev and new Soviet Ambassador Oleg Troyan-
 ovskiy are more open-but no more flexible-than
 their predecessors.
 According to Chinese foreign ministry officials speak-
 ing to US Embassy officers in Beijing, the Chinese
 and Soviets have held "frank" discussions of regional
 issues and-as recently as January 1987-consulta-
 tions on the Middle East at the senior working level.
 The director's of Moscow's Institute of the USA and
 Canada (IUSAC) and Beijing's Institute of Contem-
 porary International Relations (ICIR) lectured at one
 another's institutes in October 1985 and September
 1986, respectively, in an exchange of visits. The
 deputy director of IUSAC subsequently visited Beij-
 ing in November 1986, and we expect ICIR's deputy
 director to reciprocate. The Chinese, however, have
 expressed reservations about collaborating on a regu-
 lar basis.
 We believe Beijing has also decided to maintain an
 atmosphere conducive to its broadened contacts, pass-
 ing up opportunities to blacken the Soviet eye. For
 instance, Beijing chose not to play up either the killing
 of a Chinese officer in a shooting incident between
 Soviet and Chinese patrols in July 1986 on the Soviet
 border with Xinjiang Autonomous Region or the
 errant landing of an unarmed Soviet submarine-
 launched missile near the Heilong/Amur River in
 September, even after the incidents were widely publi-
 All of these developments over the last two years raise
 questions about whether Beijing has changed or is
 changing its assessment that the Soviet Union poses
 the principal threat to China. For a variety of reasons
 beyond the frequent reassurances offered by top
 Beijing believes the Soviet Union is concentrating on
 rebuilding its economy and defending the gains it
 made in the 1970s before resuming the offensive early
 in the next century. At that time, Moscow will once
 again increase the military pressure on China to bend
 Beijing's policies to Moscow's will. This Chinese

 the merit of these accusations, they indicate that Beijing still does

 A US Ace: Growing Defense Cooperation
 With Beijing
 No single element better exemplifies the qualitative
 difference in Sino-Soviet and Sino-US relations than
 the deepening military ties between Beijing and
 Washington:
 ? Senior Soviet and Chinese military exchanges end-
 ed in 1958, whereas, since 1983, the Chinese have
 hosted two visits by the US Secretary of Defense
 and sent their Minister of Defense in 1984 and
 Chief of General Staff in 1986---as well as numer-
 ous lower ranking officers-to visit Washington
 and tour the United States.
 ? The last Soviet naval port call to China occurred in
 1956; whereas, US and Chinese warships steamed
 together in January 1986, Beijing hosted its first
 US port call at Qingdao in November 1986 and the
 Chinese Navy may pay its first American port call
 to Honolulu in 1988.
 contract for artillery-locating radars.
 ? Beijing buys a few military transport helicopters
 from the Soviet Union each year but recently
 contracted its first major Foreign Military Sales
 (FMS) purchases from the United States, signing a
 $500 million deal for 55 avionics packages for
 China's F-8 fighter aircraft and a $62 million

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/07/09: CIA-RDP04T00907R000200070001-4
 judgment is given substance in Beijing's continuing
 and determined military modernization program de-
 signed to meet the long-term Soviet threat." More-
 over, China has shown no indication of backing away
 from its relationship with the United States, which is
 deeper and growing faster than Sino-Soviet ties.
 Indeed, it is the military relationship with Washing-
 ton-and its attendant military technology transfer
 component-that Beijing is most interested in
 expanding."
 What has changed is how China has chosen to
 manage the threat posed by the Soviet Union. We
 think a number of things account for Beijing's deci-
 sion to move forward without real Soviet concessions
 on the three obstacles. Underlying everything, of
 course, is Beijing's judgment that its reform program,
 including the ambitious military modernization drive,
 cannot succeed unless tensions with Moscow are
 lowered and China is left free to concentrate on
 rebuilding the country. Thus the recent growth is to
 some degree an attempt to manage tensions by allow-
 ing movement in selected areas while continuing to
 improve China's military capabilities against the
 Soviet Union. On another level, there is also obvious
 economic and S&T benefit to China in expanding
 relations in these areas. And, we believe China calcu-
 lates that measured improvements in Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions increases leverage with Washington in the stra-
 tegic triangle, and, perhaps more important, creates
 tension in Soviet-Vietnamese relations by feeding
 existing fears in Hanoi about Soviet reliability.
 In our opinion, these reasons do not adequately
 explain the changes we have seen in the last two years,
 and we believe there are more powerful explanations.
 We believe China is reacting to the rise of Gorbachev
 and his interest in Asian issues and his new style.
 Under Brezhnev and Gromyko, China knew there was
 little prospect for improvement, and Soviet style and
 behavior made it easy to rebuff Moscow without
 appearing to be intransigent. Gorbachev's style calls
 for a different tactic, but Chinese leaders also believe
 that Gorbachev sincerely desires better relations. We
 believe the expansion of the political venues, in partic-
 ular, represents a Chinese effort to probe the limits of
 Gorbachev's flexibility.
 The other force that we believe is driving Sino-Soviet
 relations is the expansion of US-China relations,
 particularly the growth of military ties. It does so in
 two ways. More visible, deeper Sino-US relations
 increase the pressure on Beijing to demonstrate to the
 Third World that it truly pursues an independent
 foreign policy. Beijing does so by roughly balancing
 US and Soviet visits, and increasing ties to Moscow
 where it can. And, we believe, China calculates that
 the bounds of what is permissible in Sino-Soviet
 relations also grow as the Sino-US ties deepen.
 For all these reasons, we believe Sino-Soviet relations
 are entering a period that will see additional move-
 ment. In particular, we would expect to see further
 growth in economic relations, and the political dia-
 logue may also broaden. As with China's relations
 with the West, progress is likely to be uneven and
 unsteady. We believe China's perception of Gorba-
 chev, his motives, and power will be a key factor in
 how Sino-Soviet relations unfold.
 changed.
 Perhaps even more important in this regard will be
 China's perception of the reaction in the West and the
 United States in particular. Repeated efforts by
 Chinese leaders to reassure Washington that Beijing
 continues to view Moscow as a threat indicate to the
 United States that Chinese concern about a possible
 negative US reaction inhibits Sino-Soviet relations.
 Deng Xiaoping, for example, chose to air his hardline
 response to Gorbachev's Vladivostok initiatives on
 American television in an interview with Mike
 Wallace, and expressions of concern about Sino-
 Soviet relations made by US Congressmen have made
 an impression on Chinese leaders. Vigorous criticism
 of Soviet foreign policy and the continued stress on
 the three obstacles are also meant to reassure the
 West that China's view of the Soviet threat has not
