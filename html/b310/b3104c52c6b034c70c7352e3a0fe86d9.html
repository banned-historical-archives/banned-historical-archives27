 CS/PRES BRIEFING FOR
 Conference of Emergency
 Petroleum and Gas Administration
 (EPGA) Shoreham Hotel, 0930-1030
 I.   As a rule we do not discuss our operations, but
 I would like to tell you, before Ramparts Magazine
 does, that another one of our efforts is about to
 be exposed.
 A.   The Soviets have finally managdd to decipher
 some old scrolls they found in the part of
 Eastern Turkey that was once Armenia.
 B.   The scrolls apparently contain a deposition
 from a couple of snakes that at-,the instigation
 of CIA, a shipmaster named Noah subverted a
 sub-sonic dove to carry out an aerial reconnaissance
 mission  over territory near the present borders
 of the Soviet Union.
 II.   A lot of important information today is no more
 classified than the fact that the waters were receding
 at the end of the Biblical flood. But when that informa-
 tion has been evaluated by our intelligence services,
 and matched up with other information obtained by
 sensitive methods, we have to classify it "SECRET."
 A.   So from our point of view, the information I am
 going to discuss with you today is "SECRET," and
 you will see that classification on some of the

 Approved For Release 2000/08/07 : CIA-RDP79TOOWA000800010001-8
 illustrations I will be using, but iw actually
 iwuvwthe classification applies only to the
 fact that this information came from--and
 represents the analysis of--the Central
 Intelligence Agency.
 III.   I propose to start with the Soviet Union and Communist
 China, and then survey the trouble spots and potential
 trouble spots elsewhere in the world.
 A.   There is a lot of ground to cover, so I will
 dispense with any further introductory remarks.

 Military
 I.   The armed forces of the Soviet Union have been
 engaged for several years in a dynamic program
 of research and development, looking for some
 kind of a breakthrough which would end the
 present nuclear stalemate and swing the balance
 of power in favor of the Soviet Union.
 A.   They have not achieved any such breakthrough,
 and we have no indications that they may be on
 the verge of one.
 B.   They are, however, achieving improvements
 across the board in their strategic offensive
 capabilities, in their defensive posture, and
 even in their general purpose forces.
 C.   They remain behind the United States in the
 number of warheads each can deliver on the
 territory of the other.
 1.   There is a new deployment program in
 progress for intercontinental ballistic
 missiles, however, which represents a
 Soviet effort to catch up numerically.
 D.      At the same time, as you may have seen in
 the accounts of Secretary McNamara's congressional
 testimony, the Soviets are deploying a defensive
 system around Moscow designed to intercept
 incoming ballistic missiles.

 Approved For Release 2000/08/07 : CIA-RDP79T00$27A000800010001-8
 1.   We dornot consider this a very effective
 system.   It can be fooled, and it can be
 overwhelmed.   Also, insofar as defenses
 intended primarily to intercept ballistic
 missiles are concerned, we know of none
 anywhere else in the Soviet Union except
 around Moscow.
 2.   The rest of the country is still concerned
 with defending itself adequately against
 things like manned bombers and air-to-surface
 stand-off missiles like our HOUND DOG.
 E.   But I think the important conclusion to be drawn
 from everything that we know about the Soviet
 military establishment is this:
 F.   The Soviets continue to increase their military
 budget, their effort to achieve a major breakthrough,
 and their general improvement of military posture.
 1.   Over the next few years, these improvements
 are going to give the Soviet leaders increasing
 confidence that they are creating their own
 effective deterrent, in the form of a military
 establishment whichcould undergo nuclear attack,
 and come through with enough punch left to
 destroy a significant portion of the population
 and resources of the United States.
 2.   We doinot believe that the Soviets themselves
 expect to be strong enough--even over the next

 Approved For Reluse 2000/08/07 : CIA-RDP79T00$2,7A000800010001-8
 of a war against the United States.
 3.   Such growing confidence in their offensive and
 defensive capabilities, however, is kke one
 of the factors which can lead to disastrous
 miscalculations when nations are trying to
 face each other down at the brink of a war
 which no one may want.
 4.   It makes it necessary to maintain a continuing
 watch on the men who now lead the Soviet Union,
 their abilities, and their policies.
 The Soviet Leadership
 I. The men who threw out Khrushchev more than to
 years ago have now had time to establish their
 policies, their relationships, and their method
 of operation.
 A.   What has emerged is essentially a collective
 leadership.
 1.   There has been a steady enlargement in
 the position of the Party feneral Secre-
 tary, Leonid Brezhnev.
 2.   The present leaders, however, are a blend
 of mixed interests and authority.  They
 have held together remarkably well, but
 they have done it with undramatic,
 Approved For Release 2000/08/07 : CIA-RDP79T00827A000800010001-8
 Approved For Relgse 2000/08/07 : CIA-RDP79T00$,y7A000800010001-8
 middle-of-the-road policies. The
 guiding principle appears to be: "Don't
 rock the boat."
 B.   Decisions are determined by compromise, and
 implemented with caution.
 1.   This avoids the erratic initiatives of
 Khrushchev's time, and minimizes the
 risk of major failures.
 C.   The present leadership has not vet demonstrated,
 however, that it has designed a durable
 governmental machinery which can make the
 hard decisions and still avoid the tendency
 toward the one-man rule of the Stalin and
 Khrushchev eras.
 1.   Such highly political problems as economic
 reform and resource allocation have not
 been resolved.
 2.   And while the Kremlin outwardly maintains
 an image of collective leadership, the subtle
 struggle for power and position continues.
 D.   Nevertheless, I should point out at this juncture
 that "not rocking the boat" in no senses implies
 any weakening of the major thrust of Soviet foreign
 policy--the extension of Russian influence beyond
 the borders of the Soviet Union.

 Soviet Economy
 II.       The Soviet economy in some ways symbolizes this
 temporizing on the part of the leadership.   The
 same problems are still there; reforms are being
 attempted cautiously and gradually.   As an example,
 1.   The cold war did not end with the fall of
 Khrushchev, or the Cuban missile crisis, or the
 nuclear test ban treaty, or the Sino-Soviet dis-
 pute, or any of the other hopeful developments
 of the past few years.
 2.   Rather it has changed its character as the full
 meaning of the nuclear stalemate becomes apparent
 to the Soviet leadership.   It is more political,
 more subtle, and slower moving.
 3.   But the goals remain the same.   Marxism-Leninism
 is still taught in the schools, and still forms
 the thinking of the Pelitburo.
 4.   The low-keyed style of government under Brezhnev
 and Kosygin is probably better suited to the cold
 war as it is now fought than Khrushchev's flam-
 boyance.   They are inching forward along tested
 lines of policy to reduce our power and influence
 wherever they can do so, just as their predeces-
 sors did, and perhaps more effectively.

 the U.S.S.R. is already in the second year of
 a  Five-Year Plan period, and the plan has not
 yet been put in final form and approved.
 CHART, COMPARATIVE GNP GROWTH
 ik.   The Soviet economy is somewhat less than half
 the size of ours, and the Soviet Cross National
 Product in 1966 was about 4S percent of the
 U.S.  CNP.
 1.  The CNP growth rate in Russia last year
 was 7 1/2 percent, but this was due to
 the largest grain crop in Soviet history.
 2.  The average growth rate of the preceding
 five years was 4 1/2 percent, and the
 outlook from now through 1970 is for
 about 4 to 5 1/2 percent increase each
 year.
 CHART, ABSOLUTE DIFFERENCE IN GNP
 3.   Incidentally, the present leaders of the
 Soviet Union are apparently too realistic to
 continue Khrushchev's boasting about overtaking
 the United States, and this chart shows why:
 4.   Even when the Soviet growth rate matches ours,
 the absolute increase in GNP in the Soviet Union
 is much smaller, because the percentage is on
 a smaller base. As a result, they are not
 reducing the absolute gap between the two
 economies.   If anything, it is growing.

 CHARTi  U.S. and SOVIET GNP BY END USE
 5.   Bodeen We cannot, however, just write off the
 Soviet economy as an element of national power,
 because they allocate their national product by
 entirely different ground rules.
 6.   The Soviet population is about 20 percent bigger
 than ours, but the consumer has to be satisfied
 with only one third of ghe goods that our economy
 produces for the consumer here.
 7.   Because of this, with an economy barely half the
 size of ours, Soviet expenditures for defense
 approach our own.

 will give the military establishment whatever
 is considered necessary by the Kremlin for

 Military Expenditures
 III.    Soviet spending for military purposes and space
 remained fairly stable from 1962 through 1965, but
 it increased an estimated 7 percent in 1966.   It
 appears that another 4 percent will be piled on top

 of last year's increase in 1967.
 A.   The Soviets have announced a military
 budget for 1967 which is the his;hest since
 l'\\'orld !';rir II.   It amounts to 14.5 billion
 rubles--an increase of 1.1 billion over
 the published figures for 1966.
 1.   The announced defense budget,  however
 includes only about 60 percent of the
 actual military expenditures.
 2. !;e estimate that total Soviet defense
 spending in 1967 will be about 19.8
 billion rubles, or about 54 billion
 dollars in comparable terms.
 CHART,..SPENDING FOR ADVANCED WEAPONS AND R&D
 11. Soviet spending for advanced military and
 space syster.ms--and particularly for Research
 and Development--is growing much faster than
 the total defense budget.
 1. As this chart shows, it more than doubled
 between 1958 and 1966.
 2. These programs demand the best and
 scarcest resources in plant, material,
 and skilled technology.   The military
 demand for these resources highlights
 the whole resource allocation problem in
 the Soviet Union.   But we expect that the

 Soviet Relations With the United States                     off
 IV.   I want to touch on just two facets of Soviet
 foreign policy--Soviet relations with the United
 States, and the Sino-Sovict dispute.
 V.   On the question of relations with the United
 States, the public stance of the Soviet leaders
 at present is that it is difficult to make any
 progress in resolving issues with a nation which
 is attacking their Communist brethren in North
 Vietnam.
 A. This position is dictated to a degree by the
 role which support of the North Vietnamese
 has come to play in the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 1.   It is also, of course, a handy pretext
 by which the Russians can require the
 overtures to come from us.
 G. In fact, however, there has been some progress
 on issues not affecting Vietnam--for instance,
 the recent civil air and space agreements, and
 the indications that it may be possible to
 agree on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
 C. In private, Soviet leaders have used numerous
 opportunities to emphasize that they want to

 avoid any showdown with Washington over the
 Vietnamese issue.
 D.    The Kremlin leaders realize that if there is
 going; to be any meaningful progress along the
 lines of their national interests in such
 matters as European security, arms control,
 and East-West trade, sooner or later they are
 going to have to resume the dialogue with the
 United States.
 No doubt IWw~ the Soviet leaders are
 delighted to see the United States bogged
 down in Southeast Asia, and bM   +?IL_;G will
 continue to give the North Vietnamese any
 aid which involves no maior risk for the
 Soviet Union.
 F.   They do not, however, wish a direct Soviet-U.S.
 confrontation, and it is clear that they want
 to keep their lines of communication with
 Washington open and working.
 The Sino-Soviet Dispute
 VI.   As for the Sino-Soviet dispute, the dominating
 factor in Soviet foreign policy today is that
 relations between Moscow and Peking have hit
 rock bottom.

 A.   The Chinese have done their best in recent
 weeks to goad Moscow into making a full
 diplomatic break.
 1.  In mid-February, Peking eased up a bit
 on some of the harassing tactics,
 but the Chinese had already demonstrated
 that they had it in their power to force
 every last Russian out of Peking---and
 they can exert that power at a moment's
 notice.
 2.   Each side would prefer not to take the
 final step in breaking diplomatic
 relations, but the Soviets probably have
 the most to lose.
 3.   A complete break could greatly complicate
 Moscow's problems in getting military aid
 through China to North Vietnam.
 4.   Virtually all Russian arms aid has taken
 this overland route, largely because of
 Soviet reluctance to risk a confrontation
 with the U. S. on the high seas.
 B.   If the Chinese can force the Soviets to break
 relations, they can then charge that the Soviets
 are to blame For any interruption in the delivery
 of military aid to North Vietnam.

 unwillingness to use the alternate sea
 route, charging the Russians with cowardice.
 2.   The Chinese probably believe that in a pinch
 the Soviets would still refuse to ship by sea,
 and thus would discredit themselves in Hanoi.
 C.   Moscow is preparing for the worst, carefully
 documenting the record in an effort to blame
 Peking if aid to Hanoi is disrupted.
 1.   An official Soviet statement on February 9
 accused Peking of "preventing the solution
 of concrete questions," and Moscow has pub-
 lished charges that the Chinese are diverting,
 sabotaging, or re-labeling Soviet war materiel
 passing through China to North Vietnam.
 2.   Soviet propaganda media have blamed Chinese
 intransigence for the resumption of U.S.
 bombing on February 14.

 A.   You have all seen pictures, I'm sure, of
 swarms of Chinese teen-agers marching
 through the streets or across  the country-
 side, holding little books from which they
 chant quotations from Mao Tse-tung.
 R.   This is what is known as "Mao's thoughts."
 In China today, they are credited with almost
 miraculous power, although for the most part
 they are a collection of tired old cliches
 like "all power comes out of the barrel of a
 gun," or "be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and
 and surmount every difficulty to win victory."

 C.  Even the Russians, who have been known to quote
 Marx and Lenin, find 'Tao's thought a bit silly.
 Pravda cited the case of a Chinese who commented
 that if a man didn't know how to climb a pole,
 studying "Tao's thoughts would hardly help
 him do it.   The man was denounced and purged
 because everybody in China knows that "a study
 of Chairman Mao's work gives immediate results."
 1.   Chou En-lai's wife recently stated that
 doctors successfully sewed back a ringer
 which had been cut off because they had
 studied Mao's thought.
 2.   A forestry conference in Pekin;,, concluded
 that the study of Mao would enable the
 forestry service to grow better trees.
 3.   Peking Radio says that fighter pilots
 shouted quotations from 'Tao over the
 intercom as they started a dog-fight, and
 were therefore able to shoot down a
 Chinese Nationalist aircraft.
 4.   And according to the Chinese Communist
 news agency, a Lanchou worker who broke
 an arm, a leg, and several ribs in a fall
 refused sick leave,,because Mao's thought
 enabled him to live with his pain.
 II.   To us, it sounds ridiculous, but for the Chinese it
 is in deadly earnest.   A street mob recently forced

 and ridiculed him when he fluffed a line.
 Chinese Political Developments
 (CHART, CHICOM POLITICAL LEADERSHIP)
 t-     r  enlatr^rr..`n   7 Gad
 A.     Mao, at 73,        is aging,  sick, and more and
 more inflexible.
 1.    He is clearly concerned that his Com-
 munist Party is losing the revolu-
 tionary zeal of its early days, and
 cannot be relied on to keep China on
 the right track after he is gone.
 2.    The teen-aged millions of the Red Guard
 are supposed to re-kindle that zeal
 with their youthful and unbridled en-
 thusiasm.
 B.   To Mao Tse-tung,  the cultural revolution
 is             primarily a drive to re-shape
 the Communist Party, or replace it with a
 more reliable, more fanatical, and younger
 version.

 C.   But for the men who aspire to succeed Mao,
 it has become a naked struggle for power
 and for survival.
 II.      It is difficult to determine from day to day
 where the cultural revolution stands, who is
 on which side, or who is going to come out on top.
 A.   The prime mover for several months was
 Defense Minister Lin Piao  (Lin Beeow),
 Mao's designated successor.
 1.   As soon as Lin was proclaimed Mao's
 heir-apparent last August, he began
 driving to unseat any potential rivals.
 2.   His immediate targets were the two men
 who have been at the top of the party
 machinery, Chief of State Liu Shao-chi
 (Lyew Shaho-chee) and the general secretary,
 Teng Ilsiao-ping (Dung Sheeow-ping).
 tregarraetmcnT-
 B.                                Subsequent developments, however, suggest that
 Liu may have lost the initiative to Premier
 Chou En-lai (Joe Un-lie).
 1.   Lin hasn't made a major public speech since
 early November, and dropped from public view
 in late November.

 3.   Lin has been in chronic poor health for years,
 and this may have contributed to his apparent
 political decline.
 C.   Chou En-lai, on the other hand, has been the
 dominant figure in Peking in recent weeks.
 1.   He has been issuing directives on how to
 conduct the "cultural revolution," and has
 even been ordering Lin's troops around to
 settle disputes between Red Guards and local
 authorities.
 III.   Early in January, the leadership struggle entered
 a critical phase.
 A.   Evidence began appearing that the army was
 less than monolithic in its loyalty to Mao
 and Lin.
 1.   On January 11, for instance, the cultural
 revolution group which was supposed to be
 purging the military leadership was itself
 purged, and was replaced by a new and
 presumably trustworthy group of 18 men.
 Within a week, however, two or three members
 of this new group were themselves under
 attack on ideological grounds.
 B.   At about the same time, several military commanders
 in crucial positions were denounced for having

 Approved For Ruse 2000/4EC"TP79TOO? 7A000800010001-8
 plotted a coup. They included the commander and
 the political commissar of the Peking garrison,
 the commander of armored forces, a member of the
 party's powerful "lilitary Affairs Committee, and
 a number of key commanders in the provinces.
 C.   A number of top regional party officials were
 accused of having joined in the plot.   The most
 important was Tao Chu (Taho joo) who was both the
 party boss of the Central-South region, in Canton,
 and number four man for a while in the inner circle
 of Peking leaders.   Tao was very active in Peking
 right up to the time of his downfall at the end
 of December.
 1). We don't know the full story, but we suspect that
 'lao and Lin may in fact have had a very close shave
 in December or January.
 E. The opposition aligned against then was a formidable
 group, and it did not give up without a struggle.
 1.   For several weeks after the turn of the year,
 there were disorders throughout China, as Tao's
 opponents incited strikes and riots, and managed
 to disrupt transportation and production.
 F.    It is now evident, however, that the opposition
 has been largely suppressed.   Many of its leaders
 have been arrested, or are in hiding, and Peking
 is working out an accommodation with several
 provincial leaders.

 2.  'lost of the incidents now involve clashes
 between groups of unruly Red Cuards.
 3.  The army has been ordered to bring these
 groups under control, and some of the more
 militant Red Cuard organizations are being
 disbanded.
 00,00
 IV. This return to a mo e orderly situation indicates that
 most key military corn anders remained loyal to the
 present political lead  s in Peking.
 A.   The course of develo, ents indicates, however,
 that their loyalty was secured only after Peking
 shifted to more moderat   tactics in the power
 struggle.
 1.   It is also significant' that in January,
 before the army took an 'ffective role, the
 major responsibility for  'nning the cultural
 revolution shifted to Chou, who is not only
 a competent compromiser, but  ore flexible
 and more reasonable than eithe   `tao or Lin.
 B.   The steam does seem to be going out     the cul-
 tural revolution. Its excesses .:ould b  attributed
 to a considerable degree to the volatil  and unruly
 youngsters who made up the Red Cuard.

 it has been won. The party apparatus is all but

 This would certainly renew the turmoil and
 the infighting among top leaders.
 11e long-range effect of the cultural revolution
 remains up in the air, but there are two points which
 we can make:
 First, until 'lao goes and a new leader has firmly
 consolidated his succession, China's leaders
 will be divided and in conflict.   They will find

 it difficult to agree on any new Policy lines,
 so we do not expect any radical departure from
 existing policies.
 Second,  whoever wins, we can see no reason to expect
 any dilution of Peking's implacable hostility
 toward the United States.
 For some time to come, however, the Chinese Communists
 will probably suffer from a cultural revolution
 hangover that could limit their capacity to engage
 in foreign adventures.

 Chinese Milcmtary
 I.   When the Sino-Soviet split began in 1960, the
 Chinese Communist military establishment amounted
 to a sub-standard, World War II army, a large but
 inferior air force, and a navy consisting largely
 of submarines that didn't venture outside coastal
 waters.
 II.   The withdrawal of Soviet help brought improvement of
 the Chinese forces to ax  complete halt.
 A.   Over the past two years, however, the Chinese
 have regained momentum, and this time they are
 doing it entirely on their own as far as we can
 see, with no help from the Soviets.
 B.   The dominant fact, of course, is that Communist
 China has achieved nuclear status.
 C.   At present, their nuclear weapons, along with
 existing or imminent delivery systems, are crude
 and limited by our standards, but by Far Eastern
 standards they make a great contribution to
 Chinese Communist military prestige.
 III.   Analysis of the five nuclear tests to date suggests
 that the Chinese can probably already package a
 nuclear device# for delivery by their handful of
 aging medium bombers.
 A.   They may be working on one that could be delivered
 by some 250 light jet bombers they have in their
 inventory.

 C.   We believe that the Chinese can probably @op&ogr

 and South Asia are obvious.
 D.   We also think they might be able to 1esmakdeploy
 their first crude ICBMs in the early 1970's.
 1.   It is not beyond the range of possibility
 that they could put a small satellite into
 orbit some time late this year.
 E.   Chinese factories are also beginning to turn out
 supplement
 advanced fighter aircraft, to xop.?ame their aging
 and obsolescent MIG 15s and MIG 17s.  We would
 not be surprised to find that they will soon begin
 making a copy of the Soviet BADGER jet medium

 IV.   In other words, they are again making; progress in
 upgrading their weapons, but it is being done on a
 small scale, and with over-riding priorities which
 mean that other technological progress and the
 economy generally suffer as a result.
 V.   As for conventional military forces, the army amounts
 to about 2,300,000 men, with more than 100 infantry
 and a dozen armored or artllery divisions.
 A.   The Chinese Army has the capability to overrun
 any of its mainland neighbors, provided it
 does not encpunter  significatt opposition
 from a     mMqtdiipam=  major power.

 C.   The navy has the world's fourth largest
 submarine fleet, but it has no experience
 in sea-going operations.
 V.          There has been a lot of belligerent talk from
 the Chinese over Vietnam, but we think there are
 probably only three circumstances in which the
 Chinese would feel obliged to intervene there with
 military force:
 A.   U.S. air strikes against Chinese targets.
 B.   A major U.S. invasion of North Vietnam; or
 C.    Threat of imminent collapse of N.Vietnamese govt.

 VIETNAM
 Introduction
 I.   For,Vietnam, the year 1966 was primarily the year
 in which allied forces:
 --took the initiative for open combat away from
 the Communists in the South;
 --developed a sustained and increasing aerial
 bombardment of military targets in the North; and
 --made a start down the road toward stable demo-
 cratic government in Saigon.
 A.      Allied field tactics in the South have
 featured massive search-and-destroy or
 "spoiling" operations--designed to force
 enemy concentrations into extended combat,
 inflict heavy casualties, and prevent enemy
 offensives.
 1.    Late in the year,  these tactics were being
 carried into enemy strongholds where allied
 forces had not penetrated in strength since
 the war began.
 2.    The Communists are putting renewed emphasis
 on classical guerrilla tactics, in an effort

 L.        Nevertheless,  at the end of the Year the Communists
 had a larger main combat  force in the South than
 ever before; infiltration continued; and Hanoi's
 determination to persist in the war appeared to
 be undiminished.
 TILE WAR IN SOUTH VIIiTNA"1
 1.   In the bitter fighting in South Vietnam last year, the
 Viet Cong and regular units of the North Vietnamese
 Army lost nearly 56,000 killed in action.  A record
 20,000 defectors responded to the government's psycho-
 logical warfare program--about twice as many as in 1965--
 and the bulk of these defectors had been Communist
 military personnel.
