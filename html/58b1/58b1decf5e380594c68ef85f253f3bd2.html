 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 Statements from Cairo suggest that the Nasr regime
 is attempting to conceal the disappointment and un-
 certainty caused by the West's decision not to finance
 the initial stage of the Aswan High Dam project at this
 time.  Cairo's discomfort apparently is being increased
 by conflicting reports on the attitude of the USSR, which
 has three times in the past week denied committing itself
 to the support of the project, but has not closed the
 door to later negotiations.

 UN secretary general Hammarskjold's visits to
 Jerusalem, Amman and Cairo passed quietly with no immedi-
 ately apparent results save an announcement he would re-
 turn in October.  While there was a lull in border in-
 cidents during his stay in the area, new clashes occurred
 soon after his departure.

 As the anti-Stalin campaign moves into its sixth
 month, Soviet leaders are still trying to find satis-
 factory formulations for the respective roles of Stalin,
 the Communist Party, and other elements in the successes
 and failures of the Soviet state.  The Soviet Defense
 Ministry's newspaper, Red Star, has partially repudiated
 an earlier position, anbas stated that through Stalin's
 fault, Soviet industry and armed forces were not properly
 mobilized when war began.  On the question of the re-
 lationship between the foreign Communist parties and the
 USSR, two Pravda editorials.  and a speech by party
 presidium member Suslov to the French Communist Party's
 14th Congress made clear that while Moscow wants,Vnity
 in the international Communist movement, it does not
 want to give up the advantages of having the parties ap-
 pear to be national and more independent.

 Peiping still seems to be steering a middle course

 Political developments in Hungary since the removal
 of party first secretary Matyas Rakosi on 18 July indi-
 cate a significant increase in the power of the moderate
 elements within the party.  Many concessions to the de-
 mands of the moderates apparently have been granted by
 the new first secretary, Erno Gero.  Official policy
 pronouncements stress the need for party unity and re-
 flect an attempt to compromise conflicting views within
 the politburo and the central committee.    :Moscow
 oriented Gero's tenure may be a temporary one, made for
 the purpose of restraining moderate elements during the

 The speech of First Secretary Ochab to the central
 committee of the Polish United Workers (Communist)
 Party on 19 July, in which he advocated a policy of re-
 laxation, indicates that the reported policy conflicts
 between the moderate and orthodox Polish Communists
 have been at least temporarily resolved.  The scheduled
 reforms outlined by Ochab will probably not be sufficient,
 however, to win the co-operation of the public.

 The six-man coalition cabinet which assumed office
 in Iceland on 24 July includes two representatives of
 the Communistdominated Labor Alliance.          Iceland's ad-
 herence to.NATO is not immediately threatened, but the
 new government will undoubtedly press for revisions in
 the status of the American-manned Keflavik air base
 along the lines of the parliamentary resolution of 28
 March calling for the withdrawal of American troops.
 The Communists' participation in the government may
 enable them to exercise a greater influence over the
 nation's economy with a view to building a strong
 25X1      political machine.

 PROSPECTS IN PERU
 UNDER THE PRADO GOVERNMENT .  . .  .  .  .    .    .    .    .    .  . .  .  .     Page  7
 Manuel Prado, who is to be inaugurated as president
 of Peru on 28 July, is likely to continue the policies
 of his predecessor, which have made Peru one of Latin
 America's more attractive areas for foreign investment.
 However, Prado's political commitments to the non-
 Communist, leftist APRA, which supported him in the
 election, may lead to conflict between his conservative
 administration and the mass-supported APRA in the
 legislature.  This might create conditions which would
 discourage foreign investment in Peru.

 The Algerian rebels, possibly supported by Moroccan
 guerrillas, have revealed their possession of more and
 better automatic weapons in a series of clashes with
 French forces in western Oran since 19 July.              On the
 political front, Tunisia's withdrawal from negotiations
 with France on 13 July illustrates the sensitivity of
 the Bourghiba government on the                     ia's

 The 14th Congress of the French Communist Party
 held at Le Havre on 18-21 July has confirmed Secretary
 General Maurice Thorez' control of the party.    Emphasis
 was laid on unity of action with the Socialists, fore-
 shadowing an intensified campaign for Communist-
 Socialist co-operation.  Party organization problems re-
 ceived only perfunctory attention.
 TRAVELS OF SOVIET LEADERS   . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    .  . .  .     Page   11
 The last two weeks have seen the greatest exodus of
 top Soviet leaders from Moscow since collective leader-
 ship was established after Stalin's death.                          As of 22 July,
 12 of the 20 members of the presidium and secretariat,
 including the most.prominent ones, were either on
 official trips in various parts of the world or vacationing.
 Such a dispersal suggests the existence of a high degree
 of mutual trust among  h      hers of the collective.

 Czechoslovakia?s announcement of 25 July that it
 would cut its armed forces brings to seven the number of
 Sino-Soviet Satellites that have followed the Soviet "ex-
 ample" of 14 May.  Rumania, Hungary, and Poland, which,.
 like Czechoslovakia, had followed the Soviet pattern of
 announcing reductions in the fall of 1955, have indicated
 they will make further cuts.  East Germany, North Korea,
 and North Vietnam have announced reductions for the

 Japan?s vulnerability to subversion stems more from
 the inadequacy of the government's security system than
 from the capabilities of the Japan Communist Party.             The
 probability of renewed diplomatic relations with the
 USSR has made conservative leaders increasingly conscious
 of the security problem.  The government probably will
 move slowly and cautiously to improve the situation.

 The pattern of Sino-Japanese trade since the beginning
 of 1956 suggests that Peiping has taken a new tack in its
 campaign to reduce American influence in Tokyo.                By easing
 its demands for goods subject to trade controls, while
 ordering increased quantities of nonembargoed goods,
 Peiping is raising the level of its imports from Japan.
 Sino-Japanese trade negotiations are scheduled for next
 October, and pressures from business groups in Japan may
 bring about an exchange of permanent commercial re re-
 sentation at that time.

 With Indonesian president Sukarno scheduled to de-

 Eastern Europe and Communist China, the Sino-Soviet bloc
 is intensifying its political, economic, and cultural
 campaign in Indonesia in order to obtain maximum

 offer is now being considered by Indonesia, and a Soviet
 mission is soon to negotiate the first trade agreement
 between the two countries.                                                         25X1

 OTHER ARAB UNION PLANS .  .        .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .     Page  1
 Syria's proposal for a union with Egypt, now under
 consideration, fits into a pattern of plans for various
 combinations of Arab states and for a union of all Arab
 states which have been advanced over a number of years.
 The idea of Arab union originates from a desire to
 achieve a united Arab front versus the West and, more
 important, against Israel.  The proposal for Syrian-
 Egyptian union, particularly, must be viewed in the light
 of Syria's immediate wish for protection against Israel,
 and on the Egyptian side, in terms of Egypt's ambition
 to exclude Iraqi influence in Syria  Lebanon, and Jordan.

 Prime Minister Eden is shifting the emphasis of
 Britain's economic, defense, and foreign policies,
 apparently to prepare for an extended period of sharply
 competitive peaceful coexistence with the USSR.     The
 belief in Britain that a general war is unlikely in the
 foreseeable future and the need to deal with the nation's
 economic ailments are leading London to consider a
 substantial switch in energy. money, and from the defense program.                                                          25X1
 SOVIET TRANSPORTATION IN THE SIXTH FIVE-YEAR PLAN   . .  .     Page  7
 Soviet goals for transportation in the Sixth Five-
 Year Plan (1956-1960) are designed to keep transportation
 facilities abreast of the country's fast economic develop-
 ment.                  They include increasing railway freight traffic
 by 42 percent, doubling highway and maritime transport,
 and increasing oil pipeline traffic sixfold.  Plans for
 the railroads call for laying twice as much new track as
 during the previous five years, doubling the length of
 electrified lines, and greatly increasing the use of
 electric and diesel-electric locomotives.  Prospects are
 that these goals will be fulfilled.                                              25X1

 Statements from Cairo sug-
 gest that the Nasr regime is
 attempting to conceal the dis-
 appointment and uncertainty
 caused by the West's decision
 not to finance the initial
 stage of the Aswan High Dam
 project at this time.  Cairo's
 discomfort apparently is being
 increased by conflicting reports
 on the Soviet attitude; initial
 Egyptian reaction to these re-
 ports is an insistence that the
 Arabs can "go it alone" if
 necessary.   Reactions from
 other Near East and South Asian
 countries, even though in some
 cases voicing approval of the
 Western action, are unanimous
 in interpreting the decision
 as based on political rather
 than economic grounds.
 While there nave been stereotypec
 assertions that Western policy
 is guided only by a desire to
 force neutral countries into

 the Western power bloc, the
 major Egyptian propaganda effort
 appears to be to attack the
 economic argument in the Western
 announcements.   In a speech on
 24 July, Nasr accused the
 United States of spreading "lies"
 on the state of the Egyptian
 economy,
 In addition to pique at
 the official explanation of the
 Western decision, Nasr's insist-
 ence on  Egypt's ability to
 rely on itself to construct the
 dam may stem from uncertainty
 about the Soviet attitude.
 Soviet Attitude
 Since the refusal by the
 West to finance the high dam,
 the USSR has three times denied
 committing itself to the support
 of Egypt's high dam project, but
 has not closed the door to later
 negotiations possibly during
 President Nasr's trip to

 over-all advantages to the USSR

 and the costs involved.
 During the past week,
 statements by Soviet foreign
 minister Shepilov and ambas-
 sador to Egypt Kiselev suggest
 that the USSR will not renew
 its offer to finance the dam
 at this time.   According to
 Ambassador Bohlen, Shepilov
 told correspondents "quite
 explicitly" at the Belgian em-
 bassy National Day reception on
 21 July that industrialization
 was much more important to
 Egyptian development than the
 Aswam dam, and that the Soviet
 Union was prepared to consider
 Egyptian requests for assistance
 in industrial development.
 In addition, an Egyptian
 newspaper report of a statement
 by Kiselev at a Polish embassy
 reception on 22 July that
 "Russia stands by her word as
 given to Egypt regarding fi-
 nancing the high dam project"
 brought an immediate denial
 from Kiselev,.who said he merely
 reiterated Shepilov's statement,

 Jerusalem, Amman and Cairo

 While there was a slight lull
 in border incidents during the
 secretary general's stay in
 the area, new clashes of more
 serious proportions occurred
 soon after his departure.

 created by reliable press re-
 ports from a Cairo refinery
 dedication ceremony on 24 July
 that Kiselev said "We are ready
 to finance the Aswan High Dam

 had renewed the Soviet offer

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 DE-STALINIZATION PROBLEMS
 The anti-Stalin campaign
 this week moved into its sixth
 month with the Soviet leaders
 still trying to. find satisfac-
 tory formulations for the respec-
 tive roles of Stalin, the Com-
 munist Party, military leaders,
 and the. Soviet people in the
 successes and failures of the
 Soviet state.
 Stalin's role in Soviet
 military preparedness for World
 War II and the question of re-
 sponsibility for the early de-
 feats have proved to be two
 of the most controversial issues
 in the whole area of historical
 revision.
 Last May, the Soviet Defense
 Ministry newpaper, Red Star, at-
 tacked another Defense Ministry
 organ, Military Herald, for its
 "incorrect, harmful opinion"
 that "our army was forced to
 retreat, conduct defensive bat-
 tles ...as a result of failure
 to bring troops to.military pre-
 paredness,"  Subsequently,' Red
 Star itself was rebuked in the
 171-story journal, Voprosy  Istorii,
 for its attempt to  embellish"
 the story of the war by minimiz-
 ing Soviet defeats,
 On 19 July, however, Red
 Star  was willing to admit TTiat
 aall was not well in the Soviet
 Union on the eve of the war
 While the paper again stressed
 that "during the years of build-
 ing socialism the party under-
 took all measure for providing
 the armed forces with trained
 command personnel... and took
 care of equipping them," it
 blamed Stalin's intransigence
 for the inability of the armed
 forces to cope with the German
 Wehrmacht in the early years of
 the'war.  He "did not undertake
 the necessary measures for still
 greater strengthening our mili-
 tary power during the period
 when war already raged in Europe.
 and when it was clear that Fas-
 cist Germany would attack the
 USSR.  Our industry was not
 truly mobilized on time for pro-
 viding the army with a sufficient
 quantity of military equipment
 and arms."
 Differences in the patty
 line on the war issue appear
 to arise from the problem of
 blaming Stalin for wartime de-
 feats without at the same time
 ascribing so much power to him
 as to credit him with the final
 victory, and without placing in
 doubt either party infallibility
 or the reputations of certain
 living political and military.
 leaders.
 The shifts in line probably
 reflect differences of opinion
 among party leaders on how best
 to solve the problem, rather
 than a tug of war between the
 party and the army.   They may
 even reflect a change in the
 opinions of individual leaders
 in response to internal and ex-
 ternal reactions to the de-
 Stalinization campaign.
 Problem of Independence
 A Pravda editorial on 16
 July chatarged that the United
 States was engaged in a politi-
 cal campaign to exploit the de-
 Stalinization issue in order to
 "introduce dissension and con-
 fusion" in the international
 Communist movement.   The purpose
 of this campaign, it was stated,
 was to isolate individual Com-
 munist parties, and particularly
 to sever their ties with Moscow,
 in order to destroy them.   The

 editorial continued that in "ex-
 pressing the national charac
 tcristics 01  their peoples, `'
 the Communist parties must not
 forget the fundamental need
 for unity.   According to a
 Pravda article of 24 July,  the
 members of the Communist move-
 ment are progressing along dif-
 ferent roads, but will achieve
 the same goal because they are
 using the "compass of Marxism-
 Leninism."
 A speech by party presid-
 ium member Suslov to the 14th
 French Communist Party congress
 also urged unity and a consoli-
 dation of the ties between Com-
 munist parties, but it said
 nothing about the plotting of
 Western groups.  More emphasis
 was placed on the primary need
 of each party to set its own
 tasks "in conformity with...the
 national interests of its peo-
 ple." Suslov said that the forms
 of Communist party co-operation
 "cannot be modeled after the same
 pattern suitable for all times
 and circumstances."
 The speech was a further in-
 dication that while Moscow
 wants fundamental unity in the
 Communist movement, it does not
 want to give up the advantages
 of having the parties appear
 to be national and more inde-
 pendent.

 PEIPING STILL CAUTIOUS
 ON DE-STALINIZATION
 Peiping still seems to be
 steering a middle course be-
 tween outright support of, and
 nonparticipation in the Krem-

 Peiping's recent publica-

 "criticism concerniYig the Stalin
 issue"--primarily statements.
 released by various Communist
 parties--is the regime's only
 contribution since 5 April to
 the de-Stalinization campaign.
 Moreover, while the Kremlin's
 resolution of 30 June and Togli-
 atti's statements are said to
 be included in Peiping's book,
 Khrushchev's "secret" denuncia-

 People's Daily Editorial
 The definitive Chinese
 Communist position on Stalin
 was set forth in the Peo le's
 Daily--the party's journal--on
 5 April.   The editorial followed
 the general pattern of the in-

 at the time, but it showed the
 Chinese to be less inclined
 than the Russians to dwell on
 Stalin's errors,   Stalin was.

 any Chinese misfortunes, and
 his works were described as
 meriting "serious study" in China.
 At no time since the de-
 Stalinization campaign began
 have individual Chinese Commu-
 nist leaders made any public
 statements on Stalin's stature.
 When a foreign newsman recently
 asked Chou En-lai to comment,
 the Chinese premier replied
 that he had "nothing to add" to
 the editorial's."complete re-

 DEVELOPMENTS IN HUNGARY

 Political developments in
 Hungary since the removal of
 party first secretary Matyas
 Rakosi on 18 July indicate
 a significant increase in the
 power of the moderate elements
 within the party.   Many conces-

 The Eighth Congress of the
 Chinese Communist Party, sched-
 uled to convene this September,
 is expected to reconfirm Mao
 as the party's leader but at
 the same time to narrow the
 gap between Mao and other lead-
 ers in preparation for Mao's
 death or retirement.   This would
 follow the strategy of the
 .government reorganization of
 1954, which reduced Mao's con-
 stitutional powers and enhanced
 the roles of leaders such as
 Liu Shao-chi and Chou En-lai.
 Although Mao will almost cer-
 tainly remain dominant in the

 secretaries who are apparently
 proteces of Istyan Kovacs, an
 old-time party worker and secre-
 tariat member with a reputation
 for moderation.
 Another new central com-
 mittee member,  Imre Horvath,
 who reportedly will be named
 foreign minister shortly, per-
 haps epitomizes the attitude
 of the moderate camp.  An intel-
 lectual Communist of long stand-
 ing, Horvath   privately told
 an American official in April
 that the Hungarian party had
 lost the "trust of the people"
 and that the party, in the
 long run, could not maintain
 itself in power without genuine
 majority support.
 Policy Announcement
 The resolution summing up
 the central committee meeting
 of 18-21 July is conciliatory
 in tone and appears to be in
 part a synthesis of divergent
 views.   While reasserting basic
 Communist tenets, it modifies
 the Rakosi line in virtually
 all areas of policy.
 The resolution proclaims
 the primacy of heavy industry
 and agricultural socialization
 but calls for a number of slight
 revisions in the Five-Year Plan
 directives in order to improve
 production and workers' living
 conditions. It also urges im-
 mediate boosts in real wages.
 Part and parcel if this
 aspect of the program are the
 energetic efforts of the new
 leaders to gain the support of
 the workers.   Gero,.in a reveal-
 ing statement on 18 July, said,
 Touch wood,  there has been no
 Poznan in Hungary."
 In censuring right-wing
 opportunism, the resolution
 nevertheless conceded that past
 "symptoms of wavering and mis-
 trust of the party" were in
 large part the result of "mis-
 takes committed by the top
 layer of the party," and that
 justifiable criticism had erro-
 neously been branded as "right-
 wing opportunism,"
 The emphasis on the role
 of the People's Popular Front
 has also been altered by the
 resolution.   New concessions
 have apparently now been made
 to moderate demands that the
 front be made into a more gen-
 uinely representative body.
 The resolution indicated
 that,  in line with moderate
 demands,  the rehabilitation of
 purged Communists and fellow
 travelers--many of whom were non-
 Muscovites imprisoned in the
 late 1940's or 1950's---would be
 "completed,"   The resolution
 added that greater control would
 be exerted over Ministry of
 Interior  ersonnel
 Gero, whose health is re-
 portedly had, may be only a
 provisional appointment, de-
 signed to check the more extreme
 forms of factionalism and anti-
 party expression.   Over-all policy
 will occupy a middle-of-the-road
 position and strong efforts will
 be made to restrain advocates
 of dramatic liberalization.   The
 American legation in Budapest
 doubts, however, that the present
 compromise will halt pressure
 for further liberalization.
 The moderate forces are aware of
 Gero's history of doctrinal ri-
 gidity, and are unlikely to
 allow their position to be under-
 cut by only limited     cessions.

 POLAND'S NEW DOMESTIC POLICIES
 The speech'of First
 Secretary Ochab to the central
 committee of the. Polish United
 Workers (Communist) Party of
 19 July, in which he advocated
 a policy of mC deration, , indicates
 that the reported policy con-
 flicts between the moderate
 and orthodox Communists have
 been at least temporarily
 resolved.
 Ochab,'who had been're"
 ported as desiring to return to
 a hard course, stressed the
 need for greater democracy and
 for decentralization of the
 administration in Poland, and
 he outlined a reduction in the
 industrial production targets
 for 1960.   The major difference
 remaining between Ochab and
 the moderates appears to be on
 the question of public criticism,
 with Premier Cyrankiewicz
 stressing the need for it, and
 Ochab, the necessity to limit it.
 .Economic Matters
 Much of the ' first secre-
 tary's speech was taken up with
 a discussion of economic matters,
 particularly those economic
 weaknesses which brought about
 the Poznan riots.   He noted the
 country's inadequate standard
 of living, wage cuts, poor
 working conditions,-the unduly
 high income tax, and the indi f-
 ference of the trade unions.
 He admitted that real wages in-
 creased by only 13 percent be-
 tween 1950 and 1955, blaming
 this largely on the unforeseen
 need to create an armaments
 industry after the outbreak of
 the Korean war.
 Ochab announced.that the
 1956-60 Five-Year Plan would
 provide for a 53-57.percent
 increase in industrial produc-
 tion, in contrast to an announce-
 ment made earlier this year
 calling  for a   70-percent
 increase.   In spite of his
 emphasis. on the need to im-
 prove the standard of living,
 Ochab acknowledged that real
 .wages, would increase  by only 30
 percent during, the next five
 years and that even after such
 an increase, the standard of
 living would still be relatively
 low.  He announced that the
 acute housing.shortage  another
 cause of widespread complaints--
 will not be significantly im-?
 proved.
 Along with the increased
 emphasis'it is placing on
 improving economic conditions,
 the government. apparently
 vlans to improve the adminis-
 trative structure.   Four pairs
 of economic ministries have
 been merged. during the past
 few weeks, and a new chairman
 has been appointed to the much-
 criticized State Economic Plan-
 ning Commission.   In. his speech
 Ochab stressed the need for
 administrative decentralization
 so that local problems could be
 solved quickly on, the local level.
 Freedom of
 Criticism
 On the'question of freedom
 of criticism, Ochab took a more
 orthodox position than Premier
 Cyrankiewiez and the party
 moderates.   Whereas Cyrankiewicz
 recently stated that such
 criticism is healthy and still
 insufficient, Ochab warned that
 much` of it had gone too far.
 While condemning bureaucrats
 for their drive to suppress
 "sound" criticism, he said that
 !'criticism from the position
 of the enemy" would not be al-
 lowed.                                                        He complained that the
 party press, including Trybuna
 Ludu--organ of the central com-
 mittee whose editor was recently
 dismissed--had failed to present
 the achievements as well as the
 failures of the past year, and
 he warned against future out-
 bursts against the party.

 .Iceland on.24 July includes
 two representatives of the
 Communist-dominated Labor
 Alliance.   Iceland's adherence
 to NATO is not immediately
 threatened, but the new govern-

 revisions in the status of the
 American-manned Keflavik air
 base along the lines of the
 parliamentary resolution of 28
 March calling for the withdrawal
 of American troops.  The Com-
 munists' participation in the
 government may enable them to
 exercise a greater influence
 over the nation's economy with
 a view to building a,strong
 political machine.
 Composition
 The Progressives, the
 Social Democrats and the Labor
 Alliance, which consists of
 dissident left-win; Socialists
 and Communists, each received
 two posts in the new government
 which is headed by the oppor-
 tunistic Progressive Party
 chairman Herman Jonasson.
 Despite the opposition of the
 Labor Alliance, Gudmundur I.
 Gudmundsson, vice chairman of
 the Social Democratic Party,
 obtained the post of foreign
 minister,  this having been the
 Social Democrats' condition for
 participating in the government.
 The new incumbent is a strong

 Democrat.
 ostensible harmony for the time
 being.   It is unlikely, however,
 that they will be sufficient to
 win the genuine co-operation of
 the public.
 Ludvik Josefesson, a Com-
 munist, obtained the Ministries
 of Commerce and Fisheries.   The
 Labor Alliance also secured the
 Ministry of Social Affairs,
 shorn, however, of the tempting
 Unemployment Compensation
 Fund, which  it had hoped to
 use to strengthen  its position
 with labor.  Through these posts
 Communists hope to promote
 socialization and nationaliza-
 tion schemes.

 The Labor Alliance presum-
 ably accepted the Social Demo-
 cratic condition for participa-

 new government issue a declara-
 tion of Iceland's continued
 adherence to NATO.  Gudmundsson,
 who arrived in Oslo on 22 July
 for "private talks," has reported-
 ly assured Norwegian leaders
 that Iceland does not intend
 to leave NATO, but he also reit-
 erated Iceland's decision to
 bring about a withdrawal of
 American troops.   Gudmundsson
 is said to believe that American
 planes, equipment and specialists
 should remain, but not "uniforms."
 In a radio broadcast on
 24 July, Prime Minister Jonasson
 stated that his government's
 aim was to adhere to NATO but
 that the treaty of 1951 between
 Iceland and the United States
 should be revised immediately
 so Icelanders themselves could
 maintain and guard the Keflavik

 Otherwise, Iceland would leave

 at the polls as shown by the
 Conservatives'  tremendous gain

 The Communists undoubtedly
 will seek to expand Iceland's

 nation's dependence on the
 foreign exchange earnings
 of the Keflavik base.   This
 would eliminate a major eco-

 PROSPECTS IN PERU
 UNDER THE PRADO GOVERNMENT
 Manuel Prado, who is to be
 inaugurated as president of
 Peru on 28 July, is likely to
 continue the policies of his
 predecessor. which have made
 Peru one of, the more attractive
 areas in Latin America for
 foreign-investment.   However,
 Prado's political commitments
 to the non-Communist, leftist
 APRA, which supported him in
 the election, may lead to a
 conflict between his conserva-
 tive administration and the
 mass-supported APRA in the
 legislature.   This might create
 conditions which would reduce
 Peru's attractiveness as a
 foreign investment area.
 Political Situation
 Prado and most prospective
 members of his cabinet come

 to securing legalization.   Popu-'
 lar support for such legalization
 is countered by bitter conserva-
 tive' and military opposition.
 Legalization of APRA would
 almost inevitably be a prelude
 to extensive social and economic
 change, while failure to legal-

 be conducive to serious popular
 unrest.   The problem thus posed
 seems likely to threaten the
 Economic Boom
 For the past several years,
 Peru has been experiencing boom
 conditions.   As the fourth larg-
 est Latin American country, with
 a diversity of natural resources
 exceeded only by Brazil and Mexi-
 co, Peru has attracted consider-
 able foreign capital and has
 displayed an unusually friendly
 i attitude toward it.
 The most important of
 current projects is"the exploi-
 tationof an estimated one bil-
 lion tons of over 1 percent
 copper ore in southern Peru at
 a cost of $200,000,000.   A new
 American-owned company has begun
 development at Toquepala, and in
 four years it expects to export
 140,000 tons of copper yearly,
 slightly over a third of current
 production in Chile.
 The pressures of economic
 growth have been reflected in
 significant wage increases
 for mining and agricultural
 workers.   Urban labor, which
 was permitted no increase in
 real wages during the 1951-55
 period, gained substantially
 through successful strikes in
 the pre-election freedom of
 the first half of 1956.   A
 continuation of sharp wage rises,
 perhaps through the efforts of
 the APRA-controlled National          25X1
 Confederation of Labor, would
 threaten inflation.

 Algeria
 The Algerian rebels, pos-
 sibly supported by Moroccan
 guerrillas, have revealed their
 possession of more and better
 automatic weapons in a series
 of clashes with French forces
 in western Oran since 19 July.
 In these actions, the rebels
 reportedly showed greater
 strength than at any time since
 late May.
 Tunisia
 Tunisian withdrawal from
 negotiations with France on 13
 July, when an impasse was reached
 on the critical defense issue,
 illustrates the extreme sensi-
 tivity of the Bourghiba govern-
 ment on the subject of Tunisia's
 sovereignty.  The Tunisian nego-
 tiators walked out when they
 could not secure France's recog-
 nition in principle that French
 troops would ultimately evacuate
 Tunisia, including the strategic
 French base at Bizerte.   France
 is unwilling to make such a
 commitment in view of the prob-
 ability that the Tunisians are
 supporting the Algerian rebels.
 French officials in Paris
 look on the suspension as a
 "minor family row," expecting
 that the serious economic and
 financial situation in Tunisia
 will force the Tunisians to seek
 to reopen negotiations.  The
 Tunisian government, however,
 strongly supported by the Con-
 stituent Assembly, is not likely
 soon to take such an initiative.
 Faced with the widespread
 appeal of Salah ben Youssef's
 extremism, Premier Bourghiba
 cannot afford to yield to the
 French.   The premier may attempt
 to break France's economic
 stranglehold over Tunisia by
 seeking economic aid elsewhere.
 French sponsorship of Tunisia's
 application for membership in
 the United Nations, which Paris     25X1
 hopes will mollify the Tunisians,
 is not likely to do so.

 CURRENT INTELLICLNCE VEEKLY SUMMARY

 THE FRENCH COMMUNIST PARTY'S
 24TH CONGRESS
 The 14th Congress of the
 French Communist Party held at
 Le Havre on 18-21 July has
 .confirmed Secretary General
 Maurice Thorez'  control of  the
 party.   Emphasis'was laid on
 unity of action with the So-
 cialists, foreshadowing a
 heightened campaign for Com-
 munist-Socialist co-operation.

 de-Stalinization campaign.
 Maurice Thorez' re-election as
 secretary general and the So-
 viet delegate's.reference to
 him as a "dear friend" empha-
 size his continuing leadership.
 Thorez paid lip service to the
 value of criticism of the cult
 of personality, but he stressed
 that such criticism could not
 be "transferred mechanically"
 to the French Communist Party.
 The.de-Stalinization drive
 within the French party thus
 .seems to be successfully checked,
 and Thorez'  strong attack on
 the haphazard discussion of any
 subject appears to signal a
 .mafflin, of all intraparty crit-
 icism.,
 Unity of action with the
 Socialists was given special
 emphasis at the congress; and
 the chief of the visiting Soviet
 delegation stated 'in his "direc-
 tive"' the great importance at-
 tached-to such collaboration.
 The most immediate result of
 this policy is likely to be a
 stepped-up effort to secure
 ment's reported plans to import
 foreign labor to meet the short-
 age stemming from the manpower
 needs of the present military
 effort.   Labor grievances are-
 on the rise generally, and
 mounting living costs are arous-
 ing increasing unrest which
 the Communists can readily ex-
 ploit.
 Jacques Duclos' speech on
 21 July further underlined the
 need for united action, even
 at the risk of not being ideo-
 logically consistent.   Speak-
 ing on the role of "municipali-
 ties for the workinf: masses,"
 he stressed that all local Communist
 officials were subordinate to
 local party organizations.
 The 14th Congress devoted
 relatively little. time to in-
 ternal party organization as
 compared.to the congress in
 1954.  Thorez played up the
 party's strength and undertook
 to refute arguments of those
 who think that the Communist
 Party can disappear.   He claimed
 that nearly 50,000 new members
 have joined since January, but
 added that some recruitment
 weaknesses exist, particularly
 among metal and mine workers.
 He also emphasized the weakness
 of the Communist youth organi-
 zation, and baited an appeal
 to intellectuals to join the
 party by reiterating the "dif-
 ferent roads to Socialism"
 thesis.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 July 1956
 TRAVELS OF SOVIET LEADERS
 The last two weeks have
 seen the greatest exodus of
 top Soviet leaders from N.oscow
 since collective leadership was
 established after Stalin's death.
 As of 22 July, 12 of the 20 mem-
 bers of the presidium and secre-
 tariat, including the most prom-
 inent ones, were either on of-
 ficial trips in various parts
 of the world or vacationing.
 This left only five of 11 full
 members of the,presidium in
 Moscow. Such a dispersal sug-
 gests the existence of a high
 degree of mutual trust among
 the members of the collective.
 Some of the top leaders
 left Moscow early in July even
 though the Supreme Soviet was
 scheduled to meet on the 11th.
 Presidium members Mikoyan,
 Kaganovich and Saburov were
 reported by Soviet officials
 to have left on vacation around
 2 July.   Kaganovich returned
 to Moscow in time for the Su-
 preme Soviet session.   Saburov
 is still on vacation, as appar-
 ently are Shvernik and Aristov.
 Mikoyan, however, apparently
 went to Budapest sometime around
 18 July.   His presence in Hun-
 gary at the time of the party
 plenum at which Rakosi "re-
 signed" was not officially re-
 ported until Mikoyan left for
 Yugoslavia on 21 July.  After
 a brief conference with Tito
 on the island of Brioni, Mikoy-
 an stopped off in Sofia on 23
 July en route to Moscow.
 Presidium candidate Furtseva
 left for London on 12 July as
 head of a parliamentary dele-
 gation, and Suslov and Kirichen-
 ko, both full members of the
 presidium, arrived in Paris
 on 16 July to take part in the
 French Communist Party congress.
 On 19 July Khrushchev,
 immediately after seeing off
 the last of a long series of
 visiting Communist delegations,
 flew east to Sverdlovsk to at-
 tend an agricultural conference
 and what may turn out to be
 the first of a series of mass
 rallies of agricultural workers
 in the new lands areas.  On the
 last day of the conference,
 Khrushchev addressed a crowd
 of 200,000 and then, accompanied
 by?party secretary Belyayev,

 Rumania, Hungary, ,and Poland,
 which, like Czechoslovakia,fol-

 undertaken only if
 the West took the ini-

 In most instances,
 the proposed cuts are
 reductions, which would have
 little effect on military ca-
 pabilities but which might be
 of considerable propaganda
 value.
 While most of these an-

 and to fix the strength of its
 armed forces at the resultant
 90,000 men, East Germany indi-
 cated that it would maintain
 its forces on a voluntary basis.
 Tha,s decision was probably,
 influenced by the critical
 manpower shortage in East Germany
 and by public opposition to the
 introduction of conscription,
 which could, however; be intro-
 duced at a later date to meet
 the "threat" of West German
 rearmament.

 JAPANESE INCREASE AWARENESS
 OF INTERNAL SECURITY THREAT
 Japan's vulnerability to
 subversion  stems more from the
 .inadequacy of the government's
 security system than from the
 capabilities of the Japan Com-
 munist Party (JCP).   The prob-;
 ability of renewed diplomatic
 relations with the USSR has
 made conservative leaders in-
 creasingly conscious of the
 security problem.   The govern-
 ment probably will move slowly,
 and cautiously to improve the
 situation.
 Japan has no anti,,-espionage
 legislation and no laws safe--
 guarding military information
 other than that applying to
 materiel received under the
 Mutual Defense Assistance Agree-
 ment with the United States,
 Regulations on handling Jap-
 anese government classified
 information provide extremely
 light penalities.   A lack of
 physical security facilities?
 and lax security discipline
 contribute to this unsatisfac-
 tory situation..
 Position of Communist Party
 The JCP has limited sup-
 port among the people and
 possesses little direct politi-
 cal  influence  on national policy.
 Its status as a legal party
 and its policy of infiltrating
 ? the leadership Of non-Communist
 mass organizations, however,
 has allowed it to promote con-
 siderable popular support for
 the objectives of undermining
 PART II,
 the American position and pro-
 moting policies contrary to  '
 American interests.   The party,
 reportedly, also has attained
 some success in placing members.
 in minor government positions
 and to a lesser degree in the
 enlisted ranks of Japan's
 defense . forces.
 Government and Liberal-
 Democratic Party leaders-are
 becoming increasingly conscious
 of the security threat posed
 by the JCP, particularly in
 view of pending diplomatic rela-
 tions with Moscow.   They, how-
 ever, are divided on ways to meet
 the threat along the same lines
 as over the.Sovi?e.t peace treaty.
 Those who favor a "quick" peace
 settlement fear that a strong
 anti-Communist policy at home
 will jeopardize the peace nego-
 tiations, and the advocates of
 a "go-slow" policy tend to sup-
 port tighter security controls.
 This division of opinion, the
 fear of being charged with
 reviving the prewar "thought
 police," and Preoccupation   with
 intraparty politics has thus
 far prevented any tightening of
 security controls.
 Counterespionage Legislation
 Prior. to the 8 July upper
 house elections, the  chief cabinet
 secretary announced that the
 government intended to introduce
 a counterespionage bill in the
 next Diet.   Socialist election

 Japanese public sensitivity to
 any hint of prewar police activ-
 ities,will increase government
 reluctance to promote such a
 law and may preclude its intro-

 ment will seek passage of a
 weak counterespionage law with
 the idea of strengthening it
 later.

 order to obtain maximum advan-

 A Soviet technical assist-

 Indonesian Foreign Ministry
 spokesman, and a Soviet mission
 is to arrive soon to negotiate
 the first trade agreement be-

 they would prefer not to final-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 July 1956
 THE PLAN FOR SYRIAN-EGYPTIAN UNION AND OTHER ARAB UNION PLANS
 Syria's proposal for a
 union with Egypt, now under
 consideration,      fits into a
 pattern of plans for various
 combinations of Arab states
 and for a union of all Arab
 states which have been'ad-
 vanced over a number of years.
 The Syrian proposal, however,
 must be viewed particularly in
 the light of Syria's  immediate
 desire for protection against
 Israel, and on the Egyptian
 side,  in terms of  Egypt's de-
 sire to exclude Iraqi influence
 in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.
 tremendous unshared oil wealth
 of Kuwait.
 Arab Motivation
 Arab desires for unity are
 primarily a reaction to the
 fragmentation of the Arab world
 following the breakup of the
 Turkish empire after World War
 I.   If the Arabs could cast off
 the artificial divisions which
 they believe were imposed in
 order to keep them weak, and
 unite in one great Arab state,
 they could, they believe, present
 a united front to (1) the West
 and (2) more important,  against
 Israel.  The theme of unity has
 had new impetus as a result of
 the bitterly humiliating defeat
 Israel handed the Arabs in
 1948.   If the Arabs had been
 united, they believe, this
 would never have occurred.
 Unified, they could become a
 force capable of determining
 their own destiny.
 Union, too, would right
 the unequal share of the natural
 resources between the Arab
 states which resulted from the
 division of the Middle East into
 individual states.  Many Arabs
 feel that the oil--the only
 major Arab resource--should be
 shared for the benefit of all.
 There is considerable criticism
 of the way Saudi Arabia uses its
 oil revenue monies, and of the
 Variety ,of Plans
 There have been a variety
 of plans for Arab unity.   Iraq
 has long favored a union of the
 Hashemite dynasties of Iraq and
 Jordan and of union with Syria.
 Syria seeks the reabsorption of
 Lebanon, which was carved out
 of Syria by the French.  The
 re-establishment of the his-
 torical "natural" Syria,                                                              the
 union of the fertile crescent
 states--Iraq, Syria, Lebanon,
 Jordan, and Palestine--is
 another dream.  There have also
 long been dreams of the-union
 of all the Arab states into
 one great state, an idea which
 brings visions of the days of
 the Arab conquests from the
 seventh through the eleventh
 century.
 Unity in Practice
 Despite the multiplicity
 of plans for union, none has
 been established.  The closest
 the Arab states came was the
 formation of the Arab League
 in 1945.  But the league as
 established underscored Arab
 disunity and the desires of
 the Arab rulers and governments
 to maintain their independence
 and sovereignty rather than
 achieve unity.  The Israeli war
 clearly indicated that Arab
 rivalries take predominance over
 unity of action.  The league  .
 remains a discredited debating
 society rather than any real
 basis for Arab union.
 Vested interests have arisen
 as a result of the establishment
 of individual states.  Each
 state, while paying lip service
 to unity, jealously views another
 state's attempts at a combina-
 tion not as a move toward Arab
 unity, but as an attempt to

 establish predominance.          The
 opposition of Saudi Arabia to
 any spread of Iraqi influence
 and the present contest between
 Egypt and Iraq are examples.
 Egypt, probably correctly, views
 Iraq's joining of the Baghdad
 pact as an attempt to lure
 other Arab states to Iraq and
 away from Egyptian influence.
 British backing of and
 French opposition to union plans
 also have been important factors.
 Britain favors the union of the
 Hashemite dynasties it estab-
 lished after World War I, but
 opposes plans which might
 threaten  their  influence.
 France views union of its for-
 mer mandate Syria with other
 LEA.

 Arab states as a threat to
 French influence.
 Syrian-Egyptian Union
 The Syrian proposal for
 union with Egypt'stems most
 immediately from a desire to
 achieve a firm tie with a mili-
 tarily strong protector against
 Israel.   Iraq, the other pos-
 sible protector, is tied in
 Syrian eyes to the West and
 hence cannot be entirely de-
 pended on in a crisis.
 Syria made its first pub-
 lic bid for union with Egypt
 in January 1956.   Nazim al-Qudsi,
 a leader of the conservative
 Populist Party, proposed at a

 banquet in Damascus honoring an
 Egyptian delegation, that Syria
 and Egypt unite politically as
 a first step toward comprehen-
 sive Arab unity.  According to
 the press, the Qudsi proposal
 had advance approval from all
 Syrian political parties and
 parliamentary groups.   Qudsi
 said a parliamentary delegation
 would visit Egypt to hold
 preliminary discussions.
 The issue came to the fore
 again in June at the time of
 the formation of the present
 "national" government headed
 by Prime Minister.Sabri al-Asali.
 Disagreement over a statement
 on union with Egypt was an im-
 portant factor which held up
 the forming of the Asali govern-
 ment and almost brought it down
 before it was confirmed.
 Syrian-Egyptian union is
 most actively being promoted by
 the leftist, pro-Egyptian Arab
 Socialist Resurrection Party,
 which holds two ministries in
 the Asali cabinet.  Most con-
 servatives, though they cannot
 speak out against Arab unity,
 are privately opposed, and con-
 sented to the cabinet statement
 only because its proponents
 agreed to include provisions
 opening the arrangement to
 other states.
 On 6 July, after prelim-
 inary talks in Cairo, the
 Syrian parliament approved a
 unanimous cabinet decision to
 set up a ministerial commission
 --composed of the prime minis-
 ter, the foreign minister and
 the minister of interior--to
 negotiate "federal union"'with
 Egypt "provided this union shall
 be open to other liberated Arab
 states."  Asali said that when
 agreement was reached with
 .Egypt, a bill would be presented
 to the Syrian parliament for
 approval.
 The Form of Union
 The Syrian parliamentary
 resolution stated that the
 union would be a federal union.
 Egyptian president Nasr has
 used the term "federation"
 rather than merger.   Syrian
 foreign minister Bitar, quoted
 in a press interview in Cairo,
 indicated that the arrangement
 would include cultural, economic,
 military and foreign policy
 union, and stated that the
 plan eventually would result
 in a combining of the Egyptian
 and Syrian constitutions.  II
 union would pro-
 vide for (1) joint irrigation
 projects in Syria and the
 settlement of Egyptians on the
 reclaimed land,     (2) joint cul-
 tural and education projects,
 (3) union of the Syrian and
 Egyptian armies,  (4) joint in-
 tergovernmental standing com-
 mittees, and (5) a common con-
 stitution.
 The Egyptian ambassador in
 Damascus told American embassy
 officials that once the Syrians
 agree, Egypt will accept any
 form of association the Syrians
 propose.
 Egyptian Reaction
 Though the plan for union
 as envisaged by the Syrians
 would firmly place Syria in the
 Egyptian camp and prevent the
 extension of Iraqi influence
 into Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan,
 the Egyptians appear to be
 somewhat cautious of the Syrian
 proposal.  'Nasr said on 6 July
 that he received the Syrian
 parliament resolution with
 "great satisfaction" and that
 Syrian-Egyptian union would be
 a "fundamental step toward the
 formation of the Arab nation,"
 but the Egyptian press has been
 lukewarm on the subject.
 Saleh Salim, a former RCC
 member, warned in his newspaper
 that no concrete steps should
 be taken until it is clear that
 a substantial majority in both
 countries will support union
 "irrespective of the opposition

 Byroade commented on 6 July
 that he doubts Egypt is now
 interested in pressing federa-
 tion beyond the talk stage, al-
 though Egypt will be compelled
 to avoid a flat rebuff to
 Syria's advances.   Byroade added,
 however, that if Iraq and Turkey
 make an issue of the union pro-
 posal, Egypt may be forced to
 take a more positive stand.
 Syrian Disenchantment
 Syrian disappointment over
 Egypt's reaction is indicated
 in the remarks of a high offi-
 cial in the Syrian Foreign
 Ministry.   This official told
 the American embassy on 3 July
 that the Syrians were then
 more or less convinced that
 Egypt was opposed to union now.
 He said this was indicated by
 the Egyptian requirement that
 all Syrian parties agree and
 the Egyptian proposal to set
 up study committees.   The offi-
 cial said that there may be a
 move to combine diplomatic
 representation in some countries
 and closer economic association,
 but he considered other develop-
 ments unlikely in the near future
 The American ambassador in Da-
 mascus commented on 7 July that
 it was unlikely that Syria would
 force the issue at this time.
 Outside Opposition
 The mere mention of Syrian-
 Egyptian union has aroused con-
 cern outside Syria and Egypt.
 Officials in Turkey, Iraq's
 partner in the Baghdad pact, told
 American officials in Ankara
 that the union project is ob-
 viously intended to prevent

 and the West.

 BRITAIN MODIFIES POLICY TOWARD SOVIET BLOC
 Prime Minister Eden is
 shifting the emphasis of Brit-
 ain's economic, defense, and
 foreign policies, apparently
 to prepare for an extended peri-
 od of sharply competitive peace-
 ful coexistence with the USSR.
 The belief in Britain that a
 general war is unlikely in the
 foreseeable future and the need
 to deal with the nation's eco-
 nomic ailments are leading Lon-
 don to consider a substantial
 switch in energy, money, and
 manpower away from the defense
 program.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 July 1956
 In relaxing diplomatic bar-
 riers and encouraging trade ex-
 pansion and increased contacts
 at official levels, the British
 government is reflecting the pub-
 lic's hope that the Soviet bloc
 may be so opened to Western in-
 fluences by these policies as
 to bring about eventually.a
 basic modification of the Soviet
 system.  At the same time,Brit-
 ain maintains its guard against
 Soviet influence in such vital
 areas as the Near East and
 Southeast Asia.
 Public Optimism
 If not actually leading
 opinion, Prime Minister Eden
 has at least kept pace with the
 public's belief that'the danger
 of war has decreased ever since
 the Geneva "summit" conference.
 "We seem to be moving from a
 cold war to a tepid peace," typi-
 fies the trend of his public
 utterances.
 The more cautious view of
 most British officials appears
 not to affect the outlook of
 Eden, whose personal direction
 of foreign policy probably ex-
 ceeds that of Churchill during
 his later years as prime minis-
 ter.  Eden's tendency to adjust
 policies has not been restrained
 by official estimates to the
 effect that Soviet forc
 i
 es
 n
 Germany as of late June were
 more powerful than at any time
 since 19466, despite the recent
 withdrawals.   Similarly, the
 dangers the Foreign Office sees
 in the greater appeal of the
 "softer" Communist line since
 the 20th party congress are
 not publicly stressed by Eden.
 In recent months, public
 pressure for policy changes has
 been increasing.  Above all, _ the
 spectacle of Malenkov, Khrushchev
 and Bulganin soliciting popular
 favor in Britain this spring
 strikingly emphasized to the
 British public the metamorphosis
 in the Soviet approach.   Popular
 impatience with Western policy
 is indicated by the favorable
 reaction to the USSR's announce-
 ment on 15'May of its intention
 to reduce its armed forces by
 1,200,000.  A USIA poll taken
 immediately thereafter revealed
 that, in a complete reversal of
 previous sentiment, Britons cited
 the USSR twice as often as the
 US as the country making the
 more serious effort toward
 general disarmament.
 The prime minister's state-
 ments also return to plague him
 in opposition attacks.   In the
 House of Commons, the day-to-day
 emphasis of Labor speeches,
 questions, and motions is that
 the change in the international
 climate requires the government
 to revise its policies on a wide
 range of topics, from Chinese
 UN membership to nuclear test
 explosions.
 Economic Problems
 Britain's continuing eco-
 nomic difficulties also argue
 for policy,chan,ges, particularly
 at. a time when the Soviet bloc
 is conducting a sharp trade of-
 fensive.   Industrial and some
 financial observers speak in
 "crisis" terms, and Eden, speak-
 ing in late June, said the loss
 of export markets would do to
 Britain "what the U-boats twice
 failed to do."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 26 July 1956
 The recent modest improve-
 ment in Britain's balance of
 payments has not significantly
 lessened the threat posed by
 domestic inflation.   The result-
 ing slow but steady rise in
 British export:-prices has in-
 creased the difficulty of com-
 peting abroad.   In addition,
 in the engineering industries,
 which are assuming increasing
 importance. in Britain's foreign
 trade, the shortage of labor
 is particularly acutetland it is
 with these key facilities that
 military production competes
 most directly.
 Pressure for Defense Cuts
 Pressure for changes in
 British policy to meet the twin
 conditions of the decreased
 danger of war and the economic
 crisis at home has been directed
 principally at reducing the de-
 fense burden in order to con-
 centrate on improving the coun-
 try's competitive position.
 By mid-July, public demands
 for sweeping defense cuts reached
 a crescendo.  On 18 July, the
 Parliamentary Labor Party urged
 a "substantial" reduction in the
 defense budget and an end to
 conscription by the end of 1958.
 A few days earlier, the Liberal
 Party leader, Clement Davies,
 had advocated a slash of one third
 in defense spending.
 The government is evidently
 considering a fairly drastic
 across-the-board defense cut--
 far beyond the three-percent
 reduction in current spending
 announced in late June, which
 left the size and shape of forces
 intact.   Press. reports-, apparent-
 ly officially inspired, state
 that a reduction of about one
 fourth in the defense budget is
 planned.   The government has
 denied this.
 Although these reports are
 probably exaggerated,  they do
 suggest the magnitude of the
 current reappraisal.   The Ameri-
 can embassy in London believes
 'that Britain will move "as fast
 PART I I I
 and as far as possible" to re-
 duce its forces within the lim-
 its necessary to cover its over-
 seas responsibilities.
 Highest among these respon-
 sibilities is London's pledge
 to retain its four ground and
 one tactical air divisions on
 the European continent.  Brit-
 ain can obtain release from
 this commitment only by major-
 ity agreement of the Council of
 the Western European Union;(the
 Benelux countries, France, Ger-
 many, Great Britain, and Italy),
 except in a dire overseas or
 economic emergency.   The trend
 of the public defense debate
 indicates that Britain will
 claim that improved weapons
 will prevent any. planned re-
 ductions from actually lowering
 the: effective strength of Brit-
 ish forces in Germany.   British
 officials have stated that,
 in any case,  they will not reduce
 forces without consultation
 with their allies.
 Some clearer indication
 of the government's plans may
 come out in the defense debate
 scheduled for the week of 30
 July.
 Diplomatic Efforts
 The trend of British diplo-
 macy since the Bulganin-Khru-
 shchev visit-has suggested an
 increasing effort to encourage
 the new.approach in Soviet
 policy.  Notably, Britain at-
 tempted in May to gain Soviet
 co-operation on a UN Security
 Council resolution on the Pales-
 tine dispute.   The original
 draft of Eden's reply to Bul-
 ganin's disarmament letter
 credited the Soviet Union with
 contributing to a better inter-
 national atmosphere by its.
 announcement of troop reductions,
 but this statement was withdrawn
 because of objections raised
 in the North Atlantic Council.
 There have also been sev-
 eral efforts to promote per-
 sonal Anglo-Soviet contacts.

 ready has announced the specif-
 ic date for his own visit to
 the USSR ten months in advance.
 He plans to depart for Moscow:.
 on 5 May 1957.
 Attitude Toward Soviet Activities
 The shift to "competitive
 coexistence" has aroused hopes
 for new trade in Britain.   A
 few traders foresee the open-
 ing of vast new markets in
 Eastern Europe once restrictions
 are removed, even though that
 area has never accounted for
 more than five percent of Brit-
 ain's exports.   The possibili-
 ties of an eightfold  increase
 in exports to the USSR were
 dramatized by Khrushchev's of-
 fer in April to buy 2.8 billion
 dollars worth of British goods
 over a five-year period.   Govern-
 ment spokesmen have emphasized
 that two thirds. of the; list of
 proposed goods is not subject
 to trade controls.
 In the competition for over-
 seas markets, many people are
 wary of a contest with a totali-
 tarian power that can manipu-
 late its commercial dealings
 for political ends, but some
 observers believe that Britain's
 SOVIET TRANSPORTATION IN
 Soviet goals for transpor-
 tation in the Sixth Five-Year
 Plan (1956-1960) are designed
 to keep transportation facili-
 ties abreast of the. country's
 fast economic development.
 They include increasing rail-
 way freight traffic by 42 per-
 cent, doubling highway and mari-
 time transport, and increasing
 oil pipeline traffic sixfold,
 long experience and special
 talents will ensure its even-
 tual triumph.   Reports of long
 delays in the construction of
 the Soviet-backed steel mill
 in India, and of Soviet back-
 tracking on the Aswan High Dam
 offer will support that limited
 self-confidence.
 In the meantime,  the cabi-
 net is reported by the American
 embassy to be deeply concerned
 over  the present threat of
 Soviet economic, political,
 .and psychological penetration,
 especially in the Middle East
 and South Asia.   Thus,London
 is emphasizing the counter-
 subversive activities of the
 Baghdad pact organization,
 and in April allowed the Singa-
 pore self-government talks to
 collapse rather than lose ef-
 fective control over internal
 security there.
 The government's contin-
 uing: efforts to offer induce-
 ments and rewards to friendly
 states are seen in such measures
 as raising the contribution to
 Libya by $1,400,000 and a pos-
 sible offer to provide Iran
 with some naval training and
 to conduct joint exercises.
 In view of budget stringencies,
 however, such efforts are ex-
 pected to remain .mea  r

 for laying twice as much track

 will be fulfilled.

 of reducing the role of trans-
 port as a factor in economic
 development.        Attempts  to re-
 duce the average length of
 freight and passenger haul and
 the instigation of regional
 self-sufficiency programs have
 succeeded only in easing the
 pressures tending to increase
 transportation's claim on Soviet
 resources.   During the current
 five-year plan any relative
 reduction in transport':t role
 is unlikely.
 Railroads will continue
 to carry about four fifths of
 total traffic, despite plans
 to increase the relative role
 of all other carriers.
 The Railroad Plan
 Currently haul-
 ing about 970 billion
 ton-kilometers (ton-
 nage carried times
 distance) per annum,
 the rail system is
 scheduled to carry
 42 percent more freight
 in 1960 than in 1955.
 The plan accordingly
 provides for (1) ad-
 dition of  approxi-
 mately 6,500 kilome-
 ters of new lines,
 (2) double-tracking
 of about 6,600 kilome-
 ters of existing lines,
 (3) replacement of
 65,000 kilometers
 of light duty rail
 with a new type ca-
 pable of supporting
 greater traffic den-
 sity, and (4) elec-
 trification of 8,100
 kilometers, or 3.5
 times the amount elec-
 trified in the Fifth
 Five-Year Plan.

 its targets,  the rail-

 operation, and an
 increase of 34 per-
 cent in labor pro-
 ductivity.   These
 goals will be facili-
 tated by the sched-
 uled delivery to
 the railroads of at
 least 255,000 high-
 capacity 4-axle
 freight cars and 18,-
 600 modern passenger
 cars.   Moreover, by
 1957,all cars are
 to be equipped with
 automatic couplings,
 and by 1959, auto-
 matic brakes are to
 be installed on all
 rolling stock.  Wid-
 er use is to be made
 of automatic bloc
 signaling' and of
 automatic devices
 for switching, load-
 ing and unloading of
 cars.
 The plan empha-
 sizes the necessity
 of decreasing the
 1955 average turn-
 around time of 6.2
 days by 15 percent.
 This goal, however,
 will prove exceed-
 ingly difficult to
 accomplish.  Any
 gains accomplished
 in decreasing. turn-
 around time by in-
 creasing average
 train speed will
 probably be offset
 by plans to expand
 agricultural and
 industrial activity
 PASSENGER
 PERCENTAGE BASED ON PASSENGER KILOMETERS
 SECRET
 As part of the
 emphasis on eastward
 expansion, new rail
 lines are projected
 for Central Asia,
 Northern Kazakhstan,
 the Urals, and adja-
 cent areas.   Of major
 importance is the
 line planned from the
 industrial city of
 Magnitogorsk westward
 to Abdulino, provid-
 ing a direct outlet
 from the South Sibe-
 rian trunkline to the
 European part of
 the country and by-
 passing the heavily
 used Chelyabinsk-Ufa
 line.   In addition,
 the Stalinsk-Abakan
 line at the other
 end of the South Si-
 berian is to be com-
 pleted.   Soviet work
 on the Trans-Sinkiang
 railway to China will
 extend from Aktogay
 on the Turkistan-
 Siberian Eailzoad to
 the Soviet border,
 and probably as far
 as Urumchi, 525 kil-
 ometers beyond the
 border.
 North of Leningrad,
 the Belomorsk-Murmansk
 line is to be double-
 tracked to within 100
 miles of Murmansk,
 and a line is being
 extended from the
 Kotlas-Vorkuta rail-
 road to the White Sea
 port of Mezen.   Work
 on the BAM (Baikal-
 Amur-Magistral) line
 north of Lake Baikal
 has been resumed,
 with the line possibly
 completed to Kirensk
 and even farther;

 Highway Objectives
 The Sixth Five-Year Plan
 makes little provision for
 highway construction.   Kagano-
 vich at the 20tt congress said
 of the country's highway net-
 work:   "It is necessary to
 say that we have few improved
 highways; the question of the
 development of a network of
 highways is awaiting solution.
 In the construction, repair
 and maintenance of highways
 great importance must be laid
 on local initiative,"
 The volume of highway
 traffic is scheduled to be
 doubled in 1960, which would
 bring performance to about 85
 billion ton-kilometers.  Vehi-
 cle production will be at an
 annual rate of 650,000 units
 by 1960, or about 46 percent
 above the 1955 rate.   The plan
 also emphasizes the production
 .Yeniaeysk                   .Kirensk
 USt-Nut
 and use of large-tonnage trail-
 ers and more efficient vehicle
 engines, both of which will be
 instrumental in increasing labor
 productivity to the planned
 level of 36 percent over 1955.
 Finally, a larger share of
 highway haulage is.to be placed
 under the administration of
 central motor pools to eliminate
 inefficiencies of transport in
 the agricultural, extractive
 and industrial ministries.
 Inland Waterway Program
 The plan envisages an in-
 crease in inland waterways
 freight traffic in 1960 by about
 80 percent over 1955, primarily
 through fleet expansion port
 improvement  and increased co-
 ordination with other carriers.
 However, co-ordination may not
 prove to be a key to success be-
 cause some shippers have gen-
 erally refused to ship by

 closed to navigation in some
 areas for as much as nine months
 a year.
 Physical improvements are
 planned to canal and river sys-
 tems.  Work has been resumed
 on Volga-Baltic waterway, which,
 when reconstructed, will improve
 the internal waterway system
 in the European USSR, allowing
 deeper-draft freight vessels,
 submarines and medium-draft
 destroyers to pass freely among
 the seas bbrdering western Rus-

 Additions to the river
 fleet, while replacing obsolete
 vessels in some cases, will ap-
 preciably increase the fleet's
 total capacity.  Vessels with
 a total of 720,000 horsepower
 will be added to the self-pro-
 pelled fleet.   In 1955 this

 had a cargo capacity of 9,656,000
 tons in 1955, will increase its
 total freight capacity by 2,245,-

 Plans for port improvement,
 which envisage considerable
 mechanization, are designed to
 overcome cargo delays and con-
 commitant increases in turn-

 import goods being carried
 in Soviet ships.      There will
 be a big increase in freight
 carriage between our Black Sea,
 Far Eastern, and other basins,
 and via the Northern Sea Route."
 The Sixth Five-Year Plan
 goal for the maritime fleet
 is to more than double the 1955
 performance;  The fleet is
 scheduled to receive 1,140,000
 tons of dry-cargo capacity and
 460,000 tons of'tanker tonnage.
 Since many of the fleet's'ves-
 sels are over-age, inefficient
 and slow,, making a retirement
 program highly desirable, the
 net gain in tonnage will prob-
 ably be somewhat less than
 35 percent.
 Reconstruction and develop-
 ment is projected for seaports
 in all areas of operation.
 The port'of Makhodka is given
 a high priority, indicating its
 importance in Far East opera-
 tions as an auxiliary port for
 nearby Vladivostok.  Other ports
 scheduled for improvements are
 Petropavlovsk (on Kamchatka
 Peninsula),,_Odessa, Zhdanov,
 Nikolayevsk, Leningrad, Murmansk
 and Vladivostok.  Emphasis is
 placed'on new piers, quays,
 and warehouses,: all to be highly
 mechanized.
 Civil. Air Transport
 The Sixth Five-Year Plan
 gives very little information
 on air transportation.   It
 provides for a 'doubling in air
 freight traffic and an-increase
 in the volume of passenger traf-
 fic by 3.8  times  the                 1955
 volume.   It also calls for mod-
 ernization and expansion of the
 operations of the civil air
 carrier, Aeroflot.  Reconstruc-
 tion of major airports is pro-
 jected as is the introduction
 into the fleet of fast, multi-
 seat  passenger,  planes,
 including jet and turbo-prop
 planes of Soviet manufacture.
 The TU-104 twin-engine jet went
 into serial production this year
 and flights over-certain Aero-
 flot routes are under way.
 Four-engine jet and turbo-prop
 transports are now under develop-
 ment.
 Although the plan does not
 provide for an increase in its
 network, Aeroflot can be ex-
 pected to extend its operations.
 In 1955, as a result of air
 agreements with Western coun-
 tries, traffic on USSR inter-
 national airlines increased
 significantly.  This expansion
 will probably continue during
 the Sixth Five-Year Plan period.
 The greatest increase in
 domestic air traffic in the
 Fifth Five-Year Plan was to
 distant regions of the north,
 Siberia and to the Far East.
 Khabarovsk airport, at the east-
 ern end of the important Moscow-
 Irkutsk-Khabarovsk route, was
 second only to Vnukovo airport
 at Moscow in the volume of civil
 air traffic, and Magadan rose
 to fifth place.  These areas
 will increase in importance
 as Aeroflot augments its route
 by additions from the regional
 administrations and from polar
 aviation..
 Pipeline Development
 The Sixth Five-Year Plan
 proposes the construction of
 14,500 kilometers of new trunk
 oil pipelines, which would al-
 most double the present net.
 New trunk lines will further
 serve to connect the Ural and
 Emba regions with each other
 and with the new lands area of
 northern Kazakhstan and central
 Asia.  Other lines will extend
 eastward to the area of Lake
 Bykal, and in the European USSR

 new lines will connect the Ural-
 Volga regions with the Kama
 area, with Moscow, and also
 several large industrialized
 centers to the north and south

 A sixfold  increase in
 annual pipeline traffic is pro-
 jected.   Such an increase would
 relieve the excessive freight-
 loading presently imposed on
 the railroads and cut transpor-
 tation costs as well, since
 transport by pipeline costs
 only one  third  that of rail.
 transport.
 Use of fuel gas is rela-
 tively new in the USSR, and as
 of 1955 the installed gas pipe-
 lines totaled only 5,260 kilo-
 meters.   The present plan calls
 for a fivefold  increase in the
 output of natural gas, a two-
 fold increase in manufactured
 gas, and the concurrent construc-
 tion of 9,000 kilometers of new
 gas transmission lines.   These
 proposed gas lines will be
 instrumental in exploiting the
 newly discovered natural gas re-
