 KEY JUDGMENTS
 Several significant events in Sino-Soviet relations in the past year
 have led us to reexamine the conclusions of NIE 13/11-84, completed in
 April 1984. In spite of the current leadership tensions apparent in
 Beijing and the recent succession of Mikhail Gorbachev as Secretary
 General in the Soviet Union, we judge that the Estimate's major
 conclusions are still valid:
 - Moscow's and Beijing's fundamental strategic outlooks will
 remain at odds.
 - The basic differences at the root of their animosity for more
 than two decades will remain; each side will continue to be
 deeply suspicious of the long-range intentions of the other.
 - The Chinese leadership will continue to see the positive eco-
 nomic and strategic value of China's relationship with the
 United States.
 - There will be a further warming in the atmosphere of the
 relationship and expansion in trade, scientific, technological,
 cultural, and educational ties.
 The advances in the relationship over the past year have been
 generally consistent with the Estimate's description of the most likely
 course in Sino-Soviet relations: the level of hostility between Moscow
 and Beijing will decrease, and there will be additional agreements on
 trade and economic and other such secondary matters. These changes
 have come, however, a little more quickly and have gone a little further
 than the Estimate of a year ago held likely.
 Both Beijing and Moscow probably genuinely desire ways to lower
 tensions for a variety of domestic political and economic reasons. Each
 side appears to be testing the other's flexibility and intentions-to
 determine whether something substantial can be attained at low cost.
 Moreover, overtures by both sides earlier this year probably were also
 intended for the benefit of third parties, particularly the United States.
 Deng Xiaoping, for example, has sent signals that he wants more US co-
 operation in helping to bring about reunification with Taiwan. Beijing's
 positive gestures to the Soviets could be partly designed to pressure
 Washington to be more responsive on this issue and less receptive to
 Taiwan's interests in receiving more modern arms.

 SECRET
 We probably will witness continued advancement in the secondary
 aspects of the relationship as well as limited party-to-party contacts that
 may gradually take on a more formal character:
 - Additional trade, scientific, technical, educational, and cultural
 agreements will be signed; the Soviets will help refurbish a few
 factories built with their aid during the 1950s.
 - An agreement to open at least two, possibly four, consulates
 probably will be signed; additional border crossing points will be
 opened.
 - There will probably be additional state-to-state contacts, such as
 parliamentary exchanges; there may be consultations between
 Foreign Ministers and possibly Premiers.
 - There could be some agreement on Confidence Building Mea-
 sures along the border, such as mutual advanced notification of
 troop movements or exercises.
 Neither Moscow nor Beijing, however, will make the concessions
 necessary for their relationship to go beyond the bounds outlined above.
 They almost certainly will not make any significant progress on matters
 related to Afghanistan or Indochina. We now believe that talks on
 border territorial issues are more likely to resume than the Estimate
 predicted. However, even if border talks do begin again, we judge that
 resolution of the border territorial disputes as well as regional security
 issues will remain elusive. An understanding to "thin out" or withdraw
 some forces from the border is slightly more possible.
 The most likely course of Sino-Soviet relations will not harm any
 significant US interests. We judge that for the next two years and
 probably longer Beijing will not move to an equidistant position in its
 relations with Moscow and Washington. Chinese leaders keenly appre-
 ciate the United States' value as a strategic counterweight to Moscow
 and as a source of much-needed economic and military technology.
 There are, however, several uncertainties that could affect our
 analysis:
 - Moscow, under Gorbachev's new leadership, could make a
 greater-than-expected effort to accommodate Chinese security
 concerns, which might lead to a more substantial
 rapprochement.
 - A power struggle could erupt within the Chinese leadership
 before or after Deng dies. We believe that disagreements over a
 number of issues, primarily the pace and scope of economic
 reform and leadership changes, have strained relations among

 senior Chinese leaders. Questions concerning relations with the
 United States and the USSR have become part of these debates.
 Given our uncertainty over the outcome of these debates, we
 cannot rule out the possibility of Beijing's taking steps sooner
 than we anticipate to further improve relations with Moscow.
 - Deng's ambitious economic reforms could experience serious
 problems, which could lead to a weakening of his political
 position and that of his chosen successors. A retreat from the
 goals of Deng's economic program would diminish one of the
 Chinese motivations for good relations with the United States-
 the need for US technology and investment. However, because
 the Soviets are not likely to make major force reductions along
 the border, or to back away from their goals in Indochina and
 Afghanistan, any new leadership in Beijing would face the same
 strategic situation that currently limits close Sino-Soviet political
 relations.
 - A deterioration of relations between the United States and
 China over Taiwan could lead Beijing to attempt a much more
 even balance in its relations with the two superpowers than
 currently exists. We do not believe, however, that in loosening
 ties to the United States the Chinese would move substantially
 closer to the USSR.
 Crises over Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indochina, Thailand, and
 other areas could lead to a new estrangement in Sino-Soviet
 relations.
 Soviet moves to draw North Korea closer could intensify
 Chinese suspicions of Soviet intentions.
 If our most likely scenario proves wrong and Moscow and Beijing
 go substantially further in improving their relationship, then US
 interests would be directly and adversely affected. Moves such as
 rapidly establishing more formal party-to-party contacts, an agreement
 to withdraw or draw down Soviet forces on the Sino-Soviet/Sino-
 Mongolian border, and resolution of the border territorial disputes
 would have a powerful impact on international perceptions. Other
 countries might conclude that such developments meant that the United
 States was "losing" a strategic asset and that Moscow had eased the
 threat of a two-front war, thus strengthening its position vis-a-vis
 NATO. More important, Soviet leaders might conclude that the general
 strategic danger to the USSR had eased, leading them to adopt an even
 more aggressive attitude toward the United States.

 DISCUSSION
 What Has Happened
 1. Several significant events have occurred since the
 Estimate was completed in April of last year (for
 details, see Chronology in the annex). Two of these
 events have been pivotal in further warming the
 atmosphere of Sino-Soviet relations and increasing
 trade and economic ties:
 - First Deputy Premier Arkhipov was received in
 Beijing in December 1984, making him the
 highest ranking Soviet official to visit China in 16
 years.'
 - Mikhail Gorbachev was appointed Soviet Gener-
 al Secretary after the death of Chernenko.
 2. To create a positive atmosphere and ensure the
 success of Arkhipov's visit, Beijing made unusual
 efforts, such as remaining silent on the fifth anniversa-
 ry of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and briefly
 withdrawing troops from the Sino-Vietnamese border.
 The visit was described by both sides as a success.
 Moscow and Beijing signed an expanded trade agree-
 ment plus new agreements on economic cooperation
 and exchanges in science and technology. Moreover,
 Vice Premier Yao Yilin was quoted by the official
 Chinese news service as calling Arkhipov "comrade,"
 and Chen Yun alluded to the socialist nature of both
 countries.
 3. Following Chernenko's death, both sides-but
 particularly the Chinese-made a series of symbolic
 gestures signaling a desire to improve relations. Gorba-
 chev's acceptance speech called for serious improve-
 ment in relations with China on a reciprocal basis.
 Unlike the last speech attributed to Chernenko-a 22
 February USSR Supreme Soviet election address-
 Gorbachev's remarks did not mention "serious politi-
 cal differences" dividing Moscow and Beijing. Follow-
 ing this, Chinese National People's Congress Standing
 Committee Chairman Peng Zhen called Gorbachev
 "comrade." At a private Chinese request, Gorbachev
 met with Vice Premier Li Peng, who conveyed party
 General Secretary Hu Yaobang's congratulatory mes-
 sage. This was the first Chinese party-to-party message
 ' Late Premier Aleksey Kosygin made an airport stopover in 1969
 and talked with the late Premier Zhou Enlai.
 Results of Arkhipov's Visit,
 December 1984
 ? Agreed to sign a five-year trade accord during the
 first half of 1985 aimed at raising the level of trade
 to US $5 or $6 billion by 1990 and increasing trade
 in 1985 by about 60 to 70 percent.
 ? Agreed to establish a joint committee on economic,
 trade, scientific, and technical cooperation to super-
 vise and implement agreements and protocols.
 ? Agreed to exchange scientific and technical knowl-
 edge and groups, scholars, and experts, as well as
 train each other's technical personnel.
 ? Agreed to discuss Soviet help in refurbishing fac-
 tories built with Soviet assistance during the 1950s
 and to exchange and mutually study production
 technology.
 ? Agreed to hold bilateral economic talks at the
 "specialist" level in early 1985.
 ? Agreed to consider signing a cultural cooperation
 agreement.
 in 18 years.2 Li also referred to the USSR as a
 "socialist" country for the first time since the 1960s
 and expressed a willingness to raise the political
 dialogue to the same level as the dialogues on econom-
 ics, culture, and technology. This series of important
 gestures led us to reexamine trends in Sino-Soviet
 relations.
 Chinese and Soviet Motivations
 4. We have little reporting about either side's mo-
 tives and calculations in this latest round of symbolic
 gestures. We believe that both sides probably have
 been engaged in tactical maneuvering, testing each
 other's flexibility and intentions and determining
 whether something substantial can be attained at low
 cost. Both Beijing and Moscow probably genuinely
 desire to lower tensions for a variety of domestic
 political and economic reasons.
 5. We believe that the recent shifts in atmosphere
 are to a large extent also intended to influence the

 behavior and perceptions of third parties, particularly
 the United States. China would like to obtain greater
 room for maneuvering between the United States and
 the USSR while in the long run establishing itself as the
 swing partner in the triangular relationship. Beijing
 does not want to appear to be standing still in the
 tripolar relationship while the other two sides negoti-
 ate. Instead, Beijing probably decided to see if its hand
 could be strengthened in dealing with both superpow-
 ers. Since December, Deng has sent signals that he
 wants more US cooperation in helping to bring about
 reunification with Taiwan. Chinese gestures to the
 Soviets could be designed in part as a prelude to
 pressuring Washington on this issue, or as a means to
 test US susceptibility to such pressure. The Chinese
 may also hope that an improved relationship with
 Moscow would enhance Beijing's contacts and influ-
 ence with Eastern Europe and other Soviet allies.
 6. Chinese domestic policy disputes and political
 frictions probably also have played a part in China's
 positive gestures to the Soviet Union in March.F7
 disc
 ments over a number of issues-primarily the pace
 and scope of economic reform and leadership
 changes-have strained relations among senior leaders.
 Questions concerning relations with the United States
 and the USSR have become part of these debates. We
 are less clear about Deng's role in the positive gestures
 to Moscow-whether Deng was merely placating con-
 servative critics or whether Deng also believed the
 time was right for more balance in relations with the
 superpowers. In either case, we have no convincing
 evidence of a clearly defined group in the Chinese
 leadership that is pushing for a major reorientation of
 Chinese foreign policy or that holds a very different
 strategic outlook. We strongly believe, moreover, that
 no specifically pro-Soviet faction exists in the Chinese
 leadership. Debates in Beijing probably focus on the
 degree of "tilt" toward the United States or the USSR
 and on how to find a balance that best serves Chinese
 interests.
 7. On the Soviet side, we have little hard evidence
 concerning Gorbachev's foreign policy agenda. Initial
 statements by him suggest a desire to improve relations
 with China. The Soviets have been assiduously culti-
 vating Gorbachev's image-domestically, but also for
 foreign audiences-as a dynamic, active leader. Gor-
 bachev has already assumed a far more demanding
 schedule of meetings with foreign officials than either
 Andropov or Chernenko. Moscow may view relations
 with the Chinese as an area of opportunity to project a
 more activist foreign policy at the perceived expense
 of Washington.
 the Gorbachev leadership wants to
 establish an image of toughness and immunity to
 pressure toward all the USSR's adversaries, clients, and
 allies. This aim constrains Soviet flexibility in dealing
 with the real security issues that concern China. We
 believe Moscow is looking for modest improvements in
 relations with Beijing, but only in areas that would not
 necessitate fundamental Soviet concessions.
 8. Each side appears to doubt that the other is
 prepared to offer substantial concessions.
 officials are optimistic about a further warming in
 relations but skeptical that Beijing's gestures will lead
 to substantive changes. For their part, the Chinese
 have also confided that they believe it will be several
 years before Gorbachev will have enough power, even
 if he has the desire, to reorient Soviet policy toward
 Beijing.
 Strategic Constraints and Allied Concerns
 9. There is no evidence that either Beijing or
 Moscow has altered its fundamental strategic outlook
 toward the other. We are confident that the basic
 differences at the root of their animosity for more than
 two decades remain and that the underlying issues that
 divide China and the USSR, as outlined in the Esti-
 mate, are still valid. Thus:
 - Each views the other as harboring expansionistic
 ambitions that clash with its own regional politi-
 cal aspirations.
 - Ideological estrangement and nationalistic hostil-
 ities persist.
 - Beijing still has some bitter memories of the high
 costs of a very close association with Moscow.
 10. The three obstacles posed by Beijing-Soviet
 occupation of Afghanistan, Soviet support to the Viet-
 namese in Cambodia, and Soviet forces along the
 Chinese border and in Mongolia-still remain a signif-
 icant constraint on improvement in Sino-Soviet politi-
 cal relations. We conclude that the Chinese were
 trying to maximize their negotiating room before the
 recent Sixth Round of Talks in Moscow, either by
 omitting all references to the three security issues or
 by elliptically mentioning only more general "obsta-
 cles."

 Moreover, while the talks were in session and after-
 ward, Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yaobang reiterated the
 importance of removing these obstacles. We believe
 these statements were intended, among other reasons,
 to put pressure on the USSR to respond to Chinese
 security concerns.
 to obtain US technology and weapons and enhancing
 Taiwan's leverage with Washington. Moscow is simi-
 larly concerned about the possible damage to its
 relations with friendly countries and allies, most im-
 portant, Vietnam, India, and North Korea.
 The Sixth Round of Talks
 14. The Sixth Round of Talks, which was held in
 Moscow from 9 to 22 April, was the first formal
 opportunity since Gorbachev's accession for Moscow
 and Beijing to engage in concrete bargaining. On the
 basis of public press reports and private official state-
 ments, we conclude that the talks did not result in any
 significant concessions by either side. F_
 11. In recent years, top Chinese officials have urged
 Moscow to accommodate them on at least one of the
 three issues. This suggests China's willingness to im-
 prove relations further if the Soviets begin to deal with
 one of the issues, without the Chinese dropping their
 demand that the USSR give them satisfaction eventu-
 ally on all three. Lately, Deng Xiaoping, Foreign
 Minister Wu Xueqian, and Vice Foreign Minister
 Qian Qichen have all reiterated the Chinese position
 that Soviet support to Vietnam in Cambodia might be
 the "easiest" one to solve or is the most important of
 the three obstacles. The Chinese probably made such
 recent remarks in part to encourage Vietnamese suspi-
 cions of Soviet intentions.
 12. On the Soviet side, there are fundamental inhi-
 bitions to making concessions regarding the three
 obstacles. On Afghanistan and Indochina, agreeing to
 negotiate or to compromise by any degree would
 undermine the legitimacy of these Soviet interests,
 while major concessions would blunt Moscow's efforts
 to project its influence and power in Asia. Although
 the Soviets have some room to maneuver on force
 deployments near the border-and possible economic
 incentives for a thinning out of active forces-they
 value the existing force balance as a source of pressure
 on Chinese behavior. In return for easing that pres-
 sure, the Soviets would want a significant political
 concession rather than just reciprocal military moves
 from the weaker party.
 13. Concern for the perceptions of allies and other
 friendly countries is yet another constraint on the pace
 and nature of improvements in Sino-Soviet relations.
 The Chinese have made special efforts to reassure the
 United States and other friendly countries that no
 dramatic change in policy toward the Soviet Union is
 expected, and that they are pessimistic about progress
 on political and security issues. Beijing is aware that a
 significant breakthrough in Sino-Soviet relations fol-
 lowing such private reassurances would strain relations
 with the United States, Japan, Thailand, Pakistan, and
 others. If relations with the Soviet Union move too far,
 too fast, Beijing runs the risk of undercutting its effort
 claims both2oA]
 Beijing and Moscow were disappointed that the talks
 were setpiece presentations rather than real exchanges.
 China's dissatisfaction with the outcome was apparent
 in its official press account of Vice Foreign Minister
 Qian Qichen's meeting with Foreign Minister Gromy-
 ko. Xinhua, the official Chinese press, highlighted
 Qian's reminder that Moscow had expressed a wish for
 "significant improvement" in relations and that "Chi-
 na waits for the Soviet Union to make a move in this
 regard."
 15. The Soviets repeated in the talks their previous
 call for a "juridical document" governing relations (a
 bilateral declaration of principles) and a resumption of
 border talks. They offered to discuss mutual troop thin
 outs along their common border but refused to talk
 about their forces in Mongolia. The Chinese parried
 these suggestions by insisting that there must first be
 progress on outstanding regional issues. No date was
 set for official talks at a higher level, such as between
 Foreign Ministers.
 16. There were, however, two new wrinkles. First,
 both sides agreed to hold a bilateral conference relat-
 ing to the Sino-Soviet border. We do not know the
 agenda of the conference. The Soviets have been
 pushing for a resumption of the border talks that were
 suspended at Chinese initiative in June 1978. We
 believe the Chinese may have agreed now to only a
 conference in order to probe for Moscow's. possible
 proposals before deciding whether to participate in the
 border talks once again.
 17. Secondly, a joint press statement carried in
 TASS following the talks' conclusion mentioned, for
 the first time, that progress in "political relations" was
 expected in the future. Beijing expressed interest in

 better political ties when Vice Premier Li Peng met
 Gorbachev at Chernenko's funeral. Mention of this
 point following the talks reflects an improved climate
 in relations. We assume that both sides are leaving the
 possibility open for more movement during the com-
 ing year, perhaps during Vice Premier Yao Yilin's visit
 to Moscow this July or at the Seventh Round of Talks
 this fall. The Soviets, in particular, have gone out of
 their way since the talks' conclusion to reaffirm their
 interest in improving ties through positive recent
 statements by both Gorbachev and Politburo Member
 Aliyev.
 What's Ahead
 18. The developments listed in the inset are those
 we judge will occur over the next two years. In
 addition, we believe that there will be additional
 party-to-party contacts and that these contacts may
 gradually acquire a more formal and routine charac-
 ter. In pursuing additional party-to-party contacts,
 both sides could agree to reestablish trade union ties
 and exchange propaganda officials and/or press dele-
 gations. During future leadership visits, increasing
 mention could be made of party titles, and written as
 well as oral party greetings could be exchanged.
 19. In conversation with US officials, the Chinese
 continue to claim that party-to-party relations with the
 Soviet Union will not be resumed. We are somewhat
 skeptical of these statements in light of Hu Yaobang's
 greetings to Gorbachev and the joint press statement
 following the last round of talks. But, because of these
 reassurances to the United States and other friendly
 countries, as well as for other reasons, we believe that
 Beijing will try to maintain a deliberate ambiguity
 concerning the character of their party contacts with
 Moscow for the next several years.
 20. The resumption of Sino-Soviet party relations
 would clearly enhance the image of a closer overall
 relationship. The real content of that relationship is
 another matter, however. Considerations of ideology
 and leadership politics could intrude to complicate the
 relationship in new ways. China has embarked on an
 ambitious course of liberalizing economic reform that
 is politically contentious. The Soviet Union under
 Gorbachev is, at the same time, trying to hammer out
 a new, probably much more conservative, course of
 economic revival that is also bound to be politically
 controversial. Soviet elites are certainly watching Chi-
 nese reforms, some hopeful and others fearful of their
 success. Interest by each side in the other's leadership
 Projected Developments in Sino-Soviet Relations
 in the Next Two Years
 - The long-term trade agreement will be signed this
 July.
 - The Soviets will help refurbish a few factories
 built with their aid during the 1950s.
 - There will be additional agreements on economic,
 educational, and cultural matters.
 - There will be additional state-to-state contacts,
 such as parliamentary exchanges; there may be
 consultations between Foreign Ministers and possi-
 bly Premiers.
 - An agreement to open two, possibly four, consul-
 ates will be signed; additional border crossing
 points will be opened.
 - The number of Soviet economic and technical
 advisers in China will increase. (We are unsure
 how many, if any, Soviet advisers are currently
 stationed in China.)
 - The number of Sino-Soviet students will increase.
 (Approximately 70 Soviet students currently are in
 China and 70 Chinese students in the Soviet
 Union. In comparison, for the academic year
 1984/85 there were 15,000 Chinese students in the
 United States.)
 could lead to the same sort of suspicions about internal
 political interference that bedeviled Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions in the 1950s and 1960s. Internal disputes over
 economic reforms on one side could lead to the use of
 the other side's performance as a polemical foil,
 producing new ideological frictions. China has before
 it the tricky doctrinal problem of explaining how a
 "socialist" USSR can also be hegemonist. Historical
 suspicions and conflicting strategic interests will tend
 to make expanded party ties as fractious as the overall
 relationship because restoration of such ties could give
 China greater freedom to expand contacts with pro-
 Soviet parties and to compete with the Soviets for
 influence within the Communist movement.
 21. I                           the Chinese have
 agreed to a conference to discuss border relations.
 Therefore, we now judge that it is more probable than
 the Estimate predicted that the border talks on territo-
 rial issues will resume. Such negotiations may lead to
 agreement on Confidence Building Measures such as
 mutual notification of troop exercises along their

 common border. Even if border talks resume, we
 believe the current stalemate on the territorial issues
 will continue through the next two years.
 22. We further assess that resolution of broader
 security concerns will remain elusive and that the
 following situations will continue:
 - Soviet presence in Afghanistan and support to
 Vietnam.
 - Chinese support to Afghan insurgents, commit-
 ment to the Khmer resistance, and military
 pressure on the Vietnamese border.
 An Alternative Outcome on the Border
 23. While it is highly unlikely that Moscow and
 Beijing will make significant progress on the Afghan or
 Indochinese issues in the next two years, it is somewhat
 more likely that they could reach an understanding to
 reduce forces along the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongo-
 lian borders. The constraints against such moves as
 listed in the Estimate-such as the limited room to
 pull back Soviet forces because of the presence in the
 easternmost sector near the border of large vulnerable
 cities and the Trans-Siberian Railroad-are still valid.
 However, the military imbalance favoring the Soviets
 gives them the option to make some conciliatory
 gestures, if they choose to do so, while retaining their
 military superiority. For example, the Soviets could
 withdraw one or more of their divisions stationed in
 the Soviet Far East near the Chinese border or in
 Mongolia. They could also thin out various units by
 reducing manpower or relocating selected equipment.
 24. Likewise, an agreement on the territorial dis-
 putes would require strong leadership in both capitals
 and a willingness to compromise. We do not know
 how such negotiations might proceed-what conces-
 sions might be offered by each side and how the other
 might respond. We believe, however, that the Soviets
 might be willing to concede some of the minor islands
 in the Amur and Ussuri Rivers as well as to agree to
 some compromise on the Pamirs; but they would be
 less likely to yield on ownership of Tarabarov and
 Bol'shoy Ussuriysk Islands (called Heixiazi by the
 Chinese), opposite the Soviet city of Khabarovsk and a
 section of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. The Chinese, in
 turn, would probably want to consider any compre-
 hensive territorial border settlement in conjunction
 with Soviet force withdrawals, particularly of some
 divisions in Mongolia, and admittance by the Soviets
 of the "unequal" nature of the Tsarist treaties. A key
 indicator of China's desire to compromise on this issue
 would be its willingness to drop its demand that the
 USSR withdraw its troops from all "disputed areas"
 while a territorial settlement is negotiated. This de-
 mand has prevented any progress in past negotiations.
 Implications for the United States
 25. If, as we believe most likely, the USSR and
 China limit the improvement in their relationship to
 such measures as trade, cultural, and educational
 agreements, limited party-to-party exchanges, and
 some Confidence Building Measures on the border-
 important US interests will not be significantly affect-
 ed. For their part, the Chinese continue to recognize
 their need for good relations with the United States:
 - Beijing remains committed to modernizing its
 economy, for which it needs Western, and par-
 ticularly US, technology and investment. China
 has much to gain from a long-term economic
 relationship with Japan and the West-particu-
 larly the United States-and less from one with
 the Soviet Union, especially as-' Beijing moves
 forward on its economic reform.
 - Beijing remains committed to modernizing its
 armed forces gradually and needs Western, par-
 ticularly US, arms and military technology.
 26. Hence, certainly for the next two years and
 probably well beyond, China is not likely to adopt a
 genuinely equidistant position in its relations with
 Moscow and with Washington and its allies. Patterns
 may be modified somewhat, but not substantially,
 from the current imbalance in relations with the
 superpowers. For example, in the academic year
 1984/85, there were some 15,000 Chinese students in
 the United States and approximately 70 in the Soviet
 Union. Last year China's total trade with the United
 States was about $6 billion and with Japan $13 billion,
 compared with just over $1 billion with the Soviet
 Union. It would be a long time, if ever, before such
 statistics would balance out.
 27. Most important, the US-Sino-Soviet triangular
 relationship probably will never be really "balanced"
 as long as both Beijing and Washington believe the
 Soviet Union is the primary threat to their security.
 Sino-US military contacts have suffered a setback with
 the postponement of the US port call to Shanghai.
 However, as long as the US relationship with China, in
 general, continues to progress and the Chinese do not
 fundamentally alter their strategic outlook, Moscow

 will find it hard to use China as an effective "card"
 with the United States, and it will be difficult for
 China to play the USSR against the United States.
 28. In the coming months, Beijing may try to press
 Washington into a more direct role in promoting
 negotiations for the reunification of Taiwan. We do
 not believe, however, that the Chinese want the
 Taiwan issue to impede overall relations with Wash-
 ington, and they will not revert to former confronta-
 tional, badgering tactics unless they perceive the Unit-
 ed States as violating its commitment to a "One
 China" policy or agreements on arms sales to Taiwan.
 A deterioration of relations between the United States
 and China over such issues could lead China to
 attempt a far greater balance in its relations with the
 two superpowers than currently exists. This could lead
 the USSR to be more demanding toward Beijing,
 however. We do not believe that modestly increased
 frictions with the United States would move the
 Chinese substantially closer to the USSR.
 29. Given our uncertainty over the outcome of
 current policy debates in Beijing, we cannot rule out
 the possibility of China's taking additional steps much
 sooner than we anticipate to improve relations with
 Moscow further. If Beijing and Moscow do go further
 than we expect in improving relations, then US inter-
 ests will be affected. Moves such as reaching a compre-
 hensive agreement on border issues involving a reduc-
 tion in Soviet forces would probably have a greater
 impact on international perceptions than the actual
 substance of such agreements or ties should merit.
 Other countries might interpret such developments as
 meaning the United States was "losing" a strategic
 asset while the Soviets were lessening the threat of a
 two-front war and, thus, strengthening their position
 vis-a-vis NATO. More important, Soviet leaders might
 also conclude that the strategic danger to the USSR
 had eased, and this might lead them to adopt a more
 aggressive attitude toward the United States. We do
 not foresee a resolution of Sino-Soviet differences over
 Afghanistan and Indochina in our time frame. Howev-
 er, US interests would be served to the extent that the
 Soviets in pursuit of a closer relationship with Beijing
 made concessions regarding these issues.
 30. We also do not rule out the possibility of a new
 estrangement in Sino-Soviet relations over the next two
 years. Such a development could spring from many
 sources: an increase in Chinese support to the Afghan
 resistance groups, escalation of Vietnam's military
 campaign in Cambodia and along the border of
 Thailand, Soviet moves to draw North Korea closer, a
 more overt Soviet military threat to Pakistan or prog-
 ress in Moscow's covert attempts to destabilize Presi-
 dent Zia, as well as a variety of other potential crises
 around the world. Up to a point, the United States
 benefits from a more hostile Sino-Soviet relationship.
 Beijing would probably be more receptive to US
 policies and cooperate more fully against Soviet ac-
 tions around the world.
 31. Finally, our analysis might be altered:
 - If a power struggle erupts within the Chinese
 leadership before or after Deng dies that results
 in the weakening of his chosen successors.
 - If Deng's ambitious economic reforms experi-
 ence serious problems, which in turn lead to a
 weakening of Deng's political position or those of
 his chosen successors.
 - If Moscow under Gorbachev's direction makes a
 greater-than-expected effort to accommodate the
 Chinese.
 A retreat from the goals of Deng's economic program
 would diminish one of the Chinese motivations for
 good relations with the United States-the need for US
 technology and investment. This retreat could be
 accompanied by a surge of anti-Westernism that
 might be directed particularly against the United
 States. However, because the Soviets are not likely to
 make major force reductions along the border, or to
 back away from their goals in Indochina and Afghani-
 stan, any new leadership in Beijing would face the
 same strategic situation that currently inhibits close
 Sino-Soviet political relations.
