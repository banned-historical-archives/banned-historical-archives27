DODD CONCERNING A 
OGY PUBLISHED BY THE COM-
M/Tfirg ON FOREIGN RELATIONS 
ON tent SITUATION- IN THE DO-
MINICAN REPUBLIC 
str.-PoLertioutT. Mr. President, the 
mentor Senator from Connecticut (Mr. 
Dom) ham today Issued a press release 
entitled -Senator Doss Charges Foreign 
Relations Publication on Dominican 
Crbris Slanted Against Administration." 
The allegation Is that the ettrono10417

I 'fhb& it Is inappropriate to come in 
at this late hour and try to change the 
site without any provision for money 
to buy the site. The bill merely provides 
for A sits In the vicinity of the Pennell-
yank Avenue development Merit= It 
Ileallig,t0 me this is quite realistic. If it 
had been provided for originalk and we 
had been able in mit a alga 1t wOuld be 
enotter matter, but a greet amount of 
time, money, and effort have been-ax. 
tended on the development of the site. 
toq4at froe to tee to change it now. It 
nt that fact. I think it comes 
Weald destroy the present concept al-
together. 
Mr. MORSE. Ur. President, I am 
very glad that the Senator from Ar-
tiness has commented on the pending 
Cultural Center site. Ass member of the 
District of Columbia Conunittee. let me 
my that in view of the developmetits, I 
believe it is an excellent choice. It would 
be a great mistake to try to disrupt the 
megram now by getting Into controversy 
over location of the center. The pro-
gram is coming along nicely. 
As the Senator from Arkansas knows, 
is is expected that a substantial drive 
will he conducted to obtain private funds 
and contributions. Our citizens have 
been led to believe that the site has been 
agreed upon. 
Mr. FULBRICIHT. Some $15 million 
has been raised privately. 
Mr. MORSE. Yes, the Senator is cor-
rect, but not only that, as we look at the 
situation in retrospect, and when we take 
Into account the plans which are now In 
the blueprint stage_ ,for other develop-
ments in the Menet of Columbia, I be-
lieve that it is an excellent site. 
This may be a sentimental argument 
on my part, but I believe it is a most 
appropriate site in view of the fact that 
President Kennedy's burial Place Is just 
scram the river, with Its everlasting 
torr,li aflame. Thus, this center will be 
among other shrines in the area, such 
as the Unooln Memorial, the Jefferson 
Memorial, and other memorials. The 
Cultural Center Is, after all, being built 
en a orest memorial to our great Presi-
dent Kennedy, and is most appropriately 
loaded at the site which hes been 
selected. 
Accordingly. I sincere/1 hope that 
plans for completing the Center will pro-
ceed without any controversy being 
raised at, this date over its location. 
Mr. FULBIRIGHT. I thank the 
Senator from Oregon for Ids comments, 
entirety preps-late. 
1, 
J. 
NOL-
critical of adminletratien policy In the 
Dominican Republic. The remarks of 
the senior Senator from Connoitiosit hie 
eluded complaints that the sisrondloCI 
did not bear statements favorabie to the 
position of the administratism. 
The facts are as follows: 
Fh-st. 11m document to which the sen. 
tor assuttor refers was termed In olleb! 
Jut, for use at the econafttee hrNMI*. 
ken with Its effort to learn in dated of 
developments in the Doeninicem Repditio. 
It was compiled, u noted in the prefans. 
from material "collected with the mead-
since of the Legislative Reference thrift, 
of the Library of Congress. the Depart-
ment of State, and the staff of the Ccen-
inittee on Poreign Relations." Because 
or shortage of time, the staff of the com-
mittee In compiling the chronology made 
extensive use of a research instrument to 
which it subscribes entitled "Deadline 
Data." 
Second. The statement of the senior 
Senator from Connecticut leaves the Im-
pression that the asintinistration views 
were not adequately Presented in the 
chronology. Members should note, how-
ever, that the chronoloaY and the ac-
companying printed material includes 
not only a number of doetnnents issued 
by the Organization of American States, 
but six statements by President Johneon, 
aed a number of statements by the De-
partment of State and one by Ambas-
sador Stevenson. 
Third. I do wish to expres my regret 
that it has not been possible for the 
seedor Senator from Conneetteut liar. 
Doul to attend meetings of the Mande* 
Relations Committee on this subject. 
Much of the material to which he re-
ferred has been considered by the oont-
Inittee. 
? Fourth. Finally,, I wish the Raceme to 
show that all at the witnesses which the 
committee beard at the sessions net at-
tended by the Senator from Connecticut 
were administration witnesses, save one. 
We heard the testimony of Elecretery of 
State Rusk. Under Secretary of State 
Mann, Deputy Seeretaqr of Defense 
Vanee, Ambassador Bennett, Admiral 
Reborn. Director of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency. and Assistant Secretary of 
State for American Republke Affairs 
Vaughn, The only non-Government wit-
ness'called before UoLcommittee was the 
former Governor of Puerto Moo. the 
Honorable Lula Mufios-Marin. 
Investrdations at sets of the executive 
department by their very nature, es the 
Senator well knows, put the burden an 
the administration to prove that its ac-
tions were correct. I believe that a fair 
criticism of the committee might be that 
it put too much time and effort Into the 
ministate:a of Government 'Mumma 
and not enough Into esatutriatlau of 
Government critics. 
The committee has met on 13 different 
occasions.some 'MO Pales of 
testimony. 43?17= the meetings have 
been 2 or 3 hours In length. The senior 
Senator from Connecticut attended-one 
of them meetings. and a search et the 
oomanittee records indicates that he has 
not seen fit to eansult tbe tranoidete of 
those hearings.

As those interested in this field know, 
there are enough forces in the economy mili-
tating against growth ?f small and medium-
eiZed business without adding sledge-ham-
mer blows from the disproportionate admin-
istration of Federal research and develop-
ment funds in favor of the giants in each 
industry. 
LOW PERCENTAGE OF FEDERAL R. & D, FUNDS 
AWARDED TO SMALL BUSINESS 
Yet, we have the spectale of about 85 
percent of all Federal research and develop-
ment funds being awarded, under the system 
of classification used by the National Science 
Foundation, to large companies Of more than 
5,000 employees. Medium-sized companies 
of from 1,000 to 5,000 employees receive about 
9 percent, with small businesses having less 
than 1,000 egaployees receiving only about 
6 percent of these enormous sums. (Most 
recent figures from National Science Founda-
tion, 1962.) 
Of course, the agency which has the 
greatest effect upon these figures and trends 
i.e the Department of Defense, which spent 
more than 70 percent of "all Federal R. & D. 
Money in 1961 and still spends more than 
half. It is also pertinent to note that NASA, 
which now spends close to 30 percent has 
increasingly adopted the Department of De-
fense,position. 
CONCENTRATION BAISEs /SSITE OF CIvIL-1y1ILI-
, TAY BALANCE 
To illustrate the seriousness of the concen-
tration issue, particularly in the Defense 
Department, may I quote the testimony of 
Dr. Robert L. Longinotti, chairman of the 
rootlet/nes Department of Michigan State 
University, before the Senate Small Business 
Committee in 1963, as follows: 
"The Government R. & D. contracts ap-
pear to be highly concentrated among the 
very large firms. While small business 
averages around 16 to 17 percent of Depart-
ment Of Dcfense procurement, when it comes 
to research and development small business 
accounts for some 2 to 3.5 percent. In fiscal 
year 1961, 20 corporations accounted for 
nearly 75 percent (of total military R. & D.). 
"Is it not inconsistent?not to say danger-
ous?for the Federal Government to nurture 
such, concentration in tike technologically 
most advanced elds which can be pre-
empted by the particular firms selected by 
military officials?" ("Economic Aspects of 
Patent Policies," hearings, Mar. 8, 1963, p. 
121.) 
The seriousness of this matter of selection 
is indicated by the fact that in fiscal year 
1902, 97 percent of DOD research awards 
Were :Made ojc4 nonprice, noncompetitive 
basis, (Hearings, testimony of Dr. R. J. 
Barber, Southern Methodist University Law 
School, p. 52.) 
? It should be further noted that for the 
same year, 10 firms received 56 percent of 
DOD's total research money; and for NASA, 
the top 10 companies received 51 percent. 
Furthermore, five of these contractors are on 
both lists. (Hearings, loc. cit., Mar. 7, 1963, 
p. 56-7.) 
CONCENTRATION OF PATENT ACQUISITIONS 
Specifically as to patent acquisitions, a 
Department of Justice study for the 5-year 
period ending in 1956 found that, among 
defense contractors, the top 15 companies ac-
counted for 3,559 patents out of 6,788 as-
signed, for a total of 52 percent. (Hearings, 
loc. cit., p. 122.) I would urge that the sub-
committee obtain the updated figures, and 
make a judgment as to the degree of corre-
lation between R. & D. contract administra-
tion and patent acquisition. 
Mr. Chairman, I have recited these figures 
In considerable detail because they are rele-
vant to the question of who would receive the 
benefits of a policy of granting exclusive 
commercial rights to contractors. At a mini-
mum Federal R. & D. policy, in the adminis-
tration of contracts, as well as in the alloca-
tion of patent rights, should attempt to 
counteract trends toward monopoly and con-
centration, rather than reinforce them as 
these policies appear to have been doing. 
POSITION OF SMALL BUSINESSES SHOULD BE 
PROTECTED 
With the formulation of a general patent 
bill, this committee has a golden opportunity 
to do something about it in a practical way. 
Yet, what do we find? 
As you know, S. 1809 has no such small 
business provision. The President's Science 
Adviser admits at page 26 of the transcript 
that patent questions are "especially impor-
tant" to small businesses. He admits at page 
27 that the patent right problems of sub-
contractors are unresolved. Mr. Chairman, 
in the name of the 90 percent of American 
firms which are small business, and the 
300,000 manufacturers which are small busi-
ness, we ought to give small business an even 
break in any patent bill. 
I am not asking for preferential treatment 
for small business. But when, year after 
year, the 2 or 3 dozen largest companies in 
the country receive one-half or two-thirds of 
the research money, and take out a half or 
two-thirds of the patents, there is little ques-
tion that this policy is preferential to big 
business. 
In the name of all we value?independence 
of business enterprise, of finances, of mind, 
and of spirit?the Congress ought to take 
the time and trouble to provide equitably for 
small business in any patent legislation. 
'S. 1809, which is the principal bill before 
this subcommittee, is based very heavily upon 
the language and philosophy of the Patent
Advisory Panel Progress Report of June 1984. 
On page 3 of this report, we find the es-
sence of this philosophy. You will recall the 
following language: 
"Where _a Government contractor is ex-
pected to build upon existing knowledge in a 
field of technology directly related to an area 
in which the contractor has an established 
technical competence and a non-govern-
mental commercial position, the Policy State-
ment stipulates that the principal or exclu-
sive rights to resulting inventions should 
normally remain in the contractor * * * this 
situation is perhaps best illustrated by the 
typical Department of Defense contract 
which is intended to build upon a contrac-
tor's established technical competence. 
The statistical material above indicates 
what has been happening to the structure of 
our economy under a Government patent 
policy dominantly influenced by the Depart-
ment of Defense. These trends threaten fur-
ther concentration in the economy if this 
philosophy is projected into the future. 
This would mean disadvantage for not 
only small business and medium-sized busi-
ness, but all business in this country except 
the favored few corporate giants. 
Enactment of such a policy by the Con-
gress at this time of rapid technological 
change and scientific discovery would cast a 
pall on our system of free enterprise for gen-
erations to come. 
It would assure that the top companies get 
bigger and more powerful, while smaller rivals 
would be under increasing pressure to merge, 
sell, or be driven out of business. It also 
means that many men of initiative would be 
denied the rights of going into business, or 
seeing their own businesses grow and flourish. 
The philosophy of this proposal thus strikes 
at the heart of our free enterprise system. 
Accordingly, Air. Chairman, I recommend 
that there be a mechanism by which small 
businesses can gain access to public research 
and development patents done by the giant 
corporations with public funds. Retention 
of title and a flexible system of licensing ac-
cording to the equities involved seems to me 
an avenue that should be explored. 
In S. 2160, a copy of which is attached as 
appendix VI, one system of this kind is avail-
able for the subcommittee's inspection. 
DOES S. 1809 PROTECT THE POSITION OF THE 
TAXPAYER? 
Now, at last, we come down to the individ-
ual taxpayer. How can we demonstrate how 
his monetary interests are affected? 
In the course of the "great debate," the 
Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Lowe] has 
raised the case of a test developed to detect 
PKU, a cause of infant mental retardation. 
While title was in the Government, commer-
cial manufacturers were producing this test 
for 11/2 to 2 cents per baby, and making 
a profit. When a private firm claimed a 
patent on this teat, it was priced at 52 cents 
per baby. 
On August 12, 1965, two Senators intro-
duced a bill (S. 2402) that would appropri-
ate "such sums as may be necessary" to buy 
a test for every newborn baby in the coun-
try. A little arithmetic demonstrates that

_11.e language of the policy declaration as 
you are aware is taken from the October 10, 
1913, memorandum. In my judgment, it is 
coasistent with settled law and sound pub-
lic-policy. A summary of the applicable law 
Is attached as appendix V. "The absence of 
suili a declaration or the adoption by ex-
prission or implication of a contrary policy, 
woUld be, I believe, an historic failure by 
the Congress. 
EIOCEDERAL SECTIONS ARE AS IMPORTANT AS 
ROLICE 
Several of these provisions, pertain to mat-
te's of procedure and standards. These are 
the vehicles by which any policy would be 
carried into effect, and are fully as important 
as the policy sections. 
8. 789 is a fine example for a procedural 
tr tp. As stated by the Department of HEW, 
"the entire thrust of the bill is thus to 
los-
pe de the Governments taking and retaining 
of olvnership in inventions derived from fed-
er illy financed research, by making this a 
losg aruous and exceedingly difficulty and 
in many cases impossible task." As Dr. Horn-
ing stated: "In short, I think it leaves too 
few rights to the Government." 4 
AS to an appropriate standard for waiver, 
I would recommend the one put forward by 
e 1947 Justice Department report, that 
there might be waiver under "emergency con-
ditions" where the head of the agency certi-
flid this was PO. I believe that this standard 
would cover the equities to all contractors 
ac equately, but I would be willing to change 
mr view in the face of enough concrete 
existence that it would not. 
Where are several standards set forth in S. 
1109, under which contractors would be able 
te acquire exclusive rights. The principal 
01Le of these is "exceptional circumstances." 
The use of this phrase in connection with 
p,tent administration by a Federal agency 
,been speciAcally considered by Mem-
bi CI this body, the Senator from Connecti-
ell-, Senator 111EICOFF, when he was Secre-
tsry of Health. Education, and Welfare. He 
wfrri-ed Of the dangerous ambiguities in the 
u:* of this standard in the following terms: 
"'The phrase in 'exceptional circumstances' 
is relatively vague and indefinite and in the 
al feente Of any indicated criteria in the policy 
itself would appear to leave considerable tat-
tille to each agency head to determine what 
cc hatitutes such circumstances. While this 
daba have the advantage of flexibility, it does 
Neve the disadvantages of exposing agency 
lalistis to the pressures of those contractors 
WI() Would urge that each circumstance of 
luordship, however slight, represents an excep-
tional circumstances calling for more gen-
es fists allobation of invention rights." 
The phrase "special circumstances" in sec-
ti m 4(c) of the bill is open to the same 
criticism which I consider to be wholly 
pi truatIve. 
As a matter of fact, the report of the Patent 
A ivisory Panel upon which LI. 1809 and S. 
711) are based, admits, and I quote: 
"The working experience of the subcom-
mittee has revealed that various agencies 
h nit placed different interpretations on car-
te In key phrases found throughout the policy 
statement. It is believed that unless addi-
tional guidance is given, this problem of 
p-tper interpretation would only become 
cloaggerated if left to the unguided judg-
ment of the hundreds of contracting officers 
tilroughout the Government. The follow-
ir g are examples: "0 * * 3. The phrase 'ex-
ec ptlonal circumstances.'" 
Mr. Chairman, / believe this confession is 
tlie best evidence the subcommittee can have 
tc;e:stablfsh two propositions: 
1. That the disposition of these billions 
1 'Transcript, p. 37. 
of dollars; worth of patent properties should 
be placed by Congress, once and for all be-
yond the power and discretion of "hundreds 
Of contracting officers throughout the Gov-
ernment"; and 
2. That the phrase "exceptional circum-
stances' is not an appropriate standard to 
be used In this legislation. 
It is my strong feeling that the power of 
disposition should be given into the ultimate 
responsibility of the head of any agency 
who is responsible to the President of the 
'United States. Every effort should be made 
to preserve the actuality of responsibility 
The the disposition of Federal patent prop-
erty, rather than perpetrating a misleading 
appearance Of responsibility. 
In S. 2i60, I have suggested additional pro-
visions for public licenses and royalties, and 
procedures which would result in written 
findings by the head of an agency as to both 
public versus private interests and value of 
patent interests. These proposals might be 
helpful to the subcommittee in formulating 
the necessary standards, and I commend 
them -to the subcommittee's consideration. 
If I can further assist the subcommittee 
during its deliberations, I would be glad to 
do so.

THE STORY OF THE DO.,01); AN

UPRISING AND THE DIVISION IN 
THE AMERICAN PRESS 
Mr. bODD. Mr. President, 3 months 
after the outbreak of the Dominican up-
rising, a" debate still rages over the wis-
dom of . President Johnson's decision in 
sending in the U.S. Marines. 
This debate has found a reflection in 
the hearings that have recently been 
conducted by the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee. 
In advance of these hearings, the For-
eign Relations Committee published a 
brochure entitled "Background Informa-
tion Relating to the Dominican Repub-
lic," which was described as "a compila-
tion of material deemed useful in any 
discussion dealing with the present situ-
ation in the Dominican Republic." In 
addition to official documents and state-
irie`nta dealing with the Dominican crisis

- ? 
August 23, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL 
and the' background to this crisis, the 
publfoation contained an extensive chro-
nology of events. 
Unfortunately, the chronology quoted 
exclusively from press sources that were 
critical of administration policy?the 
New York Times, the New York Herald 
Tribune, the Washington Post, Le Monde 
of Paris, the London Observer, the Lon-
don Times, the oLndon Economist. All 
told, there were over 100 quotas from 
these sources. The chronology com-
pletely ignored the hundreds of newspa-
per articles by veteran correspondents 
by columnists of national reputation 
which, in general, substantiated the ad-
ministration's statement that it inter-
vened only because law and order had 
breken down completely and because the 
Communists were on the verge of taking 
over. 
The chronological summary also ig-
nored the statements issued by the AFL-
CIO and by Conatrol, the major Domini-
can labor federation, as well as by the 
Triter-American Regional Organization 
of Workers. 
Even more serious is that fact that, 
in the documentation which it repro-
duced, the committee's compilation of 
"Background Information Relating to 
the Dominican Republic" completely ig-
nored the Minutes of the 4th plenary 
session of the 10th meeting of consulta-
tion of the OAS, at which the Special 
Committee on the Dominican Crisis sub-
mitted its report. 
"This was a document of the greatest 
importance, because it makes it abun-
dantly clear, in the words of the five 
Latin American diplomats who made up 
the Special Committee, that they shared 
the administration's evaluation of the 
degree of Communist control in the rebel 
movement, arid that, in general, they 
felt that the administration had taken 
the only poSsible course of action. 
Since this publication was put out in' 
the first instance for the information of 
Congress, Vconsider it most unfortunate 
that the referencesln the chronological 
surarnary of events should have been so 
.completely one-sided. 
In a sense, however, this one-sidedness 
Is simply inother manifestation of the 
Widespread impression, especially in the 
Eastern pa,rt of our country, that the 
American press corps in Santo Domingo 
was almost unanimously critical of Pres-
ident Johnson's decision and skeptical 
of the reports put out by the American 
Embassy in Santo Domingo and by the 
Department' of State. 
This impression stemmed more than 
anything else from the bitterly critical 
attitude of the correspondents assigned 
to cover the Dominican uprising by the 
three major metropolitan newspapers of 
the Eastern area--the New York Times, 
the New York Herald Tribune, and the 
Washington Post. 
AmbriVbtr European allies the impres-
sion was almost unanimous that the ad-
ministration had been completely repudi-
ated by our own press corps in the Do-
minican Republic?and this for the 
simple reason that the Times and Trib-
Mat m 7,3ost are commonly regarded as 
the most authoritative newspapers in our 
country and are more frequently read 
No. 155?'7 
RECORD ? SENATE 20505 
and more frequently quoted by Euro-
peans than the rest of the American 
press put together. 
The purpose of my remarks today is 
not to denigrate the Times and Tribune 
and Post. If believe that these great 
newspapers richly merit the interna-
tional recognition which they today 
enjoy. Not only are they the first three 
newspapers I read every day, but I 
honestly believe that no Member of Con-
gress or community leader can pretend to 
be adequately informed about events in 
our country and around the world unless 
he includes the Times and Tribune and 
Post in his daily reading material. 
However, the Times and Tribune and 
Post, are not by themselves the press of 
America. Nor, despite the great reputa-
tions they enjoy, are their correspond-
ents any more experienced, any more 
competent, any more deserving of credi-
bility, than are the correspondents of 
our wire services and our news maga-
zines and of the many Other great Amer-
ican newspapers, large and small. 
In a complex situation like the Do-
minican Republic revolt, it was easy 
enough for the man who reads only one 
newspaper to have a firm opinion be-
cause the one-newspaper reader, by and 
large, is disposed to accept the informa-
tion printed in his daily paper as some-
thing akin to gospel. 
If a reader was somewhat more as-
siduous and included the Times and 
Tribune and Post in his daily newspaper 
fare, it was also easy to have a firm 
opinion on events in the Dominican Re-
public, because, except for minor points 
of difference, the accounts appearing in 
the Times and Tribune and Post agreed 
with each other and supported each 
other. 
But those who try to follow the 
world's events by reading, as broadly as 
possible in the national press and in their 
news magazines would have found it very 
difficult, indeed, to determine what was 
really going on in the Dominican Re-
public, because the version of events put 
out by the correspondents of the Times 
and Tribune and Post was flatly contra-
dicted by the accounts cabled by an im-
portant and distinguished group of cor-
respondents writing for other media, and 
by authoritative Dominican and Latin 
American sources?as well as by the 
State Department and the administra-
tion. 
The quality of this second group of 
correspondents may be gaged from the 
fact that it included two former Pulitzer 
Prize winners?Marguerite Higgins and 
Hal Hendrix?as well as the winners of 
other journalistic awards, and that sev-
eral members of this group had 10 to 
20 years' experience in Latin American 
affairs. 
Among this group were: Paul Bethel, 
Mutual Network; Jules DuBois, Chicago 
Tribune Syndicate; Howard Handelman, 
U.S. News & World Report; Daniel 
James, Newhouse Papers; Jeremiah 
O'Leary, Washington Star; Virginia 
Prewett, syndicated columnist, editor, 
Latin American Times; John T. Skelly, 
Latin American Times; the Latin Amer-
ican desk at Time magazine; Eric Sev-
areid, syndicated columnist; Rowland 
Arts...wets ,esel ca.. le D.. I,..., C.I% 
Evans and Robert Novak, syndicated 
columnists; and Dickey Chapelle, the 
National Observer. 
While some of these correspondents 
and observers were more sympathetic to 
the junta, some less sympathetic, and 
while there were other differences be-
tween them, they were all essentially 
agreed on one basic fact: That the Com-
munists had seized complete control of 
the revolt at the point where President 
Johnson decided to intervene, and that, 
had the President delayed or attempted 
to handle the situation otherwise, the re-
sult would have been another Castro re-
gime in the Americas. 
In the remarks that follow, I intend to 
say a few words by way of establishing 
the credentials of the more prominent of 
these correspondents, and quote briefly 
from their writing on the Dominican Re-
public crisis. 
In doing so I shall quote first from the 
writings of the two Pulitzer Prize win-
ners, Miss Marguerite Higgins, and Mr. 
Hal Hendrix. 
MISS MARGETERITE HIGGINS 
Miss Higgins, now a correspondent for 
Newsday Syndicate, served as a Herald 
Tribune foreign correspondent for more 
than 20 years. She covered World War 
II, the Korean war, and the war in Viet-
nam, and she served as Herald Tribune 
bureau chief in Tokyo, Berlin, and Mos-
cow. 
Among other things, Miss Higgins 
wrote that: 
The Bosch-Caamano argument (which be-
littled the Communist role) is in total con-
trast in both its parts to the portrait brought 
back by the OAS Special Committee to Santo 
Domingo. 
According to Ambassador Ilmar Penne Ma-
rinho, of Brazil, "The whole Committee (the 
OAS Special Committee) agreed that the Ca-
amano movement could be rapidly converted 
to a Communist insurrection that was sus-
ceptible of gaining the support of the Marx-
ist-Lenin powers." 
As to conditions in Santo Domingo in May, 
"It was a no man's land," said the Brazilian 
Ambassador. "There had been a complete 
collapse of public authority. The Dominican 
Republic had disappeared as a legal and polit-
ical entity?arms had been given to a disor-
iented nation of fanatics and adolescents who 
were in a frenzied state egged on by subver-
sive broadcasts?anarchy reigned?any orga-
nized group that made a landing in the Do-
minican Republic could have dominated the 
situation." 
Miss Higgins quoted the Ambassador 
of Colombia as stating at the OAS special 
committee: 
What were we to do when blood was run-
ning in the streets?what happens when a 
state in this condition is so close to Cuba? 
Are we to sit silently on balconies and watch 
the end of the tragedy as if we were watch-
ing some sort of bullfight? ? 
Miss Higgins said: 
It is important that these judgments on 
Communist penetration and chaos were 
made by Latins, because Latins are tradition-
ally the most apprehensive about Yankee 
intervention. 
HAL HENDRIX 
Mr. Hendrix, of the Miami News, won 
the Pulitizer Prize for his coverage of the 
Cuban missile crisis. He serves as Latin 
American editor of the Miami News as 
well as correspondent for Scripps-
qnrvvirilia rin orloc7onnAAconnncnniinnrvx

olArEkKele This is what Mr. Hendrix 
_OU APR. gantp Domingo: 
The bonainunista and pro-Castro June 14 
moveznent leaders began to crawl out from 
the woodwork and by Sunday night, April 
, they had the rebellion going their way. 
Maar leeid',s Sunday overthrow the real 
Steam:We for power began. 
By Tuesday it was over. The extremists 
had gained control behind the scenes, using 
COL Xrarieisco Caamano Deno as rebel chief-
tain Anci new ?cover. Caamano was installed 
as ?conOittitionalist President." 
The Communist design was to create chaos 
?and anarchy. Now using Caamano's "con-
lititiationallet" movement as a shield, they 
-04 ineered distribution of weapons to thou-
gabds of civilians?probably as many as 
16,000 were armed in I day. 
Communist and June 14 movement leaders 
here continue to remain out of the lime-
light. ieet , no one, including the special 
tia6 peace-seeking mission sent here to help 
end the war, doubts that they still are active 
inside the rebel-held section of the capital. 
In addition to these two Pulitzer Prize 
*timers, the groups of correspondents 
'whose dispatches from Santo Domingo 
supported the administration's versions 
of events included many other seasoned 
correspondents with long experience in 
the area.. 
AuL BKTMEL 
Mr. Bethel is a veteran of 20 years in 
the American Foreign Service including 
a period as press attach?n the U.S. 
Embassy in Havana at the time of the 
Castro takeover. He is the author of two 
books on Latin America, and he covered 
the Dominican situation for the Mutual 
Broadcasting network and for the United 
the United Features Syndicate. 
In a serialized account syndicated by 
United Features, Mr. Bethel wrote: 
Ambassador W. Tapley Bennett told a 
group of us on April 29 that the PRD 
(Bosch's party) and the Communists had 
been collaborating. He said: "The Com-
Munists worked with Bosch's PRD for 
months and were prepared well in advance 
for Reid's (civilian junta chief) overthrow." 
That was the significance of the March 
18 Communist manifesto. It was the blue-
print for the events that took place on 
April 24 and thereafter. 
I also learned from an unimpeachable 
source that Bosch met with two members of 
the Castro-Communist "14th of June Move-
ment" in San Juan in early March. The 
two?Victorians Felix and Rafael Taveras?
got Bosch's agreement to cooperate. Taveras 
Is a member of the central committee of the 
party. 
? I wish to add here that Mr. Bethel's 
account has since been confirmed by the 
State Department. 
XULES DU BOIS 
Mr. Du Bois, correspondent for the 
Chicago Tribune Syndicate, has been a 
recognized authority and prize-winning 
correspondent on Latin America for over 
two decades, and is one of the best known 
officers of the Inter-American Press 
Association. 
Writing from Santo Domingo, Mr, Du-
Bois reported that rebel leader Col. 
Francisco Caamano was taking orders 
from the Communists from the day of 
the outbreak of violence. In an inter-
view with the former commander. of 
OZaraa Fortress, he quoted the com-
mander as saying:

The manifesto incited the people to vio-

the fields, for the return of Juan Bosch as 
the head of the constitutional government.

- HOWARD HANDELMAN 
Mr ,Handelman of U.S. News & World 
Repot, has covered Cuban and Carrib-
bean news since 1960. After weeks of 
careful investigation under the direction 
of MV, Handelman, U.S. News & World 
Repo' t had this to say about the role of 
Cuba in the Dominican revolt. 
Cuba, it is clear, was a major staging area 
for supplying men and weapons for the 
uprisir g. 
The article said that Cuba assembled 
a qua:ter of a ton of small arms and 
about 300,000 rounds of ammunition to 
suppoi t Cuban-trained Dominican guer-
rillas. Those guerrillas reinfiltrated 
their homeland in late 1964 as Dominican 
agents for Cuba's General Directorate of 
Intellieence. Thus, they were poised to 
strike For power when the revolt broke 
out in late April. 
DANIEL JAMES 
Dani .11 James, who covered the Domin-
ican crisis for the Newhouse papers, has 
written five books on Latin America over 
the past 12 years, and has also contrib-
uted articles dealing with Latin-Ameri-
can pro elems to Reader's Digest, Fortune, 
Salim& y Evening Past, and many other 
periodicale. He wrote many articles di-
rected against the Trujillo regime, in-
cluding an investigation of the assassi-
nation and kidnaping of the anti-Trujillo 
scholar, Dr. Jesus De Galindez. 
Writing from Santo Domingo on June 
1, Mr. James said: 
A majority of the persons this reporter has 
talked with agree that the Communists had 
begun surfacing within 24 hours after the 
revolt had started on April 24, and that with-
in 72 hours were acquiring control over it. 
August 23, 1965 
.As of mid-May, Caamano was still in con-
tact with the Dominican Reds, according to 
reliable informants. Hard evidence that 
prominent Communists continued to play a 
leading tole in the rebel military command 
up until' the third week in May, is the fact 
that four of them were killed at that time in 
the heavy fighting around the national pal-
ace. 
How many Communists there were, or still 
are in Caarnano ranks, is relatively unimpor-
tant. A "numbers game," unfortunately 
started by the State Department when it is-
sued a hastily prepared list of 58 Reds con-
spicuous in the revolt's early days, is being 
played by ignorant or dubious writers who 
are thus obLcuring the real significance of 
the Communist role. 
First of all, many of the leading Commu-
nist participants have been trained in Cuba 
and/or Russia. The State Department named 
18. Sources here put the total at nearer 50. 
That is more than enough to seize the leader-
ship of a surging mass with little or no mili-
tary experience and no knowledge whatso-
ever of the strategy and tactics of revolu-
tiOIIS. 
JEREDHAH A. O'LEARY 
Mr. O'Leary, of the Washington Star,' 
won the first prize of the Washington 
News Guild for his report on President 
Kennedy's assassination. After his re-
turn from Santo Domingo, Mr. O'Leary 
wrote the following: 
There are no Communists in the rebel high 
command, ()facials believe, nor is Caarnano 
himself a Communist. 
As one official put it: "What is the use of 
being minister of interior or foreign minister 
in a government that only controls a few 
acres of a poorer section of Santo Domingo? 
Those with the real power are the Com-
munists who control the armed civilians, the 
roughly disciplined youths who owe alle-
giance to the three main Communist groups. 
"These groups are the PSPD, or othrodox 
Moscow line party; the. MPD, which adheres 
to the philosophy of Peiping, and the Ha--
vana-line APCJ or June 14 movement."

Miss Prewett wrote:

DICKE T CHAPELLE 
Miss Dickey Chapelle has for many 
years now :been a frequent contributor 
to Reader's Digest, the National Geo-

American periodicals. She has covered 
virtually every important conflict since 
World War TIT-the Korean war, the land-

garian Resolution? the Castro takeover in 
Cuba; the war in Lags, the Chinese inva-

recently the Dominican uprising, which 
she covered for the weekly newspaper, the 
National Olperver. _

has been exposed to fire countless times. 
In One of her articles, Miss Chapelle 
told a very revealing story. She had

RaMon Pichirilo Mejia, a man whom she 
had met in Cuba during the Castro take-

Ch41511e's ac.,90.Unt other encounter with 
the coraraanda.hte: 
4 For the. Ansi time in the brightening morn-
ing light, I looked squarely into his face. 
Was it truly familiar, or was my judgment 
suspect after the night's misadvantures? 
Standing amid the nibbled slum, I drew a 
deep breath. 
"Were you in Cuba then? I mean, were 
you Castro's boatman?" 
The eyes narrowed and the answer came 
by reflex?proudly. 
"I was the commander of Fidel's Gramm 
and later, in the mountains, where you were, 
Americana, a leader of a battalion for him." 
"Are you Pichirllo?" 
"My name is Ramon Pichirilo 
"Did you remember who I was?" 
He looked pitingly at me, "Si si, Ameri-
cana," he grinned and spoke slowly as if the 
words tasted good. 
"Are you then well after what happened to 
you in Cuba?" 
"Well enough to have led people against 
their oppressors in Bolivia and Colombia and 
Venezuela and Costa Rica and Guatemala 
since last / saw you," he nodded. 
He posed. I shot fast. He raised his hand. 
"Now do not say I am a Communist, Ameri-
cana. If I were truly a Red, I could have a 
good life staying in Cuba. But you see I am 
here instead, where I was born." 
Because I have endeavored to limit 
myself to the best known correspondents 
I have quoted from only a partial list of 
those who reported in a manner which, 
despite minor differences, generally au-
thenticated and endorsed the basic deci-
sion to intervene in the Dominican crisis. 
THE ATTITUDE OF THE A5'L-C/0 AND OF LATIN 
AMERICAN 'UNIONISTS 
Finally, I wish to point out that the 
statements of the AFL-CIO Executive 
Council which was missing from the 
chronological summary, welcomed "the 
prompt and energetic measures taken by 
the President to prevent the Communist 
attempt to seize control of the Dominican 
democratic revolutionary movement and 
to foist a Castro-type dictatorship on 
Santo Domingo." 
The Inter-American Regional Orga-
nization of Workers?ORIT?an orga-
nization which embraces most of the im-
portant labor unions in the hemisphere, 
adopted a resolution, couched in similar 
terms, supporting American interven-
tion: 
We must point out that the unilateral 
action of the U.S. Armed Forces in this grave 
Dominican conflict has, on the one hand, 
served to save thousands of lives and, at the 
same time, under the guidance of the OAS 
Commission, has been able to contribute 
toward making the horrors of civil war less 
cruel. 
THE REPORT OF THE OAS SPECIAL COMMITTEE 
I have already referred to the report 
of the OAS Special Committee. The 
minutes of the meeting at which the Spe-
cial Committee reported to the fourth 
plenary session is a document of such 
Importance that I hope all of my col-
leagues will find the time to read the 
complete text. Let me quote two state-
ments that were made at this meeting. 
Ambassador Carrizosa, the special 
delegate of Colombia, told the meeting: 
With regard to the sector led by Colonel 
Francisco Caarnano, many diplomats ac-
credited in the Dominican Republic, and I 
can include my country's diplomatic repre-
sentative, feel that, if not Colonel Francisco 
Caamano, whom I do not know to be per-
sonally a Communist, there are indeed 
numerous persons on his side that, if they 
4ire not members of the Communist Party, 
are actively in favor of Fidel Castro's system 
of government or political purposes. There 
Is such a tendency in the opinion of many 
diplomats I spoke to, and I do not mention 
Other countries in order not to commit coun-
tries represented here. They are firmly con-
vinced that on that side there are many per-
sons, I do not say members registered in an 
officially organized Communist party, but 
persons who do have leanings toward a well-
known trend which is prevalent in Cuba. 
Mr. Carrizosa's remarks were corrob-
orated by the other members of the 
Special Committee. Summarizing the 
views of the Committee, Ambassador 
Yodice of Paraguay made this state-
ment: 
The Government of Paraguay, as I stated 
clearly when approval was given to the es-
tablishment of the collective inter-American 
force, believed from the beginning that con-
tinental security was at stake. The replies 
by the Ambassadors composing the Commit-
tee reporting today on certain questions re-
garding these delicate aspects of the Domin-
ican situation have been categorical. My 
government was right. Continental security 
is threatened. The danger existed, and still 
exists, that chaos and anarchy will permit 
international communism to transform the 
Dominican Republic into another Cuba. 
With his customary clarity, courage, and 
energy, the Ambassador of Colombia, Mr. 
Alfredo Vazquez Carrizosa, has categorically 
mentioned the highly political nature of the 
problem we are facing. In reply to a ques-
tion of the Ambassador of Uruguay, he has 
rightly said that the peace of America is 
threatened, that the security of the hemi-
sphere is threatened, and that there is a pos-
sibility that another Cuba, another Com-
munist government in the hemisphere will 
arise out of the chaos and anarchy in the 
Dominican Republic. 
OTHER LATIN AMERICAN VIEWS 
There were also many other Latin 
Americans of stature who made com-
ments supporting the action taken by the 
administration. For example, the Balti-
more Sun on June 9 carried a statement 
by Dr. Rupo Lopez-Fresquat, first sec-
retary of the treasury in the revolution-
ary regime set up by Castro after he came 
to power. Let me quote from the inter-
view with Dr. Lopez: 
The Organization of American States has 
stated that communism is incompatible with 
the democratic principles of Latin America. 
The United States has a right to intervene 
against the Communists?the enemy. 
Dr. Lopez believes that Communists were 
Involved in the Dominican disorders. 
"They are everywhere," he says, "and they 
are trained to infiltrate popular movements." 
"Their number is immaterial," he says, 
"for 53 trained Communists working with 
an armed civilian militia would be plenty 
under the chaotic conditions that prevailed 
early in the revolt." 
In the light of all these statements, 
Mr. President, I think it is clear beyond 
challenge that the American press was 
not unanimously critical of the admin-
istration's policy in the Dominican Re-
public, that the President's decision was, 
in fact, supported by a very substantial 
section of the press corps as well as by 
Independent authorities, both Latin and 
American. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert into the RECORD some of 
the writings of the American correspon-
dents to whom I have referred, in the 
order in which I have mentioned them. 
I think it is also clear beyond challenge 
that the administration's decision en-
joyed the endorsement of responsible

Latin American diplomats who were on 
tie spot or who made an on-the-spot in-
VOttigation, as well as of other Latin 
Americans of liberal reputation whose 
personal background qualified them to 
speak with some authority on the prob-
lem of Communist subversion. 
In this connection I ask unanimous 
consent to insert into the RECORD the 
minutes of the 4th plenary session of the 
10th meeting of consultation of the OAS; 
the interview with Dr. Rap? Lopez-
Presquat in the Baltimore Sun for 
September 9; and the full text of the 
statement of the Inter-American Re-
gional Organization of Workers. 
Mr. President, one of the great advan-
tages of a free press is that in any con-
troversial situation it will generally come 
up With reports, scattered through vari-
ous newspapers, that reflect all sides of 
the controversy. 
Iii attempting to make up our minds 
in any such situation, Members of Con-
gress are confronted with the problem of 
Weighing conflicting press accounts 
against each other, of assessing each 
account in the light of their own expe-
rience or knowledge, of supplementing 
these reports wherever possible from 
their own sources of information, and of 
then making their own decision. 
The fact that a majority of the Amer-
ican correspondents in any given situa-
tion sponsor a version of events which is 
contradicted by a minority, is no clue at 
all to the real truth?because in more 
than one situation it has been demon-
strated that the majority of the press 
corps can be wrong and the minority can 
be right in their evaluation. 
In the case of the Dominican situation, 
It was unquestionably true that an 
'arithmetical majority of the 160-man 
American press corps were critical of 
administration policy. But, by the na-
ture of things, I think there would be no 
difficulty in establishing that most of

This was brought out in question and 
answer sessions of the five Latin American 
Ambassadors held privately with their col-
leagues of the OAS after their return to 
Washington last weekend. . Since the five 
Latin American Ambassadors went to Santo 
Domingo with a skeptical, show-me attitude, 
their vivid eyewitness account of the Domin-
ican tragedy has special significance. For 
one thing, what one Latin American tells 
another is likely to have more impact on the 
OAS as a whole than any number of State 
Department releases. 
In reply to a question from the Mexican 
Ambassador on the Communist role in the 
fighting, Argentine Ambassador Ricardo M. 
Colombo gave this illuminating account of 
conversations at headquarters of the rebels 
who started the revolution in the name of the 
return to constitutionality and support for 
former President Juan Bosch. 
"We spoke to a variety of persons in the 
Caamano group," said the Argentine Ambas-
sador. "They recognized the possibility of 
control being taken over by the Commu-
nists * * ? this was one of their problems.

Nobody in the OAS Missionto Santo Do-

deep concern that his flirtations with the

rejected all compromise by way of a meeting

Such a compromise had been urged all 
the previous day by anxious delegates of the

preventing more bloodshed. 
"How can one cOfnpromise with mur-

to the OAS which had thought for a few

Caaniano did agree for a few moments but 
then his more militant advisers vetoed the 
idea. But in the Dominican Republic 
nothing is ever final. And the OAS is still 
attempting to start a palaver between the 
0pposing side whose Stand-Off hostility has 
left the city divided and paralyzed with the 
U.S. forces in between. 
? At his Rebel headquarters filled with rifle-
toting civilians, Caamano was in a cocky 
mood. Re was so cocky that he even ruled 
out any official place in his future govern-
ment for Juan Bosch, the former Dominican 
President in., exile, in whose name the re-
bellion was started. The 1.7.S. claims that the 
Caamano rebellion hoe become heavily Com-
munist infiltrated but the rebels pooh-pooh 
the charge.

Propaganda over the silenced rebel radio 
has, called everyone from President Johnson 
to Ambassador Bennet liars and -has alleged 
that the United States was backing General 
Intbert's junta regime. 
The, claim to farae of this newest junta 
leader is that he helped to assassinate Dic-
tator Trujillo. General Imbert (the title is 
honorary) is at least a dedicated anti-Com-
munist and this 15 one comfort to the United 
States which feels awkward about having to 
depend on a one-time assassin as IIS best 
hope for leading this country back out of 
this wild anarchy. 
In urging a bridge between Caamano and 
Imbert, the United States lopes that some-
how in the, process the rebel colonel can be 
separated from his more militant advisers. 
This remains a very iffy question. On our 
interview today it seemed to me that Colonel 
Caamano was as interested in impressing his 
aid, the militant Rector Aristy, with his 
defiance as he was in conveying this to me. 
Aristy who has the title of minister of, gov-
ernment was the rebel leader who allegedly 
prevented Oaarnano from even meeting with 
the rival General Imbert. It is the con-
clusion therefore of most Latin American 
diplomats that Caamano is the prisoner of 
the militants around him. 
"There is no question of meeting with 
General Imbert," said Colonel Caamano. 
"He is an imposter." Asked if he was ask-
ing the junta government to surrender to 
his rebel authority, Colonel Caamano claimed 
that "General Imbert represents nobody." 
"If the United States would leave," Caa-
mano said, "the troops now with Imbert 
would flood over to our side. We would not 
avenge ourselves on those who have been 
loyal to the junta. We would only try the 
criminals such as General Wessin." 
General Wessin, one of the few incorrupt-
ible generals of the Dominican Republic is 
credited with having intervened against the 
Caliman9 led rebellion When it became ev-
ident that Communist elements were close 
to taking over control. The United States 
intervened on April 28 when law and order 
disintegrated. Its purposes at the time were 
to save lives and prevent another Cuba. Its 
purpose now is to prevent a new blood bath 
and find some kind of formula that will re-
store order, and get this country on the path 
to some kind of democratic solution. The 
cease fire has been a mockery from the start. 
This correspondent has been caught in three 
successive fire fights in 3 successive days, and 
the side that started shooting was the 
rebels?not our Marines or our 82d Airborne. 
Today, the junta planes attacked and si-
lenced (at least temporarily) 'the Santo Do-
mingo rebel radio station and thus ruptured 
the cease fire in their turn. 
The fact that American Ambassador Ben-
nett hit the deck and crawled under his desk 
during the junta air attack would appear 
to bear out the claim that it came as some-
thing of a surprise to the Embassy. It was 
a surprise to our troops who shot at the 
attacking planes?and missed. 
The mystery of whether Colonel Caamano 
is a free agent was not pierced by his answer 
to my questions as to why his wife and two 
children had taken asylum in the Argentine 
Embassy in the zone controlled by the rival 
junta. 
"Our house burned down," said Colonel 
Caamano. 
"But that was 3 weeks ago," I interposed. 
"Why doesn't she join you now?" 
"There may be bloodshed," said Colonel 
Caamano. "I do not want to think about 
my wife and children. I want to think about 
my country." 
In this Volatile land, rebel intransigeance 
may well fade in the wake of the _display of 
determination in :the, RUM of aerial strafing 
of the rebel, racho which had had a great role 
in inciting citizens to shoot at American 
troops and otherwise harass us. But at the 
incrnent the feeling is that things are going 
to get Worse before they get better.

MARGUERITE HIGGINS "ON THE SPOT" 
(By Marguerite Higgins) 
SANT? Dommrco.?The authoritative rattle 
of automatic weapons was mixed with the 
occasional ping of a light rifle and the rebels 
kept firing on the U.S. marine company for 
a subborn hour and 20 minutes. The firing 
came from a block away and the rebel snipers 
stretched about two-thirds of a mile along 
the demarcation line between their zone and 
the international area held by U.S. forces. 
The marines kept their heads down?behind 
sandbags, stone walls, fences, cam?and re-
turned fire on the infrequent occasions when 
they could get a decent look at their rag-
tag enemies. Finally, the firing stopped, as 
Inexplicably as it had started and the long 
lines of cars started moving through the 
marine checkpoints at the intersections, ap-
parently unconcerned that the road they 
were traveling had been a no man's land a 
few minutes before. 
And that's how it is with the crazy cease 
fire that is supposed to be prevailing around 
here. 
But there is one good thing about it ac-
cording to U.S. Marine Capt. Charles Barstow, 
of Dunellen, N.J. 
"Those rebels fire high and wild," said 
Captain Barstow, grinning reassuringly as 
another round pinged in somewhere down 
the block. 
And in this case, he was right. For 
Barstow's marine company has not sustained 
any injuries despite what the marine cap-
tain?a practitioner of the art of understate-
ment?describes laconically as rather inten-
sive fire. 
So the fracas would not even have been 
reported on the incident sheet and his ma-
? cdinpany's luck?and remarkable re-
straint in the face of provocation?would 
have gone unsung if this reporter and Howard 
Handleman of U.S. News & World Report had 
not happened to stumble into the tail end of 
the fire fight while trying to make our way 
to rebel headquarters in the sniper zone. 
Was there any pattern or purpose in these 
rebel sniper attacks? I asked Captain 
Barstow. 
"Militarily there is no sense to it," said the 
young captain. "They never try to rush us. 
They hide up there on the roofs or sometimes 
dart in the middle of an intersection to fire 
and run. What I think they are really doing 
is trying to get some martyrs. And we are 
doing our best not to give them any martyrs. 
We only fire back when a sniper is getting 
awfully close to target and awfully aggres-
sive." 
We were standing in the front yard of a 
home which had a stone wall in front. The 
wall gave good cover against incoming fire 
and so several marines had their pup tents 
in it. A couple more were on the porch of 
the house itself which, was heavily sand-
bagged. 
Catching my glance, the marine said rue-
fully: "Of course we are a nuisance to those 
people. But so help me we try to make it up 
to them by courtesy and gifts of coffee and 
such. It's bothersome to be in a fire fight. 
But it is a whole lot more bothersome to 
have tommygun-toting rebels setting fire to 
your house and looting as was happening 
around here when we came. And these peo-
ple have been absolutely wonderful to us. 
I heard that some of the press say they hate 
us. If so, these are some of the best actors 
I have ever seen." 
Later, over in the rebel zone, we could see 
closeup the scary results of the indiscrimi-
nate distribution of guns after they had been 
looted from police and military armories by 
the rebelling mobs. It seemed for several 
blocks as if no man was without a rine or 
automatic weapons slung over his shoulder. 
Few were in uniform. A great many simply 
had on open white shirts and slacks.

Was it youngsters like this, I wondered, 
Who had been firing on Captain Barstow's 
company? Were they under any orders? 
Could the sniping be turned off? 
Over in front of rebel headquarters we 
found the so-called commander of the rebel 
forces, Col. Monte Arrache. He was in a 
camouflage uniform sitting in a jeep with 
an aide talking to some of the gun-toting 
rebels. 
"Colonel," I asked, "do you have control 
Of the people firing from your zone?" 
"Of course I do," said the rebel colonel. 
"They why don't you turn off the firing?" 
I asked. 
"But it is not the rebels who are firing," 
said the colonel "It is really soldiers who 
represent the junta (the new provisional 
government of General Imbert) who disguise 
themselves as rebels. They sneak into our 
zone and fire at the American troops to try 
and provoke an American attack on our 
headquarters." 
It was all nonsense, of course, but that is 
the way this off-again on-again cease fire is. 
And in this crazy mixed-up situation any-
thing can still happen?including a blood 
bath. 
[Prom Newsday, May 17, 1965] 
MARGUERITE HIGGINS "Ox THE SPOT" 
(By Marguerite Higgins) 
SANTO Dostinsso.?The role being played in 
the Santo Domingo crisis by John Bartlow 
Martin, writer, diplomat, and a darling of 
the liberals, is so extraordinary as to defy 
all the known rules in the practice of foreign 
policy anywhere, anytime?ever. 
In effect, the United States has two Am-
bassadors here. But wait, this is not cause 
for any wringing of hands. For they work 
Well in tandem, have a complete meeting of 
minds on the nightmarish realities of the 
situation, and have no reason to compete for 
the favors of Lyndon Baines Johnson. They 
are already both tops in his favor. 
John Bartlow Martin was Ambassador here 
during the epoch of the former President of 
the Dominican Republic, Juan Bosch. The 
progressive idealism of Bosch was betrayed 
by his poet's dreams and his inability to see 
that the Communists in his government 
were determined. by definition and ideolog-
ical compulsion, to work for his undoing 
in order to advance their own chances of 
seizing power. So Bosch was overthrown by 
anti-Communist generals who were alarmed 
at his permissive attitude to the militant 
leftists. 
Nonetheless, both during his presidency 
and beyond, Martin was close philosophically 
and personally to the democratically-elected 
Bosch and members. of his government. 
So it has been former Ambassador Martin's 
task to seek to persuade the moderate pro-
Bosch elements to turn their backs on the 
Communist militants who sought to take 
over the current rebel revolt and cooperate 
in some sort of government of national union 
that can guide this nation back to constitu-
tionality and whatever measure of democ-
racy is possible in a nation that is largely 
illiterate and still in political swaddling 
clothes. 
Ambassador Martin has been the Embassy's 
principal link with rebel dol. Francisco 
Caarnano, the head of the rump constitu-
tional regime. And contrary' to press re-
ports, these links have been kept very much 
alive?when the militant rebels would con-
descend to cooperate. 
Ambassador W. Tapley Bennett, the Am-
ba,ssador No. 1 so to speak, is in overall com-
mand of the situation and recognizes that 
John Bartlow Martin fills an invaluable gap. 
For the rebels have made Arnbassador Ben-
nett their enemy No. 1. It would be unfit-
ting and demeaning certainly for Ambassa-
dor Bennett to seek to deal with a group 
whose radio (until it was silenced) described 
him as a liar, murderer and such. 
The priority task for Ambassador Bennett 
has been to work with the broadened coali-
tion gcwernment of junta leader Gen. 
Antonio Imbert Barreras to bring about 
whatever concessions possible in the Ameri-
can-inspired attempt to build a bridge be-
tween the junta and the pro-Bosch rump 
regime , if Colonel Caamano. 
The i :ony of the rebel abuse heaped on 
Bennett is that the U.S. Marines would not 
ba in SE Ilt0 Domingo today if it were not for 
the judgments of John Bartlow Martin as 
made w:aen he was whisked down here in the 
early da ye of chaos. 
When L.B.J. telephoned John Bartlow Mar-
tin at Wesleyan College to ask him to go to 
Santo E ?ming?, the former Ambassador told 
the Preildent: "The United States is backing 
the wrong side. We should back the -Bosch 
(constitutionalist) movement." 
Once Sn the scene in Santo Domingo, John 
Bartlow Martin quickly changed his mind. 
Intercepting him for an instant the other 
day as he reported in briefly to the Embassy 
in between his 18 to 20 hours a day of "be 
reason& ale" conference with Dominican poli-
ticians, Ambassador Martin explained: "The 
revolutisn did not start out as Communist 
but quilkly developed in that direction." 
Once it bloodbath begins, all the factions 
guilty ct it are in it together so what used 
to be differences are wiped out. When you 
go to ex Verne% the old niceties of philosophic 
and ide gogical differences disappear. By ex-
tremes, / mean beheading, sending people "to 
the we:I.:" 'killing of children, torture. In this 
bloodlu it, all factions (pro-Castro, pro-Mao, 
pro-Sot lei, and those pro-Bosch who partici-
pated ii the bloodlust) tend to be melted 
togethe7, 
It ws John Bartlow Martin's warnings 
that couvinced President Johnson that there 
Was a :soesible Cuba in the making in the 
Domini-san Republic. If even an ardent lib-
eral hi.i come to this conclusion, L.B.X. 
reasone4, then he could not afford to take 
the pia:Meal chance of inaction, let alone 
permit thousands of lives to be lost as the 
United States stood Idly by. 
The ist4nosphere around here even today is 
a kind of wild west Magnified a thousand 
times a ad with a severe shortage of good guys 
to pit iigainst the bad guys. So there is no 
doubt :1:1 this observer's mind that an orgy 
of killisg was in the cards?and still might 
be. 
The rail, ulcer-ridden Martin, with his 
gaunt , iheeks and chain smoking habits, re-
ports directly to President Johnson on a sit-
uation that despite his gargantuan efforts?
and those of Bennett and others?seems 
strangled by hate and feuds. 
But se is still trying, sometimes in Santo 
Domingo, sometimes in long futile efforts to 
persuac Le exiled Juan Bosch in Puerto Rico, 
to cease giving killers and fanatics political

Asassusarrox DUMP EXPLOSION 
(By Hal Hendrix) 
SAN] 0 DOMINGO, May 12.?A tremendous 
ammo:intim dump explosion here in June 
1964 a as the initial stage of a Communist-
backe military plot to dump the triumvirate 
regims of Donald Reid Cabral, a highly 
placed diplomatic source disclosed here 
today. 
Reconstruction of events leading to last 
month's eruption helps explain President 
Johnson's decision to land U.S. forces here 
quick17 to safeguard Americans and prevent 
a pov tr grab by Communist strategists 
alined with Castro's Cuba. 
Thi is an authoritative account of how 
the et:trent disaster took shape here during 
the pa et year: 
After having a relatively free run of the 
range during the government of leftist Presi-
dent Juan Bosch, toppled by a bloodless mil-
itary coup in September 1963, Communists 
and Castroites here were forced to carry on 
clandestinely. 
Quietly and carefully they sought a ve-
hicle on which they could move in, piggy-
back fashion. When Reid began to crack 
down on corrupt high-ranking military of-
ficers, including a clique known here as the 
San Cristobal group, early last year the ex-
tremists found their vehicle. 
The dissident San Cristobal officers, at this 
stage believed to be unaware ,g their silent 
Red allies, made a deal with representatives 
of Bosch's Dominican Revolutionary Party 
(PRD) on overthrowing the Reid govern-
ment. 
The officers had only in mind establishing 
a military junta, with them In charge. They 
didn't want to bring Bosch back to run the 
show. 
One major stumbling block for the plotters 
was the huge 27th of February arsenal and 
ammunition dump across the ?zeta:a River 
from downtown Santo Domingo. 
With this key installation on the eastern 
side of the river and within control of Brig. 
Gen. Elias Wessin y Wessint headquarters 
at the San Isidro Air Base, the conspirators 
feared they were highly vulnerable. So it 
was decided that the ammunition base had 
to be eliminated and its replacement put on 
the west side of the river. 
On the night of last June 11, a series of 
mysterious blasts destroyed four of live 
ammo dumps at the camp, along with tons 
of military hardware. The blasts, which 
rocked Santo Domingo, killed 14, injured 
about 140 and caused 830 million damage. 
The Reid government announced the ex-
plosions were caused by sabotage. Suspects 
were arrested and questioned, but there was 
never a complete explanation. 
Six weeks later a special Organization of 
American States (OAS) investigative com-
mission reported it had found indications of 
Communist infiltration in the Dominican 
armed forces and that the explosion .was a 
result of this penetration. 
The report and its implied warning went 
generally unheeded here and elsewhere in the 
hemisphere. 
As the military plotters here had hoped, 
the replacement base was constructed on the 
west side of the Ozaana River. It was built 
northwest of downtown Santo Domingo, and 
called the 16th of August camp?an impor-
tant base in events of last month. 
The plotting continued between the dis-
sident officers and PRD representatives here 
and in San Juan, where Bosch is living and 
agitating in exile. 
The PRD knew of the Red infiltration in 
their scheme, but figured it could control the 
Communists when the time came. 
Reid learned of the plot against him early 
in April. The Military conspirators found 
out that he knew of their plans and decided 
to advance their timetable. They still were 
thinking in terms of setting up only a mili-
tary junta to rule the country. 
The plot unfolded April 24. The PRD 
quickly moved to proclaim it a movement to 
restore Bosch to the Presidency. The chief 
military plotsers began to see their plans 
getting out of control. 
The Communists and pro-Castro June 14 
movement leaders began to crawl out from 
the woodwork and by Sunday night, April 
25, they had the rebellion going their way. 
After Reid's Sunday overthrow the real 
scramble for power began. 
By Tuesday it was over. The extremists 
had gained control behind the scenes, using 
Col. Francisco Caamano Deno as rebel chief-
tain and new cover. Caiimano was installed 
as "Constitutionalist President." 
The Communist design was to create chaos 
and anarchy. Now using Caamano's "con-

sought sanctuary in embaseies here.

ing of civilians, under an admitted block-by-

movdMent for what it is now.

, 
erness that the United States had flown 
Guzman secretly to Washington for consul-
tation. 
"What kind of business is this the North 
American government is doing?" asked Im-
bert, sitting with his junta and military 
chiefs. 
"This still is a free and sovereign country, 
so why does a Dominican citizen have to 
be taken to Washington for approval before 
being named President of the Dominican 
Republic?" 
The military also put the U.S. represent-
atives on the spot by declaring: 
"If you want to turn this country over 
to communism you will have to guarantee 
safe evacuation of all the anti-Communist 
Dominican armed forces and their families 
and also all democratic Dominican citizens 
who hold anti-Communist beliefs." 
Commodore Francisco J. Rivera Caminero, 
Armed Forces Secretary, said after the meet-
ing the military establishment solidly sup-
ports the Imbert junta. He said he wasn't 
certain of the names of the American offi-
cials at the conference. 
The Washington task force includes Mc-
George Bundy, Special Assistant to Presi-
dent Johnson on National Security Affairs, 
Under Secretary of State Thomas C. Mann, 
Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus R. Vance, 
and Jack Hood Vaughn, Assistant Secretary 
of State for Inter-American Affairs. Mann 
flew back to Washington yesterday. 
"I don't understand why the Americans 
came to talk with us about this instead of 
discussing it with the President of the Na-
tional Reconstruction Government," Rivera 
Caminero commented. "We do have a Presi-
dent now, you know, General Imbert." 
Imbert and his junta associates said their 
gotfernihent rejects any attempt by the 
United States to pressure acceptance of 
"persons of Communist affiliation or sympa-
thizers." He said he supported the idea of 
a national harmony government composed of 
"all capable and honest Dominicans regard-
less of their political affiliation?except for 
the Communists, of course." 
The military leaders and Imbert also sug-
gested to the American representatives that 
it would be helpful for the Organization of 
American States to maintain a peacekeeping 
force here for at least 2 months after hostili-
ties end and supervise a referendum so Dea-
minicans can decide by ballots whether they 
want to live under the 1963 or 1962 con-
stitution. 
The rebel or constitutionalist forces led 
by Col. Francisco Caamano Deno have been 
clamoring for return to the 1963 constitution, 
prepared by the Bosch government. 
In opposing Guzman as a provisional pres-
ident, Imbert and the military refer to him 
as a puppet of Bosch. "When the National 
Reconstruhion Government was being 
formed," Imbert said, "we called Guzman 
and asked him to be a member. He declined, 
saying he was in ill health and added that 
since he was a close friend of Professor Bosch 
he would have to consult with him." 
Other members of the U.S. proposed. coali-
tion government are reported to be Milton 
Messina, currently an economist for the 
Inter-American Development Bank in Wash-
ington and a 'former ambassador to Canada 
during the Trujillo dictatorship, Hector 
Garcia Godoy, Bosch's foreign minister, Dr.

DOMINICAN MILITARY tEADERS REJECT 
tr.s. PRopo'sm., 
(By Hal Hendrix) 
SANTO DOMINGO, May 19.?Top Dominican 
military leaders supporting the civilian-
military junta governmeht created by the 
United States only 10 days ago have turned 
down fiat a U.S. proposal to replace it with 
another provisional goverhment. 
Tie White House and State Department 
officials sent here Sunday bypassed Gen. 
Antonio Imbert Berrera, the junta president, 
and his four associates to ineet With the mili-
tary leaders. 
Some of these members of the military 
hierarchy were the very same officers who 
20 months ago overthrew the leftist? govern-
ment of President Juan Bosch after conclud-
ing he was "soft" on communism in the 
Dominican Republic and was an incompetent 
adnainistrator?an opinion then sharedy 
Washington. 
Yet yesterday the 'U.S. diplomats asked the 
Dominican Army, Navy and Air Force brass to 
withdraw support from the stanchly anti-
Communist Imbert-led - junta and aline 
themselves with a Washington-suggested 
pro-Bosch provisional coalition government. 
rhe rallitary hierarchy refused to buckle 
under the preseure and countered with a 
proposal that consideration be given to for-
mation of a government of "national har-
mony," composed of all democratic parties 
in the country and including the Imbert 
junta. 
The Dominican officers rejected as totally 
unacceptable the Washington-drafted scheme 
for a government to be headed by Antonio 
Guzman, Who was flovin by the U.S. Air 
Force to Washington for secret conferences 
last Friday and apparently was approved by 
th'Wkilte Hpiise. -

ers, noting that Ouzman was acceptable 
20511 
trooPs are assisting either of the two battling 
forces in the bitter Dominican civil war. 
He said such allegations are "not correct." 
"President Johnson's instructions are for 
the U.S. forces here to observe strict im-
partiality and these instructions are being 
carried out," he said at a news conference 
here. 
In reply to a question about reports that 
troops of the civilian-military junta govern-
ment of national reconstruction are prepar-
ing to strike at the heart of the Communist-
infiltrated rebel resistance in downtown 
Santo Domingo, Vance said: 
"What happens in the future will be gov-
erned by events and circumstances at the 
time." 
Presumably, if such an attack is launched 
by the loyalist forces they would either have 
to cross the U.S.-controlled east-west security 
corridor across the City or land fighting units 
from the sea. 
Presently, as emphasized by Vance, the pol-
icy of the American troops is to prohibit 
crossing of the corridor by any armed Domin-
ican forces, rebel or loyalist. Also, U.S. nava: 
vessels are patrolling the Santo Domingo axes 
from close offshore. 
Earlier, Gen, Antonio Imbert Barreras 
junta president, said the loyalist forces wil 
"very soon" launch a cleanup offensive

Some of the police wear army uniforms

Vance acknowledged that two small U.S.

Beitelo, for creation of a coalition govern-
ment headed by Guzman. 
Officials of the junta government, created

The Bundy formula would have the Guz-
Mat coalition govern under the Bosch con-
stitution, discarded when Bosch was top-
pled by a military coup in Seplember 1963. 
"The only proper formula is for the Domin-
ican people themselves to decide what kind 
of government and constitution they want 
through referendum or election," says Rivera 
Caminero. 
Yesterday, General Imbert summoned 
American Ambassador William Tapley Ben-
nett, Deputy Defense Secretary Cyrus Vance 
add Dr. Jose A. Mora, Secretary General 
of the Organization of American States, to 
his residence to Inquire what the United 
States was doing in its secret negotiations. 
It was learned that Bennett assured Im-
bert the United States is not trying to im-
pose a government upon the Dominican Re-
public, emphasizing that "this is matter 
for Eimninicans themselves to resolve," 
Nonetheless, sources in the rebel govern-
ment headed by Col. Francisco Caamano 
Deno, hinted strongly to newsmen that a 
"complete agreement with the United States" 
on a coalition headed by Guzman was im-
minent. 
American Embassy spokesmen insisted 
there is nothing to substantiate the claim, 
noting that there is a stalemate now, and 
saying only that talks are continuing. 
According to rebel informants, the Guzman 
coalition would include these Dominicans 
in a cabinet: 
:ar. Ramon Ledesma, minister of presidency, 
manber a Bosch's Dominican Revolution-
ar I Party (PRD); Hector Garcia Godoy, 
famign minister, a strong supporter of

11 big question among traditionally anti-
Coinmunist and pro-American Dominicans 
neor is why the U.S. attempts to ram Guz-
man into the provisional Presidency when 
it 'vas obvious in advance he would be un-
acceptable to the anti-Bosch and anti-Com-
munist elements, but pleasing to the rebels. 
It is argued by American manipulators 
tint Bosch won the Presidency with about 
60 percent of the vote in 1962. But how 
much of this was vote against his opponent 
is 11Dt discussed by the Americans. At least 
40 percent of the Dominican voters still are 
stn 'ugly anti-Bosch. 
-1Saere is doubt here that Bundy and others 
involved in settlement negotiations have 
been made fully aware of the backgrounds 
of acme of the "Constitutionalists" and PRD 
figiires they are dealing with. 
Washington officials, including Bundy, 
cot tend they are distressed by the lack of 
politicians on the Dominican scene. 
Signe have not even, been approached by 
U.S. officialdom. 
There are such capable Dominicans as Dr. 
Echtardo Read Barreras, former Chief Justice 
of Me Supreme Court and now Ambassador 
to Rome. And former President Emilio de 
1.108_ Santos. Both have unsullied reputa-
tions and are not vulnerable to attack from 
eitl ler side. 
It is also puzzling to many observers why 
the United States is using such emissaries 
as :)r. Jaime Benitez, Chancellor of the -EMI-
vernty of Puerto Rico, who is well known in 
the area for his anti-Americanism. He is 
here now at Bundy's request. 
Disturbing, too, is the manner in which 
? diplomats persuaded General Imbert 
an his four associates in the junta to ac-
cept the temporary government role, and 
thee attempted to dump them?in an ap-
parent concession to the rebels and the PRD

"OGEFERILLA SCHOOL" OPENS IN SANTO 
DOMINGO 
(By Hal Hendrix) 
SANTO DOMINGO, July 22.?A school to pro-
duct "instant guerrillas" has opened in the 
rebel zone of this battle-fatigued Dominican 
capital. 
The setting is Parque Infantil, a block-
sqt are children's park studded with swings, 
tee er-totters and big, red-blossomed trees. 
Ter the time being. Dominican children 
velsi play in the park must dodge small 
ust 23 1965 
groups of young men receiving basic guerrilla 
training. 
The school is in a. pocket of the rebel zone 
controlled by the pro-Castro June Fourteen 
Movement, which is alined with the "Con-
stitutionalists" of Col. Francisco Caamano 
Deno. 
A school director, who identified himself 
as a June Fourteen member but asked to re-
main anonymous, said there are 600 youths 
in training now, most of them supporters of 
the June Fourteen group. 
Most instructors also belong though some 
are members of the Dominican Revolution-
ary Party (PRD), whose titular head is ex-
President Juan Bosch. 
"Most of the people under arms now are 
members of the June Fourteen Movement," 
the director commented. "So it is reason-
able that the majority farce be teaching 
others how to carry on the struggle." 
The director said there are about 12,000 
armed persons in the rebel sector. He did 
not speculate how many were followers of 
his organization. 
"We are teaching the people how to fight 
urban guerrilla warfare, how to maintain the 
fight in the city," the director said. 
As he explained the school's purpose, he 
indicated training would continue regardless 
of the outcome of negotiations by the Or-
ganization of American States (OAS) for 
settlement of the 3-month Dominican hos-
tilities. 
U.S. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, chief 
OAS mediator, said later he was unaware of 
the school, but would be interested in look-
ing into its operations. 
The trainees use wooden sticks to simulate 
rifles in drills. The director said they would 
learn to use every type of rifle and auto-
matic weapon available in the country before 
the course is completed. 
Instruction is given also in the art of 
concocting Molotov cocktails?bottles filled 
with gasoline. 
As a teenage girl drill sergeant, in muddy 
blouse and bluejeans, gave combat instruc-
tions, the director said tactics being taught 
are the result of experience in the recent 
fighting here. 
"Dominican armed forces often shoot from 
a kneeling position," he said. "So the re-
cruits are learning to shoot on their stom-
achs and fire at the right level." 
Another group crawled back and forth 
across a muddy patch. "They are learning 
how to sneak up for an attack on a bar-
racks," said another June 14 member, 
A series of obstacle courses has been built 
for the trainees. 
One has lots of barbed, wire less than a 
foot off the ground. The object is to teach 
the youngsters how to crawl at curb level 
In city street fighting. 
The school day extends from 5:30 a.m. to 
6 p.m. with a noon lunch break. Classes 
are held 7 days a week. 
There also is classroom instruction. The 
director said students are taught morality, 
proper use of free time and the basic reason 
for "the Dominican struggle," which includes 
sovereignty, human rights and intervention 
by foreign troops. 
It was apparent the school has the po-
tential of creating the nucleus for a Do-
minican FALN, initials of the Castro-model 
Armed Forces of National Liberation in 
Venezuela. 
For older boys?and some girls?a more 
sophisticated school is opening across the 
street under direction of Col. Manuel R. 
Montes Arache, secretary of the armed forces 
in the Ca.amano regime. 
Montes .Arache, a frogman in the Domini-
can Navy, is offering courses in sabotage, 
espionage, demolition, communications and 
guerrilla warfare. 
Among other things, his students will learn 
how to pick off a sentry with a crossbow 
and arrow.

COMMUNISTS TOON LEAD 'ROLE ns REBELLION 
FROM START, SAYS 'WRITER WHO WAS 
THERE?ARTICLE 1 
(By Paul D. Bethel) 
Row did the Dominican Republic revolt 
start on April 24? Who were the prime 
Moyers? Who are the "gcxxl guys" and who 
are the "bad guys?" Was U.S. action justi-
fied? What is *U.S. policy today? 
There is impressive evidence that the Corn-
mUnists were in on the rebellion from the 
very beginning. They did not snatch the re-
volt from the hands of deposed President 
Juan Bosch's party, the PRD, as has been 
widely supposed. 
On March 16, just 5 weeks before the April 
24 revolt the central committee of the PSP-D 
(Communist Party) issued a manifesto. It 
called for "the return of Prof. Juan Bosch to 
legitimate control of the government." 
? The manifesto said: "The working people 
will achieve total liberation if it unites and 
fights to conquer?to eliminate the economic 
domination by North American imperialism 
and to establish Socialiit democracy which 
puts the wealth in the hands of the people." 
The manifesto thus endorsed Juan Bosch 
as the surest means of establishing its So-
cialist democracy. It incited the people to 
? violence to restore Bosch to the presidency in 
these words: 
"The entire population must fight in the 
streets, in the squares, in the factories, in 
? the fields, for the return of Juan Bosch as 
the head of the 'constitutional government." 
The Commit-list Party knew that Donald 
Reid Cabral, president of the civilian junta, 
- was unpopular and that his overthrow was 
imminent. The party had tested his strength 
In seven labor strikes over the period of a 
year. The strikes weakened the national 
economy, struggling under Reid's austerity 
program. Rational as his policies were, they 
made no friends for Reid among the Nation's 
business and labor leaders. 
? Then there was the military. 
Under U.S. guidance, Reid cracked ctown 
hard on graft and corruption in the armed 
forces?the first Dominican leader with the 
courage to do so. Bosch never challenged the 
authority of the generals nor made any ef-
fective moves to curb corruption. 
Under Bosch, the three big shots in the 
COntraband racket were the National Police 
Chief, Peguero Guerro; Air Force Gen. Atila 
-Luna and Army Gen. Vines Roman. They 
ran everything, from nylons to dope, and put 
millions of dollars. into their own pockets. 
-Reid dumped all three generals early this 
year in a cleanup of the government. He 
removed Luna and Roman from their com-
mands and fired Peguero. 
Reid had thus alienated the three pillars 
,needed for support?the military, labor, bus-
iness, Bosch's PRD and the Communists 
organized and waited for Reid's ouster. 
Ambassador W. Tapley Bennett told a 
group of us on April 29 that the PRD and the 
Communists had been collaborating. He 
said: "The Communists worked with Bosch's 
PRD for months and Were prepared well in 
advance of Reid'e overthrow." 
This was the importance of the March 
16 Communist manifesto. It was the blue-
print for the events which took place on 
April 24 and thereafter. - 
I also learned from an unimpeachable 
eource that Bosch met with two members of 
the Castro-Communist "14th of June move-
ment" in San Juan in early March. The 
two?Victoriano Felix and Rafael Taveras?
gbt Bosch's agreement to cooperate. 
'Taveras is a member of the central corn-
Alittee ,of the: party. Ale arranged to tape 
a qUestion-afid-'answer session with Bosch. 
The tape was taken by them to Santo Do-
mingo and turned over to Jose Brea, secre-
tary of finance of Bosch's PRD. He also 
owns the radio station, -Cristal. 
No, /55--,--8' 
Prevented fictra airing the tape by a Reid 
law, a transcript was made and read over the 
air April 9 on the program "Here is Santo 
Domingo." The program was sponsored by 
the 14th of June movement. 
Bosch's message was anti-American, rab-
ble-rousing and pro-Communist. The facts 
of the story have since been confirmed by 
official Washington sources. 
Another fact cementing the United States 
case that the revolt was Communist is pre-
sented by Jose Rafael Molina Urena, Bosch's 
provisional president during the first 4 days 
of the rebellion. He called on our U.S. Am-
bassador Tuesday night, April 27, and was, 
in the Ambassador's words, "a thoroughly 
defeated and dejected man who admitted to 
me that the rebel movement was in the 
hands of the Communists." Molina took 
asylum in the Colombian Embassy that same 
night. 
There can be little question that the Com-
munists, Bosch and Bosch's PRD collabo-
rated from the very beginning. Timing was 
the key element. The pocket-sized rebel-
lion of a few military officers on April 24 
provided the opening. The collaborators 
took it. Here is what happened: 
At 1:30 p.m. on that fateful Saturday, 
rumors began to fly in the slum areas of 
Santo Domingo that the Reid Cabral junta 
had been overthrown. People began to pour 
into the streets as the rumors multiplied and 
spread. 
Only a few hours earlier, Reid had dis-
patched Army Chief of Staff Gen. Marco 
Rivera Cuesta to the 27th of February Bar-
racks to sack two officers for graft and dis-
loyalty. Instead, Rivera Cuesta was sur-
rounded and taken prisoner. Immediately, 
the 16th of August Barracks threw in with 
the rebels, and the revolt was on. The bar-
racks are named after famous dates in Do-
minican history. 
Why the revolt? 
Officer of rank lower than general ap-
plauded Reid's moves against Roman, Pegu-
ero, and Luna. It gave them a chance to 
move up. But when Reid reached down, as 
he did that Saturday, to fire officers of rela-
tively junior rank, those same officers re-
belled. They saw in his move?perhaps ac-
curately?a plan to crush the power of the 
military. 
It is important to note at this moment, 
however, that the military insurgents had no 
intention of expanding their pocket-sized 
rebellion into a civil war. They merely 
wanted to get rid of Reid and the threat he 
posed to their privileged position. 
Gen. Elias Wessin y Wessin stepped in and 
tried to mediate the dispute. 
A career military officer, untainted by graft 
or corruption, Wessin y Wessin was feared by 
the Communists and respected by his col-
leagues. He has other power. He commands 
the military training center (CEFA) and, 
through it, the San Isidro Air Base with its 
Dominican armored force, paratroopers, and 
counterinsurgency teams. 
The Air Force is privileged. Not only does 
it have all the planes, but virtually every-
thing else. 
The rebels refused to surrender to Wessin 
y Wessin, and gambled that he would not 
push them too hard. They were right. The 
general had also begun to look upon Reid's 
moves againit the military with some con-
cern, since he felt that a weakening of the 
military establishment could only play into 
the hands of the Communists. He talked the 
situation over with the rebels and came up 
with a formula. That formula was to set up 
a joint military junta?rebel and loyalist?
and call for elections within 90 days. 
Wessin y Wessin defends his actions. He 
had backed Reid for nearly 2 years. But he 
said he knew that Reid could never pull 
through the April crisis. He urged Reid to 
20513 
resign "rather thin see the country plunged 
Into chaos." 
Reid had a few things to say. In an inter-
view on May 3, while in hiding in Santo 
Domingo, he said: "The Communists used 
the resentment of the military toward me 
and were able to undermine civilian con-
trol." 
Nevertheless, the doughty Scotch-Domini-
can made a stab at staying in power, over-
riding the advice of General Wessin y Wessin. 
That Saturday night he broadcast an ulti-
matum to the rebels. They were to surren-
der by 5 am, the next day, he said, or they 
would be attacked by loyalist forces. But 
there were no loyalist forces. 
Wessin y Wessin refused to back him any 
longer. Reid Cabral was through. 
Taken in the context of Latin-American 
politics, Reid's critics had a point. True, 
they say, he was cleaning up corruption. 
True, they also say, he tried to develop ra-
tional economic policies. Not true, they say, 
that he intended to hold elections as prom-
ised in September of this year?unless he 
was sure of winning. 
He made himself Secretary of War. He 
brought the 10,000-man national police force 
under his control. He tried to unite smaller 
political parties behind him. 
However, Reid's views or alleged views 
about elections also had a point. 
In that same May 3 interview, he stressed 
the need to prepare for elections. Illiteracy 
in the Dominican Republic runs around 70 
stcrcent. The people were under the suffo-
cating dictatorship of Generalissimo Rafael 
Trujillo Molina for 32 years. 
Commencing only with the assassination 
of Trujillo on May 30, 1961, political parties 
have little real strength and no tradition. 
The Communists have that. Reid seemed to 
feel that early elections, without several 
years' preparation, would play into the hands 
of the Communists and demagogs. 
No rational budgetary procedures had been 
followed under Bosch, "The first freely 
elected President in 32 years," and he made 
a mess of things. Military-contracting offi-
cers made all kinds of import deals?when 
they could get a rake-off of between 10 and 
20 percent. Importers vied with each other 
in offering higher rake-offs. So the mili-
tary signed deals that committed the budget 
for 5 or 10 years ahead. 
Reid established a budget commission and 
headed it himself. No purchases were per-
-misted unless this commission stamped the 
contract to show that the Government had 
the money to pay. All purchasers had to 
deposit 40 percent in advance against the 
purchase of foreign goods. But by the time 
Reid was in a position to enforce economic 
control, the debt was already sky high. 
One effect was to close the door after the 
horses had escaped. The other was to lay 
him open to charges of wanting to become 
a dictator. It did not seem to matter that 
Reid Cabral had few trusted aides to turn to. 
The facts suggest that civilian junta 
President Donald Reid Cabral came on the 
scene too late. Badly needed in 1962 and 
1963, his policies in 1964 and 1965 satisfied 
nobody and alienated sources of support 
needed to keep him in power and carry out 
those policies.

1H uses were carefully searehed and 
intended te show the people that the air 
force had not gone over US the rebels, as the 
rebel radio was claiming. However, rebel 
announcers deftly countered by saying that 
the planes were flown by Cuban exile "mer-
cenaries." Several thousand Cubans were 
living in Santo Domingo. 
When that fiction no longer held up, the 
turbos (street' gang mustlemen) were called 
into action. They rounded up the relatives 
of pilots who were living in the city and 
took them to the television station. There, 
they were forced to plead With the pilots to 
stop the strafing. In some cases, rifles aimed 
at them were clearly visible to the viewers. 
When the televised appearances did not 
stop the air force, families of the pilots were 
herded into military targets to be among the 
first to die. The planes came anyway. 
"Everyone ran," said Colonel Palanco, 
",`pilots' wives, children, fathers, and their 
turba guards who counted on the presence 
of the hostages as a shield for themselves." 
Crtule leaflets were dropped on the city 
by the Air Force warning the public to get 
out of certain areas marked for bombing. 
, The rebel radio countered by urging the pee-
-pie to rush to those areas in cold-blooded 
use of civilians to protect rebel positions.. 
How many Were killed is not known, but 
by April 29 the U.S. Embassy estimated that 
'there had been 1,800 casualties in the city 
from all causes?among them around 600 
dead,. It turned out later that this was a 
conservative figure. 
By Sunday night, outwardly it appeared 
that the rebels had the upper hand. But at 
the same time, many leaders were taking 
asylum in Latin American embassies?
among them a relatively obscure lieutenant 
colonel by the name of Francisco Oaamano 
Deno. Up to this point, he had played no 
significant role in the revolt. 
The tide began to turn slightly in favor 
of the loyalists, and at 7 a.m. Tuesday the 
main base of San Isidro got a radio station 
operating. It told the people in target areas 
to get out and go to the Quisqueya baseball 
stadium, the El Embajador Hotel, and the 
Perla Antillana_ Hippodrome *here they 
could seek refuge and get food and water. 
The, rebel-held Santo Domingo radio de-
manded that the people stay where they 
were, and in some instances they enforced 
their demand for nearly a week. 
With San Isidro on the air, the scattered 
elepaen-ts of the Dominican armed forces 
began to pull themselves together. The first 
target to be knocked-out was the rebel radio. 
The radio was the only one which reached 
the ,entire country, and it carried accounts 
Of a complete rebel victory. 
In retrospect, it seems miraculous that the 
whole country did not throw in with the 
rebels during those first few days. It serves 
as a cominentary on rebel claims that theirs 
_ 
was a social, popular revolution. The coun-
try remained quiet and under loyalist control. 
At 8:45 a.m. on Tuesda-y, Dominican Air 
Force vampire jets hit the' rebel station. The 
Dominican Navy cruised slowly offshore lob-
? bing shells at the rebel-held Palace and the 
rebel radio. At '11 :50 a.m, the radio abruptly 
left the air.

ha landed to April' 29, and they were 
used only to protect the.V.S. Embassy-from 
sniper fire and to secure the El Embajador 
Hotel, which was headquarters for the evac-
uation of eivilians. 
And. it Was not until: 3 434 liter" that 
raa?tine Unkts and the Fpo Aixborne Division 
forged a corridor through the outskirts of 
the city as an evacuation route. This cor-
ridor hemmed in the rebels, but it also pre-
vented loyalist forces from attacking rebel 
positions in the city. 
In fact, on April 30 in the first interview 
held with the rebel command's political ad-
viser, Hector Aristy, I was told that the 
rebels intended to hold the center of the 
city. They planned to enter into negotia-
tions with the peace commission of the Or-
ganization of American States which was to 
arrive the following day. The tactics were 
to gain at the conference table what they 
had been unable to win by force of arms. 
Aristy said that the rebel zone was well-
stocked with arms and food. "We can hold 
out indefinitely here," he said. "In fact, I 
expect to get fat on all of the good food we 
have." 
By this time, Lt. Col. Francisco Caamano 
Deno was the nominal leader of the rebels. 
With PRD-man Jose Molina Urena in asy-
lum, the leaderless rebels needed a new front. 
Again, Juan Bosch made the selection?or 
agreed to it. Caamano came out of asylum 
in the Argentine Embassy on Tuesday, April 
27, and took over. 
The rebels moved fast to prepare for the 
peace commission of the OAS. They stalled 
on the cease-fire until they could round up - 
some members of the old Bosch congress. 
Caamano was voted in as tstitutional 
President on May 4, and the ame of the 
rebel movetnent changed to the constitu-
tional government. The cease-fire was for-
mally ratified by them in that name. The 
loyalists signed merely as "the Governing 
Military Junta." 
Any thinking person can see which title 
carries the greatest propaganda appeal. Thus 
the rebels got the OAS to deal with them 
on a level generally reserved for govern-
ments of legally recognized authority. They 
had gotten the rebel radio functioning again, 
and were winning the propaganda battle. 
Caamano's pretensions were given a dose 
of Johnsonian diplomacy. Highly placed 
U.S. officials pointed out that under the 
constitution a military man may not be pres-
ident. But the damage had already been 
done. The signing of the OAS document 
had extended to the rebels a certain dignity 
and status. 
Highly placed 'U.S. officials threw another 
dash of cold water on rebel enthusiasm. 
They said that the night before Caamano's 
investiture, he had met with four top Com-
munists. He could be top man the next day 
on two conditions, he was told. One, that 
if he should win out in negotiations and 
come to power, he mutt give important po-
sitions to the Communists. Two, in those 
negotiations, he must get concrete assur-
ances of safe conduct for Communists out 
of the country, should he lose. U.S. officials 
say that he agreed to both demands. 
The three-man military junta had given 
way, under the patient prodding of President 
Johnson's civilian envoy, John Barlow Mar-
tin, to a five-man Government of national 
reconstruction, headed by Antonio Imbert 
Barreras. By May 17, a combination of 
forcea from the Navy, Army, the tank corps, 
and the police began to mop up the north-
eastern part of the city?north of the armed 
U.S. corridor and the international zone. 
The goal of the mop-up was to flush out 
snipers, capture caches of arms, and thus 
return the greater part of the city to a sem-
blance Qf normalcy. 
went along with the lead tanks for several 
lapclis, at times under heavy the. The troops 
maintained, good discipline. They searched 
each house over a vast area. Suspected 
snipers had their shoulders examined for 
bruises from rifle and automatic weapons re-
coil. Their pants were rolled up above their 
knees for signs of extended kneeling in sniper 
nests. Telltale evidence sent suspects to the 
rear for further interrogation. Others were 
et go. o 
arms caches sent to the rear in trucks and 
armored vehicles. 
One vignette of the wax: 
A group of 11 rebels, firing a .50-caliber 
machinegun sandbagged atop a British-made 
Land Rover, were cut down as they raced into 
loyalist lines. An army ambulance arrived 
almost immediately and took away the 
bodies. 
People in houses around the vehicle began 
to emerge as the loyalists moved up the 
street. They talked. One said: "When the 
tanks are in the next block, we can dis-
mantle it." They meant the vehicle. 
I had to leave to make a broadcast for 
Mutual News. I came back in an hour. The 
car was completely stripped?its headlights, 
steering wheel, tires, most of the engine, 
even the brake drums. I asked why they did 
it. One turned to me and replied: "Chico, we 
have to live, don't we?" 
I talked to people in the houses. Almost 
as soon as the loyalist troops had passed, 
housewives began to sluice down their side-
walks with water and clean the streets. 
I noticed that they referred to loyalist 
troops as our troops. I asked how come? 
Only a few hours before this section had 
housed rebel snipers, hadn't it? They 
shrugged and said they had no means to get 
them out. And besides, it now looked like 
the loyalists were going to win. 
Friday noon was the deadline for a 12-hour 
Red Cross truce. It was agreed upon by 
both sides so that bodies could be removed. 
However, there was the feeling that this 
wedge-opener would be used to extend the 
truce. (It was.) This meant that loyalist 
forces had to complete their mop-up by 
noon. They did so. 
By exactly 12 noon on Friday. May 21, 
loyalist forces had driven across the north-
ern part of the city and stood on the banks 
of the upper Ozama River. They had the 
rebels completely surrounded, with U.S. 
forces interposed between rebels and 
loyalists. 
There is an importance to this story. 
When it became clear that the U.S. forces 
were preventing the loyalists from attacking 
the last rebel, stronghold, questions were 
asked. The answer, from one official source, 
is that the "Dominican Army couldn't fight 
its way out of a paper bag." Another opined 
that the rebels, entrenched in the city, would 
clobber them. Still another source was 
bitter about Wessin y Wessin's failure to 
move into the city on Sunday, the day after 
the revolt had broken out. 
However, there were no U.S. liaison Army 
men with Dominican troops as they cleaned 
up the northern part of the city. There is 
an apparent failure on the part of our offi-
cials to recognize the power of Communist 
propaganda?powerful enough to virtually 
Immobilize Dominican forces for 3 days.

_ Thefiring was coming from the vicinity of

InisPielous, the aide reluctantly permitted us 
to talk with the colonel. He said that the 
rebels might launch another attack on the 
palace. 
Andy suggested that we drive down into 
the rebel lines to see what was going on. 
We did. I drove about eight blocks, lateral 
to the line of fire, and parked the car. We 
got out and walked another several blocks 
into the rebel zone. 
Suddenly bullets started zipping around 
is., We flattened ourselves against the walls 
as heads bobbed out of houses and motioned 
us to make small targets of ourselves. On 
the street corner opposite, two men motioned 
us to cross. When the firing had died down, 
we clid ,so. 
One of them said that Wessin y Wessin's 
troops were firing on Marine positions. I 
looked around and saw American uniform 
several blocks away. They marked the armed 
corridor to the airport, forged by the 82d 
Airborne and the Marines 2 weeks earlier. 
Speaking halting English, the Dominican 
insisted that Wessin y Wessin's troops were 
slIoating at U.S. Marines, not the rebels. He 
painted down into deep rebel-held' Santo 
Deiningo: "There are two bodies of Wessin 
y Wessin soldiers there." Andy and I looked 
w; one another. / replied in Spanish that 
we were not idiots, and turned to leave. 
,f'No," he said, in Spanish. "Don't go." 
A aother 10 toughs L.ppeared, making a 
mlque. All insisted that the Wessin y Wessin 
troops were trying to get rebels and U.S. 
BC idlers fighting each other. They kept re-
puting that the two bodies of the Wessin y 
Wessin troops were there. "How do you know 
tt at they are troops of Wessin y Wessin?" 1 
ked. 
"Because they wear the insignia," the lead-
er replied. 
They did not know that Andy and I had 
just come from the palace. They did not 
In ow that we knew where the lines were. 
Alai they kept insisting, to the point of where 
the leader said the bodies of the alleged Wes, 
sin y Wessin soldiers "had been there for 3 
days." 
Andy looked at the organizer and mumbled 
to me: "And just why, Paul, do you think 
th ay should be left there for 3 days, eh?" 
rhe answer was phony evidence to be 
sh awn to unsuspecting people?OAS and re-
porters. With the battle going on at this mo-
nt, we couldn't go to the bodies. I 
ag.dn told the leader that we weren't idiots, 
th at insignia could be planted. He thought 
for a moment, and said nothing. Suddenly, 
hif face lighted up. "I want you to see the 
horses blown down by Yankee fire." 
Andy saw the opportunity for some good 
ph ztos, so we moved out of our sanctuary 
ant edged our way along the line of inter-
mittent fire. 
10'e almost didn't make it. A mortar shell 
eq loded in an alleyway about 50 yards away. 
All of us, the turbas included, dived for 
sat sty. We looked up to see smoke and dust 
bil: owing out of the alley. We also saw a 
wo:nan dash out of a house nearby, holding 
her bleeding head in a towel. 
The cry went up from the turbas: "Yan-
kees are killing Dominicans. Yankees are 
killing Dominicans. Each street corner came 
alive with well-organized groups of between 
6 and 10 persons, all shouting: Yankees are 
killing Dominicans. Out with the Yankee 
dogs." One variation was: "Out with the 
wh: te Yankee dogs." It was a ticklish situa-

the palace. We knew that the turbas knew 
it. 
Tae woman, now helped by a man, was

alle Tway, lateral to the sniper fire hammer-

won an was bleeding but was able to run like 
hell_ A Red Cross ambulance, a Volkswagen 
station wagon, roared up. The mobs on the 
corr*r shouted: "Yankees are killing Domin-
icans." She collapsed gracefully into the 
arm 3 of the crowd. They put her into the 
amt filance. Andy took shots, furiously. 
A/ the ambulance rounded the corner, I 
saw her sitting between two men in the 
bad:, chattering away excitedly. 
'Bre crowds on the corners shouted "Yan-
kees are killing Dominicans." Then a 
Swei Bah car, a Saab, came roaring at us from 
the rebel lines. It was crowded with rebels, 
in motley dress, carrying submachine guns 
and rifles. 
They glowered at us fiercely, and pointed 
their guns at us menacingly. Then one of 
the mob shouted: "You're in the line of 
maxi Ce fire." 
Plorce expressions turned to slack-jawed 
pant,. The driver slammed the car into s 
gear, roared around the corner, and out of 
sight. Andy and x took a deep breath. I 
looked at the leader and sold: "Wessin y 
Wessin's troops, eh?" He shrugged and 
laughed. 
The only way we could get out of the zone 
and back to my car was to walk about a 
hundred yards with our backs to rebel snip-
ers. Thus far, there had been more noise 
than actual fighting. But just then, rebel 
snipers winged a burst into the wall just over 
our heads, and we heard the screeching sound 
of the ricochet. 
"That was for US," Andy said. "Let's get 
out of here." 
We walked the hundred yards slowly and 
nonchalently, our spines tingling. After an 
eternity we rounded the corner and gave a 
sigh of relief. 
We walked along the relatively safe area 
next to U.S. troops. We talked to the people 
in the houses. They were tired of having 
their houses turned into snipers' nests. They 
were afraid of the turbos and the law of the 
streets. They were leaving the rebel zones in 
droves. 
Two civilians of pleasant mien attached 
themselves to us. Andy is Hungarian, with 
the accent.. Our two companions asked who 
We were. And 
.n Spanishthat we 
were Brazilian. "Good," they said, and urged 
Andy to tell the story of how Yankees were

The next day around noon, Andy rushed 
into my TOORIS. "This is Havana, 1959," he 
exclaimed. "There are bearded guys, and the 
whole smell of the place is exactly like it was 
in 1959 in Cuba." 
Andy had gone into the center of the city. 
He had an appointment with rebel leader 
Francisco Caamano and photographed him. 
"But guess what," Andy said to me, "Re-
member the two fellows from yesterday? 
Well, I was walking Into the Caamano head-
quarters, and someone said: 'Hello Brazilian.' 
I asked him how he knew I was Brazilian and 
it turns out that he was one of the two we 
saw yesterday. The two of them in Caama-
no's headquarters, armed and guarding the 
place." 
I later learned from the loyalist G-2 that 
arms were cached in strong points in the 
rebel-held part of the city. Actually, strong 
points were few. NO one was permitted to 
take arms from one strong point to another, 
even though personnel were rotated frequent-
ly for intelligence-gathering purposes. Un-
armed, and on the street, the rebels were just 
ordinary citizens. 
Mobs were organized and controlled in the 
classic manner. What was going on in rebel 
territory was a carbon copy of Cuba's mobs

JOHNSON AIDS CALL FOR A CONSENSUS RE-

GOVERNMENT?ARTICLE 5 
(By Paul D. Bethel) 
As the first handful of correspondents en-
tered the El Embajador Hotel in Santo 
Domingo on April 29, a fleshy, confident-
looking man left. Driven to the helicopter 
port set up by Marines near the hotel in a 
U.S. Embassy station wagon, Antonio Imbert 
Berraras left for San Isidro Air Base to set 
up a new junta. 
Imbert Barreras is tough. and purposeful. 
He had to be. He and four colleagues killed 
the hated dictator Generalissimo Rafael 
Trujillo Minn? on May 30, 1961. By doing 
so, Imbert Barreras became a sort of national 
hero. A sort of national hero because his 
background is not unblemished. But few 
backgrounds in the Dominican Republic are. 
However, Imbert Barreras is a stanch 
Catholic. More, he is a graduate of the.

Little by little the story poured out. 
"On ,Sunday, May _13, Mr. Mann met with

My Washington source also said that even 
if Imbert managed to defy the United States 
and remain in power, the result would be 
civil war. Arms would be cached, plots 
hatched, and the revolt would spread. 
An officer of the Dominican counterinsur-
gency force said that Cuban arms had been 
cached over a period of several years. He also 
said that in the sweep by Imbert forces across 
the northern part of the city, "tons of cached 
arms had been found." He continued: "If 
our forces had not made the sweep, those 
arms would never have been found." The 
counterinsurgency officer was trained in the 
United States. 
Regarding the lack of real support for 
Imbert, I asked my Washington source: 
"What about the fact that the 130,000-mem-
ber National Confederation of Free Workers 
(CONTRAL) is supporting Imbert?" Here 
he got a little vague, and fell back on his 
earlier statement that Imbert did not win 
popularity fast enough. 
The inescapable conclusion is that Presi-
dent Johnson's advisers are sensitively at-
tuned to "world opinion." They were in-
fluenced by initial press reports which dog-
gedly refused to recognize the Communist 
menace and tended to romanticize rebel 
leader Lt. Col. Francisco Caamano Deno. 
Thus influenced, Johnson's advisers went 
looking for compromise rather than solution. 
As of this writing, the rebels still control 
the center of Santo Domingo and have 
launched a potent propaganda campaign 
from their festering pocket of resistance.

TELLS ROLE OF REDS IN DOMINICAN REVOLT 
(By Jules Dubois) 
SANT) DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, 
April 21.?The inside story of how this coun-
try came within 12 hours of a Communist 
takeovie last Monday was related today by 
the priocipal actor in that drama. 
Gen. tias Wessin y Wessin, the Dominican 
Govern inent's anti-Communist military 
leader at the time, said in an exclusive inter-
view ti at had he failed to convince the re-
luctant _air force and army chiefs to attack 
the Communists at 6 a.m. Monday, the Reds 
would aave been in power that night. 
POE OF REDS 
I interviewed the tired general?who had 
not slept or eaten a solid meal since Satur-
day night and wore a stubble beard?in his 
office at the army training center several 
miles fr cm the San Isidro air base. Wessin's 
telephoae lines had been cut by the Com-
munisti land he had to use the air force head-
quarter 3 as a command post. 
Wessi fa is no longer the strong man of the 
military-here, but he remains the most out-
spoken anti-Communist. Be was shoved 
into th background because he refuses to 
eompro:nise with the leftists. 
He toad me that he hoped to resign from 
the army soon, at the age of 41, and become 
a farme e. Wessin was educated at the mili-
tary academy in Venezuela and at the Los 
Chorrill is Military School in Lima, Peru, 
when Gen. Nicholas Lindley was comman-
dant. lb 1962, General Lindley headed, the 
military 'junta in Peru. 
Weed: I blamed deposed President Donald 
J. Reid- Cabral for ignoring reports that an 
army co is-piracy was-brewing against his rule. 
"The gmspiracy was very big," Wessin said. 
"We sad the country by ,only a hairpin. 
There v Tee conspirators even here at the 
aining,penter. 
"The I great majority of the people here did 
not knee w what was really happening. 
"I had reported the conspiracy to President 
Reid for al.5 or 20 consecutive days," Wessin 
said, "bit he did not pay any attention to 
me." _ 
Wesshe had bitter words about Gen. Marco 
Rivera-C -fiesta, at the time army chief of 
staff. Viessin said Rivera also was lax about 
the conspiracy. The rebels captured Rivera 
last Satiarday and held him hostage at the 
16th of august fortress. 18 miles from here. 
The air force blasted that fortress into use-
lessness, Passin said. 
TELLS THEIR AIM 
"This ionspiracy was not an isolated one, 
nor was it exclusively military," Wessin said. 
"The conspirators were in league with the 
Communists from the beginning. As part 
of the subversive preparation they instigated 
fires thai were set in the sugar cane fields 
and inet gated a strike at the La Romans/. 
plantation. The fires there .alone caused $7 
million damage." 
Wessin said the primary objective of rebel 
officers was to restore teenier President Juan 
Bosch to power. 
"I consider this conspiracy was directed 
by him from Puerto Rico and that Fidel 
Castro [Communist premier of Cuba] also 
participated in it. Both.have caused so much 
damage. The Dominican people must now 
have come to realize that," Wessin said. 
While I visited diplomatic friends at the 
Argentine Embassy today, where eight rebel 
officera had received asylum, four of them 
asked permission to leave the Embassy. Em-
bassy officials told me the officers wanted 
to return to rebel command posts. They 
were allowed to leave the Embassy. 
CONFIDENT OF VICTORY 
The Argentine diplomats said that the 
rebel officers,. who were dressed in civilian 
clothes, were confident that their side would 
ultimately win in the capital because the 
junta had up to now been unable to wipe 
them out. They want to be on the winning 
side. 
Wessin charged that Fidel Castro is in-
volved in the revolution. He said the armed 
forces intercepted a call to Castro that was 
made from the presidential palace after the 
Communists took possession Sunday after-
noon. 
Wessin said leaders cif the Communists 
entered the palace Sunday afternoon with 
Bosch's candidate for the interim presidency, 
Jose Rafael-Molina-Morina. Among the 
leaders were Dato Pagan: who was one of the 
prisoners released from La Victoria by the 
military rebels, and the Ducoudray-Juan and 
Felix Servio, old guard Members of the Com-
munist party. 
I asked Wessel why he did not attack on 
Sunday morning as ordered by President 
Reid. 
"The navy started in this with us," Wessin 
said, "and then decided to be neutral. The 
same happened with the air force. Then a 
group of the 'officers of the air force were 
ready to surrender and accept the conditions 
of the rebels."

SANTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, May 
8.?The United States tonight Protested to 
the ''OrganiatiOn of American States- a new 
violation of the cease-fire in Santo Domingo 
by the rebel forces of Col. Francisco A. 
Caamano against American troops. - 
A separate note also protested the vitriolic 
attacks on the Dominican and 'United States 
Governments by the rebel radio. 
ANOTHER MARINE KILLED _ 
American Ambassador W. Tapley Bennett, 
Jr., sent a note to Ambassador Frank Morrice, 
Jr., of Panama, the senior OAS representative 
here. Morrice received the note at the Hotel 
Ambassador where he has his headquarters. 
The note was drafted after another marine 
was killed today by rebel inflltraters at the 
port of Haina, 12 miles south of here. This 
casualty boosted the grand total of American 
dead from rebel bullets to 12. A sailor who 
fell overboard from his ship was the 13th 
death. . 
Of these dead there have -' been seven 
marines, five soldiers, and one sailor. 
amens MORE HOSTILE 
The protest letter was sent after attempts 
by Jose Antonio Mora, Secretary General of 
the OAS, to talk with Caamano and get him 
to agree to end hostilities and lay down his 
arms, failed. 
It is understood that the Caamano camp 
was more hostile to Mora today than it has 
been before and the rebel "constitutional 
president" could at no time talk with Mora 
alone. He was always surrounded by men 
who blocked the efforts of Mora to talk alone 
with Caamano. 
Radio Santo Domingo, which went silent 
at 2:15 p.m., returned at 5 p.m. on the regu-
lar frequency of the powerful transmitter 
that is in rebel hands, instead of the special 
one it was using. 
The radio increased the intensity of its 
attacks against the United States and against 
(len. Antonio Imbert-Barrera, head of the 
five-man military junta formed to oppose the 
rebels. 
The, foreign minister of Caamano's "con-
stitutional government," Jottin Curry, sent 
a . strong protest to Ambassador Morrice 
against the international security? zone 
which is manned by U.B. troops with token 
forces of Dominican police in army uniforms. 
RAPS SECURITY ZONE 
Curry complained that the security zone 
is there solely to confront the Caamano 
forces with opposing forces and to harbor the 
Imbert government, which has its seat in-
side the zone. 
No mention was made by Curry of the fact 
that the headquarters of Bosch's Dominican 
Revolutionary Party (PHI)) are also 'inside 
the security zone and are open for business. 
Imbert was not inactive today. He met 
with all provincial_ governors and mayors of 
provincial capitals. With the exception of 
the national district of Santo Domingo, they 
reported the entire country is calm.

tion, headed by Brig. Gen. Antonio Imbert 
Barrera today purged the military forces of 
ranking officers. It indicated that it will 
exhaust every peaceful effort to get the rebel 
forces of Col. Francisco A. Caamano to capit-
ulate before trying to blast them out of the 
10 percent of this city which they hold. 
That 10 percent is almost the entire busi-
ness district. Imbert emphasized that his 
government controls the rest of the country's 
27 provinces. 
Imbert held a press conference with the 
four other members of the government. Be 
announced that six of the officers purged al-
ready have been shipped out of the country 
In the best interests of the nation.

dual Capacity as Ambassador to the White 
House. As the United States does not yet 
cognize the Imbert regime, no mention was 
Made of that post. 
The new Foreign Minister, Horacio Vicioso-
Soto, was introduced to the press by Imbert. 
Vicioso said he had cabled all Dominican em-
bassies abroad and instructed the a3nbassa-
dOrS to notify the respective governments of 
*he new regime and request recognition. 
Imbert announced that Commodore Fran-
Mac? Javier Rivera-Carninero is the Secretary 
of the armed forces and police and as such is 
overall commander of the forces, lie also 
announced the three chiefs of staff as Brig. 
Oen. Juan de los Santos-cespedes, air force, 
a reappointment; Brig. Gen. Jacinto Mar-
tinez-Arana army, a new appointee, and 
Commodore Emilio Jimenez, navy head. 
Imbert said the high officers who were 
palmed and shipped out today acceded to his 
personal request in behalf of his "partners' 
in the new civilian-military junta. 
4r put as a condition that it was necessary 
for the country that they leave the ranks of 
our armed forces," Imbert said. "We thought 
that it was a good step to get tranquility and 
peace in this country." 
ZS Meta Wzaster 
Asked about Brig. den. Elias Wessin y 
Wessin, the officer most smeared iv the Corn-
=Mists, Imbert said Wessin will remain in 
his post as corranander of the training cen-
ter. Ile added that he will not allow 
Illeamario t? linpose the purge of Wessin as a 
precondition for the rebel leader to lay down 
his arms. 
"We haven't asked him to resign and we do 
not intend to ask him, to resign," Imbert said. 
Lfftbert stressed that he and his colleagues 
Will not wait indefinitely for Caaman,o to 
/Cake up his mind to capitulate. The deci-
sion to act Will ,not be made by Imbert alone 
but will be a result of unarihnity with his 
four "partners," as he calls them. 
Imbert reiterated what he said in his in-
augural address on Friday?that the rebels 
will be offered all guarantees for their per-
natal safety and safe conduct if they sur-
render. He indicated that diplomatic ef-
forts are being made to persuade Caamano 
to capitulate, although the latter and his 
spokesmen have stated the contrary. 
? ,,"Polorrel ,Oaaniano and myself have been 
for Several years, good, good friends," Imbert 
Said. "We are doing all that we can to avoid 
any action," 
Six 105 mm. howitzers were placed in front 
of the Hotel Ambassador after bulldozers pre-
pared their sites. The guns have a range of

UNI TED STATES FINISHES BIGGEST AIR LIFT 
S WeE 1948 OPERATION TO BERLIN?FLAT 
T caz Is ONLY MISHAP DURING 1,702 Tares 
(By Jules DuBois) 
SOTTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, May 
9.?The biggest airlift since that of Berlin in 
1941 was completed here with only 1 mishap. 
'Mat was a flat tire on a C-130 after it 
lam led at the San Isidro Airbase with the 
man who directed the operation from Pope 
Air Force Base near Fort Bragg, N.C. 
E e is Maj. Gen. Marvin L. McNickle, a 
veteran of 29 years of service in the U.S. Air 
For N. Today he commands the 5th logistics 
command, which is the air task force here. 
- FLIES 13,412 TROOPS 
Prom the time the deployment period 
star ted on April 30, until it ended last Thurs-
day the C-130 and C-124 transports made 
1,7q trips from the United States, an aver-
age of 243 a day. 
The planes carried 13,412 troops and 20,-
774 600 tons of cargo. 
The outstanding feature of the lift was 
the fact that the planes were turned around 
hen, in record time. The average ground 
time was only 19 minutes for the C-130 and 
the C-124 in 59 minutes. The latter took 
40 minutes more than the former, McNickle 
explained, because of the more obsolete un-
lora ling facilities and the type of cargo, such 
as graders and mixers. 
- rrozirrNa 'To cosanutz 
"there has never been anything to corn-
part with it in a span of time," McNickle 
answered when asked for a comparison with 
the ,/Ei.erlin airlift. "I have never seen any-
thing like it in my 29 years of experience." 
'I he airlift here failed to surpass the daily 
real trd of the Berlin airlift in cargo tonnage 
but if the aggregate of troops flown in were 
added it most certainly did outdo it. 
The record for the Berlin airlift was 1,432 
tont a cargo delivered in 1 day. Here the 
feescai7d was 1,403 tons of cargo, only 29 tons 
VAMPIRE IS DAMAGED

Isle ro Airbase, with the exception of a dam-
age a British Vampire jet which is at the 
Sat tiago de los Cabelleros Airbase, 75 miles 
north-northeast of here. 
"We asked the Dominican Air Force to 
bring them all in from outlying bases," Mc-
Nic de said, "and they have been most 
cooperative." 
- PRAISE POE CoNnrritari 
F-51's are lined up in formation on a 
ramp to the left of McNickle's headquarters. 
The headquarters are in the Dominican Air 
For se operations building, where a joint

Americans work side by side?is in operation. 
A 6cNickle had high praise for the opera-
tics ;al conditions of the more than 30 Mus-= 
tangs. 
"they are in perfect operational shape," 
he said. "I have on my staff here former 
Wo.'ld War n fighter pilots who have ad-

WON'T RESIGN DOMINGO JOB, GENERAL SAYS?
VOWS To CONTINUE FIGHTING REDS 
? (By Jules Dubois) 
SANTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, May 
11.?This country's leading anti-Communist 
military commander will not resign from the 
service until the Reds are wiped out. 
This is the determined and uncompromis-
ing position of Brig. Gen. Elias Wessin y Wes-
sin, commander of the army training center. 
He so told me today in an exclusive interview 
at his headquarters outside the perimeter 
of the San Isidro Air Base. ? 
The U.S. Embassy had announced yester-
day that Wessin had resigned in a move to 
bring peace to this embattled Republic but 
said earlier today that he had changed his 
mind. 
STILL IN COMMAND 
Wessin was in command at the base and 
his morale and that of his officers and men 
were high.. 
"I have not resigned," he said. "I do not 
intend to resign, and nobody is going to pres-
sure me into resigning." 
Wessin said that both American Ambassa-
dor W. Tapley Bennett, Jr., and Lt. Gen. 
Bruce Palmer, Jr., cbmmanding all US.. 
forces in the Dominican Republic, were very 
courteous to him yesterday. But, he added, 
he resisted pressure by them to quit and to 
leave the country. 
"I did give Ambassador Bennett, at his 
request, a letter in which I certified that I 
would be willing to resign as soon as peace 
was restored to the country and the new 
government was on its road to reconstruc-
tion," Wessin said. 
Wessin raid that he has not been asked to 
resign by Brig. Gen. Antonio Imbert Barrera, 
President of the Government of national re-
construction. 
WOULD HELP REDS 
"The morale of my troops was at a low ebb 
yesterday," Wessin said. ""My resignation, or 
my enforced retirement, would not only be 
a major victory for the rebels but would in-
vite the disintegration of the army." 
Wessin said that he was certain that his 
troops here at the army training center, who 
total about 2,000, and those in garrisons in 
the provinces, would, on learning of his 
resignation from the army, immediately lay 
down their arms and go home. 
. "There would be no fight left in them," he 
added. 
"It would be the delivery of the country to 
the Communists on a golden platter." 
TIED UP BY TRUCE 
Wessin said that his troops are ready to 
clean up the rebel city but that the hands 
of the loyalist forces are tied by the truce of 
the Organization of American States. 
"While the rebels freely attack American 
troops along the corridor and the entire in-
ternational security zone," Wessin said, "we 
are not even allowed to move." 
President Imbert said today that he has 
received no resignation from Wessin, but that 
he would be "glad to accept one." 
Imbert was relu&tant to issue a decree 
yesterday that would have sent Wessin into 
enforced retirement. He does not plan to do 
that unless he gets a signed resignation from 
Wessin. Neither does he plan, at this time, 
to ask Westin for his resignation. 
The move to force out Wessin was intended 
by the Embassay to placate rebels led by Col. 
Francisco A. Caaraano, who calls himself the 
constitutional president.

rim FOILED IN DOMINGO?REDS REMAIN?, 
DUBOIS TELLS OF MOVEMENT 
[knife swingers' as well as army troops. 
The machetemen slashed the wrists of cap-
tured invaders and the brutal treatment of 
the prisoners made the frustrated invasion 
and its date an attractive slogan for the ad-
versaries of the tyrant. 
Between 1959 and June, 1960, the 14th of 
June movement was organized in the under-
ground. Its original declaration of principles 
and platform appeared attractive to a con-
siderable segment of the Dominican people. 
The man who organized the movement 
was Dr. Tavares, a brilliant young lawyer. 
Many Dominicans rallied around him. In 
June, 1960, when Trujillo's security police 
arrested Tavares' wife, two sisters-in-law, 
and five other organizers, many more persons 
rallied to his movement. 
ORDERS SISTERS EXECUTED 
On November 15, 1960, Trujillo ordered 
three sisters executed without trial. They 
were Minerva Mirabel de Tavares, Maria 
Teresa Mirabal de Guzman, and Patria Mira-
bel de Gonzalez, wife of Pedro Gonzalez-
Crus. 
This Trujillo brutality added to the indig-
nation of the people and enabled Tavares to 
build a broad basis of support for his move-
ment, which was not necessarily Communist 
at the outset. 
It was considered liberal, democratic, and 
patriotic and Tavares was the single most 
popular figure of the group. Many of the 
original affiliates left the movement because 
of its swing toward Castro communism, as 
enunciated in statements by Tavares pub-
lished ,in the clandestine paper Claridad in a, 
July 26, 1962, special edition. 
Although both the 14th of June movement 
and the Partido Socialista Popular publicly 
ordered its partisans to abstain from voting 
in the December, 1962, elections [so as not to 
taint /3osch's candidacy], the rank and file 
were secretly ordered to vote for Bosch. 
Still to cover a secret alliance with Bosch, 
Tavares on June 14, 1963, delivered a Com-
munist-line speech in which he attacked the 
pro-U.S. policy of Bosch. Three months 
later Bosch was overthrown and Ta-
vares denounced the destruction of con-
stitutional rule 
After Tavares was killed by the army, the 
14th of June formed a united front with the 
other CoMmunist parties. Some of the 
guerrillas had been captured and were jailed. 
Although the party gave permission to the 
imprisoned guerrillas to accept the alterna-
tive of voluntary exile instead of trial, 
Leandro Guzman, now the top 14th of June 
leader after the death of his brother-in-law, 
refused and remained in jail.

Sirtro DOMINGO, DOM/NICAN REPUBLIC.?
Fidel Castro had plans to be 'Welcomed 
here as a conquering hero of a second Cuba 
on June 14, it was Martial today. Those 
plans have been dashed, hut the Communist 
clan er remains. 
Te 14th of June mover/lent, which has the 
predominant Communist command of Col. 
Francisco A. Caamano's forces, had planned 
to have Castro present to help them celebrate 
another victory for the Master planners of 
Moscow and Peking. 
Castro' was to arrive on June 10, by which 
time the 14th of June `movement (known 
here as the A.P.C.J.) hoped to be ruling the 
country. They were going to dump both 
Caamano and ex-President Juan Bosch. 
TWENTY IN ACTIVE ROLES 
Twenty of the top leaders of the 14th of 
June movement played active roles in the 
near takeover, a month ago. All of them 
were trained in the Soviet 'Onion, Red China, 
and Cuba. One of' them, Juan Miguel Ro-
man-Diaz, was killed 'flit week in a corn-
-Majado assault on the presidential palace. 
Another casualty in the same attack and 
from the same party was Rafael Mejia-Llu-
berea, who was gravely wounded. 
he 14th of Tune movement has what the 
=cabers call its "Joan or Arc:" She is Emma 
Tavares-Justo 25, sliter of Manuel Tavares-
Just?, who led domniuriist guerrillas into 
the hills in November 1963 to fight "for the 
return of constitutional governnient." Ta-
vares was killed' in a battle with the army. 
TO 'MARX AN1,11VEISAICT 
The Communist plans called for a great 
rally on the 14th 'of June to commemorate 
the sixth anniversary of the Castro-mounted 
invasion that was dispatched from Cuba to 
overthrow the late dictator, Rafael Leonidas 
It was on June 14, 1059, that Castro au-
thtrized a Venezuelan DC -3 aircraft to take 
oft from Cuba for La Constanza, a mountain 
reiort north of here, with Capt. Enrique 
Moya, a Dominican exile who fought beside 
him in the Sierra Maestra, as commander of 
the expeditionary force. 
Haul Castro dispatched reinforcements by 
sea to land at beaches on the Dominican 
north coast. Those beaches were Playa 
galmon; and Este*. Hondo. 
HP *astorr 
Trujillo crushed the invasion, using his 
cUnpesino [peasant] militia machetemen

Bosch. 
In March and April this year, the 14th of 
June brought back into the country more 
than 40 of its partisans who had undergone 
activist and guerrilla training in Red China 
and Cuba. 
The movement began to take a distinct 
three-way split. There was a pro-Chinese 
faction led by Fidel? Despradel-Roque, son 
of Trujillo's ex-foreign minister Arturo De-
spradel. There was a PSP oriented group 
which advocated following the Soviet line. 
And there was a group that desired to main-
tain the Socialist party. 
The 14th of June movement gained as-
cendancy in the so-called "constitutionalist 
revolt" on the night of April 25-26.. Emma 
Tavares-Justo appeared April 25 on televi-
sion and radio inciting the people to rise to 
support constitutional rule. Then she took 
over one of the Communist commands. 
What originally had begun as an old-
fashioned Latin American military coup by 
disgruntled officers, who were purged, and 
whose excesses of corruption and other privi-
leges were whittled down by Donald J. Reid-
Cabral, who they deposed as president on the 
morning of April 25, quickly became the 
"constitutionalist revolt." 
They installed Jose Rafael Molina-Urena, 
speaker of the dissolved house, as "constitu-
tional president," while the three Commu-
nist parties, together with the Communist-
infiltrated Partido Revolucionario Social 
Cristiano [PR,SC or Christian Social Revolu-
tionary party], demanded arms.

SANTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, 
May 26.?Communist rebels began digging 
trenches today in their stronghold of Ciudad 
Neuva, in downtown Santo Domingo for a 
last ditch stand against loyalist farces as 650 
U.S. marines were shipped home. 
The marines, who were the first here, were 
airlifted by helicopter to the carrier Boxer. 
This withdrawal should raise no hopes 
among parents and relatives that the 32,000 
servicemen who are still here will be leav-
ing soon. 
ACTS AFTER PARLEY 
COL Francisco A. Caamano ordered the 
trenches dug after he had conferred for 
4 hours yesterday with McGeorge Bundy, 
special assistant to President Johnson; Un-
der Secretary of Defense Cyrus R. Vance; 
Jose Antonio Mora, Secretary General of the 
Organization of American States and Dr. 
Jaime Benitez, chancellor of the University 
of Puerto Rico. 
Benitez, who was brought here by Bundy 
as an adviser, is an intimate friend of ex-
President Juan Bosch. 
IN THROUGH WINDOW 
At a press conference, Caamano praised 
Bundy and said with amusement that he had 
met with him and other U.S. officials in the 
conservatory of music on Avenida George 
Washington. This is in a virtual no man's 
land. 
"We had thought that the Americans would 
reconnoiter and secure the meeting place," 
Caamano said. "And the Americans thought 
that we would do that. Nobody had a key so 
we had to break a window to get in." 
Caamano said that Bundy sought the meet-
ing because he wanted to take his views back 
to Washington with him today to report to 
President Johnson. He said the talks were 
satisfactory. Vance remained behind for 
further meetings.

COMMUNISTS HAD ROLES OF LEADERS PROM 
START DV DOMINICAN REVOLT, HERO 
CHARGES 
(By Jules Dubois) 
SANTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, June 
13.?The myth has been shattered that the 
Communists jumped on the bandwagon and 
took over after a revolt erupted here last 
April 24. At least a dozen Reds were identi-
fied_ in leadership roles from the start. 
This has, been documented in an interview 
with Col. Manuel Demradel, commander of 
the 16th century Ozama fortress the day the 
revolt began and hero of its siege before the 
rebels captured it at noon April 30. 
- 
WALL IS BREACHED - 
Despra,del lost the fort when a 75-mm. gun 
fired from a French tank which rebel Col. 
Francisco A. Caamano had captured from the 
troops of Brig. Gen. Elias Wessin y Wessin 
breached the wall of the fortress and allowed 
the rebel militia to pour into the courtyard 
and subdue the demoralized, starved 
defenders. 
De_spradel has been recovering from wounds 
at the San Isidro air base hospital. Per-
mission for the interview was obtained from 
Commodore Francisco J. Rivera-Caminero, 
secretary of the armed forces. Colonel 
Despradel's story follows: 
"I know that on the night of April 24-25, 
Caamano was with Dr. Daniel Ozuna-
Hernandez, a known international Commu-
nist. My police reported to me that they 
saw Caamano driving his car with his uncle, 
Capt. Deno Suero, seated beside him. In the 
rear seat behind Caarnano was Ozuna. 
FREED BY CAAMANO 
"Next to Ozuna was ex-Lt. Ool. Jorge Ger-
ardo Marte-Hernandez of the police farce. 
Selene was one of the common criminals 
freed from La Victoria prison by order of 
Caamano. Marie had been sentenced to 6

years imprisonment for homicide by a court-
martial on March 10, 1964, and Stripped of 
his rank. 
"My patrols on El Conde, which totaled 18, 
2 for each of the 9 street corners, were 
reduced to 8 when 10 of them defected. 
Of the loyal eight, all reported to me that 
Ozuna had a map on his lap and they could 
hear him as the car was halted at street 
corners tell Caarnano where to emplace .50 
and .30 caliber machine guns and where 
barricades should be erected. 
"On the morning of April 25 Oaamano left 
the American embassy, which he had visited 
while Ozuna remained in the car, and both 
were recognized by Maj. Jose Lopez-Benitz of 
the national police force. Caamano told 
Lopez: 'I have taken the government and I 
am going to be the president. Tell Despradel 
that.'" ?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? 
"I replied bluntly that all those circum-
stances mentioned by him made it impera-
tive that I remain loyal to my brother as 
chief of police and loyal to my command be-
cause I knew for a fact that since April 24 
he had been with Ozuna, an internationally 
known Communist, that I am anti-Commu-
nist and moreover, by order of Colonel Ca-
amano, who calls me 'compadre' (blood 
brother) the supposed great and good friend, 
my house has been sacked and destroyed and 
my wife and children were being hunted 
down as hostages to force me to surrender the 
fortress." 
DECLINED TO SURRENDER 
"They didn't stop there, but Ca,amano, 
Col. Hernandez Ramirez and Lt. Claudio 
Caamano-Grullon, a cousin of the rebel chief, 
called me on different occasions from Tuesday 
on to surrender the fort. Whenever, they 
called, I gave them the same answer: I will 
not surrender the fort to a man who had as-
sociated with the Communists from the 
start.'"

A'S START?A COOP 
The story of the Dominican revolt, as told 
by U.S. officials, begins as far back as 1963, 
soon after the former Dominican President, 
Juan Bosch, was overthrown by a coup. 
After that coup, the Fourteenth of June 
group and the Dominican Popular Movement 
launched an open campaign of guerrilla war-
fare in the country's hinterland. Some 
Dominicans known to have received training 
In Castro's Cuba took part in that campaign. 
After the guerrilla campaign failed, the 
bulk of the captured rebels were deported, 
in May 1964, and most of them became exiles 
in France. From France, many traveled to 
Communist countries, including Cuba and 
Red China. 
Beginning late in 1964, the exiled APCJ 
and MPD leaders began to infiltrate back 
into the Dominican Republic, some secretly. 
They rejoined their political groups and be-
gan to prepare them to take advantage of 
any opportunity that presented itself. The 
opportunity came on April 24, when a small 
group of Dominican Army officers attempted 
to overthrow the Government of President 
Donald Reid Cabral. 
U.S. officials say that the officers' revolt 
was inspired by the DOITHIliCall Revolutionary 
Party (PRD), the party of former President 
Bosch. 
Communists, however, moved into it quick-
ly. Within an hour or two after the first 
move in the revolt, members of the Castorite 
14th of June movement were busy in the 
streets of Santo Domingo calling on the peo-
ple to come out and demonstrate for Bosch.

Iterovide the stabilizing element need,cd? , 
'forced' to make a sharp increase in aid. 
' Another point being made is that there is 
no room for a "dreamer" at the head of any 
new government. When Juan Bosch was 
President, people got the idea that there 
was pie in the sky, when actually the out-
look without sizable U.S. help would seem to 
be hopeless. 
A firm conclusion is that U.S. military 
intervention was unavoidable if slaughter of 
foreigners was to be prevented. It is re-
garded as a good thing that U.S. power was 
adequate to deal with heavily armed, Com-
munist-organized mobs. If action had not 
been fast and in force, loss of life would have 
been much heavier, and a takeover by Reds 
an accomplished fact. 
With slower action, experts say, there read-
ily could have been another Castro-type base 
for Reds in the Caribbean. 
When U.S. troops had been on Dominican 
soil 5 days, President Johnson, on May 3, 
officially stated that the role of those troops 
was to prevent a Communist takeover as 
well as to save lives. In a speech, Mr. John-
son said: 
, "The American nations cannot, must not, 
and will not permit the establishment of an-
other Communist Government in the West-
ern Hemisphere." 
The President with those words reaffirmed 
U.S. policy justifying intervention in Com-
munist revolutions anywhere in Latin 
America the United States chooses to move. 
That policy was not in effect in January 1959, 
When Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba. 
FOR U.S. TROOPS, NO ENEMIES 
The performance of U.S. military services 
in Santo Domingo was a model of restraint. 
Marines of the Second Division and soldiers 
of the 82d Airborne Division have not been 
permitted to shoot unless shot at first. On 
the night of May 4, troops were ordered to 
end combat patrols outside their lines. This 
was considered a risky restraint in the midst 
of heavily armed guerrillas. Idea was to keep 
I.T.S. troops from appearing aggressive. 
; Rebels have not been referred to as the 
enemy. An airborne division spokesman, to 
avoid using the word enemy, even went so far 
as to describe snipers who machinegunned 
U.S, paratroopers as people who are anti-
82c1 Division. 
, Americans have big guns and tanks but 
have net been. permitted to use them. 
Troops were cautioned, also, to avoid a nor-
mal practice of blowing up houses filled with 
snipers. ,Officere said that marines and para-
troopers were limited to hand-held weapons 
seri the fighting. 
A few rounds from 106-millimeter recoil-
less rifles and from antitank bazookas were 
fired against boats that sailed into the mouth 
of the Ozarna River carrying snipers. Each 
of the boats was knocked out, one a large 
Wessel apparently filled with ammunition for 
the rebels. The ships had come presumably 
from Cuba. 
By May 8, the number of American service-
men here, either ashore or afloat, was more 
than 30,000. The Army had 14,345 para-
roopers , on the island; the Marine Corps, 
,924; the Navy, 8,314, and the Air Force, 626. 
any Will be iricorTorated into, anT Peace-
keeping force set up by the Organization of 
American States. Others will be replaced by 
Latin-American troops. 
U.S. DEATH TOLL 
Casualties among U.S. forces between April 
28, when first marines came ashore, and May 
6 included 13 dead, more than 60 wounded. 
That toll was mounting despite a so-called 
firm cease-fire. On May 6, four marines were 
killed when their patrol made a wrong turn 
into the rebel-held zone of Santo Domingo. 
Rebel machineguns cut them down without 
warning. 
Refusal of the rebels to observe the cease-
fire was taken as new evidence of Commu-
nists' taking over what started out as a pann-
ier revolt against the military junta that had 
been in power. 
A semblance of order was restored here 
only after U.S. troops established an im-
penetrable cordon around rebel-held terri-
tory in the heart of downstown Santo 
Domingo. In effect, American servicemen 
bottled up the rebels. 
Until that cordon, was established, danger 
was great that the capital would fall to the 
insurgents. More than 1,000 citizens lay 
dead in the streets. Rebels had broken the 
back of Government; resistance and captured 
the police stronghold of La Fortaleza Ozana 
after a 4-day siege. Large quantities of guns 
and ammunitiOn were captured. 
When the truce was signed, rebels held an 
area of about 2 square miles in the teeming 
heart of this city of 400,000. U.S. marines 
had carved out and are holding an interna-
tional refugee zone to the west of the rebels, 
and are linked by a 3-nille corridor to U.S. 
paratroopers to the east of the rebels and at 
San Isidro Air Base. 
RICE: IN THE CORRIDOR 
This 3-mile corridor is a busy place now. 
A large part of it includes the gay quarters 
of the town, and as long as American soldiers 
stay clear of diehard rebels they do not seem 
to be unwelcome to Dominicans. Stores are 
open, and the troops are making purchases 
and many are making friends. 
Oh an average day, at 10 points along the 
"armed corridor," U.S. troops handed out 
20 tons of rice to civilians?all corners, no 
questions asked--as well as tons of beans and 
powdered milk. 
In U.S.-held areas, Dominicans seem to 
respond warmly to the idea that U.S. civil-
ians, as well as they, are stopped at check-
points for identification. 
American troops are trying to overcome 
initial fear and resentment. They are seek-
ing to leave a good impression with local 
citizens. 
At first there was fear the Americans would 
charge into the city to wipe out the rebels. 
In that case, thousands upon thousands 
could have been slaughtered. 
Instead, U.S. troops went swiftly about the 
job of evacuating more than 1,000 foreign 
civilians, including 2,694 Americans and 
1,373 from 41 other nations. Anyone who 
wanted to leave got a hand from the United 
States,. 
RELIEF: WILL IT BE REAL? 
American officers have been waiting for 
the first Latin American military contin-
gents to start showing up in force, after an 
OAS vote of May 6 to pitch in with truce-
keeping chores. 
There was skepticism, however, about any 
idea that the United States would be able 
to cut back in its own commitment substan-
tially, in any case. 
Some Latin American states voted against 
the peacekeeping idea altogether, and some 
big countries?Mexico, for one?indicated 
they 'wouldn't send any troops. Intense 
Jealousies and rivalries furlong Latin Ameri-
cans raised further doubts in the minds of 
some US. officials, about the ability of many 
OAS members to Pull their weight. For now,

States that will continue to bear the bur-
den?MiIitary as well as economic?of keep-
ing the colintry from going down the drain. 
What Latin American peacekeepers will 
find is a situation that U.S. diplomats de-
scribe as "an unholy mess." 
The republic is drifting without a leader?
and two sides claiming power. 
The United States is officially neutral but 
has granted a sort of "working recognition" 
to a military junta backed by Brig. Gen. 
Elias Wessin y Wessin. It was General Wes-
sin y Wessin who kept the rebels from power 
until U.S. forces arrived. 
Rebels are led by Col. Francisco Caamafio 
DO?, who was inaugurated as "provisional 
President" by his supporters on May 4. Be-
hind Colonel Cos/natio and 400 other mili-
tary rebels are between 10,000 and 20,000 
armed civilians who now appear to be under 
the control of foreign-trained Communists, 
Intent on keeping the revolt going at any 
cest. 
Colonel Caamafio, although a 'U.S.-trained 
Career officer, does not stand high with the 
United States. He Is not known to be a 
Communist, but 'U.S. officials say Caamafio 
"seems to be Moving closer to the Commu-
nists." One of his chief advisers is Commu-
nist leader Fidelio Despradel, a Castroite. 
17.S. officials here report that Caamafio 
conferred with Despradel and other Red lead-
ers who asked for jobs in his government if 
he Won power, and that he assure their es-
cape from the country if he lost. Caamafio 
was said to have agreed to this in return 
for Red backing. 
CONTINUING THREAT 
Danger of a Communist takeover still ex-
ists. American officials here say they have 
no doubt of that. The whole rebellion is 
said to fit into a blueprint for subversion 
that was drawn Up-in Havana last November 
at a secret meeting of 22 Latin American 
Communist parties. 
As U.S. officials reconstruct the revolution 
here, the Castro-Communist influence stands 
out in a striking way. 
When 18 rebels took over the government 
television station on April 24, to start things, 
the two announcers who were used were 
chosen because they were easily recognized 
as Communists. 
The whole Communist organization here 
was geared to move on short notice, and the 
three main Red groups, previously split, 
United to move together. 
ZnoVat CommMists stood on trucks and 
passed out guns and ammunition to any 
Dominicans who wanted them. At the Na-
tional Palace, 15 well-known Communist 
leaders were deliberately conspicuous in the 
way they gave orders to rebel elements. On 
television, in those first days, Reds wore 
Castro-type fatigue caps to give a Castro 
flavor to the revolt. 
American officials believe the Reds did all 
this to make the point that this was "their 
revolution." 
. WHAT tr /TED STATES WANTS 
Trouble with the Communists, piled on 
top of the Country's natural problems, adds 
up to a formidable chore for the United States 
In the period ahead. Getting the OAS to 
she peacekeeping tasks?even in token 
form?is the first step toward a solution. 
What the United States would like to see, be-
yond a durable Armed truce, is a political 
compromise that would bring a moderate 
provisional regime to power until free elec-
tions can be held?preferably under OAS 
auspices. 
The hig U.S. problem is to find a politician 
ca able of running the Dominican Republic 
Witb ?Ei.' Arm hand?even an iron hand, if 
14ClesCall-allff enable the United States to 
withdraw its troops soon. 
Assizrance of any lasting political settle-
ment is regarded as dim. Fighting, it is 
felt, has Solved nothing, merely deepened old 
resentments. 
Now, with Reds committed to action, 
there's prospect of prolonged guerrilla-style 
war in the countryside. 
U.S. occupation of the Dominican Repub-
lic once before was undertaken with hopes 
of getting out quickly. That occupation, 
started in 1916, lasted for 8 years. 
Once again, the United States is finding 
that getting in is a lot easier than getting 
out. 
[From U.S. News & World Report, 
May 17, 1965] 
WHO WH.L. RULE Now IN DOMINICAN 
REPUBLIC? 
(Next big job: finding the man who can 
put the Dominican Republic back together 
again and still keep Communists at bay. 
United States wants no port of present rebel 
leader or former President Juan Bosch. 
Both have been tainted by the Reds.) 
SANTO Dommao.?American offlicals here 
are convinced beyond any possible doubt 
that the man who rose to the top of the 
Dominican rebellion?Col. Francisco Caam-
afio Defio?is only a front for the real con-
spirators, the Communists behind his move-
ment. 
Colonel Caamafio was sworn in by the 
rebels as "provisional President" of the 
Dominican Republic on May 4. 
To reach that point, according to evidence 
in U.S. hands, the colonel was forced to 
make a marriage of convenience with the 
Conimuntsts. And now an old-line Commu-
nist, Fidelio Despradel Rogues, is his key 
adviser. 
PROMISE TO REDS 
This, say 'U.S. investigators, is what hap-
pened: 
Early in the second week of the rebellion, 
Caamafio met with half a dozen of the top 
Communist leaders in Santo Domingo. They 
were men who represented the three Com-
munist parties on this island?followers of 
the Chinese Reds, the Kremlin Communists, 
and Fidel Castro's Cubans. 
Caamafio mode a deal: 
If the revolution succeeds, the Commu-
nists will have key positions in his Govern-
ment. 
If the revolution fails, Caamafio has agreed 
to insist that the Organization of American 
States guarantee safe passage for the Bed 
leaders so they can get out of the country. 
Despite Caamafio's claims and activities, 
the United State says there is no effective 
government in the Dominican Republic. 
Americans here are determined, as one puts 
it, "to help the Dominicans find a democrat-
ic solution to their problems." But finding 
it is going to be difficult, indeed. 
The United States is opposed to accepting 
either Caomafio or former President Juan 
Bosch as the political leader of this troubled 
country. While neither is considered a Com-
munist, each owes big political debts to the 
Reds. Of Bosch, one American said, "He 
has done things that favored the Commu-
nists." 
Thoughtful Dominicans not involved in the 
current disorder are casting about now for 
a man who can lead their nation back to 
order. 
Former President Joaquin Balaguer, pres-
ently in exile in New York, is sometimes 
mentioned as a possibility. He has been 
keeping his political image alive here through 
taped broadcasts for a year or more. He is 
believed to retain a good deal of popularity. 
Gen, Antonio Imbert, one of the two sur-
viving members of the group that assassi-
nated former dictator Rafael Trujillo, also is

Dominican Republic, the 
this conclusion: The real 
villain is dictator Trujillo, even though he 
is 4 years dead. Every line you follow seems 
to lead, in the end, to the old dictator. Under 
Trujillo, graft became a privilege of the gen-
erals. One reason for the downfall of Presi-
dent Donald Reid Cabral is that he tried to 
take this privilege away. He got rid of 
two generals and fired the powerful chief of 
the national, police. But it was enemies 
within the armed forces who toppled him 
from office. 
Among the things Reid Cabral wanted to 
eliminate was a contracts racket operated 
by top military men. Until Reid Cabral took 
office, military contracting officers had a free 
hand in buying supplies from abroad. The 
standard practice was to buy only from sales-
men who would give the contracting officer a 
kickback of 10 or 12 percent. 
This is but one example of the kind of 
widespread corruption that has riddled the 
country in recent years. The Dominican Re-
public had no foreign debts at the time 
Trujillo was assassinated. Four years later, 
its debts totaled almost half a billion dollars. 
As President, Reid Cabral ended the con-
tracts racket, but the fact he did so helped 
bring him down. 
SON OF "THE BUTCHER" 
The Trujillo era even casts a shadow 
over the new rebel leader, Colonel Caamafio. 
He is the son of the late Gen. Fausto 
Caamafio, known to Dominicans as El Car-
nicero?"The Butcher"?in the days of Tru-
jillo. Like most professional Army men in 
the Dominican Republic, Colonel? Caamafio 
has a Trujillo background?one he has tried 
to obscure?and he has powerful enemies. 
You don't have to be on this island long 
to sense the conflicts and bitterness that 
permeate the place. 
These conflicts ousted Bosch in 1963. They 
brought the downfall of Reid Cabral at the 
start of the current rebellion, even before the 
Communist elements came to the surface. 
They persist now, leaving many powerful Do-
minicans hating each other. 
That is why it will be a long, long time 
before a stable government can be set up to 
guide this troubled country.

CARIBBEAN RIDDLE: How To LET Go 
SANTO DOMING0.?Communists remain a 
very real threat to the Dominican Republic, 
4 weeks after the U.S. Marines moved in to 
block a Red takeover here. 
Known Communists are commanding an 
estimated 80 to 90 percent of the rebel posts, 
even though they are not always the men 
who appear publicly to be in charge. 
There is some danger?presently calculated 
as slight?that the Communists will move 
out into the countryside and try to spread 
the revolt, even if it is choked off here in 
the capital. 
What heightens the Communists' oppor-
tunities for troublemaking is the almost im-
possible job of putting together a broad-
based coalition government. Several times 
In recent days negotiators have been on the 
brink of getting a cabinet organized, only to 
have everything collapse because of prema-
ture publicity. 
Under the circumstances, it is clear now 
that it probably will be a long time before 
the bulk of the 30,000 U.S. troops on the 
scene can go home. 
U.S. officials were heartened by the decision 
of Brazil on May 21 to send a substantial 
force?probably as many as 1,250 men?to 
join a Latin American peacekeeping mission 
here. By that date, only token forces were

Now, with all the bloodshed and chaos in 
Santo Domingo, some Dominicans, rich and

an a iron hand.

restathants are reopening. The aromas of 
strong, black coffee and Dominican rum are 
in the air again. 
An 'outdoor market began operating before 
the end of - the first week of the revolution. 
It has become a flourishing center of street 
stalls.. For sale are fresh vegetables, fruit, 
freshly butchered lambs or goats, hanging 
on dirty boards hi the hot sun, attracting 
buzzing swarms of flies. 
On the street alongside the market, young 
Dominicans hawk American cigarettes?by 
the carton. 
Inside the rebel zone, few stores are open. 
Most are boarded. up. There has been loot-
ing. Walk down the palm-lined streets, and 
you see stores that have been stripped of 
their goods. 
In the international zone, Dominican police 
are back at work, directing traffic, guarding 
buildings against looters. 
When the civil war erupted, schools were 
closed. In the third week of the revolution, 
a few primary schools reopened in the safety 
zone. But schools in the rebel area still are 
closed. Children cluster around rebel sen-
tries on the street corners. 
Water and electricity again are usually 
available in both zones. But not always.-
Electric power was shut off for several hours 
on May 16, for example. 
The main post office Is in the rebel zone. 
But a Substitute main office was set up in 
the. fairgrounds, Inside the international 
zone, and mail service?including postal 
money orders?has been carried on with re-
markably efficiency. 
Throughout the revolution, hundreds of 
government employees has been hard at 
work. From the beginning, the Ministry 
of Public Welfare has been helping to dis-
tribute food, even inside the rebel zone. 
Employees of the Ministry of Public Health 
have tolled to clean up the city, hoping to 
avert an epidemic. 
MEETING THE PAYROLLS 
The United States gave the beleaguered 
city's shaky economy a lift by lending $750,000 
to the Ministry of Finance to meet overdue 
parolls. People living in the rebel zone can 
go through U.S. military checkpoints to col-
lect their back pay. 
In the ? rebel zone, grocery stores serve as 
banks. With most other stores closed, gro-
cers were authorized by rebel leaders to cash 
government checks. The Dominican junta 
announced on the radio that It would guar-
antee payment of the checks. 
As weeks of tension and terror go on, some 
people work, some fight?and some just seem 
to sit and wait for the nightmare to end.

Yet, out of it all, these things are being 
counted as accomplishments. 
A second "Cuba" in the Caribbean has 
been checked. Slaughter among the thou-
sands of American and foreign residents of 
the island was avoided. The Organization of 
American States, for the first time in its 
history, Was prodded into taking on the role 
of armed policeman. 
Brazil, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa

for the inter-American force under the OAS 
banner. V.S. troops make up the bulk of 
that force, but a Brazilian general commands 
A WARNING TO "CASTROS" 
? 
As a result of the Dominican precedent, 
Castro-type leaders all through Latin 
America are on notice that they can face 
military intervention if they attempt a take-
over. ? ' 
As for this island republic: It is clear that 
outside military forces, including U.S. troops, 
will be here for a long time. The alternative 
Is revival of fighting between heavily armed 
groups all over the country. 
A major task of rebuilding the Dominican 
economy lies ahead. 
Whoever leads a new government will be 
under much pressure to redistribute land. 
During the 31 years of Trujillo dictatorship, 
the Trujillo family gained control of 35 per-
cent of the arable land and 65 percent of the 
sugar production, which is the mainstay of 
the economy. 
The Trujillo holdings now are in the 
hands of the goverriment, but no move has 
been made to put the land into individual 
hands. In any event, a sugar economy no 
longer Can support the island's 3.5 million 
people. There will have to be a basic change 
in agricultural production, probably financed 
and directed by farm specialists from the 
United States. 
Mon COST OF ARkY 
Another essential is to cut down on the 
cost of the Dominican military establish-
ment. The government has been spending 
40 percent of its income to support the 
anted forces. Officers have struggled to ob-
tain poets which, foreign diplomats say, have 
proved immensely profitable to some in graft 
and favors. 
The-problems that lie ahead are compli-
cated by the poverty and illiteracy of the Do-
minican people. About 70 percent cannot 
read or write. Per capita income of $200 a 
year comparee with $2,650 in the United 
States. 
Since Trujillo's assassination in 1961, the 
United States has poured economic aid into 
the island. Despite this, the economy is in 
dire shape. Oppreasive taxes and unrealistic 
wage rates, along With the decline in world 
sugar prices, have Made sugar plantations 
uneconomic. 
The country is a mixture of races. Offi-
cial estimate is that 15 percent of the Do-
minicans are white, 15 percent Negro, and 70 
percent of mixed blood. Political views of 
these groups often conflict. 
Politically, traditions are based on the 
legacy' of hatred and violence left by Tru-
jillo. All of this compounds the political 
confusion. Says one 'U.S. official: 
"There is a very deeP-seated division 
among the leaders here. There is almost 
a polarization of opposing opinions. Our 
task is to find political figure's and forces that 
can pull together the /MSS of the people in 
the Middle ground, those who would reject 
either communism or Trujilloism." 
an Interview On May. 28, Gen. Antonio 
Trabert Baire'rai told" me that the junta he 
heads will make no oonceasions to the reb-
els and Will not accept any solution "im-
posed from outside." That's an example of 
what mediators are up against. 
One hot dispute involves the rebels' in-
sistence upon.a constitution tailored to their 
demands. 
Among other points of disagreement: How 
to deal with known Communists who have 
had key roles in the civil war. How to dis-
arm the groups and ordinary citizens who 
were issued weapons?or armed themselves?
when the rebellion erupted. How to enforce 
guarantees against vengeance. 
YEARS FOR REBUILDING 
Much remains to be done before the pres-
ent crisis is ended. Then comes the big job 
of rebuilding the economy?a job which 
could take years, with the United States pro-
viding much of the technical aid and most 
of the money. 
[From U.S. News & World Report, July 19, 
1965] 
U.S. AID WHILE THE BULLETS FLY?THE REAL 
DOMINICAN STORY 
(If you are wondering what's really go-
ing on in the revolt-torn Dominican Re-
public?it is the sporadic gunfire, political 
jockeying, the presence of United States and 
other foreign soldiers that make headlines. 
But the- deeper story is a massive under-
taking by the United States to save the 
country from itself. U.S. aid officials rushed 
in with the troops. Mission: emergency re-
lief to stave off collapse, then long-range 
development to remake the place. That 
started almost the moment the revolution 
broke. So far, $41 million in U.S. aid has 
gone in. Millions more are on the way. 
In charge is Alexander Finer, a 'U.S. expert 
sent in from Bolivia after earlier experience 
in Puerto Rico's Operation Bootstrap. Fol-
lowing is the story of U.S rescue operations 
In the Dominican Republic in Mr. Firfer's 
own words, as told to Howard Handleman 
of the staff of U.S. News & World Report.) 
SANTO Dommoo.?When this thing broke 
in April, we were faced with a problem that 
can be compared with the problem of getting 
an automobile moving. An automobile has 
three gears. We had three stages to go 
through. 
Let's take our three gears in order. 
The first, low gear, consisted basically of 
doing everything we could to make sure the 
revolution didn't break up the channels of 
distribution?or the functioning of the econ-
omy. 
We had to do that to make sure that peo-
ple had enough to eat. So we started with 
the, program to distribute food. We had to 
make sure that if Dominicans were going to 
fight each other, they would be fighting 
about the real issues that were bothering 
them?not get pulled into the fight because 
somebody's baby was hungry. 
The easiest way to measure what this oper-
ation did is to point out that, before the 
revolution, the food program here was feed-
ing about 7 percent of the people of the 
country. As we got into stage one?our low 
gear?we raised that to 17 percent of the peo-
ple. That is an extremely high figure. 
The 7 percent was high. It points up the 
fact that our country recognized, even be-
fore this revolution, that the Dominican Re-
public was coming out of a period of dicta-
torship and was going through substantial 
change in the social structure, and therefore 
needed help to feed its people. 
With the revolution, the need for food aid 
increased enormously. Let me give an exam-
ple: 
In the town of Monte Cristi, a liter of 
peanut oil cost 70 cents before the revolu-
tion. Peanut oil is essential in Dominican 
cooking. The price started climbing the 
minute the revolution broke out. It went 
all the way up to $2.60. The moment we 
announced that we were sending peanut oil 
into Monte Grist!, the price dropped back 
to 90 cents a liter. 
Now, roughly, that's what this first-gear 
operation did. It kept tempers down in this 
20527 
tropical climate, where tempers can flare 
easily.
T other part of this operation was meet-
ing the Government payroll. 
So gear one consisted of emergency steps 
to keep the economy moving, so that ex-
traneous issues didn't get mixed up with 
the real political differences they were fight-
ing about. We wanted them to concentrate 
on their real differences?and hope that 
somehow these can be resolved. 
To meet Government payrolls, we gave 
about $11 million?and another $10 million 
or so is being paid out in the current 
distribution. The money goes to pay all 
Government employees?including the mili-
tary. 
As gear 1 got going full speed, we were 
able to start thinking about gear 2. 
This gear 2 consists of a series of prob-
lems. How can you get the economy moving 
once more? How can you avoid a plain dole, 
where people get American money but are 
not on their jobs? Is there some way to get 
some works projects going? 
Over all, is there some way you can get the 
economy running enough so that you are at 
least getting something for the American 
dollars you spend? 
As the first moves in gear 2, we tried 
to get a series of nubile works projects going. 
Many of these had been sidetracked by the 
revolution. 
The aid mission before us had been here 
only a year. Aid had been stopped for 11 
months after Juan Bosch was overthrown, 
and a whole new aid team had to be formed. 
Well, it normally takes about a year to gear 
up an aid program and begin to show results. 
Heaven knows how long it's going to take 
us now. We've got orders to do it in much 
less time than a year. But we have one ad-
vantage. A lot of projects were left hanging. 
We were able to review these projects, and 
also to take a look at a number of public 
works projects. 
Let me give you an example: 
There is a big pipeline coming in from the 
river near Heine that is supposed to bring 
water to Santo Domingo. The water supply 
here has been a constant source of irritation. 
The project was held up by routine nego-
tiations. We said, "Well, let's get through 
all this. If we're going to spend money, let's 
spend it on something useful. We'll put 
up the money for the pipeline, and there 
won't have to be any more negotiating about 
it." So, at this moment, we've got a contract 
with an American construction firm to build 
the three major supply lines for this water. 
That will bring water to the city. This will 
cost about $2 million. 
Another project, which was easy to get 
started, is for irrigation. This country has 
a substantial supply of water. It has many 
dikes for irrigation. 
A lot of these dikes have not been main-
tained, partly because, as far back as last 
November, it looked like the country was 
going to fall apart economically. I've run 
across some people, little people, who haven't 
been paid since as far back as November. 
Well, these irrigation canals could be 
cleaned easily. What we did was bring in 
another American company, and said, "Go 
take a look at the canals, and let's see what 
we can do." Well, we put $400,000 into this. 
Both these contracts were signed the other 
day in Washington?June 30, to be exact. 
And the engineers are down there now, work-
ing out final details before work starts. 
The main point in gear 2 is to get people 
working. You have to have these works 
projects to keep people working and eating 
during the time it takes you to plan develop-
ment projects and get them going. 
Gear 2 was put together in about 2 
weeks' planning. We kept going to the tech-
nicians, beating them over the head. We 
made some of them try to justify old ideas. 
We made them pull old papers out of un-

So we must have farm-to-market roads. 
BRIDGES THAT STOP IN MIDSTREAM 
The problem varies tremendously in 
country. Some places have good roads. 
there are places which I have seen wh 
bridges don't go all the way across riv 
There are roads in the mountains which 
traveled where, frankly, I had my fin

OK, let's get into the third priority?e 
cation. Some figures I have on educat 
are pretty shocking. Thirty percent of 
kids in this country apparently don't go 
school. And about 70 percent of the tea 
era don't have more than a seventh-
eighth-grade education. - 
Well, you can't do very much educati 
with that kind of thing, so we are thinki 
af making education priority No. 3. We w 
ioncentrate first on agricultural educati 
Actually, some of these children may e 
up in a Government bureaucracy. Ma 
OK, too. It would be useful to have peop 
rith better training than some of those wh 
row work in some of these agricultur 
I astitutions. 
Priority four is an interesting one. For 
v bile, we didn't think it was going to he 
priority at all. It's industrial developmen 
We weren't quite sure that the industri 
dsvelopment in this country had gotten 
Cie stage where you sould say, "OK, let's ai 
gat out behind industry, and let's try t 
it aloe something go." But the more we'v 
eKainined the Dominican situation, and th 
IT ore we talk to Dominican entrepreneur 
the more we've run into a buccaneer spit 
that is really encouraging. 
For example, the people of Monte Grist 
have a development association. They al 
ready have made a deal with some compan 
s in Florida to sell melons and tomatoes tha 
s they aren't even growing yet. But the 
e khow they can grow them and satisfy th 
Funds market. 
We find many people with ideas. So many 
. in fact, that we are bringing in a man, Undei 
contract, to take a look at a number of ideas 
th 3,t we didn't originate?ideas that came 
from Dominicans. 
.lot me tell you about one of these, because 
It llustrates the kind of thing we run across. 
The other day the mayor's office of the 
tool of Beni sent a delegation of very solid 
citizens to see me. They have a number of 
inclustrial-development ideas, 
One was this: They have a building and 
say ring machines and workers who are idle. 
Th.y want to go into the shirtmaking busi-
going ness. But they need some working capital 
ay it to buy material to make the shirts. They 
seed added that, frankly, they also would like to 
p his have someone who can help out on produc-
tivity. Well, when you get people coming to 
is is you with ideas like this who've put in two-
new thirds of the resources needed, and then say, 
e is "Can: you help us go the rest of the way?" 
this is encouraging. 
as 
he spend 4 years, or even 3 
tears, on a youngster, making him what the 
011 :atinos call perito. That means half an ex-
OW ;vit. With that much training, we then can 
x" :ell the youngster, "All right, now you know 
ed ilomething about agriculture. Go back to 
our father's farm and do something with 
It.', 
to 
agri-
ton. What has happened to us is this: The more 
_ we look at this place, the more convinced we 
grow are that there are many possibilities for food 
rod- processing, for textiles, for a number of other 
ajor 
ood. industries. So I'm beginning to think in 
terms of my old experiences with the Puerto 
:at's) Rican development program. I think you 
can stimulate a series of new industrial in-
hen 
ybe vestments here, and we've already started by 
set. signing a contract to have some feasibility 
studies made. 
Finally, let's take a look at priority No. 
5?the whole range of administrative and 
this fiscal reform. The question for us is: 
But How do you help this Government shape up? 
ere How do you cut down, for instance, the ex-
ors. penditure on the military? If it's safe to 
I've do that, it would go far toward bringing 
gers the budget into balance. 
get We stopped at priority five because that's 
fter as much as you should try to think about 
? at the moment. Actually, as we go along, we 
du- may cut the size of the program, because you 
ion just can't cover too many fronts at the 
the same time. 
to Right now, for example, we are entering 
oh- what they call the dead season in sugar. 
to The sugar corporation people came to us and 
said, "Under the emergency financing, we 
ng normally do a lot of repair work and fix up 
ng the mills during the dead season, to keep the 
millhancis working, at least. But there is 
on. no Government to turn to now, and we don't 
have e:nough money, because we are losing 
money at this time." 
So we have built into the emergency Orga-
nization of American States budget about 
$2.6 million to help buy some machin-
ery for emergency repairs. We had to do it. 
If we didn't, sugar production would be hurt 
next year. Secondly, you've got to keep as 
lad many people working as you can?prefer-
vs ably on productive projects like this. 
le HELP THEM FIND THEIR DESTINY 
0 What. about the future? 
al Well, all I can tell you is from what I 
know as an economist. This country needs 
a a good deal of help. I am sure that any 
a people has enough pride in itself, is inven-
t. tive enough?if you can only help these 
al people find their own soul, their own destiny. 
to Then they can cut short the period of time 
I in which they will need development aid. 
0 The real question for the Americas here is 
e not to develop the Dominican Republic but 
e to find some way to make these people decide 
s, to solve their own problems, and get at them.

CASTRO-COMMUNIST TAKEOVER MENACES

y MERICC CITY.?The main danger threaten-

of the assassination last week of Generalis-

the fear expressed by Dominican exiles here. 
"In my opinion, I think the Communists

These are the words of a veteran former

her first husband, some years ago. He was 
the Dominican Ambassador to Mexico three 
times, until early 1957, when he was trans-
ferred to Venezuela. There, In AUgust 1957 
he broke with Trujillo and thereafter came 
to Mexico to live. 
"I devoutly hope that we don't fell into 
Communist hands," said Brea Messina. 
The Communists are not strong in the 
Domtnican Republic, he pointed out, but 
they have kept their organization intact and 
can expect plenty of help from Red Cuba. 
The "Popular Socialist Party of the Do-
minican Regal)lic"?as the Communists are 
formally known?is in fact the creation of 
its Cuban counterpart and bears the same 
name. 
The strangest thing about the birth of 
the Dominican PSP is that Generalissimo 
Trujillo himself presided over it as a sort 
of political midwife. 
Immediately after World War II, the Do-
minican dictator was anxious to establish 
domestic relations with the Soviet Union, 
and in order to curry its favor he thought it 
might be pleased to have a branch of world 
communism in his island. His fellow dic-
tator in Cuba at the time, Pulgencio Batista, 
had given the Communists two posts in his 
Cabinet and the Cuban Communist Party 
"was then (as now) the center of Caribbean 
-Red activities and the logical group to sup-
ply Trujillo's need.

LATIN AMERICA AND TFIE DOMINICAN CRISIS 
(By Daniel James) 
MEXICO Crry.?Despite the loud protests, 
Latin America is not really opposed to the 
swift U.S. military prevention of a Com-
munist takeover in the Dominican Republic. 
Though they had to rail against our inter-
vention In Santo Domingo, Latin American 
leaders privately welcomed it. 
"On the whole, the governments of Latin 
America have shown a great deal of under-
standing of our position," a U.S. official 
in this crucial Latin capital volunteered. 
They themselves were put in a "difficult 
position" by the rapid dispatch of marines 
to the embattled Dominican Republic, since 
that did violate Latin America's traditional 
nonintervention policy. Specifically, as 
Latin editorialists have pointed out, it vio-
lated article 17 of the Act of Bogota, which 
guarantees the right of each American re-
public to settle its internal affairs without 
outside intervention. 
The presence of marines in Santo Domingo 
also evoked emotional memories of their 
landing in exactly the same country 50 years 
ago, then subsequently occupying it and 
paving the way for the Trujillo dictatorship. 
Leftists throughout Latin America have, 
in fact, been recalling every U.S. interven-
tion and alleged intervention since the be-
ginning of the century. Even our recogni-
tion of Batista in 1952 has been listed, by 
one leftist writer, as an act of intervention 
in Cuba although all the Latin countries 
eventually recognized him. 
Still, the Latin response to our pretty 
obvious military intervention in the Domini-
can situation has been "relatively mild" as 
one American observer here termed it. 
It is recalled that in the less obvious in-
tervention in Guatemala, in 1954, there was 
a far more severe concerted criticism in 
Latin America of the U.S. role there. At 
that time, the "Societies of Friendship for 
Guatemala" sprung up in many Latin coun-
tries, and Mexico, in particular, became the 
center of anti-U.S. feeling. 
This time, the situation is considerably 
different. 
Mexico, for example, which is the tradi-
tional champion of nonintervention, issued 
an official statement which did little more 
than "deplore the blood that is flowing" in 
Santo Domingo, during the fighting. 
Recognizing the "reasons of a humanitari-
an character" which induced the United 
States to send more Armed Forces to evacuate 
Americans and foreigners from the Domini-
can Republic, the Mexican statement then re-
marked that the presence of marines "evokes 
such painful memories" in Latin America, 
and ended hoping that the Dominicans "can 
resolve their internal problems without any 
influence * supplied from the outside." 
Other Latin governments took a similarly 
understanding approach. Honduras went 
further, in stating that if the Organization 
of American States isn't able to function 
rapidly in such crises as the Dominican, 
someone must take the Initiative. 
The Brazilian Government, mindful of 
that country's own recent narrow brush with 
communism, has offered to send military 
20529 
forces to Santo Domingo, preferably under 
a collective OAS command. Argentina and 
Colombia have made similar offers. 
One of the loudest reactions has come, sig-
nificantly, from the country which has most 
to fear from communism: Venezuela. At a 
secret meeting of Latin Communist pasties 
in Havana, last November, Venezuela, Colom-
bia, and Guatemala were designated as the 
three main targets of a new Red subversion 
drive in Latin America. 
Understandably, to keep in line the strong 
non-Communist left and prevent it from 
falling for Communist propaganda against 
the United States, President Raul Leoni and 
his supporters were forced to roundly con-
demn our Dominican role. 
La Republica, the daily organ of Leoni's 
Democratic Action Party, rapped Washing-
ton for committing "a unilateral act vio-
lative of the norms which govern the inter-
American system." But, significantly, it did 
not use invective or speak of "Yankee Im-
perialism," as the Communists are doing all 
over Latin America. 
Indeed, a new depth of understanding of 
the U.S. problem is noticeable in Latin cir-
cles, with respect to the Dominican crisis. 
That was most evident in an editorial on 
May 3, in Mexico's Novedades, a newspaper 
that is regarded as close to the government 
of President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz. 
The editorial began by recognizing that 
the rebels who refused to heed the cease-fire 
arranged by the Papal Nuncio "are the Com-
munist shock forces activated from Havana." 
Their aim, it went on, was "to strengthen the 
Castroite influence in the Antilles and, from 
there, extend it with greater force over the 
whole continent." 
President Johnson, continued the Nove-
dades editorial, could not remain indiffer-
ent to that threat, nor could "the rest of 
the countries of this hemisphere." His state-
ment condemning the attempted Commu-
nist takeover in Santo Domingo "constitutes 
a denunciation of Cuban intervention" there, 
and a "logical explanation of the arrival there 
of North American forces." 
Novedades then drew these highly signifi-
cant conclusions: 
"The United States could not assume the 
responsibility for making possible through 
Indolence or indifference, the installation of 
another Communist government on the con-
tinent. Of a government that would not be 
the result of the self-determination of the 
Dominican people, but the outcome of the 
audacity of armed groups directed from out-
side the country." 
Those editorials are highly significant for 
two reasons. They, and the editorial as a 
whole, are the closest anybody in Latin Amer-
ica has come, publicly, to virtually endorsing 
the U.S. action an Santo Domingo. Second, 
they come from an important daily in the 
most antiinterventionist country in Latin 
America?Mexico?and a paper that is close 
to that country's Government. 
Adding to the importance of the "Nove-
dades" editorial is the fact that it was pub-
lished even as Mexico had just finished com-
memorating the 51st anniversary of the U.S. 
naval landings at Vera Cruz, in 1914?an 
event recalled in connection with the Domin-
ican crisis and always mentioned here as a 
black mark against the United States. 
Is "Novedades" reflecting what the new 
Diaz Ordaz Government really thinks but 
does not dare to utter in so many words? 
That is the question foreign observers here 
are pondering. 
There is no doubt, however, that our in-
tervention in Santo Domingo, though well 
understood in Latin America, is raising havoc 
hero. 
It came unfortunately, on the eve of the 
crucial Second Extraordinary Conference of 
American Foreign Ministers to take place in 
Rio de Janeiro, on May 20. And that will

3. Johnson sent too many soldiers to Santo 
remingo. 
"Did he have to send practically 1,000 
soldiers for each Communist?" the Latins are 
a (king sarcastically. They refer to the re-
p srted 40,000 U.S. forces in or near Santo 
D Mingo, and the State Department's official 
figure of 58 Reds in the rebel camp. 
"And why did Marines have to be in-
cluded?" other Latins ask. "Why couldn't 
saes have sent plain soldiers or sailors?" 
It is the Marines, as much as any other 
aspect of our Dominican policy, who work 
up more and more Latins. To appreciate 
hew violent they are on that particular sub-
jea, one must realize that the Marines, 
us fortunately, are the "ugly Americans" here 
bes,ause of their occupations of Haiti, 
Nizaragua, and Santo Domingo herself, in 
the fairly recent past. 
On the other hand, criticism is also made 
of the Latin's role?or absence of one?in 
tho Dominican crisis, 
leftwing friend from a Central Ameri-
can Republic admitted to me, frankly: 
'None of us really cared about the De-
mi iican Republic. We really don't care 
abeut any other nation but our own. You 
do. You worry about everybody. So what 
happens is that we leave the dirty work to 
pat , and when things don't turn out right 
we give you hell." 
The Latin Republics are, in short, funda-
mei itally isolationist in their outlook. They 
are always eager participants in inter-
August 23, 165 
American conferences, but primarily as de-
fenders of their own nationalisms or seekers 
after economic. or other material advantages 
for their respective nations. 
Few Latin countries?as distinct from cer-
tain leaders?really think or act in terms 
of the American community of nations. 
That is a fundamental reason why the OAS 
is weak. Or, as a wag here put it, why it 
functions "only between crises." There is 
some recognition of the fact that were the 
OAS strong?and had it its own collective 
armed force-17.S. Intervention in Santo 
Domingo might have been avoided. 
That question?indeed, the very fate of 
the OAS will almost certainly be discussed 
at the Rio foreign ministers meeting on 
May 20. 
Perhaps the key problem that requires air-
ing is the question of nonintervention, a 
fetish with the Latin Americans. Is non-
intervention valid in the modern world? Is 
it not suicidal to speak of not intervening to 
prevent "wars of liberation" from sweeping 
over Latin America? 
Even as criticism of our Dominican policy 
was mounting here, word was received of 
another Cuba-sponsored effort to provoke 
"wars of liberation." 
From May 5 to May 9, representatives of 40 
"student" and "youth" groups from all over 
the world attended an "International Con-
gress for the Liquidation of Colonialism in 
Latin America," in Havana. They passed 23 
resolutions "solidarizing" themselves with 
"peoples struggles" not only in Santo Do-
mingo but also its next-door neighbor and 
U. S. associate, Puerto Rico, as well as in the 
Carribbean colonies of England, France, and 
Holland and those favorite Castro targets, 
Colombia and Venezuela. 
One resolution made it clear that more 
than moral aid is intended. 
"Solidarity and moral help, to be truly ef-
ficacious and to constitute real help to the 
movement of national liberation," said the 
resolution, "must be accompanied by mate-
rial aid that is effective." 
And what "material aid" can be more "ef-
fective" in a "war of liberation" than arms 
and tramed fighters? 
One wonders what De Gualle will say and 
do if one day he soon is confronted by "Santo 
flamingos" in French Guiana, Guadeloupe, 
and Martinique, all of which were singled 
out at Havana "anticsionial" meeting to 
receive Communist "material aid" in the 
future. 
The Dominican crisis, then, deepens and 
broadens and is engulfing the whole Western 
Hemisphere, in a universal crisis of pro-

SANTO D0AIING0.?The Dominican crisis 
threatens to beceme a treacherous political 
bog for the United States, unless the John-

here with more realism than it has thus far. 
The efforts of Presidential Adviser Mc-
George Bundy to form a broad provisional 
government have failed, after 10 days of ne-
gotiations with both sides in the Dominican 
civil war, because they were predicated upon 
the impossible notion that both warring 
parties could be brought together under 
the same roof. 
Bundy left here utterly bewildered by a 
situation that grows increasingly confusing. 
Yet certain basic facts stand out clearly. 
The first is that the rebels, under Col. 
Francisco Camaafio, are now eager to join 
a provisional regime because they have lost 
the military struggle and have everything to 
gain politically by such a move. Their 
waterloo proved to be the northern zone of ?

which embraced six zones. The J/14 cora-

military districts and was organized along 
classic guerrilla lines. 
The fighting lasted 23 days, and was 
bloody. The founder of the J/14, Manuel

important leaders. "Surely with Manolo

many Dominicans reasoned, "we shall live in

The June 14 proved, by its performance in 
the present revolt, that it was stronger than

_ "If it had not been for the intromission of 
the Yankees, this [revolt] would have termi-
nated by the end of April and the hero of 
Latin America, Comrade F. C. [Fidel Castro] 
would have entered the country in triumph." 
Dominguez continues: 
"I must tell you that we counted on much 
help from C. [Cuba], which P.C. [Fidel Cas-
tro] has promised to send us, but the 
presence of the imperialists prevented its 
arrival." 
Dominguez reveals, further, what the real 
Communist attitude is toward the rebel 
leader, Caamatio: 
"Of the man who leads the struggle, you 
and the others know much about him, but 
don't feel upset, because he will be nothing, 
he will represent nothing when this [coun-

they did then launch their attempt but 
without success.

The Constitution they refer to was passed 
by the Dominican Congress in 1963, while 
Jaen Bosch was President, and went into ef-
f ;et on April 29 of that year. It was promptly 
s ispended 5 months later when Juan Bosch 
yes overthcovm. 
August 23, :1965 
Since then, the 1963 Constitution?some-
times called the Bosch Constitution?has 
been the issue in Dominican politics and has 
deeply divided. the Dominican people, de-
spite the curious fact that few here can cite 
any of its key clauses even in general teams. 
There is as much vehemence among op-
ponents of the 1968 charter as among its 
supporters. They usually attack It as 
"communistic," "antireligious," "anti-pri-
vate .property," and so on. 
The demand of the rebels that the 1963 
Constitution be restored is the central rea-
son?so stated, at least, by the rival "gov-
ernment of national reconstruction" of Gen. 
Antonio Imbert?why the two sides in the 
Dominican civil war have thus far been un-
able to form the broad provisional regime. 
The Imbert forces insist that the country 
be governed, instead, by the 1962 Constitu-
tion. That was passed after the assassina-
tion of the Dominican dictator, Generalissimo 
Rafael Trujillo, and was the basis of the rule 
of a seven-man council of state?called 
simply, the Consejo?until Bosch was inau-
gurated in February 1963. 
What is there about the 1963 Constitution 
which so divides Dominicans? What are the 
basic difference between it and its 1962 pred-
ecessor? 
The befuddling answer is: The two docu-
ments are practically identical. 
An official U.S. Government analysis of 
them shows that they differ on only the 
most minor issues. 
Take for example, the key question of 
property rights. Both constitutions safe-
guard them. Both agree that the state may 
take private property for public purposes, 
and must pay fair compensation in return. 
One difference between the two documents 
on the property question is that the 1963 
version provided that compensation be deter-
mined by balancing the public and private 
interest, both. 
A more serious difference?but not funda-
mental?was that it limited one from own-
ing land "in excessive quantity," and pro-
hibited "latifundios"--that is, big estates. 
But such prohibitions exist in many Latin 
American constitutions, and by no means 
resemble anything communistic. 
The Bosch constitution also forbids for-
eigners from owning property except with 
congressional approval, while its predecessor 
of 1962 says nothing on the subject. That 
is perhaps the most serious difference be-
tween them, but again not unusual in Latin 
America. Mexico, for example, makes It just 
as tough for foreigners to own land, and 
within a certain distance of her borders and 
coastlines no foreigner can _own property at 
all and no Congress can change that. 
Far from being "communistic" the 1963 
Constitution says in article 3, that "private 
economic initiative is declared free." Such 
an open statement favoring capitalism is not 
contained in the 1962 document. 
Both. constitutions favor social security, 
and the 1963 version adds a clause encourag-
ing free trade unionism. And both jealously 
guard national sovereignty and inveigh 
against foreign intervention. 
Nowhere in the Bosch document can there 
be found a single word on religion. Any 
charge that it is "atheistic" or "antichurch" 
is therefore untrue. 
On balance, the 1963 Constitution is about 
as far from being radical as any document 
can get. It is, in fact, much milder than the 
Cuban Constitution of 1940, the banner 
under which Batista was overthrown, and 
it is downright conservative compared with 
the revolutionary Mexican Constitution of 
1917 which rules Mexico to this day. 
Why, then, has the 1963 Constitution 
caused so much division here? 
It is only after many days here, and many 
hours of talking with all sorts of Domini-
cans, that the answer begins hazily to pene-
trate one's mind. The key that unlocked

These groups are the PSPD, or orthodox

to the philosophy of Peiping, and the Ha-

Caamano, son of a prominent figure of the 
Trujillo regime, is regarded here only as a 
frontraan in which can hardly be called a 
governinent at all. Caamano presides over 
what is basically a revolutionary command

Hector Aristy, 32, who wears the title of 
"Minister of Government" in the rebel re-

BLESSING .EROM BOSCH 
The Caamano faction bases its claim to 
legitimacy on the blessing it has received 
from Juan Bosch, who was ousted as Presi-
dent in 1963. Caamano had himself named 
President to finish Bosch's term and prom-
ised elections in December 1966. 
The problem of the Organization of Ameri-
can States and President Johnson is to bring 
about an effective cease-fire and find a in-
terim government until elections can be 
held. Washington wants them to be held at 
an early date so that the intervention can 
end. 
But Caamano will not consent to disarm 
and the rebel militia probably would not

there was impelled by intelligence reports 
that large quantities of arms seized by the

country, authoritative U.S. sources disclosed

President Johnson's advisers recommended 
increasing the strength of U.S. forces from

activities in Latin America, the General Di-

of the Dominican rebel leaders, the document 
said. 
THREE RED PARTIES LISTED 
DOI has for some time provided financial 
support to two of the three Dominican Com-
munist Parties: the 14th of June Political 
Group (APC3), and the Dominican Popular 
Movement (MPD) . The APCJ Party, accord-
ing to U.S. sources, has between 3,000 and 
5,000 members and has been Communist-run 
and _pro-Castro since early 1963. MPD, which 
follows the Peiping line, has about 500 mem-
bers. The other Dominican Communist 
group, which cooperated in the rebellion, is 
the Dominican Popular Socialist Party 
(PSPD) with between 809 to 1,000 members 
who follow the Moscow line. 
The U.S. document said the parties acted 
in harmony in the current rebellion. 
It said the largest department in the DOI 
is the one responsible for directing Latin 
American guerrilla warfare activities. Iden-
tified as the DCII officer who handles revolu-
tionary operations for the Dominican Repub-
lic is Roberto Santiesteban Casanova, who 
was deported by the United States for engag-
ing in espionage in 1962 while serving with 
the Cuban delegation to the United Nations. 
The 26-page document is virtually a "white 
paper" on the Dominican revolt and reflects 
the official U.S. version of what transpired 
there. The following is a day-by-day account 
of Communist activities in the Dominican 
revolt as compiled by U.S. intelligence sources 
from April 24 to May : 
APRIL 24 
Elements of the Dominican Army, led by 
disaffected middlegrade and junior officers, 
revolted against the government of Donald 
Reid Cabral. They seized control of the 27th 
of February Military Camp, making prisoners 
of the army chief of staff and his deputy. 
A group of civilians seized two radio sta-
tions in Santo Domingo and announced that 
Reid had been overthrown. The radio sta-
tions were retaken later in the day by Reid 
forces, but just before they were forced 
off the air, the rebels called on the civilian 
population to join the anti-Reid move-
ment and to go into the streets to sup-
port the rebellion. 
Communist leaders of all three' parties 
Issued orders to their members to incite the 
civilian crowds gathering in the streets, and 
to stage rallies and demonstrations. The 
Communists began organizing their forces 
and assigning members to various functions 
throughout the city. 
Araong those Communists active in the 
first hours of revolt were: Narcisi Isa Conde, 
of the PSPD, already armed with a sub-
machine gun; Diomedes Mercedes Batista 
(PSPD), who was relaying instructions to 
- party members to stand up for further or-
ders; and Amin Abel Hasbun, APCJ member, 
engaged in organizing for Communist partic-
ipation in the revolt, operating from a house 
on Elvira de Mendza Street. 
The situation in Santo Domingo became 
increasingly confused. Senior officers of the 
Dominican Air Force and Army informed 
Reid that they would not support hirn, and 
he resigned and Went into hiding. 
P$PD members carrying weapons gathered 
at Parque Independencia early in the morn-
ing and harangued civilian crowds in sup-
port of the revolt. Among these again were 
Diomedes Mercedes Batista and /Cards? Isa 
Conde., Also active was Asdrubal Dominguez 
Guerrei'O, a student leader who received 
training in Russia in 1962. Throughout the 
morning, mobile loudspeaker units, includ-
ing a Vthite Volkswagen station wagon oper-
ated laY Diomedes Mercedes Batista, patroled 
the city urging the population to join the 
revolt. 
In what later proved to be a key element of 
the revolt, rifles and niachirie guns seized by 
rebellious army elenients were handed out 
to the civilian crowds during the day. One 
of the rebel officers, Capt. Mario Pena 
Tavares, arranged for distribution of several 
thousand weapons, including machine guns 
and hand grenades. Arms from the camp 
were loaded on trucks and sent to the down-
town area of Santo Domingo where they were 
passed out to civilians. The following Com-
munist leaders participated with army rebels 
in uhgodantn e 
in handing out arms and, in some cases 
assumed control of the distribution: 
Hugo Tolentino Dipp, PSPD leader who re-
ceived guerrilla training in Cuba; Fidelio 
Despradel Roque, APCJ leader, trained in 
Cuba and one of the chief figures in the 
guerrilla uprising in late 1963; Felix Servio 
Ducoudray Mansfield of the PSPD, former 
resident of the Soviet Union and Cuba and 
one-time employe of the Peiping Communist 
New China News Agency; Eduardo Houelle-
mont Rogues, APCJ, who was in Cuba in the 
1963 guerrilla operation. 
Other Communists who handed out arms 
were: Buenaventura Johnson Pimental, Juan 
Ducordray Mansfield, who once worked on 
Havana Radio broadcasts to the Dominican 
Republic, and Gerardo Rafael Estevez Weber, 
all of the PSPD; and Maximo Bernard 
Vasquez, of the APCJ, who worked with sub-
versives in the Dominican military in the 
1963 guerrilla movement. 
Bottles and gasoline from tank trucks at 
several points in the city were distributed to 
civilians for making Molotov cocktails, MPD 
members being particularly active in this 
work. 
A mob of several thousand civilians, armed 
with clubs and rifles, marched on the Na-
tional Palace, responding to a call issued over 
a rebel-held radio station. Among them 
were armed Communists. 
Rebels seized the National Palace and the 
rebel army officers gathered to assume con-
trol. Members of the Dominican Revolu-
tionary Party (PRD) arrived with the inten-
tion of installing an interim government 
headed by PRD leader Rafael Molina Urena, 
pending return of the ousted former presi-
dent, Juan Bosch. The PRD leaders and 
rebel army officers who were pro-Bosch pre-
vailed and Molina became provisional presi-
dent. But military officers who had not 
joined the rebellion declared they would 
attack the rebels unless a military junta were 
installed to prepare for national elections 
in September. 
Many important Communists attended po-
litical meetings in the National Palace that 
clay. Among those conferring with Molina 
was Facundo Gomez, a PSPD member and 
part owner of the Scarlet Woman, a boat 
used in the attempted landing of Cuban 
arms in the Dominican Republic in Novem-
ber 1963. Another, Alejandro Lajara Gon-
zales, an APCJ member who had been active 
in distributing arms to civilians, was ap-
pointed by Molina to be Deputy Director 
of Investigation (the Security Service). 
Communist agitators began inciting the 
armed mobs to burn, destroy property and 
seize additional arms. MPD members were 
told their party planned to kill any police-
man found on the streets. Armed civilians 
roamed the city, many of them looting stores 
and private homes. 
The offices and plant of the anti-Commu-
nists newspaper Prensa Libre were seized by 
an armed group which included Communists. 
They prepared immediately to publish prop-
aganda leaflets. 
The offices of three anti-Communist po-
litical parties, the democratic conservative 
Union Civica Nacional; the moderate right-
wing Partido Liberal Revolucionista and the 
moderate center Vanguard i Revolucionaria 
Dominicana, were broken into and sacked. 
During the afternoon, Communist orga-
nizers continued to distribute weapons to 
groups regarded as reliable by the Commu-
nist parties, as well as to round up additional 
manpower for civilian militia units. Weap-
ons depots and distribution points were set 
Up. 
Mercedes Batista, and other PSPD leaders 
were observed leading a paramilitary force 
armed with submachine guns, rifles and gre-
nades. 
Other armed Communist groups were ob-
served on streets and in buildings including 
one led by Manuel Gonzales Gonzalez, Span-
ish Civil War veteran and Cuban intelli-
gence agent. 
APRIL 28 
Antirebel forces, which had been badly 
disorganized, now began to move against the 
rebel-held area of the city under command 
of Gen. Elias Wessin y Wessin, head of the 
Armed Forces Training Center. The Domin-
ican Air Force bombed and strafed rebel-held 
installations. The ferocity of this and sub-
sequent attacks consolidated public resent-
ment and inadvertently presented the rebels 
with an effective propaganda weapon. 
A large quantity of arms and ammunition 
had, by this time, fallen into the hands of 
the Communists. Teams of party members 
were fanning out through the central part of 
Santo Domingo organizing paramilitary 
groups. 
Agitators from all three Red parties con-
tinued to exhort the mobs. They distrib-
uted mineographed propaganda sheets calling 
on the people to fight, and stating, in part, 
that "the hour has arrived to give arms to 
the working class * ? * to form common units 
of soldiers and civilians and to organize 
people's combat units." 
Additional Communist leaders were iden-
tified among the armed mobs and in the 
rebel military forces, including Juan Miguel 
Romman Diaz, of the ACPI, who participated 
in the 1963 guerrilla operation, and Jaime 
Duran Herando, Cuban-trained guerrilla ex-
pert. 
Gustavo Ricart who returned from Cuba 
in 1963 bringing money to finance MPD ac-
tivities, was identified as the commander of 
another rebel stronghold. Five other Com-
munists were in charge of production of a 
considerable number of Molotov cocktails 
during the day. 
The leaders of the various Communist 
parties were well equipped with weapons and 
became an increasingly important element 
in the rebel force. Rebel army officers and 
men, numbering about 1,000 at the outset, 
were soon greatly outnumbered by armed 
civilians who, in a state of disorganization, 
became easy prey for disciplined Communist 
leadership. 
Efforts by the U.S. Embassy toward a cease-
fire between the rebels and elements of the 
Dominican armed forces were unsuccessful. 
During the clay, a large number of American 
citizens assembled in the Hotel Embajador 
seeking safety. They requested assistance 
from the U.S. Embassy in evacuating them 
from Santo Domingo, which was under 
bombardment by the Dominican Air Force 
and was by this time the scene of widespread 
rifle and artillery fire between the oppos-
ing factions. The Embassy secured from 
the rebel leaders agreement to cooperate in 
evacuating Americans from the nearby port 
of Haina. Armed civilian groups, over which 
the Molina regime had lost control, paid no 
attention to this agreement. 
APRIL 27 
About 100 armed civilians, hearing over 
the rebel radio that a prominent Dominican 
newspaperman and broadcaster, well known 
as anti-Communist, was at the Hotel Em-
bajador (actually he was not there) went to 
the hotel and fired several hundred shots. 
April 27 saw the complete breakdown of law 
and order. Molina, the so-called provisional 
president, went to the U.S. Embassy in ap-
parent defeat, accompanied by rebel army 
leaders, Col. Miguel Angel Hernando Ramirez 
and Col. Francisco Caamano Deno. Shortly

speech from a Communist. 
MAY 3-4 
Rebel leaders began to consider how to give 
their movement the form and strueture of 
a legitimate government. Communist lead-
ers discussed among themselves the desir-
ability of their top leaders withdrawing from 
open participation in the rebel movement in 
order both to support rebel claims that the 
movement was free of Communist influence 
and to afford protection to the principal 
figures of the Communist parties. 
Col. Caamano Deno, generally regarded as 
anti-Communist, had said on several occa-
sions during the revolt that he was aware 
the Communists had been playing an increas-
ingly important role. 
MAY 5 
It was the consensus at meetings of Com-
munist leaders that, while rank-and-tie 
members of the three parties should light on, 
prominent Communists should begin with-
drawing from the scene. Some went into 
hiding, others attempted to leave Santo 
Domingo for towns to the north. One of 
these was later captured by antirebel forces. 
Some of the APJC and PSPD leaders who 
left Santo Domingo were under instructions 
to attempt to organize local party members 
and sympathizers for eventual guerrilla ac-
tion in the north. False identity cards were 
prepared for Communist leaders. 
MPD leaders also agreed that the more 
prominent party figures should go under 
cover for the time being. They further de-
cided that arms and ammunition in the 
, hands of party members should be hidden 
r for possible use in guerrilla operations. Or-
ders were given to secure as many arms as 
they could and deliver them to party head-
quarters. 
From the Washington Star, June 14, 19651 
SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER Ole REDS ACITVE IN 
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, U.S. AIDE SAYS 
(By Jeremiah O'Leary) 
There are still substantial numbers of 
Communists and Communist sympathizers 
on the rebel side in the Dominican Republic 
impasse, Assistant Secretary of State Jack 
H. Vaughn said yesterday. 
Vaughn, who heads the Government De-
partment's Inter-American Affairs Division, 
held out scent hope for an early end to the 
deadlock and the outpouring of U.S. funds 
to keep the Caribbean nation from slipping 
into chaos. He said: 
"We have spent nearly $20 million for . . . 
food (and other relief supplies) and this 
could go on for many months . . ." 
He said Communists have influenced Gen. 
Francisco Caamano Deno's rebel side from 
the beginning of the revolt. 
In an interview on the ABC show "Issues 
and Answers," Vaughn said, "Our guess is 
that there are close to 5,000 Communists in 
three groups in the Dominican Republic. 
Dozens more have been identified as leaders. 
"The point is they were well organized 
land trained in Cuba, Russia, Czechoslovakia, 
land Red China. They came back to the 
Dominican Republic in a clandestine way 
from exile determined to take advantage 
of this revolt and to subvert it. It has been 
their interest for many years." 
He identified by name several Communist 
leaders of Dominican, Spanish, and Haitian 
origin whose roles in events leading to 
learn intervention were ciescrihed in a

August 23, :1965 
Star story yesterday based on a government 
document. 
Vaughn said many of the Communist 
leaders have 'filtered out of the rebel zone 
into the Dominican countryside. 
A resumption of fighting, he said, is con-
sidered possible because the United States 
knows large quantities of arms were dis-
tributed by rebels and Communists. Some 
of these arms had been hidden in the interior 
of the republic and there is a threat that 
they might be used. 
IIVIBERT STRENGTH GAINS 
The junta forces of Gen. Antonio Imbert 
Herrera are believed to be stronger now than 
they were when the fighting was stoppedby 
the intervention, Vaughn says. 
He indicated belief the junta forces might 
be able to win a military decision but that 
such a clash is unlikely due to the presence 
of the enter-American Peace Force, sent by 
the U.S.-supported Organization of Ameri-
can States. 
Vaughn also indicated disbelief in infor-
mal polls taken by some newsmen purporting 
to show that Catun.ano has overwhelming 
popular support in the Dominican Republic. 
"We question whether either Caamano or 
Imbert has overwhelming support. It's easy 
to take a poll and have all the cab drivers 
agree. 
"What the overvrhelmiele majority of the 
Dominican _people want is the sort of demo-
cratic government that has been denied 
them for so many years." 
SEES ELECTIONS FAR OFF 
He said a civilian, more moderate than 
Gellman?, would be more attractive to the 
Dominican people, and cited former presi-
dent Joaquin Balaguer as a man who would 
be a frontrunner in any future election, 
Vaughn said he did not believe the rebel 
conetitutionalists would win if elections

PEACE CHIEF LAYS FIRING TO DOMINICAN 
REBELS 
(By Jeremiah O'Leary) 
The Brazilian general in charge of the

under Col. Francisco Caamano Deno were in 
flagrant violation of the cease-fire in Santo

Venezuela and Costa Rica reportedly meant 
to suggest new rules for judging whether

But mechanisms for deciding questions of 
recognition would be useless in restoring civil

The OAS, with Washingtons tacit encour-

ing to ignore that deadly power struggles 
threaten all over Latin America. 
But things are changing. If the Latin

Mr. Johnson's relations with Congress 
would have been deeply impaired. Congres-

nam policy would have splintered on the 
question?"Why fight for peace and freedom 
in Vietnam and let the Caribbean go?" 
- In the next election, the Democrats would 
have been accused of giving both Cuba and 
the Dominican Republic to communism. 
Further, a Cuba-backed regime in the re-
public would have meant another confron-
tation with Russian and new danger of 
nuclear war over the Caribbean. It would 
have dashed hopes of settlement of Vietnam 
in any foreseeable future. 
If Mr. Johnson had taken the consultation

would never have forgotton that Americans 
were massacred and the Caribbean fell to 
communism while their President talked to 
the OAS over the phone.

to bring the United Nations further into the

Francisco Caamano Deno, the nominal rebel

understandable.

Latin Americans fear U.S. intervention. 
For if the United States favors one side 
today, it may favor the other tomorrow. 
In the light of history, it is surprising that 
the Latin American protests have not been

The Johnson administration's action means 
three things:

made. 
? 
At 8:45, Sunday morning, President John-
son, from Camp David, ordered U.S. Navy 
units to move near Santo Domingo and lie 
offshore, out of sight. 
This was no novelty. When the longtime 
Dominican dictator, Rafael L. Trujillo, was 
assassinated in May 30, 1961, the then Vice 
President Johnson, acting for President Ken-
n.edy in his absence,Thent U.S. Navy ships to 
stand off Santo Domingo. 
President Kennedy himself sent them there 
in December 1961, when Trujillo's surviving 
family threatened to retake power. 
President Johnson learned on Monday, 
April 26, that Santo Domingo's city manager, 
around 11:30 a.m., called to urge our Ambas-
sador W. Tapley Bennett: "Do something 
about your people, for God's sake." Rioting 
and fighting had spread. The Pepsi-Cola 
plant, an. American symbol, was burned and 
bottles were stolen for Molotov cocktails. 
At noon Monday, the Embassy began warn-
ing all Americans to gather for evacuation 
at the Hotel Embajador, on the citys' out-
skirts. About 2,500 Americans were in Santo 
Domingo?diplomats' families, business resi-
dents, tourists. 
At 5 p.m. Sunday, the Dominican Air Force 
joined General Wessin. On Monday, they 
bombed the presidential palace and strafed 
the rebel-held end of the strategic Ozama 
Bridge. 
On. Monday, the rebel radio broadcast the 
names and address of the pilots' families. 
The pilots' wives and mothers were taken to 
the Ozarna Bridge as hostages against further 
strafing. 
On Monday, our State Department dis-
cussed the situation with the Brazilian and 
Chilean diplomats. 
A cease-fire was arranged for from 11 am. 
till 2 p.m. on Tuesday, so the 1,170 Americans 
at the Embajador could be taken by bus to 
Haim port and evacuated. 
LUCKY 
, Soon after 8 a.m. Tuesday, an armed rabble 
burst into the Embajador. They had been 
given rifles and tommyguns by defecting 
army men. They sprayed bullets over the 
heads of prostrate Americans inside and 
outside the hotel. By luck, no one was shot. 
The later cease-fire held long enough for 
the Americans to reach Heine, 9 miles away. 
That same morning, Colombia's OAS Am-
bassador, Emilio N. Oribe, called on Assist-
ant Secretary of State for Latin American 
Jack Hood Vaughn. They discussed bringing 
the OAS into the crisis. 
White Vouse approval was prompt. And 
at Tuesday noon, the U.S. alternate repre-
sentative ' to the OAS, Ward Allen, called 
an urgent meeting of the Peace Committee.

U.S. PRESS HIT FOR &roams ON VITAL SPEECH 
(By Virginia Prewett) 
U.S. press coverage of the Dominican crisis 
has become the subject of an international 
debate. Among incidents that liberal Latin 
Americans are now deploring is that an ex-
tremely important pronouncement by a great 
Latin American gtAtelaman was compressed in 
the U.S? press into a stark, one-point com-
ment: 
When ex-President Romulo Betancourt of 
Venezuela June 3 spoke to more than 800 
meMbers and guests of the inter-American 
Association for Democracy and Freedom in 
New York, he did indeed, as our press high-
lighted, say unilateral U.S. intervention in 
the Dominican Republic was, in his Spanish 
term, "repudiable." 
Depending on your ear for languages, this 
can mean "repudiate-able" or "objectionable" 
or perhaps best of all, "inacce tabl " 
ONLY A PART 
But this was not by far the whole Betan-
court message, as the press reports implied. 
Rather it was a preliminary statement of the 
Speaker's conviction that unilateral inter-
vention must not become acceptable in the 
Inter-American system after so great an ef-
fort has been spent to make it unacceptable. 
The Venezuelan statesman said the out-
come of the Dominican_intervention will be 
fateful for 'U.S. relations in the hemisphere 
and fatal to the Organization of American 
States unleas the outcome is "the reestab-
' 
lishment of constitutionality and democracy" 
and not another military dictatorship. 
Then he began firing his salvos. Preserv-
ing Latin America from "new Cubes," he 
said, or "further Sovietizing misadventures" 
is "an inescapable duty and responsibility." 
This can be done, he said, only when OAS 
maintains in function an effective mechan-
ism for Collective action "directed alike 
against the perils of Communist expansion 
and the present reality of arbitrary and self-
elected governments." 
He warned: 
"In all the Latin American countries where 
usurper governments are in power, peoples' 
rebellkins are incubating, similar to that 
which has shaken the Dominican nation to 
its roots. 
The Communists infiltrate these uprisings 
because they are trained for violent sub-
version and not for peaceful indoctrination. 
Their most favorable climate is insurrec-
tion." 
Dr. Betancourt stressed the urgency of the 
thesis?now so well proved in both Cuba and 
the Dominican Republic?that Latin Ameri-
can governments not originating at the 
polls?"those that are dictatorial and at the 
service of the wealthy minorities, national 
and foreign"?are excellent breeding grounds 
for uprisings and collective upheavals, "which 
the Communists take advantage of." 
The true pacification of Latin America, he 
said, categorically, will not be possible until 
an OAS mechanism, backed by democratic 
Latin governments and the United States 
guarantees democratic regime. 
1DEPOSED DOMINICAN CHIEF?REID CABRAL 
BLAMES COMMUNISTS FOR REVOLT 
(By John T. Skelly) 
WASHINGTON, July 15.?The deposed head 
-of the Dominican Republic triumvirate, Don-
-aid Reid Cabral, today questioned President 
-Johnson's view that the Dominican uprising 
was democratic in origin but was immedi-
ately taken over by Communist forces. 
In his speech before the National Press 
Club, Cabral said: 
"What happened in Santo Domingo on 
that fateful clay of April 24, was not a con-
ventional Latin American military coup that 
got out of hand and, as one observer put it, 
was taken over by the Communists In a 
flash almost as rapid and blinding as a nu-
clear explosion. 
''To the contrary, it was a revolution that 
had long been planned by European and 
Havana-trained Communists, it was triggered 
by Communists, and to this day remains in 
the hands of hard-core Communists." 
(On June 1, President Johnson said: "Thefl 
Communists did not, in our judgment, origi-
nate this revolution, but they joined it and 
they participated in it. They were active in 
it, and in a good many places they were in 
charge of it.") 
However, he backed up the President's 
decision to send in American marines and 
paratroopers. Reid Cabral also expressed 
hope that the Inter-American Peace Force 
would not stay in the Dominican Republic 
longer than necessary. 
"No Dominican can be free of sadness at 
seeing his country occupied by foreign 
troops, but President Johnson's courageous 
decision in Sending marines and paratroopers 
to the Dominican Republic without a shadow 
of a doubt saved thousands of lives and 
spared us occupation today by Soviet troops, 
such as those now in Cuba. 
_ "I am convinced that the Inter-American 
Peace Force will not remain in the Domini-
can Republic for a moment longer than is 
necessary, and that my country will have 
suffered less from their temporary presence 
than it would have suffered from permanent 
occupation by extra-continental forces." 
Reid Cabral said that he did not think "it 
prudent or wise to attempt to hold elections

tained by contributions of Christian Demo-

One of the principal courses offered to 
the youths is the history of Marxism and the 
ways of communism. Thus the Dominican 
Social Christians who lecture to command 
posts?as well as the Social Christians and 
other rebels who are occasionally exposed to 
Marxist theories?are well aware of the Com-
munist line. 
All lecturers in the constitutionalist gov-
ernment courses have sworn to be as objec-
tive as possible in their presentation of mate-
rial. They must not present material from a 
strict party line, whether it be PRD, PRSC, or 
The Social Christians explain their posi-
tion by saying: 
"We know that the Russians are worse in 
that they deny all freedoms while in the 
United States you have basic freedoms, But 
your freedoms are for your own people. Your 
foreign policy denies other people freedom. 
"We cannot afford at this time to attack 
the Communists. We have to let the people 
see that we are on their side in this fight 
against the Americans. Maybe someday we 
will say something nice about the Ameri-
cans." 
The Dominican Social Christians are di-
vided, not in numbers but in leadership. 
One of the founders of the party, Guido 
D'Allesandro, was put out early this year be-
cause he followed the "linea suave"?soft 
line?as opposed the the "linea dura"?hard 
line?of the present leadership of the party. 
Those who follow the soft line favored 
closer relations with the U.S. Embassy, like 
attending embassy functions and receptions, 
or trying to get along with the Triumvirate. 
The hard line advocates, such as President 
Antonio Rosario, believe it unwise to be 
friendly with the U.S. Embassy.. 
The PRSC, founded in 1961, forms part of 
ODCA (Organizations Democrats Christina de 
America), the hemisphere-wide organization 
of Christian Democrat parties. For this rea-
son, both President Frei of Chile and Rafael 
Caldera of Venezuela have denounced the 
U.S. landings in the Dominican Republic. 
The fact that President Frei, first Christian 
Democrat to be elected chief of state of a 
Latin American country, has endorsed the 
Constitutionalist government of President 
Caamano has given the Dominican PRSC's 
stock new value in the eyes of the masses. 
The PRSC's slogan in the revolution is 
"green light for the poor of the Americas." 
They have thousands of posters all over the 
rebel zone. The man who operates their 
headquarters in the absence of Dr. Antonio 
Rosario in exile in New York, is Andres 
Lockward. 
Lockward, a public accountant by profes-
sion, studied the cooperative movement at 
the University of Wisconsin for a year. He 
sits behind a plain wooden desk, machine-
gun by his side, and directs both the military 
and political operation. He frequently smiles 
and appears to have the right temperament 
for the frustrations and confusions that go 
on continuously in the constitutional 
government. 
The PRSC, Lockward says, will not partici-
pate in the Provisional Government. It is, 
however, fully behind the Caamano govern-
ment. The probable President of the Pro-
visional Government, Hector Garcia Godoy, 
conferred with Lockward and his top advisers 
last week for about an hour. 
Backing up Lockward in the high com-
mand is an attractive mother of eight 
children, nonpracticing physician, Dra. Jose-
flna Padilla. Two of her oldest boys, 18 and 
19, participated in the fighting and are now 
part of the yellow helmets MP's of the 
constitutionalist. 
The PRSC's got 60,000 votes in the last free 
elections in 1962. Lockward points out that 
they had at least 150,000 but that many vot-
ed for Bosch, because they knew that the 
PRSC's could not win. The PRSC's will not 
say how many armed followers they have in 
the rebel zone. They point out, however, 
that in addition to the party militant, they 
have the Christian workers with them 
(CASC) 
Furthermore, they point out, the leaders 
and members of most Catholic groups in the 
Dominican Republic have joined them in the 
fight to restore the constitution. These 
- groups include BRUC (the Christian bloc at 
- the university) , JRC, Young Christian Revo-
lutionaries, and FEDELAC (the agrarian 
Christian leagues), that are spread through-
out the country.

abortive comeback by a deposed Dominican 
President into a "war of national libera-

The fighting started as a revolt by a group 
of junior officers in favor of ousted President 
Juan Bosch, currently in exile in Puerto Rico. 
Within 3 days, that military revolve fizzled. 
But not before vast stocks of arms had been 
passed out to pro-Bosch civilians and their 
Castroite allies, who succeeded in transform-
ing the attempted coup into a full-scale civil 
war. 
PLANE SPEED AHEAD 
The Dominican most responsible for the 
U.S. military presence was Elias Wessin y 
Wessin, a tough little brigadier general who 
commands the country's most powerful mili-
tary base and at the time the marines landed 
was the key force for law and order. Twice 
before, General Wessin y Wessin, 40, had 
relied on his planes and tank-equipped sup-
porting troops to settle political disputes in 
the Dominican Republic. He was the man 
who deposed Juan Bosch in 1963, after a 
series of angry confrontations over Com-
munist infiltration in the government. Now 
he was fighting again, as he saw it, to pre-
vent a political struggle from becoming a 
Communist takeover. And for help this 
time, he called on the United States. Said 
Wessin y Wessin: "We saved the country by 
only a hair. The conspiracy was very big. 
The majority of people did not even know 
what was going on. 
The U.S. decision to go in involved well-
knoWn risks. Memories of previous U.S. in-
terventions are still very much alive in Latin 
America; the words "Yankee imperialism" 
are a rallying cry for leftists everywhere.

or so the United States believes?but it did 
nothing to halt Castro's campaign of sub-
version around the hemisphere. According 
to U.S. intelligence, Cuba training schools 
turn out more than 1,500 American graduates 
each year as guerrilla cadres.* Venezuela's 
Army has been chasing them through the 
interior without notable success. Colombia's 
even more expert army no snoner cleaned out 
the country's bandits than a pair of Castro-
style guerrilla bands cropped up in the 
same Andean hills. There have been reports 
of Communist guerrillas in Guatemala, Hon-
duras, Peru, Argentina, Brazil?and of course 
the Dominican Republic, for which Castro 
has a special affinity. Way back in Septem-
ber 1947 Fidel himself, then a student, was 
involved in an unsuceccssful attempt to 
launch a 1,100-man invasion force from 
Cuba. 
Considering the island's ugly history, it is a 
wonder that the Dominican Republic's left-
ists did not make their move long before. 
The tinder for revolution has been building 
for generations, and in the unstable years 
after dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, the 
Dconfinican military has been the strongest 
anti-Communist Influence. Most often it 
was in the person of Wessin y Wessin.

year later, he led a coup to depose the coun-
try's newly elected President, Juan Bosch, 
whose promises of reform won wide praise 
but whose attitude toward Comniunists was 
highly permissive. Bosch declared an am-
nesty for all exiles, permitted scores of far 
leftists to return from Cuba and Europe?
"the better to watch them," he said. When 
Bosch refused to restrict the Communists' 
right to travel and even allowed trips to 
Cuba, Wessin y Wessin demanded that the 
President outlaw the Communist Party. 
Bosch refused and demanded Wessin y Wes-
sin's resignation. Instead, in September 
1963, the general staged the bloodless coup 
that ousted Bosch and sent him into exile 
In Puerto Rico. "As far as I'm concerned," 
says Wessin. y Wessin, "Bosch is a Commu-
nist." 
Donald Reid Cabral, 41, a Santo Domingo 
auto dealer, emerged as the leader of the 
civilian triumvirate that succeeded Bosch. 
With the general's backing, Reid instituted 
some beginning social and economic reforms, 
even tried to stop the time-honored military 
practice of smuggling in goods from over-
seas. All the while, Bosch's supporters 
plotted for their leader's return?and ap-
parently found considerable backing among 
young armY officers. Bosch's men also 
found encouragement among the country's 
leftists, notably the Castroite 14th of June 
movement, which attempted an abortive 
anti-Trujillo invasion from Cuba in 1959. 
To exactly what extent Bosch himself knew 
of the Castroite involvement is unclear. The 
fact remains that in the past few weeks, ac-
cording to intelligence sources, considerable 
numbers of Cuban-trained Dominicans have 
been slipping across the Windward Passage. 
Last week three boats loaded with about 65 
Dominicans were seen leaving the Cuban 
port of Santiago, "I reported the conspiracy 
to President Reid for 15 or 20 consecutive 
days," says Wessin y Wession, "but he paid 
no attention to me." 
"KILL A POLICEMAN" 
On Saturday, April 24, at 3:30 p.m., three 
army sergeants and a handful of civilians 
seized Radio Santo Domingo and announced 
a "triumphant revolution to restore Juan 
Bosch to the Presidency." The announce-
ment was enough to send the croak's boiling 
out onto the streets, where agitators whipped 
them into a frenzy. Army units at two near-
by bases joined the revolt, and mobs invaded 
the central fire station, stole the engines 
and drove them all night, sirens h6wling, 
through the city streets. 
The next morning, high-ranking army 
officers, anxious to use the revolt as an excuse 
for getting rid of Reid, told him that they 
would not fire on the rebel troops. Reid had 
no choice but to resign, and fled into hiding 
at a friend's home. It was already too late 
to smother the mob's pent-up passions. In-
sistently, the rebel radio exhorted: "Kill a 
policeman i Kill a policeman!" "Come into 
the street and bring three or four others with 
you!" The frightened armymen who had 
forced Reid's resignation turned the gov-
ernment Over to lawyer Rafael Molina Urefia, 
a Bosch supporter, until Bosch himself could 
return. In San Juan, Bosch announced that 
he would be in Santo Domingo "just as soon 
as the air force sends a plane for me." 
"BRING TI-IEK TO ITS" 
The Dominican Air Force was loyal to Wes-
sin y Wgssin. Up to this point he had only 
watched from the sidelines at San Isidro. 
At last he took a hand. Instead of a DC-3 
to San Juan, he ordered his F-51.'s to strafe 
the palace and the approaches to the Duarte 
Bridge, which his tanks would cross to reach 
the city. Several people were killed in the 
raids, which roused the rebel radio and TV 
stations to a new frenzy. Well-known mem-
bers of three Communist groups, including 
the 14th of June, appeared on TV in Cuban-
style uniforms to harangue the audience into 
action. They broadcast the addresses of loy-
alists' supporters and relatives. "Wessin's 
sister lives at 25 Santiago" "Find the pilots' 
families and bring them to us." And the 
mob did. Wives and children of air force 
pilots were dragged before TV cameras. 
Warned the announcer: "We are going to 
hold them at the bridge. If you strafe there, 
you kill them." 
On Sunday afternoon, army defectors dis-
tributed four truckloads of weapons among 
rebels in the Ciudad Nueva, a low-cost hous-
ing area in the city's southeast: bazookas, 
.50-cal. machineguns, automatic rifles. Pro-
Bosch rebels numbering about 2,000 to 4,000 
began waging an urban guerrilla war, making 
forays into the business district, thus para-
lyzing the city. Rebel mobs sacked the new 
Pepsi-Cola plant, set fire to the offices of a 
pro-Reid newspaper, destroyed Reicl,s auto 
agency. 
From his command post at San Isidro, 
Wessin y Wessin announced operacian libre 
to liberate the city. The army garrison at 
San Cristobal rallied to his side; the navy 
joined in, lobbed 3-inch shells at the palace. 
Air Force planes made repeated strafing runs. 
Then across the river rumbled the tanks, 
firing almost point-blank into rebel Ciudod 
Nueva. 
Meanwhile the U.S. Embassy was gathering 
Americans and other foreigners at the Em-
bajador Hotel for evacuation. More than 500 
people were waiting at the hotel and on the 
grounds when a group of rebel teenagers, 
most of them kids from 16 to 18, suddenly 
appeared waving burp guns. They lined the 
men up against a wall as if to execute them, 
then fired their automatic weapons harm-
lessly into the air. "Those brats just seemed 
to delight in terrorizing us," said one U.S. 
housewife. Only the arrival of a rebel army 
colonel stopped the gunplay and permitted 
the removal of the refugees to the port of 
Haina, 12 miles away. There the U.S. Navy 
was already waiting to load 1,172 of them 
aboard transports. Some 1,000 other Ameri-
cans elected to stay behind, hoping the dis-
order would soon be ended. 
COLLECTIVE MADNESS 
For a time, ft did seem about over. Decid-
ing that they were licked, most of the leaders 
of the army revolt trooped into the U.S. Em-
bassy, asked U.S. Ambassador Tapley Bennett 
to arrange a cease-fire. He called Wessin y 
Wessin, who immediately agreed. Fearing 
reprisals, dozens of rebels, including Acting 
President Molina, fled to political asylum in 
foreign embassies. A junta composed of pro-
Wessin y Wessin officers was sworn in as a 
provisional government. 
The surrender of the army rebels had little 
effect on the civilians, who by now were 
beyond recall. All day Wednesday the fight-
ing intensified; Wessin y Wessin's troops 
launched assault after assault in an attempt 
to cross the Duarte Bridge. Each time they 
were driven back. President Johnson or-
dered the first 405 marines ashore to protect 
American lives at Embajador and to guard 
the U.S. Embassy downtown. Helicopters 
evacuating the remaining AMeliCalls and 
Other nationals drew rebel gunfire. Snipers 
opened up on the Marine company dug in 
around the Embassy; the leathernecks fired 
back, killing four rebels. The Salvadoran 
Embassy was sacked and burned; shots spat-
tered into the Mexican, Peruvian and Ecua-
dorian Embassies. "This is collective mad-
ness," U.S. Ambassador Bennett told news-
men. "I don't know where we go from here." 
LIST OF REDS 
In San Juan, Bosch had his kind of an-
swers. He charged that the United States 
had been duped into intervening by military 
gangsters in the Dominican Republic. "The 
only thing that Wessin y Wessin has done," 
he said, "is to bomb the first city of America 
like a monster." Bosch conceded that "a few 
Communists" might be fighting on his side, 
but insisted that his supporters were in com-
plete command of the rebels. In reply, the 
State Department released a list of 58 Com-
munist agitators, many of them gradautes of 
Red Chinese and Czechoslovakian political 
warfare schools, who were leading the street 
fighting. Some of the leaders: Jaime Duran, 
a Cuban-trained member of the Dominican 
Young Communists' Party; Jos?. Issa, a 
Communist who received guerrilla training 
in Cuba, visited Prague in 1963, Moscow in 
1964; Fidelio Despradel Rogues, a Peiping-
lining Communist. 
The tragic fact was that no one seemed 
to be in real command any more?not Bosch's 
people, not the remaining army rebels, not 
the Communists. At one rebel headquarters 
in the Ciudad Nueva, a group of young rebels 
pleadingly told Time's reporters: "We are not 
Communists. We are active anti-Commu-
nists We are fighting for the constitution, 
for Bosch. When the constitution is re-
stored, we will keep the Communists out. 
We can handle them." Very possibly those 
youngsters genuinely thought that they were 
fighting for democracy. But before anyone 
could talk rationally about restoring any-
thing in the Dominican Republic, there had 
to be a cease-fire, and at week's end that still 
seemed beyond any immediate grasp. 
Meeting in emergency session in Washing-
ton, the Organization of American States 
asked Msgr. Emanuelle Claxizio, the papal 
nuncio in Santo Domingo, to negotiate a 
cease-fire until a five-man truce team could 
fly down to work out a lasting settlement. 
Wessin y Wessin and other loyalist com-
manders and some rebel elements agreed 
under two condtions: that no one would be 
punished for any acts during the fighting, 
and that the OAS would supervise the for-
mation of a provisional government. Even 
as Msgr. Clarizio reported the hopeful news 
to Washington, rebel forces captured Ozama 
Fortress, the police headquarters, with its 
stocks of weapons and ammunition. The 
shooting continued throughout Saturday, 
and the rebels claimed 10,000 armed fighters 
compared with 3,000 for Wessin y Wessin's 
loyalist forces. 
DRIVING IN EARNEST 
That was probably a gross exaggeration. 
However many there were, there was no 
letup in the bloodbath or in the sniping at 
U.S. troops. Going into action for the first 
time in earnest, the 82d Airborne joined 
Dominican infantrymen in pushing out from 
the bridge perimeter, fought their way 
through the city's heart to link up with a 
Marine column attacking from the western 
International Zone. The drive cost another 
two U.S. dead, at least a dozen wounded?. 
and brought an announcement from Wash-
ington that 2,000 more troops were being 
sent in bringing the total contingent to 
7,000 men. 
The likelihood is that some sort of peace, 
either through force of arms or OAS per-
suasion, will eventually be imposed. But 
the dangers of anarchy-fed Castroism will 
remain for a long while. To prevent that, 
President Johnson has accepted a clear and 
unwavering U.S. responsibility. "The United 
States," said the President, "will never de-
part from its commitment to the preserva-
tion of the right of all of the free people of 
this hemisphere to choose their own course 
without falling prey to international con-
spiracy from any quarter." The meaning 
was as unmistakable as the presence of U.S. 
combat troops in Santo Domingo.

DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
Th the Dominican Republic, the people 
speak Spanish rather than Creole French. 
Its soil is more fertile, and its population 
density only half that of its smaller neighbor. 
What it shares is a common history of chaos. 
As in Haiti, bloody rebellions drove out the 
European governors, first the French in 1809, 
Then the Spanish, who had tried to reassert 
their dominion. No sooner had the Domini-
-can "Republic declared its independence in 
1821 than it was invaded by neighboring 
Haiti, which occupied the country for 22 
brutal years. The Haitians banned all for-
eign priests, severed papal relations, closed 
the University of Santo Domingo, and levied 
coriMscatory taxes. Not until 1844, when 
Haiti was torn by one of its many civil wars, 
did the Dominican Republic finally break

? SOME ANSWERS TO SECOND-GUESSERS 
(By Eric Sevareid) 
The tide of second guessing about the 
American intervention in Santo Domingo--
as to its justification, its size, its methods 
and its alma?had reached oceanic propor-
tions by the time this writer managed to get 
to the first European city _established in the 
New World. There in what Columbus called 
"the land of God," had come the first teach-
ers and preachers, yet here remains, after five 
centuries, one of the political hellholes of the 
hemisphere, its soiled streets once again 
thronged with armed men from abroad. 
The scenes of bitter Sorrow in Santo Do-
Mingo have been well described; there are 
other things, perhaps, worth putting down 
at this late date. I thought I had rarely seen 
such brave work by combat reporters, rarely 
such emotional Involvement on the part of 
some of them, rarely such a wealth of un-
confirmable reports and rumors, rarely such 
a disastrous lack of contact between reports 
and American officials who were not only 
physically remote but for a long time si-
lenced by Presidential orders. And rarely 
have I read such certain conclusions in 
American press editorials about a phenom-
enon in which so much was uncertain and 
inconclusive. 
For me it is impossible to believe that the 
Communist threat was a myth, impossible to 
believe that a democratic and stable govern-
ment could have been formed by the im-
passioned leaders of thousands of armed and 
impassioned people, a vast number of them 
youngsters. It is hard for me to believe that 
we could not have prevented the tragic fight-
ing in the northern part of the city, easy to 
believe that we did prevent an even more 
awful bloodletting in the congested down-
town region. 
I cannot understand the cry that we put in 
far too many men. An airport, several miles 
of corridor and a safety sector with a long 
perimeter require thousands of soldiers who 
require other thousands to support and sup-
ply them. Nor can I understand the com-
plaint that the President acted with too 
much haste. 
Over many years I have been adjusted to 
the complaint of "too late with too little." 
I. find it hard to make a quick switch to 
the complaint of "too soon with too much." 
I fail to understand the editorialist who 
points out with disdain that after all, there 
were only a few handfuls of Communists 
present. 
In a very real sense their lack of numbers 
is their strength. It was because they were 
few that President Bosch had not bothered 
to deal severely with them. It was because 
they Were few that they could do much of 
their work undetected. It was because they 
were few that they could act with rapidity 
when the explosion came. It was because

? 
ectuid make the Americans seem- ridiculous 
and give us a propaganda defeat. As John 
Bartlow Martin reminds us, Communists do 
not make revolutions, they take them over. 
Partly because of this?their small num-
bers?American troops could not invade the 
heart of the city, or allow anyone else to 
invade it. 
You cannot risk causing many deaths in 
order to capture a few individuals and expect, 
ever, to justify such an action to anybody, 
certainly not to the American people. So, 
at this writing at least, the Dominican Com-
munists remain, finding safety as they first 
found strength, in their numbers?their 
small numbers. 
And their small number in various other 
Latin American countries lies near the heart 
of the profound dilemma that confronts the 
United States for the future. Revolts are 
brewing in other nations to the south. In 
all these revolts Communist elements will 
be present. Are we to put down every up-
rising because a Communist threat is pres-
ent? Obviously we cannot, even though 
some of these uprisings probably will produce 
Communist governments. This is why Cas-
tro laughs in his beard. He believes the 
political metamorphosis of Latin America is 
not manageable on our terms. 
But nothing in this realm of human action 
Is inevitable; the game is not lost as long 
as we act on the assumption that it can 
be won. There are Latin societies strong 
enough to handle the Communists on their 
sown. Others will be galvanized into coun-
teraction by Communist victories or near 
victories close by their borders. 
Meantime the nonsense arguments should 
stop. To say that the United States has 
kept the Dominican Republic from enjoying 
a free, stable democratic government is non-
sense; we have given them another chance 
to find their feet on the long, hard road to 
democracy. To say that the real fear in 
Latin America is of American gunboat diplo-
macy is nonsense; every literate Latin Amer-
ican knows that American interventions have 
always been temporary while communism is 
permanent. 
It is nonsense to indulge any longer the 
self-conscious idea that Latin America's 
troubles are the fault of the United States. 
Some are; most are the fault of Latin Amer-
ica. Its ways of life are superior to ours in 
more than a few respects, but not in respect 
to the art of government. In the last cen-
tury and a half there have been in all of 
Latin America approximately 3,700 coups, 
rebellions, and civil wars. 
[From the New York (N.Y.) Journal-

nutted without involving overt and direct 
acts of interventions In our day this type 
of concealed, indirect but carefully calcula-
ted aggression?usually carried out through 
the familiar tactics of infiltration, subver-
sion, and the use of proxies?has been de-
veloped by the Communists into a line art. 
Indeed, it has become the most favored, as 
well as the most effective tool of Communist 
foreign policy." 
Ambassador Chieh added: 
? "Yet this type of aggression has received 
no careful consideration in the textbooks of 
international law. One of the basic tenets of 
international law is the concept of direct 
responsibility of states for their international 
conduct. In the Communist strategy of pro-
tracted conflict, direct action is more often 
than not avoided. 
"This being so, it is often difficult to fasten 
on the Communist governments the precise 
legal blame, even when they have in fact com-
mitted legal aggression. 
"The Communist governments do not set 
great store by bourgeois international law. 
Yet they do not hesitate to turn traditional 
judicial concepts to their own advantage. 
Now the U.S. action in the Dominican Re-
public was admittedly an act of intervention. 
The U.S. Government never concealed this 
fact. This intervention, far from being an 
aggression, was intended to accomplish the 
dual purpose of protecting American lives and 
forestalling the Communist takeover of a sis-
ter republic. So the U.S. action was in fact 
but a response to Communist intervention 
and aggression." 
Ambassador Chieh emphasized that if a 
sovereign people in a helpless country are 
threatened by the Red foe, their right must 
be upheld to pick a government that is the 
choice of the popular majority. 
WORLD IN Focus: INTERVENTION VERSUS 
Aaeriossiox 
(By Pierre J. Huss) 
The Soviet Union, Red China, and Com-
munist Cuba never tire of branding U.S. 
military intervention in South Vietnam and 
in the Dominican Republic as "naked aggres-
sion." We are so accustomed to hearing this 
propaganda smear that we shrug it off. But 
the Reds know from the big lie technique 
that the oftener you tell a whopper the more 
will unconsciously sink into the minds of 
those you target as yonr next victim. 
To set the record straight, then, what is 
Intervention and aggression?especially if 
you put it in the light of the large-scale 
landing of U.S. Marines in the Dominican 
Republic? I ask one of the foremost ex-
erts in U.N. to answer that question, Am-
bassador Liu Chieh of Nationalist China.

U.S. DOMINICAN ACTION IS BOOST FOR 
VIETNAMESE 
(By Ray Cromley) 
President Johnson's quick, strong action 
in the Dominioan Republic may have a 
major effect on morale in Vietnam. 
A Vietnamese guerrilla fighter now in town 
says privately that "the United States Do-
minican stand is more significant to him 
than American raids in North Vietnam." 
The northern raids have boosted South 
Vietnamese confidence markedly. But there 
has still been the nagging fear these bomb-
ings may be part of a U.S. buildup in prepa-
ration for negotiations. There's a strong be-
lied in South Vietnam that negotiations mean 
defeat 
dent could afford to let Vietnam go down 
the drain. 
By the same token, this Dominican action 
may be discouraging to Hanoi. 
The nagging fear among South Vietnamese 
officials, military men, hamlet chiefs, police, 
and everyone else who has stuck his neck 
and his family's neck out in fighting the 
Communists, has been that the United States 
would pull out despite President Johnson's 
assurances to the contrary. 
BIG QUESTION 
The one question almost every Vietnamese 
I saw asked me on my trip through South 
Vietnam was, "Will the United States stay if 
the war is long and discouraging?" 
These men knew a pullout would mean 
death for themselves and their families at 
the hands of Communists. 
This worry about what the United States 
would do has not engendered courage. In 
some cases, it has meant that local officials 
hedged their bets and kept tightly to neu-
trality, straying neither to the Communist 
nor Government sides. 
The feeling that the United States would 
leave accounts in sizable measure for Cam-
bodia's Red China leanings, for Burma's 
careful leftist "neutrality," and for the cau-
tiousness of millions of uncommitted people 
in southeast Asia. 
SOMETHING ELSE 
Moving U.S. troops into the Dominican Re-
public, without &hilly shallying, to stop a 
Red thrust in that tiny country, is some-
thing else again. 
It means to this guerrilla fighter, and to 
other Vietnamese he is in contact with, that 
President Johnson really means to stop 
communism. 
Since Laos, they don't believe promises or 
speeches. 
But if Mr. Johnson is willing to stake U.S. 
prestige in the tiny Dominican Republic, 
then it's not likely, they reason, the Presi-
oxpEramarcz 
Experience in the mainland China and 
other Asian wars suggests that when the 
people are certain which side will win a war, 
they leap to that side in large numbers. 
Because of the Korean, mainland China, 
and Laos wars, there's a strong feeling in 
Asia that the United States is good at 
"quickie" fights, but that it wearies in long 
struggles. This feeling accounts for the be-
lief in many Asian minds that in the long 
run the Reds will win. 
The trickle of information from South 
Vietnam the past few days seems to indicate 
the Dominican action will help convince 
some doubters that the war is not in the 
Communist bag.

AN ERROR RECTIFIED 
It is now clear that the United States 
originally underestimated the role of Com-
munists in the Dominican Republic. But 
when the error was discovered, it acted 
swiftly with armed forces. 
That simplified analysis was made in in-
formed diplomatic circles in Washington over 
the weekend following the turbulent week of 
rioting and shooting in Santo Domingo. 
The United States sent nearly 5,000 marines 
and airborne troops into the island, solely to 
rescue American and other foreign citizens 
whose lives were endangered by the rising 
anarchy. President Johnson announced that 
4,500 additional marines and paratroops were 
being sent to the Republic. 
Some critics had been arguing that our 
military operation was larger than necessary, 
and was primarily intended to halt a rebel-
lion which threatened to open the way to 
Communist domination of the little nation. 
Actually, President Johnson's moves appear 
to have been based on both considerations. 
In his announcement that more troops were 
to be sent to Santo Domingo, President John-
son said their presence was necessary to se-
cure the island against communism, as the 
Red uprising had been taken over by Com-
munist conspirators directed from abroad. 
This would seem clearly to mean that 
Castro and his deadly crews are behind the 
anarchy in the Dominican Republic. Law 
and order broke down completely when re-
bellious army leaders who started the up-
rising acknowledged they could not control

Through the afternoon, the sheer need to 
find the guns hitting and wounding among 
them drove little teams of troopers to dart 
and seep into the back yards of the No Man's 
Land they could not cross frontally. By 
dusk, their firing had dirninshed the incom-
ing rounds to the point where I was again 
able to count the shots I heard (in 2 min-
utes, 62, including grenade blasts). By near-
darkness, a jeep brought us hamburgers and 
fresh water only a block behind the forward 
positions and we stood around filling our 
mouths and canteens without ducking. 
But then we tried to go back to the "front." 
It was Ruiz Street, and the rebel tank (de-
' Stroyed by 106-millimeter recoilless rifle fire 
'after it gunned off Trooper Richard Green's 
left leg) was still smoking over the body of 
its dead crewman. Here as we ran zig-zag 
across the street every one of us drew fire. 
("You run like a ballerina?pretty slow, if 
you know what I mean," one soldier told me 
with amusement and contempt.) 
'We can take care of those sniper jokers 
from down here," his sergeant reassured us, 
settling down on his elbow behind the earth

The body of a man in a yellow shirt, who had 
just been hit as he ducked behind the near-

The sergeant was grumbling that we still 
hadn't gotten the other sniper when the lieu-

said, low, "Consolidate across Caracas

"You mean, pull back the whole block?" 
asked the sergeant, rolling onto his other

003/10/15 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000500110003-2 
thought. Those were the chances against my 
locating in the Dominican Republic one man 
I'd known briefly 8 years before as a wounded 
lighter in Fidel Castro's Cuban -guerrilla 
forces. 
But there were some clues. One was the 
test of President Johnson's statement that 
the U.S. Government possessed hard evidence 
of Communist leadership in the Dominican 
rebel forces. 
The second, from a book I'd written, was an 
excerpt of my story as a U.S. reporter inside 
the Castro army between Thanksgiving and 
Christmas, 1958. Marked in the margin was 
a passage describing -a wounded, bearded of-
ficer who was "not even a Cuban but a Domi-
nican fighting Batista now so Castro's men 
can fight Trujillo later." The wounded man 
had been known as "Castro's boatman," pilot 
of the ill-fated Gramma when it landed Fidel 
and his 80-odd cohorts from Mexico onto the 
beaches of Cuba's Oriente Province in 1956. 
A CLUE IN THE NEWS 
The final clue was a clipping from the Na-
tional Observer, a report that Ramon Pichi-
rilo Mega, a Dominican who had served as 
helmsman of the Gramma, was now a secret 
rebel troop leader in his native land. 
If I did find him, I wondered why he would 
confirm publicly his being a flesh-and-blood 
link between two Yankee-go-home fighting 
foreles, one in Cuba and one in the Dominican 
Republic. But certainly there was no harm 
in asking. So I came to Santo Domingo. 
For a week in the bullet-scarred Caribbean 
city my search uncovered nothing. He was 
said, to be here, out; in the country, back in 
Cuba. He was said to be alive, dead, 
wounded, a Red propaganda story, an Amer-
ican propaganda story. 
It seemed I was on the right track, though. 
The PRD, the Constitutionalist Party of Col. 
Francisco Caamana Deno, exuded much of 
the; atmosphere I remembered with increas-
ing . vividness from Castro's 26th of July 
movement. There were the same unkempt 
and youthful hoods swaggering the littered 
streets with the same rifles. (This was 
literal in regard to the weapons, for many 
of the first Ficielistas were armed .with rifles 
they called "Santo Domingoes" after their 
place of manufacture in the Dominican Re-
public.) There was the same lip-twisted, 
sloganeering bitterness against the United 
States. 
HONEYMOON WITH THE PRESS 
Finally, at the rebel headquarters in the 
Copillo office building on Conde Street, there 
was the same honeymoon with the U.S. press 
that the Fidellstas, had once so profitably 
enjoyed. 
In vain, I heard veteran U.S. reporters who 
had covered the Castro story and were now 
in Santo Domingo warn their less experi-
enced colleagues how the tactic carbon-
copied other Red efforts. I remembered, too, 
the ;extreme to which the Fidelistas carried 
their we-have-nothing-to-hide-from-the-free 
press policy; they had once confided to my 
care, at a time when they knew I was going 
back. through Elatista's lines, a map correctly 
marked with their full troop deployments. 
Would this characteristic phase of candor 
existing here and now help my search for 
Castro's boatman? 
It developed that it would. 
While the American reporters daily came 
back and forth through the street barriers to 
rebel territory for press conferences, they 
continued to sleep and live back in the in-
ternational security zone. So, when I told 
Rafael Dominguen, erstwhile press secretary 
for exiled Juan Bosch and now the chief 
liaison from Colonel Caamano to the foreign 
press; that I wished to actually live with rebel 
fighting men in their zone for a few days, he 
seemed ,a little taken aback. But it was 
quickly arranged. They could prove the

That is why I am a revolutionary. 
only if the target is human, armed within 50 
yards and moving toward you." 
Then I started to take a picture?and the 
scene galvanized into shrill Latin hysteria. 
A gangling rebel with beagle-like features, 
black-rimmed glasses, and a loaded auto-
matic rifle objected volubly to what I was 
doing. His colleagues called him Four Eyes, 
he called me a perdida Yanqui, and my 
friends lost the argument. I made no photo-
graphs in the command post. 
A half-dozen of the men and I shortly 
went out to an emplacement of sandbags be-
side a roadblock at the corner of Cabral and 
Arzobizbomarino Streets, a rifle shot south 
of the U.S. paratroop line. In cloud-dimmed 
moonlight, I could see that the position had 
been chosen professionally and built to the 
recommendations of any military manual in 
print. Half was roofed with heavy timber 
and sheet metal, held in place 14 a double 
layer of sandbags; it could have protected 
most of us from light artillery and all from 
machinegun fire. There were ports for six 
riflemen. 
We had just settled down to sentry duty 
at the post?I was almost dozing as I sat on 
a broken concrete block?when three spaced 
single shots spun over nearby. An exploding 
flare overhead washed us in silver like statues. 
Both light and noise seemed to come from 
the no man's land beside us. There was no 
movement to be seen in the light, but as it 
faded, Four Eyes shrilly whispered something 
about the perdida Yanqui. I did not think 
it was a compliment. 
He was interrupted when several black 
wraiths soundlessly materialized on the street 
before us. Juan challenged, his "Halt" an 
octave higher than his speaking voice. 
"It is the inspecting party of our senior 
officer," Raul whispered to me, and then I 
could make out the figures. Even without 
Haul's identification, though, I would have 
known which was the commander from the 
on-balance stance on his wide bulk, and from 
the reassuring depth of his chuckle at some-
thing reported to him. Obviously, here was 
a man who had spent so many nights in this 
kind of tension that it was now his natural 
habitat. He murmured a sentence with the 
words la Americana. 
Juan whispered to me. "The comman-
dants asks if you want to see the most 
dangerous place on our lines." 
"I do," I whispered back, thinking after-
ward that the words from the marriage cere-
mony were a singularly inappropriate choice 
under the circumstances. 
"Then follow him." Juan moved me by

o'clock. I saw that "Four Eyes" was with 
them. He at once addressed me with weary 
hostility. 
"You see, it is just as I always say. All 
Americans are bad. Always." 
Juan raised his hand to "Four Eyes." He 
seemed offended more at his fellow rebel's 
manners than his sentiments, but he said, 
"Speak not so to her." 
This only sparked "Four Eyes" further. He 
said distinctly, "I will speak so. I say, all 
Americans are bad. All of them should be

The truth is that he was not very fright-

think you mean that. There are 190 million 
of us, Chico. You don't even intend to start 
with this one?" and I pointed to myself. 
"I would like to, only you are a woman

The threat was never finished. Moving so 
swiftly I don't know from which direction he 
came, Commandante Pichirilo suddenly stood 
rock steady between us. His face furious, he 
thrust me back into the vestibule with one 
hand, and "Pour Eyes" out into the street 
with the other. When he had seen "Four

me. He said, ''Till we meet again," and 
marched off himself without a backward 
glance. I left the rebel zone later that morn-
ing. 
Several days later, I sat down to write this 
story. Someone asked me: "Well, did you

To whatever extent there has e

Khrushchev's defeat in the Cuban missile 
crisis, the German issue was not affeCted 
by it. On the contrary, the attitude of the

has hardened in recent months. Their slan-

new negotiations about Germany. 
Notwithstanding this adamant posture of 
the 'U.S.S.R., it is a matter of great urgency 
that the problem of German national unity

Great Britain and France which, together 
with the Soviet Union, have assumed, under

WASHINGTON, D.C., 
May 19, 1965. 
Twenty years ago this month, Nazi Ger-
many capitulated and World War II ended 
in Europe. During the two decades that fol-
lowed its crushing defeat, Germany has 
undergone a profound transformation. With 
the help, support, and encouragement of the 
Western allies, especially the United States, 
Germany has become a prosperous country 
with a sound economy. What is more, it has 
also become a strong and healthy democracy. 
In sharp contrast with the political sit-
uation after the First World War, when 
chauvinistic, reactionary and radical ele-
ments undermined the Weimar Republic, the 
German people have repudiated militarism, 
extremism and all expansionist and aggres-
sive designs. They have established a  
stable-
parliamentary system and free institutions, 
including vigorous trade union movement. 
The change had been so complete that

AFL-CIO FIXFCIITIVE COUNCIL STATEMENT ON 
VIETNAM AND SANTO DOMINGO 
(Condensed) 
The executive council has considered the 
latest developments in war-ravaged Vietnam 
and in strife-torn Santo Domingo. We have 
examined the course pursued by President 
Johnson to end Communist aggression 
against the South Vietnamese and to prevent 
Communist subversion of the efforts of the 
Dominican people to return to constitutional 
government. The executive council, acting 
on reports from its own investigators on the 
spot, declares its unequivocal support of the 
measures, taken to date, by President John-
son to meet these critical situations. 
e The executive council welcomes the prompt 
e and energetic measures taken by the Presi-
? dent to prevent the Communist attempt to 
seize control of the Dominicat democratic 
revolUtionary movement and to foist a 
? Castro-type dictatorship on Santo Domingo. 
' Had our Government shown such prompt 
? initiative in 1959, Cuba would today be a 
free country and not a Communist slave 
state 
We reject as unfounded in fact the posi-
tion taken by Senator Goldwater and others 
that the President's Dominican policy is a 
throwback to old line gunboat diplomacy. 
Our Government's initiative is motivated ? 
solely by a determination to safeguard the 
lives of American and other nationals and to 
prevent a dangerous 'deterioration of the tb 
Dominican crisis which could lead to the Al 
establishment of another Communist regime 
and the slaughter of thousands. In sharp pa 
contrast to the gunboat diplomacy which ca 
often supported reactionaries and protected co 
private exploitation, President Johnson has pe 
offered to give unstinting economic assistance an 
to the Dominican people so that they may ba 
build a prosperous democracy and strengthen an 
The AFL-CIO has strongly voiced its "tin-
. equivocal support" of President John s? i's 
policies in Vietnam and the Dominican 
public and declared that the crises in. times 
eOttistrie4 are "interrelated" by the "filth 
001U2ans of Coramnaist imperialism." 
In a statement issued at its meeting in 
Washington, D.C., the federation's executive 
contscil assailed as !'unfounded" the positi 
-taken by former Senator Barry M. Goldwal er 
littd Others that the President's Dominic in 
dflcy is a throwback to old-line "gunbcat 
diplomacy." The president is neither sup-

United Nations good ?faces and its efforts

Organization of American States.

p 
the Dominican and ,Vietnamese Communists 
share the same fundamental purpose: to 
discredit our country and undermine its 
power as the strongest democratic barrier to 
the international Communist drive for world 
domination, 
Our country can never defeat the Com-
munist reactionaries by supporting other re-
actionaries or by relying solely on military 
means. The building of a strong democracy 
requires adequate social reforms and a 
healthy economy. It is the historic duty of 
the trade unions to play a decisive part in 
strengthening democracy and fostering social 
justice as the firmest barrier to Communist 
subversion and domination. The executive 
council supports President Johnson's efforts 
to help in the restoration of constitutional 
democratic government and the promotion 
of social reforms and economic progress in 
Santo Domingo. In this light, our Govern-
ment would be well advised to accord full 
diplomatic recognition only to a constitu-
tionally established Dominican democratic 
government. 
Even with the most generous assistance 
from our country, it will take much time, 
patience, and persistence to develop stable 
democratic institutions in South Vietnam 
and. Santo Domingo. Serious difficulties in 
the path of their democratic development 
are unavoidable because the Communist 
menace in both countries is continually sup-
ported by outside powers. In such grave 
situations, it is the responsibility of our 
country, which alone has the will and the 
power for deterring aggression, to take 
prompt and timely initiative in the interest 
of peace and freedom.

RIT AND THE CRISIS IN THE DOMINICAN 
REPUBLIC 
? (The following statement on the crisis in 
e Dominican Republic has been issued by 
turo Jituregui H., ORIT General Secretary.) 
ORIT appeals to wiser reflection on the 
rt of the combating forces in the Domini-
fl Republic so as to prevent their actions 
:ntinuing to cause victims among the 
ople, whose loss of life is already heavy 
d material damage enormous, thus setting 
ck considerably the already slow economic 
d social development of the country. 
During the hateful dictatorship of Trujillo, 
SIT condemned that regime and collabo-
ted both with trade unions and with other 
inocratic elements fighting to re-establish 
edom in the Dominican Republic. ORIT 
rmly welcomed the electoral victory of 
esident Juan Bosch, which brought back 
sistitutional government t6 the country. 
ter, it deplored the fact that military 
tion brought down such a hopeful regime. 
ese facts give us the moral authority to 
I publicly for a halt in the fratricidal 
uggle and appeal to all for calm, so as to 
ercome this dramatic crisis. 
MIT regrets that the Council of the OAS 
not carry out its peacemaking functions 
th the speed and energy required. If It 
cl done so, it might have avoided a worsen_ 
of the conflict particularly since the 
ta, headed by :Mr. Donald Reid Cabral, 
I convened presidential elections for next 
tember, which would have again giveli 
their national independence. 
The President deserves the full support of 
the people of our country and all Latin 
America in his tireless efforts to hasten the 
building of effective inter-American peace-
keeping machinery and achieve collective 
responsibility for normalizing the situation 
and assuring the Dominican people of the 
earliest opportunity to elect a government of 
their own free choice. The administration's 
acceptance of the U.N. good offices, along-
side of the OAS, in the Dominican crises, fur-
ther demonstrates Washington's earnest de-
sire to end the destructive conflict. 
The crises in Vietnam and Santo Domingo, 
though continents apart, are basically inter-
related. They must be faced in the context 
of the entire world crisis. To date, Castro 
has made three attempts to intervene in

It would also be unjust to call the steps 
-taken by the United States similar or equiv-
alent to earlier unilateral decisions which 
caused so much deterioration in inter-Amer-
ican relations. For this reason, we are con-
fident that U.S. participation, originally 
? 
inspired by humanitarian motives, will co-
operate with the OAS mission to bring an 
end to hostilities and will aid in the work of 
reestablishing democratic institutions for 
the Dominican people by means of effective 
suffrage, the only source of national sov-
ereignty. 
With the frankness and responsibility 
which always characterizes ORIT in its 
statements, we have to point out that the 
unilateral action by the armed forces of the 
United States in this serious Dominican con-
flict on the one hand has enabled thousands 
of persons to be saved and at the same time 
under the guidance of the OAS Commission 
has contributed to making the hostilities of 
civil war less cruel. The intervention by the 
United States has provoked a psychological 
and doctrinaire reaction corresponding to 
the traditional Latin American feeling about 
intervention of armed forces of one country 
in the internal affairs of another. This could 
have been avoided if there had been greater

intergovernmental organizations concerned, plenary sessions are public. When I spoke

Mr. Conoarao. As for myself, I, as a member 
of the Committee, not as Chairman, have no 
objection to answering the question by the 
Ambassador of Mexico, but as a matter of 
procedure for answers, I wish to provide an 
opportunity for the Chairman to speak in 
general terms in order not to deny the dis-
tinguished members of the Committee their 
legitimate right to answer as members of the 
Committee, which we all are; that is, I would 
not want to be monopolizing the answers be-
cause, without prejudice to a given answer, 
we can give another of the members of the

to any one who cares to make inquiry. But 
despite the respect that I owe to the opinion 
of the Diplomatic Corps, in order to estab-

owned as much as was the Ambassador with 
being able to verify this question?I wanted 
to go to the source; and we spoke with the 
different men who were in this rebel group-

the revolution, Colonel Caamafio, to some

flaked him in a friendly way whether he hon-

Be confirmed this to me, but he gave me the 
impression that he had the courage to face 
it. He said to me: "They are not going to 
grab the movement, and my concern is that

have stayed behind the snipers, today there 
are those that do not wish a solution for the

Approved For Release 
against the carrying out of the act of Santo 
Domingo, an element that history shows 
does not find a solution by peaceful means 
and that grows larger whenever attempts at 
reaching peace are made, because what will 
happen, to a great extent, is what happened 
to us, in parleying for peace, with an abso-
lute eease-fire by the commands so as to talk 
with the peace mission, but we had to parley 
for two hours and ahalf under incessant ma-
chine-gun and rifle fire. Who did that? 
Colonel Caarnatio? I think not, categorically 
no. 
It is the sniper ingredient, because in a 
town where arms are handed out to civilians, 
there can be only two forms of control: either 
when the civilians lay down their arms and 
surrender, them willingly, or when this is 
achieyed 1,3? a force superior to the civilian 
force. Let all of you ponder the difficult 
task of imaging a peace attempt, in which 
we again have the signatures of the two 
parties, we have the security zone, and the 
incident is being provoked as a factor break-
ing out into a tremendous catastrophe. I 
honestly confess that until now I could not 
explain how something much worse did not 
occur. The provocation of the snipers is 
constant. There are among them, no doubt, 
the two classes of snipers that there are in 
such events: those who grab a gun and con-
tinue using it with a resentment that no 
reasoning will lead them to lay it down, and 
those who continue using it with the resent-
ment of one who cannot control the revolt. 
That is, these are factors that cannot be 
controlled by a mission no matter what flag 
of peace it carries. 
The Ooyernment of Santo Domingo will 
not achieve peace until it can be imposed in 
a climate where conditions in a peaceful 
Santo Domingo exist for the recovery of in-
stitutional normality in the country. Sin-
cerely, Mr. Ambassador, in the choice that 
you have given me I sacrifice my wish?
which is equal to yours?to a realistic con-
cept that one can only appreciate, unfortu-
nately, by having been there. We wished, 
and we five ambassadors who were on the 
MisSiori mentioned it many times to one an-
other, that all of you could have been there, 
that not one had been missing, Mr. Presi-
dent. That you could have been at the scene 
of events to see what we were seeing. In 
the tremendous confusion, in which it is diffi-
cult to find the thread that would open the 
knot we were trying to untie, where there is 
political and military confusion, economic 
disaster, confused people, general anguish, 
no one can find the ingredient for guidance. 
I believe, Mr. Ambassador, that it is urgent 
to seek peace in the Dominican Republic 
and to tarry as little as possible in discussion, 
because every hour of discussion is an hour 
you give to someone who, with good or evil 
. intentions, could still pull the trigger that 
would prevent the Act of Santo Domingo 
from being fulfilled. This is my personal im-
pression. 
The PazsmENT. The Representative of 
Ecuador has nothing more that he wants 
to say? I recognize the Representative of 
Uruguay, Ambassador Emilio Oribe. 
Mr. Oases (the Special Delegate of Uru-
guay). Mr. President, first of all, I want to 
adopt the words of the distinguished Ambas-
sadors who have spoken before me in con-
gratulating the Committee on its work and 
expressing the admiration of my delegation 
for the way in which they have performed 
this first part of their task. And so, our 
warmest congratulations to all of them. 
Since it is late, Mr. President, I would like to 
confine myself to some very specific ques-
tions. The first of the questions is as fol-
lows: for this Meeting of Consultation to be 
competent to take measures to bring peace 
and to carry forward the work begun, it is 
necessary, above all, in the opinion of my 
Delegation, to ascertain whether the sttua-
t,ionnthepom4nican Republic is a situation 
that can endanger the peace and security of 
the hemisphere. This is the requirement of 
Article 19 of the Charter for carrying out col-
lective aotion in matters that normally are 
within the domestic jurisdiction of the 
states. As is known, Article 19 states: "Meas-
ures adopted for the maintenance of peace 
and security, in accordance with existing 
treaties do not constitute a violation of the 
principles set forth in Articles 15 and 17," 
which are those that refer to noninterven-
tion. Hence my Delegation believes that a 
pronouncement must be made by this Meet-
ing of Consultation to the effect that the 
evEtnts in the Dominican Republic constitute 
a situation that endangers the peace and 
security of the hemisphere. Departing from 
that basis, I should like to ask the Commit-
tee if it is of the opinion that this is the 
case, that is to say, that the situation in the 
Dominican Republic constitutes a threat to 
the peace and security of the hemisphere. 
That is the first question. 
The second question is as follows, Mr. 
President: the first part of the task with 
which the Committee was entrusted has been 
carried out, 8,nd we all congratulate them. 
We have received a very complete report, 
Which will be studied by the delegations and 
the foreign ministries. There remains, then, 
the second part of the Committee's task, 
under the letter b,, which reads as follows: 
"to carry out an investigation of all aspects 
of the situation in the Dominican Republic 
that led to the convocation of this Meeting." 
Naturally, my Delegation understands very 
well that this cannot be done in one after-
noon or one day. However, I should like to 
ask simply if the Committee believes that 
there is sufficient evidence to issue a report 
on this point within a reasonable period of 
time. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, 
The PRESMENT. One of the distinguished 
members of the Committee would like to 
refer to the first question put by the Repre-
sentative of Uruguay. Ambassador Vazquez 
Carrizosa, Representative of Colombia. 
Mr. VAZQUEZ CARRIZOSA (the Special Dele-
gate of Colombia). Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man. The first question is this: Is the situa-
tion such that it can endanger peace and 
security? My reply is yes. Yes, there is a 
situation that endangers the peace and secu-
rity. The reasons are very clear. A dis-
turbance or even a guerrilla action in a mem-
ber state where the elements of order and 
constituted authorities exist is not the same 
as in a state where the absence of the state 
Is noted, evaluated, and recorded. What is 
to be done, Mr. Delegate, in the absence of 
the state? W:hat does the system do when 
the state does not; exist? What happens 
when blood is running in the streets? What 
happens, Mr. Delegate, when an American 
country?and I am going to speak quite 
frankly so that you may think about this 
with all the perspicacity we know you to 
have?is, under these conditions, in the 
neighborhood of Cuba? Do we sit on the 
balcony to watch the end of the tragedy? 
Do we all sit down as if we were at a bull-
fight; waiting for the crew to come? What 
are we to do, Mr. Delegate? We are in a 
struggle against international communism; 
and we are in a world, Mr. Delegate, in which 
America is not even separated from the other 
continents even by the ocean. We form part 
of the world and we form part of the condi-
tions existing in the world. The Dominican 
Republic, like any other country in the 
Americas, is a part of the system, and it is 
the system that will suffer from the lack of 
a head of state in any of its members. The 
matter and the problem cannot be expressed 
in juridical terms, in hermeneutics, needed 
to fit an act into a lawyer's criterion. The 
problem is one of deep political meaning, of 
profound significance, of hemisphere impor-
tance much more serious than any of the 
other American revolution could be

August 23, 1965 
There have been many revolutions in 
America.._ There have been revolutions in 
my country; there have been some, I believe, 
in yours, and I do not believe that a revolu-
tion in itself justifies the intervention of the 
inter-American system. That has not been 
my theory; that has not been the theory of 
my country. However, the acephalous con-
dition. of the state constitutes a problem that 
has occurred on very few occasions. What 
are we to do, Mr. Delegate, when, as the 
report states, the President of a Junta says: 
"I cannot maintain order with respect to the 
diplomatic missions"? And what are we to 
do, Mr. Delegate, when that Chief presents 
a note in which he requests the assistance 
of another country and confesses with the 
sincerity that we have heard: "Gentlemen 
of the Special Committee, have the diplo-
matic representatives asked me for protec-
tion and I did not have the elements with 
which to protect them?" That is the answer 
to his first question. Now we have the sec-
ond question: What is happening to the 
Investigation? It is very clear, Mr. Delegate. 
The complex political events, the multi-
tudinous situations are very difficult to in-
vestigate. All of us who have had contact 
with problems of criminology know about 
mob psychology: everything that is studied 
in the classroom, which is very simple, an 
investigation of a local event, an individual 
event, let us say. 
However, when there as mobs, when they 
are in the midst of great movements an 
investigation can be conducted, investiga-
tions must be carried out. But they are 
obviously difficult investigations. I would 
spare no effort to support any machinery, 
agency, or committee that would carry for-
ward that investigation. It would be very 
desirable. But, of dourse, such investiga-
tions of complex events are not very easy, 
because many things have happened. Actu-
ally, two or three revolutions have taken 
place. There was the first revolt of colonels. 
Then there was a revolt of a party; and after 
that, a revolution of a whole series of guer-
rilla groups, so that each one May have a 
different impression of the same event. 
I think that, rather than an investigation 
of the past, what is of interest to the Meeting 
of Consultation and what is of interest to 
America is not the investigation of the past, 
but the investigation of the future. It is 
the investigation of the future that interests 
us. The problem is not to stop to fix re-
sponsibility, to ascertain who began to shoot 
first, who entered the National Palace first, 
who opened the windows, who got out the 
machinegun, who saw, who heard; all that 
would be an interminable process that would 
fill many pages and maty records of pro-
ceedings. The important thing is not to 
look backward, but to look ahead. 
The PRESIDENT. The Representative of 
Uruguay. 
Mr. ORIBE. I thank Ambassador Vazquez 
Carrizosa for his remarks. He has told me 
just what I wanted to know. 
The PRESIDENT. The Ambassador of Brazil. 
Mr. PENNA MARINHO (the Special Repre-
sentative of Brazil) . Yes, Mr. President. And 
I also Want to say to the Delegatesthat my 
reply is also yes. There are two governments, 
but each one is weaker than the other, com-
pletely incapable and powerless to control 
the situation that prevails in the country. 
Peace was made on uncertain terms. The 
Act of Santo Domingo is not a definitive 
peace; it is a difficult truce, a temporary 
armistice that may dissolve at any moment. 
Therefore, the Committee suggests, among 
th,e measures that in its judgment might be 
adopted immediately by the Tenth Meeting 
of Consultation, the appointment of a tech-
nical military group in the city of Santo 
Dinning? to supervise the cease-fire, as well 
as other measures agreed to by the parties 
to the Act of Santo Domingo. We must keep 
'watch over that peace and create conditions 
to prevent the struggle from breaking out

again?because it could start again, Mr. 
President, at any moment. Thank you. 
The PRESIDENT. Does any other member of 
the Committee wish to speak on this ques-
tion? The Chairman of the Committee, Am-
bEssador Colombo. 
Mr. COLOMBO. The truth is, Mr. Chairman, 
that after the words of my distinguished col-
leagues, the Ambassadors of Brazil and Co-
lombia, there is very little that I might be 
able to add; but the responsibility in-
volved and the importance of the question, so 
ably phrased by the Ambassador of Uruguay, 
compel all of us to make clear our position 
on this question. When, among the powers 
and duties, the duty of investigating was 
decided upon, I cannot conceal the fact that 
I felt the same as I always feel whenever an 
investigating committee is named. General-
ly it investigates nothing; few, indeed, are 
the investigating or factfinding committees 
which, in the parliamentary life of all of our 
countries, show any fruitful jurisprudence in 
their results. But this Investigating Com-
mittee did have the possibility of good re-
sults. And that was because it was aimed at 
two fundamental objectives that were gov-
erning events in the Dominican Republic. 
I understood, first, that the investigation 
was to determine the scope of the danger re-
sulting from the events, which are a matter 
of concern to the Ambassador of Uruguay. 
If this was a situation that did not threaten 
the peace, we would verify that immediately. 
If the situation was under the control of 
groups intent on stirring up tension in the 
Americas, in a struggle in the history of 
America, which is full of struggle between 
brothers, in this incorrigible vocation that is 
periodically written into the history of our 
countries, that delays the advance of law and 
democracy, then we would verify it immedi-
ately; and we have verified it. 
This could be the beginning of a struggle 
confined to the two well-defined groups. But 
the presence of those uncontrollable factors, 
which I urge the Ambassadors to analyze in 
detail, in the evaluation of facts in order to 
reach conclusions, they are going to be 
Impressed, as we ourselves were impressed, 
without seeing them; they have become more 
dangerous than the groups themselves put 
together. To my mind, they have become the 
element that will determine the fate of what 
Is going to be done. If those groups did not 
exist, and if those responsible for the strug-
gling movements had not confessed that they 
cannot control them, in view of the exist-
ence of a security zone, freely agreed upon 
by both parties, with a U.S. military force 
that is engaged basically in the process of 
keeping custody over the diplomatic zone. 
I would also believe, Mr. President, that per-
haps we might be able to delimit the process 
and trust that the peace Would not be so 
obviously jeopardized as it is in this process; 
because in all revolutions, even a small local 
One, there is the possibility that there may 
be the spark of a process that will affect the 
peace of the Americas. 
But the dimensions of this situation, with 
elements of disturbance on both sides, who 
are constantly lashing out against the pro-
tection Offered by the security zone, and in 
which, Mr. President?and this struck my 
attention?there is still control to prevent 
confrontation in a struggle that could tech-
nically be called a military struggle; or in 
other words, there is no military confronta-
tion between the defenders of the zone and 
the contending groups of the civil struggle. 
And that struggle is capable of being un-
loosed, because of the constant harassment 
by those who are seeking a way to unloose it. 
Hence, Mr. Ambassador, this matter urgently 
demands that all of us succeed in finding the 
way to resolve this situation; that we find 
the way to dispel the undeniable danger that 
threatens the peace in this hemisphere, which 
is the puropse of our organization. Because 
all of these things are important; economic 
development, social tranquillity, justice, the 
progress of the countries; but all of them are 
built on peace; without peace there is no 
possibility for the triumph of the inter-
American system. There cannot be the 
slightest doubt, Mr. President, that the peace 
of the hemisphere is in grave peril. 
But with respect to the second part of the 
investigation, which is also a matter of 
anxiety, we have contributed something in 
the time we had to make our investigation; 
more than the investigation is the word of 
the leaders themselves. This act is a con-
fession, and a partisan confession without 
proof, Mr. Ambassador. It is not a matter of 
our characterizing the ideology, nobody goes 
about trying to do that when, actually, it has 
already been characterized by the leaders of 
the governments themselves. If necessary, 
that should be left to the last. I have said 
at previous sessions: my delegation is will-
ing to make and is going to make an ex-
haustive investigation of the facts, in order 
to determine the blame according to the 
action. We shall do nothing to cover up a 
sharing of responsibility. But in the matter 
of priorities, investigation has been well 
placed by the Ambassador of Uruguay. The 
first thing to be investigated was the projec-
tion of the episode, the possibility of its af-
fecting the peace of the hemisphere, the 
need for urgent action in case it is proved. 
We five members of the committee shared 
that opinion when we were there, and we 
reaffirm it now. The peace of the hemis-
phere is in such danger, Mr. President, that 
If the system does not respond to the call of 
both parties to the struggle, I believe that 
the peace of the Americas would not be in 
danger, that peace will be broken. This ur-
gency is shown by the way we have tried to 
answer the concerns of the Ambassador of 
Uruguay. 
The PRESIDENT. I ask His Excellency the 
Ambassador of Guatemala if he would like to 
speak on this point. 
Mr. GARCIA BAITER. Mr. President, I would 
like to add my voice and my opinion to those 
of my distinguished colleagues on the Com-
mittee. I shall also reply, rather emphati-
cally, as was done by the Ambassador of 
Colombia, that the peace and security are in 
danger. As was already said, we in the Com-
mittee often asked ourselves and commented 
on the advisability of having all of the mem-
bers of this Meeting visit the Dominican 
Republic in order to see, on the scene itself of 
the events, the situation prevailing in that 
country: in a state of war, when we arrived, 
without water, witheut lights, without tele-
phones, without public services. The lobby 
of the very hotel where we stayed was a scene 
of war?children and women sleeping in the 
lobby itself. The Diplomatic Corps, which 
met with us, also told us of the serious situ-
ation which they had gone through and were 
going through; anarchy ruled; the attacks 
that the diplomatic missions themselves had 
suffered; the wounded, including the diplo-
matic missions that had given asylum to 
wounded persons; and this was something 
that went on hour after hOur. 
Undoubtedly, peace and security are seri-
ously affected when there is no authority 
that is respected, for although there are 
those who proclaim that they represent au-
thority in each sector, it may be seen later 
that they do not possess it to such a degree 
that peace prevails; and although they sign 
documents, such as the cease-fire that was 
arranged before we arrived, or the Act of 
Santo Domingo, which we signed; neverthe-
less, it can be seen that they have no abso-
lute control over the situation when the 
spectacle of wounded and dead persons is 
seen. We asked how many had died, how 
many had been wounded; and I believe that 
I can say, as an opinion gathered from per-
sons of whom it can be said, insofar as this is 
possible, that they are better informed on the 
matter, that at least one thousand five hun-
dred persons have died in Santo Domingo.

And how are the farces distributed? Row .1 
the Country? Fighting has taken place so 
far only in the city of Santo Domingo itself, 
but who can assure us that it will not Spred 
throughout the country? 
'The rebel command states that they have 
Maintained peace there, because they have 
not wished to arouse feelings, in the rest pf 
the country, and the Military Junta in San 
Isidro States that they control the rest of Vue 
dotialtry. What is the real situation? T 
'Committee did not, have time to travel 
through all of the Dominican Republic; but 
it is. evident that chaos exists, that the situ-
ation ts deteriorating; it changes from ()le 
hong tathe next; that is clear. The day after 
.We had an interview, under the fire of sple-
en, as has been said,here?With the ConS14-
tatiOnallet Military Command, the next cir y, 
I repeat, the Chief of that Command was 
#roeleiimed President of the Republic, Co a-
Stitufiqjual Presiderit;, and the Military Junta 
. Situation as they saw it; although we asked 
the disputing groups also to explain to the 
Committee and to the Meeting what they 
considered the truth about the Dominican 
Republic, and also asked the governors of the 
provinces whom we interviewed to do the 
same, and did likewise with everyone ? with 
, whom we had an opportunity to talk and 
? question; although we sought all of the evi-
dence that ,might serve as a basis for this 
Investigation and to enable the Committee 
, to offer its conclusions to this Meeting of 
Consultation; despite all this, the time was 
. very short and we cannot give conclusions 
, in the report we have just submitted, not 
even if we were to be able to change them a 
. little later. 
, Points of view have been given and infor-
mation collected, sometimes in personal con-
versations, as mentioned by the Ambassador 
. of Argentina with respect to his conversation 
with Colonel Caamalio, or in converse-
? tions the members of the Committee had 
with various persons on the scene; but we 
should also listen to all parties concerned, to 
. all who want to say something; and such an 
Investigation takes some time. This is the 
reply we must give to the Ambassador of 
. Uruguay. With respect to this second point, 
we have done all that we could within the 
short time available, in an attempt to make 
? the cease-fire effective for the protection of 
? refugees and those who had taken asylum, 
and so that food distribution could be un-
dertaken, to bring in food, medicines, etc., 
? that can be distributed with the necessary 
? safety. We did a vast amount of work in 
? a very short time, but in regard to investiga-
tion, we can say that we have scarcely begun. 
And despite the little that was seen, the 
Committee has been able to contribute 
something in reply to the questions that 
? have been asked here. 
The PRESIDENT. I understand that the 
Representative of Uruguay is very well satis-
fied the thorough manner in which the 
Interesting questions put to the members of 
the Committee have been answered. 
Mr. ORB/E. Of course, Mr. President, I 
would like to express my appreciation once 
again, and I believe that what has now been 
' said here is fundamental; because the con-
viction of the members of the Committee 
will surely allow us, through consultation, 
to take appropriate measures without getting 
Into the problem of intervention

The PRESIDENT. I recognize the Special 
Delegate of Paraguay, Ambassador Yodice. 
Mr. Yawns. Thank you, Mr. President. 
' First, I wish to join in the words of apprecia-
tion that have been spoken here to the am-
bassadors who composed our special com-
mittee that traveled to Santo Domingo and 
completed the great task of which we are so 
proud. I am vett happy that from the .first 
time the floor was requested until now we 
have had a series of statements from the 
distinguished ambassadors on the Commit-
tee, and their statements make my congrat-
ulations even warmer. As the Chairman of 
the Committee, the, illustrious Ambassador 
of Argentina, Dr. Ricardo Colombo, has said, 
this is the nnernent of truth_ailii_the Delega-
tion, of Paraguay is quite pleased with the 
. Re-tit:m.0f the members of the Committee. 
The Delegation of Paraguay, Mr. President, 
is proud of this Committee because it has, 
in the first place, effectively carried out the 
peacemaking aspect of its mission as fully as 
is possible; it is proud of this Committee 
because it has justified the confidence of 
the Paraguayan Delegation placed in it, in-
asmuch as the distinguished ambassadors 
who composed it, whose ability and inter-
American spirit all of us know, as was said 
when the committee's membership was ap-
proved, would determine whether or not in-
ternational communism had a part in the 
bloody events in the Dominican Republic.

' hen of,the ,iplomatic Corps to give us their 
, 
views In writing, that is, their views on the 
matter, I would have done so. Imight, how-
ever, have put it differently, since I would 
not have confined myself to inquiring as to 
the possibility of' Communist intervention 
in a specific group, but would have extended 
the inquiry to all aspects of the serious con-
flict that the Dominican people are under-
going today. 
The Government of Paraguay, as I stated 
clearly when approval was given to the es-
tablishment of the collective inter-American 
force, believed from the beginning that con-
tinental security was at stake, The replies 
by the Ambassadors composing the Commit-
tee reporting today on certain questions re-
garding these delicate aspects of the Domini-
can situation have been categorical. My 
government was right. Continental security 
is threatened. The danger existed, and still 
exists, that chaos and anarchy will permit 
international communism to transform the 
Dominican Republic into another Cuba 
With his customary clarity, courage, and en-
ergy, the Ambassador of Colombia, Mr. Al-
fredo Vazquez Carrizosa, has categorically 
mentioned the highly political nature of the 
problem we are facing. In reply to a ques-
tion of the Ambassador of Uruguay, he has 
rightly said that the peace of America is 
threatened, that the security of the hemi-
sphere is threatened, and that there is a pos-
sibility that another Cuba, another Com-
munist government in the hemisphere will, 
arise out of the chaos and anarchy in the 
Dominican Republic. 
We are proud of the action of our commit-
tee, because, as the Ambassador of Uruguay 
said, it is helping to clarify the problem we 
are facing. Paraguay had no doubts when 
It voted on the resolution for the establish-
ment ' of the inter-American force. As I 
said: "The Government of Paraguay ap-
proves the sending of U.S. forces to the Do-
minican Republic, considering that this does 
not imply armed intervention prejudicial to 
the right of self-determination of the Do-
minican people, but, on the contrary, that 
it is a measure of hemispheric defense 
against the intervention of Castro-Commu-
nist forces. The Government of Paraguay is 
aware that U.S. armed intervention has been 
necessary in view of the urgency of prevent-
ing extracontinental and Cuban forces and 
funds from annulling the Dominican peo-
ple's right of self-determination, since it 
was evident that it would be difficult for the 
inter-Americaa system to act rapidly and 
energetically. The Government of Paraguay 
reaffirms its support of the proposed estab-
lishxnent of a hemispheric force and will 
participate in it if a substantial majority of 
the governme:nts of the member states do 
likewise." . 
Mr. President, if there is anything to re-
gret it is that, for the time being, this valu-
able, clear explanation of the seriousness 
of the Dominican problem furnished to us 
by our committee is known only to the dele-
gates of this Meeting of Consultation. 
Obviously w.e are going to come to a mo-
ment when the enlightened judgment of the 
President and of the Delegates, in my opin-
ion, will decide that these vital conclusions 
reached by our Committee should be known ' 
by all of the Americas, by all of the people 
of the hemisphere. Because for my Dele-
gation, Mr. President, these conclusions, 
which appear in the written report and in 
the replies to the questions posed here, 
should not be known only by the Delegates; 
they should be known by all the people. I 
emphasize this point because I am proud 
that my Delegation, from the very beginning, 
has been concerned and has established a 
position with regard to the seriousness of 
the conflict, in view of the intervention of 
international communism in the Dominican 
events. 
Once more, I congratulate the members of 
our Committee; I am confident that the 
conclusions they now bring to us from their

trip to Santo Domingo and that they will 
continue to bring will greatly help this Meet-
ing of Consultation. The inter-American 
system must find the permanent solution re-
ferred to by the distinguished Ambassador 
of Ecuador in order to bring about a return 
of constitutionality in the sister Dominican 
Republic, a return of the reign of representa-
tive democracy and of human rights, and of 
all those inalienable principles of sovereign 
peoples that motivate the resolutions of this 
Meeting of Consultation in dealing with the 
Dominican problem. I believe, Mr. Presi-
dent, that with the clarity of the conclu-
sions of the Committee we shall be walking 
on firmer ground. The basic conclusion that 
I want drawn from this statement I am now 
making is that we should act on the basis 
of these important conclusions furnished to 
us by the Committee; not only the conclu-
sions appearing in the report that has been 
distributed, but also those verbally expressed 
tonight by the members of the Committee. I 
repeat my congratulations to the ambassa-
dors and my confidence that these highly 
important conclusions will shortly be brought 
to the attention of all the Americas. Many 
thanks, Mr. President. 
Mr. TEJERA PARIS (the Special Delegate of 
Venezuela). Mr. President, I wish to make 
a motion. 
The PRESIDENT. What is the motion of the 
Ambassador of Venezuela? 
Mr. TEJTRA PARIS. Mr. President, two days 
ago when it was desired to undertake a thor-
ough analysis of the problem, I asked this 
distinguished meeting to await the return of 
the Committee, so that we might question 
it and hear what proved to be an excellent 
and highly important report. On behalf 
of My government, I wish to express apprecia-
tion for the work that has been done and the 
sacrifices that have been made. I now wish 
to call attention to the following point: 
perhaps this session should devote itself ex-
clusively to questions and answers, so that 
by speeding things up we can obtain the in-
formation as precisely as possible, leaving 
basic statements and studies of possible 
solutions until tomorrow's plenary; other-
wise, we shall have to repeat many of the 
things already said here. This is my mo-
tion, Mr. President. 
highly important factor in the cease-fire that 
has been obtained and that a clear delinea-
tion of this zone and knowledge of it, not 
ust by the parties involved but by everyone, 
will be very helpful in forming an idea of 
what might happen if, as may be feared, this 
security zone were violated. If acceptable 
to the Committee, I would request, Mr. Presi-
dent, that this plan not only be incorporated 
into the Act, but also circulated by the sec-
retariat as soon as possible. 
The PRESIDENT. I ask; I imagine that the 
Chairman of the Committee wishes to reply 
to Ambassador Magnet's question. 
Mr. Cc:4,mm?, The Committee, through me, 
reports that the map is now being distrib-
uted, and I apologize to the Ambassador of 
Chile because it was not attached to the re-
port when this was distributed. The expla-
nation may lie in the undeserved expression 
of appreciation for the Committee's work, 
on the part of the Ambassador. Material 
difficulties prevented distribution, but I now 
present the map to the Chair so that, as the 
Ambassador of Chile has wisely requested, it 
may be distributed as soon as possible, since 
It is necessary for the proper information of 
the Ambassadors. 
The PRESIDENT. The Chair shall proceed 
accordingly, Mr. Chairman, Ambassador Co-
lombo. 
Mr. MAGNET. I wish to explain that my 
words did not imply the slightest criticism 
or reproach of the Committee. 
Mr. COLOMBO. I wish to make quite clear 
that I have not even remotely suspected 
such an attitude from one whom I know to 
be a gentleman and distinguished ambassa-
dor who honors the inter-American system. 
The PRESIDENT. Your second question, Mr. 
Ambassador. 
Mr. MAGNET. It is more than a question, 
Mr. President, to try to achieve some kind of 
friendship. I think it is quite clear both 
from the text and the context of the report 
we have just had the pleasure of hearing, 
especially the Act of Santo Domingo?with 
which we were already acquainted and which 
is contained in the report signed on May 5?
that there is not, nor was there on that date 
a constituted government in the Dominican 
Republic able to represent the country, but 
two parties or conflicting factions. The 
committee, with the knowledge it gained 
through its on-the-spot activity, and with 
its spirit of impartiality, deemed it neces-
sary to hear the two parties or factions in 
order to reach some useful result. I would 
like to ask the Chairman of the Committee, 
through you Mr. President, if the evidence 
that has been gathered corresponds to the 
truth. 
The PRESIDENT. Shall I refer the question 
to the Chairman or to the distinguished 
members of the Committee? 
Mr. Colomso. I think that, in substance, 
we have already answered the Ambassador's 
question. That is, all of us Committee mem-
bers have confirmed the impression of chaos 
that we found in the Dominican Republic, 
the complete lack of authority, the existence 
of two groups that appeared to be standard-
bearers in the conflict and with whom we felt 
impelled to establish immediate contact. 
I do not know if this will satisfy the Ambas-
sador, and I wish he would let me know if he 
has any doubts that I can clear up. 
The PRESIDENT. What does the Ambassador 
of Chile have to say? 
Mr. MAGNET. It seems to me that what the 
Ambassador has said confirms what I?
Mr. COLOMBO. I think it is the same thing, 
Mr. Ambassador. 
The PRESIDENT. Is there any other ques-
tion? Mr. Ambassador. 
Mr. MAGNET. If it is not an imposition on 
you or on the meeting, Mr. President, I won-
der if it would be too much to ask the Com-
mittee to tell us how many asylees or refu-
gees still remain in the embassies in Santo 
Domingo, if it has been able to obtain this 
Information. 
The PRESIDENT. Mr. Ambassador, the Chair 
entirely agrees with you. It would really be 
interesting to devote ourselves to question-
ing the honorable Committee and its distin-
guished members, and the answers that they 
give us will be very edifying. 
Time goes on, and we must take advantage 
of the privacy of this meeting precisely to 
present this type of questions and, in this 
same confidential setting, to obtain the an-
swers of the distinguished Committee mem-
bers. Naturally, the occasion will come for 
us to make detailed statements on behalf of 
our governments on the text of the impor-
tant report presented by our colleagues on 
the Committee. I offer the floor to the Rep-
resentative of Chile. 
Mr. MAGNET (the Special Delegate of Chile) . 
Thank you, Mr. President. The opinion that 
the President has just expressed so wisely 
is in complete accord with what I am about 
to say now. Although, for reasons clearly ex-
plained at the time, the Delegation of Chile 
abstained from voting for the establishment 
of the committee that has now returned to 
our midst, I can do no less than corroborate, 
briefly but sincerely, the expressions of praise 
that the committee has earned. Moreover, 
the position taken by my country does not 
inhibit me, for everyone's benefit, from ask-
ing some questions that are of interest to my 
country, and, as I understand, to the others 
as well. In the Act of Santo Domingo, re-
ferred to by the President in his Statement, 
mention is made of a security zone in that 
city, whose limits would be indicated in a 
plan appended to this document. Mr. Presi-
dent, I believe that this security zone Is a 
Mr. CoLosiso. The truth is that at this 
time, Mr. Ambassador, it is impossible to 
answer your question because, fortunately, 
the evacuation of asylees has already started. 
I have information regarding the asylees at 
my embassy: there were 14 who have already 
been able to leave. That is, this changes ac-
cording to the help received, food and other, 
because the asylees take advantages of arriv-
ing planes in order to arrange their trans-
portation; therefore, at this moment it would 
be practically impossible?because of the 
time that has elapsed since our arrival?to 
say how many asylees have been able to leave 
the country. Fourteen have left my embassy. 
The PRESIDENT. Is the Ambassador satis-
fied? 
Mr. MAGNET. I hope I am not being too in-
sistent, Mr. President, but perhaps with the 
testimony of the other members of the Com-
mittee we might obtain an approximate fig-
ure, at least. 
The SPECIAL DELEGATE OF BRAZIL. Mr. Am-
bassador of Chile. I wish to inform you that 
in the Embassy of Brazil there were thirty-
eight asylees, of which only six wished to 
leave the Dominican Republic. The other 
thirty-two told us that they would prefer to 
await the return of normal conditions in 
their country. Therefore, only six asylees in 
our embassy left the Dominican Republic. 
The PRESIDENT. Does Ambassador Vasquez 
Carrizosa wish to contribute anything? 
Mr. VASQUEZ Csamoss (the Special Dele-
gate of Colombia). There were about 30 
asylees in the Embassy of Colombia in Santo 
Domingo, some of whom did not wish to 
leave Dominican territory. Many of them, 
especially women and children, left on May 5 
on the plane that brought in food, medicine 
and medical equipment. 
The PREIDENT. The Ambassador of Guate-
mala. 
Mr. GARCIA BAT/ER. There were 28 asylees at 
the Embassy of Guatemala, of whom nine 
left. There are now 19 asylees at present 
who will be evacuated as soon as possible on 
the plane arriving from Guatemala with food 
and medicines. The Secretariat has already 
been informed of this. 
Mr. MAGNET. Mr. President, I wish to leave 
on record my gratification and to pay public 
tribue to the patriotism of the Dominicans, 
since so many of them have chosen not to 
abandon their country, in spite of the pre-
vailing chaos. 
The PRESIDENT. We give the floor to the 
Representative of El Salvador, Ambassador 
Clairmont Duefias. 
Mr. CLAIRMONT DUEOTAS (the Special Dele-
gate of El Salvador). Thank you Mr. Presi-
dent. I am going to ask a question, 
wish at this time to express by government's 
appreciation for the excellent work of the 
Committee in the face of the tragic events 
in the Dominican Republic. Our thanks, 
gentlemen. The question is as follows, and 
I wish to refer to the distribution of weapons 
to the civilian population. I wish to ask the 
members of the Committee whether they 
then had sufficient time to investigate how 
this distribution was made, what was the 
source, if it is known, whether distribution 
was made indiscriminately or to persons of 
any special tendencies, and who were the 
originators of this distribution. Thank you 
very much. 
The PRESIDENT. I refer the question to the 
members of the Committee. The Ambassa-
dor of Brazil, if you please. 
Mr. PENNA Msammo. Mr. President, I wish 
to reply to the question posed by the Am-
bassador of El Salvador, and I do this on 
precarious bases, because the information 
we received was precarious, and, above all, 
contradictory. There was, however, a com-
mon consensus in these replies, that the 
arsenal of weapons had been opened, access 
to it was given to the population, and that 
the civilian population, a part of which was 
controlled by Colonel Caamafio, was armed 
with automatic weapons considered by sev-

Which would have been very valuable. When 
we were about to leave, in connection with 
the activities reported on in our dispatch, 
our report, the only part on which we ob-
tained a reply that would help allay the 
Ambassador's fears was given by the United 
States, when the Ambassador of the United 
States in Santo Domingo told me that many 
of_those who are arriving in the security zone 
bring arms with them and turn them in. I 
tried to go further into this question to as-
certainthe number of arms. The reply was 
not definite. I was told merely that this was 
a report that he had received from General 
Palmer, who had told the Ambassador of the 
United States that they had a certain 
amount of arms that were being turned in 
by people who were arriving in the zone for 
diverse reasons, many of whom were coming 
in search of food or medical care and who 
were voluntarily turning in their weapons. 
This IS the only thing I can say, but I believe 
that I have contributed something to allay 
yours fears, Mr. Ambassador; nothing more. 
Ur. TEJERA PARIS. Thank you very much, 
Mr. President. The other question would 
be this: I was very favorably impressed and 
feel optimistic at the fact that the Com-
mittee.noted among both the Constitution-
alists and the rebels a fervent desire to have 
the OAS intervene to seek a solution; and 
that even, according to what I think I heard 
the Chairman of the Committee say, Colonel 
Caamafio himself said that he rejected the 
Security Council solution and preferred an 
OAS solution, because it belongs to the sys-
tem. Now I should like to ask you this: 
Did the Committee explore the possibility, 
or did it hear of any methodology of any 
special system, for example, the presence of 
a high commission of eminent persons or a 
high commission of good offices that could 
assist In returning the country to consti-
tutional normalcy now? Does the Commit-
tee believe that there would be some possi-
bility that such a solution would be ac-
ceptable to all the bands in conflict? I 
understand that now there is another change 
In the country. 
The PRESIDENT. I refer the question to the 
Committee members. Mr. Vazquez Carri-
zoea, please. 
Mr. VAZQUEZ CARRIZOSA. it Is still prema-
ture to go into that. Of course, we can find 
evidence of contact, points of common ref-
erence, but within an atmosphere of tension 
-and anxiety such as surrounded us, it is 
difficult right now to think of formulas for 
a government that might unite the two 
parts, I do not exclude It as a possibility 
for the future, but apart from a similar 
reference to the Organization of American 
States, I think it is impossible for the Com-
mittee (although my colleagues may believe 
otherwise) to answer that question more 
precisely. No system came into view. The 
thing is it was not our job to investigate 
political conditions of a new government. 
Our Mission, which was precisely set forth 
by the resolution of May 1, was to obtain a 
cease-fire, guarantees for the departure of 
refugees, and safe conditions for the em-
bassies, and also to organize humanitarian 
aid. Moreover, the terms of the resolution 
of May 1 did not authorize us to enter into 
discussions of matters that are the concern 
of the .Dotaittican people, and personally, 
my theory is that our mission was essentially 
to bring about peace?not to prejudge the 
will of the Dominicans regarding their own 
future; at least, that is my reasoning. 
The .PicesiDENr. The floor goes to the Rep-
resentative a Guatemala, member of the 
committee, to reply to certain aspects of the 
questl9n raised  by Mr. TeJtra Paris. 
Mr. Gasects 134Vinit. There is no better way 
to. answer the question raised by the Ambas-
sador 04 Venezuela than to refer him to the 
terms of reference of the May 1 resolution pi 
this meeting. The work mentioned by the 
Ttepresentative of Venezuela lpt fount:14n 
Approved For Releas 
the terms of reference, and consequently, the 
Committee was prohibited from entering into 
that area. Undoubtedly, and this we have 
already said, there is a desire for under-
standing; there is an evident wish for peace, 
since a number of relationships are involved; 
there are people, friends of one side and of 
the other. The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps 
told us of how, through him, splendid acts 
of humanitarianism had been performed. 
People asked him about their friends ru-
mored to be wounded or dead, and he was 
able to give them explanation and set -their 
minds at rest. In other words, that atmos-
phere has existed, and if the Ambassador of 
'Venezuela,. for example, remembers the cable 
that I read earlier, it mentioned one of the 
members of this new junta who described 
Caamafio as a personal friend, and also men-
tioned a lawyer, whom some think to be a 
militant partisan of the revolutionary party 
of Juan Bosch. In other words, it shows that 
there is a desire for understanding, that that 
desire is evident, and, of course, that there 
is faith in the inter-American system. How 
is that desire to be channeled? How .can the 
.GAS help to solve that problem that essen-
tially must be solved by the Dominicans 
themselves? That is something that must 
be considered at an opportune time by the 
system, by the organs of the system. I 
.yield the floor to Ambassador Tejera Paris. 
The PRESIDENT. The Special Delegate of 
Venezuela has the floor. 
Mr. TEJERA PARIS. I first want to explain 
that my question' was not intended as crit-
icism of the Committee, nor did I think that 
It could have wished to go beyond its terms 
of reference. I was only referring?perhaps 
T did not explain myself clearly?to the idea 
proposed informally by the Delegation of 
Costa Rica--I don't know if all of you know 
about this--for setting up a delegated com-
mittee, a ,committee that, by delegation of 
this conference, would go to the Dominican 
.Republic for the purpose of carrying out the 
second part of the task of reestablishing 
peace?that is, the administration of the 
mechanics of reestablishing peace and a re-
turn to institutional normality, not the for-
mation of a government and other such mat-
ters. Then I asked myself if such an idea 
had already occurred to other countries in 
some form or other, since such Ideas are 
normal. That was my question. Now, I have 
a third one. 
The PRESIDENT. The Chairman of the Com-
mittee, Ambassador Colombo, will be so kind 
as to answer these questions. 
Mr. COLOMBO. I want to say a couple of 
words regarding this concern of the distin-
guished Ambassador of Venezuela. I share 
the opinion just expressed by Ambassador 
Garcia Bauer that our immediate job was to 
obtain a prompt peace. Also, we were ob-
sessed with the fact?as undoubtedly every-
one else Was, without exception?that the 
solution to the Dominican Republic's polit-
ical problem should be in complete keeping 
with the principle of self-determination of 
peoples, and that in the last analysis It was 
the Dominicans who must determine the 
direction of their institutional 'life. For us, 
it has been enough to know that they respect 
the jurisdiction and authority of the system 
and that the system assures the solution. 
But, Mr. President, with all respect to the 
Ambassador of Venezuela, neither do I think 
that this is the time to start discussing these 
matters, since, precisely for the reasons given 
by the Ambassador earlier, we should con-
centrate on the report and on the questions 
and answers from the Ambassadors and the 
Committee members respectively. 
The PEES/DENT._The Special Delegate of 
Venezuela has the floor. 
Mr. TEJERA PARIS. I just want some per-
sonal information, as all of us do. And an-
other thing. From my own country's experi-
ence, especially during the dictatorship of 
Terez, Jimeiez, Communist hi,WtratIq Is

generally chaotic everywhere and tries to 
produce chaos in the various factions. Ex-
perience shows us that It is much easier and 
more common for Communists to ally them-
selves with elements of the extreme right 
than with liberal ones. And so I ask whether 
the Committee noted or inquired as to the 
presence of agents and provocateurs on the 
side of Benoit, Wessin y Wessin, and com-
pany, or whether they investigated the 
presence of Communists from the other side, 
because some of their action seem?give the 
impression of being?provocations rather 
than judicious acts. 
The PRESIDENT. Would the Chairman of the 
' Committee like to say something in this 
regard? 
Mr. COLOMBO. Thank you, yes. That also 
is a very pertinent question, and I think 
that we answered it to a certain extent when 
we acknowledged the existence of snipers on 
both sides. That is, there are snipers every-
where; they are a general disturbing element 
throughout the country, although we can-
not attribute to them the particular ideology 
mentioned by the Ambassador. But it is done before Conditions return to normal in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE 20559 
The PRESIDENT. Is the Ambassador's speak-
er turned too high? 
Mr. BUNKER. Shall I proceed? Well, it 
seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that the ques-
tions which have been put by my distin-
guished colleague to the Committee, and the 
answers of the members, have shed further 
light and have made a very great contribu-
tion toward a greater understanding of the 
situation existing in the Dominican Republic; 
a contribution so valuable that / think it 
should become public knowledge, Mr. Chair-
man. I believe that it was agreed at our 
previous meeting that the proceedings of the 
private meetings and the records would be-
come public. I trust that that will be so in 
this case, because I think the record is ex-
tremely valuable to provide a much wider 
public knowledge of the actual conditions in 
the Dominican Republic. 
The Committee has succeeded in taking 
this first step of major importance. It seems 
to me that this meeting can now move to 
a second major stage of the task, for I think 
we can all agree that much remains to be 
the establishment of Colonel Caamafio's 
group as the titular Constitutional Govern-
ment, nothing more, 
Mr. Paolo. Then, you had the opportunity 
to discuss with them their claim to be the 
only constitutional government of the Do-
minican Republic, because whether or not 
this claim can be maintained in either rela-
tive or absolute terms depends on their being

groups. 
The PRESIDENT. The Chair again recognizes 
the Ambassador of Argentina. 
Mr. CordomBo. Mr. President, replying to 
the important question asked by the Ambas-
sador of Costa Rica, I am pleased to tell him 
that the Committee delivered the Act pre-
viously to Colonel Caamario for consideration, 
in order that he would have the opportunity 
of going into the intricacies of its legal im-
plications, because what we wished to achieve 
was the first step that would lead all of us to 
achieve peace in the Dominican Republic, and 
if you read the beginning of the Act of Santo 
Domingo, it sets forth what Colonel Caamano 
and Colonel Guerra thought of the Act and 
the opinion of the parties. I recall simply 
that it reads: "The Parties signing below who 
declare that they represent, in the capacities 
mentioned," that is, in the act of signing 
they declared their capacity and as we had no 
authority to pass judgment on the titles, 
which would have implied a dangerous in-
cursion into a territory that was forbidden to 
us, we limited ourselves to record the capac-
ity of each one of the groups and with all 
loyalty to say to frankly and without any 
legal doubt at the beginning of that Act

ment?an affirmation that I did not hear, 
nor do I believe that any of the members 
heard it, from Colonel Benoit. 
Mr. TEJERA PAR/S. Maybe they are not so 
politically sensitive. 
The PRESIDENT. Well, reportedly so, accord-
ing to some opinions. 
Mr. TEJERA PAR/S. I thought as much, but 
I just wanted to make sure. Thank you very 
much, Mr. Ambassador. 
The PRESIDENT. OUT thanks to you, MT. 
Ambassador. We shall now hear from the 
Ambassador of the United States, Mr. 
Bunker. 
Mr. BUNKER. I would like to express on 
behalf of my delegation, and indeed on be-
half of my Government, appreciation and 
praise to all of the members of the Com-
mittee of the Meeting, individually and col-
lectively, who, under the brilliant leadership 
of my friend and colleague, Ambassador 
Colombo, have accomplished so much in so 
brief a period, and under, as they have de-
scribed to us, the most difficult and trying 
circumstances. We have heard the report of 
the Committee this evening, and I am con-
fident that this Meeting will agree with me, 
that the Act of Santo Domingo marks an 
outstanding achievement in what has been 
our priority objective under the terms of the 
resolution, an agreement on an effective 
cease-fire in the Doininican Republic. As

own wishes were fulfilled when, at the Papal 
Nunciate in Santo Domingo, we delivered to 
the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps the mes-
sage from the President of the Tenth Meet-
ing, Mr. Sevilla Sacasa, notifying him of the 
action of this Meeting some days ago con-
cerning Monsignor Clarizio's work. 
The PRESIDENT. Ambassador Colombo; Spe-
cial Delegate of Argentina has the floor. 
Ur. Cowen?. I only wish to add one re-
mark that seems to be strictly justifiable. In 
order to be able to act with the urgency that 
the case requires, the five-member Commit-
tee had to move up its return so that the 
Tenth Meeting could be as thoroughly in-
formed as possible with all available data, but 
we were deeply concerned that before our de-
parture the fundamental problem of the faith 
in the system as stated by the two sides in 
the struggle would not have been resolved, 
and the Committee was the link, at the scene 
of action, during the emergency, remaining 
in order to be able to carry out the powers 
excepted by both parties. It was for this 
reason that the Delegate of Panama, in an 
act that honors him, and which I cannot 
ignore, remained at the center of action, rep-
resenting our mission. In this way, accord-
ing to the conversations we held with the 
parties, it would be as though the Committee 
were present and together with military ad-
visers and the civilian personnel he could 
undertake to solve whatever it might be pos-
sible to solve, to the extent that we are 
able?to solve the difficulties arising from 
the events that have taken place and that are 
taking place in the Dominican Republic, I 
want this generous act of the Delegate of 
Panama, from a country that has so many 
reasons for counting on the tradition of 
brotherliness in solving basic problems, to be 
recognized at this session. Panama is with 
us on the Committee, represented by its dis-
tinguished Delegate. Ambassador Calamari 
also wanted to be here, physically, with the 
Committee but was not able to do so. I want 
to stress this act of the Delegate of Panama 
because it Is eminently fair to do so?to take 
note of one who has firmly carried the banner 
of the inter-American system into the midst 
of the fight. Nothing more. 
The Parsineerr. We are sure that our col-
league, Ambassador Calamari, must be grati-
fied by the eulogy given by his compatriot 
and our dear colleague, Ambassador Frank 
leorrice. [Sic] 
Ambassador Dies de Medina, Special Dele-
gate of 13olivia, has asked for the floor; and 
then Ambassador Tejera Paris, Special Dele-
gate of Venezuela. 
Mr. DIEZ DE MEDINA. Mr. Chairman, / have 
not asked for the floor to pose any question: 
I have no questions to ask. I have only words 
of praise?of warm praise and congratula-
tions?for the distinguished members of the 
Special Committee of the Tenth Meeting of 
Consultation, for the intelligent and devoted 
manner in which they carried out the deli-
cate mission entreated to the Committee. I 
Only wish, Mr. President, to add my wish 
that the minutes of this plenary session 
should also include words of congratulation 
and appreciation for the task being so suc-
cessfully performed in the Dominican Repub-
lic by Dr. Jos?ntonio Mora, Secretary Gen-
eral of the Organization of American States. 
Thank you eery much. 
The PRESIDENT. Very well, we shall do so. 
Ambassador 'Colombo, the Special Delegate of 
Argentina has the floor. 
Mr, Coecneeo. The Ambassador of Bolivia 
IS quite right in proposing formal recognition 
at the fact that the Committee was able to

efforts that were begun by Dr. Jos?. Mora

fore, I second the Ambassador of Bolivia's 
proposal but would like to point out that 
we had intended to submit this matter during 
the session. 
The PRESIDENT. The Ambassador of Bolivia 
and the Committee have interpreted the 
feelings and thoughts of the Chair and of all 
our colleagues very well. Ambassador Tejera 
Paris, Special Delegate of Venezuela line the 
floor. 
Mr. TEJERA PARIS. The Delegate of Bolivia 
anticipated what I was thinking and what is 
certainly the thought of all of us here. My 
Intention was I now confirm it, to ask the 
chair to ask this Tenth Meeting of Consulta-
tion to give to the Committee, to the Secre-
tary General, and to the members of the Gm-
eral Secretariat a vote of applause for the 
work they have done. The test that the 
Committee has passed has been hard both 
there and here, and I believe that since this 
is a problem that affects the whole security 
of the hemisphere, these colleagues deserve 
not only our thanks but the thanks of our 
governments and of their peoples, and, at 
this moment, enthusiastic applause which / 
am sure the President will be the first to 
begin. [Applause.] 
The PRESIDENT. All of us join in the praise 
and tribute the Special Committee has given 
to the prelate Emmanuel Clarizio, -Papal 
Nuncio in the Dominican Republic arid Dean 
of the Diplomatic Corps in Santo Domingo. 
We share in this with real appreciation, with 
affection, as our common duty. Ills services 
for the peace of the Americas, his vows and 
his blessings we applaud with emotion; with 
emotion, I say, which corresponds to the emo-
tion that he experienced when he received 
our expression of deep gratitude for his mag-
nificent labor for the peace of the Ameri-
cas and for that people that we all love so 
well: the Dominican Republic. This closed 
plenary session has been highly Important 
We have heard the interesting report of the 
Special Committee. We have posed broad 
questions; we have obtained splendid and 
very clear replies, from which we can ap-
preciate even more the extraordinary task 
accomplished by the Committee. Our re-
peated applause and eulogy for it and its 
members, all of whom we are honored to call 
our colleagues and friends. Unless you think 
otherwise a plenary session of the Tenth 
Meeting of Consultation should be indicated 
to consider the report in the aspects noted by 
the Committee, so that the meeting may act 
on that report. We have asked questions 
and have obtained answers; now comes the 
job of considering the report and analyzing 
the action to be taken by the Tenth Meeting 
of Consultation on the recommendations pro-
posed by the Special Committee and the con-
clusions that It reached. 
I ask you only whether tomorrow's plenary 
session should be open?/ understand that 
it should be. It should be open so that the 
public will know everything that we have 
said, both with respect to the work of the 
Commitee and to the contents of its inter-
esting report. I would call another closed 
meeting, if the Committee so wishes, but the 
meeting I am going to convoke for a little 
later today, should be public and its pur-
pose will be to consider the report of the 
Special Committee, discuss it and propose de-
cisions concerning the recommendations it 
makes. The delegates have already seen and 
have in your briefcases for later reading the 
fourth radio-telephone message from our Sec-
retary General, Dr. Mora.3 It is not necessary 
to have the Secretary read it, since I am sure 
all of you have read it. With respect to the 
minutes of this plenary session, I ask you to 
take note that you have 21 hours in which 
to give the Secretariat your corrections of

of the Secretary General is published as

style. I ask you to take note of that time 
period so that the Secretariat can speed up 
the final edition of the minutes of the plenary 
session. 
Mr. Coeceitso. Mr. President, I should like 
you to repeat the last part as to the time and 
place, according to the Chair's plan, as was 
suggested. Please do me the great favor of 
repeating it. 
The PRESIDENT. Yes, sir. We are going to 
adjourn the session and meet again in a few 
hours, let's say, perhaps this afternoon. It 
will be a plenary session of the Tenth Meet-
ing, public, for the purpose of considering the 
report of the Special Committee. To consider 
it, analyze it, discuss it, and decide on the 
recommendations and conclusions reached by 
the Committee. It is assumed that this ses-
sion should be public. The next plenary ses-
sion will not be closed like this one; it will 
be public, so that public opinion of the 
hemisphere will be informed, but not just of 
what is in the report of the Special Commit-
tee, because I am hereby suggesting that the 
report should be made public, unless for 
some reason the members of the Committee 
indicate to the Chair that it should not be 
made public but that we ought to wait until 
tomorrow's session. 
Mr. Coeonsno. Absolutely, Mr. President. 
The PRESTDED/T. Therefore, gentlemen, as 
of now the report of the Special Committee 
is public. Consequently, it can be turned 
over to the press and sent to anyone wishing 
it. Naturally, if at tomorrow's meeting we 
reach conclusions on the suggestions made 
by the Committee, we shall feel highly grati-
fied. In any case I think that the time has 
come for the Meeting of Consultation to make 
concrete statements on the chaotic situation 
that seems to grow worse every hour. There-
fore, within 5 or 6 hours, possibly for 4 or 5 
o'clock this afternoon, I am going to convoke 
the fifth plenary session of the Tenth Meet-
ing of Consultation to meet in this same place 
and take up the report of the Committee. 
The Representative of Venezuela. 
Mr. TEJERA Peels. Mr. President, only to 
ask If you would be good enough to include 
in the order of business two specific points 
that I believe are relevant to the announce-
ment you have just made: first would be 
consideration of whether or not the present 
situation in the Dominican Republic affects 
the security of the hemisphere; second, es-
tablishment and implementation of measures 
to help the Dominican people return to full 
constitutional democracy. 
The PRESIDENT. Very well; it seems to me 
there is no objection to discussing these two 
points in the public session we shall hold 
shortly?the one suggested by the distin-
guished Representative of Uruguay and sup-
ported by the Representative of Venezuela, 
and the other just mentioned by the dis-
tinguished Ambassador Tejera Paris. I rec-
ognize the Representative of the Dominican 
Republic. 
Mr. Boerreee ATILES. Mr. President, I shall 
wait until tomorrow to formally present a 
draft resolution on my proposal that the 
Organ of Consultation declare the situation 
in the Dominican Republic to be a threat to 
the peace of the hemisphere. 
The PRESIDENT. Very well. The Repre-
sentative of Paraguay has requested the floor. 
Mr. /deice. I only wish to ask two ques-
tions, Mr. President. I understand, or rather. 
I actually heard you mention a decision on 
the request of the Delegate of the United 
States that the minutes of today's session be 
made public. This request was seconded by 
the distinguished Representative of Uruguay. 
From this I assume, that is, I hope, because 
the suggestion is also mine, that it will be 
agreed to make public the minutes of this 
session. 
The PRESIDENT. The chair has so tesolved. 
Mr. Wince. I beg your pardon. Thank

.21v-the regime was taking. 
ow in eco 
thikii S: hd period of exile at the 
age of 53, Dr. Lopez is serving as an economic 
advisor to the Puerto Rican Treasury De-
partment. 
Dr. Lopez believes the Dominican affair is 
the latest, but certainly not the last, mani-
festation of a social revolution underway 
throughout Latin America. This movement, 
he says, is sparked not by the masses as 
might be superficially assumed, but by an 
emerging middle class that is opposed to 
both the present aristocratic oligarchy and 
communism. The masses seek a better lot 
wherever it may be found. 
The middle-class revolutionists are, he says, 
liberal democrats who want no more Batistes, 
Trujillos or Perons and would greatly prefer 
economic alliance with the United States to 
Castro's 6,000-mile supply line to Soviet Rus-
sia. 
Had the Marines landed at the Interna-
tional Airport in Santo Domingo rather than 
at the Dominican Air Force base held by 
General Wessin and been sent from there on 
their primary mission of aiding the trapped 
U.S. citizens a proper impression of neutral-
ity could have been created, Dr. Lopez be-
lieves. 
This would have opened the way for a civil-
ian government of professional and busi-
nessmen and intellectuals of the middle class 
with which the United States must ally itself 
throughout Latin America, Dr. Lopez says, 
if the cold warts to be won. 
And this alliance was the policy of Presi-
dent Kennedy, he believes, and is the policy 
of President Johnson. Its failure to ma-
terialize he lays to a breakdown in the chain 
of communication between State Department 
agents in the field and the White House. 
The breakdown, Dr. Lopez says, stems from 
the tendency of too many American displo-
mats to associate only with the ruling aristo-
crats in Latin America and to ignore the 
- rising middle class which has neither the 
_ money to join the country club nor the 
time to play golf. Yet they are the yeast 
In the social ferment. 
As for the Sot of intervention itself in the 
Dominican Republic, Dr. Lopez says that 
there is widespread misconception of the in-
tent and purpose of the Pan American agree-
ment on nonintervention in the internal 
affairs of member nations. 
The Idea was broached at the Pan Ameri-
can meeting in Montevideo in 1933, he says, 
as a proposed protection against economic 
intervention, i.e., the dispatching of marines 
to protect a defaulted loan and like un-
pleasantries the United States had been 
known to engage in. To this President 
rtooseyelt readily agreed as a symbol of sin-
berity in his Good Neighbor policy. 
"We are now engaged with events that 
were unforeseen at that -time," Dr. Lopez 
says. "We are at war. A cold war if you 
like, but we are faced with an enemy who 
Is out to bury us." 
In this new situation, he asserts, the 
Kontevideo accord on nonintervention does 
aot apply. 
"The Organization of American States has 
4tated that communism is incompatible with 
he democratic principles of Latin America. 
Irlie United States has a right to intervene 
cgainst the Communists?the enemy." 
Dr. Lopez believes that Communists were 
involved in the Dominican disorders. 
"They are everywhere," he says, "and they 
s re trained to infiltrate popular movements." 
Their number is immaterial, he says, for 
51 trained Communists working with an 
armed civilian militia would be plenty under 
t te chaotic conditions that prevailed early 
in the revolt. 
Where the United States made a mistake, 
Er. Lopez says, was in trying to name them. 
Be suspects that someone in the Santo 
Domingo Embassy had not done his home-
work and, when pressed for names, reached 
is to the files and came up with an old list. 
August 23, 1:965 
"Why should the United States name 
them?" he asks. "The United States was 
not on trial." 
Castro, ever under the scrutiny of Dr. 
Lopez, "played it cool" in the Dominican 
affair. Had the marines not landed, he says, 
Castro's troops would have. 
President Johnson's quick move fore-
stalled action by the Cuban leader, in the 
opinion of Dr. Lopez, because Castro feared 
that an open confrontation in the Domini-
can Republic would lay him open to attack 
on his home grounds. 
"We had hoped that he would make this 
mistake," he says, "but he didn't." 
The present situation in the Dominican 
Republic has been complicated by the United 
States allowing the impression to be gained 
that It backed General Wessin, Dr. Lopez 
says. 
Be believes that Wessin is still running the 
show with Gen. Antonio Imbert Barrera as a 
front, rendering any compromise with the 
rebel forces of Col. Francisco Caamafio Deno 
unlikely. 
Dr. LOpez describes Irnbert as an aspirant 
to the toga of Trujillo. 
"Imbert is a petty business man," he says, 
"who was handed an honorary army com-
mission for his part in the plot to assassinate 
Trujillo. He promptly donned a uniform, 
covered himself with decorations and in-
sisted upon being addressed by his full title. 
It is not difficult for even an amateur psy-
chologist to understand that sort of per-
sonality." 
Dr. Lopez is well-acquainted with Juan 
Bosch, constitutional president of the Re-
public ousted by General Wessin. Bosch 
spent many years in Cuba, exiled by Trujillo, 
Now both he and Dr. Lopez are exiles in San 
Juan. 
Dr. Lopez knows Bosch as a scholar, an 
honest man and a sincere democrat whose 
feet are not on the ground. Without ad-
ministrative experience and lacking in exec-
utive ability, he was inefficient as president, 
Dr. Lopez says, and was in some degree 
responsible for his own upset. 
He criticizes Bosch for unwise remarks 
during the first 72 hours of the Dominican 
revolt and for not taking an anti-Communist 
stand during that period. In the latter 
instance, Dr. Lopez says, he forfeited his 
responsibility as a democratic leader and 
missed an opportunity to influence the 
thinking of many Americans and thus help 
shape U.S. policy. 
With the Wessin-Imbert and Caamafio 
forces implacably opposed and Bosch a re-
luctant hero, whither the course of 
government? 
"It is time," Dr. LOpez says, "that democ-
racy became sophisticated, as sophisticated 
as the enemy It faces. Democracy should 
become militant and must fight both the 
Reds and the right." (The right, that is, as 
represented by aristocratic power structures 
and military governments.) 
Making no claim as to its infallibility, Dr. 
LOpez advances this plan of action in the 
Dominican Republic: 
Maintain the status quo in Santo Do-
mingo, holding rebel and junta forces at bay. 
Beat the bushes for liberal ,middle class ci-
vilians-.-mayors of other cities, former mem-
bers of the Bosch regime, professional and 
business men?and set up a new government 
in Santiago. Give this new group the army 
payroll and make Imbert and Cae.mafto come 
to Santiago to get it. 
Neither would be long in recognizing the 
new setup, Dr. LOpez thinks, and a new army 
could be formed around a cadre of younger 
officers, including military attaches with 
first-hand contact with democratic processes 
called home for the purpose. 
"This might not work," Dr. LOpez admits, 
"but I would try it. I don't think the Latin 
American combined, force, will become a liv-

in.g thing, but it is a good idea for the United 
States to work at it so that in the future 
they will have a record of having tried. 
"The United States must succeed in the 
Dominican Republic. It is vital to set a 
precedent for future trouble spots which will 
surely develop." 
REPORTING: TAKING SIDES IN SANTO DOIVITNGO 
Covering the war in the Dominican Re-
public has' been a battle in itself. Reporters 
have found U.S. officials, both military and 
civilian, closemouthed and uncooperative, 
when Information has been -given out, it has 
often been wrong. When reporters have 
taken to the streets for their stories, they 
have been shot at by snipers, have hitched 
rides with hysterical drivers while bullets 
whizzed past. They spend much of their 
time helping the wounded to hospitals. 
Aggravated by one thing or another, most 
at the 160-man press corps has soured on thg 
U.S. position and flocked to rebel headquar-
ters, where people seemed anxious to make 
their case to reporters. Predisposed to side 
with the underdog against a Latin American 
Military junta and against U.S. military in-
tervention, many of the correspondents wrote 
glowing accounts of their fleeting interviews 
with the rebels. 
Cabled the New York Herald Tribune's 
Barnard Collier: "The U.S. action was meant 
to thwart internationally trained Commu-
nists who are fighting alongside the leftist 
rebels. Its effect has been to give the Com-
munist world a rallying cry, to create dozens 
of Dominican Communist martyrs, and to 
turn an increasing number of rebels against 
the United States." Said New York Times 
man Tad Szulc: "The United States finds 
itself identified with a military junta that 
Is widely hated, and it may be standing on 
the threshold of a violent showdown with 
the highly popular rebel movement." 
Los Angeles Timestnan Ruben Salazar in-
terviewed a rebel accused by the State De-
partment of being a Communist: "Fiorentino 
doesn't look dangerous. He's slight of build 
and sports a thin mustache. I went away 
wishing we had done something to win him 
to oUr side." Wrote Dan Kurzman of the 
Washington Post: "Innumerable conversa-
tions have strongly indicated overwhelming 
popular support for the rebel regime and a 
corresponding anti-American sentiment aris-
ing from U.S. antagonism toward that 
regime." 
WARY OF CLAIMS 
Back in the United States, many editorial-
ists and columnists sided with the men in 
the field. Said the New York Times: "Little 
awareness has been shown by the United 
States that the Dominican people?not just 
a handful of Communists?were fighting and 
dying for social justice and constitutional-
ism." Even Walter Lippmann, who had sup-
ported the U.S. intervention, hoped for the 
success of what he called the "legitimatist 
party?that of the Constitutionalists." But 
the fact is that Col. Francisco Caamafio 
Deno, bass of the sO-called Constitutionalists, 
had helped overthrow the Constitutional 
President, Juan Bosch, in 1963. And the 
Bosch constitution that Caamafio was sup-
posedly supporting forbids any military man 
--Caamafio, for example?to hold office. 
Not all reporter's, to be sure, were happy 
with the rebels. Warned the Herald Trib-
une's Rowland Evans and Robert Novak: 
"Adventurers are running the rebel com-
mand, but they maintain only tenuous con-
trol over all their forces. Rebel strongpoints, 
particularly in the southeast section of Santo 
Domingo, are manned by Communists with 
only token allegiance to Caamealo.," And 
after spending a week in Santo Domingo, 
Netesdayt Marguerite Higgins filed another 
,Minority report: "Be wary of all those claims 
of widespread sUpport for the rebel Constitu-
tionalists or the loyalist junta. This reporter 
has been impressed by the hazards of trying 
to diagnose the feelings of a massively illit-
erate nation. Oddly enough, in this topsy-
turvy world, the very deftness with which 
Dominicans can switch sides may prove to 
be a strong card that the Americans can play 
in an effort to bring seemingly irreconciliable 
factions together." 
NO cman's PLAY 
Through it all, U.S. Government spokes-
men were baffled by the antagonism of the 
press. Some reporters seemed determined 
to become policymakers. The Trib's Collier 
complained to U.S. officials that marines were 
allowed to shoot back when shot at from 
outside the international zone. "He got 
quite upset," says one. "He refused to 
understand that this is not child's play and 
that our men must protect themselves." 
Both Collier and Szulc reported last week 
that U.S. troops were helping the loyalists 
fight the rebels in northern Santo Domingo, 
but no other reporters confirmed this story, 
and many flatly contradicted it. The New 
York Times ran an Air Force picture pur-
portedly showing U.S. troops aiding the junta 
last week by arresting rebels. Actually, the 
photo was taken 2 weeks ago in the inter-
national zone, where rebels were being 
rounded up for suspected sniping. The Trib 
ran a similarly slanted photo of a marine 
firing his rifle, with a caption that upbraided 
him for defending himself. 
Among the trump cards in the U.S. Gov-
ernment's hand is a devastating report of 
five OAS ambassadors that backs up U.S. 
contention that Communists played a sub-
stantial part in the revolution. Yet when 
the report was first issued on May 8, not a 
single U.S. paper picked it up. Next day 
Ellsworth Bunker, U.S. Ambassador to the 
OAS, held an hour-long press briefing on the 
report, but even that was given scant play 
in the press. 
Finally, Alaska's Senator ERNEST Cfaume-
MG, one of the most vocal critics of admin-
istration policy in Vietnam, delivered a 
furious speech in the Senate: "Unhappily, 
the U.S. press has been gravely derelict in 
reporting what has transpired in the OAS 
with regard to the Dominican crisis. Com-
mentators express doubts regarding the wis-
dom of expanding our mission to prevent a 
Communist takeover. Many reports ques-
tion the extent of Communist infiltration. 
Yet, to my knowledge, none of the major 
wire services, newspapers, or radio-television 
systems have taken the trouble to examine 
the findings of the OAS investigating team." 
LABOR DEPARTMENT ACCEPTS 
SUGGESTION TO BROADEN 
"TRAINING PROGRAM" REGULA-
TIONS 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I call 
attention to the fact that the Labor 
Department, at my reqest, has just is-
sued new regulations which very con-
siderably broaden the opportunity for 
on-the-job training for employees. I 
believe these new regulations will open 
up many new opportunities for training. 
On August 10, 1965, the Administrator 
of the Labor Department's Wage and 
Hour Division issued revised regulations 
dealing with training programs under 
the Fair Labor Standards Act. The 
amended regulations, which were 
prompted by an inquiry from me on 
April 26, 1965, liberalize the conditions 
under which an employer may establish 
a training program for his employees 
without running afoul of the minimum 
wage and overtime provisions of the Fair 
Labor Standards Act. 
20563 
The regulations, which appear in title 
29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 
define "hours worked" which must be 
paid at the minimum wage rate and 
counted for overtime purposes. Basi-
cally, the requirements for a training 
program which an employer may con-
duct for his employees without counting 
the training time as hours worked are: 
First, that the program be conducted 
outside regular working hours; second, 
that attendance be voluntary; third, 
that the program not be directely re-
lated to the employee's job; and, fourth, 
that the trainee perform no productive 
work during training time. 
In my letter to the Administrator, I 
pointed out that the requirement that 
the program not be directly related to 
an employee's job had a tendency to 
deter employers from instituting bona 
fide programs for upgrading of em-
ployees. For example, if an employer 
institutes a program for mechanics' 
helpers to train them to be full-fledged 
mechanics, the program might be re-
lated to the employee's job because it 
would help the employee to be a better 
mechanics' helper. I also pointed out 
to the Administrator that an exception 
for this sort of program has always been 
included in the regulations under the 
Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, and 
there is no reason why the same excep-
tion should not be made a part of the 
broader FLSA regulations. 
The Administrator agreed with me, 
and a new section 785.29 of the regula-
tions under the FLSA was Issued last 
week which included the following: 
Where a training course is instituted for 
the bona fide purpose of preparing for ad-
vancement through upgrading the employee 
to a higher skill, and is not intended to 
make the employee more efficient in his 
present job, the training is not considered 
directly related to the employee's job even 
though the course incidentally improves his 
skill in doing his regular work. 
I would hope that the broader view re-
flected in these new regulations will pro-
vide added incentive for employers to 
institute additional training programs to 
help meet the ever-present challenge of 
automation. 
I would also hope that workers and 
labor leaders will read this material very 
carefully and counsel their employers in 
their own States as to how training op-
portunities for workers may now be 
broadened.

assist our struggle to defeat crippling

In light of these important activitias 
of the Federal Government, activitim 
Which I have consistently supported, I 
Would like to call attention to the fa 3t 
that many private organizations are 
making similar progress on their own. 
Federal programs are designed to sup-
plement the efforts of private, civic, or 
rellitious organizations, where the real 
Initiative, management, and responsibil-
ity, raste, end without these organizatior s 
ati their response to the needs of their 
'unity, little could be aecomplishei 
ii this most important field. 
One organization of which we are vert 
proud In New York, is the Beth Israel 
' Medical Center. This particular cente: 
has been consistently expanding on it; 
OlVillo meet the growing needs of the 
area it serves, which is the area in which 
/ grew up, the lower East Side a' 
, 
dn. Israel began as a dispensary it 
160, financed by a group of 40 recently 
arrived immigrants, who were attempting 
to improve the quality of the medical 
services, the people in the neighborhood 
.r9,,fe4elving. Since then it has main-
ta4ileclap exemplary record of service and 
itnprefetnent, so that today it is a mod-
e 'Medical complex with 891 beds. An 
patient clinic, named after a long-
tiMe ,friend, the president of the Beth 
Israel Board of Truatees, Charles H. SU-
Ver. W4ladded in,1954 and it now handles 
oVet,t o(i_cases per year. In 1961, a 
IfiOdern ,studezit nurses residence and 
-, Medical unit was added, and is now being 
cbtVerted into a new school of nursing. 
?New staff living quarters were completed 
In 1963, and a new 350-bed wing is pres-
ently being constructed. 
?But, Deth,lsrael has also expanded in 
other ways, It operates the Gouverneur 
AmbillatOrY Clinic, in cooperation with 
; the New York City Department of Hos-
pital., and has recently been asked to 
staff all of the medical services of the 
new 200-bed Gouverneur Hospital, pres-
:ently under construction by the city of 
New Yerk. ?Further, in 1964 Beth Israel 
'Ptirchasecl the Manhattan General Hos-
pital, a major center for the treatment 
.a.hd study of problems of narcotic addic-
tion. This addition allowed the hospital 
to be redesignated a medical center, corn-
Vete with a wide range of up-to-date 
facilities for treatment of a variety of 
diseases, In keeping with its new po-
sition f,t mPortance, it plans to open the 
Monnt Sinai Medical School in 1968. 
With this record of, improvement and 
expansion, it might be expected that 
those who have assumed the responsibil-
ity for the leadership of the center's 
Activitiep would want to relax with a 
Proper aMount of pride in their accom-

retnendous improvement in the qual-
of the treatment the center will be

teresting that this boo to New Yorkers 
has been made possible almost entirely 
by the efforts of one man, an old friend 
and schoolmate of mine, from P.S. 20, 
Charles Guttman. I think it is an im-
portant tribute to the strength of the 
free enterprise system that Charles Gutt-
man could start a life in the public 
schools of the Lower East Side of Man-
hattan, become a successful business-
man, and retain his public spiritedness 
and interest in his city's welfare to the 
extent that he would finance this ther-
apy center, which will cost over a third 
of a million dollars. I need not point 
out what a great undertaking this is for 
a private citizen, and how much of a 
sacrifice it represents. 
Mr. Guttman's gift once again proves 
the utmost importance of private phi-
lanthrophy today, even while we contin-
ue to make progress in bringing the re-
sources of the Nation to bear in the field 
of medical care and research. I know 
that this new center of modern therapy 
will be a lasting monument to his devo-
tion to the people of his city. Today, 
I want to add my thanks to that of mil-
lions of New Yorkers, and to wish him 
and his family the best of health and 
happiness in the efforts to come.

1966 is $4,387,616,000. 
So the bill are reported to the Senate is 
under the Budget estimate by $60,027,000, 
aid under the appropriation for 1965 by 
$ L41,427,700. 
Mr. President, before the Senate for 
cc ideration is the bill that deals with 
I I 
August 23, 1965 
moneys appropriated for the civil func-
tions of the Department of Defense, the 
Atomic Energy Commission, the TVA, 
certain agencies of the Department of the 
Interior including the Bureau of Re-
clamation, and the Delaware River Basin 
Commission. I am very hopeful that 
consideration of the bill can be concluded 
this afternoon, so that, as soon as Pos-
sible, we may go to conference with the 
House on the disagreeing amendments. 
The bill passed the House on June 22 
and was referred to the Committee on 
Appropriations on June 23. The bill was 
reported to the Senate on August 19. 
I do not believe it is necessary for me 
to give a lengthy explanation of the bill. 
The report on it is on the desks of the 
Senators, and I believe it quite clearly 
sets forth the action of the committee. 
Except for two or three items, I be-
lieve the bill is noncontroversial. I ex-
pect that amendments will be offered to 
slecrease amounts recommended for cer-
tain public works projects. 
At the conclusion of my statement, I 
will ask that the committee amendments 
be adopted en bloc and that the bill as 
thus amended be considered as original 
text, so that the Senate will have ample 
opportunity to work its will on the bill. 
Mr. President, as is customary, the 
Subcommittee on Public Works divided 
itself into three subcommittees for the 
consideration of the pending bill. The 
portion of the public works appropriation 
bill dealing with the Bureau of Reclama-
tion and the power marketing agencies 
of the. Department of the Interior was 
handled by my good and able friend, the 
distinguished senior Senator from Ari-
zona [Mr. HAYDEN], who is also the chair-
man of the Committee on Appropriations. 
The portion of the bill covering the 
Atomic Energy Commission and the 
Tennessee Valley Authority was handled 
by my good friend, the distinguished 
senior Senator from Alabama [Mr. Mu]. 
I handled the portion dealing with the 
civil functions of the Department of the 
Army, and the Interoceanic Canal Com-
mission. 
The hearings on this bill started on 
April .6 and continued through July 13, 
1965. The subcommittee held 34 ses-
sions for the purpose of taking testimony 
and 5 executive sessions for the pur-
pose of marking up the bill. The sub-
committee heard 889 witnesses, which 
included representatives of various or-
ganizations; 738 of the witnesses ap-
peared before the subcommittee dealing 
with the civil functions of the Depart-
ment of the Array; 121 of the witnesses 
appeared before the subcommittee head-
ed by the senior Senator from Arizona 
[Mr. HAYDEN]. The remaining 30 wit-
nesses appeared before the subcommittee 
headed by the senior Senator from Ala-
bama [Mr. Huai The hearings com-
prise four volumes, which contain 3,868 
pages of testimony. Senators have a 
complete set of them on their desks. They 
constitute the basic information upon 
which the subcommittee based its recom-
mendation to the full committee. 
Mr. President, with respect to title I, 
before marking up the civil functions por-
tion of this bill, we reviewed every proj-
ect that was presented to the subcom-
mittee, budgeted or u.nbudgeted. We
