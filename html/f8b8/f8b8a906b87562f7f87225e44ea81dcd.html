 MEMORANDUM
 THE WEST EUROPEAN/CHINESE CONNECTION
 The Chinese and the West Europeans view their steadily
 expanding relationship from very different perspectives.
 For Peking, two considerations are dominant:  rapid eco-
 nomic development and greater security vis-a-vis the Soviets.
 After years of insisting that China must rely mainly on its
 own resources for development, the Chinese are now making
 up for Zost time.  Their delegations are crisscrossing Europe
 with Zong shopping lists (including military items), economic
 agreements are proliferating,, and hundreds of students will
 be sent to Europe over the next few months.  In the security
 area, Peking is making clear at every opportunity the importance
 it attaches to the containment of the Soviets and its concern
 that weakness in the Atlantic Alliance is undermining this
 effort.
 For the Europeans there are many secondary motives,
 but the driving force is commercial.  Few Europeans suffer
 from the illusion that there is a vast and easily exploited
 market in China, but they all know that significant oppor-
 tunities do exist; and given Western Europe's current
 economic situation, the opportunities Zook particularly
 enticing to them.  To the extent that security considera-
 tions enter their calculations, the lessons they draw are

 ambivalent.  They recognize that bolstering the Chinese makes
 sense in terms-of the international power balance--and also
 could open up diplomatic opportunities. for them in their
 relations with the Soviets.  At the same time, many of them
 are concerned over the possibiZity of an adverse: reaction
 from Moscow.
 Nowhere is West European ambivalence more noticeable
 than in the area of arms sales.  These are often particularly
 lucrative, and they have an obvious appeal to those who
 emphasize Europe's interest in helping China become a more
 effective counterweight to the Soviets.  Yet deals in this
 field have the greatest potential for producing an unpleasant
 25X1
 The Soviets probably recognize that they will be
 unable to prevent the expansion of Sino-West European
 ties, including those in the arms field.  The pace of
 expansion is likely to be gradual for other reasons,
 however, and China will remain a small market for European
 industry.  The Chinese have consistently proven to be
 sticky negotiators, and they are asking for things which
 the Europeans will often be reluctant to give:  the sale
 of weapons production technology, for example.  Even more
 important, China's ability either to pay for or to absorb
 the goods it wants is limited.  Both the Chinese and the
 West Europeans, moreover., have other foreign policy con-
 cerns that Zoom much larger than Sino-West European
 relations, and neither the leaders in Peking nor those in
 Europe are likely to put too much faith in a nexus of this
 sort.
 But the expansion, gradual though it may be, also
 seems irreversible--barring another sea change in Chinese
 policy.  The Europeans will remain nervous about the Soviets,
 and while recognizing that they are in competition with

 each other (and with the United States), they will at the
 same time be reluctant to move too far ahead of each. other
 in such a sensitive field as arras.  Commercial advantage
 will remain the dominant consideration, however, and a
 slow growth in Sino-West European commerce in such sen-
 sitive fields as weapons technology and nuclear power is
 almost certain.  West Germany, France, the UK, and Italy
 will probably get the Zion's share of China's business,
 both military and otherwise, but smaller countries. such as
 Switzerland and the Nordic countries will also obtain a
 piece of the action.
 The pace of the expansion is not ZikeZy to be af-
 fected much by the establishment of diplomatic relations
 between China and the United States.  If anything, this
 development is ZikeZy to accelerate the Europeans'
 efforts, both because they will consider that it
 enhances the respectability of doing business with Peking
 and because they aZmost certainly anticipate more active
 competition from the US in the  uture.
 This memorandum has 11 different sections, beginning
 with a Zook at Western Europe from China's perspective,
 at trade ties with China, and at some organizational aspects
 (EC and NATO) of the Chinese/West European Zink.  These
 three sections are followed by discussions of the following
 countries' relations with China: France; West Germany; UK;
 Italy; Greece, Turkey and Cyprus; Canada; and Malta.  The
 last section discusses Moscow's view o  Sino-West European
 relations.
 From China's Perspective
 China expects to draw heavily on Western Europe as a source. of
 modern industrial equipment, technology, and expertise and to use the
 region as a vital element in a strategy of counterbalancing the USSR on
 a global scale.  Chinese officials miss few chances to warn the West
 Europeans about the peril Moscow poses to the West and to encourage a
 strong, united Western Europe firm in its opposition to Soviet expansionism.
 Conversely, the Chinese are quick to criticize what they interpret as
 the slightest sign of "appeasement" on the part of. the West Europeans.

 This encouragement of anti-Sovietism goes beyond European regional
 concerns to encouragement of greater West European cooperation with the
 Third World, particularly i.n Africa and the Middle. East.  For example,
 earlier this year the Chinese were.approving,of French aid to President
 Mobutu to repel the second Katangan invasion of Zaire.  Peking also
 hopes for closer relations between Western Europe and Japan in the
 interest of containing the Soviets.
 This does not mean that Peking wants to encourage West European
 unity, strength, and independence at the expense of Western European
 ties to the United States.  On the contrary, though uncertainty about US
 steadfastness produces an occasional note of ambivalence in Peking's
 statements, the Chinese generally emphasize the indispensability of the
 United States, in the maintenance of NATO and the defense of Western
 Europe.  "Neutralization" of the region, with its concomitant damn a to
 US - Western European relations, would be a severe blow to Peking.            25X1
 The anti-Soviet orientation of China's attitude toward Western
 Europe has contributed to Peking's continuing ambivalence toward the
 major "Eurocommunist" parties.  Although there have been tentative signs
 this year that the Chinese are rethinking their policy toward these
 parties, Peking's suspicion of their continued links to the Soviets has
 continued to inhibit Chinese-Eurocommunist rapprochement.                     25X1
 Increasing Sino - West European trade, with the prospect of greater
 increases to come, provides tangible content to the more problematical
 and slower developing political relationship.  So far this year Peking
 has signed a trade agreement with the EC and a long-term economic cooperation
 agreement with France.  Various types of long-term agreements with
 Italy, West Germany, and Great Britain are under consideration.  During
 the same period, China also has concluded scientific and technical
 cooperation agreements with France, Italy, West Germany, and Britain.
 Chinese delegations of all sorts have crisscrossed Europe in increasing
 numbers.  China also is turning to Western Europe as a source of educa-
 tion necessary to improve and expand its pool of scientists and engineers.
 Large numbers of Chinese students eventually will study at European
 institutions.
 Western Europe will continue to be a major supplier'of plants and
 equipment for China's modernization drive, although the Europeans face
 stiff competition from Japan and--potentially--the United States.
 Peking is interested in purchasing a wide range of industrial goods,
 including steel mills, petrochemical plants, thermal and nuclear power
 stations, truck plants, and mining equipment.  By'purchas'ing technology
 from various West European countries the Chinese will avoid overdependence
 on one source, gain access to US technology produced in Western Europe

 under license, and promote competition in price and financing terms
 among potential suppliers.  They also hope. to encourage West European
 governments to press for revision of strategic trade controls.                      25X1
 China's military interest in Western Europe goes beyond urging that
 the region look to its own military strength vis-a-vis the USSR.  Peking
 is interested in purchasing modern arms and military technology, including
 such items as antitank missiles, helicopters, and combat aircraft.
 During the past year, Chinese military delegations have visited every
 major national armaments industry In Western Europe.  Moreover, China is
 attempting to create the impression of a military relationship between
 Western Europe and China through visits by West European military delegations
 to Peking, exemplified by the publicity given by the Chinese press to
 the visit last April of the chief of the British defense staff.                   25X1
 China's opening to Western Europe still faces major economic obstacles,
 and there remain important differences over political subjects, particularly
 detente.  Nevertheless, barring a political upheaval in Peking that
 might bring to power a more inward looking, less pragmatic leadership,
 the opening is likely to continue and will probably widen.                        25X1
 EC-China Trade
 A spate of contacts, rumored deals, and negotiations on trade
 agreements highlights the European Community's scramble to profit from
 China's decision to turn again to Western suppliers for technology and
 equipment.  The two-way flow of commodities and cash, however, remains
 small.  Increases implied in recent agreements are on the order of 15-20
 percent per year through the mid-T980s--      'ble target starting from
 current low levels.
 Except for the problems involved in sales of military equipment and
 nuclear technology, constraints on increased EC-China trade are largely
 on the Chinese side--primarily China's limited ability to pay for and
 absorb the goods offered.  While China may now be willing to accept
 conventional foreign credits, Peking still wants to offset imports with
 exports of Chinese commodities.
 For the West Europeans, the key obstacle to meeting trade goals
 will be finding suitable Chinese products at competitive prices.  Soviet
 displeasure with growing EC-China trade, and particularly with the
 prospect of Chinese arms purchases, may affect E.C relations with both
 China and the USSR.  The West Europeans.will consider the Soviet angle,
 as well as US policy, in responding to Chinese requests for goods con-
 sidered sensitive.  Although a turning point appears to have been reached,

 frustratingly long and difficult ne.goti.ations..loom forthe- W_e.s.t Euro-
 peans; regardless of theutcome  China will remain a small market for
 West European industry.
 EC-China Trade Ties
 The EC Commission has sole authority to set general rules for trade
 between member states and outsiders.  Commercial arrangements are left
 up to individual member states whose. bilateral accords cannot specify or
 eliminate quotas or provide for preferential trading arrangements.  In
 November 1974, the EC offered to negotiate trade agreements with state-
 trading countries, including China.  Following mutual diplomatic recognition
 in 1975, China responded favorably to the EC invitation.  An agreement
 was tentatively approved in September 1977 and formally signed in Brussels
 last spring.  The five-year, nonprefere.nti-al agreement contains a weak
 most-favored-nation clause; a "balance trade" clause, according to which
 the two sides promise to make "best efforts" to expand trade at similar
 rates; a safeguard clause, which provides for "friendly consultations"
 in case of EC difficulties with Chinese goods and which tacitly recognizes
 an EC right to apply specific restrictions if difficulties persist; and
 a clause designed to prevent Chinese sales at prices well below market
 levels.
 The agreement allows the EC to maintain its current restrictions on
 selected Chinese goods while calling for the Community to liberalize
 imports from China as much as possible.  For its part, China promises to
 take imports from the EC into "favorable consideration," a promise
 hailed by the West Europeans as a Chinese concession not previously
 granted to any trading partner.  The agreement also establishes a joint
 EC-China Economic Commission to review progress in promoting trade.  The
 initial meeting of the Commission will be held in the first half of 1979.
 Exports from the EC to China reached $1.4 billion in 1975 but by 1977
 had fallen back below $1 billion.  Even in 1975, however, exports to
 China represented less than 0.5 percent of total exports by EC countries,
 or about 1 percent of sales outside the Community.  China's- share of
 imports by EC countries was only about 0.3 percent.. Both market shares
 were well below the levels of the early 1960s.
 Over the past two years, a flurry of Chinese delegations has descended
 on Western Europe.  At each stop, the missions have looked, poked.,
 prodded, and made various---sometipne's'overlappi.ng or contradictory--promises
 to government and business offi.ci.als.  Very few major contracts have
 been signed.  Nevertheless, a, quiet but sharp increase in trade has
 occurred.  In the first half of'1978, EC shipments to China ran close to

 the total for all of last year.  Over the full year, EC exports to China
 no doubt have broken the 1975 record.
 Major European Traders
 West Germany
 The West Germans have been less active than their EC partners in
 obtaining an all-encompassing trade agreement with China, possibly
 because West Germany outsells the rest of its EC partners combined.
 Nevertheless, West Germany agreed in November to begin discussions
 leading toward an economic cooperation agreement.  West Germany recently
 won the first major West European contract from the Chinese since the
 current buying round began.  It calls for a West German consortium to
 provide approximately $4 billion in know-how and equipment to modernize
 the Chinese coal mining and coal mining equipment industries.  While
 financing details still must be worked out, a West German bank consortium
 apparently will provide credit with five- to 10-year terms.  The West
 Germans have also signed contracts for the construction of five petro-
 chemical plants.  A rumored $14 billion contract for West German construction
 of an integrated steel complex will probably be split among suppliers in
 several countries, including Japan and perhaps France, the UK, and
 Italy.
 France
 France's independent foreign policy stance makes Paris the obvious
 first point of contact for the Chinese in Western Europe.  As with
 Franco-Soviet ties, however, the "special relationship" provides only
 limited trade advantages for France.  Although at the forefront in
 negotiations and publicity, the French consistently run a poor second to

 In the current round of Sino-European trade talks, France was the
 first to obtain formal signature of a new bilateral trade agreement.
 The pact, signed in Peking on 4 December by French Foreign Trade Minister
 Deniau, calls for total two-way trade of $13.5 billion in 1979-85.  The
 agreement also stipulates that "best efforts" be made to balance trade,
 and France has promised to make $6.75 billion worth of credits available
 for its exports, probably at interest rates of 7.25-7.50 percent.   The
 credits, reportedly repayable in 10 years, will be made. available only
 as contracts are signed.
 Specific sectors mentioned in the agreement as being of priority
 interest to the Chinese include steel, electrical energy (nuclear,
 hydroelectric, and thermal), mining research, hotels, port facilities,
 aviation, agricultural machinery, rail transport, and oil.  Projects

 listed as being in advanced stages of negotiations--anal for which French
 firms will receive ?preference" from.Pe'kJ.ng if all competitive and
 technical considerations are equal  include a steel complex, a magnesium
 plant, a specialty steels plant, a sugar refinery; and an aluminum
 complex.    The most publicized project connected with the trade package
 is a Chinese commitment to purchase two nuclear power plants, which
 would be built by the French. under US license.  France has pledged not
 to sell the plants until US approval is obtained.  China is pushing for

 of missiles and possibly Mirage aircraft.                                     25X1
 United Kingdom
 A draft UK-China trade agreement was drawn up during Chinese Deputy
 Premier Wang Chen's visit to the UK. in November.  The, draft contains a
 target of $10 billion in total two-way trade during the period 1979-85.
 The signing of the agreement is planned for Industry Minister Eric
 Varley's trip to Peking next April.  The pact lists 12 sectors. of key
 interest to the Chinese, largely duplicating the. French-Chinese list.
 One potential problem is that conclusion of the agreement may hinge on a
 British decision to sell the vertical-takeoff Harrier aircraft.
 The full extent of British credits apparently is still being worked
 out.  A consortium of banks reportedly agreed on 6 December to lend the
 Bank of China a total of $1.2 billion, with repayment in about five
 years and an interest rate of 7.25 percent.  According to the press, the
 funding will work exactly like a standard buyers' credit, with the money
 released to the Bank of China and then to British companies as sales are
 made. The credits will be guaranteed by the British Government.
 Italy
 Italian companies have a relatively long history of activity in
 China, particularly in oil and petrochemical equipment sales.  Italy was
 the first EC member to sign a trade agreement with China, in 1971.  That
 three-year agreement contained a general list of goods to be traded,
 provided most-favored-nation treatment (with exception for EC obligations),
 and established a joint commission to meet at least once a year to
 review progress.  No specific trade target was set.                           25X1
 The Italians are negotiating a new trade agreement with China and
 hope to conclude it early next year.  Given the French and British
 precedents, a target two-way trade goal will probably be specified
 through 1985.  One deal currently being discussed with. the Chinese would
 involve Fiat construction of a tractor plant.  In the long term, Fiat
 hopes to participate in a complex producing trucks and diesel engines.

 development.  Italy has already offered China a $1 billion line of
 credit, although details have not been worked out and probably will not
 be decided until specific contract negotiations are further advanced.
 Sorting Out the Potential Market
 A summation of current Chinese agreements and negotiations involves
 the danger of double-counting. The Chinese are not averse to--and are
 rather adept at--negotiating with several countries for the same items
 at the same time.  For example, aluminum and steel complexes head the
 lists of potential contracts with both France and West Germany.  France
 appears to have the inside track on the initial aluminum contracts
 while, within Western Europe, West Germany could be the first to supply
 steel equipment.  Both the UK and France hope to participate in coal
 modernization plans, but West Germany has already won the lion's share
 of the early contracts in this field.  France and Italy both are confident
 of winning vehicle plant contracts, and all major EC countries are
 bidding on oil development projects--areas in which the United States
 and Japan hold sizable leads.
 Even after allowing for double-counting, China's 1976-85 modernization
 plan could entail a substantial amount of business for all the large EC
 countries.  The plan lists 120 major projects, including:
 -- Ten steel plant complexes.
 -- Nine nonferrous metal plants.
 -- Eight coal fields.
 -- Ten new oil and gas fields.
 -- Thirty electric power plants.
 -- Six major railway networks.
 -- Five major ports.
 Compensation and Balanced Trade
 Compensation and balanced trade are constant themes in talks with
 the Chinese. Most negotiations commence with Chinese offers to pay for
 oil exploration and, equi pment with crude oil, for coal mining equipment

 and technology with coal, and so forth.  Western Europe's response has
 been skeptical, questioning just how much China has to offer.  While
 China's crude oil reserves, for example, may be great, the West Europeans
 note that Chinese crude is not well suited to their refineries because
 of its high paraffin content.  In addition, Peking thus far refuses to
 discount its price to  make Chinese crude competitive with Arab oil that
 is closer to Western Europe.  Italy and France have agreed to buy small
 test shipments of Chinese crude and both have hinted at larger purchases
 in the future.  Italy has mentioned the possibility of taking up to
 20,000 barrels per day in 1979.  A truly significant increase in pur-
 chases, however, depends on West European refining results and Chinese
 price decisions.
 Peking has naturally raised questions about increased West European
 imports of Chinese manufactured goods and liberalization of Western
 Europe's tariff and quota restrictions on Chinese products.  Despite the
 EC-China trade agreement, liberalization will be slow in coming.  It is
 likely to be particularly slow for textiles, a sector in which West
 European firms are already suffering from foreign competition, over-
 capacity, and high unemployment.
 The possibility of West European firms obtaining access to China's
 huge and presumably low-cost labor force for subcontracting and assembly
 operations--somewhat along the lines of the Taiwan, South Korea, and
 Hong Kong models--is being explored.  Although the Chinese until now
 have disdained such operations, associating them with colonialism and
 exploitation, these activities could offset a growing share of the cost
 of Chinese purchases.
 Credits and Direct Investment
 For many years China has adamantly refused to accept overt foreign
 credits.  Suppliers' credits, euphemistically referred to as "defer'red
 payments" by the Chinese, have been used to finance plant purchases.
 The Chinese, however, have now agreed to buyer's credits from France and
 the UK.  In addition, a thinly disguised form of debt has operated
 fairly efficiently, whereby the Bank of China has accepted foreign
 currency in interest-paying deposits and drawn on the deposits to pay
 for imports.  Although deposits have been limited to about one year,
 two-five year deposits are now being considered; five-TO year credits of
 this type may result from current contract and financing negotiations.
 Just how far China will go in accepting standard commercial credits
 and other financial schemes cannot be predicted.  The Chinese have given
 conficting signals on the issue, probably because the leadership is
 still formulating a decision.  West European bankers and government

 officials would prefer to use standard commercial loans or lines of
 credit rather than the deposit scheme.  With a regular line of credit,
 West European banks would have use of the funds until called upon by the
 Chinese, and government guarantees would be easier to obtain.  West
 European banks, businesses, and governments will be flexible on the
 financing issue, and few deals will fall through because of credit

 The possiblity of direct Western investment in China appears more
 remote than conventional trade financing, although again Peking's signals
 are conflicting.  A French business and banking delegation in Peking
 last month reported that China formally proposed that a vehicle manufacturer,
 Peugeot-Citroen, and an aluminum and specialty steel firm, Pechiney-
 Uqine-Kuhlmann, invest directly in Chinese projects.  According to the
 press, the only stipulation was that Chinese capital represent at least
 51 percent of the total investment and ownership.  The Japanese report
 similar proposals.  These reports should be treated cautiously, for they
 may reflect nothing more than China's increased willingness to discuss
 alternative financing possibilities.                                                  25X1

 .From The EC/NATO Perspective
 The story of increasing Chinese - West European relations has
 unfolded in multilateral organizations as well as in the bilateral
 dealings of individual West European states with China.  The West
 European approach so far has been positive but cautious, largely out of
 fear that West European relations with the Soviet Union might be damaged.
 The West European treatment of Chinese relations in the EC and NATO--and
 China's approach to these organizations--has, naturally enough, differed
 because of the differing purposes the organizations themselves are
 designed to serve.
 In the case of both the EC and NATO, China has voiced strong support
 for the organizations' goals:  increased integration for the Community
 and a strong defense against the Soviets for NATO.  With the EC, how-
 ever, it has been both necessary and desirable from the Chinese point of
 view to go beyond verbal support:  necessary, because the EC Commission
 must negotiate trade agreements with outsiders; desirable, because the
 Chinese think a more economically, politically, and militarily integrated
 Europe cannot help but be troublesome to the Soviets.
 The West Europeans, for their part, are interested in trade with
 China and intrigued by the Chinese support for integration; at the same
 time, they are aware of the potential for irritating the Soviets that is
 inherent in stronger EC-Chinese ties.  Hence the caution in the West
 European approach.  There is a sense that the proper amount of EC dealings
 with China might actually make the Soviets more cooperative, while too
 rapid movement toward closer ties could only alarm Moscow and produce
 specific negative results.  The problem, of course, is finding the magic
 ' h th ositive disappears and the negative begins.  What-
 h
 i
 point at w  s    e p
 ever the course of West European - Chinese trade relations, however., the
 EC provides a useful framework within which they can develop.                   25X1
 In the military sphere, there is no organization readily available
 to structure and contain West European - Chinese relations.  This has
 led some West Europeans to suggest that, to the extent they consult each
 other on arms sales to the Chinese, they should do'so in the EC.  Others
 have thought that specific arms sales could be considered by COCOM-the
 Western committee that approves sales of-items based on advanced technology
 to Communist countries.  Most., however, agree that neither the EC nor
 COCOM can treat properly the milita   dimension of the subject--which
 leads, almost inevitably, to NATO.                                               25X1
 From the West European point of view, however, NATO is far from the
 ideal forum.  For one thing, deliberations would be heavily influenced
 by the United States:  a common NATO policy for selling arms to China
 -13-
 Approved For Release 2006/03/17 : CIA-RDP80T00634A000500010037-1
 Approved For Rele
 would not necessarily coincide with an ideal common European policy.
 Another problem is that NATO, loose association of states that it is,
 has traditionally had a difficult time defining itself in relation to
 other parts of the world (except, on most occasions, the USSR).  So it
 is difficult to arrive at common external policies.  Common arms sales
 policies are particularly difficult to arrive at because national economic
 as well as security interests are involved.  In the Chinese case, the
 glaring implications for Ea  -W  t relations increase the complexity of
 25X1       attempts to act in common.
 For many of these reasons, NATO has dealt with the Chinese problem
 in the most general way.  At the North Atlantic Council meeting on 20
 November--the most thoroughgoing recent discussion of China in a NATO
 forum--the West European caution on selling arms to the Chinese was
 evident.  Most of the Ambassadors agreed that the Soviet reaction should
 be a primary consideration of NATO countries in their dealings with the
 Chinese.  Some speakers pointed to the possibility of future political
 turmoil in China; others highlighted the practical constraints on Chinese
 25X1       economic development.
 The Dutch had little success recently in proposing that NATO go
 beyond general discussion and consult on arms sales to China.  While the
 Italians and Canadians were willing, the British and French-;both of
 whom had possible military sales in the works--were opposed.
 Arms sales will continue on a purely bilateral basis for the foreseeable
 future.  This is not merely because the political rhetoric about caution
 conflicts with economic interest.  It is, rather, that some NATO members
 feel themselves to be perfectly capable of exercising caution in selling
 arms to China--without detailed Alliance discussion.  And yet it is
 possible that as more arms are sold (or look as if they might be sold)
 to the Chinese, other members may feel the need for more specific con-
 sultations.  For instance, discussions might be held on the implications
 of a particular sale, with the' understanding that the results of the'
 discussion were in no way binding on the seller.  Or an attempt might be
 made to arrive at a definition of what it is proper to sell--bilaterally--
 to the Chinese:  defensive weapons only--or some offensive weapons as
 well?  However, anything resembling a common policy on arms sales seems
 a distant dream.
 France
 Most French officials see the Chinese opening to Western Europe as
 an opportunity that should be seized upon for maximum advantage--not
 only because of its economic potential but also as another way of enhancing
 French leverage with the USSR.    According to this thesis, the Soviets--
 feeling themselves in danger of encirclement by a Chinese-West European-
 SFCRFT

 Approved For Rel
 U.S alliance--will be more inclined to accommodate European interests in
 hopes of securing their Western flank.  A minority view in the French
 foreign office holds that an increase in Chinese activity and influence
 in Western Europe--particularly if Moscow perceives it as fostered by
 the West Europeans--could provoke unforeseen and possibly dangerous
 Soviet reactions.  Thus, the French reaction to China's probes has two
 predominant themes:  an avid interest in the possibilities, mingled with
 anxiety over the reactions of the superpowers--particularly in such
 areas as arms sales and nuclear exports.
 A more active China on the Soviets' eastern border suits French
 foreign policy.  France is interested in keeping the Soviets off balance,
 in reducing their ability to involve themselves militarily in Africa and
 elsewhere, and in easing their military pressure on Europe.  At the same
 time, France does not want to antagonize the USSR by aligning itself too
 closely with the Chinese.  In its more grandiose moments, France sees
 itself as a sort of Zubin Mehta, orchestrating the superpowers' relations
 with the Third World.  One of its main goals is to bring China into the
 concert of nations, provided that China does not try to play firs
 violin and provided its contribution contains sufficient nuances.                  25X1
 France has long seen itself as the industrial nation best qualified
 to deal effectively with the Third World.  Paris aspires to be more than
 just a principal source of technology for Peking; it hopes to be China's
 main interlocutor and primary point of contact on the European continent.
 The French think that the public way in which the Chinese have
 sought West European technology is intended to create the impression
 that the West Europeans are aligned with Peking in the Soviet-China
 dispute and are not averse to furthering that impression within limits.
 Accordingly, France is happy to be supportive of.China's effort'to
 expose many of its senior officials to Western organization and work
 methods--provided the Chinese do not venture into areas the French
 consider sensitive.  Paris, for example', expects almost 500 Chinese
 students to arrive in France, starting in February 1979.  But the Chinese
 had proposed that over 200 be accepted for advanced studies at certain
 scientific research centers that are considered sensitive by the French.
 According to a Quai official, the French refused.                                   25X1
 Moreover, the French have not yet taken a firm position on the
 transfer of computer technology to the Chinese because of its military
 ramifications and because it might incur Soviet displeasure.  Some 13
 delegations of Chinese technicians visited the French computer research
 center during 1978.  The French do not want to be put in the position,

 however, of providing a few high-technology i_tems,, while more, profitable
 contracts for less, advanced items go to.th.ei,r competi.tors..  In fact, the
 main return the Fren.c.h expect for the. time they spend satisfying Chinese
 interest in such technology is to open th.e. door to a wider array of
 French goods.
 The seven-year bilateral trade agreement signed in Peking in early
 December was a psychological boost to French ambitions in China and a
 signal from the Chinese that they are willing to expand their trade with
 France in at least certain areas.  At the moment, France is more interested
 in economic and commercial sales to China than in arms sales.  France
 has no illusions that China will become a major export market in the
 near future--the ambitious new agreement projects an eight-fold increase
 over 1977 in French-Chinese trade through 1985.  France is starting from
 a low base, however:  France's share of the Chinese import market was
 less than 2 percent in 1977.  France in the past five years dropped from
 fourth to 12th among China's trading partners because of. its inability
 to move beyond occasional one-shot capital equipment contracts into a
 wide spectrum of high volume repeat sales of consumer goods.  France
 feels that, as a late-starter in the newly opened and potentially impor-
 tant Chinese market, it must hurry to establish its share against compe-
 tition from Japan, UK, West Germany, and the United States.  In addition
 to more work for its own industries, France hopes that China will become
 a significant supplier of raw materials,  The signing of what is a
 framework agreement signals a turning point in French-Chinese economic
 relations, but France must now quickly table some highly competitive
 offers in order to exploit the Political and psychological momentum the
 accord has generated.
 Projects that might reach fruition quickly are those involving
 hydroelectric power as well as China's agreement in principle to buy two
 nuclear power plants from France--the first such sale of nuclear technology
 to China by a Western power.  If approved by the United States, the'
 highly coveted order will go to Framatone, a nuclear plant construction
 company financed by the French Government .(COGEMA) and another private
 firm, Altshom-Atlantique.  The sale has yet to be approved formally by
 the Coordinating Committee for Export Control (COCOM), an organization
 set up by industrial nations to screen the sale of sensitive technology
 to Communist countries, but France foresees no objections from other
 COCOM members since China is already a nuclear power..  The sale, however,
 requires US approval since it is a Westinghouse license.  The French
 have received an "exclusively peaceful use" guarantee, from the Chinese
 and have asked the United States for approval prior to 23. December, a
 deadline the Chinese have set.  Other details of the sale. remain to be
 worked out.

 the French are ready to sell defensive weapons: and the. Chinese ready to

 suming.                        But it is likely that some French weapons systems--probably
 defensive--will be ultimately sold.  The French claim that they are
 picking and choosing from the Chinese wish-list and that they have no
 desire to help China achieve strategic objectives.  The French  in fact,
 may be. trying to condition military sales on economic sales.                    25X1
 The Soviets have given the French several sharp warnings against
 selling arms to the Chinese, most recently in a letter from Soviet
 President Brezhnev to French President Giscard last month.  France's
 stock reply to Moscow is that France is a sovereign nation and will'act
 in its own national interest.  France is, however, sensitive to Soviet
 concern and will not deliberately strain its relations with the USSR.
 The French think they are on safe ground by confining sales to defensive
 systems, although they admit            not always easy to determine the
 difference.
 In addition to the economic and nuclear. agreements, the French have
 concluded a scientific and technical accord with the Chinese and now
 hope to add high fashion to the list.  Designer Pierre Cardin has accepted
 a Chinese invitation to organize two fashion shows to beheld in Peking
 and Shanghai next March.  Cardin, who in previous seasons showed a
 modified version of the Mao tunic as part of his collection, now hopes
 to persuade the Chinese to discard their "grotesque" clothes and adopt
 international fashion.  There is undoubtedly a great deal of wishful

 thinking and a bit of cultural chauvinism i:n the French optimism about
 the future Chinese market, but the race for the. embourgeoisement of the
 Chinese is on.
 West Germany
 A responsible German foreign policy may not give in to the tempta-
 tion to play up Soviet-Chinese differences.  (West German Foreign Minister
 Hans-Dietrich Genscher, 23 August 1978)
 The West Germans are clearly pleased, yet somewhat uneasy, about
 the rapid expansion of political, economic, and technical relations with
 the People's Republic of China that has occurred during the past year.
 The "Chinese breakthrough," as dubbed by the Soviet media, has resulted
 in a steady stream of high-level Chinese visitors to Bonn, the virtual
 doubling of West German exports to China, and the conclusion of several
 technical and development accords.  Not since the early heyday of Ostpolitik
 have top leaders in West German industrial and government circles been
 so acutely eastward-oriented.
 The growing China trade has added an economic dimension to the
 already delicate political balancing act inherent in Bonn-Peking-Moscow
 relations.  The Soviets have indirectly warned the West Germans about
 overplaying the economic gains to be had in the Chinese opening to West-
 ern Europe.  West German officials are in fact worried about possible
 economic retaliation by the Soviets for the sharp increase in West
 German economic ties with China.*                                                     25X1

 Some West German officials are concerned the government will be
 unaware of or unable to control commercial deals that could trigger some
 sort of adverse Soviet reaction.  Many of the major deals under consideration
 are for the modernization of specific Chinese industrial sectors, such
 as petrochemicals, which Moscow could conceivably view as directly
 threatening Soviet interests.  Such package deals do not require approval
 It can be argued that the West Germans actually have a measure of
 economic leverage with the Soviets,  West Germany in 1977 supplied nearly
 one-fourth of Soviet machinery and equipment for the chemical industry,
 metal-cutting and forge press equipment, and auto production.  It would
 be hard for the Soviets in the short term to switch to alternate suppliers;
 if they did so, they probabZ  would not get the delivery terms and the
 technology they prefer.

 by the West German Government.  The West Germans, particularly Chancellor
 Schmidt, have gone. to great lengths i:_n.recent.we.e.ks, to assure Moscow
 that such trade ties are simply part of the process of building normal
 relations with China.  Nevertheless, the West Germans: believe that the
 Soviets are irrational on the subject and see little possibility of
 completely assuaging Soviet fears about the Bonn-Peking connection.
 Hints of possible West German "arms sales"* to China are apt to be
 as unsettling to West German officials in Bonn as. they are to Soviet
 officials in Moscow.  During the past year the Chinese have feted a
 variety of West German political and retired military figures, many of
 whom are connected with aircraft and arms-related industries.  The West
 German Government would have to license or approve deals involving
 specific armaments, but has little to say about the end use of ostensibly
 nonmilitary hardware, such as trucks and communication gear, which the
 Soviets tend to lump in the armaments category.
 West German private industry clearly has become less reticent about
 hosting Chinese arms shoppers, but continues to be reluctant to conclude
 any deals without some sort of official sanction.
 'Since 1971 the West German Government has banned the export of
 armaments to so-called areas of tension.  Although senior. officials of
 both coalition parties--the Social Democrats and Free Democrats--have
 defended specific sales to countries not directly affected by "tension,"
 such as Iran, they have also stated their intention to maintain a restric-
 tive arms export poZicy, at least for the foreseeable future.

 The West German Government must also contend with the line on arms
 sales espoused by the opposition parties, the Christian Democrats and
 their Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union.  Both parties publicly
 claim that they would be less reluctant then the present government to
 sell armaments to the Chinese.
 n October, the
 ris ian Democrats' spokesman in the  un estag for defense policy
 publicly called for a "deliberate development" of a "community of interests"
 between NATO and China.  He also said that West German policy should
 "spare no effort" to be of assistance to the Chinese in their modernization
 efforts.
 Regardless of whether the present social/liberal coalition stays in
 power or is replaced by a conservative government, the West Germans will
 remain constrained for some time to come from too actively playing the
 "China card."  Although the Soviets appear to have resigned themselves

 Even here, however, Bonn

 which could damage the hard won and fragile benefits of Ostpolitik.  For
 their part, the Chinese are sensitive to West German concerns about the
 Soviets and have purposely played down anti-Soviet polemics In the West
 German - China context.  For Bonn, however, there remains the tough
 question of determining the limits of Soviet toleration before they are
 exceeded.
 UK
 Relations between the UK and China, which began both to increase
 and improve In the mid-1970s, will expand even more rapidly during the
 next decade.  Although stepped-up bilateral contacts have been confined
 mostly to talk, some concrete deals have been made during the past three
 years and, more importantly, the groundwork has been laid to broaden
 cooperation in such diverse areas as trade, culture, education, public
 health, industrial technology, energy resources, politics, and defense.
 As Peking intensifies its contacts with the outside world, particularly
 the West, the new era in Anglo-Chinese relations will become increasingly
 important for both countries.
 From the Chinese perspective, the step-up reflects the desires of
 the post-Mao leadership to broaden contacts with the West generally and
 specifically to speed up Peking's development program with sophisticated
 Western technology and equipment.  From London's perspective, future
 economic and trade pacts are the most important aspect of cooperation
 with China, since agreements in these areas hold open the prospect of a
 vast new market that could give the British economy a much needed boost.
 Despite the existence of certain limiting factors related to the ability
 of the Chinese to finance and absorb Western goods and technology,
 British leaders see the prospect of a large-scale market as an opportun-
 ity that cannot be missed.*  The British already have offered the Chinese

 extensive lines of credit, including possible government-to-government
 loans, and will conclude. phased agreements geared to the Chinese capability
 to absorb.  Bilateral trade already has. picked up significantly and
 tentative agreement has been reached to bring tw -     rade to between
 $8 and $10 billion by 1985.
 Arms sales will play an important part in future Anglo-Chinese
 relations, both because the UK is willing to supply Peking with weapons
 and military technology and because the Chinese have linked the question
 of expansion in other areas with. London's willingness to sell arms.*
 Peking has expressed an interest in purchasing a varied and substantial
 amount of military hardware, such as tanks, guns, naval vessels, radar
 systems, missiles, aircraft, as well as the spare parts and know-how.
 If agreement can be reached, the most significant and controversial
 deal--symbolically, if not militarily--will be to sell the Hawker-
 Harrier jump jet fighter to China.  The British Government is presently
 considering a Chinese request for the plane  but London   11 move cautiously
 before making a final decision.
 The sale of weapons--particularly offensive weapons--is a sensitive
 issue that Prime Minister Callaghan wants to defuse.  He points out that
 any broad economic or trade agreement will emphasize British industrial
 and commercial goods and that military hardware and technology will
 assume a much smaller role.  Callaghan's rationale is that nonmilitary
 sales probably would be more lucrative in-the long run.  More importantly,
 he recognizes that military sales could have a negative effect on relations
 with the other Western Allies and the  SSR, as well as on domestic
 politics. F__         f
 Callaghan has indicated that the UK does not want to be China's
 lone supplier of military goods and prefers a coordinated Western approach.
 Therefore, London has announced that arms sales to China will be handled
 on a case-by-case basis and in full consultation with Britain's allies.
 *During the mid-1970s the sale of the Spey engine, including license
 to produce it in China, for a Chinese-designed aircraft was the single most
 important deal between Britain and China.  That agreement has recently been
 updated, another jet engine agreement has been made with Vickers, and a deal
 to supply China with marine turbine engines for high-speed naval vessels is
 near completion.  The earliest deal between London and Peking was for the
 Trident jet and, although it is primarily a civilian aircraft, some have
 been adopted for military purposes.

 The sale of defensive weapons does not appear to bother the UK's West
 European allies who are themselves involved in arms deals. with China or
 the United States, but London believes that Washington  i,f not the other
 allies, would be more skeptical about offensive arms..
 The step-up in Anglo-Chinese relations and the possibility of major
 arms deals have brought a sharp reaction from the Soviet Union.  Soviet
 President Brezhnev, in a recent blunt letter to Prime Minister Callaghan,
 warned the UK. to exercise. caution in selling arms. to China, since Peking
 is "not part of arms control talks. and follows an aggressive ideology."
 The Soviet initiative, which climaxed a campaign to dissuade the British
 from selling the Harrier to China, warns that UK-USSR relations could be
 damaged by this and other weapons deals.
 The letter actually may have increased the likelihood of an agreement
 on the Harrier.  Callaghan and Foreign Secretary Owen, not wanting to
 appear to be pressured by Moscow, have indicated that they support moves
 toward detente, but will not permit the Soviets to interfere with growing
 British-Chinese relations or with a specific arms deal.  A stiffening
 attitude in Westminster is likely to increase tensions between London
 and Moscow, which already are high because of Soviet human rights policy,
 adventurism in Africa, and the Warsaw Pact arms build-up.  Nonetheless,
 Soviet anxiety, which is taken seriously by the Callaghan government, is
 one of the most important reasons for delays in completing a Harrier
 deal and, along with the concerns of Britain's allies, will he a major
 consideration in future arms deals.
 The expansion of British-Chinese relations is supported by the
 Labor and Conservative parties, although Labor's left wing has strong
 reservations about arms deals because it fears that they will lead to an
 increase in Chinese-Soviet and Anglo-Soviet tensions.  The Conservatives
 see little chance for a thaw between the UK and the USSR and favor
 strengthening China primarily as a counterweight to growing Soviet rower
 as long as the Chinese do not pose a threat to the security of Britain
 or Western Europe.  For this reason the Tories are particularly anxious
 to see major agreements concluded, and have charged that the Callaghan
 government-a ecause of fear of Soviet reaction--has deliberately dragged
 its feet on the Harrier deal.
 British policy toward China will continue regardless of which party
 wins the next general election.  If a Tory government is returned,
 however, the policy--particularly its military aspects--will be pursued
 even more vigorously, and anti-Soviet undercurrents are likely to be
 more blatant.

 Italy
 During the past year, bilateral contacts and agreements between Italy
 and the People's Republic of China have burgeoned i.n several key areas.
 Rome has welcomed the.opportun.ity to capitalize on a potentially significant
 export market as well as to strengthen ties between. China and Western
 Europe--particularly Italy--on all fronts.  At the same time, Italian
 initiatives have been complicated by problems related to possible Italian
 arms sales to Peking clearl  the most controversial aspect of relations
 between the two countries.
 After establishing diplomatic relations with China in 1970, Rome
 sought persistently to increase Italian trade with Peking but experienced
 uneven success as a result of Mao's commitment to autarky.  But the
 signing of a trade agreement with China in 197] placed Italy in the
 forefront of EC nations dealing with China.  The agreement provided for
 an annual mixed commission meeting to review the progress of bilateral
 trade, numerous exchanges of technical delegations, and participation i.n
 reciprocal trade fairs.  As a result of the treaty, Italy agreed to
 provide China with items such as machine tools, agricultural machinery,
 chemical products, and motor vehicles in return for textiles, food
 products, and handicrafts.  The volume of this trade, however, was
 strictly limited by_the Chinese preference for deferred or installment
 payments over the extension of export credits--a fact dictated by Peking's
 chronic shortage of hard currency and its desire to keep exports and
 imports balanced.
 Improving Trade Prospects
 The current Chinese leadership's-more outward looking policies have
 greatly improved the prospects for Sino-Italian cooperation, especially
 in the industrial and technological fields.  This attitude was underscored
 by Chinese Foreign Minister Huang 1-1ua's unofficial visit to Italy in
 early October.  Although Huang signed bilateral cultural, scientific,
 and technological agreements while in Rome, I'tali'an Foreign Ministry
 officials viewed his trip as having three broader objectives:  to heighten
 West European perceptions of the Soviet threat, to use that as a basis
 for greater Sino - West European cooperation, and to arrange West Euro
 participation in Ch.ina's 20-year development plan.                               25X1
 The most recent Sino-Italian trade statistics give some idea of the
 dimensions of the new Chinese opening to the West.- In the past year,
 for example, the Chinese sent four trade delegations to Italy, and
 during the first half of 1978 Italian exports to China increased by over
 300`percent, compared to the same period in 1977.  The total value of
 Italian exports to China--$70 million--now slightly exceeds the value of

 Approved For Release 2006/03/17 : CIA-RDP80T00634A000500010037-1
 their imports for the first time in three years.  Despite the improvements,
 the current level of trade is still not commensurate with Rome's ability
 to supply or with China's ability to consume Italian products.  A significant
 expansion of bilateral trade can only be achieved if the Italians convince
 the Chinese to buy entire "turn-key" industrial plants, to accept lines
 of export credits, or to agree to trades involving industrial plants or
 production for Chinese energy-producing supplies such as coal and oil.
 I                     I
 Last February, Italian Foreign Ministry officials recognized their
 country's potential to play a role in China's master plan, especially
 those-aspects involving improved transportation and increased agricultural
 mechanization.   There were signs, for example, that the Chinese were
 interested in having Fiat build a proposed truck and diesel engine
 factory--at a total cost of $8 billion.  At that time, Italian Foreign
 Minister Forlani even ventured to suggest to Ambassador Gardner that
 such projects could, over the long term, mark the reorientation of
 Italian trade away from the Soviet bloc and toward China.
 Italy wasted no time reacting to the apparently favorable Chinese
 attitude.  In recent months, several high-level Italian delegations--
 representing both government and industry--have visited Peking.  One of
 the most significant trips was led by the Italian Minister of Transpor-
 tation, who returned with the impression that China wanted to sell some
 of its oil to a West European country.  Subsequent negotiations culminated
 last November in the first large-scale petroleum contract between Peking
 and a West European country.  Although the amount of oil involved--100,000
 metric tons--is relatively small, the deal could conceivably result in
 much broader trade agreements involving entire Italian industrial plants
 in exchange for more substantial amounts of Chinese oil.  11

 The Question of Arms Sales
 The one area in which bilateral relations seem stalled Is the
 question of Italian arms sales to Peking.  Italy faces a dilemma:  On
 the one hand, arms exports traditionally have contributed to the improvement
 of the trade balance and the expansion of employment opportnities in the
 fragile Italian economy.  On the other hand, the Italian Government is
 constrained by fear of an adverse react ion on the part nf thp Soviets.

 The PCI's Position
 The question of arms sales to China is a complex one for the Italian
 Communists.    They have recently shown a keen interest in reestablishing
 party-to-party relations with the Chinese.  Such a move would also serve
 to emphasize to domestic and foreign audiences the PCPs independence
 from the Kremlin.
 Chairman Hua Kuo-feng's trip to Yugoslavia last fall produced
 rumors that the Chinese were willing to reestablish relations with the
 Italian Communists.  The PCI reacted warmly and also took a positive
 view of Foreign Minister Huang Hua's subsequent visit to Italy.  But de-
 spite the PCI's apparent willingness, little concrete progress has been
 made in improving relations between the Italian and Chinese parties.
 This probably reflects Peking's continuing skepticism of the PCI's
 independence as well as its desire to pursue relations on a state-to-
 state basis with the Italian Government.
 The Italian Communists hope to improve their ties with the Chinese
 without needlessly antagonizing Moscow.  The PCI might thus be inclined
 merely to look the other way-.particularly if an arms deal with Peking
 included mainly defensive weapons and was concluded quietly.  Sales
 through third-country outlets or international arms traffickers might
 permit the PCT to disclaim responsibility.  But if the Italian Communists
 were forced to make an official public record of their position on arms
 to Peking, there is a greater chance they would o  ose the deal to keep
 peace with the Soviets.

 Greece/Turkey/Cyprus-
 China's contacts with Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus had been quite
 limited before. the visits of Foreign Minister Huang Hua to Ankara and
 Athens earlier this year.  They now promise to increase as China seeks
 to counter Soviet influence in the region and as the eastern Mediterranean
 countries try to exploit Peki'ng's interest for political, economic, and
 even security benefits.  China's positions on issues affecting the
 region underscores its greater interest in recent years i     ten th-
 ened Western Europe able to cope with any Soviet threat.
 Background
 Relations between the three countries and China date back to 1971-
 72, when Ankara, Nicosia, and then Athens recognized Peking.                   At that
 time, the unexpected abstention of Cyprus on the vote to bring China
 into the UN--as well as the yes votes of other so-called ministates--was
 one of the factors leading to Peking's entry into that body sooner than
 either its opponents-or its supporters had expected.  In establishing
 ties with Peking, none of the three countries felt it was doing more
 than conforming to the growing view in the West that China could no
 longer be ignored.  On a more positive note, Greeks and Turks were
 hoping for profitable commercial ties with Peking and for diplomatic
 support of their respective cases on the Cyprus problem.  For the Chinese,
 the eastern Mediterranean connection was yet another effort to inch
 their legitimacy and to match. the Soviet presence . i n the-area.
 Ties Developing Slowly
 The Hua visits to Ankara and Athens were in fact aimed at countering
 Soviet initiatives such as the invitations to-Turkish Prime Minister
 Ecevit and Greek Foreign Minister Rallis and Moscow's proposals for a

 far-reaching Soviet-Turkish "political document."  In addition to delivering
 warnings in both.,capi.ta.ls.. about Soviet i.ntenti.ons, Hua agreed in Ankara
 to the. activation of a dormant. committee t~.conside.r greater economic
 cooperation.  I?n Athens., he.si'gne.d a cultural cooperation agreement--the
 first of its kind with.-a' West European country--that provides for scientific,
 educational, and cultural exchanges.  Greek and Ch_inese.leaders, also
 agreed to look into the possibili'ty-of broadening their economic cooperation,
 particularly in the maritime fi.eld..  Hua invited Eceyit and Greek. Prime
 Prior to the Hua visit, neither Peking nor any of the. three. countries,
 except perhaps Cyprus, had shown much interest in developing political
 and economic ties.  Close. party ties were not feasible because the
 Communist parties in Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus are generally pro-
 Soviet, and pro-Chinese. splinter groups are insignificant.  To be sure,
 Peking signed trade agreements with all three countries during ministerial
 and, in the case of Cyprus, presidential visits, to Peking between 1972
 and 1974, but these. did not significantly advance. commercial ties.  In
 1977, for example, Greek, Turkish, and Cypriot trade turnover with China
 only amounted to $5 million, $7 million, and $300,00.0 respectively, most
 of it in the form of Greek and Turkish exports of    icultural products
 and raw materials to China.
 China Neutral on Regional Disputes
 If the economic gains of the Peking connection have been disappointing
 for the Greeks and Turks, so too have been the diplomatic payoffs for
 their respective cases on the Cyprus and Aegean disputes.  Peking has
 pursued an evenhanded policy on both, generally abstaining on the Cyprus
 issue in the UN and listening without comment to the Greek and Turkish
 views on the Aegean.  Such commentary as they have made portrays these
 issues as yet another example of su er owe --      ularly Soviet--
 machinations in the region.

 about the adverse. effect th.e.di:sputes are. having on NATO.  In a policy
 that differs little-from that-of the Western allies of Greece and Turkey,

 Peking has urged Greece to
 return fully  oNATO, and Hua expressed satisfaction at the Karamanlis
 government's recent moves in that direction.
 Hua also praised Karamanlis for his efforts on behalf of West
 European unity and expressed support for Greece's bid to join the EC.
 Similarly, the Chinese have welcomed Karamanlis' initiatives on behalf
 of Balkan cooperation, which they see as an antidote to Soviet influence
 in the region, particularly in the post-Tito era in Yugoslavia.
 Outlook
 Relations between Peking and the three countries are likely to
 improve further, but the process is apt to be slow.  Although Greeks and
 Turks appreciate Peking's new interest in their region and in a strengthened
 Western Europe, they continue to view their relationship with the Soviet
 Union and their more immediate Communist neighbors as more important
 politically and economically.  And while they welcome China's presence
 as a counter to Soviet influence, they are also concerned about the pos-
 sible adverse consequences of the intrusion of the Sino-Soviet rivalry
 into their area.  China, for its part, gives greater priority to improving
 its ties with the larger and technologically more advanced West European
 states, from which it hopes to secure arms. and the means to rapid modernization.
 Greeks and Turks do, however, appreciate China as a potential
 market for their products, and this appreciation is apt to grow as their
 export capabilities develop.  And if the USSR adopts a more active
 foreign policy in the region in the post-Tito era, both the eastern
 Mediterranean states and Peking may see it in their interests to strengthen
 their ties. F_                                                  I

 visit to China in 1960 before he became involved in Canadian politics.
 The country fascinated him, and as part of his campaign to be prime

 minister eight years later, he promised to work toward establishing dip-
 lomatic relations.  China was already a major market for Canadian wheat,
 and Canada had high hopes for both expanding the bilateral relationship
 and for playing a special role in convincin  the Chinese to broaden
 their contacts with the rest of the world.
 Diplomatic relations were established in 1970 and a steady stream
 of Canadian officials visited China to discuss trade and other matters.
 The high point of these early years was Trudeau's official visit in
 1973.  He concluded a wide range of bilateral agreements that covered
 consular relations, most-favored-nation treatment, establishment of a
 joint trade committee, a long-term wheat sale, and a unique family
 reunion program.  Under the program, some 3,000 Chinese have joined
 relatives in Canada.  Trudeau talked extensively with Premier Chou En-
 lai and met Chairman Mao Tse-tung for two hours in what the New China
 News Agency described as "a friendly atmosphere."  The Canadians took
 this to mean that China highly favored Canada.
 The opening to China fit nicely into Trudeau's "Third Option," set
 out in 1972, which was an attempt "to create counterweights" to the
 heavy US influence in Canada and to develop a distinct identity in
 international politics.  The Canadian public--almost as fascinated with
 China as Trudeau--also favored this move.  The US Embassy in Ottawa
 surmises that in the Chinese view, part of the attraction was
 Canada as a strategically placed window on North America.
 But the Canadians became disappointed with the relationship.  China
 was mainly interested in buying wheat, and last year wheat still accounted
 for 83 percent of Canada's exports to that country.  Finished goods
 represented only .3 percent of total sales to China in 1977.  After
 Trudeau's trip, four years passed before another cabinet-level minister
 visited China, again to sell wheat.  Canada concluded that its limi,ted
 relationship was probably as qlose "as it is possible for a Western
 country to have with China."
 The new outward-reach policy of China has reinvigorated Canadian
 interest.  This time the Chinese are the initiators of delegations and
 agreements. In October 1977, Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua, former
 Ambassador to Canada, chose Ottawa for his first visit abroad as Foreign
 Minister.  A steady stream of other delegations followed, including
 Chinese experts who have been quietly scouring Canada for advanced
 technology.  Canadian officials see these trips as evidence of a con-
 centrated Chinese effort to absorb Western know-how.  They point to the
 Chinese push to train thousands of studepts in the'W6st--up to 500 of
 them in Canada--as part of this effort.

 Approved For Release                -            4A000500010037-1
 Canadian businessmen also got the message.  A. high-level Canadian
 industrial and commercial delegation in Peking in October received a
 "promise of over $10 billion of trade between now and 1985," up from
 about $2.2 billion over the past six years..  One observer estimated,
 however, that this jump would be just enough to maintain Canada's current
 share of 2 percent of China's external trade.
 Canadians, concerned that the 7 to 1 trade imbalance in favor of
 Canada would inhibit the Chinese from making further deals, are busily
 devising ways to keep the imbalance within bounds China will find acceptable.
 There are few Chinese products that Canada wants to buy, but businessmen
 are exploring other methods, such as "triangulating" trade (receiving
 payment in goods that Canada then sells to a third country), to encourage
 China to deal with Canadian companies.  F777                      I
 As a member of NATO, Canada has been concerned about the security
 aspects of other countries selling arms to China, and has no visible
 intentions to do so itself.  Fear of Soviet reaction could play a part,
 but would not weigh nearly as heavily as it does on West Europeans, who
 face the Russian bear on their doorstep.
 The Canadians, eager to share in the boom in sales to China, take
 comfort from the Chinese assurances that they will favor Canadian goods
 over those of the US, given comparable technology and price.  These
 assurances will probably not hold good in light of the normalization of
 relations between the United States and China.  Observers point out, in
 addition, that the US generally outperforms Canada in most areas, that
 Japan is already far ahead of everyone else in trade with China, and
 that !lest European industrialists have also made inroads.  Thus, while
 Canadians believe that they were a contributing factor in China's emergence
 from isolation, they realize with regret that Canada can no longer
 claim to the best relationship with China of any Western country.                 25X1
 Mal Malta
 D
 Prime Minister Mintoff has always emphasized Malta's links with the
 Third World and with most Communist countries except the USSR.  It is
 not. surprising, therefore, that he agreed to China's request for diplomatic
 recognition in 1972 or that he accepted Peking's terms:  the severance
 of relations between Valletta and Taipei Since then, Mintoff has
 traveled to China three times and economic relations between China and
 Malta have deepened.  Chinese assistance to Malta is substantial and has
 had a significant impact on the country both economically and politically.

 Economic Ties
 Shortly after diplomatic recognition, China agreed to grant Malta a
 $45-million interest free loan, with no conditions attached.  A $4.6
 million line of credit was also included in the package.-  The $45 million
 loan is being used for a variety of projects, but the most important is
 the construction of a drydock facility that will be capable of servicing
 300,000 ton vessels; when completed it will be one of the largest facilities
 of its kind in southern Europe.  There are approximately 100 Chinese
 technicians involved in the project, which has been plagued with a
 variety of problems ranging from language barriers between the Maltese
 and Chinese to the inexperience of both sides in building a facility of
 this size.
 Meanwhile, China has emerged as one of Malta's major trading partners,
 accounting for about 30 percent of Valetta's transshipment business.
 The percentage will increase, moreover, under the terms of a May 1978
 agreement calling for more Chinese ship visits.  The Chinese have also
 contracted for more ship repair visits and for the construction of a
 variety of small vessels; two 5,700 ton petroleum carriers have already
 been delivered.  The carriers are Malta's most significant export to
 China, but do little to correct the heavy trade deficit with the Chinese.
 Domestic Impact
 Projects such as the drydock construction help shore up Mintoff's
 domestic political base.  With. the British military forces scheduled to
 withdraw from Malta on 31 March 1979, unemployment is certain to increase
 and Mintoff--who depends on Malta's labor movement for much of his
 political strength--could become more vulnerable politically.  The new
 drydock's increased capacity for ship repair and modification should
 offset some of the unemployment potential since it will be inaugurated
 next March.  The threat of unemployment in Malta's present drydocks
 should be reduced by further contracts for a variety of vessel construction.
 Even the Nationalist opposition, which had been cool. to China when
 it was in power, has been compelled to take notice of China's economic
 contribution to Malta.  In July 1978, at Chinese invitation, a Nationalist
 delegation headed by opposition leader Fenech Adami paid a five-day
 goodwill visit to China.  The Chinese invitation to the Nationalists is
 a clear ''signal to Mintoff that China has no qualms about dealing with
 his oppositi-on if t    would facilitate blocking an eventual Soviet
 presence in Malta.

 Chinese Objectives
 Keeping the Soviets. out of Malta is clearly the main Chinese motive
 in establishing strong economic and diplomatic links with Valletta.
 Since the Soviets lost their Egyptian bases, it has become more difficult
 to resupply and refit their Mediterranean naval squadron.  Obviously,
 the Soviets would like a replacement for these lost facilities.  Malta
 possesses everything they need--strat  is location, drydock facilities,
 and a skilled labor force to man it.
 China will probably continue to support Mintoff as long as he
 maintains his current policy of neutrality--with an emphasis on aloofness
 toward the Soviets.  And given his excellent relations with Peking,
 Mintoff would have to think long and hard before yielding to Soviet
 overtures.
 The Soviet Response I                  I                    25X1
 With each demonstration of Western receptivity to overtures from
 the Chinese, Moscow professes to be more alarmed.  In even the most
 minor incidences of conciliation or cooperation, the Soviets perceive an
 unsettling new alignment of international forces, an alignment directed
 primarily against themselves.  But the increasing stridency of their
 warnings and threats against this Chinese-Western rapprochement is
 doubtless accompanied by a growing realization among the Soviet leadership
 that there is little--if anything--they can do to prevent it.  F                 25X1
 The Soviets condemn China's growing connection with Western Europe
 in all its manifestations, from innocuous cultural exchanges to suggestions
 of overt military support.  Party-level dealings--for example, Chinese
 Premier Hua Kuo-feng's recent visit to Romania and Yugoslavia and the
 favorable reactions of the Italian and Spanish Communist parties---
 complete the threat posed by warming state relations and the evident
 willingness in some West European capitals to balance their Soviet
 connection with their new Chinese one.  The Soviets have closely moni-
 tored the nature and development of each country's relationship with
 China, particularly those whose governments are considering sales of
 military hardware.  The Soviets see multiplying Western sales and investments
 in China as strengthening the Chinese not only economi-cally, but--most
 significantly--politically.  They appear to. realize that any genuine
 military impact would be further down the road.                                  25X1
 It is unquestionably the political, impact of West European arms
 sales to China that disturbs the Sovitets most profoundly, particularly
 the global perception of the success of China's anti-Soviet policies.

 But while they have said they would regard such sales as "unfriendly
 acts," they are clearly unwilling to ri.sk alienating the West Europeans
 with strong-arm tactics.  Moscow may also have concluded that arms sales
 to the Chinese--of defensive weapons, at least--are inevitable, and that
 a moderate approach on the Soviets' part may induce the. West Europeans
 to place some limitations on their dealings with the Chinese.  Soviet
 Embassy officials and military attaches in West European capitals are
 energetically seeking information on possible Chinese military pur-
 chases.  It is also possible that Moscow will attempt to enli.st some
 Third World countries to support its position.
 The tone of Soviet diplomatic demarches to West European governments
 concerning arms sales to the Chinese has been cautionary, the theme
 being China's warlike intentions and the certain damage to international
 detente.  This was the approach taken by Soviet President Brezhnev
 during his talks with West German Chancellor Schmidt in Bonn last May
 and by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko on his visit to Paris in late
 October.  The Soviet media ceaselessly echo this warning, only more
 stridently.
 The Soviets can be expected to maintain and 'amplify their outcry
 against arms sales.  It is doubtful, however, that Moscow will take
 stronger measures if such mea'sures.threaten to harm Soviet interests
 without ensuring the desired impact on West European. policy.  SALT,
 MBFR, or bilateral economic arrangements could well prove to be the next
 forum the Soviets choose to express their displeasure over the West's
 Chinese connection.
