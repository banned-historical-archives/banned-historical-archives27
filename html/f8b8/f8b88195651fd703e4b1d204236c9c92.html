 Terrorism Review 25X1
 Focus             Upsurge in Dramatic Attacks in September
 The rapid-fire sequence of terrorist incidents during the first half of September has
 raised questions about whether terrorist groups in the Middle East, Western
 Europe, and Latin America may have coordinated their actions. We have no
 information to suggest this, and there are few historical instances in which terrorist
 organizations are known to have communicated their plans for specific operations
 with each other.
 A variety of factors are likely to have contributed to the coincidence in timing:
 ? In some cases, the same group may be responsible for several closely timed
 attacks. Abu Nidal, in particular, is known to cluster its operations. Although
 the evidence is not yet conclusive, that group is a prime suspect in both the
 Istanbul synagogue attack on 6 September and the Pan Am hijacking in Karachi
 the day before.
 ? Copycat attacks often follow major terrorist incidents. Terrorist organizations
 seeking to maximize their media impact probably calculate that even low-level
 actions receive greater publicity in the wake of high-profile attacks. The seizure
 of the Iraqi Airways office in Paris by Kurds on 8 September was covered in the
 front pages, probably only because it came on the heels of the Karachi and
 Istanbul incidents.
 ? Dramatic terrorist incidents tend to sensitize the worldwide audience to the
 broader terrorist problem at a time when many groups are carrying on business
 as usual. The Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction (LARF) carried out
 bombings in Paris of a commuter train, City Hall, a cafeteria, a bar, the central
 police headquarters, and a clothing store in order to intensify pressure on French
 authorities to release George Abdallah, LARF's leader. Earlier LARFattacks-
 intended to reach the same goal-were covered in the press in late 1985, but
 were not noticed to the same extent by the public at large. In West Germany, the
 attack on the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution on
 8 September fits the pattern of Red Army Faction attacks on institutions
 representing the state-a pattern that is probably unrelated to any particular
 timing. The bombing on 7 September of a Dutch firm involved in construction at
 a NATO airbase scheduled to house cruise missiles resembles other actions
 against defense-related construction firms that have occurred in several NATO
 countries since 1982.
 ? In some cases, simultaneous timing is purely coincidental. The attempted
 assassination on 7 September of Chile's President Pinochet by the Manuel
 Rodriguez Patriotic Front undoubtedly required a great deal of planning and

 only by happenstance culminated in an attack during this period of highly
 visible terrorist incidents. Likewise, the murders of several legislators in
 Colombia were a result of the domestic political situation rather than a
 reflection of international developments elsewhere.
 It is becoming increasingly difficult to assign responsibility for specific terrorist
 acts to a particular group as we appear to be witnessing the development of a new
 phenomenon-the freelance terrorist. Although there are few historical instances
 in which terrorist groups are known to have cooperated operationally, there are
 increasing signs of contact between individuals who may belong to different
 terrorist organizations. The freelance terrorist may be less concerned about
 carrying out operations on behalf of a particular group than just participating in
 violent activities.
 Outlook
 Although we may see a falloff in spectacular attacks, international terrorism is
 unlikely to decline. During the first half of 1986, the number of such incidents-
 450-was up some 25 percent, and the number of casualties increased almost 30
 percent over the comparable period in 1985.
 These figures allow us to draw some additional conclusions about the September
 attacks:
 ? The trend toward a larger number of casualties in 1986 reflects the willingness
 of Middle Eastern groups to carry out indiscriminate attacks designed to cause
 maximum casualties and gain worldwide publicity.
 ? International terrorism tends to be cyclical-periods of low-level activity are
 often followed by an outbreak of high-profile attacks. Major terrorist incidents
 like the Pan Am hijacking and the Istanbul attack were sophisticated operations
 requiring substantial advance planning and logistic procurement. Apparent lulls
 in terrorism are likely to be just preparatory periods for future attacks. The
 surges, such as we have recently experienced, should probably be expected after
 a period of relative quiet.

 Key Indicators
 we suspect Abu Nidal may have been responsible.
 Pan Am 747 Hijacked
 Twenty-two people were killed and nearly 100 wounded 5 September when four
 gunmen seized a Pan Am 747 in Karachi. After killing one American, the
 hijackers threatened to kill one passenger every 10 minutes unless they were
 provided a flightcrew to replace crew members who had escaped during the seizure
 and were flown to Cyprus. Although two deadlines passed without further
 incident, the gunmen opened fire on the passengers after the airplane's lighting
 failed. The four gunmen, along with a fifth conspirator arrested 10 September in
 Islamabad, are in Pakistani custody and have given varying accounts of their
 origins and goals. Several groups have claimed responsibility for the hijacking, but
 explosive belts they were wearing detonated.
 Istanbul Synagogue Massacre Kills 22
 On 6 September, 22 persons were killed and seven wounded when gunmen posing
 as tourists stormed the Neve Shalom synagogue in Istanbul, hurling grenades and
 strafing the congregation with machinegun fire. Two terrorists were killed when
 Several groups have claimed responsibility, including Islamic Jihad and Abu
 Nidal. Although we have not determined who was behind the attack, the operation
 was similar to Abu Nidal attacks in Vienna and Rome in 1981 and 1982 in which
 terrorists threw grenades and indiscriminately fired on worshipers.
 LARF Bombings Rock Paris
 In September the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction (LARF) carried out a
 number of bombings against French interests in Paris in its latest effort to force
 the French Government to release LARF leader George Abdallah.' By late August
 the press was reporting that LARF was upset over the failure to release its leader
 and that it would renew its intimidation efforts after 1 September:
 ? On 4 September a large bomb misfired aboard a subway train during the evening
 rush hour; had it detonated properly, scores probably would have been killed and
 wounded.
 ? On 8 September another bomb went off in the post office in Paris City Hall,
 killing one woman and wounding some 20 other persons.
 ? On 12 September a bomb exploded in the men's room of a department store
 cafeteria, injuring 41 persons.

 ? On 14 September a bomb was discovered in a crowded bar on the Champs
 Elysee. It was removed to a nearby parking garage, but it detonated en route-
 killing one policeman and injuring another policeman and a waiter.
 ? On 15 September a bomb went off in the Central Paris Police Headquarters,
 killing at least one person and injuring 50 others, six of them seriously. Many of
 the victims were policemen.
 ? On 17 September a clothing store in the Montparnasse area was bombed, killing
 four persons and injuring more than 60 others.
 The bombing campaign appears to have strengthened French resolve in the
 Abdallah case, at least for the short term. In the face of stiffened public opinion,
 the Chirac government apparently decided not to release Abdallah in October but
 to try him in February 1987 for complicity in the murders of US and Israeli
 diplomats in 1982. He is unlikely to be convicted in either case, however, and could
 thus be freed after those trials.
 FPMR Attempts Assassination of President Pinochet
 On 7 September President Augusto Pinochet was slightly injured following an
 attack on his motorcade by about 30 members of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic
 Front (FPMR). At least five security guards were killed and a number wounded
 during the rocket and automatic weapon attack. Pinochet reportedly credits his
 survival to the quick reaction of his driver, the inability of the rocket fired at his
 car to arm itself in flight, and the fortuitous arrival on the scene of a police patrol
 car that blocked the terrorists' pursuit. Following the attack, Pinochet reimposed
 the state of siege that he had lifted in June 1985.
 In the wake of the attack, Chilean security forces are rounding up scores of
 suspected leftists. Jose Carrasco, the international editor of the leftist weekly
 Analysis, was taken away from his home by unidentified armed individuals on
 8 September. Later that day his body was found, riddled with bullets, near a
 Santiago cemetery. Also on 8 September unidentified persons killed a judge's son,
 and on 9 September the body of a political activist was found in one of Santiago's
 slums. At least two of those murdered had some connection to the Movement of
 the Revolutionary Left. Paramilitary forces associated with the Chilean security
 forces probably are responsible for the killings. Thus far Pinochet's actual
 attackers remain at large.
 West Germany             American Next RAF Target?
 The pattern of West Germany's Red Army Faction (RAF) attacks in 1986
 increases our concern that the threat to senior American and military diplomatic
 personnel in West Germany has increased substantially and probably will remain
 high for some time. The RAF hardcore has carried out two assassinations in
 1986-Dr. Karl-Heinz Beckurts on 9 July and Dr. Gerold von Braunmuehl on 10
 October-and apparently has embarked on a major terrorist campaign with the
 support of the group's illegal militants. According to statements made by the group
 in claim letters, the targets of these assassinations represented two groups the RAF

 cites as primary enemies-the "military-industrial complex" and the "repressive
 organs of the state." The hardcore, however, has yet to hit a third target sector-
 the formal military establishment in West Germany.
 The claim letters also continued vitriolic rhetoric castigating the American
 military establishment for supporting the US and German Governments'
 "repressive" policies. The RAF has never attempted to assassinate senior West
 German military personnel, although they have carried out bombings and arson
 attacks against Army installations. On the other hand, the group attempted to
 assassinate US Army Generals Haig and Kroesen and has been responsible for the
 deaths of at least six American soldiers and dependents since 1972 in bombings of
 US military facilities in West Germany.
 Western Europe   Kurdish Violence on the Rise
 A series of incidents involving Kurds has some West European officials concerned
 that increased Kurdish activity could turn violent. A group of about a dozen Kurds
 claiming to be armed with explosives seized the Iraqi Airways office in Paris on
 8 September and threatened to blow it up unless reporters listened to its protests
 against the Turkish and Iraqi Governments. After the group surrendered, it was
 found that it had no explosives. A member of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
 was arrested on 15 August while picking up explosives to be used in an attack
 against the Turkish Consulate in Hamburg, West Germany. A week later, the
 Dutch arrested an armed PKK activist planning to attack a Turkish Consulate in
 the Netherlands.
 The incident on 8 September and the one in the Netherlands probably were in
 retaliation for the Turkish air raid on Kurdish camps in Iraq on 15 August that
 caused considerable casualties. The Kurdish plot in Hamburg, however, probably
 was unrelated and already set in motion before the Turkish raid.
 The arrest on 15 August of Faruk Bozkurt, a Kurd allegedly planning an attack on
 the Turkish Consulate General in Hamburg, has prompted several incidents in
 Western Europe by sympathizers protesting his detention. On 16 September
 approximately 60 protesters assembled in front of a West German radio station in
 Hanover and demanded Bozkurt be freed. Another 30 demonstrators pressing for
 Bozkurt's release seized the West German Consulate in Amsterdam on
 24 September and occupied it until police and the consul general negotiated their
 peaceful departure. The same day a group occupied a German Reformed church in
 Paris until a West German Embassy representative agreed to meet with them to
 discuss Bozkurt's case.
 The Kurds who seized the consulate in Amsterdam reportedly are supporters of
 the Kurdish National Liberation Front, an arm of the PKK, that seeks to obtain
 an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. Last year PKK supporters
 and members protesting Sweden's detention of PKK spokesman Husayin Yildirim

 occupied several Swedish consulates and held demonstrations in West Germany.
 Similar incidents against West Germany are likely to occur as long as Bozkurt-
 an attack on the US Embassy in Stockholm.
 Americans Threatened in Sweden
 Reports of Arab terrorists threatening Americans in Sweden suggests the relative
 freedom from terrorism this country has enjoyed may be drawing to an end. On
 17 September an anonymous phone caller claimed that a group with Libyan or
 Syrian connections was planning to detonate a bomb aboard a ferry while it was
 traveling from Stockholm to Helsinki. A short time after the call, Swedish police
 observed three men behaving suspiciously in the boarding area of a passenger ferry
 preparing to depart Stockholm for Helsinki with some 200 Americans on board.
 Police retrieved a piece of paper thrown into a trash can by one of the men that
 contained reference to a bomb hidden on the ferry. The men escaped in the crowd
 at the dock. Earlier in the month, an Arab terrorist team reportedly was planning
 Counterterrorist Vigilante Group Surfacing?
 Recent French press reporting indicates that active or retired French intelligence
 and police officials may be behind a newly surfaced counterterrorism activist
 group. The "French Liberation Front" (FLF) proclaimed its existence in late
 August in letters to Paris newspapers, denouncing the government as too soft on
 Middle Eastern-sponsored terrorism and citing examples from supposedly
 confidential government information. There is currently no indication that the
 FLF intends to attack physically Middle Eastern suspects in France.
 Resurgence of Rightwing Terrorism?
 Recent incidents in southern France indicate a possible increase in rightwing
 extremist activity, centering around the anti-immigrant group "SOS France." A
 cycle of violence involving the group has included the following events:
 ? On 18 August four members of the group were killed when the vehicle they
 occupied exploded in Toulon. They were probably preparing to bomb an
 immigrant in the Maghrebi neighborhood. Claude Noblia and Yvon Richard,
 the group's president and vice president, respectively, were identified among the
 dead.
 ? On 24 August Toulon police seized 5 kilograms of explosives, several
 handgrenades and a clock (possibly a timing mechanism) in a house that had
 been rented by Richard.
 ? On 29 August a close friend of Noblia was killed by two masked gunmen outside
 his home in Sanary, near Toulon. The acquaintance had attended the funeral of
 the four members the day before.

 This was an unusual flurry of activity during the normally quiet month of August.

 emerge in SOS France.

 alienated much of the Basque population by its recent murder of a former ETA
 leader pardoned under the terms of the Spanish Government's social reinsertion
 program. The program pardons guerrillas who have not committed violent crimes
 and who pledge to give up armed struggle. On 10 September an ETA-M gunman
 shot to death Maria Dolores Gonzales Catarain in broad daylight at a village
 festival in Ordizia near San Sebastian. Catarain, who had been living in exile and
 who had been separated from ETA for almost a year, was the highest ranking
 The Basque community, including members of ETA, has expressed outrage at the
 incident through editorials to the press, strikes, and petitions. Some ETA
 members, including many who have been pardoned, have issued a communique
 requesting help from the parliament, political parties, and the Basque government
 in stemming ETA's current violence. The killing of Catarain appears to have
 struck a chord among disparate parts of Basque society outraged by ETA's
 violence. ETA's attacks have become increasingly more lethal and indiscriminate,
 possibly because it has been hurt by the social reinsertion program, defections, and
 Fren~eration with Spanish authorities in returning ETA members to Spain.
 attacks are particularly severe, they could affect security for the games.
 Basques Protest Barcelona's Candidacy for 1992 Olympics
 The Basque terrorist group Fatherland and Liberty carried out acar-bomb attack
 on a civil guard patrol on 13 September, injuring three paramilitary civil guards
 and a passerby. The alleged reason for the attack was the group's continued
 opposition to "oppressive forces of occupation wherever they may be." It is more
 likely, however, that Barcelona was the site of the blast because it was seeking to
 become the site for the 1992 Olympics. Attacks such as this, however, will raise
 questions about Madrid's ability to provide security for the event and if these
 Bombings in Algarve May Have ETA Link
 Three bombs exploded in the Algarve District early on the morning of
 1 September, causing no injuries.                       the bombs     25X1
 resemble those used earlier by the Popular Forces of 25 April (FP-25), were made
 of plastic "gelomonite" and detonated by battery and watch timing devices. The
 untamped bombs reportedly were identical to a series of devices that exploded on
 14 July in various parts of Portugal. Two persons died in one of those explosions,
 probably while assembling the device.                                 25X1

 Two groups have claimed responsibility for the latest bombings: the "Armed
 Commandos of Liberation," a hitherto unknown organization, and the Armed
 Revolutionary Organization (ORA) that had also claimed credit for the 14 July
 attack. ORA is thought to be a splinter group of the FP-25. The bombings have
 drawn attention to an anonymous letter of 23 August to the Portuguese news
 agency warning of a well organized and equipped joint terrorist offensive by FP-25
 and the Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) group against political and
 economic targets during the September tourist season. Although ETA probably
 was not involved in the attacks or in the manufacture of the devices, its complicity .
 has not been ruled out. The Basque group reportedly has used similar explosive
 Italy/Greece              Agreement To Cooperate Against Terrorism
 Rome and Athens on 22 September signed a security cooperation agreement to
 combat terrorism, drug trafficking, and organized crime. The agreement, which
 calls for biannual meetings between experts to exchange information, resembles
 accords Italy has reached with Tunisia, Israel, Morocco, and the United States but
 does not cover specific operational areas. The accord reportedly is intended to deal
 primarily with terrorism, and only secondarily with drug trafficking and organized
 crime. Bilateral cooperative efforts probably will focus on Middle Eastern
 terrorism.

 Four Terrorists Seized With Sophisticated Explosives
 Moroccan authorities in late August reportedly arrested afour-person terrorist
 squad consisting of two Tunisians and two Palestinians. The Tunisians carried
 explosives disguised as pottery objects. The four planned to conduct attacks in
 Morocco, especially against Moroccan Jews, probably to protest the meeting in
 July between King Hassan and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. The
 terrorists claimed to be loyal to Fatah Central Security member Abdullah Abd
 al-Hamid Labib (Colonel Hawari), whereas Moroccan authorities suspect that on
 the basis of the operational methods and the explosive devices in the terrorists'
 possession, they probably are members of Abu Ibrahim's 15 May Organization.
 We believe, however, that the 15 May Organization may no longer be operating as
 a unit and that former members probably are selling their services to individuals or

 FPMR Arms Caches Discovered
 Chilean authorities discovered three arms caches between 7 and 14 August,
 located in the same general area along the northern coast. The arms belonged to
 the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR), a terrorist group affiliated with
 the Communist Party of Chile, and consisted of a variety of weapons, including
 more than 1,000 Vietnam-vintage M-16s, about 400 Soviet-made rockets, and tens
 of thousands of rounds of ammunition. The third cache reportedly was hidden in a

 The seizure of the weapons represents a major tactical loss for the FPMR. We

 Iraqi Consul Killed in Karachi
 Iraqi Vice Consul Nathal Abdul Salam Abd al-Latif was killed on 14 September
 when a bomb exploded in his car as he drove to work. An unidentified passerby
 was seriously wounded by flying splinters from the explosion. On the basis of
 limited observations of the damaged sedan, it is probable that a small
 antipersonnel device like a handgrenade exploded inside the vehicle. An Iraqi
 dissident group, Al-Rafidain Iraqi Islami, located in Beirut, claimed responsiblity.
 The Iraqis, however, have blamed Iran for the attack. Four months ago a bomb
 was placed under the car of another Iraqi consular official in Karachi but the

 Airport Bombing on Eve of Asian Games
 On 14 September a bomb exploded in a trash can near a crowded main-arrival
 terminal at Kimpo Airport, killing five persons and injuring 29. All the dead were
 South Koreans. According to press reports, an anonymous caller told police that
 radical South Korean students were responsible for the incident. Seoul has claimed
 the explosion was a North Korean-engineered attempt to disrupt the Asian

 between this attack and the 1983 Rangoon bombing that killed 17 members of a

 more than 100 injured. The attack was followed by a 10-minute firelight between

 New Baggage Search Procedures for Explosives
 The Federal Aviation Administration has issued guidelines for more detailed
 searches of suspect luggage by airport personnel because of the increased use of
 suitcase bombs against aircraft and the more sophisticated concealment techniques
 that have emerged in the last year:
 ? Items that do not normally contain metal should be checked with a hand wand
 and any anomalies detected should be followed up with X-rays.
 ? Metallic items (especially calculators, shavers, computers, cameras, radios) must
 be X-rayed to identify the components.
 ? All battery-operated items (including those above) must be X-rayed from two
 different axes to locate any unusual wiring or components. Batteries must be
 removed from the items and placed in luggage carried in the plane's hold.
 ? Suspect baggage itself must be X-rayed while empty and hand-searched for
 modifications, to include the lining, nonstandard hardware, unusual weight, or
 unusual thickness in the baggage's sides or bottom.

 Syrian Support for International
 Terrorism: 1983-86
 Since 1983 Syria increasingly has used surrogate
 terrorist groups to advance its objectives while hiding
 its hand in terrorism-these groups have since carried
 out more than 85 attacks against US, Jordanian,
 Palestinian, and Israeli targets. Damascus provides
 these groups with safehaven, weapons, and bases, and
 terrorist training facilities in Syria and in Syrian-
 occupied Lebanese territory.
 Moreover, two incidents earlier this year-the
 attempted bombing of an EI Al jet in London last
 April and the bombing of the German-Arab
 Friendship Union in West Berlin the previous
 month-revealed direct operational support by Syrian
 personnel.
 $12,000 in cash, and instructions on how to use the
 bomb. On 5 April he returned to London and
 picked up the bomb, which had been flown in from
 Syria. The Syrian Embassy in London then
 provided him with safehaven for 24 hours after El
 Al security officials discovered the device in his
 girlfriend's luggage.
 ? British investigators confirmed that Hindawi made
 a dry run from Damascus'to London in the company
 of two Syrians last February and that several
 Embassy employees were involved in the plot.
 Italian officials interrogated a third Hindawi
 brother and were able to confirm Nizar's ties to
 Syrian intelligence.
 The Smoking Gun: London and West Berlin
 The El Al and German-Arab Friendship Union
 incidents provided the most conclusive evidence of
 direct Syrian involvement in terrorism since the early
 1970s:
 ? Nizar Hindawi, a freelance terrorist living in
 London, claims he went to Damascus and contacted
 Syrian officials in late 1985 to seek funding for a
 new terrorist group in Western Europe.
 ? Hindawi then proposed to his brother Ahmed Hasi
 in West Berlin that Hasi bomb the German-Arab
 Friendship Union because it had withdrawn. its
 support for radical Palestinian terrorist groups. Hasi
 claims he picked up the bomb at the Syrian
 Embassy in East Berlin, and that a Syrian
 explosives expert from Damascus fixed the device
 after it twice failed to explode. Hasi's accomplice
 also independently identified Syrian intelligence as
 the source of the bomb.
 ? Hindawi claims that he received instructions last
 February in Damascus from Syrian Air Force
 intelligence deputy, Haitham Said, for the bombing
 of the El Al jet. Hindawi told interrogators that
 Said provided him with an official Syrian passport,
 ? The El Al bomb was technically similar to the
 "voting day" timer bombs used several times last
 year by Syrian-supported groups in Jordan. A
 similar bomb also was discovered in the luggage of
 an individual arriving at Frankfurt International
 Airport from Damascus in February 1985.
 Palestinian Surrogates
 Syria probably directed its own personnel to remain in
 the shadows following the failed operation in London.
 We see no evidence, however, that Damascus has
 curtailed its support-including weapons, documents,
 training, and safehaven-to various radical
 Palestinian groups, whose terrorist activities continue
 unabated.
 Syria has provided the Abu Nidal group with
 important logistic support since the group moved its
 base from Iraq to Syria in late 1983, allowing it to
 maintain offices in Damascus and training camps in
 the Bekaa Valley, and providing travel documents,
 including diplomatic passports. The move to Syria
 coincided with an increase in dramatic terrorist

 attacks by Abu Nidal-the group carried out 14
 attacks in 1984 and 23 last year, including 16 in
 Western Europe. Syrian support gives Damascus
 considerable influence over the group's operations-
 probably including choice of some targets:
 in the
 Rome airport massacre last December, members of
 the four-man team trained in Syrian-occupied
 territory in Lebanon; they then traveled with Syrian
 military personnel to Damascus, where they
 remained for four days while final preparations
 were made for the attack. Once the team was in
 place in Rome, one member reportedly placed
 several telephone calls to a contact in Damascus.
 points to Abu Nidal as
 responsible for the hijacking of Pan Am Flight 73 in
 Karachi. The hijackers claim to be members of the
 group and to have been trained in the Bekaa Valley.
 One allegedly confessed that the group originally
 departed from Damascus. Technical evidence shows
 that "suicide belts" worn by the hijackers had the
 same packaging, detonator-booster assembly, and
 type of explosive as the bomb discovered by El Al
 security officials in London. Syria may have
 provided Abu Nidal with the devices without
 requiring the group to explain when or how it
 planned to use them.
 ? Abu Nidal reportedly was also responsible for the
 Istanbul synagogue massacre that resulted in 24
 deaths only one day after the Karachi attack. The
 terrorists wore "suicide belts" similar to the ones
 worn by the Karachi hijackers.
 In addition to its primary surrogate, Abu Nidal, Syria
 provides varying amounts of support to other anti-
 Arafat radical Palestinian groups-including the Abu
 Musa Group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
 Palestine (PFLP), and the Popular Front for the
 Liberation of Palestine-General Command
 (PFLP-GC). The degree of Syrian influence varies
 from almost total control to much more tenuous links:
 ? Nasser Hasan al-Ali, the suspect in the attempt to
 bomb an El Al jet in Madrid on 26 June 1986,
 claims to be a member of the Abu Musa group. If
 Abu Musa was responsible, it is almost certain that
 the group would have informed Damascus. Abu
 Musa has been dependent on Syria since its revolt
 against Arafat in 1983 and is now almost
 completely controlled by Damascus. Al-Ali was
 carrying an authentic Syrian passport with a false
 identity at the time of his arrest.
 ? Two other groups supported by Syria, George
 Habbash's PFLP and the Syrian Social Nationalist
 Party (SSNP), attempted a commando attack on an
 The Syrian Terrorist Safehaven
 In addition to the radical Palestinian groups, a variety
 of other terrorist groups receive Safehaven and
 terrorist training in Syria and the Syrian-occupied
 Bekaa Valley: the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary
 Faction (LARF), the Iranian Revolutionary Guards,
 the SSNP, the Japanese Red Army, the Kurdish
 Labor Party, Saiqa, and the Armeninian Secret Army
 for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). These
 groups are in contact with radical Palestinian terrorist
 groups and Syrian officials
 Syria also provides Safehaven to a number of

 Syrian Support Infrastructure
 Assad relies on a selected group of trusted lieutenants
 to implement policy-often bypassing institutional
 lines of authority-and Syrian involvement in
 terrorism reflects his personalistic style of rule. We
 cannot be certain about the level of detail Assad asks
 from his subordinates about specific operations, and
 security officials operating under general policy
 guidelines may occasionally overstep their authority:
 ? Military Intelligence Chief Ali Duba reportedly is
 in charge of dispatching Palestinian terrorist squads
 to Arab and West European countries.
 ? Air Force Intelligence Chief Muhammad al-Khuli
 has long been identified with Syrian support for
 terrorist groups, including Abu Nidal.
 ? Al-Khuli's deputy, Haitham Said, is believed to be
 the principal Syrian link to Abu Nidal. Said, of
 course, was also involved in the London El Al plot.
 Outlook
 In the aftermath of the much-publicized Hindawi
 trial in London, Syria probably will continue to avoid
 using its personnel in terrorist operations. We have
 seen no evidence, however, that Damascus has placed
 restrictions on its surrogate groups.
 Damascus is likely to move more
 cautiously in the coming months, but will not abandon
 use of the terrorist weapon to advance its foreign
 policy objectives.

 Colombia's ELN: A Growing
 Insurgent Threat
 The National Liberation Army (ELN), one of the four
 principal guerrilla groups in Colombia, may become a
 greater threat to domestic order because of its
 increased growth and activity.
 In line with the general escalation of the insurgent
 movement in Colombia, the influence and the threat
 posed by the ELN has grown dramatically in the last
 two years. The group has increased its membership
 and expanded its activities nationwide, especially in
 the oil-rich Arauca Intendancy, where ELN guerrillas
 reportedly control a large part of the countryside and
 attack at will international oil firms operating in the
 region. The ELN increasingly has turned to terrorism
 and sabotage in its strueele.
 Background and Organization
 A pro-Cuban Marxist-Leninist organization, the
 ELN is the oldest of the major insurgent groups. Less
 well known than the M-19 or the formidable
 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
 organizations, the ELN is a hardline guerrilla group
 that is known for its clandestine nature and its
 uncompromising policies. The ELN is the only major
 insurgent group that refused to participate in peace
 talks begun by then President Betancur in 1982. It
 makes extensive use of antigovernment propaganda
 and has attempted to prevent popular participation in
 elections, often by force.
 The group is divided into eight regional and five
 urban fronts, with four zones of operation in Bogota.
 The ELN operates in the central mountain range of
 Colombia and is especially active in the northeastern
 oil-producing Arauca Intendancy and the Norte de
 Santander Department. Ransoms gained in exchange
 for kidnaped oil company officials and money
 obtained from robbery and extortion operations in
 these areas have reportedly greatly increased the
 financial reserves of the ELN, enabled the group to
 improve its military capabilities, and helped to
 consolidate its influence in the Arauca region.

 The ELN is a member, along with the M-19 and the

 coordinates joint guerrilla operations against the

 the CNG, but                          the
 ELN may be assuming the mantle as the leading
 guerrilla group in the CNG.
 Changing Tactics
 Although the ELN has maintained its rural fronts
 since its inception, recently the group has become
 noteworthy for its use of urban terrorist tactics. On
 3 September 1985, elements of the group, possibly in
 conjunction with the M-19, staged a series of
 coordinated attacks against US businesses throughout
 In May of this year, the
 ELN staged low-level attacks at several US-related
 educational facilities in Bogota. Since that time,
 however, attacks by the group suggest a probable
 escalation of economic sabotage against foreign firms
 and other "imperialist influences."
 the ELN has also kidnaped executives and technicians
 of companies involved in oil exploration and the
 construction of pipelines in the Arauca region of
 northeastern Colombia. Using funds obtained from
 the ransoms for these employees, the ELN has
 consolidated its forces in the Arauca area. The ELN
 has also adopted the tactic of direct strikes against the
 economic infrastructure. On 14 July, ELN guerrillas
 bombed two sections of the Occidental-Shell-
 Ecopetrol oil pipeline near the Venezuelan border.
 The pipeline normally carries about 150,000 barrels
 of crude oil per day. The bombing forced the
 temporary suspension of production. On 22 July
 elements of the group attacked another section of the
 pipeline. An ELN spokesman said that the attack was
 part of a series of actions "that will destroy the
 pipeline so as to prevent the multinationals from
 taking away the oil." Between March and April of
 this year, the ELN destroyed three helicopters
 belonging to oil firms and robbed several oil company
 trucks, taking about $80,000.
 On 7 June the Venezuelan Ministry of Defense
 announced an attack against a Venezuelan border
 outpost southwest of Caracas. Various press reports
 indicate that the group responsible consisted of ELN
 members acting on behalf of the CNG. On the
 following day, 25 to 30 ELN guerrillas attacked
 another Venezuelan post in an attempt to acquire
 arms. In addition to obtaining weapons, the border
 attacks by the ELN probably were intended to gain
 support from Colombian and Venezuelan peasants in
 the border area.
 Outlook
 The ELN views the presence in Colombia of foreign,
 especially US, firms as harmful and has sought to
 stymie foreign investment in Colombia through
 attacks on these companies. Thus far police and
 military forces in the region have been unable to
 prevent ELN sabotage and terrorist activities. With
 the financial windfall from its kidnaping and
 extortion operations, the ELN is now able to upgrade
 its military capabilities and improve its previously
 neglected propaganda operations. The expanded
 military strength and increased local support that will
 probably result from these improved capabilities will,
 in our view, make ELN activities, both in Arauca and
 throughout the country, even more difficult for the
 Colombian Government to counter. Its improved
 capabilities, combined with the recent growth in its
 membership, indicate that the ELN will probably
 become a greater threat to domestic order and may
 well undermine government attempts to attract new
 foreign investment.

 India: Sikh Extremists
 on the Defensive
 Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's response to the
 Sikh militants has shifted from ahands-off to a get-
 tough strategy. New Delhi drove Sikh extremists out
 of the Golden Temple in Amritsar with its April 1986
 raid and continues counterterrorist operations in
 Punjab to weaken the underground movement. Since
 the June 1984 Army assault on the temple that killed
 Sant Jarnail Bhindranwale, the charismatic Sikh
 militant leader, the extremists have tried with little
 success to overcome the personal rivalries among their
 leaders, differences over tactics, and conflicting
 priorities that have characterized the movement.
 congregation, and began dismantling the "impure"
 repairs to the temple made by Army personnel
 following the assault in June 1984.
 Hindu passengers
 The militants, however, still pose a significant
 terrorist threat. Deprived of the high-visibility haven
 offered by the Golden Temple in the past, they
 resorted to their most spectacular terrorist attacks.
 Sikh militants assassinated Prime Minister Indira
 Gandhi following their 1984 ouster from the temple.
 They also placed transistor radio bombs in crowded
 urban locations to attract public attention to their
 separatist cause and to weaken the legitimacy of Sikh
 moderates and the authorities in New Delhi.
 Following their forced exit from the temple in early
 1986, the extremists staged a machinegun attack in a
 crowded market in May and a bus hijacking in July
 that ended with the roadside murders of all of its
 Militant Tactics and Targets
 Sikh militants during 1986 targeted Sikh moderates,
 Hindus, and, more recently, security forces. In
 January the All India Sikh Student Foundation
 (AISSF) and Damdami Taksal followers successfully
 challenged the Sikh religious moderates. Leaders of
 both groups put aside their differences long enough to
 seize control of the Golden Temple from the Sikh
 clerical hierarchy nominally aligned with Punjab
 Chief Minister Barnala and the moderate United
 Akali Dal (UAD) party. The militants claimed the
 titles and authority held by the moderate Sikh temple
 management committee, called a meeting of the Sikh
 With the Golden Temple once again their base of
 operations, all three factions tried to strengthen their
 political influence among the Sikh populace. The
 militants held press briefings and used loudspeakers to
 publicize their political message. The AISSF
 leadership regularly accused Barnala and other
 moderate Sikhs of selling out Sikh interests to Hindu
 sympathizers in New Delhi. The AISSF and the
 Damdami Taksal also organized voluntary labor to   25X1
 tear down and reconstruct the inner sanctum of the
 temple. They excluded Hindus, who traditionally
 participated in such voluntary labor projects. The
 UAD organized a march and demonstration that
 forced the adjournment of the state assembly.
 The arrest of Mokam Singh, leader of the Damdami
 Taksal, in March precipitated intense jockeying for
 dominance of the militant movement,
 that destroyed the fragile alliance
 among the radical factions. While conservative cleric
 Baba Thakar Singh took over nominal leadership of
 the Taksal, the AISSF and the UAD competed for
 Mokam Singh's followers. A month later the AISSF
 split into contending factions headed by Kahlon and
 Manjit Singh. The squabbling probably contributed
 to a temporary lull in violence in Punjab in late
 March.
 In a dramatic move to assert their leadership and
 topple the moderate Sikh state government, five
 AISSF leaders-including Kahlon-declared
 independence for Khalistan from the temple precincts
 in late April. The move backfired, however, when
 New Delhi orchestrated a sweep of the Golden
 Temple by security forces. The five militant leaders
 escaped, but security forces detained at least 300
 militants, according to press accounts. Barnala's

 Sikh militants are divided into three major factions:
 the religious fundamentalists (Damdami Taksal), the
 "student" activists (All India Sikh Student
 Federation-AISSF), and a catchall splinter group
 (United Akali Dal). Some members of the Damdami
 Taksal and AISSF probably make up the small cells
 that carry out terrorist operations.
 Damdami Taksal. Sikh militant juundamentalists
 have taken the namefor their groupfrom a centuries-
 old Sikh religious seminary, the Damdami Taksal,
 which Bhindranwale attended. Members are
 outspoken in their beliel'that Sikhism must be
 protected against absorption by Hinduism and
 cleansed 4f secular i~tfluences represented by New
 Delhi. Mohkam Singh controlled the Taksal until his
 arrest in March 1986. An older, more conservative
 cleric, Baba Thakar Singh, has since taken over and
 is attempting to mediate between the student
 hardliners and the juundamentalists.
 AISSF. Police arrested the leader of the powerful
 AISSF, Harinder Singh Kahlon, in July 1986.
 Kahlon had turned the AISSF into the most active
 extremist group in Punjab since Bhindranwale's
 death. The AISSF espouses violence to undermine
 the authority of the central and state governments
 that oppose the establishment of a separate Sikh
 state named Khalistan. Kahlon helped lead the
 militant takeover 4f the Golden Temple in January
 decision to take credit for the security operation at the
 temple weakened his political strength in Punjab.
 Some Akali Dal members in the state assembly
 withdrew their support for Barnala, but with Congress
 party support Barnala retains control of the state
 government.
 Since the militants lost their platform in the temple
 and were forced underground, they have resorted to
 terrorist attacks to press their cause. Two incidents in
 which Sikh extremists murdered Hindus-an attack
 in a crowded market in Amritsar in which 11 people
 died and a bus hijacking in which 14 passengers were
 1986, pushed the Khalistan declaration 4f
 independence in April that prompted New Delhi and
 the moderate Sikh government in Punjab to order
 another security sweep of the temple, and supported a
 .five-member Panthic Committee (Committee of the
 Faith) to lend religious legitimacy to the Khalistan
 declaration.
 Manjit Singh formed a separate AISSFjaction in
 mid-April 1986, accusing Kahlon of usurping his
 authority. The two AISSFlactions spent much of the
 time they held the Golden Temple bickering with
 each other, according to Indian press accounts.
 Manjit Singh created his own religious legitimizing
 group, the Panthic Presidium, to counter the
 authority claimed by Kahlon's committee and the
 moderate Sikh temple management committee.
 UAD. Led by Baba Joginder Singh, octogenarian
 .father of Bhindranwale this catchall faction prefers
 nonviolent political demonstrations to advance Sikh
 militant grievances against New Delhi and moderate
 Sikhs. The UAD led an unsucces.~ful boycott 4f state
 and national elections in September 1985. Despite the
 UAD's lack of success, Joginder Singh has support
 .from some militant followers loyal to his son and
 from rural Sikhs who never were comfortable with
 either the "student" extremists or the educated Sikh
 moderates who occupy government jobs in the state
 and national capitals.
 killed-have touched off Hindu departures from
 Punjab and raised communal tensions across the
 country. Following the bus hijacking, Hindu-Sikh
 clashes broke out in New Delhi. In contrast to the
 violence after Indira Gandhi's assassination that cost
 over 2,000 Sikh lives, the recent clashes resulted in
 only four deaths, as curfews and Army and security
 force patrols were ordered in at the first sign of
 trouble. Sikh militants have also continued their
 attacks on Hindu chauvinist and Communist
 politicians who protested Sikh violence and have
 clashed more frequently with Punjab police and
 Border Security Force personnel conducting
 counterterrorist operations.

 Secret
 New DeWi Uses Sikh Moderates as Fig Leaf
 New Delhi essentially watched events from the
 sidelines following Gandhi's signing of the Punjab
 Accords and state elections in 1985, perhaps hoping
 the newly elected Sikh moderates would isolate and
 weaken the militants on their own.
 The militants' retaking of the Golden Temple and
 New Delhi's failure to arrange the transfer of
 Chandigarh-the capital territory shared between
 Punjab and the mostly Hindu neighboring state of
 Haryana-in late January 1986 marked the end of
 Gandhi's hands-off policy. New Delhi probably
 calculated that it could no longer stand by while
 Barnala lost the struggle with the extremists. To avoid
 becoming the direct target of the Sikh militants,
 however, Gandhi orchestrated New Delhi's response
 to the militants through the security and political
 apparatus of the state government in Punjab. ~~
 On the security front, New Delhi has worked through
 state officials:
 ? Barnala named Julius Rebeiro chief of the
 beleaguered and corrupt Punjab police force.
 Rebeiro has integrated state police and security
 forces controlled by New Delhi for some
 counterterrorist operations.
 ? According to Indian press accounts, Rebeiro's
 operations have eliminated 10 of 38 top-ranking
 Sikh terrorists and captured more than 100
 extremists, including 12 "hardcore" members.
 ? New Delhi publicly put its resources at the disposal
 of Barnala's state government.
 ? Barnala ordered the paramilitary incursion into the
 Golden Temple in April this year.
 ? Barnala has called on New Delhi to tighten security
 along the Indian-Pakistani border to prevent alleged
 smuggling and cross-border movement by Sikh
 militants.
 On the political side, Gandhi has taken some steps to
 counter the appeal of the Sikh extremists:
 ? He ordered his bureaucrats to settle promptly all
 outstanding compensation claims from Sikh victims
 of the riots after his mother's assassination.
 ? He convened the dormant National Integration
 Council in New Delhi that issued public statements
 in support of the Barnala government.
 ? He named a Sikh, Buta Singh, to head the Home
 Ministry and added a second Sikh to his Cabinet as
 Agriculture Minister
 Sikh Militant Prospects
 Sikh militants are once again operating underground
 without established leadership-the leaders of the
 Damdami Taksal and the AISSF have both been
 arrested. We expect the competition to take over these
 organizations to be intense. The Indian press
 speculates that Akali Dal dissidents may attempt to
 forge a coalition with their contacts in the Taksal and
 AISSF. Another press report suggests that Kahlon,
 the jailed AISSF leader, may soon be moved from
 Punjab to a jail closer to New Delhi to facilitate
 discussions between the militants and the central   25X1
 government. ~~                                      25X1
 Sikh extremists will necessarily attempt to provoke
 Hindus and New Delhi into retaliatory acts that
 offend the sensibilities of estranged Sikhs in India. It
 is this cycle of retaliation that offers the most promise
 for rallying Sikh support for the extremists and for
 creating through migration a de facto Sikh state in
 Punjab. The militants probably can expect to receive
 additional support toward these ends from Sikhs
 outside India.
 New Delhi probably can further weaken the Sikh
 extremist movement by continuing counterterrorist
 operations:
 ? The central government's chances of continued
 success depend heavily on Police Chief Rebeiro's
 ability to strengthen and integrate state and on local
 police to improve intelligence collection, speed of
 response, and morale. The Indian press reports that
 Rebeiro will have a difficult time restoring public
 confidence in the Punjab police-a force the press
 claims is riddled with militant Sikh sympathizers.
 ? Rebeiro has cautioned that additional training,
 weapons, and confidence-building measures will be
 necessary to change the police and paramilitary
 forces into an effective counterterrorist force-a
 process he says could take years.

 Secret
 ? We believe Rebeiro faces a high risk of
 assassination that probably would unravel the gains
 in the morale and effectiveness of security forces.
 ? New Delhi, in coming weeks, is likely to establish a
 5-kilometer-wide strip along the Indian-Pakistani
 border through Punjab to curtail alleged infiltration
 of Pakistani-trained Sikhs and arms from Pakistan.
 Army troops, rather than paramilitary forces under
 Rebeiro's command, probably would be responsible
 for security in key districts.
 New Delhi cannot expect, however, to eliminate Sikh
 militancy until it addresses longstanding Sikh
 grievances:
 ? Gandhi's moves this spring and summer to enlist
 national political support for the moderate Sikh
 Barnala government in Punjab suggest he still hopes
 to enact commission recommendations on territorial
 transfers and water sharing between Punjab and
 neighboring Haryana.
 ? New Delhi probably will continue to prop up a Sikh
 government in Punjab at least through 1986-
 calculating that a buffer is needed to prevent
 recurrence of the direct confrontations between the
 militants and the central government that tend to
 win the extremists' popular support in Punjab.
 ? Gandhi has said publicly he is willing to talk with
 any Sikh group that renounces violence and
 Khalistan-opening the door for discussions with a
 host of dissident religious and political factions. In
 our view, Gandhi's flexibility is designed to appeal
 to Sikh moderates and to guard against Sikh
 militant efforts to discredit Barnala by equating him
 with New Delhi.

 An Overview of International
 Terrorism, January-June 1986
 International terrorist attacks are on the rise, and the
 United States continues to be a favorite target.
 During the first six months of 1986, nearly 450
 international terrorist incidents occurred worldwide-
 a 25-percent increase over the comparable period last
 year.' Of these, some 125 attacks~r one-fourth of
 the total-were directed against US interests:
 ? As in recent years, international terrorism continues
 to be a problem of the Middle East. More than half
 of all international terrorist incidents recorded for
 the first six months of 1986 occurred in the Middle
 East.
 ? About 20 percent of the international terrorist
 attacks for the six-month period occurred in
 Western Europe, down slightly from the 1985 total.
 Despite some government counterterrorist successes,
 indigenous terrorist organizations-among them
 West Germany's Red Army Faction (RAF) and
 France's Action Directe (AD)--continued to stage
 attacks. In early July the RAF claimed
 responsibility for the assassination of Siemens
 executive Karl-Heinz Beckurts near his home in a
 Munich suburb. That same month, AD carried out
 four attacks against French interests, including an
 attack against a police headquarters that left one
 dead and some 20 persons injured.
 ? During the six-month period, Latin America
 accounted for 15 percent of international terrorism,
 although international terrorism continues to be a
 small subset of all political violence in the region.
 Peru, Chile, and Colombia were the venue for most
 such terrorism.
 ? In the first six months of 1986, there were about as
 many international terrorist incidents in Asia as
 there were for all of 1985. Among the more
 significant events were the series of homemade
 rockets fired at the State Guest House in Tokyo by
 the leftist Japanese group Chukaku-ha (Nucleus
 Faction), as heads of government were arriving for
 the Economic Summit in early May. Although the
 rockets missed their target, and caused only
 minimal damage, the incident caused great
 embarrassment to the Nakasone government.
 In the first half of 1986, Libya, Syria, and Iran
 continued to be active in supporting terrorism. Tripoli
 and Damascus were involved in dramatic incidents
 that were departures from their previous patterns of
 terrorist-related activity. Libya sponsored attacks in
 April against US diplomatic personnel in Khartoum,
 Sudan, and Sanaa, Yemen Arab Republic; and Syria
 almost certainly was behind the attempted bombing
 of an El Al jetliner in London in mid-April. Iran,
 following a period of inactivity on the terrorist front,
 is suspected of involvement in a series of bombing
 attacks against Kuwaiti oil facilities on 17 June.
 The United States was a frequent target of
 international terrorism in the first half of the year. In
 the first six months of 1986, 10 Americans died at the
 hands of international terrorists, and some 80 were
 wounded:
 ? Forty percent of all international terrorist attacks
 against US persons and property for the half year
 occurred in Latin America, particularly in Peru,
 Chile, and Colombia. In Peru, the Maoist insurgent
 movement Sendero Luminoso increasingly has
 attacked urban targets, and the United States has
 borne the brunt of much of its activity directed
 against foreigners. Chile and Colombia, as in 1985,
 have continued to be principal venues for anti-US
 terrorism. Twice as many anti-US incidents
 occurred in Latin America during the month of
 April as occurred in any other region in any other
 month during the period.

 ? Leftist groups in West Germany accounted for some
 10 incidents-or one-fourth-of all anti-US
 violence in Western Europe for the first half of
 1986. Most of these were low-level attacks directed
 against military installations.
 ? Some 15 international terrorist incidents were
 directed against US interests in the Middle East
 during the first half of 1986. This level is roughly
 the same as the total number of anti-US incidents in
 the region for all of 1985. So far this year, most of
 the anti-US violence has occurred in Lebanon.
 The highest level of international terrorist activity in
 the first half of 1986-well over 100 incidents-took
 place in April. Some of these attacks probably were a
 response to US naval operations in the Gulf of Sidra
 in late March and subsequent airstrikes on Tripoli
 and Banghazi in mid-April. Past experience
 demonstrates that a dramatic upsurge in international
 terrorist incidents usually occurs in the immediate
 aftermath of significant political or military events. In
 the wake of the Israeli incursion into Lebanon in June
 1982, for example, a rash of international terrorist
 incidents occurred worldwide, with many claimants
 linking their actions to solidarity with the Arab
 victims.
 Terrorist operations continue to become more
 indiscriminate in nature, reflecting apparent
 disregard for the fate of bystanders and others not
 specifically targeted. In the early-April bombing of
 the La Belle discotheque in West Berlin, for example,
 two people died, and more than 200 persons of various
 nationalities were wounded (another died from his
 injuries two months later). The total number of
 casualties for the first half of 1986-more than
 1,250-increased by nearly 30 percent for the
 comparable period in 1985. The number of fatalities
 dropped substantially-by more than one-third-
 while the number of persons wounded increased by
 well over 100 percent. Forty-five percent of all
 casualties in 1986 occurred during April.
 During the first half of 1986, more than one-fifth of
 all international terrorist incidents were conducted
 against business targets. This reflects the growing
 trend in terrorist attacks against more vulnerable, less
 protected targets as security increases around
 diplomatic and military installations. The number of
 attacks against business interests worldwide exceeded
 the combined total of attacks against diplomatic and
 military targets for the period.
 Bombings remained the favored type of attack, used
 in nearly 60 percent of all incidents for the period.
 Counted among these were some 14 vehicle bombings,
 employed most frequently in the Middle East.

 Chronology of Significant Terrorist Incidents, January-July 1986
 Lebanon: In West Beirut five gunmen kidnaped the second secretary at the South
 Korean Embassy. His current status is unknown. The Organization of the
 Oppressed and two previously unknown groups-the "Fighting Revolutionary
 Cells," which provided a photograph of the diplomat, and the "Green Brigades,"
 which demanded ransom~laimed responsibility.
 France: In Paris a bomb exploded in a large shopping complex, injuring at least 26
 persons, including one American. The Committee for Solidarity with Arab and
 Near Eastern Political Prisoners, a covername used by the Lebanese Armed
 Revolutionary Faction, claimed responsibility.
 10 February     Italy: In Florence terrorists assassinated the former mayor of Florence, Lando
 Conti. The Red Brigades claimed responsibility.
 Italy: In Rome members of the Union of Communist Combatants shot and
 wounded residential economics adviser Antonio da Empoli. Da Empoli's
 bodyguard killed one of the four terrorists, and the Italian police reportedly
 arrested two others. The Union of Communist Combatants may be associated with
 .the Red Brigades.
 2 March         West Bank: The pro-Jordanian mayor of Nablus was assassinated outside City
 Hall by an unidentified gunman.
 West Bank: In Jerusalem an American tourist was shot by unidentified assailants.
 The man, probably mistaken for an Israeli, was slightly wounded. The anti-Arafat
 Palestinian group Abu Musa was most likely responsible.
 8 March         Lebanon: In West Beirut four members of a French television crew were kidnaped,
 possibly by a faction of Hizballah. Two of the captives were released on 20 June.
 Egypt: In Cairo the wife of an Israeli Embassy employee was killed and three
 other Israelis were wounded when terrorists ambushed their car while they were
 leaving the Cairo Trade Fair. The attack was claimed by a group calling itself
 Egypt's Revolution.
 Japan: In Tokyo three homemade incendiary rockets were fired into the grounds of
 the US Embassy, and two rockets were fired into the grounds of the Imperial
 Palace. None of the rockets did any damage or caused any casualties, although one
 rocket landed on the roof of the Embassy. The radical leftist Battle Flag Faction
 claimed responsibility. Other leftist groups conducted homemade rocket attacks in
 the following weeks in efforts to derail the Economic Summit.

 Bolivia: In La Paz a previously unknown group calling itself "Los Commandos del
 Pueblo" claimed responsibility for a dynamite explosion at the US Embassy. The
 incident caused minor damage and no casualties. In a communique sent to a local
 radio station, the group said it acted in retaliation for US aggression against
 Libya, Nicaragua, and other Third World countries.
 Lebanon: In West Beirut two British citizens were kidnaped. Their bodies, along
 with that of American hostage Peter Kilburn, were discovered on 17 April. The
 note accompanying the bodies said they had been executed in retaliation for the
 US raid on Libya. Kilburn was kidnaped in West Beirut in November 1984.
 29 March               West Germany: In West Berlin the German-Arab Friendship Union was bombed.
 Three Palestinians were implicated in the attack.
 18 April
 Greece: A bomb exploded aboard TWA Flight 840 as it approached Athens,
 killing four Americans and injuring nine other persons. Although it was damaged
 severely, the plane was able to make an emergency landing in Athens. A previously
 unknown group, the "Arab Revolutionary Cells," claimed responsibility for the
 incident in a communique issued from Beirut. The major suspect in the case
 remains a Lebanese woman with ties to the Syrian-backed Syrian Social
 Nationalist Party.
 West Germany: A bomb explosion inside a popular West Berlin nightclub, the La
 Belle discotheque, killed two persons-including one US serviceman-and injured
 more than 200, including 60 Americans. Another US soldier died two months
 later. A Palestinian was arrested in connection with the bombing. Libya is believed
 to have sponsored the attack.
 Thailand: A bomb exploded at Bangkok's Erawan Hotel, killing one person and
 wounding two others. US Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger was scheduled
 to attend a dinner there later that evening. No group claimed responsibility.
 Sudan: Unidentified assailants shot and seriously wounded a US Embassy
 employee in Khartoum. Black September claimed responsibility. Libya is believed
 to have sponsored the attack.
 United Kingdom: London police arrested an Irish woman at Heathrow Airport as
 she attempted to board an El Al flight with a suitcase bomb. Her Palestinian
 boyfriend, who planted the explosives, was arrested two days later. In his
 confession, he stated that Syrian officials were extensively involved in assisting
 him.
 Greece: In Athens gunmen killed Dimitros Angelopoulos, director of Greece's

 Turkey: Turkish authorities thwarted a plot by Libyans to stage a grenade attack
 against the US Officers' Club in Ankara. According to the Turkish indictment of
 five Libyans implicated in the attempt, about 100 persons were attending a
 wedding party at the time the attack was scheduled to occur.
 Lebanon: The Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Muslims-a covername
 used by Abu Nidal~laimed that it had executed British UN employee Alec
 Collett, who was abducted in Khaldah in March 1985. In a communique, the
 group asserted that it had murdered Collett in retaliation for British support of the
 US raid on Libya.
 Yemen Arab Republic: In Sanaa an unidentified assailant shot and wounded a US
 Embassy communications officer near his residence. Libya is believed to have
 sponsored the attack.
 Sri Lanka: Tamil separatists bombed an Air Lanka passenger jet preparing to take
 off from Colombo for the Maldives. The blast blew the tail off the jet and killed 16

 Japan: In Tokyo the leftist radical group Chukaku-ha (Nucleus Faction) fired five
 homemade rockets at the State Guest House, where heads of government were
 arriving for the Economic Summit. The rockets, which missed their target, caused
 no injuries and only minimal damage.
 Indonesia: In Jakarta two mortar projectiles were fired at the US and Japanese
 Embassies, but both failed to explode. An hour later, a car bomb exploded in the
 parking lot of an office building housing the Canadian Embassy and destroyed at
 least six cars. The previously unknown "Anti-Imperialist International Brigade"
 claimed responsibility for the attacks, stating that they were conducted in
 retaliation for the antiterrorism declarations of the Tokyo Economic Summit
 earlier that month. Jakarta police found the fingerprints of a member of the
 Japanese Red Army at one of the launchsites.
 Kuwait: A bomb exploded at an oil well near Kuwait City, and two blasts occurred
 at manifolds near Kuwait's oil tank farms, causing considerable damage. Iran is
 believed to have sponsored the attack.
 Peru: A bomb exploded aboard a tourist train that travels from Cuzco to Machu
 Picchu, killing eight persons, including one American, and wounding 36 others,
 including eight Americans. An American teenager died of her injuries several days
 later.
 Spain: A suitcase bomb exploded at the El Al counter at Madrid airport during an
 inspection. Thirteen persons were injured, three seriously. The arrested terrorist
 said he was a member of Abu Musa, an anti-Arafat Palestinian group.

 France: LARF Lashes Out
 The Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Faction (LARF)
 reemerged in September from six months of self-
 imposed restraint by attacking French targets in a
 new wave of bombings designed to force the French
 Government to release LARF's imprisoned leader,
 George Abdallah. But the plan seems to have
 backfired. In August most observers believed Prime
 Minister Chirac would release Abdallah this fall. The
 bombings, however, caused a hardening in French
 public opinion against terrorists. The French
 Government decided not to release Abdallah but to
 try him in February 1987. Paris probably contacted
 other LARF members, through intermediaries, in
 order to end the violence.
 Although the group is quiet now, it probably retains
 some capability to resume bombings in France.
 LARF could begin attacks on US interests out of
 frustration at the US role in keeping Abdallah in jail.
 The group has also threatened to carry out attacks in
 Italy, which holds two other LARF members, but it
 lacks the capability to pressure both Paris and Rome
 at the same time; it is most likely to shift its focus to
 Italian targets if Abdallah is freed.
 LARF's Latest Attacks
 In an attempt to press Chirac into releasing Abdallah,
 LARF members set off a series of bombs in Paris in
 September reminiscent of the cluster of attacks
 carried out during the period December 1985-March
 1986. They were conducted against "soft" targets,
 designed to cause large numbers of civilian casualties
 and to exert maximum pressure on French
 authorities:
 ? On 4 September a bomb partially detonated aboard
 a subway train at the Gare de Lyon. There were no
 casualties, but the bomb could have caused as many
 as 200 deaths had it exploded as planned.
 ? On 8 September the post office in the Paris City
 Hall (the building housing an office of Prime
 Minister Chirac, who is also Mayor of Paris) was
 bombed. One woman was killed and at least 18
 other persons were injured.
 ? On 12 September a bomb went off near a
 department store cafeteria in the La Defense
 shopping complex, wounding 42 persons.
 ? On 14 September a waiter discovered a bomb in the
 crowded Pub Renault on the Champs Elysees. It
 exploded as he and two policemen were carrying it
 to a parking garage, killing one of the policemen
 and wounding the waiter and the second policeman.
 The second policeman later died of his wounds.
 ? On 15 September Paris Police Prefecture
 Headquarters on the Ile de la Cite was bombed; one
 person was killed and 51 others were injured.
 ? On 17 September two men in a car deposited a
 bomb on the sidewalk in front of the Tati clothing
 store on the Rue de Rennes in the Montparnasse
 area, killing five persons and wounding as many as
 60 others.
 The Committee for Solidarity With Arab and Middle
 Eastern Political Prisoners (CSPPA}-a LARF
 covername~laimed responsibility for all these
 bombings and renewed its demand for the freein  of
 Abdallah and two other terrorists.

 Secret
 LARF is believed to have been responsible for a series
 of bombings in the winter of 1985:
 ? On 7 December bombs exploded in the Galeries
 LgJayette and Printemps department stores on
 Boulevard Haussmann, injuring 35 persons.
 ? On 3 February a bomb exploded in the Hotel
 Claridge shopping arcade on the Champs Elysees,
 injuring eight persons. On the same day, a bomb
 was jound on the Ei,~"el Tower and dej'used.
 ? On 4 February the Gibert-Jeune bookstore on
 Boulevard Saint Michel was bombed, wounding
 four persons.
 ? On S February the FNAC sports shop in the Forum
 des Halles was the target oj'a bombing,? nine
 persons were injured.
 ? On 17 March a bomb went o,/j'aboard the high
 speed train,from Paris to Lyon, injuring 10 persons.
 ? On 20 March the just deaths occurred when a
 bomb exploded in the Point Chaud shopping arcade
 on the Champs Elysees, leaving two dead and 28
 wounded. On the same day another bomb was
 ,found and dej'used aboard a subway train at the
 Chatelet station. This bomb and the EiJj'el Tower
 bomb were similar in construction to the 4
 September Gare de Lyon device.
 France Strikes Back
 No bombings have occurred since 17 September.
 French police have intensified their counterterrorist
 efforts since then, but we doubt they have damaged
 LARF's capabilities to operate. Rather, publicity
 about LARF members has probably caused them to
 flee or go underground. Paris issued arrest warrants
 and posters on 15 September for two Abdallah
 brothers, Robert and Maurice, for the pub bombing
 the day before, but the two held a public news
 conference on 16 September in northern Lebanon.
 After the Tati bombing, the police put out similar
 warrants and posters for Emil Abdallah and Salim al-
 Khuri on the basis of eyewitness accounts that the
 former delivered the bomb and the latter drove the
 car. Emil also appeared in northern Lebanon the next
 day. When the police issued warrants and photos for
 nine LARF suspects, seven of them surfaced in
 Lebanon to declare their innocence. French police
 believe Abdallah clan members actually conducted
 the attacks, then fled to Lebanon, and they have
 produced airline schedules and eyewitnesses to
 support this contention.
 On 14 September, in the wake of the first three
 bombings in Paris, Prime Minister Chirac announced
 broad new measures to fight the current terrorist
 bombing campaign:
 ? Visas will henceforth be required for all visitors to
 France, except citizens of the European Community
 and Switzerland.
 ? Army troops will assist police and customs officials
 in border control.
 ? The government will strengthen cooperation with
 foreign governments in order to fight terrorism.
 ? French police and security services will improve
 cooperation among themselves and strengthen
 security in public places.
 ? The government will take steps to control the
 movement of known terrorists and immediately
 expel anyone suspected of assisting "extremists."~
 Thus far, the government is sticking to its tougher
 visa policy in the face of international objections,
 increased security measures in Paris are plainly
 visible, and 12 Lebanese suspects (two with ties to
 George Abdallah) have already been expelled.
 French police found two explosives caches in
 September, and this may have contributed to the lull
 in bomb attacks. On 17 September authorities
 announced the uncovering of a 40-kilogram cache of
 explosives of Swedish origin-grenades, detonators,
 and detonator wire. The explosives belonged to the
 Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)
 and were discovered following information obtained
 from one of 12 Lebanese arrested early in the
 investigation. All 12 were deported, although no

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/15 :CIA-RDP87T00685R000200390003-3
 connection to the bombings could be proved. We
 believe the bombers may have had PFLP help, but it
 is not clear whether their explosives came from this
 lot. On 20 September the police were led to another
 cache 145 kilometers east of Paris by an Iranian who
 was later arrested along with three other Iranians.
 This cache contained 15 kilograms of explosives, 200
 meters of fuse wire, and a firearm, but again no
 connection to the bombing campaign could be
 demonstrated.
 Paris: Public Outcry, Private Deal
 After the March 1986 bombings, French officials
 reportedly arranged a truce with LARF pending
 Abdallah's release, expected to occur in August. In
 July, however, Abdallah was convicted of weapons
 offenses in Lyon and sentenced to four years in prison.
 Under French law he could have been freed after
 serving half of his sentence (including pretrial
 confinement)-that is, in late October 1986 (not
 counting time off for good behavior). LARF
 apparently became impatient with the pace of French
 justice, which had been slowed somewhat by US
 Government pressure not to release Abdallah.
 Probably in hopes of prodding the government, LARF
 revived the CSPPA for a new round of bombing
 attacks.
 Until the September wave of bombings, it still
 appeared that Abdallah probably would be released in
 late October, after serving half of his four-year
 sentence. Most observers expected a judicial decision
 not to prosecute him in connection with the 1982
 murders of US and Israeli diplomats. Increasing
 public pressure not to give in to terrorists, especially
 after the outrage over the Tati bombing on
 17 September, made this an untenable option. On
 26 September, after two weeks of tough antiterrorist
 talk by Prime Minister Chirac and other officials, the
 Minister of Justice publicly stated that Abdallah
 would be tried for complicity in those murders,
 probably by February. A preliminary hearing is
 expected in November
 Attacks in Lebanon
 In August and September, four members of the
 French peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon were
 killed-by bomb, machinegun fire, and attacks by
 militia forces, primarily the pro-Iranian Hizballah-
 and 20 others were wounded. In addition, at least two
 French citizens were apparently kidnaped in Beirut
 (one subsequently escaped). On 18 September alone,
 the day after the single worst bombing in Paris, two

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/08/15 :CIA-RDP87T00685R000200390003-3
 members of the French contingent of the UN Interim
 Force in Lebanon were killed, and a French military
 attache was assassinated as he arrived at the
 Embassy. Coming on the heels of the bombings in
 Paris, it is possible that some of the anti-French
 violence in Beirut had been inspired by the campaign
 in France. There is no evidence, however, of any
 connection between the attacks in Paris and Lebanon.
 LARF's Next Moves
 LARF could renew its bombing campaign if Abdallah
 is not released after a trial, now scheduled for
 February 1987. LARF may once again conduct
 selective assassinations, but probably recognizes that
 such attacks represent higher risks than bombings. As
 long as the group wishes to achieve maximum
 publicity and exert maximum pressure on the French
 Government, indiscriminate bombings are likely to
 remain the weapon of choice.
 Implications
 Italy could be the next victim of a resurgent LARF. It
 has two leading members of the group serving long
 jail sentences. The CSPPA has already threatened to
 conduct attacks in Rome like those in Paris if these
 two-Josephine Abdu and Abdallah al-Mansuri-are
 not released. We could expect a shift in focus to Rome
 once George Abdallah is released. We have no
 evidence that LARF has sufficient resources to mount
 a sustained campaign in Italy in the near future, but it
 might attack Italian interests in the Middle East.
 Before the 1984 arrest of Abdallah in France and the
 1984 and 1985 arrests of Abdu and Al-Mansuri in
 Italy, LARF represented the most lethal threat to US
 officials in Western Europe-killing or wounding five
 in France and Italy in little more than two years.
 LARF, through the CSPPA, has publicly condemned
 the US pressure on France in the Abdallah case and
 threatened to bring its bombing campaign to the
 United States. We judge that LARF does not have
 the needed infrastructure to undertake such
 operations in the United States, but the group could
 resume attacking American officials or begin
 attacking places where Americans congregate, in
 Europe or the Middle East.
