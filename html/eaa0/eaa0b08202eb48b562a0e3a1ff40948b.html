 Far East
 VIETNAM
 Premier Ky is launching a massive effort to win the
 South Vietnamese presidential election set for 3 Sep-
 tember.  The recent lull in the ground fighting in
 South Vietnam was interrupted as the Communists of-
 fered stiff resistance to five major allied opera-
 tions in widely scattered areas.
 DISORDER CONTINUES IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 The regime still shows little disposition to use
 force to end the fighting among political factions,
 probably because militant elements in Peking remain
 determined to push the Cultural Revolution.
 CHINESE COMMUNISTS TEST THERMONUCLEAR WEAPON
 The detonation on 16 June was in the high yield range
 and demonstrated the continuing progress of the Chi-
 nese nuclear weapons development effort.

 .The local Communists' latest effort is a virulent

 NEW TENSIONS IN SINO-INDIAN RELATIONS
 Despite a rapid chain of incidents in Peking and New
 Delhi, neither government apparently wants to push
 matters to a break in relations.
 POSTELECTION TURBULENCE IN SOUTH KOREA
 Responding to public protests, the government is pun-
 ishing some of its supporters who were involved in
 flagrant irregularities during the parliamentary
 elections on 8 June.  The opposition party still de-

 USSR CONTINUES TO ENLARGE SPACE SUPPORT FLEET
 The seventh unit to join the fleet is equipped with
 elaborate instrumentation, which will considerably
 enhance Soviet capabilities to support advanced space
 operations.
 TITO MOVES TO REVIVE THIRD-FORCE MOVEMENT
 President Tito has quickly reaffirmed Belgrade's de-
 votion to the principle of nonalignment in inter-
 national affairs after he had gravely weakened the
 credibility of his stand by adhering to the 9 June
 Soviet bloc declaration in support of the Arabs.
 NATO FOREIGN MINISTERS' MEETING
 French obstructionism clouded discussion of the Mid-
 east crisis at the 13-14 June semiannual session of
 the NATO foreign ministers, which also dealt with
 such issues as the nonproliferation treaty, East-West
 detente, and the "technological gap."
 STUDENT UNREST IN WEST BERLIN
 Allied and German officials alike are worried over
 the challenge to public order accompanying the in-
 creasing tendency to violence among student icono-
 clasts.
 THE MIDDLE EAST SITUATION AND ITS RAMIFICATIONS
 As the Arab states, individually and collectively,
 and Israel as well display continuing uncertainty
 about how to unravel the mess created by their latest
 hostilities, their supporters, detractors, and would-
 be mediators practically everywhere else in the world
 are no more united about what to do.  The battle of
 words that succeeded the shooting war remains centered
 at the UN, having moved from the Security Council to
 the General Assembly.  There and elsewhere the Com-
 munist states' political moves to display support for
 the Arabs have accelerated.  The Soviet airlift to re-
 supply the Arab military forces seems to have ended,
 however.  In the war zones, the cease-fire, except for
 one reported incident without casualties, is holding.

 FAR EAST
 Although there are still no signs that the
 Communist "summer offensive" has been launched,
 heavy infiltration from the North is continuing
 and North Vietnamese forces may have completed
 preparation for major attacks against allied
 Special Forces camps in Kontum Province.  A
 drive against these positions probably would be
 aimed at diverting allied forces from more crit-
 ical areas in the strategic central highlands
 and from the northern provinces of I Corps.
 Premier Ky's maneuvers to advance his presi-
 dential candidacy are generating growing concern
 among his rivals that the election next September
 will be rigged.  Ky is manipulating the Saigon
 press to attract attention to his own actions
 and to censor Chief of State Thieu's statements.
 Ky is also replacing unsympathetic police offi-
 cials with his own supporters
 There is no evidence that the trend toward
 growing chaos and violence in China has been re-
 versed by the early June directive to the army to
 restore order.  Leading party journals continue to
 deplore the resort to-force by rival "revolutionary"
 groups but Maoist leaders appear determined to push
 the Cultural Revolution regardless of the political
 and social disorder it creates.  The achievement
 represented by China's thermonuclear test last
 week undoubtedly has strengthened the Maoists' con-
 fidence that they can maintain the assault against
 their political enemies without damaging vital areas
 of China's strategic power and prestige.
 Most of the steam has been drained from the
 Hong Kong Communists' campaign against British au-
 thorities. .The majority of the colony's workers
 have ignored recent strike calls and business ac-
 tivity has remained near normal.  The Communists
 are trying to maintain momentum through anti-British
 posters and by publicizing Peking's contribution of
 nearly $2 million to a Hon  Kon  Communist "struggle
 fund . "

 VIETNAM
 Fissures in the South Viet-
 namese political fabric are be-
 ginning to show as candidates
 for September's national elec-
 tions intensify their campaign
 efforts.  Mounting tensions are
 reflected in both the press and
 the Provisional National Assem-
 bly (formerly Constituent As-
 sembly).  According to the US
 Embassy, recent assembly voting
 has reflected the increasingly
 open and caustic rivalry between
 presidential aspirants Premier
 Ky and Chief of State Thieu,
 with a particular effect on the
 assembly's majority bloc which
 in the past has been generally
 responsive to Ky's direction.
 Uneasiness among the press was
 pointed up by a recent editorial
 citing a popular concern that
 "rigged elections in Korea" might
 be repeated in South Vietnam.
 The campaign for the presi-
 dency does not get under way
 officially until.3 August, but
 Ky has already prepared a mas-
 sive effort in his own behalf.
 His organizational preparations
 to date are unusually ambitious
 compared with the limited steps
 taken by the other candidates.
 Ky will benefit from his
 placement of sympathetic sup-
 porters in strategic corps and
 cabinet positions during his two
 years in office, and a premier
 has many other resources at his
 disposal.
 Ky's campaign efforts range
 from the posting of signs pro-
 claiming  his government as "the
 government of the poor" to frequent
 tri s to the  rovinces.
 He is still trying to
 crea e a coalition of diverse po-
 litical and religious groups into
 a political "front."  Moreover,
 Police Director Loan's security
 apparatus has started to swing
 into action in the provinces in
 support of Ky.
 Ky's minister of information
 has not only clamped down on Sai-
 gon's newspapers but has also re-
 portedly instructed his ministry
 to advance Ky's campaign.

 voter will cast a ballot for 60
 senators, Ky could conceivably
 carry such a majority.
 Military Developments
 Heavy fighting occurred in
 widely scattered sections of
 South Vietnam this week (map on
 next page).
 In the north, Communist units
 of company size or larger engaged
 US Marines in the coastal flat-
 lands of Quang Nam and Quang Tin
 provinces in several pitched bat-
 tles.  The Marines are sweeping
 this area to secure vital supply
 lines along the coast between
 the major Marine installations
 at Da Nang and Chu Lai.
 In southern Quang Ngai and
 northeastern Binh Dinh provinces,
 elements of the US 1st Air
 Cavalry Division engaged units
 of the NVA 3rd Division on 21-22
 June killing more than 130 enemy
 soldiers.  Six Americans were
 killed and 41 wounded in two ma-
 jor engagements.
 Farther south in Phu Yen
 Province, elements of the North
 Vietnamese Army (NVA) 95th Regi-
 ment have recently displayed in-
 creased aggressiveness.  On 16
 June a force estimated to be of
 battalion size attacked South
 Vietnamese Army (ARVN) troops
 providing security for Revolu-
 tionary Development teams near
 Tuy Hoa, the provincial capital.
 On th,e northern fringes of
 Communist War Zone "D" about
 45 miles north of Saigon, a Com-
 munist regiment offered stiff
 resistance to a battalion of the
 US 1st Infantry Division partici-
 pating in Operation BILLINGS on
 17 June.  Nearly 200 enemy sol-
 diers were killed in the battle,
 raising the cumulative Communist
 casualty toll to 353 since the op-
 eration began on 11 June.  US
 losses to date stand at 38 killed
 and 199 wounded.
 Early in the week a battalion
 subordinate to the 274th Regi-
 ment of the Viet Cong 5th Divi-
 sion attacked units of the US 11th
 Armored Cavalry Regiment taking
 part in the large US/ARVN search-
 and-destroy Operation AKRON.  The
 operation is aimed at clearing the
 5th Division and local guerrillas
 from their base areas in the Phuoc
 Tuy - Long Khanh - Bien Hoa tri-
 border area east of Saigon.
 In the southern portion of
 the delta province of Long An,
 two battalions of the US 9th In-
 fantry Division killed 250 Commu-
 nist soldiers in a battle on 19
 June.  US forces suffered casual-
 ties of 48 killed and 143 wounded
 in this operation, named CONCORDIA.
 NVA units in the central high-
 lands may have completed prepara-
 tions for launching a major offen-
 sive against allied positions and
 installations in Kontum Province.
 The newly reinforced NVA 24th Regi-
 ment together with another unidenti-
 fied Communist regiment apparently
 are now located northeast of the
 Dak To Special Forces camp.  In-
 creased pressure against "New Life"
 hamlets, outposts, and reconnais-
 sance patrols in this area has
 been evident since mid-May, and
 during the past week, several

 ARVN regimental headquarters
 have been subjected to heavy mor-
 tar fire.
 Infiltration Through Laos
 Infiltration of North Viet-
 namese military personnel and sup-
 plies into South Vietnam through
 Laos continues at a high level.
 Although truck traffic moving
 through the panhandle has slowed
 down with the advent of the rainy
 season (June-September), the Com-
 munists are trying to keep key
 sections of this road net open as
 long as possible--particularly
 the Mu Gia Pass and Route 922
 into the A Shau Valley of South
 Vietnam.  Recent captives have
 confirmed the infiltration of sev-
 eral large groups this spring
 which are currently being used as
 replacements for units in South
 Vietnam's I, II, and III Corps.
 One recently captured docu-
 ment indicates that the North
 Vietnamese hope to move some 200
 tons a month over Route 922 dur-
 ing the rainy season, a figure
 comparable to the amount ob-
 served during the dry season.
 Despite their unprecedented ef-
 forts, the Communists probably
 will be unable to move more than
 a small number of trucks through
 Laos during the hei ht of the
 rainy season.
 DISORDER CONTINUES IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 For many weeks warring po-
 litical factions have been en-
 gaging in violent clashes in
 many areas of China.  So far the
 regime shows little disposition
 to use force to end the fighting,
 probably because some militant
 elements in the leadership, in-
 cluding Mao Tse-tung and Defense
 Minister Lin Piao, are determined
 to push the Cultural Revolution
 vigorously, regardless of the
 disorder it creates.
 Peking periodically issues
 statements deploring the use of
 violence to settle political
 disputes, but continues to aid
 and encourage Red Guard groups
 which have been the chief in-
 stigators of violence.  An edi-
 torial in People's Daily on 18

 June took a tolerant view of re-

 are "nonantagonistic," meaning
 that the participants are con-

 assumed a pose of b ieb  ng above

 urging "conservatives" to return

 "revolutionaries" to use reasoned
 arguments, not force, in con-

 During the past week the most

 to have been Honan, Hupeh, and

 the conflict has spread from the
 provincial capital of Cheng-chou--
 the scene of almost daily fight-
 ing since April between Red Guards
 and local military authorities--
 to Lo-yang.  According to a Red
 Guard poster, a "conservative"
 army of 30,000 attacked a group
 of revolutionaries at Lo-yang on
 19 June, killing 12 and injuring
 54.  Although undoubtedly exag-
 gerated, the account probabl  has
 a basis in truth, since
 a resident
 of Lo-yang state  t at violent
 clashes occurred daily.
 The large industrial city of

 CHINESE COMMUNISTS TEST THERMONUCLEAR I~JEAPON
 Communist China's success-
 ful detonation of a high-yield
 thermonu-clear weapon on 16 June
 shows its continuing progress in
 nuclear weapons design.
 The sixth test was China's
 biggest so far, with a yield in
 the range of several megatons.
 Peking announced the test as the
 successful explosion of China's
 "first hydrogen bomb."  The third
 and fif th tests were probably
 development efforts leading to
 the sixth test.  The weapon was
 probably air--dropped by a medium
 bomber, most likely one of China's
 two TU-16 Badgers.
 At present China's capability
 to deliver nuclear weapons is
 probably limited to its small
 force of medium bombers--about
 a dozen TU-4s and the two TU-16s.
 Peking announced the fourth nu-
 clear test as missile delivered,
 however, indicating that China
 was developing the capability to
 mate fission warheads with mis-
 siles.  The Chinese are believed
 to have been developing an MRBM
 for several years but there is
 no evidence yet of deployment of
 an MRBM force.
 to use nuclear wea ons.          25X1'
 Peking's press announcement
 of the test was almost identical
 in political content to the state-
 ment made after the last test.
 Both cite the success of the nu-
 clear program as the "rich fruit"
 of the Cultural Revolution and
 characterize the test as a "very
 great encouragement for Vietnam-
 ese people in their heroic war
 against US aggression.   Peking
 also stated that the test would
 give great encouragement to the
 Arabs in their resistance to "ag-
 gression by the US and British
 imperialists and their tool,
 Israel."  The Chinese repeated
 their standard assurance that
 China would never be the first

 CHINESE TRY TO KEEP UP ANTI-BRITISH CAMPAIGN
 The Chinese Communist appa-
 ratus in Hong Kong is having dif-
 ficulty in keeping up the momentum
 of its campaign against the Brit-
 ish.  In an attempt to counter
 the largely successful British
 efforts to maintain order and un-
 dercut Communist leadership in
 the labor unions, the Communists
 have launched a virulent anti-
 British poster campaign.  Most
 workers have ignored recent strike
 calls, however, and business ac-
 tivity has remained near normal.
 Peking is trying to keep the
 dispute alive with low-keyed
 propaganda depicting an oppressed
 Hong Kong population determined
 ultimately to end British control
 of the colony.
 IN HONG KONG
 The tone and content of re-
 cent Peking pronouncements sug-
 gest that China has no immediate
 intention of forcing a showdown
 over British rule in the colony.
 Peking, however, will almost cer-
 tainly continue to demonstrate
 its support for the Hong Kong
 Communists with propaganda pledges
 and financial support.  Other
 moves to harass the colony will
 probably be largely determined by
 the strategy the local Communists
 adopt after they have sorted out
 their own internal problems.
 NEW TENSIONS IN SINO-INDIAN RELATIONS
 A series of incidents in
 Peking and New Delhi during the
 past two weeks has raised Sino-
 Indian tensions to the highest
 point in nearly two years.  There
 are no indications that either
 side wishes to push matters to a
 break in relations, however, and
 both appear content to limit their
 activities to an exchange of
 abusive propaganda and harassment
 of diplomatic personnel.

 The trouble began on 13 June
 when the Chinese expelled two In-
 dian diplomats for alleged espio-
 nage activities eight days earlier.
 In rapid succession New Delhi re-
 taliated by expelling two Chinese
 diplomats, Red Guards beat the de-
 parting Indian officials, Indian
 demonstrators broke into the Chi-
 nese Embassy in New Delhi and at-
 tacked embassy personnel, and the

 under a virtual state of siege.
 On 20 June, however, no demon-
 strators appeared at the Indian
 Embassy for the first time in
 four days, and the Indians lifted
 restrictions they had placed on
 Chinese diplomats in New Delhi.
 Peking appears to have
 trumped up the initial spying
 charges as part of a broader cam-
 paign to dissuade foreigners
 from collecting information from
 wall posters and Red Guard pub-
 lications, and considered the
 Indians a safe target.  A Foreign
 Ministry statement on 15 June
 stated that the expulsion of the
 Indians "serves as a warning" to
 foreigners engaged in "illegal
 activities."
 In New Delhi, despite oppo-
 sition clamor in Parliament for
 a diplomatic break, the govern-
 ment-teems to be playing down
 some of the more provocative
 aspects of the incidents.  A de-
 tailed Indian news service ac-
 count of demonstrations at the
 Chinese Embassy was killed on
 government instructions and re-
 placed with a much blander re-
 port.
 POSTELECTION TURBULENCE IN SOOTH KOREA
 Public protests against ir-
 regularities in South Korea's Na-
 tional Assembly elections of
 8 June have led the government to
 punish the more blatant offenders.
 This seems to have taken the heat
 out of the opposition party's call
 for new elections.  Early closing
 of the colleges and universities
 has discouraged the continuation
 of student demonstrations.
 Following the outbreak of
 these widespread demonstrations,
 President Pak Chorig-hui on 16 June
 publicly admitted the irregulari-
 ties and promised retribution.
 Two successful candidates of Pak's
 Democratic Republican Party have
 been arrested.  The election of
 one of these has been voided, with
 his opponent declared the winner.
 The two men in custody and six
 other winners have been expelled
 from the DRP.
 The principal opposition,
 the New Democratic Party, has
 failed to obtain broad public
 support for its call for com-
 pletely new assembly elections.
 An NDP protest rally in Seoul on
 19 June drew only moderate sup-
 port.  The press, although criti-
 cal of the government's conduct
 of the elections, has character-
 ized the NDP's demands as unreal-
 istic and self-seeking.  The NDP
 itself is divided on this issue,
 with moderates unhappy over the
 present line because they realize
 the party lacks the money to con-
 duct another nationwide campaign.
 Hard liners are in control, how-
 ever, and the political tension
 is likely to drag on as they con-
 tinue efforts to develop a strong
 anti overnment movement.

 EUROPE
 Moscow's diplomatic campaign in support
 of the Arabs overshadowed other European develop-
 ments of some consequence during the week.  The
 Russians made clear that their immediate object
 is to ensure that Israeli forces withdraw to the
 territorial borders that existed as of 5 June.
 More generally, they are bent on preventing de-
 terioration in their position in the Middle East.
 How much they are prepared to invest in this al-
 ready expensive enterprise is not clear, and may
 not be fully clear in Moscow.
 The USSR's second Venus probe this month
 failed on 16 June.  The Soviets say the probe
 successfully launched on 12 June is still func-
 tioning properly, and will reach the planet in
 mid-October.  The Soviets may try to launch still
 another probe this month.
 The Soviet party plenum held this week for-
 mally elevated Yury Andropov, the recently chosen
 head of the security service (KGB), to candidate
 membership in the politburo.  The party probably
 expects that this move will enable it to exer-
 cise closer control over KGB activities.
 In East Germany, Premier Stoph announced
 that there will be a delay in his formal reply to
 West German Chancellor Kiesinger's letter of 13
 June on how relations should be conducted.  Pan-
 kow will probably continue to press for a summit
 meeting, but might accept negotiations at the min-
 isterial level on inter-German trade, transporta-
 tion, and communications matters.
 The Wilson - De Gaulle talks on 19-20 June
 centered on Britain's bid for EEC membership.  De
 Gaulle used the Middle East situation, however,
 to stress his charge that Britain consistently
 lines up with the US.  He maintained his posi-
 tion that Britain has grave problems to solve be-
 fore it can ho e to enter the EEC.

 USSR CONTINUES TO ENLARGE SPACE SUPPORT FLEET
 The Soviets are continuing
 to expand and modernize their
 world-wide fleet of instrumenta-
 tion ships which support space
 operations and extended-range
 missile firings.  The active
 fleet, which augments the USSR-
 based tracking network, now con-

 seven have been added since last

 to be the Genichevs
 The ship is
 similar in size an  instrumentation
 to the new US space and missile
 tracking ships, which also are mer-

 designed to support the Apollo
 manned space program.
 The Genichevsk is a sister
 ship of the Bezhitsa, which began
 its duties last February and is cur-
 rently operating in the South At-
 lantic.  Neither the Bezhitsa nor
 the Borovichi, another of the
 seven latest additions to this
 fleet, are outfitted with large
 radar antennas.
 TITO MOVES TO REVIVE THIRD-FORCE MOVEMENT
 Yugoslav President Tito has
 quickly reaffirmed Belgrade's
 devotion to the principle of non-

 after he had gravely weakened the
 credibility of this stand by ad-

 declaration in support of the
 Arabs.  Tito sent Foreign Minis-

 last week to repair fences with
 Mrs. Gandhi. Nikezic has since
 proceeded to the UN, where he
 and Premier Mika Spiljak are at-
 tempting to coordinate the views
 of the nonaligned states on the
 Middle East crisis.

 of nonalignment,  quickly  criti-

 Asian diplomat probably also re-
 flected the feelings of many
 other nonaligned leaders when he
 emphasized that Tito's move, al-
 though meant to help Nasir, ac-
 tually aligned Yugoslavia with
 the Soviet bloc.
 Belgrade's efforts at the
 UN are meeting with some suc-
 cess.  With Indian support, its
 delegation was the moving force
 behind the 17 June meeting of the
 representatives of 43 nonaligned
 nations.  The meeting selected
 Yugoslav representative Danilo
 Lekic to head a steering commit-
 tee to develop a common position
 on the mideast.  The Yugoslavs
 hope that the committee will rep-
 resent the nonaligned states in
 their relations with other groups
 at the UN.  The 17 June meeting
 also discussed a possible non-
 aligned foreign ministers meeting.
 Both Yugoslavia and India
 continue to maintain a firm pro-
 Arab line.  Both insist publicly
 that Israel must at least with-
 draw its forces to territorial
 boundaries that existed before
 4 June as the essential precondi-
 tion for negotiations with the
 Arabs.  However, Indian and Yugo-
 slav diplomats in New Delhi have
 hinted that nego-tiations might
 begin after a simple Israeli
 pledge to withdraw.
 Unlike the Indians, Tito has
 urged Nasir to make concessions.
 The Belgrade press has reaffirmed
 that Yugoslavia has always recog-
 nized Israel's right to exist
 as a state.
 Bel-
 grade also is recommending direct
 negotiations through the UN to
 settle other Arab-Israeli issues.
 The nonalignment theme, a
 cornerstone of Yugoslav foreign
 policy for many years, has been
 losing its appeal in recent month
 The frequent conflicts of inter-
 ests among the countries identi-
 fied with the movement have con-
 stantly undermined such unity as
 it possessed, and correspondingly
 its ability to influence events.
 Despite these weaknesses, how-
 ever, the idea has been useful to
 Tito over the years.  It has af-
 forded him considerable room for
 diplomatic maneuver and helped
 him maintain his independence
 with respect to Moscow.  In the
 process the doctrine has also
 given Yugoslavia--and Tito--a
 disproportionate international
 influence.

 NATO FOREIGN MINISTERS' MEETING
 Discussions of the Middle
 East crisis at the semiannual NATO
 foreign ministers' meeting on
 13 and 14 June underlined once
 more that France, in addition to
 withdrawing from the military side
 of the Alliance, places very nar-
 row limits on its participation
 in NATO political consultation.
 The ministers all held roughly
 similar views on the nature of the
 Mideast crisis and the UN's role
 in its solution. They were espe-
 cially critical of U Thant for re-
 moving the UN peacekeeping force.
 Preparation of a communique' sum-
 ming up the consensus of the meet-
 ing, however, encountered obdurate
 French objections.  The French
 even refused to agree to express
 hope for good relations with all
 countries of the Middle East, be-
 cause this would in some way imply
 their endorsement of the principle
 of consensus in NATO.- The impasse
 was resolved by accepting the
 French position and omitting any
 reference to Mideast consensus in
 the communique.  Ambassador Cleve-
 land commented that even Krag of
 Denmark and Martin of Canada, who
 have been the staunchest advocates
 of patience toward the French,
 were incensed by their behavior
 on this occasion.
 German Foreign Minister
 Brandt did not join the other min-
 isters in endorsing the tabling
 of a draft nonproliferation treaty
 (NPT) by the US and Soviet dele-
 gations at the current Eighteen
 Nation Disarmament Committee meet-
 ing.  Endorsement was contingent
 on the understanding that NATO
 members would be free to raise
 questions as discussion continues
 at Geneva, and that the US would
 continue to discuss the subject
 in the North Atlantic Council.
 Brandt later told US officials
 that Germany would go along with
 tabling the NPT draft so long as
 the other NATO members had agreed.
 Members previously opposed to cer-
 tain features of the NPT were so-
 bered by the consequences the use
 of nuclear weapons might have had
 in the Israeli-Arab dispute.
 Concerning East-West rela-
 tions, the Scandinavians, Canadi-
 ans, and British still viewed the
 prospects for a detente with the
 USSR more optimistically than the
 German, Dutch, Greek, and Turkish
 delegations.  Ambassador Cleve-
 land, however, noted a definite
 tendency by all to question Soviet
 motives.  Even the French endorsed
 the need to continue a strong West-
 ern defensive position as a means
 of encouraging the Soviets to ac-
 cept an eventual detente in Europe.
 On the question of the so-
 called "technological gap," the
 European ministers, rather than.
 engaging in their usual criticism
 of US economic "hegemony," em-
 phasized the question of what Eu-
 rope can do for itself.  They ap-
 proved a report from a special
 study group which recommended lim-
 iting NATO's role to fostering the
 spread of technical knowledge
 through joint military production
 and research and development proj-
 ects.  Other related projects are
 to be left to such groups as the
 Organization for Economic Cooper-
 ation and Development and the Eu-
 ro can Economic Community ~  25X1.

 STUDENT UPJREST IN 6~JEST BERLIN
 Deepening unrest this past
 year among West Berlin youth has
 aroused concern among Allied and
 German officials.  The unrest has
 been fomented largely by a small
 but vocal "new left" movement
 among university students which
 rejects all conventional values
 and seeks to destroy the "estab-
 lishments" of both East and Wes-t
 by defying their authority.  The
 US role in Vietnam is a favorite
 target of this element.
 Earlier this year student
 unrest was directed against the
 administration of the Free Uni-
 versity, but in recent weeks the
 city administration a~1d the po-
 lice have been the main targets.
 Events took a particularly serious
 turn on 2 June when a demonstra-
 tion against the visit of the Shah
 of I-ran turned into a riot.  In
 the ensuing clash with the police,
 a youthful demonstrator, Benno
 Ohnesorg, was killed.
 Ohnesorg's death produced an
 unprecedented feeling of solidar-
 ity between West Berlin students
 and professors.  City authorities
 are especially concerned that many
 thousands of students--rather than
 the usual 300-400 troublemakers--
 now have become involved.  The
 general public remains outraged
 by the rowdyism of the students,
 but the Berlin press has taken the
 authorities to task far their "in-
 ept" handling of the problem.  A
 parliamentary investigation of the
 events of 2 June is expected to
 uphold student charges that police
 were overzealous.
 US observers believe that
 the increasingly disorderly ac-
 tivities of the students have be-
 come a serious challenge to public
 authority.  The Allied Commandants
 concluded at a recent meeting that
 the situation required careful
 study and called for recommenda-
 tions.  The French representative
 asserted that Allied action was
 necessary because the students
 were establishing contact "with
 the East."  He may have been al-
 luding to the all-out East German
 propaganda exploitation of Ohne-
 sorg's death and funeral.
 All indications suggest, how-
 ever, that the East Germans acted
 independently, and there is no
 proof of significant Communist in-
 filtration of the West Berlin
 student movement.  The East Ger-
 mans occasionally send speakers
 to "new left" meetings in West
 Berlin and radical elements have
 smuggled in propaganda material
 from Peking's embassy in East Ber-
 lin.  Virtually all the students
 admit, however, that the "estab-
 lishment" in West Berlin allows
 them more freedom than their con-
 temporaries in the East enjoy, and
 they consider the East German re-
 gime the embodiment of all that
 they oppose.  The students have,
 thus  far,  refrained  from  attack-
 ing Allied authority in Berlin di-
 rectly and appear to accept the
 Allies as guarantors of the city's
 security.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The radical Arab states keep trying to make
 anti-Westernism into a real bandwagon movement,
 but the moderates, led by Jordan's King Husayn,
 have so far been able to treat the issue some-
 what more soberly.  Prospects for an Arab summit
 have become less and less certain.  The Israelis'
 main objective now is to get the Arabs to the
 conference table, but all the Arabs are opposed
 to any meeting until Israel withdraws from the
 Arab territories it occupies.
 Egypt, meanwhile, is carrying on a public
 campaign to whip up tension among the populace,
 and the government is claiming that victory over
 the Israelis is still a possibility.
 The security situation in Aden is worsening
 daily.  The Front for the Liberation of Occupied
 South Yemen, the principal terrorist organization
 operating against the British, has called for a
 UN investigation of Britain's "war of extermina-
 tion."  The British Government will be under strong
 pressure at home to pull out of the area before in-
 dependence in 1968 if the situation gets further
 out of hand.
 In India, the rapidly deteriorating security
 situation in West Bengal has brought the leftist
 coalition government in that state to the brink
 of collapse.  The sharp increase in lawlessness
 coincides with a precipitate decline in police
 morale and efficiency.  A period of direct rule
 from New Delhi seems almost inevitable in order to
 re-establish law and order.
 New strains are developing between the King
 and the military junta in Greece, as the regime
 consolidates its control.
 The most serious problem in Africa remains
 the break-up of Nigeria.  Governor Ojukwu of the
 "Republic of Biafra" has moved to acquire revenue
 from oil operations in the Eastern Region form-
 erly paid to the federal government.

 THE MIDDLE EAST SITUATION AND ITS RAMIFICATIONS
 Anti-Western pres-sure is
 still heavy throughout the Arab
 states, but the radicals--Egypt,
 Syria, Algeria--have been unable
 so far to make anti-Westernism
 into a bandwagon movement which
 would compel the moderates to
 follow their lead.  On the other
 hand, the moderates--led by Jor-
 dan's King Husayn--have been un-
 able to create any forum in which
 they could impress their point
 of view on the radicals.
 The Arab foreign ministers'
 meeting in Kuwait on 17 and 18
 June produced nothing but a
 communique stating that the Arab
 states "firmly stood by their
 previous decision to cut off the
 oil."  The foreign ministers then
 enplaned for the UN session in
 New York, talking of resuming
 their meeting there.  Prospects
 for an Arab summit have thus be-
 come even hazier.  This meeting,
 tentatively scheduled for 24 June,
 will probably not be held until
 early next month, if it takes
 place soon at all.
 One likely reason why an
 Arab summit has not gotten off
 the ground is that the Nasir re-
 gime has been busy in its own
 house.  The "retirement" of Mar-
 shal Amir, the putative architect
 of Egypt's military disaster, has
 evidently left the regime with a
 serious gap to fill.  A reorgani-
 zation announced on 18 and 19
 Page  18
 June gave President Nasir the
 premiership and made him secre-
 tary general of the regime's mass
 party, the Arab Socialist Union
 (ASU), as well.  The shift fol-
 lowed a week of rumor that Nasir
 was a prisoner of allied leftist
 and "realist" factions, and that
 a power struggle was going on in-
 side the regime.
 A clearly identifiable rep-
 resentative of the army has not
 emerged, but the substitution of
 Nasir for the pro-Soviet Ali Sabri
 as effective head of the ASU lends
 some substance to reports that
 Sabri as well as Amir has fallen
 from favor.  Sabri remains, how-
 ever, one of Nasir's top deputies
 and is minister for local affairs,
 The new cabinet as a whole has a
 pragmatic flavor with few new
 names.  Such reshufflings have
 occurred before in response to
 pressures for new emphases in
 Egyptian policy, without bringing
 any dramatic shift in the Nasir
 regime's attitudes toward the
 outside world.
 In Jordan, King Husayn's po-
 sition has remained surprisingly
 good.  It may be undermined, how-
 ever, unless the Jordanians prove
 capable of coping with the flow
 of refugees now moving steadily
 out of the camps in Israeli-oc-
 cupied West Jordan.  The Jorda-
 nians' arrangements at this point
 are makeshift at best.  The Libyan

 Government also has survived the
 storm of disorders which in ef-
 fect put the country in the hands
 of the police and military, but
 the price has been a formal re-
 quest that the US begin discus-
 sions on total withdrawal from
 Wheelus Air Base.  The Lebanese
 Government remains fearful that
 some new untoward development will
 set off a civil war between Mus-
 lims and Christians; tensions are
 reported to be extremely high.
 Even the Israelis are some-
 what distracted by domestic poli-
 tics.  The partial demobilization
 effected during the past ten days
 has brought a relaxation, and
 with it has come political maneu-
 vering involving the Rafi party
 of General Dayan, the left-
 socialist-oriented Achdut Haavoda,
 and Prime Minister Eshkol's Mapai.
 A Rafi  committee  voted  this  week
 to rejoin Mapai, which the leading
 lights of Rafi left twa years ago
 after ex-premier Ben Gurion had
 become dissatisfied with Eshkol's
 leadership.  Within Mapai, the
 move is being resisted by those
 who fear that Dayan-may be hoping
 to capitalize on his present popu-
 larity as a military leader to
 take over the civilian leadership
 as well.  The anti-Dayan group
 looks for a merger with Achdut
 Haavoda to balance Rafi influence.
 This kind of political in-
 fighting may well make the Israeli
 Government even less flexible on
 peace terms; no Israeli leader
 presumably wants to face an elec-
 torate as the man who gave away
 what Israel's soldiers won, even
 though it must be clear to the
 top Israeli leadership that the
 country cannot hope to hold its
 present territorial gains indefi-
 nitely.
 The Israelis continue to em-
 phasize, outside the UN forum as
 well as within it, that the main
 objective now is to get the Arabs
 to sit down with them, face to
 face, at the table.  The Arabs,
 however, are digging in their
 heels as har-d as they can; even
 moderate Arab leaders say cate-
 gorically that such talks are im-
 possible at present.  The Arabs
 are focusing almost completely on
 the issue of an Israeli withdrawal,
 and such voices of radicalism as
 Damascus radio have called on the
 Palestinians to organize them-
 selves for a "secret armed strug-
 gle."
 asir as we
 as other regime spokesmen have
 emphasized that Egypt is willing
 to wait indefinitely--keeping the
 Suez Canal closed the while--for
 the Israelis to evacuate Sinai.
 So far, however, there has been
 only one report of a cease-fire
 violation; the Israelis on 18 June
 accused the Syrians of shooting,
 but there were no casualties.
 The Canal and Oil Situations
 Oil production in the MiddlF
 East is recovering.   All Arab

 producing countries with the excep-
 tion of Iraq and Libya are produc-
 ing and shipping oil to regular
 consumers other than the US or UK.
 Iraq is
 permitting the Iraq Petroleum
 Company to pump enough oil to meet
 the internal requirements of both
 Syria and Lebanon, but there is
 no indication of when production
 and exports will be resumed.
 West European oil consumers
 still are not displaying any great
 uneasiness about the oil supply
 situation.  The-OECD Council which
 met on 20 June again failed to
 institute any emergency programs
 because France, and others, could
 not agree on the urgent need for
 joint action.  The problem now
 appears not to be the availability
 of Arab oil but one of transporta-
 tion.  The movement of Persian
 Gulf oil to markets west of Suez
 via the Cape of Good Hope will
 require additional tanker capacity
 that is not readily available.
 This lack of transport will affect
 the production and shipment of
 .Arab oil at least over the next
 thirty days.
 Nasir has stated that the
 Suez Canal will not be reopened
 until Israeli troops are withdrawn
 from its vicinity.  It now seems
 highly likely that the waterway
 is, as reported, blocked by a num-
 ber of sunken craft.  Estimates
 of the time required to clear the
 Page 21
 canal range from a number of days
 to six months, but the more re-
 liable estimates are one to three
 months.
 Closure of the canal has
 caused charter rates for tankers
 to increase by more than 300 per-
 cent, and some dry cargo rates
 by 100 percent.  The landed cost
 of a ton of Persian Gulf crude to
 Italy, for example, has risen from
 $14.50 to $28.50.
 Soviet Diplomatic Offensive
 The Soviet effort to display
 solid support for the Arab cause
 was accelerated during the past
 week.  Premier Kosygin at the UN,
 President Podgorny in Cairo, and
 the Soviet party central committee
 under Chairman Brezhnev in Moscow
 made a coordinated series of ges-
 tures to bolster the image of all-
 out Soviet backing.
 Kosygin's speech at the UN
 General Assembly on 19 June made
 it clear that the chief Soviet
 aim is to force Israel to hand
 back captured Arab territory. Al-
 though his resolution would con-
 demn Israel and .call upon it to
 make restitution to the Arabs,
 the Soviets would probably give
 up these demands in return for a
 simple withdrawal resolution to
 be implemented by the Security
 Council.  In line with established
 Soviet policy, Kosygin did not
 take a stand on direct Arab-Is-
 raeli talks or access to the Suez
 Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba.

 Kosygin struck out at
 US policies in several areas,
 leading off with Vietnam and
 rehashing old charges on Cuba,
 the Congo, and the Dominican Re-
 public.  His remarks throughout
 were relatively temperate, how-
 ever, and particularly so when
 speaking of the US role in the
 Middle East.  He charged the US
 with taking steps which the Is-
 raelis might have considered as
 encouraging their "aggression,"
 but he did not so much as hint at
 direct US intervention in the
 hostilities.  He made a general
 reference to the passibility of
 halting arms races and the de-
 sirability of concerted steps by
 the great powers toward peace,
 which may have been intended to
 keep the door open for private
 talks with the US.
 Podgorny arrived in Cairo on
 21 June for talks with Nasir. The
 two regimes probably need to com-
 pare notes on their intentions
 regarding new moves in the crisis.
 Podgorny's arrival was preceded
 by that of Soviet Chief of Staff
 Zakharov, and both will probably
 take part in an assessment of the
 damage done to the Egyptian mili-
 tary machine.  Podgorny may be
 empowered to bargain with Nasir
 over the extent to which the So-
 viets need to resupply the Egyp-
 tian armed forces.  There is no
 clear indication as yet of how
 far Moscow intends to go in this
 regard.  Podgorny may also work
 with Nasir in hammering out a
 more detailed and coordinated
 bargaining stance to be adopted
 at the UN, in the expectation
 that the Soviets' present harsh
 resolution will need to be modi-
 fied.
 In Moscow, a two-day central
 committee plenary session ended
 on Wednesday after going through
 the formality of endorsing the
 politburo's handling of the Middle
 East crisis.  The resolution
 adopted by the party body failed
 to mention one of Kosygin's three
 demands--censure of Israel--but
 it used harsher and more ideolog-
 ical language than had Kosygin at
 the UN.  The party document was
 unrelieved by the more positive
 aspects of Kosygin's Aresentation,
 notably his statement on the right
 of every people "to establish an
 independent national state of its
 own," and his reference to great-
 power responsibility for peace in
 the Middle East.
 The resolution took special
 note of the Communist summit con-
 ference in Moscow on 9 June, call-
 ing the "joint action" of the bloc
 countries a "powerful factor in
 the struggle against aggress-ive
 intrigues" but without specifying
 what "joint action" was planned.
 Podgorny's stop-over in Belgrade
 on the way to Cairo was probably
 designed to exploit Tito's willing-
 ness to join with the USSR and all
 the East European countries except
 Rumania on this issue.

 governments except Albania are
 represented at the special UN
 General Assembly session by pre-
 miers and foreign ministers, and
 even Albania sent its foreign min-
 ister.  Their views on the Mid-
 east conflict and reactions to the
 proceedings--aside from the Ru-
 manians--have predictably supported
 the Arab cause, but various dele-
 gates have revealed private doubts
 about the outcome of the session
 and about Soviet tactics and lead-
 ership in the crisis.
 As expected, the Rumanians
 have emphasized the neutralist
 course party leader Ceausescu set
 by refusing to sign the 9 June
 Moscow declaration condemning Is-
 raeli aggression or to break rela-
 tions with Tel Aviv.  One Rumanian
 representative even noted to US
 officials that the views expressed
 by President Johnson in his speech
 were "not very far" from those of
 his own country.
 Despite their close public
 alignment with the Soviet posi-
 tion, Czechoslovak and Hungarian
 delegates have complained pri-
 vately that the Soviets have not
 kept them informed regarding their
 intentions.  A Czechoslovak dele-
 gate even related that on 16 June
 Eastern European delegates "were
 forced to buttonhole" outsiders
 to learn Kosygin's expected time
 of arrival.
 Reflecting his government's
 misgivings, Polish Deputy Foreign
 Minister Naszkowski stated
 on 15 June that Warsaw
 the UN debate as a propaganda
 exercise through which Moscow
 hopes to demonstrate continued
 support for the Arabs and to re-
 gain the initiative in the Middle
 East.
 Meanwhile, in Warsaw, party
 boss Gomulka is trying to temper
 pro-Israeli sentiment in Poland,
 most recently in a speech deliv-
 ered on 19 June.  Gomulka's ef-
 forts in this direction reveal
 the regime's extreme sensitivity
 to the widespread sympathy for
 Israel among influential Jews
 within the party and government
 apparatus, as well as among the
 people in general.
 Soviet Military Aid
 The Soviet airlift to Egypt
 and Algeria appears to have ended.
 Between 6 and 19 June over 225
 flights were made to those coun-
 tries.  While the cargoes included
 spare parts and some antiaircraft
 guns, the flights are believed to
 have been intended primarily to
 resupply the Arabs with aircraft.
 The cargo to Egypt included pos-
 sibly as many as 100 MIG fighters.

 If the Soviets intend to
 build the Egyptian military hard-
 ware inventory up to the prehos-
 tility level and meet new Egyp-
 tian military equipment require-
 ments, a large-scale sealift of
 some duration will be necessary.
 Since the fighting began on 5
 June, however, only eight freight-
 ers possibly carrying military
 equipment have arrived in Middle
 Eastern ports--one in Algiers,
 five in Alexandria,-two in
 Latakia--and one freighter is
 currently en route to Iraq via
 the Cape of Good Hope.  Some of
 these ships carried armored person-
 nel carriers, artillery, and anti-
 aircraft guns, and aircraft as well
 as tanks and a variety of wheeled
 vehicles.  Egypt has been seeking
 the last two items on an emergency
 basis since 24 May.
 Soviet Naval Posture
 A significant number of So-
 viet combatant ships continue to
 operate in the Mediterranean.
 Units which have recently entered
 the Mediterranean or will do so
 in the next week include two
 Alligator-class landing ships, two
 cruisers, four destroyers, and
 five naval auxiliaries.  A cruiser
 and seven other warships are
 scheduled to return to the Black
 Sea in the same period.
 Four destroyers, an Alligator
 landing ship, and an intelligence
 collection ship continue to op-
 erate east of Cyprus and as many
 as eight submarines, including
 two nuclear units, may be in the
 Mediterranean.  The Soviets ap-
 pear to be maintaining a large
 number of naval units in the area
 as a psychological prop to the
 defeated Arab states and to in-
 terfere with the freedom of
 action of the US Sixth Fleet.
 UN Situation
 There does not appear to be
 much chance that either the US or
 Soviet resolutions on the Mideast--
 at least in their original form--
 will attract the necessary two-
 thirds vote in the special session
 of the United Nations General As-
 sembly.  Several groups of nations
 are considering introduction of
 their own resolutions as the de-
 bate goes on.
 Outside of the Communist and
 Arab states, there is almost no
 support for the clause of the
 Soviet resolution calling for the
 condemnation of Israel as the ag-
 gressor.  Nor is there much in-
 terest in the Soviet proposal
 that Israel be required to make
 reparations.  The Soviet resolu-
 tion might pass, however, if it
 were cut down simply to a call
 for the withdrawal of Israeli
 forces behind the armistice lines.
 There is a possibility that India
 and other nonaligned states will
 introduce such a resolution them-
 selves.

 Many countries tend to be-
 lieve that the UN must take a
 clear position against territorial
 gains as the result of military
 action, regardless of other con-
 siderations.  The Chilean repre-
 sentative said that this was an
 important matter to most Latin
 American countries.  Probably
 hoping to salvage something of
 Britain's economic relations with
 the Arab states, British Foreign
 Secretary Brown, when he addressed
 the assembly, opposed Israel's re-
 tention of conquered territory.
 The UK, however, is unlikely to
 press the Israelis to withdraw
 until they have gained some
 guarantees.
 The US Mission to the UN
 characterized the initial reaction
 to Ambassador Goldberg's speech
 as  good to excellent from all
 friendly countries, and good from
 many marginal ones."  Objections,
 however, were raised by some that
 it ties an Israeli withdrawal to
 the recognition of permanent
 boundaries.  There is deep pes-
 simism in the halls of the UN about
 the prospects for such recognition
 any time soon, or even for Arab-
 Israeli talks, as proposed by the
 US.
 The purpose of the debate in
 the General Assembly is generally
 recognized as being that of reg-
 istering the sense of world opinion
 on the Mideast situation, with no
 intention by any country to endow
 the assembly with new implementing
 powers.  There is, however, a
 growing belief that the UN needs
 new and improved machinery to
 deal with the Mideast--perhaps a
 special mediator appointed by
 the Secretary General, or strength-
 ened peace-keeping forces.  De
 Gaulle and Prime Minister Wilson
 still hope that a four-power
 summit meeting can be arranged.

 rJE6^J STRAINS BETWEEN GREEK COUP GROUP AND KING
 There are new signs of
 strains between King Constantine
 and the military regime in Greece.
 Constantine previously
 had approved almost pro forma the
 junta's suggested military re-
 tirements and promotions, which
 apparently have been carried out
 according to established proce-
 dures and without favoritism.
 The regime has continued to
 consolidate its control with the
 appointment of key local, re-
 gional, and national governmental
 officials.  Strict control of
 the news media is being main-
 tained, and political activity
 is still proscribed.  The mili-
 tary authorities have instituted
 severe penalties for both writ-
 ten and oral  pronouncements
 threatening their established
 order.
 Minister of Interior Pat-
 takos announced last week that
 over half of the 6,138 political
 prisoners had been released.  A
 press source quotes Pattakos as
 having said that over 10,000 per-
 sons had been arrested.  The most
 prominent detainee, Andreas Pa-
 pandreou, has still not been tried,
 but Pattakos announced that the
 government was "speeding up legal
 formalities" in this case.  Most
 observers believe that even if
 Andreas is convicted, he will not
 serve a sentence but will instead
 be deported.
 The constitutional revision
 committee met last week and was
 urged to complete its work by
 15 December.  No timetable for the
 promised referendum has yet been
 announced, however.
 Various regime officials have
 expressed surprise at what they
 regard as a cool US response to
 the new government.  They state
 that the US apparently misunder-
 stood the necessity for the mili-
 tary take-over and have hinted
 that the continuance of such a
 stance by the US could result in
 anti-US reprisals.

 The three-week-old "Republic

 Region of Nigeria--is still
 awaiting both a military attack

 international recognition.  Under

 Federal forces now deployed
 near the Biafran border are esti-
 mated at 4,000 men.  Ojukwu has
 some 2,000 regular troops in the
 area, many equipped with modern
 small arms.  They are in a good
 defensive posture.  Eastern sabo-
 teurs recently succeeded in blow-
 ing up a number of small bridges
 across the border despite the
 federal build-up there.
 Ojukwu, meanwhile, launched
 his move to get control of the
 increasingly sizable revenues
 heretofore paid to the federal
 government by the foreign oil
 companies.  With the next tax and
 royalty payments due next month,
 a decree issued by Ojukwu on 21
 June formally calls for the pay-
 ment to Biafra of all such revenues
 derived from operations there.
 Under threat of fine, all com-
 panies operating in Biafra are
 required to file by 28 June full
 particulars of the revenues in-
 volved and their source, although
 the timing of actual payment may
 still be negotiable.
 The oil companies, among
 which Shell-BP is by far the
 largest producer, will now have
 to choose between abiding by
 their existing contractual obli-
 gations to the federal government
 or dealing with Ojukwu's regime.
 Shell-BP's position is a diffi-
 cult one.  Payment to Biafra at
 this stage would be certain to
 provoke an extension of the pro-
 claimed federal blockade of the
 East to oil tankers, which now
 are allowed to proceed to Eastern
 ports after first being checked
 out at Lagos.  On the other hand,
 payment to Lagos may result in
 action by Ojukwu to shut down
 oil operations in Biafra in an
 effort to force the companies to
 come to terms with him.  At pres-
 ent Shell-BP seems likely to make
 its July payment to Lagos, thus
 at least preserving its consider-
 able interests elsewhere in Ni-
 geria.  Gowon is clearly most
 anxious that Ojukwu not get the
 oil revenues, which he feels
 would be an important step to-
 ward recognition.
 Both Gowon and Ojukwu have
 recently sent delegations to key
 African and world capitals to
 press their respective positions.
 Gowon has warned that recognition
 of Biafra would be regarded as an
 unfriendly act and has generally
 discouraged would-be mediators.
 Ojukwu and his emissaries are
 pushing the line that recognition
 should be granted immediately to
 forestall bloodshed.  So far,
 Gowon has had much the better of
 this diplomatic skirmish as no    `
 country is yet willing to be first
 to recognize Ojukwu's Biafra. Its
 only foreign neighbor, Cameroon,   '
 is cooperating with Lagos' efforts
 to seal off the seceded region.
 Many other African countries have
 now closed their air orts to
 O'ukwu's aircraft.               25X1

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 A variety of international meetings, with the
 UN discussions of the Middle East crisis foremost
 among them,. absorbed the attention of many Latin
 American governments last week.
 General preoccupation with the Arab-Israeli
 conflict and its repercussions in the UN General
 Assembly continues throughout the hemisphere.  As
 matters now stand, it seems likely that the-Latin
 American group in the UN would abstain in a vote on
 a resolution condemning Israeli aggression, whereas
 a significant number of hemisphere governments
 probably would see themselves forced to support a
 simple call for Israeli withdrawal from conquered
 territories.  Despite their basic sympathy with the
 Israelis, some Latin American regimes probably
 would feel that they could not politically afford
 to condone any territorial gains made by force.
 Other important international meetings during
 the week included the preliminary sessions of an
 OAS Meeting of Foreign Ministers in Washington to
 act on Venezuela's complaint of Cuban aggression,
 and the fifth annual meeting of the Inter-American
 Economic and Social Council. in Vina del Mar, Chile.
 After agreeing unanimously that Venezuela's com-
 plaint should be fully examined, the OAS had dif-
 ficulty in finding five governments willing to
 serve on the investigatory commission that was
 named on 21 June.  The main themes in Vina del Mar
 have been Latin America's persistent quest for US
 preferential treatment of its exports, and the
 strong differences of opinion that continue to
 crop up when trade questions and future Latin
 American economic integration are discussed.
 Domestically, most Western Hemisphere coun-
 tries remain quiet, although rumors of a cabinet
 shake-up and still vaguer rumblings of a general
 political upheaval continue to circulate in Bolivia.
 Also, rumors persist of coup plotting in Haiti, .as
 do reports that more executions of suspected con-
 spirators are about to occur or have just taken
 place.

 TROUBLED BOLIVIA FACES NEW PROBLEMS
 The Bolivian Government, en-
 gaged for three months in an un-
 successful effort to rout guer-
 rillas in the southeast, now is
 faced with additional problems
 of unrest in the tin mines and
 growing cooperation among opposi-
 tion political groups.
 The trouble in the tin mines
 stems primarily from economic and
 administrative grievances.  Agi-
 tators have exploited the situa-
 tion, inciting the miners to vio-
 lence and encouraging them to
 defy government authority.  Ex-
 tremists have maneuvered the miners
 into endorsing the guerrillas and
 demonstrating in support of them.
 Miners at the important Hua-
 nuni and Catavi complexes have
 declared their regions "free ter-
 ritory" in an apparent attempt to
 force the government to meet their
 demands and to lift the state of
 siege imposed on 8 June.  Techni-
 cal and administrative personnel
 fear for their safety under such
 conditions of anarchy and have
 refused to return to the mines.
 The government is reluctant to
 move troops into the area as this
 probably would only aggravate the
 situation.
 Durinq the past two weeks
 there has also been a flurry of
 political activity unknown in Bo-
 livia for some time.  Leaders of
 the Nationalist Revolutionary
 Movement (MNR), the rightist Bo-
 livian Socialist Falange (FSB),
 and the National Lef tilt Revolu-
 tionary Party (PRIN)?--Bolivia's
 major political parties--have held
 a series of meetings aimed at uni-
 fying opposition to the Barrientos
 government.  Some progress has
 been made, but unity is still an
 illusion at this point.
 In an apparent attempt to
 forestall such a development and
 to split the power-hungry FSB,
 President Barrientos offered that
 party a chance to participate in
 his government, using as bait the
 promise of one or two cabinet
 posts.  The plan eventually was
 vetoed by Barrientos' supporters,
 but it had the desired effect of
 disrupting the unity movement.
 The FSB is now in trouble with
 the MNR and PRIN for its duplicity
 in seeking favor with the govern-
 ment while at the same time nego-
 tiating with the opposition par-
 ties, but the unity of-forts con-
 tinue.
 The mine situation and the
 unity movement among the opposi-
 tion political parties are both
 troublesome for the government,
 but the guerrilla problem is still
 the main concern.  Additional
 guerrilla sites are being set up
 in different areas of the coun-
 tr ,
 If even one of these new
 groups starts shooting, the gov-
 ernment would be incapable of cop-
 ing with the problem.  The result-
 ing decline of public confidence
 would not only undermine the gov-

 POLITICAL UNREST IN HAITI
 The situation in Haiti has
 deteriorated since the execution
 of 19 military officers for "high
 treason" on 8 June.  Rumors of
 coup plotting are again prevalent
 as is the expectation of further
 punitive action by Duvalier.  As
 many as 72 people have taken asy-
 lum in various embassies in Port-
 au-Prince.
 Some of the officers who
 were executed had been close to
 Duvalier for years, and the action
 against them, combined with numer-
 ous changes in military commands
 which followed, has eroded Du-
 valier's already narrow power base.
 The creation of an unarmed police
 force on 1 June coincides with an
 apparent move on the part of
 Duvalier to downgrade the national
 militia as a security force.  No
 segment~of Haitian officialdom
 has remained unscathed by the
 purge, and businessmen are begin-
 ning to wonder if they are to be
 next.  One current rumor has it
 that Duvalier has admitted to the
 recent execution of 22 additional
 prisoners.
 The internal situation has
 caused trouble with both the
 Brazilian and Bahamian governments.
 A dispute over the asylum question
 resulted on 8 June in the expul-
 sion of Brazil's charge, who had
 been on duty for only a week.
 Relations are also strained with
 the government of the Bahamas,
 which has demanded that Haiti
 stop the flow of emigres.  A thou-
 sand or more Haitians have reached
 the Bahamas in recent weeks, but
 most of them were seeking economic
 improvement rather than political
 asylum.  They are being sent back
 to Haiti.
 The feud within the Duvalier
 family may be eased for the time
 being by the departure of son-in-
 law Colonel Max Dominique and his
 wife, the former Marie Denise
 Duvalier, who are leaving on
 23 June for Europe.  Dominique
 has been appointed ambassador to
 Spain, possibly to get him out
 of the way.  Many of the purged
 officers had been close to Do-
 minique, who resigned as military
 commander of the Western Depart-
 ment in late May as a protest
 against their arrest.

 fVEW DISORDERS POSSIBLE IN NORTHERN h1EXIC0
 The Mexican Government may
 face more trouble in the north-
 western border state of Sonora
 in connection with the elections
 scheduled there for 2 July.  Gen-
 eral order is likely to be main-
 tained, as it has been for the
 past month, only by the presence
 of federal troops who were sent
 in to quell a violent public
 protest against the gubernatorial
 candidate "imposed" by the ruling
 Institutional Revolutionary Party
 (PRI) .
 The refusal of the PRI to
 bow to overwhelming popular oppo-
 sition to the nomination--and
 therefore almost certain election
 of Faustino Felix Serna has in-
 creased the potential for renewed
 violence, however.  Gavernment-
 influenced newspaper and radio
 comment has added to the initial
 resentment by treating all oppo-
 sition to Felix Serna as inspired
 by Communist subversives.
 refuge across the border in
 Arizona, many teachers have been
 fired, and respectable and promi-
 nent citizens have been arrested
 and harassed.  Rumors that vast
 amounts of public money were
 used to "purchase" Felix's can-
 didacy and to buy off the press
 point up popular belief that
 corruption is rampant.
 If voters do not boycott the
 election, there will probably be
 a strong protest vote in favor
 of the National Action (PAN) can-
 didate, Gilberto Suarez.  Suarez,
 not a PAN member, is an attractive
 personality with funds to wa e
 a  ood cam ai n.                 25X1
 Further exacerbating the sit-
 uation are the continuing repri-
 sals against those who oppose
 Felix Serna's candidacy.  An es-
 timated 300 student leaders of
 the protest movement have sought
