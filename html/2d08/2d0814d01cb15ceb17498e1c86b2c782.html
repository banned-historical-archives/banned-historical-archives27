 LEBANON
 After a two-week siege, most of Tall
 Zatar Palestinian refugee camp in eastern
 Beirut fell into Christian hands this week.
 The Christians, in coordination with the
 Syrians, also scored against the
 Palestinians and Lebanese leftists in
 heavy fighting in the north.
 Only a small pocket of defenders is still
 holding out in Tall Zatar. The Christians
 have delayed announcing the fall of the
 camp, partly for fear of provoking
 Palestinian and leftist reprisals in other
 parts of the country. Flushed with victory,
 however, they are again insisting as a
 precondition to a new cease-fire that the
 fedayeen abide by their previous
 agreements with the Lebanese govern-
 ment, which place tight restrictions on
 fedayeen movements.
 On July 5, leftist and fedayeen forces,
 trying to relieve the pressure on them in
 Beirut and other areas, overran the town
 of Chekka and several nearby Christian
 villages in northern Lebanon. Chekka is

 on one of the access routes to the Chris-
 tian stronghold of Zagharta. By midweek
 the Christians launched a counterattack,
 retaking Chekka and moving southeast
 beyond traditional Christian areas to
 engage leftist forces at Amyun. Syrian
 forces may have fought alongside the
 Christians at Chekka; in any event, the
 Syrians helped out in the north by shelling
 Palestinian positions in Tripoli.
 Syrian and Christian forces apparently
 did link up last weekend just north of
 Beirut, tightening Syrian control over

 access to the capital. Syrian forces also
 resumed their shelling of the southern
 port city of Sidon this week and continued
 their blockade of several leftist and
 Palestinian-held towns in the northern
 Bekaa Valley.
 The new upsurge in fighting has virtual-
 ly frozen efforts by Libyan Prime
 Minister Jallud  and Arab  League
 mediators to arrange a cease-fire and get
 talks going.  Palestinian leader Yasir
 Arafat, who returned to Lebanon after
 several weeks' absence, did meet with
 Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam and
 Christian representatives on July 4 under
 Arab League auspices to try to work out a
 new truce. Subsequent scheduled talks
 were canceled, however, after the Palesti-
 nian attack on Chekka. The Arab League
 mediators later called for yet another
 meeting of Arab foreign ministers in
 Cairo on July 12.
 Syrian  Foreign  Minister  Khaddam
 went to Moscow this week apparently to
 try to explain Syrian policy in Lebanon to
 Soviet leaders and to mute their criticism
 of Syrian action against the Palestinians.
 Palestinian leaders, in turn, have stepped
 up their efforts to elicit support from the
 Soviets. Moscow has invited Arafat to
 visit soon, presumably to demonstrate
 continued Soviet support for the
 Palestinians and to counterbalance Khad-
 dam's visit.
 OAU SUMMIT
 The annual summit of the Organization
 of African Unity, which ended in
 Mauritius July 6, adopted tough rhetoric
 on South Africa and Rhodesia but largely
 sidestepped major territorial disputes in-
 volving member states.
 Besides condemning South Africa for
 its handling of recent student riots, the
 OAU called for increased support to
 Namibian insurgents, extension of the
 guerrilla struggle to South Africa, and for
 tighter economic sanctions. The summit
 also urged nonrecognition of Transkei,
 which is scheduled to become in October
 the  first of South Africa's tribal
 homelands to gain legal independence by
 agreement with Pretoria,
 The summit made no headway in
 reconciling Rhodesia's feuding
 nationalists. The OAU leaders simply
 reiterated their standing call that all aid
 for the insurgents be channeled through
 the OAU liberation committee based in
 Tanzania.
 Although the Israeli raid in Uganda
 was strongly censured, with a call for UN
 action, the conferees did not affirm OAU
 support for last year's UN resolution on
 Zionism or demand Israel's ouster from
 the UN.  The US was condemned for
 vetoing Angola's admission to the UN.
 The summit narrowly avoided a split
 over the Western Sahara by agreeing that
 the controversial issue, which pits Algeria

 against Morocco and Mauritania, should
 be taken up by an extraordinary summit
 later this year, providing one can be
 arranged. The present OAU stand is that
 recognition of the "republic" declared by
 the Algerian-backed Polisario Front is a
 matter for African states to decide in-
 dividually; only nine OAU states now
 recognize the provisional Polisario
 government.
 Further consideration of the divisive
 issue of the French Territory of the Afars
 and Issas-over which Ethiopia and
 Somalia are at loggerheads-was post-
 poned to a proposed round table con-
 ference of the territory's factions and
 liberation groups. Ghana has offered to
 host the conference next month. The key
 issue, of territorial guarantees for the new
 state  remains  to  be  decided.
 ISRAEL-UGANDA-KENYA
 The successful rescue by Israeli com-
 mandos of the hijacked Jewish airline
 passengers in Uganda last weekend has
 given Prime Minister Rabin's govern-
 ment, at least temporarily, a much needed
 psychological boost at home. As far as
 Rabin personally is concerned, it will help
 offset the widely held view that he is an in-
 decisive leader.
 The tour de force at Entebbe should
 strengthen Rabin's hand in dealing with
 his coalition partners in the cabinet, in-
 cluding  the  conservative  National
 Religious  Party.  Rabin is unlikely,
 however, to alter his cautious approach to
 divisive problems, such as the controversy
 over the unauthorized Jewish settlement
 at Qaduma, or toward peace negotiations.
 If anything, the hijacking episode will
 make Tel Aviv more determined than ever
 not to deal with the PLO.
 The operation may help make up for
 the frustrations the Israeli public has felt
 over the past several months as a result of
 the country's high inflation rate, Arab
 rioting, and intra-government wrangling,
 especially between Rabin and his chief
 rival, Defense Minister Peres.
 Kenyan Fears
 Since the raid, the Kenyans have
 become increasingly fearful that Uganda
 may retaliate militarily against Kenya for
 having allowed the Israelis to use Nairobi
 airport in their o eration.
 President Amin, humiliated by the raid,
 may indeed believe that he must take
 compensatory  military  action against
 Kenya. He has long been at odds with the
 Nairobi government; earlier this year he
 claimed a large part of western Kenya.
 Now that his term  as chairman of
 the OAU is over, he may feel less con-
 strained about attacking his neighbor.
 The Kenyans believe two additional
 Ugandan battalions were moved to the
 border this week to join units sent there
 last month after Amin again began mak-
 ing threats against Kenya. President
 Kenyatta's government apparently views
 the latest troop movements and the
 repeated references this week over Ugan-
 da Radio to "enemy aircraft" in Ugandan
 airspace as a ploy by Amin to whip up war
 hysteria among the Ugandans and under-
 cut advisers who reportedly have counsel-
 ed against a retaliatory attack.
 Kenyan apprehension is sure to be rein-
 forced by reports that 20 Libyan Mirage
 jet fighters arrived in Uganda this week to
 replace the Ugandan MIGs destroyed by
 the Israelis during the raid. Such a con-
 tingent could be intended merely as a
 show of support for Amin. Should Amin
 decide to make a military move, however,
 any Mirage aircraft stationed in Uganda     25X1
 would be capable of attacking Kenyan
 territory. Nairobi has only a weak air
 defense system.
 Kenya has responded by placing its
 army on alert and by delaying the ship-
 ment to landlocked Uganda of military
 equipment  recently  delivered  to  the
 Kenyan port of Mombasa. The Kenyans
 have also curtailed petroleum deliveries to
 Uganda in an effort to limit Kampala's
 military capabilities.
 The Kenyans probably are hoping that
 the  UK-traditionally  Kenya's  major
 source of arms-will come to their
 assistance, if necessary. Nairobi has a
 long-standing, if unwritten, agreement
 with the UK that provides for British
 assistance on request in the event of an ex-
 ternal attack or major internal trouble.
 London would be loath, however, to res-
 pond to a request for troops. Ethiopia,
 with which Kenya has a secret defense  25X1
 agreement, is now in no position to help,
 even if it were disposed to do so.

 SUDAN
 ports rose rapidly and nongold exports
 remained stagnant. The situation worsen-
 ed in 1975, forcing Pretoria to devalue
 twice.
 In 1976, conditions further deteriorated
 because of a drop in gold prices, weak de-
 mand for exports, and a high level of
 military purchases.
 The government has borrowed heavily
 and rolled over short-term loans obtained
 in 1975 to increase capital inflows.
 South Africa's options in dealing with
 its payments problems have narrowed.
 Shaky prospects for world gold prices rule
 out any abrupt increase in sales of gold
 from stocks. The international market
 already is absorbing increased Soviet
 sales,  and  periodic  International
 Monetary Fund auctions will add to inter-
 national supplies. Industrial demand for
 gold is running roughly 30 percent below
 its 1971 peak level. Speculative demand,
 which accounted for slightly more than
 half of the demand last year, is down
 sharply because of moderation in inflation
 and an upturn in real interest rates.
 With domestic inflation again edging
 upward to more than 10 percent, the
 government is unwilling to stimulate
 prices further by another devaluation. It is
 also reluctant to impose additional import
 controls or to pile more restraints on a
 sluggish economy. It already has stiffened
 monetary and fiscal measures during the
 past six months and has repeatedly
 tightened foreign exchange rules to relieve
 speculative pressures on its currency. It
 does not want to cut foreign military
 purchases.
 Exports will probably not begin
 accelerating appreciably until the fourth
 quarter. By then, the Western economic
 recovery may be making itself felt, and
 major new coal and iron ore export pro-
 jects will have started paying off. By con-
 tinued  scrimping and borrowing, the
 government should be able to muddle
 through unless gold prices sag badly.
 Foreign borrowing will be more expen-
 sive, however, because South Africa's
 economic and political problems have
 weakened  its  credit  rating.
 President Numayri, who came to power
 in a 1969 coup, last week survived yet
 another effort to topple him. The latest
 attempt, which apparently had substantial
 Libyan backing, was the most serious
 challenge he has faced since 1971, when
 Sudanese Communists almost succeeded
 in ousting him. The coup group included a
 substantial number of people, and there
 President Nurnayri 0L
 was extensive fighting in the capital area
 on July 2-3; several hundred persons are
 reported to have been killed.
 The  coup  move,  which  was  well
 planned, was apparently carried out
 largely by members of the ultraconserva-
 tive  Ansar  religious           sect  and  other
 rightist groups; many of the participants
 apparently were exiles who were infil-
 trated back into Khartoum for the oper-
 ation. The government, however, has
 portrayed the disturbance as an "in-
 vasion" by foreign mercenaries backed
 by Libya. Ansar leaders have long been
 at odds with  Numayri, having tried
 to overthrow him in 1970.
 Some disaffected  western Sudanese
 tribesmen may also have participated in
 the coup effort; the government claims it
 was led by an ex-army officer, believed to
 be a westerner, who had been implicated
 in previous coup attempts and had ap-
 parently been in Libya recently. There is
 no evidence that any military units as such
 were overtly disloyal to Numayri,
 although some individual military men
 may have sided with the rebels.
 Libyan President Qadhafi almost cer-
 tainly provided material support for the
 attempt. The coup group used Soviet-
 manufactured guns and munitions that
 apparently had been shipped to Libya.
 Tripoli may also have facilitated the
 secret return to Sudan to help organize
 the coup effort of Ansars exiled in Libya
 and Ethiopia. Sudan's close identification
 with President Sadat and Cairo's Middle
 Eastern negotiating policy is probably at
 the root of Libya's intrigues against
 Sudan. Khartoum broke diplomatic
 relations with Tripoli this week.
 Numayri's hold on power will continue
 to depend, as it always has, largely on his
 ability to keep the loyalty of key military
 e army-overwhelmingly manned by
 western  Sudanese tribesmen-has
 smarted under allegations that many of its
 members were involved in the abortive
 coup attempt last September. If Numayri
 moves harshly to censure the army, he
 may end up causin  his regime
 more-
 problems.
 SOUTH AFRICA
 v~
 South Africa has been experiencing
 foreign exchange difficulties that are like-
 ly to persist for several more months.
 The government has little choice but to
 continue measures to discourage imports
 and hope that gold prices do not sag
 further. The economy, as a result, will
 probably grow only about 2 percent this
 year.
 South  Africa's payments position
 began to deteriorate in late 1974 as im-

 SPAIN
 King Juan Carlos' appointment this
 week of Adolfo Suarez as prime minister
 is intended to boost the government's
 reform program. Suarez' choice of com-
 mitted reformists to two key posts in the
 Adolfo Suarez being sworn in as prime
 minister as King Juan Carlos looks on
 /VP
 new cabinet supports his assurances that
 he will press ahead with liberalization.
 But progress may be slowed because of his
 inability to persuade the leading refor-
 mists in the outgoing cabinet to stay or to
 induce any oppositionist leaders to join
 the cabinet.
 The new foreign minister, Marcelino
 Oreja, shares his predecessor's commit-
 ment to reform and support for Spain's
 entry in the EC but does not have
 Areilza's international stature. The new
 interior minister, Rodolfo Martin Villa,
 who laid plans for trade union reform
 while in the Syndical Ministry, is also
 regarded as a reformist.
 Most of the 10 newcomers to the 20-
 man cabinet are political moderates or
 technocrats, and several have a strong
 background in finance-reflecting
 Suarez' immediate intention to grapple
 with soaring inflation and other serious
 economic problems. Their youth and in-
 experience, however, will complicate their
 task. Some observers believe the cabi-
 net will last only until elections next year.
 In spite of strong rumors that Suarez
 would appoint members of Opus Dei-the
 secret lay Catholic society that dominated
 economic planning in the late 1960s and
 early 1970s-no  publicly identified
 members of that organization were ap-
 pointed, although at least two of the
 holdover ministers are reportedly linked
 to that organization. Also absent are any
 representatives of the far right.
 Suarez' efforts to form a cabinet were
 complicated by the manner of his appoint-
 ment. The King apparently worked quiet-
 ly behind the scenes to be sure he had suf-
 ficient votes to get his candidate through
 the rightist-dominated Council of the
 Realm, which provides the King a slate of
 three nominees from which to select a
 prime minister. Foreign Minister Areilza
 and Interior Minister Fraga, liberal
 leaders in the old cabinet, were disap-
 pointed they were not chosen, but even
 more unhappy over not having been con-
 sulted at all. As a result, they and several
 other reform-minded ministers refused to
 serve under Suarez. Suarez was also
 hampered by his previous ties to the Fran-
 co regime and by the rumors that he in-
 tended to include members of Opus Dei in
 his cabinet.
 WEST GERMANY..
 The West German government received
 widespread public approval last week
 following a major restatement of its
 policy toward the Soviet Union and
 Eastern Europe.
 Bonn's declaration, a belated response
 to the Soviet statement on East-West
 relations that appeared in Pravda in late
 May, begins by noting that the improve-
 ment of West German - Soviet relations
 since the late 1960s has been vital to the
 relaxation of tensions in Europe. Bonn
 asserts that it proceeds from the assump-
 tion that both countries long ago decided
 for peace, and the West Germans make
 clear that they believe detente must con-
 tinue and that they are willing to work
 constructively with the Soviets.
 At the same time, Bonn rejects im-
 plications in the Soviet statement that the
 Federal Republic endangers peace.
 In  response  to  specific  Soviet
 allegations, the West Germans assert
 that:
 ? The Soviet declaration did not
 contribute to peace when it attempted
 to divide West German politicians into
 good and bad groups.
 ? Peace is not served if national
 borders are declared inviolable while
 one side (the Soviets) continues to
 claim the right to decide for itself
 which regimes are "decadent."
 ? Those who claim or seek military
 superiority undermine the balance of
 power upon which peace in Europe
 depends.
 ? Attempts to alter the balance of
 power in other parts of the world (such
 as in Angola) with the aim of extend-
 ing one's sphere of influence only
 damage the cause of international
 peace.
 These major reservations underscore
 Bonn's skepticism about the durability of
 the Soviet peace commitment. This issue
 is particularly sensitive among West Ger-
 man voters, who go to the polls this Oc-
 tober.
 The policy statement did not dwell on
 Bonn's principal complaint that Moscow
 continues to drag its feet on including
 West  Berlin  in three bilateral
 humanitarian accords. West German
 diplomats have indicated, however, that
 Bonn is considering launching a broad in-
 itiative on this and other Berlin-related
 matters after the national election.
 One purpose of the declaration was to
 counter criticism from conservative
 circles that the Schmidt government is too
 soft toward the Soviets. Judging from the
 favorable press treatment and the op-
 position's reaction, this objective appears
 to  have  been  accomplished.

 ITALY
 /,-~
 The compromise bast weekend among
 Italy's major parties giving the Com-
 munists the presidency of the Chamber of
 Deputies could eventually lead to a
 broader arrangement allowing the Com-
 munists a consultative role in the govern-
 ment while denying them formal cabinet
 status.
 At its opening session on July 5, parlia-
 ment confirmed Pietro Ingrao, a Com-
 munist Party leader, as chamber president
 and former Christian Democratic prime
 minister Amintore Fanfani as president of
 the Senate. The Socialists, who finished
 third in the June 20-21 balloting and
 whose collaboration in the new govern-
 ment is essential, reportedly will be
 awarded the senior vice presidential
 positions in both houses. The allocation of
 parliamentary posts will be completed
 when parliament reconvenes on July 9.
 President Leone will soon begin con-
 sultations on the selection of a new prime
 minister. Interior Minister Cossiga, view-
 ed earlier as a strong candidate for the
 job, has said privately that he will defer to
 Budget Minister Andreotti, the Christian
 Democratic leader considered to have the
 best chance to enlist the support of the
 Socialists.
 )PI
 According to Cossiga, Andreotti has an
 additional advantage-sufficient strength
 within the party to move against the
 "historic heads" who are opposed to
 reform. Younger Christian Democratic
 members of parliament reportedly are
 becoming resentful that the old leadership
 is failing both to carry out its promise of
 renewal and to consult younger members
 on key decisions.
 Despite reported misgivings by Presi-
 dent Leone that an inordinate delay in
 forming a government could lead to
 public  impatience,  party  negotiations
 probably will be protracted. There are
 growing fears that the Socialists may be
 too badly divided to negotiate seriously
 toward a government solution.
 F
 POLAND-HUNGARY
 The Polish leadership tried to retrieve
 some of its lost political prestige last week
 by restating its intention to raise food
 prices in the future.
 In his first domestic appearance since
 the riots, party leader Gierek told a
 nationwide television audience on July 2
 that price increases are necessary for the
 good of the Polish nation. He promised to
 hold  extensive  public  discussions,
 however, before the hikes are made. The
 revisions will probably not be announced
 until this fall, when parliament
 reconvenes.
 Gierek played down the seriousness of
 the disturbances in late June, suggesting
 that arrests might be held to a minimum.
 He made a strong pitch to Polish
 patriotism, calling for a united Polish
 community and the avoidance of actions
 that would stain the good   name of
 Poland. Gierek expressed sorrow-"as a
 Pole"-for the "deeply regrettable in-
 cidents" that had occurred.
 The Polish party leader also endorsed
 Prime Minister Jaroszewicz's "fruitful"
 leadership of the government, apparently
 to quell any speculation that he might
 soon be replaced. Jaroszewicz would
 make a convenient scapegoat because he
 is closely associated in the public mind
 with the price hikes; but Gierek has
 probably decided not to act precipitately.
 Speaking to a group of agricultural
 cooperative workers on July  5,
 Jaroszewicz paid personal tribute to
 Gierek and echoed his remarks that
 Poland "cannot run away" from
 problems. He, too, promised that the
 government would consider popular views
 before drafting new price proposals. He
 gave a sampling of public recommen-
 dations which suggested that the govern-
 ment will increase prices gradually and
 selectively.
 The Polish unrest did not prevent
 Hungary from going ahead on July 5 with
 price increases on meat products that had
 been announced last November. The in-
 creases average about 30 percent- slight-
 ly less than expected-and will be partial-
 ly offset by a monthly income supplement
 for most Hungarians that will buy less
 than 1.5 kg. (3.30 lbs.) of pork. The
 Hungarian population appears to have
 taken the price hikes in stride.
 Hungary, unlike Poland, has gradually
 raised prices on a number of consumer
 products without incident over the past
 several years.

 The state of emergency imposed on

 process of political polarization in
 Jamaica and solidifying Prime Minister

 his party.
 On June 26, one week after the

 , SOVIET UNION - NORWAY
 The Soviets, within the space of five
 days, fired three SS-7 ICBMs into an area
 of the Barents Sea that is under negotia-
 tion between Moscow and Oslo to deter-
 mine an eventual demarcation line..
 The first missile was launched on July
 2, the others on July 6. There may be ad-
 ditional firings; Moscow had previously
 announced its intention to fire missiles
 into this area between July I and August
 10.
 Moscow is in the process of dismantling
 SS-7 launchers as part of the SALT
 agreement, and the firings are an ex-
 peditious means of emptying the silos.
 There has been no progress in the
 Soviet-Norwegian  negotiations,  and
 Norwegian officials are interpreting the
 missile firings as an attempt to intimidate
 Norway before the next round of talks.
 Oslo is expected to make a demarche
 emphasizing the threat to shipping and
 fishing interests posed by the firings.
 The development of offshore oil leases
 and the control of fish stocks through
 ever-widening economic zones have in-
 creased interest in the waters around
 Scandinavia. The exploitation of these
 resources in both the Baltic and Barents
 seas could restrict to some degree the
 Soviet navy's unimpeded access to the
 Atlantic.
 This clearly has concerned the Soviets,
 and they may hope that some muscle flex-
 ing will cause the Scandinavians to tailor
 offshore development in a way that will
 minimize its effect on Soviet naval ac-
 tivities. At the same time, the Soviets also
 realize that the political atmosphere in
 Scandinavia is such that even limited
 pressure will tend to undermine the kind
 of political headway Moscow is attempt-
 ing to make in this part of Europe.

 Labor Party leader Seaga has denounc-

 witch hunt" aimed at assuring victory for
 Manley and a majority of his party's can-
 didates in the elections that must be held
 by next spring. Pearnell Charles, a Labor
 Party senator and its deputy leader, has
 been arrested and indicted under the
 emergency orders. Seaga claims, in addi-
 tion, that three of his party's candidates
 and many of their workers have been
 arrested.
 The blatantly partisan enforcement of
 the state of emergency has caused public
 opinion to turn against the government,
 according to the US embassy in Kingston.
 Manley's failure so far to establish a
 tribunal to review the cases of persons
 detained-as required by law-also has
 undermined the government's credibility.
 Seaga believes that a reaction favoring his
 party has already set in.   Manley took
 the offensive against his critics on June 29
 in a televised speech in parliament. He
 claimed that the security forces have un-
 covered evidence of subversion and
 terrorism  aimed at overthrowing his
 government. He read from documents
 that he claimed branded him and the
 government as communist. A subsequent
 government-sponsored propaganda cam-
 paign has attempted to link the Labor
 Party with "plots" against the govern-
 ment. One of the major sources of the
 charges against the opposition, however,
 is so unreliable and his story conflicts so
 flagrantly with allegations he has
 previously made as to cast suspicion on
 Manley's claims. (Jamaica's current

 PERU
 There have been no fresh outbreaks of
 violence following the day of riots and
 looting set off by the government's an-
 nouncement on June 30 of drastic austeri-
 ty measures that included price hikes, a
 wage freeze, and new taxes. The govern-
 ment insists that the situation is back to
 normal, but this claim is belied by official
 efforts to stop rumors, panic food buying,
 and a heavy military presence in the
 streets.
 A debate is reportedly under way
 among armed forces leaders over the
 wisdom and efficacy of President Morales
 Bermudez'  policies.  The  austerity
 measures were in large part dictated by
 U A/
 the international financial community as
 a precondition for granting Peru an essen-

 vulnerable, nonetheless, to the criticism of
 his supporters, who may charge that the

 his detractors that he is toadying to

 month  administration has failed to
 provide decisive  leadership.
 The death July 6 of Chinese Polit-
 buro member Chu Te has somewhat al-
 tered the balance of power in the party
 leadership. Chu was a highly respected
 party elder, and his moderate views
 probably played an important role in con-
 taining the campaign against ousted vice
 premier Teng Hsiao-ping.
 Despite his 90 years, Chu reportedly
 was outspoken in defense of Teng and
 scornful of some of the party's younger,
 more radical leaders. Two poems by Chu
 published in March implicitly criticized
 the disunity in the party created by the
 campaign against Teng.
 Chu's  death  reduces to five the
 membership of the  Politburo's elite
 standing committee. Of these, only De-
 fense                 Minister  Yeh  Chien-ying  can
 clearly be counted as a member of the
 moderate camp.
 Premier Hua Kuo-feng, also a stand-

 avoided firm factional alliances, although
 his policy preferences appear to be gen-
 erally moderate, and he has been at-
 tacked by the left in the past.
 With yet another vacancy at the highest
 level of the party-four standing com-

 Chu's funeral should be the occasion
 for the first major leadership turnout
 since the funeral of Chou En-lai in
 January.  Several  officials  have  not
 appeared publicly since that time. The
 turnout will be an indication of whether
 any of Teng's second-echelon associates
 have fallen victim to the campaign against
 him.

 Argentina's military junta, three months after taking over,
 has made some gains, especially in the economic area. But
 President Videla must soon demonstrate further economic
 progress as well as to make inroads against terrorism.
 Argentina: Tasks for the Junta
 Argentina's military junta has achieved
 no dramatic breakthroughs on major
 problems in the three months since it
 seized power, but there have been en-
 couraging  signs,  particularly  on  the
 economic front. The next few months will
 be decisive.
 President Videla faces a formidable
 public relations challenge, in addition to
 the challenges posed by the economy and
 continuing terrorist activity. He must, on
 the one hand, deal quickly and firmly
 enough with major problems to satisfy his
 fellow officers. On the other hand, he
 must avoid actions that will dissipate the
 popular  acceptance  the  junta  has
 painstakingly nurtured. For the moment,
 the military as a whole seems disposed to
 go along with Videla's low-key, gradualist
 approach to governing. Some officers'
 patience could be tried, however, if the
 pace of progress does not quicken.
 Popular resistance has not yet been a
 factor,  but political restrictions and
 economic austerity measures could yet
 lead to widespread public dissatisfaction.
 President Videla is well suited for the
 balancing act he must perform. He has
 impeccable military credentials and the
 respect of his fellow officers, even though
 there has been some criticism of his style.
 Civilians see him as a man with no thirst
 for power and one who took the reins of
 government reluctantly.
 The President sets the tone of the
 government; his appearance is austere and
 he makes no promises, preferring to
 repeat his call for hard work. Other of-
 ficials display the same attitude. Economy
 Minister Martinez de Hoz, charged with
 overseeing a fundamental overhaul of the
 nation's economy, describes his job in
 matter-of-fact terms and avoids the temp-
 tation to make promises.
 The government is not so much modest
 as practical. Videla and his colleagues ful-
 ly realize the danger of setting unrealistic
 goals that would risk widespread aliena-
 tion if they are not achieved. The public
 statements of junta spokesmen are a con-
 trast to the extravagant behavior and
 lavish promises of the ousted Peronists.
 So far, the President and his advisers
 mm.
 seem to have succeeded in impressing
 their countrymen with the need for per-
 sonal sacrifice in the interest of restoring
 economic health to the nation.
 From the outset, Videla has walked a
 fine line between authoritarianism and
 respect for civilian institutions. Congress
 is dissolved,  all  political  activity  is
 banned, and the media are restricted. The
 President has stopped short of cutting
 civilians out of the governing process en-
 tirely, however. A number of key advisers
 are civilians, and the principal political
 parties remain intact, as does the huge
 Peronist labor confederation. Videla is

 not squeamish about using authority, but
 he does see limits to the amount of power
 he needs.
 Restoring the Economy
 Restoration of the shattered economy is
 the most pressing challenge facing the jun-
 ta. Martinez de Hoz has had some success
 in reducing the worst inflation in Argen-
 tina's history and attracting badly needed
 financial support from abroad, but there
 is a long way to go.
 The economic team has a far-reaching
 program that envisions revitalization of
 private business and aims to reduce the
 government's role in some economic ac-
 tivities, such as energy production. The
 foreign investment law has been rewritten
 to remove most of the restrictions on
 foreign capital and profit remittances.
 Agriculture, long neglected, has received
 a package of new incentives.
 There has been no significant popu-
 lar resistance to the economic program,
 but the likelihood of continuing accep-
 tance of austerity measures by a society
 long accustomed to living well seems
 small. Labor, in particular, has been
 severely affected by the new economic
 program. Deprived suddenly of its po-
 litical and economic predominance, or-
 ganized labor may be ripe for leftist
 influence.
 Although the military has put controls
 on the labor movement, labor remains
 potentially the most important source of
 opposition to the government. There have
 already been a few sporadic work stop-
 pages and slowdowns in major industrial
 plants. This alarms the junta, both
 because it is a challenge to government
 authority  and  because  it  threatens
 economic productivity. Thus far, the
 regime has overcome labor protests by
 furloughing the ringleaders, but it has
 made clear it is willing to use force if
 necessary.
 The Terrorist Problem
 The problem of leftist terrorism has
 plagued civilian and military govern-
 ments alike since the late 1960s. The
 guerrillas do not pose a direct threat to
 government stability, but the military
 is committed to rooting them out, and
 Videla's handling of the situation is
 one criterion on which he will be
 judged,  particularly  by  his  fellow
 officers.
 The army appears to have made some
 inroads against insurgents both in the
 countryside and in the cities. In the
 remote province of Tucuman, government
 forces are reportedly killing and capturing
 a growing number of members of the
 People's Revolutionary Army and de-
 stroying more and more safesites and
 sources of supplies.
 The urban terrorism carried out by the
 Argentine troops on an operation
 against insurgents in Tucuman Province
 People's Army and by the Montoneros is
 more difficult to handle. The insurgents'
 hit-and-run tactics are effective in the
 metropolitan sprawl of Buenos Aires, and
 the appeal the terrorists have for youth-
 ful  Argentines-the  main  source  of
 recruits-continues despite  increasing
 reports  of  government anti-terrorist
 successes.
 It will  be some time before     the
 military's aggressive campaign can be
 judged a success; bombings and guerrilla
 attacks on officials are continuing. During
 the past two weeks, for example, terrorists
 murdered several military officers, in-
 cluding the second federal police chief in
 two years.
 Videla may ultimately face serious
 trouble from critics in the military who
 urge him to take a much tougher ap-
 proach to the problem. The thrust of the
 argument is that, in order to eradicate the
 guerrillas who hide among and draw some
 support from the populace, the govern-
 ment must impose stronger controls on
 the population as a whole.
 The so-called "hard-line" officers also
 want  vengeance  against the  former
 civilian leaders whose corruption and in-
 competence, they argue, led Argentina to
 near chaos. The advocates of repression
 are, in short, pressing for almost un-
 limited arrest powers, dissolution of all
 political groupings, and the dismember-
 ment of the entire labor movement.
 The President, too, is committed to a
 "fight to the finish" with terrorism, but he
 believes the "hard-line" approach would
 do more harm than good. Videla wants to
 avoid the sort of international oppro-
 brium that has been aimed at Chile be-
 cause of human rights violations and
 that has made it difficult for Chile to ob-
 tain needed foreign financial aid. Argen-
 tina is depending on further infusions of
 foreign financial support.
 Videla is also mindful of the significant
 political divisions within his country,
 which would amost certainly be inten-
 sified by repressive government measures.
 A Role for Civilians
 Videla, unlike the "hard-liners," sees
 some role for civilians in the government.
 The President's public attitude toward
 civilians is conciliatory, and his advisers
 are engaged in a dialogue with certain
 politicians and labor leaders. This ap-
 proach has drawn  the fire of the
 President's critics.
 Although Videla is not now in any
 serious  trouble,  the appeal  of the
 "hard-line" may widen, especially if the
 military judges that progress on ma-
 jor  national  problems  is  too  slow.
 Recent abductions and murders of known
 and suspected leftists by rightist vig-
 ilantes, although not approved by the
 regime, clearly have the sympathy of a
 number of military officers, some in
 key positions. The President's efforts
 to end these abuses have had little if

 foreseeable future; how repressive it be-
 As national elections approach-they must be held by next
 spring-Prime Minister Manley will be under growing pressure
 to raise bauxite prices to help stem the serious decline in
 Jamaica's economy.
 Declines in Jamaica's bauxite out-
 put, reduced tourist trade, lower sugar
 prices, and a dearth of private investment
 have resulted in serious foreign exchange
 difficulties and a further reduction in
 economic activity.
 The only easy recourse for Prime
 Minister Manley's government would be
 to raise taxes on the aluminum com-
 panies, which would have no choice but to
 raise bauxite and alumina prices. Other
 Caribbean bauxite producers as well as
 Guinea would be likely to follow any price
 increase by Jamaica. These producers ac-
 count for about 75 percent of US bauxite
 and alumina imports.
 When the left-leaning Manley became
 prime minister in 1972, the country had
 excellent growth prospects, especially in
 aluminum and tourism. At first the
 economy did well under Manley, but in
 the past 18 months it has deteriorated
 rapidly:
 ? Government pressures against the
 aluminum companies have caused a
 sharp decline in bauxite and alumina
 investment.
 ? Manley's socialist rhetoric and his
 rapprochement with Cuba have scared
 other foreign investors away and led to
 large capital flight.

 deal with the problems that prompted
 military intervention in the first place. If
 the President and his supporters have
 this.
 Jamaica: Economic Difficulties
 the bauxite strikes, bauxite and alumina
 exports are likely to recover in the second
 half of the year. Even though an explosion
 on July 6 may force the closure of Alcoa's
 Clarendon alumina plant-representing
 15 percent of Jamaican capacity-for the
 rest of the year, we expect bauxite and
 alumina exports to increase by 35 percent
 in the second half of this year. We expect
 no improvement in earnings from sugar
 and anticipate a drop in tourism receipts.
 With continued import restrictions, the
 current account deficit for the second half
 of 1976 should fall by $80 million to just
 over $100 million.
 Jamaica could finance this deficit with
 the recent $87 million loan from its Carib-
 bean Common Market partners and ad-
 ditional aid from the World Bank and
 other official sources. This, however,
 would largely exhaust Jamaica's borrow-
 ing potential and would leave imports 15
 percent below the 1975 level.
 In order to increase imports from pre-
 sent restricted levels, Jamaica will have no
 choice but to raise bauxite taxes and
 prices. An average price hike of 30 per-
 cent for bauxite would be required to
 allow imports to rise to the 1975 level. As
 national elections-which must be held by
 the spring of next year-approach, the
 likelihood of a price increase will grow.
 The aluminum companies will probably
 not resist further tax increases, particular-
 ? Strikes have brought on a 30-per-
 cent drop in bauxite and alumina out-
 put in the first half of 1976.
 ? Violent crime, on the rise for
 years, has recently taken an anti-
 foreign turn, leading to a sharp drop in
 tourism.
 ? In the first half of 1976, the price
 of sugar, one of Jamaica's main ex-
 ports, fell 50 percent.

 North Korea appears to be entering a prolonged period of
 change and uncertainty. Its program of economic moderniza-
 tion is faltering, and Kim II-song, now 64 and concerned about
 the survival of his special brand of ideology, is embarked on a
 controversial effort to groom his son as his successor.
 North Korea: A Period of Uncertainty
 North Korea appears to be entering a
 prolonged period of change and uncer-
 tainty. The program to promote rapid
 economic growth through a quick infusion
 of Western machinery and technology is
 foundering on the shoals of bureaucratic
 ineptitude and massive default on foreign
 debt. Given the resilience of the North
 Korean people, long inured to sacrifice
 and deprivation, the regime will probably
 muddle through its current economic dif-
 ficulties.
 President Kim II-song knows that his
 party must prepare a new generation of
 leaders, but he seems haunted by the
 prospect that loyalty to his doctrine and
 leadership will not long survive his depar-
 ture. In an unprecedented move for a
 nation that still regards itself as a mem-
 ber of the socialist community, Kim is
 grooming his own son as his successor.
 Kim in Control
 There has been no serious challenge to
 Kim 11-song since the late 1950s when he
 purged the last of his factional rivals from
 the ruling Political Committee of the
 Korean Workers' Communist Party. At
 64, Kim is still a vigorous leader, although
 heart disease and high blood pressure may
 cause him major medical complications
 within the next three years or so.
 Throughout the spring of this year, he
 entertained a steady stream of third-world
 leaders seeking to garner support in the
 nonaligned movement for this year's
 diplomatic confrontation with South
 Korea. He expects to attend personally
 the nonaligned summit conference at
 Colombo in August.
 As part of the current six-year
 economic plan (1971-76), Kim embarked
 on an ambitious effort to seek improved
 economic ties, capital equipment, and
 technology from the industrialized West.
 The acquisition of whole plants from
 Western Europe and Japan through
 medium-term credits was seen as a way to
 achieve rapid modernization and enable
 Pyongyang to compete with the
 fast-growing economy of South Korea. At
 the same time the program would help
 reduce Pyongyang's economic
 dependence on the USSR and China.
 Pyongyang had intended to pay for the
 imported machinery with increased ex-
 ports to the West, but the world-wide
 recession cut demand and prices for non-
 ferrous metals, North Korea's major ex-
 port. The North Koreans also had to im-
 port large amounts of grain to make up
 for a poor harvest in 1972-73. Although
 circumstances  beyond  their  control
 caused some of their problems, North
 Korean planners themselves were over-
 ly optimistic. None of the Western-
 supplied plants has yet started full pro-
 duction; some of the large complexes
 probably have started partial operations.
 As the hard economic realities began to
 make themselves felt, Pyongyang
 attempted to renegotiate contracts and
 credit arrangements and in some cases
 was granted one-to-two-year extensions.
 Debt rescheduling provides only a tem-
 porary relief, however-the old debts are
 still outstanding and the interest charges
 are even higher. Pyongyang's total out-
 standing debt to Western Europe and
 Japan is roughly $1 billion.
 The highly publicized debt problems
 should not, of course, obscure the real
 economic growth that North Korea has
 experienced. It is estimated that industrial
 output over the past few years has risen at
 an annual rate of 10-12 percent. The
 North Koreans have an active defense in-
 dustry and produce a growing assortment
 of ground force and naval equipment.
 A Stoic Populace
 One way the regime hopes to counter its
 payments problem is by belt-tightening at
 home. Kim I1-song reportedly has ordered
 a complete suspension of food imports. If
 there is any harvest failure in the near
 term, the population will have to make do

 with less. There is not likely to be any
 major manifestation of discontent. North
 Korea may well be the most thoroughly
 mobilized society in the communist camp.
 Over 25 percent of adults, for example,
 are members of the party, and all youths
 must join party-sponsored mass
 organizations at an early age.
 Son and Heir
 Like most aging despots, Kim II-song is
 beginning to exhibit growing concern over
 the survival of his special brand of
 ideology and his own place in Korean
 history. Mindful of Stalin's fate and the
 turmoil of China's Cultural Revolution,
 Kim is taking steps to groom his elder
 son, Kim Chong-il, as his successor.
 Inside Korean Communist Party
 circles, the 36-year-old Kim Chong-il is
 already being accorded authority and
 prestige second only to the elder Kim. In-
 formation from secret party documents
 confirms that Kim Chong-il has been
 organizing party functions and issuing im-
 portant guidelines since early 1974.
 There have been no references to the
 son in the national press or radio, either as
 successor or in any other capacity.
 Instead, the North Korean media are us-
 ing  a  special  term-the "party
 center"-to connote the activities of the
 younger Kim.  This term may well
 describe  some sort  of group within
 the party hierarchy that includes Kim
 Kim Chong-il
 O-.
 Chong-il and possibly a few close asso-
 ciates.
 President Kim may have tactical con-
 siderations in mind in avoiding public
 designation of his son as his successor. He
 may want the son to prove himself in a
 key but unpublicized role. The elder Kim
 may also want to avoid relegating himself
 prematurely to a lame-duck status and to
 deflect any charges of nepotism.
 Kim 11-song probably anticipates that
 the move will be unpopular with other
 senior cadre. He certainly has the power
 to declare his son successor at any time,
 but he may reason that such an abrupt
 step might only drive disgruntled elements
 within the party under cover. Moving in a
 more deliberate fashion provides a greater
 opportunity for the elder Kim to gauge                Kim II-song

 The Khmer Communists appear to believe that the old
 Cambodia must be thoroughly eradicated before a new, spartan
 society can be established.
 Cambodia: First Year Under Communism
 The year of communist control in Cam-
 bodia has demonstrated the fanatical
 determination of Cambodian leaders to
 recast Khmer society in a spartan, rural
 mold.
 Refugee reports and the observations of
 diplomats who visited Cambodia last
 spring describe a regime that has used
 extremely harsh methods to ensure a
 docile and compliant population. None
 of the evidence available contradicts
 a cumulative picture of total regimenta-
 tion brutally enforced.
 The Khmer communists appear to
 believe that the old Cambodia must be
 thoroughly eradicated before a new order
 can be established. The blend of ideologi-
 cal fanaticism and the exigencies of popu-
 lation control reflect a deep-seated prej-
 udice against the sophisticated ways of
 Cambodia's former urban dwellers, many
 of whom were Chinese or Vietnamese.
 The Foreign Community
 Cambodia's new leaders are deter-
 mined to protect their country's in-
 dependence from possible foreign en-
 croachments, particularly by Vietnam or
 any country which dealt with the previous
 regime. They consistently betray extreme
 insecurity  toward the  outside  world,
 which  is   reflected  in their stringent
 efforts to isolate the population from
 outside influences.
 The few diplomatic missions allowed in
 Phnom Penh are under virtual house
 arrest, confined to their compounds, with
 meals delivered daily by soldiers who
 speak only Khmer. Diplomats are unable
 to  move  about  the  city  except  by
 prearranged government car. There is no
 diplomatic social life.
 Messages are communicated to the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs by a single
 functionary who visits the missions daily.
 The flight from Phnom Penh to Peking
 every two weeks is the main link be-
 tween the foreign representatives and
 their capitals.
 The communists have taken a similarly
 uncompromising approach to the large
 foreign community living in Cambodia at
 the time of the take-over.
 All of the several hundred thousand
 Vietnamese who had been making their
 livelihoods in Cambodia's cities and
 rural areas have been expelled. The
 tens of thousands of ethnic Chinese,
 mostly city and town dwellers, have
 been  forced  into  the  countryside
 with the Cambodians to work in the
 rice fields.
 The only foreigners in significant
 numbers tolerated by the communists are
 the thousand-odd advisers from China who
 are helping to keep a few factories func-
 tioning and providing other forms of
 technical advice. These advisers reported-
 ly keep a very low profile, as do the few
 North Koreans who are also present.

 The Peasant Culture
 The commitment to the so-called
 peasant culture is total. Phnom Penh
 and  other  cities are  empty  except
 for settlements of workers next to the few
 factories the communists feel must keep
 producing cement, textiles, and other
 basic materials. Returned diplomats are
 put to work in the fields to learn to grow
 rice and acquaint themselves with the new
 way of life prescribed for the whole coun-
 try by the regime.
 The government is betting heavily that
 a substantial rice surplus will put the
 economy on a sound footing and make the
 country independent of foreign help.
 Miles of irrigation canals have been dug,
 new lands opened to cultivation, and
 millions forced to work from dawn to
 dusk in the fields. The government may
 well achieve its objective of an export sur-
 plus, with which it expects to pay for
 Cambodia's other needs.
 The traditional family unit is one victim
 of the massive reordering of Cambodian
 society. While a certain amount of separa-
 tion was an unavoidable consequence of
 the enormous population relocation that
 followed the communist victory, the new
 regime apparently has deliberately tried
 to expunge family loyalties in order to
 substitute forcibly new loyalty patterns-
 to the commune and to the state.
 Refugees report that unsupervised com-
 munist squads are assigned to each
 village, and although conditions vary,
 people are typically grouped in tens, with
 one supervisor and three cells of three per-
 sons. Each member of a cell is responsible
 for the behavior of the other two. People
 who make too many "mistakes" are led
 away and never seen again.
 The refugees say there are no "people's
 courts," and the local communist squads
 decide who lives or dies. In some areas, all
 former civil servants have allegedly been
 executed  along  with  their  families.
 Former officers and noncommissioned
 officers have been killed, and in many
 areas even privates of the defeated army
 are being sought out and killed.
 Apparently, members of the former
 middle class, including teachers, students,
 technicians, and businessmen, are suspect.
 Doctors reportedly have either been killed
 or sent to the rice paddies and have been
 replaced by youths who are given three
 months' training.
 Even  the  bonzes  have  not  es-
 caped. Buddhism has been rejected as
 offering nothing of value, and all the
 temples have been closed. Those monks
 not killed suffer severe persecution.
 There is no way even for the com-
 munists to estimate seriously the number
 of deaths, but the diplomats guess that the
 population may be down by 15 to 20 per-
 cent.
 Most of the information on condi-
 tions in the countryside comes from
 refugees, and there is no way to verify
 these accounts or the universality of the
 conditions described. Nevertheless, there
 is little doubt that executions have de-   25X1
 prived Cambodia of irreplaceable special
 skills, inevitably making the regime more
 dependent on Chinese advisers.
 The drought has already caused substantial crop losses and
 made for worsening trade balances this year. It will add to in-

 Policy under greater budgetary strain.

 Western Europe: Economic Impact of Drought
 The drought in Western Europe has
 already caused substantial crop losses and
 made for worsening trade balances this
 year. It will cause some stimulation to in-
 flation and will put the EC's common
 agricultural  policy under greater
 budgetary strain.
 Rainfall has been inadequate in much
 of Western Europe since late last year; in
 southern England and central Spain dry
 conditions have prevailed since last
 summer. The drought in the UK and
 France-primarily     in    the
 northwest-may be the worst dry spell in
 the past 200 years. French meteorologists
 predict the dry weather will continue into
 September. The Low Countries, West
 Germany, and Italy to date have been less
 seriously affected.
 The most immediate and severe impact
 of the drought is on crop prospects, es-
 pecially in France and Spain. The greatest
 losses are forecast for coarse grains, par-
 ticularly barley and corn. Wheat produc-
 tion is still expected to rise slightly.
 We now estimate that grain production
 for the 1976-1977 marketing year in
 Western Europe as a whole will be 129
 million tons, down 2 percent from last
 year's low level and almost 10 percent
 below earlier estimates. Without rain in

 coming weeks, further losses of 3 to 4
 million tons could occur. The EC's
 agriculture commissioner said last week
 that EC grain production in this
 marketing year will approximate last
 year's 98 million tons-about 10 percent
 lower than an estimate in early May.
 Grain Exports
 Production losses will mean lower ex-
 port availabilities and increased import
 demand-thus worsening trade balances
 in Western Europe. Most countries will
 turn to the US for a major portion of their
 increased grain imports.
 The EC Commission has lowered its es-
 timate of total wheat exports this year and
 next from 8 or 9 million tons to 4 or 5
 million tons. We had earlier estimated
 that EC corn imports from third countries
 would drop about 1 million tons, but we
 now expect an increase of 500,000 tons.
 Imports of other feed grains may also in-
 crease-the EC now expects to be a net
 importer of barley rather than a net ex-
 porter as it earlier predicted.
 Spain, nearly self-sufficient in wheat in
 recent years, will have to increase im-
 ports. Spanish imports of corn during the
 coming year are now forecast at about 3.9
 million tons, 300,000 tons more than in
 1975-1976.
 Sugar beets and other crops also have
 been hit by drought, particularly in
 France and the UK. The EC estimates
 that 100,000 to 150,000 hectares (250,000
 to 370,000 acres) of sugar beets-about 6
 percent of the total-have been lost. So
 far, world sugar prices have only been
 slightly affected, but poor yield tests in
 August would push prices up. We believe
 regional losses in fruit and vegetable crops
 are also substantial.
 Livestock
 Reduced fodder supplies are forcing
 many beef producers to market their cat-
 tle early, adding to existing EC surpluses.
 The EC indicates that cattle slaughtering
 is running 45 percent above last year's
 level in certain drought-affected areas. In
 France, with 30 percent of the EC dairy
 herd, farmers are slaughtering cows in in-
 creasing numbers, putting more
 downward pressure on beef prices. Many
 British cattlemen are attempting to send
 their herds north to greener pastures in
 Scotland.  Because of increased
 marketings this summer, supplies may be
 tighter next year.
 The cow slaughterings, primarily in
 France,  will  reduce-but not
 eliminate-surplus EC dairy production.
 Although milk production in the most
 severely affected area of France has
 dropped 20 percent, EC dairy production
 for the first half of 1976 was 6 to 7 percent
 above the same period a year ago. The EC
 Commission estimates that even if the
 drought continues, total Community
 dairy production will rise 3 percent over
 last year.
 Dry conditions in EC countries almost
 certainly will add to budgetary strains on
 the Common Agricultural Policy. With
 the increased slaughtering of beef and
 dairy cattle, the minimum price program
 will lead to expanded purchases of beef by
 the Community. Intervention agency
 stocks already amount to 310,000 tons of
 beef and will grow.
 Dairy cattle are not normally part of
 the EC beef price support system, but the
 EC agricultural ministers agreed in late
 June to a French request to include cer-
 tain categories of dairy beef through July
 31. The situation will be reviewed at the
 next EC Council meeting.
 The drought will cause a drop in farm
 incomes this year, primarily in France,
 the UK, and Spain. The Common
 Agricultural  Policy does not provide
 direct income subsidies to farmers, and
 remedial actions will be left to national
 governments. France, for example, has
 promised to maintain farm income in
 1976 and initially set aside $210 million
 for this purpose. In September, when the
 extent of crop losses becomes clearer, sub-
 stantially more aid is likely. Facing a
 serious Socialist-Communist challenge in
 the 1978 legislative election, the govern-
 ment cannot afford to alienate some of its
 staunchest supporters.
 As the drought continues, its in-
 flationary impact will grow. Consumers
 will be partly insulated by EC price
 regulations on grain and sugar, but the
 rise in prices for fruits and vegetables,
 which are not tightly controlled, will be
 considerably greater.
 Impact on Industry
 France and Spain will have to increase
 oil imports because of reduced hydroelec-
 tric power. In France, where hydroelectric
 plants provide one third of the electricity
 generated, production is running 30 per-
 cent below the levels of a year ago; in
 Spain hydropower output (normally 13
 percent of total) is down about 20 percent.
 We estimate that making up this deficit
 by increasing thermal power production
 will boost French oil consumption this
 year by about 60,000 barrels per day, ad-
 ding close to $300 million to the oil im-
 port bill.
 Thus far the effect of the drought on in-
 dustrial activity has been limited to some
 specialty steel producers in France. Cuts
 in electricity supplies have forced a few
 firms to curtail operation of their electric
 arc furnaces. The hardest hit steelworks is
 a plant in Le Creusot, where 300 workers
 have been laid off following a 62-percent
 drop in the firm's supply of electricity.
 Some other industrial consumers have
 had their supplies reduced, and
 households and other users of low-voltage
 electricity have had their voltage cut 5
 percent.                        25X1
