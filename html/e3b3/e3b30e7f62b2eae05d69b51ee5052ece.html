 pro-UAR elements.     The Israelis
 have long indicated they would
 view either development as ner-
 cessitating some action on their
 part, and military circles in
 Israel have hinted that they
 favor an immediate occupation
 of West Jordan despite the prob-
 lems raised by the presence of
 a large Arab refugee population
 there.   Prime Minister  Ben-
 Gurion last week proposed that
 if the status quo in Jordan were
 changed, West Jordan should be
 demilitarized under the aegis
 of the UN and Israel's frontiers
 should be guaranteed by the UN
 and the "great powers."
 Kurdish communal elements in
 Kirkuk  in northern Iraq on 25
 October was suppressed by the
 army after some considerable
 loss of life and property damage.
 This disorder was probably a
 product of Kurdish excitement
 over the visit of Mulla Mustafa
 Barzani, Kurdish leader recent-
 ly returned from the USSR, al-
 though the government apparently
 has sought to minimize publicity
 over his tour of his Kurdish
 home areas.
 A clash broke out in Bagh-
 dad on 27 October, when pro-UAR
 demonstrators  heading  toward
 the airport to welcome a visit-
 ing UAR dignitary were inter-
 cepted by a mob of anti-UAR
 partisans, probably organized
 by local Communists.  Army tanks
 were used to suppress this inci-
 dent, after police stood aside.
 The Iraqi Baathists con-
 tinue to assert that.former Dep-
 uty Premier Arif will return on
 5 November.   They anticipate
 that he will be brought back
 into the government as a member
 of a predominantly military cab-
 inet rather than as the head of
 a new regime.    Arif's where-
 abouts is still uncertain.  Ru-
 mors have had him in Switzer-
 land, Rome, and, most recently,
 in Cairo.  These rumors probably
 represent little more than wish-
 ful thinking by Baathist sup-
 porters,  but the political situ-

 TAIWAN STRAIT SITUATION
 Peiping's Defense Minister
 Peng Te-huai issued a message
 on 25 October to Chinese "com-
 patriots" suggesting that for
 the time being,  the Chinese Com-
 munists intend to use political
 tactics toward their objective
 of gaining control of the off-
 shore islands.   Peng's message
 is, in effect, a declaration of
 a limited cease-fire which "fa-
 cilitates for a long time to
 come" the entrenchment of the
 Nationalists on the Chinmens.

 SECRET
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Peng implies that a "fat" gar-
 rison will be a better future
 prize than a "lean" one.
 Peng's order enables Pei-
 ping to claim that the Chinese
 Nationalist Government is able
 to maintain itself on the Chin-
 mens purely by Communist suf-
 ferance.   At the same time,  the
 Chinese Communists retain the
 flexibility to fire or not to
 fire without appearing to accept
 American proposals   for a de
 facto cease-fire and without
 incurring the risk of expanded
 hostilities or American involve-
 ment.   The limited cease-fire
 is "still conditional on not
 introducing American escorts."
 Peng thus continues  the
 regime's efforts to bring about
 the disengagement of the United
 States from any active military
 support of the ' Nationalists and
 to obtain a de facto Ameridan
 recognition of its
 claim to a 12-mile
 limit of its 'ter-
 ritorial waters. Since
 American destroyers
 modified their pat-
 tern of patrolling
 in the Matsu area on
 22 October, Peiping
 has not issued a "se-
 rious warning" against
 alleged American in-
 trusions.
 Chinese Commu-
 nist propaganda prior
 to 21 October, as
 well as Peng's ear-
 lier cease-fire orders
 of 6 and 12 October,
 pointed to "political
 work" as the prin-
 cipal method to be
 used in the campaign
 to take over the off-
 shore islands and Tai-
 wan.  Peng's latest
 message makes it clear
 that Peiping does not
 expect important gains in the
 immediate future.   He states,
 "We are not advising you to break
 with the Americans right away;
 that would be an unrealistic
 idea."  Peiping does expect, how-
 ever, a lowering of Nationalist
 morale, some grumbling against
 the Nationalist authorities, and
 even defections during a pro-
 longed period of pressure against
 the offshore islands and Taiwan.  25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 October 1958
 Communist Military Activity
 Communist artillery in the
 Amoy area has fired on the Chin-
 mens daily, with the exception
 of a 23-hour lull on 23 and 24
 October.   The firing has been
 relatively light and sporadic,
 however.   The 25 October order
 of Communist China's defense
 minister was clarified by  a
 Peiping announcement the next
 day declaring:   "Today happens
 to be an even date.   Our mili-
 tary units on the Fukien Front,
 strictly abiding by the order
 of the minister of national de-
 fense, did not bombard the air-
 fields on Chinmen or the wharf,
 beach, and ships at Liaolo Bay
 when they  shelled  Chinmen."
 This made it clear that the Com-
 munists did not intend to sus-
 pend all                  shelling  "on  even
 dates," but only to refrain from
 shelling those areas specifical-
 ly mentioned in the 25 October
 order.
 newspapers have asserted that
 the only way to deal with the
 Chinese Communists "id by means
 of force."  The papers  also
 emphasized that the Nationalist
 campaign to recover the China
 mainland "seeks to couple a war
 in the Taiwan Strait area with
 a revolution on the mainland."
 These comments probably were
 intended to offset any public
 impression that the government
 had weakened in its resolve to
 recover the China  mainland.
 Nationalist military of-
 ficials indicated to the press
 on 25 October that their gov-
 ernment has agreed  in  prin-
 ciple to an American request,
 made prior to the offshore is-
 land crisis, for a gradual one-
 third reduction in  the armed
 forces on the offshore  is-
 lands, with a corresponding
 increase in  firepower  through
 modernization.   This fact sug-
 gests Taipei could be moving
 toward decreasing the garrisons.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 PAKISTANI ARMY TAKE-OVER COMPLETED BY MIRZA OUSTER
 The ousting of President
 Mirza on 27 October by General
 Ayub consolidates Ayub's con-
 trol over Pakistan and makes it
 clear that the army is in sole
 command.   Ayub apparently sus-
 pected Mirza of political maneu-
 vering to enhance his own power
 at Ayub's expense.   Mirza has
 been flown under army escort to
 Quetta, near the Afghan border,
 from where he is to proceed to
 England.
 As the new President,  Ayub
 may be expected to continue
 Pakistan's cooperation with the
 West.   He showed special con-
 cern over neutralist political
 speeches before the 7 October
 take-over, and since then has
 arrested numerous leftist lead-
 ers in Pakistan.   His new gov-
 ernment, however, may attempt
 to improve relations with the
 Arab states.
 The army probably will be
 fully occupied with administer-
 ing the country.   The initial
 apprehensions in Kabul and New
 Delhi will probably dissipate,
 as military adventures are un-
 likely under Ayub, who has been
 a cautious military leader.
 Since 7 October, Pakistani agi-
 tation over the Kashmir issue
 has been shelved.
 President Ayub seems un-
 likely to relinquish power vol-
 untarily in the foreseeable
 future.   With his appointment
 of nonpolitical figures as min-
 isters in the new cabinet, all
 top political and administrative
 positions now are held by new
 personnel.   This will probably
 further discourage most party
 politicians, who presumably will
 continue to wait and  see for
 the time being. The public will
 probably not be offended by
 Mirza's departure.   He has no
 mass popularity, and his polit-
 ical strength has been declin-
 ing since late 1957.
 Vigorous prosecution of
 corruption has created an at-
 mosphere favorable for at least
 initial improvements in the na-
 tional economy.   Ayub has focused
 attention on the problems of land
 reform and refugee settlement as
 necessary first steps toward in-
 creased agricultural production
 and general economic development.
 The new regime may be able to
 introduce some reforms bringing
 relief to tenant farmers and
 hastening the distribution of
 newly irrigated land.  However,
 the army has already begun to
 discover its limitations in fram-
 ing sound economic policies.
 After certain initial successes,
 it will encounter the basic prob-
 lems inherent in the oountry's
 inadequate natural and person-
 nel resources.
 Ayub has made a strong ap-
 peal for East Pakistan's support.
 East Pakistan, however,  probably
 will chafe under an exclusively
 West Pakistani army regime and
 may erupt in open unrest if gov-
 ernment policies appear to favor
 West Pakistan.

 his demands on companies located
 in areas under rebel domination
 in an attempt to acquire sup-
 plies and cash to support his
 movement.
 During the two years since
 Castro landed in Oriente Prov-
 ince,  US companies have suf-
 fered losses, through sabotage
 and theft, estimated in excess
 of $2,000,000.   Castro has re-
 peatedly professed respect for
 US personnel and installations,
 but many companies have been
 approached' for sizable "con-
 tributions."  These demands are
 not limited to foreign companies;
 Cuban enterprises have been sub-
 jected to a growing number of
 rebel-imposed taxes.
 One company, the US Gov-
 ernment - owned, $95,000,000
 nickel installation at Nicaro,
 closed down following the evacu-
 ation of more than 50 US employ-
 ees and dependents on 24 Octo-
 ber because of the loss of admin-
 istrative personnel and a lack
 of supplies. American officials
 doubt that the Cuban Army can
 guarantee security in the area.
 The operations of the Texaco
 refinery near Santiago have been
 seriously curtailed by rebel in-
 terference, which has included
 the temporary kidnaping of two
 employees.   The company is con-
 sidering a shutdown if rebels
 persist in their blackmailing
 demands for cash or arms valued
 at several hundred thousand dol-
 lars.   Other US companies in
 Oriente have been su}ijected to
 varying degrees of harassment.
 Castro has announced his
 intention to continue disruptive
 actions through the electoral
 period, threatening to call a
 general strike--a strike called
 last April failed--and to paralyze
 transportation and communications
 throughout the island.   He has    25X1
 warned all Cubans to stay in-
 doors on election day.
 Marshal Sarit is going
 ahead with his plans to remold
 Thailand's political institu-
 .tions.   He is expected to an-
 nounce about 1 November the
 formation of a provisional cab-
 inet which will operate under
 an as-yet-unrevealed provisional
 constitution.   This regime will

 a new "permanent" constitution
 will be drafted and the ground
 prepared for election of a more
 amenable legislature.
 There are growing indica-
 tions that Sarit himself is to
 be premier in the provisional
 government, with the other major
 portfolios assigned to his col-
 leagues in the military group.
 The inclusion of the same mili-
 tary personnel who were in the
 former Thanom cabinet would point
 up the fact that Sarit's  "revo-
 lution" is only a partial one.
 Several of his military follow-
 ers are notoriously corrupt, and
 their activities were a contin-
 ual problem to Thanom.
 The new "permanent" con-
 stitution is expected to place
 severe limits on the powers of
 the legislature with a corre-
 sponding strengthening of execu-
 tive powers.   The articles be-
 ing considered include one pro-
 viding for exclusion of assem-
 bly members from the cabinet
 and another allowing dismissal
 of the cabinet without refer-
 ence to the assembly.  Mildly
 socialistic economic provisions
 reportedly will also be incor-
 porated at Sarit's personal in-
 sistence.
 The arrests of alleged Com-
 munists and other opposition
 elements are continuing but are
 apparently running behind the
 targets set by the police.   This
 suggests that many of those most
 vulnerable to charges of being
 Communists may have succeeded
 either in escaping the police
 net or in bribing the police to
 avoid arrest.  Twelve pro-Commu-
 nist or leftist newspapers are
 still closed down, and the police
 seem to be enforcing a previously
 imposed ban on the showing of So-
 viet and Chinese Communist films
 in Bangkok.
 The pro-Western Sudanese
 Government coalition,  led by
 Premier Abdullah Khalil's Umma
 party,  is facing renewed pres-
 sures from both the neutralist,
 pro-Egyptian National Unity
 party (NUP) and from the Suda-
 nese Communist party.  The con-
 troversial question of accepting
 American aid is the central
 issue, but the ruling coalition
 is also charged with corruption,
 unsuccessful economic policies,
 and "foolhardy" measures against
 labor.
 The NUP is the second
 largest party in the Sudan, with
 SUDANESE GOVERNMENT
 25 percent of the seats in Parlia-
 ment compared with the Umma
 party's 35 percent; its popular
 following is approximately as
 numerous as that of the Umma.
 In a situation where the votes
 of a number of deputies can be
 bought, the NUP, especially if
 it gets further financial aid
 from Egypt, has some prospect
 for gaining control of the gov-
 ernment in mid-November, when
 Parliament is scheduled to
 reconvene.
 The Communist party has no
 representation in Parliament and
 no great popular following, but

 it controls the leadership of
 the bulk of organized labor and
 has effective front groups among
 students and intellectuals. Al-'
 though the Sudan is essentially
 an agricultural country and the
 government runs most industry
 and transport, the trade union
 movement, with about 55,000 mem-
 bers, is in a powerful position.
 Some 21,000 of the union members
 belong to the Sudan Railway
 Workers' Union and some 17,000
 to unions affiliated with the
 Sudan Workers' Trade Union Fed-
 eration (SWTUF).   Both these
 organizations are Communist led,
 and a sustained strike by their
 workers could paralyze the Suda-
 nese economy.
 The government has attempt-
 ed to destroy the SWTUF,  first
 by setting up a rival trade fed-
 eration, the Sudanese Government
 Workers'  Trade Union, Federation,
 with only slight success, and
 then by passing legislation de-
 signed to make the SWTUF illegal.
 On the basis'of the new law,
 the government instituted an
 action this month against the
 SWTUF in the Sudanese courts,
 but failed to obtain a ruling
 outlawing the organization. The
 Communist party and the SWTUF
 responded on 21 October with a
 one-day strike and with worker
 and student demonstrations. The
 strike was effective throughout
 the country, particularly in
 the transport industry.   Most
 significant was the support of
 the demonstrations by the NUP.
 This support underlines
 the potential danger to the gov-
 ernment of parallel--but not
 necessarily coordinated--action
 by the NUP, operating principal-
 ly in Parliament and with po-
 litical maneuvers, and by the
 Communist party, undercutting
 the government through agita-
 tion,  demonstrations,   and
 strikes.  Government officials
 are reported to be seriously
 disturbed, and  Khalil  has
 threatened   strong  measures
 against "forces of anarchy."
 The Algerian rebel regime,
 which rejected French Premier
 de Gaulle's invitation to come
 to Paris to arrange a cease-
 fire, seems to be continuing
 to maneuver for his acceptance
 of the Algerian National Lib-
 eration Front (FLN) as the val-
 id spokesman for Algerian Mos-
 lems.   Paris has consistently
 refused such recognition, claim-
 ing the FLN represents no more
 than a small, rabid minority.
 While branding De Gaulle's
 offer of safe-conduct to "lead-
 ers of the rebellion" to come
 to Paris for talks a "request
 for unconditional surrender,"
 rebel "Premier" Abbas attempted
 to keep the door open by pro-
 posing negotiations on neutral
 ground for "a true solution of
 the Algerian problem in its en-
 tirety."  This position is in
 accord'with Abbas' 26 September
 statement which soft-pedaled     25X1
 demands for independence and     25X1
 expressed his regime's readiness
 to negotiate.

 fied acceptance which had been

 THE MILITARY BACKGROUND OF DE GAULLE'S NATO PROPOSALS
 French Premier de Gaulle's
 proposals for an American-Brit-
 ish-French "directorate" to co-
 ordinate global strategy  are
 not aimed solely at  enhancing
 French prestige, but appear to
 be based at least partially on
 French military thinking that
 the nature of  modern warfare
 demands new concepts for stem-
 ming Communist encroachments.
 French military leaders believe
 they have a "new weapon" in the
 form of perfected psychological-
 warfare techniques to supplement
 NATO and to cope with subversive
 warfare on a global scale.
 General Paul Ely, chief of
 staff of the French armed forces,
 has been a stabilizing pro-NATO
 influence in France. In the July
 1957 issue of the semiofficial
 Review of National Defense, he
 argued Mid  polarization of the
 world around the US and the USSR
 had  reeultedlin.' ale' -tinge- .
 defense problems, "even though

 flicts," to a global                                                                   plane.
 Ely delineated three axes along
 which Soviet pressure is  ex-
 erted:   (1) Europe;  (2) the
 Middle East, prolonged   into
 North  and  Black  Africa; and

 ideas and  calls for creation
 of an "African shield" patterned
 on NATO,  along the "Paris-Al-

 giers-Brazzaville  axis" and
 stronger regional defense  of
 Western interests in eastern
 Africa.
 Ely's views  apparently
 stem from  the French  Army's
 increasing emphasis on psycho-
 logical warfare  and                      action,
 which was stimulated by France's
 failure to retain   Indochina
 despite  overwhelming  conven-
 tional military superiority.
 He now seems  convinced that
 France is successfully applying
 in Algeria warfare  techniques
 superior to purely conventional
 military operations and appli-
 cable to most, if not all, areas
 of tension.   The   French have
 adapted  Chinese  Communist
 leader Mao Tse-tung's concepts
 of mass indoctrination and con-
 trol of native populations in
 countering Algerian rebel tac-
 tics.
 Recent French military lit-
 erature is replete  with argu-
 ments that France is "fighting
 NATO's battle" in North Africa
 and that the withdrawal of most
 French NATO units from Europe
 to Algeria in no way diminishes
 France's contribution to NATO.
 A recent article in the Review
 of National Defense quest o'i ns
 e outlook for European coun-
 tries in a NATO "which involves
 weakening them in the'inter-
 mediate zone" between  NATO's
 boundaries and the limits of
 the United States' widespread
 interests.
 The military services are
 reportedly re-examining French
 diplomatic and military prob-
 lems from the viewpoint  that
 American-Soviet nuclear parity
 has vitiated NATO's deterrent
 strategy.   The conclusion is
 that "the two  major- powers
 could no longer risk annihila-
 tion  to protect  allies  but
 would only retaliate with nu-
 clear weapons if attacked di-
 rectly themselves," and that
 "the only protection now for any
 country is its own thermonuclear
 devices."
 TENSIONS WITHIN THE PORTUGUESE ARMED FORCES
 Premier Salazar's regime,
 which since last spring's elec-
 tion campaign has encountered
 open opposition unprecedented
 in his 30-year  rule, now is-

 in the Portuguese armed forces

 dos Santos Costa.    The rival
 factions both seem loyal to
 Salazar, but may be maneuvering
 to strengthen their positions
 against the day when the 69-
 year-old prime minister retires.
 Shortly after the presi-
 dential inauguration in August,
 a major cabinet reshuffle
 dropped Santos Costa, presumably
 to eliminate friction between
 civilian and military components
 of the cabinet, and also prob-
 disturbances had kindled public
 discontent and made him, after
 Salazar, the principal target     25X1
 of the opposition.
 ably to quiet dissension in the
 army.   Santos Costa is ambitious
 and has been regarded as one of
 the most likely successors to
 Salazar.  He commands the per-
 sonal loyalty of many key of-
 ficers, but many junior officers
 resent his dictatorial methods,
 promotion policies, and efforts
 to inject the army into politics
 during the presidential election
 campaign last May.   Moreover,
 his vigorous measures to prevent
 a continuation of the campaign
 completely loyal to Salazar, and,
 except for Air Force General
 Humberto Delgado, the opposition
 presidential candidate in May,
 there are no indications of dis-
 loyalty to Salazar among high-
 ranking military officers.
 In view of rumors that
 Salazar intends to retire with-
 in a year, intrigues involving
 pro- and anti-Santos Costa fac-
 tions will probably be consider-
 ably influenced by the political
 fortunes of General Delgado,
 whose campaign for the presidency
 stirred up popular unrest that
 has since continued.  He has
 little military support for his
 political activities, but in the
 May electoral campaign he was
 unusually successful in uniting
 opponents of the regime, and
 his subsequent criticism of the
 government has led to rumors he
 would be arrested.   The extensive
 public discontent will probably
 encourage the military to take
 an active part in selecting and
 establishing Salazar's successor.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 October 1958
 Adenauer plans to continue his
 talks with Soviet Ambassador
 Smirnov, but he has publicized
 the USSR's negative  attitude
 in an effort to counteract the
 increasing tendency among Bun-
 destag members to accept the
 Soviet proposal for a four-
 power commission to negotiate
 a peace treaty with "the two
 Germaniesi. "
 Adenauer may also be con-
 cerned over East German press
 reports that 27 Bundestag mem-
 bers discussed reunification
 with East German representa-
 tives during the recent Bundes-
 tag session in Berlin.   He is
 therefore attempting to em-
 phasize continued Soviet in-
 transigence on East Germany
 and unification, while demon-
 strating his own willingness
 to explore all avenues with
 Moscow, including a meeting
 with Khrushchev.
 West German officials are
 not   particularly  concerned
 over the increasing coolness,
 pointing out that the most Bonn
 expects are occasional periods
 of improvement,  such as Miko-
 yan's visit last April.   Bonn
 is delaying the start of nego-
 tiations on cultural exchanges
 to see if the number of re-
 turning German repatriates in-
 creases after Bundestag rati-
 fication of the trade and re-
 patriation agreement.  Of about
 15,000 to 20,000 repatriates
 expected, less than 2,000 have
 returned since the agreement
 was signed.
 In order to satisfy grow-
 ing Bundestag pressure, the
 Foreign Ministry has prepared
 a conciliatory reply to the 18
 September Soviet note, which
 proposed a four-power commis-
 sion whose discussions would be
 limited to drafting a peace
 treaty.  Bonn's note will prob-
 ably ignore Soviet criticism
 of Bonn's NATO policy.   It
 will,  however,  attempt to keep
 alive West Germany's proposal
 for a commission on the entire
 question of German unity by
 !-noting'Soviet  "agreement in
 principle" to the idea of a
 four-power commission.
 Moscow's refusal to dis-
 cuss East Germany stems from
 fear that acknowledging a legit-
 imate West German interest in
 the subject would undercut its
 policy of achieving recognition
 of the "two Germanyes "  .Moscow
 continues to fall back.on its
 peace--treaty proposal as evi-
 dence of willingness to solve
 the German problem.

 below US output last year and
 near the lower limit of Khru-
 shchev's 1972 target of 100,-
 000,000 to 120,000,000 tons.
 Although serious problems exist,
 this ambitious goal could be
 met if the priority allocated
 the industry is increased and
 some success is achieved in im-
 porting equipment from the free
 world.  This and other goals
 recently mentioned in the press
 indicate that the iron and steel
 industry is expected to achieve
 larger rates of increase in
 1959-65 than have been accom-
 plished since 1955.  The 1965
 targets for crude iron ore also
 are only slightly below the
 lower limits of Khrushchev's
 1972 goals.
 The new petroleum goal of
 240,000,000 tons for 1965, men-
 tioned to Eric Johnston by Mik-
 oyan early this month,  is 10,-
 000,000 tons over previous in-
 dications and more than double
 the 1958 goal of 113,000,000
 tons.   If this new target is
 achieved, the industry will be

 goal of 350-400,000,000 tons
 envisaged by Khrushchev.
 The natural gas goal re-
 mains at the high level of ear-
 lier forecasts, and the electric-
 power goal is probably a refin-
 ment of an earlier, somewhat
 higher, rounded figure of 500
 billion kilowatt-hours.  Khru-
 shchev's recent decision to
 stress development of thermal
 power--which brings quicker re-
 turns--over the expansion of
 hydroelectric capacity may re-
 flect in part concern over at-
 tainment of such a level of
 production.  The Seven-Year Plan
 will call for a greatly in-
 creased output of trucks and
 buses by 1965, but it will sched-
 ule fewer passenger cars than
 did the original Sixth Five-
 Year Plan.

 ing other possibilities for a-

 become something of a crusade--
 like conquering the "new lands."
 "School children's brigades" of
 Stavropol Krai are reportedly
 already achieving better bar-
 vests than collective farms,
 and Khrushchev called for this
 patriotic example to be emulated
 elsewhere in agriculture and,
 by inference, in industry. In
 another effort to tighten the
 economy,  the diversion of in-
 vestment funds intended for in-
 dustry into "unessential con-
 struction"--swimming pools, cul-
 ture palaces, and private homes
 --has been exposed and penalized
 in recent months.
 The outlook for the con-
 sumer is one of gradual improve- 25X1
 ment in the major items of food ,
 housing, and clothing.
 (Prepared by ORR)
 Khrushchev, Agricultural
 Minitter Matskevich,  and lesser
 Soviet figures have indicated
 in recent statements that im-
 portant changes aimed at in-
 creasing the efficiency of the
 collective farms may be made
 soon, probably in early 1959 at
 the 21st party congress or at
 the third All-Union Collective
 Farmers' Congress.
 Payment of guaranteed
 monthly cash wages involving
 new performance norms has already
 been introduced experimentally
 on several collective farms,
 reportedly with favorable ef-
 fects on output and worker
 morale.   If adopted,  this new
 method of payment would be a
 further step toward converting
 collective farms from coopera-
 tive membership groups to or-
 dinary Soviet business enter-
 prises operating, like the
 state farms, on a profit-and-
 loss basis.   Recent decrees re-
 organizing machine tractor
 stations and establishing a
 single-price system for state
 procurement of agricultural
 products were earlier major
 steps in this direction.
 Matskevich recently said
 conditions now are ripe for
 such a move, and Khrushchev--
 speaking on a related subject--
 noted the time has come to set
 correct work norms in agricul-
 ture.   To deal with such mat-
 ters,  the farmers' congress
 will amend the collective-farm
 model charter established in
 1935 and may make collective
 farms similar in many respects
 to a state farm or factory.
 Modeling collective farms
 more closely after industrial
 enterprises would make it pos-
 sible to calculate agricultural
 production costs on a nation-
 wide basis for the first time in
 Soviet history.   It would also
 provide the state with additional
 means to exert pressure on the
 collective farms to cut costs
 and increase output.   The system
 might thus facilitate the trans-
 fer of labor from agriculture to
 industry.
 Other possible developments
 in the near future include a
 rapid increase in purchases by
 collective farms of the exten-
 sive livestock owned privately
 by individuals, and the estab-
 lishment of a collective-farm
 union.   Khrushchev's favorite
 farm, Kalinovka, has recently
 purchased all the privately
 owned livestock of its members.
 While Khrushchev has previously
 warned against a too rapid ex-
 tension of this procedure,  it
 may be sanctioned at the col-
 lective farmers' congress and
 spread rapidly.
 Establishment of a collec-
 tive-farm union has been dis-
 cussed in the Soviet press.
 Such a "union" has been suggested
 as an organization which could
 draw funds from the stronger
 farms to help the weaker.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Systematic improvement of
 collective farm villages ap-
 parently will be stressed in
 the future.   The farmers' con-
 gress is to examine "the urgent
 problems" of collective farm
 construction.   Part of Khru-
 shchev's controversial 1951
 speech on agrogorods--large im-
 proved collective-farm settle-
 ments--was reprinted in August
 in Izvestia--the part on the
 necessity_of further construc-
 tion on collective farms to im-
 prove the cultural and everyday
 conditions of life.   More re-
 cently, in Pradva, a collective-
 farm chairman stated the time
 had come for the advanced col-
 lectives to pose the question
 of radically reconstructing
 their villages on the basis of
 long-range architectural plans.
 Neither of these recent
 statements, however,  resurrects
 the controversial aspect of
 Khrushchev's speech,which cal.led
 for eliminating small villages
 and developing agrogorods.   Thus,
 if the question of establishing  25X1
 agrogorods is being reopened,  it
 is being done so cautiously.

 SOVIET DILEMMA OVER THE NOBEL PRIZES
 The awarding of Nobel
 prizes for literature to Rus-
 sian poet and novelist Boris
 Pasternak and for physics to
 atomic scientists P. A. Cheren-
 kov,            Igor E. Tamm, and I. M.
 Frank has posed the Soviet re-
 gime with the sharpest dilemma
 it has yet faced in its efforts
 to increase its respectability
 abroad while maintaining dis-
 cipline at home.   The overriding
 need to shelter the Soviet citi-
 zen from anti-Soviet attitudes
 has forced Moscow to denounce
 both the literary award and its
 recipient in an attempt to
 counteract the increase in popu-
 lar interest resulting from the
 first Nobel prize award for lit-
 erature to a Soviet writer.
 Pasternak's prestige in Soviet
 literary circles was already
 high,and most Soviet readers
 were aware of the existence of
 the book.'  The regime's deci-
 sion to permit acceptance of
 the coveted physics award was
 made only shortly after this
 denunciation of Pasternak.
 A letter signed by seven
 prominent members of the USSR
 Academy  of  Sciences  and
 published in Pravda on 29 Octo-
 ber made a shar-stinction
 between the "tendentious nature"
 of the Pasternak award, with
 its "specific reactionary po-
 litical aims" and the "fully
 deserved" physics award for
 work of "intrinsic scientific
 value."   Groundwork for such a
 distinction is laid in the Great
 Soviet Encyclopedia, which notes
 that Nobel prizes, especially
 in the fields of literature and
 work for peace, are "frequently
 connected with the political
 interests of reactionary cir-
 cles."
 The announcement on 23
 October of the award to Paster-
 nak,                                                               for his achievements in
 lyric poetry and in the field
 of the great Russian epic tra-
 dition for his first novel,
 Doctor Zhivago, evoked the
 sharpest Soviet press attack
 on a literary work since Stalin's
 death.  The members of the Nobel
 prize committee for literature
 were stigmatized by Pravda as
 "enemies of democracy"    d "ad-
 vocates of war," and the award
 was denounced by Literary Ga-
 zette as a "hostile political

 act directed against the Soviet
 state."  The novel was described
 as a political  lampoon to-
 tally without literary value,
 and its hero as a moral  mon-
 strosity and resurrected Judas.
 Pasternak himself was said to
 have "selected the, path of shame
 and dishonor" in joining those
 who are trying to stop the for-
 ward movement of Communism.   In
 an interview with a Western
 press correspondent in March,
 Pasternak spoke repeatedly of
 his sense of obligation  to
 "bear witness" as an artist and
 to provide a document of his
 age, regardless of the cost.
 Pasternak personally will go
 beyond stern words and the very
 real financial pressures which
 his expulsion on 27 October
 from the USSR Union of Writers
 will entail.   His first cable
 in response to the award, de-
 claring himself   "immensely
 thankful, touched, proud, as-
 tonished, abashed," was followed
 by a second  indicating his
 "voluntary" refusal  of  the
 award in view of "the meaning
 attributed to this award by the
 society in which I live."
 Mindful of the danger  of
 making him a martyr, Pravda
 ridiculed "silly rumors of per-
 secution," asserting that any
 West European or American writer
 might envy the life Pasternak
 lives, and Literary Gazette
 contented itself with consign-
 ing him to a fate of "popular
 disdain."
 How much "popular disdain"
 the press attacks will create
 among the Soviet reading public
 is debatable.   Official expres-
 $ions of disdain are not  even
 unanimous  within  the rest of
 the bloc.  Although most
 the European satellites

 Month-long efforts within
 the North Atlantic Council (NAC)
 to convene a conference of in-
 terested parties to the Cyprus
 dispute have collapsed with an-
 nouncement from Athens that the
 Greek Government would not at-
 tend such a conference.  The
 Greek decision to oppose a con-
 ference at this time apparently
 was largely inspired by the at-
 titude of Archbishop Makarios.
 Makarios, who had previously
 indicated his intention to at-
 tend the proposed conference as
 representative of the Greek
 Cypriot community, may have been
 influenced,  in turn, by the in-
 transigent wing of the Cypriot
 Ethnarchy.
 Officially, Athens has re-
 jected the conference idea be-
 cause of "juridical and pro-
 cedural" obstacles and because
 the results would be "disad-
 vantageous to Greek Cypriot in-
 terests."  Both government lead-
 ers and the press have pointed
 to what they regard as a lack
 of a "conference spirit" in the
 NAC discussion.  The Greeks and
 Makarios particularly emphasize
 that their recent renunciation
 of enosis has not been matched
 by comparable concessions by
 Ankara and London.  The Greeks
 are insisting on abandonment of
 partition as a final solution.
 In addition, Greek officials,
 despite assurances-.to the con-
 trary by NATO Secretary General
 Spaak, continue to believe that
 little attention at the confer-
 ence would be given to the ma-
 jor Greek interest in an ulti-
 mate solution for Cyprus.
 Britain and-Turkey, while
 insisting that the major atten-
 tion of the conference should be
 focused on the-British. seven-year
 interim plan for Cyprus, did ac-
 cept discussion of a final solu-
 tion as an item for the agenda.
 The wide divergence of views in
 Athens and Ankara concerning a
 final Cyprus solution,' however,
 makes it highly unlikely that a
 permanent solution could be
 worked out at any conference in
 the near future.  The sudden
 Greek rejection of the confer-
 ence idea will probably be fol-
 lowed by official explanations
 in London and Ankara, charging
 Greece with sole responsibility
 for failure to convene a Cyprus
 conference--a move which will
 further embitter Anglo-Greek
 and Greek-Turkish relations.
 NATO  Secretary- General
 Spaak is apparently attempting
 to keep alive the possibility of
 further NATO conciliatory ef-
 forts in the Cyprus dispute at
 some future date.  The major at-
 tention of the parties to the
 dispute, . however, will now switch
 to New York,?where the UN Gen-
 eral Assembly is scheduled to
 take up the Cyprus issue during
 its present session.  Greece
 will probably try principally
 to gain international support
 for an independent Cyprus.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 October 1958
 Criticism of policies of
 the Turkish Government and, in
 turn, the government's threats
 to curb the Republican People's
 party (RPP) are expected to be-
 come more intensive during the
 session of the Grand National
 Assembly which begins on 1 No-
 vember.
 Prime Minister Menderes'
 opponents may exploit the wide-
 spread discontent over economic
 conditions and the dissatisfac-
 tion over the government's con-
 duct of foreign affairs   and
 restrictions on individual free-
 doms.   Since Menderes' Democrat-
 ic party (DP) holds 415 of the
 610 legislative seats, the
 principal threat to the prime
 minister lies in discordant ele-
 ments within his-own party
 combining against him.
 Laws restricting the press,
 curtailing academic freedom, and
 limiting public political meet-
 ings have been strengthened dur-
 ing recent years.  The prime
 minister backed the use of force
 in a small town in north-central
 Turkey on 17 October where
 police clashed with supporters
 of the RPP who were seeking to
 welcome their party leader,
 Ismet Inonu..   Under Inonu's
 aggressive leadership, the RPP
 has vigorously attacked all these
 restrictive measures.  Menderes
 has responded to this criticism
 by alleging that the opposition
 is willing to resort to revo-
 lutionary methods to obtain power
 and by threatening to take stern
 measures to protect the country.

 years, the conduct of foreign

 policy probably will be a parti-
 san issue in the assembly; last
 summer the opposition sought a
 full debate on this issue in
 the special sessions of the
 legislature, but were given only
 a brief hearing.   While essen-
 tially pro-Western, the RPP
 sought political advantage by
 criticizing the Baghdad Pact
 and by demanding a review of
 arrangements under which the
 United States uses the facili-
 ties at Adana air base.
 Menderes' opponents can be
 expected to exploit widespread
 dissatisfaction over rising
 prices and shortages.   Since
 economic conditions may improve
 as the stabilization program
 made possible by foreign cred-
 its takes effect, they will
 probably highlight the present
 inflation and scarcity of goods
 during the coming session.
 Faced with criticism on
 these issues and with opposi-
 tion from within and outside
 his party, Menderes may carry
 out his threats to take meas-
 ures to restrain the RPP.
 JAPANESE POLICE LAW CONTROVERSY
 Growing popular opposition,
 led by the Socialists, to Prime
 Minister Kishi's effort to
 strengthen the powers of the
 Japanese police could weaken the
 political position of the con-
 servatives and undermine Kishi's
 control of the government party.
 Protest strikes by left-wing
 labor unions are planned for
 early November, and the use of
 force by the government to
 control the situation would
 strongly influence the public
 against Kishi.
 The controversial "Police
 Duties Execution Law" now before
 the Diet has been designed by
 Kishi to cope with the extreme
 tactics of leftist organizations
 --particularly those of the Gen-
 eral Council of Trade Unions
 (Sohyo), the Communist-dominated
 teachers' union (Nikkyoso), and
 the student federation (Zenga-
 kiiren).   The bill empowers the
 police to take into "protective
 custody'! individuals suspected
 of instigating disruptive
 demonstrations,such as sit-down
 strikes   in  government   build-
 ings.
 Police authority to take
 preventive action is the central
 issue; Kishi  insists  such
 power is necessary to maintain
 public order and safety, while
 the Socialists foresee a revival
 of pre-World War II restrictions
 on civil liberties.
 The Socialists have gained
 the support of large liberal
 groups in addition to the usual
 leftist organizations by exploit-
 ing the widespread popular
 sensitivity to excessive use of
 police powers arising from bitter
 prewar experiences. They already
 have strong press support.
 Kishi appears determined
 to secure passage of the law
 despite popular criticism.
 Finance Minister Sato, his
 brother, stated on 24 October
 that the government would use
 the defense forces to control
 any popular demonstrations.

 The Chinese Communists an-

 This move completes on schedule

 about 300,000 troops
 --to forward areas of
 North Korea within
 two weeks if rein-
 forcements should be
 required by the North
 Korean Army.
 The withdrawal
 plan was, first an-

 ary in a, joint state-

 and Kim I1-sung. On

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 It is probable that small
 detachments of communications,
 liaison, and logistics personnel
 will remain     in Korea for  at
 least a short time         to  take
 care of the final details of
 the withdrawal.  An-:,.,undeter-
 mined number of advisory person-
 nel may remain for an indefinite
 period.
 The location of most of the
 troops withdrawn  from North
 Korea is unknown,  but
 troops
 may
 have
 been
 sent
 to
 Southeast
 China.
 The redeployment
 of
 North
 Korean Army units to replace
 the withdrawn Chinese Communist
 armies has resulted in some loss
 of defensive depth in the  for-
 ward areas, with reserve divi-
 sions having greater areas of
 responsibility.   The 334,000-
 man North Korean Army is greatly
 outnumbered by the South Korean
 and the remaining UN  forces,
 which total about 589,000. This
 numerical disparity is offset
 to a considerable degree, how-
 ever, because the North Korean
 Army has developed a powerful
 artillery capability and pos-
 sesses an air force of at least
 535 jet fighters and about 100
 jet light bombers.   South Korea
 has only 98 jet fighters and
 no jet bombers.   In  addition,
 the Chinese Communist capabili-
 ty to re-enter Korea in force
 on short notice assures  the
 North Koreans of adequate mili-
 tary assistance                                                              if it  should
 be required.
 PROSPECTS FOR UN STAND-BY PEACE FORCE
 The idea of establishing
 a permanent UN stand-by peace
 force along the lines of the
 UN Emergency Force   (UNEF) cre-
 ated two years ago is likely
 to meet with considerable op-
 position when it is discussed
 by the General  Assembly  in
 early November.   The assembly
 probably will ask Secretary Gen-
 eral Hammarskjold to consult
 with member governments about
 such a force and report back to
 the next session.
 Hammarskjold, in a 10 Octo-
 ber report on the experience
 gained in operating the 5,000-
 man UNEF in Gaza, recommended
 that any UN police  force be
 recruited only on  an ad hoc
 basis after an emergency situa-
 tion has arisen.                   He suggested
 a paramilitary force which would
 not include troops from the five
 permanent members of the Securi-
 ty Council.   The force would be
 sent into a danger area only
 with the consent of the country
 involved and would strike only
 in self-defense.   The Security
 Council or the General Assembly
 would make the final decision
 to use the force; ultimate de-
 cisions on operations would be
 left to the secretary general.
 Hammarskjold was criticized
 by the USSR for supporting Ameri-
 can "imperialism" through US
 "Control" of a UN peace force.
 On 24 October,  a Soviet UN dele-
 gate-told the American delega-
 tion that the USSR  remained
 strongly opposed  to  any  UN
 force controlled by any organ
 other than the'Security Council,
 where  the USSR  has  a veto.
 Indian and Yugoslav opposition
 apparently stems in part from
 a long-held view that creation
 of a permanent UN peace force
 overemphasized  the  military
 aspects of the UN Charter. Both
 countries, however, have troops
 currently serving in the UNEF.
 Recent debates in the as-
 sembly's budget committee have
 revealed growing sentiment for

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30. October 1958
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 One of the most far-reach-
 ing social reorganizations of
 modern times is under way in
 Communist China, where  new
 social and economic organiza-
 tions called "people's communes"
 are being established.  Rural
 communes are formed by merging
 the older collective farms into
 larger units, a move in viola-
 tion of last fall's central
 committee resolution which pro-
 vided that the size of collec-
 tives should be limited and
 then fixed for ten years.   The
 prototype commune, called the
 "Sputnik," was formed last
 April, but it was not until
 July and August that Peiping
 began to give intensive pub-
 licity to the subject.
 The leadership's motives
 for pushing the drive almost
 certainly include economic ones
 --to increase production  and
 limit consumption--as well as
 political and sociological ones,
 to  enhance, party control and
 foster a "new_ way of life."
 Peiping argues that the commune
 is better suited to meet pres-
 ent demands for more manpower
 and investment capital and for
 the communalization of daily
 living.
 The politburo resolution
 in late August advised against
 "undue haste" in forming com-
 munes but, only a month later,
 over 90 percent of the nation's
 farm households had reportedly
 been enrolled.   Some 750,000
 collectives are said to have
 been merged into 23,384  com
 munes, and Peiping observes
 that the speed and scope of the
 movement has exceeded that of
 the "high tide" of cooperativiza-
 tion in late 1955.
 Description
 The commune controls not
 only agriculture, but industrial,
 commercial, cultural, and mil-
 itary affairs as well.   Although
 the People's Daily has noted a
 "tendency" to link communes into
 "federations" within  county
 boundaries or to embrace en-
 tire counties, the present com-
 mune is in general equal in
 size to a township, and as such
 is  much larger than the collec-
 tives it  replaces.  The struc-
 ture of the township government
 and the commune administration
 is  identical--they have the
 same chief, the same party sec-
 retary, and the same people's
 congress, and the people's
 council of the township is the
 administrative committee of the
 commune.
 Under this committee are
 the various commissions--plan-
 ning, technology, and supervi-
 sion are usually included--and
 departments--covering such
 fields as agriculture, commerce,
 finance, education, and mili-
 tary affairs--which actually
 run the commune.   Under these
 in turn are the various produc-
 tion teams for industry and
 agriculture, which in many
 cases are the old collectives
 under a new name.
 Once organized, the commune
 generally takes over all property,
 common funds, and reserves of
 the collective   and some of
 the liabilities.  The commune
 strikes at the remaining vestiges
 of private property by absorb-
 ing privately held plots, or-
 chards, and some domestic ani-
 mals.
 Early communes began,by ,
 paying members on a "wage-plus-
 reward" system.  This was a
 striking innovation, replacing
 the twice-yearly-payments in
 kind to collective members cal-
 culated on the basis of work-
 days valued as a portion of col-
 lective income.   The commune

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 member gets a straight monthly
 wage in cash.      Wage earners in
 the commune are classified for
 pay purposes into a number of
 categories based on physical
 power, technique, intensity of
 work, and "work attitude."
 Bonuses are distributed--usual-
 ly to only 40-60 percent of the
 members--on the basis of such
 criteria as "progressive think-
 ing, work enthusiasm, obedience,
 love of public property, and
 struggle against evil persons."
 Those lacking these traits get
 no share in some 20-25 percent
 of the commune's wages.
 More recently,  the trend
 has been toward the "gradual"
 adoption of a "wage-plus-supply"
 system, under which      members
 are provided, in addition to a
 wage,    "free" staples like rice
 or wheat.   Chairman Mao has
 encouraged the spread of this
 system, suggesting that it need
 not stop at basic foodstuffs,
 but might be broadened to in-
 clude other necessities such as
 clothing.   Some communes have
 gone so far as to include lux-
 uries in the supply system,
 probably on the grounds that
 the leadership can easily sup-
 press "inappropriate desires."
 Peiping has indicated that the
 supply aspects of the system
 are based on the Marxist prin-
 ciple "to each according to his
 needs."
 Under either system, the
 commune member will perhaps
 recognize one hang-over from
 the past--the fact that the in-
 terests of the state come first.
 Peiping does not hide the fact
 that it expects better mobiliza-
 tion of rural capital through
 the communes.  Their size will
 permit the accumulation of a
 larger capital fund   in one
 place.   Insofar as production
 is increased and consumption re-
 duced,  the rate of capital for-
 mation will be increased.   Some
 early communes have   reported
 marked success in this respect.
 The Sputnik Commune estimates
 that 30 percent of its income
 this year will be channeled
 into its public fund.   This
 compares with a national aver-
 age  of around 20-22 percent.
 In the communes, rural
 supply and marketing coopera-
 tives become departments which,
 under the leadership of state
 commercial departments, buy
 and sell for the commune and
 set up branch sales--and pre-
 sumably purchasing--centers
 throughout the commune.   Old
 credit cooperatives become cred-
 it departments.   Under the pro-
 fessional leadership of the
 state bank, they accept deposits
 from members, regulate  the
 floating capital of the commune,
 extend loans to production teams
 on behalf of the state bank,
 and settle noncash accounts with
 other communes.
 The authorities in Pei-
 ping have not yet come to grips
 with all the financial problems
 this rural reorganization will
 bring.   The first notable pub-
 lic commentary on this aspect
 of the communes was in a "letter"
 from the finance minister to
 the theoretical journal Red Flag.
 He noted that the communes w1ll
 inevitably bring a decrease in
 commodity exchange, and that
 the present tax structure, which
 leans heavily on revenues ex-
 tracted from this exchange, is
 no longer "suitable."  He of-
 fered no solution in his letter.
 However, the Sputnik Commune
 says it has taken over the re-
 sponsibility of paying an "over-
 all tax" to the state, including
 taxes on agriculture, industry,
 and trade.   It has also assumed
 responsibility for delivering
 agricultural products to the
 state in accordance with regula-
 tions.
 The communes'will help
 further the regime's demands
 for fuller and better use of
 rural labor, both men and women.

 Labor will be organized along
 military lines and will tackle
 its tasks as an "army fights a
 battle."  With its centralized
 control of the township's labor
 force, the commune can plan
 larger projects than were pos-
 sible under the old system and
 marshal the labor force nec-
 essary to carry them out.   It
 will be possible to shift labor
 more freely between agriculture
 and industry.
 "New Way of Life"
 The social changes the_icom-
 munes bring to Chinese village
 life will,  in the long run,
 probably far outweigh the eco-
 nomic.   Plainly,  the leaders
 in Peiping intend to create
 what Red Flag has called a "new
 way o?-Ti?-e"-through the or-
 ganization of communal mess
 balls, housing, nurseries,
 schools, and other "amenities."
 Communal mess halls have
 so far received more stress
 than other aspects of the new
 life.   Peiping has pointed out
 that not only do they help re-
 strict "excess" consumption--
 one mess hall entirely elimi-
 nated "excess" consumption three
 days after it opened--but also
 they free the housewife to work
 in field or factory.   By speed-
 ing up the eating process, they
 permit the workers to spend
 more time on the job; one com-
 mune reported that each person
 put in three extra hours a day
 in the fields after its mess
 hall opened.   Finally, polit-
 ical cadres and activists have
 noted the advantage of having'
 the whole production unit as-
 sembled in one place to receive
 "instructions and explanations."
 Party Secretary General
 Teng Hsiao-ping has publicly
 stated the regime's intention
 eventually to relocate all
 housing.   "Residential areas in
 rural regions," he said, "will
 come to look like beautiful
 cities."   The regime has al-
 ready begun what may be a slow
 process of tearing down old
 houses and using the materials
 to build large, barracks-like
 dwellings which will be home
 to the communalized Chinese
 peasant.   This aspect, together
 with the communal mess halls,
 will bring him a highly cellular
 existence.   He will be inex-
 tricably tied to his particular
 production unit, and will work,
 sleep, eat, study, and relax
 with his co-workers.   There
 will be no place to hide.
 The regime has suggested
 that the breakup of the tradi-
 tional Chinese family is a.
 primary objective of the com-
 munal system, which seems well
 designed to achieve this.  Wages
 are being paid directly to the
 individual wage earner rather
 than to the head of the house-
 hold.   Husband and wife may be
 separated by work assignments
 in distant parts of the commune.
 Children are in communal nurs-
 eries or schools, and the re-
 gime has strongly indicated its
 preference that these should
 be run as full-time boarding
 installations.
 At one school operated in
 this manner, it is said that
 the children "no longer think
 about their homes."  Even when
 the family is  reunited,, it
 will most likely be at a com-
 munal meal, in a communal bar-
 racks, or at a communal meet-
 ing.  This destruction of the
 old patriarchal Chinese family
 will not come easy for the Com-
 munists, especially in South
 China, where the family and the
 family goods are especially
 well entrenched, and Peiping
 admits that the family probably
 will exist for a "long time."
 Measures such as these
 seem designed also to facilitate.
 the total regimentation of all
 Chinese behind the regime's
 programs and their complete sub-
 mission to its authority.  There
 will be a further extension of
 an already pervasive  politer,
 ical  control:   An  ithportant

 instrumentality of this will
 be the commune's militia, only
 a small and rigidly select part
 of which will be armed.        It
 will serve as the state's in-
 ternal security police in rural
 areas.
 An ancillary effect will
 possibly be a drop in the rate
 of population growth, which
 last year reached 2.5 percent.
 The brake which these social
 factors put on population growth
 will be in addition to what-
 ever can be achieved through
 birth control techniques such
 as contraception, abortion,
 and sterilization.
 Dispersion
 The Chinese Communists
 have frequently suggested that
 in the event of a wholesale
 nuclear war the country with
 the greatest and most widespread
 population will stand the best
 chance for survival as a nation-
 al unit.   Both Mao Tse-tung and
 Chu Te have spoken of the need
 to have "relatively complete
 industrial systems" providing
 diversified goods in various
 parts of the country.  The com-
 mune will emerge as an almost
 self-contained unit with  its
 own administration, agriculture,
 industry, education, and mili-
 tary system.  These units might
 well reduce the vulnerability
 of the local control structure
 and permit it to continue even
 when cut off from central au-
 thority.
 Recent statements by top
 leaders make it plain that
 cities and industrial regions
 are expected to follow the ex-
 ample of their rural cousins.
 Some months ago, the press cited
 instances of the formation of
 urban collectives to release
 women from the "burden" of
 housework for work in mills and
 factories.   Communal kitchens
 and nurseries followed.   Then,
 in September, Chairman Mao di-
 rected that large plants like
 the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works
 should gradually turn themselves
 into integrated enterprises
 which turn out a variety of in-
 dustrial goods and embrace agri-
 culture, exchange, culture, and
 military affairs.
 Teng Hsiao-ping, while on
 a recent tour in the northeast,
 listened to reports on experi-
 mental work being done there on
 urban communes.   Applauding the
 idea, he encouraged the city
 of Ssuping--about 140,000--to
 go ahead with the organization
 of such a city-wide commune.
 More recently the People's
 Daily, commenting that the old
 social life in cities, factories,
 and mining districts is "in-
 compatible" with current needs,
 approved the "growing pressure"
 for the establishment of urban
 communes.   It called attention
 to the "readjustment" of work-
 ers' housing at a coal mining
 site in Shansi, where the hous-
 ing has been reallocated on the
 basis of production teams and
 their accompanying party and
 administrative superstructure.
 Widespread adoption of this
 step, the daily argued, will
 "drastically improve" the re-
 lations between the leaders and
 the masses, free workers' de-
 pendents of "burdensome" house-
 work, rid the teams of "unde-
 sirable characters," and lead
 to rapid production increases.
 Such a step, the daily con-
 cluded, must be taken "sooner
 or later."
 Some non-Communist observ-
 ers: have reported that Chinese
 peasants are "cheerfully" ac-
 cepting communal life--not an
 entirely unexpected development
 at this early stage in the pro-
 gram.   Conditioned to submitting
 to the will of the state by a
 harsh series of "counterrevolu-
 tionary" campaigns during the
 first years of the regime, the
 populace was further prepared

 for communalization by the re-
 cently concluded "rectification"
 campaign of 1957-58.   However,
 there have been hints in the
 Communist press that the program
 has met with some resistance.
 Obviously a number of very
 pressing problems will follow
 from this far-reaching social
 reorganization.   Some have al-
 ready begun to crop up, includ-
 ing a problem which has plagued
 --but not prevented--earlier
 reforms introduced by Peiping.
 This is the perennial problem
 of the comparatively well-to-do
 peasant.
 Like the collective system
 before it, the commune in effect
 penalizes the more efficient
 producers by taking all but a
 bare minimum away from him. In
 the case of communes, the prob-
 lem is magnified since now it
 is entire villages or coopera-
 tives which have to sustain the
 less efficient ones.   It is
 questionable how long Peiping
 can go on penalizing its better
 farmers without destroying their
 incentive to excel.
 The system certainly con-
 centrates tremendous power over
 details of daily life in the
 hands of a few.   Cases of re-
 sentment have already arisen in
 the assignment of work grades
 and wages.    The loss of pri-
 vate plots, orchards, livestock,
 fowl, and other holdings, as
 well as of house and home will
 of course not please everyone.
 The degrading of the peasant
 from the status of part-owner
 to hired hand will not be pop-
 ular,   nor will the introduction
 of an almost monastic way of
 live, with hard work, little
 food, strict military discipline,
 and only two days off a month.
 On the other hand, most
 peasants may be willing to ac-
 cept communal living   for the
 time being.   Accustomed as they
 are to very little, they may
 welcome the security of guar-
 anteed food,                    shelter, and cloth-
 ing, as well as provisions for
 medical care, education, and
 entertainment.   It is probably
 the breakup of the family sys-
 tem that will become the crucial
 issue for the Communists.
 Economically, it is doubt-
 ful that the mere reorganization
 will of itself have any great
 effect on agricultural output.
 It will bring greater intensity
 of labor, but the regime has
 certainly heavily exploited
 this aspect in the past.   Bene-
 fits will accrue from the bet-
 ter maneuverability of labor
 in the communes and the larger
 capital funds made possible by
 the size of the commune.   Some
 assistance can be expected in
 the furthering of advanced farm-
 ing techniques, but large-scale
 farming will still have to wait
 for Chinese industry to produce
 the needed machinery.
 Small-scale industry, which
 the communes  will  in  many
 cases be taking over, is expected
 to add significantly to nation-
 al output--more so in quantity
 than in quality--but this is
 the fruit of another program.
 The full burden of the com-
 munal status will probably be
 felt only after some years. The
 communes constitute Mao Tse-
 tung's greatest gamble, and
 there seems at least a possibil-
 ity that this time he has asked
 more of the human material than
 it can stand, and that there
 will eventually be an explosion.
 International Significance
 Peiping is claiming that
 communes will provide China
 with a good form of organization
 to speed up socialist construc-
 tion and the transition to Com-
 munism.   Such statements seem
 to imply that Peiping, while
 still engaged in "building so-
 cialism,'' is already taking
 steps along the road to Commu-
 nism and is thus approaching
 the status of the Soviet Union.
 In general, Peiping gives the

 impression that the advance to
 Communism is a long-range goal,
 stating, for instance, in the
 authoritative Red Flag that it
 is not approprTte to "strain"
 to advance from socialism to
 its higher phase.   At times,
 though, Peiping has sought to
 give the impression that, the
 "transition to Communism" is
 much nearer.
 The Chinese Communists are
 presenting Mao Tse-tung's con-
 cept of the commune as a crea-
 tive development of Marx and
 Engels, citing specifically the
 last two points of the Commu-
 nist Manifesto:   "combine agri-
 culture and industry and facili-
 tate the gradual elimination of
 distinction between town and
 country"; and "combine educa-

 the climax of their intensive

 years to make this the central
 issue in the East-West disarma-

 faces the severest test of its
 pose as the world's principal
 advocate of halting nuclear

 sive proposals, therefore, have
 been aimed at increasing pres-
 sure on the West to accept an
 unconditional test ban by ap-
 pearing to meet Western objec-
 tions to the USSR's terms.
 In view of this pattern of
 Soviet policy, the Soviet nego-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 October 1958
 The Russians probably will
 press for an immediate "politi-
 cal decision" on an uncondition-
 al and permanent test ban, while
 insisting that elaboration of
 an inspection system--a Western
 condition for agreement--can be
 discussed subsequently.   While
 the Soviet delegates probably
 will be prepared to discuss con-
 trols, they will seek to mini-
 mize and defer this problem by
 pointing out that the Geneva
 technical experts already have
 unanimously agreed that a con-
 trol system is "possible and
 feasible."
 The USSR's reaction to the
 Anglo-American announcement of
 22 August and its proposals for
 a test-cessation agreement sug-
 gest that the Soviet leaders
 continue to believe they have
 more to gain by constantly seek-
 ing to make the West appear re-
 sponsible for blocking a test-
 cessation agreement than by as-
 suming the far-reaching commit-
 ments involved in a test ban en-
 forced by a control system ac-
 ceptable to Washington and Lon-
 don.   This line of action re-
 flects Moscow's basic estimate
 that the nuclear stalemate will
 continue indefinitely and that
 the psychological aspects will
 dominate the East-West struggle.
 In this situation,  the
 USSR's fundamental aim. is to
 stigmatize nuclear weapons by
 all the diplomatic and propa-
 ganda means at its disposal,
 thereby inhibiting the West's
 willingness to use them, but
 without sacrificing Soviet free-
 dom of action by accepting the
 restraints that would be imposed
 by an effective control system.
 Soviet Policy Since 1957
 Moscow's maneuvers over the
 past year to force a clear-cut
 Showdown with the West on the
 issue of a test ban separate
 from all other aspects of dis-
 armament have centered on under-
 cutting the West's contention
 that Soviet opposition to effec-
 tive controls is the principal
 barrier to a termination of
 tests.   The USSR's proposal in
 the London talks on 14 June 1957
 for a two- to three-year sus-
 pension under international con-
 trol was the initial attack on
 what Moscow regarded as the most
 vulnerable point in Western po-
 sition.
 Before introducing this
 ostensible concession, however,
 the Russians had carefully probed
 the firmness of the United States
 position, which held that a
 test ban could not be separated
 from other aspects of the nu-
 clear problem.   The American
 delegate at the talks stated
 that the United States would
 not agree to a temporary cessa-
 tion except as part of an agree-
 ment including a commitment to
 a cutoff date on the production
 of fissionable material for nu-
 clear weapons.   This apparently
 convinced the Soviet leaders
 that the Western powers would
 not accept any formula for an
 unconditional ban.
 In his 31 March 1958 speech
 to the Supreme Soviet, Foreign
 Minister Gromyko stated that
 the USSR's proposal--for a two-
 to three-year suspension enforced
 by an international commission
 with control posts in the USSR,
 the United States, Britain, and
 the Pacific area, including Aus-
 tralia--was intended "to pre-
 vent the opponents of a cessa-
 tion of tests from subterfuges."
 He declared that after the West
 had rejected this proposal,  "it
 became clear... that this was
 not at all a matter of control
 but of stubborn unwillingness
 of certain circles of the West-
 ern powers to limit the nuclear
 arms race."
 USSR's Unilateral Suspension
 The unilateral suspension
 of Soviet tests decreed by the
 Supreme Soviet on 31 March 1958
 was the boldest stroke in Mos-
 cow's long campaign to force
 the Western powers to take an

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 unequivocal stand on the test-
 ban issue and to arouse world-
 wide resentment toward American
 and British nuclear policies.
 This move was timed to place
 the forthcoming Western tests
 in the worst possible propaganda
 light. The Soviet leaders took
 a calculated risk that-they
 could unilaterally suspend tests
 for some time without incurring
 serious military or technologi-
 cal disadvantages.   They rea-
 soned they would be free to re-
 sume testing at a date of their
 choosing because the United
 States and Britain would not
 counter with proposals which
 would call the Soviet bluff.
 The Supreme Soviet deci-
 sion carefully paved the way
 for a resumption of Soviet test-
 ing by stipulating that should
 the United States and Britain
 continue:: their tests, the USSR
 would "act freely in the ques-
 tion of testing-bearing-in
 mind the interests of the se
 curity of the Soviet Union."
 The next move in the Soviet
 campaign to heighten pressures
 on the West to take an unequivo-
 cal stand on an unconditional
 test ban was Khrushchev's ac-
 ceptance on 9 May 1958 of Presi-
 dent Eisenhower's earlier pro-
 posals for technical talks on
 methods of detecting violations
 of a possible test-cessation
 agreement.   This step consti-
 tuted a marked departure from
 the USSR's previous insistence
 that all negotiations on inter-
 national control of any aspect
 of disarmament could come only
 after agreements had been con-
 cluded in principle.
 This reversal of position
 was partly motivated by the need
 to offset the damaging effects
 of Moscow's abortive charges of
 US nuclear bomber flights over
 the Arctic toward Soviet fron-
 tiers.   Moscow had called an
 emergency meeting of the UN Se-
 curity Council in which the So-
 viet charge backfired badly,
 and the Soviet delegate was ma-
 neuvered into having to veto
 an American proposal for an in-
 ternational inspection zone in
 the Arctic to prevent surprise
 attack.
 During the exchange of
 notes between Moscow and Wash-
 ington on plans for the techni-
 cal talks, the USSR sought in-
 creasingly to extract from the
 United States at least a tacit
 commitment that the talks must
 lead to an agreement to end
 tests.   The Soviet note of 13
 June attempted to establish a
 link between the technical dis-
 cussions and a decision to end
 tests by stating that the USSR
 "proceeds from the assumption...
 that as a result (of the quick
 conclusion of the talks) agree-
 ment will be reached on the sus-
 pension of nuclear weapons tests
 by all powers possessing-~them."
 On 25 June, Moscow sent a
 further note which charged that,
 by failing to agree that the
 talks must result in a test ban,
 the United States was "dooming
 the conference to failure be-
 forehand,"  The note implied a
 threat to boycott the meeting
 unless the United States "con-
 firmed" that the talks "must
 be subordinated" to the task
 of achieving a test-cessation
 agreement.
 This overnight reversal:,
 which may have resulted from
 Khrushchev's personal interven-
 tion, wat an attempt to wring
 from the United States a last-
 minute acceptance of the prin-
 ciple of an unconditional test
 ban,  or failing that,  to delay
 the talks and thereby generate
 new pressures on Washington to
 change its position.    But the
 USSR backed down and sent its
 delegation to Geneva after the
 United States had reaffirmed
 its position and had announced
 that the American scientists
 were proceeding as scheduled.
 It soon became apparent
 that the USSR wanted the talks

 to succeed and was making con-
 siderable concessions to achieve
 this end.   The American chair-
 man of the Western delegation
 observed on 25 July that, in
 every important case, the So-
 viet bloc delegates had accept-
 ed the major elements of the
 Western position, agreeing to
 points which the Western scien-
 tists did not believe at the
 outset they would accept.
 These unusually concilia-
 tory tactics were governed by
 Moscow's expectation that an
 agreement on test-cessation
 methods would create heavy pres-
 sure on the West to accept a
 separate and. unconditional test
 ban.   The  Russians believed
 that any Western failure to fol-
 low through on a technical agree-
 ment would place the United
 States and Britain in an ex-
 tremely difficult position and
 appear to confirm Soviet charges
 that Western insistence on con-
 trol was merely a means of evad-
 ing a test ban.
 Subsequent statements by
 Soviet leaders strongly suggest
 that the concessions at Geneva,
 like Moscow's proposal of June
 1957 for control posts to en-
 force a two- to three-year test
 suspension, were aimed at fur-
 ther discrediting the Western
 claim that the USSR was respon-
 sible for failure to reach agree-
 ment because of its opposition
 to an effective control system.
 Khrushchev declared on 30 Au-
 gust that the Geneva agreement
 had "finally buried the legend
 about the alleged impossibility
 of control over the observance
 of an agreement to end nuclear
 tests."  He underscored the
 USSR's acceptance of the Geneva
 recommendations and  stated,
 "There can now be no-excuses
 or justifications for refusing
 to end at once and everywhere
 the experiments with nuclear
 weapons."
 US-UK Suspension
 The announcement by the
 United States and Britain on
 22 August 1958 of a conditional
 one-year suspension of testing
 seems to have caught the Soviet
 leaders off balance.   They im-
 mediately recognized this as a
 major challenge to their strate-
 gy.   The  Western initiative
 greatly complicated Moscow's
 plans for exploiting the Geneva
 technical agreement to embarrass
 Washington and London.
 Khrushchev's reply came
 on 30 August in a Pravda inter-
 view in which he sought to dis-
 credit the announcement as just
 "another attempt to lull the
 vigilance of the people showing
 legitimate concern at the con-
 tinuing nuclear tests carried
 out by the United States and
 Britain on an ever larger scale."
 He insisted that the announce-
 ment did not really change the
 Western position and that Wash-
 ington and London "are still
 looking for loopholes to avoid
 an instant suspension of tests."
 He dismissed the proposal to
 stop testing for, one year as of
 "no importance whatsoever, for
 a year is precisely the period
 necessary for preparing another
 series of nuclear tests."
 As for the Western propos-
 al to extend the suspension
 one year at a time,Khrushchev
 charged that the United States
 and Britain "hedge this agree-
 ment with such reservations and
 conditions that it becomes clear
 they have no real intention of
 renouncing further tests of nu-
 clear weapons."
 Khrushchev then moved to
 bolster the Soviet position for
 a major showdown in the negotia-
 tions which the United States
 and Britain proposed for 31 Oc-
 tober.   His most immediate con-
 cern was to counter any impres-
 sion that their tests last sum-
 mer had given the Western pow-
 ers a commanding lead in the
 nuclear race.   His great sensi-
 tivity on this point was reflect-,

 advantages for themselves."
 After recalling that the Supreme
 Soviet decision of 31 March had
 stipulated that if the other
 powers continued their tests,
 the USSR would be "free to act
 as it sees fit," Khrushchev de-
 clared that the Western tests
 "relieve the Soviet Union of
 the obligation it had assumed
 unilaterally."
 Test Resumption
 On 11 September, Moscow
 announced that Northern Sea ma-
 neuvers would be held from 20
 September to 25 October,  "with
 actual use of various types of
 modern weapons." Soviet propa-
 gandists poured out a growing
 stream of arguments designed to
 explain and justify the forth-
 coming test resumption.   Gro-
 myko sought to offset the ad-
 verse effects of the new tests
 by calling on the UN General As-
 sembly on 16 September to en-
 dorse a "universal cessation"
 of tests "for all time."
 On 1 October,  the day after
 the USSR resumed testing, Mos-
 cow sent notes to the United
 States and Britain proposing
 that the Geneva conference be
 held at the foreign ministers'
 level--a move timed to create
 the impression of a new Soviet
 "initiative" and to demonstrate
 the importance   the  .USSR  at-
 taches to these talks.   Gromyko's
 7 October press conference state-
 ment that the Soviet Union "has
 all grounds to discontinue its
 tests only after it conducts
 the same number of such tests
 as were held by the United States
 and Britain" since 31 March was
 intended to underscore the ra-
 tionale for resuming tests.  Depu-
 ty Foreign Minister Zorin on 27
 October reiterated Gromyko's
 stand in rejecting the Western
 proposal for  a  gone-year  ban'
 and  reserved:  the  right   to
 match  the                    number  of  Western
 tests since   31  March if the
 Geneva talks fail.
 Moscow's negotiating tac-
 tics probably will be to make
 its demand for an immediate,
 permanent, and unconditional
 test cessation the key issue.
 The Soviet delegate will con-
 tend that the first order of
 business must be to conclude a
 definitive "political" agreement
 on test cessation.   He probably
 will take the position that the
 Geneva technical talks have
 demonstrated the feasibility of
 an effective control system and
 that therefore there should be
 no difficulty in spelling out
 such details as the nature of
 the supervisory body, the compo-
 sition   of  inspection   teams,
 location of control posts, and
 the immunities and privileges
 of inspection personnel after
 the basic political agreement
 has been signed.
 In his 30 August Pravda
 interview, Khrushchev defined
 the purpose of the conference
 as being "to conclude an agree-
 ment to end for all time tests
 of atomic and hydrogen weapons
 of all kinds by all states."
 He made no mention of the con-
 trol problem, dismissing its
 importance with the statement:
 "Considering the positive re-
 sults of the Geneva conference
 of experts,,  these negotiations
 could be brought to a conclusion
 within two or three weeks."
 If in the course of the
 Geneva conference the Soviet
 leaders conclude that the United
 States and Britain will not
 abandon their position making
 the extension of a one-year sus-
 pension contingent on installa-
 tion of an effective control
 system and "satisfactory progress"
 toward agreement on such meas-
 ures as limitation and reduction
 of fissionable material for
 weapons purposes, they may drop
 their demand for a "permanent"
 cessation and reintroduce the

 ternational control.
 Prevention of Surprise Attack
 The USSR apparently will
 seek to establish a close link
 between the technical talks on
 measures to prevent surprise
 attack--scheduled to open in
 Geneva on 10 November--and the
 conference on nuclear-test ces-
 sation.   Soviet notes have
 stressed that any agreement on
 surprise attack must be made
 contingent on "definite steps"
 in the disarmament field, par-
 ticularly a test-cessation
 agreement.   Moscow's note of 15
 September explicitly rejected
 the American view that surprise-
 attack talks should take place
 without prejudice to the posi-
 tions of the two governments
 on the timing and interdepend-
 ence of the various aspects of
 disarmament.  The fact that the
 test-cessation conference will
 open just ten days before the
 surprise-attack talks in the
 same city will facilitate So-
 viet efforts to underline the
 close relationship between
 these questions.
 Moscow's acceptance on 2
 July of President Eisenhower's
 earlier proposals for technical
 talks on the surprise-attack
 problem probably was motivated
 primarily by the need to over-
 come the adverse effects of
 the abortive Soviet charges
 against alleged Arctic flights
 of American nuclear bombers
 and the executions of the lead-
 ers of the Hungarian revolt
 announced in mid-June.   Khru-
 shchev's letter took the line
 that the surprise-attack prob-
 lem had become "especially
 acute" because of the bomber
 flights.
 Soviet tactics at the con-
 ference probably will be cen-
 tered on repeating previous
 Soviet schemes calling for the
 establishment of control posts
 at railway junctions, large
 ports, and highways, and re-
 ciprocal aerial inspection in
 "zones of concentration of
 military forces" in central Eu-
 rope and in equal portions of the
 Soviet Far last and the western
 United States.  Soviet'negotia-
 tors can also be expected to
 stress that solution of the
 surprise-attack problem is bound
 up with the settlement of other
 questions, such as renunciation
 of the use of nuclear weapons
 and missiles, creatlbx of. _a atom-
 free zone in Europe, a nonag-
 gression pact between NATO and
 Warsaw Pact members, abolition
 of foreign bases, and reduction
 of foreign forces in Germany
 and  other  European  states.

 THE ASWAN HIGH DAM AND THE NILE WATERS QUESTION
 Soviet Premier Khrushchev's
 offer to lend the UAR the equiv-
 alent of up to $100,000,000 to-
 ward construction of the first
 stage of the Aswan High Dam
 should enable Cairo to make a
 substantial start on the proj-
 ect--the  estimated total cost
 of which exceeds $1.3 billion.
 The idea of the Aswan High Dam
 --officially known as the Sadd
 al-Aali project--as a major
 economic scheme designed to
 provide at least a partial solu-
 tion to Egypt's economic prob-
 lems has long been a key point
 of President Nasir's domestic
 policy.

 SECRET
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Earlier attempts to begin
 construction have faced two ma-
 jor difficulties.                  The magni-
 tude of the project precludes
 its construction from wholly
 Egyptian resources and requires
 foreign aid or credit of up to
 $400,000,000.  An earlier fi-
 nancing offer involving a $200,-
 000,000 loan from the World
 Bank and a $70,000,000 grant
 from the United States and Brit-
 ain was withdrawn in July 1956.
 Subsequent Egyptian claims that
 Suez Canal revenues would en-
 able the country to begin con-
 struction were largely propa-
 ganda.
 A second major block has
 been the lack of an agreement
 between Egypt and the other
 seven riparian powers, espe-
 cially the Sudan,  on a division
 of the Nile waters to be stored
 by the dam.  The numerous Egyp-
 tian-Sudanese  conferences on
 this question have all ended
 without agreement, and the is-
 sue has become a political
 football.  Cairo has accused
 Sudanese Prime Minister Khalil
 of using the issue for politi-
 cal gain--which he has,  since
 it is the one issue which unites
 all Sudanese elements, even the
 most pro-UAR,  against what they
 believe to be excessive Egyp-
 tian demands.  Cairo also is
 using the Sudan's refusal to
 renegotiate the 1929 Nile Waters
 Agreement as a device to go
 ahead with new works without
 Khartoum's consent.
 Khartoum, with some mis-
 givings,  has agreed in princi-
 ple to the Sadd al-Aali project,
 but not to the Egyptian plan
 for sharing the surplus water;
 it attaches a distribution plan
 of its own as a condition to
 acceptance of actual construc-
 tion.   The absence of a riparian
 agreement has been an effective
 bar to international financing
 of works on the Nile both in
 Egypt and the Sudan, but the
 lack of such an agreement may
 not halt the bloc's willingness
 to implement its offer.

 The bitter disputes which
 are likely to occur should Egypt
 begin construction without a
 division-of-waters agreement
 might work to Moscow's advantage
 by pitting the Kremlin-supported
 Cairo regime, which in turn could
 probably be assured of general
 Arab League approval, against a
 Western-supported "recalcitrant"
 Sudan.  President Nasir recent-
 ly stated that Egypt intended
 to go ahead with the dam regard-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Development, the Aswan High Dam
 project is technically sound
 and on completion--16 years for
 the entire project and 10 years
 for the dam itself--would in-
 crease Egypt's irrigated area
 by 1,349,400 acres--from 6,-
 383,700 to 7,733,100--and con-
 vert to perennial irrigation
 the 695,460 acres of land nor-
 mally  irrigated  by  flooding.
 The ultimate result, according
 to Egyptian estimates, would
 be an increase in agricultural
 income of about 45 percent.
 Initially, the dam would also
 supply about 720,000 kilowatts
 of power--almost double this
 amount later--which is about
 45 percent more than the present
 total Egyptian electric genera-
 tion.   Even if the dam is con-
 structed,   however,   and  all
 planned benefits realized, it
 would do little more than to
 enable Egypt to maintain its
 extremely low standard of living.
 Sudanese agreement to con-
 struction would appear essen-
 tial, since the reservoir created
 by the dam would extend 342
 miles upriver)-- including 125
 Miles into the Sudan.   This
 flooding would.displace-an esti-
 mated 50,000 Sudanese now living
 in the Wadi Halfa district.
 Moscow's $100,000,000 loan
 offer--payable in 12 years at
 2.5 percent, probably beginning
 in  four  years--is  not  large
 compared with the original West-
 ern proposal of $270,000,000,
 including an outright grant of
 $70,000,000.  Nevertheless, it
 will allow Egypt to make sub-
 stantial progress on construct-
 ing the dam itself.   The imme-
 diate gain for the USSR will be
 the prestige it acquires in the
 Arab world for making a start
 on the project possible.
 The $1.3 billion estimated
 in 1955 to be the total cost of
 the project now,is probably in-
 adequate, since world prices of
 the necessary imported materi-
 als, as well as the local Egyp-
 tian costs, have been steadily
 rising.   Egypt's ability to fi-
 nance the local costs has also
 deteriorated.  Deficit financ-
 ing by the present regime has
 raised the government's indebt-
 edness about 180 percent, from
 $266,000,000 at the beginning

 Nile Waters Question
 In the conflict between
 Egypt and the Sudan  over  the
 disposition of the waters of
 the Nile, Cairo claims rights
 to a greater portion of water
 than Khartoum is willing to
 acknowledge and wants a pro-
 portionately larger share of
 any surplus resulting from the
 construction of new works on
 the river.   The Sudan is not
 immediately in need of more
 water, but desires a final de-
 termination of the share each
 nation is to receive before any
 new construction begins in or-
 der to forestall Egypt's de
 facto acquisition of additional
 water rights.   The dispute has
 worsened in recent weeks, with
 Khartoum refusing to be bound
 by the 1929 agreement and Cairo
 planning to go ahead with new
 works without agreement from
 the Sudan.
 Egypt's Position
 Egypt insists that the av-
 erage flow of water past Aswan
 is only 80 billion cubic meters
 a year rather than 84 billion
 as claimed by the Sudan.  A
 conservative estimate of the
 average flow is 83 billion.
 Egypt also claims 51 bil-
 lion cubic meters in existing
 water rights,  3 billion cubic
 meters more than Khartoum ac-
 cepts.  Based on the amount of
 irrigated
 land,
 at
 8,000
 cubic
 meters per
 year
 per
 acre,
 the
 figure would be 48.21 billion.
 Neither country disagrees with
 the Sudan's existing rights of
 some 4 billion cubic meters.
 Egypt's claim to an even-
 tual total of 62 billion cubic
 meters would be more than ad-
 equate for all irrigation pur-
 poses.   If the maximum amount--
 7,785,000 acres--of land in
 Egypt were irrigated, approxi-
 mately 58.25 billion  cubic
 meters of water would be re-
 quired.  The Sudan is willing

 The Sudan's Position
 Sudanese  engineers                                     say
 that 5,500,000 acres of land
 are suitable for immediate de-
 velopment:   3,000,000 with a
 gravity irrigation system in
 the Gezira between the White
 Nile and the Blue Nile south of
 Khartoum;  1,500,000 acres with
 pump irrigation systems on the
 Niles; 500,000 to be watered
 from the Atbara River; and 500,-
 000 to be watered from the pro-
 posed Jonglei Canal.   The Su-
 dan claims the right to irri-
 gate this area at the same rate
 as Egypt--8,000 cubic meters of
 water an acre per year.   The
 total figure the Sudan wants
 would thus be 44 billion cubic
 meters, the equivalent, because
 of evaporation loss, of 35 bil-
 lion cubic meters at Aswan.
 In defense of its position,
 Khartoum cites a study made by
 an American engineer, H. L.
 Cory, which was published by
 the Egyptian Government in 1920.
 Cory would have given 61 bil-
 lion cubic meters to Egypt and

 a capacity of 130 billion cubic
 meters.  Its primary purpose
 would be to store water for ir-
 rigation.  Secondarily, it
 would protect Egypt's downstream
 areas from flood and provide
 improved navigation conditions.
 The dam itself would take
 at least ten years to build.
 The reservoir would store 70
 billion cubic meters for irri-
 gation and 30 billion for flood
 control.  The other 30 billion
 cubic meters would be allowed
 for silting.
 The advantages of this
 project to Egypt would depend
 on the share of the water Cairo
 would receive under its agree-
 ment with the Sudan.   If Egypt's
 share were significantly less
 than 61 billion cubic meters,
 the project might not be worth
 the large investment required.
 It is on this point that dis-
 cussions with the Sudan were
 broken off in mid-1955,  when
 Khartoum refused to acknowledge
 Egypt's right to this amount.
 Comprehensive Storage Scheme
 This plan calls for a
 series of dams and barrages to
 be built largely in the Sudan.
 The bulk of the long-term stor-
 age of irrigation waters, how-
 ever, would be in Lake Albert
 and Lake Victoria.  By raising
 the water level of Lake Albert
 one meter, and Lake Victoria
 four feet, the amount of stored
 water would be equal to 105.3
 billion cubic meters, some 35
 billion cubic meters more than
 the expected capacity for irri-
 gation storage of the high dam.
 Because of the large swamps
 through which the water from
 these lakes now passes,. how-
 ever, the water loss through
 absorption is substantial--on
 the average about 50 percent.
 To avoid this, a diversion
 canal--the Jonglei Canal--
 would have to be built.   In
 addition, a number of regulat-
 ing barrages would be required,
 as well as a dam at Lake Tana
 in Ethiopia.
 The Aswan High Dam and the
 comprehensive storage scheme
 might be made complementary.
 The high dam could be somewhat
 smaller than now planned,and'
 other works could be undertaken
 in the Sudan.
 Without the Aswan High
 Dam, or a similar project, the
 growth of the Egyptian economy
 is likely to lag far behind the
 probable increase in population.
 This would mean a steady decline
 in the standard of living, with
 serious implications for the
 future social and political evo-
 lution of Egypt.  Even though
 Aswan or similar works might
 not make possible any signifi-
 cant per capita rise in the liv-
 ing standard, they would at least
 prevent a  disastrous  deteriora-
 tion in this standard.               25X1

 ANNEX
 SINO-SOVIET BLOC ACTIVITIES IN MAINLAND SOUTHEAST ASIA
 1.   General "Bloc Policy:
 The Sino- ovie  bloc is ac ive-
 ly working to encourage neutral-
 ism in Southeast Asia,  to de-
 stroy the Southeast Asia Treaty
 Organization, and to encourage
 the creation of a group of in-
 dependent, nationalist anti-
 Western entities which might
 ultimately come under close Sino
 Soviet influence.
 2.   Bloc policy has been
 flexible and opportunistic,, ad-
 justing itself to the degree of
 anti-Communism evident in each
 state.   Peiping and Moscow have
 avoided pressing too urgently
 and have sought to influence by
 example the states in which con-
 ditions have been most favorable
 to them.   Thus in Cambodia and
 in Burma--at least up to the
 change in government--where bloc
 activity has been most pronounced,"
 Moscow and Peiping have attempt-
 ed to be circumspect and have
 tried to fulfill economic aid
 agreements smoothly and satis-
 factorily.
 3.   The bloc continues to
 stand on a professed plank of
 noninterference in the internal
 affairs of other states embodied
 in the "Five Principles" enunci-
 ated by Chou En-lai and Nehru
 in 1954.   Chou repeated his "ad-
 vice" to Cambodia's Chinese to
 "refrain from taking part in po-
 litical activities" during the
 August visit of Cambodia's Prince:
 Sihanouk to Peiping.
 4.   The immediate aim of
 local Communist parties is two-
 fold--to achieve legality and
 eventually to turn their govern-
 ments' policies into neutralist
 channels. The USSR and Communist
 China complement that aim by
 discreet and frequent offers of
 "disinterested"economic aid and
 wider cultural relations.
 5.   Diplomatic Activity:
 Repeated bloc Initiatives to
 expand diplomatic representa-
 tion met with success in Cam-
 bodia and there is prospect of
 similar results in Laos.   Cam-
 bodia, which already has resi-
 dent missions from the USSR and
 Czechoslovakia, recognized Com-
 munist China in July,and ambas-
 sadors have been exchanged. This
 is a significant diplomatic
 victory for Peiping in South-
 east Asia and will considerably
 raise Communist China's prestige
 among the Overseas Chinese in
 the area.   Laotian officials
 revealed in July that Laos will
 probably send an ambassador to
 Moscow by.the end of 1958,thus
 ending a long period of stalling
 by Vientiane since an exchange
 was agreed on in principle in
 late 1956.   Malayan Prime Minis-
 ter Abdul Rahman continues his
 policy of refusing any formal
 relations with the bloc until
 the ten-year Communist rebellion
 in Malaya is ended.
 6.   Burma has the broadest
 bloc representation, having re-
 lations with the USSR, Commu-
 nist China, Poland, Czechoslo-
 vakia,  Rumania, and Mongolia.
 In Thailand, only the USSR main-
 tains a mission,which, with some
 50 officials, is considerably
 overstaffed in-terms of the work
 at hand.   Except for some 25
 Polish officials on the Interna-
 tional Control Commission, there
 are no bloc officials in South
 Vietnam.
 7.   Economic Activity: Ma-
 laya, with its large Chingse
 population, continues to be a
 focus for Communist China's com-
 mercial drive in Southeast Asia,
 and the over-all level of its
 trade with the bloc continues
 to rise.   From December 1957 to
 May 1958, Malayan exports to the
 bloc increased by 42 percent
 over the first half of 1957 and
 totaled about $43,000,000.   Ma-
 layan imports from the bloc
 dropped 5 percent to $30,000,000.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 30 October 1958
 The marked increase in exports
 was caused by a doubling of rub-
 ber exports to 75,800 long tons
 --15 percent of Malaya's total
 rubber exports for the first
 half of 1958.   Communist China
 was once again the principal
 bloc purchaser.   Peiping is com-
 peting with Japan and Hong Kong
 and has intensified its trade
 promotion activities in Singa-
 pore since April.   A wide va-
 riety of new Chinese commodities
 are appearing At prices slashed
 10-20 percent below those of
 normal suppliers. The effec-
 tiveness of this campaign is
 reflected in a 40-percent rise
 in the value of Chinese Commu-
 nist goods imported during the
 first seven months of 1958 over
 the comparable period in 1957.
 8.   Cambodia made its first
 import allocations in April un-
 der trade agreements with the
 USSR, Czechoslovakia,and Commu-
 nist China.   The value of ex-
 port licenses issued was much
 lower than the level set for
 imports.   However, the alloca-
 tions totaled about $2,600,000
 and, if actually used, would
 raise imports from the bloc in
 1958 to at least 10 percent of
 Cambodia's planned imports,  ex-
 clusive of those under aid pro-
 grams.
 9.   The level of bloc trade
 with Thailand continues to be less
 than one percent of total trade
 because of the relatively satis-
 factory economic conditions in
 Thailand, its pro-West align-
 ment, and extensive American
 aid.   Thailand refused Soviet
 formal trade overtures in March,
 but did lift its embargo on rub-
 ber exports to Communist China
 and North Korea on 22 August.
 An undetermined amount of il-
 legal trade with Chinese.Commu-
 nists is transacted through Hong
 Kong.   Burmese trade with the
 bloc continues to decline, and
 rice commitments to the bloc in
 1958 have been cut back to 40,-
 000 tons.   Total trade declined
 in 1957 to $57,500,000, or 11
 percent of Burma's foreign trade.
 Bloc trade with Laos and South
 Vietnam remains negligible.
 10.   In the field of econom-
 ic aid, bloc activities are con-
 centrated on Burma and Cambodia.
 Cambodia is now in the second
 phase of a $22,400,000 Chinese
 Communist grant-in-aid program,
 which appears to be proceeding
 smoothly.   Phnom Penh has com-
 pleted plans for various social
 and economic projects,and sites
 have been selected for the four
 plywood, cement, paper, and tex-
 tile factories that form the
 core of the program.   At the
 end of Sihanouk's Peiping visit,
 Cambodia accepted an additional
 grant of $5,600,000, and Peiping
 offered to expand the program
 to include construction of small
 iron and steel works and surveys
 of underground fuel resources.
 In addition, a Cambodian econom-
 ic delegation to-the USSR, head..
 ad by the economic  planning
 counselor,.completed preliminary.
 economic and technical aid talks
 in September.   Construction is
 now under way on the Soviet
 "gift" hospital in Phnom Penh,
 and Cambodia has included in
 its 1958 import plan $1,000,000
 worth of aid-financed goods to
 raise funds to defray local costs.
 11.   Bloc countries, prin-
 cipally the USSR, have extended
 an estimated $41,600,000 in loans
 to Burma.   Implementation of So-
 viet "gift" projects appears to
 be progressing satisfactorily,
 and construction has begun on
 the technological institute in
 Rangoon,  a plow factory,  and
 irrigation. works. Two Soviet.-loans
 totaling approximately $8,500,-
 000 were announced in early 1958
 but have not yet been implement-
 ed.   Communist China completed
 expansion of a government-owned
 textile factory during the first
 half of 1958.
 12. There were approximate-
 ly 140 bloc technicians in Burma
 in the first half of 1958 and
 the number of Soviet technicians
 will undoubtedly increase mark-
 edly as .work  on  the Rangoon

 Technological Institute        pro-
 gresses.  In Cambodia, there were
 about 30 bloc technicians,mostl
 from Communist China; additional
 Soviet and Chinese technicians
 are expected.
 13. Cultural and Propaganda
 Activities:   Peiping increase
 its   urmese-language broadcasts
 3.5 hours to a total of 10.5
 hours a week, and Moscow will
 increase its Burmese broadcasts
 from 3.5 to 7 hours weekly on
 15 October.   Peiping also in-
 creased its Vietnamese broad-
 casts twice during the period
 of this report to a total of
 about 16 hours a week.   Radio
 Hanoi increased its broadcasts
 to 13 hours weekly, adding a
 new daily program called "The
 Link Between North and South."
 14.   Bloc propaganda activi-
 ties have been especially marked
 in Cambodia, where Communist
 China,  the USSR, and North Viet-
 nam have all' made rapid progress
 in the film field.   During the
 first nine months of 1958., over
 50 Soviet films appeared as com-
 pared with a total of 15 to 20
 during all of 1957.   A number
 of Chinese technicians have ar-
 rived in Phnom Penh to install
 the 20-kw. radio transmitter
 presented to Sihanouk last year.
 The bloc's propaganda efforts
 within Cambodia have been aimed
 primarily at youth through the
 educational system, and Soviet
 diplomatic personnel have con-
 tinued to make aggressive ef-
 forts along this line.
 15.   Subversive Activity:
 Bloc officials in the area have
 usually concentrated on develop-
 ing correct cordial relations
 with constituted authorities.
 Covert contacts, however, are
 maintained through embassies
 and through Chinese Communist -
 controlled banks in places such
 as Burma and Singapore.   The
 banks provide legitimate finan-
 cial support to pro-Peiping ad-
 herents and are also a means of
 psychological and economic pres-
 sure on the population.
 ,   16.  Communist China exploits
 eXtensively pro-Peiping elements
 within overseas Chinese communi-
 ties throughout the area. Cultur-
 ally,; these groups are to a large
 extent resident aliens regard-
 less of formal citizenship and
 they are drawn toward the "home-
 land" regardless of politics.
 17.   In Thailand,,-South Viet-
 nam, Malaya, and Singapore, the
 Communist parties are outlawed
 and for the most part fragmented.
 Although aid may have been given
 from time to time to insurrec-
 tionary forces, both the bloc
 and local Communists generally
 would prefer legality to dontin-
 ued illegal and guerrilla activ-
 ity.   Bloc subversive efforts
 have been aimed primarily at,
 stimulating existing discontent
 among non-Communists.
 18.  The developing politi-
 cal situation in Laos, where
 the Communist-dominated Neo Lao
 Hak Zat  (NLHZ) won 13 of the 21
 assembly seats up for election
 last May, has shown the Commu-
 nists to be successful in using
 legal and semilegal tactics.
 The NLHZ appears to be making
 strong gains in almost every
 sector of Laotian society,in-
 cluding a swell of pro-NLHZ sen-
 timent among Laos' 13,000 Bud-
 dhist monks who have some influ-
 ence over village opinion.   The
 NLHZ also appears to be making
 some headway in penetrating the
 army and eroding government au-
 thority in the provinces.      Some
 locally elected officials in
 rural areas are reported to be
 resigning under NLHZ pressure.
 19.   Reaction to Bloc Ac-
 tivities:    nera  y spea  ng,
 the governments of the area are
 preoccupied with and somewhat
 fearful about resurgent Commu-
 nist.China's rapid rise from
 "semicolonial" status to econom-
 ic and military stature as a
 great power.   There'is also a
 great deal of respect for Chi-
 na's economic achievement. Local
 opinion tends to separate the
 Russians as outlanders,   and,

 except for localized incidents,
 the pattern of::?Sovibt'activity
 does not evoke a sense of threat
 comparable to that of Communist
 China.
 20.   Some resentment against
 Communist China has been evi-
 denced in Burma over the pro-
 tracted Chinese border dispute,
 and in Burma and Malaya over
 bloc efforts on behalf of oppo-
 sition parties or dissidents.
 Singapore and Malaya are both
 irritated by Russian tin dumping
 on the world market and by Chi
 nese Communist textile dumping.
 On 1 October, Singapore and Ma-
 laya restricted imports of Chi-
 nese textiles.
 21.   Outlook:   The Sino-So-
 viet bloc's fluid and opportu-
 nistic . approach, within the frame-
 work of a policy of developing
 wider contacts and relations on
 all levels with the nations of
 the area, will probably continue.
 The development of sentiment
 that is initially neutralist,
 independent, and nationalist
 will remain the general bloc
 aim.   Communist China and the
 USSR will probably bend every
 effort to developing a smooth
 implementation of the economic
 relationship with Cambodia as
 ence.
 a demonstration of what neutrali-
 ty can bring.   Normalization of
 relations with Communist China
 should lead to an increase in
 Communist activity in Cambodia.
 In Laos, the present trend is
 toward a steadily growing Com-
 munist influence and possibly
 ultimate Communist control. The
 bloc is likely to make little
 progress in South Vietnam un-
 less political unrest should
 develop and disturb the tenure
 of President Diem.   President
 Diem is now anticipating a sharp
 upsurge in Communist guerrilla
 activity and terrorism in South
 Vietnam.   Thailand and Malaya
 will probably continue to pur-
 sue policies of minimal rela-
 tions with the bloc, although
 in the former there are a few
 indications of a softening to-
 ward the bloc.   The trend to-
 ward the left in Burma has been
 abruptly terminated by the ac-
 cession of General Ne Win and,
 for the duration of his premier-
 ship, Communist influence should
 diminish.   Communist China's
 economic offensive in Malaya and
 its appeal to the large Chinese
 minority there--38 percent of
 the population--will probably
 result in an increase of unof-
 ficial Chinese Communist influ-
