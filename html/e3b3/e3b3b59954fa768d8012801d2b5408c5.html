 LEBANON:  Situation Report
 Syrian officials held further discussions in Damascus
 I  is wee end with Lebanese and other Arab emissaries. The on-
 going talks are intended to facilitate the transfer of power
 to Lebanese president-elect Sarkis on September 23 and to pre-
 pare for an Arab summit on Lebanon that is scheduled for late
 October.
 I              Lebanese Prime Minister Karami arrived in Damascus
 yesterday, presumably to learn Syria's views of his future role
 once Sarkis is inaugurated.  Retention of Karami as prime minis-
 ter would be strongly opposed by right-wing Christian leaders
 such as President Franjiyah and Interior Minister Shamun.
 I              Although the Syrians probably would prefer that Ka-
 on, they may not want to risk undermining efforts by
 Sarkis to secure the cooperation of the more extreme Christian
 leaders.
 I            IKarami is also likely to discuss Muslim views on how
 to reso ve the Lebanese crisis. He is a prominent leader of the
 National Unity Front,  a grouping of traditional Muslim and
 Christian leaders formed last June to strengthen the hand of
 old-line Lebanese politicians in future peace negotiations.
 Arab League mediator Hassan Sabri a7,-Khuli, who was
 expected to return to Beirut on Saturday, remained in Damascus
 until yesterday.
 I Various press reports have speculated that al-Khuli
 Lnrurn= from consultations in Cairo with new proposals to end
 the fighting when Sarkis takes office. His immediate concern,
 however, probably is preventing further attacks by the various
 warring factions against Arab League troops stationed in Leba-
 non.
 Other Arab envoys were in Damascus this weekend to
 iscuss preparations for the Arab summit on Lebanon.  Tunisian
 Foreign Minister Chatti,  the current chairman of the Arab League
 Council, conferred with Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam on
 Saturday; yesterday, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud held
 talks with Syrian President Asad.

 suburbs and in central and northern Lebanon
 JAPAN: Political Compromise
 Prime Minister Miki and his opponents in the ruling
 Liberal Democratic Party averted a showdown Saturday when the
 cabinet agreed to convene an extraordinary Diet session this
 Thursday.
 I              The decision followed a day of intensive bargaining
 which resulted in a three-point compromise.  It essentially in-
 volves:
 --Miki's appearance before a party caucus tomorrow, at
 which the Prime Minister will publicly pledge not to dis-
 solve the Diet precipitously and call a general election.
 --Convening the Diet on Thursday to pass a number of
 pending fiscal bills.

 Approved For
 --Calling a special party convention in October at which
 Miki almost certainly will be removed as party president.
 Both sides gave ground in working out the compromise.
 ici won his opponent's agreement to drop their demand for his
 resignation prior to the opening of the Diet.
 I           To do so, he apparently threatened Saturday to re-
 place                     e dissenting Cabinet ministers with his own loyalists,
 convene the Diet, and then dissolve it and call elections if
 the impasse continued. His opponents clearly preferred to make
 some concessions to the Prime Minister rather than provoke an
 open party split.
 Even so,  the compromise has significantly limited
 1 i s room for maneuver by requiring him to publicly state
 that he will not suddenly dissolve the Diet and call general
 elections. Miki's rivals will certainly publicize his pledge
 tomorrow to help ensure against any dissolution before the
 convention is held.
 I           I  Meanwhile--as another part of the deal--Miki is re-
 portedly preparing to reshuffle cabinet and party posts, possib-
 ly sometime this week.
 I              Notwithstanding the party's attention to legislative
 business, Miki's respite is likely to be brief. His opponents
 will almost certainly press for rapid action on the pending
 bills,  and with elections now only three months away,  for hold-
 ing the party convention--and replacing Miki--earlier rather
 than later next month.
 I              n another weekend development, the Soviets seized
 three small Japanese fishing boats off the disputed, Soviet-held
 islands near Hokkaido. Although such seizures are routine,  the
 Japanese press is noting that these took place at about the
 same time that Foreign Minister Miyazawa was on an inspection
 cruise near the islands.
 AAngolan President Agostinho Neto appears to have made
 gains in   is power struggle with radical groups within the rul-
 ing Popular Movement.

 In the months immediately following the Popular Move-
 men   s military victory, Neto and other mulatto political
 leaders have been restricted in their efforts to establish na-
 tional policies by black radicals within the party's military
 hierarchy. Flushed with victory and backed by the Cuban and So-
 viet presence, these radical military leaders opposed broad-
 ening Angola's economic and political ties, reconciling with
 former rivals, and establishing a multiracial state.
 I       I Neto is on record in favor of nonalignment and a
 mu  iracial state.                                      he also favors a

 Lisbon. He apparently hopes that ties with Portugal will help
 build bridges to other Western European countries and facili-
 tate Angola's admission to the United Nations.
 I             Portuguese Socialist Party officials who recently
 visited   uanda--at Neto's invitation--came away with the im-
 pression that Neto's political strength and personal self-
 confidence are growing.
 I             Since the end of the civil war, Angola has been al-
 most   o ally dependent on Cuban and Soviet assistance. The Cu-
 bans are helping government counterinsurgency operations, re-
 building transportation facilities, providing social services,
 and training the Angolan army. The Soviets have provided some
 military advisers and civilian technical assistants.
 Angola's economy needs Western technology and markets,
 however,  if it is to revive quickly. The country's lucrative

 operations.
 Efforts by Neto to put some distance between his gov-
 ernment                        and Moscow and Havana will not go unchallenged by the
 military radicals of the Popular Movement who owe their strength
 to Communist assistance.
 CHINA:  Mourning Ceremonies
 All active members of the Chinese Politburo,  includ-
 ing those based in the provinces, have stood vigil over the
 body of Mao Tse-tung in the official mourning ceremonies that
 began Saturday. The leaders were listed in order of political
 rank, revealing no changes thus far in the pecking order.
 The official news agency made special mention of a
 wreath from Mao's wife, Chiang Ching,  signed also by other
 members of his family. The wreath was given pride of place be-
 side the bier. Despite her general lack of political popularity,
 Chiang Ching will evidently be accorded all the honors due the
 widow of the chairman,  at least during the mourning period.
 Leaders from 15 of China's 21 provinces have also
 been present during the lying-in-state ceremonies, including
 several province chiefs linked to the ousted Teng Hsiao-ping
 who have appeared infrequently. Missing from the group, however,
 are three government officials also associated with Teng.
 Peking has published condolence messages from 10
 provinces and from five of China's 11 military regions. The
 most important of these during the succession period is the
 Peking Military Region, which sent a long message pledging
 loyalty to the party Central Committee.

 CHILE:    Anniversary
 The Pinochet government, which marked its third anni-
 versary on Saturday,  shows no signs of moderating its tough in-
 ternal security practices or making any substantial concessions
 in the area of human rights.
 In his anniversary speech, President Pinochet reiter-
 ated the regime's hard-line views and indicated that new decrees
 would soon be issued further restricting political activity.
 The crackdown is aimed at the Christian Democrats and the church--
 the government's principal domestic critics.
 The junta's promulgation of several acts to be in-
 cluded in a new constitution apparently will institutionalize
 the authoritarian practices now being followed. The expansive
 guarantees of human rights promised by Pinochet at the OAS meet-
 ing in Santiago last June are still largely being ignored by
 the security forces. The Interior Ministry has announced that
 205 political prisoners were being released, but the state-of-
 siege has been extended for another six months.
 I        I Pinochet gave no hint on Saturday that changes in
 economic policies are planned,
 Despite some improvements
 economic conditions,    ere   a                n no overall recovery, ac-
 cording to the US.embassy.
 SOUTH AFRICA:   Rioting
 Rioting by "coloreds" in the Cape Town area peaked
 late   as  week and has now generally subsided. The death toll
 reached more than 30, and in several instances the rioting spilled
 over into adjacent white communities with much property damage.
 I     I The recent disturbances in Cape Town have apparently
 genera e   a confrontation psychology on the part of the whites,
 who are reported to be rapidly arming themselves.  In two sep-
 arate incidents around Cape Town, white civilians shot and
 killed two "coloreds"   and wounded several others--the first re-
 corded incidents of this nature since the rioting began last

 June. Recurrences are likely because whites and "coloreds" still
 live side by side in some residential sections of Cape Town.
 I               IElsewhere in the country, there was a minor riot in
 a    acc township near Pretoria on Saturday. Although there have
 been no major riots since last Thursday, continuing outbreaks
 of sporadic violence in widely separated parts of the country
 make it difficult to predict where and when disturbances may
 next occur.

 Yakovlev, Chief of the MVD's Internal Troops, and all other MVD

 I            IThe promotions for Andropov and Shchelokov are the
 irs     or any Soviet leaders since late July, when Defense Min-
 ister Dmitry Ustinov became a Marshal of the Soviet Union. Coming
 on the heels of Ustinov's promotion and the earlier elevation
 of General Secretary Brezhnev to Marshal of the Soviet Union,
 they may produce some agitation from the professional military
 for promotions for themselves if they are not already in train.
 It is conceivable that military promotions are being
 saved  or a major announcement in early November at the cere-
 monies marking the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.
 GREECE-TURKEY:  Aegean
 I             The rejection by the international Court of Justice
 on   a ur ay of the Greek appeal for a temporary ban on Turkish
 oil exploration in disputed Aegean waters will probably cause
 the Greeks to negotiate seriously with the Turks.
 The Court also rejected the Turkish request to drop
 the case altogether, but the Turks may now feel confident enough
 to stick to their maximum demands. This would limit the pros-
 pects for progress if the meeting between the Greek and Turkish
 foreign. ministers takes place as scheduled in New York later
 this month.
 The Greek government has tried to put the best face on
 I  e   our  's decision. The government-run television service
 quoted unnamed "legal circles" on Saturday as saying that the
 decision had been expected in light of the earlier UN Security
 Council resolution urging restraint and bilateral talks before
 resorting to the Court.
 As  "positive" points, the unspecified sources noted
 that the Court's action leaves open the possibility of a ruling

 on the substance of the dispute and that Turkey is now bound by
 its statement that its oil exploration does not prejudice Greek
 rights.
 I                      IThe Caramanlis government doubtless is concerned that
 its policy of countering Turkish moves only by diplomatic and
 other peaceful means will prompt more criticism from parts of
 the opposition and the military as well as the public. Caramanlis
 doubtless will be hoping that the Turks will not be emboldened
 by the Court's decision to test Greek resolve further.

 //France, with the second largest gold reserve in
 the EC,  and    e UK were Italy's strongest supporters at the
 committee meeting. West Germany, which has the largest gold
 holdings in Europe, has expressed little concern about the fall
 in gold prices.//
 //The gold issue will be discussed at the IMF
 meeting in Manila early next month.  If the EC receives support
 from some industrial and developing countries,  it will increase
 the pressure on the US to agree to a more flexible scheduling
 of future IMF gold sales.//
 The EC monetary committee announcement had an almost
 immediate effect on the price of gold. The London afternoon
 fixing was $115.70 per ounce, up from $114.00 on Friday morn-
 ing.
 SOUTH KOREA - INDONESIA: Arms Agreement

 agreement with South Korea early this month. According to the
 US defense attache in Seoul, South Korea has agreed to construct
 four guided-missile patrol boats for the Indonesian navy at a.
 shipyard near Pusan. South Korea extended credit to the Indone-
 sians to close the deal,  and the first patrol boat is scheduled
 for delivery in three years.

 ships entering Indonesian waters.//                                                          25X1-
