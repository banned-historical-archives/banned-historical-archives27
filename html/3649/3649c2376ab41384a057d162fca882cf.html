 JAPAN - SOUTH KOREA: CRISIS WORSENS
 )1j (President Pak is taking an extremely hard
 j,- line, especially on the need for a crackdown on
 Chosen Soren, the association of pro-Pyongyang
 Koreans in Japan, in order to:
 ? put the organization on the defensive,
 and reinforce his claim that opposition to his
 regime is inspired by outside elements,
 ? divert attention from his own domestic
 troubles,
 ? and  perhaps most  important in the
 longer term, cause bad blood between Japan
 and North Korea, as Chosen Soren is an in-
 strument of the Pyongyang regime. Pak may
 believe that this would deflect any possible
 Japanese move toward a more neutral posi-
 tion between the two Koreas:?
 rl Ll  Suspicions about Tokyo's motives, as well as
 mor   emotional anti-Japanese sentiment, were no
 doubt heightened by what Seoul regarded as a
 callous initial reaction in Tokyo to the assassina-
 tion incident. While Seoul was accusing North
 Korea of having a hand in the affair, Japanese
 officials made a number of ill-timed public state-
 ments, such as that of Foreign Minister Kimura
 discounting the "threat from the North." This
 statement-when qualified as it later was-did not
 deviate from established Japanese policy, but it
 appeared in Seoul to reflect at best insensitivity
 to South Korean interests, and perhaps deliberate
 attempts by Tokyo to put some distance between
 itself and the Pak regime. 7
 )(   Even if the immediate impasse is resolved,
 Seoul-Tokyo difficulties will continue since they
 are part of a continuing process of adjustment by
 two close allies of the United States to the
 changing environment  in  East Asia. To some
 extent, the events reflect South Korean fears of
 abandonment in an era of detente and, in Tokyo,
 Japan's increasingly ambivalent attitude toward
 the  South  in  its  competition  with the

 South Vietnam
 FIGHTING MAY GET HEAVIER
 10  Fighting continues to be brisk in the north-
 ern provinces, but has slackened off in the south.
 Communist forces have not attempted to make a
 major push against the former imperial capital of
 Hue, but they have forced the government to
 withdraw from positions south of the city that
 were close to populated areas and Route 1. On
 two occasions, North Vietnamese troops have
 temporarily  interdicted  Route  1  between  Da
 Nang and Hue, demonstrating their potential for
 disrupting land resupply of government forces in
 the north in the event of heavier action."
 SA more interesting development, involving
 main forces on both sides, could be shaping up
 near the former district capital of Thuong Duc in
 Quang Nam Province. The First Brigade of the
 government's crack Airborne Division has been
 cautiously preparing to retake this district town,
 which was captured by the Communists this sum-
 mer. The government forces have been moving
 slowly to control the high ground before mount-
 ing an ass, ult on the town, which lies at the head
 of a valley
 the Communists have now move
 regim is of their 304th Division into positions
 from which they hope to hit the flanks of the
 Airborne forces. In response to this move, South
 Vietnamese commanders are planning new rein-
 forcements for their units-1
 )b \Positional battles such as the one that may
 be developing around Thuong Duc have become
 increasingly characteristic of the war since the
 first of the year. In the past, South Vietnamese
 counterattacks usually quickly forced Communist
 forces from towns they had captured. Now, the
 Communists have the advantage of a logistic net-
 work developed since the cease-fire, which pro-
 vides them with the maneuver and supply capa-
 bility to defend some of the positions they have
 captured. Also, recent reductions in the amount
 of ammunition and air support provided to gov-
 ernment infantry forces will further restrict South
 Vietnamese efforts:;
 It)  frhe Communists would like to inflict a sub-
 stantial defeat on the crack First Airborne Bri-
 gade, which they believe would adversely affect
 the morale of other South Vietnamese units. F
 another good boutti   i -
 namese unit, the 1s Infantry Division, has taken
 heavy casualties in fighting during the past two
 weeks in southern Thua Thien Province. Two of
 its regiments are now said to be "almost combat
 ineffective." If both the 1st and Airborne Divi-
 sions sustain substantial losses, this would con-
 stitute a serious setback for the government.

 MOZAMBIQUE: INDEPENDENCE SET
 d-5_/Lisbon and the black insurgent Front for the
 Liberation of Mozambique signed an agreement in
 Lusaka, Zambia, last weekend providing for the
 independence of Mozambique next June and the
 immediate installation of a joint Front-Portuguese
 transitional government. The signing provoked a
 short-lived rebellion by dissident whites demand-
 ing that all of Mozambique's political groups be
 represented in the interim regim4.
 2s  1The dissidents seized two radio stations in
 Lourenco Marques and temporarily occupied the
 airport. Although Lisbon ordered reinforcements
 from northern Mozambique into the capital, mili-
 tary forces acted with restraint in order to avoid
 violence. Nevertheless, demonstrations both sup-
 porting and opposing the rebellion broke out in
 Lourenco Marques and in the port city of Beira
 during which as many as 100 persons were killed
 or injured. The white dissidents finally agreed to
 give up in order to avoid further bloodshed. The
 rebellion sparked a black backlash in the suburbs
 of Lourenco Marques, where it was interpreted as
 an attempt by white separatists to seize control of
 the government. Local authorities in Lourenco
 Marques declared martial law in order to stem a
 wave of vandalism, looting, and arsonl
 Discouraging protest
 "~buring their incipient rebellion, the dissi-
 d nts met with two special representatives sent by
 President Spinola to hear their grievances. Al-
 though they may have received some encourage-
 ment that their demands would be considered by
 Lisbon, it seems unlikely that they gained any
 concessions. Lisbon cannot revoke its agreement
 with the Front, and the Front is not likely to
 consider modifying the agreement to allow its
 political  enemies  a  role  in  the  transitional
 government'1
 5 [The dissidents were able to publicize the
 unrepresentative nature of the interim govern-
 ment, however, and it appears that their action
 attracted considerable sympathy, if little active
 backing, from numerous political organizations in
 the territory. These organizations-made up of
 whites, blacks, and mulattoes-adamantly oppose
 a Front "take-over" and may be encouraged to
 make another attempt to derail the transitional
 government?
 a   Vhe transitional period legally took effect
 upon the signing of the Lusaka agreement on
 September 7. Front officials announced on Sep-
 tember 9 that they will be ready to move into
 Lourenco Marques next week to begin setting up
 the transitional government. Under terms of the
 agreement, the Front will appoint a prime minis-
 ter and two thirds of a nine-member cabinet. The
 Portuguese will be represented by a high com-
 missioner and the remaining cabinet members.
 he two sides will establish a joint military com-
 mission, with equal representation, to deal with
 security problems. The Front, with only about
 3,000 armed troops, would be hard-pressed to
 quell  any disorders without active Portuguese
 )
 assistancet
 Even without further dissidence, the transi-
 tion l government faces a broad array of prob-
 lems.                                                                         Front  leaders have been living in exile
 throughout  their  insurgency and are not ac-
 quainted with the complex economic structure
 and social needs of Mozambique. For some time
 to come, they will need to rely heavily on Portu-
 guese technical expertise if they are to be ready
 to assume full power next June.

 EGYPT: NUDGING THE PLO
 Vin an effort to bring the Palestinians to a
 long-delayed decision to commit themselves to
 peace negotiations in concert with Jordan, Presi-
 dent Sadat has leavened his privately tough
 approach to the Palestine Liberation Organization
 with public sweeteners:(
 The Egyptians are vigorously supporting a
 PLO-initiated strategy to bring the Palestinian
 problem to greater world attention by raising the
 issue as an agenda item at the UN General
 Assembly session that begins next week.)
 t the UN, the PLO is seeking the right to
 address the General Assembly, as well as a resolu-
 tion focusing on the Palestinian situation as a
 separate political issue rather than as a refugee
 problem solely of humanitarian concern. Presi-
 dent Sadat apparently sees support for the PLO's
 UN effort as a relatively painless trade-off for his
 demand that the organization acquiesce, as Sadat
 has done, in Jordan's right to negotiate for the
 return of the Israeli-occupied West Bank)
 UJ (Although the Arabs have not yet developed
 their UN strategy, the broad outlines set out in a
 statement of policy by the Arab League last week
 envision a UN resolution confirming the basic
 political rights of the Palestinian people, par-
 ticularly that of self-determination. From the
 Egyptian viewpoint, the promise of self-determi-
 =nation, backed by the UN assembly, would give
 the Palestinians hope of establishing a future
 separate state on the West Bank after Jordanian-
 Israeli negotiations for the territory
 `Sadat is undoubtedly counting on this to
 'ae JPalestinian inhibitions about participating in
 those negotiations, as an interested party if not
 initially as a principal. The Egyptians have begun
 canvassing for support of the resolution from key
 UN members!

 INDIA-USSR: ASKING FOR FOOD
 C
 oreign Minister Swaran Singh visited Mos-
 cow this week to stress Ipdia's economic needs.
 Singh received a cordial reception, including a
 meeting with party chief Brezhnev on September
 10, but he apparently was unable to extract a
 promise of a sizable loan of food grain.
 S9 JLast year, when the Soviets had a good har-
 vestY, they loaned India two million tons of wheat.
 GNew  Delhi  apparently  would  like  a  similar
 amount this year, but the prospects for the Soviet
 harvest in 1974 are not encouraging. Although
 Brezhnev characterized the harvest overall as "not
 bad" in a speech on September 7, he acknowl-
 edged that the situation in the important wheat-
 growing areas of the eastern USSR, hard hit by
 drought, was "not entirely favorable.'`
 ~t'I   Moscow may also be reluctant to hand over
 morel food  grain  for fear that responding to
 Indian requests two years running might imply a
 continuing  commitment.  The  magnitude  of
 India's needs would place a heavy demand on the
 Soviets' normally limited supplies of exportable
 grain. By lessening its deliveries to India, Moscow
 would gain greater flexibility in meeting require-
 ments elsewhere in the world and hence in ex-
 ploiting , other  opportunities  to  increase  its
 influence(
 1.4   )Singh's visit may help to set the stage for a
 Meeting later this month in Moscow of a bilateral
 commission on economic matters. New Delhi will
 probably press Moscow for balance-of-payments
 relief. In past years, India's trade surplus with the
 USSR has usually been sufficient to cover its debt
 service payments to Moscow. This year, because
 of the increased prices Moscow is charging for
 fertilizers and  kerosene, India's surplus is ex-
 pected to be cut in half/.
 3'1,  [Because the Indian press and public have
 been giving considerable attention to the coming
 i! visit by Secretary Kissinger and to the general
 improvement in Indo-US relations, New Delhi
 may have arranged Singh's trip partly to reassure
 Moscow of the importance India attaches to its
 relationship with the Soviet Union. In addition,
 Prime Minister Gandhi has accepted an invitation
 to visit Moscow later this year, although no date
 has been set .J
 '19  tFor its part, Moscow probably sought to
 probe India's intent regarding nuclear develop-
 ments, particularly for any indication that New
 Delhi is developing nuclear weapons. The Soviets
 did not have advance warning of India's first
 explosion last May. Since the test, India has asked
 for Soviet advice on peaceful uses of nuclear
 power, but Moscow has attempted to discourage
 the Indians even on this score.

 UK: ELECTION IN PROSPECT
 y     rime Minister Wilson's success last week in
 seLuring the support of the British trade unions
 has prepared the way for an early election. Wilson
 met with the Queen last weekend to gain her
 formal assent to holding national elections. The
 polling date, probably  in  early October, was
 expected to be announced late this week
 lSS- The highlight of the annual convention of
 ~fhe ten-million-member Trades Union Congress
 was the debate over Wilson's "social contract," a
 policy of voluntary restraint in wage demands.
 46 Primary opposition came from the engineering
 workers,  Britain's  second  largest union, who
 insisted they could not support even a voluntary
 limit on wage bargaining. Following an 11th-hour
 appeal by Len Murray, general secretary of the
 Trades Union Congress, the engineering workers
 agreed to abstain from voting in the interest of
 solidarity, but noted that they had not retracted
 any of their views. The only vote against the
 social contract came from the civil and public
 services workers
 The unions again endorsed the Labor Party's
 stn on the EC. The convention passed a resolu-
 tion opposing British membership and demanding
 a continued boycott of certain EC institutions,
 but rejected a proposal for immediate withdrawal
 from the  community.  Instead,  the  delegates
 approved Labor's less radical program to renego-
 tiate the terms of membership and to hold a
 referendum on the question-1
 ',L (4 '.abor continues to lead in the opinion polls.
 A poll  released  on September 6 gives Labor
 almost 43 percent of the vote, the Conservatives
 36, and the Liberals 17. According to the latest
 Gallup poll, Labor has a margin of only 4 percent,
 having almost 41 percent of the vote, compared
 with 37 percent for the Conservatives and 18
 percent for the Liberals1
 i.ki   Wilson's victories coincided with a series of
 setbacks for Ted Heath, leader of the Conserva-
 tive opposition. The Ulster Unionist Party en-
 dorsed Enoch Powell, a Tory rebel and long-time
 Heath nemesis, as the candidate for its South
 Down seat, lessening chances that the Unionists
 would  support  a  post-election  Conservative-
 Liberal coalition. A parliamentary seat would also
 provide Powell with a powe  base to rally Con-
 servative opposition to Heath

 lopes for progress toward a negotiated solu-
 tion of the Cyprus conflict in the near future rest
 on the current talks between representatives of
 the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.
 Acting  President  Clerides and  Vice President
 Denktash have met twice since September 6 re-
 garding prisoners of war and refugees. Athens and
 Ankara  have become somewhat more flexible
 toward eventual negotiations, but seem content
 to let Clerides and Denktash come up with some
 local accommodations.
 Clerides and Denktash met on September 6
 and agreed to set up arrangements for the release
 of prisoners, with priority given to the sick and
 wounded and those over 50 or under 18 years of
 age. On September 11, the two leaders said they
 agreed to release those given priority, but no
 specific date was given.
 What to do with other prisoners was not
 decided. This problem touches on one of the
 basic disagreements that prevents progress toward
 political negotiations. Clerides wants the prisoners
 returned to their homes or released where cap-
 tured.  Denktash  insists  that Turkish Cypriot
 prisoners be released in the Turkish-controlled
 sector of the island, reflecting the Turkish desire
 to bring Turkish Cypriots from all over the island
 into the Turkish-controlled area. Clerides refuses
 to accept what amounts to a population ex-
 change, considering it tantamount to de facto
 partition of Cyprus.
 How  much  freedom  of movement both
 Cypriot leaders are given by Greece and Turkey
 will determine the outcome. Denktash, in particu-
 lar, appears to be on a short leash. If no progress
 is made within the next week or so, the Greek
 side seems prepared to take its case to the UN
 General Assembly later this month. Whether the
 Cyprus issue is inscribed on the agenda or not, it
 will undoubtedly be a subject for discussion at
 the General Assembly. The foreign ministers of
 Clerides and Denktash agree before a UN mediator

 he EC resumes a heavy schedule of meet-
 in nhis month, but the prospect of halting the
 drift in community affairs is dubious. Inflation
 has sapped what momentum there was toward
 economic and monetary union, and has put fur-
 ther strains on the common agricultural policy.
 Adding to the gloom is the lack of public support
 for the EC in Britain and the ambivalent attitude
 of the UK's Labor government. Recognizing what
 one French official has called the "sorry state" of
 Europe, Paris hopes to inspire some improve-
 ments in EC procedures-where the French have
 always dragged their feet in the past. The French
 concede that their ideas are modest, however, and
 are not sanguine about their effect:
 ~ One potentially bright spot is the consid-
 eration now being given to the idea of joint
 community borrowing to help members deal with
 their  balance-of-payments  deficits.  The  loan
 would be an important demonstration of financial
 solidarity as well as of an independent capability
 for action on the problem of "re-cycling" oil
 revenues, which is the subject of much interna-
 tional concern. The loan, however, is likely to be
 small-the original goal of $5 billion has been
 reduced to about one billion-and debate over
 such crucial details as to how it will be guaranteed
 could prevent action until the end of the yeai.
 cf The finance, foreign, and farm ministers will
 all Jeet separately next week, but have agreed to
 hold more frequent joint sessions in the future.
 EC economic policies could therefore be better
 meshed, but it is a reform that may be too late,
 given the increasing temptation to respond to
 inflation with national measures. Moreover, fears
 of  recession and concern over  US economic
 policies are beginning to rise in Europe. The
 effect of this on the community is to subordinate
 action to consultation in wider forums. Recession
 fears may also dampen interest in the GATT trade
 negotiations, on which the EC will try to reach an
 agreed position this month.
 6-   fihe effect of the international scene on the
 cohimunity is also apparent in the energy area,
 where the  initiative  is  now clearly with  the
 US-sponsored  Energy  Coordinating        Group.
 France would like to revive movement toward an
 EC policy, but even if the British lift their pre-
 vious objections, any accord is likely to fall short
 of the Commission's original aims.I
 '54 C Next week, the agricultural ministers will be
 hard pressed to come up with new ways to main-
 tain farmers' incomes. While inflation has sent
 expenses soaring, community prices for several
 important agricultural  commodities have been
 held below world levels; at the same time, cur-
 rency changes have played havoc with the con-
 cept of a single EC market. What threatens now is
 an even more complete restoration of national
 farm marketsl
 5 -J  (Paris' ideas for resuming progress toward
 European union, which Chancellor Schmidt may
 have endorsed in his bilateral talks with Giscard
 on September 2, center around restoring majority
 voting in the EC Council, at least on certain
 selected issues. In another reversal of traditional
 French attitudes, Paris is apparently willing to
 propose expanded powers for the European Par-
 liament. Also on Paris' agenda are more inter-
 governmental  cooperation on matters not cov-
 ered by EC treaties and more frequent summit
 sessions "in a community framework."l
 5`~ fhe informal dinner to be hosted by Giscard
 in  aris on September 14 for the leaders of the
 Nine is designed to sound out the prospects for
 community movement and a more formal summit
 later this year. Paris will doubtless consider it a
 success if the Nine arrest the current sense of
 erosion and reawaken interest in European in-
 tegration on both sides of the Atlantic.

 proves its grass-roots organization, however, it is
 not expected to appeal to more than five or ten
 percent of the electorate.(
 Meanwhile, the Socialist Party has officially
 withdrawn  from the Communist-dominated
 Democratic Movement. The move came after it
 became evident that the Communists intended to
 turn the loosely organized coalition, which also
 included a centrist party, into a separate political
 party. The Communists apparently were counting
 on running candidates from the Movement in
 areas where Communist support was weak, and
 candidates from their own party in district where

 3c~President  Zhivkov's praise of the Soviet
 Union was much more reserved than in Septem-
 ber 1973, when his emotional statement that the
 two countries have "the same circulatory system"
 prompted  speculation that Sofia  intended to
 become a part of the USSR. This time, Zhivkov's
 sole reference to integration was an observation
 that the two countries are following a course of
 all-round cooperation and ever closer unity. The
 Soviets may have requested that Zhivkov be less
 fawning this year. Moscow was reportedly embar-
 rassed by the slavish language of last year, and has
 no wish to raise new fears that Bulgaria may
 become a Soviet republic]
 Soviet President Podgorny, the most pres-
 tigious foreign dignitary present, spoke glowingly
 of Bulgaria as a "beloved sister of the USSR,"
 and, as if to underscore Moscow's rejection of
 political union, added: "This has always been the
 line and remains such today. It will be the same
 tomorrow also."
 Zhivkov's discussion of Bulgarian economic
 development  stressed  the  "extremely positive
 role" of the Council for Mutual Economic Assist-
 ance, but admitted-without elaboration-that the
 "unlimited possibilities" of the socialist system
 and the economic council were not being fully
 utilized.}
 r+   In praising the socialist countries of the
 world, Zhivkov listed by name those with which
 Bulgaria is linked by "strong militant friendship."
 The list notably omitted Yugoslavia, Albania, and
 China, which were singled out for separate treat-
 ment. In discussing Yugoslavia, Zhivkov left the
 impression that relations with Belgrade are still
 far from happy; regarding Albania, he mentioned
 that "we want to improve relations and coopera-
 tion." By contrast, he condemned Mao Tse-tung's
 "adventurous, revisionist, and nationalist course"
 as a threat to the socialist achievements of the
 Chinese people. He also said that Bulgaria "reso-
 lutely repudiates and condemns anti-Soviet and
 anti-Communist slanders by Peking," at which
 point the Chinese ambassador and his Albanian
 colleague stalked out of the assembly.
 rAmerican  observers  noted  that  crowds
 showed  little emotion or enthusiasm for the
 parade and paid scant attention to the speeches.
 Young marchers, especially students, seemed par-
 ticularly slack and almost self-conscious in their
 participation. Crowds dwindled as the parade
 went on, and eventually marchers outnumbered
 spectators.

 the disclosure was not new, the cold-blooded

 campaign of "intimidation and repression." He

 firmly drawn. Stronger legislation and new secu-
 rity mechanisms are under study, but these have
 proved ineffective in the past. If the army has
 accepted the inevitability of greater participation
 in the fight against terrorism,
 the government's ability to cope with the
 challenge will improve somewhat. Over the short
 term, however, the struggle between left and right
 will be a bloody one.
 OAS TO CONSIDER CUBA
 f'he foreign ministers of Costa Rica, Co-
 loml5ia, and Venezuela have begun proceedings
 that will lead to an OAS foreign ministers' review
 of the Cuba sanctions on November 11. Several
 governments have made clear their view that Cuba
 remains a threat to hemispheric tranquility, but
 they will not oppose a reconsideration of the
 issue.1
 iLl  he sponsors of the move have been careful
 to I( couch the rationale in terms of a changed
 world situation and a spirit of detente. They
 stress that a vote to lift the sanctions will imply
 no judgment of the Castro regime, but rather will
 release OAS members from obligations that have
 been  in  force  since  1964  although  recently
 honored mainly in the breach. Latin American
 sensitivity about outside interference in matters
 of national  policy has caused the anti-Castro
 forces to be ill at ease about obstructing sister
 republics that want to open the door to Cuba?
 Using the co-existence argument, Costa Rica
 A others are confident that they can secure the
 necessary two-thirds majority vote of the 23
 members to overturn the sanctions. A blocking
 one third plus. one, once assured by the unity
 among  Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Haiti, Nicaragua,
 Paraguay, Uruguay, and the US, seems likely to
 break down in the absence of a strong diplomatic
 blitz. Various governments have noted the relative
 serenity with which Washington has viewed the
 latest developments in the OAS, and have become
 increasingly worried that the US will alter its
 policy and abandon its old allies on the issue.
 Hedging against such  a development,  Bolivia,
 Uruguay, and others have begun to open the way
 to flexibility on the sanctions issue, while con-
 tinuing to assert both their intention to remain
 diplomatically aloof from Cuba and their opposi-
 tion to an inter-American embrace of the Castro

 including the granting of amnes

 Mario Gutierrez, who had been one of Banter s
 chief supporters, has publicly urged that elections
 be held as soon as possible and has formally
 declared his own candidacy. According to an
 assessment by official US observers, there is very
 little popular sentiment in favor of maintaining
 Banzer in office, and a majority within the mili-
 tary as well as most politicians would prefer to
 see a new man take over the presidency/
 /(  [Although Banzer so far has not rescheduled
 elections, he has adopted a conciliatory approach
 to his critics, and has reaffirmed his stated in-
 tention not to run for office. Earlier this week,
 23 the labor minister reportedly told union officials
 that several exiled leaders will be allowed to
 return to Bolivia. According to a national radio
 broadcast, the government has told its consulates
 to issue visas`

 terrorists  freed  President  Echeverria's  father-
 in-law, Jose Guadelupe Zuno, who had been
 kidnaped 11 days earlier. The government had
 refused to talk with the kidnapers about terms for
 the freedom of either man?
 [Until Echeverria became president in 1970,
 politically motivated violence of this sort had
 been absent from Mexico since the late 1920s.
 About 15 guerrilla groups have sprung up since
 1971, but only a handful are now active. The
 groups are small and not well-organized, but they
 have the capability to carry out spectacular acts
 of violence and terrorism and are likely to con-
 tinue being a real nuisance to the government.
