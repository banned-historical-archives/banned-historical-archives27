THE LATE MR. JOHN FOSTER 
DULLES AND JAPAN 
By AIICHIRO FUJIYAMA 
WITH THE RECENT PASSING OF JOHN FOSTER 
Dulles, the late United States Secretary of 
State, not only the United States but the 
world lost a stalwart champion of freedom and demo-
cratic ideals. We in Japan especially feel his loss 
keenly, for we have indeed lost a true and under-
standing friend whose zeal and energy made possible 
our country's return to the family of nations following 
the last war. 
As the architect of the Treaty of Peace with 
Japan, he displayed to the fullest his prowess as an 
able and astute negotiator. Upon his appointment 
by President Truman in May, 1950, as Special 
Representative of the President, with the rank of 
Ambassador, to negotiate the Japanese Peace Treaty,

he devoted a year of concentrated effo ct towards 
adjusting the differing views among the various 
nations, especially those in Asia. He cann? to Japan 
on three different occasions during this Toeriod and 
made several trips to the capitals of Southeast Asia. 
It was on one of his visits to Japan that I had the 
privilege of meeting him for the first time. The effi-
cient and methodical manner in which he i!arried out 
his mission left a deep impression on me. 
Mr. Dulles' concept of a "peace of reccnciliation" 
finally bore fruit with the signing of the P?. ace Treaty 
in San Francisco on September 8, 1951, by forty-nine 
nations. It was acclaimed as Mr. Dulle?;' "master 
handiwork." With the coming into force of the treaty 
on April 28, 1952, normal relations between Japan 
and the United States, as well as other na-ions, were 
resumed. 
Mr. Dulles' role in international affairs, especially 
in relations with Japan, did not begin with his work 
on the Japanese Peace Treaty. In 1919, he was a 
young but brilliant counsellor to the Amo ican Com-
mission to Negotiate Peace at the Versailles Con-
ference, in which Japan took part as one of the 
Allied Nations. It was then that he gaintil valuable 
experience in the conduct of international conferences 
and problems related to post-war settlemen 
It was not mere chance that rocketed Mr. Dulles 
into prominence in the field of internatior al affairs. 
His family background and enviroment weye ideal to 
prepare him for the task that lay ahead. His grand-
father, John Watson Foster, who served as Secretary 
of State from 1892 to 1893 in the Administration of 
President Harrison, is said to have gr omed his 
grandson for a career in the conduct of im emotional

THE LATE MR. JOHN FOSTER DULLES 
affairs. I might mention that this eminent grand-
father later became an adviser to the Chinese 
Government under Li Huang-chang and attended 
?the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending 
the Sino-Japanese War in 1895 in that capacity. 
His uncle, Robert Lansing, was Secretary of State 
in the Wilson Administration and signed the so-called 
Ishii-Lansing Agreement of November 2, 1917, con-
cerning Japan's special interests in China. 
Thus, Mr. Dulles was destined to follow in their 
footsteps and became Secretary of State immediately 
following the inauguration of President Eisenhower 
in January, 1953, thus assuming leadership in the 
conduct of American foreign policy. His first task 
in placing Japanese-American relations, in particular 
trade relations, on a stable and friendly basis was 
the signing of the Treaty. of Friendship, Commerce 
and Navigation on April 2, 1953, thereby restoring 
treaty relations between the two countries, which had 
been disrupted since January, 1940. 
Japan also owes much to Mr. Dulles for his 
initiative and constant support in making possible 
Japan's admission, by a unanimous vote, to the 
United Nations in December, 1956, and later, in 
October, 1957, her election to a seat on the United 
Nations Security Council as a non-permanent member. 
Through personal contacts with Mr. Shigeru 
Yoshida, then Prime Minister, in November 1954, 
and Prime Minister Kishi in June, 1957, when they 
visited the United States, Mr. Dulles laid the ground-
work for a new era in Japanese-American relations 
based on co-operation and partnership. 
As Foreign Minister, I also had the opportunity 
of meeting with Mr. Dulles when I visited Washington

in September, 1957. We discussed variou problems 
of mutual interest. At that time, I was most im-
pressed by his deep grasp of the problems (onfronting 
Japan, in particular his understanding )f Japan's 
vital concern in foreign trade and the position of 
her economy as a basic factor in the stabi ity of the 
Far East. Exactly a year later, in 195, we met 
again and had a very fruitful exchange of views 
on the situation in the Taiwan Straits and other 
international questions. On this occasion, Mr. Dulles 
agreed wholeheartedly to conduct talks in Tokyo on 
the revision of the Security Treaty through diplo-
matic channels in order to make necessary adjust-
ments to the treaty in accordance with new develop-
ments in the situation and the aspirations of the 
Japanese people. He stressed that, by so doing, 
Japan's security would be insured and thc relations 
between the two countries would be placed on a basis 
of stability and mutual trust. 
At the official funeral services for Mr. Dulles on 
May 27, this year, which I attended on behalf of the 
Japanese Government, it was brought home to me in 
sharp relief that a great statesman had pas sed away. 
He may have been looked upon by many as a con-
troversial figure, as a man lacking in flexibility. But 
even his most bitter critics are unanimous in acknowl-
edging that he was a man of principle whose unstinting 
devotion to the high ideals he championed cc namanded 
admiration and respect. This, I believe, is a high 
tribute to his greatness. No one can dem, that he 
served his country at great personal sacrifice and 
that he worked untiringly for peace and freedom. His 
name will go down in history as one who da red when 
others wavered.

INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTANDING-
AN INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY 
By JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER III 
THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL UNDERSTAND-
ing has been strongly and repeatedly impressed 
upon me in recent years. Since 1946, I have 
been fortunate to have traveled widely, especially in 
Asia where I have visited almost every country. My 
travels leave me with two main observations. One 
I find most heartening; the other unfortunate, even 
tragic. 
The first is the gratifying realization that a solid 
basis for understanding between East and West does 
exist. It is to be found in the mutual aspirations 
and the strong kinship of ideals that the people of 
Asia share with the people of the West. It is to be 
found beneath our surface differences of language and 
dress, custom and belief, even race and religion. It 
is to be found in the recognition of the common 
humanity of all men, in the knowledge that at heart 
all men share a wide range of mutual hopes, fears, 
and desires. 
People in all parts of the world believe in the 
dignity of the individual. Men desire justice, and 
wish to live under a rule of law that dispenses-
justice equally among individuals and nations. They , 
are striving to attain equality and believe in their 
right to choose their own form of government. War

is universally feared and dreaded, and pet pie long for 
peace, a peace that will allow them to evelop their 
lives and their nations in a safe, oderiy, and 
productive manner. And all over the w.rld man is 
seeking to improve the lot of himse f and his 
family?to achieve a better and fuller life. 
Upon this broad common ground of shared as-
piration, I have found that the peoples r- f East and 
West are being drawn together. I found that many 
nations in their struggle to gain indepei dence drew 
hope and inspiration from America?from its history 
and its heritage of freedom. I have four tl that they 
have looked to America for sympathetic understand-
ing and help during these difficult transil ional years 
because of a feeling of kinship and comm in purpose. 
A friend who over the years has traveler: widely in 
South America once told me that in rm ny humble 
homes there he would see a photograph a Franklin 
D. Roosevelt, who was then our Presio tent, in a 
revered place alongside the religious syrd tol. When 
my friend indicated that, as an Americ;,n, he felt 
honored by such a tribute, one farme explained 
that he and his people felt Mr. Roosev4 It "cared" 
that America "cared" about them and heir prob-
lems. My travels tell me that people b 1ieve that 
America, as a friend and partner, still "ares." 
And yet?and this is the second, and a dis-
tressing, observation of my trips?I cannc - help but 
sense today a feeling of doubt and disa pointment 
among some people as to whether Ame7ica really 
does understand and appreciate their aspir ttions and 
hopes for peace, freedom and a better life 
I find that many people fail to under stand why 
my country places so great an emphasis u )on arma-

ments and security pacts, why we appear more 
interested in holding back communism than in helping 
the people in their efforts to attain a better life. I 
find that many won der why our economic aid pro-
grams are directed so purposefully to countries where 
the threat of communism seems strongest. And I find 
that many are puzzled by the seeming contradiction 
of American foreign policy that appears at one time 
to oppose colonialism and at another time to defend it. 
It is true that my country is putting heavy 
emphasis upon its armed strength, true that one 
objective of our economic aid program is to check 
communism, and true that some of our policies appear 
contradictory. The doubt about America that these 
actions cause comes from a lack of understanding of 
the difficult postwar role of responsibility into which 
the United States has been cast. We, the Americans, 
are the principal source of strength if the defense of 
the free world becomes necessary. We believe that 
the forces which oppose us respect only strength. 
Therefore, we are convinced that we must maintain 
our strength, not because we believe in rule by force, 
but so that we may gain time to work positively for 
a lasting peace and a better world. American re-
sources for ?foreign assistance being limited, there 
appears to many of our people a special urgency 
about assistance programs to help in the restraint 
of communism. Our global responsibility gives us 
obligations to both our traditional friends and allies 
in Europe and to our new friends in Africa and 
Asia. This duality of interest sometimes makes our 
policies seem contradictory to those who have not 
shared our problems of the past fifteen years.

attitudes and actions becomes serious when it causes 
other peoples to doubt if America still "a res" about 
them and about their problems. They may rest 
assured that the American people do care --and care 
deeply. The same high ideals that have lifted and 
inspired freedom-loving people in other countries 
remain alive in the hearts of the American people?as 
strong, as real, as vital as they were 183 years ago 
when the United States of America declared its own 
independence. 
The depth of the present tragedy of misunder-
standing is the extent to which it retard .4 progress 
toward fulfilling the mutual aspirations of The world's 
peoples. For the villains in this tragedy. we must 
look beyond governments and propagandi As. Mis-
understandings are like weeds. They ne,d not be 
sown, they spring up and flourish merely for want 
of someone willing to root them out. And, so in 
seeking the villains, we must look to ourselves, to all 
and each of us who by our daily actions, or lack of 
action, allow misunderstanding to spread and flourish. 
It is we, the individual citizens who comprise 
our democratic societies, who must undertake the 
task?or, rather create the opportunity?o building 
a true and lasting understanding among the nations 
of East and West. And yet how easy it is for us 
as individuals to evade this responsibility! We can 
readily say that the problems are too gre tt or too 
complex, the end results beyond our compet( nce. But 
we must remember it is the accumulation of our 
individual daily actions that counts. So eten these 
actions have an influence that reaches out fir beyond 
our immediate environment. It is what we do as 
parents, as voters, as businessmen, as workers in

RESPONSIBILITY FOR INT. UNDERSTANDING 
civic and social organizations, as holders of public 
office, that in the last analysis determines our na-
tional policies. The higher the position of leadership 
we hold in our democratic institutions, the greater 
becomes our responsibility to act so as to further 
our democratic ideals, and to present them properly 
to an ever-watching world. 
Today, as never before, free society is on trial 
in the eyes of the world. The momentous question to 
many is whether a free democratic society can fulfill 
the aspirations of its people. The jury is comprised 
of hundreds of millions of people throughout the 
world who have newly come, or are coming, to inde-
pendence. Their decision, one of the most important 
and far-reaching that men have ever been called upon 
to make, will be based on their observation of our 
actions, of our individual actions. 
So important is international understanding that 
there are few other fields where we can discharge 
our personal responsibility to greater effect. The 
pertinent question today is how we ?as individuals 
can play a positive role in building this understand-
ing. There are, of course, countless ways, but I 
would suggest three. 
? First, we must remember that the basis of all 
understanding is knowledge. So let us both, the 
peoples of East and West, increase our individual 
and collective efforts to learn more about each other. 
We must be well-informed about each other's culture 
and pattern of life, accomplishments and problems, 
needs and aspirations. Otherwise, we are certain to 
make many mistakes in our relationships with each 
other, and thus sow the seeds of new misunderstand-
ing. Our divergent; backgrounds, history, geography,

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
resources, religions, and customs may make our views 
of such things as democracy, communism, or even 
individual freedom seem strange to one arlother. In 
many respects we citizens of East and West regard 
each other as virtual strangers. But we are strangers 
only because we are unacquainted, and unacquainted 
only because it is but recently that we have really 
begun to know one another. 
With respect to America, I think the obvious 
unbalance between what we know of Europe and 
what we know of Asia indicates how great an edu-
cational task lies before us. For example, many of 
our young people learn about the civilizations of 
Europe; but few indeed are acquainted with the 
great civilizations of the East. French, Sixinish, and 
German are taught in almost every high school; but 
an American would be hard-pressed to find a school, 
other than a large college or university, where his 
children could learn Japanese, Chinese, aid Hindi. 
Japan is to be commended for the greater degree to 
which the minds of her young people are directed. 
towards Western culture and language. America 
would do well indeed to put an equal emohasis on 
the East. 
Understanding, by its definition, means knowl-
edge. And knowledge can be neither gained nor given 
by decree, no more than understanding can. It can 
only be produced by our earnest individual efforts. 
Second, we must bear in mind that learning 
about each other is no more important than our 
personal and national need to learn from NI ch other. 
Our civilizations both East and West, are rich in art 
and culture, religion and philosophy, litera ure and 
science. If we but direct ourselves to these resources,

RESPONSIBILITY FOR INT. UNDERSTANDING 
we can enrich our individual lives, as well as those 
of our children. 
Even greater than these personal rewards are 
the incalculable benefits that await mankind if the 
combined knowledge and talents of East and West 
can be applied to the enormous challenges of our age. 
The problem and potential of population growth, the 
momentum of whole new continents towards economic 
development, the adventure of space exploration, the 
discovery of new sources of energy and new cures for 
disease, all these offer problems as well as promise. 
To avail ourselves fully of the opportunities they 
present, we must apply to them the total intellectual, 
scientific, cultural, and spiritual resources of all our 
peoples. We must give freely of our learning and 
our culture, to the betterment of life in both East 
and West. 
Here again we should not be daunted by the size 
and complexity of the task before us. It is for us 
to make a beginning. For example, we can encourage 
our governments and businesses to give greater 
support to mutual cultural relations; we can make 
a most effective approach to greater understanding 
if we can create more opportunities to see, hear, and 
enjoy each other's artistic and cultural achievements. 
Language, race, and distance are no obstacles to the 
appreciation of art. The arts, because they speak 
of man's innermost feelings and hopes, have meaning 
for all men. They, better than any other medium, 
express the common humanity of us all?the firm 
basis upon which understanding must rest. 
? The twin efforts of learning about and learning 
from each other call for conscious and continuing 
individual effort. Nonetheless, the effort is vastly

rewarding, and basically essential to mat rstanding. 
Third, we must bring to our relationship with 
one another an honest frankness?the L ankness of 
friends that permits no misunderstandin 2,-. Let us 
speak and act with unreserved sincerity admitting 
fault where fault exists and explaining it As straight-
forwardly as we can. Let us ask candid I luestions so 
we can better know each other's point of view. Let 
us, in short, speak and act frankly and ope)Ily together 
as equal citizens of the world community. 
True and lasting friendship, we must remember, 
does not require a complete identification if thought. 
It does demand that our views be honestly held and 
frankly expressed. It should be expected and even 
welcomed, that true friendship may at t Imes cause 
us to speak out in opposition to one another's view. 
It is the true friend who is quick to f ffer frank 
advice, even if he knows this will offend his friend. 
The true friend cares more about the weL are of the 
other than about surface civilities. The true friend 
is not afraid of dispute, because he kno vs dispute 
will pass but friendship will endure. 1 his is the 
kind of friendship based on understanding which 
the peoples of East and West must work to achieve. 
It is a friendship best described by a homekt American 
saying: "A friend is a fellow who know i$i all about 
you?and likes you anyway." 
So I offer these three approaches for building a 
better understanding between East and West?first, 
gain a greater knowledge of each othe i; second, 
mutually profit by each other's cultural ar d intellec-
tual heritage, and third, achieve in all our re ationships 
an honest frankness, the frankness of frien ls.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR INT. UNDERSTANDING 
individual responsibility for understanding. History 
and this shrinking world have united the destinies of 
Asia and America. We stand together at a fateful 
crossroads, facing perils and opportunities almost 
beyond imagination. We need each other for inspi-
ration, for strength, for friendship. 
With understanding, all else becomes possible. 
Understanding will allow us to resolve the difficulties 
that are bound to arise even between friends. And 
understanding will allow us to realize to the max-
imum the opportunities we shall have to fulfill the 
dreams and ideals of our people. Then, let under-
standing be the aim of our mission, so that together 
we can build the world of peace and promise to 
which both East and West aspire.

JAPAN'S SHARE IN ECONOMIC 
CO-OPERATION 
By HAYATO IKEDA 
ECONONTIC CO-OPERATION, A NEW FEATURE IN 
international economic relations, .11,s come to 
play an exceedingly important role Ln interna-
tional economy, as it purports specifically to promote 
a mutually beneficial economic relation b,-tween ad-
vanced industrial countries and the count ries which 
have not yet been fully industrialized. 
Moreover, it is of vital importance, with a view 
in particular to promoting mutual wcfare and 
friendly relations, to offer whole-hearted c,)-operation 
to the neighboring Asian countries, who,??,-till young 
in their national history of independence, are today 
striving earnestly in their epochal endeavcr to build 
up their economy. 
In order to meet this requirement, Japan, during 
the last few years, has adopted some positive 
measures for expediting economic co-opet ation. In 
this connection, a marked advance was witnessed in 
1958, when successful induction was made of foreign 
development programs, and budgetary app 1)priations 
for economic co-operation were considerably increased. 
This was a matter for congratulation, as it enabled 
Japan to undertake, during the same year, the 
establishment of yen credit with India, as well as 
the conclusion of agreements on economic co-opera-

tion with the United Arab Republic, economic and 
technical co-operation with Laos and Cambodia, co-
operation with the Philippines in its enterprise of 
Marikina dam construction, and so forth. Now, by 
making brief, analytical survey of the present condi-
tions of economic co-operation in diverse fields of 
investments, loans, technical and financial co-operation, 
the present writer will venture here to envisage future 
prospects of such economic co-operation. 
SOME PHASES OF ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION 
1. Investments 
Foreign investment, when inducted into an under-
developed country in a manner adaptable to its eco-
nomic development, will contribute largely to the 
development and utilization of natural resources, as 
well as to the progress of industrialization and 
multiple economic development in that country. With 
an advanced country which makes such investment, 
it serves to open way for the effective use of accu-
mulated capital, and to secure the import of vital 
natural resources. Japan's postwar foreign invest-
ments, of which the first instance was undertaken for? 
Okinawa in 1951, have, ever since then, increased 
almost annually, reaching in aggregated total 229 
instances, with the sum amounting to $61,503,000 
before January 1, 1959. Of these instances, 149 
covering $14,630,000 represent private investments 
made to trading corporations in various countries, 
with the United States leading. The investments in 
production industry, which totalled $3,000,000 in 1954

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
and 1955 respectively, rose to $8,726,00 in 1956, 
rising with a yet sharper upward curve to $15,-
542,000 in 1957 and to $15,221,000 in 1958. The 
favorable trend in Japan's foreign investments con-
tinued throughout 1956, a boom year with a notable 
expansion in export; and despite a recession in 
domestic economy in 1957, the same tretd continued 
through that year and well into 1958. The continued 
favorable trend might be ascribable to the fact that, 
since foreign investment contracts require much the 
longer time for negotiations, those which materialized 
in 1957 included a large number of the contracts of 
which negotiations had been started in ,,956. It is, 
however, more largely attributable to the fundamental 
reason that foreign investment is conducted with a 
view to overall economic development, and on the basis 
of such requisites of permanent nature as the ex-
pansion of export trade, the stability iti importing 
vital natural resources, and so on. 
When classified by region and by the type of 
industry, the larger portion of investments made in 
North America goes to the mammoth project of de-
veloping Alaskan pulp industry; the Central and 
South American investments number 30 with the sum 
amounting in total to $32,661,000, followed by the 
43 instances of investment made in Southeast Asia 
with $4,432,000. A marked predominance allowed to 
the Central and South American investments over 
those in Southeast Asia can be explained by the fact 
that, in Central and South America, foi eign invest-
ment encounters hardly any restrictions, but is met 
with favorable conditions provided under the United 
Nations' industrial development progral ; whereas, 
most of the Southeast Asian countries have not yet

JAPAN'S SHARE IN ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION 
adopted the proper legislation for the induction of 
foreign investments, or even sufficiently effective meas-
ures to provide for remitting profit shares, refunding 
the capital, or paying the necessary guarantee. And 
they do not, under the regulations currently in force, 
permit Japanese investors to hold a majority of 
shares. Furthermore, these Southeast Asian countries, 
independent only since the termination of World War 
II, are still definitely under the influence of the general 
tendency, antagonistic toward foreign investment and 
strongly colored with nationalism. The Central and 
South American countries, having achieved independ-
ence as early as in 1820, are all of them in favor 
of and fully prepared to receive foreign investments. 
2. Loans 
Loans are granted in the form of funds or the 
equipment necessary for industrial development; and 
usually a refund consists of products of the industry 
thus developed, such as, for example, ores, lumber, 
etc. Loans granted to enterprises in various coun-
tries amount in total to $50,658,000, covering 53 
instances, including $28,984,000 to North America, 
$5,118,000 to Central and South America, and $16,-
236,000 to South Asia. Of the loans granted to 
North America, the development of Alaskan pulp 
industry has claimed $28,605,000; and the Central 
and South American loans include 5 instances in 
textile industry amounting to $1,080,000, 2 instances 
in mining industry amounting to $1,347,000, and 19 
instances (15 in Brazil, 1 in Argentina, 1 in Peru 
and 2 in Urgay), with $2,648,000, granted through

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
the Japan Emigration Promotion Compan to various 
emigration enterprises. In Southeast Ash, loans are 
granted with priority accorded to the Philippines, 
where the undertaking of joint enterprises is not 
permitted. For funds and equipment supplied to 
develop an industry, the products thereof are imported 
to Japan at reduced import rates. Major Japanese 
investors in this connection are Kinoshita Company 
in iron mining; Mitsui Mining and Smelt ng Co. and 
Mitsubishi Metal Mining Co. both in coper mining; 
and Marubeni-Iida Co. in lauan industry development; 
the total sum invested amounting to $7,460,000. 
Besides this, $6,924,000 are invested in the develop-
ment of mining in Goa and Malaya. Particularly, 
in the case of loans to Goa, which was the first 
instance among Japan's postwar overseas enterprises, 
a remarkably close co-operation has been maintained 
between Japan's Kokan Mining Co. and Goa's Chow-
gule Co. 
3. Technical Assistance 
As of January 1, 1959, the instances f technical 
assistance rendered by Japan totalled 11E,, including 
90 for Southeast Asia still on a low ted l nical level. 
India and Formosa together have receivi d most of 
such assistance: India, on account of its five year plan 
currently in progress with the goal set at industrial 
leadership in Southeast Asia; and Formo,a, because 
of its eager aspiration to achieve self sufficiency in 
view, particularly, of national defense. In fact, 
however, both India and Formosa possess industrial 
capital worthy of receiving such technical assistance

JAPAN'S SHARE IN ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION 
as Japan can offer. 
Central and South America have so far received 
technical assistance only in 16 instances, due to the 
fact that most of the countries in that region, having 
assimilated American or West-German advanced tech-
nology, now maintain a considerably high technical 
level. Furthermore, there are many joint enter-
prises established in that region, with Japan holding 
the larger portion of shares. Those enterprises are 
more or less closely affiliated with some of the major 
Japanese enterprises at home, so that technical assist-
ance need not follow its ordinary procedure. 
When classified by the type of industry, the 
instances of technical assistance are grouped in 21 for 
fishery, 17 for machine industry, 15 for mining, 
textile, and electric industry. 
4. Capital Co-operation 
The year 1958 witnessed a long stride taken in 
capital co-operation. In this connection, special men-
tion must be made of the yen credit accorded to India, 
agreements concluded on economic and technical co-
operation with Laos and Cambodia, an accord reached 
on economic co-operation with the United Arab Re-
public, and so forth. 
(1) Yen Credit for India. 
India is one of the most important markets for 
Japan's export of industrial commodities. Therefore, 
the adoption of a special financial plan for India has 
been under consideration since the middle of 1957, 
partly in order to assist in the achievement of its

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
five-year plan, and partly to expedite Japan's export 
to that country. Following Prime Minister Kishi's 
visit to India and Indian Prime Ministt r Nehru's 
visit to Japan in May and October respectively in 
1957, the plan finally materialized into an agree-
ment reached by Japan and India in February, 1958, 
providing that the former accord a yen credit of 
Y18,000,000,000 to the latter over a period of three 
years. The establishment of yen credit?a precedent, 
indeed, of epochal significance ? has opened a new 
field for Japan's economic co-operation with South-
east Asian countries. 
Available commodities under this in credit 
agreement are equipment for railways, power gen-
eration and transmission, dam construction, and the 
mining and processing of coal and iron ore; vessels; 
harbor equipment; industrial machinery (including 
plants for manufacturing rayon, pulp, chemical fer-
tilizer, caustic soda, etc.) ; machine tools; and other 
commodities agreed upon by the Governments of the 
two countries. The recipients designated are the 
Government of India, its state-controlled enterprises, 
state governments and private enterprises. In case 
the recipient is the Indian Government, no guarantee 
is required on the security. When it is either a 
national enterprise, or a state government, a guar-
antee must be supplied by the Indian Ge,-ernment; 
and when a private enterprise, a joint guarantee is 
required of the State Trading Corporation and the 
Indian Government. The rate of interest is deter-
mined case by case on the same level as that charged 
by the World Bank. 
Considerable delay was caused in determining 
the pertinent proceedings, due to the discovery made

JAPAN'S SHARE IN ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION 
some time after of the facts (1) that the state 
government, under the internal law of India, could 
not be party to a foreign credit contract, and (2) 
that the State Trading Corporation, as it was, could 
not be instrumental in offering a guarantee. 
The designation of items was also delayed by 
the adjustment required on the part of India. Sub-
sequently, negotiations were reopened in October, 
1958, as a result of which the two countries have 
approved as an expediency (1) that in case a state 
government or a private enterprise wishes to obtain 
yen credit, the Indian Government receives such 
credit, and transfers it to the original applicant; and 
(2) that the credit should be made applicable to such 
items as power generating plants (Y6,000,000,000), 
vessels (Y5,000,000,000), coal washing plant (Y2,-
400,000,000), telephone equipment including cables 
(Y2,800,000,000), steel products (Y1,800,000,000), etc. 
Besides the yen credit, Japan at the first meet-
ing of the creditor countries agreed to furnish India 
with an additional credit grant of $10,000,000. The 
items determined under this credit agreement include 
power generation equipment, transformers, textile 
machinery, rubber machinery for manufacturing con-
veyor belts, viscose, tire-cord plants, rayon plants, 
etc., priority being accorded to items for which the 
Indian Government has already issued import licenses. 
Up to now, the yen credit utilized has amounted 
to only Y2,160,000,000 and the additional credit to 
Y1,700,000,000.

(2) Economic and Technical Co-ope Alan with 
Laos and Cambodia. 
Since Laos and Cambodia waived their claim for 
war indemnity payment, Japan, by way oj returning 
their friendly gesture, has decided to offe 1. economic 
and technical co-operation, free of any ob igation, to 
these countries. The negotiations in this connection, 
initiated at the end of 1958, were brought to a satis-
factory conclusion this year, providing for a grant of 
Y1,000,000,000 for Laos to be used in c )-operation 
with that country in constructing water- vorks and 
bridges in the capital of Vientiane; and a Y1,500,-
000,000 grant for Cambodia for estab ishing an 
agricultural training center ( with farm ng imple-
ments and a travelling clinic), a catth breeding 
center, and so forth. The agreements, v hich were 
reached early this year, provide for the following 
proceedings much in the same way as 1 eparations 
payment: the Japanese Government will sa iction and 
issue export licenses on contracts conclude( with the 
Government of Laos or Cambodia; the pa ,Inent for 
such contracts will be made by the Japa nese Gov-
ernment, out of the Reparations Paymei It Special 
Account in the national budget, to Japan ,se enter-
prisers through the banks designated by ti c Govern-
ment of Laos or Cambodia. 
(3) Economic Co-operation with UAR Egyptian

was concluded and signed by Japan's M nister of 
International Trade and Industry Taka.,,aki and

JAPAN'S SHARE IN ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION 
UAR's Minister of Industry Sidky on the occasion 
of the latter's visit to Tokyo in September, 1958, set 
?the first precedent in Japan's economic co-operation 
with the countries in the Near East. Under this 
agreement, Japan will export to UAR $30,000,000 
worth of cotton weaving machinery, can-manufactur-
ing and canning plants, sugar plants, etc., on terms 
of payment far more advantageous to the payee than 
those of deferred payment. With the addition of a 
$17,000,000 credit set for the import of diesel cars, 
the credit ammints in total to $50,000,000. In connec-
tion with this agreement, mention must be made of 
the following: (a) its conclusion required only one 
month, whereas the settlement of deferred payment 
in individual cases usually requires at least six 
months; (b) the payment terms within the credit 
line are more tole:rant than those set for deferred 
payment; and (c) the Japanese Government took 
interest in individual contracts, and rendered invalu-
able service in bringing them successfully to an early 
conclusion. 
(4) Yen Credit for Paraguay. 
Along with the negotiations currently in pro-
gress for increasing the number of Japanese 
emigrants, mostly farmers, to Paraguay, negotia-
tions for the establishment of yen credit for that 
country have been settled. Japan agreed to render 
a credit in term of yen to furnish Paraguay with 13 
river vessels, amounting in value to Y1,350,000,000; 
this is a worthy project Of economic co-operation, 
serving, at the same time, as a measure most ap-
propriate to the emigration promotion policy. In this

conjunction, an emigration agreement was signed on 
June 23, 1959 between Paraguay and Japan, providing 
for the emigration of 85,000 Japanese over a period 
of 30 years. 
Furthermore, the technical co-operation agree-
ment recently signed with Iran, providin- for the 
promotion of technical exchange between that coun-
try and Japan, has opened a way for th, dispatch 
of Japanese experts to the Near East, and for 
receiving, in return, a group of technicians from 
that region. 
More recently, on the occasion of President 
Garcia's visit to this country in Deceml,er, 1958, 
Japan agreed to accord economic co-operation to 
the Philippines in the latter's projects of construct-
ing Marikina Dam and telecommunication ystem in 
Manila, on the terms of deferred payment, such as 
are provided for under the reparations payment 
agreement concluded with that country. 
5. Technical Co-operation 
Japan's technical co-operation has so tar been 
carried out by means of receiving technica; trainees 
from overseas, dispatching experts abroad, and es-
tablishing technical training centers in various 
foreign countries. Both the reception of foreign 
trainees and the dispatch of Japanese experts are 
executed on either government or private basis. 
Regionally speaking, technical co-operation is accorded 
mostly to Southeast Asia, in conformity with the 
provision made in the Columbo Plan. The establish-
ment of technical training centers oversea,, a co-

JAPAN'S SHARE IN ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION 
operative measure favored by many advanced countries, 
was undertaken by Japan only so recently as 1958. 
(1) Receiving Foreign Technical Trainees. 
Foreign technical trainees are received by the 
Japanese Government through the following four 
routes: - namely, the Colombo Plan, the United 
Nations' programs, the International Cooperation 
Administration (ICA), or at the request made by 
the government of each respective country. 
The number of foreign trainees received by 
Japan increased from 38 in 1957 to 88 in 1958. 
When classified by the route through which they 
were received, the increase in those two years was 
from 11 to 22 under the Colombo Plan, 1 to 6 under 
the United Nations' programs, 17 to 31 through the 
ICA, and 9 to 29 at government request. The in-
crease is ascribable partly to the high, all-round 
appreciation of the technical co-operation in this 
specific field and partly to the increase in the 
budgetary appropriations which made it possible 
during the period of 1957 - 58 to improve and expand 
hitherto unsatisfactory training facilities. 
When catalogued by the kind of industry, 4070 
of these foreign trainees were engaged in agriculture 
and fishery, 19% in iron and steel industry, and the 
remaining 41% in various other industries. 
As to the expenses incurred in this connection, 
the Japanese Government pays all the expense cover-
ing the sojourn, travel, and training of the trainees 
received under the Colombo Plan; but in the case of 
trainees received under the other three plans, the 
expense incurred by their sojourn and travel is paid 
25

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
by either the United Nations, the ICA, or the gov-
ernment of each respective country, while Japan is 
responsible for only their training expense. 
To make an overall survey of the trai mes who 
came to Japan through various private routes is 
almost impossible; however, their number is esti-
mated to be 73 in 1954, 96 in 1955, 118 in 1956, 
70 in 1957, and 20 during the first six n onths of 
1958, their aggregate total for the past f2ve years 
being estimated as 377. They were mostly sent to 
Japan by their respective governments in connection 
with the import of various plants. In futur,, Japan 
should provide more systematic and better-planned 
means to encourage the coming of technical trainees 
from abroad. 
(2) Dispatch of Japanese Experts. 
The Japanese experts dispatched abroad in 1957 
and 1958 were 25 and 12 under the Japan se Gov-
ernment's sponsorship; 21 and 11 under the Colombo 
Plan; one each at the request of the foreign govern-
ment; and one in 1957 only, under the United 'Cations' 
program. 
These experts were dispatched abroad moitly for 
the purpose of imparting skilled knowledge n home 
industry, such as doll making, toy manuft, cturing, 
bamboo crafts, pottery, and so on; or to offe highly 
advanced technical knowledge, such as is required 
in research work in mining. The decrease in the 
number of dispatches was caused mainly by the re-
quirements being almost always for exp, rts in 
possession of highly advanced technological knowledge, 
or of skilled experience, so that it was by nu means

JAPAN'S SHARE IN ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION 
an easy task for Japan to make selection of proper 
men in the respective fields of industry. 
Through private channels, however, as many as 
2,389 experts were dispatched overseas during a five-
and-one-half-year period from 1954 to June, 1958. Of 
these, 71% was accounted for by experts in mining 
and manufacturing industry, who accompanied the 
export of various plants, and took charge of the 
installation, operation and management of equipment. 
Meanwhile, the aspirants for overseas dispatch 
who registered at the Economic Co-operation Center 
of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in-
creased to 700 within a short period of 10 months 
after the inauguration of the Center in May, 1958. 
Of these registered experts, 10 have already been 
dispatched to India, Pakistan and Brazil. The 
services of this organization should be improved in 
such a manner as to increase the number of 
registered experts, as well as of the contracts 
successfully concluded, and, at the same time, to 
stream-line its liaison work with competent govern-
ment offices. 
(3) Technical Training Centers. 
A new method of according technical co-opera-
tion through the establishment of a training center, 
complete with equipment and expert instructors, has 
of late become a common practice among advanced 
countries. Japan, having decided in April, 1958, to 
establish a technical training center in Howrah area, 
West Bengal, dispatched an inspection group to the 
area and entered into negotiations immediately with 
India. As a result, an agreement was concluded with

India on the establishment of a technicJ training 
center in the said area for developing ir- n foundry 
and electrometer manufacture, with JawAn furnish-
ing necessary equipment valued at Y30,0140,000 and 
dispatching expert instructors. West Ge many has 
already achieved a marked success in tit s field of 
technical co-operation through establishi] g, jointly 
with the Indian Government, a technicl I training 
center in Okhla area, New Delhi, with equipment 
worth 6,000,000 rupies and 12 experts dispatched 
from its own country. Since India lacks in experi-
enced competent technicians, this type of c -operation 
will contribute greatly to the developme it of her 
industry, and incidentally to the achievem4nt of her 
five-year plan. Not only that but also the recipients 
of training at such an institution will eventually 
become a mainstay among the experts and echnicians 
of that country; then their judgement f unded on 
intimate knowledge of Japanese machin( ry, it is 
hoped, will assist in promoting Japan's ex )ort trade

JAPAN'S POLICY FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPE1 'ATION 
1. In the face of the current mountin 4: enthusi-
asm for world-wide economic co-operation, as described 
briefly in the foregoing, the most imminent question 
today will be how to prepare a practicable plan for 
utilizing a possible Y5,000,000,000 South( ast Asia

JAPAN'S SHARE IN ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION 
development fund. In 1957, Japan proposed an 
international establishment of such a fund, but the 
plan has not yet materialized. Meantime, Japan, by 
way at once of reasserting her proposal, and making 
an investment in international co-operation (equivalent 
in value to, and transferable, later on, to the South-
east Asia development fund upon its establishment), 
has set up a fund of Y5,000,000,000 and deposited it 
in the Export-Import Bank of Japan at the end of 
October, 1958. It is, therefore, not at all inopportune 
to begin a study now to ascertain the manner in 
which such a development fund can be utilized most 
effectively in economic co-operation with Southeast 
Asia. First and foremost in importance is the de-
velopment of unexplored natural resources in this 
region, such as iron ore, petroleum, non-ferrous 
metal ores, etc. This kind of natural resource 
development will not only contribute greatly to the 
economic development of producing countries, but it 
will also secure for Japan a stabilized import of vital 
raw materials at favorably low rates. Thus, the 
utilization of funds in this line must be considered 
the best and most advantageous. 
2. Since most of the Southeast Asian countries 
are suffering from a shortage in foreign currency 
holding, Japan should render as much co-operation 
as possible by according yen cridit, or some other 
means of furnishing credit. An ?exhaustive cate-
gorical study should be made in this conjunction 
on ?the prevalent economic condition abroad, viewing 
it by market as well as by country. She may, then, 
be able to distribute credit with priority offered to 
the best advantage to the countries she considers 
most important. By so doing, she will be able to

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
contribute to the economic development of other 
countries, and, at the same time, to promote the 
stabilization of her own economy. 
3. With a view to encouraging the dispatch of 
Japanese experts abroad, measures should be taken 
by the Government to advance their traN olling ex-
penses, to supplement the proceedings followed under 
the Colombo Plan with a more efficient system, to 
improve the function currently assignee to the 
Economic Co-operation Center of the Japan Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry, to ensure the living of 
the dispatched experts after their return from 
abroad, and so forth. In fact, the experts dispatched 
to Pakistan have lately submitted requests in respect 
particularly to the last measure quoted abovf-, namely, 
the establishment of a co-operative system for them, 
the application of a health insurance systen to their 
families during their absence, and so on. 
A new pattern in technical training will be the 
establishment overseas of a pilot firm of nall-and-
medium scale industry workers. As is done at a 
technical training center, instructions will be given 
to the overseas trainees by expert member -; of this 
group at the firm. Their manufactured products 
will be sold in the market and after th?, expense 
for its establishment is covered by the proceeds from 
their production, the pilot firm, with necessary equip-
ment and all, will be released for public sale. 
Moreover, the profit accruing from the enterprise and 
sale of one pilot firm will make it possibl, to open 
another of a different type, or of the same type in 
some other area. 
4. In view of the fact that a majority of the 
trainees from abroad are desirous of acquiring

JAPAN'S SHARE IN ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION 
knowledge and skill mostly connected with small-
and-medium scale industry, it will be advisable to 
establish an overall center covering all the types of 
small-and-medium scale enterprises, so that the 
trainees may receive training there in a manner 
more efficient and systematic than when they are 
trained at individual. enterprises. 
5. Ties with neighboring Asian countries must 
be strengthened, in line particularly with the world-
wide trend in favor of the establishment of economic 
blocs. Such ties, when based on an indefatigable 
study of commodity circulation and multiple trade 
settlement, will, beyond doubt, assist in forming an 
Asian Common Market in the very near future. 
6. There are in Japan today some twenty 
consultative organizations for promoting economic 
co-operation with other countries, viz. the Japan 
Consulting Institute, the Association for International 
Technical Co-operation, the Overseas Construction 
Association of Japan, the International Engineering 
Consultants Association, etc. However, these organi-
zations exist independently, having neither connection 
nor contact among them. Such a situation naturally 
calls for the establishment of a liaison committee of 
their own, or of a central organization, to keep them 
in close contact with one another, and eventually to 
promote efficiency in their work of co-operation. 
7. Although a number of inquiries have already 
been received regarding the possibility of establishing 
joint enterprises of small-and-medium scale industry 
abroad, cases are yet but few where this kind of plan 
is successfully carried out. The failure to meet such 
requirements abroad may be attributed partly to 
the inadequate system currently in existence, and

partly to the insufficient work done in the line of 
public relations. It is generally recomn eded that 
function of this nature should be assigned to the 
Economic Co-operation Center of the Japat. Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry; as this organ lzation, as 
mentioned previously, conducts research on such 
enterprises of small-and-medium scale industry as 
are desirous of dispatch overseas, and tales charge 
of their registration, assistance and public relations, 
etc. 
When all these diverse plans for economic co-
operation are developed steadily in close connection 
with one another, economic co-operation will eventually 
serve as a mighty link of epochal importance in future 
international relations the relations based on mutual 
welfare and prosperity.

AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 
IN ASIA 
By YOSHIJI TOGARI 
OF THE SEVEN REGIONS OF THE WORLD, NAMELY 
Europe, North and Central America, South 
America, Asia, Africa, Oceania and USSR, 
Asia forms the largest agricultural bloc in the 
nominal sense that it possesses the most extensive 
farming area, with almost one-half of its population 
engaged in agriculture. Nevertheless, when its agri-
cultural production is computed in terms of per-unit 
yields, Asia, together with Africa, ranks the lowest 
in the world's list of agricultural productivity, except 
in the production of yams, sweet potatoes, or soybeans. 
This low agricultural productivity in Asia is 
attributed largely to the fact that the larger part of 
its area was left uncultivated for a long time, while 
the people on it continued to live in an impoverished 
state under the colonial policy of the Western Powers. 
It is true that liberal investments and advanced 
technique, when coupled with cheap labor, succeeded 
in boosting some specific crops, such as rubber, sugar 
cane, coconut, tea and so forth. However, these enter-
prises were carried out with the exclusive aim set 
at expanding the trade of the ruling nations, but 
never for the purpose of promoting the agricultural 
industry for the welfare of the native population. 
To be more explicit, the British colonial policy en-

couraged the production of tea in Ceylon, rice in 
Burma, cotton and jute in India, and rubber in 
Malaya, with a view to stimulating British trade in 
this region through inter-exchange of such agricultural 
commodities. The result is that none of these coun-
tries, upon acquiring their long-cherished independence, 
has actually become independent, in so far as agri-
cultural production is concerned. Moreover, under 
the colonial policy, priority was accorded to the 
cultivation of such agricultural products as were 
deemed of high commercial value, with the result that 
the production of the foodstuffs necessary for the 
population was left in complete negligence. For such 
reasons, many countries in Asia have not yet attained 
self-sufficiency in their food production; they are 
still, today, heavily dependent on import.; of food-
stuffs from outside. (Tables I and II)

1. Need for Agricultural Development and 
Production Increase 
In fact, those countries are even yet exceedingly 
young in their national history, having achieved in-
dependence only after the end of World War II. In 
the initial stage of their liberation and independence, 
they invariably set their aspirations high on planning 
for industrialization. Now that the first heat of their 
sanguine expectation has somewhat cooled off, they 
are awakened to the unassailable reality that such 
industrialization as they have aspired to could never 
be achieved, unless a solid, extensive foundation be 
prepared through the effective modernization of their 
agricultural industry, which is the foremost in im-
portance of all the primary industries. Now, in full 
realization of this fact, they have come to show 
greater concern over agricultural development.

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
countries in Southeast Asia and in the Near East 
are, in spite of the fact that they are primarily 
agricultural countries, markedly behind in agricultural 
technique and methods. It is but natural they 
should turn to Japan, their neighboring country, for 
guidance and precedents, knowing that the latter has 
achieved a remarkable advance in both the technique 
and methods of her agricultural industry within the 
short space of time since the Meiji era. On the 
other hand, those countries are good customers for 
Japan's foreign trade, as they import from Japan 
several times more than they export to this country. 
A large number of their nationals have been visiting 
Japan annually since the end of the Iasi war for 
the purpose of study and inspection. There is some-
thing more in this than the mere attraction of 
Japan's advanced industrial condition?possibly the 
feeling, so to speak, of neighbory reliance maintained 
by them. If so, let Japan meet their reliance by 
offering them whole-hearted co-operation, be it in the 
agricultural or any other field of industry. 
Most of these Asian countries have been receiving 
large amounts of financial aid from advanced coun-
tries; and due to that fact, they may interpret 
Japan's offer of co-operation in terms of financial, 
or material aid. In this connection, Japan, being 
still in the course of postwar rehabilitation, may not 
be free to meet their expectation, although she wishes 
to offer the best help available within her own 
capacity. On the other hand, Japan can, and feels 
entirely free to, offer her technical co-operation to 
an unlimited extent. Fortunately, these countries 
and Japan have much in common, in so far as the 
scale in agricultural industry is concerned. (Table III)

much room left for improvement, if co-operation of 
this kind is to be rendered more effectively, and to 
the better advantage of recipient nations. With that 
in view, the Japanese agricultural mission, headed by 
Roving Ambassador Seiichi Tobata, the then Professor 
of the University of Tokyo, was dispatched at the end 
of 1958 to conduct a survey of the agricultural condi-
tions in the major countries in Southeast Asia and 
the Near East. The present writer, who was a mem-
ber of that mission, will now proceed to outline the 
nature of the co-operation which Japan can offer to 
advance the agricultural development in this region, 
making reference, in particular, to the results obtained 
by the recent survey mission.

2. Rice Cultivation 
Rice is the most important of all the staple 
foodstuffs required by the Asian popull, tion. The 
history of rice cultivation can be traced far back to 
a time some 4,000 years ago. The cudivation of 
rice originated in some land between South China 
and Bengal; thence it made its way we-tward into 
Europe and America, and eastward into China and 
Japan. Today, high-yielding rice cultivai ton is seen 
in some European countries, namely Italy, France, 
Spain and Portugal; whereas rice cultivation is still 
limited to a primitive scale in most of the Asian 
countries, with the exception of Japan, Korea and 
Formosa. 
Varieties of rice plants are numerou ; they are 
characterized by different hereditary constituents 
suited to divergent environmental requirmnents. In 
other words, rice plants, when transplanted to a new 
area, lose some of their hereditary consti uents, and, 
with the surviving hereditary elements, transmute 
themselves into a new kind of species, one most adapt-
able to the new environment. The differentiation of 
species has naturally promoted the propagation of 
rice cultivation; and artificial imprax ?ment and 
selection of species further expedite the propagation. 
Thus, there are today tens of thousands of different 
varieties of rice in the world. 
The numerous species of rice can he classified 
broadly into two, the Japonica and the Indica 
types. The differentiation into these tw( types took 
place when rice cultivation spread north ward. The 
Japonica type of rice plant comes on th, ear under

AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA 
the climatic condition of high temperature and 
shorter day-length. When this type of rice variety 
is cultivated in low latitude areas, it will head 
before its vegetative growth is completed, and, as 
a consequence, no satisfactory harvest can be ex-
pected. Most of the Indica varieties are not susceptible 
to climatic conditions, so that they come into ear 
in a proper course of time, even under different 
climatic conditions. 
The Indica type of rice variety, when compared 
with the Japonica type, has higher absorptivity, since 
it has long been cultivated in the areas where little 
or no fertilizer is applied. When manured, this 
type will absorb too much fertilizer, and will fall 
prostrate, or become more susceptible to insect 
demages. In most of the Asian countries, where 
the application of fertilizer has not yet become 
practicable, the Indica varieties are, for the time 
being, better suited for cultivation. 
A potent reason for low agricultural productivity 
in Asia, among many others, is the fact that cultiva-
tion is carried out with no application of fertilizer. 
For yielding 20 bushels of unhulled rice per one acre, 
the land requires 15 kg. of nitrogen. Since natural 
nitrogen contained in the soil is not enough to get good 
yield, its shortage must be compensated for with 
fertilizer. However, minute care must be taken in 
applying fertilizer when growing Indica varieties, for 
these varieties absorb ammonium sulphate just as 
quickly as nitrogen; the application of 100 lb. of 
ammonium sulphate per acre (equal to one-third of 
its average application for the Japonica type) will 
cause them to fall prostrate. The application of fer-

tilizer, therefore, requires as much study and attention 
as the selection of rice species. 
. Japanese Methods and Technique- for 
Rice Cultivation, 
In fertilizing the Asian lands, Japan can offer 
assistance of great value, for instance, th cough ex-
porting fertilizer to other Asian countries, and 
co-operating with them in the project of constructing 
fertilizer plants. The only set-backs in th Is connec-
tion are that Japanese fertilizer is just at present 
more highly priced than that produced by other 
advanced countries, and that Japan has not yet 
surpassed Western countries in the tee qnique of 
fertilizer production. Nevertheless, there is always 
a vast field of activity open for Japan's fertilizer 
industry and for its experts as well as echnicians 
to take part in the great project of fert lizing the 
land of Asia. 
Furthermore, Japan leads the work: in rice-
growing technique and methods. Her supe-iority has 
resulted from far-reaching land survey an .t untiring 
fertilizer application tests. She can, there3 ore, assist 
and co-operate with other Asia nations in these fields. 
Frist of all, in order to increase their rice produc-
tion, the cultivation of Japanese paddy-rice :s strongly 
recommended. The Japanese paddy-rice varieties, 
though not suitable to all the Asian countries, 
can meet most of the vital requirements; 4E1), with its 
superior properties, it will contribute largely to the 
expansion of agricultural production in A Ia. (Table

In order to impart the notable properties of 
Japanese paddy-rice to other Asian varieties, the 
Japonica and the Indica varieties must be crossed. 
The hybridization is not simple, but not impossible. 
In fact, the United Nations' Food and Agricultural 
Organization (FAO) has sponsored a project of this 
nature at a laboratory. in India. Since the world's 
recognition has been accorded to Japan for her 
indefatigable effort to improve rice species by means 
of repeated crossing and selection, her experience, as 
well as technical knowledge in this line, will be 
indispensable in the project of increasing rice produc-
tion of other Asian countries. 
The application of fertilizer and the selection of 
rice varieties are both basic requisites, but not all 
the requisites, for rice cultivation. Equally important 
are the technical measures needed to fight against

pests and diseases ruinous to rice crops. Japanese 
farmers spray parathion against rice-borers, and 
ceresan lime dust against rice blast. The practice 
of using insecticides requires some technical knowl-
edge of various agricultural chemicals; their misap-
plication will cause irreparable damage to agricultural 
crops. For that, the farmers in Asian countries are 
advised to resort to the safer methods of enlisting 
the aid of natural enemies to exterminate noxious 
insects and diseases of rice plants. Again, on this 
specific subject, Japan has made an assiduous study 
for years past; and whatsoever knowledge, technique 
and methods she has acquired are at the service of 
rice cultivators in other Asian countries. 
A sort of physiological disease, known by the name 
of "mentic," has been plaguing the growth of rice 
plants for some time in Malaya, Indonesia, Ceylon 
and some other Southeast Asian countries. The 
mentic, like the similar disease of akioch: (under-
nourishment) or root-rot in Japan, is caused by the 
shortage of oxygen in the soil. In this case, the 
application of ammonium sulphate, containing sul-
phuric acid, will aggravate the condition. Japan's 
study of these diseases is far-reaching and advanced, 
with counter-measures most effectively worked out. 
As the first of the counter-measures, irrigation works 
are suggested; but, as make-shift measures, the ap-
plication of fertilizer containing no sulphuric acid, 
such as nitro-lime or ammonium chloride. or the 
building of ridges, or the draining of the fields, will 
greatly reduce the extent of damage "caused by these 
diseases. Japan's advanced knowledge and methods 
in this connection will be unquestionably useful in

Asia. 
As the application of fertilizer stimulates the 
growth of weeds, the methods of weeding constitute 
another important factor in rice cultivation. Of the 
three different methods of weeding practised largely 
by Japanese farmers, viz. hand-weeding, the use of 
weeders, and the application of weed-killers, the 
second method, the use of weeders, is recommendable, 
for some practical knowledge is needed in applying 
agricultural chemicals for the purpose. Now, the use 
of weeders requires check-rowing. This is the method 
of growing rice plants, which the Japanese farmers 
have adopted from ancient times. Check-rowing is 
almost necessary for the uniform ?growth of rice 
plants. The use of modern agricultural implements. 
has of late necessitated the widening of distance 
between the rows, and the placing of rice plants 
closer to each other. In this way, the roots of rice 
plants are free to spread between the rows, and can 
absorb fertilizer better and longer. This type of 
check-rowing, if adopted, will prove to be definitely 
advantageous in unfertile land or in land where fer-
tilizer has been sparingly used, as is the case with 
most of the Southeast Asian countries. 
Japanese rice-cultivating ability is often criticized 
as being nothing but dense planting and exorbitant 
application of fertilizer. This criticism, although it 
has some truth in it, does not do justice to Japanese 
farming, which involves divergent advanced techniques 
indispensable for fighting lodging, insect damage, 
rank weeds, the root-rot disease, akiochi and so forth. 
In addition, Japanese farmers use every possible 
discretion in adapting rice-planting to environmental 
conditions. They do not always adhere to dense

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
planting; when land, seeds, and so on, can meet all 
the requirements for a vigorous plant growth, they 
adopt sparse planting. When there exist scme factors 
arresting the growth of plants, they carry out dense 
planting. In cold areas, they adopt methods to 
stimulate the growth of young seedling,;, whereas 
they devise means to slow down the growth of 
seedlings in warm areas. In some spuific areas 
which are exposed to frequent typhoon damage, early-
maturing, medium-maturing and late-maturing rice 
varieties are combined, or planting p, aiods are 
adjusted, so as to minimize the possibl damage. 
They take especial care in aPplying the fertilizer best 
suited to the land. In warm areas, they use mainly 
coarse organic fertilizer, such as compost and 
barnyard manure, granular or compound fertilizers. 
When planting seedlings in cold areas, they even make 
an effort to raise the temperature of water in paddies 
by means of changing the position of irrigation 
water gates, or using water warmed ti, rough ex-
tending the length of an irrigation water-way. Such 
techniques as these, fully developed and tested by 
Japanese farmers may be used to most excellent 
advantage in the rice cultivation of any other country 
in Southeast Asia and the Near East. 
4. Land Readjustment 
However beneficial technology may be, the land 
is the basic factor in rice cultivation. That the land 
must be kept in the best condition is the primary 
requisite for agricultural industry. In this respect, 
the readjustment of land and roads, and the improve-
44

AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA 
ment of irrigation facilities are equally important. 
It is encouraging to learn that the United Nations' 
FAO and the ICA (International Cooperation Admin-
istration) attach priority to this kind of project, as 
well as to the construction of dams. Japan cannot 
assist financially in this matter, but is able to offer 
her valuable technical co-operation and assistance in 
abundance. Land readjustment has made remarkable 
progress in Japan through many years in the past; 
and yet it is far from satisfactory today. Therefore, 
Asian countries are advised to persevere in this en-
deavor until the goal is finally reached. 
In . regard to upland farming, Japan has no 
specific technique, other than careful selection of 
varieties and application of suitable fertilizer. 
Geologic diversification in Asia may not permit 
farmers in other Asian countries always to adopt 
the Japanese fertilizing technique, yet much room is 
left for them to study and experiment in this. In 
places where cattle raising is carried on, the barnyard 
manure, or compost, is used mostly for cash crops, 
such as cotton, jute, vegetables, fruits, and so on. 
Now, if the application of a mixture of barnyard 
manure and chemical fertilizer is adopted, it will 
undoubtedly increase production in upland farming. 
Another important requisite for upland farming 
is preservation of the soil; methods must be ?studied 
to prevent erosion, and contour or terrace farming 
may become necessary. Importance may be attached 
also to the cultivation of forage crops, which are 
useful in enriching land, as well as in improving 
cattle raising. 
? In vegetable cultivation, of which Japan is justly 
proud, her highly advanced technique and methods,

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
such as adopted of nucleus seed-increasin2;, will be 
of great help to farmers in Asian courtries. In 
sericulture, tobacco cultivation and tea production, 
as well as in the manufacture of agricultural imple-
ments, Japanese technique will undoubtedly contribute 
to the increased production in these sphere ; of Asian 
agriculture. 
5. Agricultural Education 
The majority of peasants in Asia are inured to 
Poverty. Under-nourished and weak, they are too 
enervated to work with zeal. In order to increase 
agricultural productivity, they must, first of all, eat 
more and work harder. 
-Unlike Japanese farmers who are granted gov-
ernment subsidies for their enterprises, stch as the 
construction of irrigation works, or land readjustment, 
the farmers in other Asian countries must carry out 
their enterprises without government aid. Should 
sufficient government protection be provided, they 
would settle down in peace and enjoy their work. 
Meantime, some supervisory organ might be 
established with government fund to encourage the 
induction of advanced agricultural techn Eque from 
abroad, and to carry out the more syitematized 
application of such imported technique and methods. 
Meantime, the intellectual faculties of tho farmers 
may be improved through the propagation of agricul-
tural education throughout Asia. 
If Asian countries consider it n ssary to 
develop themselves as agricultural states, 1. hey must, 
at least for some time to come, attacl- primary

AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN ASIA 
importance to the education of their farming popula-
tion. Indubitably, European or American agricultural 
education can teach Asians much; however, since 
Japan and other Asian countries have much in 
common, especially in respect to the size of their 
capital and the land available, Japanese agricultural 
education is considered more adaptable to other Asian 
nations. Where production needs must be raised in 
limited areas by means of intensive cultivation and 
the most effective use of land, the Japanese agricul-
tural technique serves the purpose almost to perfection. 
Conclusion 
Agricultural colleges and research institutes have 
been founded in most of the Asian countries. With 
the adoption of advanced technique in their experi-
mental cultivation they have succeeded in raising the 
crops 2 - 3 times :higher than the average crops 
harvested by ordinary farming households. In rice 
cultivation, the application of chemical fertilizer, as 
well as the check-rowing, is widely practised in a 
manner very similar to the Japanese way of farming. 
Despite such a development, production by the average 
farming households still remains low. 
Judged from the study made on the recent 
inspection tour of the prevalent conditions in 13 
Asian countries, the present writer attributes this 
unfavorable development to the poor follow-up of the 
extension of useful technique and methods among 
farmers in general. In other words, most of 
these countries have an almost perfect system set up 
for extension, except that proper activity and zeal

Approved For Release 2003/04/02 : CIA-RDP8OR01731R000200100011-1 
CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
are lacking in the actual extension work. This 
defect, however, can be amended, when the experts 
and research workers are made to realize tJ ie greater 
importance of such technique and methods as are 
certain to be practicable among average farmers, and 
when the extension workers become sufficiently 
trained to convince the farmers of the a iciency of 
the new mode of farming. 
Taking such facts into consideration. Japan's 
technical co-operation should be conducted with em-
phasis laid upon assistance in the training of those 
extension workers. For that specific purpose, the 
best measure to be suggested will be a dispatch of 
a group of Japanese experts in the different fields 
of seed selection, cultivation, soil and fertilizer, pre-
vention of insect and disease damage, use of farming 
implements, etc., to the training centers in various 
Asian countries, so that these experts mai instruct 
extension workers both in knowledge and . In experi-
mentation of advanced technique and methods. The 
grouping of experts to be dispatched may depend on 
the conditions prevalent in the recipient countries. 
For instance, in Ehtiopia and Afghanistan, the focal 
point of instruction must be placed on experimental 
training, whereas in Pakistan, actual training is more 
needed than experiment. Later on, this course of 
training may be expanded to cover seed improvement, 
irrigation, sericulture, cattle raising, and so forth. 
Meanwhile, government officials and e \tperts of 
Burma, Thailand and Indonesia may be invited to 
inspect Japan's modern farming, and an exchange of 
agricultural experts and technicians may be organized 
between this country and Egypt, as well as India. 
It is urgently necessary to maintain close co-ordina-

ELECTIONS AND CABINET 
RESHUFFLE 
By FUMIO IKEMATSU 
THE PRESENT YEAR, 1959, IS MARKED IN JAPAN AS 
the year of elections. The unified loct- 1 elections 
were held throughout this country on April 23 
and 30, followed by the election on June 2, for one 
half of the members of the House of Councillors. 
The unified local elections consisted of ele-tions for 
20 prefectural governors, members of preft ctural as-
semblies, heads and assembly members of cities, 
towns and villages, selecting in all some 48, )00 public 
officials for local legislative posts. The tern i of office 
for the members of the House of Councii lors is 6 
years, one half of the total number of its members 
being elected every three years periodically. Returned 
to the House in the recent election were 127 mem-
bers, 52 from the national constituency and 75 from 
the local constituencies. 
Both the local elections and the electio ,1 for the 
House of Councillors being the first of ti eir kinds 
since the two-party politics went into practice, the 
focal point of interest lhy in ascertaining how the 
adoption of the new political system would la reflected 
in the elections, and to what extent the Social 
Democratic Party, under the new system, would 
succeed in narrowing the margin between itself and 
the Liberal-Democratic Party. The outcon, e of the

elections, however, revealed the fact that the power 
of the two major political parties infiltrated all the 
elections so extensively that it even gave rise to the 
fear lest the autonomous nature of local administra-
tion, as well as the specific character of the House 
of Councillors, should be imperilled by the upheavals 
of political contention. Then, contrary to the general 
pre-election speculation, the Socialists' advance was 
arrested, to the extent that they barely secured one-
third of the seats in the House of Councillors, 
allowing thus the Liberal-Democratic Party to win 
the security of a majority. Likewise, the Socialists' 
defeat was made evident in the results of the guber-
natorial and local elections. As a consequence, the 
Kishi Cabinet, though falling out of favor in public 
opinion, came to enjoy its security, won not on its 
own merit but through the regression suffered by 
the opposition party. 
1. Local Elections. 
Of the local elections, the focal point of public 
interest lay in the gubernatorial elections in Tokyo, 
Osaka, Fukuoka and Hokkaido, where the Socialists 
were believed to have been ensconced in well fortified 
grounds. There, the Socialists were routed from 
their seats, with the exception of a lone victory in 
Fukuoka won by Taichi Uzaki, Socialist candidate, 
over the former Liberal-Democratic governor reportedly 
involved in political scandals. In Tokyo, Independent

of the Amateur Athletic Association and Japanese 
representative of the IOC, with the full support of

the Liberal-Democratic Party won 1,820,A0 votes, 
defeating Socialist sponsored Hachiro Ari- a, former 
Foreign Minister, by a notable margin or 170,000; 
while, Gisen Sato, formerly State Minister and Direc-
tor of the Defense Agency in the Liberal-Democratic 
Cabinet, won the election in Osaka, defeating 
Tadayoshi Obata, Social Democratic candidate by a 
narrow margin of 23,000. The gubernatorial post 
of Hokkaido, held by the Socialists for the past nine 
years running, was won for the first time since 
the end of the last war by a Liberal-Democratic 
candidate, King? Machimura. 
The political alignment of newly elected 20 
prefectural governors is 4 Liberal-Democrats, 8 con-
servatives, 1 Social Democrat, 2 progressives and 5 
independents. When they are added to the 26 
governors who had remained in their posts, the 
political alignment among them shows 32 conserva-
tives versus 6 socialists with 8 independents. (Table I)

ELECTIONS AND CABINET RESHUFFLE 
Ordinarily, local election campaigns are conducted 
with the focal point set on the welfare of local 
communities, and in conformity with the basic 
principles of local autonomy, so that the candidates 
do not wish, in most cases, to make public their 
affiliation, if any, with political parties. In the 
recent elections, however, the headquarters of both 
the Liberal-Democratic Party and the Social Demo-
cratic Party played active parts with such enthusiasm 
as has never been witnessed before. The Liberal-
Democratic leaders, headed by Prime Minister Kishi, 
were all out in the front line, while the Social 
Democratic Party mobilized all its members under 
the leadership of its Chairman, Mosaburo Suzuki. 
The final tabulation of the elections for pre-
fectural assemblies registers an increase of Liberal-
Democrats from 1,200 to 1,597, of the Social 
Democrats from 426 to 565, and Communists from 
10 to 12. In sharp contrast to this increase among 
the politically affiliated assembly members, the number 
of both the independents and the members of minor 
parties decreased noticeably from 977 to 582. This 
decrease in the number of non-partizan representatives 
evinces the fact that the practice of two-party politics 
has made its way even among local communities. 
Apprehension is expressed on the current tendency 
lest the vigorous political struggle, thus reflected in 
local communal life, should finally interfere with the 
proceedings of local administration, such as the 
construction of school buildings, the repair work of 
river banks, and so on. (Table II)

sives and 173 others. 
That the Liberal-Democratic influence, let alone 
its strong hold over farming, forestry arid fishing 
villages, came to assert itself even in large cities 
and mining areas was made manifest in the line-up 
of recently elected heads and assembly members of 
cities, towns and villages. The influence of the 
Social Democratic Party has hitherto been likened 
to an "inverted pyramid," mainly for its having an 
insecure narrow foothold among local communities, 
in spite of its significant occupation of on ,-third of 
the seats in both Houses. However, through the 
recent mayoralty election, the tapering base of that 
inverted pyramid, it seems, was somewhat broad-
ened, as the number of socialist and progressive 
mayors increased from 21 to 39, over against an 
insignificant increase from 126 to 127 gained by the 
conservatives. A similar tendency for the increased 
Social Democratic influence had been othlerved in 
the prefectural assembly election in some pi efectures, 
of which a good example was presented in Fukuoka, 
where the socialist candidates won a notable victory

over their conservative rivals. Nevertheless, the 
percentages of votes won in the prefectural assembly 
election were 65.1% for the conservatives and 
29.2 for the socialists. As for the election for 
city assemblies, the total number of elected members 
approximates 10,000 including 1,300 Liberal-Demo-
crats, 1,000 Social Democrats, 169 Communists, and 
some 8,000 independents, of which an overwhelm-
ing majority are avowed conservatives. Again, 
the marked advance achieved by both the Liberal-
Democratic and the Social Democratic members, 
above the predicted 600 and 500 respectively, 
indicates the widely penetrating influence of the two 
major political parties among local communities.

2. Election for the House of Councillors. 
The election for the House of Counci lors took 
place almost a month after the local elect ons. The 
voting percentages in the local elections wure unpre-
cedentedly high, with 79.5 % achieved in the guber-
natorial election on April 23. In the election for the 
House of Councillors, however, it fell to 58.8 % ; 
this unexpected fall by 20 % in voting percentage 
within less than one month?a problemat cal issue 
in itself?could possibly be attributed to the fact 
that the public, keen as they were on th( familiar 
ground of local elections, failed to show f iterest in 
the election that followed at a month's int( rval. Or, 
it might be ascribable partly to the fact that the 
election coincided with the busy season an: ong agri-
cultural communities, and partly to the fact that the 
platforms of the two contesting political pa-- ties were 
by no means clearly presented to the public. Or, it 
was more likely that this fall in voting percentage 
was caused by the doubt which the public e ,Aertained 
about the system of the House of Counci hors, and 
also by the complicated proceedings of election 
involved.* Anyhow, of the total number ( f eligible 
voters, estimated at 53,520,000, more than 132,000,000 
*At the time of local elections held on April 23, th number of 
eligible voters was 49,762,112 (including 23,824,356 men aid 25,937,756 
women) ; those who went to the polls numbered 39,551,8(r, (19,161,328 
men and 20,390,477 women), registering the average vo tin ; percentage 
at 79.48%. In the election for the House of Councillors held on June 2, 
the voting percentage was 58.74%, with 31,436,851 (16,1 22,117 men 
and 15,414,734 women) voting out of the total number of c ligible voters 
registered as 53,516,487 (25,610,986 men and 27,905,5)1 women).

failed to go to the polls, in spite of the fact that 
vigorous encouragement activities had been launched 
by the competent authorities. 
A few words may be necessary to explain the 
doubt with which the general public regards the 
House of? Councillors. The House was nominally 
established as a supervisory organ in the national 
legislative structure. Nevertheless, the members re-
turned to the House through the elections in the 
past have been mostly die representatives of trade 
unions of nation-wide influence, or those elected with 
the support from either bureaucratic or industrial 
organizations of national importance, with the result 
that the House of Councillors has now assumed the 
.coloring of, so, to speak, an assembly of vocational 
representatives. For that reason, the confrontation 
of interests there has grown more and more conspicu-
ous, followed by a political struggle more violent than 
that seen in the House of Representatives. In the 
initial stage of its founding, the House of Councillors 
was expected to have its members elected from among 
men of learning and experience with unassailable na-
tional reputation. As it is, the House seems to have 
lost the power to carry out its original function 
to "check and balance" the legislative procedure. 
However, any reform in the system of the House 
of Councillors requires constitutional revision, and 
such constitutional revision is hardly possible under 
the current political situation. Furthermore, the elec-
tional procedure currently in force to select just one 
candidate out of 120 or more in the national con-
stituency is not at all a duty to be fulfilled easily 
by the average voter. This, in all probability, con-
stituted the direct cause for the exceedingly low

voting percentage registered in the reck nt election 
for the House of Councillors. 
In summary, the results of the elect on for the 
House of Councillors indicated a decisive victory for 
the Liberal-Democratic Party, disclosing the Social 
Democrats' regression as being far worse than it was 
ever imagined. In the local constituencies where the 
conservative influence was predominant, the Liberal-
Democrats won 49 out of the total 75 returns, while 
the Social Democrats managed to secure oily 21; the 
members of the uncompromising Ryokufuka decreased 
to 2, and the independents to 3. Most notable in 
this connection was the complete defeat suffered by 
the Socialist candidates in Tokyo, where a female 
member of the Sokagaku-kai, a non-politic I religious 
organization, won the largest number of votes, fol-
lowed closely by Fusae Ichikawa, veteran 4uffragist; 
and the two Liberal-Democrats took the remaining 
third and fourth posts, while the thl ee Social 
Democrats topped the list of unsuccessful candidates. 
In the national constituency even, where the 
Socialists ordinarily held fairer prospects, the total

Party itself before the election. 
Over against the increase of Liberal- Democratic 
and Social Democratic members in the Hot, se, mainly 
on the strength of two-party politics, the independents 
and the Ryokufukai members decreased in number 
considerably ( even when those elected for vacancies 
are taken into calculation) . These electi on results 
indicate that the campaigns carried out by the central 
and regional offices of the two major political parties 
left no room for non-partizan candidates. Since the 
recent election for the House of Count illors was 
regarded, in a way, as significant as an interim 
election, the failure on the part of the Lib, ral-Demo-
eratic Party to secure a majority wou1d, in all 
probability, expose the Kishi Cabinet to i rebuttal 
from the anti-Kishi faction, as well as to severe 
public criticism, and thereby create political insta-
bility of no small concern. So vitally important was 
the last election that the Government and its party 
devoted their utmost efforts to the carnpair n, taking 
great discretion in every possible way; for instance, 
in adjusting the candidates' assignment, they went 
so far as to refuse official recognition to the former 
cabinet members. They mobilized some 161) organi-
zations to counter the labor front of it e Social 
Democratic Party. 
There is no question that the Liberal-Dornocratic 
Party scored a vital point in its choice of election 
strategy. The Socialist regression was largcly attrib-
utable to the fact that the majority of the nation 
has lost confidence in the character and polioy of the 
Social Democratic Party. Shortly before tin election, 
the Party's Secretary General, Inejiro Asant, Ina, then 
visiting Peiping, stated in a joint commun ique that

ELECTIONS AND CABINET RESHUFFLE 
"American imperialism" was "a common enemy" 
to Japan and Communist China. This statement 
awakened a doubt amongst the public lest the Social 
Democratic Party, though flying its old banner of 
neutrality, might not be seeking rapprochement with 
the Communist bloc. 
Regarding the controversial issue of revision of 
the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the Social Democratic 
Party assumes a foolhardy attitude, insisting on its 
complete abolition, while the general opinion today 
is inclined to acknowledge such justifiable revision as 
is necessary to render this treaty, concluded under 
the Occupation, more adaptable to the current condi-
tion of the country. Moreover, the Party fails to 
offer any convincing answer to the question of 
national defense which will arise following the aboli-
tion of the treaty. 
The unanimous opinion of the public is that the 
victory won recently by the Liberal-Democratic Party 
is not a victory in the true sense of the word, but 
an outcome incidental to the weakening in the Socialist 
camp, and that the Party, taking that fact into 
consideration, should refrain from resorting to any 
dictatorial actions. The fact is evident in the unex-
pected emergence into prominence of the Sokagaku-kai, 
a religious body adhering to the Nichiren sect, which 
succeeded in returning 6 candidates in the recent 
election. Now, the representatives of this organization, 
including those elected previously, number 9 in total 
in the House of Councillors. Another noteworthy fact 
is that Masanobu Tsuji, who had been expelled from 
the Liberal-Democratic Party for throwing a threat 
of impeachment at Prime Minister Kishi in the Diet, 
and who had given up his membership in the House

of Representatives on his own volition, wo) the third 
place with 680,000 votes in the national constituency 
in the recent election. All these and many other 
similar facts point to the public distrust in politics. 
In short, the overall results of the election for 
the House of Councillors brought about little change 
in the balance of power alignment between the two 
major political parties, even though it produced 
adverse effects on the third power. Nevertheless, 
it is obvious that the House has come to assume a 
stronger political coloring, in addition to being sub-
ordinated to various pressure groups. With he marked 
decline in neutral power, the House may fall a prey 
to a worse political struggle than ever st ,n in the 
House of Representatives. The public, apprehensive 
of such an unfortunate possibility, expects the Liberal-
Democratic Party to exercise discretion in rocognizing 
and respecting the true nature of the missio, assigned 
to the House of Councillors. 
3. Cabinet Reshuffle 
Immediately following the local election and the 
election for the House of Councillors, where the 
Liberal-Democratic Party won a decisivr victory, 
Prime Minister Kishi carried out a completo reshuffle 
of his Cabinet, involving the replacement of the entire 
Cabinet members, with the exception of the Prime 
Minister himself, and two Ministers, Foreigri Minister 
Fujiyama and Finance Minister Sato, the former for 
the reason that the negotiations for revising the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was not yet completed, 
and the latter for pursuing the same line of finance

ELECTIONS AND CABINET RESHUFFLE 
Policy. As almost all the members in the Cabinet 
were replaced, this reorganization was more like the 
birth of a new Cabinet rather than a reshuffle in 
the ordinary sense of the term. 
As a preliminary step for this reshuffle, the 
Prime Minister planned a line-up of the three most 
influencial members of his party, namely, Hayato 
Ikeda as Secretary General, Ichiro Kono as Chairman 
of the Executive Committee, and Eisaku Sato as Chair-
man of the Political Affairs Investigation Committee, 
of the Liberal Democratic Party. The Prime Minister 
failed in this endeavor, however, since these three 
are avowed rivals for the next premiership. There-
Upon, he tried another plan, and succeeded, with 
assistance from Finance Minister Sato, his brother, 
in _inviting Hayato Ikeda, leader of the anti-Kishi 
faction, to take the post of Minister of International 
Trade and Industry in his new Cabinet. 
Now that the Prime Minister has worked out a 
successful coalition with antagonistic Ikeda, he 
has to forego a close alliance with Ichiro Kono, his 
henchman. and influential leader of the Kishi, or the 
so-called main, faction in the Liberal-Democratic Party. 
The change introduced into the line-up of the 
Cabinet members is significant in that it represents 
a change in the character of the Cabinet, as well 
as in the power distribution maintained within the 
Liberal-Democratic Party. As both Ikeda and Sato 
cut prominent figures in the Yoshida Cabinet once, 
the new Kishi Cabinet is often criticised as the 
sixth Yoshida Cabinet. 
The leadership in the Liberal-Democratic Party 
is held by the aforementioned Ikeda, Kono, Sato and 
Miki. Not that there are no senior members in the

Party, but that these four men each considers himself 
pretender for presidency of the Party in succession 
to Kishi. Now, as a result of the recent reshuffle, 
both Kono and Miki drifted away from the main 
current in the Party. The obvious chang- brought 
into the alignment of factions within the Party, 
however, does not necessarily signify any waning in 
Prime Minister Kishi's leadership. 
As explained by the Prime Minister in his speech 
delivered before the 32nd extraordinary session of 
the Diet in June, no major change is em isaged in 
Japan's basic foreign policy, since both Foreign Min-
ister Fujiyama and Finance Minister Sato remained 
in posts unaffected by the recent reshuffle. However, 
as Ikeda, new member of the Cabinet, at--;erts the 
importance of discretion to be exercised in working 
out the revision of the U.S.-Japan Securit Treaty, 
his influence will undoubtedly cause some delay in 
both the signing and the ratification of such revision. 
He is of the opinion that the nation should be 
fully informed of the necessity for such revision, 
before its signing takes place. 
The basic policy of the new Cabinet as outlined 
by the Prime Minister includes the aforei ientioned 
revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the adop-
tion of more positive economic measures, and the 
revision of the Election Law. Assuming that the 
current favorable economic trend will con inue its 
development at the present rate, the nationt I income 
ten years hence will be doubled. In order tc promote 
this possible economic development with the goal set 
at the doubled national income, the adoption of some 
positive economic measures become a requisite for 
removing possible obstacles from the path of economic

development. This policy, though domestic by nature, 
must be put into execution through increased foreign 
trade and industry. 
The revision of the Election Law, long discussed, 
involves a large number of problems, such as the 
exhorbitant election funds, the over-vigorous election 
campaigns, etc. 
Prime Minister Kishi left Tokyo on July 11 for 
a month's tour in Europe and Central and South 
America. Meantime, little change is expected to take 
place in the political field until next spring, when the 
ratification of the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security 
Treaty will be deliberated in the Diet, with strong 
opposition put up by the entire Socialist front led by 
the Social Democratic Party.

brief mention was made of a strong opposition 
raised during 1952 by the SocialLA Party and 
the organized workers of Japan against the peace 
about to be concluded at San Francisco. Seven years 
have passed since then, but as yet the force of that 
opposition seems in no sense to have diminished. 
Efforts to amend the more disputable parts of the 
peace scheme were begun already in 1953 by the then 
Foreign Minister, late Shigemitsu. It would seem 
that the efforts continued by Mr. Fujiyama, Foreign 
Minister in the Kishi Cabinet, are bearing fruit with 
conclusion of a revised Security Treaty in the course 
of the present year (1959). Furious opposition, 
however, is raging throughout the islands of Japan 
at present. General strikes are being scheduled by 
the trade unions and for the moment it would seem 
that the exact outcome of the controversy is unfore-
seeable. What really accounts for tht tenacity of

the opposition? 
As the principal party involved or interested in 
the peace structure of San Francisco is the United 
States naturally, anyon.e criticizing or raising opposi-
tion to it is apt to be branded as "anti-American" 
or "pro-communist," or even as "communist" indis-
criminately. This is unfortunate if the Western world 
(or the United States) is wishing either that the 
Japanese people would become loyal defenders of de-
mocracy, or that Japan would rearm and thereby turn 
into an effective partner in a military alliance. At 
this stage of our inquiry, the following statement of 
a Western scholar, who has spent long years of his 
life in Japan and made a penetrating study of the 
impact of the United States' policies on Japan in 
the postwar peripd, deserves careful attention. "We 
should not forget," he says, 
"that no matter how feasible it would be to make Japan our 
military ally, it probably could not be done without seriously 
endangering Japanese democracy. In view of Japan's strong 
militaristic tradition and the record of recent history in which 
the Japanese army played the leading role in scuttling the young 
and still very imperfect democratic institutions of prewar Japan, 
it would be too much to hope that Japan could be both a military 
and an ideological ally. As the former, she might render the 
United States valuable aid, if war were to come in the next few 
years; but she would unquestionably render us a greater disservice 
by driving the rest of Asia away from us and presumably into 
the other camp. As an ideological ally, she could be of inestimable 
value in strengthening the cause of democracy throughout Asia." (8)

States, propose to take? This is a pe rtinent ques-
tion which requires a forthright answer from anyone 
who seeks honestly to discover the reason for the 
tenacity of opposition of Japanese w pi-kers' trade 
unions to the peace structure of San Ft ancisco. 
Prima facie, there should be no reason why any 
Japanese should object to conclusion of peace if the 
sole effect of it were to restore to Japan a status of 
independence or to ensure peace and secqrity for the 
Japanese nation. But, as a matter of fact, opposi-
tion arose first with the discovery that the peace to 
be concluded at San Francisco consisted not of a sin-
gle peace treaty, but of two treaties, one a peace 
treaty and the other a mutual security pact. After 
a glance over the text of the two treaties, suspicion 
arose in the minds of the leaders of the trade union 
and socialist movements, that the security pact was 
in the nature of a military alliance into which Japan 
under the Peace Constitution of 1946 con Id not enter. 
Moreover, the fear grew in the minds of those leaders 
that in the proposed peace scheme of San Francisco, 
after signature of the two treaties, the status of Japan 
would not be one of complete independence or equality 
with the United States. By entering into a military 
alliance with the United States, Japan, they feared, 
might only antagonize the great neighbors on the 
Asian Continent who are under the communist regime. 
Instead of promising more peace and security for 
Japan, the security pact, they feared, might only 
heighten the chances of Japan's involvement in future 
wars in the Far East. 
On account of these fears or suspicions, during 
the month of March, 1951, already the Socialist Party 
voiced its objection to the proposed peace, followed by

Sohyo which adopted at its second annual convention 
of 1951 a declaration denouncing the proposed peace. 
Major national federations of workers' unions cover-
ing the basic industries of Japan adopted individually, 
one after another, resolutions opposing the peace of 
San Francisco. Despite these objections, however, the 
two treaties were duly signed on September 8, 1951, 
ratified on September 18, 1951, and entered into effect 
on April 28, 1952. 
Main criticisms that have been raised against the 
Security Treaty may be summarized roughly under 
three or four heads. The first and chief criticism was 
that this imposes a military alliance which the Peace 
Constitution of 1946 would disallow Japan to enter.(91 
Irretrievable wrong can be committed by anyone in 
a position of authority, if in a hurry an attempt is 
made by him merely to silence those people who, dread-
ing genuinely the resurgence of militarism or military 
spirit in Japan, oppose measures which are liable to 
lead to rearmament of the nation. The second criti-
cism is that the Security Treaty is a unilateral or 
unequal treaty. Under the provisions of Article 1 of 
the Treaty, the United State's can, but is nowhere re-
quired to use her troops stationed in Japan to defend 
Japan whereas Japan is placing her territory at their 
disposal with the right to set up military, air and 
naval bases of the U.S. troops. Whether or not to 
use the U.S. troops for the defense of Japan in an 
(9) Whether foreign (United States) troops can be stationed 
in the territory of Japan without infringing the Constitution is cur-
rently under dispute. The matter came to a head in December, 1938, 
as the Tokyo District Court acquitted the men who had been arrested 
for trespassing a military base of the U.S. Force, declaring that the 
special penal law making such trespassing a crime was invalid, being 
unconstitutional in itself. The matter is now before the Supreme Court.

emergency is optional to the United States. Thirdly, 
under the same article, the bombers of the U.S. Air 
Force might fly from their bases in Japan for attack-
ing a third power without the knowledge of Japan. 
That would inevitably invite the enemy planes to bomb-
ard Japan, which obviously is a risk too big for Japan 
to take. Under such a treaty, Japan is placed under 
more danger than if she had not concluded such a 
treaty. Fourthly, the critics point out that under 
Article 2, the United. States has the prior rights re-
garding the disposition of its troops, -rime of bases, 
etc. in Japan, and Japan is disallowed from accord-
ing the same rights to any other country without the 
consent of the United States, thereby placing Japan 
virtually in a position subservient to the United 
States. Another criticism somewhat sin, liar to this 
one is addressed to Article 4 by the critics. Under 
the provisions of this article, Japan can be kept under 
the disadvantages of the treaty indefinitely, because 
the consent of the United States is required for 
abrogation of the treaty. (10) 
V. SOHYO'S RISE TO POWER 
In their classic and monumental work on trade 
unionism written sixty five years ago, Sidney and 
Beatrice Webb, in describing the growing strength 
of workers' unions, were already using the expres-
(10) Recognizing the various defects in the existing treaty, For-
eign Minister Fujiyama after several months of negotintion with the 
United States, succeeded in revising the treaty on a ntunber of crucial 
points. Nevertheless, the position either of the SocialiA Party or of 
Sohyo in their opposition to the treaty has remained unchanged. They 
are urging a total abrogation of the treaty.

sion(n) "state within state." During World War I, 
the identical expression in French "l'etat dans l'etat" 
was being used in France with reference to the syndi-
calist unionism. More recently, after World War II, 
we hear in Germany 'of the use of the German phrase 
"Stoat fiber Staat" with reference to the German trade 
union federation DGB (Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund). 
In the case of Germany, this might already have been 
true in the prewar days before Hitler. In any case, 
ascendency to power of the organized labor forces, 
whether one likes it or not, would seem to be a uni-
versal phenomenon. 
Japan is only a late arrival, relatively speaking, 
on the scene of modern industrialism. With the as- ? 
cendency to power of Sohyo, however, the time has 
come, or is drawing near, when its tremendous strength 
has to be reckoned with in its true proportions, al-
though it may be premature to look upon this as a 
"state within state." In any case, because of the 
increasing role which Sohyo has begun to play in the 
industrial and economic relations in the years follow-
ing the Korean war, due space has to be given to a 
description of this organization of trade unions. 
The history of Japan is no less ironical than that 
of Europe. As already mentioned, Sohyo was in a 
sense the godchild or offspring of the American Oc-
cupation. It started with the kindly blessings of the 
officers of GHQ. The irony lies in that it was this 
same Sohyo which, in a year after its birth, seemed 
to turn round and lead national movements opposing 
the peace scheme of San Francisco. Some one describ-

ing the unexpected turn of events aptly used the old 
Japanese expression: "Instead of a lovely chicken, 
when hatched, it turned out to be an ugly duck." 
It may be recalled that Sohyo (an abbreviation 
of the long official title Nippon Rodo K miai Soh yogi 
Kai or General Council of Japanese Trade Unions) 
was first inaugurated less than a month after the out-
break of the Korean war, on July 11, 1950, comprizing 
29 unions with the total membership fig-, Ire of 2,760,-
000. They were the unions which had Leen active in 
the movement (called Mindo, as explainei in the pre-
vious section of this article) for democratization of 
trade unions since the movement started in February 
1948. There were two outstanding Wool leaders who 
were responsible for the formation of Sohyo, as a 
culmination of the industrial democratization move-
ment. One was Minoru Takano, leader of the left 
wing of Sodomei and the other, Matsuta Hosoya, for-
merly General Secretary of Sanbetsv. or Congress of 
Industrial Unions, and the central figure of the Mindo 
group movement. Frictions within Mind had retard-
ed the progress of the movement till th summer of 
1949, when the split occurred, as alrew ly explained, 
in the World Federation of Trade Uniohs (WFTU). 
When the new world organization, free of Communist 
influence, called International Confedera Lion of Free 
Trade Unions (ICFTU) came into beim); as the re-
sult of that split, the time ripened at law A number 
of the trade unions which had been aching to free 
themselves of Communist infiltration ar d had with-
drawn from Zenro Ren (explained in the previous 
section) now took steps to affiliate with the newly 
formed ICFTU and also to participate in a movement 
to bring about some sort of unity among Japanese

trade unions under the sponsorship of the Federation 
of Private Railway Workers Unions which had hitherto 
remained neutral. All of this meant the paving of the 
way for the appearance of Sohyo on the scene. 
The outbreak of the war in Korea had its imme-
diate repercussion in Japan, first on the Occupation 
authorities and second on the trade unions. There 
was every reason now why the Occupation authorities 
should look with favor upon the industrial democrati-
? zation movement. They were interested in giving their 
moral help and spiritual guidance for the formation 
of a national federation of democratic unions free 
from communist influences. They were interested in 
the affiliation of Japanese workers' unions with ICFTU. 
That was why the order for dissolution descended on 
Zenro Ren, which was the organization aiming to draw 
Japanese unions into the communist dominated WFTU. 
Quite naturally, the Occupation authorities would be 
interested further in seeing the working class in Japan 
give their support to the war in Korea, for them 
a war in defense of democracy. 
? In these circumstances, apparently nobody was 
more disappointed or surprised than the Occupation 
authorities to see the working class in Japan 
led by Sohyo rise against the? peace scheme of San 
Francisco. During the spring of 1951, both the So-
cialist Party of Japan and Sohyo adopted the so-called 
Four Peace Princip1es,(12) in the form of a slogan 
or slogans. The four principles advocated were: 
1. "An overall peace" ?to include not only the United 
States and the Western democracies, but the Soviet 
? (12) At first they were Three Peace Principles, but the Fourth 
was added shortly after. ?

Union, the Peoples Republic of China am the coun-

2. "Absolute neutrality"?not to take sides -vith either 
one or the other of the conflicting ideoloies. 
3. "No military base in Japan"?not to allow any 
military base of any country in Japan. 
4. "No rearmament"?not to rearm Jai an, under 
whatever name, in violation of the Feace Con-
stitution. 
Although these principles were adoptt d both by 
the Socialist Party and at the Conventica of Sohyo 
(March 1951) by a large majority and with great 
enthusiasm, the adoption was not carried vut without 
controversy. The realistically minded m n did not 
agree with the idealists. Some were not interested 
in the lofty, yet unrealistic policies. some were 
"patriotic" and regarded more the nation a interests 
than the humanitarian. For these vario.ts reasons, 
the adoption of these slogans supplied t le occasion 
for the split of both the Socialist Party and Sohyo. 
Those who opposed these slogans, being re dists ready 
to support rearmament or even war, cc astituted a 
small minority of the right within So ?y0. They 
eventually withdrew from Sohyo and fortned in Sep-
tember, 1951, Minroken (Minshu Rodo Irtelo ,Kenkyu 
Kai or Democratic Labor Movement Sti,dy Group) 
which in February of the following year turned into 
Minroren (Minshu Shugi Rodo Undo Re raku Kyogi 
Kai or Coordinating Committee for Democratic Labor 
Movement). It is this group which lat-r in 1954 
organized Zenro, a national labor federatit n as a rival 
of Sohyo, but this has always been a sn4,11 minority.

r? epresented by Sohyo since the Korean war, has been 
preponderant. Emergence, therefore, of Sohyo as a 
dominant force and its behavior in Japan's political 
or economic scene need to be studied more closely. 
As regards the Socialist Party, the peace of San 
Francisco and the adoption of the Four Principles did 
give rise to a fatal cleavage in the party, dividing 
it into the right and left wings, but it did not actually 
split the party. We need only to point out that it 
is the left wing which has taken a rather idealistic 
stand and always held the majority of the member-
ship. 
? VI. INDEPENDENCE OF JAPAN ? ITS 
IMMEDIATE POLITICAL EFFECTS 
Life is strangely replete with paradoxes. Through-
out Asia and Africa, the nations which were under 
the rule of Western colonial empires until recently 
are discovering that life is in no sense easier or less 
arduous after they gained independence and freedom 
than before. Japanese workers might well be con-
sidered older or more mature with longer experience 
of political freedom and industrialism than most Asian 
or African brothers, but this truth of the paradox 
was brought home to them forcibly only by the ex-
periences gained in the years following the independ-
ence which came during the Korean war. The lot 
of the Japanese workers in the years immediately 
following independence seemed to be? particularly a 
hard one, because of the war in Korea. The experi-
ences of that stage will now be reviewed briefly, from 
several different angles: political, economic and

industrial. This will enable us to give a int re or less 
fair appraisal of the reactions, or behavit r, of the 
organized workers of Japan in the difficult years of 
trial, the years 1951-1953. 
Politically, first. The peace was concluded with 
the signature of the two treaties, the Pea+.e Treaty 
and the Mutual Security Treaty, on Nov( tuber 28, 
1951, which came into effect on April 28, 1952, half 
a year after. This, as already mentioned, led to the 
split of the Socialist Party into the right and left 
wings, as it did in the ranks of labor as well. Super-
ficially, the peace treaty signed by fifty nations served 
to establish peace on a firmer basis than ever. The 
peace-offensive of the Soviet Union was ga ;fling mo-
mentum so that it seemed on the surface as if any 
chance of a major war was removed farther and 
farther. However, in reality, the outlook was not so 
bright. For, in application of the provisions of the 
Security Treaty, military, naval and air buses, over 
490 in number, of the United States forces were being 
set up in the four islands of Japan. Tais often 
involved expropriation of the farmlands of the 
peasants who had inherited them from their fore-
fathers. That meant hardship unbearable to those 
peasants in many cases, so that it led to bitter feel-
ings and tenacious opposition, though ineffective, of 
the peasants who would refuse to leave th-ir lands. 
They would sit down in protest on their farmlands 
at the very hour when the troops enter and per-
haps gun shooting practice would commence. Their 
remonstrances would be aided by excited stu, tents and 
youths who oppose rearmament of Japan. Demonstra-
tions were staged, accompanied unfortunately by inci-
dents of violence or bloodshed at times. One might

presume, not without reason, that in these demonstra-
tions, some communists were involved. In any case,' 
however, recurrence of these incidents, accompanied 
by arrests of dozens of young people put the foreign 
troops in a bad light. 
In the meantime, in order partly to cope with 
any contingencies, the Japanese government was 
steadily engaged in strengthening the defense poten-
tials. What was called at the outset "Police Reserve 
Corps" out of shyness or modesty came to be called 
"Self Defense Force," being equipped, now more open-
ly, with, the instruments of warfare including the 
missiles 'of the latest design. One witnessed the pro-
gress of a process wholesale, which none would hesi-
tate to call "rearmament" anywhere except in Japan. 
This was furiously contested by the Socialists and 
trade union leaders under Sohyo at every stage of 
its progress. 
On the other hand, however, it must be recorded 
that the governm ent was not failing in its effort to 
elaborate legislative measures to restrain the subver-
sive and other activities of the Communists, as well 
as other elements which might obstruct the prosecu-
tion of the government's program toward general se-
curity and public peace. Reference has already been 
made to the Ordinance for ,Restriction of Organiza-
tions (Dantai-to Kisei Rei) promulgated in April, 
1949, which was unpopular, being one of the so-called 
"Potsdam Orders." (13) The reactionary program of 
Gyaku KOsu (or reverse course) of the government 
is supposed to have reached its climax in 1952 when,

most unpopular, called generally by abbreviation Ha-
bo Ho (Hakai Katsudo Boshi Ho or Destructive 
Activities Prevention Act) was promulgated on June 
21 of that year (1952). The most unpop&ar law in 
prewar Japan was Chian Iji Ho (Public Peace Pre-
servation Act of 1925). The present law was known 
as the "postwar version" of the same law, -nacted by 
the government after Japan's independence, making 
clear its anti-Communist stand. The avowed inten-
tion of this law was clear and unmistakaVe, but the 
fear in the minds of the people was its abuse, if used 
to curtail even normal activities of a trade union and 
to infringe on basic human rights. 
The opposition to this legislation wa unprece-
dented in its dimensions. Protest demonstn tions were 
carried out on a national scale. On acccunt of its 
relevance to trade unions, this will be tak? n up more 
in detail in the next section of this article. We should 
only mention here that despite the furor which it 
raised, the law was finally enacted; but the govern-
ment, before the promulgation of the law, had to 
make a public pronouncement to the effect that: (1) 
the law will not unduly infringe on people's rights 
or liberty and (2) it will not restrict prop r activities 
of trade unions. Because of the importan 1 nature of 
the legislation, the gist of the law is given below. (14)

status, with the coming into force of the treaties of 
peace and of mutual security, the government went 
ahead ?in August to dissolve the Diet in order to 
ensure the support of the nation in carrying out the 
obligations incumbent on Japan under those treaties. 
As already mentioned, both the Socialist Party and 
Sohyo were split on the issue of the Peace of San 
Francisco. The general election in October, 1952, was 
a test of the extent to which the nation supported 
the government in shouldering the responsibilities un-
der the new peace scheme, including among others 
a program of rearmament of Japan. The conserva-
tive Liberal-Democratic government wished, as it was 
patent from all circumstantial evidences, to secure a 
clear two-third majority in both Houses of the Diet 
in order eventually to amend the Constitution and 
enable the rearmament of Japan, not trespassing on 
but within the orbit of the Constitution. On the other 
? hand, for Sohyo and all organized workers under ifs 
leadership which opposed the peace scheme of San 
Francisco, the general election was a test of the soli-
darity of the progressive elements in the population 
of Japan. It was, therefore, a joyous surprise for 
them to see the unexpected advance of the Socialist 
Party in the Diet in the general election of 1952. 
In the previous general election of 1949, the Socialist 
Party had gained only 48 seats. This time, despite 
zation may be ordered. By "destructive activities" the law means: (1) 
civil war; preparation, plotting or aiding of civil war; inviting or incit-
ing of aid to be given to foreign invasion; printing, distributing, publicly 
displaying, communicating or broadcasting of literature or pictures which 
urge the justification or necessity of invasion; and (2) rioting, arson, use 
of explosives, disturbing or overturning of trains or tramcars, man slaugh-
ter, robbery, disturbance of performance of police duties; preparation, 
plotting, inciting or abetting of the above mentioned acts.

the split of the previous year, the Party gained a 
total of 111 seats ( Left wing 54, Right wing 57 ) . (1-5) 
Another incident, or event, which must be noted 
in the few years immediately following the independ-
ence under the heading of politics, or law, was the 
law, severely criticized as another law of Gycku KOsu, 
known generally by the misleadingly abbrevit ted name 
Suto Kisei Ho ( or Strike Restriction Law) p ?omulgat-
ed in August 1953. The real official titl, of this 
legislation is an inordinately long one whicl_ may be 
literally translated as a "Law concerning the Regu-
lation of the Methods of Dispute-acts in Cod. Mining 
and Electrical Industries." This legislatioL, rushed 
through the Diet amidst an uproar of prot i?sts, was 
passed by way of punishment, and reminds one of the 
British Trade Disputes and Trade Union Ac of 1927 
which was passed as a punitive measure after the 
general strike of 1926. Previous to this I( gislation, 
there were waves of long drawn strikes in both coal 
mining and in electrical industries. In vie w of the 
experiences of those strikes, the law prohi )ited the 
withdrawal, as a dispute-act, of the men stationed 
at posts in coal mines for safety reasons. It also 
prohibited that the men let the water run ( if at the 
source ( dam ) or that they cut off electric current as 
a dispute-act. Was this legislation an infi ingernent 
of the constitutional right to strike or not? The ques-
tion gave rise to much legalistic controversy among

till they rose to 155 in the House of Representatives and 69 i the House 
of Councillors. The left wing leaders of the Socialist P rty and of

opposing both rearmament and the Peace of San Francisc, .

the scholars and trade union leaders in the country. 
On account of the vociferous protests, the government 
yielded temporarily to the pressure and the law con-
sequently went into effect only for the term of three 
years. (16) 
To an outsider at a distance or to students of 
labor reading about the experience of these years in 
Japan some decades hence, laws of this sort would 
surely seem fantastic or absurd. Why laws of this 
nature came to be enacted in Japan must be explained 
by reviewing the behavior of the organized workers 
in the economic and industrial, as well as in the polit-
ical, context of this period. That will be done in the 
ensuing sections of this article.

payment of a fixed penalty in case of violation of 
the Regulation, cases to be tried in tht Consular 
Courts and damages, not fines, to be paid to Japan. 
On February 20, 1878, John Hartley, a British 
subject, was brought before the British Com-ular Court 
in Yokohama, on a charge made by tilt Japanese 
authorities that he had smuggled twenty pounds of 
opium into the port in the December preceding, 
importation of which had been prohibited by all the 
treaties as well as by Japanese laws. The Court 
adjudged him not guilty, on the ground that "medicinal 
opium" was allowed under the Tariff Cor vention of 
1866. Storms of protest arose, not only Irom Japa-
nese, but also from the foreign community. Another 
action was lodged against Hartley for smuggling 
sixteen pounds (12 catties) of opium, and this time 
the British Court found him guilty and punished him 
with a fine at the rate of $15 per catty. 
In 1879, the report of cholera in Amoy, China, 
caused the Japanese authorities to declare a quarantine 
on all vessels from that port in accordanc- with the 
Quarantine Regulation enacted in 1873. A German 
ship entered Yokohama and when the port authorities 
tried to apply the quarantine regulation to it, a German 
warship appeared and removed it from quarantine. 
The spreading of cholera in Japan was believed by 
many Japanese and foreigners to be due to this denial 
of the right of the Japanese to impose necessary 
quarantine upon the ships of certain Power,. Former 
American President Grant, who was in Japan at that 
time on his world trip, did not hesitate to say that 
Japan would have been justified in sinking the German 
ship.

treaties might be revised in 1872, by virtue of the 
provision of the 1858 treaties. The American treaty 
had the following clause: 
"After the 4th of July, 1872, (143) upon the desire of either the 
American or the Japanese Government, and on one year's notice 
given by either party, this Treaty, and such portions of the Treaty of 
Kanagawa as remained unrevoked by this Treaty, together with 
the regulations of trade hereunto annexed, or those that may be 
hereafter introduced, shall be subject to revision by commissioners 
appointed on both sides for this purpose, who will be empowered 
to decide on, and insert therein, such amendments as experience 
shall prove to be desirable." 
The revision was permissible, and yet it must 
depend upon the agreement of all the parties, and 
this agreement was not easy to secure. 
What was the belief of the Western Powers at 
that time on this question? In July, 1864, Earl Grey 
brought forward, in the House of Lords, twelve 
resolutions on Japan, which questioned, among other 
things, the expediency and justice of consulor juris-
diction. But Lord John Russel replied that Japanese 
laws were most sanguinary, that in some cases all 
the relatives of a criminal could be put to death for 
his offense. Russel seemed to think wrongly that the 
- unwritten code of honor of the samurai which de-
manded suicide by disembowelment was legal penalty 
which could be inflicted on criminals. He proceeded 
to ask: "Is it desirable that we should abandon a 
plan which has now been acted upon for three 
centuries, in accordance with which, when we enter 
oriental nations, we carry with us our own tribunals

and our own notions of justice." 
The Iwakura Mission (1871-73) 
The first suggestion of revision was made in a 
private memorandum submitted by Terajt ma Mune-
non, Minister for Foreign Affairs, to Sir Harry 
Parkes, British Minister to Japan, in April, 1871. 
The following significant paragraph was fc und in the 
memorandum. 
"The Treaties are made entirely for foreigners corn ag to Japan 
and the only stipulation for Japanese going abroad is that a diplo-
matic agent may reside in the capital. In these things the same 
power ought to be inherent in both; and after the quest,on has been 
examined, equal and concurrent powers should be the phraseology 
of the Treaties." (144) 
The Japanese Government resolved to deal directly 
and singly with the home government of the Treaty 
Powers and it therefore sent abroad a special mission, 
known as the Iwakura Mission headed by Prince 
Iwakura. The mission was a large, powerful one, 
containing no less than fifty members among whom 
were the ablest of the new leaders of el apan, such 
as Kido, Okubo, and Ito, and officials attached to it 
from every department of the public service. 
Their objects were most plainly set forth in 
the letter of credence which they presented to the 
President of the United States upon their arrival in 
Washington.

JAPAN'S FOREIGN RELATIONS 
"We expect and intend to reform and improve the Treaties 
so as to stand upon a similar footing with the most enlightened 
nations, and to attain the full development of public rights and 
interests. The civilization and institutions of Japan are so different 
from those of other countries that we can not expect to reach the 
desired end at once. It is our purpose to select, from the various 
institutions prevailing among enlightened nations, such as are best 
suited to our present condition, and adopt them, in gradual reforms 
and amendments of our policy and customs so as to be on an equality 
with them." (145) 
The Iwakura Mission left Japan in December, 
1871, arriving in Washington on February 29, 1872, 
and was received by President Grant on March 4. 
Warm hospitality awaited them everywhere, and they 
were heartily welcomed. 
At the first conference with Secretary Fish on 
March 11, Prince Iwakura presented a memorandum 
containing a summary of the most important changes 
which Japan desired to effect, among which were: 
(1) abolition of extraterritoriality upon the enact-
ment of a national code based upon the laws of the 
Western Powers; (2) tariff autonomy; and (3) pro-
hibition of landing organized military forces without 
permission of Japan. These desires were the fruits 
of the bitter experience which Japan had been 
compelled to taste during the past two decades of 
her enforced intercourse with the Western Powers. 
At the second conference, two days later, Secre-
tary Fish presented the American counter proposals 
which entirely ignored the all important questions of 
tariff autonomy and the abolition of extraterritoriality 
and were largely concerned with the further amplifi-
cation of existing treaty rights of foreigners in

Japan. 
After further exchange of views in two extended 
conferences, Prince Iwakura presented at the fifth 
conference on March 27, the Japanese draft of treaty 
which received the scrutinizing study of the State 
Department; and at the sixth conference on June 1, 
the American draft of a treaty in twenty-four articles 
and of accompanying regulations in five artdcles were 
presented to the Japanese Mission. The American 
plan contained no reference to the abolition of extra-
territoriality, but it contained the conditicnal most-
favored-nation clause in respect of trade, commerce, 
and navigation. The Japanese amendments to the 
American draft were made on July 1O, and the 
seventh conference was scheduled for July 22. 
In the meantime, Prince Iwakura, perck-iving the 
possibility of concluding a new treaty with the 
United States, hurriedly sent Okubo and Ito back to 
Japan to acquaint the Tokyo Government with the 
progress of negotiations so far attained in Washington 
and to get full power to conclude the trcaty. But 
their effort was in vain. The Japanese Government 
preferred to conclude treaties at a cont rence in 
Europe attended by the representatives of all Treaty 
Powers rather than to proceed with them one by 
one. The two messengers reluctantly proceeded to 
America again and rejoined the Mission on July 22, 
the day on which the last conference was scheduled  
in expectation of their return to Washington. The 
Japanese proposal for a conference was rejected by 
the United States, which insisted that it had "always 
declined to be a party to a Congress or Conference 
for the conclusion of any treaty of corn tnerce or 
amity." Thus the negotiations for the revision of the

JAPAN'S FOREIGN RELATIONS 
American Treaty was abruptly terminated, and the 
Mission left for England. 
In his Annual Message to Congress of December 
2, 1872, President Grant stated: 
"Our Treaty relations with Japan remain unchanged. An im-
posing embassy from that interesting and progressive nation visited 
this country during the year that is passing, but being unprovided 
with powers for the signing of a convention in this country, no 
conclusion in that direction was reached. It is hoped, however, 
that the interchange of opinions which took place during their stay 
in this country has led to a mutual appreciation of the interests 
which may be promoted when the revision of the existing treaty 
shall be undertaken." (146) 
In the summer of 1872, the Iwakura Mission 
arrived in England. Sir Harry Parkes was recalled 
from his post at Tokyo to act as guide to them during 
their tour .of England and earned their gratitude for 
the help he gave them. But they were unsuccessful 
in procuring the revision of the Treaties. 
On January 18, 1873, Earl Granville, Foreign 
Secretary, wrote the following instructions to Parkes: 
"Form your own direct intercourse with the Ambassadors during 
their stay in England and also from having been present at the 
interview which I had with their Excellencies you will have learned 
how little they had to offer in explanation of the objects of their 
mission and the views and wishes of their Government; and how 
little, in the uncertainty in which I was left in these respects, I was 
able to convey to them regarding the policy and intentions of Her 
Majesty's Government in regard to intercourse with Japan . . . .

ly relations with Japan, but is not prepared, out of deference to the

Leaving England, the Iwakura Mission visited 
France, Belgium, Holland, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, 
Sweden, Italy, Austro-Hungary, and Switzerland. But 
their activities were devoted to observntion and 
studies, and no progress was made in the direction 
of treaty revision. They returned to Japa a in Sep-
tember, 1873. 
Though the Iwakura Mission failed in their 
attempt to revise the unequal treaties, their sojourn, 
extending nearly two years in America an I Europe, 
was of great importance in other ways. The fifty 
members, many of whom were men of exceptional 
ability, obtained a close view of Western civilization 
which bore fruit on their return and mad i the mis-
sion an epoch-making event in the history i d modern 
Japan. Especially did they realize the far-reaching 
legislative and judicial measures that would have to 
be undertaken before the Power would listen to the 
plea of Japan for the abolition of extraterritoriality, 
and they devoted themselves to this task with un-
flagging zeal. It is very important to notice the 
great impetus which the ardent desire to get rid of 
consular jurisdiction gave to the reconst uction of 
the political, administrative and judicial organization 
of Japan. Every recommendation made by tho Iwakura

JAPAN'S FOREIGN RELATIONS 
was influenced by the burning desire to secure the 
abolition of the extraterritoriality system. 
In 1873, some Italian merchants in Japan, for 
the. purpose of buying silkworm eggs, were much 
hampered by the restrictions on inland travel imposed 
on foreigners, and the Italian Government actually 
negotiated a revised treaty which had given partial 
judicial autonomy to Japan in return for freedom 
of movement for Italians within Japan. But, the rest 
of the Treaty Powers vigorously protested and the 
proposed agreement was dropped. 
Terajima Munenori (1873-79) 
On October 28, 1873, Terajima Munenori, Min-
ister to England, succeeded Soejima Taneomi as 
Minister for Foreign Affairs, and during the next 
six years he devoted his efforts to the task of the 
revision of unequal treaties. Terajima's first experi-
ence in treaty revision was related to the pending 
question of travel in the interior inherited from his 
predecessor. Encouraged by the ill-fated Italian treaty 
of 1873, the foreign representatives renewed their joint 
attempt to secure the right of travel in the interior of 
Japan beyond the limits of open ports. Terajima took 
the attitude that Japan would be willing to admit trade 
and travel throughout the Empire if the Treaty 
Powers would surrender their extraterritorial juris-
diction. 
While perceiving that the Powers were far from 
ready to give up their extraterritorial jurisdiction, 
Terajima saw a possibility of recovering tariff au-
tonomy if the two questions were separated. Of the

two evils, he thought the abolition, or at least revision, 
of the conventional tariff more urgent oecause of 
the strained finances and probably the eas er because 
of the deficiencies in the Japanese judicial system as 
compared with the Western Powers. (148) 
In 1875, therefore, Terajima verbally proposed 
to the Treaty Powers that the exist ng treaty 
restrictions upon the rightful autonomy (y Japan to 
impose reasonable duties upon foreign imports should 
be removed, on the condition that Japan would agree 
to abolish all export duties and to open new ports. 
Informal conversations followed throughout 1875 and 
1876 between Terajima and foreign repsentatives. 
The proposal was rejected by all Europe -in Powers, 
especially by Great Britain whose spokesmf,n in Japan 
was Sir Harry Parkes. Terajima, howeve,', found in 
John A. Bingham, American Minister to Japan, an 
ardent supporter. Bingham considered tl Terajima 
proposal "so reasonable, so just, and so niuch in the 
interest of Japan and in no sense hurtful to the 
rights of any one of the Treaty Powers," and urged 
the State Department that the United Stp tes "should 
be the first to say that this proposition is ac-
cepted.,,(149) 
On June 8, 1876, Terajima propo ,ed to the 
Washington Government through Minister Yoshida to 
begin negotiations, but Secretary of Stat- Fish was 
(148) Richardson: op. cit., p. 288. 
In his annual message of December 7, 1874, Presk k-nt Grant pro-
claimed: "It is hoped that negotiations between the Government of 
Japan and the Treaty Powers, looking to the further opening of the 
Empire and to the removal of various restrictions upon t, ade and travel, 
may soon produce the results desired, which can not f til to inure to 
the benefit of all nations."

opposed to separate negotiations and insisted upon 
the "cooperative policy" with European Powers. Min-
ister Yoshida went so far as to suggest that a new 
treaty should be concluded to take effect conditionally 
when all the Treaty Powers gave assent. 
In March, 1877, with the inauguration of Presi-
dent Hayes, William Evarts succeeded Hamilton Fish 
as Secretary of State. Secretary Evarts, in accepting 
Minister Bingham's view, decided in favor of separate 
negotiations and informed the Japanese Government 
to that effect. Unfortunately, the Satsuma rebellion 
which broke out in January, 1877, diverted the atten-
tion of the Tokyo Government to the suppression of 
the revolt. The Washington negotiation started in 
the middle of January, 1878, and it proceeded so 
smoothly that an agreement for the cancellation, so 
far as the United States was concerned, of the Tariff 
Convention of 1866 ?was speedily reached by the end 
of June, and a new Convention was signed on July 
25, 1878. The Japanese Government, in turn, agreed 
to open Shimonoseki and one other port to citizens 
and vessels of the United States for residence and 
trade, and also to remove the export duty on goods 
shipped to America. As to the extraterritorial right, 
no concessions were secured by Japan, since the new 
Convention kept intact "the first three sentences 
which are comprised in the first paragraph of Article 
VI of the treaty of 1858," which stipulated that 
"Americans committing offences against Japanese 
shall be tried in American consular courts, and the 
guilty, shall be punished according to American law." 
Furthermore, the coming into force of the new con-
vention was made contingent upon the conclusion of 
a similar treaty with "all the other Treaty Powers"

which numbered sixteen at the time. 
In his annual message of December 2, 1878, 
President Hayes stated: 
"The Japanese Government has been desirous of a revision of 
such parts of its treaties with foreign powers as relate to commerce, 
and, it is understood, has addressed to eaeh of the trt ay powers 
a request to open negotiations with that in view. The LT,tited States 
Government has been inclined to regard the matter favorably. 
Whatever restrictions upon trade with Japan are four, injurious 
to that people can not but affect injuriously nations h ding com-
mercial intercourse with them. Japan, after a long period of 
seclusion, has within the past few years made rapid st ides in the 
path of enlightenment and progress, and,, not unreasona:iy, is look-
ing forward to the time when her relations with the nations of 
Europe and America shall be assimilated to those whici) they hold 
with each other. A treaty looking to this end has heen made, 
which will be submitted for the consideration of the Set) ate." (150) 
The success of the new American-Jap; mese Con-
vention now entirely depended upon the outcome of 
the negotiations with other Treaty Powe rs, among 
which Great Britain had the most influer, tial voice. 
Indignant Parkes wrote on January 5, 1S79: "The 
object of the Americans is, of course, transparent?
they wish to lead the Japanese to bt lieve that 
they are willing to meet their wishes, and, if 
unable to do so, it is because other nations, notably 
England and Parkes won't enable them to do so." 
American Minister Bingham transmitted to the State 
Department a confidential statement hanced to him 
at the Japanese Foreign Office of a cony ,rsation at 
the British Foreign Office between Sir Julitn Paunce-
fote and Mr. Stuart Lane, of the Japanee Legation

in London, in relation to the Convention of July 25, 
1878. Sir Julian spoke of it as "contrary to all 
usage" for the United States to act secretly and 
independently in such a matter. 
Acting upon the advice of Mr. Smith, American 
councillor of the Japanese Foreign Office, the Japanese 
Government attempted to deal separately with the 
various other Powers, but their negotiations fell 
through in London, Paris, and St. Petersburg. Thus 
the new American-Japanese Convention of 1878, 
though approved by. the Senate and the ratifications 
were duly exchanged, became a dead letter and with 
it the Terajima plan for the revision of treaties. 
Thus, in the first decade of the long struggle, 
the Japanese Government suffered defeat on both 
fronts, judicial and tariff privileges of the Treaty 
Powers remaining intact. But the Japanese were only 
biding their time to deliver a fresh and more deter-
mined onslaught.

AUTHENTICATION (NINSHO) IS CERT In CATION OF

thentication means that an applican is eligible 
for incorporation as a religious juridical p rson, that 
the required procedures have been duly obi- erved, and 
that the regulations are properly drawn ul . Authen-
tication does not in any sense constitute government 
"recognition" (ninka) in the sense of appr, ,val. It is 
the regulations and not the organizatior that are 
authenticated. Since all amendments to the regulations 
also have to be authenticated, and since t be authen-
tication process in connection with establishment, 
amendments, merger and voluntary dis:-;olution is 
essentially the same, it is well that those concerned 
thoroughly understand the procedures descri ried below. 
Having drawn up the regulations ant given the 
appropriate public notice, including a gist of the 
regulations, at least one month in advance ( Art. 12-3), 
an applicant for incorporation must then submit to the 
competent authority a written application, two copies 
horary, Japan

of the proposed regulations, letters of acceptance from 
both the person who is to be the official representative 
and from' a majority of the persons who are to be 
officers, and documents certifying (1) that the applicant 
is a religious organization within the meaning of 
Article 2, (2) that the required public notice has been 
given, and (3) that the person presenting the applica-
tion is authorized to do so. (Art. 13). 
An application for incorporation is a request for 
authentication of the regulations, that is, the articles 
of incorporation. (Art. 12-1) This is the first legal 
step necessary in order to incorporate; the second is 
registration. 
Authentication is a relatively simple process for 
local organizations which are a part of already 
established denominations and sects; but it can become 
a rather complicated process, if the applicant is a new 
organization and the competent authority objects to or 
has doubts about whether or not it should become a 
religious juridical person. It should be noted, however, 
that the main purpose of the complicated process in 
the Law is not to embarrass the applicant, but to 
prevent capricious action by the competent authorities 
in refusing to permit incorporation without sound 
reasons and without carefully examining the documents 
and the qualifications of applicants. 
These protective provisions reflect the feeling of 
anxiety at the time that, following a period of relative 
license under the Religious Corporations Ordinance, 
reaction would set in and some religious organizations 
might find themselves discriminated against in their 
efforts to become incorporated. A secondary purpose 
was to provide adequate safeguards within the frame-
work of the Law, because of the inability or reluctance

of religious organization to become involved in ex-
pensive and time-consuming litigation with the com-
petent authorities in order to overcome any alleged 
unfairness. 
Procedures by Competent Authorities 
0. . 
Receipt Upon receiving an apphca:.ion with 
the required accompanying documents, the competent 
authority must at once send the applicaru a dated 
receipt. This requirement is intended to wvent any 
undue administrative delay in processing applications. 
The Law sets a time-limit of three months, beginning 
with the date of receipt of the application, within 
which incorporation must be permitted or denied. 
(Art. 14-1, 4) The necessity for this pro\ tsion was 
demonstrated soon after the Law became effective. 
An applicant complained to RCR that, although appli-
cation papers had been submitted, the Minister of 
Education had not acknowledged their rec( ipt. The 
case was a delicate one, which the official -, did not 
want to handle, but RCR intervened and a receipt 
was finally sent. Otherwise the applicati on might 
have remained at the Ministry for months unac-
knowledged. Failure of the Ministry to promptly 
acknowledge receipt of an application is a violation 
of the Law. Any correction of document F must be 
requested subsequent and not prior to acl= nowledge-
ment of receipt of an application. 
Criteria There are three criteria by which a 
competent authority decides whether to authenticate 
regulations. (Art. 14-1)

RELIGIOUS JURIDICAL PERSONS LAW 
These are: 
1. Is the applicant a religious organization within the meaning 
of Article II, which defines eligibility? 
2. Are the regulations in conformity with the provisions of this 
Law and other laws and orders? 
3. Have the establishment procedures relative to public notice 
been observed? 
Public Hearing If the answers to the above 
questions are not in the affirmative, the competent 
authority must arrange for a hearing and listen to 
the opinions of the applicant and any advisors who 
may accompany him. However, when deemed neces-
sary, the competent 'authority may limit the number 
of such advisors to three. (Articles 14-2 and 82) 
This provision for a hearing was intended to make 
sure that religious leaders could always have legal 
counsel or an associate when calling on officials who 
in the past had so often given advise in private. 
Limitation of the number was agreed to because of 
the necessity of preventing mass demonstrations. 
Minister of Education as Competent Authority 
When the competent authority is the Minister of Edu-
cation, if after a hearing he does not decide to act 
favorably, the matter must be referred to the 
Religious Juridical Persons Council for examination 
(Article 14-3) and on ?the basis of the Council's 
recommendation the Minister must either authen-
ticate the regulations or decline to do so. RCR was 
assured that in such cases the recommendation of 
the Council is mandatory even though it is not so 
stated in the Law.

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
Prefectural Governor as Competent luthority 
When the competent authority is a prefectural gov-
ernor, he must in the first instance decide, without 
reference to the Religious Juridical Persons Council, 
whether or not to authenticate the regulati(,ns. This 
procedures was adopted because it was beli. ved that 
prefectural officials, being closer to the local situation, 
would act with care and would be reluctanr to take 
any action which the Council might revers i in case 
an applicant requested a re-examination. Further-
more, it was felt that the Council shouht not be 
burdened with minor cases that could b, settled 
satisfactorily on a local basis. 
Notice to Applicant The final decision_ on au-
thentication in any case must be made within a 
period of not more than three months from the date 
of receiving an application. When the decision is to 
authenticate, a letter of authentication and a copy of 
the authenticated regulations must be sent to the appli-
cant; otherwise a letter must be sent stflting the 
reasons why authentication is denied. (Arti, le 14-4) 
Re-examination 
When authentication has been denied, an appli-
cant may within two months request a re-examination 
of the application by submitting a written request 
to the competent authority stating the reasons why 
reconsideration is believed justified. (Articte 16-1) 
Receipt of such a request must be at once acknowl-
edged. (Article 16-2) However, if the request for

re-examination is received after the two-month period 
has elapsed or, if procedural or other defects, if any, 
have not been corrected within an appropriate time, 
the request shall be dismissed and the applicant so 
notified by letter stating the reasons, within a period 
not to exceed three months from the date of receiving 
the application. (Article 16-1 (1), 5) Otherwise, 
within a period not to exceed six months plus the 
time allowed for the correction of any procedural 
or other defects, the competent authority must either 
send the applicant a letter of authentication and a 
copy of the authenticated regulations or a letter 
stating the reasons why he cannot authenticate them. 
(Article 16-6, 7) 
In reaching his decision the competent authority 
must review the case, provide an opportunity for 
the correction of any defects, hold a hearing, if 
necessary, and if he does not decide to authenticate, 
place the case before the Religious Juridical Persons 
Council. In reaching its decision the Council follows 
the same general procedures as the competent author-
ity. (Article 16-2 to 4) 
Administrative Appeal 
When the Minister of Education as the competent 
authority, after referring an application to the Re-
ligious Juridical Persons Council, has twice declined 
to authenticate the regulations, there is no alternative 
open to the applicant except recourse to courts of 
law. In the past it was generally agreed that ad-
ministrative decisions were binding and, therefore, the 
courts were reluctant to accept cases involving religion.

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
To obviate the possibility of this practice tontinuing, 
Article 87 provides that "no provision of this Law 
shall be construed as interfering with thi right to 
bring action before a court against disposition made 
by the Minister of Education or a prefectural gov-
ernor under this Law qualifying it as illegal." 
However, in cases where a prefectura governor 
as the competent authority has declined to authen-
ticate regulations after referring the m Ater only 
once to the Religious Juridical Persons Council, an 
applicant may within one month from the cInte authen-
tication has been denied, make an adn inistrative 
appeal to the Minister of Education in accordance 
with the Administrative Appeal Law (Lair No. 105, 
1890). In such a case, if the appeal is received 
after the expiration of one month or tin applicant 
has failed to correct any defects as requested, the 
appeal may be denied forthwith. OthervOse, before 
making his decision the Minister must, refer the 
appeal to the Religious Juridical Persons Council 
which in turn, if authentication is not approved, 
must also provide a hearing for the appellant. Since 
only one sound reason is necessary in denying authen-
tication, if the Council recognizes the validity of all 
the appellant's objections, the prefectura governor 
concerned must, in the manner already described, 
authenticate the regulations without delay (Article 
17) (Other matters related to the appeal procedure 
are prescribed in the Administrative Appeal Law.)

concerning authentication . . . shall not require the 
applicant to include in the regulations" matters not 
specified in the Law. (Article 14-5) This protective 
item was deemed necessary because of the penchant 
of government officials in pre-war years to adopt 
departmental regulations which included matters not 
authorized in laws and ordinances. 
Registration 
"A religious juridical person comes into existence 
by effecting registration of establishment at the place 
where its main office is located." (Article 15) 
VI 
The regulations (articles of incorporation) having 
been duly authenticated and registered an organiza-
tion is fully incorporated. It holds the property 
registered in connection with incorporation and the 
responsible officers can conduct any necessary business 
in accordance with its regulations (Article 18-4), or 
in the absence of specific regulations by a majority 
vote. (Article 19) [n regard to the conduct of busi-
ness, the Law regulates only a few matters. These 
are: registration, records, amendments, merger, and 
dissolution. It also provides penalties. 
Acts Null and Void 
The penalties attached to failure to carry out 
the provisions of the Law are stated in Chapter X

of the Law. It should be noted, however, ,hat "acts 
perpetrated in violation of the provisions" for giving 
public notice in "regard to immovable prope ty, which 
is a precinct-building or precinct . . . , or treasures 
mentioned in the inventory . . ." are null and void. 
However, "such invalidity cannot be set against" 
persons or third parties who act in good faith in 
any transaction. In other words, anyone who buys 
property in good faith, without knowing that in 
making the sale the responsible officers concerned did 
not observe the regulations, cannot be de orived of 
such property, but the responsible officers cl n be held 
responsible for making good any loss incurred due to 
such a violation. (Article 24) 
Records 
No annual or other reports are requiri relative 
to the business conducted; but an inventory of all 
property must be made at the time of establishment 
and within three months after the close of rach fiscal 
year. Records must be kept of all actions taken and 
business transacted, and certain documents must 
always be kept in the corporation's office aid be open 
for inspection on request by the properly constituted 
authorities. These documents are: the xticles of 
incorporation, letters of authentication, -I, list of 
officers, the inventory, financial statements, documents 
pertaining to the responsible officers and the pro-
ceedings of other organs, if any, prescribed in the 
regulations, records of handling business, and any 
documents related to social welfare or otner enter-
prises conducted under Article 6. The records, it

RELIGIOUS JURIDICAL PERSONS LAW 
must be noted, do not relate to religious activities 
or religious affairs, but only to matters with which 
the Law itself is directly concerned; that is, property. 
It is important, therefore, that the general religious 
records and the records of the corporation be kept 
separate. 
. Amendment, Merger, and Dissolution 
The basic procedures to be followed in case a 
religious juridical person decides either to amend 
its regulations, to merge with some other religious 
juridical person, or to voluntarily dissolve are essen-
tially the same: (1)- the provisions in the regulations 
of the religious juridical person concerned and in 
the Law relative to amendment, merger or dissolution 
must be observed, (2) the proposed changes in the 
regulations must be authenticated by the competent 
authority, (Articles 26, 33 & 44-1) and in some cases 
(3) registered before they are legally effective. The 
detailed procedures for these actions are prescribed 
separately in Chapter IV (amendments) Chapter V 
(merger), Chapter VI (dissolution). These chapters 
in the Law are not easily understood because instead 
of repeating the prescribed procedures each time, 
cross-references are made to the provisions of previous 
articles which in each case are amended to apply to 
the case in point. However, since a merger in which 
one religious juridical person continues to exist, and 
voluntary dissolution are handled as amendments to 
the regulations, the three actions can be discussed 
together and thus eliminate unnecessary repetition.

Amendments 
To amend regulations, which do not involve the 
cancellation or establishment of a den,)minational 
affiliation, the only procedural requirement is to 
observe the relevant provisions of the regulations of 
the religious juridical person concerned. 
Amendments Cancelling Denominational A6iliation 
However, when a religious juridical persn intends 
to amend its regulations in order to cancer or estab-
lish a denominational affiliation, a pubic notice, 
including a gist of the proposed change, must be 
given "to believers and other interested purties" at 
least two months before applying for authentication. 
In case a new denominational affiliation is to be 
established, permission to affiliate must la, received 
from the denomination concerned. If th present 
affiliation is being cancelled, simultaneou, with a 
public notice the denomination concerned must be 
notified, but denominational approval of the proposed 
cancellation is not necessary, even though such ap-
proval is required by the regulations of the religious 
juridical person concerned. However, in case the 
deniamination concerned deems the religious juridical 
person concerned has failed to observe other required 
procedures, it may report this to the MI lister of 
Education. (Article 26-4) These unusual provisions 
relative to denominational affiliation are discussed in 
full later in the section entitled "Denom national 
Affiliation and Secession," so no further mf tion of 
them will be made here.

RELIGIOUS JURIDICAL PERSONS LAW 
Merger 
"Two or more religious juridical persons may 
merge to form one juridical person." (Article 32) A 
merger may take one of two forms: either one of 
the merging bodies continues to exist and the others 
dissolve, or a new religious juridical person is estab-
lished and all other merging bodies dissolve. 
The procedures for merger are relatively simple. 
If one of two or more merging bodies is to continue 
to exist, and its regulations must be amended in 
order to consummate the merger, the matter is 
handled entirely as an amendment of its regulations; 
that is, its regulations relative to amendment must 
be observed and a public notice containing a gist of 
the draft agreement must be given to the believers 
of religious organizations concerned and other inter-
ested parties. If no amendment of the regulations 
is necessary, then a transfer of any property by the 
bodies intending to dissolve by merger (Article 35-1), 
and registration of the fact of dissolution (Article 57) 
is all that appears to be required. 
If a new religious juridical person is to be 
established, then the persons appointed by each of 
merging bodies shall jointly draw up regulations in 
accordance with the provisions of Paragraphs 1, 
Article 12; and as prescribed in Paragraph 3 of the 
same article, give public notice including a gist of 
the proposed regulations to believers and interested 
parties. (Article 35-2, 3) 
In addition to the above, within two weeks of 
giving public notice, each party must draw up an 
inventory of their respective properties, including

financial statements regarding enterpri ,es, if any, 
carried on under Article 6, and notify ny creditors 
publicly and individually, inviting them to present, 
within a period of not less than two rt onths, their 
objections, if any, to the proposed merger. In case 
any creditors object, the amounts involved must be 
paid or satisfactory security provided. (Article 34) 
In drafting the articles relative to merger, be-
cause they did not readily distinguish between the 
religious organization and its legal corpon te capacity, 
religious leaders objected to the suggestion that the 
several legal bodies involved should dissolxe and then 
simultaneously merge. To do so, they felt, would 
break the historic continuity of their religious organi-
zations. Consequently, the expression "dis4olution by 
merger" was adopted in order to make it clear that 
there was historical continuity. 
Dissolution, 
A religious juridical person may dis, olve itself 
at will at any time, but it must dissolve in certain 
cases, namely, the occurrence of a cause pr: scribed in 
the regulations, in case of merger when religious 
juridical person does not continue to exist, bank-
ruptcy, withdrawal of authentication as precribed in 
Paragraph 1 of Article 80, a court order in accord-
ance with the provisions of Paragraph 1 Article 81 
and, in the case of a denomination, if all its local 
religious juridical persons go out of exist mce. 
In case of voluntary dissolution, a religious 
juridical person must give public notice to the 
believers and other interested parties, invit ng them

to .present their opinions, if any, concerning dissolu-

if any opinions are expressed, the question of dis-
solution shall be reconsidered in the light of these 
opinions, but there is no obligations to do more

Application for Authentication in case of Amendment, 
Merger, or Dissolution 
Amendments, a merger which involves a change 
in the existing regulations or the establishment of 
a new religious juridical person, and dissolution, do 
not become effective until the relevant authentication 
has been received from the competent authority. To 
secure authentication an applicant must submit a 
written application, two copies of the proposed action, 
and documents certifying that (1) the prescribed 
procedures have been duly observed, (2) all required 
public and direct notices have been given and, where 
relevant, and (3) permission to affiliate has been 
received from the denomination concerned. In case a 
new religious juridical person is being established, a 
document must also be submitted certifying that the 
applicant is a religious organization as defined in

(Articles 46 & 47) are to all intents and purposes 
identical with those described above for authentica-
tion, (Article 14) re-examination (Artiole 16) and 
administrative appeal (Article 17). 
An application for authentication of an amend-
ment or the regulations of a new religious jurdical 
person established in connection with a merger shall 
be submitted "under the joint signatures of the 
respective religious juridical persons in tending to 
merge." If the competent authorities of the parties 
concerned are different, the application shall be 
presented to the competent authority of the religious 
juridical person which continues to exist or of the 
one that is to be established. (Art. 38-2) 
Liquidators 
When a religious juridical person ha:, dissolved 
itself, except in case of merger or bankruptcy, unless 
otherwise provided in the regulations, the official 
representative or his substitute shall become the liqui-
dator. In the case of dissolution by merger the 
property is presumably transferred to the religious 
juridical person which continues to exist. Dissolution 
because of bankruptcy is handled in accordance with 
the relevant provisions of the Civil Code and the Law 
of Procedures for Non-contentious Matters (Law No. 
14, 1898). (Art. 51) In a case of dissolution because 
authentication is withdrawn in accordance with the

appoints the liquidator. (Art. 49-2) 
All officers or their substitutes, except the 
liquidator, in case he is an officer or substitute,

The provisions of Article 22 relative to minors, in-
competents, quasi-incompetents, and persons under 
sentence of imprisonment, not being eligible to 
become officers apply also to liquidators. (Art. 49-3) 
Disposition of Property 
Residual property, except in case of merger or 
bankruptcy, is to be disposed of in accordance with 
the provisions of the regulations of the religious 
juridical persons concerned, and, in case there are no 
such provisions, to other religious organizations or to 
public welfare works. Any property not so disposed 
of reverts to the national treasury. (Art. 50) This 
has already been discussed in Chapter IV under 
"Dissolution and Residual Property" and no further 
comment is required here. 
Date of Effect

VII 
Denominational Affiliation and Secesst,a 
No subject received greater consideration by RCR 
in connection with drafting the Law than did denomi-
national affiliation and secession, yet the Law would 
be better, not to say simpler, if thiS subject were 
not dealt with either directly or indirectly. Denomi-
national affiliation is a religious matter between local 
religious organizations and their denominational head-
quarters. It has its basis in a common faith and 
a common way of doing things. Incorporation 
concerns the holding and management of property 
and the transaction of business affairs. If a denomi-
nation has legal claims on the proper y of an in-
corporated local religious organization, its interests 
can be adequately protected by law; but the moral 
or spiritual claims, which arise front a common 
spiritual heritage, rest on a different foundation and 
have no place in the laws of a society which recog-
nizes religious freedom and separation of "church" 
and state. 
Nevertheless, because of the situatinn prevailing 
at the time the Law was drafted, there was no way 
of avoiding the subject. Consequently, tin effort was 
made to deal with it in such a way as to be satis-
factory to both the local and denominational organiza-
tion, and at the same time not go too far afield from 
the law's primary purpose. In doing this, as already 
explained above, a terminology was adopted which 
avoided any religious implications. Tht,s denomina-
tional affiliation is referred to as a "comprehending" 
112

Approved For Release 2003/04/02 : CIA-RDP80R01731R000200100011-1 
RELIGIOUS JURIDICAL PERSONS LAW 
or a "comprehended" relationship. But? in the ex-
planation which follows, the simpler and more easily 
understood common expressions are employed. 
In the opinion of the Special Projects Officer, the 
Religious Corp-orations Ordinance had caused a great 
deal of unnecessary and undesireable disintegration in 
the religious world, particularly Buddhist; and it was 
his hope that the new law would correct some of the 
Ordinance's weaknesses and perhaps produce a greater 
degree of stability in the religious world than had 
existed in recent years. It was not possible, however, 
to rectify the damage already done without violating 
the very principles which it was RCR's mission to 
establish. The only thing possible was to compromise 
somewhat and make the best of the situation. 
In order to prevent willful or capricious secession 
by local priests or cliques without the knowledge of 
their denominational authorities or the knowledge and 
approval of the local constituencies concerned, the Law 
requires not only that a public notice be given, but 
that ?the denomination concerned must be notified 
directly at least two months before an application is 
presented for authentication of an amendment can-
celling a denominational affiliation. (Art. 26-2, 3) 
This period was regarded as sufficient to enable 
denominational officials to visit any constitutency and 
assist the members or adherents, if any, who opposed 
the proposed secession and possibly secure an injunc-
tion against further action. Secession .and a change 
in affiliation by temples had been frequent in past 
centuries so there could be no basic objection to 
secession in principle. Buddhist sectarian leaders had 
been very emphatic in saying that they objected 
because secessions should not be carried out without

CONTEMPORARY JAPA 
the knowledge and consent of the la'al supporters. 
Consequently, it was felt that the pr wision in the 
Law for a public notice and a notice -;o the denomi-
nation concerned met one of their r( quirements in 
respect to the proposed law. 
In addition to this, however, the Law provides 
that in case any local responsible olficers do not 
observe the regulations in respect tu amendments 
related to the cancellation of denominational affilia-
tion, such misconduct may be brought tt, the attention 
of the competent authority concerned. (Art. 26-4) 
Moreover, since any objections would mo,t likely result 
in the subject being referred to the R, ligious Jurid-
ical Persons Council, denominational officials normally 
would have an additional opportunity to present 
their case against the legality of a prop ,sed secession. 
Another means of slowing down the secession 
trend at the time the Law was being drafted was 
the very strange provision in the second sentence of 
the first paragraph of Article 26, alr ,ady referred 
to above. This states in substance the r in the case 
of a proposed secession a religious ju idical person 
does not have to secure the approval ef its denomi-
national headquarters even though it regulations 
stipulate that such approval is requin d. In other 
words, any provision in the regulad ,ns requiring 
denominational approval is legally invz lid. On the 
surface this provision would seem to b intended to 
help or promote, rather than discourage -;ecession; but 
such was not the case. RCR believed wit a good reason 
that if the proposed Law in any mann( r whatsoever 
was thought to freeze the denomination:d status quo, 
there would be a great wave of secessit us before its 
enforcement. It was certain that practically every

RELIGIOUS JURIDICAL PERSONS LAW 
denomination would insist on its respective local 
affiliated bodies inserting in their regulations provi-
sions requiring denominational approval in case 
secession was contemplated; and it was equally 
certain that such insistence would stimulate a certain 
amount of secession. To avoid this, Paragraph 1 of 
Article 26 makes all such requirements legally invalid, 
while at the same time leaving the local organizations 
concerned with a moral obligation to consult with 
denominational leaders and secure their consent before 
taking any action. 
In this manner RCR endeavored to do what it 
could to stabilize the denominational status quo; but 
there was also an obligation to protect the interests 
of the local organizations as well. The need for this 
was made plain at a conference at Utsunomiya where 
the then current draft was criticized adversely because 
it was contended that sectarian headquarters could 
always prevent secession by the simple process of 
removing or disciplining any clergy or laymen pro-
moting secession. To cover this contingency a second 
unusual provision ( Art. 78) was added, which states 
in substance that in the event a secession is being 
considered by a local temple, for example, the denomi-
nation concerned cannot for this reason and in order 
to prevent secession exercise its authority to remove 
or discipline the officers of the religious juridical person 
concerned for a period of two years. 
As indicated above, RCR was not at all statisfied 
with these provisions and believed that the Law would 
be better if they were not in it. But because of the 
situation which prevailed at the time something had 
to be done, and thus secession was handled. A revision 
of the Law should eliminate all such provisions.

SENSU JAPANESE FOLDING FAN 
By FLORENCE WELLS 
THE ALL-EMBRACING JAPANESE WORD FOR FAN 
is ogi, derived from aogu (to cause it breeze) ; 
and it is written with the Chinese ideograph 
sham ( ei ), composed of two wings und( r a door, 
suggestive of the leaves of a door which s wing back 
and forth. Both hi-ogi slat-fans and pai er-covered 
folding fans were early sent to China as gifts and 
tribute, and there they were called sham and later 
shan-tsu. The addition of tsu was merel - for the 
sake of euphony, a common practice in C tina; and 
this custom came into Japan when Chine ,e, scribes 
were employed in the Heian Court, as is se( a in such 
words as isu (chair). In Inryo-ken Jitsuro ,.a (Daily 
Record of Inryo-ken) it is stated that the 100 shan, 
or ogi, sent as tribute to China in the 7f year of 
Eikyo era, i.e. 1436, were shan-tsu, or, as p .onounced 
in Japanese, sensu (gi g-). Granted that the ideo-
graph tsu, or su, is used merely for its sound, it 
has, nevertheless, the commonly accepted m ,aning of 
offspring or child. And though it may b said to 
be based on a pun, it is undeniable that t le paper-
covered folding fan now commonly called s( ?,szt is in 
reality the offspring of the hi-ogi of earl icr days. 
This is shown in the study of its transitb 41. 
The use of the name sensu did no become 
general until the 17th and 18th centuries, when it 
seems to have been used to designate fans Iv hich had

paper face and back, and not the fans with paper on 
one side only. In Buke Gense Juroku (Record of Mili-
tary Regulations) we find "On April 23rd of 1646 
a sensu and ceremonial costume were sent by the 
Empress Dowager to Tokugawa Ietsuna [who became 
the 4th Tokugawa Shogun in 1651] for his gempuku 
(the ceremony of Coming-of-Age). In Tosei Musuko-
katagi (Present-day Youth's Character), written in 
1716, the fan with paper faces front and back is 
called sensu. Also in Tosei Fuzoku-tsv, (Guide to 
Present-day Customs), written in 1774, we find the 
description of a sensu scented with cloves, as part 
of a young dandy's costume. "Their sensu are the 
clove-scented kirei (pretty) ogi (fans)." 
Other early writings in which the fan is called 
sensu are several. Shizu-no-odamaki (Humble Spool 
of Thread), in 1802, tells of itinerant makers of 
sensu who call at people's houses. Kyujutsu-sanyo 
(Account of Ancient Practices), mentions sending 
sensu as gifts in special wooden boxes, the style de-
pending upon the distance of the recipient. Kyutsu-
hisho (Book of Archery), explains how to exorcise 
evil from a maternity-room by shooting a singing-
arrow at a sensu used as a target. Ise Sangu Meisho-
zue (About Noted Places in Ise), says that at a 
certain poetry contest a sensu took the place of 
a desk and a hollowed-out stone held the ink. 
Oyudono-ki (Book of the Bath), describes the fans 
presented at the Boy's Festival on May 5th as 
sensu. Jozan-kidan (Anecdote of Jozan), tells about 
the economical Lord Karasumaru Mitsuhiro, who 
used a three-fan sensu-bako (fan-box) for many 
years as a writing table. Shuko-kai Shi (Magazine 
of the Society of Antique Collections), 1905, contains

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
an article in which sensu is used to desigr ate a fan 
made by the fianc?f Taira-no-Atsumori in the 12th 
century; but here it is probable that the author uses 
sensu in accord with the usage of his own day. So 
it has come about that little by little the word sensu 
has been used more and more; until now it is the 
accepted word for the paper-covered folding fan. 
Much of the respect accorded to the earlier 
hi-ogi has been inherited by the sensu, which, because 
of its lighter structure and less expensive production, 
has entered more widely into the lives of ordinary 
people. Finally, there seemed to be a fan for every 
type of person, a fan suitable for each and every 
occasion and activity. The party host or hostess, the 
sportsman, artist, poet, musician, actor, tea-master, 
bride and groom, house-builder, soldier, and even the 
business man, had his or her fan. Naturally, the fan 
was adjusted and transformed to meet each new use; 
and, in the early days, each new kind WES given a 
special name, depending on its style, its construction, 
or its use. Consequently, in the ten centuries which 
have elapsed since its invention in the Heian Court of 
Japan, a bewildering variety of names have been 
used to designate the fan which we now call sensu. 
At first, the folding fan had but five sticks and 
the rather stiff paper was pasted on one side only. 
Evidently its appearance was suggestiv( of skin 
wrinkled over one's bones; so it began to be called 
kawa-ori (skin folded, or pleated). In Toka-shio 
(Collection of Peach Blossom Pollen) it says, "The 
use of kawa-ori with ceremonial robes is permis-
sible; indeed, nowadays there are many who use it 
in winter as well as in summer." In Genji Mono-
gatari (Tales of Genji), 1020, we find thi; passage:

SENSU?JAPANESE FOLDING FAN 
"He wondered what she thought of him; and unable 
to control his emotion he seized her skirt. Where-
upon she hid her face with her beautifully painted 
kawa-ori." Before long, people were calling the 
sticks of the fan its bones. Then someone noticed 
the resemblance of the fan to a bat's wing, and 
jokingly dubbed it kawahori (a bat). 
A well-known fan anecdote, probably fictitious, 
is told of Taira-no-Ason Kiyomori, who died in 1181. 
He was a proud, hard man, who tried ?to crush all 
who opposed him. But the itinerant priest, Saigyo 
Hoshi, cared not a whit and spoke his mind freely. 
Even when summoned by the tyrant he was not at 
all cowed. He taunted Kiyomori and reminded him 
that in his youth he had been nicknamed Koheita, 
meaning arrogant, or as children say "Smarty." 
Kiyomori, overcome with confusion, hid his face 
behind his fan. Unfortunately, his aristocratic nose 
protruded from between the ribs of his fan, evidently 
a five-rib kawa-ori. Whereupon he was given a new 
name, Hana-hiraita. This caused much amusement 
because of its double meaning: "a flower has bloomed" 
and "a nose opens out." 
?For a long time it was the custom for the 
Emperor to present fans to his subjects. In the an-
cient book Nenehu-gyoji (Annual Register of Imperial 
Affairs) there is a description of the yearly fan 
presentation ceremony on April 1st in the Heian 
period. As this was known as the first day of 
summer, the fans presented at that time were called 
natsu-ogi, (summer fans). At the beginning of the 
ceremony the Emperor was escorted to his seat behind 
a screen. From there he witnessed the distribution 
of the sake allowance to the palace officials and

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
listened to their reports. After this, a first at-
tendant or a Court lady brought a willow box 
containing paper-covered folding fans and set it at 
one side of the screen. Then a second attendant 
received the fans one by one and carried each 
to the knight who would receive it. The knight 
accepted it with both hands and bowed worshipfully 
as he took it. During the period of civil wars, this 
custom lapsed; but it was revived for a while during 
the last quarter of the 16th century, when sensu 
were given out on May 5th. 
For a number of years there was still another 
formal presentation of fans to Court nobles and 
retainers. This took place in July, possibly at the 
time of the Tanabata festival. These fans were of 
the bombori type, named for the bombori lampshades 
or lanterns and made of the same excellent white 
paper. Court people were "above the clouds" and 
the face of such a fan was sprinkled with gold-dust 
to represent clouds, while the back had paintings of 
flowers and grasses of summer and autumn. The 
bombori fan had ten ribs; and the center, or parent-
ribs, as they were called, were curved in at the tips, 
giving the closed fan a slightly bulbous appearance. 
This characteristic has become the hallmark of the 
truly Japanese fans today; and poets say that, as 
parents protect their children, so the outer sticks 
protect the inner ones. The name bombori as applied 
to the fan was temporary. 
The name suehiro, according to Nakamura Kiyoe 
in his article "Beauty in Japanese Fans," was first 
used for the Chinese type of fan. This is likely, for 
that fan was papered front and back; and so, when 
it was folded it was so thick that the outer end of

SENSU?JAPANESE FOLDING FAN 
the shut fan appeared wider than the handle end. 
But it was not long before someone noticed that 
suehiro (widening at the end) was a more apt 
description of the fan when open; for the fan starts 
from nothing at the rivet and spreads out wide at 
the end, which suggests the idea of an expanding 
future. In other words, it wishes the recipient ever-
widening prosperity. Because of this sentiment, it 
became common practice to present a fan as a gift, 
or to include it with a gift. 
However, the custom of giving a fan as a fare-
well present goes back nearly a thousand years, long 
before suehiro was ever thought of. In Genji Mono-
gatari (Tales of Genji) someone remarks that a 
comb and a fan make a perfect gift at parting; and 
the Kogetsu-sho (Lake-Moon Book) explains that the 
teeth of a comb lead trouble away at all points; and 
ogi can be written aogi, meaning "to meet." There 
is also a mid-sixteenth-century story concerning Oda 
Nobunaga's departure for the Capital, when Imakoji 
Michizo gave him two fans (counted ni-hon) to 
celebrate his going. People marveled at such a 
trifling gift; but Imakoji said to Oda, "Ni-hon (two 
fans), Nihon (Japan) has come into your hand; 
moreover, these suehiro will bring you ever-widening 
good fortune." 
The Noh drama, which can be mentioned only 
briefly here, has its own special fans. Based as the 
Noh was on the ancient art of rhythmic posturing 
and performed originally as a religious, patrician 
entertainment, to the accompaniment of drum-beating 
and flute-playing, it is not surprising that fans were 
found to be useful adjuncts to the blending of poetry, 
music and dancing. As musicians to the Kasuga

Shrine, Kwanami (1333-84) and his son Seami 
(1363-1444) believed that there should be no mim-
icry; rather, the desired effect should be at*. ained by 
restrained suggestion. Each motion and every position 
of the fan came to have a meaning; also, the type of 
fan would give the observer a clue to the character 
of the actor holding it. 
There are said to be fifteen special P:oh fans, 
each with its name and individual implication. As 
for shape, the two most common are naka-hirogari-ogi 
(wide-spread middle) and shizume-ogi (pinched in). 
The naka-hirogari-ogi, according to Miyawaki Shimbei, 
is only another name for a suehiro fan. And the 
shizume-ogi, sometimes called otoko-ogi (mak fan), is 
described in Nakamura Kiyoe's fan article, where he 
says that when folded the side view appears narrower 
at top, for the two outside ribs are made to bend 
inward at the end, similar in shape to the present-day 
sensu, and that they appeared in the Muromaclii period. 
However, it is in decoration rather than structure 
that the Noh fans differ. For instance, the okina-ogi 
(old man's fan) has 15 ribs of green bamboo, with 
a painting on the face of pine and plum and bamboo, 
cranes and turtles, on a gold-dust background, and 
a painting of various treasures on the halt. The 
kami-ogi (god-fan), indicating a divine beirtg, has a 
design of phoenix and paulownia. The ,4ura-ogi 
(fan of Hades) is a warrior's fan with black ribs 
and, if for Genji, a sun seen rising over a high 
wave; or, if for Heike, a sun above a pine tree. 
The jo-ogi (sage's fan), used in certafil sacred 
dramas, has a white face on which are painted the 
seven sages in a bamboo grove. The worabe-ogi 
(child's fan) has black ribs and a painting of a fan

floating on the water, against either a red or a gold-
dust background. The yamabushi-ogi, identifying an 
itinerant Buddhist priest, may have any bold design, 
such as wild waves or an eagle on a rock. The 
hannya-mochi-ogi is the fan for the female demon; 
it has black ribs and resembles the shu,ra-ogi in 
design. The rojo-ogi (old woman's fan) has black 
ribs and a modest design without red, on a gold-dust 
background. The bin-ogi is so-called because it is 
used by women, who must tie back their bin (locks 
of hair) when performing in the Noh drama. These 
are but a few of the fans used by Noh actors; and 
no doubt there have been some changes in the tradi-
tional fan decorations here described, since these 
were set down by Miyawa,ki Shimbei more than 
forty years ago. 
Another fan which attained considerable pro-
minence was the chukei, which seems to have been 
invented by some fan-maker in the Muromachi 
period (1335-1603). Its style is unique among 
paper-covered fans, The frame is of bamboo, and 
the ribs go straight as far as the middle; there they 
are permanently warped in such a way that the 
outer end of the fan flares, giving it a half-
open appearance. Hepburn's Dictionary, 1887, defines 
chakei: "A kind of fan carried by priests or nobles, 
also attached to presents sent by the bride's parents 
to the son-in-law." In Wakan Sansai Zukai (Book 
of the Three Wisdoms of Heaven, Earth and Man 
in China and Japan) it is written that the ch,ukei, 
decorated with pictures in black-and-white, was used 
by Buddhist priests and doctors. This use is still 
seen in the kyogen farce in the Noh drama. Also, 
in Teijo Zakki (Teijo's Notes) we read that at a

certain Court ceremony held on May 5th Chukei 
fans were given to all the attendant,, including 
those serving the Court ladies. Only abo-lt a quarter 
of a century ago, in the funeral pit ?cession of 
Admiral Togo, could be seen his son, carrying a 
chukei, held like a scepter. 
Among the amusements enjoyed by the people 
of the Court in the simple, ancient days was watch-
ing the performance of Manzai, given by strolling 
dancers on January 4th. It is said that this dance 
was originated by one Koizumi Bungo, an attendant 
of an astrologer, in late Heian period. He and his 
descendants performed the Manzai dace in the 
Palace garden. In very much later days the dancers 
strolled about the country, giving their performance 
for ordinary folk. The name Manzai is derived from 
the word banzai, which means ten thousad years and 
is used as the equivalent of the American "Hurrah!" 
Fans were used prominently by the Manzai 
dancers, not only to fan away evil ar,(1 beckon in 
good, but also in countless humorous ways to accen-
tuate the fun of their performance. Ali ong the fans 
which they are known to have used i: the chukei, 
decorated with pictures of crane, turtle, pine, bamboo 
and plum as symbols of health an I long life. 
Apparently, they were cheaply made, for use only 
in the dance; and they were spoken cri as gara-ogi 
(frail and gaudy). On the other hand, they were 
known as Manzai-ogi (fans of ten thousand years) 
because of their use in this dance. A'ter finishing 
a performance, they usually received a gift of good 
fans, often chukei. 
Still another type of fan is the mai-ogi (dance 
fan), produced for the special use of dancers. It

Sumiko Hanayagi, a young Japanese dancer, on making 
her debut at Kabuki Theater in March, 1959, inheriting the 
professional name of her illustrious grandmother, was pre-
sented with a congratulatory poem by the famous poet, 
Haruo Sato. This poem was reproduced on fans, distributed 
among her friends on that memorable occasion. 
The poem on the fan means: 
Beautiful, young, illustrious! 
Lovely of feature and style, 
In tune with the Japanese dance,

is thought by some to have been used by shira-byoshi 
(professional dancers) as early as the 17th century. 
It is now used chiefly by professionals and geisha 
in their dances, and in some of the Kabuki dances. 
It has a characteristic which sets it apart from all 
other fans. On the inside of the outer or parent 
ribs, near the rivet, is embedded a small rectangular 
piece of lead. The purpose of this is to give the 
fan the required balance when the dancer is twirling 
and tossing it. Such a fan has ten ribs and is 
beautifully decorated. There are, of course, other 
fans used in dancing which do not have the weight. 
In most countries where the fan is still in use, 
it is almost exclusively the toy of women; but in 
Japan from the beginning it has been a man's 
possession. Until the adoption of Western dress 
some fifty years ago, the fan was an essential part 
of a man's costume, even when he dressed himself 
in armor and went to war. Even now it is still 
seen protruding from the breast-pocket of his foreign-
style coat in summer. It is true that in Europe 
during the 18th and 19th centuries the fan reached 
a high degree of popularity with fine gentlemen there; 
but it is quite certain that the use of the fan by 
warriors as an essential part of their uniform is 
unique to Japan. Musha-ogi is the general name for 
warrior's fans. 
Whereas the uchiwa, or flat fan derived from 
the Chinese mask, served both as a shield and as a 
weapon, the sensu, originally of light construction, 
was carried at first merely as a symbol of rank. 
In this connection, the sensu as a warrior's fan is 
first mentioned in the book Honcho Gasan, (Collection 
of JaPanese Pictures), where there is a description

of the fan of Yoshi-iye, a Minato general who helped 
in the defeat of the Taira elan near the end of the 
12th century. It says: "Both faces are coated with 
mica-flakes; one side is painted red, with the sun in 
gold; the other side is white, with the moor in silver. 
The diameter of both sun and moon is four inches. 
The bamboo ribs are 1',2.2" in length I, nd 12 in 
number. The rivet is made of bone anti threaded 
through with scarlet cord." 
The Japanese warrior of that early day would 
no more think of going to war without hi -; fan than 
an English gentleman would think of appearing at 
the opera without his necktie. His fan was thrust 
into his belt at the right side of his armor; the 
sword, at the left. Its decoration was usually 
limited to sun, moon, or stars, with perhaps the 
ideograph for Great Sun or Great Moon. It was 
possible to tell at a glance the rank of the officer 
by looking at the color of the cord and tassel which 
decorated the fan. 
Strict rules of etiquette governed the use of fans 
by day and by night. Also, lesser officers must carry 
their fans only half-open in the presence of a general. 
However, in time of victory fans migh , be opened 
wide. In the book Gempei Seiszti-ki (Re and Fall 
of Genji and Heike Families) , circa 1200, it is 
related that at the end of a victorious battle: 
"Matataro of Ashikaga clan rode up tilt west bank, 
straining in his stirrups. . Pressing dose to the 
main gate of the Byodoin, he leaned on his bow. 
Then, crying out in a loud voice, he opened wide 
his scarlet fan." 
Fans were a common gift from samurai to 
their superiors, or were received by samurai as a

token of a superior's special appreciation of merit. 
When the son of a general became twelve years old, 
he was given an adult fan, at an impressive cere-
mony. Also, the prize given to the winner of a 
contest was quite likely to be a fan. 
There were many old-time military sports, such 
as yabusame, in: which the fan played a part. When 
these archery contests were held, every archer wore 
his fan thrust into his belt. According to the 
Gembun Yabusame-ki, a book on archery written 
about the middle of the 18th century, an archery 
contest was held "on March 19th, the first day of 
the Ox, the third year of Gembun (1736-41), in the 
grounds of the Hachiman shrine at Koshosan. There 
were 16 archers ready on horseback. When the first 
target was held up, followed by the second and third, 
the first archer plucked an arrow from his quiver, 
fitted it to his bow, then opened his suehiro fan 
and arranged his headgear. Starting his horse at 
a gallop, he tossed his fan behind him. Then he 
raised his bow and let fly an arrow at the target." 
In Dai-teki Taihai-ki (Record of Great Archery 
Ceremonies) it is stated that the proper attire for 
this sport in the Kakitsu era (1429-44) included "a 
sword in a bound sheath, a paper-faced fan and 
handkerchief paper as usual." 
One of the earliest stories, probably apocryphal, 
in which a soldier's fan becomes a weapon has been 
perpetuated in a play for the Kabuki stage. It 
concerns Minamoto Yoshitsune, who was instrumental 
in bringing about the victory over the Taira clan 
in the last quarter of the 12th century. .Meeting 
the gigantic militant monk, Benkei, on a bridge, he 
accepted the giant's challenge to a halberd contest.

taking leave of his geisha friend, he received a fan 
from her. Toying with the fan, he exclaimed in 
verse, Mononofu-no, oto atarashiki, og; /canal The 
meaning, "Behold the fresh new far, the breezy 
sound of it!" suggests the new life he will be leading 
in the midst of battle. 
One of the oldest poems connected with the 
warrior's fan, written in the early Karnakura period 
(1182-1334), is recorded in Gempei Seisui-ki. It 
says: "It is dangerous to have the sun on a paper 
fan, when so small a thing as a 'mosquito's eye' is 
needed." The 'mosquito's eye,' of course, is the 
rivet; and the implication is that too great an 
ambition is likely to result in disaster, if through 
lack of co-ordination there is no unity. This may 
refer to the then-recent defeat of the Taira, when 
young Nasu-no Yoichi avoided shooting the sun on 
their fan, but shot out the rivet instead. 
Warfare today is not what it wal- in the days 
of knighthood. One can not imagine the men in 
khaki carrying fans, even iron fans. Nor would 
the best of battle-fans be of any conceivable use now. 
Nevertheless, we cannot help a sigh of regret that 
the warriors' fans and all the other old, picturesque 
fans are now relegated to auction rooms, storehouses 
and museums.

JAPAN'S PERIODICALS-EXTRACTS 
TREND IN LOCAL AUTONOMY 
The recent local elections (held on April 23 and 25) recall to 
our minds afresh the classic saying of Alexis de Tocqueville: "C'est 
pourtant dans la commune que reside la force des peuples libres. Les 
institutions communales sont a la liberte cc que les ecoles primaires 
sont a la Science." It is a well understood fact that local autonomy 
constitutes the very foundation in the communal life of a nation. 
Now, in Japan, it is some years ago that apprehension was expressed 
about local autonomy reaching "crossroads" or "turning point." This 
tendency, much feared at first, and growing recently more serious, is 
apt to be overlooked today, just as are the symptoms of a chronic 
malady. And, just like most chronic illnesses, it has now grown be-
yond an easy cure. 
Of the recent trend in local autonomy, a study should be made 
from three standpoints. First, it should be re-examined in its rela-
tionship with the central government. In this conjunction, we may as 
well admit that the stronger becomes the central administrative power, 
the weaker does local autonomy grow, and vice versa. To be more 
explicit, the increasing power of control by the state will prove to be 
oppressive towards local autonomy; whereas self-restraint exercised on 
the part of state power will safeguard the welfare of local autonomy. 
Secondly, the activities on the part of local autonomy can be broadly 
divided into two kinds: actions and counter-actions, representing "sub-
ordination" and "resistance." The possibility of confrontation between 
the central and local governments is rightly conceived in Chapter VIII 
(Local Government) of the new Constitution. The signing of the, 
Japanese Peace Treaty in 1951 served as a turning point for the 
postwar growth of local autonomous power; since then it began to 
recede in the direction of subordination to state authority. 
Thirdly, the new Constitution, by making a specific provision 
(Chapter VIII) for local autonomy?an unprecedented instance under 
the old Meiji Constitution----offers recognition to our obligation to 
protect local autonomy. Accordingly, any activity tending to cause 
regression in local self-government may be correctly judged as violating 
the constitutional provision. From those three essential viewpoints, let

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN-
us now observe the recent trend in different fields f local self-gov-
ernment. 
1. Regarding the existing administrative structur of local auton-
omous government, much doubt has been expressed ately of its dual 
character; namely the existence of to-do-fu-ken (prefer 'tires) above shi-
cho-son (cities, towns and villages), both being loc.,I public entities 
as defined in Articles 92 and 93 of the Constitution. This dual char-
acter, indubitably, constitutes a major cause for ineffi, ency and waste, 
for which local self-government is frequently rebuked As a measure 
for improvement, the Research Commission on Le al Government, 
in view of continued expansion of cities and towns, iroposed in 1957 
the abolition of to-do-fu-ken (prefectures) and the :stablishment in 
their stead of 9 new regions, governable by regional t ffices, its branch 
and sub-branch offices. The reform measure, however may entail the 
danger of weakening the power of local public ent -ies, particularly 
when the regional government offices, with their gov rnors appointed 
by the central government, become more closely corrected with the 
central administrative power. Moreover, with the fro ,ible strengthen-
ing of police authority under such reform, local self- overnment may 
completely lose its rwson d'?e, such as is asserted trader the Con-
stitution. 
2. A continued increase has been witnessed of ire in the budg-
etary appropriations for subsidy grants and equalizatior funds for local 
self-government. Such budgetary appropriations, II( wever, are not 
always beneficial to local public entities. (1) Becau _r of them, the 
local public entities are left wide open for interferenc by the central 
government. (2) The complicated procedures in thir connection are 
liable to strengthen a tie between the personnel of the Jcal government 
and specific offices of the central government. (3) The kinds and 
amount of such subsidies and funds are determined ur laterally by the 
central government, with the result that they frequer ly create inad-
vertent problems in local finance, an inadequate ap aopriation very 
often causing heavy expenditure in the local budget Furthermore, 
in case of retrenchment in the national budget, th, effect will be 
directly felt in the execution of important projects by t e local govern-
ment in the fields of social welfare, education, constru, ion, etc. 
3. In short, local finance, as well as administrati n, tends to be, 
subordinated to direct or indirect control by the cent al government, 
due mainly to the financial instability of individual loco public entities. 
During the few years prior to the promulgation of tY Law for the 
Promotion of Reconstruction of Local Finance (Law N, 195) in 1955, 
the number of local public entities (prefectures, cities, towns and vil-
lages) suffering deficits in their budgets increased thre, -fold from 764 
132

JAPAN'S PERIODICALS-EXTRACTS 
to 2,281, with the deficits increasing six-fold from Y10,200,000,000 to 
Y64,900,000,000. The law, having as its objective, the elimination of 
such deficits in local finance, proposes administrative reform, personnel 
readjustment, curtailment in enterprise, the promotion of tax collection, 
etc. under the supervision of the Autonomy Agency. Of those various 
reform measures, a strong voice has been raised by local communities 
in protest particularly against personnel readjustment, the merger of 
towns and villages, the delayed reconstruction work in case of natural 
calamity damage, the lowered administrative level, the increase in local 
tax, and so forth. 
As a result of the merger effected among towns and villages, their 
number decreased, during the three year period of 1955 - 57, from 9,895 
to 3,653, inclusive of 2,300 newborn towns (towns, from 1,970 
to 1,894; and villages,. 7,640 to 1,216) ; whereas the number of cities 
increased from 285 to 543 during the same period. The average city 
has also expanded in area from 34.89 sq. km. to 90.00 sq. km., and in 
population from 5,398 to 11,471. The tangible results achieved in this 
project do not necessarily signify that the merger has always been wel-
comed by local communities. As the merger is usually conducted upon 
recommendation from the central administrative authorities, there have 
been several cases where local residents have put up a strong protest. 
A merger of this kind must be effected through the voluntary efforts 
of local communities concerned. 
The recent local elections, first of their kind under the two-po-
litical-party system, has invited severe criticism from the general public, 
particularly in regard to the fact that election campaigns were conducted 
under the strong influence of the two major political parties. The focal 
point of elections lay not in the welfare of local communities, nor in 
the democratization of local public entities, but in the continued struggle 
between the two major parties over such political issues as the revision 
of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the trade with Communist China, 
etc. The Liberal-Democratic campaigners drew the inference that local 
finance under a Socialist governor would hardly be expected to main-
tain smooth contact with the central administration; while the Social 
Democratic members exhorted that the elections should be the means 
to overthrow the Kishi Government. Both political parties were wrong 
in employing the local elections as a means either to intimidate the 
people, or to attack government power. Both of them erred in dis-
regarding the basic principle of local autonomy, as provided in the 
Constitution. Nor are the Independents to be trusted as what they 
profess to be, for they cannot be expected, under present political 
onditions, to undertake activities without political affiliation. 
4. Prospects for local autonomy are particularly gloomy; as its

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
police and educational systems?the two main pillars of ocal govern-
ment?are shaken almost off their very foundation. The o :ginal Police 
Law (Law No. 196) of 1947 provided for the establishmer of a police 
force as democratic authority to protect the right and fir( cdorn of in-
dividuals, in view particularly, of "promoting the true na tire of local 
autonomy." Since the revision of that law in 1954, the police force 
has come to assume a stronger nationalistic coloring, log ug much of 
its local autonomous character. 
A similar change has occurred in the educational fiel I., where the 
Law for the Establishment of Educational Committees (1948) was 
rescinded in 1956 by the Law for the Local Educational Administra-
tion. The public election of educational committees (7 members in 
a prefecture, and 5 in a city, town, or village) under he old law, 
was replaced by the nomination of such committee meta hers by the 
central authorities, as provided for in the new law. The 4rowing ten-
dency to strengthen the centralization of educational powe culminated 
recently in the adoption of a school teachers' efficiency Ating system 
under Article 40 of the Local Public Service Law of 19 7. It must 
be remembered that the adoption of this system was enfo ced in com-
plete disregard of the provision for "efficiency rating" (Article 10 
Paragraph 2) made in the Regulations for the Natior 11 Personnel 
Authority of 1952. The protest put up by Nikkyoso (Jai an Teachers 
Union) in this connection, or the mass protestation ma ieuvered re-
cently by trade unions and various social and cultural )rganizations 
against the proposed revision of the Police Duties Law, is but a reflec-
tion of the continued resistance on the part of local admin oration. 
Peaceful as the general aspect of local autonomy ma seem today 
under the stabilized conservative leadership, its prospects Ire none too 
bright or promising. The resistance on the part of local communities 
will find its expression in diverse forms of activities aim ng to coun-
teract the development in the centralization of power. In far as such 
resistance is allowed to find an open way to free expres ion, there is 
no need for apprehension. Once forced into complete s ibordination, 
it may explode with ruinous effect. So, in this connection indifference 
may be regarded just as blamable as irresponsibility.

JAPAN'S PERIODICALS-EXTRACTS 
CRISIS FOR THE HOUSE OF COUNCILLORS 
Incidental to the election held on? June 2, this year, the hitherto 
much-discussed topic of "crisis in the House of Councillors" was brought 
to the fore, as the press gave voice to the general opinion and concern 
regarding this subject. The present writer proposes here to analyze 
the nature of this crisis by making a summary review of the development 
and changes that have taken place in the character of the House itself 
during the past twelve years. 
1. Establishment of the Bicameral System. 
Under the new Diet system provided in the new Constitution, the 
House of Councillors superseded the old House of Peers on May 20, 
1947. 
It was in the Japanese Draft Constitution ? known as the Matsu-
moto Draft ? prepared by the Japanese Committee, headed by Dr. Joji 
Matsumoto, and submitted to GHQ, SCAP, that the proposal was origi-
nally made for the establishment of a bicameral system, calling for 
the replacement of the House of Peers with the new House of Coun-
cillors, with its membership either elected by the people, or appointed 
by the Emperor. It should be noted that the Government, in that 
initial stage of drafting the Constitution, favored the selection of the 
membership for the House by means of the Emperor's appointment. 
The bicameral system was proposed likewise in the drafts prepared 
and submitted by the Liberal, Progressive and Social Democratic 
Parties, as well as by Kempo-kenkyu-kai (the Institute for the 
Study of the Constitution), with the sole exception of the Communist 
Party. Narahashi, the Cabinet's Secretary General and Spokesman for 
the Government, urged the necessity for such a system, especially in 
the absence of the Emperor system, the Privy Council, the House of 
Peers, the Army and Navy, etc. Thereupon, GHQ, though doubtful 
of its necessity in a country which was not federated, gave consent on 
condition that the members of the House of Councillors should be 
elected through a plebiscite; and that they should neither be vocational 
representatives, nor members by appointment. 
Now, in order to strengthen its functionary power to prevent any 
possible transgression by the House of Representatives, it was set free 
of possible dissolution, accorded both the national and the local con-
stituencies for the election of its members, and so forth. The estab-
lishment of a national constituency was then considered the best means 
to achieve the basic objective of acquiring for its membership 'nation-.

ally well-known and truly worthy men of learning and exper lence; with 
the future 'possibility for including among them such men is are well-
seasoned in vocational knowledge and experience.' (From the speech 
delivered by State Minister Omura, upon submitting a ow election 
bill to the 91st plenary session of the Diet, 1947.) 
Despite such and other structural differences accorded 1 the House 
of Councillors, the superiority in actual legislative power ws s vested in 
the House of Representatives in connection with, for exam/ le, the de-
cision on budgetary bills, the passage of bills, the ratification of treaties, 
the nomination of the Prime Minister, and so on. 
How could the House of Councillors, thus placed in a ubordinate 
position, perform its duty to "check and balance" the pro eedings of 
the House of Representatives? This lameness in Japan's bicameral 
system has resulted from a series of contradictions admit n 1 into the 
system since its institution; and because of those contrad -tions, the 
people have come to entertain doubt as to the indispensah,lity of the 
House of Councillors. 
2. Changes in the Membership of the House of Couneilt ,;. 
Under the Law for the Establishment of the House of ( ouncillors, 
the first election was held on April 20, 1947. Candidates numbered 
331 for 150 members to be elected in local constituencies, ad 246 for 
100 in the national constituency. 
As the public had not yet familiarized with the existe ce of the 
House of Councillors, the voting percentage was consiclerabl low with 
60.93% in the national constituency and 61.12% in the (real con-
stituencies. The 250 successful returns to the House includg .1 Ill In-
dependents and 13 minor party members (constituting 49,13% of the 
total seats of the House) , 47 Socialists and 4 Communists (2C 1%), and 
38 Liberals, 28 Democrats and 9 National Cooperatives (tr ;-ether ac-
counting for 30%). 
By the time of the second election held in June, 1950, he group, 
named Ryokufukai by Yuzo Yamamoto, had become the lea ling party 
in the House with membership of 91. For 125 eligible ses ts (50 in 
the national constituency, and 75 in the local constituenci ,) and 7 
vacancies (6 in the national and 1 in the local constituen y), there 
were 563 candidates. Out of this election. the Liberals e rerged as 
the leading party, occupying 76 seats in the House (includh .; 52 new 
returns) ; the Socialists foimed the second party with 61 sets (inclu-
sive of 36 new members) , and the Ryokufukai, now with on 50 seats 
(including 9 new members), became the third party. 
A turning point was finally reached in its fourth electio I in July, 
1956, held for the first time under the newly established two-party

political system. Previous to the election, the two major conservative 
parties were merged in November, 1955, in order mainly to secure a 
more stabilized political power, which would enable them .to settle the 
pending problems of rearmament and constitutional revision. By way 
of counteracting the Conservatives' move for a merger, rather than be-
cause of a voluntary urge for unification, the Leftist and Rightist fac-
tions of the Social Democratic Party had carried out a merger one 
month earlier, in October, the same year. 
Thus, it was plain enough that the mergers effected by both 
Conservatives and Socialists were inspired by anything but the true 
purpose of political stabilization. 
The election results (1956) showed the returns to the House 
of 61 Liberal-Democrats, 49 Socialists, 5 Ryokufukai members, 2 Com-
munists, 9 Independents and 1 minor party member. The Social Dem-
ocratic Party, by occupying 80 seats in total, succeeded in securing more 
than one-third of the total seats in the House, and thus eliminated 
the possibility of constitutional revision. 
The same tendency continued in this election, manifesting itself in 
three tangible forms: (1) a remarkable advance attained by the can-
didates with support from bureaucrats and trade unions; the bureaucrat-
supported members took 68 seats with 26 new seats added to 42 won 
in the third election, while Sohyo-supported candidates claimed 32 
among 49 seats won by the Socialists, (2) a complete defeat suffered by 
candidates in the field of culture and learning, and (3) the decline of 
the Ryokufukai as a stabilizing neutral power, as its membership de-
creased from its initial 91 to 31 through the fourth election, and further 
to a bare 20 through subsequent secession of its members to join the 
conservative camp. 
3. Decline of the Ryokufukai. 
The history of the House of Councillors in the past twelve years 
can be roughly divided into two periods: the first period, covering eight 
years from the first session of the Diet (May, 1947) to the 23rd session 
(November, 1955), witnessed the House of Councillors in the role of 
an opposition party; and the second period, from the 24th Diet session 
to the present day, has seen its deterioration under the weight of two-
party politics. 
In the initial period of its establishment, the House of Councillors 
performed its function of "check and blance" with indubitable effi-
ciency: it successfully shelved reactionary bills submitted by the Yoshida 
Cabinet at the 5th ordinary session of the Diet (February--May, 1949), 
and at the 7th extraordinary session (December, 1949--May, 1950) ; 
and, again it succeedtd in killing the Government-proposed loc'al tax-

ation bill by prolonging deliberation. 
The first crisis visited the House of Councillors and, iicidentally, 
the Ryokufukai, when the Bill for the Prevention of Subver ive Activi-
ties. was submitted to the House, immediately following its passage by 
the House of Representatives in 1952. The Government an I the Con-
servatives mobilized every possible means to enforce its pass tge. Over 
against this Conservative drive, the Leftists in the Social Democratic 
Party put up a stiff opposition, while the Rightists were ,nclined to 
favor the amendment to the bill in compromise with the }(vokufukai. 
Now, the members of the Ryokufukai, which actually held he casting 
vote in the matter, were divided into two groups; tit majority 
were won over by the Government and its party, and the remaining 
few sided with the opposition. As a result, the bill was pas ed by 132 
votes against 79; and the attitude of the Ryokufukai mv led severe 
criticism from the public. 
Following the 24th Diet session in 1955, the confrontal ion of the 
two major political parties grew bad to worse in the Ht use. The 
political line-up in the House at that time was 118 Liberal.oemocrats, 
68 Socialists, 47 Ryokufukai members and 13 Independen with 3 
vacancies. Since then, the House has become scenes of viole.t political 
struggle over such important legislation as that concerning he reform 
in education or police authority, all of which have a vital beal ing on the 
democratic development of the Japanese nation. A clash tikes place 
each time when the Government and its party endeavors o enforce 
the passage of a bill on the strength of a majority, and the Jpposition 
Social Democratic Party members resort to violent acts of fihihuster. 
1. Reform of the House of Councillors. 
Such is the true picture of the House of Councillors, row facing 
the crossroads of its destiny. As it is, the House, quoting fr im public 
criticism, is no better than a "carbon copy" of the House nf Repre-
sentatives. The proposed reform of the House includes the following 
three features. 
(1) The system of the national constituency calls for a rt -examina-
tion. First of all, it is not at all an easy task for the voter-, to select 
one candidate out of 120 or more. Secondly, it is almost Lrnpossible 
for candidates to carry out a nation-wide campaign with the !egitimate 
allowance for campaign expense fixed at Y2,700,000. The Lumber of 
candidates in the national constituency decreased from 230 a; the time 
of the third election in 1953, to 150 at the time of the fo u-th elec-
tion in 1956, and further to 123 in the recent fifth electior in June, 
1959. On the contrary, the competition in the national constituency 
has grown so keen that the minimum number of votes won by successful

JAPAN'S PERIODICALS-EXTRACTS 
candidates in the last election was approximately 350,000, which is far 
greater than 68,000 won in the first election in 1947. 
As one reform measure, the abolition of the national constituency 
has been advocated strongly since 1957 by the Liberal-Democratic Party. 
Its abolition may serve to rejuvenate the House; but its replacement, as 
suggested by some, with a reactionary system of selecting its membership 
by appointment will not be in conformity with the constitutional pro-
vision for the democratic growth of the Diet. It is also suggested that 
the system of indirect, cr plural voting be adopted. Election results 
in the past indicate a considerable increase in the Progressive influence 
in the national constituency. In view of this, all the suggestions for 
the abolition of the national constituency should be subjected to a care-
ful re-examination, lest the over-ardent intentions on the part of the 
Conservatives should interfere with the general policy for democratiza-
tion. In this connection, we should always remember the basic prin-
ciple: "Popular vote is the best recommendation for candidates." 
(2) The "restoration of good sense" was the catch phrase used 
by the press at the time of the recent election for the House of 
Councillors. With "good sense" restored, the House will make volun-
tary efforts to drive out the influence of political parties. Both the 
Liberal-Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party alike claim 
justification for the predominance of political influence in the House. 
In so far as these political parties rely on "the strength of a majority" 
or "forcible means," and mobilize their members in the House for 
the single purpose of achieving their political domination, there will 
be little hope for reforming the House of Councillors. Lately, there 
has been an increasing tendency between the two political parties to 
resort to negotiations and compromises, in fear lest they should be 
branded with the obnoxious title of "power politics." Now, such 
negotiations and compromises, may paralyze the vital functioning of the 
system of two-party politics; they may, it is feared, serve in the end 
to create hotbeds for the revival of fascism. 
(3) Lastly, a few words may be necessary concerning reform in 
the existing local constituency system. Readjustment should be made 
to obviate the proportional discrepancy between the numbers of elected 
members and of the voters in these constituencies. According to the 
data published by the Autonomy Agency in May, this year, the same 
number of four members were elected for the House of Councillors 
respectively in Hokkaido with a population of 2,619,000, and in Tokyo, 
having a population of 5,633,000, twice as large as that in Hokkaido. 
In another instance, two members were elected in Gumma Prefecture 
with a population of 770,000, while only one member was elected in 
Akita prefecture with a population of 760,000.

Needless to say, the Conservative influence is stronger ,n the local 
constituencies than in the national constituency. In the list election, 
the Liberal-Democratic Party returned to the House only members 
although it won 39.7% of the votes in the national consi reney, and 
the Social Democratic Party returned 21 members with 29.9' ; whereas, 
in the local constituencies, the Liberal Democratic Party ;1 eturned 42 
members with 48.3%, and the Social Democratic Party, .1.3 members 
with 37.6%. The proposed reform for the establishment of smaller 
constituencies, when viewed in the light of those and other t -cent data, 
seems to lose its much publicized significance. More recotnmendable 
in this connection will be a new election system based n a more 
proportionate representation of "public opinion." 
The much disputed problem of crisis in the House of tlouncillors 
urgently calls for various reform measures, such as those sun Tnarized in 
the foregoing. Nevertheless, the writer adds in conclusion, .al such re-
form measures should be re-examined carefully, lest they slu ild harbor 
any ulterior motive other than the progress of democratizati? .n.

that she is permitted to possess an armed military force for her na-
tional defense. Now that the procurators have appealed to the Supreme 
Court, it will not be long before the public will learn of the final 
judgement on the case; and this judgement, as coming from the Su-
preme Court, will, it is hoped, put an end to all arguments over Article 
9 of the Constitution.* 
In interpreting Article 9 of the Constitution, some people place 
an inordinate emphasis on its history?how it came to be drafted; under 
what circumstances it was drafted; what was in the mind of those 
who drafted it; and so on. One answer to those queries will be that 
the basic principle in reading the Constitution is that it should be read 
in reference to the present and to the future, but not to the past; as? 
the people say, "the dead can no longer rule over the living," it should 
be read and interpreted in such a manner as to render it adaptable to 
prevalent conditions. Thus, the Constitution of the United States of 
America, proclaimed at the end of the 18th century, has remained in 
force throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, causing no impediment 
in the development and progress of that country. Therefore, the, 
historical background, however weighty it may be, should be regard-
ed as a subordinate factor, and treated as such, in the study of the 
Constitution. 
The reading of various records and documents pertaining to the 
drafting of the Constitution, as well as to the postwar Occupation of 
Japan, reveals that the very idea embodied in Article 9 was conveyed 
to Gen. Douglas MacArthur by the then Prime Minister Kijuro Shi-
dehara on the occasion of their conference at GHQ on January 24, 
1946. Prime Minister Shidehara, himself an ardent pacifist, proposed 
the inclusion in the new Constitution of Japan's renunciation of war 
and war potentials. To this, General MacArthur gave consent, for 
he was of the same opinion as the Prime Minister that the inclusion 
of the provision to that effect would, at the same time, serve to 
eliminate apprehension on the part of neighboring countries, and safe-
guard the Tenn? system. Both Gen. MacArthur and the Prime Min-
ister kept that discussion to themselves; as a result, the general im-
pression was created that the originator of Article 9 was mine other

Article 9. Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and 
order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation 
and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. 
In order to accomplish' the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and 
air forces, as well as other War potential,. will never be maintained. The right' 
of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.

than Gen. MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the All ed Powers, 
himself. Most probably, that general impression was jus what the 
Prime Minister was seeking, as he was averse, of course, to Airring up 
commotion over the issue so vitally important to the Japan( ,e nation. 
As clearly understood from Gen. MacArthur's note has .led to the 
Government Section, GHQ, in conjunction with the draft rig of the 
Constitution, Prime Minister Shidehara wished to invoke t re ideal of 
absolute pacifism by setting forth the provision that Japan thould not 
resort to war even in case of self-defense. The officials in tie Govern-
ment Section, GHQ, were rather skeptical about such a bdd expres-
sion being given to idealism; and, accordingly, they maintax led a "tol-
erant attitude" towards this subject, quoting Tatsuo Sato, rne of the 
government officials who participated in the drafting of the C )nstitution. 
When the Draft Constitution was submitted to deliben-- ion in the 
Japanese Diet, two important amendments were made to Art ;le 9 upon 
suggestions proposed by Dr. Hitoshi Ashida and other mem )ers of the 
House of Representatives. Those amendments were the ,ddition of 
the phrase, "Aspiring sincerely to an international peace ba ed on jus-
tice and order," to the opening of the first clause, and the ther addi-
tion of "In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding Jaragraph" 
to the beginning of the second clause. Dr. Ashida, later Or explained 
that those amendments were made to Article 9, so that it might not 
be applied to national defense. The GHQ officials, although they made 
no comment, were also cognizant of the fact that the amend. 1 Article 9 
would no longer prevent Japan from having armament .r national 
defense. 
By way of answer to those who assume that Gen. MacArthur 
changed his opinion afterwards, the writer, quoting from ti e letter he 
received from the General, states that Gen. MacArthur unde ,tood, even 
at the time of drafting, that Article 9 would not interfere tk:th Japan's 
armed resistance against foreign aggression. 
Some may, then, suggest the annulment of Article 9 on the ground 
that it has lost its raison d'?e. To them, the author rroposes to 
construe General MacArthur's views as follows. "Article 9 is precious 
in that it reminds the Japanese of the ineffaceable trap. dy of the 
prewar militarism. Also, it is important in that it indicates I all states-
men the way to the peace of the world, even in this r.tomic age. 
Moreover, it is an imperishable memorial, symbolizing Prit e Minister 
Shidehara's foresight, wisdom and statesmanship. For th. se reasons, 
the Japanese should all the more carefully preserve it." 
Such views as given above, based on the recognition it once of 
ideals and of reality are not creditted exclusively to Gen. MacArthur. 
The basic principle of racial equality, embodied in the Cox ititution of

JAPAN'S PERIODICALS-EXTRACTS 
the United States, has been respected throughout the past century, with-
out any question being raised as to its adaptability, because it is the 
ideal which humanity is forever seeking after. Noble ideals are often 
embodied in the constitutions of various countries, sometimes, giving 
them an air of almost political manifestos. In studying such con-
stitutions, it is necessary, of course, to make, so to speak, a "double-
tracked" interpretation of provisions, recognizing ideal and reality at 
the same time. Viewed in this light, it is a mistake to read the Con-
stitution in the same manner as would be adopted in reading the 
Commercial Code or the Criminal Code. The best guide for reading 
the Constitution is what Judge John Marshall of the U.S. Supreme 
Court has once said: "We must not forget that we are reading the 
Constitution." 
The Japanese government accepted Article 9 with the understand-
ing that disarmament was a part of the Allied Powers' policy. The 
then State Minister Kanamori explained before the Diet that Japan 
possessed the right to national defense, but could not arm herself under 
the second clause of Article 9. Subsequently, the opinion was pro-
pagated throughout the nation that absolute disarmament was the goal 
set for peaceful Japan. Since a nation's right to defend herself recog-
nizes armed resistance against foreign aggression, there was a funda-
mental contradiction in State Minister Kanamori's interpretation of 
Article 9. When scholars, as well as the public, accepted State Min-
ister Kanamori's theory, and endeavored to form their opinion on that 
hypothesis, confusion was let loose in their arguments, not only over 
the provisions in question, but also extending over the controversial 
issues of Japan's rearmament, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, etc. 
The inherent tendency among Japanese is to accord inordinate 
importance to, and thereby endeavor to justify, an academic theory, 
or any opinion commonly shared by scholars (communis opinio doc-
torum,) whereas Americans or Englishmen would accept it only as a 
hypothesis without precedents. Sometimes, an academic theory may 
be an error committed in common by scholars (communis error doc-
torum). Admitting such a possibility, it becomes necessary to probe 
further into the views prevalent in the academic field. 
Meantime, the National Police Reserve was reorganized into the 
Safety Force, and then into the Self-Defense Force, which is now 
not much different from a military force. It was but natural that the 
public should criticize this attempt of the Government as a violation 
of the constitutional provision. The Government, adhering to the Ka-
narnori theory on the one hand, continues in its endeavor to expand 
the national defense force on the other, by utilizing the right to defense 
as a strategic spear-head. This bold attempt on the part of the Gov-

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
ernment to achieve contrary effects while strictly adhering td its original 
Kanamori theory has brought about the general impression hat it has 
been abusing the constitutional provision for the purpose of ;Jromoting, 
its armament policy. 
Thus, the disputes over Article 9 have eventually led to ;the current 
controversial issue of constitutional revision. Both pros ard cons of 
the argument being based on the hypothesis that armament is forbidden 
under Article 9, the advocates for the revision contend the r the Oc-
cupation-imposed Constitution requires amendment, while the opposi-
tion maintain that such a revision will lead to armament and war. 
They carry on futile, ideological arguments, forgetting, in the heat of 
their controversy, the most imminent problem?the question ,if how to 
ensure the security of the nation. Whatever ideological confrontation 
there may be, the controversy should be conducted with the docal point 
set upon actual, intrinsic problems, leaving room always for justifiable 
compromise. Otherwise, it will probably develop into, so i o speak, 
a cancer in Japanese politics, or into hotbeds for power poll: ics of the 
two extremes. 
To summarize the foregoing, there are three ways of reading Ar-
ticle 9. (1) Japan is not permitted to rearm even for he national 
defense. (2) Japan is permitted to have limited rearmameri for self-
defense. (3) Japan is permitted to have rearmament for Sdf-defense. 
Under (1) and (2), the existence in Japan of U.S. inilitai bases is 
in violation of the Constitution, whereas it is permissible Under (3). 
In die Sunakawa case the attorneys for defense must have'taken view 
(1), while the procurators based their indictments on (3). Now, the 
Supreme Court has to make its decision between (1) and (ri 
If the Supreme Court pronounces its judgement based (I), the 
Government's rearmament policy, even for self-defense, bet otnes un-
constitutional. If the judgement is based on (3), the Social Democratic 
Party's claim for disarmament and neutrality will still be justified as 
constitutional, since permission for armament under the Cons dtution is 
one thing, and the armament policy is definitely anotlier; only, the 
Party will no longer be able to use Article 9 as a means -0 attack 
the Government. If the Supreme Court decides not to ref 'r to the 
reading of Article 9, the question will remain unanswered, lea .-ing that 
problematical provision wide open for continued controversial a i!.isurnents. 
Once the Supreme Court pronounces its judgement eith( on (1) 
or on (3), the Government's disapproval, or the Social r). mocratic

BOOK REVIEWS 
THE POPULATION OF JAPAN by Irene B. Tauber. 
Published by Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., 
U.S.A., 1958; quarto size, pp. 460, $15.00. 
No one knows how many milleniums have passed since God 
advised Noah, after the Flood, to "be fruitful and multiply." But, 
through the centuries the people of the earth, following thi: directive 
literally, have increased by geometric progression; until now, in spite 
of wars and countless other disasters, the teeming population of many 
a country has become a matter of grave concern. Not onl . does this 
trouble the leaders of such a country, it also poses a probl-in for the 
whole world family of nations. If the solution of tl-w problems 
involved is left entirely to the future, only world-wide disa ter can be 
expected. Now as never before we must say, "No man riTeth unto 
himself," whether as a person or as a nation. 
As a step towards meeting the threat of over-populiaion, indi-
viduals and organizations are devoting time in the intensii., research 
and study of demography in the over-crowded countries, gathering 
vital and social statistics concerning man's origin, die -elopment, 
geographical distribution, physical characteristics, and culture. This 
study is not intended as a cure in itself for over-population: rather, its 
purpose is to offer a background for an understanding of what has 
been done and what can be done in solving this pressing problem. 
A leading scholar in this field is Dr. Irene B. Taeuber, he author 
of this book, the publication of which by the Princeton University 
Press has been made possible by the financial assistance of ti: Milbank 
Memorial Fund, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Ford Foundation. 
Not only is Dr. Taeuber a research associate of the Office nf Popula-
tion Research at Princeton; she is also co-editor of Popula Lion Index 
and Population Literature; she has served as consultant in demography 
at the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the Pacific 
Science Board of the National Research Council, and thf Research 
and Development Board of the Department of Defense she was 
formerly president of the Population Association of America; and is 
a writer of magazine articles on demography. 
Dr. Taeuber, choosing Japan as the subject of this inter,ive study, 
points out in her Preface that in this country, which has never been 
colonial, some sort of statistics have been kept ever since her early

cultural contact with China in the T'ang dynasty, more than a thousand 
years ago; and that, from the time of her dealing with Europeans 
Japan has made use of modern statistical techniques. This has resulted 
in an accumulation of data concerning the effects on Japan of her 
relations with other countries, particularly with the South Seas and 
mainland China. Dr. 'Faeuber feels that a study of Japan's progress 
from an agrarian to an industrial society is of value in relation to the 
accompanying population changes. Such a study may well help in 
understanding the possible population variations which are occurring 
or are likely to occur in other oriental countries which are now free 
from colonial status, but are nevertheless being pushed into the scientific 
age by the impact of Western technology. 
For convenience the material is presented here in seven divisions. 
PART I takes up The Population in the Premodern Period, dealing 
with the Formation and Growth: the Beginnings to the Twelfth 
Century; and showing the Changing Population: Late Twelfth to 
Mid-Nineteenth Century. PART II shows The Transition, 1852-
1918, tracing the Increase and Redistribution. PART III deals with 
The Changing Population, 1920-1955, describing The Bases and the 
Patterns, and The Economically Active Population, and The Family. 
PART IV takes up the subject of Migration, in relation to Industri-
alization, and the movement to Cities and Metropolitan Areas. PART 
V, under Expansion, the author describes the Frontiers of Settlement 
and Utilization, and the Imperial Expansion. PART VI: as Natural 
Movements the author considers the effects on population of Marriage, 
Fertility, The Control of Fertility, Mortality, and Natural Increase. 
PART VII discusses Demography in Peace and War, with Problems, 
Projections, and Policies; and takes a look at Past and Present. 
As an indication of the thoroughness on which this book is based, 
consider the fact that t41 Tables, 29 sets of Statistical Figures and 18 
Maps are given, in order that an all-round understanding of Japan's 
population problems may be grasped by the scholar who consults this 
book: Also there are footnotes, abundant and copious, which amplify 
the text, explain it, or refer to further sources of information. 
As Appendices there are, besides a brief Chronology, a Glossary 
of imMense value, and a list of Agencies and Institutions and of 
Periodicals consulted. To complete this stupendous piece of work, there 
is given a Bibliography of 66_pages. 
It is safe to say that the author has assembled here such 
voluminous information as has never before been gathered in one 
volume; and it is of such variety that the inquirer can surely find in 
this book the answer to any question he may wish to ask about Japan's 
population.

scholastic thoroughness with objectivity, and must provide' idditional 
understanding of inadequately understood historical trends 1,r events; 
the award is not given to manuscripts which have a prejudice o defend 
or a product to sell. It is essential that this explanation b born in 
mind when reading this book, because the subject is controx rsial and 
the reader, depending on his preconceptions, might unjus.[1, accuse 
the author of political bias. 
Although the title of the book emphasizes the Axis All Alice, the 
main thesis of the book is that in 1941, "there was no immee'ate clash 
in basic American and Japanese strategic aims bound to lea( the two 
nations to war." The author maintains that the Japanese ttack on 
Pearl Harbor was an "act of desperation, not madness;" and that 
"Japan fought only when she had her back to the wall as a result of 
America's diplomatic and economic offensive." 
This is not the first book to defend this thesis; but, nlike its 
predecessors, this book does not accuse, apologize, nor extol 4 alter the 
nations or leaders involved. For example, the author assesses he -back 
to the door" theory (that Roosevelt goaded Japan to attack in order 
to enter the European war; a theory espoused by Charles BcarL Charles 
Tansill, Rear Admiral Theobald, etc.), and he concludes lhat this 
theory is "incredible." He also examines the theories th Japan 
attacked the United States because of over-confidence or tl Hitler 
pushed Japan into war, and concludes that available evidert makes 
these theories impossible to accept." Instead, the "author maintains 
that war resulted because the United States followed "a sir ere and 
uncompromising adherence to moral principles and liberal d Petrines," 
which made it impossible to negotiate a settlement with Japan and made 
"inevitable an unnecessary and avoidable war." 
Prior to July of 1941, Japan was on the diplomatic fTensive, 
confident, militant, and intransigent, while the United States was on 
the defensive. Gradually, as a result of the American emb,,, go, the

positions of the two nations was reversed and the diplomatic advantage 
passed to the United States.. From July to November 29th the United 
States could have negotiated a modus vie endi which could have avoided 
or, at least, postponed war. This did not occur because American 
public opinion, following the leadership of Secretary of State Cordell 
Hull, was almost unanimous in its opposition to Japan. Japan's con-
quest of Manchuria, her repeated attacks on China, her occupation of 
Indochina, were actions contrary to the absolute ideals of international 
morality advanced by Hull as American foreign policy. Being an 
idealistic policy, it was an inflexible policy; and, because Americans 
supported this policy, it made "any change in that policy extremely 
difficult, if not impossible, to achieve." 
Secretary Hull, by emphasizing moral principles, had surrendered 
control of United States diplomacy to the American people. It was 
impossible to negotiate with Japan because the United States could 
not compromise nor offer concessions, believing that one cannot com-
promise with evil. This meant that peace depended on the willingness 
of Japan to accede to American demands. Japan was willing to com 
promise, but neither the Japanese nor their leaders would accept total 
surrender without a struggle. Thus, when diplomacy became inopera-
tive, war was inevitable. The mistake made by the United States was 
one of substituting abstract ideals for a realistic policy. 
States, by nature, are not personalities; thus, they cannot be 
treated as morally responsible persons. As George Kennan contends, 
the right role for moral considerations in foreign affairs is not to 
determine policy, but rather to soften and ameliorate actions necessarily 
based on the realities of world politics. But Americans (not just a few 
leaders) accepted a rigid, idealistic foreign policy and went to war 
because they believed that war was preferred "to any compromise or 
limitation of the nation's aims." 
Obviously, this is an informative and stimulating book which should 
be read and its contemporary implications understood by both Ameri-
cans and Japanese. It is not a historical narrative and, consequently, 
the average reader may wish that additional historical background had 
been included. However, as an analysis of the immediate events prior 
to Pearl Harbor it is one of the best books on the subject. 
The book is clearly written, concise, and scholarly; it is well 
documented and includes a fairly extensive bibliography. The least 
rewarding section of the book is the final chapter dealing with the War 
Crimes Trials in Tokyo. This chapter is sketchy, disrupts the continuity 
of the book, and reads like a partially developed afterthought. With 
this exception, the book is well worth reading.

JAPAN: THEME AND VARIATION, A Collection 
of Poems by Americans. Published by . Charles E. Tuttle, 
Tokyo, 1958; pp. 183, Y900 in Japan, $3.00 elsewhere. 
"The curves are pointed and the angles curv, : 
The theme and variations follow through. 
Where did the roofs and gables learn their sweep?" 
In this contest-loving age it would be good to have :nore such 
fruit as we find in this collection of "Poems by Americans,- the result 
of contest-encouraged comment on things Japanese. Only 252 poems 
have been chosen from among the 1700 proffered in the contest of 
1957-58; but within this accepted group are titles and styles of great 
variety, some expressed in the freest of free verse, some conventionally 
American, some patterned after Japanese poetic forms, and all evi-
dencing such an interest in Japan as could never have becn foreseen, 
with or without the impulse to poetry, as recently as ten years ago. 
Not all of the writers are connected with the Military Fori-s, but no 
doubt the attraction felt by great numbers of Japan's present-day allies 
is responsible for much of this sincere response. 
There are those who, having lived in Japan, indulge in nostalgia: 
"You who have come from far away, 
From the land of my past days, 
You who know all its wonders and its glories, 
Tell me just one thing: 
Does the pomegranate tree beside the gate 
still blossom in the spring?" 
There is the spontaneous outburst of those now living in japan: 
"All, all is beauty, 
Seen aright; 
Who misses the mountain 
Sees the bird 
And is satisfied." 
Some still dream of the Japan of history, art and folklol 
"Did you go to look at cherry blossoms 
and never even think to count your chert jet? 
I shall someday. 
Did you have a house all uncluttered? 
And let your eyes caress the grain of wood? 
I could."

Emotion restrained and pictorially presented suggests appreciation 
of Japanese self-control: 
"Just a woman dressed in black 
Standing by the railroad track, 
As the train goes outward bound; 
And her bearing does not say 
Who it is that goes away: 
One who made her pulses stir, 
Or a guest who worried her." 
There is seen also the impatience of the outspoken, but inarticulate, 
frustrated one: 
"Stinking 'little bitch of a hill 
they call a mountain in this 
imprecise language   
what right 
have you to hide so 
behind this awful mist 
and rip and jerk my eyes out . 
trying to penetrate   
Little humor, and still less religious theme, can be especially noted; 
but where such approach is made, it is handled with a restrained, quiet 
touch which is well suited to the background values of life in Japan. 
All in all, the poems are a worthy bit of inspiration toward furthering 
the whole-hearted expression of what could hardly have been expected 
as a result of the Occupation and postwar activity. But to all who 
know Japan well, there is nothing here beyond the understanding. And 
next? Perhaps we may look forward to a similar collection of poems 
(in English) by Japanese, with America and the Americans for their 
"theme and variations." Equally unexpected values might result from 
such a gesture of friendship as is seen in such a contest.

ZEN FLESH, ZEN BONES, A Collection of Zen I+ 'itings 
compiled by Paul Reps. Published by Charles E. Tutt:/ . Co., 
Tokyo, Japan, and Rutland, Vt.? U.S.A. pp. 211, prict Y800 
in Japan, $3.00 in U.S.A. 
Within the covers of this book Paul Reps has brough together 
four ancient manuscripts. Each has previously been publi died sepa-
rately: 101 Zen Stories in 1939 by Rider & Co., London, and by David 
McKay Co., Philadelphia; The Gateless Gate in 1934 by John Murray, 
Los Angeles; 10 Bulls in 1935 by de Vorss & Co., Los Angeks, and by 
Ralph R. Phillips, Oregon; and Centering in 1953 in the Spring Issue 
of Gentry Magazine, New York. To have them together wder one 
cover will be an advantage to one who is interested in the stn!y of Zen. 
The first half of the book consists of the "101 Zer, Stories" 
which were collected and published in Japan in the late 13th century. 
These stories are anecdotes, sometimes parables, which Tairport to 
reveal something which cannot be revealed, namely, the spirit or 
essence of Zen. They are clear, yet vague; their vaguene- may be 
due in part to the artistic vagueness of the Japanese languagt in which 
they were recorded. But this very mistiness has a strong appeal for 
a certain type of mind. Whereas it is not too difficult to- 1:rasp the 
point of the parables of Jesus, these stories of Zen are intendr'd to give 
you food for thought, a cud to chew on, something to mu' over for 
a long time. 
Thinking of the name of this volume, would it not be better to 
call it "Skin, Flesh & Bones of Zen"? The skin is that whv h we see 
and which gives us an idea of what lies with in the body of Zen. The 
flesh is that which gives shape and substance to the body of Zen. And 
the bones, the skeleton, is that which gives pattern and saability to 
the body of Zen. 
Reading these "101 Zen Stories" is like starting on a.hag of 
peanuts; one keeps eating on and on, finding it hard to stop. But as 
for the point of any one of these anecdotes, it may be a long time be-
fore its meaning comes clear, if ever. Zen seems to be based on 
negation, on emptying oneself of all evil, on the presumption !hat man 
is inherently, essentially good, and so there is no need for teaching 
about how to fill oneself with goodness. 
In the next fifty pages, called "Mu-mon, the Gateless (ate," we. 
find forty-nine little stories, each with a poem as an explanatory com-
ment by the monk Mu-mon. 
The word Zen itself comes from the Sanskrit, from India through 
China, and means meditation. Through self-searching meditation

comes the emancipation of one's mind. The stories in this Mu-mon-
kan, literally the no-gate barrier, were assembled and recorded by1 the 
Chinese monk Eikai, 1183-1260, and are considered one of the classic 
texts of Zen Buddhism. Each of these problems is set forth as a barrier 
in itself, the barrier being the shell of man's limited mind, or mentality, 
which must be broken through in order to admit him to enlighten-
ment, i.e. knowing. 
The original writer of this section says that a person who tries to 
arrive at an understanding of Zen through the explanation of another 
is like a man "who scratches an itching foot from the outside of a 
shoe." He likens a "koan," as these parables are called, to a brick 
which is used to knock at a gate and is then thrown away, being no 
longer useful once the gate is opened. Perhaps modern man would 
liken a "koan" to "a nut to crack," the shell being thrown away when 
one gets the meat out. 
This section is replete with startling similes, metaphors and 
idioms, striking enough in themselves to break down a gate, such as 
"Like a dumb man who has had a dream; he knows about it, but he 
cannot tell it." Whether any of these "koan" stories would provide 
fresh illustrations for a public speaker depends, Zen would say, upon 
whether or not the said speaker was "enlightened." But there are 
rich possibilities here. 
The next section of 23 pages is called "10 Bulls." In the 12th 
century the Chinese master, Kakuan, drew the pictures and wrote the 
verses and captions of this, perhaps first, story-in-pictures, thus ante-
dating the modern funny-strips by eight centuries. But "10 Bulls" is 
different from the modern animated cartoon strips in that it is the 
conveyance for a spiritual teaching. It depicts the steps taken in the 
discovery of oneself and of one's potentialities. The pictures used in 
this book are not the originals, but were drawn by Tomikichiro Toku-
riki, a well-known wood-block artist. 
Seeking the bull signifies the search for the eternal principle of 
life. Finding the hoof-prints of the bull indicates that the seeker has-
gotten on the right path towards understanding the teachings. Hearing 
the sound of the bull shows that one's senses have become sensitive to 
the teachings. Catching the bull reveals the difficulty of subjugating 
such overwhelming knowledge to one's understanding. Taming the 
bull reminds one that constant application is necessary if one hopes 
to channel his knowledge into true enlightenment. Riding the bull 
home suggests that one's mastery of knowledge has been asserted 
beyond denial. The bull transcended intimates that the means by 
which knowledge has been conquered and assimilated is now no longer 
needed. Both bull and self transcended points out that, with complete-

by Japan Travel Bureau, 1958; pp. 262, Y600 in Japan, 0.25 
elsewhere. 
This history is number 15 of the Tourist Library Set- es and is 
intended to give the ordinary visitor an introduction to the lostory and 
the culture of Japan. That it does this well should be vident to 
every reader. There is an abundance of illustration, and th reviewer 
found this aspect one of the most appealing phases. What t lacks in 
detail because of its shortness, it makes up for by its wealth of photo-
graphs, maps and charts. 
The author, Dr. Saburo Ienaga, is an authority in cultut 11 history; 
and this book represents an emphasis upon that aspect. Thus, instead of 
over-attention being given to the civil wars leading to the est-blishment 
of the Shogunate, much stress is placed upon the role of th ordinary 
Japanese, who has had to bear the burden of the extreme cet tralization 
of authority represented by the Bakufu. As an example: 
"The tillers of the soil . . . were placed pretty high tp in the 
social scale, next to the samurai. But what was actually resected was 
not so much the farmer himself as his produce . . . As a tax every 
fanner had to deliver an average of 50% of his harvest. la addition 
he had to do manual labor as a form of surtax. Povet v-stricken 
farmers sought to lighten their economic burdens now checking 
further increase in the family by illegal abortion, and now cawing riots."

BOOK REVIEWS 
While such information may not come as any surprise to those 
familiar with the great agrarian revolts in Europe, it does tend to 
balance and to put in perspective the tendency of looking upon feudal 
Japan as the time when the tea ceremony, Kabuki and the art of 
haiku held full sway. 
However, the author shows no tendency to neglect the great cultural 
influences. Quite the contrary; for all of the various arts, including 
ukiyoe, the wood-block print art, are thoroughly treated. 
There is adequate treatment of the great Meiji reforms; and the 
reader gets a satisfactory picture of the rise and growth of militarism, 
culminating in World War II. The author does not discuss the history 
of the war, perhaps because it is of too recent and painful memory. 
To this extent, such a volume would have to be supplemented by 
other more complete histories. However, it is doubtful if this would be 
of any consequence to the audience for which this book was written. 
There is a good summary of postwar developments, and a really ex-
cellent chronological table and bibliography complete the book. 
One has the final feeling that this is one of the more distinguished 
volumes published in this library. The traveller or beginning student 
of Japanese history could profitably start his study of Japan with this 
volume. Indeed, even the advanced student will find it worth in-
cluding in his own library.

This excellent survey of Munakata's prints, compiled by Yojuro

its numerous plates the complexity and range of Munakata's work.

in the prints reproduced. Plates 11 through 20 arc of the Ten Great

Munakata win his grand prizes at the Sao Paulo Biennale in 1955 and 
the Venice Biennale in 1956, and which some critics feel are among 
his greatest works. Dramatic in their elongated form, which allows 
them to be hung in the traditional Japanese way as kakemono, and 
strong in their contrast of black line on white surface in traditional 
oriental severity, Munakata says of them, "I first became conscious of

of the block, top, bottom, and both sides." 
Not all of his subjects are the historical Buddhist figures of the 
Shaka or the various Bosatsu or saints, though this may be the source 
of much of his inspiration. Many are creatures of his oWi imagina-
tion, which Munsterberg refers to when he discusses the voluptuous 
earth-goddesses or angels, although perhaps vaguely connected with the 
yakski and apsarases of ancient Indian Buddhism." Some of he Muna-

which tell the story of "the river of trickery" and of the legerpiary water

use of stylized calligraphy to form part of the design, a technilue shown 
in many of the prints reproduced here. Munakata is too p, werful an 
artist to reproduce literally from the past; rather, all his subjects are 
stamped with his personal conception and imagination; the raditional, 
when called upon, is filtered through his particular originalit 
Inherent in the artistry of Munakata is the Zen concep of muga, 
which is best explained by Langdon Warner: "The princip. of muga 
(it is not I that is doing this) opens the gate for the necessl essential 
truth to flow in. When the self does not control the dr awini meaning 
must." It is this renunciation of self that Munakata reflect when he 
describes the power of the wooden board that must be br ,ught into 
a working relationship with him, a power that exists outst le of the 
artist, and which he emphasizes in his Japanese word for voodblock 
pint, hanga, by which he stresses the importance of the basit materials 
rather than the artist. Speed is another concept vital to ti :e oriental 
artist; and Munakata creates with quick, furious activity, xi aiting the 
meaning of his subject and the techniques he has mastered brilliant 
fusion, without rational interference. 
Munakata was the third son of the twelve children of a -,lacksmith 
and was born in Aomori, northern Japan, in 1903. As he wf rked with 
his father at the forge, his life was permeated with the religiot concepts 
of Shintoism which brought to the forge the spirit of the:woods, the 
earth and the sky. Since he won his first international priz, in 1951, 
Munakata has signed his prints with the special pine-needle niirk which 
his grandfather placed on swords, which his father placed n cutting 
tools, and which he himself uses to acknowledge his heritage i devoted 
craftsmanship. 
With this family background, it is not surprising that qunakata 
stands apart from the modern Japanese woodblock artists am. instead, 
identifies himself with the folkcraft or mingei tradition. It kas Soetsu 
Yanagi, acknowledged leader of this movement in Japan, who rst recog-
nized the genius of Munakata and encouraged hint, uniting lern closely

with those other artists who presserve the historical folkcraft traditions 
in their modern work and who believe in the concepts of Buddhism. 
This patronage was invaluable to Munakata: "Mingei gave birth to 
me. Yanagi showed me how much stronger a man can be when he 
shares his strength with others, and draws on their strength in return. 
He taught me that greatness cannot be achieved alone." It was through 
Dr. Yanagi that Munakata learned his method of adding watercolor to 
the back of the print instead of on top of it, a process used in some of 
his more recent work show in this book. 
The comments of Munakata which accompany many of the prints 
give an excellent insight into his artistic goals; and, by the same token, 
afford greater appreciation of his artistic achievements. With the 
monster-like creatures in plates 33 and 36, figures caught between the 
human state and Buddhahood, which were carved from the unplaned 
boards of old apple boxes, he mastered the use of white lines and black 
masses. Concerning the powerful "Flower Hunting Mural." the picture 
of hunters without arrows because they are hunting flowers and must 
hunt with their hearts, lie says that he is striving to go beyond effects: 
"I don't want my work to spring from my artist's assertiveness over my 
materials. I want it to flow naturally from these materials." The 
prints that he considers his best are from a series of 24 which are based 
on the poems of the famous novelist Junichiro Tanizaki, and are shown 
in plates 75 and 76; fo r in these all the craftsmanship and techniques 
he has mastered have been utilized. 
There are many stories of the exuberant and energetic personality 
of Munakata, and there are some indications of his humor here. In 
plate 54, "And to Nurse Sick Children," a print of friendly devils, there 
is one figure in the right-hand corner which looks like Munakata when 
young, according to -Munakata. In plate 56 there is a tengu, a long-
nosed goblin. "A boastful creature," says Munakata. "Maybe me." 
Most of the prints that won for him the international prize at 
Locarno in 1951 and the grand prizes at the Sao Paulo Biennale in 
1955 and at the Venice Biennale in 1956 are included here. The book 
itself is about 7" x 41/2" in size, and the plates only suggest the magnitude 
of the actual prints; but, considering that the aim of this book is to 
present a comprehensive selection of the achievements of this artist in 
an inexpensive edition, it can be said that the aim is most admirably 
accomplished. This is one of a series that is planned to cover all the 
major figures in the field of Japanese art, which Charles E. Tuttle will 
publish in an English edition for Western readers through arrangement 
with Kodansha, the original Japanese-language publisher.

CONTEMPORARY JAPAN 
THE CULTURED PEARL, JEWEL OF JAPAN by 
Norine C. Reece. Published by Charles E. Tuttle Co., Tokyo 
and Vermont, 1938; pp. 107 with 47 illustrations (10 in (0100, 
1700 in Japan, $2.50 elsewhere. 
This well written book with its excellent illustrations tells all one 
could wish to know about the cultured pearl -- the prolonged and 
painstaking human efforts involved, the prodigious financial ,avestment 
necessary, the many and unrelenting destructive forces ever-present?all 
the factors that play upon the production of this jewel. 
The most perfect home of the pictada martensii, the pearl oyster, 
is lovely Ago Bay, which lies south of Nagoya, off southern I lonshu, in 
the Pacific Ocean. We read, "The beautiful skies, the trans] ocent blue 
water, and the lovely wooded hillsides all impart their beauty to the 
opalescent gems." The author tells us of the ama, the diver oF the pearl 
oyster industry, as she searches under-water for oysters and as s tie surfaces 
with a gasp, or "sea whistle" as it is called, in her struggle I or breath. 
Pictures show her in the white, long-sleeved, high-necked shirt and wrap-
around skirt which ties between the knees, and the towel turOan; all of 
which protect her from the sharks, the eels, and the rough, raq ky bottom 
of the ocean. 
The life-cycle of the pearl is well explained and diagr aned. In 
spring, the oyster, which has grown from spat in the past stx months, 
is seeded, usually with a piece of the special clam-shell fron the Mis-
sissippi Valley, and is attached to a raft either individually Ly a string 
or with other oysters in a wire basket. During the warm months, the 
oyster is cleaned several times; then, in winter, the usual time lot- harvest, 
a small pearl might be found, that is, if the changes in water tcmperature 
have not been too severe, or if the typhoons or tidal wavei have not 
been too destructive or if the dire "red tide" has not elim nated the 
necessary food and oxygen. 
The author, a familiar figure in the Ago Bay area, trils of the 
additional years of exposure needed to develop the larger and more 
highly-prized pearl. There is more financial investment, more solicitious 
care, the moving of rafts southward for a warmer winter and lorthward 
in spring, and more hopeful waiting. Only about 40% of r he pearls 
are marketable, she tells us, and only 5% to 10% are perfect gems. 
To evaluate the pearl, one must know about it, its growth in the 
oyster, its handling and sorting in the market, its perfectic a in pro-
portion to size, color and luster, its care as a "lifetime inves-ment and 
wonderful heirloom." Norine C. Reece, the author, has livea in Japan

"The very word 'pearl conjures up visions of soft, iridescent beauty, 
of exquisite lustrous gems, brought into being for the adornment of

as well as by the novice, she imparts with exactness and appreciation.

PAINTING, 6TH-14TH CENTURIES: A Pageant of 
Japanese Art, popular edition, edited by Ichitaro Kondo. 
Published by Charles E. Tuttle Co., Tokyo and Rutland Vt., 
U.S.A. pp. 167, Y700, $2.95 in U.S.A. 
A more expensive edition, of larger format, of volume one of the 
Pageant of Japanese Art was published three years ago, being followed 
by five other volumes; all of these provide newcomers and art lovers 
with an authoritative history covering the various fields of Japanese 
art. In this present edition, this delightful study of art has been made 
available at a lower price, making possible to more of those who are 
interested a firsthand look at the unusual characteristics of Japanese art. 
This book contains more than 150 text illustrations, of which 10 
are in color and 40 are plates in black-and-white. Although it may 
be said that, due to size restrictions in phototype reproduction, the 
richness of illustration falls short of one's wish; nevertheless they retain 
much of the intricate detail which we associate with Japanese art. In 
editing this volume, Ichitaro Kondo, a staff member of Tokyo National 
Museum, has succeeded in giving the reader an insight into the vast 
richness of art, as well as pointing out the oddities peculiar to the 
painting in Japan, such as materials, subject matter, and style. 
Dealing with painting from the pre-Buddhist period to the Kama-
kura period (AD. 552-1333), covering the Asuka, Nara and Heian 
periods, this book opens a gateway to the realm of Japanese art. 
Volumes II and HI, on painting from 14th to 19th centuries and 
on architecture and gardens, are now available. Three others, on 
sculpture, on ceramics, and on lacquer are in preparation.
