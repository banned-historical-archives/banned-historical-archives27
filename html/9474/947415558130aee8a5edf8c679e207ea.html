 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 Communist China:  Agriculture In 1970
 Introduction
 This memorandum surveys agricultural develop-
 ments in Communist China in 1970.  It describes
 the harvests of grain and industrial crops, ap-
 praises the importance of increased supplies of
 chemical fertilizer and farm equipment, and con-
 siders the effects of water conservation programs.
 It also deals with the issues of agricultural
 policy and agricultural technology.  Finally, the
 memorandum places the agricultural developments
 of  19 70  in  the  perspective  of  the  nekTly  announced
 Fourth Five-Year Plan for 1971-75.
 Chinese Claims
 1.  In general, 1970 was a favorable year for
 agriculture in Communist China (for areas of agri-
 cultural cultivation and for administrative divisions,
 see the two maps, inside back cover).  The regime
 reported that "total and per hectare grain output
 exceeded the previous records," that the output of
 most industrial crops, with the exception of cotton,
 increased, and that the number of draugi~t animals
 and pigs "increased considerably."  An analysis of
 these claims -- supplemented by independent informa-
 tion on weather, chemical fertilizer, and _oreign
 trade -- supports their general validity.
 Note:  This memorandum gas prepared by the Offiee
 of Economic Research.

 Grain
 2.  The output of grain, whic:h is overwhelmingly
 the most important pxoduct of Ch~i.na's agriculture,
 is estimated at 215 million to 220 million metric
 tons in 1970.  This represents ~~n increase of about
 15 million tons over 1969 and p~~rhapa 5 million tons
 above the previous peak of 210 million to 215 mil-
 lion tons reached in 1967.*  Production of grain in
 1964-70 is estimated in the acr~ompanying tabulation.

 3.  Both the early (spring) harvest and the
 late (autumn) harvest of grain were good but not
 outstanding.**  In genera:L the early harvest was
 mediocre in the northern areas of the country and
 good to outstanding in the south.  Conversely the
 late harvest was good in the north and only average
 i.n the south.  As a result the year's harvest of
 grain was above the 1969 level in all but a few
 provinces.  (For a disc~ission of provincial claims
 for grain production in 1970, see the Appendix.)
 4.  While the overall grain harvest was favorable
 in 1970, certain crops in various areas of China
 suffered damage.  In the fall of 1969 the sowing of
 winter wheat was delayed by drought in the northern
 and by waterlogging iri the southern part of the
 winter wheat belt.  As a consequence, the acreage
 plan for winter wheat was probably not fulfilled.

 s1c~zLZ~
 To help compensate for the shortfall in acreage,
 an additional one-half miJ.lion hectares of land
 was sown to wheat in southern areas where wheat
 is not normally an important crop.*  An unusually
 late, cool spring probably caused above-normal
 winter wheat kill in the north and delayed the
 sowing of early rice in the south.  Despite the de-
 lay, the acreage of early rice was enlarged sub-
 stantially, especially in Central China.  In Hunan
 and Hupeh Provinces, for example, the acreage re-
 portedly increased by 13~ and 30~, respeci:ively.
 The combination of the increased acreage of winter
 wheat, the late spring, and the enlarged acreage
 of early rice caused repercussions throughout the
 remainder of the year.  Although the crop ~f early
 rice was excellent, the peasants were hard pressed
 to harvest the early rice and transplant the crop
 of  late  rice  in  the summer  and to harvest  the  late
 rice and complete autumn sowing in the fall.
 5.  The only known major calamity occurred over
 the eastern one-third of Kwangtung Province where
 typhoons in September caused devastating floods,
 spoiling an otherwise promising crop of late rice.
 Reports from the province indicate that large areas
 of crops were washed out and that only one-third
 of the normal yield was expected in those fields
 where harvesting could be completed.
 6.  Even though weather conditions in 1970 were
 improved over 1969, they fell short of the excellent
 conditions t'~at prevailed in 1967.  The reason that
 grain output in 1970 exceeded the bumper 1967
 harvest vas the greater availability of industrial
 inputs in 1970 and, possibly, a somewhat larger
 acreage of grain crops.  Chemical fertilizer pro-
 vided more than 50$ (over 1.0 million tons) more
 crop nutrients in 1970 than in 1967.**  The avail-
 ability of other inputs -- pesticides, tractors,
 tools, water pumps -- was substantially greater

 than  in  196'1.   And,   for  the  first  time  since  1956,
 there was a concerted effort to reclaim marginal
 land for culti~~ation during the winter of 1969-70.
 At least a part of this land was sown with grain
 crops.  The area of multiple cropping was also
 increased in 1970, particularly in Central China.
 7.  There was also some substitution of grain
 for industrial crops in 1970.  Peasants in Fukien
 Frovince, for example, were prohibited from sowing
 industrial crops without special permission.  The
 peasants in Chengte County -- primarily a cotton
 growing region in Kiangsi Province -- were strongly
 criticized for thinking that growing cotton was
 more important than growing rice.  After attendance
 at Mao Tse-tung Thought study classes, all peasant
 families "learned the importance of farming for the
 sake of world revolution" and increased the output
 of early rice.  Kwangtung Province reported that
 more land was sown to dry land grain crops than in
 previous years.  Since most dry fields are normally
 sown to industrial crops, the increase of dry land
 grain crops was at least in part at the expense of
 industrial crops.
 Industrial Crops and Soybeans
 8.  With the exception of cotton, the output of
 industrial crops improved in 1970.  Included among
 the commodities for which gains were claimed were
 oilseeds, sugar, tobacco, tea, fruits, and silk
 cocoons.  Although grains were substituted nor
 industrial crops in some areas, the overall acreage
 of industrial crops could have increased in 1970
 because of the sowing of the crops on newly reclaimed
 land.  Reports have indicated that much reclaimed
 land is not tillable in the conventional sense but
 rather consists of the sowing of a few plants on
 sloping land or the planting of crops in remote
 areas.  Sugar crops, fibers, and oilseeds in
 particular have reportedly benefited from this
 practice.
 Cotton
 9.  Cotton acreage in 1970 was about the same
 as in 1969.  None of the major cotton growing pro-
 vinces reported an increase in cotton acreage, and

 srcliLZ~
 only one province -- ICiangsu -- claimed that the
 state acreage plan had been overfulfilled.  On the
 other hand, more fertilizer was reportedly allocated
 to cotton than in past years.  Output was claimed
 to have increased by from 10~ to 20$ in three im-
 portant producing provinces -- Shantung, Henan, and
 Hopeh -- but these increases were offset by the
 effects of a wet spring, unusually heavy infesta-
 tions of insects and plant disease, and waterlogging
 that plagued the crop in other major cotton growing
 areas.  On balance, output of cotton seemed little
 changed from 1969.
 Soybeans
 10.  For a number of years the mass media have
 said little on the cultivation of soybeans.  His-
 torically, soybeans have been a major export crop
 and also a staple foodstuff in many regions of China.
 Following the calamity years of 1959-61, soybeans,
 which have a high value per ton but are a low
 yielding crop, were replaced by higher yielding
 grain crops in many areas.  The recent references
 to soybeans in the official press suggest that
 this crop may be making a comeback.  Although the
 acreage of soybeans declined in Heilungkiang
 Province in 1970, the yield and output were re-
 portedly up by 40~ and 33$, respectively.  In
 neighboring Kirin Province, an enlarged acreage
 of soybeans was said to be accompanied by a 30~ in-
 crease in yield and by a 50~ increase in output.
 Claims from these two key soybean provinces, while
 possibly exaggerated, may attest to a substantial.
 increase in soybean production in 1970.
 Sugar Crops
 11.  Increases in the output of sugar in 1970
 apparently were moderate despite a substantial
 increase in the acreage of the sugar crop.  The
 acreage of cane in Kwangtung Province, which accounts
 for over 40$ of China's acreage of cane, reportedly
 increased 1-.y 17~ in 1970 and reached an alltime
 high.  Similarly, the acreage of cane was claimed
 to have increased by 20$ in Fukien Province and
 was almost doubled in Kwangsi Province.  Tn Heilung-
 kiang Province, China's major grower of sugar beet,
 the acreage cvas increased by almost 8$.  However,
 only Fukien, which reported that sugar production
 increased by 50$, has claimed a large increase in
 output.

 Current Agricultural Pclicy
 12.  The record harvest in 1970 represents a
 significant payoff from the regime's "agriculture
 firs~;~'  policies*  adopted beginni:lg  in  1962.      Such
 measures as (a) increased investment in industries
 producing inputs for agriculture, (b) regular im-
 ports  of  chemical  fertilizers,  and  (c)  the con-
 centration of these inputs on the mast productive
 farmland have enabled the Chinese to increase grain
 production at a rate commensurate with the growth
 in population.  Agricultural productivity has also
 been enhanced by the avoidance of policies further
 restricting peasant incentives.  In particular the
 regime abandoned measures adopted during the Leap
 Forward restricting private enterprise and now
 permits individual initiative in the cultivation
 of private plots and actually encourages the private
 raising of hogs and poultry.
 Inputs
 13.  After 1962 the switch in agricultural policy
 brought rapid increases ir. the electric power,
 conventional and garden-type tractors, agricultural
 tools and equipment, agricultural chemicals, and
 chemical fertilizer supplied to agriculture.  While
 the volume of many of these non-farm produced in-
 puts cannot be quantified with precision, the
 Chinese peasant in 1970 was clearly benefiting from
 record levels of such inputs, as described in the
 following paragraphs.
 Chemical Fertilizer
 14.  The use of chemical fertilizer reached an
 alltime high in 1970 and was the single most im-
 portant factor in the increase in the output of
 grain.  As shown in Table 1, over 3 million tons
 of chemical nutrients was available for agriculture
 *  The term agriculture first is used in this
 memorandum to designate those measures rahi ch were
 directed to the rapid restoration of a minimum food
 supply in the make of the Leap For~ard disaster;
 concurrently, the regime maintained the priority of
 a narrora range of industrial activity including she
 expansion of the petroleum industry and the develop-
 ment of nuctear-armed missiles.

 in 1970, or about 25~ more than was available in
 1969.  Imports contributed somewhat more Shan
 domestic production to the increased tonnage of
 nutrients.
 15.  Imported fertilizers are generally of
 higher quality than domestic fertilizers.  In
 recent years the regime has relied almost ex-
 clusively on small and medium-sized plants to in-
 crease domestic output of chemical fertilizers.

 to grain production has been achieved by concen-
 trating the limited quantity of high-quality chemical
 fertilizer and other non-farm produced inputs on
 stable high-yield fields.  The continued expansion
 of such areas will have to be supported by increased
 in-ports of chemical fertilizer unless substantial
 investment is made to expand the number and capacity
 of large plants to produce high-quality fertilizers.
 Mechanization
 16.  The rapid growth in the use of electricity
 and petroleum products to power agricultural imple-
 ments continued in 1970.  For example, the capacity
 of electric pumps supplied agriculture during 1970
 was reportedly one-sixth of the tota.L increase
 attained during the period 1949-69.  While st .t.l
 small in absolute teams, production of tractor. has
 more than doubled since 1962 and new garden-type
 models have been developed for use in small fields
 and hilly terrain.  Mechanical power has been applied
 to a variety of functions ranging from the plowing
 and cultivation of fields to the threshing and win-
 nowing of grain.  Many types of farm implements
 manufactured in China are obsolete by Western stand-
 ards and only a small number of production teams
 can be supplied from current production.  However,
 those production teams fortunate enough to be in
 possession of even simple machines are able to
 improve the timeliness of many field operations and
 reduce the amount of loss during the harvesting and
 processing of grain.
 Water Conservation
 17.  Thy intensity of the annual water conserva-
 tion campaign in 1970 was probably exceeded only by
 that during the Leap Forward in 1958-59.  However,
 in contrast with the Leap Forward when huge masses
 of peasants were mobilized for overly ambitious
 projects at the expense of regular farm output, new
 construction in 1970 was primarily of the small
 farmstead variety and did not seriously interfere
 with the care of crops.  National data are not
 available to show the size of the area that may have
 benefited from such construction.  Provincial claims
 have been quite modest considering the magnitude of
 the program.  For example, Hupeh Province reported:

 Approved For Release 2002/05/07 SIC,IAC-~ZD~P~T00875R001600040046-7
 The total amount of earth and stone
 work completed was 78~ up on that of
 the scheduled plan and was over double
 that of 1969 and 20~ over that of
 1958, the year of the "Great Leap
 Forward.''  The total area of land
 guaranteeing good hart?ests irrespec-
 tive of wrought or floods has ueen
 expanded by 67,000 hectares.
 By contrast, this Same province claimed that over
 900,000 hectares were brought under irrigation as
 the result of the water conservancy effort of 1958.
 18.  Under normal weather conditions most small
 water conservation projects are probably an asset
 in areas where traditional agriculture is practiced.
 However, their effectiveness for. modern agriculture
 or during extremes in the weather is restricted.
 Th?se latter conditions call for larger projects
 which can provide a dependable system for storing
 large quantities of water.  The introduction of
 pumps alone will displace labor and will permit
 the more timely movement of water in peak seasons;
 but pumps by themselves will not offset the effects
 of extended drought or permit the application of
 high-yield agricultural techniques.
 19.  The sinking of wells is a major potential
 source of water in China.  The past experience of
 Honaii, Hopeh, and Liaoning Provinces -- which have
 been among the leaders in the sinking of new
 wells -- suggests this method has its limitations
 since aii increase in the number of wells often
 leads to depletion of underground water supplies.
 20.  tdo large capital intensive water conserva-
 tion projects have been initiated by the state since
 the completion in the early 1960s of the ill-fated
 Sanmen Gorge Reservoir in Honan Province.  Huge
 amounts of silt have been building up in this
 reservoir, clogging the generator intakes and dim-
 ming the prospects for large-scale production of
 electric power.  ,Instead of this showpiece type of
 project, the regime has been sponsoring large
 drainage projects, uaually in response to serious

 Approved For Release 2002/05/~~~~i~,~   P85T00875R001600040046-7
 flooding or waterlogging.  The biggest of these
 projects requires the mobilization of tens of
 thousands of workers.  Foremost among the projects
 completed or nearing completion in 1970 were the
 Hunwei River Project in Shantung Province; the
 HeiJ.ungkang  avid  the  Taching Projects  in Hopeh
 Province  to  improve  the drainage  of  the  f~ai River
 Valley in Hopeh Province (in the North China Plain);
 the To-Hsinpien Project in Honan, Anhwei, and Kiang-
 su Provinces to provide dram:age in the Huai River
 Valley (in the southern portion of the North China
 Plain); and the Chiangshan River Project in Hopeh
 Pr~avince (along the middle reaches of the Yangtze
 River).  Much of this construction is in the form
 of improvements to existing facilities rather than
 the building of new projects.
 21.  As early as 1954 the Communists had claimed
 that flooding had been brought under control in
 the Hai anti Huai River Valleys.  However, extensive
 flooding and waterlogging in 1963 and again in 1964
 proved these facilities to be inadequate; many be-
 came clogged with silt.  A mammoth campaign to
 correct these deficiencies and to rejuvenate exist-
 ing facilities in these two basins was begun almost
 immediately and was only completed in 1969-70.  But
 even now it is uncertain whether the threat of
 flood has been averted.  For example, the official
 New China News Agency reported on 24 November 1970,
 "The people of Hopeh Province -- after seven years
 of  hard efforts  have basicaZZz~  checked  flofld and
 waterlogging in most of the Hai River Basin"
 (italics supplied).  The capaci~y to resist calamitie s
 has been improved, it is claimed, on about 40~ of
 the farmland in the province.  This is a region
 plagued by botri flood and drought, and it remains
 to be seen whether the new drainage projects can
 cope with extremes in precipitation similar to
 those that occurred in 1963-64.  Certainly they will
 contribute to agricultural output under reasonably
 normal conditions.
 Technology
 22.  The gains in agricultural output since 1962
 rest on increases in material inputs and the appli-
 cation of known water conservation methods.  The
 Chinese have not achieved the technological break-
 through necessary to realize the high yields that

 arr_ ponr~ible with modorn agriculture]. techniques.
 In 1956 the Twelva-Year Plan for Agricultural
 Uravelol~mant  or~tablishod a number of  goals  that were
 to be accomplished by 1967.  however, only a hand-
 fu1 oi' production teams and hsien had fulfilled
 ther~r.  tarc~etn  in  1970,  a'. ]  according to the current
 timetable an additional tr-ree to five years will be
 rec}ui.red  Cor  most  areas  to complete  the plan.     The
 failure to meet thosa ambitious, but not totally
 unrealir3tic, goals is duo primarily to a lag in
 technology.  Rather than seek the large gains that
 mic}ht  rr_r~ulC  from  long-term basic  research,  the
 regime }gas chosen to use its small corps of pro-
 f'ee~r~ton.~1  agricultural  scientists  to secure  immediate
 gains i.n agricultural output.  During the Cultural
 Itcvc,~.l.ution  (1966-69) ,  the  agricultural  scientists
 suffered alorg with the rest of the "scientific
 establishment."  Perhaps the most damaging legacy
 of the Cultural Revolution will prove to be the
 termination of long-term genetic research aimed at
 developing superior seed varieties.  While a gradual
 broadening of agricultural technology has occurred
 in the countryside, the research base has remained
 weak and no short-term technological breakthrough
 is likely.
 Intensive  Use of Labor
 23.  The regime has supplemented the "agriculture
 first" policies with campaigns to utilize peasant
 labor to build up agricultural capital.  The mobili-
 zation of peasant labor for this purpose regained
 official favor with the introduction of the "Learn
 from Tachai" campaign in 1965.*  The movement has
 subsequently gainer momentum, especially in the
 last two years.  During the winter of 1969-70 and
 again during the slack periods in the summer and
 fall of 1970, millions of peasants were set to work
 collecting compost, building simple water conserva-
 tion projects, reclaiming marginal land for agri-
 culture, and terracing fields.  Some areas again
 "  This ca,npaign centers on the emulation of the
 model Tachai production brigade in Shansi Province
 ~hioh  is  supposed  to  have  overcome  its  unfavorable
 endo~ment of natural resources by "self reliance,"
 sheer human effort, and the application of the
 "thoughts of Mao Tae-tung."  This spirit is pre-
 scribed  noun  for  agriculture  of  the  tuhoZe  country.

 expended too much labor on those pursuits at the
 expense of more important tasks.  It was reported
 in Hupeh Province, for example, that "too many
 laborers were allotted to water conservation projects,
 double task work [autumn harvesting and sowing of
 winter crops] was adversely affected."  While similar
 reports have been received from other areas, these
 appear to be tr.e exception rather than the rule.  In
 short, the more intensive use of agricultural labor
 in 1970 did not approach the Leap Forward madness
 and seems to have been a rational way to build up
 the capacity of the agricultural sector. through the
 use of a plentiful factor of pr~uuction.
 24.  Rusticated students and redundant workers
 continued to stream from urban to rural areas iii
 1970.  This labor has been of indirect assistance
 to agriculture through contributions in the field
 of medicine, education, and agricultural support
 industries.  Direct benefits have been small.  The
 displaced urbanities -- who number 20 million can
 one count -- have found the Spartan living standards
 of the peasant di ficult to accept.  They have had
 even greater difi culty accepting the dull,
 monotonous, and dirty lot of the field hand.  Peasants
 resent their new comrades because they represent
 more mouths to share in the harvest and because they
 display an obvious lack of enthusiasm for farm work.
 Organizational Aspects
 25.  Although there was talk during the Cultural
 Revolution of resurrecting the commune as the locus
 of authority in agricultural matters, no basic
 organizational change has taken place in the rural
 areas since the collapse ~f the Leap Forward.  The
 three-tier structure of commune, production brigade,
 and production team, with the team as the basic
 managerial unit, continued unchanged in 1970.  The
 general denigration of authority, particularly
 party authority, during the Cultural Revolution
 (1966-69) may have strengthened the ability of the
 teams to obtain adjustments in the demands of the
 state favorable to their own interests.  The
 authority and responsibility for making economic
 decisions concerning purchases of inputs, the
 application of inputs to specific crops, and the
 distribution of income after the harvest -- although

 limited by state quotas for production and procurc-
 ment -- remain with the production team, that: icy,
 those most directly affcctcd by succr.nn or failure
 in agricultural work.  'l'akes  toclethcr. with  the con-
 tinued tolerance by the authorities of: private
 plots and small-scale privata markeL?incJ, this
 limited urea fez decision-making appears to be a
 positive factor in China's rercnt progr.enr~ in
 agricultural production.
 Food Consumption
 26.  Consumption of. all foods durincJ 1909-70
 remained at about 2,000 calories daily per. capita,
 a level that enables the Chinesr. to cat reasonably
 well.  Complaints of food shortages came from
 certain areas where vrops suffered from ins~ectn and/or
 unfavorable weather.
 27.  Individual rations of cereal. grains in 1970
 appear to have increased sli3htly over. the previous
 year, presumably a reflection of bigger crops.  This
 incre~lse; however, was more than offset by thr. re-
 ported decline in the availability of potatoes.
 The increased n-vailabi.lity of fruits, eggs, meat,
 and  vegetables  c-ther  than  potatoes,  produced
 primarily  on  thr.  private  plots ,  enabled  the  i>c~pulacc
 to continue the gradual improvement in quatiCy of
 diet.
