 SPREADING AND INTENSIFYING THE POLITICAL EDUCATION DRIVE IN CHINA
 This editorial of the Jen-min Chiao-yu, an official publication
 of the Central People's government, reports that the political educa-
 tion drive of the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement is to be achieved
 in two phases.  During the first phase, the aim is to lead the stu-
 dents to accept the ideas of the joint declaration of all democratic
 parties and to use these ideas as their guiding principles in studies
 and actions.  Durin? the second phase, what has been achieved during
 the first phase  a to be consolidated and strengthened.
 The writer admits that although the basic economic, political,
 and ideological foundation of the people's patriotism has been es-
 tablished, the youth of China have not been able to grasp fully the
 changes which took place since the liberation, and as a result, they
 have not been able to achieve the highest type of patriotism found
 in the S(,viet Union.
 The ultimate goal of the political education drive is said to
 be to eliminate all past evil influences, especially those of US
 imperialism; and to develop youth to become conscious patriots and
 noble internationalists.
 Although the political education drive of the Resist America, Aid Korea
 Movement  remains to be fully extended to schools all over the country, this
 drive has reached an advanced stage in some areas, especially in Peiping.  The
 experience in Peiping shows that the movement war. first promoted in schools,
 where it was infused with Political thought education at each stage.  Thus,
 over a 2-week period, high  schools and colleges in Peiping brought the move-
 ment to its climax.
 Beginning 5 November, each school conducted an intensive study of current
 affairs laid the groundwork for a propaganda drive, and few student propaganda
 teama began to appear on the streets.  On 19 November, numerous propaganda teams
 consisting of tens of thousands of students simultaneously launched a dramatic

 propaganda and educational drive in Peiping and its suburbs. The Resist America,
 Aid Korea Movement is basically a political and educational movement.  It starter
 in the schools where the .tudents first conducted their own study and then we at
 out to teach the masses.
 After this experience they studied more seriously to further the propaganda
 work. The materials on current affairs included Premier Chou En-lei's report to
 the people on the eve of the national holiday, the joint declaration of all dem-
 ocratic parties, editorials from the Jen-min Jih-peu, etc.  Study was mostly
 carried out in groups.  Various study methods were used, such as discussions
 of cur.snt affairs, speeches by students who had joined the armed: services, in-
 dignation meetings, speech contests, essay contests, student rebolutions, mil-.
 itary drill, evening parties, drama presentations, cartoons, exhibits, group
 editing of propaganda material, etc.  These group studies and activities, in
 addition to the propaganda drives in cities, suburbs, factories, and rural areas,
 constituted the essence of Peiping's patriotic movement in which college stu-
 dents participated.
 The primary schools also showed enthusiastic response to such a movement.
 Primary school teachers began to study current affairs) supplying news reports,
 to students in senior classes, and holding parent-teacher meetings in which
 teachers emphatically denounced and interpreted rumors, and told stories of the
 Korean people's resistance against the US.  The students sang songs, staged
 patriotic dramas, and provided other entertainment.
 Thus, in the first phase of the Resist Americo., Aid Korea Movement, the
 :.tudents in Peiping have shown a high degree of patriotism.  In fact, both stu-
 dents and teachers are carrying on the glorious and revolutionary tradition.
 From an educational viewpoint, they have attained the ideal of incorporating
 the nation's supreme policy in the field of education.  The results of the first
 phase in the campaign to resist the US and aid Korea have thus been very gratifying.
 However, we have completed only the first phase from the viewpoint of  hat
 the movement as a procesr of political education in schools requires of us. In
 schools of high school level and above, we must not be satisfied merely with
 introducing general instruction on current affairs.  We must offer a thorough
 and systematic political education.  Among the :?,,uth we must foster patriotic
 feelings based on firm convictions and iron will.  Schools must :.ot only teach
 current affairs, but must also carry out political indoctrination.
 We must not be content with mere target drives and extracurricular activ-
 ities, which, if pursued to excess, tend to affect the course of normal study.
 Instead, we must pursue our study calmly and steadily to meet the needs of our
 Fatherland.  Group study is not sufficient in itself.  Teachers must prepare
 themselves 'co play a'leading part in the entire thought-oiucacion program.  The
 political education drive in schools to resist the US and aid Korea must be a
 long-term program with definite objectives, and with adequate methods of
 thought indoctrination
 Teachers in Peiping are aware of the conditions we have described in the
 preceding paragraph.  Some of them are very much co:.cerned that their standard
 of political training may not be sufficient to meet the requirements of teach-
 ing the yorth.  They feel that the holding of routine meetings, again and again,
 has not only bored the students but h:s led them to lose their enthusiasm.  They
 think that we are badly in need of a more definite approach to implement polit-
 ical indoctrination.                                                       Some primary and high school teachers have begun volun-
 tarily to study new plans and teaching methods for various courses of instruc-
 tion as well as to improve themselves by self-study.  They believe that our ed-
 ucational program must be more attractive and richer in contents.  That is
 absolutely the right attitude.

 In the hope that the         yet been fully developed throughout the country.
 present political education drive of the Resist America,
 Aid Korea Movement will be implemented properly and under a definite pattern,
 we make the following comments:
 What is the aim of the present political education drive in the schools?
 It is to equip the youth with a new spirit of patriotism and internationalism
 in the glorious struggle to resist the US and aid Korea.  Such patriotism will
 resolve into mighty force that will crush the enemy, overcome all obstacles,
 strengthen the fruits of revolution, and preserve peace in the world.
 We must teach the youth to recognize that the present struggle is a patri-
 otic movement to protect our country; a righteous struggle of mankind against
 the imperialists; and a glorious struggle of the Chinese r  pls.  We must im-
 press them that it is a privilege of the youth of this period to participate
 in such a movement.  Those who shun this responsibility or are unwilling to let
 themselves be edified by participating in it, are cowards.  Education which does
 not conform with this struggle is no longer a new people's democratic education.
 The d1:y of the student is primarily to pursue studies.  By providing all
 the necessary conditions for learning, the school should teach the new genera-
 tion the new spirit of the people, to help ther i;.derstand fully the meaning of
 the struggle.  It should also be responsible for answering questions, such as
 how to carry on the struggle, where lies the future of the struggle, etc.  Every
 youth should be taught to become a ronscious patriot and a noble international-
 1st; he must be taught that he is the master of his. own destiny.  The genuine
 understanding, great insight, and a fearless spirit of self-sacrifice of every
 youth must be developed.  These are the qualities that school education should
 foster in the younger generation.
 This is our goal.  But it must not remain a mere moral abstraction.  We
 arc dealing with people, with the youth in the schools.  They possess the knowl-
 edge of the Chinese Revolution and the traditional revolutionary heritage of
 Chinese students; but, because of their sociological background and the limited
 amount of time they have been able to spend for reindoctrination, they have not
 completely eradicated the bad influences and tradition of the old society which
 act as a disruptive force among the youth.
 Among these influences, American imperialistic thinking is still the most
 dangerous.  Although the basic economic, political, and sociological foundations
 of the people's patriotism have been established, our youth has not been able to
 grasp fully all the changes which have taken place in the year that has elapsed
 since the basic victory of the Chinese Revolution.  Because of this, they have
 not been able, like the youth in the schools of the USSR, to achieve the highest
 type of patriotism.  This factor disti guishes the new feature of our people's
 democratic education from that of a socialist state.
 Failing to understand these realities confronting the youth of China, one
 is apt to set up too high an objective $- youth education and may become impa-
 tient with the slow progress.  On the other hand, any exaggeration of these re-
 alities will result in our neglecting the possibility of developer  a new char-
 acter in our youth under the new order.
 Our political education takes full cognizance of the realities facing youth
 today; it aims to develop positive qualities while overcoming disruptive factors.
 It neither exaggerates one side, nor underestimates the other.

 CONFIDEPITIAL    CCN     IENTi
 Political education must be conducted to contribute to the Resist America,
 Aid Korea Movement, to protect our fatherland, and to give other concrete mani-
 festations of the struggle.  It must fuse patriotism and internationalism into
 a common spirit, and inject that spirit into the struggle participated in by
 millions of people.  Out of such a struggle there will certainly emerge numerous
 heroic men who partake of this spirit of patriotism and internationalism.  The
 many heart-thrilling and exciting events and battles confronting our youth will
 inspire them to understanu more easily the relationship between the group and
 the individual and the meaning of the living things surrounding them, thus fos-
 tering s new feeling, a new way of looking at things, and a new way of thinking.
 Consequently, our youth will develop a new attitude toward the state and will
 automatically consider the affairs of the state as their own.  What is more,
 they will then comprehend those political principles and theories of social
 development which are hard to understand.
 It is clear that political education on the college level should be pushed
 to a more advanced stage.  To further our understanding of the Resist America,
 Aid Korea Movement, we must study the joint declaration of all democratic par-
 ties, the trends of international events, partiotism, internationalism, etc.,
 as well as our own behavior within the framework of the universal theories of
 Marx and Engels, the theories of Mao Tse-tung which are particularly adapted
 to the realities of the Chi'.ese Revolution, and the general theoretical struc-
 ture of strategy and tactics.  In colleges and universities, we must conduct
 political education with an emphasis on resisting US imperialism and aiding
 Korea.  However, we must not relax the teaching of social sciences and the
 theories of Mao Tse-tung.  We must strengthen the study of revolutionary theory.
 We must use concrete historical events to verify scientific theory, and in turn
 use this theory as our guide in helping us to understand complicated matters
 and events.
 Primary school teachers should carefully instill these new qualities in
 the younger generation.  They should help the children understand the new spirit
 and those new things that are within their comprehension.  They should let them
 know whit cause their fatherland is following, what their parents, uncles, broth-
 ers, and sisters are doing, why what they are doing is right, etc.  They should
 promote collective activity among the children so that the spirit of patriotism
 and internationalism may take root in them.  This is what we expect of the no-
 ]iticnl education in schools to resist US imperialism and aiding Korea.
 It is obvious that the objectives of this political education in the schools
 cannot be achieved by simple or crude methods.  We must seek a suitable approach
 to enlarge the field of political education. Because educational workers are
 often hampered by their own limited political understanding, it is not easy to
 infuse the new spirit Into all courses of instruction and thus to integrate po-
 l.tic-.il education with the educational system as a whole.  Despite this difficulty,
 we must work in that direction.  The political education program definitely can-
 not and should not be limited to ideological and political courses in colleges
 and universities.  Therefore, every teacher and educational worker must assume
 individual responsibility for achieving thin same goal.  Political education
 in schools should be an integrated system of activity which is coordinated with
 general education as a whole under a definite plan.
 What is to be included in this intergrated system of political education?
 School life should be managed in such a way that the school is a collective en-
 tity, not only in form but in spirit.  The school should be a collective organ-
 ization designed for a life of struggle to resist US imperialism and aid Korea
 rather than an organization for normal life.  Thus it is very important to
 foster self-discipline, organize study in an orderly manner, promote feelings
 of friendship, live in an earnest way, create model conduct, and pursue physical
 and military training.

 We should supply the students with all available ooks,ll magazines, and ireefferences
 c
 concerning the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement.  We should recommend that stu-
 dents read the translated Soviet literature written in the period of her defen-
 sive war.  We should also recommend Chinese military literature, including books
 about the war against japan, the War of Liberation, biographies of revolutionary
 leaders, war heroes, and hero workers, ctc.  In cities that have motion-picture
 theaters, we should take the students to see pictures which have inspirational
 value, especially Soviet and Chinese films dealing with the Revolution.  In
 addition, we should make proper use of plays and broadcasts as means of education.
 We should make arrangements for extracurricular activities.  Some schools
 have discovered that activities, such as maintaining constant contact with fao.
 tory workers and parents, contacts among schools of all levels for mutual help,
 etc. are very fruitful.  They are all indispensable means of political education.
 We shall now turn to a brief discussion of methods of thought indoctrination.
 The fundamental approach to this problem of indoctrination is by way of persua-
 sion and inducement.  With truth we persuade people, and with deeds we influence
 people's feelings, actions, ideology, and behavior.  In the field of education
 two oil sayings are always true:  "persuade people by logic" and "teach others
 by setting an example."  Besides, we should encourage all enthusiastic activ-
 ities, give public hono- to progressive elements, and eliminate dissenting ones.
 Such methods must be strictly followed even in time of war.  Otherwise, bad con-
 sequences will result in the field of thought education.
 It is obvious that teachers exert a decisive influence in the process of
 thought indoctrination.  We urge, teachers to improve their political ideology
 by intensive study because it is the only way to develop political education in
 schools to resist US imperialism and aid Korea.  Necessary assistance ehouli. be
 given to teachers for such purposes by government educational organizations.
 The goal of our political education to resist US imperialism and aid Korea,
 at present, is to bring the first phase to a successful conclusion throughout
 the country.  We should enlist the thinking of students to make them accept the
 stand and viewpoint of the joint declaration and get them to use these as their
 guiding principles in studies and in actions.  When the movement enters its
 second phase, ve must consolidate what has been achieved in the first phase and
 strengthen the students' patriotic feelings as a preparatory step in the pro-
 tracted struggle of thought indoctrination.  There can be no movement without
 a special emphasis on each phase.
 We urge all students, of high school level and above, to be more cognizant
 of national defense, and to cherish the idea of struggling for the creation of
 a strong national defense.  Willingness to accept such a glorious idea will serve
 as a yardstick of the students' patriotism, because such an attitude distinguishes
 real patriots from unreal ones,   We must praise this idea.  ode must publicly
 honor those alert youths who have answered the call of their fatherland to take
 part in tLe defensive reconstruction.  We must spread our youtL's enthusiasm for
 sharing in the nation's reconstruction for defense.
