						[Text]    	Beijing--Today  is  the  f ourth  anniversary  of  Mao's  death.    	We
				     	have  not  managed  to  discover  any  signs  of  public  commemoration.    	Com-
						petent  off icials  have  given  us  to  understand  that  no  official  events
	  	_			   	were  planned.    	The  National  People's  Congreas  will  meet  today  in  a
						session  closed  to  the  pub'lic,  but  it  seems  that  not  even  at  this  session
				     	will  there  be  any  commemorative  orations.    	This  does  not  mean  that  the
						great  hiatorical  leader  ia  not  being  mentioned  within  the  gigantic  and,
						for  the  first  time,   	lively  people's  congress.    	Mao  is  ofeen  invoked
				     	while  discussing  the  amb itious  reform  of  the  system.    	However,   	the
	  	'			    	reformist  plans  stem  rather  than  the  "great  helmsma.n's"  errors  than
	 	-			    	from  his  merits.    	The  relationship  between  the  best  and  worst  of  Mao						_
						is  still  being  defined,   	but  the  reform  being  launched  at  present  cer-
						tainly  cannot   	go  down  in  history  as  an  elaboration  of  Maoism,   	even  if
						it  fails  to  earn  the  definition  of  anti-Maoist.
						On  Sunday,  when  G`hai~an  Hua  Guofeng  announced  formally  the  most  signi-   	~			     	_
						ficanC  act  of  the  reform  (his  resignation  from  the  premiership  and
						the  proposal  to  transfer  it  to  ~han  Ziyang,   	so  as  to  separate  party
						from  government  roles),   	I  was  talking  in  the  same  great  hall  of  the
						people  with  o ne  of  the  three  most  prominent  protagonists  of  the  great
						post-Mao  swing.    	I  was  received  by  CCP  Vice  Chairman  Li  Xiannian  for
						an  interview  which  we  will  publish  in  a  few  days !   	time .    	Explaining
						to  me  what  was  going  on  in  the  hall,   	the  representative  of  both  the  old
						guard  and  the  new  course  involved  experiences  with  Mao:    	"At  the  time
	  	-			    	of  the  Cultural  Revolution  Mao  refused  to  heed  other  people's  opinions				   	_
						and  acted  as  a  patriarch.    	All  power  was   	concentrated  in  Chairman  Mao's
	 	_			    	hands.    	Naving  learned  the  lessons  of  history,  we  now  want  to  ensure
						that  this  will  not  happen  again,   	to  prevent  power  from  being  concentrated
						in  the  hands  of  a  single  person!    	We  are,   	therefore,  adopting  a  system
						that  separates  party  and  government  powers.    	We  want  the  party  to  examine
						and   	formu3.ate  political   	guidelines  and  to  leave  administrative  matters
						to  the  government."    	He  explained  why  he  too  is  leaving  his  post  as
						deputy  premier:    	"A  man  with  many  posts  has  much  power,  but  how  much
						capacity  can  he  have  for  responsible  work?    	This  is  how  bureaucracy
	  	_			    	originates."										 	~

				 	I.n  accordance  with  the  best  parliamentary  rules,   	the  new  prime  minister,
				 	Zhao  Ziyang,   	has  set  aside  3  days  befure  presenting  his  new  government
				 	list  to  the  people's  congress.    	We  already  know  the  names  of   	the  seven					 	-
				 	vice  premiers  due  to  leave  their  posts,   	and  we  know  that   	one  minister,
				 	the  per.roleum  industry  minister,   	is  to  be  replaced  for  serious  short-
				 	cominga  in  his  work.    	It  is  expected  that  the  seven  vice  premiers  will
				 	be  replaced  by  only  three  new  ones,   	including  the  present  foreign
				 	minister,   	Huang  Hua,   	and  the  new  national  defense  minister  (it  is  not
				 	yet  clear  whether  it  will  be  Yang,   	chief  of  staff,   	or   	[Chiang],   	currently
				 	deputy  chief  of  staff,   	replacing  the  old  marshal  [Siyang  Chien].
				 	Soma  interest  surrounds  whether  or  not  the  minister  of  inetallurgical					    	-
				 	industry  will  be  replaced,   	inasmuch  as  the  sudden  avalanche  of  criticisms
				 	of  the  government  from  the  deputies  has   	fallen  largely  on  his  shoulders
				 	(disproportionate  investments,   	excessive  bureaucratization  with  20  deputy
				 	ministers--and  when  he  tried  to  ~ustify  himself  by   	invoking   	the
	 	-				difficulties  left  by  the  Cultural  Revolution,  he  received  the  following
	 	"				rebuttal   	from  a  deputy:    	"The  time  has  come  to  stop  blaming  the   	'gang  of
				 	four`   	for  everything).
				 	Be  that  as  it  may,  whatever  list  Zhao  presents  on  Wednesday  evening  and
				 	whatever  happens  to  all  these  names,   	so  diff icult   	to  decipher  phonetically				 	-
				 	and  politicall,   	it  is  far  from  embracing  the  entire  extent  of  the  reform.
				  	Its  economic  aspects  were  devised  by  Zhao  himself.    	He  does  not  conceal
				  	the  fact   	that  he  de'veloped  his  ideas  during  visits  Co  Europe.    	First  he
				 	carricd  out  a  number  of  experiments  in  the  provin~e  where  he  was  party
				 	secretary,   	Sichuan--a  province  oniy  in  name,   	since  it  has  100  million
	 	_				inhab itants.    	The  encouraging  results  brought  him  to  Bei~ing,   	as  vice
				  	premier  reaponsible  for  the  economic  sy~tem.    	And  so  we  come  to   	the
				  	present  reform--autonomy  f or   	the  enterprises,  most  of   	the  profits  to
				 	be  placed  at  their  disposal,   	production  partly  determined  by  the
				  	state  plan  and  partly  freely  contracted  on  the  market.    	An  economy  which
				  	regulates  itself  according  to  profits  and  market  rules  will  either
				  	eventually  bring  down  the  so-called  state  superstructure  or  be  itself					  	-
				  	brought  down  by  it.    	In  his  report  to  the  deputies  Hua  Guofeng  explained
		~				the  nat~ire  of  the  problem  exactly:    	"We  must  defeut  bureaucracy  and
	 	.				dismiss  officials  who  are  committing  errors  caused  by  bureaucracy.					     	'
				  	Only  by  eliminating  bureaucracy  can  socialism  become  respectable,   	in
				  	China  at  least."
	 	_				With  this  same  approach  Hua  tackled  two  cen*_ral  and  in  many  rPSpects
	 	-				unresolved  problems  of  socialism:    	the  separation  of  state  and  party
				  	and  the  shifting  of  decision-making  power  from  administrative  centers
	  	-			 	to  production  enterprises.    	As  a  first  step  there  are  plans  for  the
				  	aeparation  of  functions  starting  from  the  center,   	Beijing,   	through  the
				  	provin~es  and  districts  and  reaching  to  the  people's  communes  and						  	-
				  	enr.erprises.    	Hither~o  the  party  secretary  was  everywhere  the  absolute
				  	boss   	at  all  levels.    	In  the  ma~or  industrial  center  of  Tachin  we  met
				  	an  official  who  was  at   	the  same  time  party  leader,  mayor,  manager  of

					    	China  hus  r.o  laws.    	The  entire  constitution,   	of  Maoist  stamp,   	has   	to  be
					    	amended,   	and  a  co~nission  has  been  set  up  to  do   	this,  headed  by  the
					    	chairman  of  the  people's  congress.    	Then  there  is  the  abnormal  problem
					    	of  "cadres."
					    	For  10  years  no  study  went  on  in  China.    	Now,   	for  instance,   	only  one-third
					    	of  the  computers  bought  abroad  work;   	the  rest  are  left   	idle  because  of
					    	the  absence  of  essential  specialists.    	Now  100,000  are  needed  and   	in  a
					    	few  years'   	time,  with  the  forecast   	rate  of  d;velopment,   	500,000  will  be
					    	needed.    	And  tha  schaols  are  turning  them  out  at  a  rate  of  only  2,000  a
					    	year.    	This  was  revealed  by  a  deputy  during  the  debate.    	So:    	schools,
					    	new  cadres  and  young  peopl.e.    	The  problem  is  not  only  technical  but
					    	subtly  political.    	The  grassroors  undoubtedly  accepts  a  reform  aimed  at
					    	actiieving  prosperity  ar,d  more  autonomy.    	The  leadership  which  :Lntroduced
					    	the  reform,   	remedying  the  20  years   	of  pararevolutionary  chaos  nurtured
					    	by  Mao  and  the  "gang  of   	four,"  is  composed  of  old  cadres.    	There  is  a
					    	dan~er  that  the  deaf  walls  of  an  apparatus  which  feels  threatened  by
					    	the  reform  will  fall  between   	the  leadership  and  the  grassroots.    	It  is
					    	here  that  the  battle  will  be  decided.    	To  demolish  this  wall  Hua  has
					    	announced  the  formation  of  workers  committees  in  all  enterprises  "with
					    	the  right  to  decide  on  all  important  issues  and  to  choose  or  dismi~ss
					    	managers,"    	Self-management,   	in  other  words.    	The  term  is  not  being  used
					    	yet,   	but  this   	is  what  is  being  aimed  at.    	The  target  seems   	to  be
		  	-			  	impossibly  high,   	a  utopia,   	this  being  a  country  of  1  billion  possible
					    	future  se_lf-managers.    	But  if  we  examine  the  issue  more  carefully,
					    	precisely  because  it  is  so  vast,   	perhaps  radical  decentralization  does
		  	-			  	constitute   	the  only  solution  after  all.    	Otherwise,   	there  would  be  a
					    	return  to  the  alternative  of  the  reigning  "son  of  heaven."
					    	The  future  outlined  by  Hua  Guofeng,  with  all  his   	characteristic  modera-
					    	tion,  was  presented  in  the  guise  of  a  flexible  plan  in  which  economic
					    	requireme~ts  have  not  caused  politico-social  implications  to  be
					    	overlooked  or  vice  versa.    	A  radical  reform  has  been  sought  as   	the  answer
					    	to  a  radical  disaster.
					    	The  cautious  compliments  expressed  by  Brezhnev  in  Alma-Ata  regarding
					    	"the  responsible  internal  processes  ta king  place  in  China,   	which  shun
		  	_			  	Maoist  concepts,"  have  prompted  no  public  repercussions.    	The  most  they
					    	have  prompted   	in  government   	circles  is  mirth--as  if  Brezhnev  was  implying
		  	,			  	that  China  is  again  following  the  Soviet  path  as  the  only  possible  one
					    	to  socialism.    	I  approached  an  official--a  researcher  into  reform--and
					    	asked  him:    	"Does  not  the  present  Chinese  reform  perhaps  have  some  traits
					    	in  common  with  the  reformist  plans  of  Khrushchev  and  Kosygin,  which  were

						[Article  by  Giovanni  de  Brigan~i]
							  	[Text]    	This  article  is  the  first  in  a  series  of  reports  on
							  	the  Chinese  armed  forces  written  following  a~trip  made  by
							 	Giovanni  de  Briganti  last  August  at  the  invitation  of  the
							 	Chinese  defense  minister.    	Subsequent  articles  will  be  devoted
							 	to  the  3$th  Air  Division,   	the  air  force  of  the  Popular  Libera-
		    	_				   	tion  Army,  and  the  Chinese  aeronautics  industry.
						The  city  of  Shi~iazhuang,   	the  capital  of  the  province  of  Hebei,   	is  located
						280  kil~meters  south  of  Bei~ing,  in  a  mainly  agricultural  region.    	It  does  not  have
						a  civilian  airport,  but  one  of  the  pilot  schools  of  the  Chinese  air  force,  which
						I  was  able  to  visit  last  August,  is  located  some  15  kilometers  to  the  northwest
		     	.		 	of  the  Cown.    	Na  particular  effort  has  been  made  to  camouflage  the  base,   	the
						entrance  of  which  is  located  on  a  main  road,   	over  which  planes  fly  ae  they  take
						off.    	Se~urity  seams  rather  summary,  being  limited  to  a  wall  which  is  more
						symbolic  than  functional,   	and  two  guards  armed  only  with  piatols.    	Touring  the
						living  quartera  on  the  base,   	one  sees  only  small  one-story    	buildings,  where  both
						permanent  per~onnel  and  the  student  pilots  are  housed.    	With  the  exception  of  a
		    	-		 	single  ~uilding  eontaining  classrooms,  none  of  the  structures,  not  euen  the
		     	_		 	control  tower,  has  more  than  one  story.
				     	What  immediately  strikes  the  Western  visitor,   	accustomed  to  the  complex  facilities
		    	-		 	at  European  air  bases,   	is  the  poverty  of  the  infrastructure  at  the  Chinese  bases.
						In  fact,   	the  Shi~iazhuang  base-school   	(like  the  base  at  Yangcun,   	the  headquarters
						of  the  38th  Air  Division)  has  no  hangars  at  all,   	all  the  planes  being  covered  with
						tarpaulins  to  protect  them  from  the  weather,   	and  are  parked,   	insofar  as  space
				     	permits,   	in  pens  protected  with  earth.    	This  lack  of  hangars--much  leas  concrete
				     	shelters--also  pertaina   	to  the  maintenance  facilitiea,   	very  summary  moreover.
				     	When  work  by  mechanics  is  needed,  they  go  to  the  plane  and  repair  it  on  the  spet,
				     	wherever  it  is  located  on  the  base   	(runways,  parking  areas,  pens,   	etc),   	even  when
				     	a  ma~or  operation  such  as  an  engine  .~ange  is  involved.    	Similarly,   	one  notices
		    	_		 	the  lack  of  a  control  tower  as  we  know  it:    	surveillance  of  the  runway  and  the
		     	'		 	approach  patterns  is  provided  by  a  single  man,   	located  at  the  window  of  the  first
				     	--and  only--floor  of  a  building  situated  immediately  ad~acent  to  the  parking  area.
				     	The  "operations"  room,   	for  its  part,   	comes  down  to  four  towera  aupporting  a

					 	thN  ground-air  radio  communications,   	aince  the  control  tower  has  only  one  radio  aet
					 	ueed  by  the  single  controller  on  duty.
					 	The  ba:se  has  a  single  runway  2,500  meters  long  running  in  a  north-south  direction,
					 	the  tower  and  parking  area  being  to   	the  west  of  it,   	and  on  either  side  of  them
					 	there  is  a  series  of  pens  which  can  accommodate  3  or  4  planes  each.     	The  poverty
					 	of  the  infrastructure  is  matched  by   	an  extreme  shortage  of  vehicles.    	The  ma_~ority
					 	of  personnel  movements  depend  on  bicycles,   	the  planes  are  towed  by   	trucks,  and
			 	-			the  almost   	tatal  lack  of  runway  equipment   	(buaes,   	generators,   	carts,   	tank  trucks,
			  	~	     	etc)  which  always  crowd  the  parking  areas  of  Western  air  bases  is   	abvious.
					 	The  only  exception  to  this  lack  of  infrastructure  is  two  large  buildings  which
					 	might  be  hangars  located  at  the  eastern  end  of  the  base.    	However  no  details  were
					 	given  about   	their  purpose.
						Al1  of   	the  airplanes  this  base-school  has  are,   	naturally,   	Chine~e  " copies"  of
					 	Soviet  models.    	One  sees  mainly  Type  5  fighters,   	extrapolated  from  the  MiG-17,   	in
					 	b~th  one-seater  and  two-seater  versions.    	With  r~gard  to  these  planes,  let  us  note
			 	~	     	that,   	contrary  to  what  has  been  reported  in  the  Western  press,   	the   	Chinese  ~io
					 	designate  the  MiG-17  Type  5,   	and  not  Type  4,   	as  some  claim.    	Moreover,  some  Fong
					 	Shou  No  2  bipl.anes   	(the  Chinese  designation  of  the  Autonov  An-2  Colt)   	are  used  for
					 	liaieon  missions,   	parachute  drops  and  light  transport.    	Two  of  them  were  parked  in
						Che  pens,  while  a  half-dozen  others  were  lined  up  about  1,000  meters   	from  the
						runway  in  the  eastern  area  of  the  base.    	Finally,   	this  school  also  has  single-
						engine  piston  Type  6  planes,   	derived  from  the  Soviet  Yak-18,   	for  the  early  training
						stages.    	The  planes  mentioned  in  this  article  will  be  described  in  further  detail
						in  the  articles  devoted  to  the  air  force  and  the  Chinese  aeronautic   	industry.
						On  the  day  of  my  visit,   	only  a  few  An-2  flights  took  place,   	while  the  basic  serial
						activity  involved  frequent   	and  consecutive  tours  of  the  runwa;~  by  two-seater  F-5s.
						One  last  remark  on  the  subject  of  flight  uniforms.    	Contrary  to  the   	situation  in
						the  Weat,   	student  pilots  do  not  have  a  real  flight  uniforni,   	only  a  costume  includ-

						but   	rather  a  headgear  of  leather  reinforced  on  the  upper  portion,   	s imilar  to  those
						uaed  by  Soviet  tank  crews.    	The  oxygen  masks,   	for  their  part,   	are   	left  in  the

				  	of  the  air  force  school  command  made  this  school  responsible  for  the  training  of

				  	Pilots  trained  at   	Shi~iazhuang  have  destroyed  119  enemy  aircraft  in  the  course  of

				  	The  two  middle-level  training  regiments  are  stationed  at  a  nearby  airport,   	and
				  	have  only  a  grass  runway,  where  all  of  the  ~ype  6  training  aircraft   	are  usually

	 	-	    	Candidates  in  tr.a  Chinese  pilot  schools  come  generally  from  the  land  army,   	but  it
		     	does  happen  that  some  come  directly  from  the  civilian  aector.    	Between  16  and				    	_
	 	_	    	18  years  of  nge,   	the  candidates  have  certificates  for  the  second  cycle  of  general			    	-
		     	education.    	After  their  initial  selection,   	they  take  courses  at  an  air  force
		     	preparatory  school,   	following  which  an  examination  serves   	to  eliminate  the  least
		     	r~pt,   	on  the  basis  of  academic  and  physical  as  well  as  ideological  criteria.    	This
		     	selection,  linked  with  the  vast  reservoir  from  which  Che  Chinese  armed  forces  can
		     	draw,  ensures  a  choice  of  candidates  with  a  very  high  intellzctual  and  physical
		     	level.    	The  selecti~n  process  is  very  stiff,  because  it  allows  for  the  retention
		     	of  only  1  percent  of  th~  candidates  at  the  end  of  this  first  phase.							 	-
		     	The  candidates  who  have  met  the  initial  selection  criteria  then  pursue  a  cycle  of
		-	    	basic  military  training  lasting  6  months,   	corresponding  roughly  to  the  "classes"
		     	puraued  by  recruits  in  France.    	It  is  only  at  the  end  of  this  cycle  that  the
		     	candidates  are  assigned  to  one  or  another  of  the  pilot  schools  as  such.
		     	The  training  provided  by  the  Shijiazhuang  school  takes  2  years  and  4  months,   	and  it		     	!
		     	appears  that  the  ma~ority  of  the  other  schools  have  adopted  a  similar  scheme.    	The				~
		     	training  the  student  pilots  receive  is  divided  into  three  phases:    	basic  training,
		     	middle-level  training  and  advanced  training,   	representing,   	in  Cninese  terminology,
	 	~	    	basic  theory,   	basic  training  and  attack  training.    	Let  us  note  in  passing  that
		     	thF:ee  three  phases  are  comparable  to  the  training  stages  for  the  student  pilots   	at			  	-
		     	Aulnat,   	Cognac,   	Tours  and  Cazaux,   	in  France,   	that   	is  to  say  four  schools  at  which
		     	the  misaiona,   	methods  and  aircraft  are  very  different.
		     	A.    	Basic  Theory
		     	This  first  phase  of  pilot  training  is  provided  directly  at  the  school  and  lasts				 	-
		     	4  months,   	i.e.   	490  class  hours.    	It  includes  no  approach  to  piloting  as  such,   	but
				is  designed  rather  to  familiarize  the  future  pilots  with  the  theory  of  aviation.
		     	The  course  includes  seven  main  sub~ects:    	the  laws  of  aerodynamics,  navigation,
				firing  theory,   	meteorology,   	aircraft  structure,  principles  and  functioning  of
		     	piston  and,jet  engines,   	principles  of  radiocaffinunications  and,   	in  addition,   	para-
				chute  training.    	Every  student  pilot,  on  completion  of  this  first  cycle,   	is  in
	 	-	    	fact  a  certified  parachute  jumper,    	t  was  able  to  visit  the  classrooms  at  the
	 	_	    	school  in  which  students  were  pursuing  the  courses  in  this  first  phase.    	One  notes
				first  of  a11  the  extent  and  the  variety  of  the  pedagogical  equipment:    	Practically
				every  aerodynamic  principle,   	every  law  of  aviation  and  every  piece  of  equipment   	is
				explained  through  the  use  of  adapted  demonstration  equipment.    	This  equipment,
				often  made  by  hand,  all  has  moreover  the  merit  of  clarity  and  often  ingenuity.
				Each  of  the  seven  main  sub~ects   	is  taught  in  a  special  classroom,  where  the
				necessary  equipment  is  available.    	In  addition,   	some  use  is  made  of  audiovisual
	 	-	    	methods.    	In  fac~,   	in  the  teaching  of  almost  all  the  aub~ects  films  linking  camera
				shots  and  explanatory  diagrams   	are  used;    	there  is  in  addition  a  closed-circuit
	 	-	    	televisic~n  sygtem  with  three  channels,  by  means  of  which  some  courses  can  be
	 	-	    	taught  simultaneously  to  several  classes.													    	~

			   	The  gecond  training  cycle  is  that  during  which  the  studentpilots  make  their
			   	first   	flight.    	It   	lasts  a  year  and  in.cludes   	770   	course  hours,   	including  150  hours
			   	in  the  air.    	This   	cycle  is   	taught  in  a  school  annex  located  at  a  neighboring
			   	airport.    	The  aircraft   	used  in  this  phase  is   	the  Type  6  trainer  plane,   	a  Chinese
	 	-		  	variation  of   	the   	Soviet  Yak-18.
			   	In  the  course  of  this   	cycle,   	stress  is  placed  on  piloting  as   	such.    	In  addition  to
			   	the  150  hours  of   	flight,   	the  student  pilots   	take   	287  course  hours  devoted  to  the
			   	theory  uf  piloting.																		    	-
			   	The  students   	progress  according  to  the  traditional  patt~rn:    	basic  pilot  training,
	 	=		  	first  solo  flight,   	circling  the  runway,  na~vigation,  blind  flying,   	night  flying  and		     	-

			   	On  an  average,   	the  student  pilot   	complete~  40  percent  of  the  planned   	flight  hours
			   	(60  hours)  in  solo   	fli ght.

				   	Fighter  Training
		~		  	ihe  third  and  last  phase  of  fighter  pilot  training  lasts  a  year,   	and  involves
			   	$S  hours  of  flight   	in  a~et  aircraft   	(TypQ  5),   	with  about  40   	percent  being  solo
			   	f.light ,    	For   	this  phase,   	the  student  pilots  return  to  the  scho~l,   	where  the
	 	_		  	facilities  and  the  paved  runway  allow  the  use  of  ~et  aircraft.
	 	_		  	Stress  is  placed  on  perfzcting  skills,   	but  the  students  nonetheless  have  another
	 	=		  	213  h~urs  of   	theoretical  classes  to  complete.
	 	-		  	The  instruction  includes  six  main  subjects:     	formation  flying,  blind  flying  and
			   	night  flying,   	navigation,   	aerobatics,   	and  for  the  first  time,   	air-to-air  combat
			   	and  air-to-ground   	attack.    	In  view  of  ;.he  limited  use  the  Chinese  air  force  makes
	 	-		  	of  air-to-air  missiles ,   	the  maj or  part  of  air  combat  training  has   	to  do  with  firing
	 	-		  	gims.    	The  pilots   	as~igned   	to  units  equipped  with  missiles  will  be  trained  there.
			   	There  is  a  kind  of  simulator,  more  or  less  homemade,  moreover,   	for  air-to-air
			   	target  practice.    	The  pilot  sits  in  a  mockup  of  a  cockpit  which  can  be  maneuvered
			   	on  three  axes,   	and  "fires"   	at  targets  attached  to  a  small  scaffolding  mounted  on
	 	-		  	casters.    	Another  pedagogical  apparatus  simulates  targets  by   	the  projection  of  a			  	_

			   	For  air-to-ground  attack,  weaponry  is  more  varied,   	and  includes  rockets  and  bombs
			   	as  well  as  guns.     	There  is   	no  simulator  for  this   	type  of  mission,   	and  training  for

   	-	   	It  is  amusing  to  note  that  the  air-to-air  comb3t  si~nulators  use  as  targets  mock-ups
   	~	   	of  the  F-100  Super  Saber,   	or  a  film  showing  the  maneuvers  of  a~-29  Stratofortress.
			In  other  worda,  vintage  aircraft!
		 	In  the  course  of  this  last  phase   	of  their  training,   	the  student  pilots  also  take
			political  courses  and  general  military  training  courses.
   	_	   	On  completion  of  this  third  cycle,  the  student  pilots  take  a  final  examination
		 	including  tests  in  four  fields:    	political  education,  piloting  technique,   	piloting
   	=	   	theory  and  a  physical  examination.    	The  way  in  which  the  candidates  have  worked  is
		 	also  taken  int.o  account,   	as  well  as  the  grades  they  have  earned  since  enrollment
		 	in  the  school.
   	-	   	The  student  pilots  who  pass  this  examination  become  fighter  pilots,   	and  are
		 	immediately  assigned  to  operational  units.    	Let  us  note  that   	there  is  no  ceremony					-
		 	for  the  presentation  of  "wings,"  nor  for  that  matter  any  "wings,"  because  the
		 	Chinese  military  wear  no  symbol  of  rank  or  specialty.
		 	Arriving  at  the  unit  to  which  he  is  first  assigned,   	the  Chinese  pilot  is   	considered
		 	ready  to  serve.    	He  does  not   	take  any  more  specialized  training  in  the  course  of
		 	his   	first  year  at  the  unit,   	although  the  some  100  hours   	of  solo  flight  he  had  at
		 	tYie  school  are  naturally  insuificient.    	It  is  then  within  his  unit  that  th~  new
    	-	   	ptlot  becomes   	familiar  with  armed  aircraft,   	if  they  are  not  F-Ss.    	To  this  end,
		 	the  units  have  some  two-seaters   	and  a  flight  simulator.
   	_	   	Generally,   	a  fighter  pilot  will  spend  his  enCire  career  within  a  single  unit.
		 	Unlike  what  happens  in  other  countries,   	it  is  in  China  the  units  which  are
		 	transferred  from  one  base  to  another,   	and  not  the  pilots  individually.    	It  is
		 	within  the  unit  that  the  young  pilot  will  make  progress  and,   	although  there  are  not
		 	in  th~  Chinese  air  force  any  rigid  pilot  classifications   	(wing  man,  patrol  leader,
		 	etc),  pilots   	are  c~rtified  for  daytime  flight,  night  flight,   	IFR  flight  on  the
		 	basis  of  their  competence.																	    	_
		 	There  is  a  considerable  flow  back  and  forth  between  units  and  the  various  schools,			    	_
		  	and  it  often  happens  that  a  pilot  is  temporarily  assigned  to  a  school  as   	an
		  	instructor.
		 	As  an  alternative  to  assignment   	to  a  combat  unit,   	a  young  pilot  may  choose  to
    	-	    	serve  as  an  instructor  in  the  school  where  he  was  trained.    	He  then  becomes   	an
		  	assistant  inatructor  for  a  year  and  is  then  promoted  to  instructor.    	It  is
		  	doubtless  because  of  this  option  that  the  instructors  at  Shijiazhuang  have  an				     	_
		  	average  of  only  300  to  400  hours  of  flight  time  to  their  credit.
		  	Bomber  and  transport  pilots  have  a  training  program  like  that  of  the  fighter
    	-	    	pilots,   	with  the  exception,   	naturally,   	of  the  type  of  aircraft  in  which  they  are
		  	trained.    	The  physical  requirements  are  also  different,   	and  while  a  fighter  pilot
		  	must  be  between  1.65  meters   	and  1.78  meters  tall,   	this   	is  not  the  case  for  pilots
		  	with  other  specialtiea.

    	'			General  Coneiderations																			_
		   	The  preceding  pages  were  drafted  on  the  basis  of  information  supplied  by  the				   	-
    	-			general  staff  of  t?ie  achool  at  Sh3.iiazhuang,   	and  the  personal  observationa  of  the
		   	author.    	The   	following  remarks  are  presented  separately  to  avoid  any  distortion
		   	of  "official"  information.
		   	Without  any  doubt,   	the  strangest  aspect  of  the  training  of  Chinese  pilota  is  that
		    	it  is  provided  by  a  single  school,  providing  the  whole  of  thP  training,   	from  the
    	-			preliminary  stage  to  training  in  armed  aircraft.    	One  can  hardly  see  what  the
		    	advantages  o�  this  pian  might  be,   	except  for  the  rapidity  with  which  a  candidate
   	-			proceeds  in  a  little  more  than  2  years  through  a11  of  the  levels  between  his
		    	enrollment  in  the  air  force  and  his  assignment  to  an  operational  unit  as  a  pilot
		    	deemed  ready  for  combat.    	On  the  other  hand,   	the  obviously  undesirable  aspects  in-				-
		    	herent  in  this  system  are  numerous.
		    	First  of  all,   	the  fact  that  severai  schools  in  different  military  regions  provide			  	-
    	.			the  same  training  makes  a  lack  of  qualitative  uniformity  among  the  pilots  3..nevit-
		    	able,  which  must  have  an  unfavorable  effect  on  the  proper  functioning  of  the  unit.
		    	Whatever  the   	zigor  with  which  the  programs  established  by  the  general  staff  are
		    	implemented,   	each  school  will  in  fact  insist  on  this  or  that  other  asp~ct  to  the			   	-
   	_			neglect  of  others  which  might,   	on  the  contrary,   	seem  of  primary  importance  to  the
		    	general  ataff  of  another  school.    	The  result  is,  it  seems,   	training  which  differs
		    	from  school  to  school,  which  is  unlikely  to  have  a  beneficial  effect  on  the
   	-			funetional  level  of  the  units.
		    	Similarly,   	one  can  easily  imagine  the  cost,   	in  terms  of  construction,  equipping  and
		    	operations,   	of  this  duplication  of  pilot  schools,  their  installations,   	their
   	_			pedagogical  infrastructures  and  their  support  personnel.    	And,  in  addition,   	if  we
		    	remember  that  in  fact  all  the  pilots,  whether  destined  �or  pursuit,  bomber  or
		    	transport  service,  must  in  zny  case  take  the  same  basic  training  and  the  same
		    	pre~iminary  training  which  could  be  provided  by  a  single  school,  we  can  see  how
		    	coatly  this  system  must  be.																    	-
   	-			The  system  also  requires  the  general  staff  of  the  air  force  to  draw  off  a  very					-
		    	large  number  of  pilots,   	both  on  the  level  of  schools  and  that  of  the  operational			   	_
		    	units,   	to  supply  instructors  to  the  various  schools.    	When  we  realize  how  much  the
		    	training  of  a  pursuit  pilot  costs  today   	(in  France,  there  is  talk  of  several
		    	million  francs,   	the  exact  figure  depending  on  the  parameters  used  for  the  calcula-				_
		    	tion),   	one  can  see  that  here  again  rationalizati~n  is  not  one  of  the  priority  goals
		    	of  the  Chinese  air  force.
		    	If  these  undesirable  aspects  pertain  mainly  to  infrastructure  problems,   	there  are			 	_
		    	others  on  the  level  of  the  quality  of  the  training  given  the  pilot.    	In  fact,   	the
		    	entire  advancement  of  the  studPnt  pilot  depends  on  but  two  types  of  aircraft,   	a
		    	single-piston-engine  plane  and  a  single-engine  jet:    	there  is  no  intermediary
		    	aircraft   	(such  as  the  Fouga  Magister  in  France),  and  the  experience  of  the  student
		    	pilot   	ia  limited  ~hereby.    	It   	is  as  if  in  France  a  student  pilot  were  to  proceed
		    	directly  from  the  CAP  10  to  the  Mystere  IVA,  without  being  able  to  benefit   	from
		    	experience  with  the~  Magister  in  Cognac.    	The  objection  will  naturally  be  raised

			  	Mareover,   	the  f~ct  that  the  whole  of  the  training  takes  place  at  one  single  air-
			  	port  with  unchanging  characteristics   	(same  runway  circuit,   	same  procedurea,   	same
			  	weather  conditions,  etc)   	doea  nothing  either  to  expand  the  horizons  of  a  student
			  	pilot  or  to  enrich  his  experience.    	What  will  the  performance  o{  a  pilot  trained
			  	~xclusively  at   	Shi~iazhuang  be,   	for  example,   	if  he  is  assigned  to  a  MiG-19  unit
			  	stationed  in  Manchuria  or  Canton?    	How  much  time  will  it  take  him  to  familiarize
	   	-	     	himself  not  only  with  his  new  aircraft,  but  also  with  the  i~ew  weather  conditions?			   	-
			  	Fina~lly,   	it  would  be  well  to  take  into  account  the  fact  that  when  he  is  assigned  to
			  	hie  unit,  the  young  Chinese  pilot  has   	to  his   	credit  only  235  flight  hours,   	in-				 	_
			  	cluding  100  solo  hours,   	and  only  35  hours  in  a  single-seater  ~et.    	Beyond  any
			  	doubt  these  totals  seem  inadequate;   	and  it  is  doubtful  if  the  supplmentary  year
			  	of  training  in  his  unit  will  suffice  to  fill  in  this  gap.    	This  has  to  do  moreover
			  	nat  only  with  the  number  of  flight  hours,   	but  above  all  the  ill-sui~ed  aircraft
	  	=	     	in  which  the  flight  hours  were  acquired.													    	-
	   	-	     	Apart  from  these  co~nents  of  a  general  nature,   	I  was  struck  by  two  more  specific
			  	considerations.
			  	On  the  one  hand,   	the  student  pilots  I   	saw  in  training  were  very  skillful,  and  on
			  	landing,   	for  example,  none  of  the  20  approaches  I  was  able  to  observe  was  faulty.
			  	The  student  pilots  see~ed  to  be  in  control  of  their  actions,   	and  the  touchdowns
			  	wer.e  effected  in  uniformly  satisfactory  fashion.    	This  is  an  indication  of  the				 	-
			  	quality  of  the  training  the  student  pilots  receive,  but  it  cannot  be  denied  that
			  	the  selection  of  only  1  percent  of  the  candidates  guarantees  a  general  qualitative			  	.
	   	_	     	level  which  we  could  never  hope  for.														    	-
			  	The  second  comment  has  to  do  w~th  the  general  form  training  takes.    	In  fact,
			  	despite  the  specific  characteristics  of  the  Chinese  system,   	and  despite  the  un-
			  	deniably  old-fashioned  equipment  and  pedagogical  equipment,   	there  is   	an
	   	_	     	astonishing  aimilarity  in  the  nature  of  the  training  offered.    	The  sub~ect  matter
			  	is  baAically  the  same,  with  the  exception  of  the  political  education  and  the
			  	pgrachute  training,   	and  the  concept  of  training,  which  depends  heavily  on  practical
	   	_	     	work,   	ia  rather  close  to  the  Western  concept.    	Lecture  courses,   	for  example,   	are			    	_
			  	reduced  to  their  simplest  expreasion  and  are  replaced  wherever  possible  by  practical
	   	.	     	work,  training  films,   	actual  experience  or  demonstrations.    	One  can  moreover				    	=
			  	imagine  the  integration  of  Western  pedagogical  equipment  in  the  existing  infra-
	   	-	     	structure  in  Chinese  pilot  schools  rather  easily.
			  	This  shows   	that  despite  30  years  of  isolation,   	the  training  given  to  Chinese
	   	-	     	pilots  has  roughly  followed  the  development  of  Western  training,   	at  least  in  its
			  	general  philosophy.																				-

			  	These  notes  pertain  onl~  to  those  planes  I  actually  saw  at  Shijiazhuang.

     	-		  	Fou  Shong  No  2(Antonov  An-2  Colt).    	The  three  An-2s  I  saw  at  Shi~iazhuano  were  all
			  	painted  dark  green,  both  on  the  inner  and  outer  sides  of  the  wings.    	The  propeller
			  	blades  were  painted  a  matte  black,  with  yellow  tips.    	A  broad,   	broken  white  stripe		   	_
			  	was  painted  on  the  upper  portion  of  the  fuselage.    	A  four-figure  code  is  painted
			  	in  white  on  top  of  the  fin.    	Two  of  the  three  planes  had  six  fuselage  markir.gs  in
			  	the  usual  poeitions   	(two  on  the  underside  of  the  lower  wing,   	two  on  the  outer  side
     	-		   	of  the  upper  wing,   	and  one  on  each  side  of  the  rear  of  the  fuselage),  with  a  red
			  	background  and  a  yellow  edging.    	The  third,  on  the  other  hand,  had  markings  on  a
			   	green  background,  with  the  same  yellow  edging.
     	-		   	T-6   	(Yak-18).    	The  only  T-6  I  saw  at  Shi~iazhuang  was    	also  painted  dark  green.
     	-		   	The  inner  and  lower  surfaces  of  the  fuselage  were  painted  a  strong  sky  blue.    	The
			   	six  fuselage  markings  were  red,  edged  in  yellow.    	The  aircraft  carried  its  five-				-
			   	figure  identification   	(62649)   	on  the  sides  of  the  fin,   	and  the  first  and  last
			   	figures   	(69)  were  repeated  on  the  two  sides  of  the  cowling.    	There  t~o  the  codes
			   	were  painted  in  white.																	   	-
			   	F-S   	(MiG-17).    	The  Type  5  fighters,  both  two-seaters  and  single-seaters,  were  all,
     	-		   	without  exception,   	aluminum  painted.    	They  carried  a  five-figure  code  on  the  nose,		   	-
			   	in  large  red  figures,  as  well  as  a  short  "text"  in  ideograms  some  20  centimeters
			   	below  the  leading  edge  of  each  wing.    	The  fuselage  markings,   	again  appearing  in  the
			   	six  positions,  wzre  red  edged  with  yellow.    	They  showed  signs  of  wear,  in  some
			   	cases  extensive.																		     	_
			   	The  codes.    	Although  no  details  were  provided  by  the  Chinese  authorities,  the
			   	codes  borne  by  all  the  aircraft  certainly  have  some  significance  as  to  the  units
			   	to  which  the  planes  are  assigned.    	The  F-5s  I  saw  at  Shi~iazhuang,   	for  example,
			   	all  bore  a  code  in  which  the  first  two  figures  were  63.    	Depending  on  whether  a
			   	single-seater  or  a  two-seater  was  concerned,  moreover,   	the  third  figure  was  gen-
			   	eraily  higher  or  lower  than  5.
	 	,		   	The  T-6  carried  the  code  62,   	for  its  part,  but  on  the  fin,  while  the  An-2s  had
	 	;		   	only  a  4-figure  code,  also  painted  on  the  fin.
