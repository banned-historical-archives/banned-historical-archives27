 Rivals of Hu Yaobang:

 Succession in China

 as of 4 June 1984  Although Hu is not universally admired within the top ranks of the party,
 was used in this report.
 he remains the strongest candidate within his generation to succeed, in
 time, Deng.
 We believe, however, that political power in China is structured in such a
 way that Hu, who now holds the nominal top post of General Secretary,
 cannot quickly take Deng's place and fill all his pivotal functions within the
 top leadership. In China, power within the party tends to gravitate toward
 the most experienced senior leaders, those who have developed the personal
 connections necessary to sustain a long political life.
 We believe that Deng's peers-men like Li Xiannian, Chen Yun, and Peng
 Zhen-will decide the immediate succession. In our judgment, a member
 of this older generation for the near term is likely to inherit Deng's pivotal
 roles of political broker and final authority, while Hu Yaobang will
 continue to preside over, rather than rule, the party.
 Should Hu falter, however, his place as General Secretary and eventual
 successor to Deng could, in our judgment, be capably filled by any of
 several well-qualified leaders from Hu's own generation. All have solid
 party credentials, occupy prominent party posts, and are supported by
 Deng or one or more of Deng's generational peers. We believe that Premier
 Zhao Ziyang and Vice Premier Wan Li are the most suitable of Hu's
 potential rivals for the party's top spot, even though neither man has shown
 a desire to advance at Hu's expense. Other national leaders such as Vice
 Premier Yao Yilin, party Secretary Chen Pixian, and Beijing Military
 Region Commander Qin Jiwei will almost certainly play key roles in the
 succession and in our judgment will be mainstays of the post-Deng regime.
 Deng and his reformist allies have sought to groom a group of younger
 leaders who are capable of leading the party and China into the next
 century, but, given China's generational pecking order, this "third eche-
 lon" leadership is now too junior both in age and experience to break into
 the upper ranks.

 A collective leadership arrangement involving Hu-a troika, for exam-
 ple-would indicate to us that the old guard had rejected Hu and was
 seeking to establish an alternative. We view coups by the Chinese military
 or by Hu and his generational peers as extremely remote possibilities after
 Deng goes. And even more unlikely, in our view, is a resurgence of the left-
 ism of the Cultural Revolution era.
 This paper is necessarily speculative. We are confident that, based on our
 understanding of the system, we have identified the major participants in
 China's succession politics. We have but fragmentary information, howev-
 er, on the crucial relationships between the players or on intraleadership
 tensions that may exist beneath the surface.

 Rivals of Hu Yaobang:
 Political Leadership and
 Succession in China
 In the nearly six years that Deng Xiaoping has been
 China's paramount leader, he has sought to make the
 political world in China safe for Hu Yaobang, his
 longtime protege who serves as party General Secre-
 tary. At 79 and laboring under the encroaching
 shadow of his own death, Deng has worked steadily to
 arrange Hu's accession not simply to the party's top
 job but to genuine party primacy.
 Deng's formal place within the party is only third
 (after Hu and the ailing Ye Jianying); but, despite
 China's acutely hierarchical system, he is broker,
 conciliator, and final decisionmaker. Perhaps para-
 doxically, it is precisely this state of affairs, in which a
 junior leader officially presides while the subordinate
 elder leader actually rules, that may force Deng's
 generational peers-men like Politburo members Li
 Xiannian and Peng Zhen-into eventual competition
 with Hu for recognition as the party's dominant
 leader. When Deng dies, the main task before the
 leadership will not be the formal selection of a new
 party chief-Hu already holds that post. The immedi-
 ate succession issue will be to answer the more
 complex question: who will wield Deng's power?
 By all accounts, Deng is in good health despite a
 variety of minor ailments. However, because he ap-
 parently intends to remain active as long as he is
 physically able, his departure is likely to be abrupt,
 creating a leadership vacuum that must be filled
 quickly. By establishing Hu in the party's top nominal
 post, Deng has sought to head off a succession
 struggle and thereby break a cycle of political conflict
 that dates back to the 1950s.` Hu's political assets,
 ' Deng cannot be encouraged by Communist Chinese precedent.
 Mao Zedong tried three times to select his own successor and failed
 at each turn (with Liu Shaoqi in the 1950s, Lin Biao in the 1960s,
 and the so-called Gang of Four-his wife and her radical asso-
 ciates-in the 1970s). In the first two cases, Mao himself overthrew
 succession arrangements. The Gang of Four was, of course, toppled
 by party regulars following Mao's death. Hua Guofeng, a compro-
 mise choice who had Mao's approval, fared little better.
 power within the system, usually generate the most intense political
 battles. Historically, tensions over arranged succession have been
 between the leader and the Politburo rank and file over the leader's
 choice and, more fundamentally, over his right to choose; between
 the leader and the successor over power sharing and timing of
 accession to authority; and between the successor and the Politburo
 rank and file over attempts to limit the successor's future powers or
 however, fall far short of Deng's more than 50 years
 of party experience, well-honed political instincts, and
 unsurpassed political connections. Leaders of Deng's
 generation like Li and Peng have the personal stature
 and connections within the party to vie for Deng's

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/05/20: CIA-RDP85T00310R000100180003-4
 preeminent place. Moreover, the distribution of power
 within the party favors the old guard: elderly and
 increasingly frail officials clog the decisionmaking
 system at the top and have delayed the emergence of a
 younger, more active leadership that would gravitate
 to Hu Yaobang.
 In our view, under Deng's tutelage and backed by his
 political might, Hu has made steady gains in his
 efforts to win acceptance as the party's legitimate
 head. With Deng's backing, Hu became the titular
 party chief in late 1980 and has gradually assumed
 control over routine party affairs, placed a growing
 number of supporters in key offices, and worked to
 promote a reform agenda for China's party, state, and
 economy. We believe that, despite his political liabil-
 ities, Hu's assets are unmatched by any leader of his
 own generation.' As the leader who exercises perhaps
 the greatest day-to-day influence over the lives of the
 Chinese people, Hu seems comfortable in his job and
 conducts himself with an appropriate air of authority.
 In our judgment, he is secure while Deng lives.F_
 Hu nevertheless has a twofold succession problem.
 Although he is the political star of his generation, he
 must first contend with the influence of the party
 elders who, in our estimation, can assert the preroga-
 tives of seniority to ensure that one of their own
 inherits Deng's preeminent authority. A small elite
 within the party, the party elders are Hu's immediate
 rivals in the post-Deng era. However, because virtual-
 ly all of the veteran revolutionaries are near or in their
 eighties, we believe their period of maximum influ-
 ence will be brief.
 The problem of the old guard aside, Hu's potential
 rivals over the long run will come from among his
 peers, the "second echelon" of China's leaders.' If for
 ' In the 1950s, Mao spoke of dividing the leadership into two
 "lines" of administration, with the first line responsible for daily
 affairs and the second-consisting of older, experienced, semire-
 tired leaders-providing broad policy guidelines, but from a dis-
 tance, without crowding the first-line leadership. Under Deng, the
 media have discussed not only first and second lines, but even other
 levels of retirement. In mid-1983, Hu Yaobang announced a
 variation when he claimed that the leadership consisted of three
 "echelons": the first-echelon leaders were Deng and his genera-
 tional peers, who were no longer on the first line of administration;
 the second-echelon leaders were, like Hu and Premier Zhao
 Ziyang, attending to day-to-day business; and third-echelon leaders
 were those who were relatively young (30 to 50 or so) who would be
 some reason Hu does not inherit the place Deng has
 staked out for him, his place could, in our judgment,
 be capably filled by any of several well-qualified
 younger officials whom Deng and his senior col-
 leagues have sponsored for high posts within the party
 and state bureaucracies. The national-level leaders of
 Hu's generation in many ways are similar to Hu in
 experience and extent of high-level political support.
 They appear well positioned to occupy prominent
 positions in any post-Deng constellation of power: a
 few will presumably join Hu and Zhao at the pinna-
 cle, the Politburo Standing Committee; others will
 preside over the government and military bureaucra-
 cies.
 Hu's generational peers within the leadership are not
 active challengers for the post of General Secretary.
 Among them, there are few, if any, "enemies of
 continuity," that is, those who would dramatically
 reverse policies that China has pursued since late
 1978. However, political events may transform a
 potential rival into an actual competitor: even if these
 leaders are now Hu's political allies, each will be close
 enough to the inner circle to be conscious of-and
 perhaps tempted by-perceived opportunities and
 risks under a new regime.
 Prerequisites for Successors
 Hu Yaobang is Deng's best known protege, though
 certainly not the only one. Deng's hand, in fact, can
 be seen in personnel assignments throughout the
 middle reaches of the party and military hierarchy.
 Sometimes his patronage is publicly acknowledged,
 sometimes not, but the vast majority of younger
 national- or provincial-level leaders have almost cer-
 tainly had to pass Deng's scrutiny.
 Deng has not been alone in pushing proteges. His
 colleagues on the Politburo Standing Committee,
 especially Li Xiannian and Chen Yuri, and other
 powerful national-level leaders such as Peng Zhen all
 have recognizable associates at or near the Politburo
 or Secretariat level. Indeed, in seeking to distinguish
 Hu Yaobang's potential rivals from the pack of
 promising officials, the chief qualification is backing
 by one or more of the party's powerhouses. Without
 this patronage, an otherwise strong candidate is likely
 to languish in the middle reaches of the bureaucracy.

 Secret
 In our view, the officials who can justifiably be
 numbered among China's "leaders of the future"
 must share several important characteristics aside
 from significant ties to party elders:
 ? A current position in the highest party or state
 offices-either in Beijing (Politburo or Secretariat
 member, Vice Premier) or in the provinces (party
 secretary, governor).
 ? A reasonable life expectancy-that is, younger than
 the current crop of leaders, but still old enough to be
 taken seriously (generally, born not earlier than
 around 1915).
 ? Long and varied service to the party-party mem-
 bership that dates at least from the late 1930s.
 Other attributes are useful but cannot be regarded as
 indispensable. A substantial political base-whether
 of old cronies sprinkled throughout the central bu-
 reaucracy or the provinces or a stronghold within a
 single organization-is helpful but not necessary;
 political bases can be built after an official is raised to
 prominence.` Neither can it hurt for a promising
 leader to have a creditable military record, to stand
 him in good stead with the Politburo's numerous
 soldier-politicians. Another recent asset is university
 education, although the deep distrust that many
 tradition-bound party leaders continue to hold for
 intellectuals somewhat limits its importance.F___1
 Who To Watch?
 Several officials from the successor generation stand
 out as potential rivals to Hu Yaobang. Most are from
 the central leadership, and we have arranged them in
 concentric circles according to our evaluation of their
 potential as candidates for the post of party General
 Secretary or for other key posts in the post-Deng
 Politburo.'
 ' A leader often can convert the political capital that a specific
 party office confers into major gains. Some leaders of the successor
 generation, such as Hu and Zhao, already enjoy a commanding
 advantage by virtue of the power of their offices. Control over
 certain powerful offices-for example, the Central Committee's
 Organization Department (that is, the party's personnel office) or
 the security bureaus-can under some conditions become useful
 levers, especially in a system such as China's that tends to reward
 loyalty. Other top positions do not as markedly improve the
 prospects of their occupants. Leadership in the propaganda, foreign
 relations, and science and technology fields generally have not been
 the most promising avenues to a top place in the party.
 ' The use of concentric circles ("first circle," "second circle") to
 label groups is meant as a suggestive clustering of the leaders
 around an imagined center of power. It does not involve an
 elaborate methodology. As an organizing device, placing each
 individual official within a group clarifies our presentation of the
 estimated pecking order within China's next generation of officials.
 The First Circle. We believe Hu's most powerful
 potential rival is Premier Zhao Ziyang, who thus far
 has shown no inclination to be cast in a threatening
 role. Along with Zhao in the first, or inner, circle we
 place senior Vice Premiers Wan Li and Yao Yilin as
 well as a Secretariat member who has the public
 security portfolio, Chen Pixian. In our view, these
 men-whose standing is largely independent of
 Hu's-form the core of the second-echelon leadership
 and may be seen within the party as legitimate
 alternatives to Hu Yaobang.
 All four men have strong qualifications: they are in
 their middle-to-late sixties, occupy positions of great
 influence, joined the party in the 1930s, exercised
 responsibility at an early age, and appear to have
 powerful sponsorship among the party elders. Three
 (Yao being the exception) have had successful tours in
 the provinces; in fact, Zhao and Chen established
 their reputations outside of Beijing, and both are
 relatively new to the capital. Moreover, Zhao and
 Wan have, in their old bailiwicks of Sichuan and
 Anhui, enjoyed clear-cut successes implementing pro-
 vincial reforms, while Hu has yet to demonstrate
 conclusively that he can "deliver the goods."
 Zhao is the best known of the four.' He got his start as
 a party tough in the land reform movement in South
 China and, under the patronage of a powerful region-
 al leader, eventually rose through the Guangdong
 party bureaucracy to become China's youngest pro-
 vincial first secretary. After his return from Cultural
 Revolution disgrace, Zhao experienced a string of
 successes in three widely disparate provincial assign-
 ments, and during a four-year stint he converted
 faction-ravaged Sichuan Province into a showcase of
 economic reform. By then, Deng had already marked
 Zhao for national leadership. In Sichuan, Zhao de-
 parted from his earlier strongman style, refashioning
 himself into a technocrat and winning recognition as a
 tactful, innovative administrator and party leader.II
 Vice Premier Wan Li is an intriguing potential rival 25X1
 for the top spot-doubly so, presuming Zhao is
 content as premier. Wan began his career as an
 economic specialist (in southwest China under Deng)
 and by 1956, at 38, had risen to become Minister of

 Urban Construction. Along with the backing of Deng,
 Wan may also have the support of Politburo member
 Peng Zhen, former boss of the Beijing municipal
 party political machine-where Wan served from
 1958 to 1966 as a party secretary and deputy may-
 or-and still one of China's half dozen most powerful
 men. Precisely how Wan balances his loyalties to both
 Deng and Peng remains an open question, but his
 association with both leaders is a powerful asset. The
 willingness of the central leadership to delegate im-
 portant troubleshooting assignments to Wan suggests
 his broad acceptability among diverse leaders. Wan is
 thought to be responsible for the rural economic
 reforms that have contributed to four straight years of
 bumper harvests.
 As an economic policy maker and administrator, Yao
 Yilin, like Wan Li, seems to have broad appeal within
 the top leadership. Yao presumably has the support of
 his longtime mentor, Li Xiannian, as well as backing
 by Standing Committee member Chen Yun, the man
 generally credited with the final say over China's
 broad economic policy. Yao is probably the best
 educated among the top four, having studied at
 Qinghua University during the 1930s (he reportedly
 was expelled for political activism). As a career
 economic bureaucrat, Yao in our judgment is less
 important as a potential rival for Hu's job than a

 logical candidate to succeed Chen Yun as China's
 leading economic policy maker. His area of particular
 responsibility appears to be central economic planning
 and finance. Politically cautious, Yao is a seasoned
 official who will play a key role in any successor
 regime.
 Chen Pixian's background and career associations
 mark him as a leader worth watching, though he is
 not well known. His career includes a period as a
 senior official in the Communist Youth League, and
 he therefore is often presumed to be an associate of
 Hu Yaobang. US Embassy contacts in Hubei, where
 Chen served as first secretary before his assignment to
 Beijing, claim he has close personal relations with
 Deng Xiaoping dating from the 1930s. Chen has often
 shared the dais with Peng Zhen at public security
 conferences and has shown something, of Peng's hard-
 line inclinations. Chen's experience as party chief of
 Shanghai during the Cultural Revolution was similar
 to Peng's trials in Beijing. Both men fell early in the
 campaign, and both were rehabilitated long after
 Mao's death. Like Zhao and Wan, Chen was consid-
 ered a promising young leader before the Cultural
 Revolution. His supervision of the crucial public
 security apparatus, despite having little experience in
 that field, is an indication of the trust he enjoys within
 the leadership.

 Secret
 The relationship between the top four and Hu Yao-
 bang is a topic for speculation. As the presiding
 officer of the party Secretariat, Hu has worked closely
 with all four, three of whom are members of that body
 and the fourth, Zhao, a de facto member who report-
 edly presides in Hu's absence. The views of Hu, Zhao,
 and Wan appear close, especially on economic policy.
 occupied the top party and state posts, there has been
 no convincing evidence of a personal rivalry between
 them. The same may be said of Hu's relations with
 Wan, another Deng protege.
 None of the four can at first glance be labeled an
 enemy of policy continuity. Zhao, Wan, and Yao-
 together with Hu-are more closely identified with
 China's current policies than any other top leaders.
 Chen Pixian's outlook, however, appears more provin-
 cial than the others. When the opportunity has pre-
 sented itself, Chen has taken a vocal and consistently
 hardline position on social issues such as street crime
 and the challenge of "bourgeois liberalism." Although
 as a member of the Secretariat he is generally
 associated with the party's reform wing, Chen's tough
 attitude may make him receptive to future overtures
 from leaders bent on curtailing reformist policies.
 The Second Circle. Included in the second circle are
 prospective leaders who in our estimation are regard-
 ed in Beijing as "comers"-such as Hu Qili--or who
 will play substantial roles in the post-Deng Xiaoping
 leadership-such as Qin Jiwei. Also included are
 political anomalies or puzzles such as Li Desheng and
 Gu Mu, whose standing (and allegiance) is ambiguous

 but whose potential to play a major role through the
 remainder of the decade is considerable. However, the
 five officials we have located within the second circle
 each lack some important qualification or have at
 least one significant blemish:
 ? Hu Qili, despite his de facto control of the party
 Secretariat as "permanent" secretary, is in our
 judgment too young and junior in standing to be
 considered a colleague by party veterans who are 15
 to 25 years his senior. Hu's close career ties to Hu
 Yaobang (he is regarded as "the successor's succes-
 sor") and ardent advocacy of reform strongly sug-
 gest to us that he will rise or fall with his mentor.
 ? Three others, Li Desheng, Qin Jiwei, and Zhang
 Tingfa, are career soldiers, albeit soldier-politicians,
 and that alone in our view will probably disqualify
 them from consideration for the highest party post.
 Since the differentiation of civilian from military
 leaders in the early 1950s, China has not had a
 leader who successfully traded a top military post
 for civilian leadership.'
 ? The fifth, Gu Mu, who in every other detail satisfies
 the key criteria, may be hindered by his political
 record, which apparently was tarnished in a dispute
 over economic allocations during 1979-80, when Gu
 advocated a more orthodox heavy industry focus
 instead of the reformists' favored agriculture/ light
 industry emphasis.
 The second circle is, in a sense, a waiting room for
 entry to the upper stratum of the succession genera-
 tion. Any of the second-circle leaders can be drawn
 into the inner circle, and we judge that each could
 make a substantial contribution. Conversely, for
 someone like Gu Mu, who may be the only enemy of
 continuity within the second circle, the string may run
 out after Deng and the relative peace that he has
 imposed on national-level politics are gone.
 ' It seems certain that Deng has staked out for Qin, Zhang, and
 perhaps Li key roles in leading the Chinese military through the
 succession period. Younger than their fellow soldiers on the Polit-
 buro, these three are the only ones who actually command troops-
 all the others are in administrative or advisory positions. Politically,
 Li, Qin, and Zhang appear to have aligned themselves carefully
 with Deng and Hu.
 The Third Circle: Darkhorses. Among the dark-
 horses are promising "third-echelon" leaders with
 insufficient political experience to warrant placement
 closer to the center of the action. Others in this
 category are leaders who meet many of the criteria of
 suitability for the top party post but who have serious
 liabilities or are currently in political eclipse. In
 addition, several promising provincial officials appear
 on the brink of national prominence and merit inclu-
 sion within the third circle as remote possibilities:
 ? Secretariat alternate members Qiao Shi and Hao
 Jianxiu are third-echelon leaders put forward by the
 party as models for the future. Both are young and
 relatively unknown proteges of Hu Yaobang. Qiao
 has accumulated important experience and connec-
 tions in the party's foreign affairs, personnel, and
 administrative bureaucracies. Hao, although bu-
 reaucratically experienced, is a woman in a male-
 dominated political culture. She has been active
 mainly in areas the party considers suitable for
 women-textiles, youth work, and birth control.
 ? Tian Jiyun and Li Peng occupy no high positions
 within the party bureaucracy yet but are members
 of the Central Committee and are newly appointed
 vice premiers of growing importance. They appear
 to have substantial connections within the top lead-
 ership-Tian was part of Zhao Ziyang's team in
 Sichuan-and, because of their strong technical
 qualifications, they also have been publicly identi-
 fied as among the hope of China.
 The political careers of some once-promising officials
 are now in eclipse, but this may prove transitory. It is
 possible that the same intraleadership differences that
 led to their demotions, if reanimated, could create
 political openings for their return to national
 prominence:
 ? Deng Liqun, head of the Propaganda Department
 and member of the central Secretariat, appeared
 headed for a prominent post-Deng role but appar-
 ently has been blamed for pushing last year's

 Secret
 "spiritual pollution" campaign too far. He now
 appears to be a spent political force!
 ? The reasons for dropping Peng Chong from both the
 Politburo and Secretariat at the 12th Party Con-
 gress remain obscure, and only Hua Guofeng's
 plummet has been more precipitous. Once the secre-
 tary overseeing public security, Peng now plays only
 a peripheral role as a National People's Congress
 officer. Presumably he is "available" should Hu and
 his program lose steam.
 The party leadership appears to be grooming some
 provincial officials for national positions.' Among the
 more prominent are:
 ? Xiang Nan, 65, Fujian's first secretary, a youth
 league crony of Hu Yaobang whose transfer to
 Beijing and a high party post has long been ru-
 mored.
 ? Liang Buting, 63, Shandong's ranking secretary,
 another Hu associate who has served both in Beijing
 and in a variety of provincial assignments.
 ? Zhang Gensheng, about 60, permanent secretary of
 Jilin, who has worked for Zhao Ziyang in
 Guangzhou and served as vice minister of agricul-
 ture before being sent to the northeast.
 Hua Guofeng is alive and in Beijing,
 despite an apparent suicide attempt. Some Chinese
 officials believe Hua was treated shabbily by Deng
 and company, but, if Hua has strong defenders within
 the top leadership, they have not prevented the former
 chairman's slide into obscurity. He reportedly has
 heart disease, which may simply be a cover story for a
 ' Propagandists should not ordinarily expect to go too far in the
 Chinese system, however-theirs is a narrow expertise in compari-
 son with other leaders, who are more or less generalists. The post of
 Propaganda Department chief has the appearance of impressive
 power, but here, more than elsewhere, self-inflicted political
 wounds are an occupational hazard. Hu Yaobang occupied the post
 from 1978 to 1980, and some of his current problems have their
 genesis in that phase of his career.
 ' The party often assigns officials to lower administrative levels to
 give them "hands on" experience before bringing them to Beijing.
 It is noteworthy that three of the four occupants of the first circle
 and, if regional military command is admitted, four of the next five
 leaders-Politburo or Secretariat members all-have had substan-
 tial grooming at the local level. Thirteen of the current 27 Politburo
 members have served in regional posts and in most cases were
 more political ailment. Neither an orthodox Maoist
 nor fully sympathetic to Deng's program and a weak
 leader without a solid political constituency, Hua has
 at best a remote chance of returning to a high party
 post.
 The Importance of the Old Guard
 The Hierarchy of Veterans. Survey research 10 and
 historical precedent suggest that both mainland and
 Taiwan Chinese are disposed to think of political
 leadership not in terms of laws or public policy but as
 the firm guidance of one or a few strong leaders. The
 domination of the state and society by a. Leninist
 party, in which a few men make all important deci-
 sions, reinforces this inclination. In China, power
 within the party tends to gravitate toward the most
 experienced senior veterans who have developed the
 personal connections necessary to sustain a long politi-
 cal life.
 We believe that political power in China is structured
 in such a way that Hu Yaobang, although he holds
 the nominal top post, cannot in the short term easily
 slip into Deng's shoes and fill his pivotal role within
 the Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of the
 decisionmaking system. Within this six-man elite,
 Deng Xiaoping, the ultimate survivor, is first among
 equals. Although not a dictator, Deng is a formidable
 political tactician with an extensive network of sup-
 porters. In the immediate post-Mao era., Deng has
 served as the glue holding China's leadership together
 and on a reformist course. China's politics is dominat-
 ed by guanxi-simply, personal connections or
 "pull"-and Deng has the guanxi to get things done,
 to "deliver" where others cannot. Even his political
 opponents seem to regard Deng as a man of honor
 who keeps his end of a bargain. Few men outside the
 most senior leaders can approach the kind of support
 Deng routinely commands.

 Reintegrate the Chinese Polity: Problems of Authority and Conflict
 in Chinese Social Process," in Chinese Communist Politics in
 Action, A. Doak Barnett, editor (University of Washington Press,

 With Deng on the Standing Committee are Ye Jian-
 ying, Chen Yun, and Li Xiannian, leaders with
 similar stature and length of service to the party. Ye,
 at 86, is politically and physically incapacitated and is
 rumored to be near death. Chen and Li, although both
 ailing, may continue to play active roles in formulat-
 ing the broad guidelines of Chinese policy. In addi-
 tion, we believe that other veteran Politburo members
 such as Peng Zhen, Wang Zhen, and Yang Shangkun
 are in effect members of the Standing Committee and
 are consulted on all major questions. At the next rank

 of Politburo-level veterans, we include septuagenar-
 ians Xi Zhongxun, Hu Qiaomu, Yu Qiuli, and Song
 on the arrangements De'  has put in place.
 For a variety of reasons-not the least of which is a
 jealous preservation of their unique standing within
 the party-the elders seem to place an inordinate
 reliance on the collective wisdom and vision of their
 own generation. In our judgment, Hu Yaobang and
 Zhao Ziyang are regarded by their senior colleagues
 as distinctly junior members of the Standing Commit-
 tee." The two have been suitably deferential in their
 relations with the old guard, presumably recognizing
 that their standing after Deng's death is almost as
 dependent on their relations with the party elders as
 process perhaps more than once.
 The Elders as Brokers. For the immediate period
 following Deng's death, and not necessarily for the
 long run, we believe that Deng's generational peers
 have the power-prestige, guanxi, and bureaucratic
 connections-to decide the succession. At that time,
 each of the remaining old guard leaders will have
 chosen between allowing Hu to assume full authority
 or curtailing his powers by insisting on invoking their
 privileges of seniority. In our judgment, the majority
 of party elders are likely to close ranks, move down
 the pecking order of the gerontocracy, and look to a
 peer such as Li Xiannian or Peng Zhen for leadership.
 In making this choice, the old guard presumably
 would understand that they might have to repeat the

 red devil." He presumably shares much of the revolutionary

 mountable odds, the close relationship between the Army and the
 party, and self-reliance and the "Chinese road to socialism."F--

 Secret
 than the formal designation of a "first among equals":
 power may simply gravitate to Deng's perceived re-
 placement. The party elders would implicitly recog-
 nize the right of one of their number to have his say
 on the most important issues. A regime led by a
 member of the old guard would almost certainly be
 socially conservative but in our estimation would
 retain Deng's policies without abusing his accomplish-
 ments.
 The transfer of Deng's power to another party elder is
 not tantamount to rejecting Hu. Under such circum-
 stances, we believe it probable that Hu would contin-
 ue to serve roughly in his current capacity, presiding
 over rather than actually ruling the party. In our
 judgment, the veteran revolutionaries may seek to
 circumvent Hu's authority but, in the interests of
 stability, not to displace him.
 It is conceivable that a newly dominant party elder
 might seek to replace Hu as General Secretary with
 one of the potential rivals discussed above, such as
 Zhao Ziyang or Wan Li. This would be difficult to
 achieve without serious disruption of the political
 system, however, and we think it unlikely. Incumben-
 cy confers a certain legitimacy on Hu-after all,
 Deng Xiaoping needed nearly four years to unseat
 Hua Guofeng.
 Less Likely Options. Alternatively, the elder revolu-
 tionaries may choose to accept Deng's arrange-
 ments-and consequently Hu Yaobang-as a fait
 accompli and opt to throw their collective weight
 behind a true second-echelon succession. They may,
 for instance, leave the decision to the younger officials
 in the Politburo, Secretariat, and Central Committee,
 in which case we believe Hu has the clear edge: none
 of Hu's potential rivals is likely to challenge him
 without the strong backing of the veterans.
 By stepping aside, the old guard would be seen as
 voting for stability and continuity, values Deng has
 sought to institutionalize. But loss of official position,
 whether through retirement or demotion, has always
 implicitly entailed loss of status or face as well.
 Because the voluntary surrender of power is rare in
 China, particularly for a group, Hu presumably would
 have to grant concessions to the elders on a broad
 range of policy questions and protocol issues. Deng
 has been obliged to consult the elders closely and, in
 our judgment, Hu would be even more solicitous of
 their opinions. As a result, policy could become more
 conservative, deliberate, and dogmatic in the early
 stages of Hu's rule. As Hu consolidated his authority
 and the old guard died off, Hu's own preferences
 would become more evident.
 Far less likely is a post-Deng collective leadership,
 comprising an elder, Hu, and another younger leader.
 Practically, an openly and officially acknowledged
 collective leadership would suggest that a major seg-
 ment of the old guard had rejected Hu as party leader
 and believed his incumbency as General Secretary
 was untenable in the long run. We believe the post-
 Deng emplacement of a troika or other collective
 leadership group would set the stage for serious
 political infighting and attendant policy uncertainty.
 Modern China has no precedent for an enduring
 collective leadership among equals, and we would
 expect such a leadership to last only until a new
 pecking order was sorted out.
 Key Considerations
 It has become conventional wisdom that "the longer
 Deng lives, the better are Hu Yaobang's chances to
 succeed Deng." When Deng dies, or if he becomes
 incapacitated, analysts will be facing a. new problem.
 With no obvious cleavages or factionalization within
 the Politburo, trends, signs, and portents become
 important guides to forecasting. In assessing Hu's
 long-term prospects, we believe the following consid-
 erations will assume key significance.
 What is the state of personal relations at the top? We
 would expect everyone to look closely to personal and
 institutional interests, as political jockeying will have
 begun in earnest. Any sign of disagreement among the
 leading successors-Hu, Zhao, Wan, Yao, and
 Chen-probably would signify a problem for Hu
 rather than his potential rivals. The sudden return to
 prominence of a fallen darkhorse, such as Peng
 Chong, would indicate to us that Hu was in major
 difficulty.

 If Deng's death appears imminent, the way Hu
 handles himself immediately before may be crucial.
 Hu may continue his efforts to build bridges to party
 and military elders by deferring to his seniors on the
 Politburo and giving new assurances that he can
 become leader of the entire party, not just its reform
 wing. A sign that Hu was seeking to do so would be
 his taking the lead in touting party primacy, hitting
 control themes frequently, and perhaps even co-opting
 criticism of "bourgeois liberalism."

 How far has the party rectification progressed? Rec-
 tification policy has broad repercussions throughout
 the power structure. In a practical sense, Hu gains not

 from any rectification that results in the improvement
 of party performance. Any change in the attention
 given to this campaign will give a clue to Hu's
 Who else (besides Deng) is dead? Hu Yaobang's path

 What is the condition of the economy? A strong
 economy proceeding along lines established by Deng,
 Hu, and Zhao will bode well for Hu. Poor economic
 performance, whether caused by men or acts of
 nature, would provide openings for critics to carp at
 the economic policies of the leadership, and particu-
 larly the reformists.
 Where are the soldiers? When Deng leaves the scene,
 his military posts-chairman of both the party and
 state military commissions-will be vacant. In his
 effort to gather military support, Hu may seek to line
 up the chairmanship of the party commission, either
 for himself or for an ally in uniform. Because the
 position must be filled by a member of the Politburo
 Standing Committee, this may entail elevating a
 supporter of Hu to the top organ, which if accom-
 plished would itself be a sign of power.
 Estimating where the Politburo-level soldiers will
 stand is difficult.
 We believe,
 however, that Hu's problems are less with the Army
 than the party elders and that Hu can carry a
 majority of the senior soldier-politicians with him. We
 believe the key men in the succession period will be
 Military Commission Vice Chairman Yang Shang-
 kun, Chief of General Staff Yang Dezhi, General
 Political Department Director Yu Qiuli, and the three
 second-circle soldier-politicians.
 Short of violence, the soldier-politicians can-and
 more likely will-wield their maximum influence by
 playing within the rules of the game. In the succession
 jockeying, civilian leaders will cast about for support
 from the principal soldier-politicians: the career sol-
 diers by themselves account for approximately a third
 of the total Politburo membership. Neither can we
 rule out an attempt by the senior officers to aggregate
 their political resources behind a single favorite candi-
 date. Faced with a united military front and an
 implicit threat of violent military intervention, civilian
 leaders could be cowed into submission while the
 soldiers broker the process.
 Calling the Succession
 Despite the power of the old guard, Hu's long-term
 prospects should not be underestimated: he is a skilled
 political combatant with significant support in all
 sectors of the bureaucracy. If opposed following
 Deng's death, he may concentrate his attention first
 on the potential rivals, attempting to "buy them off"
 or discredit them in some way. Hu's limited influence
 within the Chinese military would make his task more
 difficult if the potential rival were a soldier-politician.
 We believe, however, that party elders would be
 reluctant to drag the Army into the matter and thus
 contradict their post-Mao efforts to politically disarm
 the officers.
 As succession unfolds in the immediate aftermath of
 Deng's departure, the party elders will be at their
 maximum influence. The interests of the successors,
 Hu and Zhao, appear best served by continuing to
 defer to the veteran revolutionaries, content that time
 will ultimately redress the generational imbalance at
 the top. Among the senior leaders, Li Xiannian, Peng
 Zhen, Wang Zhen, and Yang Shangkun will probably
 be the key actors, and, in the short term, one of them
 is likely to assume Deng's key functions.
 Having presumed that the old guard is pivotal and
 will probably opt for one of its own, we believe that, of
 all the leaders of China's second echelon, Hu Yao-
 bang remains the strongest candidate to eventually
 lead the Chinese Communist Party through the
 1980s. He still enjoys Deng's strong support, the
 principal advantage over any potential rival. More-
 over, Hu continues to consolidate his grip in the party
 bureaucracy: known supporters have been named as
 Presiding Secretary of the Secretariat, and heads of
 the Organization Department, the General Office,
 and the International Liaison Department. He has
 emerged from the politically threatening campaign
 against "spiritual pollution" in a strengthened posi-
 tion and shows increasing confidence in the conduct of
 his office. In our view, any power arrangement in the
 post-Deng succession will include a substantial role
 for Hu as General Secretary. The potential "rivals"
 discussed in this assessment will probably become the
 "peers," the eventual core of the post-Deng leader-
 ship.
 Should Hu falter, his logical replacement is either
 Zhao Ziyang or Wan Li. Both are strongly backed
 and well positioned to assume command of the party.

 In our view, Zhao has carved for himself a comfort-

 if things were going smoothly for Hu, Zhao would
 mount a challenge for party primacy. We are less

 Deng Xiaoping and Peng Zhen. Peng, the "grinning

 of general secretary, has the independent standing
 and authority within the party to try for Deng's role
 as first among equals, perhaps even over the objec-
 tions of Deng's chosen successors. He in turn may
 work to advance the prospects of another younger
 leader, perhaps Wan.
 A number of other outcomes-premised on the break-
 down of existent succession plans and a failure of
 consensus-generating mechanisms in a post-Deng Po-
 litburo-also bear consideration.
 throw the decision to the full Central Committee,
 where their odds would be much better. 12
 A successors' coup would have a greater chance of
 success if the ranks of second-echelon leaders could be
 increased on the Politburo, and especially its Standing
 Committee, before Deng's death. It is probable that
 the Standing Committee will soon lose Ye Jianying
 and Chen Yun. Measures such as the appointment of
 younger leaders to the Standing Committee and the
 Politburo would create conditions and a sense of
 momentum that might impel younger leaders to take
 a risk in the post-Deng era. If the elders were truly  25X1
 disposed to fight against Hu's consolidation of power,
 they presumably will insist on maintaining the gener-
 ational imbalance on the Standing Committee by                                                                                        25X1
 securing places for themselves.
 The Gun Commands the Party. We believe an armed
 coup is an extremely remote possibility. Under condi-
 tions of escalating social disorder following Deng's
 death, the Army might be called on to control vio-
 lence. In our view, however, China's senior military
 leaders would not otherwise dare to order their troops
 to "storm the palace" should the post-Deng team not
 suit them. Moreover, the system of political controls
 that penetrates the military structure at every level is
 specifically designed to alert the civilian party of
 putschist activity. Nonetheless, it is clear from the
 customary caution with which civilian leaders handle
 the military that, from Deng on down, they are wary
 of the Army and perhaps believe that a well-placed,
 well-organized group of armed conspirators could
 gain military control of China.
 Coup of the Successors. The successor generation, led
 by their most prominent representatives, Hu and
 Zhao, may decide to take matters into their own
 hands, ignore the old guard, and attempt immediately
 to consolidate the succession for themselves. This
 course entails unified action by the second-echelon
 leaders and to us seems both risky and unwarranted-
 by actuarial odds, the younger leaders will be in full
 charge in fairly short order. There are, however,
 several possible mechanisms they might employ to
 effect a "coup." If it came to a vote of confidence in
 the Politburo, Hu and Zhao would probably lose to
 the old guard bloc. It is conceivable that they would
 attempt to stack an expanded Politburo session or to
 25X1
 We judge that the key soldier-politicians would be
 unlikely to support a purge of the old guard. The
 political influence of the officers is very much depend-
 ent on the party elders. Nor would the successor
 generation itself, unless gravely threatened, be dis-
 posed to forcibly kick out the revered "veteran revolu-
 tionaries."                                      25X1
 The Left Resurgent. If it is presumed that Deng, by
 the sheer force of his personality and political connec-
 tions, has been able to suppress the recrudescence of
 Cultural Revolution-style leftism, his death may,
 under some circumstances, presage an attempt by
 more orthodox Maoists to recapture political leader-
 ship. However, few members of the current Politburo
 or Secretariat would be likely to lead or even support
 a "leftist" resurgence, and its ostensible constituency 25X1
 within the 12th Central Committee is virtually nonex-
 istent.
 We believe that Chinese leftists-though numerous at
 lower levels-will have few opportunities to undertake
 the political offensive. The Cultural Revolution and
 the policies it spawned are abhorred by most Chinese.
 The current party, state, and military structures are
 heavily populated with officials who were persecuted
 during that period and who would sternly resist a
 return to its policies or leaders.                  25X1
 " In 1958, by appealing over the heads of his Presidium colleagues
 to the Soviet Central Committee, Khrushchev managed to retain
 his post as general secretary. We do not believe the Chinese
 leadership would throw the post of party general secretary to an
 "open convention," but this procedure must be considered a
