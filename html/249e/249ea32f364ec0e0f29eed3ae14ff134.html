Putting Down 
By CiEenciE MELLOAN 
When the United States mined North Viet-
'nam's harbors last spring, putting several 
Russian ships in some jeopardy, a key ques-
tion was whether Russian leaders would call 
off their May summit meeting with. President 
Nixon. 
The fact that they did not suggested that 
the Soviet leaders wanted the summit badly 
enough to ignore the mining, after some rela-
tively mild protestations. What was not so 
well known was why. 
' The Soviet leaders were presumed to be 
concerned about the U.S. overtures toward 
Russia's big neighbor, China. Leonid Brezh-
'ley also was said to yearn for a place in his-
tory as a peacemaker.' 
These speculations may have had some va-
lidity but hindsight now suggests another rea-
son which could Well have been the most im-
portant of all: The Soviet leaders may have 
wante.d the summit for the simplest of all pos-
sible reasons?the knowledge that they would 
need 'U.S. food to tide them over an impend-
ing crop failure. This interpretation offers 
somewhat less promise for future improve-
ment in U.S.-Soviet relations than did some of 
the earlier appraisals. Also, some of the ear-
lier, hopeful interpretations have been tar-
nished by a post-summit wave of official re-
pression inside the Soviet Union. 
The Polities of Food 
Well-fed Americans can easily underesti-
'mate the importance that food production has 
for a Soviet regime. That nation of some 240 
million people seldom has a comfortable mar-
?gin of food production, and agricultural fail-
-tire and political turmoil have been closely 
linked throughout Russian history. Starvation 
and violent repression went hand in hand in 
the Stalinist 1030s. Nikita Khrushchev was 
blamed for the 1903 crop failures when he was 
toppled in 1964. No Soviet regime?or for that 
matter any regime anywhere?feels comfort-
able with, hunger. And with the Canadian and 
Australian grain crops heavily committed, 
the Russians may have foreseen that the U.S. 
might be their only certain source for very 
large prospective needs. 
Now that $1. billion in U.S. grain has bailed 
the Soviet leaders out of their immediate food 
difficulties, another question arises: Could 
Nixon, Kissinger & Co. have driven a far 
harder bargain, not only on grain but on the 
more important issue of strategic arms limi-
tation? Could they have gotten stronger So-
viet support far a Vietnam peace settlement? 
And a further question, from a few Ameri-
cans who have contacts with the Russian po-
litical underground?could President Nixon 
have used his advantage (which they claim 
-was substantial) to relieve some of the bur-
dens of the Russian people? 
There is no simple answer to these ques-
tions, hilt, as a starting point, it is unlikely 
. that the Nixon team knew as much as the 
' Russians knew in May of the difficulties that 
would eventually wipe out some 30% of this 
year's Russian grain crops, according to pres-
. . . . ? ' lieved. .

issent in 
eat estimates. U.S. weather satellites can 
monitor growing conditions in the Soviet 
Union and other satellite devices may offer 
even more precise means for monitoring So-
Viet crops. But satellites cannot measure such 
problems as bureaucratic bungling, tractor 
parts shortages or footdragging among dis-
contented farm workers. Further, there were 
expectations until very recently that a good 
spring wheat harvest in the virgin lands of 
Central Asia would offset some of the crop 
losses that occurred earlier this year in the 
Ukraine. But only in recent days has it be-
come evident that an early rain and snowfall 
will diminish the virgin lands crops as well. 
A case could be made that a tougher U.S. 
stance at the summit would eventually have 
exposed the weakness of the Soviet. position. 
But it should be kept in mind that President 
Nixon's bargaining position was riot rock solid 
either. He was under strong election year 
pressure from war critics; he needed some-
thing to placate restive farmers. 
While it is not entirely idle to hash over the 
questions of what might have been, the really 
Important issue is what might still be in the 
U.S.-Soviet relationship. And to answer that 
question an examination of the 'Soviet Union's 
internal political situation is of some value. 
The .salient fact is that the Soviet people 
appear to be experiencing a new wave of offi-
cial repression which got underway last win-
ter but has become particularly severe since 
the summit. 
Communist Party idealogue Mikhail A. 
Suslov, who had delivered the coup de grace 
to Khrushchev's era in 1964, helped launch the 
post-summit offensive. Ile declared that the 
West was seeking to "implant in our society 
poisonous seeds? which he described in some 
detail in that special language of the Soviet 
catechism. 
Some of the repressive measures have 
made the world press. For example, Pyittr 
Yakir, a 49-year-old historian who has been a 
prominent champion of civil rights, was jailed 
in late June for allegedly passing "anti-Soviet 
propaganda" to Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty. And., of course, the August 3 
edict by the Soviet government, requiring pro-
spective emigrants to pay an expensive head 
tax before being allowed to leave, represented 
a significant hardening of the official position 
towards Soviet Jews seeking to emigrate to 
Israel and other lands. 
Other measures are described by Ameri-
cans who have been in recent touch with Rus-
sian dissidents. They say that closer restric-
tions on travelers, both foreign and Russian, 
were applied in June, with five-day limits 
placed on visits by foreigners to some cities 
and closer questioning of travelers about who 
they planned to talk with or visit. 
According to these reports there also have 
been numerous arrests of dissidents in the 
more restive non-Russian republics, particu-
larly the Ukraine and Lithuania. And a purge 
of the Communist Party appeared to be in the 
works in June with a demand that members 
must turn in their party cards so that mem-
bership could be reviewed and new cards is-
sued. One party directive complained that too 
many party members were being seen in 
church. 
A few dissidents have simply been ex-
pelled from the country. One of them, who 
prefers not to be identified, said recently in a 
private interview with an American that he 
regards the present situation as more serious 
and ominous than anything that has hap-
pened since Stalin. "The prisons are filling 
and the mental asylums are overflowing," he 
is quoted as saying by his interviewer. "All 
my friends are now in prison or have served 
time or they are passing time in mental asy-
lums.'' 
A Struggle for Power? 
The interpretation this young man places 
on the events he describes is that the KGB, 
the Soviet Union's security police organiza-
tion, has grown in strength and is vying ac-
tively for political power with both the party 
and the military. It is demonstrating its 
power not only through a Stalinist style crack-
down on dissidents hut in other ways, ho 
claims. Last autumn, for example, the KGB 
incorporated into its ranks the regular police, 
or militia, which handles routine police work 
such as. arresting drunks or breaking up 
fights. Further, the KGB has been conducting 
an active recruiting pro,gram in factories and 
is having more success at its recruiting than 
is the Konsomol, or youth branch of the party. 
The reports of ekpelled dissidents nor-
mally have a high emotional content and thus 
such judgments must be regarded with sonic 
skepticism. But- such sources sometimes are 
in a better position to know and report what is 
really happening inside the Soviet Union than 
Western journalists, whose contacts and ac-
tivities are restricted and monitored with 
some efficiency. 
If nothing else, the reports serve to remind 
Westerners that the Soviet Union is not really 
a monolith. Popular disaffection towards the 
government is widespread. Ethnic conflicts 
between the predominant Russians and such 
national groups as the Ukrainians, Georgians, 
Tatars, Uzbeks, Lithuanians and others smol-
der just below the surface. Ukrainian nation-
alism, which has been flaring up in recent 
years, might even have had something to do 
with the harvest difficulties. 
The ;population. is kept under control 
through government administration of travel 
and residence permits, job assignments and 
? the various other levels that stem from near-
total government control of the nation's eco-
nomic life. Ultimately, of course, there is the 
secret pollee. 
Events have shown that this type of politi-
cal system is never as stable as it sometimes 
seems to those on the outside who know noth-
ing of its internal tensions and stresses. It 
may well be true that a struggle is taking 
place between the party and the KGB. There 
is a historical precedent. Only tile quick, conn 
bined action of Politboro party stalwarts pre-
vented Secret Police Chief Lavrenti Bevis 
from seizing power after the death of Stalin:

cess 'when the interests of the 
corporation so demand.'' 
We can confidently expect. on 
the basis of past experience, that 
the shift in funding o Congress 
will not affect Radio Free Eu- - 
rope's outlook. In fact, the Free 
Ettrnpe Inc,? board of directors 
used to 'rely .on RFE's Munich 
headquarters in the past to carry 
through 'the basic subversion and 
espionage for which it was or-
ganized. ? . 
"Trust and confidence in REF.','s 
management and procedures" 
formed the basis of the relation-
. 
ship. - . 
The degree of -confidence of 
. the Central Intelligence Agency. 
and the Free Europe Inc. board 
of directors in their West Ger-
.man headquarters was evident in 
? the fact that. a the Library of 
Congress study puts it. "Radio 
Free Europe management in Mu-
nich enjoys a near-total autonomy 
- in decision-making" "in the con-
duct of its daily broadcasts." 
Radio Liberty enjoyed a 
simi-
lar degree of independence. 
"It seems to have a wide range 
1. of independence from the Execu-
tive Branch," "its operating poli-
-des seem to he generated _with-
in the organization and not neces-
l?-'sarily dictated by an outside au-
thority"---like the CIA?accord-
ing to the Library of Congress. 
This independence did not in-
vite divergence. Rather, Radio Li-
berty's independence was based 
on its having the same anti-social-
ist, . anti-Soviet, espionage ob-
jectives as it "sponsor," the CIA.

and with CIA funding' under a

The funding has been, shifted, 
from the CIA to. Congress, but 
there is no evidence that the poli-

The International Olympic Committee has responded 
?to. the demands of the Supreme African Sports Council 
that racist Rhodesia be barred from competing at the 
Munich Games by ruling that the Rhodesian athletes 
can compete . . . but as British subjects. . -? 
The controversy over Rhodesia's participation threatened to throW 
.a huge monkey wrench into the Olympics at Munich later this month. 
Independent African nations threatened to boycott the Games and, 
the Supreme Council issued a call for others to follow suit. Rhode--
sia'.s whi_te minority racist regime is 'an international outlaw, not 
recognized`by the United Nations. 
But the organizers of the Munich Games invited the Rhodesians 
? .to participate as a sovereign state, arousing a storm of protest from 
foes of racism the world over. ? 
The compromise worked out by the lOC hs been accepted by 
the Supreme Council, according to a UPI report from Munich. jean-
:Claude Ganga, general secretary of the African group, is quoted. as 
saying?that the Supreme Council has accepted the IOC's guarantee 
that the Rhodesians would participate as "Southern Rhodesia", and 
Its athletes identified as "British subjects." 
In other Olympic news, .the German Democratic Republic has 
announced that it is sending a total of 324 athletes to Munich for the 
- Games, competing in 17 of the 21 Olympic events. . 
. There is special importance to this news, for the games at Mh-
nich,?in the Federal Republic of Germany, will mark the first time 
that a team from the GDR will compete in an Olympics?on absolute-
ly equal footing with other nations. 
For the first time in the summer games the athletes will com-
pete under the rightful name of the GDR. under the emblem of the 
: socialist state, the national flag and the national anthem of their 
country. ? 
? At a press conference this week in Berlin, GDR, Dr. Heinz 
Schoebel, president of the GDR National Olympic Committee, hailed 
the significance of this victory and expressed the hope that the Mu-
nich organizers would. see to it that the rules are adhered to with-
out any disturbances. Munich. of course, is a hotbed of anti-socialist 
activities and neo-Nazism. It-is the home of two CIA radio stations 
from the U.S., Radio Pree Europe 'and Radio Liberty, and there is 
concern that these elements will attempt to disrupt the Games for 
their own foul purposes.

as an effort to head off future 
use by such ideological rivals - 
as the United States or China. 
of satellite relay systems to. 
beam television programs di-
rectly to the sets of . private 
Soviet viewers. 
Scientists have .written that 
transmission by satellite to 
home television screens is tech-
nically feasible, but such ? a. 
system has yet to be put in 
operation anywhere. 
The Soviet Union, which. 
seeks to control carefully the

Viet Hnion today proposed- an

vent nations from directing

The. 'Soviet press agency,

which was formally submitted 
by letter two days ago by For-

myko to Secretary General 
Waldlieim of th United -Na-

tionst 
Mr: Gromyko's letter request-
ed that the. Soviet proposal and 
draft convention be submitted' 
to the 27th General Assembly 
of the United Nations this fall. 
ACcording to the Soviet draft,

 Radio Liberty, Making reception 
quite difficult in heavily popu-
lated regions and major cities. 
Technically, it would be rela-
tively easy to jam satellite 
transmissions too. 
Soviet access to foreign 
newspapers is also tightly reg-
ulated. Only limited numbers of ? 
Western newspapers are per-
mitted into the country, for, 
purchase by resident or visiting 
foreigners, or for closely con-
trolled circulation to Soviet edi-
tors or other trusted members 
of the Establishment: 
Despite the jamming and the 
censorship, however, many Rus-
sians privately report that they 
listen of foreign broadcasts 
and, even now in Soviet Es-
tonia, private citizens can pick 
up Finnish television. But the 
Prospect that this practice 
might spread and reach the 
large majority of Soviet people 
evidently disturbs the Kremlin. 
Mr. Gromyko's covering let-
ter. aaid that the proposed con-
vention on satellite relays was 
"necessary to protect the 'sov-
ereignty of states against any 
outside interference and pre-
vent the turning of direct tele-
vision broadcasting into a 
source of international 'con-
flicts and agera.vation of rela-
tions between states." 
? Specifically, the Soviet pro-
posal would commit signatory 
nations not to transmit via 
satellites "materials propagan-
dizing ideas of war, militarism, 
Nazism, national and racial 
hatred and enmity between peo-
ples, and equally, material of 
immoral or provocative nature 
or otherwise aimed at interfer-
ence in internal affairs of other 
states or :their foreign policy." 
Among particular categories 
to be recognized as unlawful 
were programs "containing pro-
paganda of violence," horrors, 
pornography and. use of nar-
cotics" and thase "undermining 
the principles of local civiliza-
tion, culture, everyday life, tra-
dition and language," and those 
"representing misinformation of 
.1 
the population on that or other: 
questions." 
One article appeared to give 
countries the right to jam elec-
tronically satellite -relay trans-
missions and to interfere ac-
tively with foreign satellitess: 
used to relay objectionable ma-
terial. It granted them the righti 
to ."use measures within their: 
reach" to counteract unlawfuli 
transmissions "not only on their 
territory but in outer space and 
other places outside the bounds" 
of their own territory. ? 
Other provisions called for 
cooperation between nations on. 
technical matters as distribu-
tion of frequencies, elimination 
of interference with sea and. 
air transport, and copyright of; 
television broadcasts, 
The prominent publicity given 
the Soviet proposal in the con--
trolled media here today suggest 
that Moscow was planning a 
major campaign at the 'United 
Nations sessiion this fall for 
some restrictions on satellite-
relayed television broadcasts 
even if it had little hope for 
such a strict ban as the one 
proposed today.

Mr. BINGHAM, Mr. Speaker, inci-
dents of crime have increasingly marred 
the daily lives". of all Americans. Effec-

crime must be given the fullest attention

been the?formation of citizen groups to 
patra their own communities. 
have recently received a petition from 
New York City residents supporting 
H.R. 12262, the Citizen Anticrime Patrol 
Assistance Act which I originated and 
have introduced in the House, This legis-
lation would- provide Federal assistance 
to citizens' self-helli organizations for 
their efforts to curb crime and restore 
peace to neighborhoods. Such assistance 
could be used for the formation of crime 
wateh patrols and the coordination of 
escort services to help residents reach 
their hoes Safety. The assistance under 
tins bill is not intended to fight crime 
through the use of guns and strong-arm 
methods. Instead, it would deter the oc-
currences of crime by the interested pres-
ence of organized residents. I have pre-
viously provided a detailed description of 
the 'purposes and provisions of the Citi-

A FRESH LOON. AT RADIO LIBERTY 
AND RADIO FREE- EUROPE 
HON.. I1ENJAEIIN S. ROSENTHAL 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE or REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 7, 1972 
Mr. mosENTnAL, Mr. Speaker, I 
voted today to approve the interim ex-
tension of financing for -Radio Liberty 
and Radio Free Europe. I did this with 
some serious reservations about the wis-
dom of continued official American sup-
port for these stations which broadcast 
to the Soviet Union and to .the other 
eastern European countries, respectively. 
This reservation stems from the earlier 
clandestine American involvement in 
supporting these broadcasts, through the 
Central Intelligence Agency. With the 
exposure of that suppOrt, which was done 
without congressional authorization, 
must come a new status for these sta-
tions. Radio Liberty and Radio Free Eu-
rope should either continue to receive 
official American support under appro-
priate fiscal and policy controls?in 
which case they probably should be in-
corporated into Voice of America pro-
graming?or they should be fully inde-
pendent of official support and control. 
Giving mine support without public 
controls is wrong; duplicating Voice of 
America broadcasting. through Radio 
Free Europe and Radio Liberty is waste-
ful; and trying t& maintain the fiction 
that we Can officially fund private attacks 
on other governments while trying to 
imi?.?ove relations with those govern-
ments is foolish. 
I support this interim program with 
the understanding that the study of 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty 
which we authorize with that support 
will yield a prompt solution to the pres-
ent anomalous status of these. stations.

FDA BAN OF DES TARDY AND 
INADEQUATE 
? 1-10N. L. II. FOUNTAIN. 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 7, 1072 
Mr. FOUNTAIN. Mr. Speaker, last 
Wednesday the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration announced that it has taken ac-
tion to ban the use of diethylstilbestrol?
DES?as a growth stimulant in animal 
feeds. In explaining the basis for this 
action, FDA Commissioner Charles C. 
Edwards said that new scientific data 
developed by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture?USDA casts serious doubt 
on FDA's ability to set rules for the use 
of DES in animal feed that will assure 
against residues remaining in animal 
livers. Thus, the United States has now 
taken steps to join 21 other countries in 
banning the use of this cancer-promoting 
drug in tile production of meat. 
I am pleased that FDA has finally 
faced up to its responsibility for enforc-
ing the law, but this action is Jong over-
due. It was required many months ago 
when it became clearly evident that the 
use of DES in livestock feeding could 
hot be controlled. 
Although FDA has finally halted the 
manufacture of DES for feeding pur-
poses, I find it indefensible that Com-
missioner Edwards is permitting the con-
tinued shipment and use of feed mixes 
containing DES until January 1,1972. If 
the law re.quires FDA "to discontinue 
approval for use of the chemical in ani-
mal feed," as Commissioner Edwards 
sttited in his news release', I do not know 
the source of his legal authority for sanc-
tioning the continued interstate ship-
ment of DES mixes. Both the wisdom and 
the legality of permitting. a 5-month 
phaseout period for a product which 
can no longer be legally manufactured 
must be seriously questioned. There is 
no justification, in my opinion, for ex:-
posing the public another 5 months to 
drug. which is known to be a potent 
,/cancer-promoting substance and which 
FDA now acknowledges cannot be kept 
out of the liver we eat. 
The Commissioner's statement that. 
DES has been used in the feed of cattle 
and sheep for nearly two decades "with-
out a single known instance of human 
harm" is not very reassuring. As the 
Commissioner surely knows, it is virtually 
impossible to prove in this tune period 
that. small amounts of any carcinogen, 
no matter how potent, have harmed 
humans, because cancers in man may not 
'become apparent until decades after the 
exposure has taken place. 1,1-ore:iver, 
there is no available scientific method 
for demonstrating that a very widely 
used carcinogen, such as DES in livestock 
feed, is or is not the causative agent for 
any form of cancer which develops in 
man. 
What we do know is that DES, which 
has long been known to cause cancer in 
numerous species of experimental ani-
mals, was associated for the first time 
last year with human cancer. Medical

By EAII1 BERT 
? The Central intelligence Agency 
plays a cautious game with idea-
logy, and -ideological struggle, in 
deali-ng with the socialist world. 
For example, Radio Liberty, 
CIA's Soviet-oriented broadcast-
ing system, uses the formula, 
"ideologiCal irrelevance of Marx-
ism-Leninism." That is one of the 
t "practical themes" in the "im-
mediate objectives" which RI. 
pursues "within the larger frame-
work of goals and purposes." 
That's the way it's put in the Li-
brary Congress study of Radio 
Liberty. 
Marxism-Leninism. is the ern-
? bracing ideological superstruc-
ture of the socialist nations. It is 
: an instrument for political, eco-
? nomic and social development. 
The CIA considers it the better 
part of discretion, generally, to 
avoid a philosophical confrontation 
on this level. For one thing; what 
competing package would it pick, 
from philosophical wares offered 
. in Capitalism's ideology shop? 
For another thing, the experi-
ences of the Czechoslovak Spring 
in 1933 suggested that there are 
better alternatives. The socialism-
with-a-human-face slogan prey-
? ed to be very useful, in encour-
aging -anti-Sovietism?in the name 
of socialism. The Prague experi-
ence showed that a section of in-
tellectuals in the socialist world 
are suckers for empty declama-
tion. 
Under 'normal' circumstances, 
the CIA's Radio Liberty "as a 
matter of policy . . aoccpts all 
Soviet institutions though not its 
ideology."

The CIA's own "philosophy" 
might Le described as pragma-
tism or practicalism. It does not 
oven stick. to the "principled" 
position that Marxism-Leninism 
is "irrelevant." 
A different posture is adopted 
in the "cross reporting" format 
of Radio Free Europe, Under 
"cross reporting" technique Ra-
dio Free Europe reports "to each 
(socialist) country, developments 
in other East European countries, 
the USSR, and aniong Commu-
nist parties in the rest of the 
world."

17 a 
a context which implies that they 
are ideologically defensible." 
That is, the CIA's propaganda is 
presented here as not alien to 
Marxism-Leninism. 
It is presented as "politically. 
practicable (at least in the eyes 
of one Communist leadership" 
against another Communist Party 
leadership. The CIA seeks to 
"create hope and interest in the 
possibility of change." Finally, it 
"eraphasize(s) what East Euro-
peans have in common apart 
from (and in contrast to) the So-
viet Union." 
RL has a "philosophical ap-
proach." It "appeals to rational-
ism." It would have Soviet citi-
zens believe that its "rational 
approach' seeks to overcome the 
"monopoly over communications," 
whereas, what it has in mind, is 
warfare against Marxism-Lenin-
ism, and the political line of the 
Soviet Communist Party.. ' 
Radio Free EtIrOp, the CIA ' 
broadcasting, operation aimed at 
Buigaaia, Czacia)slovotitia, Hun-
gary, Poland and Romana, has 
pursued the campaign against 
Marxism-Leninisrn. in the guise of 
a defense of scientific advance.. 
The. "campaign for ideological 
purity" in "socialist societies'' 
has "always proven a hindrance 
to the improvement of living 
standards in keeping with the 
possibilities now available through 
technology," the Library of Con-
gress study of RYE says. 
The broadcasts beamed at Bul-
garia for example, concentrated 
on the following: 
"The neati for raore freedom of 
iuforrnatitahiDal:I-aria." 
"The need for less emphasis on 
ideological conformity and more 
on technical proficiency as job 
assignment and promotion crite-
ria." 
The target is in fact Marxism-
Leninism, the underlying philo-
Oophy of the Communist parties, 
and of the socialist states. 
The attempt to undermine Marx-
- ism-Leninism is undertaken in-
directly. The attack is carried 
on by decrying agreement with 
Marxism-Leninism as "conform-
ity;" but even that is treated 
gingerly, RFE-CIA recommend-

Gerade an dem Fall Maison Lafitte 
laBt sich emeut der geradezu naht-
lose ebergang von ideologischer Di-
version in hand feste Spionagetatig-
keit nachweisen. In standiger Ver-
bindung mit entsprechenden Stellen 
in M?nchen hat Maison Lafitte auch 
versucht, einen ?Kurieedienst nach 
Palen einz-urichten und dort Agenten-
gruppen aufzubauen. Kontaktrnanner 
versuchen besonders labile Studen-

dienplatze an amedkanischen Univer-

und Biihnenschaffende heran, dencn

Allerdings, einem Tell der amerika-
nischen Monopolherren, die ein paar 
hunderttausend Dollar an den ?Free

Auf dem Firmenschild am Eingarg

Schon wenige Tage darauf konnte 
Richardson dem Senator seine Dank-

Indizien dafar, daB die auch heute 
noch krampfhaft aufrechterhaltene 
Behauptung, ?Free Europe" sel ein 
privates, unabhangiges Unterneh-
men, ein aufgelegter Schwindel ist, 
gab es in Fillle, seitdem 1950 in 
Tag- und Nachtschichten linter Ein-
satz Hunderter US-Soldatcn der 
imposante Gebaudekomplex um 
MCinthfier Engligchen Qiruri ohne 
Racksicht auf Kosten mid Materia-
lien aus der Erde gestampft wurde. 
In den USA selbse gab es von An-
fang an eine Gruppe progressiver 
Politiker, die die Tatigkeit der Orga-
nisation ?Free Europe" und ihrer 
Hintermanner mit MiBtrauen ver-
folgten und die Frage aufwarfen, 
von welcher Seite die Subventionen 
liir dieses? fragwiirdige Unternehmen 
stammten. Die Kritik am Sender 
RFE schwoll Mitte der -sechziger 
Jahre derart an, daB der damalige 
Aufsichtsratsvorsitzende von Free 
Europe Incorporated, der bereits 
mehrfach erwahnte John Richardson 
jr., um den Fortbestand von RFE 
und seiner Gliederungen .zittern 
muBte. Schon damals war es kein 
beheimnis mehr, daB die CLA bei 
der Grandung des Senders Pate ge-
standen hatte und ?seitdem als wich-
tigster Geldgeber in E'rscheinung 
trat. Ganz unbefangen hatte die 
,,New York Times" (in ihrer Aus-
gabe vom 28. 4. 1966) geschricben: 
,,In M?nchen unteritiitzt die CIA 
verschiedene Forschungsgruppen und 
solche wichtigen Propagandakanale 
wie Radio Free Europe, das Pro-
gramme nach Osteuropa ausstrahlt." 
In .seiner Bedrangnis appellierte 
Richardson an den erzreaktionaren 
Senator Eastland aus 
einem ehemaligen Komplizen des 
Hexenjagers Joseph McCarthy und 
zur betreffenden Zeit Vorsitzender 
des ?Ausschusses fur innere Sicher-
belt", alles zu unternehmen, urn den 
Sender zu. retten. Denn ?Free 
Europe" ?' so hiell es in seinern 
Schreiben an Eastland ? ?ist in Frie-
denszeiten das einzige Mittel, mit 
dem man die strategisch wic.htigen 
Lander Osteuropas erreichen und be-
einflussen kann." 
Senator Eastland enttauschte nicht 
die in ihn gesetzten Erwartungen.

und ist dazu fibergegangen, dos Feuer 
der psychologischen Kriegsffihrung 
immer wieder auf ausgcsuchte Ob-
jekte zu konzentricren. 
Trotz dieser Selbstbescheidung kenn-
zeichnete Resignation den Grund-
tenor der ha Frahjahr 1961 abgehal-
tenen WEAC-Tagung, die sich mit 
der kiinftigen Strategic und Taktik 
FREE EUROPE's befaBte. Man

denn ?weder die inneren noth die 
Au&Ten Komponenten" ? so stellte 
man damals fest ? ?sind far cinen 
. Wandel im internationalcn Ge-
schehen gegcben". Also bleibt nichts 
fibrig, als auf der SteIlc zu tceten. 
Dicse Auslassungen sind in Jr:ehr-
fncher Hinsicht auBerordentlich be-
merkenswert: crstens, veil solche 
Oberlegungen auf ciner relativ reali-
stischen Einschatzung des internatio-

zweitens, veil daraus hervorgeht, da13 
der RFE-Ffihrungsstab nunmehr den

bci der Vorbercitung eines konter-
revolutionaren Putsches glaubt ver-

seits auf Gcdcih und Verderb an den

kauft haben. 
es 
Pudels Kern 
Selbstverstandlich flicIlt der Strom 
von Kommunikationcn in zwei Rich-
tungcn: RFE tritt nicht nur als Liefe-
rant von suloversivem Propaganda-
und Agitationsmatcrial und als Diri-
gent urnsturzlerischer Aktivitaten auf; 
RFE ist zuglcich Empfiinger von 
Informationen und Mittcilungen dar-
iiber, wo sich nach Ansicht ihrer 
Agenten im fraglichen Gcbict An-
knfipfungspunkte bieten. In dieser 
Weise stellt RFE eines der wichtig-
sten Zentren geheinadienstlicher Be-
tatigung irn globalen System der CIA 
dor. Sehr treffencl bemerkte der poi-
nisthe Kundschafter I lauptmann 
,Czechowicz nach seiner Ruckkchr in 
die Ilcimat auf ciner internationalen 
A ufgabe bctrachtet, die als ?wahre` , Pressckonferenz: ?Spionagedienst ist

ander verbunden, daB as nicht mag-
lich ist, die eine von der andern zu 
trennen." 
Nicht wenigcr aufschlul3reich ist, was 
auf der Tagung dcr WEAC John

Vorsitzender des Aufsichtsrates von 
Ftee Europe IncOporated ? fiber die 
Funktiont der Mfindmer Sendezen-

Offensichtlich hatte Mr. Richard-

? 1965 ? die Moglichkeit .soldier, 
vie cc as nennt, ?konstruktiver Vet--

gefaBt und als die aussichtsreichste 
Taktik zur Realisierung dieses Zicls

"One of the most extraordinary 
developments in recent years 
within the Soviet Union has been 
the emergence within of samiz-
dat, that is, the private publica-
tion and circulation of one's own 
works," the Library of Congress' 
study of Radio Liberty says. 
"Satnizdat" has been lauded as 
a cry for freedom from out the 
Russian wasteland by the New 
York Times, by "kremlinologists" 
and by other exponents of free-
dom: 
The ? reality is somewhat dif-
d-erent, as the Library of Congress 
study shows. ? 
Radio Liberty?the Central In-
telligence Agency broadcast di-
rected at the Soviet Union?has 
become a main depository for 
sarnizdat. 
Foreign correspondents are 
"one of the major channels of 
the flow" of samizdat, according 
to Peter Reddaway, a "Soviet 
specialist" at the London School 
of Economics. This has been evi-
dent in the dispatches -of the 
New York Times and other news-
paper correspondents. 
?In fact, "normally, samizdat 
documents are not sent specifi-
cally to RL from the Soviet 
Union. Most documents have been 
publicized elsewhere before RL 
gets them." 
The Library of Congress study 
emphasizes by repetition how 
important samizdat has become 
in RL's anti-Soviet barrage and 
how important IlL has become 
for the .dissemination of samiz-
dat. ? 
The study says:. 
Samizdat is "pi-esently the main 
staple of ItL's programming." 
"RL has become a prime source 
for uniting the disparate elements 
of Soviet samizdat producers . . 
a disseminator of all ' forms of 
samizdat from both the Russians 
and the (Soviet) nationalities. 
It is a "prime transmitter of 
samizdat." 
? Radio Liberty is a "prime bene-
ficiary of samizdat." -

The aim of the CIA in its op-
erations in the socialist countries 
in Europe, as distinct from the 
Soviet Union, is to separate them 
as a bloc from the USSR. 
That means rejecting measures 
which are aimed at creating con-
troversy among thorn, in favor 
of the greater goal of opposing 
all of them to the Soviet Union. 
That is how it was spelled out 
in September, 1936, by Ralph E. 
Walter, now director of the CIA's 
Radio Free Europe. 
The Library of Congress out-
lined this tactic in the study of 
Radio Free Europe which it pre-
pared for the Senate Foreign Re-
ia,tions -Committee. The study 
was published in the Congres-
sional Record of March 6.. 
The ideological line to be pro-
moted for separating the other 
socialist states from the Soviet 
Union is the Library of Congress 
study said: 
"Return Eastern Europe to Eu-
iope in the broadest sense." 
The CIA means by the "broad-
est sense" encouraging "growing 
ties between East and West Eur-
ope, indeed between the East 
and the Atlantic community." 
''The divorce of East and West 
has been unnatural and irration-
al," the CIA propagandists say. 
Soviet "security interests," not 
the interests of the other social- - 
1st nations, have been the cause 
of the divorce between East and 
West, they-add. 
By implication, the solidarity 
of the socialist camp is in the 
interest of Soviet "security," and 
not in the interest, from either a 
"security" or other viewpoint, 
of the other socialist nations. 
That was the line which was 
propagated, with considerable 
success .among, and by, the re-
visionists in Czechoslovakia pri-
or to 19:13. The "indepimdeuce" 
which they championed paral-
leled the separation from the So-
viet Union that the CIA propa-
gated. 
"The growth of nationalism 
may lead Eastern European 
states to distance themselves 
from the Soviet Union," the RFE 
said. R warned that, in encour-
n 9 t 
;ran by CIA CIA S -V1751.3:1'0 
aging nationalism, intra-bloc con-
flict should be restrained. 
The CIA warned that undue en-
couragement of nationalism could 
result not only in pitting "Hun-
garian against Russian, and Pole 
against Russian," but "Roman-
ian against Hungarian, Pole 
against 'German, and Czech 
against Pole." 
Radio Free Europe should try 
to replace the socialist solidar-
ity between the Soviet Union and 
the other socialist nations by 
non-class "neighbor to neighbor" 
relations, promoting so-called 
"normal state to state relations 
between the Soviet Union and 
those countries on her Western 
frontiers." 
The aim is the disruption of 
the international solidarity among 
the socialist states. 
However, this requires care. 
"It Would be unwise and dange-
rous for Western radio to advo-
cate enmity with the Soviet Un-
Ion." 
The policy lines of the CIA in-
cluded, as we have seen 
?Pitting the socialist countries 
as a bloc against the Soviet Un-
ion. . . 
?Resisting the promotion of 
nationalist controversy among 
the socialist countries. 
?Directing the socialist coun-
tries' political orientation West-
ward. 
A further tactic was the utili-
zation of developments in one 
socialist country to incite dissat-
isfaction in another socialist 
country. That was the purpose 
of the so-called "cross report-
ing" developed by CIA's Radio 
Free Europe. 
"Cross-reporting" is the chan-
nelling, of "developments in oth-
er East European countries, the 
USSR, and among Communist 
Parties in the rest of the world," 
to the five countries in REE's 
target range; Bulgaria, Czecho-
slovakia, Hungary, Poland and 
Romania. 
The purpose is to create dis-
sension, by one means or anoth-
er. 
The aim, as the report puts it; 
is: "to create hope and interest 
in the possibility of change and 
STATI NTL 
to emphasize what East Euro, 
peans have in common, -apart 
from (and in contrast to) the 
Soviet Union." 
The broadcasts directed to-
ward Czechoslovakia sought to 
use the two-nation character of 
the CSSR, which includes Czechs 
and Slovaks, as a wedge for dis-
sension. REE-CIA charged in 
1971 that not enough attention 
was being paid to the anniver-
sary of Czechoslovakia's Found-
ing Day, Oct. 28. It "quoted a 
book by a Yugoslav professor in 
Belgrade labeling Czechoslovak. 
federalism a sham. The profes-
sor viewed current trends in 
Czechoslovakia as toward the 
strengthening of centralism and 
the restriction of nationalities." 
At the. time the CIA was quot-
ing the Yugoslav professor's 
.book, the League of Yugoslav 
Communists and the Yugoslav 
government were rent by na-
tionalistic disruption. . 
CIA's REE- "contrasted" the 
Heath government's "positive 
move in joining the Common 
Market," with what it falsely 
described as the "stalemated" 
economies of the socialist coun-
tries associated with the Coun-
cil for Mutual Economic Assist-
ance. In this, CIA-RFE opposed 
not only the socialist countries 
but the trade union movement of 
Britain which unanimously op-
posed Britain's entry into the 
Common Market. 
As part of its continuing effort 
to aggravate differences in the 
ranks of the Communist and 
Workers' parties, LIFE "report-
ed a television panel, show- in 
Austria featuring prominent re-
form Communists who conclud-
ed that humanistic Marxism is 
the sole alternative to Soviet-type 
communism." These were the 
''reform Communists" who help-
ed bring Czechoslovakia to the 
brink of the anti-socialist abyss. 
.RFE "reviewed commentary 
by the Italian newspaper Corri-
ere dela Sera on Romania's skill-
ful and courageous foreign poli-
cies" which it suggested might 
be a "possible forerunner of cur-
rent East-West development."

?Wenn die Ungam noch diese Wodae

seine ungarischen HOrer gl:luben 
machen, eine militarische Interven-
tion der NATO-Machte und die 
Land ung amerikanischer Fallschirm-

So aufierte sich das FDP-Organ

Dec Sturm der EmpOrung in aller

hatte jedczn politischen Kabarett ge-
nagend Stoff zu einer bittersatiri-

Ein gewisser Herr Oncken, subalter-

liefede auch bereitwillig das Mate-

The nature of the Central In-
telligence Agency's infiltration 
into Soviet society is indicated 
by its avowed goal of the "liberali-
zation of Soviet society." That is 
how its Counterrevolutionary, anti-
socialist, anti-Soviet program is 
presented in the Library of Con-
gress study of Radio Liberty, the 
CIA's Munich-based vehicle for 
subversion. 
The study was prepared at the 
request of Senator J. W. Ful-
bright, as chairman of the Foreign 
Relations committee. It was pub-
liShed in the Congressional Re-
cord of March 6. 
? In this vein the Central Intelli-
gence Agency has expressed its 
concern, via RL, about the "seri-
ous institutional and ideological 
inadequacies" of the Soviet Union, 
about its "'serious economic pro-
? blems," the "most serious being 
the allocation of resources." 
"Within the larger framework 
of (its) goals and. purposes RI 
pursues immediate objectives," 
the Library of Congress study 
'points out. These "practical them-
es" include "democratic political 
alternatives, economic reform, 
peaceful intentions of the demo-
cratic world, ideological irrele-
vance of Marxism-Leninism, and 
the virtue of cultural diversity 
and political pluralism." 
The CIA's concern that social-
ism should flourish is also ex-
pressed over its other system 
of subversion by radio ? Radio 
Free Europe, which, like RL, is 
? based in Munich.

But even here the CIA is cau-
tious. Simply to attack defects in 
"implementation" is no assur-
ance of an audience, since the 
people in the socialist countries 
know, better than the CIA does, 
Nvha t their problems are. They 
criticize their own demerits the 
better to correct them. 
That is why CIA "criticism" 
is not "purely. negative." Instead, 
"valid achievements are given 
due credit" in order to offer, "in 
abundance," what pretend to be 
"alternative approaches" to what 
the CIA describes as "stagnated 
courses of action." 
The "general philosophical ap-
proach of RL is one that appeals 
to rationalism." The IlloCIA me-
thod of operation is, as the Lib-
rary of Congress study puts it: 
RI, "attempts to 'substitute reason 
for emotion, and a calm ?ioice 
for stridency.' it begins from the 
premise that 'the most convinc-
ing presentation is one which 
that tells all sides of a story." 
This philosophical approach , 
was not employed when Saigon

dent Ngo Diem, with the fore-
knowledge and probably inspira-
lion of the CIA; nor ftes it reflect 
the years-long murder policy ; 
carried out in Indochina by the 
CIA. ? 
Given peace in Vietnam, we 
can imagine the CIA resorting to e 
"rationalism" in its operations 
there; if not instead of assassi-

The targets for the Cent-al In-
telligence Agency's subversion 
campaigns in the socialist coun-
tries are "the power elite, either 
existing or in pbtential;:' that is, 
what the CIA hopes might become 
a new leadership group. 
That is how the Library of Con-
gress study of the CIA's two 
radio agencies puts it. The refer-
ence is explicitly to the methods 
of Radio Liberty, which is tar-
geted on the -Soviet Union; but 
it holds also for Radio Free Eu-
rope aimed at Bulgaria, Czecho-
slovakia, Hungary, Poland .and 
Romania. ... 
(The Library of Congress study 
was published in the Congression-
al Record on March G.) 
The Central Intelligence Agency 
.sees in "the forces of dissent 
and reformism" in the Soviet 
Union," in the "dissident move-
ment" (which is promoted also 
by the New York Times), "a 
challenging opportunity for stim-
ulating internal pressures for 
positive change." 
All of REE-CIA's five Broad-
cast Departments attempt to 
create, among engineers, scient-
ists and technicians, antagonism 
to the Communist Party. 
The CIA's Romanian broadcasts 
in the period surveyed for the 
Library of Congress studies were 
focused on aggravating differ-
ences between intellectuals and 
the Romanian Communist Party. 
It noted that the ideological cam-
paign of the Romanian Commu-
nist Party had ''been viewed with 
considerable alarm by both groups 
of Romanian intellectuals and by 
RFE's Romanian .Broadcasting 
Department." It looked forward, 
hopefully, to the possibility of a 
"cultural revolution in-Romania," 
as a result. 
A stickler for efficiency, the 
RFE-CIA criticized Romania, as 
it did Czechoslovakia, for being 
tardy with its formulation of eco-
nOrnic plans. 
To these ends Radio Liberty, 
in seeking a Soviet audience- ? 
"Lakes the stance of a 'patriotic. 
internal conAiptii.a6or ' tkat  
vea oPRetteasea01103/040:0C4ApRDIR804)1161:4R0011c00070001-5 
the bureaucracy." 
not a U.S. imperialist- or CIA 
agency. 
RL-CIA puts on the false face 
of a "genuine uncensored 'Home 
Service,'" seeking to "convey to 
the listener that RL is really one 
of thorn;'' appealing to the "prin-
ciples of common sense;" to 
"reason, moderation and ?good 
judgment.'' 
The CIA's Polish department 
presented itself as "an opposition 
press." bat "working for all prac-
tical purposes within the context 
of Poland's present socio-politi-
cal framework," that is, as a 
"socialist" CIA. To this end "the 
specific policy_with respect to-
-ward contemporary Poland is one 
(1,f neither attack nor support of 
the regime in tofu," but "reason-
ed discussion focused on all maj-
or developments  " 
This should be taken with a 
lump of salt, of course, for this 
"reasoned discussion" means at-
tack on the allegedly "inadequate 
and vague formulation of the pre-
Congress (Polish United Workers 
Party ? congress) guidelines on 
wages;" denunciation of the al-
le.i.edly "scandalous conditions in 
-i;n1r. licspaa Is ;" 
"police inactivity" in nailing 
tio.ders in '"geld and foreign Cur-
rencies" indicating that this meant 
"high-level corruption, possibly 
including the headquarters of the 
Ministry of the Interior." 
CIA zeroed in on the trade 
unions and the youth. also, de-
claring that "under Party bureau-
crats the trade unions had be-
come tools of the establishment;" 
and "questioning whether . . . 
proposed additional bureaucratic 
bodies could': Solve certain youth 
problems. It, urged, "construc-
tively," that more money, not 
new organization was needed to 
do this job. 
The major content of the FIFE-
CIA Poland-oriented broadcasts, 
during the survey period, was 
discussion of alleged differences 
within the Polish United Work-
ers Party, of party ?bureucracy." 
The lesson which RFE-CIA sought 
The key to this effort, the CIA 
said, was to be "freedom of the 
press" as the "only possible form 
of social control over the class 
of Party bureaucrats." The CIA 
soueht to convince its Polish 
listeners that such "social con-
trol" was the "only effective 
brake on their (the bureaucrats') 
. .? . pushing Poland to the bot-
tom and plunging the country in 
tragic stagnation." 
The CIA prOsented itself, in its 
RH; disguise, as the great cham-
pion of socialist economic pro-
gress in:Poland. 
RFE-CIA's Hungarian broad-
casts for the period under re-
view in the Library of Congress 
study "were weighted heavily" 
with economic subjects. Its gene-
ral line was to agree with the 
goals, but "criticize the tactics". 
employed by the government. 
The CIA agreed that the "twin 
problems of overinvestment and 
foreign 'trade deficits should be 
solved"?but "without either oyer-
exploitation of labor or curtailed 
productivity." it "emphasized 
the need to replace obsolete in-
dustrial machinery" as a "neces-
sary investment;" but "deplored 
the government's tendency to cut 
back" such investments as "waste-
ful and prof it cutting." 
The Hungarian broadcasts urg-
ed "more aid to private plot 
owners;" and help to "small 
farmers- (to) purchase directly 
badly-needed small farm machi-
nery."' 
The CIA "promised to try" to 
provide a "weekly adult educa-
tion course for Hungarian farm-
ers during the winter evenings 
when weather conditions make 
farm work impractical." 
The CIA even "made several 
suggestions as to how the many 
problems" of .-Ilungarian arti-
sans" could be aided by the gov-
ernment. 
To further its aim of appearing 
within, the socialist communities 
as a "home communicator," as 
a loyal opposition, as more con-
cerned with the progress of so-
to get across was the need for cialism than the Communist 
ments, the CIA has worked oi

By ERIK BERT 
The attempt to frame Angela 
/ Davis created problems for the 
V Central Intelligence Agency and, 
especially, for its Radio Free 
Europe network. RFE was at 
tempting to talk about "freedom" 
to an audience which was anxious 
about Angela Davis and protesting 
in her behalf. 
The Library of Congress study 
of Radio Free Europe, which was 
published in the Congressional 
Record on March 6, 1972, refers 
sketchily to the case. RFE-CIA 
"replied to official Czechoslovak 
propaganda... in the Angela Davis 
case," the Library's report said. 
FIFE-CIA's premise was that 
Angela Davis was guilty. That was 
what Nixon had said, that was 
what J. Edgar Hoover had said, 
that was what Governor Ronald 
Reagan had said; that was the 
CIA line, that's what CIA's RFE 
said. 
"Pointing out the facts of the 
crime," it indicated the "circum-
stances wherein the trial is open 
to the public." 
RFE-CIA referred to the fact 
. that the "USSR had been invited 
to send observers." The Soviet 
Union declined to take the bait 
which was intended to provide a 
cover for the intended conviction. 
RFE-CIA said the "Court 
agreed to a change of venue," 
when in fact the change of venue 
was won only after an intense and 
costly struggle. 
RFE-CIA cited, finally, that 
?Angela's sister remains free to 
travel and denounce the U.S." 
implying that the fact that Fania 
Davis Jordan- was not also being 
framed was a great tribute to 
capitalist democracy. 
RFE then asked, in conclusion, 
whether "such circumstances 
would be possible in the Czecho-
slovak Socialist Republic." 
One thing is sure, Angela Davis 
would not have faced life imprison-
ment in Czechoslovakia, as she did 
in California, for fighting for a 
nationally-oppressed minority, or 
against the imperialist war. 
One .of the key roles in this CIA 
attempt to prove to the Czecho-
slovak public that Angela was get-
ting _a fair trial for a. crinw .of 
whilAppkgygltforsRM4se 2001/03/04: CIA-RDP80-01601R001100070001-5 
played by one Slava Volny. He is 
one of the emcees on the rIFE-CIA 
broadcast directed to Czecho-
slovakia. 
Volny's last place of employ-
ment prior to joining the RFE-
jcia was Radio Prague where he 
was. a leading commentator in 
1963 avowing his devotion . to 
"freedom," "democratic social-
ism," and to "socialism with a 
human 'face." . 
_ - 
What is not clear from the Li-
brary of Congress study of RFE is 
whether Volny was recruited by 
the CIA prior to fleeing Prague 
for Munich, or subsequently. 
The problem which now faces 
the Central Intelligence Agency._ 
and its Radio Free Europe outlet 
is to explain why the San Jose jury 
acquitted Angela Davis. 
They had said she was guilty. 
They will probably say that her 
acquittal proves that there is jus-
tice for Blacks for Communists, 
and for Black Communists in the 
United States. 
They would still have to ex-
plain why President Nixon, FBI 
Director J. Edgar Hoover, Gover-
nor Ronald Reagan declared her 
guilty ? before a trial; why she 
was placed on the FBI's ten most-
wanted list, perilled by shoot-to-
kill cops, why she was compelled 
to spend 16 months in prison be-
cause she was refused bail before 
her trial.

.;The Senate Foreign Relations Committee showed 
!good judgment this week when it overruled its 
'6airman, Sen. J. William Fulbright (D-Ark.), and 
?koted to extend the life of Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty for at least another year. 
For months, Fulbright has been doing his best to 
. throttle Radio Liberty and RFE?which broadcast 
6 the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, respec-
:;tively?by blocking the relatively modest funds 
:peeded for their. operations. 
Now that ds eff.cirts have been repudiated by his 
?wn committee, it is taken for granted that both 
Uthorization and appropriations bills for the Mu-
:hich-based stations will get congressional approval. 
I Fulbright argues that the stations are a relic of 
the cold war and can only get in the way of better 
relations between this country and the Soviet 
,Union. There was a time, more than 15 years ago, 
NV)ieri his criticism might have had some validity. 
13ut that day is long past.

Important treaties and agreements signed by Pres-

Moscow summit.. . 
. The key function of RFE and Radio Liberty is 
not to broadcast American news or propaganda, 
but to give news of events in the Communist coun-
tries themselves. It is news which the people would 
not otherwise read or bear because their own me-
dia are so rigidly censored. 
? As the liberal British weekly, the Guardian, ob-
served not long ago, "Radio Liberty is providing an 
alternative free radio service for Russian listeners 
. . ? . it broadcasts back to Russia what the dis-
sident Russian' writers and intellectuals are pre-
vented from publishing in their own countries." 
It is significant that the severest criticism of 
? Fulbright!s crusade has come from within the 
iCommunist nations themselves. When dissident 
Soviet writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn heard of 
the attack against Radio LibertSi, he told Western 
newsmen that, "If we ever learn anything about 
what is going on in this country, it is through 
them." ? ?

to 3 yesterday to authorize 
$38,520 for Radio Free Europe

The sum was the amount 
sought by the Nixon adminis-

which broadcast news and 
opinion into Eastern Europe 
from transmitters in Western 
Europe. A move by Sen. Frank

U.S.. Asked to Aid' 
2 Radio Stations:
..? 
Supporters of Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty 
argued yesterday for full fi-
nancing by the U.S. govern-
ment for one more year while 
an effort is made to got West-
ern ,Europeans to share the 
,burden. 
The testimony came as the 
Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee opened hearings 
on a Nixon administration bill 
authorizing' $38.5 million to op-
erate the two radio stations in 
the year beginning July 1. 
The two stations, which up 
'to a year ago were financed, 
in the Main covertly by the 
Central Intelligence Agency, 
broadcast to Eastern Europe 
and the ? Soviet Union from 
Munich. 
Committee Chairman J. W. 
Fulbright (D-Ark.), who earlier 
this year succeeded in legislal-
ing an end to funding for the 
stations: as of June 30, ex-
pressed opposition to contin-
ued U.S. financing. 
Fulbright cited an "emerg-
ing spirit of cooperation and 
accommodation" between the 
United States and the Soviet 
Union, and an "apparent lack 
'of interest on the part of our 
European allies" in helping to 
finance the radio operations. 
The only witness to testify 
at the opening session, Dr. 
Dirk U. Stikker of the Nether-
lands, chairman of the West 
European Advisory Committee 
to RFE, acknowledged that "it 
is time for West Europeans to 
begin sharing the financial 
'burden." 
,f Stikker said the climate in 
,Western Europe is "clearly fa-
vorable to the continuation of 
Lthe radios and, by careful and 
patient handling, to the devel-
opment of a more active Euro-
pean participation." 
But he said development of 
such support will "require 
,long, hard work," and he said 
,"an appreciable European con-
tribution should not be ex-
pected to be available in the 
,next year.",. , 
Fulbright questioned Stik-
ker at length about the pros-
pect "of any tangible support 
from Europe." 
"Do you know of any gov-
ernment willing to pay any-
thing toward these radios?" 
Fulbright asked. Stikker said 
he knew of several "but it is 
all confidential." 
Stikker said supporters 
"cannot start a real organized 
effort to raise money in Eu-
rope" until Congress votes to 
continue the radios. 
Sens. Jacob Javits (R.N.y.) 
and Charles Percy (R-I11.) 
argued for a year's grace but, 
in Javits' words, "there will be 
a real obligation on the part 
of Europe to see that the year 
is not wasted." 
Fulbright said he didn't see 
any, assurance, lithe U.S. pro. 
vides funds for another year, 
that there would be action in 
Europe. He said the European 
attitude was more apt to be: 
"The Americans will continue 
to do it?they're big and rich 
and stupid."

bei Frankfurt am Main mit einem 
7,5-kW-Kurzwellensender die ersten 
Erfahrungen gesammelt. Dann, 1951, 
nahmen General Clays Plane Gestalt 
an, in M?nchen em n groBangelegtes 
Diversions- und Spionagezentrum in

stungsfahigen Sendeanlage (Gesarut-

recht batten die Amis cin 70 mal

fUr das Grundstikk eine durchaus 
andere Verwendung in Aussicht ge-

rische Verwaltung konnte lediglich 
die amerikanischen Gebieter zu dern 
Versprechen bewegen, den auf dem 
beschlagnahmten GrundstUck fr?her 
behndlichen Chinesischen Turm, dcr 
in den Kdegsjahren eingesairzt war, 
wieder aufzubauen. RADIO FREE

im ithertragenen Sinn &flint und 
seit der Abkchr der Mao-Clique von 
den Grundsatzen des Marxismus-
Leninismus in seinen Sendungen die

Im November 1951 kam dcr bereits 
erwahnte Charles Douglas Jackson, 
einer der wichtigsten Manner der 
Organisation ?Free Europe", eigens 
nach Munchen geflogen, um die in-
zwischen rekrutierten Mitarbeiter auf 
Vordermann zu bringen. Klipp und 
klar erklarte Jackson bei dieser Ge-
legenheit: ?Radio Freies Europa ist 
em n Dienst des psychologischen Krie-
ges. Unsere Organisation ist ge-

In dem ersten Werbeprospekt, den 
RADIO FREE EUROPE im selben 
Jahr, 1951, in den USA zirkulieren

des amerikanischen AuBenminister 
Dean Acheson verweisen, der dem

Im Herbst 1947 hatte eine Gruppe 
von Kongregabgeordneten eine 
Studienreise durch 22 Lander unter-
nommen, urn sich einen Oberblick 
fiber die Arbeit der amerikanischen 
Propagandaorganc im Ausland zu ver-
schaffen. Int Berliner Hauptquartier 
des US-Militargouverneurs Lucius D.

Erkundungsfahrten unternalimen, lie-

Ben sic sich litre crsten Untenveisun-

als unver;Olinlicher Fcind der Sowjet-

verschiedenen Maim dazu ent-
schlossen, den: kalten Krieg, in eincn 
heiBen SchieBkrieg zu verkehren mit 
dent Ziel, 
dcrungen na

in SUdost- und Osteuropa: wieder-
herzustellen, Eberzeugte seine Lands-
!cute davon, da f3 die von den offi-

triebene politische Propaganda vollig 
unzureichend und dahcr wirkungslos

land bestiannte subversive Propa-
ganda betreiben" konnen. 
Nadi ihrer Rilcickehr in die USA eat-
faltete die ?Studien"-Gruppe ameri-
kanischer Parlamentarier urn Saint 
und irn Reprasentantenhaus eine 
hektisdie Betriebsamkcit, um die 
Vorschlage General Clays popular zu 
mac.hen. Selbstverstandlidi wurdcn 
sic bci ihrem Vorgehen von einem 
steifen Ruckenwind aus maBgeben-
den Kreisen des State-Departments 
und des Kriegsministeriums begim-

geordneten ist auch die Einbringling 
und die in beiden Ihrusern des Kon-
grcsses kaum urnstrittene Annahme 
des Smith-Mundt-Gesetzes zurucirzu-
fiihren. Dicses Gesetz legte die 
staatsrechtlic.hen Bedingungen fur die 
GrUnclung und Unterhaltung privater 
Rundfunkanstalten fest, oder, andcrs 
ausgedruckt, es machte den Weg fur 
die Inbetriebnahme soldier Sende-
einrichtungen, vie sic RFE spriter 
darstellte, frci. Bemerkenswert ist, 
daB das Gesetz vorschrcibt, daB allc 
politischen Sendungen der als 
vate" Unternehmen aufgezogenen 
Rundfunkstationen'der Kontrolle der 
Regierung unterliegen. 
Der Annahme des Smith-Munck-Ge-
setzes folgte sogleich eine Serie von 
Geheimverhancllungen, bei dencn 
Vertreter des gerade damals sich un-
geheuer aufblahenden US-Spionage-
dienst entscheidend mitwirkten. Sic 
waren samtlich .darauf gerichtet,?der 
amerikanischen Propagandamaschine 
einen ,,New Look" zu geben, was 
damit crreicht werden sollte, (lag in 
Zukunft die Abteilung f?r psycholo-
gisdie Kriegsfahrung und die Ge-
heimdienstzentralc der CIA den To 
angeben sollten. 
Kerman schlug vor, eine Organisa-
tion auf die Beine zu stellen, in der 
politische Emigranten aus Osteuropa 
zu einer ?demokratischen Elite" zu-
sammengefailt warden. Kerman lieB 
dabci durchblicken, daB der darnalige 
amerikanische Augenminister Dean 
Atheson, bekannt als erner dcr 
aggressivsten Vertreter dee amerika-
nisch.en Atombombenpolitik in der 
Zeit des arnerikanischen Kernwaf-
fenmont:q>ols, solche Projclac mit

Kermans Empfehlung auf. 
Tin Mai 1949 zog cc einen alten

BRD-Nachrichtendienst (BND) an-
gewendet werden, um ?Fliichtlinge", 
von denen nicht wenige ihre Heimat 
infolge einer KurzschluBreaktion ver-
lassen haben, zu Agenten zu pressen. 
Czechowicz hat das am eigenen Leib 
erfahren. Bekanntlich hatte der heute 
35jahrige seine Mission 1962 auf-
genommen, nachdem en sich nach 
erfolgreicher Beendigung eines Ge-

einen Weg gewahlt, den abtriin-

Ram in einer Holzbaracke mit sic-
ben anderen Landsleuten, die dort 
bereits seit mehreren -Monaten fest-
gehalten wurden. Sic beklagten sich

Verzichtet man auf eine Zusammen-

wahlt stats dessert die Telefonnummer 
82 51 02 - die nicht im Telefonbuch 
steht, abet- vom wil3begierigen Repor-
ter herausgefunden wurde -, so hat 
man ein seltsames Erlebnis.. Klic.k - 
darauf spricht eine angenehm dunkle 
Frauenstimme vom Tonband: ?Guten

Dec unnachgiebige Reporter, dem es 
gelungen war, die Geheimnummer 
von INTORA herauszubekommen - 
sic wurde seitdem verandert -, gab 
sich indessen mit dieser Entdeckung 
nicht zufrieden. Er unternahm wei-
tere Erkundungen, um hinter das Gc-
hcimnis des mysteriosen Absatz- und 
Marktforschungsinstituts zu kommen. 
Da fiel ihm auf: Tag fur Tag bevor 
der Praha-Wien-ExpreB auf dem 
Wiener Bahnhof einlauft, erscheinen 
auf dem Bahnsteig immer wieder die-
selben undurchsichtigen Gestalten, 
denen trot krampfhafter Bemahung, 
nicht aufzufallen, innere Unruhe und 
Nervositat deutlich anzumerken sind. 
Rollt dam n der Zug in die Halle, ver-
teilen sic sich auf die einzelnen Wag-
gons, mustern mit prafenden Blicken 
die Aussteigcnden, um sich dann an 
&nen heranzumachen, der ihren Ab-
sichten dienlich sein konnte, und 
reden in tschechischer Sprache hastig 
auf ihn ein. Sic ergreifen mitunter 
auch seinen Koffer und weichen nicht 
von seiner Seite. 
Das alles geht in solcher Eile vor sich, 
daB Verwandte und Bekannte des 
13etreffenden gar nicht dazu kototnen, 
ihren Besuch in die Arme zu 
Ben, bevor noch der Fremde seine 
crsten ?markterforschenden" Kontakte 
herstellen konnte. Ehe er sich schlie13-

Gast aus Prag verstohlen einen klei-

ase 2001/03/04: CIA-RDP8

und Anschrift. Er sei ja em n Lands-
mann, v,-ie er sagt, der vor em n paar 
Jahren die Heimat aus rein person-
lichen Granden verlassen hatte. Wie 
es jetzt da wohl ausschauen wiirde? 
Das konnte man sich doch bei &nem 
gematlichen Plausch im Kaffeehaus 
erzahlen lassen. 
Ahnlithe Szenen konnte der Repor-
ter auch bei Ankunft des aus War-
thitr "acipie-Expret.c 
beobachten. Und nicht viel anders 
gcht es auf Wiens Flughafen zu, wenn 
die Maschinen der Cesko-Slovenske-
Air-Lines aufsetzen, oder am Donau-

Budapest anlegt.

die aufdringlic.hen Herren auf den

Chef Aigner stehen. Das sogenannte 
?Interview" ist &fin der nachste

arrangieren muB, der Treff mit dem 
?Landsmann".

Freilich, Chef Aigner ist seinen An-

die Interviews auch tatsac.hlich statt-
finden und nicht der Phantasie der 
Mitarbeiter entspringen, hat er die

--r---,ROM a Polish industrial town, 
H a laborer writes to Radio Free 
Europe: "You are the only 
so. urce of truth. If it weren't for you, 
we wouldn't know anything. Every-
' ? body listens to RFE." 
In Czechoslovakia, a young man 
risks arrest to write: "I have listened 
r. to RFE since I Was a child. Today I 
? am 22, and for most of what I know 
about the world I have you to thank. 
Your broadcasts have been my only 
window on the world." 
From the Soviet Union, a ?scien-
- tist secretly sends a message: "Radio 
.,Liberty is what a Russian station 
.? would be like if we had freedom of 
? speech." 
High praise, and all from behind 
? the Iron Curtain. Yet?surprisingly 
?in Washington, D.C., Sep. J. Wil-
? liam Fulbright (D., Ark:), chairman 
of the powerful Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee, takes a different 
.view. Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty, he charges, are "keeping 
? alive the animosities which grew up 
after World War II." Both statins, 
he says, should "take their rightful 
place in the graveyard of cold-war 
relics." 
"Source of truth" or "cold-war 
relics"?what are the facts about 
these two stations? 
In the Vernacular. After 'World 
War H, as the world watched, an 
Iron Curtain descended on Eastern 
.events which by 1950 had shut off 
roo million people in Eastern Europe 
and 200 million people in Russia 
from any free communication with 
. the West. 
Many concerned Americans, in 
and out of government, asked them-
selves how the West could 'respond. 
Should these people be abandoned, 
forgotten? The consensus was no: 
continuing contact was essential. 
And the best, most tireless vehicle 
was radio. 
Radio Free Europe went on the 
air in July 1950, broadcasting from 
Munich. From a modest begin ping, 
it expanded coverage to beam spot 
news, popular music, cultural pro-
grams and commentary an average 
of 16 hours a day to listeners in Po-
land, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, 
Rumania and Bulgaria?in their 
own language, by nationals who had 
fled their homeland. 
The founder?and current chair-
man ?of Radio Free Europe is 
Gen. Lucius D. Clay, whose ? ex-
periences with the Russians as post-
war commander of U.S. forces in 
Europe had demonstrated the need 
for such a voice of hope. He wanted 
RFE to be as much as possible out-
side the realm of government?
speaking to the people in their own 
vernacular?rather than a "national" 
service like the Voice of America or 
the BBC's Overseas Service. 
Europe. The Berlin blockade and. In March 1953, another American order of things, few Westerners can 
, the Soviet seizure of Czechoslovakia station began broadcasting from appreciate the impact of simple, fac-
werepart of the grim succession of Munich, direct to the Soviet Union. tual news reporting in the commu-
the two have evolvedvery similar 
philosophies. 
Both grew up in a world in which 
propaganda was the norm: a period 
of threat and counterthreat in an 
international atmosphere of raw ten-
sion. The staffs of the two stations, 
many of whom had fled communist 
,oppression, found it difficult to re-
;main cool and detached journalists. 
But in the relative thaw following 
? ? Stali0 death in 1953, Radio Liberty 
began modifying its stance of "im-
placable struggle?against the commu-
nist dictatorship until its complete 
!destruction." Increasingly, program-
?iming was directed not at toppling 
I the Kremlin leadership but at en-
lightening the people, giving them 
.the news?local as well as world-
wide?withheld from them by their 
own media, educating them to the 
democratic alternative, breaking 
through the distrust of the West. 
In the wake of the tragic, abortive 
Hungarian revolt in RFE was 
accused of abetting the Hungarian 
patriots' bloody resistance by, raising 
false hopes of U.S. intervention. 
? However, the West German govern-
ment, which licenses the two Amer-
ican stations, examined tapes of all 
the programming during the revolt 
and branded the charges as false. 
Over the years the stations have 
been characterized by, as one expert 
?puts it, "friendliness, enlightenment. 
dignity." journaliits around the 
world praise their restraint and ob-
? jectivity. Listeners agree. 
The communist regimes, Di 
Course, take a different view. ;tat 
minutes after Radio Liberty went 
on the air in 1953, Moscow began 
jamming it'?broadcasting nerve-
rack ing noise on the same wave-
length to drown out the signal. It 
has not stopped for a minute, and 
tens of millions of dollars a year are 
spent on the effort. RFE is still vig-
orously jammed in Czechoslovakia, 
'Poland and Bulgaria. 
Audience Appeal. Why do these 
stations enjoy the respect and popu-
larity that they do? 
They are, for the communist 
world, a surrogate fee press. Be-

By April Klimley 
Special to The Christian Science Monitor 
Taipei, Taiwan 
? Employees at the Taipei branch of Radio 
Liberty are worried that all U.S. congres-
sional appropriations for their work will 
end June 20. ? 
The station, which broadcasts in Russian 
to the 'U.S.S.R., came under attack this 
spring when Sen. J. W. Fulbright (D) of Ar-
kansas accused it of being "a relic of the 
? cold war." 
' Senator? Fulbright's remarks and budget

Radio Liberty's Taipei staff to face a re-

serves as a relay ptation to Siberia. The 
staff puts together a two-hour program 
each day based on scripts and tapes sent 
from Radio Liberty's 'Munich, Germany, 
'headquarters. 
The news is voiced by two Russian-lan-
guage native speakers in Taipei. Three 
,? transmitters send the program simultane-

quency beamed to? the Lake Baikal area 
? and the other two aimed at the maritime

'elude Soviet jamming. 
News .events followed ? ? 
Although the station emphasizes news 
from Eastern Europe and Russia, there is 
little blatant propaganda in the daily news-
casts. The excerpts from Western news-
paper editorials, which follow- the news 
frequently, do not even touch on subjects 
directly related to the U.S.S.R. 
The press review usually concentrates on 
the big news of the day, such as the in-
vasion of .South , Vietnam, and newspaper 
editorials express divergent views. The rest 
of the show is made up of taped commen-
taries on cultural, scientific, or politica) 
subjects. 
Employees of the station deny that their 
programs are propaganda. One source ex-
plained that things have changed since the 
days when the station called itself "Libera-
tion Radio" and encouraged people to ac-
tively oppose their government. 
After Western countries failed to respond 
to the Hungarian revolt of 1956, the station 
changed its name and began to aim at de-

'Books broadcast ? 
One way the station tries to do this 'is by 
broadcasting "samizdats," or self-publica-
tions, which . are unauthorized writings 
smuggled out of the U.S.S.R. They are read 
at dictation speed, chapter. by. chapter, so 
that listeners can make copies if they like. 
The station broadcast all of Alexander T. 
Solzhenitsyn's books this way, with the ex-
ception of his latest, which is yet to come. 
Mr. Solzhenitsyn himself has come to the 
defense of Radio Liberty. In early April he 
told a New York Times reporter that "if we 
hear anything about events in this country, 
it's through 'them." 
The station. transmitted Eugene Gins-
berg's book "Noontime" and .the court 
transcripts of the trial of the young poet 
Vladimir Bukousky. ? 
Recently the bureau has been broadcast-

every day. On April 26 it read his New York 
Times-interview defense against an attack 
made on the 'funeral lament he had given

"They frequently think of closing us down

that this lack of feedback is probably the 
result of the fact that mail from Siberia,

..The Americans and Russians 
may not alike everything they

the contacts have had the cu-
mulative effect of reducing ap-
prehension. 
As recently as 1959, when 
Mr. Nixon, then Vice Presi-
dent, went to the Soviet Union 
the first time, there was con-
siderable excitement and an air 
of adventure about his mission. 
"People had come to the air-

mystery, and even fear," Mr. 
Nixon wrote later in his book 
"Six Crises" about his depart-
ure from Baltimore's inter-
natinal airport for Moscow. 
Mr. Nixon recalled playing 
golf with William P. Rogers, 
then Attorney General and 
now Secretary of. State, just be-
fore that trip: 
The caddy was told that Mr. 
Nixon was flying to Moscow, 
and he exclaimed, according 
to the story: "Won't they shoot 
him down?' 
Mr. Nixon's mission in 1959 
was to open a large American 
exhibiton, which was dedicat-
ed to proving to Russians that 
Americans lived on a higher 
standard than they did. 
Coor tio N S It

? The  United States was con-

psychological effect caused by 
the Soviet lead in the spate

more sputniks in space, the 
United States had more wash-
ing machines on earth. Those 
were also the days when Niki-
ta S. Khrushchev Was threat-
ening to overtake the United 
States in economic growth and 
to "bury" capitalism. 
Over the years, the rhetoric 
has been deflated. Russian lead-
ers no longer talk of compe-
tition with the West but of co-
operation. The space race that 
cost both so much money will 
end if Mr. Nixon and Mr. Brezh-
nev announce plans for joint

docking in space by astronauts 
from the two countries in 1975.

arms. And it is hard to talk 
about an economic race, when 
American businessmen are be-
ing invited-to help develop Si-
beria's mineral wealth. ? 
This kind of cooperation, only 
a fantasy' of the imagination 
when Mr. Nixon first visited the 
Soviet Union, is now treated 
by the American public as im-

Why silence Radio LiEerty? 
By Roscoe .Drummond 
Wasbington 
Sen. J. W. Fulbright is 
out to silence Radio Liberty 
and Radio Free Europe for 
bad reasons. ' 
He has to rely on bad 
reasons because there are 
no good reasons. ? 
. These two radio stations 
broadcast news and infor-
mation to the people of the 
Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe which they can't 
get in any other way. They 
are located in Munich and 
they are financed by the 
.United States. ? 
Total extinction 
' Senator Fulbright says 
they ought .to be taken off 
the air on the. ground that 
they are '"relics of the cold 
war," that they disturb rela-
tions with Russia, and that 
they have . until recently 
been supported by the CIA. 
? Congress has ended CIA 
financing. It has provided 
open appropriations, but 
? they run out in six weeks. 
At that point Mr. Fulbright 
wants to bring about their 
total extinction. 
This broadcasting is not a 
"relic of the cold war" and 
repeating this canard over 
and over again doesn't make 
it true. 
At the Senator's request 
the Library of Congress 
undertook an exhaustiv.e 
study of the scripts of both 
Radio Liberty and Radio 
Free Europe and reported 
that they were definitely not 
in the mold nor the mood of 
cold-war propaganda. The 
report confirmed that they ? 
were notably objective and 
restrained. 
Naturally. the Kremlin 
would like it if no effort 
4. 
? 
was made Anywhere in the 
free world to give the So-
viet peoples any knowledge 
except that provided by the 
Soviet Government. 
Approved by censor 
But Radio Liberty does 
not seriously disturb U.S.-
Soviet relations. It gives 
Russians of all nationalities 
much information about in-
ternal affairs, which is 
otherwise censored by the 
/Kremlin, and provides bal-
ance and perspective to 
events happening outside 
Russia. 
How rigid is the Soviet 
censorship today? A former 
Russian journalist, who re-
cently left Moscow for the 
West, put it this way: 
"Not a single thing can 
be printed in the Soviet 
Union, whether it be a book 
or a postage stamp, a news-
paper or a label for a bot-
tle, a magazine or a candy. 
wrapper, unless it has been 
approved by the censor. No 
radio transmission is 
beamed, no public exhibi-
tion is opened for public 
view. until an official stamp 
has approved it." 
What makes these broad-
casts so valuable now is that 
in the Soviet Union and in 
Eastern Europe ? as illus. 
trated by. the bold effort of 
the Czechs to put some de-
mocracy into their commu-
nism ? there is a rising de-
mand among intellectuals 
and professionals for more 
freedom of speech and 
press, for an end to perva-
sive censorship, and for 
more government by the 
consent of the governed. 
This is a significant lib-
eralizing-reform movement 
and it has found one way to 
circumvent censorship. That 
? is "samizdat," which is the 
private circulation of type-
written or hand-written pro-
. tests, petitions, articles, es-
says and novels. Radio 
Liberty has already put 
nearly a thousand of them 
on the air. 
Expand news flow 
Thus Radio Liberty en-
ables the Russian reform-
ists to reach other Rus-
sians. 
Radio Liberty and Radio 
Free Europe reports de-
bates at the United Nations, 
including the remarks of 
the Chinese delegates,' 
whin the Soviets censor. 
They carry the protests of 
Soviet Jews which Moscow 
suppresses. They cover the 
pleas of Soviet citizens to 
? the UN Commission on Hu-
man ? Rights which the 
? Kremlin won't allow to be 
mailed. 
The Soviet people would 
have only one side of the 
Czech invasion if it Weren't 
for Radio Liberty. They 
would never know about 
Pasternak's "Doclor Zhi-
vago" or Solzhenitsyn's 
"The First Circle" if they 
weren't put on the air by 
Radio Liberty. 
Moscow does not hesitate 
to export ifs views in every 
language. Why shouldn't the 
U.S. be true to itself and 
support Radio Liberty and 
Radio Free Europe to fur-
ther the flow of news and 
information which is one of 
democracy's most precious 
ingredients? 
The need is to expand this 
flow, not black it out. The 
Senate will vote yea or.nay 
next month.

Fulbright: No time for relics 
Amodest little pamphlet put out by 
the U.S. Information Agency ten 
years ago said that USIA "tells America's 
story abroad." How simple it seemed: 
Uncle Sam reciting "Once upon a time 
in 1776 ..." to an underdeveloped na-
tion on his knee. It's a different story to-
day, as our propaganda machine tries to 
? find the right words and the right tone 
of yoke for a period in which the nation 
is simultaneously at war, at peace and at 
odds with itself. 
. In Washington last week, USIA won 
'approval of its new budget at the cur-
rent $200 million level, but only after 
the Senate restored cuts made in com-
mittee that would have reduced the 
agency's film and print activities and all 
but ?dismantled. the Voice of America. 
The .authorization squabble grew out of 
continuing- rivalry .between Congress and 
the White House .over foreign affairs, 
and a running feud between USIA di-
? rector Frank Shakespeare, a conservative 
former network executive who helped' 
design President Nixon's TV image in 
the 1968 campaign, and Sen. J. William 
Fulbright, chairman of the 'Foreign Re-
lations Committee and a critic of USIA 
since its inception . in 1953. While the 
showdown vote was an Administration 
,victory, it did nothilfg to clarify such 
questions as how good or bad our propa-
ganda actually is today, how it should 
change .or evolve in the 1970s, and 
whether Americans should be able to 
'see and hear it themselves. ? 
Theoretically, the law protects the 
American public from being propagan-
dized at its own expense by forbidding 
USIA to show its wares on the home 
front. Exceptions have been made in re-
cent years, however, and last month, 
despite objections by Senator Fulbright 
and others, Sen. .James Buckley, the 
conservative New York Republican, 
showed a USIA propaganda film about 
Czechoslovakia on his TV show. After the 
broadcast, Fulbright's committee passed 
a measure that 'would reaffirm and clari-
fy the ban on internal dissemination.

WASHINGTON ? (AP) ? 
President Nixon, mindful ' of 
congressional criticism, has 
Called for $38.5 million to 
support .the operations of 
Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty for fiscal 1973 while 
a study is made on future 
legislation. 
Funds for the two broad-
casting systems that beam 
programs behind the Iron 
Curtain would otherwise end 
July 1. Nixon said these radi-
os help to promote free, re-
respOnsible communication 
among nations. 
_ 
?  
He said, these radios "are 
not spokesmen for American 
official policy ? that role be-
longs in broadcasting to the 
. Voice of America. Rather, 
they are expressions of our 
profound conviction that a 
responsible, independent and 
free press plays an indispen-
sable part in the social and 
political processes that look 
to better understanding and 
More effective cooperation, 
not only within a nation, but 
also among nations." 
Noting a number of differ-
Milliin fir 
Free 
ent views that have been ex-
pressed in Congress on how 
...to fund the radios in the fu-
ture, Nixon said he will ap-
point a presidential study 
commission to make recom-
mendations to him by Feb. 
28, 1973, to examine this 
problem and suggest the best 
possible way to provide sup-
port "for these valuable or-
ganizations . . . without im-
pairment to the professional 
independence upon which 
their present effectiveness 
depends." 
At the end of March, 
Nixon signed a law providing 
grants of $36 million in fiscal 
1972 for the two radios, 
which he said had been ap-
proved by large majorities in 
Congress and which he said 
reflects the judgment of 
many that they "continue to 
perform a unique and valua-
ble service." 
He strongly recommended 
that Congress give favorable 
consideration to this new bill 
before the beginning of the 
new fiscal year.

? By ERIIC BERT 
Radio Free Europe was con-
ceived in 1949 by the Truman ad-
ministration as an anti-Soviet 
instrumentality "outside the 
realm of government," that is, 
outside the possibility of .Con-
'gressional scrutiny or control. 
Seeretary of State Dean Ache-
son, one of the 'inspirers of the 
cold war, had directed Joseph 
C. Grey to."establish a private 
group to help deal with certain 
aspects of Eastern European ex-
iles" who "were paying frequent 
visits to the State Department." 
The idea had been suggested 
originally in February, 1949, by 
.George Kerman, a State Depart-
ment official. 
DeWitt C. Poole, a former For-
eign Service officer, gathered a 
group of prominent Americans 
to fOrm the National Committee 
for a Free Europe, formally in-
corporated in New York on June 
2, 1949, as Free Europe, Inc. ? 
Grew told a press conference 
at the, time that the purpose 
was in part to find jobs for the 
"democratic" refugees from the 
socialist countries of Eastern 
Europe. . 
The National Committee for a 
Free Europe was not primarily 
an employment agency, however. 
It was a CIA channel for organ-
ized warfare against the Soviet 
Union, with these "democratic" 
characters as its troops. 
By July, 1949, a Radio Com-
mittee had been established with-
in NCFE-CIA. A ? year later, in 
July, 1950, the Radio Committee 
went on the air as Radio Free 
Europe, a division of NCFE-
CIA. 
This period Was roughly con-
current with the persecution cf 
the top U.S. Communist Party 
leaders who were indicted un-
der the Smith Act in 1948 and, 
following a nine-month trial and 
appeals, went to prison in 1951 
for long terms. 
By the end of 1950, RFE-CIA 
had established a short wave 
radio in 'West Germany and 
was broadcasting one and a half 
hours daily to Albania, Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland 
and Romania. By the end of 
1951, RFE-CIA was operating 
three transmitters in Germany 
and one in Portugal. 
Czechoslovakia became the 
prime target, with one of the 
transmitters broadcasting a full 
day's program to the republic. 
There were limited short-wave 
broadcasts to the other targets. 
By the tnid-1950s, RFE-CIA was 
broadcasting 18-20 hours per 
day, through some 29 transmit-
ters, primarily to Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary and Poland. All of 
these became subsequently the 
Scenes of counterrevolutionary 
attempts. ? 
. . 
The CIA's Free Europe, Inc., 
its holding company, established, 
in addition to its broadcast opera-
tions, the Free Europe Press 
which until the fall of 1955 en-
gaged in balloon leaflet-distribu-
tion and "has also carried out

Voice of America 
Chairman J. William Fulbright, 
for all his accumulated learning on 
and off the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, should be plagued 
by his calling the Voice of America 
a relic of the Cold War. 
.Granted there's a lingering eu-
phoria over rapprochement with 
Red China dictated perhaps by mu-
tual international interests which no 
one presumes are immutable. But 
what other euphemism than "Cold 
War" can describe, say, the soviet 
Union's continued support and fi-
nancing of .Communist subversion 
in Latin America? 
Columnist Jack Anderson, for 
example, recently reported a secret 
,finding by the Central Intelligence 
Agency, which he said "has put to-
gether the jigsaw pieces from its 
agents in Europe and Latin Amer-
ica." . 
An earlier Anderson report told 
how Cuban Premier Fidel Castro 
? moved his Latin American liberation 
Center from his Paris embassy to 
the ? one in Santiago, Chile, where 
Marxist Salvador Allende is presi-
dent, duly chosen in a democratic 
election, albeit .by a plurality. (In 
his field of three, of course, Presi-
dent Nixon was not elected by pop-
ular majority either.). 
But the Kremlin, according to the 
,quoted CIA report, has asked Cas-
STATI NTL 
Cold War Relic'? 
tro "to try to regain control over 
Latin American revolutionary move-
ments" and has promised "to pay all 
the costs involved." 
The Soviets are said to look with 
favor upon the "Chilean formula, 
which maintains that traditional 
democratic procedures are the best 
means of socialist power in weak, 
backward countries," though they 
will back Che Guevara-type armed 
revolution or political struggle, : 
"whichever was deemed appropriate 
in given countries throughout Latin 
America." 
If the ?CIA report is accurate or 
representative, should the United 
States and the rest of the Free 
World be sheepish about expressing 
our side or about "provoking" Rus-
sia in a fancied thaw in the Cold 
War? 
Genuine overtures for mutual 
arms reduction and general detente 
are not to be discouraged, but let us 
not presume that muting Radio Free 
Europe or VOA, whose messages 
are beamed tO what were once con-
ceded "captive nations" of Eastern 
Europe, will somehow cause the Rus-
sian masters to stop feeding, or call 
off, their dogs of the Cold War. 
Isolationism is not going to make 
unpleasant world forces go away?
no matter how hard we wish upon 
an Aquarian star.

'.USIA 
' The Senate is to be congrat-
ulated for having overridden 
Its Foreign Relations Commit-
tee, restoring $45 million that 
the committee had cut from 
the budget authorization of the 
United States Information 
Agency. 
The action of the committee 
to cripple USIA was a curi-
ous combination of vindictive-
ness and muddle-headed logic 
to begin with. Obstensibly, the 
vote to ?cut 20 percent of the 
agency's $200 million budget 
was part of the continuing 
struggle between Congress 
and the White house over the 
Issue of "executive privilege." 
In this case, the dispute. 
:arose over a refusal by the 
administration to.. turn over to 
the committee its "program 
memoranda" f r o in various 
Cotintrkes, outlining the major 
propaganda objectives for the 
countries. The agency argued 
that these were internal plan-
ning documents rather than 
policy statements. Committee 
Chairman J. William Ful-
bright contended that, what-
ever they were, the committee 
needed them to evaluate the 
validity of the USIA programs 
abroad. 
On both sides, it was a silly 
.dispute which really had very 
'little relevance to the prob-
blem of executive privilege 
)or the prerogatives of the 
' ? 
tits: It's Good That Fulbricht Failed 
Congress. It carried strong 
overtones of a personal feud 
between Fulbright and USIA's 
hawkish dire c to r, Frank 
Shakespeare. The committee 
action suggested that the 
chairman had neither forgot-
ten nor forgiven the comment 
of a top USIA official (since 
resigned) that Fulbright's 
views on foreign policy were 
"naive and stupid." 
But more than this, the dis-
pute reflected a continuing 
and profound difference be-
tween the corrimittee liberals, 
headed by I..'ulbright, and the 
administration over anything 
that might be labeled as 
official propaganda. 
In Fulbright's view, all of 
these activities, whether con-
ducted by USIA or by such 
separate operations as Radio 
Liberty and Radio Free Eur-
ope, come under the heading 
of "Cold War activities" in-
compatible with the new era 
of ideological disarmament, 
reconciliation a n d detente. 
There is good reason to be-
lieve that the committee axe 
would have fallen in any case, 
whether or not the larger is-
sue of legislative -executive 
prerogatives had been raised. 
In any event, the axe, when 
it fell, cut to the bone. Under 
. . 
the budget reported out by 
the committee, the Voice of 
America, which is the guts of 
the USIA effort, would have 
been effectively muzzled. Its ? 
program of 780 broadcast 
hours weekly in 35 languages 
would have been reduced to 
454 hours in 11 languages. 
Most broadcasts to Eastern 
Europe would have been elim-
inated altogether. 
The broadcasts to Africa, 
except in French, would have 
been completely eliminated. 
So would a large part of the 
Asian program, including 
broadcasts in Bengali, Bur-
mese, Hindi, Khmer, Korean, 
Lao, Thai and Urdu. Of 15 
broadcast relay stations in 
the United States and over-
seas, seven would have had 
to be shut down. 
Other overseas operations 
of the agency would have been 
similarly curtailed. USIA 
would have had to close down 
operations completely in some 
30 countries, cutting out 34 
branch posts and reading 
rooms and reducing opera-
tions in the remaining coun-
tries. The motion picture and 
television service would have 
had to close one of its two 
studios and satellite transmis-
sions would have been elimi-
nated. More than a quarter of 
the USIA staff would have 
been fired, including 1,000 
Americans. 
All this, mind you, in the 
name of international amity 
and the relaxation of tensions 
with the Communist and un-
committed world. All this, 
given the almost incredible 
insularity and isolationism of 
the liberals on the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee, 
based on the utterly false sup-
position that the function of 
USIA is to encourage tension, 
to undermine the morale of 
foreign. 'populations and to 
present the. United States as 
a dangerous ideologie.al and 
political adversary. 
Which leads one to wonder 
what in the world the Foreign 
Relations Committee thinks 
detente is all about. Anyone 
who has lived and traveled 
abroad knows that USIA (and 
Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty) represents a most 
essential?and in Some cases 
unique?conduit of free infor-
mation and ideas into the 
closed societies of the world. 
To base a detente on the sev-
erance of all communication 
with the ? East?leaving the 
Soviet Union free to carry on 
its infinitely inore pervasive 
propaganda?is to promote the 
peace of the grave. Which is 
reason enough to hail the wis-
dom of the Senate in restoring 
the funds. ?

? Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty became a problem for 
the Nixon Administration, for the 
CIA, and others in January, 1971 
when Congress, under persisting 
public pressure, addressed itself 
cautiosly to the 'funding and ad-
ministration of the two radios. 
"Both radios had hitherto os-
tensibly been supported by pri-
vate funds but had actually been 
largely funded by. the Central In-

The Advertising Council, an

cover for tie CIA funding of

RFE-CIA, but actually to conceal 
the fact that the RFE's money 
comes from the CIA. The Adver-
tising Council disguises its CIA 
cover campaigns as a "public 
service." 
The RFE media campaigns 
*iced through the Advertising 
Council had a commercial value 
;of between $12 million and $20 
million, according to Senator 
Clifford Case (R-NJ). 
However, the returns on these 
expenditures were pitiable?less 
than $100,000. The obvious con-

'PEACE' 
in Europe. 
? Upon returning to Bonn, Allardt paraphrased 
some of the warnings the men in the Kremlin 
have asked him to convey to the German leaders. 
Before his departure, Allardt had met with 
Leonid Brezhnev, the current Soviet No. 1, Pre-
mier Kosygin, Foreign Minister Gromyko and 
President Podgorny. 
Ominously, the Soviet leaders mentioned the 
word "war" in expounding about what will happen 
in the event the Bundestag rejects the Moscow-
Bonn and Warsaw-Bonn treaties recently negoti-
ated by the Government of Chancellor Willy 
Brandt with the Kremlin and with the Soviet-
sponsored Communist Polish regime. 
In his diplomatic parlance, Allardt stated that 
the interviews were "friendly, but at. the same 
time marked with a penetrating seriousness." 
Henry M. Kissinger, White House foreign policy 
mentor, has been giving "backgrounder" briefings 
to elected commentators conveying the idea that 
the Nixon Administration was alarmed at the 
extent of the concessions made by the Brandt Gov-
ernment to the Soviets and their captive States. 
Actually, in his desire to run as the "Peace Presi-
dent" in November 1972, President Nixon has let 
the Kremlin leaders know that he is ready to grant 
them?and to help them assert?suzerain rights 
in all Western Europe, as well as in Germany and 
in the Soviet-occupied countries of Central and 
Eastern Europe. That is the meaning of the vocal 
support which Radio Free Europe and Radio Lib-
erty currently are giving to Brandt's new Ost-
politik, and especially to the German treaties with 
the Communist countries which the German Par-
liament will be asked to ratify early in May. Both 
U.S.-sponsored radio networks are operated by the 
Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA) which is now 
under direct control of Kissinger. 
The true intent of this Soviet-American accord 
is difficult to infer from Soviet radio broadcasts 
and publications, partly because of the exceeding-
ly obscure Marxist terminology. It is also difficult 
to guess from the media, subjected to State De-
partment guidelines. 
The retiring German ambassador in 
Moscow, Helmut Allardt, has put 
his finger on President Nixon's real 
policy toward the Soviet designs 
STATI NTL 
But there is nothing obscure about the coming 
new arrangement in Europe, as described in Com-
mentary, the monthly magazine sponsored by the 
American Jewish Committee. In its January 1972 
issue, after shedding crocodile tears over the fail-
ure of European leaders to implicitly follow the 
Rothschild-Rockefeller Convergence scheme, Wal-
ter Laqueur reveals: 
Western Europe would not be physically oc-
cupied by Soviet forces, but there would be Soviet 
hegemony over the whole European Continent. 
Moscow will not necessarily insist on the inclusion 
of Communists in every European Government, 
but ( as in Finland) it would demand that untrust-
worthy political leaders or parties be excluded 
from positions of power and influence, and it 
would expect a ban on any criticism of Soviet poli-
cies. Broadcasting stations critical of Soviet poli-
cies would be removed from the air as a danger to 
European "security." All interference with the ac-
tivities of Soviet agents will be banned as a "hos-
tile act." In short, the part of Europe that is still 
free will be readied for easy gobbling up by the 
Soviets. 
This is the deal Nixon is scheduled to sign in 
Moscow this month.

Communist Countries is not 
nr - ? 
the bortthteer r naive for us to think that 
a-  
and peace are in the offing. I do not - 
diwree with that. 
We have many problems with Russia, 
but I submit that one of the obstacles 
to better relations with Eastern Europe 
and Russia and most of those other ' 
countries?although I think our rela-
tions have improved over time--but in 
any case, among the principal irritants 
arc these broadcasts from Voice of Amer-
ica, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Lib-
erty. They contribute to keeping alive the 
animosity and suspicion which exists be-
tween our country and Russia. I said be-
fore with retard to Radio Free Europe it 
seemed to me with the President going to 
Russia and having just been to China, 
and having announced a policy of trying 
to normalize and improve relations with 
those countries that it is inconsistent to 
" continue a propaganda program de-
signed to arouse the suspicion of the peo-
ple of those countries against their gov-
ernments. 
I do not think it accomplishes our 
purposes; it harms our relations. I can 
, well imagine that there are people in " 
. Russia who disagree with their leaders' 
policy of meeting with the President of 
? - the United States and who make the 
Same arguments that are made on the 
? floor of this body that there is no hope 
? for. better relations with the United 
States, or that they are kidding them-
selves to think they can do business with 
? the United States. One of the things 
they would point out would be the prop-
aganda we engage in. 
It has always puzzled me why the 
Russians have such suspicion with re-
gard to the SALT talks. They had one 
meeting interrupted by the U-2 incident. 
?Those not disposed to normalized rela-
tions with us can point to the Voice of 
- America and Radio Liberty and say, 
"They do not really. mean it, they are 
kidding us. They continue the old war-
time programs of propaganda intended 
, to undermine the stability of our gov-
ernment." 
I ask very seriously on the merits 
whether the program is well designed to 
accomplish the announced purposes of 
the President and what I believe to be 
the overwhelming view Of the people of 
the United States, and that is to bring 
' about better relations with the people of 
. Russia, China, and Eastern Europe. 
It seems to me it is high time in this 
world with nuclear weapons that some 
other approach to the solution of these 
? international differences be developed; 
that greater emphasis be placed on co-
operation and discussion such as the 
United Nations offers, than to keep alive 
the traditional anticommunism which 
we have been subjected to for so long, 
to keep that alive by spending $200 mil-
lion in this case, and many millions of 
dollars more in the case of Radio Liberty 
and Radio Free Europe. I am not under 
any illusion it is going to be easy, but I 
think some different approach than the 
the we have had is called for. 
Mr. President, I referred earlier to an 
article by Bruce J. Oudes, who, I see, 
served with the USIA overseas from 
1961 to 1965 and is now an International 
reporting fellow at Columbia University. 
So he speaks from substantial experience 
in the USIA. ? 
Mr. President, the article ntitled "The 
Great Mind Machine" relates to the 
problem I am talking about and that is 
the value of the USIA itself. 
Just to give a sample of the article, 
I wish to read one part: 
Much of the time there is a gnawing 
suspicion that whatever the project of the 
day might be, you're participating in a giant 
charade, a hoax. 
"What am I doing here?" Is a question 
that often intrudes in the mind of the USIA

THE GREAT WIND MACHINE 
(By Bruce J. Oudes) 
The sight of a wheel rolling off into the 
desert- is of distinct interest if it Is one of 
four carrying you to Nouakchott, the capital 
of Mauritania. 
It happened the visit was a goodwill, more 
correctly a misguided will, mission. The oc-
casion, replete with rising sandstorm, pro-
vided time and conditions for a unique reas-
sessment of the heavy cargo, principally 
hundreds of pounds of pamphlets explaining 
the American way of life, which had con-
tributed to the breakdown. 
My companion, who had been sent from 
Washington to see if the United States In-
formation Agency (USIA) was hitting the 
"target" in West Africa, blew the sand off 
a brochure on the American economy, one 
which described the marvelous Detroit motor 
vehicle, and broke up laughing. 
On another occasion, the scene was the 
Congo and my companion was an American 
newsmagazine correspondent. We spent a 
rather wry afternoon driving around the 
precincts of Katanga distributing a station-
wagon load of American-produced "get out 
the vote" leaflets in Swahili in preparation 
for an election which, to no one's surprise, 
ratified orn e as ic =go s 
Prime Min ster. 
Any officer in USIA has a store of such 
stories. They are rooted in the frustration of 
determining the message, the audience, and 
how the audience Is supposed to react to the 
message. Much of the time there is a gnaw-
ing suspicion that whatever the project of 
the day might be; you're participating in a 
giant charade, a hoax. 
"What am I doing here?" is a question 
that often intrudes in the mind of the 
USIA officer as he goes about his appointed 
rounds. Why was I hauling those pamphlets 
across the Sahara? In time the two of us 
delivered our "freight"?the agency term for 
its message?to the American Embassy in 
Nouakchott, and it was duly distributed to 
its Mauritanian audience. Yet it is hard to 
imagine that any minds were altered by our 
pamphlets, either among the illiterate 
nomads who make up most of the popula-
tion, or among the tiny literate rulinu class, 
tvhose ears are tuned to Cairo and Paris. 
Certainly our message did not prevent 
Mauritania's rulers from breaking relations 
with the U.S. during the 1967 Arab-Israeli 
war. And why was I hustling votes for Moise 
Tshornbe in the Congo? Tshombe won the 
election with American help, but not be-
cause of anything USIA. did; the constitu-
ency that mattered was the white merce-
naries, who voted with their guns, and the 
kind of U.S. help that mattered was money 
and arms, and planes supplied by the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency. If we won any votes 
in Katanga, which I doubt, they weren't 
counted?that's not how power is won and 
lost in the Congo. Thus the USIA officer's 
self-criticism centers around feelings of 
'futility: harmless in Mauritania, but dis-
tasteful in the Congo. 
The agency that sends its people on such 
? missions is a I7-year-old cold war hybrid, the 
descendant of the World War I George Creel 
committee and then in World War II the 
Overseas Operations Branch in Elmer Davis's 
Office of War Information. At the end of 
the war OWI was transferred to the State 
Department where William Benton, the ad-
vertising man, later a U.S. Senator, nursed 
it for two years. As the cold war got under-
way, Benton's office drafted a bill which be-
came the Smith-Mundt Act and put propa-
ganda permanently into the American de-
fense arsenal. Under the Eisenhower Admin-
istration in June, 1953, John Foster Dul-
les rid his beloved State Depadtment of the 
dirty linen of propaganda work and the name 
U.S. Information Agency was born. The USIA 
budget passed the $100 million mark dur-
ing the Eisenhower years and floated up *to 
its present $175 million mark during the two 
subsequent Democratic Administrations. 
Today USIA produces 66 magazines in 27 
languages. Its Voice of America broadcasts 
932 hours weekly in nearly three dozen lan-
guages using 104 transmitters with a total 
of 19 ,million watts. It has assisted foreign 
book publishers in-producing more than 120 
million conies of over 14.000 editions since 
1950. It operates more than 22 libraries vis-
ited by 20 million or more persons annually 
(down from over. 31 million in 1935). It 
radloteletypes abroad a 10,000-word daily file 
of Administration statements and packaged 
stories ready for foreign newspapers to lunk 
In their columns. It does all this with a 
staff of 2,139 Foreign Service personnel, a 
total which will be reduced to about 1,760 
by mid-year by Presidential order. Foreign 
Service personnel, however, are substantially 
outnumbered by the 2,410 permanent Wash-
ington-based employees who try to commu-
nicate America to a world they never see.

TO BELIEVE official Washington, it 
would be a, "tragedy" if the Amer.-
ican-financed ,Radio ?Free, Europe and 
Radio Liberty in Munich went off the 
air. A tragedy for whom? Do they 
think in the United States that the so-' 
cialist countries will miss them? The 
two stations have already swallowed 
up nearly $500. million and now cost the 
American taxpayer nearly $40 million 
a ,year?so it will hardly be a- tragedy 
for him.- If anyone might suffer from 
their closure, it is the . handful that 
feed from its anti-communist propa-
ganda kitchen. 
In any case, the word "tragedy" is 
altogether' out of place Where it con-' 
terns air polluters who subsist on pro-
paganda which at best is cheap. A 
morn suitable word would be "comedy." 
For what if not Comic Were the, Wash-
ington AdMinistration's claims that' 
It had nothing to do with the two 
stations, that they were depeqdent 
..solely on "private contributions" and, 
"dimes from schoolchildren"? Goveen-
ment officierr3 had good cause to pon-
der long on how to camouflage the 
whole thing. ."Official government ra-
dios mist take care to avoid the charge 
of interference in the internal affairs 
of other nations," Assistant Secretary 
of State Hillenbrand said in the Senate 
Foreign Relations Cominittee?', on May 
24, 1971. . 
'The comedy flopped when Senators 
Clifford 'Case and William ? Fulbright 
openly charged that Radio Free Europe 
and itadio Liberty were financed by the 
Central Intelligence Agency. They thus 
. confirmed what. had long been asserted 
by .the Soviet Union and other socialist 
countries, namely, that these Munich 
stations Were subsidiaries of. the U.S. 
Information Agency and the CIA, "It 
was always ridiculous to pretend that 
Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe 
.had no connection, with U.S. govern-
ment agencies," Cyrus Sulzberger com-
mented In the New. York Times. 
World public opinion now possesses 
'enough facts, to form a clear idea about 
these "free" voices of the "free world." 
Newspapers everywhere printed ? the 
revelations of -Captain Andrzej:Czecho-

and, parcel of -espionage and overt sub-. 
'version ,against ,out 'countries..., The 
two; political :,departments and all , the. 
sections of the broadcasting station are, 
headed; Thy . American intelligence 
officers." . 
Then there is the book "Hungarians 
on,. P?dyrbll," just published `-?ift

Pinter,? spent fifteen years collecting 
material about the subversive activities 
of Hungarian emigres working for 
Western Intelligence services and about 
Radio. Free Europe and its sinister part ' 
in- the 'preparation' of the counter-
revolutionary putsch of 1956. 
Lastly; there is the. new Soviet tele-
vision film about Radio Libeity pro-
vocateurs?an expose based strictly on 
documents and affidavits. 
But: perhaps the socialist countries 
.are too prejudiced against Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty which, their 
directors and patrons affirm, sow "seeds' 
of truth, freedom and justice" and not 
the poisonous seeds of anti-communism,, 
hostility, distrust and international ten-
sion? Let 'us see what is said on this 
score in Federal Germany and the, 
United States. ? 
? 
"Anyone. whb wants to work for 
Radio Liberty must be an anti-commun-
ist," a spokesman of this Munich broad-
casting station said in an interview with 
Axel Springer's Die Welt. .And here is 
the opinion of Senator Fulbright. The 
two stations, he said. are "a product di 
the U-2, Bay of Pigs and Tonkin Gulf 
,mentality," a "part of a pattern?a pat-
tern of falsehood and deception?a pat-
tern of fraud and deceit?a 'pattern of 
conspiracy to -mislead not only the 
American but anybody else who was 
willing to listen and follow." The 
Washinglon:,Evening Star wtites . that 
one can agree that the production ot 
the Munich "voices" is nothing but, 
official propaganda against the com-
munist countries. Both stations, writes 
Bernard Gwertiman in the ? New York 
.Times, "were set' up at the height of 
.PROBLEMS AND OPINIONS 
the Cold wax to broadcast news and ' 
commentary to the Soviet Union and 
its .Eastern European allies." 
The' cold war has been abating of 
late, and this is recognized In the West 
too. But what do the Munich "voices" 
care about that? These offshoots of the 
Cold war have not become wiser with 
the years, they are still its troubadours, 
They persevere in the "liberalization 
of the Soviet Union" (New York Times), 
In trying to "infitience people in the 
Russian orbit at? the expense of the 
communist governments" (New York 
Post). While qualifying the two stations 
as a "hangover of the cold war," the 
New York Post 'intimates that the U.S; 
government appears to have no inten-
tion of "kicking its long addiction to 
anti-communist crusades at home and 
abroad." 
Are the present-day crusaders, one 
may ask, not being too presumptuous 
In venturing beyond their own borders, 
even' if only on the air? 
Senator Stuart Symington '.put the' 
question bluntly during the discussion 
of the State Department budget in the 
, Senate. Didn't the .Secretary of State" 
" think that the American broadcasting. 
stations in Munich were interfering in 
?the internal affairs of other nations, he 
asked Rogers. 
Rogers tried tO avoid giving a direct, . 
reply. But 'the question cannot be. 
evaded. The Munich broadcasts, the, 
Washington Post wrote in one of its 
editorials. were a form of interference 
in the. internal affairs .of Eastern Eu-
rope and the 'SOviet Union. 
In the recent U.S.?China com-

support for the principle of non-inter-

"How, it is asked, can that be squared

'.ORANGE, N.J. 
RECORD, 
MAR 3 0 1972 
WEEKLY ? 3,800 
- 
0 YZ 
By Sen. Clifford Case 
Last week the Congress 
approved my bill to bring 
into the open the funding of 
Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty which 
broadcast to Eastern 
Europe. 
. I first introduced this 
legislation in January 1971. 
At that time, I decried the 
fact that for over twenty 
years the two stations had 
been financed covertly by 
the Central Intelligence 
Agency LCJA1,,While such 
'? funding might well have 
, been justified for a few 
years in the conteit of the 
early 1950's, it seemed to me 
.there was no reason to have 
continued U.S. Government 
contributions on a secret 
basis for all those years, 
particularly in light of the 
hundreds of millions of the 
taxpayers' dollars wnicii 
were being spent. 
. My purpose was not to end 
the broadcasts of the 
station*. It was simply' to 
bring their financing out 
into the open. 
Our Constitution. states 
that Congress shall ap-
propriate funds for 
government purposes and 
the: Congress had never 
knowingly voted a penny for 
either station. The money 
had come out of that vast 
intelligence budget which is 
hidden in other ap-
propriated funds. Moreover, 
in 1967 a high level govern-
ment study -pawl) 
recommended that CIA 
financing of activities such 
as RFE and RL be ter-
minated. 
I did not question whether 
or not RE and RL were 
doing a good job. Frankly, I 
had no way of knowing, 
since one obvious result of 
the secret funding was that 
neither Congress nor the 
public had much idea what 
the radios were doing. Tliere 
were, of course, television 
and magazine commerieals 
for RYE, but they gave the 
Misleading impression that 
without private con-
tributions the stations would 
not be to broadcast. 
Hearings wei-e sene.uled 
in the Senate For(_ign 
Relations Committee en my 
bill which, in effect, 
authorized funds for ac-
tivities that were already 
being paid for secretly by 
the government. ? 
For the first- time, we 
received reasonably 
complete information about 
RFE's and RIA programs, 
costs, assets, 7rtil i: abilities. 
While the A. ininietration 
did not object to open fun-
ding, it suggested that the 
stations be In.r:led through 
a - -public ccr:.oez ;lion. This 
measure wai voten down in 
the aif n Relations 
' Committee, net the Com-
mittee and late:- the Senate, 
adopted my original 
proposal for ..cpen funding 
through diecretary .of 
States - 
-The of 
Represe t then 
passed cn bi!,1- which, 
while ac !'ti.rae the open 
funding ? `,!, called for 
a differc of structure 
for the iwe stations. 
A deadioek between the 
House and the Senate then 
developed when several of 
my colleagues decided that 
RFE and RL should be ? 
discontinued entirely. 
Happily, the impasse was 
recently broken, and the 
Congress as a whole has now 
approved funds for BFE and 
RL through the current 
fiscal year. Thus, RFE and 
RL have finally been put on. 
the same basis as other 
regular governmental 
activities and programs.

? Literate Americans know, but may not 
? care, that a taxpaid government espio-
nage agency is waging a not-so-secret 
war in Laos against Communist insur-
gents in that country. 
. The administration cannot afford to 
send military troops into Laos, for such 
a inove would be interpreted as an 
? escalation of the war?which it surely 
would be.. 
In view of the mounting public distaste 
for American military adventures in oth-
er people's countries, we cannot under-
stand why there is no outcry against the 
use of civilian CIA "troops" in Laos. 
If .more were known about the CIA, 
-public indifference might change to out-
rage. Here are some episodes in which 
the CIA was involved, each of which 
,outraged us: 
is-The CIA's spy plane over Russia 
demolished President Eisenhower's sin-
cere efforts to improve relations with the 
Soviets. How would you like it if Russian 
'Spy planes were dispatched over Ameri-
ca? 
is-The CIA conducted an armed inter-
vention in order to save Guatemala from 
leftist political elements of which the 
prevailing powers didn't approve. Inter-
nal politics in Guatemala aren't any of 
America's business. How would you like 
it if Guatemalan spies worked to discred-
it one of the American political parties? 
Is-The CIA secretly financed Radio Free 
.Europe, which many df us innocently 
believed was supported wholly by private 
"- contributions. The CIA's takeover of 
.RFE! thoroughly stripped the radio sta-
tion of credibility. How would you like it 
if a foreign spy network beamed radio 
.messages into America under the cover 
.of "information?" 
Is-The CIA planned and directed the Bay 
of Pigs fiasco. How would you like it if a 
Man spy apparatus equipped an army 
of disgruntled American exiles and dis-
patched them as an invasion force bent 
:on the overthrowof the governmnt? 
- 10-The, CIA conducted a military opera-
lion in the Dominican Republic to pre-
:vent a. rebellion which would have re--, 
stored to power a president Whom righ-
tist forces had deposed. How would you 
like it if foreign spies had intervened in 
the American revolution, in support of 
George III? 
0-The CIA gave armed support to the? 
overturn of a Congo government and had 
a strong role in the overthrow of Dicta-
tor Diem of South Vietnam, an accom-
plishment which produced another dicta-
tor more pleasing to Washington. 
? In none of these enterprises has the 
CIA enhanced the name a the United' 
States of America. To the contrary, it 
has given support to the spreading view-
point that tlie United States is a med- ? 
dling power which has contributed enor-
mously to the unsettled state of the: 
world. 
In all of these enterprises the CIA has 
been answerable to no one except presi-
dents who, incredibly, had io compunc-
tion about conferring the power to make 
War upon, an intelligence agency. 
And, if we've got you to thinking about 
the CIA, think about this: it has 18,000 
, employes, 6,000 of whom ar6 working in 
clandestine services, according to Victor 
L. Marchetti, a former CIA agent, who is 
writing a book about the CIA.' The CIA 
budget, Marchetti maintains, is $6 billion 
a year. - 
Marchetti May be wrong on every 
count. The number of CIA agents in-
volved in clandestine activities and the 
annual CIA budget are "secrets" with-
held from the American people. 
And one more observation: the admin-, 
istration has obtained a temporary order 
against publication of Marchetti's book. 
Naturally.

By ERIK BERT 
Senator J. W. Fulbright. chair-
man of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, asked the Library of 
Congress last June to furnish the 
. committee with an analysis of 
the operations. of Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty. 
The Librar:st of Congress re-
searchers completed their work 
seven months later. in January. 
The committee staff informed 
the researchers about some al-
leged' deficiencies. Nevertheless, 
the final LC reports were "sub-
stantially as the original drafts." 
Senator Fulbright said. 
Following receipt of the reports 
by the committee, rumors were 
circulated. in Washington charg-. 
Ing that Fulbright was suppress-
ing the information or altering 
its presentation. In response, Ful-
bright had the reports published 
in the Congressional Record .of 
March G. 1972. except for, he said. 
several hundred additional pages 
of appendices. which he said are 
available to the public in the For-
eign Relations Committee office. 
where the original draft reports 
' can also be consulted. As it is. 
the text of the reports covers 
more than' 80 of the Congres-
sional Record's triple-column 
pages. 
In presenting the documents to 
the Senate. Fulbright pointed out 
that Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty "still refuse to 
acknowledge publicly any ties to 
the U.S. intelligence community." 
The two enterprises are known 
to be vehicles for the Central In-
telligence Agency. 
The issue on which the RFE-? 
RL problem arose was how to 
switch them from under-the-
table financing by the CIA to 
aboveboard funding by the Con-
gress. The CIA and the Nixon 
Administration have resisted con-
gressional funding because that 
could open the doors to congres-
' sional inquiry as to how the 
money was being used, and the 
CIA wanted none of that. 
Fulbright offered a compromise. 
possibly a tongue-in-cheek resolu-
tion of the problem. Ile told the 
Senate he was "persuaded that 
the Radios should be liquidated. 
unless perhaps our European al:-
lies are willing to pick up their 
fair share of the financial bur-
den." However, in a letter to Sen. 
Charles Percy. which he inserted 
in the Congressional Record with 
the reports. Fulbright noted the 
"lack of any apparent interest on 
the part of our Western European 
allies to help share the financial 
burden imposed by the Radios." 
" Fulbright recalled to the Sen-
ate that in 1970 the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee had obtained 
from the Department of State a 
"brief description of the arrange-
ments and mechanisms used by 
the executive branch to maintain 
policy control and direction of 
Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty." 
However. the Department of 
State "insisted" that its informa-
tion be available only "on a class-
ified basis." Senators who wanted 
to read it. Fulbright said, would 
have to betake themselves to the 
Foreign Relations Committee Cap-
itol office. S-116. ? 
The Library of Congress report: 
on Radio Free Europe was pre-
pared by James R. Price, .the 
LC's analyst in national defense. 
foreign relations division, and the 
report on Radio Liberty by Jo-
seph G. Whalen. a 20-year LC 
employee.

panying his reports. 
"In 1951, he was briefly em-

It is an open question whether 
he ever departed from the CIA. 
The RFE and HL reports. al-
though formally prepared by the

ate Foreign Relations Committee.

Despite this fact they are quite

'lough Of Covert Action 
While the Administration has obtained a tern. 
porary order against publication of a book on 
the CIA by a former officer of it, Victor L. 
Marchetti, the public has reason to be thankful 
to the author. He has already provided outside 
of book covers some valuable insights and corn-
Inents on an agency that. deliberately hides 
from the public and Congress. 
Without revealing any really hidden secrets, 
the author uses published reports to note that 
the nation's intelligence budget is 6 billion dol-
lars a year, that the Central Intelligence Agency 
has 18,000 employes, and that 6000 of these 
'are working in clandestine services, as opposed 
,to intelligence collection. 
As it is, however, the CIA is the President's 
baby. ,Congress has proposed various control 
measures, such as a limit on the CIA budget, 
or requirements for clearer information about 
'it, or Senator Cooper's present legislation for 
'the CIA to give intelligence briefings to Con-
gress ?as well as the White House. Congress, 
after all, foots the bill, but it does not know 
for what. 
CIA officials occasionally surface frdm se-
crecy to complain that critics concentrate on 
CIA failures. If so, that is because -the public 
only hears about the failures, and they have 
to be, big ones at that. They always seem to 
Involve those covert or "paramilitary" opera-
tions, which range from a most qualified suc-
cess in Guatemala to an unmitigated disaster 
at Cuba's I3ay of Pigs. Mr. Marchetti says, "I 
don't think we've had a successful paramilitary 
operation yet." 
The clandestine operations are worth review: 
There was the U-2 spy plane incident that tor-
pedoed President Eisenhower's efforts to im-
prove relations with the Soviet Union. There 
was the CIA's proud armed intervention to 
"save" Guatemala from leftists, leaving the 
country to, oppression 4nd terrorism. There was 
the financing of Radio Free Europe Which, when 
disclosed, stripped that station of every vestige 
of freedom or credibility. And there was the 
Bay of Pigs. 
Then there was the CIA military operation to 
save .the Dominican Republic from a ?zebellion 
to return a democratically-elected president. 
There was armed support for the overturn of 
a government in The Congo. Of course, there 
was the CIA's hand in the overthrow of the 
Diem dictatorship in South Vietnam, opening 
the way for another dictatorship more satisfac-
tory to Washington. And there is presently 
war in Laos, which the CIA actively engendered 
without any visible success for the American 
position in Southeast Asia, much less for peace 
and order. ' 
Aside from the fact' that so many of these 
clandestine activities were inefficient and in-
effective, even aside from the fact that they 
were bound to be failures for America's long-
range prospects and'reputation even if they did 
succeed, the ability of the CIA to engage in 
paramilitary functions represents a continuing 
ability to start hostilities without the knowledge 
of the people or Congress, and certainly with-
out, any declaration of war. 
Author Marchetti is fair enough to say that, 
so far various presidents have kept a measure 
of control over such activities. That is no guar-
antee for the future, however, and it is Con-
gress, not the President, that is supposed to 
make decisions on war. Consequently, Mr. Mar-
chetti recommends confining intelligence ac-
tivities to a small and highly professional group, 
and eliminating the covert actions entirely. 
Intelligence simply cannot work well when 
governed by an agency equally interested in 
activities ranging from propaganda to military 
action; that is a conflict of interest. The nation 
does need successful intelligence. It does not 
need a publicly-uncontrolled and unanswerable 
power to, make war.

Right and Wrong 
BRUCE HERSCHENSOHN is 
? a brilliant movie producer who has 
created two prizewinning documen-
tary films for USIA. He is also a ded-
t icated foe of Sen. Fulbright's efforts 
? to gag Radio Free Europe, Radio Lib-
aft erty anirg-iii-OthCPOSIA:-programs. 
? He has publicly attacked Ful-
bright, saying that the Arkansas sen-
ator's criticisms of U.S. presidents 
"are only balanced by his words of 
praise .for Ho Chi Minh and 'thrush-
chev and his defense of the doctrine 
:of 'Wars of National Libergtion' 
SI 
a ? ? ? 
- ? Furthermore, he has charged that 
Fulbright's attempts to "downgrade" 
the USIA information programs 
"could be tragic for this nation and 
a catastrophic for the people of other 
nations." 
We admire Herschensohn's good 
Work for his country and share his 
view of Sen. Fulbright's curious out-
look on the world. But in one aspect 
? of his feud with Fulbright, we must 
? regretfully agree with the senator, at 
least in principle. In this case, it is an 
?. important principle. 
HERSCHENSOHN appeared on a 
television show with conservative 
4, Sen. James Buckley. On the same 
? show, carried by 12 stations in New 
s' York State, the producer's Academy 
?'Award-winning documentary on the 
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia 
was shown. This, despite Fulbright's 
efforts to block the airing of the film 
, 
on grounds that it violated the con-
-gressional ban on the distributing of 
such USIA films in this country. 
a 
Like Herschensohn, we find it 
,.. difficult to believe that Sen. Ful-
bright's objections were Motivated 
? by a high regard for the letter and 
spirit of the law. Sen. Fulbright has 
based his opposition to Radio Free 
Radio Liberty and ?011i-er 
such projects presumably because 
ST TINTL 
they tend to show the Sovlet Union 
in a bad light. 
Certainly there is no way that an 
honest report of the Soviet Union's 
invasion of a defenseless Czechoslo-
vakia could do otherwise. 
Nev,ertheless, and in spite of any 
such motivation on the senator's 
part, Congress was right to forbid 
the use of tax-supported propaganda 
in this country. The senator's objec-
tion seems valid. 
? 
AND, REGARDLESS of the un-
biased honesty of the propaganda or 
the acknowledged artistry of the 
presentation, the danger that Con-
gress saw in this use of propaganda 
is very real. 
In this case, the moviernaker is a 
conservative, the film itself is a rec-
ognized work of art and the events 
portrayed are authentic history. 
But what about next time? What 
if government propagandists were 
turning out hard-sell propaganda for, 
let us say, the guaranteed annual 
wage or forced busing or compulsory 
birth controls? Would we want our 
own tax dollars used by an incum-
bent administration to propagandize 
us? 
We think not. There is all too 
much of this sort of thing done now, 
under the guise of the bureaucracy's 
various "information" programs. 
But The News thinks that this 
misuse of tax dollars is wrong and 
should be stopped. We believe that 
Congress was right in its ban on the 
domestic showing of USIA films. 
It is regrettable that Herschen-
sohn has felt that it is necessary to 
quit the USIA in order to save it em-
barrassment, at a time when its fund 
request is before Fulbright's commit-
tee. At USIA the film-maker has 
served both his country and his art 
well. 
But in the matter of the film ban, 
we think the senator is right, even if 
he is right for the wrong reasons.

Keep These Sta.:ions et,eil 
A 
President Nixon the other day 
signed legislation which allows the 
continued funding of Radio Free 
E_urope and Radio?Liberty until the 
end of the current fiscal year on 
June 30. But what happens then, 
especially with the opposition of 
Sen. -J. W. Fulbright? 
We well recall in the depth of 
the "cold war" how effective Radio 
Free Europe was in disseminating 
the real news to those millions be-
hind the Iron Curtain. Then there 
was no question as to the value of 
R.F.E. It was an essential as far as 
? "our side" was concerned. 
However, a little more than a 
year ago, it was brought out that 
both RFE and Radio Liberty re-
ceived most of their operating 
funds from the Central Intel-
ligence Agency. This caused quite 
a stir .and subsequently Sen. DA--
bright said they were relics of 
the 50s. 
The Arkansas senator has a lot 
to say since he's chairman of the 
foreign relations committee in the 
upper house and he's against the 
stations' continuance. He feels that 
today the stations are an irritant 
to the Soviet Union. So? Is that 
supposed to scare us? 
Despite the: rapprochement that 
we're working on with Moscow, in 
the wake of the Peking visit, Sen. 
Fulbright is not on the right track 
when he wants to close down these 
stations because they're an irri-
tant. They, at least, keep the Rus-
sians- honest. 
As evidence of the stations' 
worth, the Polish press has as-
sailed Radio Free Europe in the 
wake of the accord worked out to 
give it funds to the end of June. 
One article assailed "inane propa-
ganda made by liars for idiots." 
now friendly can you get? 
As far as we're concerned, both 
stations are just as germane and 
necessary now as they were at the 
peak of the "cold war." Unless 
you're against the broadcasting of 
factual news reports to the peoples 
in eastern Europe. Don't close 
them down because of lack of 
funds.

. The rotund Soviet premier 
'descends from his jetliner on 
'arrival from Moscow and

.Suddenly, he notices one of

with a freshly pressed pair of

"But how did you know so 
quickly that my pants had 
split" Khrushchev inquires. 
"Oh, I heard on Radio Free 
Europe,", the aide replies. 
No one pretends that really 
happened, . but the story got 
wide circulation ? and laughs 
? in Eastern European court-
tries among listeners to RFE 
who depended on it for accu-
rate, prompt, sometimes em-
barrassing and ? uncensored 
'news; 
This Was the kind of news 
thatRFE and its sister outlet, 
Radio ? Liberty, were created 
in 1949 to broadcast to the 
Soviet Union and other Com-
muniSt. countries behind the 
Iron Curtain. 
More Restrained 
Twenty-three years later, 
the times have changed. The 
radios' brio.kftelsjA,W 
? opinion ojr6h$11. Kr^Hdrci-D 
penis, have become more re-
strained. But the prospects for 
.. ? ? 
The radios were established 
in West Germany with secret 
.financing from the Central 
Intelligence Agency to counter 
the highly controlled press 
and radio of the Communist 
governments. ? 
Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty made. it their 
business to broadcast back to 
Eastern Europe and the Sovi-
et Union information on 
events which went unmention-
ed by the official Communist 
media. They broadcast news 
about unauthorized strikes, 
intellectual ferment, natural 
disasters. - 
To help do this job, they 
made use of radio monitors 
?and research institutions ? 
staffed partly by refugees and 
partly by Western specialists. 
The two radio stations pub-
lished their research papers 
which were useful to scholars, 
journalists and Western intel-
ligence. 
From the U.S. point of view, 
the radios were promoting the 
free flow of information to an 
area where information was 
severely rationed. From the 
Comnumist point of view, the 
radios were and are an ilTi-
tunt; they were clearly sub-
versive and undermined Com-
munist authority; they consti-
tuted interference in the-inter-
nal affairs of the Communist 
countries. 
U.S. Dispute 
These points of view ,-stem 
from a fundamental ideologi-
- cal difference in Communist 
and Western atitudes, but now 
the matter of the operations 
has blossomed into a trouble-
some dispute between Con-
' ?* President ? Nixon signed. -a 
bill on March 30 to continue 
financing the two radio ? sta-
tions until June 30. They are 
beiog funded at $32 million a 
year, down from $36 million. 
The President had to. fight to 
get the bill Out of Congress. 
On March 11; in a special 
White House statement, he 
.said it would be a tragedy if 
the radios were forced to 
, close down. 
., The President was primari-
ly countering the tough oppo. 
? sition of Sen. J. William Ful-
bright, D-Ark., who questions 
the value of the radios contin-
. tied existence. He would have 
? them eliminated ?,-.or at least 
financed at a far smaller level 
by the United States. 
"I didn't intend for this to 
become a cause celebre," Ful-
bright said in an interview 
with UPI. "Pm primarily for 
cutting costs. Why, we in Ar-
kansas have difficulty in get-
ting $5 million for sewer and 
water projects." 
The Senator, who for weeks 
created a parliamentary im-
passe which threw the future 
a! the stations into doubt, does 
not appear to be implacably 
hostile to the continued broad-
cast operations. 
"Pm not going to die if 
these radio stations continue," 
he said. "I don't mind if the 
United States shares the oper-
ating expenses with a? number 
of Western Europr xi govern-
71"-ifs v7id ntv. 
third or one fourth of the 
costs." 
But Fulbright does raise a 
number of hard questions 
about the radio stations. 
? He calls them "relics of the 
Cold War." Radio Free Eu-
rope has been accused of en-
couraging the abortive Hun-
garian rebellion of 195G and of 
spreading unrest in Poland 
during December, 1970, 
demonstrations. 
Fulbright notes that Soviet 
leaders, on the eve of Presi-
dent Nixon's visit to Moscow 
next month, still regard the 
broadcasts as subversive. 
To continue these broad-
casts, Fulbright says, is to 
east doubt on the sincerity of 
the United States in achieving 
an East-West indente. 
If the radios do perform a 
useful function from the II.S. 
. A numberl of - specialists 
disagree, saying this would 
lay the United States open lo 
The charge of interfering in 
the internal - affairs- of the 
countries of Eastern Europe. 
While RFE and Radio -Liberty 
are regarded as semi-
independent, Voice of Ameri-
ca is directly government-
operated. 
Fulbright's dissent has not 
killed the radios. But it has 
forced the administration -to 
take a serious new look at 
RFE and Radio Liberty, how 
they perform, and what their 
value is. 
Officials are fond of com-
ments by Communist officials 
which acknowledge the radios 
provide useful information, 
particularly in Eastern Eu-
rope. 
Nobel Winner 
. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, 
the dissident, Nobel-Prize win-
ning Russian author, declared 
in a recent outburst a(minst 
the Soviet governmeid- that 
Radio Liberty was one of the 
few sources of true. informa-
tion in his country. - 
The State Department is 
now studying how best to fi-
nance the radio stations in the 
future. 
At Congressional hearings 
last May and September, it 
was suggested that a public-
private corporation be created 
:to keep the radios going. 
Possibly, West European 
governments, which are in 
closer geographical proximity 
to the Soviet Union, might 
chip in. It is felt here that 
West Germany may have a 
particular interest in shaping 
the future of RFE and Radio 
Liberty since they operate. 
from that country. 
Before approachin,g the

The Nobel Crime 
In a stupid and heartless move, the Soviet 
? Union has reused an entry visa to the . 
permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, 
7 Which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature. 
The terrible crime he was planning was. to 
,present, at an informal ceremony in a private 
:apartment in Moscow. the medal and diploma 
of the 1970 prize to -Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn, 
. 'Russia's greatest living writer. 
Because his novels depict the horrors of 
Stalin's prison camps, which he survived, and 
because he fearlessly speaks out against the 
police-state aspects of modern Soviet life, 
,-,-Solzhenitsyn is anathema to the ruling Cern-
'Munist Party. 
? 
:The cruel action by the party hacks in 
heating Solzhenitsyn of the pleasure of re-
?,ittiving his award is sure to backfire against 
them. It will only increase sympathy for the 
:1-persecuted witer in Russia and abroad. 
From anyone who values freedom, Solz-
henitsyn deserves respect bordering on awe-
-pot only for the uncompromising truth of his 
,inovels but also for his personal comportment. 
145L1- considerable risk, he is filling the role of 
;iRussia's conscience. 
He has long spoken against the trampling 
-IA civil rights. Last month he went further by 
circulating a "Lenten Letter." It accused the 
hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church of 
'.betraying its flock by acting as a tool of the 
atheist state. 
Instead of behaving like an unperson as an 
011iCast should, Solzhenitsyn this week called 
. two American news correspondents. He 
boldly complained of harassment aimed at 
? thwarting his work on a series of historical 
novels. 
tie is barred (torn using public achives 
and forbidden to hire research assistants. 
. v 
Survivors of the revolution are intimidated out - 
of sharing their memories with him. 
His friends are followed and threatened, his 
mail opened, his house bugged. His wife was . 
fired from her. job to intensify financial 
pressure on him. 
In the interview, Solzhenitsyn made a 
remark of special relevance to Americans. : 
criticized the Soviet press' lack of fairness 
and completeness and praised Radio Liberty, . 
which broadcasts in Russian from WPI.t 
Germany. 
"If we learn anything about events in our 
country," he said, "it's from there." 
Like radio Free Europe. its sister station - 
that broadcasts to the Soviet satellites, Radio. 
Liberty is supported by Mel]. S. government. 
Both stations are the target of a relentless 
vendetta by Chairman J. W. Fulbright of the. 
- Senate Foreign Relations Committee and will 
go off the air June 30 if he has his 'way. 
Radio Liberty is one medium by which the 
thoughts. of Solzhenitsyn and other dissident 
writers can reach broad audiences in Russia. 
It also serves as his insurance policy: The 
.secret police would drag him away in a minute 
if they could be sure Radio Liberty would not 
alert his admirers. 
For brave men like Solzheniisyn, who risk 
all for a decent future for Russia, Radio Liberty 
is a candle holding back the totalitarian night. ; 
Sen. FOlbright, for dubious reasons, wants to 
snuff it out. He must not be permitted to do so.

Don't Sacrifice Truth 
There is an element of uncertainty 
. about the future of Radio.Eree Europe 
and Radio Liberty even though the 
broadcasts have funding until June 
. 
O. Funding beyond that date has 
? been blocked by Sen. J. W. Fulbrighl, 
who has characterized the two .radios 
as "relics of the cold war." 
Although RFE-RL broadcasts once 
-iollowed a cold war line, today it is 
generally acknowledged, Sen. Ful-
bright notwithstanding, that the news 
.the radios beam to the peoples in 
.Communist countries is objective. 
Rather than inciting the listeners 
to rebellion, the broadcasts give the 
- only reliable reporting on political, 
ee0110MiC, cultural and sports events 
? available to people who live in socie-
ties whose news media are carefully 
....managed by the state. 
It seems to a great many people in 
Europe as well as in this country that 
' Sen. Fulbright is overreacting in his 
-stated desire to help foster a spirit of 
detente. 
? A reporter for the Christian Science 
Monitor found nearly every major 
'newspaper in Western Europe urging 
the preservation of these media. 
"Why," one European observer 
was quoted as asking, "should the 
radios be shut down simply because 
they irritate the Soviets? Have the 
Russians stopped building up their 
1 
military power because this alarms.. 
us?" 
A Russian writer who escaped to 
Britain, Anatoli Kuznetsov, said that 
closing the two stations would be 
cheered by the KGB, Soviet govern-
ment intelligence, as fulfillment of 
, one of its most ardent wishes. 
Kuznetsov said he and other Rus-
sian intellectuals depended on foreign 
stations for honest reporting. And he 
said of all the broadcasts, RFE-RL 
alone are not devoted to building up 
the image of the country sponsoring 
the broadcasts. 
. . 
RFE alone is reported to have an 
audience of an estimated 55 million. 
. It is no secret that the Russians 
would like to sec the end of the broad-
casts, especially since they go to con-
siderable trouble to try and jam the 
broadcasts. 
? 
But detente at this point is an elu-
sive goal that will not be brought sig-
nificantly .closer by merely eliminat-
ing these radios. The stations are peb-
bles compared to the mountains that 
obstruct progress toward detente. 
. 
The ? fact that the Soviets are so ve-
hemently opposed to the objective re-
porting of news to the Russian people 
also says something about the nature 
of the societies with which we are 
dealing and chills prospects of the 
two countries being able to resolve 
their differences. 
The Russian government still wants 
to tell its people what it wants them 
to know. This doesn't suggest that 
Russia herself has moved away from a 
cold war attitude. 
We shouldn't have to make all the 
concessions for detente and R.FE-RL 
---- should not be sacrificed simply as a 
polite gesture. Congress should insist 
that the two radios have the funds to 
continue beaming their messages of 
truth.

The stations serve a useful pur-

programming. When they play 
the news straight without hard 
' sell prOpagandizing, these stations 
perform a service which contrasts 
? remarkably with the state run ra-
dio of the Communist states. 
Whether HEE has been ,used to 
sem the interests of the CIA we 
don't know. There ought not be 
any link to the CIA. News of con-
ditions behind the Curtain is of-
ten passed on by recent arrivals 
who have fled Eastern Europe. 
When some of these help to staff 
the stations, the anti-Communist 
viewpoint understandably at 
times becomes fairly strong. One 
would expect this from those fa-
miliar with terror and repression. 
By the same token, the word 
of these brave souls may be more 
accurate in some instances than 
the more established sources. 
When troops are cut back and 
withdrawn, RFT and Radio Liber-
ty may be all that is left in this 
part of the world. These voices 
ought not be silenced yet.

U.S. Sen. J. William Fulbright is 
elected by the people of Arkansas and. 
held accountable at the polls only to 
them. But, what he does often affects 
us all. This consistent opponent of the 
President's foreign policy is now in the 
process of choking off the only voices 
of freedom available to Communist-
controlled peoples. 
. These voices are Radio Free Eu-
rope, which broadcasts messages of 
freedom and. truth to people in Eastern 
Europe, and Radio Liberty, which car-
ries the same message to people in the 
Soviet Union. 
' "Now after 20 years of such in-
'dispensable service," reports Rep. 
Gene Snyder, "it appears that these 
:two voices of liberty are going to have 
'to shut down. . 
- "But should these broadcasts cease, 
It will not be because Congress has de-
cided they have become useless. On 
the contrary, both houses of Congress 
have already approved a continuation 
of the programs. Since the bill passed 
.by the House differed from that ap-
proved by the Senate, it was necessary 
.,.. . 
Voke of Fraidoni 
to send the bills to a House-Senate con-
ference committee to reconcile the dif-
ference. 
"It has been the opposition of three 
of the five senators in that conference, 
. led by Fulbright, that has led to the 
present stalemate. 
"Senator Fulbright, chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, - 
has refused to accept any compromise. ? 
"So the legislation is stuck ? and 
without congressional authorization 
and provision of necessary funds, 
these two programs can not be contin-
ued," according to Congressman Sny-
der. 
Thus it appears that Senator Ful-
bright and his allies have made good 
their boast that they expiration of 
the existing authority as an opportun-
ity to kill these programs. . 
The senator from Arkansas, in so 
doing, has -thwarted a program be-
lieved important to people in other 
states. But, then Fulbright has to an-
swer only to the voters in Arkansas ? 
and Radio Free Europe and Radio Lib-
erty aren't among their prime con- , 
cerns.

Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are two of the most effective 
weapons in the western arsenal. Neither can be stopped by bullets 
or bombast. Unfortunately, Senator J. W. Fulbright doesn't share 
that view. 
Senator Fulbright contends both are relics of the "cold war." He 
thinks they are no longer necessary. As a result, he has effectively 
stymied further progress of legislation to continue financing of both 
services. What jamming and bullets couldn't achieve, Senator Fulbright 
may accomplish through fiscal strangulation. 
In a nation founded on the principle of providing free and open speech, 
such suggestions seem strange. Coming from a Senator, whose colleagues 
pride themselves on their right and ability to filibuster, the. 
pronouncement is incredible. 
KCBS can't agree with Senator Fulbright's position. Rather than shut 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty down, we ought to expand such 
services. A free idea is a very lethal weapon against demagogues 
and dictators. 
We are continually told that America is misunderstood abroad. To 
eliminate a possible link with many parts of the world, where the lack 
of free ideas have contributed to that misunderstanding, is not only 
folly, but it strikes us also as rather poor foreign relations.

editorial: 
WAVES OF THE AIRWAVES 
by Alexandre Bruggmann 
"If we happen to learn anything about events in our country, it is 
through Radio Liberty", said Alexander Solzhenitsyn recently. And he said 
this after having criticized the lack of objectivity of the Soviet press in 
which, what is worse, not much useful information can ever be found. 
Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe are American radios sta 
tioned in Federal Germany and directed toward the countries of Eastern 
Europe. Their (future) existence is in doubt, assured only through June. 
After that date, everything will depend upon the Nixon government's at-
titude in face of proposals coming from a group of senators headed by 
Mr. Fulbright. 
He and his friends, along with a handful of West German Social 
Democrats, believe that broadcasting a program of information and com-
mentary in the languages of the East European is irreconcilable with a 
policy of detente. 
Created at a time when East-West relations were particularly bad, 
Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe have had a double goal from the outset. 
While, on the one hand, they were charged with the task of transmitting 
information (otherwise) unavailable to those countries with a (state-) directed 
press, they also had to make outright propagan.da. 
It is undeniable that the two radios were partly responsible for 
certain illusions about possible Western support in case of "rebellion", for 
circulating rumors, notably, on the occasion of the workers' uprising in 
East Berlin or on the occasion of what Moscow called the Hungarian "counter-
revolution" of 1956. The populations were incited over the (air)waves to 
"shake off the yoke." 
For over ten years now the broadcasts to Eastern Europe have lost 
this dubious propaganda function. Even after the Czechoslovak events, no 
one in Moscow or Prague sought to incriminate the radios which, after their 
-grave initial errors, contented themselves with broadcasting and commenting 
on verified information. 
In those states (Eastern Europe), where the audio-visual as well 
as the written press are direct voices of an all-powerful apparatus, there

can no longer exist a question of information in the sense we understand 
this term. Every news item published becomes an element of a certain 
kind of opiate for the masses. This is why radio broadcasts coming from 
another source make sense for the populations of the East. (Such broad-
'casts) enable them to keep alive the freedom of judgment which is being 
throttled by unilateral information. 
In private, high functionaries of this or that member country of 
the Warsaw Pact readily admit listening to Liberty in order to know what 
really goes on in the Soviet Union. Also, the East is far from being homo-
geneous, and the two threatened radios enable the very-much-alive national con-
sciousnesss to keep their reasons for existence: to this end, it is sufficient 
to be genuinely informed. 
At a moment when the clandestine press is getting such wings in 
the Soviet Union, is it really necessary to cease giving, from the outside, 
the kind of information to which the populations have a right? Does it mean 
carrying on a cold war to give indispensable elements to the exercise (of 
the right) of freedom of thought?

Pronouncement by West German Student Organization "RCDS" 
April 13, 1972 
NOTE: The Circle of Christian Democratic Students (RCDS), a student 
organization loosely affiliated to the CDUonnounced in Bonn April 13 
that its chairman, Gerd Langguth, had written to Chancellor 
Brandt on the same date, expressing concern about the future of RFE 
and Radio Liberty. (Despite its CDU ties, RCDS has often disagreed 
with the Party! For example, it has expressed qualified support for the 
treaties with Moscow and Warsaw treaties negotiated by the Brandt Govern-
ment. ) Following is a translation of the ?RCDS press release: 
On the basis of letters from East Bloc students to the Ring 
Christlich-Demokratis cher Studenten (RCDS), expressing concern, Gerd 
Langguth, Federal Chairman of the RCDS, today addressed a letter to 
Federal Chancellor Brandt. In this appeal, Chancellor Brandt is called 
upon to use his influence on behalf of the maintenance of the two radio 
stations Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe, since the cries of distress 
from East Bloc students to the RCDS have shown that these two broadcasting 
stations represent the sole possibility of contact with the Free West, 
especially for many young people. 
The letter added: it is precisely for this reason that we regard 
it as more than regrettable that some SPD Bundestag deputies have urged 
that the broadcasting licenses for these two radio stations should no longer 
be renewed." 
The RCDS would have especially welcomed action by Brandt to end 
the speculation about these two radios, and to make clear the interest of 
the Federal Government that inhabitants of the East Bloc should continue 
to receive information from the Free West. " 
In his letter to the Chancellor, Langguth also clearly endorsed 
free expression of opinion for the two radio stations which - according to 
several recent speculations - may possibly no longer be guaranteed, under 
conditions of "political good conduct" which might be imposed upon them in 
dealing with the policy of the Federal Government.

article: 
FATEFUL MISTAKES 
by Salvador Madariaga 
Even the honest efforts of the most enlightened men in public life in 
the USA were not able to save the operation of the two radio stations, Radio 
Free Europe and Radio Liberty, from being silenced. Senator Fulbright 
was not willing to grant them more than a grace period of a few months, and 
thus the United States, should nothing happen by June of this year, will have 
committed one of its most fateful mistakes. 
Freedom Stations  
It would be superfluous to point out these two stations' worthwhile 
achievements. Their most important task consists in keeping alive, intel-
lectually and morally, millions of Europeans who otherwise would vegetate 
aAgray in the enormous prison represented by the Soviet Union and its European 
colonies. The two radio stations make it possible for these people to partic-
ipate not only in the daily life of the West but in that of the entire world --
including the Soviet Union, whose news service serves more to mask and 
manipulate than to inform. This fact is so obvious that I do not wish to deal 
further with it here, particularly because my topic today deals with another 
question. 
It is a matter of pointing out and investigating a noteworthy state of 
affairs: namely, that the author of the plan to silence (the stations) mentioned 
at the outset is in no way a fool, but rather an unusually bright man. Wherein 
lies the explanation of such an enormous paradox? The answer will emerge 
in the course of investigating the arguments which Senator Fulbright himself 
advances. 
The first argument says that no nation should interfere in the internal 
affairs of another nation. Without a doubt, this has for ages been an excellent 
principle for international behavior, but it long ago lost its effectiveness. 
--- 
At the time when President (and) General Washington formulated it, it took 
months for the ideas propagated in New York to reach Russia. Today, this 
? 
takes place in split seconds. The world has shrunk and its public opinion has 
become a unified, entity. The main object of the contemporary battle is the 
winning of hearts with the help of words.

-2-
Senator Fulbright, however, appears to be of the opinion that it is 
a matter of territory and weapons. That is the root of his error. By having 
the two stations silenced, he disarms the nations of the West and discourages 
the peoples of Eastern Europe. And he is not likely to consider the fact that 
-- when he condemns Russia's intellectual breath to suffocation -- he is 
interfering just as much in Russia's internal affairs as if he were not doing so. 
In the final analysis, he would be doing so only to an even greater extent, for 
speaking the truth does not represent interference for the country to which 
it is directed; but to permit a nation to be misled represents interference in 
the freedom of a people. Therefore, Senator Fulbright's first argument is 
untenable. 
The second reason that he cites says that the two stations are con-
tinuing a cold war which has already ended. Of all self-deceptions, this is 
probably the most fantastic. For the rejection of the liberal system in the 
West on the part of the Soviet Union is absolute, and the cold war can only be 
ended in one of the following three ways: either through the conversion of 
Russia to a form of liberal socialism or through the conquering of Europe 
by the Red Army, which would force Communism on the West with gunbarrels, 
or by a series of (more or less spontaneous) revolutions along Cuban or 
Chilean lines, such as Berlinguer is preparing in Italy with his remarkable 
imitation of Cavour. In the meantime, the Soviet Union protects its public 
opinion from the consequences of the truth by locking up its dissidents and, 
with the help of Fulbright, taking the air and the light of the West away from 
its people. Thus, the second argument is untenable. 
Stalin Refused  
The third says that one should make concessions to the Soviet Union 
and in this way contribute to detente. If, however, one were to ask Senator 
Fulbright when the Soviet Union ever made a concession in the last fifty years, 
he would find himself in a very uncomfortable pinch indeed. Besides, there is 
tension from the East vis-a-vis the West. But from the West to East, there 
is none. 
When the USA called into being the Marshall Plan, it offered its benefits 
to the Soviet Union as well. Stalin rejected this and in addition forced Czecho-
slovakia to turn down the assistance. The West has repeatedly shown that as 
far as it is concerned no tension exists vis-a-vis the Soviet Union -- while 
the exact opposite is true in the case of the Soviet Union, for it itself causes 
the tension. The United States only armed itself because the Soviet Union 
forced it to through its own collection of weapons. 
And then there's still the iron curtain and the Berlin wall. What do 
they prove? In the West, there is no tension vis-a-vis the East; any resident 
of the West can go to the East through the curtain and the wall - assuming

Approved For Release 2001/03/04 :_CIA:RDP80-01101R001100070001-5 
that he is let in. But the tension prevailing in the East against the West is 
so strong that no one from the East zone is allowed into the West, and if he 
goes anyway, he is shot. 
Lack of Understanding 
Therefore, Senator Fulbright's disastrous plan and his inflexible 
blindness show a catastrophic lack of understanding of the true state of affairs: 
- he thinks the cold war is over, while it is more alive than ever; 
- he thinks it is (or was) a war in which the conquering of territory 
by means of weapons was involved (which could, by the way, still happen), 
while it is here a matter of winning hearts with words and brains; 
- he thinks we should make concessions in the interest of "relaxation 
of tensions", while there is in fact only one single tension, namely the one 
which the Soviet Union purposely causes in its relations with the West; 
- he thinks that the East in a homogeneous world, while it is really 
divided: into an upper level of governments -- against the West -- and a lower 
level of the governed -- with the West. 
One can hut wonder how it is possible that a bright and honest man 
can stray so far from the path of reality. Probably because there are many 
people who permit themselves to be misled by the very clever campaign of 
confusion with slogans like "cold war", detente, iron curtain, with this whole 
pointless and meaningless language. 
The Senator is in large, if not good, company, and the source of 
confusion which led him not only to approve of but to encourage the intel-
lectual suffocation of the peoples of Eastern Europe is the same as that 
which led Federal Chancellor Brandt -- another intelligent and honest man 
to believe that, with those dubious treaties, he was working for peace. 
In both cases, it is not the eyes, but the (good) sense which has been struck 
blind.

Poles Aid Drive Against 
THE PRESENT drive to 
end vital U.S. government 
subsidies for Radio Free Eu-
:rope (RFE) is being aided by 
tt clandestine operation of the 
Polish Communist Party, ac-
.cording to a confidential re-
port: from a reliable inform-
antlinside Poland. 
This informant reports that 
the now deposed regime of 
-.then party boss Wladyslaw 
Gomulka about two years ago 
became dissatisfied with the 
lack of action on RFE, the 
Munich-based station which 
beams broadcasts. to Poland 
and other Eastern European 
Communist states. Conse-
quently, it set up a secret 
group to "systematically in-
stigate opposition tow ard 
RFE", with $3 million funnel-
ed into Poland's Washington 
embassy. 
? In charge of the operation, 
according to this report, is 
Ryszard Frelek, a member of 
the party secretariat. Besides 
stirring up opposition, it was 
:charged with responsibility 
for supplying helpful infor-
mation to American foes of 
-,RFE. 
Serious American students 
of the Polish -situation doubt 
that anything close to $3 mil-
lion was appropriated for this 
!purpose. However. the in-
formant's past record is good 
enough to make the outlines 
of the story credible. 
? Actually, .anti-RFE opera-
tions in Warsaw remained 
strictly secret until February 
when rumors began pouring 
out. "It is assumed that they 
were started by former Go-
mulka men . who were re-
moved from this project," the 
informant reports. 
However, he adds that 
there is divided opinion deep 
inside the Polish United 
Workers' Party?the coun-
try's Communist party?about 
BEE. In party discussions, he 
says, it is noted RFE not 
only "creates many problems 
for the party leadership" but 
also provides some benefits. 
Without RFE, almost all 
seem to agree, Soviet instruc-
tions would , be more strict 
and also there would be a 
trend to fall in line with oth-
er Soviet republics," he adds. 
A footnote: The informant 
reveals that party secretary 
Jerzy Lukaszewicz recently 
called in the heads of Po-
land's newspapers and radio 
stations to caution them not 
to go overboard in praising 
Sen. J. W. Fulbright's drive 
against RFE. "The mass 
media in Poland should use 
only information from the 
+ 
Polish press agency without 
any embellishment of their 
own," according to the in-
formant. 
McGovern Dilemma 
SEN. GEORGE Mc-
Govern, father of the re-
forms that have revolution-
ized the Democratic national 
convention structure, is say-
ing privately that he does not 
approve of efforts by his fol-
lowers to unseat the Chicago 
delegates of Mayor Richard 
J. Daley. 
ironically, the Chicago 
challenge is viewed nation-
ally by anti-organization 
Democrats as a lest. case for 
rigorous enforcement of dele-
gate guidelines adopted by 
the McGovern commission. 
But McGovern, now not 
merely a reformer but a 
front-runner ?for the . Demo-
cratic presidential nomina-
tion, does not wish to alien-
ate Daley. 
The challenge against 53 
uncommitted Chicago dele-
gates and six more in the 
suburbs who were elected in 
the March 21 Illinois primary 
,is based on the charge that 
they were hand-picked and 
supported by the mayor's reg-
ular party organization in de-
fiance of McGovern commis-
sion guidelines. Alderman 
William Singer; a McGovern 
supporter who is heading the 
challenge, was told by two 
McGovern aides weeks ago 
that he definitely would have 
the senator's support. 
They were wrong. Al-
though he has made no pub- . 
lic declaration, McGovern 
privately is inclined against 
supporting the challenge be-
cause the Daley delegates 
were elected by the public?
most of them 'without opposi-
tion from McGovern slates. 
But beyond that, McGovern 
hopes that Daley, whose dis-
taste for Sen. Hubert. Hum-
phrey is well known, might' 
chose McGovern in a Mc-
Govern-Humphrey confronta-
tion. Such an endorsement 
could erode anti-McGovern 
feeling by other key party 
regulars, such as Pete Camiel 
of !Philadelphia. 
However, McGovern now 
will be pressured by his fol-
lowers to, publicly endorse 
the. Chicago challenge. Their 
argument: Failure to do so 
would demoralize Democrats 
around the country who, un-
like Daley, have scrupulously 
and painfully followed the 
McGovern commission guide-
lines. In effect, they argue,. 
McGovern would be. destroy- ? 
ing his own creation.

. Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty 
have been granted a stay of execution, 
but their life hangs by a thread. 
Their future, literally, is in the hands 
of the A mericap people. 
If by June 30 the public hasn't made it 
quite plain by floods of letters and tele-
grams to their senators that they want 
the two stations to continue to broad-
cast to the people behind the Iron Cur-
tain, the tWo major Western radio voices 
will be silenced. It's as simple as that. 
Without a masshe letter-writing 
? effort, the Senate Iv ill not override

mined to end the Munich-based op-
erations.

ligence Agency had been providing' most 
of the money for the two stations. Since 
then they have been funded publicly by 
Congress. Now Foreign Relations Com-
mittee Chairman Fulbright has balked. 
He has agreed to appropriate funds only 
until June 30. ? 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty 
"are Cold War relics," Fulbright says. 
They will continue to function after 
June 30, he adds, over his "dead body." 
The senator's attitude has caused a 
furor not only in the United States, 
but in other parts of the world. While 
the Soviet bloc is overjoyed, the Con-
gressional Record carries page after 
page of editorials and statements from 
Western Europe deploring Fulbright's 
stand. 
President Nixon has expressed con-
cern. 
A bi-partisan citizen's committee, 
including leaders in the field of finance 
and industry, former government of-
ficials and diplomats, teachers and labor 
leaders has been formed to support the 
stations. 
Millions of ethnics, especially 
those from the Eastern European 
target area, have conveyed through 
their leaders their pleas that the 
broadcasting continue. 
Some 57 senators have signed a reso-
lution presented by Sen. Charles Percy 
(R.-Ill.) and Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey 
(D.-Minn.) asking for the preservation 
of RFE and Radio Liberty. This augurs 
well, but any such action must go 
through the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. 
Fulbright is not likely ? to change his 
mind unless a massive outpouring of 
opinion from every corner of the United 
States makes the Senate conscious of 
the public mood. 
The time is short. ?

The'General Was a Spy 
by Heinz Tiohne and Hermann Zolling 
STATINTL 
(Coward, McCann & Geoghegan; $8.95). . 
A year before Winston Churchill's "Iron 
Curtain" speech in Fulton, Missouri, 
which formally stated the theme of Act I 
of the Cold War, a prologue was being 
written and played backstage in Europe 
by Americans and Germans. They had 
already identified Soviet Communism 
as Enemy Number One, not primarily 
because Russia had Eastern Europe in 
its grip, but because Soviet Commu-
nism was satanic and was set on con-
quering the world. And as Hugh Trevor-
Roper remarks in his introduction to" 
The General Was a Spy, "it is legitimate 
to use Beelzebub to drive out Satan." 
Beelzebub was willing. Both these spy 
stories describe how and why, with the 
collapse of the German armies, the 
Americans recruited Hitler's Chief of 
Intelligence .against the Soviet Union 
and underwrote his postwar espionage 
operations. 
Reinhard Gehlen was a professional, 
an experiensed, single-minded anti-
Communist with exceptional contacts. 
Those who hired him were not of the 
breed of Henry Stimson, who once said 
quaintly that gentlemen don't read 
other people's mail. They were what 
came to be called realists, and they 
dominated US foreign policy for the 
next quarter of a century. The US gov-
ernment secretly financed General Geh-
len to the amount of $200 million, and 
when he finally left his American super-
visors and went to work directly for the 
Bonn government, Mr. Cookbridge tells 
us, Allen Dulles gave him "a golden 
handshake in appreciation of the great 
work he had done for CIA; a gratuity of 
250,000 marks had been authorized. 
Dulles added the not entirely seridusly 
meant condition that Gehlen should 
use the money to buy a fine house 
somewhere in the Bavarian mountains." 
For the $200 million,. CI& received 
rnOunthiPPr9M#9.1 ASP FARIMsft 2 
clandestine tips on Eastern Europe and 
the USSR. Toward the end, it learned 
that much of the information was use-
less; and it learned something more 
disturbing: the Gehlen organization had 
been penetrated by the Soviets. By the 
early '60s, Washington's interest had 
cooled. 
The General Was a Spy is drawn from a

journalists for Der Spiegel. Gehlen: Spy 
of the Century is the product of a Euro-
pean educated British journalist who 
was himself an intelligence agent in 
World War II and was imprisoned by 
the Gestapo. Hohne and Zolling offer a

count and focus more sharply on the 
intricacies of the postwar intelligence 
network inside Germany; they are less

on the American involvement and on 
the Nazi backgrounds of Gehlen's 
associates. 
Gehlen served any master who served 
his purpose, which was the undermin-
ing and the destruction of Communism. 
When it could no longer be doubted 
that the German armies were defeated, 
Gehlen' turned to the Werewolfs, the 
young terrorists .who were to carry on 
after Hitler's collapse. The Werewolf 
project had been discussed at one of 
Gehlen's last meetings with the Fuhrer, 
whom Gehlen found "most charming." 
They had also discussed Hitler's order 
that "gramophone records with sound 
effects of combat noise and rolling tanks 
. . . be distributed to front line com-
mands and played from dugouts as near 
as possible to the Soviet lines." Hitler 
was mad, Gehlen was not. Yet Gehlen 
accepted this. order, as all the others, 
knowing it was too late to stave off 
disaster, but obedient to authority.

he intended-to surrender at a price. He 
met with Brigadier General Edwin L.

American Zone, who (report Hohne and 
Zolling) "while fighting was still in 
progress in France . . . had been pre-
Tared to make use of Adolf Hitler's 
officers in the cause of 'American strat-

Sibert promptly took up with General

By JERRY GREENE 
Washington, April 17 ? Neither Secretary of State 
William P. Rogers nor the Senate Foreign Relations Corn-
. 
mittee probed even once today on the basic reason for 
bombing Haiphong and Hanoi?the necessity felt at the 
White House to counter a new power thrust by Russia. 
? As a revived sounding board for a thunderous blast at the 
'administration's Vietnam policies, the committee session fell on its 
face by comparison with the productions of earlier years. 
? Rogers would not be cowed by Sen. 
3. William Fulbright (D-Ark.), the 
Bomb Message vitriolic chairman, nor would he back 
off an inch to give aid and comfort to 
Really Aimed _ Sen. Stuart Symington (1)-Mo.) in his 
efforts to hang the President on the 
campaign oratory of 1968. The corn-
?. At the Kremlin . mittee's war critics, a majority of the 
membership, were subdued somewhat 
. 
after Sen. George Aiken (R-Vt.) de-
serted their ranks for emotional support of the President. 
' The .Rogers defense, delivered off the cuff but obviously well 
rehearsed, was along expected, oft-used lines: to protect U.S. troops, 
to assure continued withdrawal of Gls, and to help the South Viet-
namese-protect themselves. 
But Rogers did not, nor could 
he have done so, as the nation's 
chief diplomat, make any mention 
of what for many months has 
been the cause of principal con-
cern to the foreign policy experts. 
This has been ?the open, almost 
reckless, and certainly aggressive 
inclination of the -government in 
the Kremlin to push Communist 
influence in any direction where 
a weakness was spotted. 
This Soviet policy, evident in 
Egypt, in Syria, in India and the 
Indian Ocean, in the eastern Medi-
terranean, seems to have escaped 
the notice of Chairman Fulbright. 
The senator, in commenting 
on the bombing, told Rogers: "I, 
for one, cannot possibly under-
stand what consideration war-
ranted these drastic measures." 
? Fulbright, of course, has uni-
laterally declared the cold war 
ended during his efforts to shut 
down Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty; no such signs of 
armistice have come out of Mos-
cow yet. 
Rogers could have told the 
committee under other circumstances, and the information is readily 
available at several points in the capital, that Russia began deliver-
ing to North Vietnam the heavy and sophisticated arms required for 
conventional offensive warfare just 12 months ago. 
Sen. J. William Fulbright 
The motive escapes him 
Back during the air strike days of 1967-68 the Russians had 
supplied Hanoi with powerful defensive armaments, surface-to-air 
missiles and radar-directed automatic antiaircraft artillery. But the 
heavy artillery, the tanks and the armored personnel carriers for 
.frontal assault did not appear in Haiphong Harbor until early last 
spring, 
? , Caused Months of Worry 
This development of an offensive conventional war capability 
by the North Vietnamese has been a worrisome thing for the 
American officials for many months. They had been expecting the 
assault when United States ground troops were reduced to a small 
forPA, ? 0.

a,k.igIA-RDP80-01601.R001100070001-5 
climbed back to $100 million in 1972. 
? The Soviet push in tlia;Middle East and in India and Bangladesh 
had been an unbroken stride by-the Russians as they continued the 
preparations for the Hanoi offensive. 
This Kremlin foreign policy movement, everywhere opportunity 
presented itself, appeared to be reaching ominous proportions, 
despite the simultaneous steps toward easier relations with the U.S. 
and Western Europe. 
What would appear to be a hopeless contradiction to a free-
world mind was a state of affairs quite acceptable to the Kremlin 
Communists; Hanoi was quite clearly going along with the pro-
claimed doctrine of the late Ho Chi Minh that a time of negotia-
tions was the time to improve one's military position for a climactic 
blow. 
What They Need From West 
Additionally, it is believed here that Russia, for internal rea-
sons, badly needs an accord with the West; the Soviets want an 
easing of tension between East and West Germany; they want 
urgently a trade agreement with the U.S., and, now that they have 
parity or better in nuclear weapons, they want the strategic arms 
limitation pact to cut the costs of the missile race. 
As a specific example, Russia is woefully short of feed grain' 
for livestock. Agriculture Secretary Earl L. Butz has been exploring 
the possibility of selling $200 million a year worth of grain to the 
Soviets, who quite naturally want long-term, cheap credit, 
With President Nixon urgently in pursuit of peace through 
summitry, with the election year hampering his reactions through 
domestic pressures, the Russians felt smug and secure in promoting 
the Hanoi plans for invasion and a Saigon knockout. 
Thus, apart from the needs of the battlefield, the necessity for 
smashing the supply dumps supporting the 12-division invasion, 
Nixon became convinced that only a spectacular, dramatic response 
would in turn impress the Kremlin with the seriousness with which 
we regarded the Soviet play at brinkmanship. 
Offie4als here believe the'tRussians are ?fgetting the message, 
?1iwill leave it to Hanoi to salvage what it can Of the invasion

Robert White's artitle on 
Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty was inter-
esting, and his advocacy of 
continued funding for the 
stations on the basis of 
!good programming a n d 
large audiences is under-
standable, but there are 
questions more profound 
that need to be asked. 
? 
Integrity of government in 
dealing with its citizens is 
also at stake, as well as the 
Imore practical diplomatic 
problem posed by Ameri-
can installations in friend-
ly foreign nations promot-
n g anti-Soviet propa-
ganda. 
The prime grievance we all 
should have against RFE 
and RL stems from their. 
'long deception of the. 
American people. For more 
. than 20 years the opera-
tions were billed as volun-
tary enterprises supported 
? by the contributions of 
Americans. Advertising, 
: particularly by RFE, was 
always urgently directed 
. tciward Americans to help 
bring "truth" to the pris-
oners of communism. 
'Both organizations: we re 
, set up as corporations with 
big-name Americans- on 
their letterheads as a blind 
to hide their true source.of 
:- ? 
, .support. And while the 
deception was an open 
secret among well-in-
formed people, the conspir-
..sacy of political silence was 
- total until Sen. Case 
.dis-
closed their CIA funding. 
-Another part of the decep-
tion has been the use of 
-prominent American trav-
elers and scholars behind 
the Iron Curtain as inform-
ants for RFE and RL: Many 
such trips, supposedly in-
' nocent of espionage, were 
sponsored by and paid for 
. from CIA funds, using RFE 
and RL as fronts for peo-
?t: pie doing "research." 
A good deal of the scholar-
ship and research gener-
1.atecl1n support of RFE and 
RL has always been CIA-
funded. I suppose that 
many of the people who 
performed the tasks were 
not fully aware of the iden-
tity of their sponsors. 
It is these peripheral ac-
tivities of RFE and RL I 
believe to be the most cor-
rupting, because they 
strike at the very root of 
intellectual integrity. 
It may be true, as White 
says, that RFE and RL 
have large followings be-
hind the Iron Curtain, but 
they are not the only for-
eign broadcasters to ? the 
Communist world, nor are 
they necessarily the best. 
VBC certainly was, and I 
hope still is, .extremely 
effective. 
Another difficulty with 
the two stations, now that 
t:h e i r cover has been 
"blown," is that they are 
official foreign installa-
tions disturbing to the po-
litical sovereignty of the 
host nations. When the 
pretense could be main-
tained that RFE and RL 
were private and not relat-
ed to the U.S. government, 
host nations could ignore 
Soviet protests. This they 
now will find difficult. 
RFE and RL are headquar-
tered in Munich, but some 
of their transmitters are 
located in places other 
than West Germany. How 
can such countries openly 
accommodate those broad-
cast facilities, which are 
so unremittingly hostile to 
Soviet interests? 
How would we feel if the 
Soviets had a series of 
powerful transmitters in 
Mexico, spilling Soviet 
propaganda into the Unit-
- ? 44: v6,4-7.1?:`4,!4 
ecewe 
- 
ed States? Can West Ger-
many now continue to 
permit those troublesome 
installations to remain 
within its borders when 
the West German govern-
ment is trying to heal 
some of the wounds of 
World War 'II? Surely So-
viet negotiators have a 
good argument in dealing 
with German officials. 
erica 
I hold no brief for the So-
viet paranoia about free 
circulation of news, but I 
think that justification of 
the expense of maintain-
ing RFE and RL is pretty 
shaky, both in the light of 
past ineffectiveness in al-
tering Soviet policy and in 
the light of present availa-
bility of a great many pro-. ? 
grams from the radio sta-
tions of other nations, in-
;eluding our own Voice of 
America?Ervin J. Gaines,

BONN? RadioFree Europe 
and Radio Liberty may be 
ander fir4 from Sen. J. William 
Fulbright (D-Ark.), West 
German members of 
parliament and communist east 
i Europe, but officials here have 
'clarified that there is no West 
German-American plan to shut 
the.stations down. 
A misinterpretation,' 
, however, has sprung up in the 
'West German press over a 
;statement by Bonn government 
press spokesman Conrad Alders 
' that the two governments are 
"in contact" about the work of 
' the stations, which broadcast 
Into east Europe. 
"I'm sure he meant we are in 
Iconstant touch on the stations 
and their operations," an 
American embassy spokesman 
said. -But we are not discussing 
the question of opening or 
closing the stations." 
1 Ahlers explained today that 
' ?he "never said they were new 
contacts." 
But that impression was 
given following the 
announcement that eight 
members of chancellor Willy 
, Brandt's Social Democratic 
; Party had sent telegrams to 
? Brandt and President Nixon 
asking that the stations be 
'closed down after June 30. That 
' is the date temporary funding 
for the former CIA-backed 
stations ends. 
? Sen. Fulbright has led the
congressional fight against 
President Nixon's plans for 
open government support of the 
? stations. 
The telegrams will fuel the 
?Fulbright campaign, though .1 
:  ' 
they are an embarrassment to 
.Brandt. The Bonn government 
has supported the stations even ., 
though they are sharply' 
' attacked 'by the east European 
.governments with whom 
Brandt is trying to improve 
relations through his ostpolitik. 
"The Bonn government , I 
/I 
1 
for the dissemination of free 
information to the people in the 
east bloc.," ,Ahlers said in his 
statement. "On the other hand 
'it is concerned that the 
programs of the stations should 
not set back the development of 
West Germany's foreign 
relations." 
The. eight members of 
parliament ? mostly young, 
liberal and outspoken?argued 
in their telegrams that Radio 
Free Europe and Radio Liber-
ty, are a "stumbling block" to 
German foreign policy. They 
said the presence of the 
American-controlled stations 
"raises doubles about the 
sovereignty" of West Germany. 
They suggested that the stations ' 
be turned over to the Deutsche 
We lie, a German international 
broadcasting service. 
Two stations operate on 
licenses granted by the West 
German government. Offices 
? 
and studios are located in 
Munich and most of the 
transmitter facilities are also 
here in West Germany. 
? The licenses are renewed 
every year in July, 
automatically unless one party 
or the other raises an objection. 
:And American embassy 
officials say there has never 
been any question raised about' 
renewing the licenses. :

t.. ONE OF THOSE bones of 
t'contention calculated to cre-
ate the utmost ill will is be-
fore the Congress with the 
path to final decision sown 
;with booby traps. The ques-
Won, is whether Radio Free 
[Europe is a vestige of the 
I Cold War that should be 
closed out in light of the ' 
l:new Nixon approach to the 
Soviet Union or whether it 
Is an invaluable window to 
the West for the peoples of 
:the Soviet Union and East-
;ern Europe fed solely on 
government propaganda. 
. ?It is .an issue freighted 
-with all the fears and suspi-
'cions of the past; the tra-
gedy of refugees who have 
iseen their homelands turn-
led into prisons by Commun- ? 
? ist walls. Passionate parti-
sans of RFE scoff at econo-
mizing by cutting off the s3p 
million fo . rthe operaton. 
? Their villain is J. William 
? Fulbright (D-Ark.), chairman 
of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, who sup-
ported a bill providing 
;funds for RFE only until the 
June 30 end of the fiscal 
year. After that date its fu- ; 
!ture is uncertain, unless the 
administration acts quickly 
to push a new status for a 
further appropriation. 
Fulbright points out that 
!,the cutoff date was ini-
? tiated by Sen. Clifford 
Case of New Jersey, a ? 
Republican member of the 
Foreign Relations Commit--
tee. While Case is not enthu-
' siastic about RFE, he would 
not oppose continuing it if 
some new framezork could 
be established. 
Here, in my opinion, is an 
example of-Ahtscistc,ofjail: 
Approved For Release 
ing to grapple with a long-
? ou_tmoded condition and 
simply letting drift take 
over. The Central Intelli-
gence Agency provided the 
money for RFE for many 
? years in a semi-secret fash-
ion, A facade that public 
contributions supported 
both RFE and Radio Liberty 
was just that, since most of 
the money came from the 
? CIA. 
THE . TIME had long 
passed for the CIA to be in 
the ? business of operating a 
semi-clandestine propaganda 
station based in Munich. 
With the facts about the 
CIA's involvement revealed, 
. the moment was at hand to 
? face up and ask Congress 
for -a direct appropriation. . 
The House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee initiated a 
bill, later passed by the 
House, setting up a semi-
governmental corporation to 
operate the two stations for 
. a trial period of two years. 
That proposal died in con-
ference when the conferees 
accepted the Case compro-
mise for a June 30 cutoff. 
What is the value of the 
broadcasts that RFE beams 
to the Soviet Union and the 
satellite states? Here intan-
gibles galore enter in. The 
passionate partisans insist - 
that. the broadcasts keep 
? al.ve. the hope of dissent. 
The legislative reference 
? branch of the Congress 
made a favorable report 
? which Senator Fulbright put 
in the Congressional Rec-
ord. 
But doubters believe the 
, broadcasts are an irritant 
that stiffens the resistance 
. of Communist governments 
2001 /03/04 : CIA-RDP80-0 
to any dissent and makes 
the lives of the dissenters 
even harsher than they 
would otherwise be. When 
Secretary of State William 
P. Rogers was before the . 
committee, Fulbright repeat-
edly sought to draw him out 
on whether RFE and Radio 
? Liberty were an impediment 
to any understanding with 
the Soviet Union. Rogers 
. cited the series of agree-
ments currently in ? the 
works, including the two-
year cultural agreement just 
signed. 
? THE CIA stopped funding 
the stations July 1, 1971, and 
the order from the top was 
to have no further connec-
tion with their operation. 
The CIA had done a study 
at the request of the Office 
of Management and Budget 
in the White House dealing 
solely with the cost of liqui-
dating the operation. This 
would be considerable, since 
RFE has 2,000 employees, 
the Majority refugees and 
many advancad in years. 
Why shouldn't Germany 
' Share a part of the cost of 
, the 'stations that broadcast 
' from German soil? Or 
NATO? 
There is a compromise 
which might assuage the 
partisan passions. That is for 
Congress to vote funds for 
an additional six months of 
operation beyond June 30. 
During that time a high-
level panel to be named by 
the White House, perhaps 
jointly with Congress. would ? 
evaluate the broadcasts. 
Hopefully, the panel's re-
port would take the whole 
matter out of the shot and 
shell of politics.

They call him "Fulbricht" in 
Czechoslovakia, to rhyme with 
EastGermany's formerStalinoid 
dictator, the ineffable Herr 
Walter Ulbricht. In Poland it's 
"Fulbright-psubrat," or "Ful-
bright-scoundrel." This informa-
tion comes from a front-page 
article in the influential Swiss 
Neue Zuercher Zeitung written 
by the paper's East European 
correspondent, Alexander Korab. Korab thinks 
the name-calling, which is reminiscent of some? 
of the late Senator Joe McCarthy's cracks, 
expresses the prevailing mood of the common 
people of the "East Bloc," who are increasingly 
hostile toward Sen. J. William Fulbright for his 
efforts to kill Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty, the two U.S.-supported stations that 
broadcast the news to countries behind the Iron 
Curtain. 
e In his campaign to liquidate Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty as "relics of the Cold 
' War," Senator Fulbright has said the two 
broadcasting stations are incompatible with 
President Nixon's new Chinese policy, which 
would presumably regard a U.S.-supported 
Radio Free Asia with a base on Taiwan as an 
inconsistency. (There does happen to be a South 
Korean-based outfit called Radio of Free Asia, 
but it raises its money from private citizens in 
,..the U.S. and hence is beyond Fulbright's reach.) 
What Fulbright misses is that Nixon's 
Chinese policy, which takes off from the basic 
? affirmation that Taiwan and mainland China are ' 
parts of a single nation (both Mao Tse-tung and 
,Chiang Kai-shek say so), could not possibly be 
applied to Eastern Europe or to such parts of the 
Soviety empire as the Baltic countries, the 
? Moselm inner Asia region or even the Ukraine. 
These are entities that once had their freedom; 
in sponsoring broadcasts to them, our, 
government is merely recognizing the doctrine 
that separate peoples are entitled to a say in 
their own behalf. 
The animus against Fulbright in Poland and, 
Czechoslovakia, as reported by Alexander 
Korab, corroborates the idea it would take some 
wrenching to turn Nixon's China policy into an 
endorsement of the Brezhnev Doctrine that 
Moscow has a right to send tanks into other 
socialist nations for Soviet nationalist purposes. 
If Fulbright can't see this, he can't see anything. 
No wonder Fulbright now considers Ho Chi Minh 
to have been a nationalist patriot, not a Marxist 
zealot. 
As a matter of record, a majority of 
Fulbright's own colleagues in the Senate think he 
gets blinder by the minute. Working on the 
Senate floor when Fulbright began his recent 
attack on Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, 
Sen. Charles Percy of Illinois soon had 20 
signatures to a resolution supporting the two 
broacasting stations. Sen. Hubert Humphrey put 
his _name to the resolution as a co-sponsor, and 
; the list was quickly enlarged to 57 Senators, 
including all the then-current Democratic 
candidates for the Presidential nomination with 
the single exception of Vance Hartke, who didn't 
happen to be around.

Sen. Fulbright s Latest Beef 
In the dream world in which he 
dwells, Sen. J. William Fulbright of 
Arkansas, chairman of the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee, views Com-
munism as an inoffensive domestic 
experiment, inclined to live and let live 
in such places as the Soviet Union, 
Cuba, China, and Eastern Europe. His 
fantasy, therefore, is that the United 
States should not abrade the sensibilities 
of Communists. 
Mr. Fulbright has taken a bead on 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, 
primarily funded by the American gov-
ernment, which broadcast news which 
people behind the Iron Curtain other-
'wise would not hear. Their objectivity 
has been commended by the Library of 
Congress. 
Fulbright was unsuccessful in trying 
to cut off funds for the stations on the 
ground that they were "relics of the 
Cold War." They have been granted 
enough funds to continue thru June 30 
while Congress considers their future. 
Balked on this front, Fulbright looked 
around and discovered that Sen. James 
Buckley, of the New York Conservative 
Party, ran a short documentary film 
on the Russian armed repression of 
Czechoslovakia in 1968 as part of his 
monthly television report- over a New 
York channel. The film was produced 
by the United States Information Agen-
cy and the senator obtained a copy from 
the National Archives. The quality of 
the film is attested by the fact that it 
won an Oscar in 1969. 
Sen. Fulbright immediately blew the 
whistle, pointing out that the law ex-
cludes domestic exposure of official 
overseas propaganda. Sen. Buckley, 
however, had obtained an opinion from 
the USIA general counsel that the in-
tention of the law [to prevent the USIA 
from becoming a propaganda arm for 
the incumbent political administration] 
could hardly be considered applicable, in 
that the film clearly would have no do-
mestic political impact. 
The Arkansas senator's feelings were 
ruffled further when Bruce Herschen-
sohn, producer of the film for USIA, 
appeared on Buckley's program and, in 
introducing the film, volunteered the 
opinion that Fulbright was "very sim-
plistic, very naive, and stupid" in his 
understanding of propaganda, and that 
he was trying to "downgrade" the USIA 
in his campaign against Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty. 
This proved offensive to Fulbright 
and his adjunct, the New York Times, 
tho we do not recall that either pro-
tested when the USIA waived limita-
tions on domestic showing of "Jacque-
line Kennedy's Asian Journey." Mr. 
Herschensohn has now resigned as di-
rector of the USIA motion picture and 
television division, but says he believes 
his characterization of Fulbright was 
accurate. We wouldn't argue against it.

how good the life outside of the

Radio Free Europe fighting sound barritt 
By Msgr. R. G. PierS 
Radio Free Europe isjn 
Jhe. news these days. Along 
with Radio Liberty (which 
broadcasts only to Russia) it 
has for more than 20 years 
been for citizens behind the 
Iron Curtain the only real 
..,source of information about 
what goes on in the free 
:world ? and even in their 
:own countries. 
f But the lives of both these 
-stations are threatened. By 
:the time this appears the de-
!bate may have been settled 
one way or the otker. Last 
year Nixon ended CIA fund-
ing of the stations and asked 
-that a public-private corpora-
tion be set up to fund and run 
'them. 
Both the Senate and the 
House voted emergency funds 
lto tide the stations over until 
'fsuch a program had been set 
;up. But the two bills differ 
Ion time, and Senator 
,Fulbright has worked to pre-
vent compromise ? and by 
such delay to kill the stations. 
My own special interest 
goes back to the day in 1967 
` when I was fortunate enough 
go get a special look at the 
'Radio Free Europe headquar-
ters in Munich. (Tile' station 
Is located there ? as are near-
ly a thousand of the 1,600 em-
ployees ? but the transmit-
ting towers are in Portugal, 
a better spot for technical 
purposes.) 
? Some idea of the import-
. 
ance West Germany sees in 
Radio Free Europe is the fact 
that it was allowed to build 
its large headquarters in 
Munich's sacrosanct English 
Gardens (something like 
building in Central Park in 
New York). 
We were allowed to sit in 
on the daily policy session at 
RFE that morning. It's a 
round-table in which the heads 
of the various national bur-
eaus and their advisors dis-
cuss current developments 
and plan the angles they will 
stress in their broadcasts. 
Among the items covered 
that day, for instance, was the 
trend, backed by the Russian 
paper, Isvestia, to have col-
lective farms promote pri-
vate initiative; and the fact 
that Stalin's daughter, Svet-
lana, had turned down a quar-
ter of a million dollars in or-
der to appear on an educa-
tional TV program. This lat-
ter would be used on 
all broadcasts to counter the 
--
Russian charges of commer-
cialism made against her. 
The completeness of the 
RFE files was impressive. 
There were 80 on the local 
research staff, who interview-
ed refugees, monitored 
broadcasts from Communist 
countries, and also studied 
about 2,000 publications, 850 
of them Communist. 
The result was the best re-
search center on Eastern Eu-
rope in the world ? and one 
used by many other people 
and organizations. 
Most important was the 
fact that, after an original 
mistaken approach, RFE em-
phasizes evolution rather than 
revolution in its broadcasts. 
They continually, for exam-
ple, encourage regimes when 
they make a democratic 
move, and they make it diffi-
cult for the government to 
take back freedoms once they 
have been granted. 
Typically, when an incen-
tive program worked in one 
part of Hungary, RFE let the 
rest of the country ? and all 
Eastern Europe ? know about 
it, thus building up the pres-
sures for economic reforms. 
News makes up 10 minutes 
of every RFE hour on t h e 
air. And accuracy is what the 
station has to sell. Iron Cur-
tain magazines have even 
needled their own Communist, 
broadcasts for omitting news 
details that were then natur-
ally provided by RFE. 
But, at that time at least, 
25 per cent of the programs 
was music, mostly popular. 
But the future of those Iron 
Curtain countries is in the 
hands of the youth, and it is 
at them RFE aims much of 
its effort. The young people 
seem to care not the least that 
the music usually happens to 
be in English. 
Strangely enough, at that 
time RFE was getting pleiQy 
of mail from listeners fr-/ 
behind the Iron Curtain, m t 
of it about the music. Itgs 
figured that about one of 610 
such letters gets through %o 
one of the many disgui 
mailing addresses RFE us 
but in 1965 they totalled 13,09 
letters. 
Time magazine in a recet 
story said RFE gets 78 eir 
cent of all radio-listening 
Poles, 81 per cent of the Hun-
garians, 77 per cent of ta 
Rumanians, 78 per centsof 
Bulgarians, and 60 per ci*It 
of the Czechoslovaks. 
Fulbright calls the Ai-
tons "cold war relics." Rat 
Time suggests that, in t5b 
light of the stations' modq:i 
tactics, Fulbright's own 
cism is a cold war relic. Eict-
er the Senator doesn't kngif 
what's going on in such brag-
casting or he's fallen (harcar 
likely) for the Commurug 
line that the people have 01 
the news. 
If freedom of informatitra 
is so important to us here 81 
the free world (and this as 
- what much of the headlirres 
are about these days), haft 
can we completely abandon 
the even greater information 
needs of those in Eastern 
Europe? In an era when the 
West has definitely given up 
any hope of military inter-
vention, it is the one remain-
ing thing we can do for them.

We see no justification for Sen. J. W.

These attacks sound like backwoods, bush-
league thinking, though they come from the 
tophisticated, chairman of the Senate For-.

subject. It would mean that the United 
States, if not the whole of the West, ought 
not to risk ruffling Moscow's feathers just 
now when negotiations are going on toward 
a possible detente. 
Fulbright took the same line in trying 
to choke off Radio Free Europe. He called 
it an atavism, a relic of the Cold War. 
But it is preposterous to think that the 
United States should gag itself, and not 
state its viewpoints while Moscow and its

FULBRIGHT'S POWER 
01R001100070001-5 
Senator William Fulbright, Chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, seeks to 
close Radio Liberty and Rado FEep_EArgpe by 
blocking action on long-term funding of these 
Munich-based stations. 
Fulbright sees the stations, which beam 
messages to communist Europe, as relics of the 
cold war. Critics have in the past charged their 
broadcasts stir unfounded hopes among captive 
communist peoples, that they helped instigate 
the hopeless, post-war uprisings in East Ger-
many, Poland and Hungary. The Russians 
have long viewed the stations as provocations. 
Yet for many Europeans under communist 
domination the broadcasts of these stations are 
'a valuable source of truthful news and in some 
cases the best surce--although the Russians 
have in the past jammed their broadcasts with 
Varying effectiveness. 
If the policies and operations of the stations 
leave much to be desired, the remedy would be 
reshaping operations and policies to best serve 
the purpose of tese outlets-- the truthful 
dissemination of news to communist Europe. 
Chairman Fulbright, who is entitled to his 
opinion, is in this instance seeking to shape 
foreign policy by forcing the closing of the 
"stations?constitutionally the responsibility of 
;the President; in this maneuver he is almost 
certainly acting contrary to the wishes of the 
tri.olor,ity of. Americans.

:REBUFF FOR FULBRIGHT 
Funds For Freedom 
i; 
CONGRATULATIONS go to the U.S. 
Senate for its rebuff to Sen. S. William 
Fulbright in the matter of Radio Free Euro_p_e 
Land Radio Liberty. 
The chairman of the Foreign Relations 
'..Committee a n d several fellow neo - isola-
.tionists and. pacifists conducted a long and 
:bitter campaign to deny funds for the two 
stations. Both operate in Munich. Radio Free 
'Europe broadcasts in native languages to 
.five Soviet bloc Eastern European nations. 
Radio Liberty beams information in 17 
languages to the Soviet Union. 
They have offered to these people their 
?only chance to receive accurate information, 
or any information at all, about events of 
worldwide importance. Often, they provide 
the only source of news from within the 
'countries themselves. 
The only criticism of any importance 
advanced by Fulbright & Co. has been that 
the broadcasts are "Cold War relics," 
;unsuitable in this "Era of Negotiation." ' 
,However, they still are needed, for good 
reasons. One is that truthful news is desirable 
;to counteract vicious propaganda still directed 
against the U.S. from behind the Iron Cur-
tain 
. ? .? A ? ?;?;1'. 
? 
Recently, for example, Moscow television 
aired a "documentary," titled "America-
Autumn '71," designed to (picture the U.S:
the worst posible light; It showed Klan 
meetings, Times ? Square prostitutes and 
American Nazis as "typical" of American 
life. 
AccusatiOns that the radios broadcast pro-
paganda are phony. Both stations have earned 
virtually unanimous praise for broadcasting 
objective news and impartial analysis. 
Most importantly of all, the broadcasts 
?provide, at relatively modest cost, ? a service 
to people in the captive nations who yearn 
" for knowledge. As Sen. Charles Percy says, 
"It is a sad fact that a man in Leningrad. 
may not know of a major news event in. 
Kiev or Prague or Paris or New York unless: 
Radio Free Europe or Radio Liberty informs 
him." ? 
Fulbright tried to use his "power of 
? ar-
rogance" to silence them. It is true that. 
Congress has appropriated funds only. for 
? the next three months. However, the Senate 
vote of 65 to 6 is a strong indication that 
more favorable action will be taken later 
in the year. It sho betakn.

rFulbright Defended 
, I believe it was the March 4th edition of 
the Tulsa World, editorial page, that an 
article by Roscoe Drummond reported 
Sen a tor F ulbright of Arkansas as 
recently putting forth an effort by him to 
kill all financial assistance for Radio' 
Free Europe and Radio Liberty. 
As you will discover, by the enclosed 
copies of a personal letter from Senator 
Fulbright and a report of the above men-
tioning. Fulbright claims he said no such 
thing. He also backs up his statement by 
offering documented evidence from the 
Library of Congress. 
Senator Fulbright does favor dis-
continuation of both Radio Free Europe. 
and Radio Liberty. He bases his opposi-
tion on several points ? most notably: 1. 
Our tax money "was being secretly used 
to support these radio services through 
the Central Intelligence Agency," not 
from "the dimes of school children and 
voluntary gifts from concerned citizens," 
as is the populhr belief . . . not to forget 
mention as being advertised as such: 2. 
Fulbright brought out the realization that, 
while $36 million of our tax money was 
being secretly used for the Radios, Ar-
kansas was able to receive only1'$5 million 
? 
for much needed water and sewer sys-
tems. The $36 million for both Radios. in-
cidentally, is in addition to the $41 million 
budget for Voice of America, the "sane- , 
tioned overseas broadcasting service of 
our government." 
After studying the report, perhaps 
ator Fulbright may really have some-
thing on his last point ? "If the need for 
,RFE and RL is as clear as adminis-
:tration officials claim, why isn't there 
'some interest on the part of our NATO 
llics ? who are much closer to the situ-
ation than we are? None of the European 
countries contributes to the cost of the 
Radios.' Why support something that the 
'people it is supposed to help have no in-
? terest in? 
I hope, in all fairness, you might pre-
sent my Senator's side of the story.

heir olitonal purpose, strong-
suppoCbd by many of the 
r.igres 2ho were collected to 
aff thei station, was to sub-
01 
vert Communist regimes, but to 
this approach was severely in 
modified after 1956, when Radio 
Free Europe was charged, jus-
tifiably, with having encour-
aged the Hungarians to take up 
arms against the Russians. 
CAUTIOUS POLICY 
Since then, the policy of both 
stations has been more cau-
tious. In principle, they claim 
to provide Eastern Europe and 
the Soviet Union with objective 
world news and with news 
about events within the listen-
ers' own countries which might 
not be available to them 
through the Party - controlled 
media. 
Radio Free Europe's staff of 
1,530 people, of whom 1,140 
work in Munich, produces some 
560 hours of programmes a 
week for Poland, Czechoslova-
kia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Ro-
mania (Czechoslovakia receives 
some 20 hours a day, followed 
by Poland and Hungary which 
receive 19). There is also a re-
search service, which issues ex-
tremely full and reasonably fair 
accounts of events within these 
countries, and their neighbours, 
and summaries of their Press: 
this service is also distributed 
journalists and 
the West. 
Those who are protesting-
against the close - down of the 
stations ? which will happen in 
June if no further money is 
voted by the U.S. Senate?argue 
that the Cold War is still very 
much a reality and that the 
need to provide "objective" 
news for East Europeans is as 
strong as ever. .The other side 
consider that the existence of 
the stations, bitterly resented 
by the Soviet and East Euxo-
pean governments, is in con-
tradiction to the whole spirit of 
detente in Europe and threat-
ens to compromise not only 
Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ost-
politik but bilateral plans to 
improve Soviet - American rela-
tions, and in particular might 
affect President Nixon's visit 
to Moscow in May. 
Travelling in Eastern Europe, 
one gets the impression that 
RFE's effectiveness varies con-
siderably. Its main success is 
the Polish service, which is 
heard by a large proportion of 
the population and ?.privately 
?by many Party and Govern-
ment leaders. Its intimacy with 
Polish life, ? and its cautious 
agreement with the regime on 
shutdown 
academics what Polish patriotic interests 
and limitations are, have estab-
lished a sort of symbiosis of a 
very unofficial kind with the 
Warsaw leadership, although it 
is hotly denounced on Polish 
radio and television. 
The listener figures estimated 
by RFE itself, based on rather 
unreliable sampling, suggest 
that around half the population 
of Eastern Europe hear RFE at 
one time or another in a year. 
But listeners in countries other 
than Poland sometimes com-
plain that programmes are pro-
duced by emigres of the older 
generation who are stiffly anti-
Communist and who have lost 
touch with the realities of their 
own societies. This has been a 
0m21a in t, for instance, in 
Czechoslovakia. 
WEST ROW 
The row in the West has a 
certain unreality about it. The 
party most intimately involved 
?the West Ger m an Govern-
ment ? keep an embarrassed 
silence. There is no doubt that 
it is an obstacle to Brandt's 
Ostpolitik to have an Ameri-
can propaganda station of this 
kind lodged on West German 
territory, and many leading So-, 
cial Democrats privately wish 
that it would move out. Its pres-
ence during the Olympic Games 
in Munich this summer is al-
ready drawing protests from 
East European capitals. But the 
Brandt Government, with its 
tiny majority in the Bundestag, 
cannot afford to make any ges-
hire which would be interpret-
ed by right-wingers in the coal-
ition as "truckling to Commu-
nist pressure." 
The alternatives under dis-
cussion- in Western newspapers 
?continuation in Munich or to-
tal shut - down ? are in fact 
incomplete. There are several 
other possibilities. One would 
be to withdraw RFE and Radio 
Liberty from West Germany 
and base them where they real-
ly belong: in the United States. 
RFE is transmitted mostly on 
short-wave, but there is also a 
medium - wave transmitter 
which would not operate over 
such a distance. Conceivably, 
if the Senate changes its mind 
and decides that RFE must con-
tinue at full strength, medium-
wave equipment could be. 
mounted on a ship in interna-
tional waters, or a satellite 
could relay the programmes in 
a sort of "informational bom-
bardment." - . . 
The principle here would be 
the "nationalization" of the sta-
tions. Their vulnerability comes 
from their pseudo - internation-
al status. Most East European 
1 nations operate multi - language 
external broadcasting stations 
which are extremely critical 
and sometimes hostile about the 
Internal affdirs of Western 7 
tions, but these stations are t 
official voices of the States 
which they stand. The decisi

Cong. Ancher Nelsen Reports 
F re:g 
The history of foreign aid 
has been stormy, and this 
year has proved no excep-
tion. 
We didn't get around to 
clearing the $2.9 billion for-
eign aid bill for the fiscal 
year that ends this June 
until this March. In other 
words, eight months of the 
fiscal year was, aiready 
over before Congress com-
pleted action. 
Obviously, as our col-
league John Anderson of Il-
linois noted recently, "for-
eign assistance is still a 
weak bird with a broken 
wing 'flying against the 
wind in the middle of a 
storm." 
Part of the reason the 
foreign aid program seems 
in constant trouble is that in 
the minds of many Ameri-
cans, myself included, at 
least part of it has been 
spent wastefully or in ways 
that even seem to hurt our 
own national interest. Also, 
it represents a nagging 
drain on taxpayers when we 
have many urgent needs 
here at home. 
Take just one example. 
Many of us believe the 
United States contribution 
to the United Nations is far 
too big and should be re-
duced. Originally, the 
House did, manage to cut 
back our contribution to the , 
United Nations Develop?, 
ment Fund by $100 million. 
Unfortunately, however, a 
conference committee lat-
er restored $86 million for , 
this U.N. Fund, and that 
decision now stands. Such, 
questionable items tend to. 
Aid Program StiN in 
discourage support for any 
foreign aid at all. 
THIS IS unfortunate be-
cause the foreign aid pro-
gram is directly related to 
our own national security 
and to the securing of world 
peace. For example, the 
measure recently passed 
contains economic and mil-
itary assistance to permit 
the President's Vietnami-
zation program to continue 
.so that we can get our re-
maining troops home from 
Southeast Asia. This aid is 
vital to ending American 
involvement in this tragic 
war. 
The aid bill also contains 
needed help for Israel and 
other allies, that we have 
encouraged to stand on 
their own feet. And it 
makes possible the contin-
uation of efforts like the 
Peace Corps, which surely 
has been one of our more 
successful overseas pro-
grams. 
I might add that the 
Peace Corps budget was 
regrettably cut back by 
Congress this year well 
below what the Nixon Ad-
ininistrtion had requested... 
? The reduction was thought 
to threaten a curtailment in 
operations in some under-
developed countries badly 
in need of American techni-
cal know-how. We under-
stand now, however, that a 
compromise has now been ; 
' worked out that will restore 
'some of the cutback and 
.ease the Corps' financial 
headaches. 
THE LATEST foreign 
1. policy furor involves the 
F' future of Radio Free Eu-
rope and Radio Liberty. As 
you may recall, Radio Free 
Europe has been broadcast-
ing to Eastern Europe ever 
since 1950 and Radio Liber-
ty started reaching millions 
of listeners in the Soviet 
U ? 
mon a year later. They 
have proved enormously 
successful in enabling un-
censored news and views 
I. from throughout the world 
to penetrate behind the Iron 
, 
Curtain in the native Ian- ; 
. guages of the people who so 
; eagerly listen to them. 
Criticism developed be- , 
4cause these operations 
, were mainly financed coy-
ertly by the CIA. So Con-
gress agreed to fund them 
' openly. Both House and 
Senate have voted to contin-
ue these operations, a deci-
sion I support. But, in spite ? 
of this clear expression of

Over-Kill in Triplicate 
Most Americans have heard about the Voice of America, 
the world-wide radio arm of the U.S. Information Service, which 
14roadcasts news from 108 stations in 35 languages to people 
In every 'part of the world who are equipped to pick it up. 
It is a comPlex electronic set-up which operates on a 1971-
7.2 budget of $41,000,000. 
; Not so well known is the fact that the U.S. government for 
quite a few years has been operating two other multi-language 
radio networks, aimed at specific countries, and ,designed to 
give the American viewpoint on news events. 
?: Radio Free Europe is one of these which was well-publicized 
about two decades ago when the late Drew Pearson, columnist, 
4alled for public contributions to support the enterprise, and, 
perhaps, to create a yearning for "the American way of life" 
specifically in the five border countries of Europe: Bulgaria, 
czechoslovakia, Poland, Rumania and Hungary. Possibly Radio 
Free Europe helped fire up the Hungarian rebellion of 1956, 
'taut the U.S. was unable to do much about it, and Soviet tanks 
tippressed the uprising quite bloodily. 
'The other U.S. network is Radio Liberty, which is aimed 
stlirectly at the people of Soviet Russia, and which broadcasts 
In 17 different languages or dialects. 
; Since it started, Radio Free Europe has cost American 
taxpayers $306,890,469 and Radio Liberty, a more recent 
enterprise, has cost $158,830,637. Their expenses for many 
i'ears have been covered in the blanket budget of the Central 
:Intelligence Agency (CIA) which doesn't have to account to Con-
gress for expenditures. 
Times have changed over the years. Points of view are chang-
Ing all over the world. Propaganda, if that is what the last-
tiamed agencies have been dishing out, loses its effectiveness. 
-The U.S.S.R., we have heard, no longer "jams" the RFE and 
III, networks electronically. Yet they continue to operate ex-
pensively. 
,4 Now Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty no longer are un-
tier the wing of CIA and Senator James W. Fulbright, chairman 
vf the Foreign Relations committee, proposes to cut off their 
appropriations after June 30, 1972. It would seem to this 
Pld codger, a bit of a veteran in the communications business, 
that the useful duties of the latter two agencies could be taken 
over by Voice of America. Or, we might Abolish all three. 
Intorchange of news reports, I understand, has been re-es-
tablished between the Tass Agency in Soviet Russia and the 
;Associated Press and United Press in the United States. 
If Propaganda is the objective of the U.S,-operated networks 
it is high time we abolished them. It isn't effective any more. 
)t's a terrific waste of money and brains. But President Nixon 
pas asked Congress to appropriate money for RFE and RL. 
The Soviet Union has no free press anyway, and we are merely 
)vasting time and money trying to force our point of view on the 
people of their countries. It is doubtful if our broadcasts have 
? any Significant body of listeners in real communist countries. 
They would be risking their necks if they were caught tuned to 
,,our hoop-la, and the truth, if important enough, will get through 
to them sooner or later. When they find out that their own country 
has been lying to them, or keeping secret from them important 
events they should know about, they may change their minds 
'about their own brand of government.

for Radio Liberty 
TEL AVIV -- A delegation often Jewish 
immigrants who arrived from the Soviet Un-
ion during the past year met with United 
States Ambassador Walworth Barbour at the 
US Embassy here and asked him to convey to ' 
thc US Senate their support of Radio Lib-. 
erty. Radio Liberty is one of two private 
American broadcast services which beams 
short wave programs behind the iron curtain ? 
and which are threatened with closure by the 
withdrawal of government support. 
Avraham Shifrim, who headed the delega-
tion, told Ambassador Barbour that Radio 
Liberty which broadcasts exclusively to the 
Soviet Union "brings a breath of freedom 
into our lives." The other threatened service 
is Radio Frec Europe...which broadcasts to 
EiisTrtiroiGn Communist bloc countries.

These Broadcasts Needed 
For almost 20 years Radio_Free Europe,.' 
(RFE) and Radio Liberty (RL) have broadcast 
'unmanaged news of the world to countries be-
hind the Iron Curtain. Radio Free Europe broad-
casts to five East European nations in native 
languages and Radio Liberty broadcasts to Rus-
sia in 17 Soviet languages. 
?. The operating budget for both broadcasting 
r.stations is $36 million and is used to maintain 
transmitters on Taiwan, in West Germany and 
Spain and pays a staff of employes which in-
cludes 250 Soviet defectors. 
The effects of these broadcasts have been al-
most unanimously approved and endorsed. But 
? despite this fact RFE and RL will cease oper-
ations within the next few months due largely to 
;the myopic tactics of one misguided American: 
'Sen. J. William Fulbright. 
Fulbright has called the radio stations "cold 
war relics" and continues to maintain that they 
endanger American relations with Communist 
countries. As chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee he has singlehandedly 
blocked legislation which would allow appropria-
Ltions to continue beyond June 30., 
Fulbright's intransigence indicates that once 
his mind is made up he has a fear of being con-
fused with the facts -- a malady which he has 
suffered from, most painfully, ior a number of 
years. 
It was Fulbright, for example, who asked for 
a special Library of Congress study to evaluate 
RFE and RL. 
When the study was completed Fulbright re-
fused to release the findings. Only recently after 
intense pressure from all areas of the political 
spectrum did he agree to release the study. 
To Fulbright's everlasting embarrassment 
the results of the study concluded that RFE and 
RL were very good indeed and worth continuing. 
But all this made no difference to Fulbright.. 
He still refuses to allow extended funding for the 
stations. 
Evidently there is nothing wrong with RFE 
or RL except Fulbright's fear of the free flow of 
:ideas between nations. Perhaps when the sta-
tions fall silenthe will be capable of realizing 
".- precisely what his fear has done.

Senator Fulbright's Cold War Relics 
A th th th f lif i th 
? no er ree mon s o e s e 
prognosis for Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty. Tlie?fOrmer broadcasts in native 
? languages to five eastern European nations. 
? The latter broadcasts to Russia in seventeen 
Soviet languages. The broadcasts are 
scheduled to die not because of their own 
weakness, but because of the political 
malaise of Senator William J. Fulbright. He 
believes the stations are relics of the cold war 
which should be discarded because tensions 
have eased. 
Until last year, there had been govern-
mental pretense that the stations were 
? financed by private subscription, while in fact 
' they were supported by the -Central 
Intelligence Agency. Just why that deception 
was considered necessary remains a 
mystery. There has never been an 
ac-
companying pretense that the CIA withheld 
from other anti-Communist operations. 
Despite that recognition of the CIA's role, 
there is no evidence that the agency ever 
? interfered with program content, nor has 
there been any charge that the stations in-
dulged in propaganda for propaganda's sake. 
? Former Polish Ambassador John Gronouski 
praised the accuracy and detail' of Radio Free 
' Europe's coverage of the 1968 Polish 
; uprisings which were ignored by the Polish 
press. Both Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty were factual in their coverage of 
events such as the ouster of Khrushchev, the 
Cuban missile crisis, and President Nixon's 
visit to China. 
To end the CIA tieup, President Nixon has 
proposed that the stations be financed by 
Congressional appropriations and run by an 
, eleven member non-profit corporation in-
dependent of government control. Although 
both House and Senate have passed differing , 
authorization bills, Senator Fulbright has 
defeated any attempt to resolve the dif- ? 
ferences by conference. 
He maintains that the stations are no longer 
justified because tensions have eased bet-
,., ween the United States and its ideological 
antagonists. There is reason to suspect, 
however, that at least part of that change 
may be a result of the work of the stations. 
They have made possible a flow of ideas to 
peoples across borders that are closed to 
other means of communication. There is 
, merit to the theory that even a dictatorial 
government must respond in some degree to 
what its people know.

One-man rule? 
For the past several weeks we have reported the sad state of 
affairs surrounditig continued underwriting of Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty, the U.S.-operated radio-broad-
cast services programing into the Eastern European nations 
under Soviet domination and to the USSR itself. 
Now a temporary accommodation has been reached to 
continue these vital services for three months. Senator James 
Fulbright (D-Ark.), who wields enormous power as 
_chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has stub-
bornly argued that these medium and shortwave broadcasts 
are "relics" of the cold war. We disagree. 
4 To discontinue these stations would silence truthful and 
respected voices that are now penetrating the Iron Curtain 
with authentic news of the outside world. They monitor the 
Communist news media to cqunter the anti-American prop-
aganda, and do this in the native languages of the five East-
ern European satellite nations, reaching 31 million?more 
than half of their population over 14?regularly. Radio 
Liberty's native-tongue transmissions into the Soviet Union 
likewise have been a thorn in the Soviet's side. 
President Nixon, backed by a solid House majority and a 
? seeming majority of the Senate, wanted financing through 
June 30, 1973. The compromise forced by Senator Fulhright 
leaves just one ray of hope?agreement to consider a bill 
that would provide funds for the fiscal year beginning July I. 
The administration bill carried an appropriation of about 
$35 million for the two services, as a direct fund supplanting 
imoney heretofore provided secretly through the Central In-
telligence Agency and some public contributions. 
If Chairman Fulbright persists in his stand in defiance of 
overwhelming congressional and administration views, it is 
bound to stir more opposition to an archaic' system that 
invests autocratic power in committee chairmen who achieve 
exalted status through seniority alone. -

Congress must decide once and for all ? 
whether it Will go on supporting these 
"cold war relics" or abandon millions 
of people in East Europe and the 
Soviet Union to a steady, unvaried diet 
of state-approved radio fare. 
Relations between the U.S. and the 
Soviet bloc have certainly improved 
since the period at the end. of World 
War H when the stations were 
established. The broadcasts are a 
continuing source of irritation to the 
Russians and could conceivably be an 
embarrassment to President Nixon 
when he visits Moscow. 
Moreover, the stations have been 
damaged by the discovery that they 
are supported mostly by Central In-
telligence Agency money rather than 
by voluntary contributions, as we have 
been led to believe for so long. This _ 
association is a sour note in the minds 
of some people at home and tends to 
;. make more credible the long-standing 
Soviet charges that the broadcasts are 
used to foment insurrection in the 
-.satellite nations. 
But even as old tensions relax 
between the governments of the West. 
and the Soviet bloc, an estimated. 30 ' 
million people behind the Iron Curtain 
continue to rely on these stations as 
their sole source of uncensored news 
and entertainment. The citizens of 
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, 
Romania and Bulgaria are still kept 
largely ? in the dark by the Soviet 
masters of their regimes, and the very 
fact that massive efforts a r e 
? constantly made to jam the broadcasts 
? (with little apparent success) is proof 
that they are still important and: 
necessary. 
This nation is long on talk of "corn-
'if mitments" to other peoples; such a 
commitment is at stake here. Until .1 
? news and information are permitted . 
:? to flow freely within the satellite na-
tions, we should continue to supply 
them from outside. - 
If the government is going to 
? support these stations, it should do so 
openly, through existing channels of 
cultural and information exchange. 
The connections to the CIA should be 
severed. Current legislation to cut . 
them should be considered seriously . 
by the Congress.

THE TIME had long 
passed for the CIA to be in

semi-clandestine propaganda 
station based in Munich. 
With the facts about the 
CIA's involvement revealed, 
the moment was at hand to 
face up and ask Congress 
for a direct appropriation. 
The House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee initiated a 
bill, later passed by the 
House, setting up a semi-
governniental corporation to 
operate the two stations for 
a trial period of two years. 
That proposal died in con-
ference- when the conferees 
accepted the Case compro-
mise for a June 30 cutoff. 
.What is the value of the 
broadcasts that RFE beams 
to the Soviet Union and the 
satellite states? Here intan-

passionate partisans insist 
that the broadcasts keep 
alive the hope of dissent. 
The legislative reference

But doubters believe the 
broadcasts are an irritant 
that stiffens the resistance 
of Communist governments

the lives of the dissenters 
even harsher than they 
would ' otherwise be. When 
Secretary of State William 
P. Rogers was before the 
committee, Fufbright repeat-

on whether RFE and Radio 
Liberty were an impediment 
to any Understanding with 
the Soviet Union. Rogers 
cited the series of agree-

works, including the two-

signed.

Why shouldn't Germany

There is a compromise 
which might assuage the

The Herschensohn Flap 
/ Bruce Herschensohn, the USIA offi-
41a1 who resigned Monday, probably was 
wrong to describe some of Senator Ful-
bright's views as "very simplistic, very 
naive and stupid," particularly when 
Pr'ulbright's Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee was about to consider the 
Information agency's $200 million au-
thorization request for fiscal 1973. Mis-
ohlevous and wrong the senator fre-
quently is; but naive and stupid, seldom. 
The flap, of course, came in connec-
tion with the showing by Senator Buck-
ley on 12 New York television stations of 
a USIA film on Czechoslovakia, which 
ends with Russian tanks rolling into that 
unfortunate country in 1968. The film 
? has won several awards and has been 
well-received by audiences abroad. 
There is, however, an implied ban in 
the enabling act establishing USIA in 
1948 'against the dissemination of the 
agency's material in this country. There 
is a certain logic in that, the logic being 
that such films are propaganda and 
should not be used to influence the 
thinking of the people who have paid for 
their production. 
At least two exceptions have been 
made, the most recent of which was 
the 1965 release, specifically authorized 
(over Republican objections) by act of 
Congress, of the film "John F. Kennedy: 
Years of Lightning, Day of Drums," an 
uncritical analysis of the late President's 
brief administration. The proceeds went 
to the Kennedy Center. 
Acting Attorney General Klein-
dienst's ruling that Buckley could use 
the Czech film because USIA material is 
open to congressmen "for examination" 
was, to say the least, somewhat strained, 
if only because the New York senator, 
clearly is a political figure and was using 
the film for a political purpose. 
The fact remains, however, that 
there should be some mechanism short 
of a specific act of Congress to make it 
possible for USIA films of merit to be 
seen by domestic audiences. The Czech 
movie apparently was such a film and 
had its showing not been related to a 
specific political figure there seems no 
reason why it should not have been 
shown. Clearly, there would be few such 
worthy exceptions to the rule and a bi-
partisan review board could be set up to 
Identify them and make recommenda-
tions. 
As a result of this little imbroglio, 
USIA has lost a talented albeit conserva-
tive executive, Herschensohn has lost a 
$36,000-a-year job, Fulbright has lost his 
never very frigid cool (he threatens to 
attach an absolute ban on such showings 
to USIA's authorization) and the infor-
mation agency may lose the money 
needed to fund two worthwhile insti-
tutions already under fire from Ful-
bright, Radio Liberty and Radio Free 
Europe. 
In our view, which we hope is neither 
simplistic, naive nor stupid, this was a 
hassle nobody needed. Steps should be 
taken to clarify the issue and to make it 
possible, from time to time, for the 
American people to see USIA films of 
merit under conditions which would not 
provide partisan 'advantage to any polit-
cal, party or personality.

V----"IMPACT OF RADIO LIBERTY ON 
RUSSIAN SOCIETY 
Mr. McGEE, Mr, President, the Wash-
ington Post of Sunday, April 9, 1972, 
contains an interesting analysis of 
Radio Liberty and its impact on Russian 
society. The article was written by Susan 
Jacoby, a former reporter for the Post, 
who returned to this country in 1971 
after a 2-year stay in the Soviet Union. 
The important aspect of the column is 
that the author is presenting a perspec-
tive of Radio Liberty based upon her per-
sonal experiences in Russia and the value
the broadcasts of this station have for 
the people of that country. 
I believe it worthwhile to read this 
excellent presentation of Radio Liberty 
because it comes from all individual who 
was in a position to rationally and real-
istically analyze the impact of the sta-
tion on Soviet society?a person whose 
observations are not tied to personal 
prejudices. 
? I ask unanimous consent that the ar-
ticle be printed in the REcoRa. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the Washington Post, Apr. 9, 19721 
RADIO LTDERTY AND THE RUSSIANS 
(By Susan Jacoby) 
On a snowy day during the winter of 1971, 
an unidentified young man 'from a small vil-
lage arrived at the Moscow apartment of An-
drei Amalrik, author of "Will the Soviet 
Union Survive Until 1984?" and "Involuntary 
Journey to Siberia." The young mass had 
heard on the radio that Amalrik had beets 
sentenced to three years in a labor camp, and 
he wanted to do something to help. 
Because Amalrik canted comments from 
readers, his home address had, been broadcast 
several Months earlier when his books were 
read over Radio Liberty. The young man 
knocked on the door and presented a sticky 
honeycomb to Amalrlk's wife, Gyusel. lie told 
her she must take it to her husband in camp, 
since honey would help a prisoner keep up 
his strength. Then he disappeared, leaving no 
name or address. 
The young stranger is one of the many Rus-
sians who listen to Radio Liberty. (It is ins-
possible to determine how many listen, al-
though millions of short-wave sets can re-
ceive the broadcasts despite intensive jam-
ming.) What these Russians hear and how 
they react are questions that Sen. J. William 
Fulbright (D-Ark.) has never answered in 
his fight to close down both Radio Liberty 
and Radio Free Europe as 'Cold War relics." 
Nor ? have Supporters of the two stations 
shown much awareness of what the broad-
casts really mean to people in the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe. 
Radio Liberty means different things to 
? different Russian listeners, depending on 
their interests and political orientation. Alex-
andria I. Solzhenitsyn, Russia's greatest liv-
ing writer, said recently, "If we ever hear 
anything about events in this country, Ws 
through them." Solzhenitsyn, who made the 
statement In an interview with Moscow Cor-
respondents of The Washington Post and 
The New York Times, had just heard a Radio 
Liberty report of an attack on him by Yaro-
slay V. Smelyakov, an official of the writers 
union which expelled the Nobel Prize-win-
ning novelist in 1969. 
- The Smelyakov letter was an indirect offi-
cial response to a sad and stinging lament 
Solzhenitsyn had, written in memory of his 
friend and former editor, Alexander Tvardov-
sky. It was published in the West and broad-
cast back to the Soviet Union by Radio 
Liberty. The exchange, a minor literary quar-
rel from the vantage point of an American 
audience, is highly significant to Russians 
who care about literature?and most of the 
people who listen to foreign radio stations 
care a great deal. Smelyakov implied that 
Solzhenitsyn, as a writer proscribed by the 
authorities, had no right to eulogize Tvardov-
sky, who received many official honors during 
his lifetime. The attack neglected to men-
tion that Tvardovsky was forced out of his 
job as editor of the magazine Novy Mir pri-
marily because ho championed Solzhenitsyn 
.so steadfastly. 
LETTER FRONI A LISTENER 
To many Soviet listeners, Radio Liberty is 
simply a source of outside information with 
which they may or may not agree. One man 
wrote Radio Liberty a letter vigorously dis-
puting the station's assertions that collective 
farm workers have a low standard of living 
in the Soviet Union. 
- "My brother works on a ko/k.hos as a ma-
chine operator," explained the letter, which 
was addressed in a chatty tone to a female 
broadcaster. "He receives 120 rubles, his wife 
80 rubles and his mother a pension of 30 
rubles. Ile personally owns a, large garden, 
two cows, two piglets, sense birds, chickens, 
ducka, geese and 15 bee-hives." (One ruble 
equals approximately 91.11 at the official 
exchange rate.) 
While Radio Liberty seldom receives let-
ters praising Soviet life, its audience does not 
consist entirely of people who are deeply dis-
satisfied with their country. A professor of 
French literature at a Moscow university once 
told me, "I don't always agree with these

Radio 'Liberty attempts to provide a wide 
variety of news about the Soviet Union and 
the outside world that IS not available in 
the Soviet. press. However, broadcasts of clan-
destinely published Sami72dat literature anger 
the authorities more than news broadcasts. 
Lengthy novels arc read in half-hour install-
ments over a period of several weeks: The 
radio thus enables a widespread audience to 
hear literary works it cannot read because 
of Soviet censorship. 
All of the best RITSSiRll novels and non-
fiction works of the 19603 have been read or 
discussed extensively on Radio Liberty. They 
include all of the Solzhenitsyn novels banned 
by Soviet authorities since 1964: "Cancer 
Ward," "The First Circle" and "August 1914." 
Other major works read over the air have 
included Nadezhda Mandelstam's "Hope 
Against Hope," which describes her life with 
the poet Osip Mandelstam until his death 
in a prison camp in 1938; Vastly Cirossman's 
"Forever Flowing," which deals with the feel-
ings of a camp supervisor who returns to the 
outside world; both Amalrik books, and the 
uncensored version of Anatoly Reuznetsov's 
"Babi 'Var." 
"Babi "far" was originally published by the 
Soviets in censored form in 1966, The uncen-
sored version became available only after 
Kuznetsov defected in London in 1369. Rus-
sians who listened to the broadcasts of "i3abi 
Yar" say they were particularly dramatic be-
cause the originally published portions were 
read in a flat announcer's voice and the parts 
cut by the censor were read by Kuznetsov 
himself. The censored paragraphs, which 
snake up at least a third of the present book, 
dealt with subjects ranging from Ukrainian 
collaboration with Nazi occupiers during 
World War II to continuing anti-Semitism 
in the Soviet Union.

Radio Liberty also broadcasts many Semis-
dot works by Ukrainian writers in the Ukrain-
ian language. They are not as well known 
in the West as Russian Samizdat writers hut 
are even more important to the 49 million 
Ukrainians who make up the second largest 
ethnic group (after Russians) in the SoViet 
Union. 
The station broadcasts 24 hours a clay in 
Russian and intermittently in 18 other Ian- . 
guages spoken by different nationality groups 
within the Soviet Union, Radio Free Europe 
broadcasts to Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hun-
gary, Poland and Rumania. Radio Liberty 
now has a yearly budget of $12 million and. 
920 employees; Radio Free Europe has a $21 
million budget and approximately 1,600 em-
ployees. 
Radio Free Europe is better known in the 
United States than Radio Liberty because It

programming are substantial, and they re- . 
fleet different political conditions in the So-

Radio Free Europe tends to engage in run-
ning arguments with the official press in 
countries like Hungary and Poland, and the 
official newspapers often answer the broad-
casts. Such dialogue is possible because the 
press in Eastern Europe is censored with a 
much lighter hand than the Soviet press. 
Russian newspapers and radio stations 
sometimes attack Radio Liberty, but they do 
not mention specific broadcasts: Any dis-

Radio Liberty devotes about a third of its 
coverage to international affairs and two-
thirds to Soviet domestic issues. There is 
some overlap in international coverage, since 
the station often broadcasts Western wire 
service accounts or its own analyses of events 
that have beets reported by official Soviet 
papers or the news agency MSS.

the killing of two Ulster defense regiment

Radio Liberta means different things

Russia's greatest living writer, said 
recently, "H we ever hear anything 
about . events in this country, it's 
through them." Solzhenitsyn, who made

The Smelyakov letter was an indirect

lament Solzhenitsyn had written in 
memory of his friend and former edi-
tor, Alexander Tvardovsky. It was pub-
lished in the West and broadcast back 
to the Soviet Union by Radio Liberty. 
The exchange, a minor literary quar-
rel from the vantage point of an Ameri-
can audience, is highly significant to 
Russians who care about literature ? 
and most of the people who listen to 
foreign radio stations care a great deal. 
Smelyakov implied that Solzhenitsyn, 
as 'a writer proscribed by the authori-
ties, had no right to eulogize Tvardov-

AIM 
Why Radio Free Europe 
Must Not Be Silenced 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, the two-
American stations which broadcast uncensored news 
and views to more than 350 million people behind 
the Iron Curtain, are in danger of drowning beneath 
a new wave of unilateral concessions to the Soviet 
Union. 
Last week's 654o-6 Senate vote providing funds 
for the stations through June 30 was only temporary 
relief. Whether they will obtain enough funds to op-
erate much beyond this date is still problematical. - 
The threat to the existence of RFE and RL?
looked to by people under Communist rule as their 
only "tree press"?emanates from three sources: 
? Sen. J. William Fulbright (D.-Ark.), the power-
ful chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, who has relentlessly campaigned to close 
the stations down because he believes they block bet-
ter relations with Moscow. ? ? ? 
? President Richard M. Nixon, who had been 
standing firmly for the stations, but now appears 
to be wavering as his journey to Moscow draws 
nearer and his desire for accommodation with the 
Russians grows more intense. 
? West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who is 
anxious lest the forthright broadcasts of the M unich-
based stations offend the Kremlin to the point where 
his own drive for d?nte with the Soviets will be 
detoured. ? - 
Aware of President Nixon's capacity for 
stir-
pvse ntoNes (and concession...), proponents of the 
two stations will not breathe easils Until all the 
results from the Nixon Moscow mission are in. 
However,. far more worrisome to them is Willy 
Brandt, whose government holds license renewal 
power over the stations, which must apply for new 
licenses in April. Already in a somewhat euphoric 
state over his Cistpolitik. Brandt is under tremendous 
pressure both from the East European and Russian 
Communist leaders and from the far-left wing of his 
own Social Democratic party to refuse new licenses. 
In a recent development, eight far-left Social Dem-
ocrat parliamentary deputies sent a telegram to Pres-
ident Nixon, calling RFE and RL "a stumbling 
block" and urging that they be closed down. 
Brandt's chief spokesman, Conrad Ahlers, followed 
the telegram by noting in a low-key way that his 
government recognizes the stations' "significance" 
but weal) ligtaVACItlFechrtRiThitOrnel)2a0v1A3104 
East. 
This has caused an uproar throughout West Ger-
many, where the public is growing increasingly un-
easy over Brandt's wooing of the Kremlin. "The 
readiness of some Social Democrats to demonstrate 
Bonn's good will to the Soviet Union and the East 
European regimes obviously knows no limits," re-
marked the conservative Munich daily, Muenchner 
Merkur, calling moves against the radio stations 
"a characterless, pitiful policy of favoritism toward 
the Kremlin." ? 
? 
But the potential inclination of the President and 
the wavering of the present Bonn government only 
serve to reinforce the most formidable opposition to 
the stations: Sen. Fulbright. 
He has been battling the stations ever since the 
1970 revelation that they were funded mainly by the-
CIA (hardly a startling revelation to those who had 
long seen the radios as unique instruments of Ameri-
can policy whose combined budget of $36 million a 
year had not come from just public contributions). 
Rebuffing Fulbright, journalists, scholars and 
diplomats loudly hailed the stations for their ob-
jective reporting, informed commentary. indepen-
dence and candor. The stations were further praised 
for helping preserve the cultural heritage of peoples 
behind the Iron Curtain, who have endured a pro-
nounced and vigorous "R ussifica Lion" over the 
years. 
More importantly, RFE and RL have provided 
the best insurance that the common man in the Com-
munist domain does not look upon the West as a 
gang of capitalist Neanderthals bent only upon club-
bing him to death. That, in the long run, is the only 
real assurance of possible d?nte. 
However, none of this has deterred Fulbright 
from his well-publicized death wish for two insti-
tutions he calls "relics of the Cold War." During the 
past year he tried to financially strangle the radio 
stations by delaying even non-CIA funding. Then 
he made a clumsy attempt to withhold from his col-
leagues highly laudatory Library of Congress studies 
of the two stations, an exercise in petulance that 
earned him a sound thumping from the Washington 
press corps. 
Fulbright's efforts to torpedo the stations 
reached its most ludicrous stage when he con-
vened Foreign Relations Committee hearings on 
the matter. So absolute was the concert of expert 
opinion for the stations that the Arkansas sen-
ator could find no witnesses of any stature azainst

He summoned an unknown but seit-prociaamen 
"student and practitioner of international broad-
casting" from Fresno. Calif., to criticize the stations 
but this testimony Was greeted with bemused in-
difference. Always. demanding full disclosures and 
unshrouded facts from those who appear before 
him. Fulbright elicited a wave of snorts and guffaws 
with his next effort at testimony: 
To counter the persuasive' pro-RFE-RL testimony 
of men like Yale political scientist Frederick C. 
Barghoorn and MIT political scientist William E. 
Griffith, the senator later produced a letter on the 
Senate floor which he said was written to him from 
a retired lower-echelon State Department officer 
who, he claimed, could not be identified. 
.*It Seems clear to me where there is no RFE or 
Radio Liberty now in existence," wrote Fulbright's 
mystery 'supporter, "that nobody would suggest that? 
this would be the time to establish such a station." 
Upon finishing reading this letter, Fulbright in-
toned gravely, "This is a very perceptive observa-
tion," ? _ _ 
The senator, hoWever, had not commented on what 
seemed the infinitely more perceptive observation 
of another retired State Department office' who did 
choose to be identified. Foy D. Kohler, former U.S. 
ambassador to the Soviet Union, wrote Fulbright: 
"I strongly support Western radio broadcasts into 
the Soviet bloc, and consider the services of RL 
and RFE to be especially important.... i also be-
lieve that continuation of these two broadcasting ser-
vices is fully compatible with the long-range stability 
of our relations with that area....... 
The penultimate result of all Fulbright's maneu-
vering was the recent vote on a compromise measure 
to keep the radio stations going. Although many 
saw the 65-to-6 vote as a victory for the stations. 
it merely set the stage for the real battle later this 
spring when Congress must decide on a permanent 
method of funding. 
? Fulbright would like to see the stations 
dead. Most proponents would like to have RFE 
and RL operate out of an autonomous government-
funded foundation, similar to the one under which 
the British Broadcasting Corp. operates. 
Those who stood with Fulbright in the recent vote 
constitute a predictable handful of senators whose 
sanguinity regarding Moscow seems to lead them 
into, as the British newsweekly The Economist puts 
it. "doing the Communist governments' work for 
them." Voting with Fulbright were: Alien J. Ellender 
(D.-La.), Harold E. Hughes (D.-Iowa), Mike Mans-
field (D.-Mont.), William Proxmire (D.-Wis.) and 
Stuart Syniington (D.-Mo.). ? 
"The stand of _Fulbright and his little band has 
of course not been lost on Moscow. Pravda and 
Radio Moscow are duly commending him." says The 
Economist. The Eastern European correspondents

bit of information helpful to him in his fight against 
"the capitalist pirates of the airwaves." 
The citizens of Eastern Europe take a different and 
somewhat dimmer view .of the affair, having heard 
of Fulbright's opposition over RFE and RL (which 
have given the senator's side equal time). He is now 
referred to behind the Iron Curtain as the "Arkansas 
Fellow-Traveler," or "Fulbrightov," or "Senator 
Fulbrightovich." 
And in a withering telegram from London, Oleg 
Lenchevsky. a Soviet scientist and party member 
who defected in 1962, suggests a "cure" for Ful-
bright and his followers: 
"[Letj them live the very midst of my hapless 
fellow countrymen totally deprived of any sort of 
truthful information, vegetating on a rickety diet 
of chronic lies from Radio Moscow and Pravda." 
Heinz Barth, Washington correspondent for Ham-
burg's influential daily, Die Welt, observed dryly 
in an article widely quoted in Europe: "If thank-
fulness were a characteristic of the Soviets, they 
would put up a statue to the senator in Red Square." 
Moscow's delight with any progress Fulbright 
makes is indicative of the effectiveness of the sta-
tions. The Soviet youth newspaper Kontsomolskaya 
Pravda noted ruefully last year that Soviet propa-
gandists "should draw serious lessons from the work" 
of RL. 
Because their large audience (estimates range 
from 30 to 70 million) treats them as a trusted 
home senice, speaking to them in their own lan-
guage and even dialects, RFE and RL arsjaak.._-
fished as a part of the daily life behind the Iron 
Curtain. 
It must not be forgotten that they are equally im-
portant to the West for several reasons. 
First, they inform the Communist public about 
news in both East and West. In doing so they force 
the Communist governments to confront issues they 
would otherwise prefer to hide from the public. Much 
of the world pressure against Moscow on the issue of 
Soviet Jewry has come about because Radio Liberty 
has continued to broadcast news of trials and per-
secutions and petitions for succor. 
Second, and this is closely connected with the 
first, the stations have become a kind of sounding 
board or clearing house or priceless information 
on what's going on behind the Curtain. This infor-
mation has often. served to delineate the reality of 
the "workers' paradises" for people in both East 
and West. 
For example, it was RFE which broke the news 
of the December 1970 price riots in Poland which 
eventually toppled the Gomulka government. Polish 
state radio was keeping a tight lid on news of the 
bloody rioting in the streets of Gdansk until RFE 
began broadcasting news bulletins which alerted the 
Western news media.

ment of the Polish Foreign Ministry for eight 
years before his defection in 1968, reports: 
"RFE news and commentaries are topics of daily 
discussions at all levels, including members of the 
Central Committee.. .and the governmental of-
ficers." 
In Prague each morning, members of the Presid-
ium, top government officials. and newspaper editors 
receive a thick bulletin marked "Secret" printed 
on red and blue paper containing digests of the latest 
RFE broadcasts. 
By simply telling the truth, by simply broadcast-
ing facts, the stations provide a constant embar-
rassment to the Communist governments. The Li; 
brary of Congress report on RFE transmits the cha-
grined reaction of a minor Polish Communist of-
ficial Stanislow Mialkowski: 
"...Members are influenced by the hostile pro-
grams of 'Free Europe.' We activists are [therefore] 
not always able to adopt the right attitude to some 
matters. For instance, we only learned about the 
regulations of wages and prices very late, while peo-
ple in the street talked about it several days before." 
Writing from the Ukraine, a listener to RL thanked 
the station for its floW of information and castigated 
his own government for its "cowardly silence and 
wish to hide a pig in a poke from their very own 
people." In an apologetic manner the Ukrainian 
listener continued: 
? "I only regret that I am a Russian and still live 
in this wretched Russia and have to write in shame-
ful block letters like an illiterate at a time of free-
dom of the press and speech" (presumably he Was 
referring to efforts to disguise his handwriting). In 
an eloquent denunciation of Moscow's stranglehold 
on freedom of information the writer noted: 
"...To our shame and regret we have to learn 
the truth not from the voice of the public, but from 
abroad. And all this serves only to undermine more 
and more [Moscow's] authority.... Let me express 
over and over to you my acknowledgement that you 
have been able to open my eyes and broaden my 
horizon." 
Particularly embarrassing and infuriating to the 
Russians is the fact that RFE and particularly 
RL have become the rallying point and "bulletin 
board" for the extensive dissident movement in the 
'Soviet Union. The movement encompasses a wide 
spectrum of Soviet life but is particularly concen-
trated among the intellectuals. 
The chief manifestation of this movement has been 
the much-heralded samizdat, or self-published 
writings of protest which, though banned by the 
Kremlin, are quoted widely by listeners of RL. 
Writings by men like Marchenko, Pasternak, Sen. Fulbright remains unmoved by any testimony 
Solzhenitzyn and Platinov are familiar staples on the of this sort. As Die Welt correspondent Barth says, 
RL airwaves. The Russian people eagerly (and il- "One does rut, LIAa.L.,

areas where heavy 'jamming precludes reception. munist countries." 
In addition to these more prominent works of pro-
test, RL broadcasts the appeals of religious and eth-
nic groups seeking freedom of worship or simply 
freedom from government harassment. These broad-
casts often force the government to confront the is-
sue, however obliquely, to answer public opinion. 
Public opinion was a phenomenon the Kremlin had 
hoped it could do without. But that was before RL. 
RFE and RL broadcasts have ignited the desire 
of untold thousands of people to leave the East bloc 
and come to the West, bringing skills and valuable 
information with them. Nuclear scientists, literary 
figures, artists, a wide intellectual spectrum, have 
"testified with their feet" to the awakening provided 
by these two radio stations. 
A poignant example of this was provided by Dr. 
Alexey Vasilovich Levin, a former nuclear physicist 
whodefected from the USSR in 1968. Testifying before 
the Flouse Foreign Affairs Committee, he said that 
were it not for Radio Liberty he might well have 
been "sitting in a Soviet tank in Czechoslovakia, 
or being expelled from the Sudan as a Soviet ad-
viser implicated in an attempted Communist take-
over or fulfilling some other imperialist role." 
Dr. Levin praised the "information which seeps 
into the Soviet. Union from abroad. It was only be-
cause of that uncensored information that I stopped 
to think about the reality of Soviet life around me." 
Explaining the effect of RL broadcasts on himself 
and fellow intellectuals, Levin said, "It was like 
circles on the water. One listener was like a stone in

that I got excited about it?this opinion, this infor-

dents, or with the young scientists with ?whom I

The Arkansas senator maintains firmly, that the do well to recall the friendly crowds that greeted 
stations' alleged policy "to stir up trouble in Eastern him on his trip to Poland in 1959 and his trip to 
Europe and Russia is contrary to the President's Rumania in 1971. Expert observers agree that it was 
own policy." Yet President Nixon himself, in a letter the announcements of these trips over Radio Free 
to REE last December said: Europe that caused the big turn-out. 
"The free flow of information and ideas among 
nations is indispensable to more normal relations 
as between East and West and to better prospects 
for an enduring peace." 
The Belgian Socialist newspaper le Peuple has 
commented: 
The disappearance of RFE would permit the 
Communist parties perceptibly to improve their con-
trol of the population, and by this increase their 
level of security. Viewed in this manner the closure 
of RFE would certainly contribute to detente;but can 
one really plead for a detente which n. ,nifestly goes 
against the interests of the inhabitants of Eastern 
Europe?" 
Interestingly enough. it is the intellectual com-
munity, the "thinking elite behind the Iron Curtain, 
which appears to be most strongly for the stations. 
Many bubbling Galbraithians believe those intellec-
tuals hold the key to change in the Soviet Union and 
the East Bloc. But they often fail to realize that much 
of the . hope and inspiration for these intellectuals 
has been provided by the two radio stations. 
"I well remember," says Soviet emigre Natalia 
Belinkev, wife of the late well-known Soviet literary 
critic Arkady Belinkev, "the efforts made by my 
friends to hear, despite difficulty,. the unfettered word 
filtering through jamming. 
**My invalid husband would spend hours sitting 
tensely before the radio, operating the volume and 
tuning controls with both hands. We saved our 
money, and even went without necessities, in 
order to buy the most sensitive receiver.... The 
ending or altering in character of Radio Liberty 
broadcasts would be a major catastrophe for the So-
viet opposition." 
Russian author. A. Anatoli Kuznetsov, winner of 
the Stalin Prize, joined eight other exiled scholars 
and writers to report: 
"When we listened to Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty their programs were for us a sub-
stitute for a free press non-existent in our coun-
tries.... To speak the language of a free press 
and not of the government propaganda...makes 
[RFE and RLI so attractive to their audiences. 
To deprive them of that life-line would be indeed 
a crime against liberty." 
It may be difficult for Sen. Fulbright, who recently 
characterized the concentration camp-cum-secret po-
lice regime of Joseph Stalin as "rather unreason-
able," to comprehend the idea of a crime against 
liberty. He is still opposed to the stations and seems 
satisfied to leave the people behind the Iron Curtain 
in darkness.

Ask Chiang 
Last ? Week , President Nixon 
signed a three-month reprieve for 
'Radio Liberty and Radio Free Eu-
613e, the Munich-based stations that 
broadcast, respectively, to the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe. ? The ap-
Propriations ? bill provides enough 
tooney to carry the stations through 
to the end of this fiscal year, at which 
;(time Congress will consider a new 'Ad-
ministration request for funds?that is, 
4f the Administration bothers to make 
'Stich a request. 
Each day, the odds grow slimmer, 
'and not, strangely, because of the sta-
tions' most vocal opponent, Senator J. 
William F'ulbright. To be sure, the 
Chairman of the Foreign Relations 
-Committee has led the charge against 
the stations, whooping that they 
'should take their "rightful place in 
the graveyard of cold-war relics." 
And the bill that the President has 
just signed does represent a victory 
....for the Senator, who vowed to hold up 
all legislation on the stations until the 
Potomac parted, rather than agree to 
long-term funding. Nonetheless, not 
even Senator Fulbright can write the 
death . sentence on RFE. and Radio 
Liberty. 
No, that dubious distinction could be 
'., claimed only by President Nixon, who 
?1 must choose whether to circumvent 
.1 the ,Fulbrights of the world. In the re-
cent battle over the stations, the Pres-
ident did little more than slough the 
`[.entire issue, notwithstanding his 
longtime pledges of support for the 
stations. There will be Moscow in 
May, and the President must not be 
too bold in such trivial but sensitive 
matters as straight-talking radio 
stations. 
That is why disc-jockeys in Munich 
these days are reading want ads. 
Since 1950, RFE and Radio Liberty 
have passed truth over the Iron Cur-
tain to millions of grateful listeners 
who could get- it no other way. Des-
pite excesses during the Hungarian 
Revolution and despite past support 
by the Central Intelligence Agency, 
the two stations have consistently of-
fered objective and non-inflammatory 
programming from news to music. No 
Tokyo Roses, no Lord Haw Haws, no 
Hanoi Hannahs. Just the straight 
stuff. 
As a result, the Kremlin has de-
spised the stations from the start: 
Propaganda can be countered by 
truth far more easily than the other 
way around'. So when the President 
goes to Moscow, the Soviets undoubt-
edly will suggest to Mr. Nixon what a 
nice gesture it would be if RFE and 
Radio Liberty were sent to the guillo-
tine. Mr. Nixon just might say yes, 
and tell the nation upon his return 
that?in Senator Fulbright's words?"I 
find it incomprehensible after these 
years of direct contact with the Soviet 
Union, that we must continue to sup-
port (these stations)." Anyone doubt-
ing such a possibility should address 
all inquiries to Generalissimo Chiang 
Kai-shek.

Mr. Marchetti was on the director's stall of the CIA when 
he resigned from the agency two years ago. Since then, his 
novel The Rope-Dancer has been published by Grosset & 
'Dunlap; he is now working on a book-length critical analysis 
of the CIA. 
The Central Intelligence Agency's role in U.S. foreign af-
fairs is, like the organization itself, clouded by secrecy 
and confused by misconceptions, many of them deliberately 
promoted by the CIA with the cooperation of the news 
media. Thus to understand the covert mission of this 
agency and to estimate its value to the political leadership, 
one must brush myths aside and penetrate to the sources 
and circumstances from which the agency draws its au-
thority and support. The CIA is no accidental, romantic 
aberration; it is exactly what those who govern the country 
intend it to be?the clandestine mechanism whereby the 
executive branch influences the internal affairs of other 
nations. 
In conducting such operations, particularly those that 
are inherently risky, the CIA acts at the direction and with 
the approval of the President or his Special Assistant for 
National Security Affairs. Before initiating action in the 
field, the agency almost invariably establishes that its oper-
Ational plans accord with the aims of the ?administration 
and, when possible, the sympathies of Congressional lead-
ers. (Sometimes the endorsement or assistance of influen-
tial individuals and institutions outside government is also 
sought.) CIA directors have been remarkably well aware 
of the dangers they court, both personally and for the 
agency, by not gaining specific official sanction for their 
covert operations. They are, accordingly, often more care-
ful than are administrators in other areas of the bureau-
cracy to inform the White Hous,e of their activities and to 
: seek Presidential blessing. To take the blame publicly 
for an occasional operational blunder is a small price to 
pay in return for the protection of the Chief Executive and 
the men who control the Congress. 
The U-2 incident of 1960 was viewed by many as an 
outrageous blunder by the CIA, wrecking the Eisenhower-
Khrushchev summit conference in Paris and setting U.S.-
Soviet relations back several years. Within the inner circles 
of the administration, however, the shoot-down was 
shrugged off as just one of those things that happen in the 
chancy business of intelligence. After attempts to deny 
responsibility for the action had failed, the President openly 
defended and even praised the work of the CIA, although 
for obvious political reasons he avoided noting that he had 
authorized the disastrous flight. The U-2 program against 
the USSR was canceled, but work on its follow-on system, 
the A-11 (now the SR-7I,) was speeded up. Only the 
launching of the reconnaissance satellites put an end to 
espionage against the Soviet Union by manned aircraft. 
The A-11 development program was completed, neverthe-
less, on the premise that it, as well as the U-2, might be 
useful elsewhere.

agency officials through such go-betweens as the influential 
Council on Foreign Relations. Earlier in the Nixon Admin-

Mr. Kleindienst, Meet Mr. Shakespeare 
The current flap over whether it is appropriate 
for a USIA film to be shown on Senator Buckley's 
TV show, designed for constituent consumption, 
contains a lot of legal analysis, high drama and 
low comedy. Lurking in the background is a con-
tinuing conflict between Senator Fulbright and the 
USIA over the value and the merit of sonic of that 
agencies efforts, most notably, Voice of America, 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. Ami some-
where in the foreground- is a statement by a USIA 
official on the taped Buckley show to the effect 
that the foreign policy views of the Chairman of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are "naive 
and stupid." And right in the middle is a large 
question of law and policy about whether it is 
either lawful or wise for the U.S. information 
agency to make its output, originally designed for 
use abroad, available here at home through a polit-
ical figure, or through anyone else for that matter. 
When the press reported that the taped Buckley 
show existed, Senator Fulbright? ignoring the ref-
erence to him, asked the Department of Justice to 
restrain its release on the ground that the USIA 
was not authorized by law to distribute its material 
.domestically. At about the same time, USIA Direc-
:tor Shakespeare issued a statement acknowledging 
past difficulties with the senator, but stating the 
hope that "future discussions . . . will be conducted, 
as they have been heretofore in a courteous and 
respectful manner." ? 
Then, Mr. Shakespeare sent the senator a formal 
apology repeating the tone of his earlier statement 
and commenting on the issue at hand: "There is 
also a question in my mind as to the propriety of 
the national archives release of a USIA film to a 
political figure for use on a domestic TV program 
. . . I can well see that the use of the film by a 
political figure, even on an educational program, 
is of questionable validity." He informed the sen-
ator that he had asked his general counsel to in-
struct the archives that such use of film does not 
eonform to the agency's judgment of the propri-
eties involved and thus that such material was not 
to be used in that manner in the future. 
At this point it seemed that those who fear the 
development of a governmental domestic propa-
ganda capacity could all relax. But it was not to be. 
On Friday, Acting Attorney General Kleindienst 
sent over his answer to the senator's request to 
stay USIA's hand. Astonishingly, he found that 
words in the act establishing the USIA were in-
.. 
STATINTL 
tended to permit USIA materials to be made avail-
able to the American public through the press and 
through members of Congress. 
This analysis is remarkable in view of the lan-
guage of the Smith-Mundt Act of 1948 creating the 
USIA. As we read it, this language speaks only of 
the promotion of understanding of the United 
States and her people "in other countries" and to 
'that end of the "establishment of an information 
service to disseminate abroad" information about 
the United States. When, in 1965, there was strong 
public interest in a USIA film on President Ken-
nedy, the Congress passed a special joint resolution 
to permit the agency to release the film to the 
American public. During the debate on the issue, 
Senator Mundt, one of the authors of the original 
USIA bill, said, in an executive session of the For-
eign Relations Committee, that during the original 
debate, one of the most hotly contested issues was 
whether the Congress was creating a "domestic 
propaganda agency." He added: "We Put in a?sec-
tion specifically to prevent it." 
The Foreign Relations Committee Report on the 
Kennedy film resolution contained the following 
language: "It is the further sense of Congress that 
the expression of congressional intent embodied in 
this Joint Resolution is to be limited solely to the 
film referred to herein and that nothing contained 
in this Joint Resolution should be construed to 
establish a precedent for making other material 
prepared by USIA available for general distribu-
tion in the United States." Now that seems pretty 
clear. Yet the acting attorney general found 
otherwise. 
The dangers to a free people of a creeping prac-
tice of governmentally developed propaganda ma-
terial being broadly disseminated to the American 
public are too obvious for extended analysis, par-
ticularly when the first instance of such dissemina-
tion is through a political figure of the same 
general political persuasion as the administration 
in power. We think that Mr. Shakespeare's instincts 
and judgments were correct and that Mr. Klein-
dienst was wrong on both the law and the policy. 
Fortunately, sources within USIA express an inten-
tion to adhere to the limitation in Mr. Shakespeare's 
letter. But we think that that limitation should be 
broadened. It should not simply apply to dissem-
ination through public figures, but to all dissemina-
tion to the American public. 
Finally, it is only fair to say that Mr. Fulbright, 
far from being either stupid or naive on this mat-
ter, was eminently wise.

By Robert J. White 
Of the editorial page staff 
Radio Free Europe and Radio LibertY. have an assured 
future of three months. Unless Congress overcomes the 
objections of the powerful chairman of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, two decades of broadcasts 
by RFE and RL to Communist countries will end. 
That is what Sen. William Fulbright hopes will happen. 
The two Munich-based stations are, he says, "Cold War 
? relics," vestiges of an outdated, evangelical foreign poli-
cy assumes others "will act like we want them to 
act if we only tell them how." . 
The Nixon administration, and even many who have 
been criticizing RFE-RL past practices, believe that the 
/stations still play a neceSsary role. After Sen. Clifford 
4 Case blew their CIA "cover' a year ago, he and others in 
.1- Congress pushed?legislation that would openly fund 
.RFE and RL and continue their operations. The adrninis-
'? tration, differed on details, but agreed in principle. 
But with Fulbright's hand on the legislative brake, an im-
passe' developed in February that threatened momentari-
ly to extinguish the stations. A brief reprieve came 
March 11 in a compromise for funding until June 30. 
The short-term agreement gave President Nixon the op-
, portunity to reaffirm his support for REE and RL as a 
"vital source of. uncensored news and commentary for 
ttens of millions of people." 
- ' 
. "Cold War relic" or "vital source"? The view offered 
here is that Mr. Nixon's statement comes closer to the 
vmark than Fulbright's. That conclusion is based on three 
, arguments: First, RFE and RL are not the deterrents to 
detente they are sometimes made out to be. Second, the 
stations are carrying out, a positive purpose that might 
be pursued by other means ? but no other means are in 
sight. Third, the stations are effective at reasonable 
:I?cost. 
But Brandt's ostpolitik is now jeopardized more by fal-
tering support in his own parliament than by Communist 
intransigence. And last. fall's four-power agreement on 
'Berlin, Which only dedicated optimists had thought even 
remotely 'possible, .would surely not have been reached if 
RFE and RL were the impediments to detente Fulbright 
believes them to he. 
STATI NTL 
It's not enough, of .course, to say-merely that RFE and 
RL do no discernible harm. Another important question 
is whether they serve a positive purpose. On Fulbright's 
\ 
'premise, the answer is no. On the other premise -- that 
the Cold Wm' has changed, not vanished ? the answer is 
yes. 
It is true that the Cold War produced RFE and RL. The 
? Cold War also, produced NATO, the Warsaw Pact, the 
Berlin Wall and various other "relics" that are still 
??' around. It is true, too, that a whole series of East-West 
negotiations, in process or imminent, depend on a good 
working relationship between Moscow and Washington. 
-.'Arms limitation, European security, Middle East, trade 
all are on the agenda, and the President's forthcoming 
-tap to Moscow gives special urgency to preserving an 
.7 atmosphere in which negotiations are possible. 
? 
But to argue that RFE and RL are barriers to such nego-

Unlike the-  1950s and '60s, the 1970s are providing abun-
dant, signs that East and West want to expand their con-
tacts, prevent great-power confrontations and promote 
political stability in -Europe. The least change is in the 
unfashionable, but nevertheless real, area of ideological 
differences, 
Party Secretary Leonid Brezhnev last month promised 
6,000 Soviet trade unionists that improved East-West 
relations will not bring a relaxation in the "ideological 
struggle." President ? Nixon sounded the same theme in 
February, saying of the Soviet Union, "We are ideologi-
cal adversaries and will remain so." Each is stating the 
belief ? as are other leaders, East and West that peo-
ple in antithetical political systems can coexist without 
forfeiting their ideological principles. 
A fundamental principle of the Soviet ideological strug-
gle is restraint of the free flow of ideas and information. 
A fundamental principle of Western ideology is precisely 
the opposite. And there is a further distinction. 
"Struggle," to the Soviet Union and allied countries, also 
means spreading their political viewpoint abroad. Radio 
Moscow and Radio Peace and Freedom (the latter a theo-
retically "independent" station) broadcast about 1,900 
hours per week outside the Soviet union in 80 foreign 
languages. Another 1,900 hours per week of external 
broadcasts come from East European stations; Radio 
Prague, for example, includes programs in Spanish, Ital-
ian and German. 
The distinction between these and Western programs de-
signed for Eastern audiences is both quantitative and 
qualitative. The weekly hours broadcast by Voice of 
America, RFE and RL combined are about the same as 
the foreign - language broadcasts from the Soviet Union 
alone. But that does not mean a superpower parity in

Correspondence 
Foreign Broadcast 
Sirs: 
As an admirer of the quality of your 
editorials and original research, I was 
disappointed with your March 4 "En-
lightening the Natives," advocating th'at 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty be 
shut down. ? _ 
First, you imply that; since Radio Free 
Europe (RFE) and Radio Liberty_ (RL) 
are subsidized by US government 
funds, they could not .be more "inde-
pendent" than the Voice of America. 
The VOA broadcasts official views but 
does not broadcast views of the domes-
tic affairs of the countries to which they 
are talking. (Radio Free Europe not only 
talks about events in Poland, but gives 
extensive information on sports, agri-
cultural developments and cultural 
events in the West as they relate to 
Poland.) 
Second, the editorial says the purpose 
of the stations is "not merely to give the 
news, but to encourage, perhaps to in-
cite, change inside Communist coun-
tries." Of course it encourages change. 
Isn't that the object of a liberal foreign 
policy? The stations give facts, alterna-
tive information people can use. Amer-
ican liberals long have been pointing to 
the fact that there is a Sino-Soviet split, 
but it was Radio Free Europe that first 
made extensive broadcasts on these dif-
ferences in 1962 and helped give Ro-
mania and other countries more room 
in which to maneuver in ttie schism. 
Third, the editorial says; the Bul-
garians, why not the Spaniards and the 
South Africans and the Brazilians," etc.? 
Since it is not fashionable in liberal cir-
cles to be disturbed over Soviet hege-
mony, it at least ought to be recognized 
that the last two world wars began in 
this area and it remains in a highly un-
'stable equilibrium. Let's face it: the fate 
of the Brazilian indians, however un-
just, has not yet become a serious chal-
lenge to the survival of the West. 
Fourth, your editorial says, as a 
matter of national policy, we doubt the 
efficacy of the attitude that we know 
what's good for them." The radios aren't 
operating under that assumption. 
Rather they operate on the assumption 
that the more information people have, 
the better they can decide how they 
want to run their lives. Your editorial 
implies that RFE broadcasts to people 
whether they like or not: it is their gov-
ernment that may not like it, but sur-
weys show the broadcasts are widely 
received among the people in Eastern 
Europe and that Radio Liberty is a ctu- ? 
cial support to liberal elements in the 
Soviet Union who hunger for a substi-
tute free press. 
Fifth, your editorial says the money. 
ought to be used for American broad-
casts instead. You should know such an 
either-or argument isn't necessary.

An Underground View of Radio Liberty 
By DEAN MILLS 
, Moscow. 
There is no way of gauging 
public opinion in a country where 
the government owns the press 
and all the research institutions. 
No one, Westerner or Russian, can 
guess with any accuracy how 
much of an effect Western radio 
stations have upon Soviet audi-
ences. 
But Westerners living here do 
know, from limited firsthand con-
tact with Russians, that many of 
them listen regularly to the BBC, 
Voice of America, Radio Israel, 
or Radio Liberty. Members of the 
constituency have included the late 
Nikita Khrushchev (reportedly a 
Voice of America fan) and Alek-
sander Solzhenitsyn (BBC). 
A 3,000-word essay is now circu-
lating in the Moscow underground, 
attacking United States Senator J. 
William Fulbright for trying to cut 
off funds for Radio Liberty, the 
station which devotes the most 
time to the Soviet Union. (Radio 
Free Europe, another of Senator 
Fulbright's targets, broadcasts 
only to the other Eastern bloc 
countries). The writer of the essay 
is reliably reported to be a physi-
cist, German Smirnovsky, who has 
never been active in the dissident 
movement.' 
? ? ? , ? 
? 
The language is at times intem-
perate, in the style of most Rus-
sian political tracts. And the 
straight-forward anti-communism 
of the writer is almost certainly 
shared by no more than a small 
minority of his countrymen. But 
the essay gives some rare insights 
Into the Russian's ear view of 
Western radio broadcasts. And it 
Js 'a reminder that there are peo-
ple here, however small their 
number may be, who do not ac-
cept the Pravda interpretation of 
,Western radio stations, or of any-
thing else. 
Here are excerpts from the essay, 
entitled "Whose side are you on, 
Mr. Fulbright?": 
!`The city sleeps. At least so it 
seems to the policemen who patrol 
the frozen capital. The sound of 
the snowstorm muffles the clank-
ing of their hobnail boots on the 
pavement. 
"But what is this? In Moscow 
apartments, villages on the 
steppes of Central Asia, in the 
Siberian Taiga a voice is heard, a 
human voice, speaking in Russian, 
so unlike the official ravings of the 
Soviet language. 
"'This is Radio Liberty.' " 
? ? ? 
"It penetrates every remote cor-
ner of the country and finds a 
response in the heart of every 
decent person in Ruskia. And the 
super-jamming, for wch taxpay-
ers every year put up to a million 
rubles, does not help. Nor do the 
snoopy neighbors?KGB agents 
who expose those who listen to 
Western stations (God knows how 
much our people pay this bunch of 
informers), nor the slanderous ar-
ticles in the official press. Commu-
nism, with its anti-human face, is 
powerless against the free world. 
"The closing of Radio Liberty 
would have terrible consequences 
for our country. And if Fulbright 
succeeds in closing the radio sta-
tion, then the question automati-
cally arises: Where will this Rus-
sophobe turn next? Perhaps to the 
Russian section of the Voice of 
America? 
"Not one of the other Western 
radio stations could replace Radio 
Liberty for listeners in the Soviet 
Union. Let us consider the more 
popular stations: 
"Voice of America: The usual 
.length of broadcasts in the Rus-
- 
sian language is six hours in the 
evening and two in the morning. 
When the government was not 
jamming foreign government 
broadcasts, Voice of America en-
joyed great success in the most 
varied circles of society. In the 
apartments of many of my ac-
quaintances, particularly among 
youth, the station was heard from 
7 o'clock in the evening until 1 
o'clock in the morning. 
"The news on the hour (still) is 
popular. After that, radio listeners 
generally turn to other stations. 
Few people. want to listen to sto-
ries about how some farmer in 
Iowa had a huge corn harvest or 
about some famous American 
woman Negro athlete who is com-
pletely unknown here. 
"BBC?This radio station broad-
casts in Russian five hours a day. 
In Russia, there is a widespread 
feeling that the most objective, 
'disinterested' news is broadcast 
by the BBC. In fact, it almost fully 
corresponds to the news given by 
Voice of America. The station is 
jammed in all of Moscow much 
more strongly than the broadcasts 
of its American colleague. It de-
votes a great deal of time to 
events in Ulster and Malta. 
? ? ? 
"Radio Israel?It is also popular 
in Russia, but mainly among Jew-
ish circles. I am struck by the 
abundance of Jewish information 
from Russia that is broadcast by 
the station. Many letters, petitions 
and telegrams are read on the 
radio the same day they are writ-
ten in the Soviet Union. 
"The party 'brothers' ... also 
broadcast full programs in Rus-
sian?Radio Peking and Radio Tir-
ana. They are popular in certain 
circles of workers who, like all 
people. are displeased with the 
party bosses. Like those of Radio 
Belgrade, they are intended for 
Communists. But there are few 
such people in Russia, Commu-
nists of conviction rather than con-
venience, and for the rest these 
broadcasts are simply not interest. 
ing. ? 
? ? . - 
"However, when one succeeds in 
receiving Radio Liberty, absolutely 
everyone listens to it. In addition 
to giving its listeners truthful in. 
formation and preserving Russian 
cultural values, Radio Liberty 
tries to. educate listeners as deceni 
people, to correct moral .cripples 
after 50 years of Communist tyran. 
ny, to combat the pettiness formed 
in the minds of the people. 
"It is difficult to convey the NI

-7 THE NUMBER of foreign students at 
'-American universities has been growing at a 
rate. described by the State Department, 
which is not normally given to unrestrained 
language, as "spectacular." 34,000 in 1954. 
82,000 in 1965. 145,000 in 1971. Though rising 
costs, open-enrollment, "Americans first" 
pressures and the buildup of facilities back

growth, the figures are indeed spectacular, 
not to say intriguing and quietly cheering: 
They seem to say something about America 
that, for a change, most of us can agree is 
nice to hear. 
. The figures are, first of all, evidence of 
:the most compelling sort of the attractions 
which , education and experience in the 
United States have around the world: 37 per 
cent of foreign students come from the Far 
East, 20 per cent from Latin America, 13 
. from Europe, 12 from the Middle East; 9 
from North America, and 6 from Africa. 
(Overall, three of four are men.) Students 
' began coming in numbers in the 50s. That 
? was understandable because their choices 
were limited and, to many, the American 
ciream was still bright. Rising appetites for 
education and the stimulus of a certain Sovi-
,et-American rivalry for the allegiance of the 
world's young, thought to be a key group, 
brought more students in the 60s. 
But the 70s, when supposedly Vietnam had 
proven beyond any innocent's doubt that 
America was over, turned sour, a crass out-
of-control machine; when word about our 
failings had supposedly filtered back to the 
remotest third-world village and slum . . .

The more for knowing us when they finally 
'go home. Perhaps. Reliable follow-up attitu-
?dinal studies are scarce. Yet too many of us 
have met and known too many foreign stu-
dents to really believe that, I would guess. 
They may be "expoiting" us but we?espe-
cially our students?are ."exploiting" them 
'too. To know us may not be to love us but 
surely to know us is at least to pause and 
consider our complexities before rendering 
verdict, however harsh. 
. You may also suspect that our govern-
ment is out there buying up unaware or des-
perate young people in order to "influence" 
them or to prevent the Russians (or 
-.Chinese) from winning a crucial battle for 
hearts and minds. But less than one in 20 
foreign students is supported by the govern-
ment, and' then customarily only in inade-
ttuate partial meast....Some 37 per cent of

ities, foundations, and the 'like. It is not by 
-official government policy but by individual 
foreign choice and; beyond that, by private 
voluntary American demand that foreigners 
study at our campuses. 
This is an interesting point to ponder at a 
moment when predictions of a national slide 
toward neo-isolationism are widely in vogue. 
Not only are foreigners evidently not fed up 
with us; we evidently are not fed up with 
them. It is the decision of hundreds of uni-
versities and other groups to contribute to 
foreigners' and their own enrichment by 
'maintaining and expanding these very tangi-
ble continuing ties. 
"The government" in its various aspects 
is important. For instance, the 25-year-
old Fulbright-Hays program has . brotight 
140,000 foreigners scholars here. Senator 
Fulbright hailed his brainchild just the 
other day "because it leads to the civilizing 
of our people so they don't engage in peri-
odic blood-letting." (He contrasted Ful-
bright-Hays, by the way, with Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty, whose "propa-
ganda" broadcasts he hopes to terminate; al-
though just why it's fine to let a foreigner 
see us close up with his own eyes, but not to 
hear us from a distance with his own ears, is 
not obvious.) ? ' 
Mr. Nixon's own attitude can perhaps be 
fairly indicated by the fact that, as Vice 
President in 1958, he made a rare appear-
ance before the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee, testifying for, if you will, Fulbrights 
Hays. In his administration, the State De-
partment's budget for foreign-student serv-
ices has increased: back-home counseling, 
on-campus orientation, travel. (State per-
suaded the National Association of Motor 
Bus Owners to facilitate "See America" tour 
tickets), etc. The department feels that em-
phasis on these auxiliary programs aiding 
-individual students is all the more impor-
tant now that the international youth and 
student organizations of the '50s and '60s are 
pretty much spent. 
?. 
THE rationale for official interest is dis-
played by the title?"Leaders for Tomorrow, 
A Review of U.S. Programs for Foreign Stu-
dents"?of the last annual report of Assist-
ant Secretary of State John Richardson Jr. 
"No one can say with assurance what spe-
cific education and experience produces a 
leader," the report says. "But it's a certainty 
that more and more of tomorrow's leaders 
here and elsewhere will be drawn from those 
who study outside their own country, .or have 
had some opportunity to observe other- na-
tions and peoples." To observe not as sol-
diers or tourists or emigrants, it might be 
added, but as individuals who come for a 
peaceable purpose, stay long enough for 
deep exposure, and go home. - 
Foreigners' study here, the report con-
cludes, "makes them members of the new in-
ternational fraternity, the transnational 
'community of the concerned.' It is this 
group in each country which is most likely 
to develop new forms of international coop-
era ion, and to work consciously among 
themselves and other nations, inch:Wing -the 
United States, to solve some -of mankind's 
common problems. To the extent that we as 
American individuals, communities, institu-
tions or public or private agencies, help 
them build ties with U.S: classmates, friends 
and professional colleagues, we contribute 
towards this long-sought international part-
nership for peace." Amen. .

Government Deceit 
STATI NTL 
? Deceit in government has no place in an America 
that reveres its first President for his declaration, can-
not tell a lie." 
But deceit has been rotting America's government 
in recent years, so much so that nearly half the Americans 
questioned in a 1970 survey said they no longer believed 
what their government told them. 
Americans had new reason for their distrust this 
week, when Administration officials and Congressional 
aides worked out a way to continue government financing 
of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty until June 30. 
?They were reminded that these radio stations have 
? been financed to the tune of $500 million by the_Qp 
and they remembered those stirring television corn-
mercials through the years that urged them to con-
tribute their gifts to Radio Free Europe to carry the truth 
behind the Iron Curtain, when all the while their con-
tributions were ,not needed. 
Americans have a degree, of sophistication. They 
- understood, when they found out a couple of years ago 
? that Radio Free Europe would not die if they stopped , 
- sending contributions, that its effectiveness among its 
European listeners might have been diminished if they , 
A had known the broadcasts were really U.S. government 
, 
broadcasts. 
But AmeriCans still do not like to be duped by 
anybody, much less by their own government. 
And they could well wonder, now that the world 
has known for a couple of years that these radio stations' 
, are government financed, why the government is so , 
eager to continue them if that knowledge has rendered 
their words suspect. 
Those words need not be suspect. Governments ; 
can tell the truth. Governments can demonstrate in- : 
'tegrity, and when they do they find that they are more 
powerful at home and throughout the world because 3 
. they can be trusted.

ment had lied to its own people but Winston Churchill 
had told the truth to his, Churchill could inspire more 
_ determination and enthusiasm among the British by 
announcing a defeat than Hitler could inspire among , 
the Germans by -announcing a victory.

cannot be challenged, and let the government of the

Lette-r's to the Ed to 
'The, Orange Card' 
SIR:: The gratuitous criticism in your March 25 
editorial,. with respect to my position on Northern Ire-
land ignores an obvious fact. The new peace initiative 
announned last week by Prime Minister Heath coin-
cides almost precisely with two of the most important 
'provisiQns in the resolution I introduced in Congress 
last October with Senator Abe Ribicoff and Congress-
man Hugh Carey?the promised phase-out of intern-
ment, zind the institution of direct rule of Ulster from 
, Westminster: 
My only real regret is that the initiative was so long 
delayed in coming, and that so many innocent lives 
" Were lost before Britain decided to act. All of us hope 
and pray that the new policy will be successful in halting 
the killing and violence. Simple humanity requires us to 
. continue to speak out to insure the earliest possible end 
to the tragedy. 
One other point should be made about your editorial. 
' Anyone familiar with Ulster history must wince at the 
obvious blunder in your use of the famous expression 
"Playing the Orange Card" to describe Prime Minister 
. Heath's initiative. Lord Randolph Churchill coined the 
phrase in the 1880s and played the card in opposition to 
Gladstone's Home Rule Bill. As Churchill wrote to Lord 
Justice Fitzgibbon in 1886: 
"I decided some time ago that if the COM (Grand 
Old Man, Gladstone) went for Home Rule, the Orange 
Card would be the one to play. Please God, it may turn 
okt the ace of trumps and not the two." ' 
Ever since, the phrase has been used to denote 
rttempts to stir up the Orange Order in Ulster and other 
Protestant opposition to British policy. The phrase can 
tardly be used to describe a progressive British initia-
tive. For nearly a hundred years, British policy toward 
3reland has been paralyzed by fear of the abominable 
Orange Card. Now, Prime Minister Heath has faced the 
thallenge, and for that he deserves great credit.

and the Soviet Union, hard-

policy of detente with the

undermining freedom of the 
two radios to keep operat-

Subterranean signals that 
some Nixon advisers may be

about the kwo radi os

the toned-down statement 
he belatedly put out March

Congress to break its long 
deadlock on financing the

later the deadlock' had in ef-
fect already been broken. 
? Thus, there must be a 
slight amendment in the 
over-all picture of Sen. J. W.

gle-handedly defying con-
gressional and public opin-

sources of news available in

While his lobbyists battle 
Fulbright to keep the radios

statement was not issued 
until - the nationalities divi-
sion of the Republican Na-
tional Committee reported 
to the White House the out-
rage among East European 
ethnic groups over presiden-
tial silence. 
One early plan for the 
presidential statement was 
to include strong language 
on the vital importance of 
people-to-people contacts, 
using quotations from Mr. 
Nixon during his visit to the 
Great Wall of China Feb. 24. 
None of that survived the 
editing. The final version of 
the statement, while putting 
Mr. Nixon strongly on the 
side of continuing the broad-
casts, was routine. 
There are other signs Mr. 
Nixon's spectacular move to-
ward detente with the Com-
munist world is subtly un-
dermining the freedom of 
U.S.-controlled broadcasts 
beamed to that world. 
A costly Voice of America 
film on the plight of Tibetan 
refugees who fled after the 
Chinese takeover of Tibet 
has been banned by the 
White House. The film, enti-
tled "The Man From the 
Missing Land," was finished 
in late spring, 101. It was 
ordered locked up until 
after the President's trip to 
China. 
Since Mr._ Nixo.n.'s return, 
- repeated efforts to get 
White House clearance. to 
send the film abroad have 
met a stone wall. The reason

Mr. Nixon's foreign policy 
and RFE-RL is now arising 
in West Germany, where 
left-wing members of Chan-
cellor Willy Brandt's Social. 
Democratic Party are press-
ing him not to renew the li-
cense for the Munich-based 
radios. - 
Partly as a result of that 
domestic political pressure, 
Brandt's government has 
quietly informed the Nixon 
administration that there 
will be no license renewal 
unless the U.S. agrees not to 
follow a line on RFE-RL 
that might "undermine" 
Brandt's Ostpolitik, epito-
mized by his new treaties 
with Warsaw and Moscow. 
The first sign of West 
German hesitation over the 
impact- of the radios on 
Brandt's Ospolitik came al-
most two years ago. At that 
time, Mr. Nixon assured 
Frank Shakespeare, director 
of the United States Infor-
mation Agency, which in-
-eludes the Voice of America, , 
and William F. Buckley Jr. 
then a member of the USIA 
Advisory Commission, that 
he would not permit RFE-
RL to die. 
Tell the Germans, 1?11. 
Nixon said, our troops in Eu-
rope and our radios in Mun-
ich go together. Two years 
later, with his own Ostpoli-
tik in full bloom, that mood 
of the President appears 
slightly abated. :. 
it is against that back-
ground that opposition to 
RFE-RL funding for the 
year starting July I must be 
examined. With their financ-
ing now on a routine cycle 
of annual authorization and 
appropriation in Congress, 
Fulbright as' chairman of 
the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee has enor-
mous influence over author-
izing the broadcasts for an-
other year. Fulbright, over-
.riding a strong majority on 
his committee, insists with 
the passion of the ideologue 
that the broadcasts so ea-
gerly awaited by the citizens 
of Eastern Europe are an-
achronistic relics of the cold 
war. 
President Nixon flatly dis-
agrees with Fulbright's 
dogma, publicly and pri-
vately. But hardliners insist. 
that the heady and domi-
nant fragrance of detente is 
subtly undercutting his posi,-
tion.

WASHINGTON, March 25. ? 
Representative Ray Blanton 
(D-Tenn.) Saturday dismissed 
as "hogwash" arguments by 
Senator J. W. Fulbright (D-
Ark.) that Radio Free Europe 
and Radio Liberty irritate So-
viet Union leaders and prevent 
a detente. 
, "While I have never voted 
for a foreign aid program," 
Blanton said in his weekly 
newsletter, "I believe Radio 
Free Europe is a worthy com-
mitment for this nation." 
The two Munich-based sta-
tions, operated by the Central 
Intelliegence Agency, beam 
broadcasts to the Communist 
countries of Eastern Europe. 
Fulbright has been leading a 
drive to have the stations ter-
minated on grounds they are 
'axpensive irritants and "rem-
ants of the cold war." 
"I would rather see our tax 
money spent for a good pur-
)ose such as this," Blanton 
said, "than in trade with Com-
munist countries or aid to 
ountries who couldn't care 
ess what happens to American 
n the hng run. What the sena-
ors are suggesting is that we 
abandon any efforts to allow

"I (147. Vt think Congress will 
abandon the free world. 
"I don't think Congress will 
abandon Radio Free Europe 
and Radio Liberty. The spe-
:ious arguments used against 
them won't convince the ma-

,?SENATOR J. W. FULBRIGHT, speak-
ing in the Senate on Feb. 17, 1972. 
"It happens quite often that I am 
unable to hear your station because 
of the jamming. At such moments I 
feel like smashing the radio, as if 
the wooden box were to blame, and 
I almost cry in helpless rage. It

?"YOUR LISTENER FROM CHRUDIM," 
writing to the Czechoslovak De-
partment of Radio Free Europe on 
Sept. 27, 1971. 
0 doubt the Senator from 
Arkansas is right. Radio Free 
Europe began broadcasting to 
five countries of Eastern and Central 
Europe at the height of the cold war, 
not to mention a hotter one raging 
In Korea, on July 4, 1930. But just as 
surely, the lady from Chrudim is 
right. She is just one of millions in 
her own Country, Poland, Hungary, 
Rumania and Bulgaria who believe 
that their own newspapers, television-
and radio 'tell them lies, that noth-
ing available to them is quite so 
reliable as Radio Free Europe. 
As Chairman of the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee, Fulbright 
prevented all Congressional attempts 
to renew funding?for Radio Free Eu-
-rope and its sister station, Radio 
Liberty, which broadcasts to the So-
viet Union, before their ? last appro-
priation expired Feb. 22. Despite a 
House bill proiriding new funds 
'through June- 30, 1973, and a Senate 
measure guaranteeing funds through 
next June 30, Fulbright has kept the 
stations living on borrowed time by 
blocking any compromise bill. The 
House will no doubt accept the Sen-

30, but there is still pessimism here 
about its prospects. At a time when 
President Nixon will be preparing to 
visit Moscow, the pessimists ask, 
what chance is there for the passage 
of a measure to continue a service 
that has been a thorn in the Soviet 
side for many years? 
The disclosure that Radio Free Eu-
rope and Radio Liberty operated on 
funds secretly supplied by the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency set off 'in 
tile United States a heated debate on 
the propriety of continuing to pre-
tend that they were private institu-
tions supported. by charitable contri-
butions, and that debate ultimately 
led to Fulbright's stand. But the dis-
closures and, the debate caused no 
concern among the stations' listen-
ers. They continue to tune in with 
as much faith as an American might 
bring to a' newspaper that has a de-
cent record for factual reporting and 
an editorial policy with which he 
agrees more often than not. Their 
devotion . is almost unmatched in 
countries that offer more than one 
credible 
source. of news.

only if its management, the Govern-
ment, were to repudiate everything 
it stands for. "The radio" means 
Radio Free Europe; the Warsaw or 
Bucharest stations are more likely to 
be discussed as "they." 
Despite its cold-war origins and 
C.I.A. sponsorship, Radio Free Eu-
rope's listeners consider it not a 
propaganda station, but the anti-
propaganda station that adjusts the 
one-sided view of the world laid

ern Europe are sophisticated enough 
to know that Radio Free Europe is in-
terested in influencing their minds, 
but they seem to feel that its methods 
do less violence to their intelligence 
than do those of the state media. 
"We don't project one point of 
view, but the diversity of freedom," 
said Jan Nowak, the head of Radio 
Free Europe's Polish service. 
Although it is an American sta-
tion, recognized by its audience as 
such despite its neutral name, its 
programs do not reflect a specifically 
American point of view. The bulk of 
its news report is drawn from four 
news agencies, of which only one, 
United Press International, is Amer-
ican. The others are Reuters, of 
Britain; Agence France - Presse, and 
Deutsche Presse Agentur. More Eu-
ropean newspapers of all political 
persuasions than American are cited 
in the press reviews that form an 
essential part of the programing. 
Unlike the three other foreign 
broadcasters with large audiences in 
Eastern Europe?the British Broad-
casting Corporation, the Voice of 
America and the West German 
Deutsche Welle?Radio Free Europe 
is not regarded as an official station 
pushing a government point of view. 
In countries in which only govern-
ment views are broadcast and there 
is a deep audience skepticism toward 
all official views, Radio Free Eu-
rope's quasi - private sponsorship 
gives it a great credibility edge. 
"The programs of the B.B.C. or 
the Voice of America are welcome

muffled voice for a few glorious

might be thought that the

Abroad. 
Easier said than done. Old 
habits are hard to break, 
even when they no longer 
seem appropriate to a na-
ton's new mode. A few 
weeks ago, for instance, 
there was an argument in 
Congress over giving addi-
tional money to that relic of 
the McCarthy era, the 
House- Un-American Activi-
ties Committee. The com-
mittee hasn't caught a Com-
munist in 20 years, if ever, 
?but no matter. It's now 
? called the House Internal 
Security Committee, and it 
has just been given $525,000 
more to waste. 
THIS IS tip money, how-
ever, compared to the $33 
million a year in tax funds 
that the President and Con-
gress want to give another 
hangover of the Cold War?
/Radio Free Europe and 
v -Radio Liberty, which for 
many years were presume-
., . . , ? 
? 
bly financed by private con-
tributions, but actually were 
secretly subsidized by the 
CIA with public money. 
Sen. 1 W. Fulbright (D-
Ark.), chairman of the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, has made a deter-
mined but lonely effort to 
put a stop to this expendi-
ture. He had temporarily 
succeeded in heading off an-
other appropriation for 1973, 
but most or his colleagues 
shied from voting against 
anything that has an anti-
Communist label on it, re-
gardless of bow -anachro-
nistic it may be. 
Both Radio Free Europe 
(RFE) and Radio Liberty 
(RL) were established over 
20 years ago at the peak of 
the Cold War to beam news 
and propaganda into Russia 
and its Eastern European 
satellites. The stations oper-
ated under the camouflage 
of private sponsorship but, 
unbeknown to the American 
public, were financed by 
the CIA at a cost of about 
$500 million over the years. 
Backers of the stations 
contend their broadcasts are 
now "objective" and no 
longer dedicated to "roll-
backs" or "liberation" or 
stirring up internal opposi-
tion to the Communist gov-
ernments of Europe. But 
U.S. citizens are already 
being taxed $41 million a 
year to enable the Voice of 
America to provide the 
world with "objective" news 
coverage. The Voice, which 
has 103 transmitters around 
the globe, broadcasts in 36 
languages, devoting 40 per 
cent of its air time to audi-
ences in Communist coun-
tries. 
Neither RFE or RL, of 
course, could get a dime 
from Congress if they were 
not primarily engaged in 
trying to win friends and in-
fluence people in the Rus-
sian orbit at the expense of 
the Communist govern-
ments. However desirable 
this may have been some 
years ago, does it, on bal-
ance, serve the best inter-
ests of the United States 
and the Free World at a 
time described by President 
Nixon as the "new era of ne-
gotiation" rather than "con-
frontation?" 
THE STATIONS have in-
furiated the Soviets, which 
may please some Americans, 
but, as Mr. Nixon prepares 
for his Moscow trip, should 
we be engaging in activities 
which might make it more 
difficult for the United 
States to gain its major Rus-
sian objectives, such as nu-
clear disarmament, stablili-
zation of the Middle East 
and better security arrange-
ments in Eastern Europe? . 
It shouldn't be hard to im-
agine what the U.S. frame 
of mind would be if Russia 
were to establish Radio Free 
America in Cuba, and start 
broadcasting around the 
clock its view of the world 
to American listeners. As 
justification for such an op-
eration, the Soviets no 
doubt would quote Vice 
President Agnew's charges 
that the U.S. press can't be 
trusted. 
In any case, the new US.-
China communique, signed 
by Mr. Nixon in Shanghai, 
pledges the United States to 
support the principle of non-
intervention in the internal 
affairs of other countries. 
How, it is asked, can that be 
squared with further opera-
tions of RFE and RL? 
Finally, if they are to be 
continued, why shouldn't 
they be directed at all the 
totalitarian nations which 
are without a free press? 
Why not Radio Free Pe-
king? Or Radio Free Greece 
?or Spain or Portugal or 
Brazil, or Argentina?to 
name only a few? Sen. Ful-
bright has the answer. 
These radios (meaning RFE 
and RL), he says, "should 
take their rightful place in 
the graveyard of cold war 
relics."

Radio Free 'Europe 
..M-epsure Is Passed 
? The Senate has passed and 
sent to the White House a bill 
to keep Radio Free Europe 
and Radio Liberty in operation 
for the next three months. 
The Senate vote, 65 to 6, 
authorizes $36 million in feder-
al funding for the two stations 
for the 12 months ending June 
30. Most of the money already 
has been spent under emer-
gency appropriations. 
The House earlier this week 
yielded to the insistence of 
high-place senators that the 
stations ? which long had 
been financed secretly by the 
Central Intelligence Agency ? 
should be openly financed by 
the government for only one 
year instead of two. 
Doubt about the future of 
the stations after June 30 was 
emphasized yesterday by the 
votes of influential senators, in 
effect, to shut clown the 
stations immediately by deny-
ing them money. Voting 
against funding even for the 
next three months were Sens. 
Mike Mansfield of Montana, 
the Senate Democratic leader; 
J. W. Fulbright, D-Ark., chair-
man of the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee; and Allen 
J. Ellender, D-La., chairman 
of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee. 
Other negative votes came 
from Sens. Harold Hughes of 
Iowa, William Proxmire of 
Wisconsin and Stuart Syming-
ton of Missouri, all Demo-
crats. 
In a months-long campaign 
to end taxpayer support of the 
stations, Fulbright called them 
"relics of the cold war" and a 
continued thorn in East-West 
relations. 
Some senators have said 
they want the stations termi-
nated and others want them

ported by other partners of the

lantic community. ? AP. .

were directed at childrens'

Financing the radios 
Sen. J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, 
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, is obsessed with the need to 
MOdernize America's obsolete cold war for-
eign policy. There is no doubt that change 
? is necessary in many areas (as President 
'Nixon's dramatic turnabout on China has 
- .demonstrated). But Sen. Fulbright's obses-
?-sion, like many another, has led to some 
bizarre abberations. 
Consider his determination to close 
.down Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty 
because they are "relics of the cold war" 
which the Soviet Union doesn't like. 
If Radio Free Europe and Radio Lib-
erty were, in fact, the blatant propaganda 
outlets Mr. Fulbright seems to consider 
them, there might be some foundation for 
lie belief. The senator no doubt recalls that 
during the Hungarian revolt of 1956 RFE 
recklessly implied that American aid might 
forthcoming for the insurrection. And he 
was irritated a couple of years ago when
. 
long-standing suspicions were confirmed 
ad the Central Intelligence Agency ad-
mitted vrtrriling 141oianheirteiwy.-nkeded 
to keep the stations going. 
;- But there is every reason to believe that 
RE learned its lesson in 1956. Since 
then, its news broadcasts,' beamed to mu-
lions Of listeners in Eastern Europe (and 
, those of Radio Liberty, which are broadcast 
to the Soviet Union) have been notable for 
their objectivity and balance. The Soviet 
_ . 
-Union objects to the stations not because 
what they say is inflammatory but because 
they provide a much more complete and 
truthful picture of the world than what is 
available in the rigidly controlled Comm-
nist press. 
And regardless of what pique Mr. Ful-
? bright and his colleagues may have felt at 
:the clandestine CIA financing of the sta-
tions, that episode, too, is in the past. 
The question now ought to be whether 
? it is we for the United States to invest 
$35 million-$38 million a year in providing 
an estimated 300 million listeners in Russia 
.. 
: and Eastern Europe with a relatively un-
`;. biased alternative to the utterly biased, 
t! dogmatic party press. We believe it is. - 
And we hope the wilfully obstructionist, 
and so far quite successful, tactics of Mr. 
' Fulbright, which could cut off fundhig for 
, the stations June 30, are replaced by ton 
mon sense.

SIAM IL 
By WILLIAM J. PfiSIEROY ? 
LONDON, March 17 (By mail)?The recent moves led by Sen. William Fulbright 
to slice away the U.S. funds that have financed that fountainhead of subversion known 
as "Radio Free Europe," along with its sinister sister "Radio Liberty," have brought 
protests from none but the most ardent hate-merchants and Neanderthal cold-war 
. propagandists. 
The London Times, seeking to 
whip up backing for these cold-
war instruments, opened its letter 
columns for opinion on the matter, 
but only one Briton replied, and 
he expressed the belief that "the 
West, and particularly America" 
had been trying for too long to 
Impose its ideas on the socialist 
countries. 
Otherwise the Times has had to 
content itself with dredging in 
and holding up for view some 
strange fish indeed. 
? ? Defector's letter 
One of the smelliest of these is 
the former "Soviet novelist," An-
atoll Kuznetsov, who defected a 
couple of years ago for monetary 
rewards from anti-Soviet publish-
ing houses. Periodically, Kuzne-
tsov is dragged forth from his 
hiding place near London to ut-
ter the most' absurd statements 
about "the lack of freedom un-
der socialism." Recently he sol-
emnly proclaimed the authenti-
city of an anti-Soviet pornograph-
ic comic-strip allegedly pro-
duced in the Soviet Union, which 
turned out to be the fabrication 
of another "artist" defector. 
In a letter to the Times signed 
by Kuznetsov we find this gem 
of a paragraph: 
"I was working on my novel, 
'Crucifixion,' which deals with 
present-day life in the Soviet 
Union. By chance I was actually 
describing an episode in which 
people are listening, through the 
din of the jamming, to `Radio 
Liberty.' The episode is auto-
biographical: I, a Soviet writer, 
like all Soviet intellectuals, had 
for many years learnt the truth 
from one source only?foreign 
broadcasts. They told the truth 
and gave hope." 
The Times also printed a letter 
from a certain Stefan Korbonski, 
who represented himself as chair-
man of "Assembly of Captive 
European Nations" based in New 
York. Korbonski also was de-
pressed by the thought of "Radio 
Free Europe" losing its boice, 
but he had prospects of hope for 
"the peoples of Bulgaria, Czech-
oslovakia, Hungary, Poland and 
Rumania": 
Mao to the rescue 
"Surely," he wrote, "it would 
not kill their striving for inde-
pendence but, paradoxically, 
might result in shifting their 
hopes towards the People's Re-
public of China, which alone of 
the great powers shows some 
interest in East European coun-
tries regaining their independ-
ence. This interest was demon-
strated by several announcements 
of the Peking Government and, 
not so long ago, by the vehe-
ment condemnation of the Soviet 
invasion of Czechoslovakia by the 
present Chinese delegation to 
the United Nations. It is also be-
ing demonstrated by Radio Pe-
king broadcasts to East Europe." 
So now we have it, from the 
mouth of the CIA-supported anti-
Soviet emigre gangs, the pro-
fascists whom the people of 
Eastern Europe are glad to get 
rid of: the logical successor of 
"Radio Free Europe" is seen by 
them as Radio Peking.

Bonn 
Chancellor Willy Brandt's government says itis conferring with Washington 
On the future of the American broadcast stations in Munich: Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty. 
Government spokesman Conrad Ahlers says Bonn recognizes the significance 
of the U.S.-financed radio stations in providing information to the people in 
the Soviet bloc. But at the same time it wants to avoid possible harm to the 
"foreign relations of the federal West German republic." ' 
The problem is that the Soviets take a dim view of the stations ? and have 
said so during recent negotiations over roadblocks to East-West detente in 
Europe. ? 
Mr. Ahlers was commenting on a call for the closure of the stations made 
In telegrams to President Nixon and Chancellor Brandt by a group of seven 
parliamentarians of Mr. Brandt's Social Democratic Party. 
The U.S. House of Representatives has voted funds to keep the two stations 
going through June 30. The bill has been sent to the Senate, where Chairman 
J. W. Fulbright of the Foreign Relations Committee has been leading a cam-
paign against the two "relics of the cold war." 
The telegrams called on Mr. Nixon to halt financing of the stations after. 
June 30 and make their frequencies available to the Cologne-based "Deutsche 
.Welle" station, which they .said could just as well provide "realistic re-
portage" to the Soviet bloc. 
At the same time, they said it could not be denied that both radios hail 
abandonedthe policy of disseminating "unmistakable anti-Communist propa-
ganda" they had followed during the cold-war days of the early 1950's.

'U.S. radio-broadcast funding STATINTL 
By Paul Wohl 
Written for The Christian Science Pefonttor 
, Sen. J. W. Fulbright's efforts to block 
the funding of Radio Free Europe and Ra-
dio Liberty, the two Munich-based American 
radio stations, have severely shocked many 
people in .Russia and Eastern Europe. 
A recent visitor from Poland reports that 
the irdminent closing of "Warsaw Four," 
as Poles call Radio Free Europe, is the 
main subject of political discussions in War-
saw's _caf? 
? Not even Communist dissenters want the 
-West to revert to cold-war politics. But 
every indication of Western determination 
to defend its rights and values is applauded 
In the .East.? 
Castro vs. Battista 
This writer remembers how, during the 
Cuban Crisis, educated East Europeans ex-
pressed their satisfaction over America's 
stand. 
These people preferred -Fidel Castro to 
Battista and Communist to capitalist ways. 
But they were weary of Russian heavyhand-
edness. They did not want to be compressed 
into a monolith. 
Deep in their thoughts was the old fear of 
the Russian steamroller, ever ready to flatten 
any kind of nonconformism. 
As long as the West, and especially Amer-
ica, stood firm, the steamroller) they felt, 
was stalled. 
The occupation of Czechoslovakia really 
shook most East Europeans, including party 
members. The trauma still lingers. 
This may explain why politically alert 
East Europeans reacted bitterly to the news 
that Radio Free Europe is likely to be 
closed down. ? 
Uncomplimentary names 
In Czechoslovakia, Mr. Fulbright has 
been referred to as "Fulbricht" ? which 
brings to memory the name of East Ger-
many's Walter Ulbricht. Poles use a play 
on words which makes Mr. Fulbright's 
name sound like a vulgar Polish epithet. 
To emphasize how much the Senator's policy 
favors the not overly popular Russians,. his 
name also is russified into Fulbraitov. 
The Soviets, on the other hand, are satis-
fied. A 225-page book by the Arkansas 
Democrat on "The Arrogance of Power" 
was brought out in Russian in 1967. Toward 
the end of last year the Moscow publishing 
house "International Relations" published a 
271-page Fu/bright biography by V. B. 
eners criticize 
Vorontsov under the title "The Senator from 
Arkansas." 
Privately the Communist leaders are 
elated. According to a report from dissent-
ing Communists, a recent ideological con-
ference in Moscow devoted to fighting anti-
communism concluded: "We do not have 
to do anything right now. Leave it all to Ful 
-/ 
bright." , 
Grain's of truth 
While there can be no doubt that most 
East Europeans and Soviet dissenters, in-
cluding many rank and file Communists, 
are disappointed', there is nevertheless more 
than a grain of truth in Senator Fulbright's 
contention that the two stations are popu-
larly identified with some of the grimmest 
phases of the cold war. 
Actually they have long ceased to be cold-
war propaganda outlets 'and have become 
information niedi,a of a special kind which 
keep their walled up audiences alert. 
The fact is that they are not official gov-
ernment stations. Though under Washing-
ton's general political supervision, they 
have enough leeway to be flexible and 
enough autonomy to call a spade a spade. 
And this fact enhances their plausibility. 
Some observers say much of the cold-war 
sting would be removed if the two stations 
were given less innocuous names. Radio 
Liberty already is an improvement over 
its original name, "Radio Liberation." 
? Latvian born Arsene Eglis, who has long 
been connected with Radio Liberty, sug-
gests combining the two stations under the 
name of "Radio West." 
Merger possibility 
A merger of the two stations, of their re-
search staffs and of their broadcasting fa-
cilities, would mean substantial savings. 
Yet it is doubtful whether the two can be 
combined. 
Radio Free Europe appeals to East Euro-
pean audiences, is manned by seasoned spe-
cialists for the various East European coun-
tries, and broadcasts in East European 
languages, 
Radio Liberty employs, as consultants 
former Soviet citizens, especially from na-
tional minorities. Its broadcasts are in Rus-
sian and in Soviet 'minority languages. 
If Radio Liberty is to be maintained, as . 
most Americans with firsthand knowledge 
of Soviet and East European conditions 
hope, there is good reason to urge that its 
name be changed to indicate that the West 
has effectively abandoned a cold-war ap-
proach. The present name?in many East 
European eyes?somewhat arrogantly im-
plies that there is complete political liberty 
in the West and that liberty does not exi 
at all in the East. 
One suggestion is an invocation of the is 
of the three rallying slogans of the Frem 
Revolution ? Liberty, Equality, Fraterni? 
? by changing the name of Radio Liberty ? 
"Radio Brotherhood." 
Broadcasts of Radio Free Europe, on tt 
other hand, might sound less condescem 
ing if they went under the name of "Rad: 
West" or "Inter-Europe Radio."

. The Congress of the United 
States is an oft-misunderstood 
institution. The recent working 
of a House-Senate Conference 
'Committee on legislation to de-. 
ride the fate of Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty have s 
certainly not made Congress any 
easier to understand. . 
The, Conference Committee 
was deadlocked on the question 
; of how long to fund both radio 
networks. The House side wanted 
. to provide funding for a two-
year period and the Senate in-
issted on approving funding only 
through this fiscal year ? which 
ends June 30. Neither side was 
willing to compromise. 
The Senate conferees showed 
little inclination to yield to the 
House because of the conviction 
of some that Radio Free Europe 
and, Radio Liberty are tolls of 
; the Cold War and now strain 
our relations with the Soviet 
? Union. 
I disagree with this assess-
ment. 1 believe it is important 
' for those living in totalitarian 
societies to hear uncensored 
news reports and other programs, 
characteristic of a free and ?pert; 
society. 
Radio Free' Europe and Radio 
? Liberty have, over the years, built 
up large followings, the former in 
Eastern Europe and the latter 
Approved ForiReleaset20111103/04 : CIA-RDP80-01601R001100070001-5 
These broadcasts ?in. most 
cases represent the only link the 
people of these nations have, 
not just with the free world, but 
also with the events occurring 
within their own countries. We 
have ? an obligation to maintain 
this Jlink. 
Of course Congree also has an 
obligation 'to give funding re-
quests for all federal programs 
careful scrutiny. 
In the past no specific fund-
ing action for Radio Free Europe 
and Radio Liberty was required 
on the part of Congress. Both 
networks then were run by the 
Ce n t rgintelligence Agepc.y4rp? 
funds in the CIA budget, a raZt 
which. surprised and shocked a 
large seg,thent of the public when, 
it was revealed last year. 
Now both radio networks are 
under the control of the State 
Department ? a much more 
proper arrangement, I think. We 
do not, need a covert intelligence 
agency to sell America to the ? 
community world. America can 
sell itself openly, without em-
barassment. We have nothing. to 
hide . . just a great deal to 
offer. 
.Last week, after much wrang-
ling, the Conference Committee 
finally agreed to fund the two 
networks through this fiscal year 
and to require annual appropria-?-
tions for their operation in the . 
future. ? 
The reason for this require-
ment was the Committee's belief 
that these radio stations, like all 
other federal programs, should 
be fustified to Congree on the 
basis of each year's performance.. 
Of eourse we should demand con-
tinued excellence from our main ' 
voices to the community world.

For U.S. Radio in Europe 
WASHINGTON, March 22 
(Reuters)=The House passed 
compromise legislation today 
providing funds for Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty until 
June 30. 
The Senate is expected to 
complete Congressional action 
on the bill tomorrow. 
The funding for the United 
States radio stations, which 
broadcast from West Germany 
to Eastern Europe and the So-
viet Union, expired on Feb. 22. 
The original House proposal, 
backed by the Nixon Adminis-
tration, would have provided 
funds for the stations until the 
middle of next year. 
Fresh funds were delayed in 
the Senate in a fight led by 
Senator J. W. Fulbright, chair-
man of the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee, who de-
scribed the stations as relics 
of the cold war. -

AlTied backers plead 
r Free Euro 
By Harry B. Ellis 
Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Munich, Germany 
Virtually every major newspaper in West-
ern Europe, including Die Welt of Hain-
- burg, Le Monde .of Paris, Switzerland's 
Neue Zuercher Zeitung, and the Times 
' of London, editorially urg,.-!-, -the retention 
of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. 
Radio Liberty beams news and comment 
almost around the clock to the Soviet Union. 
.RFE does the same to the other nations 
? of the Soviet bloc. Together the stations, 
which were founded in the early 1950's and 
are based here in Munich, broadcast in more 
than 20 languages. ? 
Thousands of East bloc listeners have 
written to Munich to say that the two radios 
represent the letter writers' only source of 
,unbiased information on developments with-
in their own countries. 
The government of Chancellor Willy 
? Brandt continues to voic'e support for the 
stations,. despite Communist demands that. 
the two stations be expelled from West Ger-
man soil. 
Sen. J. W. Fulbright (D) of Arkansas, 
however, describes the radio stations, which 
1,/until recently were financed by the U.S. 
-Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as "rel-
ics of the cold war," and urges their shut-
down. 
Senator Fulbright has blocked further fi-
nancing of the stations, which employ more 
than 2,000 people, including many East bloc 
emigres, beyond June 30, while -Congress 
debates their future. 
"Why," demanded a European observer, 
"should the radios be shut down, simply 
because they irritate the Soviets? Have the 
Russians stopped building up their mili-
tary power, because this alarms us?" 
A West European advisory committee of 
RFE, headed by former NATO Secretary-
General Dirk Stikker, now is exploring 
whether Europeans governments might 
'help finance the stations. 
Hundreds of interviews conducted over 
ithe years by Western analysts confirm that 
.ordinary Poles, Hungarians, Romanians, 
:Bulgarians, and Soviet citizens listen to 
? RFE and Radio Liberty more often and with 
? greater trust, than to the Voice of America 
(VOA), Deutsche Welle, Radio Paris, Radio 
Vatican, and other official stations. RFE 
alone has an estimated audience of 55 mil-
lion. 
Anatoli Kuznetsov, a Russian writer who 
fled to Britain, wrote to the London Times 
that closing down the two stations would 
fulfill one of the most ardent wishes of the 
KGB, the- intelligence organ of the Soviet 
Government. 
He, like other Soviet intellectuals, Mr. 
Kuznetsov wrote, depended on foreign radio 
stations for truthful reporting that "gave 
hope." 
"VOA, Deutsche Welle, even the BBC," 
declared an analyst, "aim at promoting the 
image of their country of origin." 
Policy changed 
He meant that VOA expresses an official 
American point of view. Deutsche Welle 
does the same for the West German Gov-
ernment; and even the BBC, the analyst 
said, reflects a British outlook. 
"RFE, on the other hand, takes an active 
Interest in East European countries and peo-
ples ? identifies with their aspirations. 
"Where Radio Free Europe is unrivaled," 
the expert went on, "is in'detailedreporting 
on events within Eastern Europe." 
. Station officials agree that in the early 
1950's when U.S. State Department policy 
under John Foster Dulles was keyed to a 
Communist "rollback," the two stations 
stressed a cold-war line. 
Then came the abortive Hungarian re-
volt, which, as one official put it, "taught 
the West that communism _could not be 
rolled back by words alone."' ? 
Since then the tone of the two radios 
has evolved, until today the thrust of their 
programming is objective reporting of 
political, economic, cultural, and athletic 
events behind the iron curtain. Library of 
Congress studies say of Radio Liberty, for 
instance, that it is neither "a cold-war 
operation nor is its staff a group of cold 
warriors." 
The Soviet Government, analysts report, 
makes it harder for Soviet citizens to hear 
Radio Liberty by jamming its broadcasts. 
RFE programa are jammed in Czechoslo-
vakia, Bulgaria, and Poland, but not in 
Hungary or Romania.

WASHINGTON, March 18 ? 
"Radio Free Europe" extorts free 
poster space on buses and sub-
ways across the nation to plead 
for the nickels ? and dimes of 
school children to keep alive its 
broadcasts to socialist countries. 
But Senators J. W. Fulbright 
(D-Ark) and Clifford Case (R-
NJ), in speeches in Congress, 
revealed that "Radio Free Eur-
ope" and its partner, "Radio 
Liberty," are wholly olimed sub-
sidiaries of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency, which wallowed 
in $480 million in taxpayer ap-
propriations in the past 20 years. 
Senator Case introduced legis-
lation to prohibit the CIA from 
continuing its secret funding of 
RFE and RL and to require 
that all future U.S. appropriations 
for the networks be a matter of 
public record. 
Senator Fulbright, chairman of 
the Foreign Relations Committee, 
went further. He proposed out-
right liquidation of the stations, 
and cited President Nixon's com-
munique from. Peking extolling 
"non-interference" in the internal 
affairs of other nations, lie wryly 
noted that Nixon shuns the idea 
of a "Radio Free China." . 
RFE and RL, said Fulbright, 
are "based on nothing more than 
an arrogant belief that people 
around the world will act like 
we want' them to act if we only 
tell them how." 
One-year fund voted 
However, Fulbright, Case and 
others yielded this week to the 
cold warriors and agreed to a 
one-year U.S. appropriation of $36 
million for RFE and RL ? the 
first time since 1950 that the 
U.S. appropriation for these sta-
tions has been a matter of pub-
lic record. RFE and RL had 
asked for a two-year appropria-
tion. 
"They will have to come back 
next year," said an aide to Ful-
bright. "They are going to have 
to erase some doubts before these 
Programs are going to be re-
:r1 
I'L9 ,40, 
newed. It. is incomprehensible 
how the U.S. could give away 
$480 million over a 20-year period 
for these radio stations." 
Fulbright inserted in the Con-
gressional Record separate re-
ports on the two stations written 
by Joseph C. Whelan and James 
-
Robert Price, anti-Soviet experts 
on the payroll of the Library of 
Congress. The reports sing praises 
to the two stations, but biogra-
phies of the two authors appended 
to the reports indicate why: both 
are CIA agents. Whelan, the re-
port on RL declares, was "Brief-
ly employed" by the CIA in 1951. 
Price, author of the report on 
RFE "was employed by the CIA" 
from 1950-1857. . . . 
'Sam izdat' opera tion 
Whelan defends "Radio Liberty" 
as the main instrument for pro-
moting "liberalization" in the So-
viet Union. His booklength report 
dwells for several chapters on 
"Sarnizdat," the anti-socialist 
writings of disgruntled Soviet 
"liberals" which are circulated 
in manuscript form because their 
authors are unable to find pub-
lishers. 
Whelan's report describes Ra-
dio Liberty as "the principal 
source for disseminating "sami-
zdat" throughout the Soviet 
Union." 
In a chapter titled "Main De-
pository of Sarnizdat," Whelan 
declares, "For RL samizdat is 
the beginning of a harvest after 
years of labor sowing the seeds 
of democracy in the Soviet Union. 
"RL has the largest-deposit of 
samizdat in the world to draw 
upon for its programming. and 
its archives are growing daily. 
What RL does is magnify the au-
dience from .what would ordi-. 
narily be a small network to 
embrace a national constituency. 
"In so doing, RL has become 
a prime source for uniting the 
disparate elements of samizdat 
producers. Thus, by becoming a 
prime transmitter of samizdat, 
RI, has contributed substantially-
to this self generating phenorne-
Interventions cited 
' The "abortive" rebellion in: 
East. Berlin in 1953, Price de-
clared, caused RFE "to develop 
a technique of 'chipping away' 
at Communi,st power structures. 
Frontal attacks against the Com-
munist regimes were downgrad-
ed in favor of progress designed 
to encourage long range and sub-
tle attitudinal changes among the 
listeners until objective condi-
tions favoring -a radical change 
are established." 
He explains how RE used this 
technique to promote and guide 
the anti-socialist crisis in Cze-
choslovakia in 1968. Instead of 
promoting open, armed counter-
revolution. RFE urged ideological 
and political sabotage from within. 
Whelan confirms that this tac-
tic was employed by RL as well. 
"Guidances were planned and 
formulated as the crisis gather-
ed momentum," he- declared. 
"Monthly and daily guidelines 
provided continuing ad hoc guid-
ance, with caution the key word. 
Contingency plans for program-
ming were made on July 30, well 
in advance of the crisis of Aug. 
21, the day of invasion." 
Adopted socialist mask 
Whelan reports that Radio Li-
berty assumed the guise of. a 
partisan of socialism "with a hu-
man face;" and that it bemoaned 
the intervention of the Warsaw 
Pact in Czechoslovakia as a "loss 
of moral, ethical and practical 
positions for. the Soviet Union . . 
the damage to the cause of so-
cialism and of liberalization at 
home; and the irreparable split 
in the world Communist move-
ment." 
Price reveals that RFE has a 
full time staff of 1,611, of whom 
211 are U.S. citizens and the re-
mainder anti-Communist emi-
gres. The costs of the station in 
1971 were $22,356,876. 
Both RFE and RI? Price de-
clared, "had hitherto ostesibly 
been supported by private funds 
but had actually been largely 
funded by the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 
"Although the author of this I 
port did not interview offich

Mirror of opinion  
No yielding 
Reputedly Radio Liberty is providing an: 
alternative. free radio- program for Russiari 
listeners, and has become, with a large 
audience, a channel for broadcasting back 
, to Russia what the dissident Russian writ-
ers and intellectuals are prevented from 
publishing in their country. To silence those 
stations would confirm and condone the sup-
pression of free speech in Russia and the 
rest of the Soviet bloc. No wonder the Soviet 
lead-2rs_are using such diplomatic levers as 
they have to hand to bring this about. . . 
There should be no yielding. For if, as a 
matter of diplomatic tactics or supposed 
principle, Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty are to be stopped, then the BBC's 
external services, it might be argued, should 
be muzzled too. In any event, the BBC ser-
vices, excellent and important as they are, 
need to be augmented by broadcasts such 
as those put out by Radio Free Europe. 
Similarly, the Voice of America broadcasts 
are a more distant link with the outside 
world, whereas Radio Free Europe has been 
able to establish a more informal relation 
with an eager audience using medium wave-
lengths. Have the- American congressmen 
really taken these factors into account??

In past years, USIA has had

'UNDER A RECENT

The effort to scuttle the two I 
radio stations began last year 
with disclosures in the Senate 
that they were being supported . 
secretly by the Central In-

For years there have been 
rumors USIA, too, is linked with 
CIA:

ran us we wouldn't be so fouled

While there is some talk on 
Capitol Hill of doing away with 
USIA entirely, serious debate 
centers on the agency's size. Its 
9,881 employes are more, ac-
cording to a former USIA offi-
cial, than those employed full-
time on propaganda by all other 
nations combined.' Its role in 
U.S. foreign policy, and the tone 
and quality of its product will? 
also be questioned.

State, indeed, Would probably 
like to have control over the 
agency, now legally bound only 
to listen to the State's policy 
guidance. 
BUT SHAKESPEARE, has 
pushed hard to give USIA a 
higher positron in the policy 
to get 
? P , specifically 
'it back on the National Security 
Council from which President ,/ 
Nixon excluded it three years

"If you are going to ef-

Von a worldwide basis it is 
necessary to hav.? the deepest 
possible understanding of the 
nuances," Shakespeare in an. 
-interview said. 
1 Because Shakespeare was and 
I is an outspoken anti-Communist, 
I there was open speculation in 
I Washington that USIA would 
speak more stridently after he 
took over. The official line, 
however; has not grown per-
ceptibly harder. 
"Mr. Shakespeare is as firmly 
anti-Communist as he ever 
was," said one top-ranking 
agency official. "But I think he's 
more subtle than when he first 
came here. That's because he 
has traveled and has a better 
understanding of world affairs. 
It was inevitable." 
SHAKESPEARE ALSO went a' 
long way toward improving 
strained agency morale by en-
couraging young officers to form 
a grievance committee which 
can see him at. a moment's 
notice. The consequence of that: 
A dearth of serious grievances. 
As for the. agency's products, 
Bruce Herschensohn, head of the

Communist countries and unless 
a film serves one of these puf-
poses USIA doesn't use it." .' 
? Under Herschensohn, the 
agency has turned out films on 
Vice ? President Agnew; the 
"Silent Majority," and Honor 
America , Day. It spent $250,000 
on a Vietnam war documentary 
so blatantly one-sided that only 
three of USIA's 106 posts would 
accept it. 
AT THE SAME .t i m e, 
however, the agency has pro-
duced three films in the past 
three years that have either won 
or been nominated for an 
Academy .Award.. A documen-
tary on the Soviet invasion of 
Czechoslovakia won an Oscar. 
The other two dealt with life in 
this country. ? 
The agency's magazine sec-

produces, along with dozens of

edition was devoted to dissent in 
the United States and quoted 
altn0 every notable from .osie

the other. 
I ? The unspoken message was 
that the United States is an open

MOST OBJECTIVE of USIA's 
divisions is the Voice of America 
which uses 109 transmitters to 
broadcast straight, factual news, 
plus music,. features' and 
generally noncommittal com-
mentaries in 35 languages. 
Although VOA personnel ?con-
sider themselves professional 
newsmen and take great glee in 
ignoring policy directives, the 
division gets an occasional 
nudge. 
During Nixon's Cbina visit, 
according to one VOA officer,

. and the prospect of longer-
term Government financial 
backing. .. 
? --?? 
? At the 'same time the arch 
,enemy of the two stations, the 
chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, Senator 
William Eulbright, has shown 
signs of softening his oprrosition. 
Senator Falbright originally 
,called for an end to the two 
;stations which he called "relics. 
of the Cold War " and his 
op-position caused. a deadlock 
between the Senate and the 
House of Representatives over 
the question of. further financial 
aid. . 
? A -conference of representa-
?tives of both House of Repre-
;sentatives and the Senate has 
'now. reached a compromise to 
.continue' financial support until 
.the end of June. Before that 
-date it will ;hold meetings to. 
;discuss the question of providing 
government aid after June 30 
:on a more permanent basis. 
This agreement followed a 
.personal appeal to Congress last. 
week by President Nixon who 
stated that he was "deeply con-
cerned about the imminent pros-
pect that they may be compelled 
to shut down. 
" With the support of the 
American Government and 
people, these two unique voices 
of freedom have for many years 
been a vital source of uncen-
sored news and commentary for 
tens of millions of people in 
'Eastern ;Europe and the Soviet 
.Union," hc said. ? 
Financed by CIA 
Sen. Fulbrig.ht said originally--
that a? Bill for another year's - 
financing of the stations would 
have to be passed "over his 
dead body." 
Since then, 63 of the 100 
American senators have co-
sponsored a resolution to keep 
the stations going. 
These include nine out of 10 
members of Sen. rulbright's 
own Foreign Relations Corn-
, 
-mittee. 
)Sen. Fulbright has now said 
that if some Western Turope.n 
countries would he prepared to 
..make a contribution to the sup-
port of the stations most of his 
doubts would be removed. 
The two stations broadcast to 
Eastern European countries 
and -Russia and in past years 
were largely financed by the 
American spy network. the 
Central' Intelligence Agency.

ended it was replaced on an

Radio Free Europe 
I would like to emphasize that the liqui-
dation of Radio Free Europe (INTERNA-
TIONAL, March 6), would be interpreted 
by the peoples of Bulgaria, Czechoslo-
vakia, Hungary, Poland and Rumania as 
final recognition by the United States of 
the permanency of the Soviet rule in East 
Europe. Surely it would not kill their 
striving for independence but, paradoxi-
cally, might result in shifting their hopes 
toward the People's Republic of China, 
which alone of the great powers shows 
some interest in East European countries 
regaining their independence. 
STEFAN KORBONSKI 
Chairman 
Assembly of Captive European Nations 
New York, N.Y. 
? The fact that Sen. William Fulbright, 
so often portrayed a a defender of indi-
vidual liberties, could "liquidate" Radio 
Free Europe and Radio Liberty is almost 
totally unbelievable. If these stations pro-
vide Eastern Europe with its only recep-
tion of objective news they should be 
continued regardless of who is funding 
them. At least, the people should have 
the opportunity to hear something other 
than a censored Communist press. 
? The initials CIA may often be associ-
ated with political intrigue, but in light 
of the favorable reports given to RFE 
and Radio Liberty by various sources 
both in and outside the Communist bloc, 
the good senator has definitely aimed his. . 
sights at the wrong target. 
JOSEPH BERTOLLO III 
Hawthorne, N.J. 
? Senator Fulbright is one of the few pol-
iticians I admire because of his ability to 
see things as they really are. Radio Free 
Europe belongs in the museum of cold-
war relies. 
.As an ex-Czechoslovakian, I would 
like to inform your American readers 
what Czech people- think about RFE. 
Today only a very few people listen to 
RITE because there has been a good deal 
of misinformation based on anti-Commu-
nist propaganda. Strangely enough, peo-
ple feel there is not too much difference 
between propaganda from any source, 
and RFE definitely has done damage to 
listeners' morale and faith. As a source 
of objective information, RFE is today 
considered as reliable as Radio MOSCOW.

rETTERS TO THE TENIES, 
Can't Afford to Let 
Radio Free Europe Die 
I would like to reinforce the state-
mints you made in an editorial 
(Feb, 24) on Radio Free Europe. I 
in very familiar with that organiza-
tion as in 1963 I took a two-year 
leave of absence from my company 
:to work in Munich as deputy to the 
director of RFE appci later extended 
the leave two more years because of 
the tremendous value of what they 
.,.are doing. 
I ani deeply shocked by the at-
tempt of Sen. J. William Fulbright 
..(D-Ark.) to kill both FIFE and Radio 
;Liberty. They are indeed, as he says, 
"relics of the cold war" but this im-
plies that other relics of the cold ?war 
.--particularly the denial of basic 
Totalitarianigin's Little Helper 
freedoms to the people of Eastern 
Europe?no longer exist, And that is 
Patently untrue. It also implies that 
these two radio groups operate with-
in cold war concepts. Also quite 
untrue. 
The fact is that for many years 
both organizations have had to-fight 
the charge of simplistic Americans 
that they have "sold, out" to liberal 
forces within their ranks because 
they have not engaged in cold war 
tactics. Instead of name-calling and 
finger - pointing (I suspect most 
Americans are convinced this still 
hagoess been to Approve on) their task for many y r.-

and give their listeners a true per- years after the occuPation of Czech-
spective on (a) what is happening in 
their own country, (b) what is hap-
pening in the rest of the world. 
The statement made- so often that 
the Voice of America and the BBC 
can give them news of the world is 
true. No other group, however, can 
interpret internal bloc de v el o p-
ments as quickly and responsibly as 
can RFE. They peg the lies, distor-
tions and party fulminations as soon 
as they erupt, this because over the 
years they have assembled the most 
extensive library on Communist 
countries existing anywhere. 
A letter writer to your paper 
(March 7) describes these operations 
as "self righteous ' meddline.." On 
that basis we are also "meddling" in 
Peking, the Middle East, Africa, 
South America and Asia. As are the 
Russians. And the Chinese. Operat-
ing in this very real world, we had 
better continue to "meddle." 
GORDON DAVIS

If there is one thing that is likely 
-to reduce the, threat to us in West-
ern Europe and ultimately to you 
Americans it is change within the 
Soviet Union and increased internal 
pressure on the Russian leaders to 
change their policies. Since World 
War II both Radio Liberty and Ra-
dio Free Europe have been broad-
casting across the Iron Curtain with 
just this aim in mind. 
I understand that Radio Liberty 
alone has an estimated, audience of 
31 million in Russia, but now the 
work that they are doing is threa-
tened with extinction. 
The cost of running a radio station 
Is hut, a small fraction of the cost of 
maintaining a modern army, but the 
benefits can be much greater.

The objections to The-Times' edi--
torial position on Radio Free. Eu-
rope voiced by Cleorge Holmes and 
Frei Warner Neal (Letters, March 
7) are, in my view, unfounded. In re-
sponse to the former, RFE"aims pre-
oslovakia, it hardly needs to be re-
peated that the peoples of Eastern 
Europe do not presently enjoy this 
right. RFE. provides an ersatz 
domestic communications medium 
for societal forces in Eastern Eu-
rope seeking evolutionary political' 
liberalization, national affirmation, 
and in time relaxation (not abolish-
ment) of Soviet control over the area 
and supersession of the artificial 
partition of Europe. 
Professor Neal depicts RFE as 
broadcasting cold war propaganda 
which lizt no impact on the East Eu-
ropean populations. This is to over-
look overwhelming evidence to the 
contrary. Continued jamming is per-
haps the best indication that, for the 
East European Communist lead-. 
erships, more is at stake than false 
hopes of -Communists and, 
curiosity about rock music. I know.

More on Radio Free Europe 
,4:Coexistence, or detente, or 
whatever it happens to be called 
at the moment, must not be mis-
understood to mean an end to the 
conflict of ideologies. Communism 
uses the press and broadcasting to 
manage public opinion in the inter-
ests of the state. One of the funda-
mentals of a free society is that 
people should be free to think and 
say 'what they want, and should 
have the communications media 
open to them to do so. There 
should be no yielding here." 
The lines above are taken from 
an editorial in the Manchester 
Guardian weekly suggesting that 
the United States should continue 
the operation of Radio Free Eu-
rope and Radio Liberty, transmit-
ting news and opinion from a free 
society into the closed society of 
Eastern Europe and the Soviet 
Union. Government funding of the 
stations now is hung up in a?con-
ference committee in Congress; 
the proposal of the Nixon adminis-
tration and the House of Repre-
sentatives to appropriate money to 
maintain the stations is being 
resisted by the Senate Members of 
the conference committee led by 
Senator Fulbright. 
Mr. Fulbright and the senators 
who share his position hold that 
the .broadcasts, which in the past 
were covertly financed by the 
CIA, are relics of the cold war and 
irritants in the way of better rela-
tions with the Soviet Union. The 
Guardian puts the subject in a 
truer perspective when it says: 
"To silence these stations would 
indeed remove an irritant, but it 
would confirm and condone the 
suppression of free speech in 
Russia and the rest of the Soviet 
bloc. No wonder the Soviet leaders 
are using such diplomatic levers 
as they have at hand to bring this 
about."

fire from an esteemed in-

Copley Press, Dumitru

This writer's attack is 
.squarely on target, and I pass it 
'on to you because you should 
know what one United States 
Senator is doing to a proven 
'effective anti-corn munist effort. 
Sen. J. William Fulbright's 
stubborn determination to

by communism, but by the

enunciated by liberal 
Politicians, commentators and 
authors who find "our enemies

are always wrong." 
Much of the comment on

'Red China follows this line. 
Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty, two 
organizations created in the 
early 50s to beam true in-

'American, therefore, they must

'erroneous information about ,

the United States from Com-

Fulbright says that they are 
useless and must go. The 
financing of the two stations for 
years was handled mostly by 
,i'La'eaNba'ais it to be public. The 
"House is in favor of continuing 
the operations. In the Senate the 
decision rests with the Foreign

by Sen. Fulbright, D-Ark. 
He is adamant. The stations 
are an "anachronism" he says. 
"They are cold war relics." ? 
They will continue only over his 
"dead body." The cold war is 
over and we plat aren't smart 
enough to know it. 
I have often been a critic of 
RIFE operations, I say now that 
on every count Fulbright is 
wrong. The cold war is not over. 
It goes on more furiously than 
ever. 
If the cold war was over, 
why do the Soviets make every 
kind of propaganda to disband 
NATO, to promote a phony 
European Security conference, 
to bring about the disrnem-
berment of Yugoslavia? Use 
every means to push the United 
States from Europe, the :

Africa? Why do they support 
every kind of subversive, anti-
capitalist group in the Free 
World? 
Moscow and other Com-

Europe have been ranting for 
years against RFE and Radio 
Liberty. They even threatened 
not to send teams to the 
Olympic Games in Munich in 
1972 unless theaatakipns there

Now the blOmcomes from

these two voices 'would?in the

Dart: to the Newspaper Guild, for calling on 
Congress to continue funding for Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty. A Guild resolution 
says that the two projects "seek to lessen tensions 
between the peoples of the East and West." In fact, 
they are official propaganda agencies, and the 
Guild's continuing interest appears to be a hang-
over from the days when the Guild itself was in-
volved in Central Intelligence Agency funding. 
Radio Free Europe employs 284 Guild members. 
Laurel: to WNET, New York, for its week-long

Nixon Urges 
Hill to Save

Associated Press 
esident Nixon appealed to. 
Congress yesterday in a last

Unless they have assurance 
of more U.S. government' 
funds, Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty have served no-

Mr. Nixon's statement came 
as the administration put for-
ward a compromise offer in its 
dispute with the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee 
chairman, Sen. J. W. Fulbright 
(1)-Ark.), who wants to end the 
two operations. 
"I am deeply concerned at, 
the imminent prospect that 
Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty may be compelled to 
shut down," Mr. Nixon said in 
Et, statement put out by the 
White House. 
Stating that the American 
people and an overshelming 
congressional m aj orit y 
strongly back Radio Free Eu-
rope and Radio Liberty, the 
President said, "It would be al 
tragedy if their light should I 
now be extinguished because 
of a parliamentary impasse be-

State Department off.icials. 
said that in the hope of quick-
ly breaking the Senate-House-
conference-committee dead-
lock over continuing the life 
of the stations, this admini-
stration compromise offer has 
benn put forward. 
The Senate-passed bill 
which would carry on the ra-
dios until the end of June 30 
would be accepted by the con-
ferees instead of the House 
measure which would continue 
the operations for another two, 
Yeats. ' ,...? 
? 'Both houses *mild agree 
to consider a separate meas-
ure which the administration 
would submit for running the 
radios in the 1973 fiscal year 
starting July 1. ? 
In the three months time 
bought by the proposed com-
promise, the State Department 
would see whether America's 
EuiOpean allies would help 
pay the radios' approximately 
$40-million-a-year cost. 
It was understood that Sen. ' / 
George Aiken (R-Vt.) would I 
make a move Monday to ac-
cept the administration's pro-
posed compromise in the ab-
sence of Fulbright, who was 
reported out of town. 
Rep. Dante Faseell (D-Fla.) 
was reported ready to accept 
the administration offer on 
the House side.

Shall not nation 
speak unto nation? 
Senator William Fulbright's campaign 
against Radio Free Europe, the 
Munich station that has broadcast to 
eastern Europe since the early 1950s, is 
liable to have very unfortunate 
effects. Mr Fulbright, the chairman of 
the Senate's foreign relations com-
mittee, claims that the station and its 
twin, Radio Liberty, which broadcasts 
to Russia, are cold war relics and 
obstacles to detente. He is pressing to 
have their State Department grant 
cut off in June (until last year they 
were ?financed by the CIA). If he is 
successful?and it now looks as if he 
might be?the Administration in 
Washington will suffer only a small 
political pinprick, but the one in 
Moscow will be handed a major 
propaganda victory on a plate. 
The communist governments' 
standard complaint against these 
stations is that they represent unwar-
ranted interference in their internal 
affairs. What really upsets Mr 
Brezhnev and his colleagues is that 
western broadcasts are popular among 
listeners in communist countries, and 
'especially among party members and 
intellectuals. So long as these listeners 
can get alternative versions of political. 
they can free themselves from their 
governments' monopoly of information. 
The Munich stations, in particular, 
have annoyed the communists because 
they have been more outspoken than 
most other western stations. It was 
their original ambition to broadcast 
to eastern Europe the sort of things 
that a responsible opposition would be 
saying if it were allowed to exist there. 
Most of their strident anti-communism 
of the 1950s and early 196os is now 
gone, and Radio Free Europe could 
not now be accused of making inflam-
matory appeals for revolution, as it 
was during the 1956 Hungarian revolt. 
Now MB Fulbright looks like doing 
'the communist governments' work for 
them, and Pravda and Moscow radio 
are duly commending him. But the 
continuation of broadcasting to the 
east remains an essential western 
interest. It is not a liberal action on 
Mr Fulbright's part to try to silence 
this part of it ; and it casts further 
doubts on his understanding of inter-
national issues. If the Americans 
fail to provide alternative ways of 
financing the Niunich stations, others 
should step in to fill the gap. Britain 
might well increase its grant for the 
hard-pressed BBC external services, 
which enjoy a high reputation among 
listeners in the communist world.

By BERNARD GWERTZMAN 
specie to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, March 8 ? 
Secretary of Stat William P. 
'Rogers rejected a suggestion 
Itoday that because of the cur-
rent improvement in relations 
? 
,with China, the United States 
should re-examine its need for 
military alliances in Asia. 
Testifying before the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, 
? Mr. Rogers said it would be 
? "irery unfortunate to leave the 
hripression that, now that the 
visit tb the People's Republic of 
China has taken place, we are! 
thinking of treaty revisions' 
:with countries who have based 
their foreign policy on such 
treaties." 
Panel Might Take on Task 
The Secretary was urged by 
Senator Frank Church, Demo-
.rat of Idaho, to undertake the 
review of American alliances, 
such as the Southeast Asia 
Treaty Organization, which 
were originally set up in the 
nineteen-fifties to counter pos-
sible Chinese expansionism in 
the wake of the Korean war and 
the French Indochina war. 
? Senator Church said that if 
the Administration would not 
undertake a eview of the for-i 
mal defense commitments, thei 
Foreign Relations Committee 
should. 
' Mr. Rogers seemed disturbed. 
at the timing of Mr. Church's 
suggestion. The Administration 
has gone out of its way to 
assure its Asian allies that the 
China trip would not under-
mine ties. 
This was Mr. Rogers's first 
public appearance before the 
committee since October. But 
the committee members seemed 
almost uninterested in ques-
tioning him on such major re-
cent developments as the China 
trip, the forthcoming Presiden-
tial visit toappco,vteottior 
on strategic arms, the Middle 
East, Vietnam .or any of the 
other problems that have re-
ceived public attention. . 
Senator J. W. Fulbright, the 
chairman, and Senator Stuart 
Symington, Democrat of Mis-
souri, devoted a considerable 
amount of time to bickering 
with Mr. Rogers over the value 
of Radio Liberty and Radio 
Free Europe, two American-run 
radio stations in Munich whose 
future depends on further ap-
propriations from Congress.

The two Senators stressed, 
their opposition to the stations;

a limitation on strategic arms 
may have been delayed be-

This morning's session opened 
three days of hearings on

for $563-million in the fiscal 
year starting June 30. 
Change in Procedure 
This is the first time that the 
'department has had to 'apnea 
before the Foreign Relations 
Committee for authorization. 
Previously its budget requests 
were handled solely by the Ap-
propriations Committee, with no 
requirement for separate au. 
thorizing legislation. 
Mr. Fulbright and several 
other Senators questioned Mr. 
Rogers on his role in pol-
icy formulation, with Mr. Ful-
bright suggesting that the Sec-
retary had let Henry A. Kissin-
ger, President Nixon's assistant 
for national security, dominate 
foreign policy. 
But Mr. Rogers repeated In 
essence what he said at a news 
conference yesterday ? that he 
was "perfectly satisfied" with 
the curent division .of respon-
.sibility. ? . ' 
In answer to a question from 
Senator Jacob K. Javits, Repub-

said it was doubtful that the 
President would go to Japan. 
this year because he has "otheri 
things.to attend to" ? an allu-
sion to the forthcoming cam-

Despite the fact that mem-

On Radio Free Europe 
In connection with the uncertain fate of 
Radio Free Europe I would like to empha-
size that its liquidation would be interpreted 
by the peoples of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, 
?Hungary, Poland and Rumania as the final 
recognition by the United States of the pres-
ent status quo and of the permanency of 
the Soviet rule in East Europe. Surely, it 
would not kill their striving for independ-
ence but, paradoxically, might result in 
shifting their hopes toward the People's Re-
public of China, which alone of the great 
powers shows some interest in East Euro-
pean countries regaining their independ-
ence. This interest was demonstrated by sev-
eral announcements of the Peking govern-
ment and, not so long ago, by the vehement 
condemnation of the Soviet invasion of 
Czechoslovakia by the present Chinese dele 
gation to the United Nations. It is also being 
demonstrated by Radio Peking broadcasts tc 
East Europe and by Radio Tirana broadcast! 
to Poland.

The formation of a national bi-

INTERIM federal financing

operation ..expired Feb. 22 and 
House and Senate conferees are 
deadlocked on a bill authorizing 
funds for the stations. The units 
have enough money on hand to 
continue operating for about two 
Mote weeks. 
Fulbright, fl-Ark., 6airman 
of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, told the Senate Feb. 
17 that the stations "should be 
given an opportunity to take 
their rightful place in the 
graveyard of Cold War relics." 
The senator putinto the Con-

Library of Congress studies

tion that the stations should be

perhaps our European allies wilil

The House bill, passed Nov.1 
19, provides $36 million for thei 
current fiscal year, ending June!

For 20 years, the stations have

I would like to express, as strongly 
as possible, my support for Sen. Ful-
bright's efforts to eliminate federal 
funds for Radio Free Europe- and 
Radio Liberty, two government' out-
lets for cold war propaganda: 
? Radio Free Europe was long a se-
cret ? CIA-financed operation?con-
ducted by anti-Communist emigres 
--;-aimed at creating unrest in East-
ern Europe. Radio Liberty was a si-
milarly financed activity aimed at 
the Soviet Union. These two rem-
nants of the cold? war have never 
had significant impact other than to 
Interfere with improved relations 
between the United. States and the 
Soviet Union, except, perhaps, that 
Radio Free Europe played a minor 
role" in the. disastrous Budapest 
uprising of 1956. That either of these 
two radio propaganda activities 
has ever been important?let alone 
now?is a fantasy fostered primarily 
by our propaganda bureaucracy for 
Its own ends: 
. .Radio Free Europe?aimed at 
Eastern Europe?doubtless fosters 
false hopes among small anti-Com, 
munist groups and intrigues a limit-
ed number out of curiosity and in-
terest in American rock. music. Ra-
dio Liberty's target is ?the Soviet 
Union, ,where its audience is even

Fulbright, Citing China.,-Deplores Any Aid 
By BERNARD GWERTZIVIAN 
Speclat to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, Mara 6?
Senator J. W. Fulbright said 
today that the Nixon Adminis-
tration's pledge not to inter: 
fere in China's internal affairsp 
made continued support of Ra-
dio Free Europe and Radio Lib-
erty incomprehensible. 
The two-decade-old stations, 
privately run by Americans 
with United States Got,,rnment 
issistance, view their pur-
pose as the liberalization of 
the Soviet Union and members 
Df its bloc. 
,The comment by the Arkan-
rai-Democrat, who is chairmanl 
of the Senate Foreign Relations i 
Committee, was included in a' 
statement affirming his view' 
that the stations should be liq-
uidated. He has asserted that 
he believes they hurt the 
chances of improving relations 
with Moscow and should be 
discarded as "cold war .relics." 
Government funds for the 
stations ran out on Fb. 22, 
unless Senate and House con-
ferees overcome the difference 
between their bills, the stations 
will close in about two weeks. 
Until last year they had been. 
assisted secretly by the Central 
Intelligence Agency. 
The impasse has been caused 
by the refusal by Mr. Fulbright, 
as the chief Senate conferee, 
to approve financing beyond 
June 30, as provided in the 
Senate bill. The Administration-
backed House bill would pro-
vide funds until June 30, 1073. 
To put pressure on Mr. Ful-
bright to change his stancin 57 
senators introduced a joint re-
solution last week expressing 
their support for the two 
stations. But the resolution, 
which must be approved by the 
Foreign Relations Committee, is 
not expected to be brought to 
to Radio Free Europe l STATINTL 
a floor vote soon. Only six of 
the committee's 16 members 
joined in the resolution, which 
was broadly interpreted on 
Capitol Hill as a rebuke to Mr. 
Fulbright. 
Today George W. Ball, a for-
mer Under Secretary of State, 
held a news conference here to 
announce the formation of a 
bi-partisan citizen's' committee 
in favor of the house bill. Mr. 
Ball said that he believed de-
tente in Europe could be fos-
tered by continuation on the 
stations, which he said keep 
Eastern Europeans informed. 
The House bill would set up 
:a special committee to admi-' 
!ister the stations independent 
of the Government. The Senate 
;version would fund them di-
rectly through the State De-
partment. The Administration 
has opposed State Department 
control, arguing that the sta-
tions, which beam news and 
views about internal develop-
mentsin the Communist bloc, 
should be independent. 
Senator Fulbright, quoting 
from the communique issued in 
Shanghai, noted that the United 
States supported the principle 
of nonintervention in other 
countries.

information. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
As a point of departure, we must recog-
nize that the Soviet hostility toward public 
opinion research, the campaign conducted 
against Radio Liberty, and the retaliation of 
the Soviet authorities against Soviet citizens 
are real. The political proscription and perse-
cution the citizens may be exposed to are 
too severe to be ignored. The citizenry, living 
in the heavily controlled social environment, 
Is fully aware of the possible consequences 
and carefully avoids unnecessary risks. Nor 
could Radio Liberty survive if it did not pro-
ceed with caution and responsibility. 
Just what the proper level of caution 
should be in the present period is not easy to 
tell. The number of Soviet travelers has in-
creased, cultural contacts are generally on 
the ylse, and Soviet citizens may move some-
what more freely or at least more frequently 
abroad. 
Simi)ar but probably more articulate de-
velopments were recognized and used by RFE 
for the institution of public opinion research 
activities founded on scientific principles. 
Parenthetically mentioned, this work requires 
a' careful reconciliation of ideal criteria and 
diverse, situational constraints. Nonetheless, 
as a result of its audience research, Radio 
Free Europe is now in the position to docu-
ment the size of its audiences and the di-
mensions of its impact. 
The value of this knowledge is consider-
able and it bears both methodologically as 
well as substantively on the larger issue Sen-
ator Fulbright has clearly articulated in re-
cent hearings on the role of social sciences 
in U.S. foreign policy and international rela-
tions. Ih our atomic age a better understand-
ing of the Communist powers, their percep-
tion of the world, arel the psychological fac-
tors Influencing their decisions represents a 
matter of human survival, Senator Ful-
bright expressed surprise at how little re-
search is presently being conducted on this 
issue.' 
Both RFE's and RIA research is closely re-
lated to this issue. RFE has set the example 
that empirical research in this domain is not 
a hopeless enterprise. Even though Radio Lib-
erty. operates under more restrained condi-
tions, Radio Free Europe's success suggests 
that it would be worthwhile to explore the 
applicability of new approaches under the 
present, partially changed situation. Just as 
it would be wrong to overestimate the 
changes in their dimensions and conse-
quences, it would also be wrong to miss the 
opportunities these changes may offer for re-
search. There are three main developments 
which suggest taking a fresh look at this 
problem. 
a. There are some indications of freer criti-
cism in the U.S.S.R. and a lessening of fears 
and inhibitions of the Soviet citizen to meet 
foreigners and to talk more openly. 
b. Recent years have shown an increase in 
the number of Soviet tourists, especially 
travelers on scientific and business missions 
to the West. 
o. Radio Liberty has shifted its institu-
tional status from a situation of confiden-
tial, undisclosed sponsorship to an open in-
Hearings before the Committee on For-
eign Relations, U.S. Senate, psychological As-
pects of Foreign Policy, U.S. Government 
Printing Office, June 1969. 
stitution with responsibilities and informa-
tion policies exposed to public control. 
This partially changed situation may not 
warrant a public opinion research matching 
Western polls in size and style but may pro-
vide for a gradual introduction of scientific 
methods on a modest scale and carefully ad-
justed in approach. 
The groups interviewed presently from 
year to year are large enough (N=500) to 
warrant statistical treatment. By a certain 
standardization of the interview procedure, 
the comparability of the individual inter-
views may he substantially increased. By fo-
cusing the interview on predetermined cate-
gories of information, opinion profiles may 
be derived and trends analyzed. 
It appears to be advisable to retain the 
present distinction between program evalua-
tion by panel and audience research by in-
terviews. Because it is especially important 
for the panel members to be articulate and 
up-to-date, the use of recent emmigrants 
may be useful. For audience research in order 
to increase the representativeness of the in-
terviewed samples, RFE's policy of using 
travelers exclusively may be adopted. 
Similarly, it may be recommended that 
Radio Liberty explore the possibility of 
adopting the RFE approach of contracting 
out the interviewing to independent national 
public opinion and market research orgae 
nizations. The language is a problem here but 
these national firms may hire Russians as in-
terviewers just as RFE's contractors hire 
Eastern Europeans. The uSe of these inde-
pendent business organizations offers an ef-
fective method of demonstrating that the 
surveys involve public opinion research with 
no relationship to intelligence and espionage 
work. 
In order to reduce the problem resulting 
from a lack of experience with social science 
and survey methods, it is desirable to explore 
alternative methods in the administration 
and form of the interview to adapt it to the 
Soviet samples. 
Here preference may be given to projec-
tive techniques which show people's percep-
tions and attitudes without forcing them to 
make statements on topics which may be 
judged sensitive or political by Soviet stand-
ards. Similarly, tasks of obviously mechanical 
nature (checkmarking, rank ordering of 
given alternative choices) may be used ef-
fectively to underscore the statistical, imper-
sonal nature of the interest in contrast to 
the more personal nature of interest sug-
gested by direct questions. 
While some of these ideas may fail, others 
may work better than expected in the present, 
situation which does suggest certain ele-
ments of change. After all, some of the pre-
sentday RFT research would have appeared 
unthinkable five or ten years ago. 
Finally, because the Soviet public opin-
ion data bear on a critical information gap 
which has important political as well as sci-
entific relevance, and because this informa-
tion is essential to provide for an educated 
U.S. public opinion instead of being kept 
confidential, it should be given the necessary 
publicity. 
JOSEPH G. WHALEN 
Joseph G. Whalen, presently a twenty-year 
employee of the Library of Congress, was 
born in Olean, New York, on January 1, 1921. 
He entered the U.S. Navy immediately after 
Pearl Harbor and served in the Pacific Thea-
ter, participating in the capture of Iwo Jima 
and the occupation of Japan. He graduated 
from Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, 
In 1918, with honors in history, and won the 
Ph.D. degree in history from the University 
of Rochester in 1959. For Ave months in 1916 
he was employed by the State Department 
on the staff of the Far Eastern Commission. 
From 1918 to 1951 he was a graduate student 
and an instructor in history at the Univer-
sity of Rochester. In 1951, he was briefly em-
ployed by the Central Intelligence Agency 
prior to accepting a position on the staff of 
the Foreign Affairs Division of the Legisla-
tive Reference Service (now the Congres-
sional Research Service) of, the Library of 
Congress. 
Dr. Whalen is a member of the American 
Historical Association, the American Asso-

quirements for broadcasting through the ap-
propirate telecommunications authority in 
the host country for notification to the ITU. 
What is important about this arrangement 
is that the frequencies are registered with 
the ITU in the name of the country filing the 
notification, that is, the host country. This 
action neither confers nor implies any vested 
rights to the individual franchised user of 
that frequency but only priority rights 
granted by the country of notification, that 
is, the host country. 33 Dependency of AL on 
the host country for its license to transmit 
is, therefore, great, and as RL's network chief 
George Herrick said in commenting on the 
precarious nature of licensing and frequency 
allocation, "the loss of frequency and license 
is an irreversible loss; it can't be negotiated 
as an economic matter; the right to operate 
and the right to frequencies can't be. 
bought." The matter of licensing became a 
serious question for RL in the spring of 
.1971 when its license to transmit in Germany 
same up for renewal. The Soviet bloc exerted 
great pressure on the West German Govern-
ment not to renew the license, but the West 
Germans resisted, and RL was given a new 
lease on life in Munich and Lannas 
B. Research facilities 
1. Overview of Resources 
RL's broadcasting operations are support-
ed by a research effort that is impressive both 
in quality and in quantity. To keep abreast 
of internal developments in the Soviet Un-
ion and .to know what gaps to fill in their 
' programming, RI., researchers, programmers 
and other staff read and process more than 
250 Soviet newspapers and journals in addi-
tion to an equal number from the West. The 
. annotated bibliographic notes prepared on 
the basis of this press screening have fur-
nished vast and unique archives containing 
more than one million separate items of in-
formation. 
In addition to this. RL monitors listen to, 
tape, and partially or fully reproduce the 
texts of from 80 to 120 hours of Soviet 
broadcasting a day, including the gist of the 
columns which Soviet citizens are reading in 
their daily newspapers.'a 
Moreover, RL libraries in New York and 
Munich provide extensive coverage of recent 
periods of Soviet history and up-to-date in-
formation on current Soviet affairs. The 
library collection in New York consists of 
14,000 books, subscriptions to 200 Western 
-and 220 Soviet periodicals and dailies, 2,500 
Microfilms, and extensive files of archival 
Material as well as a record and tape library. 
In Munich, researchers and programmers 
have available a library collection of 65,000 
books, subscriptions to 291 Soviet periodicals, 
including 59 newspapers and 232 magazines 
and scholarly journals. The library also con-
tains documents, reports, pamphlets and 
microfilms. Published materials are supple-
mented by a large achive of in-house mimeo-
-graphed research materials dating back to 
? 1951.35 
? Presently, RL has under consideration the 
- problem of maintaining a vast samizdat col-
lection which increases with each passing 
week. Scholars regard RL as the largest 
archive for this valuable raw research mate-
ria1.33 In collecting semizdat, and in repro-
clueing an extra copy for broadcasters, RL 
has found itself performing a major service 
to a small circle of Western specialists; but 
now It is faced with the problem of whether 
a similar service should be performed for a 
larger outside circlea, Recently a decision 
Was reached on releasing sainizdat, and the 
mechanism for making it available to the 
Scholarly world is now being explored. Ne-
gotiations are underway to have duplicate 
copies of the material deposited in the Li-
? brary of Congress so that scholars will have 
ready access to this rich bank of research 
material, 
2. Research Resources at RL's Munich 
Headquarters 
Both New York and Munich maintain sep-
arate research facilities to support their own 
individual programming operations. The 
main research effort is, however, in Munich. 
There, the division of labor and allocation 
of research resources seem to be structured 
generally to suit the particular needs of the 
organization as it has taken shape over the 
years. Dispersion, therefore, characterizes the 
informational side of RL's operations. 
Formally, the primary research base within 
RL is the Research Department. Efforts have 
been made to integrate policy and research 
so that policy can have the assurance and 
support of solid underpinnings of data and 
analysis. Thus, the Research Department 
falls administratively within the responsi-
bility of the Director of the Program Policy 
Division. The Research Department also acts 
as an i formatioaal conduit for programmers 
through which up-to-date information is 
channeled. In brief, the Research Depart-
ment seeks to establish an inter-relationship 
- with both policy arid programming. 
In large measure it one of the principal 
support units of 11,L's broadcasting opera-
tions. Research staff maintain individual 
sources of information. A remarkable bank 
? of data, on the Soviet Union called "the Red 
Archives" is at their disposal. Since the Re-
search Department has become the primary 
depository in RL for the processing of samiz-
dat and feeding it into programming, re-
searchers have this wealth of new material 
to enrich their research product. 
The library acts as a broad base archival 
support for RL's operations. In addition to 
the general services that a library renders to 
a research organization, libtary staff provides 
RL researchers and programmers with bibli-
ographic information on such matter as new 
acquisitions and on projected subjects for 
broadcasting set forth in the Monthly Guid-
ance. Library staff also maintain a close 
"inter-library loan" relationship with the 
Bavarian State Library in Munich where they 
can draw on its highly commended "East 
European Collection." 
Programmers also have their own inde-
pendent sources of information, in addition 
to what is available in the Research bepart-
ment. This is especially the case with the 
Nationalities Service. Owing to their special-
ized interest in the non-Russian Soviet na-
tionalities and to the heavy emphasis on 
strictly Russian materials in RL's research 
resources, staff of the Nationalities Service 
have had to develop their own sources of in-
formation. In fact, the programmers in both 
the Russian and Nationalities Services, spe-
cialists themselves in their own fields, have 
acquired a finger-tip sensitivity to develop-
ing events and thus often rely Upon their 
own resources rather than the lengthy, 
scholarly-oriented studies from the Research 
Department, sometimes too indigestible to 
suit their immediate needs. The program-
ming effort is essentially a journalistic oper-
ation; it is "history in a hurry", as one senior 
staffman said; it is an "integrating process" 
of past knowledge with unfolding contempo-
rary history in which speed is vital. Hence, 
the need for this special source of informa-
tion within immediate reach and in a read-
ily uneasable form. 
Other sources of data are available in the 
Information Center and Music Library 
which are administratively under the .Pro--
gram Operations Division. The Information 
Center maintains ready-reference material 
such as reviews and periodical literature, 
along with a 10-day deposit of RFT daily 
news budgets. The Music Library maintains 
an extensive record and tape collection. 
Tus. RL has substantial resources of in-
formation and research data. available for 
staff; but it is widely dispersed throughout 
the organization. This development seems to 
, 
have been dictated by the special require-
menti of the various departments in research 
and programmiag. As a result, the library 
seems to have takemon the form of an archi-
val center rather than that a of a nerve cen-
ter for a research organization, at least in 
? the American sense. Whether or not disper-
sal or centralization of research?resources in-
to a central library is the most effective and 
efficient mechanism of organizing RL's infor-
mational data may well be a question for - 
future consideration. 
3. The Institute for the Study of the USSR 
The Institute for the Study of the USSR 
was, until recently, another support serv-
ice available for RL staff in research and 
programming. The Institute was an entirely 
separate operation from RL's broadcasting. 
functions, and administratively it was re-
sponsible directly to the President of the 
RL Committee. However, the Institute was 
located in Munich. and its research resources 
were available to RL. 
The Institute's library of 75,000 volumes 
constituted one of the richest specialized 
collections on the Soviet Union in Europe. 
It concentrated on the acquisition of Soviet 
materials, particularly current periedical.s 
and newsnaners. It also contained a large 
number of books and periodicals not now 
available. Such basic research materials as 
the comnlete sets of Pravda and Lzvestia 
since 1917 were available on microfilm. In 
addition, the Institute in.aintained an ex-
tensive biographic file of more than 130,000 
leading Soviet personalities. One of .its many 
publications was the standard reference ' 
work, "Who's Who In the USSR." 3. 
The main effort of the Institute was in 
the realm of publications, notably of peri-
odical literature which focused mainly on 
Soviet interest in the underdeveloped areas 
of the world. However, the Institute also 
published books based on conferences and 
symposia in which leading Soviet specialists 
in the West participated. A recent book in 
this series is, "The Military-Technical Rev-
olution", published by Praeger, edited by 
John Erickson, and containing chapters on 
Soviet defense matters by leading specialists 
In the West. In addition, the Institute spon-
sored a 6-week Soviet Area and Russian 
Language Summer School conducted by .the 
University of Oklithema.40 
Thus, the Institute served varicais pur-
poses for RL staff: it provided library ma-
terials that supplemented collections in their 
own library, it brought together specialists 
on Soviet affairs in conferences and sym-
posia, thus enabling It,L staff through con.; 
sultations and informal associations to gain 
other perspectives on the Soviet reality; and 
finally it published data that was available 
for immediate staff use in research. 
4. Availability of RL's Research Resources 
and Output to Scholars 
RL's research facilities are open to scholars 
and researchers. Moreover, RL makes many 
of its research products available to a wide 
range of specialists on Soviet affairs. Thus, 
RL is able to serve two functions: it is able 
to maintain its important connection with 
specialists in the scholarly community in 
the West to whom it Often turns for advice 
and counsel on programming and policy 
It is also able to infuse up-to-data informa-
tion and important emerging ideas into the 
mainstream of Western thought on devel-
opments in the Soviet Union. 
A major effort is made by RL to keep So-
viet specialists informed on current hap-
penings in the USSR. It does this by dis-
tributing free-of-charge its publications to 
650 specialists in North America who have 
regularly asked to receive the material. 
EL publications include RL Dispatches on 
current affairs analysis, issued several times a 
week; RL Research Papers, providing more 
extensive, background information; and RL

translations of significant articles from the 
Soviet press. (For examples of RL's publica-
tions, see Appendix 22.) The latter two pub-
lications are issued on an ad hoc basis." 
RL research facilities have, therefore, not 
only provided support for RI, programmers 
and broadcasters, but, as a spin-off of its pri-
mary activity, namely, broadcasting, it has 
also provided an important service to spe-
cialists in academia, the government, and the 
mass media who are concerned with con-
tempary Soviet affairs. 
A measure of the value of ILL's research 
materials to Western scholarship can be seen 
in the appraisal by Prof. Leonard Schapiro 
of the London School of Economics. Prof. 
Schapiro wrote that he has followed the work 
of RL "very closely" for over 15 years and 
that "the products of the research in which 
it engages, and on which it broadcasts are 
founded, have been closely studied by me 
and by my colleagues in my department for 
many years." "I have no hesitation in stat-
ing," Prof. Schapiro went on, "that the qual-
ity of' this research has been consistently 
high and that it has proved of inestimable 
value to those who, like ourselves, are con-
cerned with the study of the Soviet Union." " 
The tone of this endorsement of RL's re-
search products along with others reproduced 
in Senate Foreign Relations Committee hear-
ings and in RL's statement to Congress have 
the flavor of excessive testimonials; but this 
judgment must be balanced by an awareness 
that the writers are eminent scholars in the 
field of Soviet studies, and speak with some 
authority. 
5. Importance of Research in RL's Operations 
The quality of research done by RL, 
whether it be in the Research Department or 
among programmers, and the availability of 
input source material, whether it be in the 
form of books, periodical literature, the press, 
radio monitoring or even word of mouth, is 
vital to RL's broadcasting operations. For 
the quality of information derived from re-
search sources, along with the daily input of 
news (which is essentially part of the re-
search process), deterniines in large measure 
the degree to which RL is achieving its stated 
goals and purposes as a surrogate "Horne 
Service" for the Soviet people. By the nature 
of things RL must operate from the premise 
? that its audience suffers from large informa-
tional gaps which it seeks to fill. 
RL tries to give the Soviet audience a rea-
sonably complete picture of reality as any 
Soviet citizen would perceive it had he access 
to free information as in the West. And this 
can be done only by research, analysis, and 
a highly rational selection of news?in brief, 
only by hard intellectual effort. 
VI. mamma: SOURCE OF CONTROVERSY 
? In recent years RL's annual budget has 
ranged between $12 to $14 million. According 
to Senator Clifford P. Case (R-N.J.), the op-
erating cost of RL for FY 1969 was $12,887,-
401.a According to a GAO estimate, RL's 
budget for 1971 was about $13,700,000at 
Formally, these funds were apparently sup-
posed to have been provided by private 
sources in RFE/11L's capacity, in the State 
Department's words, as "private broadcas-
ters." a However, according to the SFRC re-
port, the "gap between private contributions 
and actual budget expenditures ... has been 
filled by funds from the Central Intelligence 
Agency. ..." a According to the State Depart-
ment, I'M has no program for corp-orate fund-
ing, such as that for RFE." (During the de-
cade 1962-1971, ISL received about $20,000 in 
unsolioited funds.) The SFRC report stated 
that the ". . . Executive Branch officials re-
fuse publicly to acknowledge the [Central 
Intelligence] Agency's participation or role 
in maintaining and operating the two 
Radios." 
Accordingly, "the Department declined to 
supply additional financial, data for this re-
port on Government funding of RFT and 
RI,."

8 In a critical appraisal of RL, Erik Barnouw 
observed in his history of American broad-
casting that RL had begun broadcasting two 
months after the inauguration of President 
Eisenhower, and he went on to say: "Al-
though plans for it had been made earlier, 
Radio Liberation became the epitome of the 
foreign policy of the following years, a pol-
icy dominated by John Foster Dulles of the 
Department of State and Allen W. Dulles of 
the Central Intelligence Agency?two re-
markable and complex men, differing yet 
working in harmony. They made a fateful 
impress not only on American diplomacy but 
also on its broadcasting?at home and 
abroad." (The Image Empire: a History of

York, Oxford University Press, 1970, v. III, 
p. 92)

13- Dr. Pet?rov made these observations on 
RL's conduct during this critical time: "This 
lack of clarity in political matters RL's 
policy] is an obvious shortooming. It was 
clearly demonstrated during the Hungarian 
crisis in November 1956, when RL didn't 
know what to say. Actually, some foolish 
things were said. For example, appeals were 
made to the Soviet soldiers not to shoot the 
Hungarians because they also were building 
socialism; regrets were expressed because 
'our' brave soldiers murdered Hungarian 
women and children; appeals were made to 
the members of the Communist Party and to 
the 'politrabotnikr of the Army to stop the 
mass slaughter of the population." (Petrov, 
op. cit., pp. 112-113) 
" Writing in 1958, Dr. Petrov commented: 
"Since most of the policies of RL consist of 
'don'ts' and since the writers and editors are 
reduced to platitudes, RL suffers from a dis-
tinct lack of character." (Petrov, op. cit., pp. 
110-111). However, in a commentary on the 
effects of the Hungarian crisis on RFE/Rls 
David Binder of The New York Times recent-
ly observed; "The crushing of the Hungarian 
uprising in 1956 by Soviet armor also led to 
the crushing of cold-war agitation by Radio 
Free Europe and, in less dramatic form, at 
the Munich station aimed at the Soviet Union 
and then called Radio Liberation. At Radio 
Free Europe .commentators and policy ad-
visers were dismissed or shifted to innocuous 
jobs. Radio Liberation changed its name to 
Radio Liberty and gradually toned down its 
more aggressive commentators." (Binder,

10)

the 1965 Policy Manual: 
"1. to encourage practical, democratic po-
litical alternatives to Soviet practices; 
"2. to encourage more rapid social and eco-
nomice reforms and allocation of more eco-
nomic resources for the benefit of Soviet 
consumers; 
"3. to reassure listeners that democratic 
powers want peace and eschew aggression, 
but will defend themselevs against aggres-
sion; 
"4. to encourage the view that the Soviet 
Government should abandon world revolu-
tionary aims and work more actively for 
peace and international cooperation; 
"5. to undermine Communist ideology, 
showing that it does not promote the wel-
fare of the peoples of the USSR, and to show 
that history points toward progress in free-
dom of all peoples; ?

freedom of exchange of ideas and travel."

CHAPTER II: RL's GOALS, POLICIES, AND POLICY 
FORMULATION 
I. na's OBJECTIVES 
A. Ultimate goal: Democratization of Soviet 
Society 
The primary objective of RL is very simply 
to encourage those forces of liberalization 
Within Soviet society sthat will bring about 
an eventual peaceful evolution of the USSR 
from its present form of Communist totali-
tarianism to a more tolerable and humane 
form of democracy. The ultimate goal is 
democratization of Soviet society in the ex-
pectation that within such liberalization lies 
the greatest hope for world peace. 
Perhaps, this general objective was most 
succinctly and yet comprehensively set forth 
in RL's formal statement to Congress. It 
said: "Radio Liberty is a communications 
channel for Soviet citizens concdrned about 
their country's future, and its place in the 
world community. It is dedicated to human 
rights, to peaceful evolution of Soviet society 
and to harmony in international relations." I 
As an ultimate goal in broadcasting, RL 
directs its energies towards achieving the 
democratization of Soviet society. The Policy 
Manual of 1971 defined RL's ultimate goal 
in these terms: "to see all the peoples of 
the USSR acquire the opportunity to live in 
freedom with truly democratic political in-
stitutions, based on free election processes 
and guaranteed observance of human rights, 
and which represent the best interests of all 
citizens and assure for their country a nor-
mal, cooperative and constructive role with-
in the comity of modern states,"' 
B. Commitment to peaceful change 
RL's is, however, a commitment to peaceful 
change from within. It seeks to encourage 
liberal and progressive elements within So-
viet society, seeing in these forces the greatest 
possibility for a Soviet Russia regenerated by 
the liberating spirit of genuine democracy. 
It rejects confrontation as an instrumental-
ity in achieving its goals and fosters an ap-
proach to policy formulation and policy ex-
ecution that is essentially benign in spirit, 
positive in direction, and pacifistic in its 
rejection of solutions by force. 
Thus, RL Is not now a Cold War opera-
tion in the sense that this term was used and 
understood in the 1950s and which well de-
scribed its functions at that time. On the 
contrary, RL accepts Soviet institutions, 
though not its ideology, and seeks to bring 
about peaceful transformation within the 
system as it now exists. 
C. RL's purposes 
In seeking its ultimate goal of democrati-
zation, RL has a rather precise perception of 
how this should be done. It encourages the 
Soviet peoples to work together as a first 
step in instilling the habit of democracy. The 
expectation is that by mutual cooperation 
the Soviet peoples themselves can establish 
a democratic system that will not only be 
representative of and responsible to the will 
and aspirations of all, but also will be cap-
able of sustaining their national interests 
and maintaining a viable economic struc-
ture.3 
In assisting the Soviet people to achieve 
this goal, RL broadcasts to its listeners 
truthful information which will enable them 
to make up their own minds, form their own 
judgments, and reach their own independent 
conclusions on developments within their 
country. RL seeks, therefore, to relieve the 
Soviet people from their total dependency 
upon -the regime as a source of information. 
Having monopolistic control over informa-
tion and publicly expressed opinion, the rul-
ing elite deprives Soviet citizans of access 
to information that would give them a more 
complete and truthful picture of reality. RL 
seeks to fill in these blank spaces of cal-
culated omissions and correct distortions of 
official Soviet propaganda. Finally, RL urges 
the Soviet people to develop a sense of com-
mon cause and recognize that their concerns 
and vital interests are shared concerns and 
interests of many other Soviet citizens:, 
In speaking for the genuineneeds and best 
aspirations of its listeners, both Russian and 
non-Russian, RL emphasizes the importance 
of both historical continuity and the rele-
vance of contemporary problems. For all So-
viet peoples it assumes the obligation of 
S 3391 
linking their past to the present and future 
in an effort to maintain the vigor of their 
historical and cultural legacies in the face 
of regime attempts to exploit them for prop-
aganda purposes. Attuned to the require-
ments of history, EL thus relates the past 
to the present and future while concentrat-
ingo . 
n contemporary problems in Soviet so-
ciety.' D. RL's Immediate Objectives 
Within this larger framework of goals and 
purposes, EL pursues immediate objectives 
that focus on such practical and positive 
themes as democratic political alternatives, 
economic reform, peacef UI intentions of the 
democratic world, ideological irrelevance of 
Marxism-Leninism, and the virtue of -cul-
tural diversity and political pluralism. 
As a primary immediate objective, EL tries 
to convince Soviet listeners that practical, 
democratic political alternatives to their 
present system do exist. It encourages them 
to work toward these alternatives in their 
own interest by asking questions, by seeking 
more information, by finding practical solu-
tions to specific problems, and by uniting in 
common efforts to create internal pressures 
for change.' In brief. 111, seeks to destroy the 
prevailing, officially-induced myth of a politi-
cal system preordained by history and sug-
gest pragmatic means for transformation. 
RL also encourages among its listeners the 
belief that more rapid and equitable solu-
tions are possible to their domestic economic 
and social problems, and to the problems of 
the nationalitie?. RL persuades them to press 
for basic economic reform and allocation of 
more economic resources for the benefit of 
the consumer. It also persuades the Soviet 
listener to press for the cultural needs of the 
various nationalities, including the Rus-
sian? 
In the realm of international relations, RL 
assures its listeners that the democratic 
powers of the world are pursuing foreign 
policies that are designed to achieve world . 
peace and stability. It tries to convince the 
listener that, notwithstanding the constant 
claims of Soviet propaganda, none of these 
states has any intention of committing 
armed aggression against the USSR. Defense 
establishments are maintained, RL points 
out, in order to resist aggression by other 
world powers.' 
Moreover, RL tries to convince its listeners 
that by abandoning world revolutionary 
aspirations, moderating its aggressive foreign 
policies, and instituting a policy of more 
active international cooperation within the 
United Nations, the Soviet Government 
would do much to lessen the danger of 
thermonuclear war and to assure world 
peace? Or said another way, adherence to 
the ideological principle of "struggle" and 
the advocacy of the conquest of 'power that 
flows from this belief, enhance the possibility 
of thermonuclear war, and only through So-
viet moderation and cooperation in the 
United Nations will peace be assured. 
In ideological matters, RL' challenges the 
faith of Communist believers?both sincere 
and opportunistic?in their obsolescent 
ideology which as Marxism-Leninism con-
tains the seeds of Soviet dictatorship. It 
tries to convince believers that Marxist 
philosophy as it has taken shape in the USSR 
has been perverted and in the course of time 
reduced to a collection of primitive dogmas. 
RL tries to show believers that the "revolu-
tionary struggle" in the world today, so 
seminal to the concepts of Marxism-Lenin-
ism, does not coincide with their views or 
their interests. These would be better served, 
RL stresses, by the peaceful pluralistic devel-
opment of societies under the rule of law, 
and in freedom for all peoples everywhere, 
including the peoples of the USSR?, In brief, 
RL challenges the faith of Marxist-Leninists 
as being outdated, irrelevant and contrary 
to the real interests of the Soviet people; it

is. even worse, barely over 3 percent. And 
when one looks at the states with heavy 
concentrations of Spanish-speaking, one 
finds only 4 of 88 appeal board members in 
California who are Spanish-speaking. In 
Colorado, none. In Arizona, none. In Florida, 
none. Yet these are the boards that the sys-
? tern provides to halt the egregious errors that 
many local boards commit. How can that 
cleansing function be fulfilled when none of 
the appeals boards can easily understand, 
let alone relate to a Spanish-speaking 
registrant? 
' Equal treatment under the law, a basic 
condition for maintaining the bond of citi-
tenship, lies been repeatedly and flagrantly 
denied to the Spanish-speaking, and it is 
time to change. 
These statistics demonstrate the need for 
the seminar that is taking place today. More 
than that, they demonstrate the absolute 
necessity for Spanish-speaking citizens to be 
active politically. For if .you permit the po-
litical leadership of this country to continue 
to treat zou as "Strangers in your own land," 
.then there will be a perenial list of unmet 
goals in education, housing, in employment, 
in .access to the protection of the law. 
The clfalienge not only lies with both 
partieo to respond and to respond effectively. 
It lies also with you to force the parties to 
respond. And despite the tremendous re-
sistance that undoubtedly exists, I believe 
that they can be made to respond. 
? But it means that you must take the 
initiative, that you must do the registering 
and organizing, that you must do the pre-
cinct work and the, polling. And it is not 
just the federal elections that count. Gov-
ernors choose boards of regions and state 
university directors. Sheriffs and district at-
torneys decide local law enforcement poli-
cies and city councilmen and mayors control 
the decisions that send funds to the mani-
cured streets of the affluent few or the still:. 
unpaved roads of the barrio. 
The challenge is before you. It does not rest 
with those unwilling to risk something of 
themselves. Nor does it rest with those who 
demand that the struggle be easily won. It 
rests only with those ready to trade the com-
fort and convenience of the critic for the tor-
ment and sacrifice of the committed. 
Yet you have among La Roza, many who 
already have shown the way. You have men 
such as Cesar Chavez, who has brought the 
farmworker of this nation his first hope for 
lasting dignity. The victory kr Florida is part 
Of a struggle that began not five or ten years 
ago, but two decades ago. when the first or-
ganizing began. 
And if that kind of commitment is made, 
then I believe there will be response. I believe 
there must be response. 
Robert Kennedy shared that view. He walk-
ed through the barrios of East Los Angeles 
and through the dusty fields of Delano. He 
was committed to change the conditions of 
poverty and discrimination he saw. 
For he believed as I do, that this nation can 
never be free until there is no longer a child 
who cries from hunger or a mother who fears 
illness because she cannot afford a doctor, or 
a man who dies because the law does not see 
him as a man. 
There is much to be done before we are 
free. ? 
RADIO FREE EUROPE AND

Chose who urge the dissolution of Radio 
Free Europe and Radio Liberty. These 
persons say?correctly?that these sta- ?

that dissolution of these stations would 
cause the Soviet Government to feel af-
fectionately about us. 
Even if such affection were likely, 
which, of course, it is not; and even if 
such affection were more precious than 
the satisfaction the stations bring to the 
oppressed people living under Soviet 
domination, which it is not, one would 
still want to note that not even Chan-
cellor Brandt, whose enthusiasm for 
accommodation with the Soviets is nearly 
boundless, refuses to accede to the Soviet 
demand that the stations be expelled 
from German soil. 
Mr. President, it is a tiresome but nec-
essary chore to reiterate these self-evi-
dent truths in the fact 'of palpable and 
unattractive delusions about the potential 
affability of the Soviet Union, and the 
sinfulness of any and all things that are 
obnoxious to Soviet despots.

IN DEFENCE OF RADIO FREE EUROPE 
Senator Fulbright believes that Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty, operating from 
Munich, should be stopped from broadcast-
ing to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Un-
ion because they are "Cold War relics" and 
hinder detente. He is wrong on both counts. 
The radios abandoned the unfortunate policy 
of "liberating the captive peoples" in 1956 
and now support Willy Beandt's Ostpolitik 
and all Communist reform movements in 
Eastern Europe. It is true that the Russians 
and their allies have consistently demanded 
that Brandt shouLci expel the radios from 
Munich. But his refusal to do so has not 
stopped the Russians and the Poles from 
signing treaties with him, and the Czecho-
slovak-West German Treaty is held no by 
a dispute over the Munich Agreement of -1338, 
not over the radios. In fact,. by their con-
stantly objective coverage of West German 
events, the radios have done more than any 
other organisation to dispel amongst ordinary 
East Europeans the official Communist myth 
of "West German revanchism." 
Fulbright argues, rather startlingly, that 
the radios are useless because "truth and 
freedom are indigenous and subjective is-
sues and cannot be transferred from one peo-
ple to another." That fashionable cynicism 
Is disproved by Soviet hatred of the radios; 
It is precisely the "transference of truth" 
that the Russians fear. The radios, whatever 
their imperfections, provide East Europeans 
with a far more reliable source of world and 
domestic news than their own, Government-
controlled media. It would be a tragic and 
distasteful appeasement for the West to cut 
off that source at Soviet behest. 
Fulbright's only useful suggestion is that 
Western Europe might play a part in financ-
ing the radios. They should close down only 
when, as in Dubcek's Prague Springs, East 
Europeans no longer need to listen to them; 
with the current KGB persecution of Soviet 
dissidents and Husak's campaign of intel-
lectual genocide in Czechoslovakia, that day 
is sadly still far away. 
? Mr. ALLOTT. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD an editorial published in to-
day's Wall Street Journal which asks 
"What's wrong with wanting to con-
tribute to the free flow of ideas across 
international borders?" 
There being no objection, the editorial

THREAT TO RADIO FREE EUROPE 
We have difficulty understanding why 
Senator Fulbright is trying to deny Con-
gressional appropriations 'to Saadi? Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty. We are aware 
of his animus toward "cold war relics," but 
both stations have earned virtually unani-
mous praise for broadcasting objective news 
and impartial analysis. 
There is obviously a crying need for such 
Information, which RFE broadcasts in na-
tive languages to five Eastern European na-
tions and which Radio Liberty broadcasts 
to the USSR, in 17 Soviet languages. In ef-
fect, the stations function as a free press 
for some 300-million fettered people. Con-
trast that with the Communist bloc's un-
relieved propagsinda broadcasts, 900 hours 
a day in some 80 languages to every con-
tinent. 
In the early and mid-50s, both stations 
were accused of adding to the tensions of 
the cold war. If so, that .charge has not 
been true for at least 15 years. Indeed, for-
mer ambassador to Poland John Gronouski 
praised the accuracy and detail of RFE's 
coverage of the Polish uprisings of 1968 (up-
risings that were ignored by the Polish me-
dia). And both stations gave factual re-
ports on such important issues as the ous-
ter of Khrushchev, the Cuban missile crisis, 
and the Nixon visit to China, stories that 
the Communist world ignored or down-
played. 
There was a minor flap last year when 
it was revealed -that the Central Intelli-
gence Agency had secretly been subsidizing 
both stations, even as Washington insisted 
that they were privately financed. There 
was no evidence that the CIA ? ever inter-
fered with program content, but such de-
ception is inexcusable nonetheless?which is 
why President Nixon proposed that the sta-
tions be financed directly by Congress but 
run by an 11-member nonprofit corporation 
independent of government control. 
Yet Mr. Fulbright objects even to thst. 
And although both houses of Congress have 
passed authorization bills, he has managed 
to delay any cpnference for resolving the 
differences and thus keeping the stations 
alive. It is this opposition that we find hard 
to fathom. Does he also object to the Voice 
of America? 
Although Senator Fulbright argues that 
the stations have no place in a period of 
East-West detente, we suspect that they 
have actually contributed to detente by 
helping to erode ideological suspicion born 
of ignorance and misinformation, and that 
abandoning them may prolong the East-

gIGHTY-POUR VACANT HOMES; 84 VACANT LOTS: 
ABUSE OP PROGRAM DOOMS NEIGIIBORHOOD 
(By Robert It. Teuscher and 
Harry E. Wilson, Jr.) 
-.Eighty-four vacant lots testify mutely here 
? to the abuses in a federal program designed 
? to rehabilitate neighborhoods and put poor 
families into their own homes. ? 
A-The lots are the tail-end of what has be-
come an all-too-common urban phenome-
non?blockbusting, real estate speculation, 
foreclosed mortgages, and the federal wreck-
ing ball. ? 
They represent one-third of all the fore-
? closures in the federal Section 221(d) (2) 
Mortgage insurance program. 
The houses that once stood on these lots 
were certified for 25 to 30-year mortgages 
only three and four years ago by appraisers 
from the St. Louis area office of the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development 
"(BUD). 
According to HUD regulations, houses 
ishonld not be approved for federally insured 
Mortgages unless the HUD aparaiser finds 
them sound enough to stand for at least 
three-fourths of the term of their mortgages. 
Yet an average_ of only 18 months after 
appraisal and sale with the federally insured 
Mortgages, these 84 houses were sold to HUD 
for their insured values in foreclosure pro-
ceedings. 
HUD then decided that the houses were 
either structurally unsound or too expensive 
to repair and demolished them. 
The Section 221(d) (2) program that once 
financed these houses, allows low-income 
families in the inner city to purchase homes 
by providing mortgage insurance similar to 
the FHA or GI home mortgages used by mil-
lions of American families. 
The program differs from standard mort-
gage plans by permitting down-payments as 
low as $200 and by requiring rehabilitation 
of the homes before sale. 
- The program's track record has not been 
good. 
The foreclosure rate here now stands at 
8.63%, the fourth highest in the nation, ac-
cording to HUD Secretary George Romney. 
(The foreclosure rate for standard mortgages 
is less than one-half of one percent.) 
Paying off the foreclosed 221(d) (2) mort-
gages in the City of St. Louis has cost the 
federal government mere than $2.7 million 
Repairing foreclosed homes for resale h . 
cost another $600,000, and demolition of the 
84 houses has cost $80,000. 
HUD has been able to recoup only $1.15 
million on the resale of repaired houses Or 
vacant lots. 
Real estate speculators and mortgage com-
panies, however, have turned tidy, and some-
times immense, profits, records show. 
In the meantime several stable neighbor-
hoods have been ruined. 
The Eads and St. Vincent avenue neigh-
borhood, in the shadow of Firmin Desloge 
Hospital on the Near South Side, is an ex-
ample of the blight that follows a combina-
tion of speculators and 221(d) (2) mortgage 
insurance. ' ? 
As late as 1967, this was a bule-collar, mid-
dle-class area, made up of single and two-
family brick homes that were nearing the 
end of their useful lives. 
Norman Keathley, who lived at 2926 Eads 
since 1943, described the area as a "poor, 
but respectable neighhorhood, with working 
class people." 
But in early 1968, conditions, particularly 
crime, took a turn for the worse, according 
to former neighbors. 
"They (vandals) tore the copper guttering 
right off my house in broad daylight," Fran-
cis Green, formerly of 2829 Eads said, "I 
figured it wasn't safe for the kids anymore." 
Asked about the sale of houses in the 
area, Green said, "I figured blockbusting was 
what was going on. I hope they catch them 
(the speculators) at it so it won't happen 
here (at his new house in South St. Louis)." 
At the same time that things turned bad 
on Bads and St. Vincent, a group of real 
estate companies moved in. 
Between September, 1968, and June, 1970, 
23 houses on Batts and St. Vincent were sold 
to real estate firms, who then resold the 
houses under the 221(d) (2) program. 
The houses were bought by the realty firms 
for an average of $5,000, with some going for 
as little at $1,000. 
When the real estate firms resold the 
houses several months later to 221(d) (2) 
families, the average going price was $10,000. 
Each of the houses had been appraised at 
an average of $10,000, the sale price, by HUD 
appraisers, and the appraisers had also cer-
tified that the houses were good for 20-30 
year mortgages. 
Today every one of those houses is a va-
cant lot. 
And there are 27 other vacant lots on 
Eads and St. Vincent, all of which were run ? 
through federal mortgage programs similar 
to the 221(d) (2) mortgage insurance. 
HUD officials are not sure how the houses 
which were old in the first place, ended up in 
such condition to require demolition. 
The reason could have been mismanage-
ment or abuse by the homeowner, or a faul-
ty HUD appraisal, in the first place, accord- ? 
ing to George 0. Hipps, director of HUD's 
Single Family and Land Development Divi-
sion in Washington, D.C. 
Who were the winners in this example 
of speculation and blight? 
The oroginal owners were forced to sell 
at rock bottom prices for fear of crime and 
speculation. 
The 221(d) (2) families lost all of their 
equity in homes they could not afford, and 
most of them are now ineligible for any other 
federal housing programs.

RADIO 1,1tEE EUROPE AND RADIO 
LIBERTY 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, the 
Library of Congress has completed its 
reports on Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty. The reports were delivered to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations on Fri-
day, March 3, at 5 p.m. 
In view of the controversy surrounding 
these reports and the allegations that I 
and members of the committee staff have 
tried to suppress this information or alter 
its presentation, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have the rePorts, plus my cor-
respondence with the Library, included 
in the REcoRD at the conclusion of my re-
marks. The appendices to the reports, 
numbering several hundred additional 
pages, are in the committee's files and 
are available to the public, as are the 
draft versions of the reports. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
(See exhibit 1.) 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, this 
work is the result of a .request which I 
sent to the Library - on June 8, 1971. 
Shortly thereafter, Mr. Charles Gellner, 
Chief, Foreign Affairs Division, and Mr. 
James Price, analyst in National De-
Jens% bah .of the Library of Congress, 
met with Mr. Robert Dockery of the com-
mittee staff for the purpose of discussing 
the Tequest. Following this meeting, Mr. 
Dockery was informed by the Library 
that two studies would be prepared, one 
on each of the Radios, that Mr. Price 
would be responsible for the Radio Free 
Europe study and that Dr. Joseph 
Whelan, Specialist in Soviet and East 
European Affairs of the Library, would 
be responsible for the Radio Liberty 
study. At approximately the same time, 
Mr. Dockery was informed that, at Mr. 
Price's suggestion, an independent con-
sultant, specialized in audience research 
analysis techniques, would be brought in 
to evaluate the Radios' audience-re-
sponse claims. 
At my request, the Library agreed to 
include in the final reports a r?m?n 
each of the research participants. 
The researchers completed their drafts 
during the first part of January and Mr. 
Gellner forwarded them to Mr. Dockery 
on January 14. In his transmittal memo, 
Mr. Gellner clearly identified the status 
of the reports by noting: 
We will be happy to have your comments 
before' we put the studies into final shape and 
formally transmit them. Our review of these 
drafts has not yet been completed and we 
too will wish to make some changes.

Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, 
the deadlock between the House and the 
Senate over legislative authorization for 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty 
still continues, and it is a matter of 
widening concern. An article by Flora 
Lewis in the Boston Evening Globe il-
lundinates the problem from an American 
viewpoint, and an editorial from the 
London Daily Telegraph expresses Brit-
ish concern for the fate of the two radios. 
The 'latter editorial correctly notes that 
the present impasse is in no way the 
_ fault of this body. 
Editorials also a vpeared today in the 
New 'York Times .id the Wall Street 
Journal. The text of all these editorials 
follows:

FULBRIGHT SILENCES Two. 'US. VOICES 
(By Flora Lewis) 
WASHINGTON.?Unless Congress acts by the 
end of the month, the semi-official American 
radio stations broadcasting to the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe will be shut down. 
? That is precisely the aim Of Sen. Fulbright 
ID-Ark.), chairman of the Senate Foreign 
?' Relations Committee, who has maneuvered 
to kill the stations by legislative impasse 
cutting off their funds. 
"These radios should be given an oppor-
tunity to take their rightful -place in the 
graveyard of cold war relics," Fulbright told 
the Senate. 
The two are Radio Free Europe, which own 
languages, and regularly publishes careful 
research on those countries in broadcasts 
from 12 to 20 hours a day to the nations of 
'Eastern Europe in their English. Radio Liber-
ty performs the same functions but focuses 
on the Soviet*Union. 
? Both, were 'started at the beginning of the 
'50s wads as Fulbright says belately, they 
were major weapons of the cold war. Futher, 
they were secretly funded by the CIA, al-
though Free Europe also received public con-
tributions. 
The irony of Fulbright's position is that 
both these faults have been corrected. The 
two radios now operate aboveboard. More im-
portant, they have come to provide a vital, 
straightforwardly informative service far 
superior to the 'U.S. Government's own for-
eign broadcasting system, the Voice of 
America. 
Last year, Sen. Clifford Case (R-N.J.) 
made Free Europe and Liberty honest ra-
dios with a bill ending their dependence on 
the CIA budget. They are now financed 
? through State Department appropriations 
? open to public scrutiny. That was not ideal, 
since it exposed- them to more political and 
propaganda controls than the previous 
secret, but essentially autonomous, arrange-
ment with the CIA. 
State wisely decided that it would be bet-
ter to set the radios up as quasi-independ-
ent systems, similar to the domestic Public 
Broadcasting System. In that way, the pro-
fessional judgment of their excellent and 
sober staffs would be better insulated from 
Improper influence. 
? A bill to this effect passed the House. But 
Fulbright got a bill through the Senate 
keeping State in charge until the end of the 
fiscal. year, when he hoped to cut off the. 
funds altogether. The two houses have failed 
to reach a conference agreement, so the 
radios are due to be silenced this week. 
It would be a grave loss, both to the peo-
ple of Eastern Europe and the scholars and 
researchers of the United States. The radios 
are no longer the strident propaganda trum-
pets of their early years. Since the Hungarian 
revolution of 1956, when they reviewed their 
role and drastically changed their policies, 
they have been serious and reliable sources 
of information and analysis which the people 
of Eastern Europe are totally denied by their 
governments. Of course, Moscow and its al-
lies don't like that. 
Silencing Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty would simply amount to ? collabo-
rating with those governments to silence dis-
sent and keep their peoples ignorant. 
The annual appropriation required for 
both is $36 million. Sen. Fulbright compared 
it to the $4.1 million which Voice of America's 
worldwide operation cost. But VOA broad-
casts only a few hours a day, and very dif-
ferent material?banal, official sometimes 
biased governmentese. 
If the point is economy, then it would be 
far better to drop VOA and let the two ef-
fective radios keep broadcasting. A special 
Library of Congress study, asked to evaluate 
Radio Free Europe and Radio ?Liberty by 
Fulbright's committee, came up with the 
answer that they were very good indeed, no 
doubt the opposite of what Fulbright hoped 
to hear. 
And If the point is to call off the cold 
war and deal more openly and sensibly with 
the Communist countries, then it would also 
be better to preserve the two autonomous 
radios and kill the US. government props-
gandaservice. 
If Fulbright's purpose is achieved, the re-
sult would not be to bury cold war relics 
but to help preserve the dark silence of the 
cold war in Eastern Europe.

FREEDOM'S VOICE IN PERIL 
A diggraceful surrender of the West's right 
to broadcast objective news and comment 
acrots the Iron Curtain is about to take place 
unless the American Government acts quick-
ly and firmly to stop it. Funds have been cut 
off from Radio Free Europe and Radio Lib-
erty, both based in Munich, which for over 
20 years have been transmitting to the satel-
lite countries, and also to Russia in the main 
languages of the Soviet Union. As was recent-
ly nearly the case with American foreign aid, 
the cut-off is a result of a dispute in Con-
gress. 
Senator FULBRIGHT is in. his usual role of 
leading the appeasers. A year ago he suc-
ceeded in stopping the provision of funds for 
the two stations by the Central Intelligence 
Agency. The State Department took over the 
responsibility on a year-to-year basis. The 
Senator now seems within an ace of block-
ing the voting of funds for the coming year, 
in. which case the stations would have to 
close down within a fortnight. He says that 
this would put them "ln_their rightful place 
in the churchyard of cold war relics." 
Is it "cold warfare" to broadcast the truth 
to the peoples of the Communist dictator-
ships? Is it wrong to give them samples of 
Western culture and entertainment, to seek 
to correct the dangerous, perverse and mali-
cious slanders about the allegedly aggressive 
war-like West with which they are fact by 
their governmental propaganda machines? 
Do the Communist regimes, in the barrage 
of vicious propaganda against the West with 
which they crowd the. channels- day and 
night, ask whether they are offending the 
susceptibilities of the societies it is their in-
tention to disintegrate? The West has the 
obligation, to itself and to subject peoples 
everywhere, to testify to democracy. Radio. 
as millions behind the. Iron Curtain will 
gratefully confirm, is the Ideal means of com-
munication in the circumstances. It must 
not be silenced.

A SENATE MAJORITY $PEAKS 
A majority of the members of the United 
States Senate has sponsored a resolution de-
signed to back continuation of Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty. 
What snakes the move extraordinary is that 
the primary immediate aim of the sponsors 
is to put pressure on the Senate's conferees 
to end their deadlock with House conferees 
on this issue, a stalemate that threatens the 
swift demise of both these major communi-
cations links to Eastern Europe. Now that a 
majority of the Senate has spoken, there can 
be no moral basis for the continued obduracy 
of that chamber's conferees, 
Their present tactics, if successful in ter-
minating these broadcasts, can only benefit 
the Kremlin. Its bitter enmity to these radio 
voices has long emphasized their importance

THREAT To RADIO FREE EUROPE 
We have difficulty understanding why Sen-
ator Fulbright is trying to deny Congressional 
appropriations to Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty. We are aware of his animila 
toward "cold war relics," but both stations 
have earned virtually unanimous praise for 
broadcasting objective news and impartial 
analysis. ? 
There is obviously a crying need for such 
information, which?RFE broadcasts in native 
languages to five Eastern European nations 
and which Radio Liberty broadcasts to the 
USSR in 17 Soviet languages. In effect, the 
statons function as a free press for some 
300-million fettered people. Contrast that 
with the Communist bloc's unrelieved prop-
aganda broadcasts, 900 hours a day in some 80 
languages to every continent. 
In the early and mid-50s, both stations 
were accused of adding to the tensions of the 
cold war. If so, that charge has not been true 
for at least 16 years. Indeed, former ambas-
sador to Polanil John Gronouski praised the 
accuracy and detail of RFE's coverage of tile 
Polish uprisings of 1968 (uprisings that were 
ignored by the Polish media). And both sta- ? 
tions gave factual reports on such important 
issues as the ouster of Khrushchev. the 
-Cuban missile crisis, and the Nixion visit to 
China, stories that the Communist world ig-
nored or downplaVeci. 
There was a minor flap last year when it 
was revealed that the Central Intelligence 
Agency had secretly been subsidizing both 
stations, even as Washington insisted' that 
they were privately financed. There was no 
evidence that the CIA ever interfered with 
program content, but such deception is in-
excusable nonetheless?which is why Presi-
dent Nixon proposed that the stations be fi-
nanced directly by Congress but run by an 
1I-member nonprofit corporation independ-
ent of government control. 
Yet Mr. Fulbright objects even to that. 
And although both houses of Congress have 
passed authorization bills, he has managed 
to delay any conference for resolving the dif-
ferences and thus keeping the stations alive. 
It is this opposition that we find hard to 
fathom. Does he alao object to the Voice of 
America? 
Although Senator Fulbright argues that the 
stations have no place in a period of East-
West detente, we suspect that they have ac-
tually contributed to detente by helping to 
erode ideological suspicion born of ignorance 
?and misinformation, and that abandoning 
them may prolong the East-West tension the 
Senator so passionately denounces. In any 
event, what's wrong with wanting to con-
tribute to the free flow of ideas across inter-
national borders?

The scene at Warsaw's interna-
tional airport one day last April 
;was more Marx Brothers than Karl 
'Marx. ? 
Decked out in khaki and red trim 
'uniform, one of the airport's se-
curity officers came trundling along 
carrying a foot-high stack of re-
search papers published by Radio 
. Free Europe. With a flourish he 
handed them to a fuming American 
newsman who had missed a plane 
to Budapest because customs of-
ficials had become inquisitive about 
the contents of his briefcase. 
? "No," said the newsman, who 
.feared that Hungarion police would 
? have been notified of the incident. 
? "I suggest you keep it." 
? ? I. 
The. Polish officer smiled, winked 
and replied: "I don't need the stuff. 
I hear it all on the radio anyway." 
A bit of Polish hyperbole? Well, 
hardly. It is common knowledge in 
Poland that the only way to have 
a glimmering of what is really 
going on in the country is to listen 
to Radio Free Europe. 
:One American sociologist who 
spent some time in a Polish village 
found that fur out of five house-
holds tuned in regularly to RFE. 
The Munich-based station estimates 
? its Polish listenership at 60 per cent 
of persons over the age of 14 (and 
it is a near certainty that among 
.the most avid members of the 
? audience are party leaders who dis-
,like being prisoners of their own 
,propaganda system). In Poland's 
capital, RFE is humorously called 
'Warsaw IV" because the regime 
has a lock on the city's three local 
stations. 
If Senator Fulbright succeeds in 
silencing RFE, which transmits to 
five Eastern European countries, 
and Radio Liberty, a sister sta-
kleee &trope

tion aimed at the Soviet Union, 
? this would be a development of 
considerable magnitude for millions 
of listeners in the Warsaw Pact 
area. 
Neither Voice of America, nor 
BBC, nor Deutsche Welle, nor 
Radio Vatican nor Radio Paris is 
presently equipped to fill the 
vacuum that would result. These 
net,,vo! --;_leam excellent surveys 
of w !1---news in native languages 
to the Communist-ruled nations and 
BBC especially, provides respected 
commentary on affairs concerning 
its target areas. 
But only Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty provide an abun-
dance of programs with y a home-
grown flavor for a home audience. 
RFE's ability to do this and cap-
ture a lion's share of the radio 
audience in Poland, Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania is 
a reflection of the kind of people 
working in its austere, white build-
ing on the edge of Munich's lovely 
English gardens. 
? ? ? 
While ?Americans hold the ulti-
mate policy-control posts at RFE, 
the departments handling broad-
casts and writing research papers 
are manned by Eastern Europeans 
who have left their native lands. 
This is a system with obvious 
built-in dangers and advantages. 
In their anti-Communist zeal, 
such employees gave a cold war-
rior image during the early and 
mid-1950's that has hurt the or-
ganization to this day. Senator Ful-
bright's speeches in his campaign 
to deny the radios any U.S. gov-
ernment funding attest to that. But 
in their mother-tongue command of 
19 languages and in their knowl-
edge of their homelands, the East-
ern Europeans on. the RFE staff 
provide an authenticity that is the 
basis for the wide acceptance of 
their programs. 
As the official goal of RFE has 
been transformed through the 
years from "liberation" to !'lib-
eralization," the ideological content 
of RFE has become. less polemical. 
During a few .das in mid-Febru-
ary, for example, the Bulgarian 
service dealt with promising new 
school reforms but reported on 
continuing sentiment for a longer 
mandatory period of school at-
tendance. The Polish service dealt 
with the trials of some security 
officers, suggesting they were po-
litically motivated. The Hungarian 
service voiced skepticism about 
new efforts to increase productivity 
that do not delineate a worker's 
personal stake in such efforts. The 
Chechoslovak service concentrated 
on implications of the crackdown 
against journalists of the Dubcek 
era. 
The tone, thus, is often critical 
but its thrust is reformist rather 
than revolutionary: Most research 
documents and mdny broadcasts 
either are starkly objective or as-
sume a tone of sympathetic en-
couragement if there is evidence of 
liberalization. 
? ? ? 
RFE broadcasters and research-
ers get much of their information 
by poring through national and 
local newspapers, by listening to 
monitored broadcasts and, by tap-
ping private channels of informa-
tion from the Soviet bloc. In its 
libraries are one million index 
cards. 
In addition, RFE has a news-
room manned chiefly by Americans 
who keep a watch on the material 
of all major news agencies, East 
and West, and provide the broad-
? ed, ? 
casting units with material for their 
international news surveys. RFE 
staffers and stringer S are found 
in most free-world news centers. 
All this suggests an enormous 
operation?and it is. According 
RFE statistics, the station ha S al-
most 1,600 employees (mostly in 
Munich), uses 32 transmitters in 
Portugal and West Germany with 
a total power of 2,245,000 watts, 
broadcasts 77 hours daily on its 
? five services, monitors 40 Commu-
nist stations, subscribes to SOO dif-
ferent publications and consumes 
48 million sheets of paper annually. 
With an' audience of -nearly 31 
million persons?ranging: from 6ll 
per cent of the over-14,listeners In 
Poland .t? 45 per cent in.Czechoslo-
vakia, RFE is far and away the 
most popular voice in Eastern. 
Europe, as the jamming 'efforts of-
the Communist regimesiattest. The 
Czechoslovak people turned - to it 
during the Soviet-led invasion of 
1968. RFE was a prime source of 
the news that Polish ?. authorities 
tried to suppress during the Baltic 
seaport upheavals of late, 1970. 
Thus if Radio -Free Europe is a

Fulbright suggests, it is not a mori-

'Radio Free Europe and Liberty 
An article by Joseph R. L. Sterne, 
pUblished in adjoining columns, 
provides an illuminating account of 
the work being done by Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty and the 
significant way in which they sup-
plement the European broadcasts 
of the Voice of America. All of these 
are voices of America, in the sense 
that, they are financed by the 
United States government and 
hence the American people. For 
years a pretense was maintained 
that Radio Free Europe depended 
,on voluntary financial contributions 
to operate when in fact it was 
being financed by the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency. At the insist-
ence of Senator Case of New Jersey 
the C.I.A. financing was both dis-
closed and halted, and now Senator 
Fulbright of Arkansas is making a 
strong effort to stop the federal 
government from continuing these 
stations through open, public ap-
propriations. 
Mr. Sterne's article shows per-
suasively, it seems to us, that Radio 
Free Europe in particular is doing 
important work that is not being 
done now by the Voice of America, 
and that it is established as a major 
source of news and information in 
the countries of Eastern Europe in 
which the press and radio are con-
trolled and operated by authoritar-
ian governments. Much the same 
applies to Radio Liberty, which 
aims its broadcasts at the people 
of the Soviet Union. 
At issue now in Washington is 
the future of Radio Free Europe 
and Radio Liberty. A bill passed 
by the Senate would fund the two 
stations only .until June 30, the 
end of the current fiscal year. A 
bill passed by the House .of Repre-
sentatives, and endorsed by the 
Nixon administration, would ap-
propriate funds for another year, 
until June 30, 1973, and set up an 
independent agency to administer 
the stations. The legislation rests 
now in a Senate-House conference 
committee, with Mr. Fulbright urg-
ing an end to the stations and re-
sisting the House provision. The 
cost of the stations is put at about 
$35 million a year. 
Mr. Fillbright argues that the 
stations are relics of the cold war 
and have no place in present Ameri-
can policy. But it can also be ar-
gued that the broadcasts have had 
a part in the development of pres-
ent policy and, indeed, help to 
reinforce it now. It would be a' 
mistake to cut the stations off the 
air this month, as apparently will 
happen if the conference commit 
tee impasse is not broken. A com-
mon-sense solution would be to 
continue the stations for another 
year, as proposed by the House and 
the Nixon administration, and in 
the meantime either modify the 
present operations of the Voice of 
America to the extent that they 
duplicate the two radio services, 
or merge the operations so that the 
strong points of Radio Free Europe 
and Radio Liberty are maintained:

RADIO FREE .EUROPE: 
Station Break? 
For two decades, Radie Tree Europe 
and Radio Liberty have been household 
words throughout Eastern- Europe and 
the Soviet Union. To many millions of 
people in the Communist bloc, in fact, 
the two American-financed stations have 
often been the sole source of ,unvarnished 
information about events around the 
world. This, not surprisingly, has made 
them constant targets for the wrath of 
Communist authorities. Forbidding their 
citizens to listen to these voices of "bour-
geois ideology," the Soviet and East 
European governineliave sought to 
jam the offending broadcasts. Their jam-
ming efforts have largely failed .and their 
prohibitions have been ignored. Last 
week, however,. the Communists got an 
unexpected assist from Washington when 
the U.S. Congress failed to extend gov-
ernment financing of the stations. 
The trouble began a year ago when 
New Jersey Sen. Clifford Case revealed 
'that while Radio Free Europe (which 
broadcasts to Eastern Europe) and Radio 
Liberty (which is beamed to the Soviet 
,Union) both claimed to be privately 
financed, the bulk of their money actual-
ly came from the Central Intelligence 
Agency. Although this fact had long 
been an open secret, its public disclosure 
touched .off a furor, since it fueled Com-
munist charges that the two stations were 
propaganda organs of the U.S. Govern-
ment. While an embarrassed Administra-
tion promptly transferred control of the 
stations' budget from the CIA to the U.S. 
Information Agency, Congress began to 
debate the organizations' ultimate fate. 
Recently, the House of Representatives 
approved an authorization of $35 million 
until June 1973, while a nongovernment-
al means Of funding was studied. But un-
der the prodding of Sen. William Ful-
bright, chairman of the powerful Foreign 
Relations Committee, the Senate balked. 
In Fulbright's view, the disclosure of 
CIA backing underscored the fact that 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty 
had deceived both their Iron Curtain 
listeners and the American people about 
their true nature. Contending that .both 
stations were an anachronism in an era' 
of budding East-West rapprochement, 
the Arkansas senator thundered: "These 
rhdios should be given an opportunity to 
take their rightful place in the graveyard 
of cold-war relics." And with that, he 
announced himself opposed to funding 
the.two stations beyond next June. 
Slogans: Defenders of the stations ar-
gued that it was Sen. Fulbright himself 
who was out of step with reality. They 
admitted that immediately after the sta-
tions were set up in 'Munich in the early 
?1950s, Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty dedicated themselves to encour-
aging the citizens of Eastern Europe to 
"roll back" Communism?a policy that 
helped to spark the ill-fated Hungarian 
revolt of 1956. But following the Hun-
garian uprising, the stations changed 
their tune. Trading their old slogan of 
"liberation" for a new one of "liberaliza-
tion," they have sought to enlighten their 
audiences with objective accounts of 
events suppressed by the heavily cen-
sored Communist media?a practice that 
has made the East 'European press dis-
cuss subjects it would otherwise ignore. 
With their combined staffs of some 
2,400 putting out 1,000 hours of broad-
casting in 25 languages a week, the sta-. 
tions also have become a prime means of 
disseminating. documents written by So-
viet and East European dissidents that 
have been smuggled abroad. In support 
of present. progran4ing, partisans of the 
station quoted a recent letter from a So-
viet scientist which said: "Radio Liberty 
is what a Russian station would have 
been like if we had freedom of speech." 
Adamant: All of this was known to Sen-
ator ? Fulbright. For he had himself com-
missioned a. Library of Congress study of 
the two stations that, contrary to his 
expectations, praised the professionalism 
of their staffs and the quality of their 
broadcasts and research reports, which 
are used by scholars all over the world. 
The study concluded that the demise 
of the stations would constitute a severe 
blow ? to the flow of information in the 
Communist world-. Despite this, however, 
Fulbright remained adamant in his op-
position to the stations. "The senator," 
said a staff member, "would like to see 
the whole operation liquidated." And, 
perhaps inevitably, no major congres-
sional figure seemed prepared to be as 
active in defending the stations as Ful-
bright has been in attacking them. Ac-
cordingly, although RFE and Radio Lib-
erty have enough funds to stay on the 
air for several more weeks, it seems 
quite possible that, in the end, the sen-
ator from Arkansas may succeed in si-
lencing them.

,To the Editor: 
I In connection with your Feb. 22 
editorial "Saving Free Voices," I 
Would like to emphasize that the 
liquidation of Radio Free Europe 
either by extinction or by policy de-
cision would be interpreted by the 
peoples of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary, Poland and Rumania as the 
final recognition by the United States 
of the present status quo and of the 
permanency of the Soviet rule in East 
Europe. 
Surely, it would not kill their striv-
ing for independence but, paradoxi-
cally. might result in shifting their 
hopes toward the People's Republic 
of China, which alone of the great 
powers shows some interest in East 
European countries regaining their 
Independence. This interest was dem-
onstrated by several announcements 
of the Peking Government and, not 
so long ago, bY the vehement con-
demnation of the Soviet invasion of 
Czechoslovakia by the present Chi-
nese delegation to the United Nations. 
It is also being demonstrated by Ra-
dio Peking broadcasts to East Europe 
and by Radio Tirana broadcasts to 
Poland. 
In addition, the closing of Radio 
Free Europe would represent an un- , 
warranted gift to Soviet Russia, which 
through its own and satellite facili-
ties pours "hate America" propaganda

left to keep them going for only a

?I Contributions from private

only a small part of the required 
support for the two organizations. 
They are now waiting , with faint 
hope, indeed, for an apparently in-

an estimated 31 million listeners

nied a Western source of news, re-
views of the Western press and com-
mentaries on affairs in their own 
countries and throughout the world. 
In a letter to the editor of the 
Times of London, author -Anatoly 
KuznetsoY, who defected to England 
from the. Soviet Union three years 
ago, wrote in fervent defense of Ra-
dio Liberty, which, he said, had been 
the principal source of truth for So-
viet intellectuals. 
"But Radio Liberty is something 
unsurpassable, said the writer after 
praising the . British Broadcasting 
Corp.'s Russian service. "ft is the 
voice of fellow countrymen who live 
in the. free world, a oiEe which is 
?not subject to Soviet -censorship and 
which openly speaks about .our spe-
cial problems in the Soviet Union. 
One of the most fervent wishes of 
the KGB (the Soviet secret police) is 
to destroy Radio Liberty." 
Independent newspapers of all po-
litical colors (with the exception of 
the Communist press, of course) 
have risen editorially to' the defense 
of Radio Free Europe and Radio Lib-
erty in Britain and throughout 
Western Europe. They have done so 
despite the common knowledge that 
these organizations once got part of 
their funds from the CIA and, even 
more importantly, despite the fact 
that many political leaders have 
baSed their government's policies on 
a platform of detente and peaceful 
coexistence with the Soviet bloc. ? 
? The socialist government of 
Chancellor Willy Brandt in ? West 
Germany has stood up -to tremen-
dous political pressure from the So-
viet Union to close down the opera-
tions of the two broadcasting organi-
zations, which both have their head-
quarters in the Bavarian capital of 
Munich. Brandt has thus far refused 
to bow to these pressures despite his 
eagerness to push ahead with his 
Ostpolitik. This has been true despite 
crudely unsubtle hints from Moscow 
that the Kremlin might be more pli-
able on such critical matters as ? 
Berlin and on better trade relations 
between the Soviet bloc and West 
Germany if Brandt closed the two 
stations.

The estimated $31 million required 
to keep the two organizations going 
is paltry compared to the budgets of 
most national networks. About 520 
million of this is needed by the lar-
ger RFE, which in addition to its na-
tive American staff employs about 
350 refugees from the five Commu-
nist bloc countries to which it broad-
casts. One hundred of these refugee 
employes have become U.S. citizens 
and many others are working to-
ward that end. 
Besides its broadcasts in the lan-
guages of the target countries, RFE 
monitors radio broadcasts .of these 
countries. It also combs a major part 
of the press from the capitals and 
the provinces of the countries con-
cerned. It coMpiles from all of this a 
vast wealth of reference material 
that has been invaluable to scholars, 
newsmen and politicians throughout 
the West. Thus it 4proVides a source 
of knowledge and understanding of 
what is going on inside those closed 
societies that no other organization 
or government agency has been able 
so effectively to provide. 
Fulbright has grounded his oppo-
sition to RFE and Radio Liberty on 
the charge that they are; as he put 
anachronistic remnants of the 
cold war. But thus far he has not 
called in a single official of Radio 
Free Europe from its Munich opera-
tion to hear the other side of the ar-
gument. 
The Soviet propaganda machine 
continues tirelessly to demand the 
demise of the two organizations, 
while at the same time the voices 
from Moscow, Prague, Warsaw, Bu-
dapest, Bucharest and Sofia carry on 
a relentless campaign of vitupera-
tion against the United States. 
This suggests that despite the :ver-
bal pledges of peaceful coexistence 
and a desire for detente, the cold 
war is not really ended. The Ameri-
can-sponsored operations in Munich 
do not return such vituperation but 
do offer some light to the Soviet bloc 
peoples. 
If the pressure in Washington to 
choke off these two organizations 
succeeds, it will mean that what

caster a few months after the abor-
tive Hungarian uprising of 1956. He'd 
been Urging the Hungarians to revolt 
? for months, he told me, and. broad-
casting that the United States could 
.be counted on to come to their aid. 
When ,Hungarians rose and fell on 
their own, his stomach heaved, and 
he quit. 
Morq recently, in ,Romania in 
1967, I encountered an enthusiastic 
high school student who raved over 
Radio Free Europe. and who seemed 
to think the streets of the United 
States were paved with gold. I 
quized him a bit about what seemed. 
a too-facile swallowing, of rosy -prop-
aganda, and asked him whether he 
also listened to the BB? (British 
Broadcasting Company) and V044 
(Voice of America) programs. Both 
were readily heard, and not jammed. 
No, he told me. They were too 
tame. He liked to be told how terrible 
his country was, and how great ours 
was, without any qualifications. 
, There may have been a time when 
such programming had a function. 
Our government Clearly thought so; 
the CIA for years has provided most 
of fh?elt? support, although they were 
purportedly privately run by con-
cerned Americans. It's only in the 
last year that Congress has forced the 
funding into the open. - 
. Whatever the past justification, the 
time has come to quit. We can't propa-
gandize the whole world. If we must 
have transmitters beaming our view 
of the news to. countries with closed 
systems, shouldn't we telecast news 
of Mr. Nixon's Peking visit to the 
Taiwanese, who were allowed no news 
of the trip? Shouldn't we force some 
honest reporting into. Greece, whose 
military junta has suppressed free 
comment? Where- do we stop? 
The place to stop is before we 
start. The Voice of America has an 
entirely adequate program of straight 
news, Ainerican 'music, bits of Ameri-
cana. That's enough.

'Dissenter' handful among Soviets b 
'Made in us.' stamp 
? By MIKE DA'VIDOW 
' Who are the Soviet "dissent-
ers?" Even the U.S. capitalist 
press has to admit they are a 
/pitiful handful. Dusko Doder, 
Assistant Foreign Editor of the 
Washington Post and formerly 
UPI Moscow correspondent point-
ed out (Int. Herald Tribune, 
Feb. 8, 1971): ? "The dissident 
movement is so small that most 
observers regard it as being 
' without political significance." 
But the U.S. capitalist press has 
gone all out on this totally un-
representative handful, precisely 
to manufacture political contro-
versy. . 
The fact is, they hardly cause 
a ripple in the Soviet Union, not 
withstanding the massive use 
made of the dissenters by the 
CIA-sponsored Voice of Ameri-
ca and Radio Free Europe. 
, The truth is that the blown-tqi 
iimage of Soviet dissent bears 
the trade mark?made in the 
U.S.A. Robert Kaiser hints at 
this In the International Herald 
Tribune (Jan. 27) when he notes 
that the Western news organiza-
tions in Moscow comprise "the 
single most attentive audience 
to the confusing spectacle of 
political dissent in the Soviet 
Union." 
'? Doder is much more to the 
point. He confesses that.. the 
stories sent by Moscow. corre-
spondents of the capitalist press 
"have created a somewhat dis-
torted picture of a Soviet Union 
populated by angry poets and sci-
entists." But notwithstanding this 
frank admission, such distor-
tions continue to come from the,. in the U.S. today. But even Kai-
typewriters of correspondents. ser had to admit the difficulty 
Some dissenters portray them- of making this charge stick when 
selves as representing the new he noted the "crackdown" has 
rather than the old society.1 
II "directly touched less than 35 
fatt they try to lay claim to be- people." 
Ing the best and most advanced Much can also be gathered 
representatives of the future from the character of some of 
since they supposedly want to the correspondents who blossom- , 
make socialism in the Soviet ed out as fervent champions of i 
Union more "humane and dem- Soviet dissenters. Take William 
ocratic." But their pretenses are Cole, the CBS man who smug-' 
exposed by. their alliances. On gled 'out . a recent filmed inter-

The relationship between the 
"dissidents" and the U.S. cap-
italist press is a calculating one 
on both sides. More, it is an "al-
liance" which Doder describes 
as an arrangement of "mutual 
convenience." 
The Soviet dissenters and U.S. 
press have another thing in com-
mon. Both are doing their ut-
most to use the tragic mistakes 
committed during the cult of the 
personality period, viewed by the 
overwhelming majority of the 
Soviet people as past history, to 
besmirch the tremendous human 
achievements of Soviet society, 
to slander the role played by 
the Soviet Communist Party and 
its leaders, and to boost bour-
geois democracy as the only real 
democracy. This is still .done 
in the name of "democratizing" 
socialism since one could?hardly 
get very far here with open ap-
peals for bourgeois democracy. 
Both dissenters and the U.S. 
'press in fact try to use past mis-
takes as a club over the heads 
of Soviet state bodies. When The 
Soviet judicial authorities re-
Lpond to brazen violations of 
their country's laws with penal-
ties, the cry of "Staliaist repres-
sion" is trumpeted to the world 
by the powerful U.S. propaganda 
machine. 
The U.S. press has tried to 
picture these acts of law enforce-
ment as massive' repression in 
an obvious attempt to take some 
of the heat off the truly mass 
repression of democratic rights 
when the expulsion of a- Canad-
ian correspondent was being dis-
cussed. All admitted that the 
"source" for the Canadian cor-
respondent's anti-Soviet tripe 
came from his Moscow mistress. 
But that didn't seem to bother 
Cole or his colleagues.. 
The Canadian correspondent, 
they noted ruefully, made a mis-
take. His timing was wrong. An 
expulsion can be very helpful as 
advance publicity for a book on 
the Soviet Union, providing one 
has already 'managed to stay long 
enough to give the impression 
of expertise, they all agreed. 
I was with Cole in Tashkent ? 
in December of 1969. One would ' 
think the big story there was 
how the entire Soviet people rA.-
built the Uzbek capital -which 
was largely destroyed in an 
earthquake in 1966. But the in-
terest of Cole and other eorre-
spondents of the capitalist press 
was in other directions. 
They were on a hunt for so-
called Tatar "dissidents" that to 
Cole and his colleagues was the 
real story of Tashkent. 
Or take another "champion" 
of 'Soviet dissidents Whom Kai-
ser cast's in somewhat of a 
"militant" role, David Bonavia 
of the London Times. Bonavia, 
too, was with --me in Tashkent 
and, if anything, was one of the 
leaders of the hunt for .Tatar 
dissidents. Then, in the course 
of our conversation, it turned out 
that this friend of "oppressed" 
Tatars was formerly a corre-
spondent in Saigon and one of 
the most fervent supporters of 
Nixon's Vietnam policy I've ever 
come across.

WASHINGTON?There is not the mer-
est, minute molecule of justification for the 
way Sen. William Fulbright ID-Ark.) is?us-
ing his power as chairman of the Senate 
?? . Foreign Relations committee to frustrate 
the will of .Congress. MS goal is to kill Ra-
dio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. . 
The facts in ? the strange case of Ful-
bright vs. Congress speak for themselves. 
FOR TWO DECADES Radio Free Eu-
rope has been broadcasting from Munich to 
the people of Eastern Europe and ?Radio 
Liberty- to the peoples of the Soviet Union. 
the news and commentary which their gov-
ernment censorship denies them. 
? Until two years ago, these broadcasts 
.Were largely supported bY funds from the 
Central En Iliffen .e.,%gcucy. Congress dis-
app ?oved this under - the - table financing 
? and voted appropriations to enable the 
' State Department to allocate funds openly 
to the two stations. 
This was the policy of the. U. S. govern. 
? ment and this was the policy of Congress 
?until last summer, until Sen. Fulbright act-
ed to kill all financial assistance and bring 
this broadcasting beamed behind the Iron 
Curtain to an end. 
. By a. voice vote. the Senate decisively 
;? rejected Sen. Fulbright's plea that Radio 
. Free Europe and Radio Liberty be put put 
of existence. 
? 
By a vote of 271 to 12 the House did the 
same.. 
? 
But because the Senate and the House 
passed differing bills,, the legislation has 
been tied up in conference, for nearly nine 
months and now the two stations are dan-
gling. . at the end of a noose. It is a noose 
tied *by. a stalemate which Fulbright has 
? nurtured. 
? 
Last summer when he saw he was losing 
, his case in the Senate, Fulbright pleaded 
for delay until the Library of Congress Re-
the Majority 
? 
search Service' could complete a 'study he 
had asked for on whether "it is in the public 
interest to provide tax dollars for the two 
, ? 
radios." 
? The Library of Congress' report so con-
tradicted Sen. Fulbright's views that he did 
his best to keep it secret. He not only stood 
out against the public's right to know but 
also against Congress' right to? know.. 
' 
Some copies of the report have circulat-
ed and its central finding is that Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty "contribute sub-
stantially to'preserve the reservoir of good-
will toward the United States." 
? ' 
The New York Times and, the Washing-
ton Post. who are as anti-cold war as they 
. come, both urged that the U.S.-financed 
Munich radios keep up their. good work.- . 
Says the Times: If ,the deadlock kilts 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, the 
chief gainers will be the Soviet bloc's 
hard-liners who hate the two radio stations 
as allies of the liberal and progressive ele-
ments in the Communist world." 
Says the Post: "These (broadcasts) are 
nOt provocative, propagandist diatribes and 
still less do they 'sell' America, USIA-style. 
Rather, what both stations attempt to do is 
tell the people of Eastern Europe and Rus-
sia news about themselves and their coun-
tries which their governments don't want 
them to hear." 
WHEN SEN..FULBRIGIIT made his 
case ? or rather failed to make it ? on the 
floor of the Senate, he said: "I submit these 
? radios should be given an opportunity to 
take their rightful place in the graveyard-of 
cold war relics." ? 
That is the view which both the Senate 
and House overruled. Now Fulbright is 
trying to bury majority rule with a tactic 
that ought to be consigned to the graveyard 
of outworn politics.

2.6 it illi n, Foreign, Aid 
? Clears Hill Under Protest 
By Spencer Rich 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
The Senate, 45 to 36, gave 
Anal congressional clearance 
yesterday to a $2.6 billion for-
eign 'aid bill?about $900 mil-
lion less than the administra, 
tion sought. ? ' 
The, bill also . carries $599 
million for related programs-
such as the Peace Corps, 
Cuban refugee aid, the World 
Bank and the Inter-American 
Development Bank. 
The Senate vote, protested 
by William Proxmire (D-Wis.) 
Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and 
bthets who said the final 
measure was top-heavy with 
unneeded military aid outlays, 
completed action on-the fiscal 
197-2 foreign .aid request only 
four months before the fiscal 
year expires. Both Maryland 
senators voted for the meas-
ure, while both Virginia sena-
tors opposed it. 
' ,In other foreign policy de-
yelopments on Capitol Hill 
yesterday: 
? Fifty-three senators led by 
. Charles H. Percy (R Ill.) and 
Hubert H. Humphrey (D-
Minn.), and including all the 
Democratic presidential candi-
dates except the absent Vance 
Hartke (D-Ind.), introduced a 
resolution calling for contin-
ued funding of Radio Free Eu-
rope and Radio Liberty broad-
casts into Eastern Europe. 
Emergency funds for the 
broadcasts expired Feb. 22, 
and an authorization to con-
tinue them has been held up 
because a House-Senate con-
ference cannot agree on the 
terms. 
Senate conferees, led by 
Foreign Relations Committee 
Chairman J.W. -Fulbright (D-
Ark.), are willing to let the 
broadcasts continue through 
June 30, with the State De-
partment required to justify 
anything beyond that; House 
conferees, led by Foreign Af-
fairs Committee Chairman 
Thomas E, Morgan (D-Pa.), 
want continuation to June 30,1 
1973. 
Fulbright regal ds the broad! 
casts as a needless irritant to 
East West relations. He says' 
that if the broadcasts are pop-1 
ular with U.S. allies, NATO 
should consider funding them. ' 
. . 
" ? Sens. Charles McC: Ma-. 
thias Jr. (R-Md.) and Philip A. 
Hart (D-Mich.), introduced a. 
resolution calling on the ' 
United States to speed conclu-
sion of an international ban 
on underground nuclear tests 
by abandoning its demand for 
on-site inspections. The two 
senators told a press confer-
ence that seismic detection of 
underground blasts had im-
proved so much that on-site 
inspections are not necessary 
to verify whether participants 
in an underground test ban 
are complying. 
The 1963 Nucleat Test Ban 
Treaty barred all nuclear tests 
except thoSe conducted under-
ground. Hart and Mathias said 
the number of underground 
tests by all nuclear powers.; 
had increased from an average! 
of 40 a year before 1963 to 48 a? 
year since. 
Dr. Herbert Scoville of the 
Federation of American Scien-
tists sat with Hart during the , 
press conference, and saidl 
blasts of about 5 kilotons or 
more now could be distin-
guished seismically from 
earthquakes. 
? The House Foreign Affairs 
Subcommittee on Asian and 
Pacific Affairs, headed by 
Rep. Cornelius J. Gallagher 
(D-N.J.), voted 6 to 1 for a con-
current resolution calling for 
U.S. diplomatic recognition of 
Bangladesh. 
Gallagher said some 45 ,na-
tions ,had already recognized 
Bangladesh, fornierly East 
Pakistan. The fact is that the 
usual requirements for recog-
nition such as control of terri-
tory, approval of the -popula-
tion and a willingness by the 
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman gov-
ernment to meet its interna-
tional obligations have now 
been met," he said in a state-
ment.

about the world and themselves, by choking 
off the appropriations for Radio Free Eu-

.Having lived in Communist-run Poland for 
21 years7-1 can hardly recall a day or two

news. Despite the jamming and penalties for 
listening, almost every citizen of Poland, 
Communists and anti-Communists alike, 
?turn to the RFE in order to get news that 
hasn't been distorted, disregarded, manipu-
lated or twisted. It was from. RFE. not from 
the Communist-run Polish media, that Poles 
have learned about workers' demonstrations 
In ? Poznan (1936), the Hungarian rising 
(1956), student protests (March 1968); events 
before and after the invasion of Czechoslo-
vakia (1968) and hunger riots in the coastal 
cities of Poland (1970). 
? - for years, the popularity of RFE and the 
het that it has a whole network of corre-
spondents behind the- Iron Curtain report-
ing the abuses and crimes of the Communist 
regimes was leaving those regimes sleepless. 
For years the Communists tried to discredit 
,RFE and force its liquidation. Last year in 
Poland, a Communist spy captain, Czecho-
wicz, who infileated the RFE trying to get 
the names of the correspondents, was given 
a hero's welcome on his return to the Peo-
ple's Republic. His achievements were 
highly publicized by the Communist radio, 
press and television and gave new momen-
tum to the attacks on RFE. 
Mr. Fulbright is not alone in his attempts 
to deprive the people of Eastern Europe and 
Russia of the services of RFE and RL. How-
ever, one can hardly congratulate him on his 
company.

Overseas broadcasts 
By William E. Griffith 
Sen. J. William Fulbright seems deter-
mined to use his position as chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee to 
strangle Radio. Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty. For two decades these stations have 
been broadcasting from Munich to Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union. Until last 
year they were largely funded covertly by 
the cm. Now, properly, Congress must 
publicly decide if and to what extent they 
are to continue. The Senate, with Senator 
Fulbright grudgingly agreeing, has voted 
fort a one-year extension under the State 
Department, while the House has voted for 
a two-year extension a:%1-41?a study commis-
sion. The two houses are now deadlocked 
In conference committee, and Senator Ful-
bright hopes that this deadlock will kill the 
two radios, whose-temporary appropriations 
are running out. 
? Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty 
broadcast 18 hours per day, largely on 
Internal developments. Their broadcastS, as 
a recent Library of Congress survey com-
missioned by Senator Fulbright's commit-
tee showed, are objective, comprehensive, 
and de,loted to aiding-peaceful, democratic 
change in these countries. Their original 
"cold war" character has decisively 
changed since the '50's. Radio Liberty, for 
example, broadcasts into the Soviet Union 
the dissident literature, such as Solzhenit-
syn, which Moscow is trying to suppress, 
while Radio Free Europe gives to East 
Europeans the equivalent of a free press 
and radio. 
Senator Fulbright maintains that these 
radios, should be 'discontinued because they 
are "remnants of the cold war." He thus 
displays a curious naivet?bout how the 
Soviets and the East European regimes 
view "peaceful coexistence." For them, as 
they constantly and publicly assert, it is not 
the decline but the intensification of "in-
ternational ideological class struggle." This 
is clearly demonstrated by their massive 
radio broadcasting effort to the West and by 
? their other large-scale propaganda efforts, 
Including their massive efforts to get rid of 
? Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. 
Moreover, because d?nte,' which they need 
for reasons of foreign policy, is so danger-
ous to them internally, they are intensifying 
their repression at home, as is evidenced by 
the recent stepped-up arrests and trials in 
the Soviet Union and in Czechoslovakia. 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, on 
the other hand, give information and hope to 
the liberals in these countries. Only the dog-
matists there would benefit from their clos-
ing. 
Communist states are determined to mo-
nopolize all means of elite and mass com-
munication. Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty have prevented the Soviet and East 
European regimes from achieving this ob-
jective. Senator Fulbright may na?ly ex-
pect that the Soviets and East European-
rulers would reciprocate their liquidation, 
but he is mistaken. Indeed, to end them 
unilaterally now, just before President Nixon 
is going to Moscow, would deprive the U.S. 
of one of its major assets in the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe. No way to start 
bargaining. 
Senator Fulbright seems isolated in Con-
gress in wanting to close down these sta-
tions. Moreover, U.S. and European editorial 
opinion is for them. Should he be permitted 
to use his chairmanship to impose his will 
on the great majority in both houses of 
Congress. who favor the radios' continua-
tions? He is indeed a willful man but he 
is not and should not be in charge of U.S. 
foreign policy. It is high time that the Presi-
dent and the Congress overrule him and 
ensure that Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty can, continue their good work.

RADIO FREE EUROPE AND RADIO 
LIBERTY . 
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, there is a 
great need to continue the financing of 
' Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. I-
? ask unanimous consent that an editorial 
column entitled "A Setback for Liberty," 
. written by John P. Roche, and published 
in the February 26, 1972, Washington 
Post, and an editorial entitled "Congress 
1- and Free Voices," published in the Phila-
delphia Bulletin of February 25, 1972, be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the items 
were ordered 0 be printed in the RECORD. 
as follows: 
A SETBACK FOR LIBERTY 
(By John P. Roche) 
One of the most bizarre?terrying?scenes 
In Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's masterpiece, 
"The First Circle," describes a visit to a So-
viet prison by a distinguished American, a 
woman with high political connections. A 
group of prisoners are put through a special 
.drill for her benefit dressed decently, put in a 
clean cell with an ikon, and told by the police 
that if they don't perform, zap! They did go 
through with the charade and the American 
visitor left with a high opinion of Soviet 
justice. 
What made this sort of thing possible, of 
- -course, was the total Isolation from the 
world outside. Once caught up in the toils 
of Joseph Stalin's terror apparatus, it was 
eVery.man for himself with no hope of succor, 
no hope that outsiders would even learn of 
the situation. Part of Solzhenitsyn's power 
comes from his 'description of how some hu-
man beings resisted atomization and per-
sisted in acts of decency. 
The .prerequisite for running an efficient 
tyranny?as Aristotle pointed out more than 
2000 years ago?ie to destroy this human 
sense of solidarity, and to convince each vic-
tim that he is alone in the face of over-
whelming power, that no one cares. This has 
become more difficult with modern tech-
niques of communication. It is hard to jam 
all incoming radio messages, and the spread 
of the transistor radio and of tape recorders 
has launched a whole new era in underground 
communications. Through Radio Liberty and 
Radio Free Europe the United States has for 
almost a generation brought to the peoples 
of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe the 
message that they are not alone. 
To take but one example, a Soviet Jew 
signed a petition attacking the appalling 
Leningrad trials. Thirty years ago he would 
have dropped this pebble down a bottomless 
well, but now, the next morning at 2:30, 
Radio Liberty was on the air with the text 
of the petition and the names of the signa-
tories. This man, now in Israel, recalls the 
.??? sense of triumph as he heard the broadcast: 
"They (the KGB) can take us now, but our 
testimony will stand in history." 
Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe have 
reunited these peoples with history. And in 
the view of Sen. J. W. Fulbright that is a 
Capital offense. Just? about the time this 
column is printed, these radio stations?
formerly subsidized by the CIA?will go broke 
unless emergency action is taken. Both 
houses of Congress have approved their con-
tinuation with overt funding and there is 
overpowering consensus that they have done 
a splendid and nonprovocative Job in a very 
delicate area, but Fulbright singlehandedly 
- has been blocking a compromise between 
House and Senate versions of their appro-
priation. 
Fulbright refused to call a meeting of the 
House and Senate conferees, obviously hop-
ing that in this backhanded fashion he can 
quietly. destroy what he has called these 
"Cold War relics." It is a clever move: If he 
can stall, key personnel will have to find other 
jobs and the expertise built up over a genera-
tion will dribble away. He must not be per-
mitted to get away with it. 
No one who reads this column will suffer 
from the illusion that I believe the United 
States is perfect, but we Americans have 
been fortunate. We have never had to rise 
at 2:30 and turn on a radio to learn that we 
are still members of the human race, that we 
are still part of history. We can not allow Ful-
bright to deprive our brothers of this price-
less link with humanity. 
CONGRESS AND Fa zz VOICES 
A stalemate between the U.S.. House and 
Senate over separate bills to continue fi-
nancing Radio Free Europe and Radio Lib-
erty threatens very sudden death for the two 
enterprises spawned by the cold war to offset 
censorship of news in Russia and the Com-
munist bloc. 
If the two stations stand as nothing more 
than relics of the cold war, then, their con-
tinued existence does seem inconsistent with 
the new era of detente emerging between the 
United States and Russia. 
But in fact, the approach of broadcasts in 
recent years has changed, as attested by a 
recent Library of Congress study, from one 
of "liberating" people to "liberalizing" the 
information available to citizens in Commu-
nist societies. Translated, the aim is no 
longer propaganda but a genuine effort to 
present an objective accounting of outside 
events and cultural development, generally 
not permitted by the government-controlled 
presses in recipient nations. 
Whether one chooses to believe the pro-
gram is only a relic of the cold war or some-
thing more, its quick termination by what 
amounts to a technical strategern is unwise. 
It deprives President Nixon of a possible bar-
gaining counter iii his meeting with the Rus-
sians in May and presents a poor picture of 
democratic procedures to individuals who 
have voluntarily helped support tile broad-
casts. 
Congress should authorize some 'addi-
tional funding now and delay a decision on 
the long-terrn continuation of the broad-
casts until their present and potential bene-
fits have been properly assessed. An abrupt 
cutoff now would satisfy only the opponents 
who see nothing redeeming in the program 
and the Communist hard liners who bitterly 
resent the broadcasts. 
CENTENNIAL OF YELLOWSTONE 
NATIONAL PARK 
Mr. MOSS. 1'Tr. President, today we 
mark the century anniversary of our 
first great national park?Yellowstone. 
Thus, 100 years ago, our country began 
its enlightened national policy to set 
aside, preserve, and make available for 
all people superlative area,s of natural 
beauty, scenic grandeur, geologic inter-
est, and historic significance. 
With laudable diligence and devotion, 
the National Park Service discharges its 
duties as custodian and interpreter of 
these wonderlands. Our national parks, 
national monuments, national historic 
sites, national seashores, national rec-
reation areas have grown in number and 
diversity.' They are far flung and expand-
ing. But the needs of our people for out-
door beauty and experience a-re growing 
even more rapidly. We need more parks. 
Yellowstone remains, however, the 
bellwether Park?its wonders, beauty, 
and wildlife undiminished over a cen-
tury of time. We must protect and keep 
it so for the century to come?and be-
yond. 
THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOCIETY 
OF A FIRST AND . SECOND CEN-
TURY OF NATIONAL PARKS 
Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, 100 
years ago today, President Grant signed 
into law the creation of Yellowstone Na-
tional Park?the Nation's and the 
world's first national park. 
This marked the beginning of a unique 
new. way of thinking in public land man-
agement in this country, and for that 
matter, throughout the entire world. The 
unique natural resources embraced by 
what then became Yellowstone National 
Park were considered to be of such novel-
ty and value that they should be pre-
served for all time for all to see and en-
joy. No individual or group should have 
the right to exploit or despoil them for 
personal gain. 
The passing century since the creation 
of Yellowstone National Park has .borne 
a tremendous growth in the. national 
idea?not only in the numbers of na-
tional park system units?which now to-
tal 284-but also in the depth and in-
tensity of understanding, appreciation, 
and concern for the preservation of our 
natural, historic, and cultural heritage 
unspoiled. The first national parks paid 
primary homage to the preservation of 
some of no ture's most superlative natural 
wonders. But as the Nation and the park 
system grew, attention was also turned 
to preserving some of the most signif-
icant historic and cultural resources of 
this great country. With the onrushing 
demand for opportunity to refresh the 
body and spirit in the great outdoors, re-
sources primarily bearing significant 
outdoor recreational opportunity have 
also come to be incorporated into the na-
tional park system. 
As a result of a full century of effort 
by dedicated ?individuals, groups, legis-
lators, and administrators, we have built 
a national park system which was not 
only the first, but is undoubtedly the 
finest in the entire world. There is per-
haps no other area of cultural enrich-
ment where this country has contributed 
so exclusively to the rest of the world 
as in the exportation of the national 
park idea. There are now 1,2.04 national 
park and equivalent reserves around the 
globe administered by 93 different coun-
tries. 
In recognition of the important con-
tribution that the national park idea 
has made to our society, President Nixon 
has recently proclaimed 197`c as "Na-
tional Parks Centennial Year." Many 
formsof celebration and commemora-
tion will be taking place throughout 
this year. While recognizing the achieve-
ments of the past is most logical and im-
portant on such an occasion, the Interior 
Department's National Park Service has 
chosen to put principal emphasis on 
looking ahead to the future. The theme 
chosen for the National Parks Centen-
nial Year is "Parks, Man, and His En-
vironment," and it is designed to strong-

'DAVID LAWRENCE  
Why Give 
A controversy of an unusual 
nature?to suppress free 
speech?has arisen as a result 
of an effort by some members 
of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee to cause the 
American government to dis-
continue its support, for the 
broadcasting news services 
known as Radio Free Europe 
and Vadio Liberty. These have 
won eat praise for their daily 
Operations in informing the 
pOpulation of areas which oth-
erwise would not get the truth 
about news events. 
Rep. Robert Steele, R-Conn., 
declares that the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee has 
'received two favorable reports 
on the radio stations but has 
refused to make them public, 
and that a Senate bill to fi-
nance the project and, a House 
bill authorizing creation of a 
senii-governmental commis-
sion to oversee a similar serv-
ice have been stalemated. 
Steele says he has requested 
Chairman J. William Ful-
bright. fl-Ark., to publish the 
reports made to the Senate 
committee and has asked Con-
gress to keep the radio service 
alive pending a study of the 
findings in the reports. 
Meanwhile, the European 
press is disturbed over the 
possibility that Radio Free Eu-
rope might be discontinued. 
The London Times a few days 
ago said in an editorial that 
the American station "pro-
vides a calmer and more fac-
tual news service that is very 
widely heard in Eastern Eu-
rope." The editorial added: 
"It is not always perfect but 
? 
Up Radio Free Europe? 
it clearly meets a very deeply 
felt need among its listeners, 
as any traveller in Eastern 
Europe can testify. It gives 
them news about the world and 
about their own domestic af-
fairs that is not available from 
their own controlled press. 
"Naturally Radio Free Eu-
rope is a thorn in the flesh of 
East European governments 
because it breaks their monop-
oly of information. For them, 
truth in any form is an enemy 
agent. It can therefore be said 
to undermine their system,' but 
only so long as people want to ? 
listen to it. 
"Meanwhile, whether its ac-
tivities can be regarded as im-
proper interference depends 
on- what you mean by detente. 
As the Communists them-
selves never tire of pointing 
out, detente does not mean end-
ing the peaceful competition 
between two systems. What it 
should mean is codifying the 
rules on a fair and equal basis. 
"There is no reason why 
: these rules should exclude 
peaceful and equal competi-
tion between ideas. Indeed, 
this is one of the basic values 
of the Western world which 
should be most vigorously de-
fended. 
"Nor can anyone say that 
the Communists do not have 
? 
an equal chance. They have 
free access for their ideas in 
Western markets. They can 
work through legal publica-
tions and legal Communist 
parties. They can broadcast as 
much as they wish, and as 
'their programmes on Ulster 
have shown they can win all 
the prizes' for vicious inac-
curacy. 
"The West has far fewer 
means at its disposal. To give 
up Radio Free Europe would 
be a gratuitous act of. appease-
ment that wou,ld unbalance 
things even more and would 
be a very severe blow to the 
millions if people in Eastern 
Europe who still look to the 
West not only for information ? 
but for the defense of values in 
which they believe, and which 
even many progressive Com-
munists regard as vital for the 
salvation of their system." 
Congress has not debated 
the question thoroughly, and 
presumably hasn't studied the 
facts contained in the special 
reports which the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee has 
had prepared. If these were 
made public, the nation would 
learn of the importance of Ra-
dio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty. 
The United States has per-
formed no greater act of infor-
mation distributioA than has 
been accomplished by radio 
stations that tell what is hap-
pening all over the world, in-
cluding events of international 
significance. This news reach-
ing into Communists countries 
has been useful in conttadict-
ing propaganda misrepresen-
tations. 
Many members of Congress 
are puzzled that any effort 
should be made to abolish Ra-
dio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty, which have rendered 
so valuable a service to the 
world.

several editorials which have appeared 
? in newspapers around the world be 
printed in the Extensions of Remarks. 
. There. being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
. as follows: 
Hon. Hamar Scorr, 
Minority Floor Leader, U.S. Senate, 014 
'Senate Office Building, Washington, 
We believe it our duty to inform you that 
we shall immediately be obliged to begin the 
liquidation of Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty unless congressional action on pend-
ing authorizing legislation is completed. 
.- The essential facts are these: 
(1) Both Houses of Congress have passed 
authorization and appropriation bills to 
? provide necessary U.S. Government support 
In fiscal year 1972. 
? (2) The President of the United States 
? has assured us by letter that in his view 
"the ,free flow of information and ideas 
among nations is indispensable to more nor-
mal relations between East and West and 
to better prospects for an enduring peace" 
and that his administration believes that 
broadcasting of this type continues to serve 
a fundamental national interest.

by . leading newspapers throughout the

given unqualified support. We are sending

We want you to know that we are pre-

arrangement that would assure the necessary 
U.S. Government contribution while leaving

Examiner and other Hearst papers] ' 
? EDITRR'S REPORT?A SMELL OF SMOKE 
(By William Randolph Hearst, Jr.) 
PALM BEACH, FLA.?President Nixon's his-
torte mission to Peking is of course the Big 
Story of the day, but comment in this col-
umn is being deferred until we see what 
actually happens over there in alaoland. 
Judging by the poisonous major foreign 
policy article transmitted from Peking on 
Friday by Mao's official press agency. Hsinhua, 
all I will say Is that it doesn't look as if 
the get-together is going to be all, warm 
lichee nuts, aromatic tea and happy fortune 
cookies. 
The article, issued while the President was 
en route in his quest for "a generation of 
peace," accused the Nixon administration of 
continuing policies of "aggression and war" 
and proceeded with a lengthy tough talk re-
'capitulation of all the many differences be-
tween the United States and Red China. 
Since even the President admittedly does 
not know what may come of his trip, all the 
advance speculation which has been filling 
the news columns strikes me as pretty futile. 
So?with no further apology?I turn to an-
other news story which deserves a lot more. 
attention than it probably has gotten. 
This shocker, strictly speaking, was not 
straight news. It came in the form of a scoop 
reported with editorial comment last Thurs-
day in the crackerjack Washington column 
of Rowland Evans and Robert Novak. Here 
are the first three paragraphs, summarizing 
the latest outrage being attempted by my 
least favorite senator, J. William Fulbright 
of Arkansas: 
"The inexorable campaign by Sen. Ful-
bright to cast U.S. foreign policy in his own 
image has almost strangled the broadcasts 
beamed into Communist eastern Europe by 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. 
"Operating from his power base as chair-
man of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, Fulbright Is within days of cutting 
off, at least temporarily, vital U.S. govern-
merit. subsidies for the two programs. Unless 
Congress acts before next Tuesday, the money 
stops. 
"Congressional sentiment for the broad-
casts is so overwhelming that it seems im-
probable Fulbright will ultimately aucceed. ' 
But he has come perilously close to doing 
what twodecades of Moscow's electronic jam-
ming could not do: end non-governmental 
communications between the United States 
and some 200 million residents of the Soviet 
Union and 100 million in five other Com-
munist countries." 
It must be realized as background that 
eastern Europeans since 1950 have been hun-
grily dependent on the two Munich-based 
broadcasters for uncensored news of the out-
side world. Radio Free Europe transmits to 
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania 
and Bulgaria. Radio Liberty is beamed into 
the Soviet Union itself. 
I have been in all but Bulgaria and talked 
with residents of all of these countries. In-
variably they have stressed that the news 
and entertainment they get from the Ameri-
can stations constitutes a real godsend to 
their lives?a whiff of the freedom they are 
denied. 
The Communist governments, naturally, 
are deeply resentful of the broadcasts, which 
is why the appeasement-minded Fulbright 
has been trying to cut off funds for the sta-
tions. As Evans and Novak put it: 
"To the chairman, such spending is an an-
achronistic relic of the cold war, prejudicial 
to East-West detente." 
The fact that Fulbright has been trying 
to block further broadcast funds is bad 
enough. The way he has gone about it is all 
but incredible and an inexcusable affront to 
his fellow lawmakers. 
As Evans and Novak tell it, it seems that 
the stations have been operating with sub-
sidies provided by the CIA. Last year the 
administration proposed direct government 
financing but Fulbright balked, demanding 
first a study of the operation by the Library 
of Congress to see if the broadcasts are "in 
the public interest." 
The study reports were in FulbrIght's 
hands before last January 26?and he wasn't 
pleased with what he read. They warmly 
praised the programs and strongly advocated 
continued financing by the government. 
"Radio Free Europe," reads one report, 
"contributes substantially to preserve the 
reservoir of good will toward the United 
States by eastern Europeans." 
The other aeporfs says: ? 
"Radio Liberty has played an explicit 
enough indirect role in lightening the bur-
den of ,the Soviet people." 
Now cet this. On January 26 a Senate-
House conference met to resolve differences 
in their resnective bills providing funds for 
continuing the broadcast. They got nowhere 
because Sen. Fulbrieht alone knew of the 
favorable reports and he had sent them back 
to the Library of Congress for "reworking!" 
According to Evans and Novak. 
This outrege is only another all to typi-
cp example of the extremes to which our 
consistent armeasers of Communism go. 
For the life of me, I simply cannot under-
stand these people. They claim to be Ameri-
cpns Yet they et:maize or actively oppose al-
most anything intended to strengthen this 
nation and its allies. Conversely they invari-
ably support almost anything which favors 
our enemies. ? 
You don't have to ask who those enemies 
are. They have announced their enmity often 
enough, and proven it often enough. They 
have proclaimed us as the only fly in their 
omelet and they are sworn to get us out of 
their way: 
Contrary to what many of my readers seem 
to think?and apparently I have to keep sav-
ing this again and again?I am not opposed 
to Communism or any other dictatorship 
someplace else. The government of another 
country IS its own business. I am simply op-
posed to any re7ime which keeps -interfering 
with our way of life or that of our friends. 
Some of our friends, of course, have non-
'Communist military dictatorships. It is typi-
cal that these are invariably the major tar-
gets of those who?for want of a better 
word?I can only call our leftist-liberals. 
You never hear these people refer to Com-
munist regimes as military dictatorships. an 
exact description.. Instead they regard the 
Red regimes as part asf some kind of Ideal-
istic social experiment which only reaction-
ary' numbskulls can view with alarm. 
Be nice to the Communists, the Fulbrights 
say. Keep smiling and holding out a friendly 
hand in spite of all the insults, threats and 
outright aggressions. On the other hand, they

Washington?The deadlock 
between Senate and House con-

Radio Free 'Europe and Radio

and the Soviet Union failed

will have to shut down are 
Increasing. 
In the words of Senator

Senator Fulbright throws in 
the cost of the stations (about 
$36 million a year) as well as 
the history of their secret fi-

argument for closure. 
More important, however, is

the administration of justice would be more

could be gathered on a national scale which

to require maintenance by rail and water

subject to parts I and III of the Act. In

AND RADIO 
DETENTE 
Mr. PEARSON. Mr. President, I ob-
serve that time is running out for the 
two "Radios" which constitute the best 
link available between the West and the 
peoples of Eastern Europe and the Soviet 
Union. 
The operation of Radio Free Europe 
and Radio Liberty are an essential in-
gredient to meaningful detente in East-
ern Europe. These radios reach out to the 
peoples of the put down nations of the 
Ea.st. They give them information about 
developments which are likely to affect 
their lives. All too often these peoples are 
denied such news by the censorship of 
their totalitarian Communist govern-
ments. 
It is conceded that these radios are not 
cherished by the states of Eastern Europe 
or the Soviet Union. However, the fact 
that these governments do object to the 
broadcasts, and that the broadcasts have 
a regular audience of 30 million in East-
ern Europe alone, suggests the extent of 
their appeal. 
The Eastern European nations have 
resorted to expensive measures to stop 
the broadcasts of the radios. They have 
jammed them, at huge cost and have even 
attempted retribution. With the West 
German Government's recent initiatives 
or "Ostpolitik" there arose a chorus of 
Eastern European governmental de-
mands for the demise of Radio Free Eu-
rope. But the Germans have held firm. 
They recognize that these radios are not 
at all injurious to detente but, in fact, 
serve to promote it. 
The opponents of RFE and RL have 
questioned their effectiveness by suggest-
ing ? that they cannot get support for 
their operations from NATO power gov-
ernments. Let me point out that these 
governments have their own radios which 
are intended to serve their national in-
terests quite specifically. The peoples of 
Eastern Europe know this. The character 
of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty 
would be quite changed and its credibil-
ity to the Eastern Europeans diminished 
if its funding were to fall to govern-
ments whose historic relations with the 
East may be less than fondly remem-
bered. The nonofficial funding from the 
United States, plus the Radios'. several 
decades of objective reporting, have re-
sulted in their remarkably great credi-
bility and widespread use among the 
peoples of Eastern Europe and Russia. 
Several Senators have raised objections 
to the fact that the Radios have received 
funding through the Central Intelligence 
Agency. I do not believe that such fund- . 
ing has forever tainted these Radios. 
Strong evidence would suggest that the 
audiences in Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet Union continue to evaluate the 
broadcasts they receive on the basis of 
content alone. They have continued to 
listen to the Radios and have?in a num-
ber of cases?sent messages of distress 
at the prospect of their termination. 
I believe that it would be a squalid 
breach of faith for the Congress of the 
United States to deny millions of East-
ern European and Russian listeners their 
sole source of uncensored information 
about the world they live in. This blow, 
in my opinion, would adverse:1y affect the 
diplomatic moves now being undertaken 
by our President with regard to the So-
viet Union. 
Detente, if it comes, will be the widen-
ing of the West's contacts with the East. 
Surely, it does not imply that we must aid 
the totalitarian governments of the Com-
munist nations in their intent to keep 
their peoples sealed off from the West. 
Detente must lead to the exchange of 
words and ideas, and of goods and peo-
ples. And this I submit is the essential 
business of Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty. 
The atmosphere between East and 
West today does not require us to demon- . 
strate our willingness to talk. We are ' 
ready. The Russians are ready. Discus-
sions at the highest level are scheduled . 
for mid-May in Moscow. Any idea that 
we should allow Radio Free Europe or 
Radio Liberty to cease broadcasting now 
is gratuitous. It would be without reward 
for improved East-West relations. 
I urge the Senate to call for an end to 
the deadlock of ?the conference connult-
tee and pass a bill which will fund these 
excellent Radios for the duration of this 
fiscal year and for a second fiscal year 
as well. I applaud the fact that we have 
terminated their funding from CIA, but 
I cannot approve their demise. It would 
be my hope, Mr. President, that the Sen-
ate will exhibit file leadership appropri-
ate to save these Radios from an un-
timely death by neglect. 
ABUSE OF ELECTION CAMPAIGN 
FUNDS 
Mr. FANNIN. Mr. President, the Fed-
eral Election Campaign Act. of 1971 is 
one of the most dismal pieces of legisla-
tion enacted by Congress. It was sup-
posed to provide campaign reform, 
stead, it will encourage the continuation 
of the greatest campaign abuse in our 
Nation. 
. Labor unions will continue to exact 
funds from their members, and these 
funds will be allocated by the union lead-
ers to the candidates of their choice. We 
have not taken a step forward in reform-
ing our campaign system; we ha,,e 
slipped backward. 
Mr. President, this fact was brought 
sharply into focus in a column by Victor 
Riesel.. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. 
Riesel's column, published in the Arizona 
Republic February 18, 1972, be printed

it hasn't as yet been resubmitted. If an ex-
tension petition is filed by a car company, 
EPA has 60 clays in which to make a de-
cision. Administrator Ruckelshaus has indi-
Gated that any petition would be made 
available to the public for open hearings. He 
did indicate, however, that EPA was giving 
some consideration to amending the peti-
tion's disclosure policy in order to provide 
full public disclosure and yet guarantee the 
protection of certain trade secrets. 
On January 1, 1972, the National Academy 
of Sciences filed its first semi-annual report 
on which EPA will base its decision on the 
technological feasibility of the car compan-
ies to meet the 1975 deadline. The report said 
that while "there is no centainty today that 
any 1975 model year vehicles will meet the 
requirements of the Act", it may be possible 
if three conditions are met: 1. provisions are 
made for catalyst replacement, 2. averaging 
of emissions throughout the day rather than 
Just for the first trip, and 3. general avail-
ability of non-leaded gasoline. 
Besides Rep. Rogers' suggestion for the 
catalyst problem, the other two National 
Academy of Sciences' conditions may also see 
early solutions. Changes in the EPA testing 
procedure, beginning with 1975, will encom-
pass the average of the emissions from all 
the trips taken in a day rather than just the 
emissions from the first trip (The first four 
to six running minutes emit the greatest 
amount of pollutants.). EPA officials feel 
that this change will "more accurately re-
fleet the driving experience of the average 
motor vehicle in major urban areas." 
.? In addition, the oil industry will appar-
ently have little or no trouble making non-
leaded gasoline generally available for use 
by 1971. Although presently available in lim-
ited quantities, there has been some .ques-
tion whether it could be produced on a mass 
basis. When questioned during the hearings 
about whether the oil industry can get the 
lead out within the deadline period (the 
experimental converters work only on nn-
leaded gas) an American Petroleum Insti-
tute spokesman said "No question about it." 
"The bill means changes, and that's what 
we're doing is changing," he added. 
Am CLEANUP 
WASHINGTON, February 17 (UPI) .?De-
spite erovernment promises to enforce a 1975 
clean-air deadline, at least 18 states have 
requested two-year postponements and ap-
pear likely to get them. 
In applications made to the Environmental 
Protection Agency, most of the states in-
volved, said that urban areas could not meet 
the standards without limiting downtown 
traffic. They indicated a reluctance to im-
pose such traffic controls. 
a When EPA Administrator William D. 
Ruckelshatts announced the air quality 
standards April 30, he emphasized that many 
cities would have to curb traffic. 
"I don't anticipate any delay in their im-
plementation," Ruckeishaus said of the 
standards. 
But in an interview yesterday, the EPA 
official in charge of reviewing state applica-
tions said that the agency probably would 
forgo the deadline rather than force traffic 
'restrictions that might be unpopular with 
commuters. 
"If you need traffic control you probably 
can get a two-year extension," said B. J. 
Stelgerwald, director of the EPA's stationary 
source pollution control program. 
? "Traffic control isn't easily imposed," 
Steigerwaid said. He said that cities would 
need mass transit to replace automobiles. 
"You just don't install mass transit in three 
years," he said. 
Experts from the EPA and other agencies 
have estimated that car exhaust causes at 
least 50 per cent of air pollution, the most 
harmful concentrations being in downtown 
areas. 
Richard E. Ayres, who has studied the state 
plans for the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, a private environmental group, said 
that any delay in curbing urban auto pollu-
tion would undermine- the entire air clean-
up program. 
"What they're saying is that they'll meet 
the standards where there isn't any pollution 
and delay them where the problem is most 
severe," Ayres said. 
Many states said that if given until mid-
1977, the car-pollution problem largely would 
go away because of progressively stricter fed-
eral requirements for exhaust clean-up de-
vices on new cars. 
The first such devices were installed on 
1968 models. Under the same Clean 'Air Act, 
which mandated the 1975 air clean-up stand-
ards, 1975 model cars must cut carbon mon-
oxide and hydrocarbon emission by 90 per 
cent, compared with 1970 models, and 1976 
cars must reduce nitrogen oxide emissions 
90 per cent, too. 
Although the law allows a one-year exten-
sion of these standards if car-makers can-
not meet them, and although all four U.S. 
car companies have requested such a delay, 
the EPA permitted states to. presume in 
drawing up their plans that the 1975 and 
1976 auto deadlines would be met. - 
Steigerwald indicated that he was using 
the sante presumption in reviewing state ap-
plications. 
"By 1977, car emission limits will allow 
many cities to meet the air standards," 
Steigerwald said. "Does it make sense for us 
to demand significant traffic controls by 1975 
when two years later they could meet the 
standards without traffic controls?" 
However, Stei,e,,erwald said, "About 15 cities 
won't meet the standards even in 1077 with-
out traffic controls." He did not name all the 
cities but said that they included New York, 
Chicago and Los Angeles. 
The law required each state to give EPA 
by Jan. 30 its plan for meeting limits on six 
air pollutants?sulfur oxides, particulate 
matter, carbon monoxide, photochemical 
oxidants, nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons. 
The EPA must approve or disapprove the 
plans by May 30. The law says the limits 
must be met by July 1, 1975, unless EPA 
grants the state a two-year extension. 
no one in Washington has read them all. 
The plans are hundreds of pages long an   
United Press International compiled the list 
of 18 states seeking extensions from EPA 
sources and from reporters in state capitols. 
Most to the 18 sought no over-all exten-
sions, but rather a two-year delay in meet-
ing standards for carbon monoxide and hy-
drocarbons?which come mostly from cars?
in urban areas. 
Steigerwald said that about 15 states did 
promise to work on some form of traffic con-
trols?reduced parking space, higher bridge 
tolls, inspections, mandatory installation of 
antipollution devices on older cars?but few 
included them as firm parts of an enforce-
ment program.

DEAR CONGRESSMAN GUDE: I have written 
many letters to you, over the years, that 
could be onsidered critical in the sense that 
they expressed my frustration about what 
our government has done in Vietnam. 
Because?the President's trip to China is 
a day for hope, I wish to express words of 
favor for the present Administration and 
party in power which I do support from time 
to time, as follows: 
1. I believe the President is trying (at some 
risk) by this China effort to find an end to 
a war which in all fairness we should admit 
he does not bear the major responsibility 
for. 
2. I believe he understands the domestic 
needs of the American economy should now 
have top priority over do gooding abroad, and 
that he will act to help to restore the world 
leadership we once enjoyed as the most capa-
ble country in the production of goods and 
services, here at home. 
There are, of course, a lot of things hap-
pening in the government which I do not 
agree with, political and otherwise, and I am 
sometimes concerned that our very form of 
government is under severe test. 
I do want the President to succeed and I 
want you gentlemen to succeed in the sincere 
efforts you are demonstrating. I choose this

Yours sincerely,

? To Keep Freedom Alive 
For nearly two decades, since the end of World 
War II, two radio systems based in Munich, West 
Germany, -financed chiefly by the United States, 
have daily beamed to persons behind the Iron Cur-
tain .fa:ctual news of the outside world unhindered 
by the censorsiqip of totalitarian, Communist 
regimes. 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty have staffs 
;totaling 2,600 persons, many of them refugees from 
Communist tyranny, who broadcast in the tongues 
of the listeners. Radio Free Europe beams its pro-
grams mainly to audiences in Hungary, Czechoslo-
vakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Poland. Radio Liberty 
.transmits in the various languages of the Soviet 
Union. 
That these stations have been effective in getting 
to oppressed peoples of the world uncensored mate-
rial is demonstrated by the constant pressure that 
has been applied on their operations by Communist 
governments. West Germany has repeatedly refused, 
as the Communists have sougit, to revoke the sta-
tion's authority to broadcast from German soil. 
Yet these voices of freedom and truth may be 
.stilled?not by Communist pressure?but by action 
of thd congress of the United States, more especial-
ly the Senate and in particular one senator, L Wil-
liam Fulbright, 'chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee. 
"These radios should be given an opportunity 
, to take their rightful place in the graveyard of Cold 
War relics," Senator Fulbright contends. 
At issue is an appropriation of 536 million needed 
annually to keep the stations in operation.. The ap-
propriation is supported by President Nixon and 
even by such liberal publications as the New York 
Times which says the broadcasts "have contributed 
enormously to enlarging the marketplace of ideas in 
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union." But Senator 
Fulbright argues that the administration is seeking 
to "keep this Cold War program on the books 
despite the fact that neither the American public 
nor the governments of Western Europe are willing 
to support such a continuation." . 
STATI NTL 
The senator seems to ignore some studies he him-
self authorized some time ago when he asked the 
Library of Congress for reports on the effectiveness 
of both. Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. Per-
haps those reports, prepared by knowledgeable goy- , 
ernment experts, were at odds with Fulbright's zeal 
to retire these "Cold War relics." 
"The reality of Radio Liberty," concluded the 
report on that facility, "conflicts with its popular 
image. It is neither a Cold War operation nor is its 
staff a group of cold warriors. On the countrary, 
Radio Liberty accepts all Soviet institutions, though 
not their ideology, and seeks to bring about peaceful 
democratic change from within." . 
The question that must be asked is this: If the 
congressional opposition results in the end of these 
broadcasts to Iron Curtain countries what then will 
the people in those nations hear? It is certain that , 
what they will hear is the -official" line of hard 
propaganda that the Communist-controlled media 
already bears. Ending the broadcasts would elimi-
nate, as the Communists want, any possibility of dis-
sent occuring because someone, who heard a voice 
of freedom, realized that the Communist system, .! 
with its harsh, unrelenting control, is net the best 
of all possible 1,S,orlds.

tern of fraud and deceit." 
Radio Free Europe was set up in 1949 
as a private, non-profit corporation 
which would beam news broadcasts be-
hind the Iron Curtain. The system, with 
news headquarters in Munich, has 32 
transmitters in West Germany and 
Spain. 
. Radio Liberty was added in 1951. Its 
broadcasts are directed 'exclusively to 
the Soviet Union, with around-the-clock 
programs in 17 dialects beamed from 
transmitters in Taiwan, Spain and West 
Germany. Munich also is the news head-
quarters for Radio Liberty. 
Both radio operations were promoted 
in the U.S. as a voluntary, non-govern-
ment effort to counter Communist 
propaganda about American life and. 
government aims. There were periodic 
appeals for donations to help support the 
broadcasts. 
. About a year ago, Congress learned 
that the broadcasts had been secretly 
financed with tax funds by the Central 
Intelligence Agency (CIA). The Nixon 
Administration, however, has yet to ad-
mit to Congress that the radio oper-
ations were a cover for CIA activities. 
After the disclosure of CIA in-
volvement, the White House tried to 
c'ounter congressional criticism with a 
bill setting up a tax-eicempt corporation 
to oversee the radio operations. The 
Administration proposed spending $40 
million a year. 
?Fulbright's committee turned it doWn. 
Instead, the committee agreed to fi-
nance the operations for one more year . 
at $35 million. The Senate passed the7 
measure on a voice vote in August. 
- In September the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee advanced a measure 
authorizing $74.5 million for two year 
while a special committee evaluated the 
need for continuing Radio Free Europe 
and Radio Liberty in addition to the i 
government-financed Voice of America ; 
broadcasts. That was agreeable to the 
House. Now the two houses must iron 
out thcir differences or let filo two 
broadcast operations die. 
The Voice of America maintains a 
world-wide programming schedule. in 36 
languages. About 40 per cent of its air 
time is beamed to communist-governed 
countries. For this, the taxpayers are 
spending $41 niillion this year. 
The AFL-CIO leaders adopted a reso-
lution saying, "The closing of these vital 
communications with the captive peo-
ples of the Soviet Union and Eastern 
Europe will be a clear sign of U.S. 
capitulation in the war to bring truth 
and courage to countless millions behind 
the Iron Curtain." 
We agree with Fulbright that truth 
already was compromised by the gov-
ernment's attempt to disguise its propa-
ganda broadcasts as a voluntary ven-
ture by American citizens. Fulbright 
suggested that the two radio operations 
should "take their rightful place in the 
graveyard of Cold War relics." We 
agree.

ous about theCIA.? 
Yet when Senator Fulbright asked for studies 
by the Library of Congress on the effectiveness of 
the two stations, he was set back on his heels. "The 
reality of Radio Liberty," the Library of Congress 
reported, "conflicts with its popular image. It is 
neither a cbld war operation, nor is its staff a

DAVID LAWRENCE 
And Then Comes the Moscow Trip 
, President Nixon has had the 
attention of the American peo-
-ple focused on him as they 
'keep up with his activities in 
Peking while he deals with the 
delicate problems of develop-
ing friendly relations with the 
government of mainland 
China. 
? Rarely has a miss.?anef this 
'type been attempted in an 
election year, but Nixon found 
It necessary to move at this 
time into a world situation 
that demands personal nego-
tiation. 
The trip to Red China apl? 
pears to be a success, but in a 
? few weeks the President will 
be taking another journey ? 
;to the capital of the Soviet 
.Union in the middle of May. 
He will undoubtedly make ev-
ery effort to convince the lead-
ers in the Kremlin that the 
:United States can work with 
them without letting differ-
:elites of viewpoint stand In 
the path of a "peaceful coex-
istence." 
The problems with the Sovi-
ets are different from those 
with which Nixon has been 
faced in Peking. The United 
States formally recognizes the 
Soviet government and has for 
years been carrying on discus-
sions about possible ways to 
,advance the cause of peace. 
? Some of the subjects that 
the president will take up in 
Moscow have been under con-
sideration for a long time. 
There is, for instance, at pres-
ent a continuing series of 
talks on the limitation of stra-
tegic arms, and this affects 
not just Russia and the United 
States but the entire world. 
If the Soviets show an indi-
cation that they are ready to 
go ahead on a program of lim-
iting or reducing . nuclear 
weapons, it will be a big step 
forward and will assure the 
peoples of both Europe and 
Asia that the chances of nu-
clear war are being diminish-
ed. 
Nixon is hopeful that the 
United States and the Soviet 
Union can enter into a new 
relationship one that is ded-
icated to the prevention of 
war, particularly nuclear war. 
If evidehce of this determina-
tion can be presented to the 
world convincingly, the confer-
ences between Nixon and the 
leaders in the Kremlin will be 
of transcendent importance. 
What is lacking Way is a 
close relationship between the 
American people and the peo-
ple of the Soviet Union. Cen-
sorship on the Russian side 
prevents their communicating 
with. each other. Congress at 
the moment is considering 
whether it will continue to fi-
nance the broadcasts in sever-
al languages which are daily 
transmitted by Radio Free Eu-
rope and Radio Libefty to the 
people of Eastern and Central 
Europe and of the Soviet Un-
ion. 
More information about the 
United States and its policies 
needs to be sent into these 
areas with the hope that a 
friendlier feeling will develop 
in future years. 
There are many ways in 
which the Russian people 
could become better known to 
the American people, and one 
of these is to permit more visi-
tors to travel freely through-
out the Soviet Union. An inter-
change of ideas between for-. 
eign tourists and residents 
tends eventually to generate a 
better understanding of world 
affairs on both sides. 
There is eery reason why 
the . United States should en-
deavor to develop a friendlier 
relationship with the govern-
ment in Moscow and the peo-
ple of the Soviet Union. 
If preventing wars is to be 
the objective and "peaceful 
coexistence" is to be the mot-
to, President Nixon could ap-
ply this doctrine at his visit 
with Premier Kosygin and oth-
er Soviet leaders. For the 
American people do not want 
war with any nation, antl they 
are anxious to see nuclear 
weapons limited if not entirely 
prohibited. The current talks 
on strategic arms with the So-
viet Union are supposed to 
cover such problems. 
President Nixon will be busy 
with his foreign tours almost. 
up to the national party con-
ventions in midsummer. For 
when he gets home, the piles 
of work to be done as a result 
of his journeys will occupy 
much of his time during 1972. 
He will be devoting his ener-
gies to the task of striving to 
make peace, and this is a tre-
mendous job in a world with 
so many small nations seeking 
to take advantage of one an-
other. The major powers will 
have to be the peacemakers. 
Actually, relations between 
the Soviets and the? Red 
Chinese have been increasing-
ly hostile in recent years, and 
Peking fears the further ex-
tension of Soviet influence into 
Asian countries. It would 
mean a great deal to Red Chi-
na . to feel that it has the back-
ing of the United States.

relic in the sense that it is now 
More than 25 years old. But the 
need has hardly changed. The So-
'viet occupation has not been with-
;drawn. The truth still serves a. 
purpose. 
The question arose this week 
because Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty were running out 
of funds. Private sources of sup-
port have never been sufficient. 
The U.S. government, through 
the C_eiltsal Intelligence Agency, 
has bFeri-Supporthe twon-Ch, 'r o

of R.elics 
Senator Fulbright, however, 
said the support should be 
dropped. He, called the stations 
"relics" to those bad old days of 
the cold war. In Senator Ful-
bright's private world, the Rus-
sian armies no longer have iron 
knuckles at the throat of the 
people in Poland, Czechosolvakia, 
East Germany, Hungary, Bul-
garia, Latvia, Lithuania and Es-
tonia. 
? 
Just how much information the 
people of those countries gain 
from Radio Free Europe is diffi-
cult to judge. The Soviet dictators 
and their Quislings do not allow 
the likes of George Gallup to 
roam around taking polls in most 
places. It is certain, however, that 
some people do listen to the radio 
broadcasts and find them useful. 
This has been reportea by both. 
travelers and the many who have 
migrated west. To those who still 
daily risk their lives to escape a 
prison existence, the cold war is 
no relic. ? 
? 
Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty may not be perfect, but 
they are among the few media to 
combat the endless propaganda of 
the controlled press of Eastern 
Europe. It is hoped that Congress: 
will vote the rather modest sum 
to continue the broadcasts. 
One can agree with Senator 
Fulbright that there are those rel-
ics which should be retired. But 
that is a matter for the voters of t 
Arkansas to decide.

The Siege of Raclili Free Europe 
Sen: J. William Fulbright (D-Ark.) made a laud-
able, highly pertinent speech a few years ago urg-
ing the American people to outgrow the cliches of 
the cold war?to distinguish between "old myths 
and new realities." It was good advice. 
Unfortunately, in his efforts to kill off Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty, the influential chair-
man of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is ? 
showing a certain confusion between myth and 
reality himself. 
For more than 20 years Radio Free Europe has 
been broadcasting to .the Communist countries of 
Eastern Europe. Its smaller sister operation, Radio 
Liberty, broadcasts to the Soviet Union in Russian 
and 16 other languages. In hours of broadcasting 
to These areas,. the two Munich-based stations are 
far more active than the Voice of America. 
? Now Fulbright wants to kill off RFE and Radio 
Liberty by blocking congressional authorization 
for the current fiscal year. Failing in that, he fa-
vors a Senate-passed bill which would extend the 
life of the stations only through June. 
We strongly urge, instead, that Senate conferees 
accept a House-passed bill which would authorize 
operations for two more years. During those two 
years, a 'study would be made to determine if the 
broadcasting operation should be continued?and 
if so, under what arrangement. 
Fulbright argues that RFE and Radio Liberty 
are "relics of the cold war" which have outlived 
their .usefulness in a day when the emphasis is on 
East-West efforts at detente. In this he is mistak-
en. 
There was a time, prior to the 1956 uprising in 
Hungary, when the Munich-based stations indeed 
exhibited a cold, war obsession. Nowadays, howev-
er, it is recognized that the Communist govern--
ments won't be overthrown by force. Any improve-
ment must come about thi?ough the slow process of 
internal liberalization. And to the degree that such 
liberalization occurs, there is a hope .that Commu-
nist foreign policy will mellow, too. . 
RFE and Radio Liberty encourage the liberaliza-
tion process by publicizing the doings and writings 
of dissident intellectuals and others in the Commu-
nist countries whose opinions would otherwise re-
main smothered by censorship. 
Shutting down RFE. and Radio Liberty would 
make Communist hard-liners?those who oppose 
both detente with the West and internal liberaliza-
tion?very happy. But it would be a discouraging 
development, indeed, to those who are striving, in 
the Czech phrase, the communism with a human 
face. 
It may be, of course, that substantial changes are 
needed in the way the stations are financed and 
managed. Direct European 'participation, for ex-
ample, is long overdue. And certainly government 
support in the future should be open, rather than 
half-hidden as it. was in the past. But these are 
matters which should properly be explored in. the 
study called for in the pending House bill. ,

MUNICH?If historians are kind, 
Sen. J. William Fulbright (D-Ark.) 
will .be honored as a powerful and 
effective advocate of better under-
standing among diverse peoples. 
The bitter great and small power ri-
valries of the post-World War II era 
have, at the very best, been amelio-
rated by the Fulbright Program, the 
greatest government-sponsored ex-
change of knowledge between citi-
zens of different nations in all histo-
ry.. . ? 
By the hundreds of thousands, 
Ameriean and foreign students have 
benefited from opportunities to 
learn more about other cultures Pro-
vided by Fulbright's vision, it is cer-
tain that the majority of Falbright 
Scholars would not have enjoyed 
such opportunities if they had to 
pay for themselves. It is impossible 
to state specifically how the great 
mass of humanity, the -cause of 
world peace or the interest of the 
United States have benefited. None-
theless, the senator felt with total 
justification that even the possibili-
ty of better underStanding? among 
peoples by exchange of information 
was worth whatever the cost. 
historians will. however, -require 
great understanding and forbear-
ancesif they are to give Fulbright 
the credit he amply. deserves?and 
to reconcile the old, liberal Ful-
bright with the pew, reactionary 
Fulbright. The junior senator from 
Arkansas is currently engaged in a 
one-man campaign to suppress two 
of the chief sources which provide 
the peoples of the Soviet Union and 
Eastern Europe with nonofficial in-
? formation and curb bureaucratic 
'tendencies toward .suppression. 
Against ?the consensns of Congress 
and in defiance of the conclusions of 
searching investigations. he himself 
? sponsored,' Fulbright is determined 
to destroy Radio Liberty and Radio 
Free Europe. 
Fulbright's vendetta, marked by a 
vitriolic denunciation last week, is 
difficult to understand. It contra-
venes his previously stated ideals. it 
contradicts his cOnstantly expressed 
desire for better relations between 
East and West?and a real, rather. 
BY ROBERT S. ELEGANT 
At best, one can conclude that 
Fulbright is badly informed. But, 
most distressingly, his rejection of 
the findings of two Library of Con-
gress investigating teams indica tes 
that he may not wish to be better in-
formed. Those teams heartily recom-
mended keeping the stations alive. 
? Both Radio Liberty and Radio 
Free Europe were created as weap-
ons of the?cold war, and both were 
largely financed through the Central 
Isst7e1ligence Agency. But,' as the 
senator knows, the passage of time 
alters all human institutions. pav-
ing moved with the times, the two 
:\lunich-based radio stations now 
play a role quite different from 
their original function. Rather than 
ihtensifing, international tension, 
they encourage liberalizafion and 
stimulate internal dialogs in the So-
viet Union and Eastern Europe. - 
In Romania. where a new cam-
paign of intellectual repression is 
under way, I recently found that R.:-
dio Free Europe broadcasts ---ws 
the ordinary citizen's chief source of 
nongovernmentI Information. Ro-
manians learn not only, of develop-
ments abroad, but even of internal 
events?cultural as well as political 
?from Radio Free Europe. Even 
Soviet diplomats comment privately 
on their- content. 
In Poland at the end of 1970, ship-
yard workers revolted and violence 
spread to students and other groups. 
Radio Free Europe monitors picked 
up reports from faint local stations' 
?and lin; gave the news not- only 
to the outside world, but to. Poland 
as well. Absolute proof is, naturally, 
impossible, but there is general 
agreement among divergent politi-
cal views that Radio Free Europe 
helped prevent a bloodbath and en-
couraged formation of the present, 
liberalized 1?,"arsaw - regime. Free 
.availability of- information can, as 
the senator says speaking of the 
_United States, produce great bene-
fits.-

two stations' programs impede East,

Sos;iet. Union?Lor any power?will 
be moved to make concessions if its 
negotiating partner offers unilateral 
concessions like abolishing Radio 
Liberty and Radio Free Europe. But 
his own experience in the Senate 
must have taught him that success-
ful negotiation results from mutual 
concessions, Even with the best of 
will, one-sided .concessions are likely 
to produce not reciprocal conces-
sions, -but the demand for further 
concessions. 
It would be tedious to cite all the 
misconceptions Fulbright has ex-
pressed. One wonders, for example, 
why he is now so insistent upon 
strictly government-to-government 
contacts while he was formerly the 
apostle of people-to-people contact. 
But one further argument absolute-
ly- demands comment. 
? 
Why, asks Fulbright, are- our 
Western European allies not inter-
ested in helping to finance the two 
stations? 
The answer is twofold. In the first 
place. no government?or individual 
?will offer to pay for something he 
gets for nothing. fit the second place, 
a committee of influential Western 
Europeans. alarmed by Fulbright's 
vendettzt. is now, talking seriously 
and concretely of contributing to the 
support of the stations. 
In Germany, the. authoritatiVe - 
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung re-
ported flatly that the Social-Demo-
cratic administration disagreed with 
Fulbright's assertions. Chancellor 
Willy Brandt's ostpolitik is spear--
heading efforts to improve East-
West relations. But Bonn feels, the 
newspaper declared, that the sta-
tions are not an obstacle to relaxa-
tion of international tension?and 
are by no means "superfluous." In 
Belgium, Joseph L u n s, for mer 
Dutch foreign minister and preSent 
secretary-general of NATO. last 
week expressed the grayest concern 
regarding growing suppression of 
information in the Soviet Union and

GAGGING RADIO FREE EUROPE 
,Broadcasts of Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty, which for years have been beaming 
news and analysis of world issues behind the 
Iron Curtain, are in acute danger of being si-
lenced. 
Bills of the Senate and House for federal sub-
sidy - of between $35 million and $38 million 
have been arbitrarily bottled up in conference 
committee. 
For two decades Moscow's jamming has 
failed to stop the programs, which send free 
world facts and interpretation of political, eco-
nomic and social problems into Russia and 
Eastern Europe. 
'Now one senator .and a few misguided con-
freres threaten to destroy these patently valua-
ble broadcasts. 
The congressional jammer is J. William 
Fulbright, who denigrates the programs as 
"a relic of the cold war." This is familiar, 
standard conduct for Fulbright in almost ev-
ery matter that tends to be against the Sovi-
et propaganda line. 
,The senator has used his weight as chairman 
Of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as 
well as devious maneuvering, to block adoption 
of the Administration's request for funds to 
continue these two radio stations. ' 
He declared yesterday the Senate would ac-
cept the House bill ? for permanent opera-
tion of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty 
"over my dead body." . 
Fulbright is willing to continue the two sta-
tions through June 30. No longer. He said in a 
Senate speech last week these broadc as t s 
l'should be liquidated." 
* * 
? It would be tragic and a body blow to demo-
cratic processes, if the Arkansas senator were 
to succeed in his plan to destroy two of the 
prime outlets informing peoples behind the Cur-
tain. 
Congressional sentiment is overwhelmingly 
for retaining the radio systems. But so far Ful-
bright, marplot of so many United States for-
eign policies, has effectively blocked the subsi-
dy legislation. 
Two key Senators can have a significant in-
fluence on whether Senator Fulbright succeeds. 
One is Democratic Sen. Frank Church of Ida-
ho, who opposes RFE but supports Radio Lib-
erty, which has had a great deal to say in be-
half of Soviet Jews. The other is Missouri Sen. 
Stuart Symington., 
Senator Symington has tended to agree 
with Fulbright in many policy areas. He is 
reported to "have an open mind" on the ra-
dio issue. 
The Globe-DemoCrat strongly urges Stuart 
Symington to use his considerable influence 
to support continuation of both Radio Free 
Europe and Radio Liberty on a permanent 
basis, with State Department support through 
federal funds. 
Failure to break the Fulbright jam in the 
conference committee would be a serious error 
in American policy, and a dismal blackout for 
millions in the USSR and its satellite European 
states ? people whose only knowledge of what. 
goes on ? in the world, especially in America, 
comes through these channels to which they 
tune surreptitiously but with eager. regularity. 
* * 
For years these two radio stations were sup-
posedly supported by wide public donation. Ac-
tually they were largely financed by the CIA's 
federal funds. This was a mistake, though the 
fact has been widely known since 1967. Now 
the Administration has asked open government 
subsidy. 
Both radio programs have done a good job 
in telling the United States story to people 
who could never krow it otherwise. The Li-
brary of Congress was asked to study the 
two radio operations and reported, back Jan. 
26 with warm praise and recommendation for 
continued federal financing. 
These reports have been largely seques-
tered, apparently by Fulbright, from other 
members of the conference committee. 
Congressional authorization under which the 
radios operate formally expired on Tuesday. It 
is understood RFE and RL have sufficient 
funds to continue another week or two. 
After that, unless the jam created by Senator 
Fulbright is broken, they will have no alterna-
tive but to stop. 
Thi g would be a graye misfortune for Ameri-
can diplomacy. It would be against public con-
-sensus and apparently the majority of ? Con-
gress. 
It is possible that vigorous support by Sena-
tor Symington can break the bottleneck and 
preserve Radio Free Europe and Radio Liber-
ty. This would be an act of competent judg-
.ment and statesmanship.

Crumbling Towers Of Babel 
Having failed to obtain a congressional ap-
propriation for Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty, the State Department apparently is 
, taking its. case to the people. 
r Words like "freedom" and "liberty" arouse 
emotions and the Executive Branch is quite 
capable of using them to get what cannot be 
had through a logical discourse. But we suspect 
there is little chance of success because this 
time at least Congress probably reflects popu-
lar sentiment regarding taxpayer-financed radio 
stations beaming propavula to East Europe 
and the Soviet Union. What's. more, the sta-
tions are simply incompatible with President 
Nixon's declared goal of bringing about "an 
era of negotiations." Senator Fulbright was 
correct when he called RFE and RL relics of 
the cold war. 
Still, John N. ,Irwin II, the Acting Secretary 
of State, claims that the propaganda outlets 
; "are a most useful enterprise . . . . bringing 
to individual citizens a responsible and real-
istic account of developments within their own 
spcieties and the world at large from an inde-
pendent outside source." The trouble is that 
the "outside source" is ?not independent, nor 
does it bring "a responsible and realistic ac-
count of developments." Radio Free Europe 
and Radio Liberty perform functions which do 
not lend themselves to handling by the Voice 
of America, the formal instrument of the State 
Department for propagating the American view-
point. In other words, the two other U.S. Gov-
ernment-operated stations do V.as dirty work. 
A few years ago the two?gitions 
distin-
guished themselves not by informing people 
In the "chained" world but by deeiving the 
American public. Omnipresent commercials 
i 
1 
? urged private donations for "private" stations:! 
Presidents Eisenhower, kemiedy and Johnson 
made annual appeals for donations without any 
. allusion to the fact that the stations were ac-
tually financed principally by the Central In-
telligence Agency. 
The CIA reportedly spent half a billion dol-
?, lars oTti5e stations until last summer when 
Congress approved an interim financing meas-
ure. The funding has now.. expired. No more 
public 1\money should be used to keep these 
r relics rtificially alive: If Congress can find 
any exc ss money, it should go for multi-lateral 
foreign aid projects. - .

-Fullbright reaches to swite 
By Lucia Mouat 
Staff correspondent of 
The Christian Science Monitor . 
Washington 
congress, which frequently complains 
about its limited powers, is on the verge of 
exercising those it has?to cut off this coun-
try's 20-year-old major communications 
Hi* with the people of Eastern Europe. 
Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, 
beamed to Eastern Europe and the Soviet 
Union respectively, have been hanging on 
by the thread of congressional emergency 
funding since fiscal 1972 began last summer. 
This week those funds ran dry. 
. Although both houses of Congress have 
passed authorization bills, a conference to 
resolve the differences has not yet been 
scheduled. 
?Sen. William J. Fulbright (D) of Arkansas, 
who time and again has urged that the 
radios be relegated to the "graveyard of 
cold-war relics" explains that Thomas E. 
Morgan (D) of Pennsylvania, chairman of 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee has 
been out of town. Others aver that Senator 
Fulbright, chief foe of continued operation 
of the radios,'is encouraging a filibuster of 
sorts for the specific purpose of letting the 
?funds run dry. One conference that was held 
Jan. 26 ended abortively. 
'No foot dragging' 
A House Foreign Affairs. Committee aide, 
who says Representative Morgan was in 
Washington last Wednesday and Thursday, 
says, "We're not dragging our feet?the 
House has been ready and anxious to go to 
conference any time Senator Fulbright (one 
of the five Senate conferees) says he would 
go." 
The State Department Tuesday issued an 
unusually lengthy supportive statement on 
the radios' behalf. Acting Secretary of State 
John N. Irwin said, "Their demise would 
be a great loss." 
During Questioning, Richard Davies, dep-
uty assistant secretary for Europe, respond-
ed to a question on radios effects on detente 
by saving. "We've never seen any indica-
tion that international radio broadcasting 
has hampered that development." 
Senator Fulbright, who as chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wields 
considerable influence over his colleagues, 
argues that the radios are propagandistic 
tools that have no place in a period of East-
West d?nte. 
Radio defenders, including the nation's 
.major newspapers, counter that the two 
operations have evolved away from propa-
ganda toward more sophisticated, accurate 
reporting of the news inside those countries 
where broadcasts are heard. Library of Con-
gress studies, requested by the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee and given little 
public circulation, attest to the change. They 
say Radio Liberty, for instance, is neither 
"a cold-war operation nor is its staff a group 
of cold warriors." 
Specialties discussed 
Unlike the Voice of America, which fea-
tures only United States news and, because 
of its direct government control, with a de-
cidedly favorable slant, the radios specialize 
in news and commentary on East European 
developments that listeners, with only cen-
sored material at their fingertips. might not 
otherwise know about. While Nikita S. 
Khrushchev's death, for instance, was not 
reported on Radio Moscow for close to 48 
hours after the event, Radio Liberty had a 
documentary on the air within hours. The 
audience is large-55 million for Radio Free 
Europe alone?and program. jamming con-
tinues vigorously. 
In the view of the Radio Liberty spokes-
man, the major flaw in Senator Fulbright's 
argument on d?nte is the assumption that 
the future of East-West relations will be 
decided by the governments involved inde-
pendently of public-opinion pressures on 
them. Not so, he says. 
While it may appear logical that since 
both branches of Congress have passed au-
thorization bills, a conference to find median 
ground should be held, some argue if the 
radios are to be killed anyway at some 
point, perhaps now is as good a moment 
as any. 
The Senate bill, less generous than the 
house two-year authorization, ? ensures sur-
vival only until June 30, when fiscal 1972 
comes to a close. At that point the Senate 
would have to come to grips with the whole 
issue once again.

'Freedom radio' victim of changing 
We, the people of the U.S.A., are 
'; undoing a lot of programs in foreign 
relations formerly considered bu'.;t 
to the system. 
? Red China, now known as the Peo-
ple's Republic of China (PRO), is by 
? President Nixon's Peking pronounce-
ment no longer expansionist in its 
,revolutionary ideals. For years our 
country has felt that the PRC spon-
sored and funded enclaves of subver-
sives in dozens of African and Latin 
nations. 
? If the PRC no longer follows an 
? imperialist course, then of course the 
old domino theory lacks validity. 
India, Japan and Indonesia, not to 
mention Thailand, Malaysia and the 
rest are safe. At least from the Chi-
nese. 
India isn't peace-loving anymore. 
It is militarist. The military dictator-
? . thip of Pakistan, now bereft of its 
? eastern dominion, is peace-loving or 
at least temporarily too preoccupied 
to worry about military ambitions. 
And now Congress is considering 
stopping fundt for Radio Free Europe 
and Radio Liberty, the powerful sta-
tions that fought the cold war by 
drumming U.S. views ? outside the 
policy confines of the U.S. LA. and 
the Voice of America- ? deep behind 
the Iron Curtain. 
Freedom radio stations irritated 
the Russians, Bulgarians, Czechs and 
East Germans no end. They broadcast 
mighty signals to jam western mes-
sages. Nevertheless, starved for infor-
mation from the outside, their people 
listened. The youth of Communist na-
tions learned of rock and roll, the Jef-
ferson Airplane and so forth from 
freedom radio, all subsidized by the/ 
CIA. ? 
' 
These stations represented what 
some Americans thought to be ideo-
logical warfare, ideas vs. ideas. Our 
ideas are better, of course, but we 
could never be sure just how these 
stations were phrasing American po-
litical conceptions. 
Fortner Vice President Hubert 
Humphrey, visiting Miami, is of a 
mind to let the stations expire. "Other 
countries thought we were interfering 
with their affairs," he said. "But if the 
stations just broadcast straight news, 
the information would be valuable to 
neorie denied complete news in their 
own media." 
It is a puzzlement. Should we go 
from something questionable in value 
to us to nothing at all, or try a differ-
ent tack without propagandizing 
other peoples? Would the CIA then 
pay for a straight news station? Isn't 
? 
foreign policies 
the Voice of America supposed to be 
disseminating reasonably dependable 
news reports, even when the news 
makes Uncle Sam appear a little shab-
by? 
One thing hasn't changed, though 
our policy makers never banked on 
the principle to. begin with: the real 
conflict among men does involve 
ideas, life principles, economic and re-
ligious theories. We never truly un-
derstood this In Vietnam and that's 
why we've fallen on our collective 
faces. Bullets alone don't convince 
people democracy can work for their 
well being. 
Neither should we peddle philoso-
phies through any agency ever con-
nected with or funded by the CIA be-
cause who would believe, even in 
America, in the integrity and purity of 
a news outlet dependent upon a secret 
security agency's support? 
Perhaps we are coming out of a 
long night a myth and superstition in 
foreign relations. Perhaps we are 
merely changing our dream scenarios. 
There is no indication in military bud-
geting that an -era of good feeling is 
upon us. Dismantling a couple of 
radio stations might be the only tangi-
ble sign we'll have for a while.

Samizdat, Ileany and the STAT I NTL 
During the past couple of years the capitalist press, 
especially the New York Times, has reported how Soviet 
poets, writers, and scientists have resorted to "samizdat" 
to get their words to the world. 
Via "samizdat" ? self-publishing ? the beleaguered 
intellectuals, through typewritten carbon copies, mimeo-
graph, hectograph or other primitive publishing means, 
have bared their tortured souls, and have appealed to the 
conscience of the world for support, or so the Times 
.claimed. 
? We now have the Library of Congress to thank for re-
moving the-Veil from "samizdat." 
Dr. Joseph G. Whelan, head of the Library of Con-
gress' anti-Soviet operations, revealed last week that the 
"samizdat" business is a CIA operation. 
The Library of Congress has been an'unlikely source 
for truth about The socialist world, devoted as it is to anti-
Sovietism. . ' 
However, when Senator William Fulbright, chairman 
, of the Foreign Relations Committee, demanded that the 
U.S. quit funding Radio Liberty, a CIA operation in 
Munich, West Germany, Whelan complained that this 
would end the means of distributing "samizdat" in the 
Soviet Union. This '?movement will unquestionably re-
ceive a serious setback," Whelan said. 
. The alleged cry for freedom from "SOviet intel-
lectuals" is thus revealed to be, as long suspected, just a 
fink CIA operation. ? ? ? 
It shares this distinction with Radio Free -Europe, 
Radio Liberty, and the Assembly for Captive European 
Nations. ' . ? ? 
? All have been fed out of the U.S. Treasury to incite? 
subversion and rebellion against.socialism. 
George Meany's complaint last weekend that the 
ACEN's $250,000 a year payoff has been ended is one 
more token of the fact that his heart belongs to the CIA, as 
does his"foreign secretary," Jay Lovestone. 
Meany's spiritual and other relations to the CIA are 
of long standing. His opposition to the Soviet Union and-
socialism reflects his devotion to U.S. imperialism. That 
devotion accounts for his unconscionable support of the 
ravaging of Indochina by the U.S. 
Meany's devotion to U.S. imperiaiism is betrayal of 
the most elementiry interests of the U.S. workers, is 
enmity to the national liberation movement throughout 
the world. . ?

'Free Voices Speaking 
Unless the unexpected happens, Congress 
' today will let Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty die- of lack of funds. We believe that 
such an eventuality would be a painful and un-
? thinking blow against the dissemination of ideas 
and fact ? and against the human aspirations 
of millions .of Eastern Europeans and Russians. 
' The fiscal crisis is the product of a fit of ex-
cessive enthusiasm aboil-, -the spirit of detente 
with clmmunism and legislative manipulation 
largely deriving from the legislative-executive 
tug-of-war ? and of peace. 
'- The price tag is $36 million a year. Appropri-
ation bills have been passed by -both the House 
and the 'Senate. The measures differ substan-
tially; among other things, the Senate version is 
:for a one-year program and the House's is for 
two years. No conference is scheduled, and a 
temporary Continuation of funding runs out to-
night. , 
Without new funds, both organizations report, 
they will have to disband within no more than 
two weeks. 
The most effective enemy of the new funding 
effort has been Sen. J. William Fulbright, 
whose opposition was succinctly defined in a 
speech to the Senate last week: "These radios. 
should be given an opportunity to take their 
rightful place in the graveyard of cold war rel-
ics." 
Much of the popular support enjoyed by Sena-
tor Fulbright and others who share his distaste 
for the programs comes from the appalling fis-
cal history of the operations. Slightly more than 
a year ago, Sen. Clifford P. Case divulged that 
the preponderence of the radios' expenses for 
their more than 20-year history had been sup-
plied ? covertly by the Central  Tioualligence 
Agacd1e the American people and Con-
gress had been left with the impression that pri-
vate contributions had been carrying the bur-
? den. , ? 
The Nixon Administration backs a new pro-
, %. 
gram, incorporated in the House-passed bill, 
which would set up and fund a non-profit organ-
izaion independent of the government. Much of 
the virtue of the stations' effectiveness has been 
in the fact that their programinirig has not been 
tied to official American foreign policy, a de-
tachment which the House proposal would keep 
alive. Senator Fulbright managed to limit .the 
Senate's bill to a one-year appropriation which 
would put the stations under the control of the 
Secretary of State ? thus involving them di-
rectly in policy. 
For all the unforgivable impropriety and du-
plicity of the now-known CIA front operation, 
the stations have served, we believe, an enor-
mously important role. 
Both are headquartered in Munich. RFE. 
broadcasts in native languages to Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Rumania, 
and has a staff of about 1,600. Radio Liberty, 
with a staff of about 1,C00, broadcasts in Rus-
sian and other languages used in the Soviet 
Union. 4 
In? the aftermath of Senator Case's disclosure, ? 
Senator Fulbright asked scholars of the Library 
of Congress to evaluate the programs. To his 
surprise, the reports.were highly favorable; the 
Senator refused to release them. 
But a few days ago, the Radio Liberty report, 
by the Library's Soviet and Eastern Europe ex-
pert, Dr. Joseph G. Whelan, was 'published in 
the New York Times. 
In part, Dr. Whelan's study said: "The reality 
of Radio Liberty conflicts with its popular 
image. It is neither a cold war operation nor is 
its staff a group.of cold warriors. On the con- ? 
trary, Radio Liberty accepts all Soviet institu-
tions, though not its ideolgy, and seeks to bring 
about peaceful democratic change from within." 
In contrast to the impression which Senator ? 
Fulbright and other opponents seek to give, we 
believe the effect of 'such communication is to 
reduce the rigid polarization of people and poli-
cies in the Free World and the Soviet bloc. 
- -Gradually, but significantly, we have seen evi-
dence that awareness of the ideas of the outside 
world has encouraged intellectuals and others in 
communist countries to press, sometimes with 
startling effectiveness, for liberalization and re-
form. ?

Because Sen. J. W. Fulbright,

He has been blocking a House-
Senate agreement for current fund- . 
ing and has been maneuvering to 
eliminate funding for the upcoming

The chairman of the foreign pol-

support his own bias. Instead, the 
researchers gave the two stations, 
funded covertly by the CIA in pre-
vious years, not only an irra relfort 
but an A for effectiveness. 
For example, Dr. Whelan said 
silencing Radio Liberty would dry 
up an outlet for the underground 
writers in the Soviet Union and 
tune out a wave length that provid-
ed Soviet citizens with a "free 
press." 
"The liberalizing movement," 
he wrote, "will unquestionably re-
ceive a serious setback." 
Sen. Fulbright, who asserted 
these "relics of the cold war" t, 
should be discarded, hasn't been 
listening to his own sho4 wave re-
ceiver lately to cheek on what 
. American listeners can hear. 
The Senate's foreign policy com-
mittee should be relieved of legisla-
tive responsibility for these stations 
to avoid dismantling their carefully 
organized staffs. Then funds should 
be voted for fiscal 1972 too. 
The , stations are more in tune 
with the realities of the world than , 
the senator.

Radio Free Europe Still Has a Part to Play 
When American public?or political?opinion 
swings, it tends to swing hard, and this is likely 
to be more and more of a problem for the Nixon 
Administration as it trumpets its "breakthrough" 
in Peking this week and, presumably, further suc-
cesses in Moscow in May. No Matter what the true 
measure of the rapprochement achieved in either 
Communist capital, there will be a tendency on the 
part of some to exploit a "new era" in world re-
lationships as a reason for scuttling anything and 
everything that smacks of the dark, old Cold War 
days. A case in point is the effort now being con-
ducted in the Senate, largely by Senator Fulbright, 
to choke off appropriations for Radio Free Eu-
rope and Radio Liberty, which beam broadcasts into 
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, respectively, 
with the help of government funds. The CIA used 
to finance these broadcasts covertly and after this 
was brought inescapably to light two years ago, the 
government took over the burden openly, but on a 
temporary basis while debate continued about 
whether these operations should be continued, and 
In what form. 
With the question still unsettled, a continuing 
resolution authorizing temporary funding of RFE 
and RL expires today and the money will run out 
In a few weeks. This is just what Senator Fulbright 
thinks should happen, his point being that every-
thing is changing, 'what with Mr. Nixon's new ap-
proaches and new evidence of conciliation in China 
? 
and the Soviet Union, and that therefore RFE and. 
RL should "take their rightful place in the grave-
yard of Cold War relics." The Senator would have 
is believe, on the basis of White House briefings 
he has received about the President's policy, that 
broadcasts of this sort behind the Iron Curtain are 
contrary to the President's purposes in Peking and 
Moscow. 
The President, however, has not only never said 
as much, but has actually expressed quite the oppo-
site view; in a recent letter to Mr.,Stewart Cort, the 
chairman of a fund which seeks to raise private 
money to supplement RFE operations, Mr. Nixon 
said he thinks the free flow of information is "in-
dispensable" to more. normal relations between 
East and West. Given the nature of the service per-
formed by RFE and RL, it would seem to us that 
their programs fit the President's definition of what 
is still needed in Europe, for all the bright hopes 
of easing tensions and developing detente. For these 
are not provocative, propagandistic diatribes and 
still less do they "sell" America, U.S.I.A.-style. 
Rather, what both stations attempt to do is tell the 
people of Eastern Europe and Russia news about 
themselves and their own countries which their 
governments don't want them to hear. They do this 
job professionally, responsibly, and effectively, by 
almost all accounts, and the only real question for 
Congress, in our view, is how RFE and RL should 
be set up in a more permanent way so that they 
can go on doing it.

Saving Free Voices' 
For a generation now, Radio Free Europe and Radio 
Liberty have contributed enormously to enlarging the 
market place of ideas in Eastern Europe and the Soviet 
TheiCtransmissions have made available to those 
countries factual news of the outside World that the 
governments involved would have preferred their 'sub-
jects did not know. In addition, these stations have broad-
Cast the writings of such dissidents as Nobel Prize-winner 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, whose masterly novels and sto-
ries are prohibited in the Soviet bloc. A Library of Con-
gress study of these stations, made at the request of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has paid high trib-
ute to these organizations' contributions toward liberal-
ization of the Soviet world. 
, But now both these stations are threatened with extinc-
tion tomorrow unless House and Senate conferees end a 
Congressional stalemate. This situation arose because 
each chamber voted a different bill authorizing the con-
tinuation of these broadcasts. 
If the deadlock kills Radio Free Europe and Radio 
:Liberty, the chief gainers will be the Soviet bloc's hard-
liners who hate the two radio stations as allies of the 
liberal and progressive elements in the Communist world. 
Moreover, the demise of these broadcasts because of the 
inability of House and Senate conferees to agree would 
hardly project a flattering view of the American legisla-
tive system, nor would it add to American prestige for 
Europeans to see an important political question decided 
by a mere technic'al stratagem. 
We believe the work of these two stations has a lasting 
validity and importance, but even those of a different 
view must realize that the existence of these organiza-
tions provides potential bargaining counters for President 
,?Nixon's Moscow visit next May. At the least, all con-
cerned should be able to agree that a final decision on 
the future of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty can-
not  
be made until Mr. Nixon has returned from the Krem-
lin, and Congress can take a hard look at the post-Moscow 
'.situation of. American foreign policy.

' secretly financed for more than 
'j 20 years by the Central Intern-

and are struggling desperately 
to stay alive. 
IIf Senator J. V.T. Fulbright,

: "These radios should be given 
an opportunity to take their 
rightful place in the graveyard 
of cold war relics," Mr. Ful-
bright,-the chairman, of the For-

the Senate on Thursday. 
Future Seems Bleak 
But even if a compromise is 
reached in Congress to provide 
additional funds at least through 
the end of the current. fiscal 
year, which ends June 30, the 
future of the organizations 
seems bleak, even to their most 
ardent supporters. 
Through the years the C.I.A 
provided about a half billion 
dollars to the two stations, 
which broadcast to the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe. 
Radio Free Europe, with 1,600 
employes, was founded in 1930. 
It broadcasts in native languages 
to Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary, Poland and Rumania. 
Radio Liberty, with about 1,000

cult to generate enthusia 
appropriations of $36-million 
annually in an era when the 
focus is on negotiation and not 
dispute with the Russians. Ex-
cept for Mr. Scott, few Senators 
have spoken in favor of the 
stations. ? 
Senator Fulbright said that 
the Administration was seeking 
to keep "this old cold war pro-
gram on the books despite the 
fact that neither the American 
public nor the governments of 
Western Europe are willing to 
support such a continuation." 
Fulbright Questions Sincerity 
He said that continuation of 
the two agencies raised doubts 
about the sincerity of Mr. 
Nixon's desire to negotiate and 
improve relations with Cern-! 
munist countries. 
"I for one, and some of my 
colleagues," Mr. Fulbright said, 
"have not been willing to give 
it a new lease on life. I hope 
it will come to an end; I feel 
it should come to an end?
it should be liquidated?if an 
authorization ? is not enacted." 
He indicated that he would 
oppose another continuing res-
olution to finance the sta-
tions pending legislation. The 
two radio stations have been 
operating under such a continu, 
ing resolution, which expires 
Tuesday night. 
Both stations have said that 
they culd pay their expenses 
for a week or two, but would 
have to cease operations if 
Congressional authorization 
was not forthcoming by' the 
end of the month. Congress al-
ready has passed an appropria-
tion bill providing funds until 
June 30, but it was passed 
contingent on approval of an 
authorization bill. 
Mr. Fulbright had earlier 
asked for studies by the Libra-
ry of Congress on the effect-
iveness of the two stations. He 
had hoped that those reports 
would bear out his contention 
that the stations should be dis-
banded. But the reports, made 
available Friday to The New 
York Times by the Foreign Re-
lations Committte, strongly 
supported the stations. 
Basic Policy Shift 
The report on Radio Liberty, 
written by Dr. Joseph G. 
Whelan, a specialist in Soviet 
and East European affairs, said 
that the station's basic policy 
had shifted from its early "lib. 
eration" of the Soviet Union' 
to "liberalization" as conditions 
eased within Soviet society. , 
"The professionalism of the 
staff," the report said, "is ap-
parent in the quality of their 
research product, their multi-
lingual facility, the unique com-
bination of American and West-
e.rOMIROP80-016011k001100070001.-5 
a en s 
zens, and finally the existence 
of an organizational spirit that 
'seems to arise from a convic-
tion of participating' in creating 
positive change in the Soviet, 
Union."

contrary, Radio Liberty ac-

Mr. Whelan said that if Radio 
'Liberty was, disbanded, the 
Soviet people "will have lost 
a free press for the inflow of 
information" that could not be 
duplicated by officially spon-
sored government radios. He 
said it would also bring the 
loss of a means of diSsemina-
tion of "samizdat," or under-
ground writings, throughout the 
Soviet Union "with the conse-
quences that this ? liberalizing 
movement will unquestionably 
receive a serious setback." 
Similar praise for Radio Free 
Europe was expressed by James 
R. Price in his Library of Con-
gress report. 
A General Accounting Office 
mem d to ?the Foreign Relations 
Committee disclosed that Radios 
Free Europe had received Gov-
ernment grants of $306*,890,469

Fulbright the Jammer 
,THE INEXORABLE cam-
paign of Sen. J. W. Ful-
bright to cast U.S. foreign 
policy in his own image has 
almost strangled the broad-
'casts beamed into Commu-
nist Eastern Europe by 
Radio Free Europe and 
Radio Liberty. 
' Operating from his power 
base as chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, Fulbright is 
within days of cutting off, at 
least temporarily, vital U.S. 
government subsidies for 
the two programs. Unless 
Congress acts before next 
'Tuesday, Feb. 22; the money 
stops. 
' Congressional sentiment 
for the broadcasts is so over-
-.Whelming that it seems im-
probable Fulbright will ulti-
mately succeed. But he has 
come perilously close to 
doing what two decades of 
Moscow's electronic jam-
ming could not do: End non-
governmeatal communica-
tions between the United 
States and some 200 million 
residents of the Soviet 
%Union and 100 million in 
five other Communist coun-
tries. 
BUT THE TWO programs, 
ostensibly financed with in-
dividual American contribu-
tions, have been secretly 
/ subsidized by the Central 
Intelligence Agency. Even 
after this Was disclosed in 
1967, the Johnson adminis-
tration and then the Nixon 
administration dawdled 
about changing this clumsy 
arra .?ment. 
a year ago, Sen. 
Clifford Case of New Jersey 
forced action by demanding 
an end to the CIA subsidy. 
Belatedly, ? the administra-
tion proposed overt govern-
ment financing. Since then, 
Fulbright has - doggedly 
slowed down legislation. For 
instance, last summer he 
urged delay until the Li-
brary of Congress Congres-
sional Research Service 
could' study whether "it is in 
the public interest to pro-
vide additional tax dollars 
for the two radios." 
Despite F'ulbright.'s ef-
forts, the Senate and House 
by the end of November had 
passed separate bills financ-
ing the programs (at be-
tween $35 million and S38 
million a year.) But a Jan. 
26 Senate-House conference 
to resolve the two bills?its 
first and only session?met 
icy opposition from Ful-
bright. 
By Jan. 26, the Library of 
Congress draft reports were 
available. Fulbright was not 
pleased. They warmly 
praised the two programs 
and recommended -contin-? 
. ? 
ued U.S. financing. Ful-
bright's staffers asked the 
Library of Congress re-
searchers to rework their 
papers. Meanwhile, other 
members of the Senate-
House conference were una-
ware of the favorable re-
ports. 
THOSE VOLUMINOUS 
reports explain precisely 
why Eastern Europe experts 
are concerned by Ful-
bright's action. Radio Free 
Europe, -? says one report, 
"contributes substantially to 
preserve, the reservior of 
good' will toward the U.S." 
by the Eastern Europeans. 
"In some cases, regimes 
have grudgingly adopted 
some features desired by 
their publics and supported 
by Radio Free Europe." 
The other Library of 
Congress report suggests 
"Radio Liberty encourages 
detente, amelioratio'n of in-
ternational differences 
through negotiations, 
strengthening of the United 
Nations as an instrument of 
peace and creation of a 
world system based on the 
rule of law." 
But both reports agree (in 
language eagerly underlined 
by Fulbright's staffers) that 
the broadcasts are deeply 
resented by the Communist 
governments concerned. To 
.? 
Fulbright and his allies, 
East-West detente is a mat-
ter for government-to-gov-
ernment negotiation, not for 
a non-government informa-
tion service direct to East-
ern Europe's masses. 
ACCORDINGLY, if the 
programs are continued, 
Fulbright wants them under 
tight State Departnient reg-
ulation (though this is criti-
cized in the Library of Con-
gress reports). But he would 
really prefer their death. A 
compromise proposed by. 
House and Senate staffers, 
putting the two programs 
provisionally under State 
Department control,. has 
been ignored by Fulbright. 
Whether Fulbright can 
kill the broadcasts may de-
pend on the two other Sen-
ate Democratic conferees: 
Frank Church of Idaho and 
Stuart Symington of Mis-
souri. Church is adamant 
against Radio Free Europe 
but friendly toward Radio 
Liberty (because, mainly, of 
its concern for Soviet Jews). 
Symington tends to agree 
with Fulbright but adds he 
has an open mind. Neither, 
however, was informed 
about or has been aware of 
the favorable Library of 
Congress reports. Chairman 
Fulbright the jammer has 
seen to that.

I should like to call your attention to a similar

Liberty, which Senator Fulbright has criticized much as 
Rep. Passman has done with the Peace Corps. 
The odds at present appear very high that Sen.

favorable reports on their operations by the Library of

the senator requested in the hope of obtaining material 
to discredit them.

\ By Murrey Marder ? 
NOTHING CAPTURES the attention of again. But he is beyond the Committee's of-
federal -policy makers so quickly 'as laying a 
hand on their supply of money. So when the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee began 
hearings recently for the first time on the 
State Department's budget there was conSid-
,erable interest in the government and in the 
'press. 
' To 'strike sustained sparks of headlines in 
a congressional inquiry, however, there must 
be at leaSt two adversaries to rub together. 
?At the end of the first morning's hearing, 
therefore, when affable Secretary of State 
William P. Rogers finished an untrying ap-
'pearance in which he displayed no desiCJ-fo-
quarrel with 'anyone, especially presidential 
-adviser Henry A. Kissinger, most of the 
broadcasters, cameramen and writing press 
packed up and left. 
1 There Were glum looks around the State 
/Department where morale is decaying even 
'faster'thari Usual since the President's China 
inission underscored so publicly what has 
' ? long been so evident: that the most dramatic 
foreign policy ventutes will continue to be 
TUri -i3tri of the White House through the Kis-
. 
singer apparatus, and that Rogers, in a Harry 
'Truman phrase, will "not fuss" over it? at 
least not publicly and visibly. 
" Rogers, in a recent press conference and 
In the Senate hearing, was consistent in 
his insistence that he does not feel excluded 
from anything, that "the system is working 
Very well," that "the foreign policy is very 
effective," and that in any event it is Presi-
dent Nixon, not Kissinger nor Rogers, who 
'makes foreign policy." 
Even though Rogers may be, as he said, 
"perfectlY satisfied" with his r9le, the For-
eign Relations Committee chaired by Sen. J. 
William Fulbright (D-Ark.) is not. Fulbright 
and his fellow critics who have engaged in 
an intermittent struggle with two adminis-
trations over the shaping of foreign policy - 
have no personal quarrel with Rogers, a 
longtime friend of Fulbright's and other 
.committee members. 'However, they see 
their Own' power eroded by state's lack of 
combativeness in asserting its officially pro-
. claimed "primacy" in foreign affairs. 
co-0 
The nub of all this is that the Fulbright 
committee's functions are derived primarily 
from legislative jurisdiction over the State 
Department. As state's influence in the 
process shrinks, so does the committee's. It 
has watched the shrinkage with chagrin 
since President Nixon's decision in 1969 to 
put Rogers, one of his oldest friends, at the 
lop of State rather than an activist, ambi-
tious, foreign policy professional, and to 
keep full control of foreign policy initia-
tive t in the White House, with Kissinger as 
his conceptualizer, most-immediate adviser, 
director of a National Security Council staff 
that has grown greatly in size and power, 
and even, as it has developed, supreme se-
cret sesnivriogyemArsiwalo gpo*haps. ?

eign Relations Committee members at Ful- When Fulbright, midway in the Johnson 
bright's home and elsewhere?and plans to 
administration, turned rebel over the Do-
ficial reach, across the dividing line of "ex-
ecutive privilege" that presidents invoke to 
prevent advisers from testifying before Con-
gress. 
One unannounced purpose of the budget 
hearings was to explore whether Kissinger 
In his NSC capacity, might be drawn across 
the "executive privilege" divide to testify be-
fore Congress by reaching for him through 
the National Security Act of 1947 which set 
up the NSC. 
Fulbright asked Rogers, a former attorney 
general in the Eisenhower administration, if 
he believed Congress intended the National 
Security Council to assume the role it now 
has in foreign affairs. Rogers said he did, 
that the NSC was intended as "a forum for 
presenting different views," with the actual 
"decisions" made by the President. Ful-
bright, however, thinks that Kissinger's op-
eration has reached a scope never imagined 
by Congress. 
That issue was not pressed very sharply in 
the recent hearings, but it is being pursued 
more openly by the Federation of American 
Scientists, who nOte that some presidential 
advisers who wear several functional hats do 
testify before Congress in capacities apart 
from their confidential relationships with 
the President. 
What the Fulbright committee focused on 
'most in two succeeding days were State De-
partment budget statistics. But there was an 
underlying motive there too. For the same 
reasons that its influence is linked to the 
State Department's power, the committee is 
hardly likely to use a meat-axe on State's 
$563 million budget for 1973. It would be 
skinning its own interests. 
Until this month, the Foreign Relations 
Committee never held authorization hear-
ings on a State Department budget, not even 
in the so-called "great days" of the post-
World War II era, when Republican Arthur 
Vandenberg of Michigan and Democrat Tom' 
Connally of Texas teamed in bipartisan har-
mony with the Truman administration to re-
construct Western Europe, build NATO and 
"contain" the Soviet Union. Fulbright, then 
a young and enthusiastic supporter of that 
Establishment philosophy, has come full cir-
cle on most of its premises. 
The "great days" label was really a tribute 
to the Senate committee's acquiescence and 
cooperation with the Truman administra-
tion' S plunge into what Fulbright sees now 
as imperialism, rather than an accolade for 
the committee's independence or competi-
tiveness. The committee in those days was 
the junior partner of the Executive Branch, 
not a challenger. ? 
It was normal practice then for the Execu-
tive Branch to quietly provide drafts of com-
mittee members' speeches: even drafts' of 
committee reports. Vandenberg and Con-
nally, insistent on being privy to the "take-
off" of policy, were granted apparent co-pi-
c n erven on. an e ie nam wa: 
relations between the Executive Branch an 
. the Foreign Relations Committee. whic 
u- F lbright now has headed longer than an 
other Senator, spun into reverse. His con 
j mittee was treated as hostile; to borrow th 
euphemism that the Nixon aciministratio 
concocted in Indochina, the Executiv 
Branch's relations with the committee ofte 
amount to "protective reaction": each, cite, 
fires on the other preemptively, on the a: 
sumption it will be attacked. 
To compete in the foreign policy arena, th 
Fulbright committee has stretched its imag 
nation and resourcefulness. It has sent it 
own staff investigators abroad, spotlightin 
many U.S. involvements and commitment 
never acknowledged in official public rec 
ords; it has left a rebellious mark on man: 
pieces of legislation, notably on the conduc 
of the Indochina war, and the committei 
now has put before the Senate a major bil 
based on the work of Sen. Jacob K. Javit 
(R-N.Y.) and others, to curb the President' 
authority to use troops in war without con 
gressional authority.. 
? C4.9 ? 
The Nixon Doctrine's low posture, 'and tin 
opening to China, are directions in whicl 
Fulbright and his colleagues pointed loni 
ago; but they want to move much faster anc 
farther to wrap up the cold war and U.S. in 
volvement overseas. Last year, the commit 
tee hit on the device of attaching a rider tc 
the foreign aid act, requiring the approva 
of the Senate Foreign Relations and lious4 
Foreign Affairs committees of the annual 
budgets for State and the United States In 
formation Agency. These budgets previousl 
were subject only to clearance by appropria 
tions committees, unlike the budgets of De 
ferise-and many other departnients that reg 
ularly are examined in both ways. 
The first round of this new approach nom 
has been played out in the budget hear 
ings. One thing they showed was that most 
senators were surprisingly unLmiliar wit): 
routine day-to-day operations of the State 
Department or State's, relation-,hip to the 
complex NSC structure that Kissinger con. 
trols. The bulk of foreign policy is not high 
wire diplomacy, but increasingly, trade, aid 
economic rivalry, technology, legal disputes 
military weaponry, 'international confer. 
ences, and the like. 
In theory, through its examination of 
State's budget, the committee, as Fulbrighl 
expressed it, can "further the process of re 
storing' Congress' proper rule in the making 
of foreign policy." 
Fulbright's committee new has acquirce 
the capacity to influence the .priorities ol 
State's spending. But that budget is one ol 
the smallest in the federal government 
even in embassies overseas, State Depart 
ment employees represent only 16 per cenl 
of all embassy employees, with the remain. 
.der assigned by Defense, AID, CIA, or other 
agencies. 
Furthermore, budget work is tedious busi 
ness, and attendance of Senate Foreign Rela 
tions Committee members at hearings is al. 
ready woefully spotty. At this point, the 
committee' latest d arture in its' search 
ovel but unproved.

RE adventurous operations 
often bordering on the bizarre 
which the Central Intelligence 
Agency pursued in many parts 
of the world are usually 
ascribed to one man: Allen Dulles. 
They culminated in the abortive in-
vasion of Cuba in 1961. When Dulles 
departed from the directorship of CIA 
after the Bay of Pigs debacle, he 
certainly left an indelible stamp of his 
Influence as the architect of the mighty 
CIA edifice and its worldwide rami-
fications. 
The policy of his successors has, 
however, been no less forceful. CIA 
activities under its present director, 
Richard McGarrah Helms, may 
appear less aggressive because they are 
? being conducted with greater caution 
and less publicity, and because they 
have been adroitly adjusted to the 
changing climate in international poli-
tics. In the past CIA gained notoriety 
by promoting revolutions in Latin 
American banana republics, and sup-
porting anti-communist regimes in 
South-East Asia. Its operations in 
Africa were more skilfully camou-
flaged. For many years they had been 
on a limited scale because the CIA had 
relied on the British secret service to 
provide intelligence from an area 
where the British had unsurpassed ex-
perience and long-established sources 
of information. But with the emergence 
of the many African independent 
countries, the wave of "anti-colonial-
ist" emotions, and the growing in-
filtration of Africa by Soviet and 
Chinese "advisers", British influence 
declined. Washington forcefully 
stepped, through CIA, into the breach, 
with the avowed aim of containing 
communist expansion. 
? . 
Financial investments in new in-
dustrial and mining enterprises, and 
lavish economic aid to the emerging 
governments of the "underdeveloped" 
countries, paved the road for the influx 
or hundreds of CIA agents. Some com-
bined their intelligence assignments 
with genuine jobs as :technical, agri-
cultural and scientific advisers. 
? The British Government - parti-
cularly after the Labour Party, had 
come to power in 1964 - withdrew 
most of their SIS and MI5 officials 
from African capitals, though some 
remained, at

men began hurriedly to establish their 
"stations" in Accra, Lagos, Nairobi 
Kampala, Dar-es-Salaam, Lusaka, the 
"sensitive areas- in danger of slipping 
under communist svt ay. 
By the mid-1960s several senior CIA 
officials, such as Thomas J. Gunning 
and Edward Foy, both former U.S. 
Army Intelligence officers, were firmly 
established at Accra. They were later 
joined by William B. Edmondson, who

FBI agent before joining CIA and 
being employed at Addis Ababa, 
Nairobi, and Dar-es-Salaam, acquir-
ing fluency in Swahili. By 1965 the

active operators, distributing largesse 
among President Nkrumah's secret 
adversaries.
