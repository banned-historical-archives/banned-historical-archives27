 According to an announcement by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, the
 hijackers were remanded to the custody of the PLO and then taken to
 in the terms for their surrender.
 The terrorists surrendered to PLO authorities in Port Said, Egypt,
 yesterday, but                                one
 passenger-an American-was killed during the hijacking. Cairo
 reportedly guaranteed the terrorists passage out of the country
 Egyptian Foreign Minister Meguid said ;here were four hijackers, but
 their affiliation has not been confirmed.
 Comment: Syrian-backed PLO groups would have had strong
 motives for staging the attack. They want to discredit Arafat and
 derail the peace process and would have seen this as a particularly
 opportune time, given the scheduled meeting between British Foreign
 Secretary Howe and a joint PLO-Jordanian delegation next week.
 Arafat probably did not sanction or encourage this attack because
 Italy is the PLO's strongest West European supporter. Moreover,
 Arafat almost certainly would rather attack Israeli targets directly.
 in Tunis was unwarranted.
 Arafat has been able to capitalize on the incident to enhance his
 international stature by playing a mediating role in the hostages'
 release. He presumably hopes his efforts will help convince others-
 particularly Washington-that he peeks peace in the Middle East and
 will reinforce his contention that Israel's attack on PLO headquarters
 Egypt agreed to free the hijackers to end the incident quickly and
 avoid a replay of the violent, protracted TWA hijacking last July. The
 Egyptians also wanted an early settlement to avoid negative publicity
 that would hurt   PLO's international image and efforts for peace
 negotiations.
 Prime Minister Craxi, Foreign Minister Andreotti, and Defense
 Minister Spadolini reportedly disagreed on how to handle the
 situation. All three will be relieved that the ordeal has ended, but the
 decision to grant free passage to the hijackers will anger some
 elements of the governing coalition. Spadolini and his Republicans
 are likely to be particularly unhappy, and, during the parliamentary
 debate over the government's handling of the incident, Craxi may find

 JAPAN-CHINA:        Foreign Ministers' Talks
 In talks that begin today, Beijing will emphasize its commitment
 to good bilateral relations but will press visiting F9reian Minister
 Abe on trade and other bilateral economic issues.
 The Chinese have been expressing increasing irritation over Japan's
 large and growing trade surplus with China and have accused the
 Japanese of dumping and of exporting poor quality products. Deng
 Xiaoping last month lectured visiting Japanese businessmen on
 China's unwillingness to accept a long-term deficit,
 technology transfer and invest in more joint ventures.
 University students in Beijing and Xian last month seized on Prime
 Minister Nakasone's ceremonial visit in August to Japan's Yasukuni
 war memorial to protest an alleged Japanese economic invasion of
 China and resurgent militarism. A low-key media campaign preceding
 the student demonstrations gave renewed publicit       rit9pq
 committed during the Japanese invasion of China.
 Comment: The atmosphere in Sino-Japanese relations has soured
 considerably since Nakasone and Chinese Communist Party General
 Secretary Hu Yaobang exchanged visits over a year ago. Chinese
 reformers have been especially sensitive to the Sino-Japanese trade
 imbalance since the revelations last spring of China's large foreign
 exchange shortfall and the heated internal debate over management
 of the open-door policy. Nonetheless, both sides have overriding
 strategic and economic interests in maintaining solid bilateral
 relations and will work to limit difficulties. Beijing has curtailed anti-
 Japanese activity and is unlikely to withdraw its support for Japan's
 gradual military buildup.
 Abe probably will convey reassurances from Nakasone that his shrine
 visit does not reflect militaristic sympathies. On economic issues, the
 Japanese Foreign Minister will offer no significant new commitments.

 Comment: Cavaco Silva probably will become the next Prime
 Minister. His Social Democrats finished well ahead of the Socialists,
 the conservative Center Democrats, and the new left-of-center
 Democratic Reform Party, as well as the Communists. Apart from the
 Communists, who won only 37 seats, none of these rival parties is
 eager to accept blame for denying Cavaco Silva a chance to govern
 and for prolonging the political paralysis that followed the collapse of
 Nonetheless, the campaign caused unusually hard feelings among
 party leaders, and Cavaco Silva is unlikely to secure cooperation from
 the Center Democrats despite agreement with them on many issues.
 The other parties-especially the Democratic Reform Party-
 probably will impose tough restrictions on Cavaco Silva in return for
 permitting him to form a cabinet, and the new government is not likely
 to be more than a weak caretaker until a new parliamentary election
 after the presidential election in January.
 Soares almost certainly wants to turn his energies to his presidential
 candidacy and to disassociate himself from his now discredited
 administration. President Eanes, however, has final constitutional
 authority for appointing prime ministers, and he is likely to move
 slowly to sanction a new government, both because of his cautious,
 deliberate nature and because of his reluctance to help Soares-long
 a bitter opponent.

 Logistic personnel in the Lebanese Army are selling spare parts

 they have had to sell nonessential items on the open market to raise
 the US-made spare parts.

 for US-made wheeled or tracked vehicles, including the M-113 APC.

 recent years may also be involved. Iran would be a likely customer for

 BELGIUM: Terrorists Threaten To Disrupt Elections
 The Communist Combatant Cells terrorist group, in a communique
 following the 8 October bombing of a Brussels gas company building,
 announced its intention to disrupt next Sunday's parliamentary
 elections. Belgian police are taking the threat seriously and anticipate
 more attacks this week and on election day
 Comment: The group, which emerged In Belgium last October, has
 bombed two domestic political targets but has concentrated its
 attacks on NATO-related facilities. This new campaign suggests the
 terrorists are now focusing on domestic issues. Because of the
 group's limited capabilities, it probably could not conduct the kind of
 bombing campaign that could affect the coming elections.
 Egypt is considering the introduction of a resolution at the UN

 do not feel strongly about the proposal, but, if they do present it, they
 want it adopted by consensus. The Egyptian Ambassador to the UN
 Comment: The introduction of this resolution at the UN would again
 focus attention on contentious issues that arose in Geneva--some of
 which required arduous, last-minute negotiations to resolve. The
 decision on whether to offer the resolution will be vexing for Cairo.
 Egypt would welcome the opportunity to highlight the role of its
 Ambassador In the success of the NPT Review Conference but
 recognizes the possibility that failure to achieve consensus on such a
 resolution at the UN could undercut the results of the conference.

 SOUTH KOREA-JAPAN: Contacts Between Opposition Figures
 A meeting last week between South Korean opposition figure Kim
 Young Sam and Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Ishibashi has
 drawn fire from President Chun's ruling Democratic Justice Party.
 Party spokesmen have suggested that Kim's effort to promote ties
 between the opposition New Korea Democratic Party and the
 Socialists, who up until now have dealt exclusively with P'yongyang,
 may be unlawful. Kim's invitation to Ishibashi caught leaders of the
 New Korea Democratic Party off balance. Some have berated Kim-
 not formally a party member-for seeking to dictate party policy.
 Comment: The attack on Kim reflects anger over his antigovernment
 comments in the US and his breakthrough in expanding contacts with
 the Socialists-but stops short of demanding legal actions. This
 suggests that Chun may have been persuaded that arresting Kim
 would only rally the now-divided opposition. If the New Korea
 Democratic Party disavows Kim's initiative, it will set back Ishibashi's
 efforts to moderate his party's policy toward Seoul and keep stride
 with efforts of the Liberal Democratic Party to promote the inter-
 Korean dialogue. The Chun government may interpret Ishibashi's
 proposed visit In January as opening the way for some future LDP
 move toward P'yongyang and may block the trip.

 ANGOLA:          Implications of the Government Offensive
 The Angolan military's much improved performance in the
 offensive this year against UNITA insurgents underscores the
 more direct role Soviet advisers have had in planning and
 directing combat operations. UNITA has been knocked off. stride
 and requires more direct support by South Africa. Foreign
 support probably will become increasingly important to both the
 government and UNITA
 Government forces dealt UNITA its first significant reversal since the
 group expanded operations in 1982 to secure more territory. Since
 July, the government captured Cazombo and nearly took Mavinga-
 190 miles (300 kilometers) northwest of UNITA's headquarters in
 Jamba-until driven back last month by South African airstrikes.
 Cazombo gave UNITA access to the border with Zaire and was a
 support base for northern operations. Mavinga, the first sizable town
 UNITA captured, was the site of its party congress in 1982 and a way
 station on supply lines to the north.
 Expanded Soviet involvement in planning and directing Angolan
 combat operations, together with greater Angolan use of tactical air
 support, were key factors in Luanda's gains. Failure to make much
 headway against UNITA last year probably led Moscow to conclude
 that a more direct Soviet role was necessary this year. By midyear,
 large numbers of Soviet aircraft delivered in 1984 were in operation,
 Luanda used Cuban pilots and a
 growing
 support
 Soviet arms shipments have increased since 1983 apparently in
 reaction to UNITA's capture of Cangamba, a major government
 defeat that shocked Luanda and caused Moscow to redouble its
 military support. Soviet deliveries from late 1983 throughout 1984
 included more than 100 fighters, fighter-bombers, and helicopters,
 plus additional air defense weapons, various armored vehicles,
 artillery, and other materiel. The Angolan Army has a full range of
 conventional weapons; the insurgents remain lightly armed.
 R
 The Soviets are likely to continue their extensive advisory assistance
 in combat operations, and Moscow probably will provide more air
 defense weapons and radars in hopes of deterring South African
 actions. Additional fighters and helicopters may also be delivered.
 Luanda probably believes its better performance can be repeated,
 and it may even start the offensive earlier than usual next year. Future
 military strategy no doubt will be addressed during the party congress
 stand and fight again.
 A more direct Soviet or Cuban role in Angolan air or ground
 operations in response to future South African intervention on
 UNITA's behalf cannot be ruled out. Apart from replacing UNITA's
 equipment losses and resorting to commando operations, there is
 little Pretoria can do-short of direct intervention-to prevent Angola
 from repeating its success in the next offensive if UNITA decides to
 Although not beaten, UNITA leader Savimbi probably will have to cut
 back on semiconventional operations, and he is sure to seek
 Improved antitank and antiaircraft weapons. He probably will try to
 intensify guerrilla activity in central and northern Angola just to keep
 the government off balance. Urban bombings and attacks on
 administrative and eco     taroets. "ncludina the oil facilities in
 Cabinda, may increase.
 Special Analysis
 A bill that grants wide powers to the president, currently under
 debate by the National Assembly, is an important step toward
 carrying out President Zia's pledge to restore civilian rule before
 the end of the year. The still-outlawed political parties reject the
 inferior position of the parliament under the proposed system,
 but they have been unable to launch an effective opposition.
 Sectarian unrest could delay any transfer of power, but both
 military and popular pressure will make it difficult for Zia to
 A small group of independent Assembly delegates is delaying
 progress toward the restoration of civilian rule by prolonging the
 debate over constitutional amendments that define the powers of the
 president, prime minister, and parliament. Last week Zia tried to clear
 the way for passage of the amendments by withdrawing a widely
 criticized proposal for a national security council that would have
 served as a watchdog over the parliament. His revision still gives the
 president substantial power and retains what Zia sees as the most
 essential provision-indemnity for martial law administrators for
 actions taken under the military regime.
 The bill will inevitably be passed despite opposition objections, and
 this will further erode the credibility of Prime Minister Junejo and the
 government's parliamentary "grouping," particularly if the
 government resorts to heavyhanded tactics to get the bill approved.
 Junejo has been criticized for acquiescing In recent actions of the
 martial law regime. including the Imposition of mail censorship and
 the preemptive arrests of opposition leaders, most notably Benazir
 Bhutto, daughter of the executed Prime Minister and leader of the
 Pakistan People's Party.
 the opposition
 may be preparing to make one more attempt at forming an effective
 coalition. Leaders of the major political parties gathered late last
 month to discuss their objections to the proposed constitutional
 reforms; some have begun calling for a united opposition effort to
 block or modify them. Even so, the Movement To Restore Democracy,
 a loose coalition of 11 major Illegal political parties, is ambivalent
 about how to deal with the emergence of a civilian government
 because its main issue---martial law-would then disappear. Benazir
 Bhutto's party, the most important in the Movement, decided shortly
 after her arrest that it would refrain from activity against the regime
 unless Zia fails to meet his pledge by yearend.

 the transitional regime. Many professional soldiers resent having to

 The
 public, despite skepticism about Zia's Intentions, will increasingly
 expect Zia to keep his pledge to lift martial law as the year nears its
 or pretext for extending martial law.
 The Internal security situation has been volatile in recent months and
 will be an important factor in a successful transition to a civilian
 government. Unrest Inspired by sectarian tensions-such as the
 disturbances that broke out in Quetta last summer-or protests
 against needed economic strictures could provide Zia a justification
 rallying point for them.
 Zia is unlikely to let antiregime agitation reach a level that will
 jeopardize the restoration of civilian rule. Martial law administrators
 will keep a close watch on the activities of political opponents and
 particularly on those reported to be In contact with the Soviets;
 further preemptive arrests are likely. Prospects for the development
 of a strong coalition among the opposition are dim, but Benazir
 Bhutto's detention-due to end in late November-may yet prove a
