PROBABLE DEVELOPMENTS IN CHINA 
SUMMARY 
Introductory Note: The purpose of the follow-
ing discussion is to present probable develop-
ments in China which will affect US interests 
during the next six to twelve months. 
1. Communist military forces are capable 
during the summer months of 1949 of destroy-
ing all semblance of unity in the National Gov-
ernment of China; and before the year is out, 
the Communists will have formed a central 
government which will seek international rec-
ognition. 
2. The US cannot reverse or significantly 
check this course of events, nor is there any 
prospect that the Soviet orientation of the 
Chinese Communists can be altered in the im-
mediate future. However, during the coming 
months, developments in China will raise a 
number of problems on which the US may 
either take action advancing, or avoid action 
compromising, its interests in China and else-
where. Chief among these are the formation 
of a Communist central government claiming 
international recognition, Communist aims 
regarding Taiwan and Hong Kong, the Com-
munist need for foreign trade, and US aid to 
anti-Communist groups in China. In addi-
tion, US interests probably will be affected ad-
versely by the expansion of Communist influ-
ence throughout the Far East, particularly if 
a Chinese Communist regime gains seats on 
the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied 
Council for Japan, and acquires China's 
claims regarding a future Japanese peace 
treaty. 
3. The government to be organized by the 
Chinese Communists will be proclaimed as a 
"coalition," but actually will be a Communist 
dictatorship. In foreign affairs the Commu-
nists during the coming months will continue 
to be solidly aligned with the USSR. The new 
regime will honor the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 
1945 and its attitude in international relations 
will be governed by the Moscow line. It will 
probably maintain an unfriendly attitude to-
ward the US in particular and all other gov-
ernments that impede the world Communist 
movement, as well as denounce China's exist-
ing international agreements with those gov-
ernments. 
4. Communist armed forces, now decisively 
superior to the Nationalists, will continue their 
program of area-by-area acquisition. They 
are capable of eliminating all effective military 
resistance in the south, southwest, and north-
west by the end of 1950. 
5. The Chinese Communists will probably 
not be faced with serious food shortages dur-
ing the next year. Some progress will be 
made in reviving transportation and industry, 
and the Communists will have a relatively 
stable currency. The Communists' principal 
economic problem in the coming months will 
be that of acquiring petroleum, machinery, 
and perhaps cotton. There is little prospect 
of substantial Soviet aid, and domestic re-
sources must be supplemented by these essen-
tial imports. Therefore, China's economic re-
covery during the next year will probably de-
pend on active Western trade and close ties 
with occupied Japan.

have concurred in this report; for a dissent of the Intelligence Organization of the 
Department of State, see Enclosure A, p. 21. This report contains information avail-
able to CIA as of 2 June 1949.

PROBABLE DEVELOPMENTS IN 'CHINA 
Introductory Note: The purpose of the follow-
ing discussion is to present probable develop-
ments in China which will affect US interests 
during the next six to twelve months. 
1. Imminent Problems for the US Arising out 
of Developments in China. 
The Chinese Communist armies have the ca-
pability, during the summer months of 1949, 
of completing their campaign in the Yangtze 
Valley, from the eastern border of Szechwan 
to the sea, and of dislodging the Nationalists 
from Canton and other ports on the southeast 
coast during this same period. Their military 
operations in this period will destroy all sem-
blance of unity in the present National Gov-
ernment, the remnants of which will seek ref-
uge in Taiwan, southwest and northwest 
China, or in flight abroad. In late summer or 
early autumn, the Chinese Communist Party 
will convoke a Political Consultative Confer-
ence to form and proclaim a Communist-con-
trolled government for all China before the 
end of 1949. At that time, Communist China 
will contain more than half of China's people, 
and, if not more than half of China's territory, 
at least the larger part of its most productive 
areas. The Communist Government then will 
seek recognition as the national government 
of China. 
The US cannot reverse the course of the Chi-
nese civil conflict nor induce the Chinese Com-
munists to modify their intention to establish 
a Communist dictatorship over China. Also, 
there is no prospect that the US can alter the 
Soviet orientation of the Chinese Communists 
in the immediate future. During the next few 
months, however, there will be a number of 
developments in China affecting US interests 
such as: (1) possible incidents involving US 
armed forces, officials, and nationals; (2) 
sharpening of the Communist-Nationalist 
struggle for Taiwan, where US strategic inter-
ests are involved; (3) Chinese Communist de-
signs on Hong Kong and Macao; (4) US aid 
to anti-Communist groups in China; (5) the 
Communist need for foreign trade; (6) the es-
tablishment of a Communist central regime 
seeking international recognition, and; (7) 
the expansion of Chinese Communist influence 
throughout the Far East. 
It is known that the leaders of the Chinese 
Communists desire international recognition 
for their regime, and that they also desire 
commercial relations with the West and with 
Japan. These facts may permit the US, in 
the course of the next several months, either 
to take action advancing or to avoid action 
compromising certain of its interests in China 
and elsewhere in the Far East. 
a. Possible Incidents. 
In firing upon British warships in the 
Yangtze, the Communists demonstrated that 
they are prepared to risk reprisals in order to 
substantiate their promise to protect China 
from "imperialist aggression." The Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) undoubtedly gained 
face within China and elsewhere in Asia by 
this action, and it is possible that the Commu-
nists will again take advantage of any oppor-
tunities which arise for military action against 
foreign armed forces. The opportunities for 
local incidents involving foreign officials and 
nationals have become much more numerous 
with the CCP occupation of major cities?as 
suggested by the forced entry of the US Am-
bassador's residence by Communist soldiers 
during their occupation of Nanking. Inci-
dents involving the mistreatment of foreign 
nationals and the destruction or seizure of 
foreign property are likely. If the Communist 
regime should request, and be refused recogni-
tion, it is highly probable that such incidents 
will multiply, with CCP connivance. If the 
US should extend further support to the Na-
tionalists, such incidents can reach serious 
proportions. 
b. Taiwan. 
There is no doubt that the CCP desires to 
extend its control over the island of Taiwan,

where Chiang Kai-shek is preparing for a last 
stand, hoping to survive until reinforced by 
the US at the outbreak of a world conflict 
which he believes inevitable. The Commu-
nist-Nationalist contest for control of the 
Island will become more sharply drawn in the 
near future, when Chiang Kai-shek and his 
Nationalist followers will be forced to estab-
lish headquarters there. 
The CCP is not capable, at the present time, 
of successfully undertaking an amphibious 
operation against Taiwan. In the next few 
months, however, the CCP will not only ac-
quire the mainland coastal ports and shipping 
to make such an operation possible but also 
will be able to infiltrate the island, attempt to 
subvert Nationalist officials there, and exploit 
the widespread native resentment of Nation-
alist rule. These developments will improve 
CCP chances of taking control of Taiwan. 
The Communist-controlled regime certainly 
will assert sovereignty over Taiwan, and the 
leaders of Taiwanese native groups in time 
may support them in that claim. While civil 
disorders on Taiwan will probably not be suffi-
ciently serious to wrest the island from Na-
tionalist control, any insurrection which de-
velops on Taiwan is likely to further the pur-
poses of the CCP. There is a prospect of 
lengthy propaganda warfare, with increas-
ingly successful subversion of Nationalist offi-
cials and armed forces, and increasingly dam-
aging civil disorders, which may set the stage 
for Communist military occupation. 
US economic and military aid, short of 
armed intervention, would probably not sig-
nificantly assist the Nationalists in holding 
Taiwan, any more than such aid has helped 
the Nationalist cause on the mainland of 
China. Taiwan's economic problem is prin-
cipally that of Nationalist inefficiency in man-
agement, not deficiency in resources; and ex-
tensive stocks of military equipment are al-
ready stored on the island. Furthermore, 
such an aid program would make it difficult, 
If not impossible, to establish normal diplo-
matic and consular relationships with the 
Communists, in the event that the US should 
decide on a policy of recognition of a central 
government established by the Communists 
on the mainland. 
c. Western Possessions of Hong Kong and 
Macao. 
Although Hong Kong, under British con-
trol, offers Communist China certain advan-
tages in foreign trade, nationalistic sentiment 
will almost certainly impel the CCP to press 
for the return of this colony, as well as Por-
tuguese Macao. The British Government, 
determined to defend Hong Kong against a 
possible Communist military assault, is dis-
patching considerable reinforcements to the 
colony, thus reducing its capability to meet 
military commitments in Europe and else-
where and to maintain a strategic reserve in 
Great Britain. In addition, the UK is seek-
ing at least moral support from the US for its 
Hong Kong defense plans. However, Com-
munist military action against Hong Kong 
and Macao, while possible, is not likely. It is 
more probable that one of the early acts of the 
Communist regime will be that of initiating 
discussions with the British and Portuguese 
governments in regard to the transfer of au-
thority in Hong Kong and Macao. If the UK 
and Portugal should withhold de facto recog-
nition from the Communist Government, or in 
some other manner refuse to enter into such 
negotiations, the CCP will retaliate. The 
CCP, which presumably does not fear Portu-
gal, may choose to exert military pressure on 
Macao, as well as to work through the Com-
munist underground. In Hong Kong, rather 
than taking military action, the CCP will 
propably choose to operate through the strong 
Communist underground, which already con-
stitutes a serious threat to the colony and 
which will become increasingly active. The 
Communists could cripple Hong Kong by 
fomenting strikes in transportation and com-
munication facilities, could restrict or cut off 
food supplies from the Chinese mainland, 
could sabotage water supplies, could resort to 
unrestricted piracy against shipping, and 
could create an exchange rate between the 
currencies of Hong Kong and Communist 
China to weaken the economy of Hong Kong. 
The eventual return of Hong Kong to China, 
thereby depriving the UK (and indirectly the 
US) of a valuable but vulnerable Far Eastern 
naval base, appears probable, but not within 
the calendar year of 1949.

d. US Aid to Anti-Communist Groups. 
The US is the best available source for the 
small arms, artillery and ammunition desired 
by the remaining anti-Communist forces, and 
it may be anticipated that such forces, indi-
vidually or in the name of the National Gov-
ernment, will appeal to the US to supply such 
materiel. However, major anti-Communist 
forces controlled by Chiang Kai-shek, Chang 
Chun, and the Moslem leaders of the north-
west, Ma Pu-fang and Ma Hung-kuei, even 
now are located either off the mainland or in 
the peripheral areas of China. In addition, 
there is some doubt as to whether any of those 
forces, except those of the two Mas, could 
usefully employ further US aid. Chiang's 
forces on Taiwan already have extensive mili-
tary and economic resources. Chang Chun's 
forces in Szechwan do not need economic aid. 
Moreover, it is improbable that military aid 
to these forces can prevent the Communists 
from extending their control over Szechwan 
at any time they choose to do so. 
The Mas of the Northwest (the provinces 
of Ningsia, Kansu, and Tsinghai) with the 
advantages of forbidding terrain, excellent 
organization, and hardy troops, are in the 
strongest defensive position of any of the re-
maining anti-Communist forces in China. 
Moreover, on the basis of past performance, 
the Mas, as compared with other anti-Com-
munist groups, would make the most effective 
use of any aid which they might be given. 
However, their bases in the provinces of 
Tsinghai and Ninghsia are the most difficult 
to reach with US aid, which probably would 
have to be transported by air. The Northwest 
area is self-sufficient in food, and may hold 
out for several years even without US aid, 
either because the Communists will be reluc-
tant to attack or will favor its development as 
a buffer against the expansion of the USSR 
into China through Sinkiang. 
Overt US aid to anti-Communist forces in 
China would compromise the maintenance of 
normal diplomatic and commercial relations 
with the Communist-controlled regime, in the 
event that the US should choose to follow a 
policy of recognizing such a regime. Further-
more, US military aid to any anti-Communist 
forces other than the Mas, might well go the 
5 
way of the bulk of US aid supplied to the 
Nationalists in the past?to the Communists. 
Aid of the type and proportions extended 
hitherto to the National Government, at 
best, could delay but will fail to prevent the 
extension of Communist rule through all 
China. 
A further consideration is the continuation 
of US aid to Nationalist China, as provided 
for in the China Aid Program. With Na-
tionalist-held areas soon to be limited to Tai-
wan and the western provinces of China, it 
will be difficult to justify the US program on 
humanitarian grounds as aid to the Chinese 
people as a whole. Thus the US would be-
come increasingly vulnerable to Communist 
propaganda, attacking the US aid program as 
designed solely to bolster and prolong resist-
ance on the part of anti-Communist remnants. 
e. Communist Need for Foreign Trade. 
Communist import requirements provide 
the US with a possible weapon against Com-
munist China. Depriving the Communists 
of essential imports would retard the rehabili-
tation of China and increase the economic 
difficulties that will confront the CCP. Some 
essential imports, chiefly petroleum products 
and items of capital equipment, can be ob-
tained in quantity only from the US or UK. 
The USSR, without some sacrifices in its do-
mestic economy, will be unable to supply many 
kinds of equipment, will provide inferior 
goods in other cases, and will probably make 
heavy demands on China in exchange for its 
assistance. 
The controls to be used would probably not 
be effective if they were so severe as to be in 
fact an embargo. It is doubtful if the US 
could arrange for concerted support for an 
embargo among the Western Powers, and the 
Communists would gain sympathy and sup-
port within China by representing an embargo 
as "imperialist" persecution. Limited export 
controls on selected commodities such as pe-
troleum and capital goods probably would be 
acceptable to the UK, which has the largest 
economic interests of any Western Power in 
China, and would probably serve US purposes 
just as well as a complete embargo.

On the other hand, there are advantages the 
US may gain from free trade with Communist 
China. Quid pro quo concessions, such as 
regularization of the position of US consulates 
in Communist-held areas of China, might be 
obtained. The promotion of commerce be-
tween Communist China and Japan, further-
more, in addition to being valuable to China, 
would significantly assist Japan economically 
and thereby reduce the drain of US support of 
the Japanese economy. 
f. The Communist Desire for International 
Recognition. 
The Communist-controlled regime will seek 
international recognition as the National Gov-
ernment of China as soon as it is formed and 
proclaimed?an event which will probably oc-
cur near the end of 1949. The attitude of this 
regime toward the US will be unfriendly, if 
not frankly and actively hostile. For the pur-
poses of this discussion, it is assumed that the 
US, when confronted with the Communist 
regime's request for recognition, will pursue 
one of three courses: (1) non-recognition, i.e., 
neither de facto nor de jure recognition for an 
indefinite period; or (2) immediate de jure 
recognition, which the Communists presuma-
bly desire; or (3) delayed de jure recognition, 
e.g., early de facto recognition, but a delay of 
several months to a year or more in according 
de jure recognition. The consequences of 
each of these three courses of action are esti-
mated briefly below. 
Obviously, the international act of granting 
or withholding recognition would not effect 
any genuine change in the ideological hostil-
ity of the CCP toward the non-Communist 
world. So long as the Chinese Communists 
regard the USSR as the leader of world Com-
munism, and the USSR regards the US as its 
principal enemy, the conduct of the CCP 
toward the US will continue to be governed 
by the international Communist line, as pro-
mulgated by the USSR. 
(1) Non-Recognition. 
For the US to refuse recognition to a Com-
munist China would entail a number of un-
favorable consequences. There is no prospect 
that the Nationalists can be restored to au-
thority over any large part of China; the Na-
tionalist leaders, their authority progressively 
restricted to their place of refuge, are doomed 
to exile or extinction. In addition, it is im-
probable that many foreign governments will 
withhold for a prolonged period recognition 
of the Communist regime in China; thus, the 
official representatives and private citizens of 
governments withholding recognition would 
find themselves at a disadvantage as com-
pared with the nationals of governments ex-
tending recognition. Moreover, the Com-
munist regime, strengthened by recognition 
by one or more major powers, would claim 
seats in the UN, other international organiza-
tions, and on the Far Eastern Council, and 
would be supported in its claim by members 
of such bodies. It is further probable that 
the Communist regime, if the US were to with-
hold recognition, would in turn refuse to reg-
ularize the position of US consulates in China, 
and would even force them out of China. 
(2) Immediate De Jure Recognition. 
Immediate de jure recognition of the Com-
munist regime, which almost certainly is the 
CCP's objective, would avoid certain of the 
adverse consequences of non-recognition. The 
CCP presumably would be opposed to any in-
ternational relations short of full de jure rec-
ognition, because mere de facto recognition 
would permit the Western Powers openly to 
support anti-Communist elements in China, 
and because de facto recognition has been as-
sociated in Chinese eyes with the 1911-27 
period of warlordism. Immediate recogni-
tion, however, would not alter the basic hos-
tility of the CCP toward the US, and might 
even encourage the Chinese Communists in 
their arrogant and intransigent attitude 
toward the US and toward other powers which 
followed the US lead, perhaps to the extent 
that they would follow the Soviet lead in 
restricting the number and location of US 
consular offices, particularly in Manchuria. 
In addition, immediate recognition would 
probably not cause the Communists to with-
draw their threat to repudiate existing Sino-
US treaties, or to refrain from obstructing US 
policies on international issues such as the 
Japanese peace settlement.

(3) Delayed Recognition. 
Should the US delay, for a period of several 
months to a year or more, in according de jure 
recognition to the Communist regime in 
China, some of the disadvantages of both 
non-recognition and immediate recognition 
might be obviated. Since the Communists 
are interested in obtaining de jure recognition 
as soon as possible, they might be inclined to 
discuss, and to reach some prior understand-
ing with the US regarding present and future 
treaties and the number and location of US 
consular offices in China. This period would 
also afford other Western governments an op-
portunity to bring political and economic pres-
sure on the Communist regime. Concerted 
action by Atlantic Pact powers, which have 
indicated a desire to maintain a common 
front, can be anticipated if the delay in ac-
cording de jure recognition is not prolonged 
to the point where it would become inimicable 
to their interests. Through the period of a 
common front, however, there would always 
be the risk that other governments, seeking 
special advantage by early action, would pro-
ceed unilaterally to extend de jure recogni-
tion. The Communists can be expected to 
follow, and probably to improve upon, the 
traditional Chinese diplomatic practice of 
playing one power against another. 
g. Chinese Communist Influence through-
out the Far East. 
The CCP has indicated its interest in unit-
ing one billion Orientals in a Communist Asia. 
To this end, the CCP industriously propagates 
the view that Communism is inevitable in 
Asia, and that only the Communists are the 
champions of Asian "independence." The 
prestige of Communism will increase enor-
mously as the CCP extends its control over 
all of China. 
(1) Japan and Korea. 
The CCP has stated that China and Japan 
"can and should establish close friendship" 
and has warned that Japan must conclude a 
peace treaty with a Communist-controlled 
government of China. The CCP is attempt-
ing to open trade with Japan, and the Jap-
anese Communist Party echoes the CCP line 
that only "democratic" forces can successfully 
7 
conduct commercial and political relations 
with China. In Korea, the CCP's successes 
have contributed greatly to the confidence of 
the North Korean regime and to the feeling of 
defeatism in the Republic of Korea. Through 
its relationship with North Korean leaders, the 
CCP is capable of providing significant mili-
tary and economic aid to North Korea. The 
opportunity of South Korean leaders to offset 
the development of such an adverse trend has 
largely passed and it now appears that South 
Korea can do little to forestall such a develop-
ment. Recognition by the Western Powers 
of the CCP's regime would be to the advantage 
of Communist China both politically and eco-
nomically, insofar as it permitted trade be-
tween China and Japan. De jure recognition 
would give the Chinese Communists further 
opportunity to claim seats on the Far Eastern 
Commission and on the Allied Council for 
Japan, as well as weaken further the position 
of the Korean Republic's government. 
(2) Southeast Asia. 
The CCP is extending its influence through-
out Southeast Asia by identifying itself with 
native independence movements, by denounc-
ing "reactionary" colonial governments, by 
threatening "fascist" non-colonial govern-
ments, and by promising protection to over-
seas Chinese communities. De facto recog-
nition of the Communist regime by the West-
ern Powers would tend to increase the politi-
cal and economic influence of the CCP in 
Southeast Asia. To withhold de jure recogni-
tion would make the CCP's work in Southeast 
Asia somewhat more difficult, but the govern-
ments and the Chinese overseas communities 
in that area would pay little heed to such a 
legalism. The Chinese communities will tend 
to orient themselves toward the CCP as it ac-
quires control of China although there may 
be significant resistance elements among the 
overseas Chinese. Likewise the governments 
in Southeast Asia will adjust themselves to 
these new circumstances, whether for accom-
modation or resistance. The CCP will prob-
ably not employ military force to gain its ob-
jectives in Southeast Asia and it has no sig-
nificant economic resources with which to 
maneuver. Its success in China, however, will

permit strong and unremitting political pres-
sure on Southeast Asia. 
2. Political Situation. 
a. Communist China. 
(1) Extension of Control. 
(a) Present Extent of Communist China. 
Communist China now is divided into six ad-
ministrative areas: (1) Northeast China, hav-
ing an Administrative Council but as yet no 
"People's Government"; (2) Inner Mongolia 
with an Inner Mongolian Autonomous Gov-
ernment; (3) North China (Hopeh, southeast 
corner of Chahar, eastern Shansi, western 
Shantung) having a North China People's 
Government; (4) Central Plains (Honan, most 
of Anhuei, northeast corner of Hupeh) with a 
Central Plains People's Government; (5) East 
China (Kiangsu and eastern Shantung) with 
as yet no People's Government; (6) Northwest 
China (western Shansi, eastern Shensi, east-
ern Suiyuan, eastern tips of Kansu and Ning-
sia) with as yet no People's Government. The 
Communists do not yet have a central gov-
ernment, so that whatever centralized control 
there is, is exercised by the Central Commit-
tee of the Chinese Communist Party, at pres-
ent located in Peiping. 
(b) Intended Extent of Communist China. 
In its New Year's Message for 1949, the CCP 
stated that its armies would cross the Yangtze 
in 1949 and that the Party would convoke a 
Political Consultative Conference to form 
and proclaim a Communist-controlled gov-
ernment. Without pretending that this gov-
ernment would actually control all China by 
the end of 1949, the CCP statement strongly 
implied that the new regime would nonethe-
less seek recognition as the national govern-
ment. Subsequent statements have reiter-
ated that it is the CCP's firm intention to 
extend its control over all China and to de-
stroy all significant political and military op-
position. The CCP has announced that, in 
the interest of preserving the manpower and 
material resources of the nation, it prefers to 
negotiate a peaceful transfer of military and 
political power wherever possible; but that the 
Communist armies are prepared to effect such 
transfer of power by military force where Na-
tionalist leaders and forces refuse to cooper-
ate in a peaceful transfer of power. 
(c) Lack of Popular Resistance. The re-
sumption of the military offensive by the Com-
munist armies has forced the CCP to offer the 
war-weary people of China some justification 
for this action. Before and during the April 
peace negotiations in Peiping, the CCP re-
peatedly accused the Nationalists of insin-
cerity, at the same time claiming that the 
people of China did not desire an uneasy 
truce with the Yangtze as a boundary-line. 
In their order to continue the drive into South 
China, Chairman Mao Tse-tung and Com-
mander Chu Teh again accused the National-
ists of negotiating only to gain time for a 
comeback designed "to destroy the revolu-
tion." Although no amount of propaganda 
can persuade the people of China that the 
Communists are everything they pretend to 
be, the bulk of the people in Nationalist China 
are probably not dismayed by the prospect of 
a change of government, and may even wel-
come the prospect of Communist rule, believ-
ing that it will bring a greater degree of 
security and a lesser degree of exploitation. 
(2) Transfer of Political Authority. 
(a) A New Central Government. Because 
the CCP has not formed or proclaimed a cen-
tral government asserting authority over all 
of China, decisions on the question of inter-
national recognition of such a government 
thus far have been postponed. Diplomatic 
officials in Nanking and consular officials else-
where in Communist China are regarded by 
the local Communist authorities as private 
citizens rather than as the representatives of 
their governments. This situation is likely to 
continue until the proclamation of a Com-
munist-controlled government, at which time 
the question of de facto recognition will arise. 
For the next few months, the CCP will be 
absorbing large numbers of lower and middle 
echelon National Government personnel?by 
far the greater part of these officials stay on 
the job?thus avoiding a complete break in 
continuity with the old order. The CCP prob-
ably will take the stand that, if foreign powers 
wish to continue operations in China, either 
through official representatives or as private

Approved For Release 2003/06/20 il8tH.661300269R000300040003-1 
citizens, they must give at least de facto recog-
nition to the regime. 
(b) The "Coalition" Pattern. The CCP 
has promised to convoke a Political Consulta-
tive Conference in 1949 to form and proclaim 
a "coalition" government. The Kuomintang 
as a Party will be excluded from this new 
"coalition." The CCP has frankly stated that 
the intended "coalition" government will be 
"under the firm leadership of the CCP." The 
concept of "coalition" derives from the larger 
concept of Chairman Mao's "new democracy," 
the name given to the transitional stage from 
today's "capitalist" society to the later "so-
cialist" society. In structure, the "coalition" 
will include three major blocs: (1) the CCP; 
(2) non-Communist "democratic parties" 
which follow the CCP line, such as the Demo-
cratic League and the Kuomintang Revolu-
tionary Committee and; (3) "democratic ele-
ments," occupational and functional groups 
which invariably support the CCP's position. 
While this government will permit some de-
gree of popular participation in the election 
of representative bodies, all real power will be 
concentrated in the CCP, whose function it is 
to "guide" the backward masses. 
(c) Political Consultative Conference. The 
Political Consultative Conference will be the 
medium for creating a new constitutional sys-
tem and for obtaining some degree of domes-
tic sanction for the new regime, just as the 
Political Consultative Conference held in 1946 
was a symbol of potential National unity. 
The Chinese Communist Party will convoke 
this Conference in its own name and in the 
name of minority parties and functional 
groups which follow the Communist line, prob-
ably in the late summer or early autumn of 
1949, after they have consolidated their con-
trol of the Yangtze valley. It is not known 
whether the Conference will consist of a few 
dozen or several hundred persons; in either 
case, the Communists will control it firmly. 
The Conference will either draft and ratify a 
constitution, or, possibly working through a 
committee established for that purpose, draft 
a constitution and set a date for elections to 
a "constitutional convention." In the latter 
event, promulgation of the constitution and 
formal establishment of a constitutional gov-
9 
ernment would be delayed until 1950. In any 
case, the Conference will simply be a rubber-
stamp congress summoned to approve in the 
name of "the people" policies predetermined 
by the Communists while its constitution, for-
mally providing for various rights, will, in 
fact, bestow no rights which the Communists 
cannot take away. 
(d) Domestic Sanction for the New Order. 
In order to gain domestic sanction for the 
Communist-controlled regime, the CCP, in 
conjunction with the Political Consultative 
Conference, will probably exploit the alleged 
affinities of Communist doctrine and practice 
with the theories of Sun Yat-sen, generally 
regarded within China as the "father" of the 
Republic. The CCP claims that Sun's famous 
Three People's Principles?"nationalism, de-
mocracy, livelihood"?have been more closely 
followed by the Communists than by the Kuo-
mintang. It points to Sun's advocacy, in the 
1920's, of "alliance with the Soviet Union, alli-
ance with the Communists, alliance with the 
workers and peasants." The CCP may also 
cite the 1924-27 period, when the Communists 
were admitted to the Kuomintang by Sun 
himself, and insist that only the CCP has truly 
carried out the terms of Sun's will by ushering 
in the constitutional stage of government 
which he demanded. The CCP will by no 
means deify Sun Yat-sen, but his tradition 
can be very useful in smoothing the Party's 
path. 
(3) Foreign Relations. 
(a) Sino-Asian. 
(i) Japan and Korea. The CCP, in a 
broadcast attempting to influence the Jap-
anese elections of January 1949, stated that 
China and Japan "can and should establish 
close friendship," and pointed out that Japan 
must conclude a peace treaty with a Com-
munist-controlled government of China and 
establish economic and political relations with 
it. More recently, the CCP has been attempt-
ing to open trade with Japan. There is little 
doubt that China will exert economic pressure 
and political influence on both Japan and 
Korea, possibly with a view to subordinating 
those countries to itself in a Communist Asia. 
The CCP maintains close relations with Corn-
SECRET

10 Approved For Release 20gEQ6in;rCIA-RDP861300269R000300040003-1 
munist leaders in Japan and Korea, and there 
is reason to believe that at least some of those 
leaders are oriented as much toward Com-
munist China as toward the USSR. 
(ii) Southeast Asia. In recent months, 
the CCP: (1) has told the Indonesian Repub-
lican leaders that they cannot succeed with-
out Communist leadership; (2) has denounced 
the British and French governments for their 
activities in China, Malaya, and Indochina; 
and (3) has threatened retaliation against 
the "fascist" governments of the Philippines 
and Siam for "persecuting" overseas Chinese. 
Assistance to revolutionary movements 
throughout Southeast Asia, pressure upon the 
colonial governments concerned, and influ-
ence within overseas Chinese communities will 
certainly increase as the CCP extends its con-
trol throughout China and obtains interna-
tional recognition of its "coalition" govern-
ment. However, the extension of CCP influ-
ence in southeast Asia will not be unopposed, 
because of the deep-seated fear of "Chinese 
imperialism" in these countries. 
(b) Sino-Soviet. Chinese Communist rela-
tions with the USSR should continue to be 
extremely cordial. In major policy state-
ments of the past year, the CCP has endorsed 
the Cominform's denunciation of Tito, called 
upon "revolutionary forces" throughout the 
world to unite under Soviet leadership against 
"American imperialism" and promised that 
China will be the ally of the USSR in any 
West-provoked war. The CCP's tactical pro-
cedures have found orthodox justification in 
Lenin's and Stalin's expositions of the princi-
ples governing "colonial" revolutions, and the 
CCP is now bringing its policies more nearly 
into accord with those of more "advanced" 
revolutions. There are points of potential 
conflict between the USSR and the CCP?such 
as possible Soviet inability to assist in China's 
industrialization, Soviet designs in China's 
border regions, the CCP's intentions toward 
Communist movements in Asia, and the gen-
eral issue of subservience to Moscow?but 
none of these issues seems likely to cause 
serious friction in the near future. The 
"coalition" government will certainly give the 
USSR preferential status in China, perhaps 
by expanding the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 
1945?which the CCP has repeatedly en-
dorsed?to provide for a high degree of mili-
tary and economic integration between the 
USSR and China's border regions. For the 
present, CCP leadership appears genuinely to 
feel that China's best interests will be served 
by close Sino-Soviet cooperation. 
(c) Sino-US. 
(i) "Traitorous" Treaties. The CCP posi-
tion, in regard to treaties concluded by the 
National Government since early 1946, has 
been that such treaties were concluded with-
out the knowledge and consent of the par-
ties?among them the CCP?participating in 
the Political Consultative Conference of 1946, 
and that the CCP therefore does not recognize 
their validity and "absolutely will not bear 
any obligation" for them. The CCP has 
stated that "all those (treaties and agree-
ments) detrimental to the Chinese people and 
nation, especially those which sell out na-
tional rights, should be abrogated, revised or 
reconcluded, according to the circumstances." 
The Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945 has been spe-
cifically excluded by the CCP from those trea-
ties which "sell out national rights." The 
Sino-US treaties which the CCP regards as 
"traitorous" are those which provide for eco-
nomic and military aid to the National Gov-
ernment and the stationing of US armed 
forces in China. The CCP view appears to be 
that, first, the post-1946 Sino-American trea-
ties are "traitorous" simply because they were 
concluded with the US, the principal enemy 
of world Communism, and, second, that US 
economic and military aid to the National 
Government was employed principally in the 
struggle against the Communists. In addi-
tion, the CCP has indicated its intention of 
repudiating the existing Sino-US "Treaty of 
Friendship, Commerce and Navigation" 
(1948), on the grounds that this agreement 
is an instrument of US "imperialism" in 
China. In order to develop trade with the 
US, however, the CCP may come to see the 
desirability of negotiating a new agreement 
of this nature. 
(ii) The US as an Enemy. As the CCP has 
proclaimed the USSR as China's principal 
friend, the US has been portrayed with equal 
SECRET 
Approved For Release 2003/06/20 : CIA-RDP86600269R000300040003-1 
Approved For Release 2003/06/20s:ELARRH86B00269R000300040003-1 
fervor as China's outstanding enemy. The 
CCP has represented the US as the leader and 
supporter of all "imperialist" and "reaction-
ary" forces in the world, as forcing "traitor-
ous" treaties upon China in exchange for 
financing the Nationalists in the civil conflict, 
as directing the military operations of the Na-
tionalists and encouraging them to reject the 
Communist-dictated "peace agreement," and 
as plotting with forces inside and outside 
China to destroy the CCP and keep the Orient 
in permanent slavery. 
While the CCP has understandable grounds 
for resenting the US contribution to the Na-
tionalists' military operations, the CCP's pres-
ent anti-Americanism is primarily dictated by 
the opposite CCP and US positions regarding 
the USSR and world Communism. US official 
representatives and private citizens in Com-
munist China, although not subjected to 
physical violence, have been restricted in their 
movements and in the discharge of their con-
sular, commercial, or educational functions, 
while the CCP is exploiting the US loss of 
prestige in China and enhancing its own pres-
tige by an intransigent attitude toward the 
Western Powers. The "coalition" govern-
ment will presumably invite US recognition 
and attempt to conclude commercial treaties 
with the US but the CCP can be expected to 
give aggressive support to Soviet and satellite 
diplomacy, to continue its vigorous and irre-
sponsible anti-American propaganda, to bring 
pressure upon the US to withdraw its assist-
ance to Nationalist remnants on Taiwan and 
to make the work of US diplomatic missions 
difficult. At present, there is little chance of 
orienting the CCP away from the USSR. 
(d) Other Foreign Relations. The CCP 
has adopted an attitude toward foreign gov-
ernments hostile in proportion to the degree 
that those governments are impeding the 
world Communist movement, regardless of 
whether such governments have or have not 
supported the Nationalists in the Chinese civil 
conflict. The fact that the UK has been of 
service to the CCP, in affording sanctuary 
and an operating base to CCP leaders in Hong 
Kong, did not restrain Communist forces from 
11 
firing upon British warships in the Yangtze. 
Neither will it prevent the CCP from demand-
ing the return of Hong Kong to China nor 
will it obviate the possibility of giving support 
to terrorist bands operating against the 
British in Malaya. 
The CCP undoubtedly intends to deprive 
Portugal of the colony of Macao, by negotia-
tions, if possible, but by military action if 
necessary. The French Government has been 
denounced by the CCP for encouraging US 
"imperialism" in China and for its actions in 
Indochina. The Netherlands Government 
has been similarly castigated by the CCP in 
regard to Indonesia. All other Atlantic Pact 
states have been the targets of CCP propa-
ganda abuse, both for joining the Pact and for 
other "reactionary" activities. India, which 
is probably recognized by the CCP as its prin-
cipal rival for leadership in Asia, is charac-
terized as remaining under the influence of 
British "imperialism." 
Representatives of the Commonwealth 
countries and of a number of European gov-
ernments in China have expressed a desire to 
become accredited to the Communist regime 
soon after it is proclaimed. These representa-
tives would like to regularize their status by 
early recognition of the Communists in order 
to protect and perhaps expand their present 
interests in China. They have not regarded 
the prospect of applying economic sanctions to 
China with favor and they apparently antici-
pate profitable commercial relations with the 
new regime in varying degrees. At the same 
time, the governments of most Common-
wealth and Atlantic Pact nations have ad-
mitted the desirability of maintaining a united 
front on the question of recognition. 
b. Nationalist China. 
Nationalist China is virtually bankrupt and 
the National Government is in its death-
throes. The process of disintegration and 
fragmentation is so far advanced as to render

tions as an organized administration even on

a regional basis. Since Chiang Kai-shek's re-
tirement from the presidency in January, there 
has been little evidence of leadership or cen-
tral direction of the Government. (Acting 
President Li Tsung-j en has little power and his 
effectiveness has been little greater than that 
of a well-meaning warlord.) The Executive 
Yuan has accomplished little for months; even 
the basic ministries are limping along ineffec-
tually. The Legislative, Control and Judicial 
Yuan in Canton are rump organs with slight 
Influence. Political power is largely in the 
hands of provincial or regional bodies. Tax-
ation and other basic governmental functions 
are localized. 
The Nationalist split into factions headed 
by Chiang and Li has hastened the process of 
disintegration and fragmentation. Although 
Chiang retired as President without resigning, 
he has continued to control armies, military 
and financial resources, the secret police, the 
party agencies, and many leading officials. 
Acting President Li nominally heads the Gov-
ernment, but, in his weakness and frustration, 
has done little else than conduct the abortive 
peace negotiations which ended on 20 April. 
The struggle between Li and Chiang is so in-
tense that any significant rapprochement or 
compromise appears improbable. Li controls 
Kwangsi and has the support of Pai Chung-
hsi, various southern warlords, and many 
peace-seeking officials. He will probably con-
tinue his nominal leadership of the Canton 
Government until Communist military pres-
sure compels Nationalist leaders to seek refuge 
elsewhere, at which time Li will probably try 
to maintain a government in Southwest China. 
Chiang Kai-shek controls Taiwan and ad-
jacent areas on the southeast coast, and has 
a diminishing influence in the southwestern 
provinces. Chiang has been transferring Na-
tionalist resources systematically to Taiwan, 
which is being prepared as the final refuge to 
which many Nationalist officials in Canton will 
flee when the city is threatened by the Com-
munists. Large numbers of refugees from 
mainland China are already in Taiwan and the 
provincial administration is headed by 
Chiang's appointee, General Chen Cheng. Al-
though Nationalist rule is increasingly un-
popular with the oppressed, unorganized na-
tive population, the Nationalists probably will 
be able to maintain a regional regime in Tai-
wan for at least the remainder of the year 
1949. The major threat to their position will 
come from mainland Communist forces rather 
than from the local people. 
As in the recent past, the National Govern-
ment's foreign relations during coming months 
will be dominated by issues concerning the US 
and the USSR. Nationalist China has de-
pended greatly on US economic and military 
aid, which still continues in diminishing quan-
tities, although no future US military commit-
ments are in prospect. Despite repeated fail-
ures to obtain additional aid, the National 
Government and Nationalist regional regime 
will continue their appeals to the US and claim 
that such aid will be used to resist the Com-
munists. 
In Taiwan, the Nationalists have an impor-
tant bargaining point. Aware of US interest 
in that island, they will present themselves as a 
means and perhaps the sole means of prevent-
ing its communization, and will offer various 
Inducements and assurances in return for US 
aid and US moral support for a regional Chi-
nese regime. They will also argue the legality 
of such a Chinese administration despite the 
fact that Taiwan's status has not been formal-
ized by conclusion of a peace treaty with 
Japan. 
The National Government will strive to keep 
Its international status despite its growing 
weakness. Depending chiefly on what future 
Communist policies may be, that status might 
not be seriously challenged for several months 
and foreign recognition of the National Gov-
ernment will probably continue so long as it 
stays in Canton. 
Chiang Kai-shek and other Nationalist lead-
ers are embittered toward the USSR, which 
they feel is at least partly responsible for their 
misfortunes. The idea of appealing to the 
UN has been seriously considered in National-
ist circles and the matter may be brought up 
again before the Nationalists lose their inter-
national status. If made, this maneuver would 
be accompanied by denunciation of the Sino-
Soviet Treaty of 1945, governing the status of 
Manchuria and Outer Mongolia.

While such antagonistic measures might be 
directed against the USSR on the one hand, 
the National Government might at the same 
time effect an apparent rapprochement with 
the Soviet Union and conclude agreements in-
volving further concessions, particularly in 
Sinkiang and the Northwest provinces. 
In its last stages of existence, Nationalist 
China may turn its wrath against the US. 
In Nationalist thinking, the US is largely re-
sponsible for the Yalta agreement, and the US 
postwar policy of mediation in the civil war 
and intermittent limited assistance have fa-
cilitated the Communist triumph. Such feel-
ings will be intensified if the US rejects further 
appeals for aid and evidences interest in recog-
nizing a future Communist-dominated Chi-
nese Government. 
3. Military Situation. 
a. General Strategy. 
The objective of the Chinese Communist 
forces is the elimination of all anti-Communist 
armed resistance in China. To attain this ob-
jective the Chinese Communist Party has em-
ployed the strategy of using military force as 
'4.1?Y a medium of realizing their political objectives. 
Communist control over the remainder of 
China will be accomplished by means of an 
area-by-area program of military acquisition, 
dictated to a large degree by the state of their 
political preparedness for administering these 
areas. 
The remaining Nationalist or anti-Com-
munist forces have now adopted the strategy 
of avoiding decisive military action, while at 
the same time attempting to deny territory to 
the Chinese Communists as long as possible. 
b. Communist Armed Forces. 
The Chinese Communist Forces possess suffi-
cient wealth in material and manpower to 
overcome all anti-Communist remnants in 
China. Having already eliminated the ma-
jority of the best Nationalist armies, the CCP 
is now in the process of consolidating its recent 
virtually unopposed military conquest of the 
Yangtze valley. In consequence, Communist 
armies, free to accelerate their movements to 
the south and the west, appear to be headed 
toward Kwangtung. As elsewhere, however, 
the speed and magnitude of this operation 
13 
probably will be limited in some degree by the 
abilities of the CCP political organization to 
assume the additional administrative respon-
sibilities. 
Recent CCF victories have brought with 
them the new responsibility of protecting com-
munications, urban life, and industry. Conse-
quently a considerable portion of CCF must be 
utilized to garrison "liberated" areas and 
maintain lines of communication. 
(1) Strength and Disposition of Communist 
Ground Forces. 
The Communist regular forces comprised of 
the field forces and Military District troops 
now total approximately 2,017,000 (see Table, 
p. 14), thus giving the CCF a decisive nu-
merical superiority over the Nationalists in 
combat strength. These regular forces, par-
ticularly the field forces, are characterized by 
good leadership, good equipment, high morale 
and discipline, as well as excellence in intelli-
gence and the employment of propaganda. 
In addition to the regulars, there are irregular 
forces, known as the People's Militia, generally 
local in character and function, totalling per-
haps 2,000,000. Such forces, on occasion in 
the past, have supplemented the regulars dur-
ing a campaign. In the future, they will 
probably be occupied largely with the task of 
policing CCP areas. A third potential source 
of manpower comes from Nationalist troops 
which have fallen into Communist hands. Of 
these, approximately 90,000 have been inte-
grated into the CCF. Communist regulars 
will also be greatly assisted in their drive 
south by dissidents, bandits, and irregular 
Communist bands, already in control of wide 
rural stretches in the southern provinces. 
(2) Air Force. 
The Chinese Communist Air Force made its 
first public appearance during 1949 May Day 
celebrations in the Mukden area. Both B-25 
and F-51 type aircraft participated in the air 
parade. The Communists are known to have 
obtained by defection or capture at least 38 
operational aircraft including bombers, fight-
ers, transports, and trainers. The actual 
number of pilot defections is believed to be 
substantially greater than the 20 known cases 
although the Communist claim of 2,000 is con-

Note: The total regulars includes an estimated 636,600 Military District Troops and former Nationalist 
troops of the ex-Nationalist 38th, 59th, 60th and 77th Armies, and 84th and 110th Divisions with an aggre-

sidered to be greatly exaggerated. There is 
no evidence that Soviet aircraft observed in 
CCP areas of Manchuria have been there in 
any but a transient capacity. No Communist 
aircraft have been used in the combat areas 
and lack of aviation fuel will drastically limit 
the CCP capability for air operations. 
(3) Navy. 
The CCP has acquired by defection and cap-
ture upwards of 63 Nationalist naval vessels. 
The following is a breakdown, as to types, that 
may be operational in Communist hands as of 
31 May 1949: 
3 Destroyer escorts (DE) 
1 Mine-sweeper (AM) 
7 Gunboats (PG) 
1 Repair Ship, light (ARL) 
1 Icebreaker (AGB) 
1 Landing Ship, medium (LSM) 
1 Landing Craft, Infantry (LCI) 
17 Landing barges 
17 Armed motorboats 
14 Small patrol boats 
For the most part, crews of the foregoing craft 
and those of other naval craft which have been 
disabled or destroyed are available to the Com-
munists. These craft, plus merchant ship-
ping which may be captured or otherwise ac-
quired, will provide the Communists with a 
growing capability for short over-water opera-
tions. 
(4) Logistics. 
The CCF, hitherto almost solely dependent 
on animal transport, makeshift machine-shop 
arsenals, and captured Nationalist stores for 
logistic support, has now overcome this earlier 
handicap. In addition to substantial Japa-
nese stockpiles turned over to them in Man-
churia during 1945-46, the CCF, having cap-
tured tremendous Nationalist stocks which 
were largely US-supplied?now enjoys superi-
ority in materiel over the Nationalists. In 
addition, the CCF has acquired most of the in-
dustrial centers of North and Central China?
including the Mukden arsenal, which alone 
produced some 60-70 percent of the total Na-
tionalist ordnance output. This and other in-
stallations taken over by the CCF can supply 
all the materiel needed for future mainland 
operations. In place of horse-cart methods of 
supply, the Communists now control and are 
rapidly rehabilitating most of China's rail and

water transport net. A north-south rail line 
from Manchuria to the Yangtze has already 
been opened. 
c. Anti-Communist Armed Forces. 
The Chinese Nationalist armed forces, al-
though defeated by the Communists and lack-
ing cohesive command structure at present, 
were not beaten by the sheer force of arms. 
Very few major battles, such as those witnes-
sed in World War II, were fought. From the 
resumption of Nationalist-Communist hostili-
ties in May 1946 until September 1948, the 
Chinese Communists employed guerrilla tac-
tics of hit, ruin and run, with resultant minor 
but effective actions. In September 1948, the 
Chinese Communists stormed Nationalist Tsi-
nan, where, much to the Communists' sur-
prise, key Nationalist defections brought about 
by the disintegration of local? troop morale led 
to the collapse of government resistance. The 
debacle at Tsinan established the pattern for 
subsequent defections; from September 1948 
to May 1949, a rising wave of mass defections, 
sell-outs, and general unwillingness to fight 
swept through the Nationalist armed forces. 
The defeat of the Chinese Nationalist Army, 
therefore, can be attributed basically to in-
ternal decay. Although the strategic error of 
over-extension of forces contributed in part, 
the basic reasons for Nationalist defeat were, 
and continue to be: (1) army politics, which 
kept militarily incompetent officers in posi-
tions of high command; (2) the personal com-
mand of all combat areas exercised by Chiang 
Kai-shek, which prevented independent tacti-
cal action by field commanders; (3) accelerat-
ing economic decay, which resulted in inade-
quate pay, food, clothing, and equipment for 
the troops; and (4) graft and corruption, 
practiced by senior officers at the expense of 
their troops. 
In consequence of these conditions, Nation-
alist morale disintegrated from top to bottom 
and Nationalist forces lost the all-important 
"will to fight." Nationalist armed forces, to-
day, have ceased to be an organized, cohesive 
and centrally directed military machine. They 
now exist as a group of widely scattered, dis-
organized, and uncoordinated regional anti-
Communist "warlord" forces. 
15 
(1) Strength and Disposition of Nationalist 
Ground Forces. 
The strength of the remaining anti-Commu-
nist armies in China totals approximately 720,-
000 regular combat troops. In addition, there 
are some 500,000 service troops dispersed 
throughout the remaining areas of National-
ist operation (see Table, p. 16). 
The "combat" forces listed in the accom-
panying table include a high percentage of 
poorly trained and ill-equipped provincial 
levies. Not included are an undetermined 
number of local (Peace Preservation Corps) 
troops. 
At present, there are basically four separate 
centers of potential anti-Communist resistance 
in China. These are: (1) the southeast (in-
cluding Taiwan) directly under Chiang Kai-
shek?approximate strength, 300,000; (2) the 
southern provinces of Kwangtung and Kwang-
si, under Li Tsung-jen and Pai Chung-hsi--ap-
proximate strength, 200,000 plus; (3) the 
southwest, under Chang Chun (possibly in-
cluding the troops of Hu Tsung-nan) ?ap-
proximate strength 225,000; and (4) the north-
west, under Ma Pu-fang and Ma Hung-kwei?
approximate strength, 100,000. 
(2) Air Force. 
The Nationalist Air Force has from 85,000-
100,000 men and approximately 1000 aircraft, 
of which 600 are reportedly operational. The 
potential of the CAF has also been reduced by 
losses through defection and capture. Five-
sixths of the CAF's total of 1,000 aircraft have 
been transferred to Taiwan. Because of 
maintenance difficulties and operational ac-
cidents only 35 percent of the operational air-
craft are effective. The morale of the air 
forces, although somewhat higher than the 
ground forces due to differences in pay scales, 
is still very low. Consequently, CCP propa-
ganda has found and continues to find a re-
ceptive audience in the ranks of the air force. 
(3) Navy. 
The Nationalist Navy, lately weakened by 
the loss of upwards of 63 craft (of which at 
least a light cruiser, destroyer escort, and a 
gunboat have been destroyed or disabled) has 
approximately 150 ships, not including harbor 
craft, and about 30,000 men. Navy morale, as

Communist infiltration of the navy continues. 
(4) Logistics. 
The Nationalist field forces have been de-
pleted in numbers and deprived of the larger 
part of their weapons, transportation, and 
equipment. Their central supply organiza-
tion is now defunct and, more important, their 
central supply base, from which unit materiel 
replacements had previously been obtained, is 
now non-existent. The Nationalist field com-
manders find themselves facing logistics simi-
lar to those encountered by Communist field 
commanders a year ago. The Nationalists 
must now depend largely upon their own pri-
vate resources and ingenuity for logistic sup-
port. The anti-Communist forces, largely 
confined to marginal regions, will hold only 
two areas which can presently contribute sub-
stantial logistic support. These are Szech-
wan, with some 13 major arsenals as well as 
rich agricultural resources, and Taiwan. 
Taiwan, which produces an agricultural sur-
plus, has lately received US military aid ship-
ments as well as arsenal installations trans-
ferred from the lower Yangtze Valley. 
The northwest, in contrast, requires air 
supply, and the entire sweep of southern 
China is incapable of supporting large armies 
and broad-scale military operations over an 
extended period. Long-term resistance in 
these areas, therefore, would require a steady 
flow of supplies, both military and economic, 
from outside China. Communication in the 
south and southwest can be kept open only 
so long as the loyalty of the people in those 
areas is retained. 
d. Present and Future Operations. 
The objective of the latest Chinese Commu-
nist offensive, begun on 20 April, is to secure 
the lower Yangtze Valley from Szechwan to the 
sea and at the same time drive a wedge deep 
into south China in order to separate the forces 
of Pal Chung-hsi and Li Tsung-j en in Kwangsi 
from those of Chiang Kai-shek in the south-
east. The southern drive on Canton and Foo-
chow, additionally, will accelerate fragmenta-
tion of the Nationalist Government by forcing 
further flight to Taiwan or Chungking or pos-
sibly to both. 
The primary Communist objective probably 
will be realized by the end of August. At no 
time from now on can the Nationalists be ex-
pected to put up more than token resistance, 
since their first concern will be withdrawal of 
their remaining troops intact to Taiwan and 
the more remote areas of the southwest. By 
the end of 1949, in consequence, the Chinese 
Communists probably will exercise military 
control over all of mainland China from Man-

churia south to Kwangtung and from the 
eastern border of Szechwan to the sea. 
(1) Communist Military Problems. 
Although the Communist forces have all 
the advantages at present, when they move 
to eliminate the last areas of resistance they 
will face certain entirely new problems. The 
Communist armies will be moving into ex-
tremely rough mountainous terrain in their 
drive to the southwest and the northwest. In 
order to support their occupation armies ade-
quately, they must of necessity greatly extend 
their lines of supply and communication into 
these food-deficit areas. Although Commu-
nist forces will be greatly assisted by dissi-
dents, bandits, and irregular CCP bands in 
the south and southwest provinces, they will, 
particularly in the northwest, be moving into 
a great expanse of territory where the local 
populace is either actively or potentially hos-
tile. The expanding Communist armies will 
also face the problem of how to feed, clothe, 
indoctrinate, and otherwise dispose of captured 
or defected anti-Communist forces. 
The acquisition of Taiwan is another prob-
lem for the CCP: The Communist armies have 
no amphibious experience or training. At 
present, they lack the requisite shipping to 
undertake an assault on Taiwan. The lack 
of amphibious experience, moreover, may force 
the CCP to be satisfied with the much slower 
political methods of underground action to 
accomplish their conquest of the island. 
Perhaps the largest problem facing the CCP 
lies in preventing the military machine from 
outrunning their abilities for political con-
solidation. To halt their victorious armies 
would not only belie CCP propaganda but 
would probably shake troop morale from top 
to bottom. Over-all success, therefore, de-
pends upon the maintenance of a very delicate 
balance between CCP military acquisitions and 
political preparedness. 
(2) Nationalist Problems. 
Problems currently facing the remaining 
Nationalist Armed Forces appear to be insur-
mountable. The present centrifugal tendency 
in Nationalist China is a recreation of condi-
tions once almost nation-wide, which the sur-
viving warlords understand well, but which 
17 
makes central planning and control virtually 
impossible. The remaining Nationalist troops 
are desperately in need of re-equipping, re-
training, re-vitalizing, and re-organizing under 
a competent and effective central command. 
It appears unlikely that these basic National-
ist needs will be fulfilled. Consequently, anti-
Communist forces in China when threatened 
by the Communist armies, must further with-
draw, capitulate, or be annihilated. 
(3) Estimate of Capabilities. 
(a) Nationalist. Remaining Nationalists or 
anti-Communist forces cannot, in the foresee-
able future, effectively resist the Communist 
military machine. Even if it were possible to 
cure existing military ills by means of outside 
assistance, superficial reforms would be ineffec-
tual unless the ailment is also treated?the 
troops must be re-instilled with the will to 
fight. , This can only be accomplished by pay-
ing the troops in accordance with the cost of 
living, by feeding and clothing them properly 
and, above all, by giving them something to 
fight for. This obviously is impossible under 
present conditions. The CCP, therefore, can 
and probably will eradicate any and all re-
gional anti-Communist armed resistance 
whenever it chooses to do so. 
(b) Communist. The CCP is currently 
capable of launching simultaneous operations 
to the south, southwest, and northwest and 
eliminating all effective military resistance by 
the end of 1950. However, in view of Com-
munist logistic and morale problems which un-
doubtedly would result from too fast a take-
over, the CCP will probably continue its me-
thodical area-by-area conquest and it may be 
2 to 3 years before the final liquidation of all 
anti-Communist resistance in China. The 
south and southwest will probably be the first 
two entries on the CCP military time-table and 
the coup de grace reserved for the Mas in the 
Northwest. 
4. Economic Situation. 
a. Nationalist China. 
The economic activities of the National 
Government in Canton and of each provincial 
government (except Taiwan and Szechwan) 
are largely confined to the search for sufficient 
SECRET 
Approved For Release 2003/06/20 : CIA-RDP86600269R000300040003-1 
18 Approved For Release 20CIA-RDP861300269R000300040003-1 
revenue to maintain their military and politi-
cal power. Economic and commercial paral-
ysis throughout most of non-Communist 
China has pauperized both the National and 
most provincial governments. 
The financial position of the National Gov-
ernment at Canton is desperate. It has suf-
fered from a serious decrease in revenue be-
cause of its inability to collect taxes, the wide-
spread repudiation of the national currency, 
and the virtual elimination of customs duties. 
In addition, State-owned industries and en-
terprises have largely ceased to operate and 
the profits of many remaining plants are no 
longer available to any but local political ad-
ministrations. Reserves of gold and silver 
still under Canton's control are very limited 
and most provincial governments are reported 
to be in a similarly serious fiscal situation. 
While most of non-Communist China is im-
poverished, Szechwan and Taiwan are excep-
tions. Both areas possess a relatively sound 
economy. Other important Nationalist as-
sets are a considerable amount of coastal and 
ocean shipping and the gold bullion in Tai-
wan. 
b. Communist China. 
(1) Internal Problems. 
(a) Economic Objectives. The first eco-
nomic objectives of the Communists will be: 
(1) the acquisition of all assets owned by the 
National Government and "bureaucratic cap-
italists"; (2) the preservation of govern-
mental financial and commercial institutions; 
and (3) obtaining the support of productive 
elements of society. The Nationalist assets 
least accessible to the Communists are the 
three million-odd ounces of gold controlled by 
Chiang Kai-shek, the overseas assets and 
holdings of the Government and its "war crim-
inal" officials, private holdings and the million 
tons of shipping now in Nationalist hands. 
It is unlikely that an appreciable amount of 
industrial plant will be removed to Nationalist 
areas, and the Communists should inherit Na-
tionalist industries largely intact. 
(b) Food Problems. While the possibility 
exists that the Communists may not be able 
to overcome the war's disruption of marketing 
facilities in a short time and that Manchurian 
surpluses may be pre-empted by the USSR, 
no starvation is expected in Communist areas 
before the June harvests, except in some 
flooded or war-desolated localities. 
Although the coastal cities long have im-
ported rice, grains and vegetable oils, because 
of the high costs of transport from inland 
areas of production to coastal consumption 
centers, there is probably enough food in the 
Yangtze Valley to supply these cities, if the 
CCP can solve the problems of collection and 
distribution. 
(c) Development of Transportatiorn, and In-
dustry. That some progress in industrial re-
construction has begun is indicated by repprts 
from Manchuria, Tsinan, Peiping, Tientsin, 
and many towns in North China which show 
that the reopening of industries and railroad 
reconstruction in liberated towns is a high-
priority task. Shortages of raw material, 
power, and skilled labor will continue to limit 
Communist development of industry after 
control over Central China is consolidated 
but, with the exception of petroleum and pos-
sibly cotton which must be imported, there 
will be sufficient resources to run most exist-
ing industry at a high level of capacity. 
The need for petroleum in Central China 
will decrease as coal becomes available in 
larger quantities and as such large oil con-
sumers as power companies are reconverted 
to coal. Domestic collection of cotton for 
textiles, China's chief industry, will be large 
and, together with present stocks in Shang-
hai, should be nearly adequate for this year's 
needs. Rehabilitated railroads, together with 
captured junks and barges on the Yangtze 
River and its tributaries, should provide ade-
quate internal transportation for essential 
marketing purposes. 
(d) Gaining Support of Productive Ele-
ments. The CCP will try to gain the active 
support of productive elements in the middle 
classes who may not yet be entirely convinced 
of the bountiful life which is promised under 
the Communist order. The Communists have 
declared that taxes must not be confiscatory, 
that governmental enterprises harmful to pri-
vate enterprises shall not be permitted, that 
workers must not demand excessively high 
wages, and generally that all means will be 
utilized to encourage private industrial pro-

duction. While these promises have largely 
remained unfulfilled, they have gained wide 
support for the CCP among Shanghai and 
Nanking businessmen. Among the middle 
classes, those most actively wooed by the Com-
munists are the technicians. They are of-
fered high pay (in Mukden reportedly twice 
that of government officials) and the chance 
to be leaders in China's reconstruction. The 
CCP has apparently gained the support of re-
sponsible technical and managerial groups in 
other Communist areas in China and may do 
so in Central China as well. 
Urban workers and the farmers may not be 
as strenuously recruited, both because their 
support is already assumed and because in-
creased rewards to the middle classes must 
frequently be made at the expense of the 
lower income groups. While continued lip 
service will be paid to better living standards, 
workers will be told that, as the "leading" 
political group, they must carry the burden 
of economic reconstruction and development. 
Similarly, few promises, other than reduced 
rents and interest rates, may be made to the 
tenant farmers, since landlords have already 
been promised that the country is too "back-
ward economically" for immediate drastic 
land redistribution. 
(e) Financial and Commercial Problems. 
The CCP has shown considerable concern over 
the establishment of internal financial sta-
bility and the resumption of domestic com-
merce. The lack of financial experts will seri-
ously hinder the Communists in the estab-
lishment of a stable and flexible currency 
which will be adequate for the commercial 
and industrial needs of North and Central 
China. Conditioned by the recent National-
ist experience with paper currency, the Com-
munists in the immediate present may con-
tinue to rely on a less flexible exchange sys-
tem based on barter and tax payments in 
grain and other commodities. To date, the 
Communists have been sufficiently successful 
in collecting agricultural output, which has 
provided them with a substantial source of 
revenue. 
Although transportation and marketing 
difficulties will hinder domestic trade, both 
state and, to a lesser degree, private commerce 
19 
has been encouraged by the CCP's commer-
cial policy and probably will continue to be. 
"Liberation" of the Yangtze Valley will prob-
ably yield to the Communists the huge col-
lection-and-sale apparatus of the Central 
Trust and other National Government agen-
cies, thus reenforcing and firmly establishing 
the Communist state trading base. 
Further, CCP acquisition of the Yangtze re-
gion will be an important factor in curing 
the present paralysis of internal commerce 
by restoring the normal integration of the 
Central and North China economies. 
(2) External Problems. 
(a) Requirements in Foreign Trade. Pe-
troleum, cotton, and the railroad, factory, and 
power equipment needed for reconstruction 
are the principal imports that the Commu-
nists will require during the next year. In-
adequate amounts of any of these items will 
seriously hamper economic recovery. Fuel-
oil requirements can be met in part by the 
substitution of coal, which should be avail-
able in quantity to the Communists. But 
kerosene, gasoline, lubricants and other pe-
troleum products which have no substitutes 
must be imported. Current Chinese con-
sumption, including aviation gasoline, is 15-20 
million barrels annually and 10-12 million 
barrels would probably be a minimum con-
tinuing annual requirement, with full utiliza-
tion of coal and with no increase in the level 
of economic activity. 
Reconstruction requirements for China are 
enormous. A minimum reconstruction pro-
gram, calling for rebuilding China's prewar 
industry and railroads and perhaps one-half 
of Manchuria's peak industrial capacity, 
would require imports of US $300-$500 million 
in China and a similar amount in Manchuria. 
The bulk of the expense would be for railroad 
equipment; the remainder would largely be 
textile, mining, and power machinery and 
equipment. Reconstruction offers special dif-
ficulties to the Communists since substantial 
credits or investments from the USSR are un-
likely and there are severe political obstacles 
in the way of Western investments. In the 
next few years, the Chinese Communists will 
be confronted with the problem of paying for

20 Approved For Release 200i/Eirpt i1A-RDP86B00269R000300040003-1 
their rehabilitation through their own efforts. 
?(b) Trade with the USSR. Soviet domina-
tion of Manchuria will be a major factor in 
directing the course of China's foreign trade 
in the next year. The Soviet Union will con-
tinue to take most of Manchuria's grain and 
soybean crops to meet the deficits of edible 
oils throughout the USSR and of food in the 
Soviet Far East. The total value of these im-
ports from Manchuria may well be in excess 
of US $100 million annually, at world market 
prices. In China Proper, the USSR does not 
have the same dominant position with respect 
to foreign trade that it enjoys in Manchuria. 
The foreign trade of China Proper is more 
likely to be directed to the non-Soviet coun-
tries because of the limited market in the 
USSR for such important Chinese exports as 
bristles, processed eggs, handicrafts, and coal. 
The disadvantages to China of the Man-
churian trade with the USSR derive largely 
from the cheap monopoly price that the So-
viets have been able to obtain on soybeans, 
the chief Manchurian export. Through its 
control of the Manchurian railroads and the 
port of Dairen, the USSR has been able to 
prevent the export of Manchurian products to 
world markets. Necessarily, trade with the 
Soviet Union on such unfavorable terms tends 
to impair China's ability to finance her 
essential import requirements. In China 
Proper, the Communists will be freer to maxi-
mize their return by directing their exports 
to whatever country offers the highest prices. 
Exports to non-Soviet countries will provide 
the Chinese directly with the means needed 
to obtain essential imports, such as petroleum, 
railroad equipment, electrical and other in-
dustrial machinery, and chemicals?products 
which can be obtained from these countries 
more readily than from the USSR. 
(c) Trade with the US. The advantage of 
CCP trade with the West and with Japan lies 
in the character of China's import require-
ments and her export markets. These ad-
vantages particularly apply to US trade, 
which, in the postwar period, has been the 
largest of any country's with China. 
The US would be a major source for petro-
leum, certain types of capital equipment, and 
vehicles. If the US alone were excluded 
from trade, Japan, the UK, and other West-
ern countries might fill a portion of China's 
reconstruction needs but it is unlikely that 
these countries can make sufficient capital 
goods exports in the next year to satisfy all 
of China's requirements. 
Not only will China probably be forced to 
depend on the US for essential imports, but 
the market for many Chinese commodities, 
such as handicrafts, tung oil, and animal 
products is determined by US demand. Were 
the US market eliminated, China's exports 
would be reduced substantially, her export in-
dustries depressed, and her ability to pay for 
needed imports greatly restricted. China's 
chances for economic recovery in such circum-
stances would be small. 
(d) Trade with Japan. Smaller transpor-
tation costs would permit Japan to outbid the 
world market for many of China's exports. 
In the case of China's export of such bulk 
commodities as coal, iron ore, and salt, Japan 
would be the only commercially important 
feasible market. In return, Japan could sell 
to China machinery and railroad equipment 
which significantly would aid the CCP re-
habilitation program. Trade, profitable to 
both countries, could in a few years total US 
$3-400,000,000 annually, an amount which 
would be a substantial portion of China's total 
foreign trade. 
Although Chinese antipathy toward the in-
dustrial revival of Japan is a political factor 
militating against such large-scale trade, it is 
very likely that the urgent economic consid-
erations of recovery will override such an ob-
jection. Indeed, the CCP's Ministry of Indus-
try and Commerce in Tientsin suggested re-
sumption of Japan trade in April and Premier 
Yoshida has repeatedly declared that Japan 
"will and must" trade with China. Japan's 
market, as well as that of the US, is very im-
portant in the long run for the achievement 
of Chinese economic independence and re-
covery.

SUBJECT : The USSR and the Korean Invasion 
The invasion of the Republic of Korea by the North Korean Army ra6 un-
doubtedly undertaken at Soviet direction and Soviet material support is 
unquestionably being provided? The Soviet objective was the elimination of 
the last remaining anti-Communist bridgehead an the mainland of northern 
Asia, thereby undermining the position of the US and the Western Powers 
throughout the Far East, By choosing Korea as the area of attack, the USSR 
was able to challenge the US specifioally and test the firmness of US r,e--
sLotanoe to Comm:1st expnnnien, 
North Korea has peed the capabilities for attacking South Korea 
for some time, and the USSR hen probably been making plant) for such an antack 
over since the withdrawal of U3 forces from Korea in 19490 This withdrawal 
and subsevent US policy probably led the Kremlin to believe that the US hea 
abandoned any intention of giving effective military support to South Korea 
and that North Korean aggression could be undertaken with only a slight r':,sk 
of US intervention? The USSR probably further estimated that, even in the 
event of such intervention, it could readily disclaim or otherwise localize 
the confliot0 
The timing of the invasion was probably determined primarily by such 
recent indications of increased US interest in the Far East as the develop-
ment of a policy for economic and military aid for Southeast Asia, 
The prompt US reaction in ordering air and naval support of South Korea 
has probably exceeded Soviet expectationso and the USSR is now faced with a 
strong possibility of global war if it supports the North Korean invasicn 
sufficiently to overcome coTbinod US and South Korean resistanoe, It is still 
estimated that the USSR is not yet prepared to risk full-scale war with the 
Western Powers? and it le expectedv therefore, that the USSR will seek to 
lonalize the Korean conflict? The USSR can achieve this result by pnblialy 
disclaiming any responsibility for the invasion and: (1) secretly ordering 
a North Korean withdrawal to the 38th Parallel and cessatian of host%litle 
(2) permitting the North Korean forces to be driven back to the 38th PenalaEl: 
but probably caatinuing sufficient aid to maintain that position or (3) pro-

and military disorder in Korea, the USSR will probably adopt the third a, 
ternative. In the probable event that this attempt proves impossible, the 
situation might well develop into indecisive and intermittent hostilitiee 
stabilized at approximately the 38th Parallel, Meanwhile, the USSR will 
continue to provide substantial material aid to the North Koreans, includ-
ing irregulars recruited from Chinese Communists and Soviet forces, 
Although the USSR has for some time been considering the advisabiliey 
of aggressive moves in other areas of the world, there is no conclusive 
(widen= to indicate the exact nature or timing of the moves being conte 
plated Southeast Asia (particularly Indochina), Iran, Yugoslavia, Gree:m? 
and Berlin offer the USSR the greatest opportunities for aggressive moves 
or increased pressure, For exempla, there is continuing evidence of mil-leery 
preparations in the Balkans aimed at either Yugoslavia or Greece and several 
reports have indicated that the Korean invasion was designed, in part, a3 
a diversionary action to cover an attack on Formosa, 
In view of the vigorous US reaction to the Korean situation, howevee? 
it is not likely that the USSR will instigate surprise moves in any of tease 
areas until the Kremlin has had an opportunity to study the implications ol 
this reaction, particularly as to its effects on the possibility of &Lobel 
warfare in the event of Soviet-inspired outbreaks elsewhere, Neverthelesal, 
Communist activity in the Far East and elsewhere will continue and will protawy 
be intensified, but creator care will be taken to maintain the fiction that 
it is "indigenous," 
Meanwhile, the USSR has reacted to the strong UN resolutions on the 
North Korean invasion by branding all action taken thus far by the Security 
Council as illegal and hence not binding, The attack itself indicated 
continued Soviet indifference to ending the boycott of the UN and the tem-
per of naa-Soviet members of the UN will in turn make it far more difficult 
for the USSR to return,

July 1950 
Soviei Pueoonce in Laellphing_the Northern Noreen it'mck. 
A. Apart from immediate strategic advantages, the basic Soviet 
vbjectives in launching the Northern Korean attack probably were to: (1) 
test the strength of US commitments implicit in the policy of contain-
ment of Communist expansion; and (2) gain Political advantages for the 
further expansion of Communism in both Asia and Europe by undermining 
the confidence or non-Commenist states in the value of US support. 
B. The Soviet eatiento of the reaction to the North Korene attach 
was probably that: (1) UN action would be slow and cumbersome; (2) the 
US would not intervene with its own forces; (3) South Korea would there-
fore collapse promptly, presenting the UN with a fait accompli; (4) the 
episode would therefore be completely localized; and (5) the fighting could 
be portrayed as US-instigated South Korean aggression and the North Korean 
victory as a vic:;ory of Asiatic nationalism against Western colonialiam. 
II. Probable Developments from the Korean incident. 
There are at present four major alternative courses of action open 
to the UCSR. They are not mutually exclusive courses of action. In 
particular, it is estimated that the USSR is very likely to try to'prolveg 
the fighting in Korea(a/ternativo "B" below) for the short run and then 
within a few weeks or months, if conditions appear favorable to Soviet 
leaders, shift to the more aggressive course of creating similar incidents 
eleewhere (elternetive"C" below). The alternatives are examined not in 
order of probability but in order of increasing risk of global war and 
increasing expenditure of effort on the part of the USSR: 
&tem:Q.7114._ The USSR may localize the Korean fighting, permitting 
US forces to drive the North Koreans back to the 38th Paeallei and refrain 
from ererting similar incidents elsewhere. In the meantime, the USSR 
would remain uncommitted in Korea and would develop the propaganda thence 
of US avression and imperialistic interference in domestic efails of cm 
Asiatic nation. 
Note: This memorandum has not been coordinated with the intelligence 
organizations of the Departments of. State? Army, Navypand tho

This alternative is the most cautious course for the USSR 
to take Its adoption world indicate complete surprise at the US re-
notion to the Korean incident and would suggest strongly that the USSR 
unvilling to ran even a manimum risk of provoking a global conflict 
involving the US and the USSR. 
2. US prestige and political influence mould be substantially 
augmented, particularly with Western European allrias and other nations 
aligned with the US, 
3. Soviet prestige and influence mould be dameged* but there 
mould be compensations in the form of secondary political gains that 
mould accrue as a result of: 
(a) promoting tho "peace campaign" and portraying the US 
as military aggressor; 
(b) exploiting the theme of Asian nationalism versus Western 
imperialism; 
(c) maintaining the North Korean and Chinese Coneunist threat 
to South Korea as an emberraesment to devolopunnt of a conetractive US or 
UN policy in Korea. 
4. This alternative course of action is unlikely; Soviet advantages 
would be secondary* comparatively long-range, and intangible, while Soviet 
disadvantages would be immediate, 
AlIppnative BA The USSRmay localize the 'i;orean fighting, still refrain 
from creating similar incidents elsewhere* but in corder to prolong US

The USSR mould remain uncommitted in Korea and would develop the propagenn-
themes of US aggression and imperialistic interference in domestic affair 
of an Asiatic nation. 
10 This alternative is a moderately cautious course for the 
USSR to teke. The USSR mould probably Consider that its adoption would 
Involve only a slight risk of provoking t global nonflict involving the 
113 and the UTSR6 
2. ITS prestige would be seriously dameged if the USSR succeeded 
In prolonging the incident in this may, Western European allies and other 
nations aligned with the US mould question the immediate military velue of 
US commitments even though expecting them to be honored, 
3. Soviet prestige would be augmented if the fighting in Korea 
were prolonged without an open Soviet commitment.

h. The USSR would obtain appreciable secondary, comparatively 
long-range gains in political influence as a result of promoting the 
"peace campaign" and portraying US as imperialistic Western aggressor 
in Asia, unless successfully countered by a US "Truth" campaign0 
5. Deep involvement of US military forces in Korea would seriously 
limit US capabilities to support Similar commitments elsewhere. Moreover, 
the Jestern European allies of the US would feel dangeroesly,exposed 
for some time (even if the US began a partial mobilization for war), 
6. The USSR probably will adopt this alternative course of 
action at least for the short run, since there would be few Soviet 
disadvantages or risks and the Soviet gains would be appreciable? 
70 This alternative will appear especially attractive to the 
USSR because at any time, if conditions appeared favorable to Soviet 
leaders, the USSR could shift to the more ambitious program (alternative 
"0", immediately below), in which alternative "B" would merely be a 
first phase? 
Alternative C, The USSR, while attempting to prolong the fighting in 
Korea as in-aTternative "BP, may also attempt to disperse and perhaps 
overstrain US military forces-in-readiness by creating a series of 
incidents similar to the Korean affair, Without directly and openly 
involving Soviet forces, such incidents could be created in Formosa, 
Indochina, 3urmal Iran, Yugoslavia, and Greece, The effects of such 
incidents could be aggravated by renewed pressure on Berlin and, possibly, 
Vienna, 
1, This alternative would be a comparatively aggressive course 
for the USSR to take, Its adoption would indicate willingnoes to run 
an appreciable risk of provoking a global conflict becaese of the possible 
US reaction, The USSR could easily turn to this alternative at any 
times, but it is not likely to turn to it until the USSR has fully analyzed 
the implications of the US commitment in Korea? 
2. Having employed its armed forces in support of its commitment 
in Korea, the US will have to honor similar comaitments or lose most of 
the advantagee of the policy of supporting the Korean comaj,trnent,, 
3. The US does not have the military forces-in-readiness to 
honor its commitments with US military forces and equipment in many 
areas other than Korea (perhaps none) without a substantial increase fel 
OS military forces and industrial productivity in the military field, 
bringing about what would amount to at least a partial (as distinguished 
from a general) mobilization for war?

4. Deep involvement of US military forces in tha Far East or 
T.Aar East would leave Western Europe even more dangerously exposed than 
at present* 
5. At some point further Korean-style incidents (requiring the 
commitment of US forces to stabilize the situation) preoumebly would 
force the US to adopt one of the following alternatives: 
(a) revise the policy of general containment by limiting 
US commitrents and by planning leo combat Soviet aegression only at those 
selected points where existing US military strength would permit; 
(I) begin partial military and industrial mobilization in 
an attempt to enable the US to combat any further Soviet-sponsored 
aggreseion anywnere in the world; or 
(c) begin total mobilization to enable the US to threaten to 
eeet any Soviet or Soviet-sponsored aggression with war against the USC,R, 
e. The USSR probably will adopt alternative "C" sooner or later 
if Soviet leaders do not estimate the risk of global war involved to be 
substantial or are prepared for a global war if it develops. 
7. If Soviet development of this alternative course of action 
leads to a general US mobilization ,itappears at this time that the 
USSR probably would in that event continue limited aggressions, accompanied 
by the customary "peace" propaganda, discounting actual US initiation of 
a general war and perhaps estimating that the political and economic 
strains of mobilization would weaken or discredit the US and its foreign 
policy% The USSR, however, may; 
(a) desist from further aggression of the Korean type, fearing 
a global war and taking mobilization as an indication of greater risk 
than Soviet leaders had anticipated in choosing this course of action; or 
(b) expecting US-initiated global war, attempt to seize the 
initiative by immediately attacking the US (in effect turning to 
alternative "Du, below)0 
Alternative D. The USSR may consider US intervention in Norea either as 
the irar?rso an inevitable global war or as justification for beginning 
a global war for which it is prepared--in either case immediately attacking 
the US and its allies.

lo Nothing in the Korean situation as yet indicates that the 
P:-1S1 would delibei-ately decide to employ Soviet forces in direct military 
;action precipitating global waro Such a deciaion is unlikely if, as 
now C-.:70'.1111B probable, Soviet leaders believe that: 
(a) there are continuing opportunities to expand Soviet 
influence by the comparatively cheap and safe meant. of Soviet-controlled 
Communist revolutionary activity (including propaganda, sabotage, sub-
version, guerrilla warfare, and organized military action by local 
Communist troops--as in Korea), which can be supported by Soviet diplomacy 
and the mare threat of Soviet military strengthAn-readinees; and 
(b) there is substantial risk involved for the USSR in the 
global war that almost certainly wouldensue from direct military action 
by Soviet forces:, 
2. The USSR would appear to have little reason to be peeriaistic 
about gains by methods short of global lux, particularly by adopt ng 
the courses of action described in Alternatives "B" and "C" above. 
3. The USSR is unlikely to choose the alternative of deliberately 
provoking global war at this time in view of: (a) the general superiority 
of the US and its allies in total power-potential; and (b) the fact that 
the present Soviet atomic cepebility in insufficient to neutralize US 
atomic retaliatory capabilities and to offset the generolly superior 
power-potential of the US and its allies by interfering with the US military 
and industrial mobilization? 
III? Effects of a Failure of US Forces to Hold South Korea? 
Ao The immediate consequences .of a failure to hold South Korea 
mould be a damaging blow to U$ prestige with loss in political influence 
greater than the loss that would have been incurred if the US had not 
undertaken to support its moral commitment in South Korea? 
130 The US would be confronted with a choice betw-,,, 41,1*rn Ileaesirable

military position? In either case US foreign policy and military 
capabilities mould be discredited at home and &roe& 
Co If US forces were expelled from Korea, the USSR would probably 
adopt alternative "C" as described above (Section II). It might be 
tempted, however, to postpone further aggressive action elsewhere until 
it had determined whether, as a result of the loss of world confidence 
in the effectiveness of US aid, other areas might not be bought within 
its sphere of influence through intimidation alone
