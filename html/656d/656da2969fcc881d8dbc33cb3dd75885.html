 CURRENT IN LIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 July 1959
 Resumption  of      private
 four-power negotiations during
 the second round of the for-
 eign ministers' conference has
 not produced any modification
 of the uncompromising Soviet
 position which ties any Berlin
 solution to the establishment
 of an all-German committee to
 discuss, among other things,
 reunification.
 In declaring "unaccept-
 able" on 20 June the new West-
 ern proposal for continuing
 indefinitely the Geneva con-
 ference to consider the Ger-
 man                 problem as a whole,   So-
 viet Foreign Minister Gromyko
 maintained Moscow's firm posi-
 tion.   Reserving the right to
 comment further at  a  later
 date, he charged that the new
 proposal does not reflect a
 desire to find an acceptable
 substitute to the Soviet pro-
 posal for an all-German com-
 mittee, since the Western plan
 differs basically from  that
 of the USSR.
 In a lengthy speech on 22
 July, he defended Moscow's in-
 sistence on negotiations be-
 tween the two Germanys as in-
 tended to permit a more real-
 istic assessment of the diffi-
 culties to be overcome.   In
 stating Moscow's position on
 the possibility of unilateral
 Soviet action, he pledged that
 while an interim agreement on
 West Berlin is in force,   as
 well as during the negotiations
 following such an agreement's
 expiration, no unilateral ac-
 tion would be taken by the So-
 viet Union.
 Khrushchev's remarks in
 Poland touching on the inter-
 national situation--such  as
 his    pledge  on  17  July  in
 Szczecin of Moscow's continued
 support to preserve both the
 frontier between East and West
 Germany and the Oder-Neisse
 line "as if they were Soviet
 borders"--were probably pH-
 manly for local consumption.
 These remarks could also have
 been intended as a reminder
 that any solution to the Ber-
 line-German problem must be ne-
 goti:a,ted in the context of a
 "two Germanys" approach and to
 put at rest any thoughts either
 inside or outside the bloc that
 Moscow would  ever  allow  the
 establishment  of  a  reuni-
 fied  Germany                                                             which  would be
 either  Western-oriented  or
 independent.
 Khrushchev refused, when
 approached directly at a So-
 viet Embassy reception in War-
 saw on 21 July to comment on
 the progress of the negotia-
 tions, saying that it was Gro-
 myko's position to do the
 "thinking  on this subject."
 Khrushchev chose the final
 communique to warn the Western
 powers that their stand in Ge-
 neva "may lead to aggravation
 of the situation, pregnant with
 danger  to  the  cause  of
 peace in Europe,"  The communique
 reiterated the admonition that
 the two countries    will  sup-
 port                                                       East        Germany  "in meas-
 ures                                                       which       it   may  recog-
 nize as appropriate to liqui-
 date the abnormal situation
 in Berlin."  Calling for  a

 heads-of-government conference
 "to lessen international ten-
 sion,"' the declaration assert-
 ed that a certain amount of
 positive work had been done at
 the foreign ministers' level.
 It "emphasized  the  special
 right" of Poland and Czecho-
 slovakia to participate in any
 East-West negotiations on the
 German problem and European
 security.
 Meanwhile, it is rumored
 in Moscow that a top-level bloc
 conference of bloc leaders is
 to be held early in'August.
 The Soviet leaders prob-
 ably view Vice President Nixon's
 visit to the USSR as a major
 opportunity to examine East-
 West positions with aview to-
 ward narrowing the gap suffi-
 ciently to satisfy Western re-
 quirements for holding a sum-
 mit conference.   Moscow prob-
 ably hopes during the visit
 to probe for possible future
 movement in the American posi-
 tion, as well as any splits in
 Western unity.
 Soviet propaganda has crit-
 icized the vice president and
 has alluded to incidents during
 his trip last year to Latin
 America as indications of what
 the peoples of other nations
 think of American leaders.
 Khrushchev's decision to
 cancel his Scandinavian tour
 originally scheduled for 9-27
 August leaves Moscow free to
 bid   perhaps during the vice
 president's visit--for an early
 summit meetings   Although the
 Soviet leaders would probably
 expect the Western powers to
 reject a call for a mid-August
 meeting on the grounds of in-
 sufficient time for prepara-
 tion, they may believe that
 such a move would increase pres-
 sure in the West, particular-
 ly on London, for agreement to
 hold a top-level meeting in the
 near future.
 Despite the complete stale-
 mate in the negotiations at
 Geneva, bloc propaganda  and
 public statements by officials
 for both internal and external
 consumption continue to be op-
 timistic about the final out-
 come, probably in  order                                                             to
 keep the West from precipitant-
 ly breaking off the negotia-
 tions.   However, a 20 July TASS
 article repeated a Western news
 comment on the alleged split
 growing between  the  United
 States and Britain over Ameri-
 can "obstinate rigidity." So-
 viet propagandists have                                                             at-
 tacked President Eisenhower's
 proclamation of "Captive Nations
 Week," noting its coincidence
 with, Vice President Nixon's
 trip to the USSR.
 Nuclear Test Talks
 Initial Soviet reaction to
 the Western proposal intro-
 duced at the conference on 20
 July--providing for control-
 post staffs consisting of one
 third from the host country,
 one third from the "other side,"
 and one third from the nonnu-
 clear countries--was  mixed.
 The Soviet delegate called the
 proposal a step forward, al-
 though not far enough  "to be-
 come a subject for agreement
 between us,"   He opposed the
 introduction of personnel from
 nonnuclear countries because
 the "chief burden" should fall
 on the three nuclear powers,
 which bear the main responsi-
 bility under the treaty.   He
 alleged that he  was "taken
 aback" by the Western statement
 that the new proposal repre-
 sented a final concession on
 staffing and charged that this

 sounded like an "ultimatum not
 conducive to agreement."
 The Soviet delegation has
 continued to press for agree-
 ment on its draft proposal for
 an annual inspection quota,
 claiming that the American del-
 egation's silence on this is-
 sue reflects pressure by cir-
 cles in the United States op-
 posed to agreement,
 After much prodding by the
 Western delegates, the Soviet
 delegate on 17 July gave an
 item-by-item review of Moscow's
 position on the veto and added
 that the USSR continued to in-
 sist on the principle of una-
 nimity on various topics, but
 did not care whether this was
 brought about by veto rights
 in the control commission or
 by specific treaty provisions
 for three-power unanimity on
 these topics.
 West German Views
 Following a period of con-
 f'usibni:. and Foreign Minister
 Brentano's recall to Bonn for
 discussions with Chancellor
 Adenauer on 16 Jiily, the West
 German Government has apparent-
 ly abandoned its 1Q: July memo-
 randum to the Western powers
 suggesting an adjournment of
 the Berlin negotiations and
 calling for a summit confer-
 ence on disarmament and unifi-
 cation.   Bonn's press chief
 confirmed publicly that the
 memorandum represented Ade-
 nauer's views, despite  press
 reports that it had been dis-
 tributed without his consent.
 He also stated, however, that
 Adenauer still supported a sum-
 mit conference with a broad
 agenda and considered it dan-
 gerous to limit such a meeting
 to the German and Berlin ques-
 tions.
 In a press conference on
 20 July, West  Berlin  Mayor
 Brandt reiterated the Berlin
 government's stand on the points
 Which must be covered in a
 Berlin settlement.   Brandt said
 that Western rights in Berlin
 must be maintained undiminished,
 -along with the right of free
 access, and that the gradual in-
 tegration of West Berlin with
 West Germany must not be dis-
 turbed.   He repeated his ear-
 lier suggestion for a German
 "interadministrative" commission
 to handle technical problems
 such as interzonal trade, travel,
 and cultural exchanges. Brandt
 emphasized that Berliners were
 less interested in obtaining
 formal Soviet recognition of
 Allied rights than in the fact
 that; the Western powers would
 continue to exercise these          25X1
 rights.
 British Pressures
 Continued British pressures
 to achieve a heads-of-government
 meeting were reflected in Ambas-
 sador Whitney's 16 July conversa-
 tion with several representative
 Conservative Members of Parlia-
 ment.   The MPs stated that if a
 summit meeting failed to materi-
 al.ize3, , the British public would
 place the blame on the United
 States, and that some resentment
 would also be directed at the
 Conservatives, whose chances
 would be;hurt in the general

 election anticipated this fall.
 The MPs noted that the British
 public is not dptimistic that
 a summit meeting would produce
 results, so that even an unsuc-
 cessful meeting just prior to
 elections would not adversely
 affect Conservative prospects.
 The British press, mean-
 while, has taken a pessimistic
 MIDDLE
 Iraq
 tone with the sharpening of the
 East-West differences at Geneva.
 Vice President Nixon's visit
 to the USSR is now  seen as
 providing  an  opportunity for
 progress.  The  independent
 Times  believes  this  should
 clai Tfy  Moscow's "real  in-
 tentions."
 (Concurred 'in  by
 from the high command, that those.
 who mislead "simple soldiers"
 and instigate violence will be
 severely punished, and that it
 is his intention to act as the
 protector of the rights of all
 communities, parties, and in-
 dividuals. Members of the Turko-
 man community are being urged
 to return to their homes and to
 assist the authorities in the
 investigation of the incidents.
 The celebration on 14 July
 of the anniversary of the Iraqi
 revolution now seems to have
 increased rather than alleviat-
 ed political and communal ten-
 sions.   The large-scale dis-
 orders which broke out in the
 northeastern center of Kirkult
 on that day, even though they
 were suppressed within three
 or four days, may be symptoms
 of dangers still to come rather
 than a climactic development.
 The scale and ferocity of
 the Kirkuk incident apparently
 owed as much or more to antip-
 athies between the Kurdish and
 Turkoman communities as it did
 to possible Communist instiga-
 tion.   From the Qasim regime's
 standpoint, the most dangerous
 aspect of the affair  was  the
 rapidity with which the local
 police and army units disinte-
 grated into factions which
 chose one or the other side in
 the fighting.
 In a speech on 19 July be-
 fore a Christian minority group,
 the prime minister again under-
 lined his determination that his
 government, and his government
 alone, will decide who is plot-
 ting against the revolution,: that
 the army must take orders only
 Qasim has so far seemed to
 rely  primarily  on  appeals
 to  the  better nature  and
 patriotism of the Iraqis to
 prevent violence, which could
 lead to long feuds, particular-
 ly in outlying areas where old
 antagonisms are easily awakened.
 He may well have to take tougher
 preventive measures, however,
 if he is to avoid a general
 breakdown of government author-
 ity outside the capital.
 Iraqi-Soviet Relations
 Soviet leaders, concerned
 over current difficulties of
 Iraqi Communists, are placing
 major emphasis on efforts to
 show Qasim that the USSR  is
 Iraq's best friend.  The high-
 level delegation from Moscow
 to the  14 July celebration
 carried  an  invitation  from
 Khrushchev to  Qasim to  visit

 the Soviet Union.   Kuznetsov,
 Soviet deputy foreign minister
 who headed the delegation, saw
 Qasim at least twice during the
 festivities.   Moscow- radio's
 world-wide propaganda coverage
 of the Iraqi celebrations was
 favorable and extremely heavy--
 over 100 commentaries, which is
 far more than similar celebra-
 tions in the UAR have received.
 Cairo's propaganda media
 have charged that the Kirkuk
 incident was part of a broader
 Communist plot.   There is no
 evidence to support this asser-
 tion, which is itself a part of
 Cairo's not-too-subtle effort
 to embroil Qasim with the Com-
 munists as  much as possible
 While the Cairo press has
 given most of its attention to
 the events in Iraq, it has also
 discovered a new Anglo-Israeli
 conspiracy concerning the Suez
 Canal.   London has again indi-
 cated it hopes the World Bank
 will postpone consideration of
 the UAR's application for  a
 canal-improvement loan until at
 least some more of the outstand-
 ing economic issues between
 Britain and the UAR have been
 settled.   While Nasir has re-
 peated that he would like to
 see an improvement in his re-
 lations with Britain and France,

 The Israelis remain the
 UAR's most immediate foreign
 policy problem.   Tel Aviv is
 continuing its diplomatic prob-

 freedom  of  navigation of the
 Suet Canal.  The Israelis re-
 gard this as primarily a po-
 litical rather than an economic
 problem, since they claim that
 the port of Eilat at the head
 of the Gulf of Aqaba can ade-
 quately handle the relatively
 small percentage of Israel's
 foreign trade which moves to-
 ward Asia and East Africa.
 The Israelis insist that
 their free use of  the  gulf,
 without which Eilat would be
 only a minor fishing haven, is
 the :really vital issue, and
 the Suez Canal question is for
 them a kind of diplomatic buff-

 Tel Aviv is not likely to take     25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 23 July 1959
 Tension has increased-along
 the Algerian-Tunisian border
 in the wake of an attack on 14
 July by a 500-man band of Alge-
 rian rebels on a French out-
 post at Ain Zana.   The attack-
 ers subsequently withdrew into
 Tunisia, which is apprehensive
 that the French may retaliate
 in force.  Tunis has, proclaimed
 a state of emergency in one
 border region after charging
 that  unidentified Algerian
 elements  had attacked Tunisian
 Army posts.
 The current border tension
 appears to reflect attempts by
 the rebels to provoke incidents
 between the French and the Tuni-
 sians in order to direct inter-
 national attention to the Alge-
 rian problem.   The attack at
 Ain Zana--possibly designed to
 provoke a French strike into
 Tunisia--was on a larger scale
 than usual for the rebels, but
 appears to have resulted in few
 casualties and little damage.
 Long-standing Tunisian con-
 cern over the situation along
 the border with Algeria--where
 Tunisians have been involved in
 incidents with rebel as well as
 with French troops--is doubt-
 less heightened by recent rumors
 that the French plan a major
 strike at rebel installations
 in Tunisia.   A rebel communique
 alleging that the French are
 planning a "massacre" of Moslems
 in the border area by troops
 disguised as Algerians appears
 designed to play on this con-
 cern and to blame the French
 in advance for any future in-
 cidents.
 The "highly emotional"
 protests of Premier Debre and
 other French Government leaders
 to American and NATO officials
 over prospective US and Norwe-
 gian shipments of arms and am-
 munition to Tunisia stem basi-
 cally from French fears that  .
 this materiel might enable the
 rebels to mount a new offensive
 in Algeria.  This would under-
 cut French claims that the Alge-
 rian war has been won, and en-
 courage additional domestic and
 international pressures on France
 for a rapid settlement.  Paris
 has long maintained that'.the
 rebels have been able to hold
 out only because  of  foreign
 support. and  encouragement.
 Norway has decided to re-
 fuse export licenses for the
 time being, and Tunisian offi-
 cia]Ls deny any deal with the
 Norwegians.   Oslo's decision
 has  not deterred  Paris  from
 insisting that the  United
 States  halt its shipments.

 liveries  contracted  for  in

 Fidel Castro's action on
 17 July forcing President Manuel
 Urrutia's resignation by pub-
 licly defaming him has served
 once more to demonstrate his.
 hold over the Cuban masses,
 His authoritarian behavior, how-
 ever, has probably weakened his
 support among middle-class ele-
 ments, where respect for demo-
 cratic methods has always been
 strongest, and has tended to
 further Communist objectives.
 Although Castro. resigned
 as prime minister on 17 July
 in his maneuver against Urrutia,
 he remains the recognized "maxi-
 mum leader of the revolution,"
 the informal position that gives
 him his real power.   The new
 president, the 40-year-old
 lawyer Osvaldo Dorticos,.is ex-
 pected to be a compliant front
 man for him.
 Castro's major charge was
 that Urrutia's strong anti-Com-
 munist declarations on 13 July
 bordered on treason because they
 had given aid and comfort to
 the Cuban "reactionaries" abroad
 who are trying to sabotage the
 revolution and provoke foreign
 intervention by making false
 charges of Communist infiltra-
 tion in the Cuban regime. Castro
 reiterated in his 17 July speech
 that neither he nor his govern-
 merit is dominated by Communists
 and that Cuba's new democratic
 ideals prohibit "persecution"
 of Communists.
 Communists quickly joined
 in the emotional public expres-
 sions of support for Castro and
 against Urrutia,   A party lead-
 er, declaring that the revolu-
 tion was in danger, called for
 the formation of a "truly revolu-
 tionary government" with Commu-
 nist participation,   Although
 Communists are unlikely at this
 time to be accepted into any
 government coalition, they have
 undoubtedly been encouraged by
 the events of the past week.
 There are indications that
 Raul Castro, who as armed forces
 chief has facilitated Communist
 penetration of the military, may
 have gained increased influence
 in the government with Urrutia's
 ouster.   Friction between Raul
 and Urrutia over government ap-
 pointments may have contributed
 to Urrutia's ouster, and Raul
 has attended cabinet meetings
 in -the past week, not the normal
 practice of military chiefs,        25X1

 brother's  heir  to  leader-
 ship  of  the  revolution
 PEIPING'S EFFORT TO ESTABLISH PROPAGANDA NETWORK IN LATIN AMERICA

 trying to develop a propaganda
 network in Latin America of lo-

 the delegation reportedly tried
 to hire local reporters in
 Uruguay.
 While in Uruguay, the dele-
 gation attended the opening of
 a Uruguayan-Chinese Friendship
 Society.   This makes the fifth
 such society in Latin America,
 and preparations are afoot to
 establish others, notably one in
 Colombia under the nominal lead-
 ership of the congressman who
 led the recent congressional
 delegation to the USSR and China.
 Peiping appears to be mak-
 ing Cuba a center for its propa-
 ganda activities in the area.
 It has already established a
 press office in Havana and  it
 plans to have the local Commu-
 nist press print  a Chinese-
 language newspaper.   The Chi-
 nese will probably also exploit
 the new Latin American Press
 Agency, which is penetrated by
 Communists and has editorial of-
 fices in the same building as
 NCNA's Havana bureau.
 The delegation of, Chinese
 "journalists" had an interview
 with Raul Castro during which
 he told them, according to Pei-
 ping radio, that among Latin
 American youths Mao Tse-tung is
 "one of the most respected fig-
 ures."  In alleging many similar-
 it:Les between Cuba and China,
 Raul Castro equated Chiang Kai-
 shok with Batista and added
 that the enemies of Cuba and
 ChiLna are supported by the "same
 international reaction."
 The "Journalists" have ex-
 ploited all opportunities to
 hint at the desirability of
 Cuban adoption of Chinese Commu-
 nist land-reform techniques;
 Peiping claims that at the.re-
 cent international land reform
 forum in Havana, the delegation
 was besieged by Latin American
 delegates with questions on this
 subject. Peiping will probably
 try to impress a Cuban women's
 delegation now visiting China
 with the applicability of Chi-

 to Cuba.
 ARGENTINE NAVAL OFFICERS THREATEN MASS RESIGNATIONS

 COMMUNIST ACTIVITY IN HONDURAS INCREASING
 The weak Communist party
 in Honduras has become increas-
 ingly active since 12 July when
 armed civilians and the military
 put down a revolt led by an in-
 veterate plotter wh.o_was sup-
 ported in the main by national
 police.   The Communists are ex-
 ploiting the long-standing civil
 military feud that has become
 intensified since the revolt and
 may be able to consolidate gains
 being made if President Villeda
 Morales does not act quickly'.to
 curtail their influence.   Hon-
 duras is not likely, 'however, 'to
 fall under Communist control in
 the foreseeable future.
 The role of the armed forces
 has long been a subject of con-
 troversy in Honduras. They con-
 sider themselves the guarantors
 of Honduran political institu-
 tions and have strenuously re-
 sisted:all attempts to encroach
 on their constitutionally en-
 dorsed status of autonomy within
 the government.  On the other
 hand, the administration Liberal
 party believes the civil govern-
 ment will never be secure until
 the military is brought under
 contrrol.   Even though the armed
 forces remained loyal during the
 12 July attempt, militant mem-
 bers of the Liberal party demand
 that the power of the army--which
 now 1.s responsible for supervis-
 ing the national police--must be
 drastically reduced.

 The :axit'i-mi'lit'ary- line has

 were armed by the government
 during the early hours of the

 their attempt to win influence

 the President's past hesitation
 to confront difficult situations
 with firmness suggests that he
 will take no effective action

 THE JAMAICAN ELECTION
 Jamaica's role in the year-
 old West Indies Federation is
 the main issue in the island's
 28 July general election.   This
 could be the decisive factor in
 determining the future of the
 Federation, since Jamaica is the
 largest and wealthiest unit in
 the organization.
 The Peoples National party
 (PNP), which controls the pres-

 Labor party (JLP), are the main
 contestants to fill the 45 seats

 The dominant figures in the cam-

 FINLAND AND AUSTRIA AND THE LITTLE FREE TRADE AREA
 Pravda's warning of 19 July
 on the dangers to Finnish neu-

 little Free Trade Area (FTA)

 from formally joining that group
 The Finns were warned that par-

 tions'.' would place them under
 the control of the United States.
 The Soviet warning may also
 complicate Austria's participa-
 tion for the same reasons.
 Finland's interest in join-
 ing any little FTA is motivated
 by a desire to preserve the com-
 petitive position of Finnish
 goods in Western European mar-
 kets; about 62 percent of Finn-
 ish exports in 1958 went to
 Western Europe.   The Finns have
 been concerned, however, over
 Moscow's reaction to their pro-
 posed participation and have
 sought to assure the USSR of
 Finland's good will and deter-
 mination to maintain the level
 of its trade with the Soviet
 bloc; this amounted to about 25
 percent of Finland's foreign
 trade in 1958.
 Finnish officials have pub-
 licly stated Finland would par-
 ticipate only in a purely eco-
 nomic organization without any
 political and supranational over-
 tones.   Finland's future moves
 will definitely be influenced
 by the USSR's attitude, since
 the present Finnish Government,
 including President Kekkonen,
 is not disposed to act contrary
 to explicit Soviet wishes.   The
 Finns may try to reach bilateral
 arrangements with the members
 of the new group in order to
 retain its markets in Western
 Europe.
 The Soviet warning will
 aggravate Vienna's problem in
 working out an acceptable re-
 lationship with the Common Mar-
 ket countries, which account
 for half of Austria's total
 trade.   Soviet officials have
 repeatedly warned the Austrians
 that association with the Common
 Market would be considered a
 violation of Austria's military
 neutrality law and have hinted
 that association even in con-
 cert with other countries would
 be objectionable.   Vienna has
 nevertheless clung to the hope
 that it might be able to par-
 ticipate in the broader European
 economic association which the
 little Free Trade Area is in-
 tended to promote.   Austria has
 little interest in the smaller
 grouping as such, which accounts
 for only 11 percent of Austria's
 foreign trade.

 The Soviet attack is not
 likely to deter the other "Outer
 Seven" countries from proceed-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUTARY
 23 July 1959
 During Khrushchev's visit
 to Poland from 14 to 23 July
 for the 15th anniversary of
 Poland's liberation from Nazi
 domination, he repeatedly spoke
 on topics which have a special
 appeal to the Polish people.
 The Soviet leader expressed his
 approval of party First Secre-
 tary Gomulka and his policy of
 independence in Poland's in-
 ternal affairs.  The Polish
 party, he said, holds firmly
 to the correct course toward
 the solution of the problems
 of "building socialism" in Po-
 land.  The Polish people's re-
 ception of Khrushchev has been
 calm and friendly, but marked
 more by curiosity than enthusi-
 asm.
 Khrushchev  in  numerous
 speeches played on the deeply
 ingrained    fear  of  renewed
 German aggression, apparently
 seeking to assuage the old
 anti-Russian feeling by empha-
 sizing the German danger.               He
 reassured the Poles that any
 future East-West agreements
 would contain the guarantee
 that Poland would retain the
 former German territories
 gained at the end of World War
 II.   In his speech at Szczecin
 Khrushchev appeared to reject
 the reunification of Germany
 and thus ease Polish apprehen-
 sions of a unified Germany on
 its Western border.   Pledging
 Moscow's support not only for
 the Oder-Neisse line but also
 for the existing border between
 East and West Germany "as if
 they were Soviet borders,'
 Khrushchev declared,  "We shall
 fight for that frontier
 against any foe who may try to
 encroach on it.,'
 Khrushchev categorically
 rejected the thesis that Po-
 land occupies a special place
 among the "socialist countries"
 because of differences in ap-
 proach                                                        to   internal problems.
 This thesis, he said, was ad-
 vanced by the imperialists in
 hope of tearing Poland away
 from the "socialist camp" and
 sowing distrust between the
 Polish people and the peoples
 of the other bloc countries.
 In. none of Khrushchev's
 public utterances has there
 been any indication of pressure
 on Poland to adhere more close-
 ly to the Soviet pattern. When
 Gomialka  declared in a speech
 at Rzeszow that "only we are
 responsible for everything
 that goes on in this country,"
 Khrushchev nodded, while star-
 ing impassively at the crowd.
 Khrushchev stated in a speech
 in Warsaw on 21 July that "one
 cannot demand that the Polish
 party, in solving any question
 of the internal life of Poland,
 pursue a policy which coincides
 fully with the policy of the
 Communist party of the Soviet
 Union.   Each people must build
 socialism and advance toward
 Communism by taking into con'
 sideration its national, cul-
 tural, and ideological peculiar-
 ities."
 The Soviet leader also en-
 dorsed 'Gomulka's policy of
 voluntary collectivization of
 agriculture, stressing that
 while collective farming is.
 the best way of organizing farm
 work, no one should be forced
 into joining a collective farm.
 He admitted that the reorgani-
 zation of agricultural produc-
 tion is a complicated process
 and that the USSR itself had
 encountered "no little diffi-
 culties on this road."
 Khrushchev voiced the most
 outspoken criticism of the com-
 mune system made so far in
 public by any high Soviet of-
 ficial in a speech to Polish
 peasants at a collective farm

 near Poznan from which Western
 newsmen were barred.   While he
 did not mention specifically the
 Chinese communes, Khrushchev
 told the Polish peasants the
 USSR has found through ex-
 perience that communes are the
 wrong way to start on the "road
 to socialism."  The Chinese will
 undoubtedly interpret Khrushchev's
 comments as implicit criticism of
 their communes and will prob-
 ably urge that Soviet opposition
 to them be kept in private
 channelso
 Turning to Polish internal
 party affairs, Khrushchev struck
 t both dogmatists and revision-
 ists within the Polish party,
 Khrushchev maintained that while
 revisionism remains the greatest
 danger, the dogmatists who opposed
 Gomulka's policies and at the same
 time claimed they were good friends
 of the Soviet Union were doing
 the party great harm.   Their
 activities could only lead to
 this weakening of the party and
 provide "nourishing soil for re-
 visionists and opportunists>"
 Those who oppose the policies
 of the party and Gomulka,
 Khrushchev declared, if not re-
 visionists themselves, are tools
 of the revisionists, and con-
 stitute a menace to the party.
 A threatening statement
 in the final communique calling
 for the end of the "occupation
 regime" in West Berlin, coupled
 with a pledge of Soviet and
 Polish support for East Germany
 in measures it might consider
 necessary "to liquidate the
 abnormal situation in West
 Berlin," was the only specific
 pronouncement on the Berlin
 problem during Khrushchev's tour,

 FORTHCOMING SOVIET CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM ON AGRICULTURE
 The USSR has announced that
 a plenum of the central commit-
 tee will be held in late Novem-
 ber and early December to con-
 sider progress under Khrushchev
 agricultural programs.   It will
 probably consider measures to
 increase agricultural output
 and labor productivity in view
 of the extremely ambitious
 Seven-Year-Plan goals for
 agriculture, the continuing
 problem of making further labor
 available to industry, and the
 harvest results this year, the-
 prospects for which now seem no
 more than average.
 The advance notification of
 time and agenda marks the second
 time this has been done--the
 first was for the June 1959
 plenum--and continues the prac-
 tice of publicizing central
 committee plenary sessions as
 propaganda forums for boosting
 Khrushchev's programs.
 A congress of collective
 farmers scheduled for early in
 1959 has not been held.   It
 seems likely that it was post-
 poned to await high-level res-
 oluti.on  of problems of agricul-
 tural organization.
 Discussion of agriculture
 in the central press in recent
 months indicates that various
 proposals by Khrushchev are
 being pushed.   With a view to
 improving the productivity of
 the kolkhoz system, more wide-
 spread use of the wage-payment
 system has been urged to replace
 the system now used by most
 kolkhozes>   This will make it
 easier to put collective farmers
 on a strict profit-and-loss basis
 and will bring the accounting of
 collective farms in line with
 that of state enterprises,   Addi-
 tionally, expansion of the in-
 divisible fund--capital assets

 the best source for capital to
 improve agricultural production
 through mechanization and for

 It will also supply capital
 for a progressive construction

 On organization topics,

 home stations conducting regi-
 mental-level tactical training.
 Activity during the last two
 months has included a large-
 scale command-post exercise, a
 weapons display, and a ten-day
 didisional exercise in June.
 The start' of the summer
 field-training period was high-
 lighted, as it was last year,
 by a large display of ground-
 forces equipment and demonstra-
 tions of its use of two of the
 major training areas during the
 first ten days of May.   The most
 significant event was the laying
 of a pipeline, without flota-
 tion equipment, across the Elbe
 River.   Mock-ups of American
 missiles were 'used as targets
 during strafing demonstrations.
 River-crossing demonstrations,
 including the use of amphibious
 equipment, were again  stressed
 this year.   During this period

 up to a higher standard.   Khru-
 shchev initiated this movement
 in his speech at the June 1959
 plenum.
 Organizational and admin-
 istrative changes in Soviet ag-
 riculture are also likely to
 be reviewed and appraised at
 the plenum.  The need to strength-
 en collective farms so as to
 make it economically feasible for
 them to purchase and operate their
 own machinery--now that the
 machine-tractor stations have
 been abolished--has resulted,
 through mergersg in a rapid de-
 cline in collective farms during
 the past 18 months.   Khrushchev
 stated in March 1958 there were
 about 78,000 collective farms
 at that time.   About a year later,
 he indicated the number had
 decreased to about 68,000.  The
 195EI semiannual plan fulfillment
 report indicated that the total
 number of. collective farms in
 the USSR on 1 July 1959 was a=

 Most of the six ground
 armies have conducted their own
 command-post exercises;,since
 last winter.   During early June
 the Soviet Union closed all of
 southern East Germany to Allied
 military missions and conducted
 its largest command-post exer-
 cise so far this year.   The ex-
 ercise was controlled by Head-
 quarters, GSFG, and involved
 the command and communications
 elements from at least five of
 the ground armies and their
 organic line divisions.   It is
 believed that there was only
 minor troop participation.
 From 12 through 22 June,
 major elements of the Twentieth
 Guards Army left their home
 stations in the Berlin area and
 conducted a divison-size exer-
 cise, including a crossing of
 the Elbe River.   This exercise
 was similar to one conducted by
 this army in March 1958.
 It is expected that the
 scope and tempo of field  ma-
 neuvers will increase during the
 summer, culminating with exer-
 cises involving whole armies
 during September and October.
 After that, about one third of
 GSFG's 315,000-man-force--the
 throe-year men--will be rotated
 home.  The next training year
 will then commence as their
 places are taken by recruits.
 RUMANIAN REGIME PLANS TO RAISE WORKERS' LIVING STANDARDS
 In a report to a plenum of
 the Rumanian party central com-
 mittee, First Secretary Gheor,-~
 ghiu-Dej announced that the,re-
 gime will raise the low living
 standard of the workers and
 create incentives to help meet
 the demands of the new six-year
 plan (1960-65).   This announce-
 ment may also be intended to
 mitigate the effects of recent
 political repression.   The meas-
 ure will bring Rumanian condi-
 tions more in conformity with
 those in. the satellites which
 have been able to provide an
 increase in the standard of liv-
 ing during the last few years.
 This program is to be ac-
 complished by an average in,,. r;
 crease of 10 percent in wages,
 price reductions on 2,600 in-
 dustrial and food items, income
 tax reductions, and an average
 50-percent increase in pensions.
 Workers in the lower wage brack-
 ets will receive the highest
 wage increases--20 to 30 per-
 cent.   Foremen, who will spur
 the next productivity drive,
 are to receive highest rates
 among the better paid groups.
 All of these benefits may add
 to an increase in real income of
 15 percent or more, which would
 fulfill the 1960 wage plan in
 1959.   The need for such drastic
 action, however, tends to con-
 tradict earlier statements by
 Gheorghiu-Dej that the Rumanian
 standard of living had increased
 26 percent between 1955 and the
 end of 1958.
 Benefits mentioned in the
 announcement are almost entirely
 for the urban worker.   The pen-
 sion increases apply to several
 additional categories, but ex-
 clude most peasants, who have
 yet to be pensioned.   Peasants
 are told to be content with the
 boost in living standards they
 received in 1957, when prices
 for produce were raised .and
 compulsory produce deliveries
 were abandoned.   These benefits
 are undoubtedly exaggerated,..

 be necessary to counterbalance

 Czechoslovakia offered to

 WEST AFRICAN MEETING
 The first meeting of the
 leaders of West Africa's three
 independent nations--Liberia,
 Ghana, and Guinea--in Sanniquel-
 lie, Liberia, ended on 20 July
 with agreement in principle on
 a proposed Community of Inde-
 pendent African States to be dis-
 cussed at a larger conference in
 1960.   A nine-state conference
 of foreign ministers is'to be
 held at Monrovia in' early August;
 it is expected to consider,a
 number of controversial prob-
 lems, such as the Algerian.and
 Cameroun situations,
 President Tubman of Liberia,
 Prime Minister Nkrumah of Ghana,
 and President Tourd of Guinea
 met in an effort to reconcile
 their opposing views.   Tubman,
 who distrusts the militant Af-
 rican nationalism espoused by
 Nkrumah and Tourd,has favored
 a loose association of states
 cooperating in economic, cul-
 tural, and health matters but
 preserving their own political
 identities.   Nhrumah, on the
 other hand, envisions a union
 under one flag, with common for-
 eign policy and defense arrange-
 ments.
 The discussions,the initial
 sessions of which were reported
 to be chilly and constrained,ap-
 pear to have resulted in a Tub-
 man victory and a setback to
 Nkrumah. Tourd, who reportedly
 desires to negotiate an agree-
 ment with Liberia to permit the
 shipment of Guinean iron ore
 through Liberian ports, gave Tub-
 man. increasing support as the
 talks progressed.   Tubman's
 keynote address stressed that
 any definitive arrangement
 must await the independence
 in 1960 of Cameroun, Nigeria,
 and Togo--all of which are now
 governed by moderate groups.
 A declaration issued by
 the three leaders after their
 talks proposed a larger con-
 ference next year to organize
 a "Community of Independent Af-
 rican States" to be based on

 23 July 1959
 The situation has been made
 worse by the anticipated loss
 of $26,000,000 in expected oil
 revenues resulting from cuts in
 oil prices.   Although the con-
 sortium of Western companies
 operating Iran's nationalized
 oil industry has increased out-
 put sharply in an effort to ease
 the loss of revenue, production
 this year probably will fall
 short of the 1,000,000 barrels-
 a-day average the government
 feels is essential.
 On the labor front unem-
 ployment is high and a serious
 strike in the oil fields was
 averted only by a government-
 sponsored wage and fringe bene-
 fit settlement. The basic causes
 of discontent remain.
 The present crisis reflects
 a number of short-term difficul_
 ties, including low agricultural
 output and excessive land specu-
 lation for which the government
 is planning administrative reme-
 dies.   The Shah, for example,

 the rise in government spending
 at a rate faster than the growth

 Increasing Exports
 While the USSR expects to
 double the rate of production
 of crude oil during the Seven-
 Year Plan, domestic consumption
 during this period is not ex-
 pected to increase as much.
 Thus surplus production and more
 efficient refining practices
 are expected to give the USSR
 an exportable surplus of about
 960,000 b/d by 1965--more than
 three times the 1958 level.
 .   Exports of petroleum to
 the other countries of the Sino-
 Soviet bloc are expected to ac-
 count for about 400,000 b/d in
 1965,  leaving 560,000 b/d avail-
 able for export to the free world.
 Allowing for Soviet deliveries

 own resources, sell Western Eu-
 rope 400,000 b/d of crude, 8
 percent of the estimated minimum
 5,000,000 b/d Western Europe
 will need at that time.
 Even this small share of
 the European market could, through
 uneven distribution, affect some
 Western European countries sub-
 stantially.   In 1958 the USSR
 supplied 75 percent of the oil
 imports to Iceland and over 50
 percent of those to Finland. So-
 viet oil available for export
 to Western Europe by 1965 is ex-
 pected to be more than 25 per-
 cent of the import requirements
 of the Scandinavian and Benelux
 countries and West Germany--an
 area which could readily be
 served from the export base
 being; developed at Klaipeda
 (Memel).   The USSR could gain a
 dominant position as
 the oil supplier of
 one or more of these
 countries.
 In 1958, the USSR
 sold 122,000 b/d worth
 $131,000,000 to West-
 ern Europe.   If the
 price of petroleum is
 maintained at the 1958
 level and if Soviet
 exports of petroleum
 to Western Europe in-
 crease in 1965 to 400,-
 000 b/d, the value of
 this trade to the
 USSR will be $430,-
 000,000 by then.

 Plans for Pipelines
 Pipelines will not only
 permit increased deliveries but
 also will reduce transport costs
 and thus the over-all costs of
 crude oil and products.   One
 westward branch will extend a
 line to Poland and East Germany
 and another line to Czechoslo-
 vakia and Hungary.                  Another,
 branch, terminating at Klaipeda
 on the Baltic Sea, will handle
 exports to. Western Europe and
 the Scandinavian countries, Both
 of these branches may be tied
 in with lines servicing the
 western USSR.
 Completion dates depend
 largely on the extent of West-
 ern support available; the USSR
 is now seeking engineering ad-
 vice and pipe from Sweden for
 construction of at least that
 branch of the system designed to
 supply oil to Western Europe.
 The quant,.,ties of petro-
 leum to be transported by the
 new branches of the pipeline
 system are large enough to jus-
 tify, on an economic basis, the
 use of large pipe, more than
 24 inches in outside diameter.
 However, the United States, the
 only country with enough capacity
 in large-diameter piping to
 meet requirements, prohibits
 the export of large-diameter pipe
 to the bloc.  Consequently the
 USSR may be planning more than
 one parallel line of 20- or 24-
 inch pipe.   Western European
 countries have already been ap-
 proached for pipe of these di-
 ameters,

 FRANCE'S DEFENSE MOBILIZATION PROBLEMS
 France is undertaking a
 reorganization of its defense
 system and a modernization of
 its armed forces in line with
 new French strategic and tac-
 tical concepts.  Military lead-
 ers are taking steps to con-
 vert French divisions into
 small, highly mobile striking
 forces designed to combat
 "brush-fire" wars either with-
 in the French Community or,
 with a view to De Gaulle's de-
 mands for a greater role in
 Western global strategy, any-
 where in the world.  This plan-
 ning is more in keeping with
 national than with NATO require-
 ments.           While the reorganiza-
 tion is well suited to French
 needs in North Africa, the pro-
 tracted and costly Algerian
 fighting pre-empts funds and
 resources which would be re-
 quired for the modernization
 program.
 Reorganization
 A comprehensive overhaul-
 ing of the entire French defense
 structure has been accelerated
 under De Gaulle in terms of the
 missions, organization, and
 equipment of the individual
 armed services.  The defense
 reorganization embodied in de-
 crees issued last January rests
 on three premises:  (1) "defense"
 permeates every aspect of na-
 tional life;  (2) the distinc-
 tion between states of "peace"
 and "war" is dwindling; and (3)
 the executive must have suffi-
 cient authority and a suffi-
 ciently flexible defense or-
 ganization to deal with what-
 ever form a national threat may
 take.
 A new category of national
 "defense service," supplementing
 normal active military service,
 was created to meet emergency
 needs not of a strictly military
 nature.   During a general mobili-
 Zat:ion  or partial "alerts,"
 property can be requisitioned
 and citizens drafted for service.
 The Defense Committee,
 closely resembling in composi-
 tion and responsibilities the
 National Security Council of
 the United States, has been es-
 tablished to determine defense
 policies for France and the
 French  Community.    The

 Constitution of the Fifth Re-
 public has enhanced the presi-
 dent's responsibilities in de-
 fense matters, and the military
 has direct access to him.          The
 chief of staff, General Ely,
 now reports directly to the
 president and the premier rath-
 er than through a defense min-
 ister.
 Nationalism Conflict
 Considerations of national
 prestige seem likely to steer
 France's modernization of its
 armed forces away from common
 Western defense concepts em-
 bodied in NATO.        De Gaulle is
 more interested in achieving
 self-sufficient national armed
 services oriented toward both
 the European and global in-
 terests of France.
 The French desire for a
 nationally controlled nuclear
 deterrent has led to increased
 spending on items duplicated
 within NATO.   Thus France has
 persisted in pushing a costly
 nuclear weapons program; it is
 developing an attack-bomber for
 carrying nuclear weapons, as
 well as missiles adapted to
 nuclear warheads, rather than
 concentrating on badly needed
 all-weather interceptors; and
 it has sacrificed some of the
 submarine and escort vessel
 construction desired by NATO in
 favor of an expensive new air-
 craft carrier program.
 A more serious divergence
 of views is apparent in French
 ideas on army reorganization.
 Citing their experience in In-
 dochina and Algeria, French
 Armor planners now stress the
 desirability of replacing the
 present French NATO divisions
 in Europe with small, highly
 mobile ground striking forces
 capable of intervening rapidly
 anywhere in the French Community
 or at remote points where "brush
 fires" warrant attention.  These
 striking forces would be backed
 up by large local reserves capa-
 ble of rapid mobilization and
 trained primarily to combat an-
 ticipated Communist guerrilla
 and sabotage action.
 Both Marshal Juin, the
 "voice of the army," and air
 force General Challe, the su-
 preme commander in Algeria ,have
 hailed the French Army organi-
 zation and tactics for opera-
 tions against guerrillas there
 as patterns which Western armed
 forces should adopt to prepare
 for the most likely form of
 hostilities.  This runs counter
 to present NATO planning in its
 tendency to stress national mis-
 sions and national control.

 23 July 1959
 Modernization vs. Algeria
 Overshadowing French mod-
 ernization plans for the indi-
 vidual armed services is the
 detrimental effect of the four-
 and-a-half -year-old Algerian
 war.   The. army has suffered
 from attrition of arms and
 equipment and from the dispers-
 al of the French NATO-committed
 divisions from Europe into
 small units for garrisoning and
 conducting operations against
 guerrilla groups.  The fact
 that approximately half of
 France's army--including 10 of
 its 14 NATO-committed divi-
 sions-~-is 'in Algeria would seri-
 ously disrupt full French mo-
 bilization.   Major French Army
 participation in large-scale
 NATO maneuvers has virtually
 ended.
 French Air Force readiness
 in Europe has been affected ad-
 versely as a result of thewith-
 drawal to Algeria of many  pi-
 lots and technicians.  The
 military aircraft industry has
 been kept going primarily by
 foreign orders, and several
 promising aircraft research
 and development programs have
 been severely cut back or elim-
 inated,  The navy has been the
 least directly affected of all
 the services, but budgetary
 cuts have crippled its new
 construction programs.
 Some senior
 pro-NATO officers apparently
 fear France risks    having
 outmoded armed forces'.in several
 years, both because of inade-
 quate funds for new weapons
 development and production,and
 because its army will not be
 organized in pentomic divisions
 for nuclear  warfare
 Economic Aspects

 between modernization and  the

 over the form modernization
 should take are heavily influ-

 Algerian operations which for-

 has in practice facilitated in-

 the Algerian campaign at the

 IMPLICATIONS OF SPAIN'S ECONOMIC STABILIZATION PROGRAM
 The Franco regime is taking
 a calculated risk with the pro-
 gram recently adopted to reorient
 and stabilize the Spanish econ-
 omy.   The program on 20 July
 brought Spain full membership
 in the organization of European
 Economic Cooperation (OEEC) and
 extensive financial assistance
 from the United States and in-
 ternational lending organiza-
 tions,   The Spanish public, how-
 ever, fears that the stabiliza-
 tion program will aggravate
 rather than remedy the present
 economic situation and that the
 austerity called for by the plan
 may have serious political re-
 percussions.   Failure of the
 program would probably set off
 a new inflationary cycle and
 cause widespread popular unrest,
 posing a serious challenge to
 Franco's position.
 The Stabilization Program
 Since mid-February Spanish
 Government officials have ne-
 gotiated with experts of the
 OEEC and International Monetary
 Fund (IMF) on a program designed
 to help Spain achieve internal
 financial stability, redress
 its deteriorating balance-of-
 payments position, and qualify
 for full OEEC membership.   The
 program calls for a reduction
 in public expenditures, restric-
 tions on the extension of bank
 credit in the private sector,
 elimination of price and trade
 controls, removal of curbs on a pri-
 vate, foreign investment, and a. unified
 exchange rate for the peseta--
 which has been devaluated from
 42 to 60 to the dollar.
 Spain has agreed to liberal-
 ize its imports gradually, free-
 ing most imports of raw materials
 and foodstuffs from quota re-
 strictions,and to convert by
 stages most of its trading ar-
 rangements with OEEC countries
 from a bilateral to a multilateral
 basis.
 In return for these reforms,
 Spain isto receive a "package"
 of outside aid to help it meet
 balance-of-payments needs' and
 to bolster confidence in the
 currency during the first six

 United States will supply an

 Official Government Attitude
 Spain's reform program is
 a tacit admission that its
 previous economic policies have
 failed to halt inflationary
 pressures and that a broad re-
 orientation of the economy is
 now necessary to hasten Spain's
 adjustment to conditions pre-
 vailing elsewhere in Western
 Europe--particularly the trend
 toward freer trade and full
 convertibility of currencies.;
 The regime has not yet
 moved to inspire popular con-
 fidence in the program, however,
 and has not yet issued a clear
 statement on the program's
 objectives and implications.
 Franco himself,  although said
 to be fully in favor of the pro-
 gram, has avoided a public com-
 mitment of support, perhaps to
 escape personal blame for hard-
 ships it. is likely to impose on
 industry and labor.
 Recent pronouncements on
 the stabilization program by
 Commerce Minister Ullastres and
 Finance Minister Navarro Rubio
 have contained inconsistencies
 and omissions and have side-
 stepped the more controversial
 aspects, thereby tending to
 increase public apprehension.
 On 1 June Ullastres stated that
 stabilization could be achieved
 without harsh repercussions on
 production and employment, and
 that the program would make
 better living standards possible.
 He denied that internal demand
 would drop, although he antici-
 pated some price increases and
 economic dislocations, and made
 no direct promises of aid for
 firms faced with reduced sales.
 Both ministers have been
 less than candid regarding credit
 curbs.   Ullastres has publicly
 denied that private bank credit
 is now being restricted.   Rubio
 stated on 9 June that during
 19591, credit would not be reduced
 below the 1958 level but would
 be expanded by $262,000,000 in
 the private sector.   This figure
 actually would represent a re-
 duced rate of expansion, however,
 since in 1958 credit grew by
 $500,000,000.
 Reaction of Economic Groups
 Banking and business cir-
 cles are fearful that the pro-
 gram's austerity measures will
 slow rather than stimulate eco-
 nomic activity.   They are par-
 ticularly concerned that credit
 curbs will put even relatively
 efficient enterprises out of
 business and, force a general
 curtailment of production.   These
 groups point out that during the
 past year many firms, faced with
 declining sales and yet obliged
 to keep permanent workers on
 the payroll, have accumulated
 large inventories and eliminated
 overtime work.   Restrictions
 on credit are likely to force
 these manufacturers to suspend
 operations.   A temporary short-
 age of funds has already obliged
 a number of firms to suspend
 payments to creditors.
 Labor, which has increas-
 ingly, felt the pinch of rising
 living costs since the last
 general wage boost late in 1956,
 is apprehensive of further re-
 ductions in overtime pay and
 further layoffs of temporary
 workers.   Such cutbacks,  togeth-
 er with the government's opposi-
 tion to general wage increases
 despite rising prices,  led to
 strikes in depressed industries
 in the Barcelona area in May.

 lization program will depend

 largely on the government's abil-
 ity   to resist pressure from
 various sources for a modifica-
 tion of its "austerity" aspects
 and a return to deficit financ-
 ing- as an easier and more popu-
 lar approach to industrial de-
 velopment.   Refusal of the gov-
 ernment to continue with any of
 the specified reforms would
 probably bring a threat from the
 .IMF and the,OEEC to withhold
 further financial aid.
 The American Embassy in
 Madrid feels the program has
 too great an imbalance between
 expenditures in the public
 and private sectors of the econ-
 omy.                  With a'ceiling of $1.905
 billion imposed on 1959 public
 expenditures--an increase of
 $119,000,000 over the amount
 spent in 1958--and private in-
 vestment expenditures expected
 to decrease from one billion
 dollars in 1958 to about $762,-
 000,000 as a result of credit
 curbs, the belt tightening is
 all in the private sector.  The
 embassy points out that the cut
 in private 'sector .expenditures
 may create dislocations unless
 austerity measures in some-areas
 are combined with measures to
 stimuate demand for current pro-
 duction'of other areas
 Too sharp effects on the
 private sector, such as reduced
 sales, cuts in overtime, further
 layoffs, and a sharp rise in
 prices, would probably force the
 government to scuttle the pro-
 gran and grant a general wage
 increase.   The resulting new
 inflationary cycle would ag-
 gravate hostility to the regime
 among opposition groups, labor,
 and small businessmen.   Any
 indication that the country was
 approaching economic chaos could
 well impel Franco's main props--
 the army, church, big bankers,
 industrialists, and landowners--
 to withdraw their support.   Seri-
 ous popular unrest might impel
 top military leaders to seek       25X1
 Franco's removal in order to
 forestall a complete collapse
 of public order.
 SOVIET ARCHITECTS TAKEN TO TASK
 A dispute'concerning archi-
 tectural design in the Soviet
 Union has emerged in the Soviet
 press for the first time since
 the 1954-1955 period, when Khru-
 shchev condemned the elaborate
 style of Stalin's day and sup-
 ported'the standardized func-
 tional designs which character-
 ize Soviet architecture today.
 Soviet architectural theoreti-
 cians evidently are trying to
 find some way to reconcile the
 regime's desire for inexpensive
 standardized styles with the
 need for individual expression
 felt by many architects.
 The disagreement has appar-
 ently become important enough
 for the regime to issue indirect
 warnings that architects must
 remain within specified bounds.
 The May issue of Architecture
 USSR directed architects to
 stop "contemplating Western
 styles" and work out a "truly
 scientific" style, and Khrushchev
 took architects to task in his
 speech at Kiev the same month.
 The two sides of the dis-
 pute are sharply illustrated in
 two recent issues of the Soviet
 architectural journal, one in
 May which is devoted entirely
 to the dull standard construc-
 tion endorsed by the state,
 whereas the March issue features
 imaginative sketches of both

 housing and industrial construc-
 tion by architectural students
 in Moscow.   These designs would
 be considered unusual and ex-
 pensive in the West.
 The May issue scores the
 error of "finding the highest
 form of architecture in the im-
 perialist countries" and the
 failures of some designers to
 incorporate the views of Marx
 and Lenin in their efforts. The
 line is sharply drawn between
 what can and cannot  be done.
 Soviet architects and builders
 are urged to study present-day
 foreign experience in the de-
 velopment and use of advanced
 methods and materials in con-
 struction, but are also told
 "no one at any time has directed
 Soviet architects to adopt the
 styles and artistic qualities of
 23 JULY 19b9
 contemporary Western architec-
 ture.
 This recent attack on West-
 ernism is focused on a Soviet
 work entitled "The Basic Theory
 of Soviet Architecture," pub-
 lished in late 1958. Despite
 the author's cautious approach
 in praising certain Western de-
 velopments and in stating that
 something could be learned from
 the West, he is attacked in a
 heavy-handed way in Architecture
 USSR by a fellow architect o -
 vlouisly stating the party's
 views.
 A more immediate source of
 annoyance to the Soviet regime
 than the theoretical study, how-
 ever,, may well be the contents
 of the March 1959 issue of Archi-
 tecture USSR.   That issue was

 tectural designs of apartment
 houses and individual houses
 drawn up by architectural stu-
 dents, and it included some in-
 stitutional and industrialstruc-
 tures closely resembling contem-
 porary Western designs.
 This presentation contrasts
 sharply with most past issues
 of this journal.   In the first
 part of the February. issue, for
 example, there were sketches
 of apartment houses with asbes-
 tos-cement walls--the material
 used in the World War II tempo-
 rary buildings in Washington--
 and the January issue featured
 the usual sketches of block and
 panel construction.   In the past;,

 ready exceeding plans.   Speak-
 ing on construction in May,.
 Khrushchev said, "Many of. our
 architects still do not under-
 stand fully the tasks facing
 them.   They do not always,give
 good advice."  During his tour
 of the American exhibit under
 construction in Moscow, he dis-
 played interest in the construc-
 tion techniques being used,
 particularly those for the.
 geodesic dome of the central
 pavilion.,
 the appearance of contemporary
 designs in Architecture USSR
 has coincide  with special oc-
 casions, such as the World
 Festival of Youth and Students
 held in Moscow in 1957 and the
 Congress of the International
 Union of Architects, also in
 Moscow, in 1958.   It is possible
 that the Brussels Fair provided
 the stimulus for the March 1959
 issue.
 That issue was undoubtedly
 objectionable to the more con-
 servative faction of Soviet ar-
 chitects.   Khrushchev.apparent-
 l.y felt it necessary.to warn
 architects indirectly not to
 gaze longingly at Western de-
 signs when every effort should
 be made to carry out the USSR's
 present large-scale housing pro-
 Khrushchev has had to deal
 with architects before..  He took
 strong measures in 1954 and 1955
 to subdue certain architects
 who were accused of violating
 the party and government line.
 Then, as now, the line called
 for the simplification of de-
 signs in order that buildings
 would be more functional,cheaper,
 and suitable for industrial
 methods of construction, al-
 though the line then represented
 a step toward Western practice
 and away from the old-fashioned
 ornateness of Stalin's era.
 The earlier dispute reached
 a peak at the Builders'. Confer-
 ence of December 1954, when
 Khrushchev outlined his position
 on the issue.  Following the
 general adoption of his recom-
 mendations, a meeting of archi-
 tects was held in the fall of
 195;5 during which there was con-
 siderable feeling expressed on
 the part of a group of undetermined

 size which opposed parts of the
 scheme--apparently those parts
 which confined them to the job
 of grinding out standardized de-
 signs.   In a decree of November
 1955, extravagances in architec-
 tural design and construction
 were cited as being deviations
 from established Soviet policy.
 Leading architects were dis-
 missed, others sharply repri-
 manded, and all design organi-
 zations sternly warned to ad-
 here to the party line.
 The main target of the de-
 cree was unnecessary expendi-
 tures on exteriors of buildings,
 especially housing in Moscow.
 "Millions of square meters of
 housing" could have been built
 with the resources used in the
 construction of unessential
 columns, cornices, and towers,
 it was stated.   Architects were
 instructed to concentrate on
 providing more living area and
 to work out designs suitable
 for mass production techniques.
 Models of public buildings shown
 at the Soviet exhibit in New
 York nonetheless show that, de-
 spite criticism, these same fail-
 ings of Soviet architecture per-
 sist.
 Although some architects
 undoubtedly chafed at such
 assignments, until recent
 months there had been no sign
 that disagreements between
 the state and architects were
 again  of   significant pro-
 portions.                                                                   The recent intensi-
 ty of the discussions con-
 cerning architectural policy
 may be related to the fact
 that the present expanded
 housing construction program
 is apparently scheduled to
 level off at a plateau after
 1960.   Since it would take
 Soviet builders several years
 to develop the techniques re-
 quired for construction along
 contemporary lines, certain
 architects may be lobbying
 for consideration of these
 designs now n
 No significant shift to
 contemporary designs could be
 contemplated seriously before
 1960, however, if then, since
 the present big push in hous-
 ing construction is under way
 and building costs are not
 being reduced as planned. Shifts  25X1
 to contemporary designs would
 increase costs substantially
