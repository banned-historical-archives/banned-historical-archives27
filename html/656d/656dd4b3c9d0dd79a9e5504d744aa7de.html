 CPW Report No. 15 - COMMUNIST CHINA
 (Mar. 24 - 30, 1952)
 Preliminary examination of Chinese Communist broadcasts to the Chinese people in the
 week ending Mar. 30 leaves the impression that the anticorruption drive is in a
 thoroughly confused state.I Radio broadcasts and exhibits to promote the drive were
 reported by several broadcasting stations, with one newspaper quoted as urging more
 rallies.  Confession and, accusation meetings, though principally confined to special
 groups, seemed to be on the increase, with the established pattern--accusation-
 confession-pardon, or aclcusatlon-denial of guilt-arrest--being maintained.  Orders
 and regulations for disposing of corruption,cases, however, were issued by Peking
 several weeks ago, numerous cadres have been removed from the drive to push normal
 production, and indications of a strong urge to dispose of corruption cases and close
 the drive have been evident for some time.
 Side by side with this belated promotion of the anticorruption drive in some quarters
 were reports of wholesale 'adjudication of cases in accordance with the regulations
 laid down by Peking, anti of minor offenders being pardoned by the hundreds.  Even
 persons guilty of corruption involving as much as 100 million yuan were pardoned
 provided they confessedIt1ieir guilt and refunded the money illegally obtained.  This
 attempt at rapid adjudication met with serious difficulties in some quarters.
 To further speed up the adjudication proceedings, Peking announced new regulations
 for setting up special tribunals in cities and hsien where the number of violators
 was high.  These special courts would have power to "arrest, try, and punish," but
 cases involving punishment', by death or 10 or more years of imprisonment were to be
 reviewed by the hsien or municipal Government.  Cases involving firms classified as
 law-abiding or semi-law'iabiding were to be handled entirely by the Austerity Committee,
 but these defendants could appeal their cases to the special tribunal.

 In the organization of the special courts, too, confusion was apparent, with one
 station announcing the organization of a "temporary People's Court," another the
 setting up of a "summary court," both of which could possibly be the same as the
 special tribunal outlined by Peking.  A third station, however, reported the setting
 up of a "summary court," which tried a number of cadres for corruption and sentenced
 four to "immediate execution," which would seem to be in direct conflict with Peking
 rules forlthe special tribunals.
 Some degree of clarification was obtained in a Peking report of a statement made
 by Shanghai Mayor Chen'I to the local Increased Production and Economy Committees--
 the committees originally set up to conduct the drive to increase production and
 eliminate waste, prior' to organization of the Austerity Committees for directing the
 anticorruption drive.  Mayor Chen announced formal initiation in Shanghai of the
 five-antis campaign against private businessmen to eliminate bribery, tax evasion,
 embezzlement of Government' property, cheating on contracts, and stealing of Government
 economic information.  Inroads of capitalists into the Party and the working class
 were said to be better' planned and organized in Shanghai than in other parts of China.
 There thei"techniques of aitack" are smarter, and therefore the success of the five-
 anti's drive in the Nation hinges on its success in Shanghai.
 First mention of the five-anti's campaign was heard in a Shanghai broadcast Feb. 3.
 Since then it had been mentioned frequently, but was overshadowed by the anticorrup-
 tion drive, with its confession and accusation meetings and tiger hunts.  Apparently
 all previous, reference to the five-anti's drive was premature, as the big drive
 against corrupt capitalists, the true five-anti's drive, was not supposed to start
 until thelspectacular but less vital drive against waste, corruption, and bureaucracy
 was in the process of being closed.
 However, despite his vigorous denunciation of vicious capitalists, who would challenge
 even the People's Government, Mayor Chen was careful to point out that the five-
 anti's drive is not aimed at "liquidation of the capitalist class," like, for example,
 the land'refbrm struggle, rW$TM' aims at "liquidation of the landlord class."  It is
 only the '!harmful actic.,a of the capitalist class" which are to be eliminated.
 Capitalists who accept the leadership of the Communist Party will continue to "engage
 in legal business and reap legal profits."  The revolution still is dependent on the
 union of the three classes- workers, peasants, and petty bourgeois.  Actually, accord-
 ing to Chen, the vicious capitalists that must be punished make up only about 5 per-
 cent of the total.  Through their elimination by the five-anti's campaign the
 capitalist class itself will be the big gainer.  This new drive, Mayor Chen declared,
 must be orderly, and must be entirely in the hands of the Increased Production and
 Economy Committees. "False examiners" must be punished; in other words there will be
 no wild accusations and hysterical meetings.  What Chen is suggesting is that the
 anticorruption campaign was a noisy, unruly, rabble-rousing affair that often got
 completely' out of hand. The new drive will be kept under rigid control.
 Further evidence that certain Communist leaders fear the anticorruption campaign went
 too far ire alienating the capitalist class, which the Government still needs and is
 not yet ready to liquidate, was shown in numerous broadcasts concerning the relation-
 ship between private business and State-owned concerns.  Government companies
 apparently were going out of their way to give business to private firms damaged or
 closed by Ithe anticorruption drive.  Evidence'also was unmistakable that the anti-
 corruption drive had done considerable damage.  Hangchow in particular revealed a
 number of instances in which business and production were at a complete standstill
 as a result of the drive, while similar testimony came from regional broadcasting
 stations in the Northeast, the Southwest, and Foochow, in Fukien Province.
 Reports of actual resistance to the anticorruption drive were not numerous, and
 generally were less spectacular than in the past.  However, there were charges of
 continued oppro'sion of workers and the closing down of business houses.  Workers and
 cadres still were often described as being "lax" or "reluctant," and "indoctrination"
 was resorted to in many, cases to get action, but senior clerks and accountants seem-
 ingly were lcausing less' of a problem than in the past.  There was a slight drop in

 number of reported arrests for corruption, Avid few of the cases were spectacular or
 of major import. Sixteen firms were said to have handicapped the, Huai River project
 through their corrupt dealings, and East China shipbuilders were said to have robbed
 the Government of large sums through cheating on contracts.  Arrests of public officials
 for corruption seemed to be about normal, with some in rather high positions exposed
 in Chenchiang and Tsinan, while Nanchang reported the expulsion of the Kiangsi Party
 Committee's chief of propaganda.
 Reports of famine, threats of famine, and distribution of relief food  came from
 Kiangsi, Hupeh, Hunan, Kwangtung, Szechwan, Hainan Island, and Fukien, with Foochow
 in the last-named province again standing out as the East China city with the highest
 living costs.  Damage to early crops through floods and heavy rain also was reported.
 Considerable stress was placed on spring farming activities, with cadres again ordered
 in some areas to forget the anticorruption drive and give their attention to the farm
 program.  In some areas middle-class farmers were reported to be without seed and
 farming tools, supposedly because they had made loans to poor farmers which could
 not be repaid. Rural cadres received their normal portion of blame for farm
 difficulties, but the peasants themselves were not blameless.     I
 Peking continued to accuse the United States of using bacteriological warfare, both
 in Korea and in Northeast China, and made much of the report of the International
 Association of Democratic Lawyers.  Relatively little comment came from the regional
 stations, though an occasional broadcast reported a protest by some group, including
 "blind workers" in Dairen.  There also was an apparent falling off of interest in
 organizing to combat bacteriological warfare, with not one announcement monitored of
 medical volunteers for Korea.  Charges that Chinese contractors damaged the efforts
 of the Chinese Volunteeie.were few, and ?etails were lacking.  Attention to preferential
 treatment for dependents  o" servicemen  was somewhat greater than during recent weeks,
 but principally in connection with the bpring production drive.
 Considerable resistance to land reform, both from landlords and farmers, was reported
 from Kiangsi and Yunnan, while Wuhsi announced that a Shanghai editor had been
 dismissed for "sabotaging land reform."
 Peking told of a trade -team organized by a State-operated comparylin Tsinghai'Province
 which penetrated into two towns of Tibet and carried on a brisk trade with the
 natives.  The Tibetans were said to have "pinned up Chairman Mao's portrait," and
 to have "ardently loved" the trade team.  However, the team used 30 guards with
 rifles and horses furnished by a local chief for their protection.

 Promotion of Drive.  The Anshan radio announced (Mar. 28) that an on-the-spot anti-
 corruption rally would be broadcast Mar. 29 under the auspices of the local Austerity
 Committee.  Listening groups were asked to file reception reports and were given
 seven te'l'ephone numbers where they could phone urgent comments.  Chungking announced

 heightened" by the anticorruption exhibit held at Huainan Mar. 26, which showed
 specimens of fake drugs, gold and other bribery items, documents on theft of economic
 information, and ways of defrauding the Government.  Wuhsi stated (Mar. 26) that
 more than 60,000 persons already had seen the anticorruption exhibit at Wuhsien,
 and after visiting the exhibit the workers "detganded severe punishment for corrupt
 merchants who defrauded the Government and injured the Chinese Volunteers."

 Kaifeng declared (Mari. 27) that an article in the HONAN JIH PAO showed how the anti-
 corruption drive promoted the political consciousness of the people and gave them a
 better understanding of the tenets of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Tse-tung Is theories.
 The edit'rial also called upon workers to organize more meetings, "so they not only
 would educate the masses, but also themselves," and emphasized the role of shop
 clerks in the anticorruption.         Canton reported (Mar. 25) that Chen Yu-min, a
 14-year-old student in the Chenkuang Junior High School, had written a letter accusing
 her uncle, merchant Chiu Te-ling, of corruption, "because she wanted to become a
 Mao Tse-tung student."  Kunming asserted (Mar. 25) that since Kuo Chi-ming, accountant
 in the Yunnan Department of Finance, had been pardoned following a full confession to
 charges of corruption, he was improving his working efficiency "in order to redeem
 himself ."
 Confession and Accusation Meetings.  Chinese regional broadcasting stations, in the
 period under review, gave more attention to reports of accusation and confession
 meetings than in any other period during the past month.  Anshan reported (Mar. 26)
 that at a rally Mar. 22 major corrupt elements Tan Tai-ho, Yung Yu-kuei, and Liu
 Min-shan confessed and were pardoned, "after indoctrination by workers of the Anshan
 Metal Works," while 65 persons accused of minor corruption also were pardoned.
 Shanghai announced (Mar. 25)!-that 3,000 persons attended a rally called by the
 Shanghai Austerity Committee to hear Mayor Chen I report on the anticorruption drive
 and announce eight regulations for conducting the drive.  Shanghai added (Mar. 28)
 that small and medium contracting firms in Nanking recently made 160 accusations  .
 against larger firms.)  Ho Tung-chi attacked corruption among the larger firms, and
 pointed out that the  mall firms could hope to remain :Ln business only if they
 cooperated with the Government in wiping ,)ut major corruption.  Shanghai reported

 Shift to Five Anti's   ire.  Peking reported at length a statement made by Shanghai
 Mayor Chen I to Increased Production and Economy Committees of the city and various
 chu, extracts from which follow:
 I hereby announce the formal initiation of the struggle against
 bribery, tax evasion, embezzlement of National property, cheat-
 ing on contracts, and stealing of State economic information, in
 Shanghai ....  We must warn all lawbreaking capitalists that the
 People's Government and the people cannot tolerate any more their
 crimes.  Unless they repent, adhere to the laws of the People's
 Government, completely confess, give up their stolen funds and
 materials, and pledge not to commit violations again, the People's
 Government and the people will not forgive them ....  Regardless
 of their status in the People's Government, their scale of
 business, their skill in handling production, their factions and
 their strength, their falsification of accounts, their formulation

 of offensive and defensive pacts, and their running away and hiding,
 the People's Government has the complete authority and confidence
 to give them complete aanctions ....  The outrageous inroads into
 the Chinese Communist Party and the working class by the Shanghai
 lawbreaking capitalist class are more organized and well planned
 than those by the capitalist class of other communities.  Their
 techniques of attack are 'smarter, and therefore more devastating ....
 I am of the opinion that the success of the fivel-anti's struggle
 of the Nation hinges on the five-anti's movement s of Shanghai ....
 It is hoped that the broad masses of Shanghai will respond to the
 Government, take up their, combat positions, and wait for orders to
 act ....  The five-anti's struggle is not the liquidation of the
 capitalist class, as the land reform struggle is liquidation of the
 landlord class.  The f iveanti's movement is the liquidation of the
 harmful actions of the capitalist class which endanger the national
 economy and the people's livelihood ....  They are permitted to
 engage in legal business and reap legal profits, and in addition
 will receive the protection of the Government.  (Peking, numeral
 code, Mar. 28)
 Chen I explained in detail that there was no charge in the position of the Government
 on the status of the capitalist class.  The revolution still must be carried out by
 a union of the three classes working together--workers, peasants, and the petty
 bourgeois.
 Hofei announced (Mar. 29) that in Huainan the five-anti's campaign exhibit had been
 opened Mar. 26, "after one month of preparation."  It showed, among other things,
 the bribes given cadres by capitalists and unwholesome drugs sold  a the market.
 RESISTANCE TO DRIVE
 Capitalists and Businessmen.  Dairen reported (Mar. 30) that in the settlement of
 3,000 cases of corruption among local industrial. and commercial firms the arrest was
 ordered of "12 treacherous merchants" who committed enormous crimes and "resisted
 the drive."  Chinchow announced (Mar. 28) that the Chinchow Austerity Committee had
 accused 400 merchants of obstructing the drive by holding back 400 million yuan in
 wages from 1,000 workers.  Hang chow reported (Mar. 25) that workers had demanded the
 arrest of merchants Tang Chien-ping, Chen Tzu.-liang, and 'Chou Ping-kuei of Wenchou for
 mistreating workers during the anticorruption drive, holding back wages, and using
 defective machinery, allowing one worker to be killed by~a broken belt.  Workers in
 the Hangehow silk mills held a meeting in an effort to "smash the schemes of capitalists
 who tried to obstruct the antiwaste, anticorruption, antibureaucracy drive."  Among
 1,011 small silk mills, 259 had stopped operations and cut off meals and wages.
 Workers organized teams to consult with factory owners in an attempt to get work
 resumed, and succeeded in 94 cases.  The Austerity Committee charged Han Tzu-wen,
 Yeh Chi-feng, and six others with stopping work, and ordered them to resume operations
 at once.  Hangehow added (Mar. 29)' that the local Increased Production and Economy
 Committee called a meeting Mar. 26, for "prohibition of illegal suspension of opera-
 tions, or closing down of business'," by "lawless merchants leniently treated."
 Kaifeng quoted (Mar. 25) from an editorial in the HONAN J!IH PAO which exposed attacks
 by the capitalist class upon the Nation's economic structure, warned of capitalist
 trickery, and called upon the masses to "organize themselves for a death struggle
 with the forces of corruption."  Hofei reported (Mar. 29)1 that Cheng Kuo-chuan and
 Wu Cht-hhang, owners of the Hsiehchang Trading Company, L.onnived with worker Huang
 Chang -ching to force worker Huang Hung-fa to commit suicide because he exposed the
 corruption of the management.  This was the third case oflmurder or suicide caused
 by businessmen obstructing the anticorruption drive.  The'HUANNAN HUANPEI JIH PAO
 carried an article demanding severe punishment for corrupt capitalists who caused
 the deaths of workers.

 infiltrating cadre Kao I-ming into the Wuhsien branch of the China Department Store
 to defraud the Government and gain inside information to use in speculation.  Yard
 goods prices were raised so arbitrarily in the store that "the anger of the public
 was aroused."  In addition, Ku and his accomplice contrived to sell 62 bolts of
 Government cloth and tie up capital.) In the first 3 months of 1951 yard goods sales
 in the State store were only 46 percent as high as in private stores; yet the State
 store's capital was six or seven times as high.  Wuhs i said (Mar. 27) that Chang
 Ming-chi, cocoon merchant and vice chairman of the Board of Trade, had been. dismissed
 from the latter job because he formed alliances with other cocoon merchants to close
 up shop and force workers out of jobs.  His accomplice, Chen Chi-shen, also was
 arrested.  Wuhsi asserted (Mar. 265 that the Wuhsien State textile mills had purged
 themselves of capitalistic elements that had infiltrated into the mills to cheat the

 more than 20 percent of the cadres enrolled for training had been sent by capitalists

 when he got a job in a Government trading company he could furnish his uncle with
 information.  Chang Chia-kou confessed that he was an agent of corrupt merchant
 Feng Chien-hua.
 Cadres and Workers.  Anshan asserted(Mar. 25) that despite attempts by corrupt
 merchants to enlist the cooperation of senior clerks, "most of them" now were making
 accusations against merchants.  WanglTe-chinoffered Yang Han-thing a share in the
 business, but instead Yang exposed his employer.  Chine-how declared (Mar. 27) that
 "as a result of their indoctrination I" Chinchow senior clerks and technicians, "who
 formerly had identified their interests with the. capitalists," now bad joined the
 workers.  Accountants Liu Wei-yuen of the Weisseng Ironworks, Liu Yu-fen of the
 Mengchi Processing Mills; and Li Ming-chu of the Chinchow Textile Mills, all accused
 their employers.
 Shanghai reported (Mar. 24) that ChenHua-thing, head of the Chinhua, Chekiang, office
 of the China Textile Company, had been removed for obstructing the drive.  He pardoned

 15 million yuan, when actually he had' taken 120 million.  Hangchow said (Mar. 25)
 that the Hangchow Federation of Labor', held an indoctrination course for senior

 letter of confession for his employer' and accused him of embezzling 200 million yuan.  i
 Hangchow added (Mar. 26) that staff members at Chekiang University had promoted the
 anticorruption drive with criticisms and self-criticisms "which were either weak or
 pointless."  After indoctrination "many who were above politics," such as 67-year-old
 Prof. Chin Ssu-chien, took a great interest in the drive, "and those who still are
 lukewarm in their political interests! have been warned to correct their thought."
 Huainan announced (Mar. 25) that the anticorruption drive in the Huainan branch of
 the People's Bank had gained, momentum following suspension of Chou Ching and Jen
 Lien-chun, manager and deputy manager',, respectively, "who obstructed the drive."
 Kunming reported (Mar. 25) that the Austerity Committee of rhaotung Hsien, Yunnan,
 had called a meeting of cadres to "correct rightist thought" among those who said
 that no corruption existed, and that if it did it easily could be taken care of by
 confessions.  Kunming said (Mar. 26) that cadres in Szemao Hsieh had been accused of
 rightist leanings in carrying out theldrive, and in order to "overcome these incorrect
 thoughts," other cadres had been sent: to the hsien to hold rallies. The new cadres
 exposed the tricks of Chang Mu-yuen and accu.Qed him of major corruption.  Kunming
 complained (Mar. 30) that in the Kunming Textile Mill the "five-anti's movement was
 not carried out successfully," because after preliminary tiger hunting was success-
 ful the management ordered the workers to take part in the "campaign against waste,
 or some other kinds of difficult work."  Instead of these replaced cadres other tiger
 hunters were named, who "have not achieved any remarkable results."

 dam developed leaks, causing the loss of a freight train valued at 330 million.  Most
 of the flood gates crumbled, forcing the Government to spend huge sums on repairs.
 When defective embankments caused floods in 1950, corrupt merchants contracting to
 furnish 22,000 gunny sacks took advantage of the situation and raised the price from

 ECONQMIC PROBLEMS
 Effects of Drive.  A considera131e number-of broadcasting' ata'tions continued tp insist
 that the anticorruption drive had increased, rather than decreased, production in many
 shops and factories.  Peking in numeral code (Mar. 29) asserted that' the Peking office
 of the China General Merchandise Co. 'had announced a cut of 5 percent in the iverage
 prices of 560 articles as a result of reduced costs brought about by the anticorrup-
 tion drive, which "streamlined businesses," placed workers in charge, of inspe tion,
 and cut out the ', squeeze going to corrupt elements.  Shanghai announced (Mar.  5)
 that locomotiveI engineerLiang Li-Chun of the Nanking Railway Administration   ove
 Locomotive No. 559 through heavy weather from Nanking to Shanghai during the   ive
 to set a 24-hour safety record.  Wuhsi claimed (Mar. 26) that pipe fitters had greatly
 increased their ef f iciency, as a result of the drive, and completed installations
 in the Wuhs i Paper Mills' in record time.  "Engineers no longer look upon pipe fitters
 as beneath them' but often work closely with them."
 Chungking asserted (Mar. 30) that in the Chengtu engineering section of the Ciungking-
 Chengtu Railway the efficiency of the workers was higher than before the driv , and
 now they had pledged to complete the construction of the railway by July 1.   n the
 No. 601 Textile l,Mill of Chungking production had increased as a result of the drive
 because "corrupt bureaucratic elements were expelled."  Kunming claimed (Mar. 26)
 that in the Yunnan branch of the People's Bank, efficiency of operations had improved

 noticeably as a result of the drive, with the time required for calculating interest
 on deposits cut from 5-7 days to 4, and the time required to balance the books of
 individual accounts cut from 7 hours to 4.  Other claims of improvement in prod. Lion
 as a result of the anticorruption drive were monitored from ?tukden (Mar. 24), Sian
 (Mar. 24), Shanghai (Mar. 25), Hangchow (Mar. 26), and Chung~ting (Mar. 29-30).
 Other broadcasts, while not claiming positive gains in production from the anti-
 corruption drive, maintained that production had been held tc1normal or improved
 as a result of adjustments recently made.  Anshan declared (Mar. 29) that in the
 Anshan! Ironworks Youth Corps members had taken the lead, weneI;.mproving production
 during the day "as a result of their political indoctrinatioi"during the drive, and
 were carrying on their tiger hunting at night.  Hangehow claimed (Mar. 29) that
 production in the Hungfeng Silk Mills now was up 26.1 percentithrough "coordination of
 the antiwaste, anticorruption, antibureaucracy drive with tli  production drive."
 Huainan reported (Mar. 27) that workers in the No. 9 Colliery had "voluntarily
 increased" individual work quotas by 4 percent.  Sian said (Mar. 29) that Government
 offices and trading companies in the Northwest had reassignedipart'of the cadres from
 the anticorruption drive to maintain normal operations.  As la result both drives were
 gaining, and other gains had been registered by uncovering dicing the anticorruption
 drive "a large number of useful cadres who have been added to', .the forces of the
 People's Revolution."
 Chungking asserted (Mar. 24) that on the Chengtu Railway wolk'ers had mapped out a
 plan to coordinate the tiger hunt with the production drivel y'"letting day workers
 hunt tigers by night, and night workers hunt tigers by day.','1Chungking said (Mar. 27)
 that in the Kweichow Province branches of the China Grain Co~mpany and the China Lumber
 Company production records had been established in January Ed,           but in order
 to "further promote normal operations," more and more cadres had been allocated from
 the tiger hunt to normal business operations.  Chungking reported (Mar. 30) that in
 the State trading companies of northern Szechwan, cadres who "showed their political
 awareness" during the anticorruption drive had been promoted to responsible positions,
 and now were "arranging contracts with private merchants for processing goods on an
 honest' basis."  Kunming declared (Mar. 27) that after the arrest of Yeh Kung-chi,
 manager of the Kunming Power Plant, the workers had increase1dlproi9uction and now had
 promised to complete the Kunming Hsien conservancy project by, the end of April.
 Still other broadcasts frankly admitted that production hadlbeen hurt by the anti-
 corruption drive.  Anshan admitted (Mar. 25) that although  orders' in the Anshan steel
 mills made "brilliant achievements in tiger hunting," production had lagged far
 behind!, schedule during the past few months "because of the preoccupation of the
 cadres'."  Mukder. announced (Mar. 24) that the Mukden Party Clomniittee had called two
 meetings of factory workers to "coordinate the tiger hunt and Iproduction drive," as
 "cadres had neglected production by paying too much attentiop'!'to the anticorruption
 drive.' Tsinan declared (Mar. 26) that "as a result of all t e !cadres spending their
 time making achievements in the tiger hunt," the Hsuchou Tobacco Company "completely
 ceased! operations" Feb. 2.  In order to resume operations, the'; company issued a
 directive on Mar. 10 allocating cadres to normal. business operations.  Tsinan added
 (Mar. 30) that in the No. 1 Factory of the Shantung Paper Company indoctrination by
 leading cadres was necessary, as "workers had paid all their' jattention to the tiger
 hunt so that production suffered."
 Hangchow declared (Mar. 24) that in the Hengfeng Textile Mills-of Yinhsien the Govern-
 ment had suffered a huge loss.  The China Cloth Company had liven processing orders
 to thel mills "in an attempt to maintain the livelihood of t.. workers," but as a
 result! of the anticorruption drive the mills started production only Mar. 13, and
 then "defective yardage reached 25 percent because of the unrest among the workers."
 The management had issued a blackboard notice telling the wkers "to work more and
 do less arguing."  Government losses resulted from spoilage and from the higher local
 costs over Shanghai costs.  Hangchow added (Mar. 25). that theiChekiang branches of
 the State companies handling native products, silk, tea, ge~feral merchandise and grain,

 - 12 -
 "which were interrupted by the antiwaste, anticorruption, antibureaucracy drive, have
 resumed normal operations."  It was claimed that the, China Grain company was "working
 under serious difficulties because of a shortage of transport," but that the companies
 were buying native products from the farmers and furnishing them with the daily
 necessities.. Hangchow admitted (Mar. 30) that in Hang Hsien, Chekiang, the Federation
 of Cooperatives called a meeting with branch cooper$111tives in an effort to strengthen
 the interflow of native and special, products, "as 800,000 catties of sugar cane and
 300,000 piculs of water chestnuts are not yet marketed."
 Hangchow announced (Mar. 28) that the Hangchow Austerity Committee had called a meeting
 of trade union members Mar. 23 "to urge them to take the lead in reviving normal
 business operations of shops affected by the antiwaste, anticorruption, antibureaucracy
 drive."  Changes were adopted "under the leadership iof the workers," which increased
 the operating capital of 'ome shops, and the 'Yltahsiang Cloth Shop was reclassified
 from a major non-law-abiding firm to a semi-law-abiding firm.  Hangchow added
 (Mar. 30) that workers in the Hangchiang Textile Mills had "overcome their rightist
 leanings, which resulted from'a sudden drop in production" 'during the anticorruption
 drive, and had increased output and decreased spoilage.
 Foochow reported (Mar. 27) that in the printing machine factory of the Fukien Printing
 Machine Department, some workers, "due to a lack of leadership, overindulged in tiger
 hunting," a mistake that was rectified when the director of the factory himself
 assumed the leadership of the drive.  Chungking said (Mar. 24) that after a meeting
 to coordinate the anticorruption and production drives, "production is again making
 headway" in the trade and financial organizations of northern Szechwan.  As a result
 of this reorganization, the People's Bank had started making 'loans to "confessed
 corrupt merchants," while the China Cotton and Yarn Company, and the China Food
 Company had begun letting processing contracts to private firms.  Kunming stated
 (Mar. 25) that in the Yunnan Power Plant new cadres had been appointed, and others
 promoted, to "take over positions vacated by corrupt 1, elements," and that, "in spite
 of the current difficulties," the new men had been able to do the work.  Chang Chin-
 tang proved to be wrong when he maintained that only1he could operate certain machines,
 and that the plant could not do without him.  When Liu Chien-hua, head of the
 materials section, was removed he was replaced by his deputy, Pi Huan-chi, and by
 Pu Kuo-chiang of the purchasing office.  Chang Chin-tang, head of the supply section,
 was replaced by Liu Ya-f a, former transport head.
 Shortages and Famine.  Wuhan announced (Mar. 25) that "in view of the serious famine
 in Kiangsi last year and the prospects of a spring famine this year," the Central
 Government had issued 20.8 billion yuan for relief there.  Similar steps had been
 taken to care for Hupeh, Hunan, Kwangtung, and Hainan Island.  Nanchang said (Mar. 25)
 that cadres in the drought areas of Kiangsi had taken the lead in arranging loans
 in Shangjao Hsien, where sufferers had received 30 tan of grain, and in Kan Hsien,
 where they had received 91 tan.  This action "quieted the fears of the wealthier
 farmers, who at first feared to make loans at interest."  Nanchang added (Mar. 29)
 that the "new damage to winter crops aggravates the situation" in the Loan, Shangjao,
 and Hsinyu localities.  The Kiangsi Production Committee for Relief of Disaster-
 Stricken People and the Kiangsi branch of the Chinese People's General Relief
 Association had called upon working personnel to save one Jiang of rice each day
 from Apr. 1 to July 30 to relieve Kiangsi people "stricken by natural disasters."
 Foochow announced (Mar. 29) that in the Chinchiang Special District, Fukien, the
 presence of spring famine "has aroused the serious attention of the local Governments,"
 which were intensifying their production policies and promoting "free lending and
 borrowing" to tide over the difficult times.  Shanghai (Mar. 27) listed the latest
 price quotations in several leading cities of East China.  Except for the high price
 of new rice, 172,000 yuana in Tsingtao, only Foochow 1, showed wide variations from
 the other cities.  Cotton yarn was quote( at 8.'7 million in Foochow, 7.5 million
 in Hangchow; fine cloth 322,600 in Foochow, 288,000 in Hangchow; yellow beans
 166,300 in Foochow, 86,000 in Nanking; edible oil 640,000 in Foochow, 400,000 in
 Tsinan; salt 127,000 in Foochow, 85,000 in Tsingtao. 1 Quotations were low for Foochow
 only in newsprint and matches, while new rice was quoted at 136,200 for Foochow and
 115,000 in Hangchow, though  it was still higher in Tsingtao.

 Chungking announced (Mar. 30) that the North Sonechwan Administrative Office Mar. 23
 allocated 400 million yuan and 10 million catties of food to four special districts
 under the jurisdiction of the office, with instructions that the food be distributed,
 without delay, "to food-deficient areas."  Kunming reported ()Aar. 27) that workers
 in the Yunnan Machine Works had developed a technique for making molds out of salt,
 lime, and charcoal, "to alleviate the shortage of materials in Kunming."
 Farm Production.  Wuhan announced (Mar. 27) that 60 teachers and students from Wuhan left
 for the rural areas to promote the spring farm production program.  Chinchow
 said (Mar. 24) that cadres in Lishu and Hsinmin Hsien, Liaosi Province, had been sent
 to the rural areas to ascertain needs of farms for spring operations.  In Taian Hsien
 model farmers were organizing women to promote the spring farm program.  Foochow reported
 for children while their mothers worked in the fields.  In Sinkiang 2,000 laborers and
 personnel of the People's Liberation Army started work on the Iwata Reservoir, which
 will irrigate 50,000 mou.  Yangehow said (Mar. 24) that the Nantung Special District
 had reported 1,991 temporary and 579 permanent mutual-aid teams organized.  Chitung
 Hsien planned to organize 35 percent of its farm labor force into mutual aid teams.
 Other broadcasts telling of action to get spring farming under way, build and repair
 irrigation systems, reclaim wasteland, supply fertilizer, organize mutual aid teams,
 and provide loans for farmers, were monitored from Mukden, Peking, Chinchow, Tsinan,
 Shanghai, Hangchow, Hofei, Yangchow, Taiyuan, and Chungking.  Taiyuan reported
 (Mar. 25) that another group of 25 cadres in Hsin Hsien, Shansi, had been taken off
 the anticorruption drive and sent to the rural areas to aid with spring farming
 following indoctrination.  Foochow said (Mar. 28) that in Yungchun Hsien, Fukien,
 Party and Government cadres had been lax in promoting spring farming because they
 were too busy with the anticorruption drive.  In Pingtai Hsien cadres met Mar. 7,
 but took no action toward aiding the farm program until Mar. 14.
 women were doing the work in the wheat fields, and day nurseries had been set up to care
 (Mar. 25) that cadres in the rural areas of Fukien were promoting the spring farm
 program by holding meetings, organizing mutual aid teams, an4.. distributing fertilizer.
 Sian announced (Mar. 24) that, in order to release men for work pn antidrought projects,
 A considerable number of other broadcasts reflected difficulties experienced in promot-
 ing farm production.  Chinchow reported (Mar. 26) that because of the cold weather
 only 70 militiamen responded to the call to dig ice from the river for irrigation in
 Ihsien, Liaosi, but after indoctrination 200 reported and obtained enough to water
 140 mou.  Peking said in numeral code (Mar. 28) that in Liyang, Ihsieg, Lishui,
 Chintan, and Chiangning Hsien, southern Kiangsu, 190,000 mou of wheat had been
 flooded from the cold rain of the past few weeks. Most of the wheat was turning
 yellow, while rape, horsebean, and other crops had been affected.
 Hangchow announced (Mar. 24) that the Yuhang, Chekiang, Party Coumittee had called
 a meeting in an attempt to overcome the difficulties faced by the middle class farmers
 and allow them to proceed with production.  Middle class farmers had made loans of
 19,000 catties of grain, 55 plow oxen, and large quantities of rice seedlings to 200
 poor farmers, who now were unable to pay back the loans.  Hanichow said (Mar. 26)
 that the Chekiang Women's Democratic League had called upon wc'men in the rural areas
 to "overcome their reluctance in promoting spring farm production" and participate in
 mutual-aid teams.  Hangchow added (Mar. 30) that the Party Committee in the Yinhsien
 Special District had called an indoctrination meeting for cadres, as they had been
 lax in promoting spring farming, with 10-20 percent of the land still not being
 worked.
 Yangchow reported (Mar. 29) that in Ssuyang Hsien, northern Kiangsu, cadres had been
 ordered to "overcome their shortcomings" and get production under way.  Instead of
 attempting to fulfill their quota of 1.8 million catties of grain, they called the
 quota useless and made no attempt to support it.  Foochow stated (MAT. 28) that a
 meeting had been called in the Chinchiang Special District, Fukien, Mar. 7 to "rectify

 the neglect" in leading spring cultivation.  In Lungchi Hsien the Drought Prevention
 Committee called attention to the fact that rice seedlings were rotting in five
 hsien because of a lack of care.  Nanchang reported (Mar. 25) that in Wuchiang Hsieng,
 Chu 4, Loping Hsien, Kiangsi, car'res had to indoctrinate the peasants in the benefits
 of providing irrigation systems before they overcame their reluctance and began
 construction.  Nanchang added (Mar. 26) that in Chinkan Hsien cadres had to urge
 farmers to lend 400,000 yuan and 45 piculs of rice so mazer of the peasants could
 start their spring farming.  Farmers were "reluctant to lend grain for fear of being
 accused of being rich farmers."
 Wuhan declared (Mar. 30) that in Hupeh Province the cadres must "overcome their
 attitude that farm production needs no guidance," and take the lead in organizing
 mutual aid teams, encouraging patriotic production, "exterminating rumors, and break-
 ing down ideological deviations."  The Hupeh Government had issued a directive
 calling upon all local Governments and cadres to become more active in order to
 prevent famine.  Chungking reported (Mar. 24) that in Lu Hsien, Szechwan, cadres had
 organized antidrought teams "after overcoming rightist leanings among the peasants."
 Chungking said (Mar. 29) that in the Wanhsien Special District, Szechwan, peasants
 were planting early maturing crops, such as beans and pumpkins, but that recent
 rains had caused early spring crops, "which had showed signs of withering," to turn
 green again.
 Organization and, Management.  Mukden announced (Mar. 25) that the Northeast China
 People's Government had named Lin Feng, vice chairman of that Government, and Ku Cho-
 hsin, Minister of Finance, as chairman an. deputy chairman, respectively, of the
 newly created Northeast Committee for Control of Government Enterprises.  The Committee
 issued registration forms to all Government enterprises and instructed workers to make
 reports.  Shanghai announced (Mar. 28) that in East China the new committees for
 unified management of publicly owned economic enterprises would start to function
 Apr. 1, and would complete the takeover by Apr. 30.  Peking said in numeral code
 (Mar. 27) that "a.n a certain oil refinery in the Northeast" it had been discovered
 that much of the profits had been lost through corruption and inefficient use of
 equipment.  As a result managerial expenses would be cut 21.1 percent, basic construc-
 tion 50 percent, and the budget would be increased 17 billion yuan.  Distilling machinery
 had been improved ^^ it would produce 34 percent above "the standard as established
 by the Americans," and the monthly oil production would be doubled.
 Shanghai announced (Mar. 25) that metal trades firms of Nanking, including tl'q-.,.
 Hsintechuen, Liangte, and Wuchienbsin Iron Foundries, were "being revived" by orders
 from State companies.  Shanghai said (Mar. 29) that workers in the Hungta Paper Mills
 had accused the management of delaying production in order to make greater profits.
 Peking reported in numeral code (Mar. 27) that the Mukden office of the China Textile
 Company held consultations with factory workers and managers before letting out
 processing contracts to private firms, and as a result reduced the quantity of cotton
 yarn and dyestuffs.  Sian stated (Mar. 24) that Government trading companies in Lanchow
 were placing orders with local businessmen "which will solve the livelihood of more
 than 10,000 workers and supply the needs of more than 20,000 dependents."  The China
 Grain Company employed 1,079 carters to transport grain processed by 662 flour Mills
 and 3,000 noodle makers; the China Farm Implement Company made advances to 53
 implement firms on processing orders; and the China Native Products Company hired 200

 Chungking announced (Mar.27T`~'1TAt Fan T -i"2Ch~i   T fes ident `ai  1te China DeParti ant ?'
 Store, had called a meeting of private firms to discuss the granting of processing
 contracts.  Fan declared that his company actually did not need to give contracts
 to private firms, but was doing so "in order to revive private business."  The
 Chungking Bureau of Trade told the firms that "in giving them contracts in spite of
 their known corruption, the Government has fully proved 'ts solicitude for private
 businessmen."  Kunming stated (Mar. 29) that the Yunnan office of the China Food

 labor and material.
 Nanchang announced (Mar. 28) that the Nanchang Special District Administration, and Party
 Committee, had issued emergency directives to local Governments to organize teams at once
 to combat flood conditions along the Kan River system, where the dikes already were in
 danger.  Nanchang added (Mar. 30) that the Nanchang Special District Administration had
 issued another emergency directive ordering cadres to protect grain supplies against the
 heavy rains, as many warehouses were in need of repair.  Hsien Governments were ordered to
 organize teams to purchase and bag all loose grain.

 Germ Warfare Propaganda.  Peking's home service broadcasts said (Mar. 29) that the Inter-
 national Association of Democratic Lawyers had completed its investigation of American
 bacteriological warfare in Northeast China, and the Chinese and foreign press group
 investigating the matter had issued a statement.  American planes in 71 flights had made
 318 sorties to drop germ-infested insects and other articles on the area.  The same
 radio said (Mar. 30) that the "Christian priest," Wang Tzu-chung, made a statement for the
 NCNA following an investigation.  On Mar. 19 American places dropped large quantities of
 insects on the Wonsan, Korea, area, while statements by American and British prisoners of

 Comment on the reports of the Communist lawyers, and new reports of protest meetings by
 various groups, were monitored from Mukden, Tsinan, Hangchow, and Kaifeng Mar. 244; from
 Mukden, Dairen, Foochow, Taiyuan, and Wuhan Mar. 25; and-from Mukden and Nantung Mar. 27.

 that part-time students, factory workers, peasants, and other groups, were being"indoctri-
 nated in public health and antiplaguemeasures," and were "cleaning up their surroundings."
 Mukden asserted that an epidemic prevention headquarters had been set up in every organiza-
 tion of the city to "clean out bacteria-laden insects."  The clothing of all personnel
 "engaged in insect catching" was being sterilized after each operation.  Nanchang announced
 'Mar. 27) that "after indoctrination" by the Party Propaganda Corps, 3,600 peasants in
 Paoshan Hsiang, Shangjao Hsien, Kiangsi, took vaccinations.
 Wuhan asserted (Mar. 25) that medical workers throughout the Central and South China area
 made protests, and the Antiplague Committee of the region issued a directive Mar. 23 calling
 upon the broad masses "to gain a better understanding of germ warfare."  Canton reported
 (Mar. 26) that the Kwangtung branch of the China Federation of Natural Science Institutions
 called 60 scientific workers together Mar. 26 to organize an antibacteriological warfare
 commit'-ee, "which will organize all scientific workers and prepare them to answer the call
 of the  Government in the struggle against bacteriological warfare."  Ting Ling of Chunghaban

 stern warning to the land refora cadres and ordered them to "educate the farmers in the
 benefits of confiscating landlordat' property."  Cadres here had been lax in confiscating
