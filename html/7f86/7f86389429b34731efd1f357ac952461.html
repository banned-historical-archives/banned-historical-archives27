 Foreword
 This chronology provides the Agency historian with a brief,
 factual introduction to the main currents of the two turbulent
 decades of world affairs after World War II, when the United
 States emerged as leader of the Free World and when the Central
 Intelligence Agency evolved as a significant instrument of US
 national security policy in the cold war.   The chronology
 reflects CIA's development and progress not only as a central
 agency for the analysis of intelligence information and the
 preparation of strategic intelligence estimates but also as
 an active, operational member of the US and Allied security
 system.
 The chronology consists of four parallel columns: column
 1 cites occurrences of world-wide significance; column 2,
 events of national interest; column 3, developments in the US
 intelligence and national security communities;  and column 4,
 milestones in the evolution of the Agency.   Included are,
 public events of major political, diplomatic, military,.and
 technological significance, as well as selected intra-Agency
 activities.
 In format and detail the chronology is necessarily selective
 and terse.   The historian will, of course, wish to exploit
 the many specialized chronologies in his field--both'clas-
 sified and unclassified.   In addition, he will also find
 useful the historical compilations prepared by the Library
 of Congress for the Committee on Foreign Relations of the
 United States Senate such as Background Information Relating
 to Southeast Asia and Vietnam,  5th rev ed  (91st Congress,  lst
 Session,  1969)  and A Select Chronology and Background Documents
 Relating to the Middle East,  lst rev ed  (91st Congress,  1st
 Session,  1969).   The numerous entries in the Annual Index of
 the New York Times provide details on the day-to-day progress
 of public affairs; Neville Williams' Chronology of the Modern
 World,  1st American ed, New York,  David McKay,  1967,  is an
 important British compilation; Andre Fontaine's two chrono-
 logies in his History of the Cold War, New York, Pantheon,
 1965,  illuminate events from the French point of view;  and
 the latter part of William L.  Langer's An Encyclopedia of
 World History,  4th ed, Boston,  Houghton Mifflin,  1968,
 furnishes a chronological survey of the postwar period in
 its broadest historical perspective.
