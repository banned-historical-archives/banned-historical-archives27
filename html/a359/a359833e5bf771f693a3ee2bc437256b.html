 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 September 1959
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 PRELIMINARIES TO KHRUSHCHEV'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON
 In a speech on 4 September
 at the opening of the Polish
 exhibition in Moscow, Khrushchev
 again attempted to ease Western
 apprehension over Soviet inten-
 tions and to prepare the ground
 for his visit to the United
 States.  Adopting a tone of un-
 usual moderation, he stressed
 the importance of "peaceful co-
 existence" and of actions which
 can contribute to a lessening
 of world tensions.
 Soviet spokesmen, while
 playing down the possibility
 that specific agreements will
 be reached during the Khru-
 shchev-Eisenhower exchange of
 visits, have stressed the pros-
 pects for improved relations.
 An official at the Soviet Em-
 bassy in Berlin remarked that
 no concrete results should be
 expected from the visits but
 said they could prove useful
 and lead to better understand-
 ing.   Expressing hope they would
 in turn lead to a meeting'at
 the summit, he stated that he
 envisaged such a meeting com-
 prising only the Big Four,
 The counselor of the Soviet
 Embassy in Paris told an Amer-
 ican official on 7 September
 that President Eisenhower and
 Khrushchev, in order to bring
 about a "change in atmosphere,"
 should discuss "all issues" but
 not negotiate details.   He ex-
 pressed the opinion that agree-
 ments probably could be reached
 on cultural and economic ex-
 changes and that progress could
 be made on disarmament and the
 control of nuclear weapons.  He
 said an agreement on trade and
 credit at an early stage of
 Khrushchev's visit would facil-
 itate "political concessions"
 later.   The Soviet diplomat
 also commented that the "aging"
 Khrushchev wants to be remem-
 bered as the man who, after 40
 years of revolutionary strug-
 gle, was able to raise the USSR's
 standard of living and bring
 about peace and prosperity.
 Soviet propaganda has at-
 tempted to build up Khrushchev's
 personal prestige on the eve
 of his visit.   A Pravda article
 on 8 September asserted that
 nine out of ten Americans con-
 sider the Soviet premier an
 "emissary of peace" and regard
 his visit as marking the begin-
 ning of a new period in American
 foreign policy.   The article re-
 ferred to Khrushchev's "immense
 authority" and declared that
 Americans want peace and there-
 fore insist that their leaders
 "listen more often and more at-
 tentively" to his voice.
 Concern Over Asian Situation
 The Soviet leaders are show-
 ing concern that the Sino-Indian
 border dispute  and develop-
 ments in Laos will have an ad-
 verse effect on Khrushchev's
 visit.   Moscow moved to soft-
 pedal the dispute between Pei-
 ping and New Delhi by issuing a
 TASS statement on 9 September
 which condemned alleged efforts
 by "Western circles," especially
 in the United States, to exploit
 the dispute as a?ments of ob-
 structing a relaxation of ten-
 sion on the eve of the exchange
 of visits.   While deploring the
 "incident" on the Sino-Indian
 frontier, the statement care-
 fully refrained from assigning
 blame to either  party  And

 underscored the USSR's friendly
 relations with both countries.
 The statement said "Soviet lead-
 ing quarters" are confident that
 the two governments will reach
 a peaceful settlement based on
 mutual interests and the "tra-
 ditional friendship between the
 peoples of China and India."
 Regarding events in Laos,
 Soviet diplomats in London and
 Paris have termed the situation
 "very untimely" and "most in-
 opportune" from the USSR's view-
 point.
 Visit to Peiping
 On 4 September Khrushchev
 announced that he plans to go
 to Peiping on 29 September, im-
 mediately following his visit
 to the United States, to attend
 Communist China's 10th anniver-
 sary,celebrations.  The visit--
 Khrushchev's second since head-
 ing the Soviet delegation of the
 1954 celebrations--will provide
 an opportunity for a major pub-
 lic display of intrabloc soli-
 darity.
 At the same time, one of
 Khrushchev's main tasks will be
 to allay signs of apprehensions
 of Chinese Communist leaders
 over the effect which his talks
 in Washington might have on
 their international objectives,
 especially regarding Taiwan.
 On 7 September a Soviet diplo-
 mat in Paris stated that the
 Chinese are "definitely unhappy"
 over the Eisenhower-Khrushchev
 exchange.   Despite Peiping's
 private misgivings, on 9 Sep-
 tember  Chou  En-lai  repeated
 Communist China's official en-
 dorsement of the meetings, but
 this time omitted the call for
 an "unremitting struggle" to
 defeat the West which Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi made on 15
 August.
 Khrushchev may also seek
 to ease some points of ideolog-
 ical differences, such as have
 arisen over the communes, by
 reaffirming his recent statement
 that each bloc country engaged
 in  "building socialism" must
 take into consideration its "na-
 tional, cultural, and economic
 peculiarities."    Peiping  is
 likely to press, however, for
 a strong endorsement of its in-
 ternal program, some aspects
 of which Khrushchev has criti-
 cized on occasion.
 Western European Views
 President Eisenhower's trip
 to Europe evidently confirmed
 the British conviction that his
 talks with Khrushchev will fur-
 ther the prospects of peace, and
 increased the belief in Paris
 and Bonn that the exchange au-
 gurs well for the protection of
 their interests and for peace.
 The West German press, unan-
 imously  approving  the  Presi-
 dent's  European. trip, has
 stressed that his success in
 strengthening the unity and de-
 termination of the West will
 enhance his authority when he
 meets with Khrushchev.
 A reliable opinion survey
 taken in late August reports
 that 91 percent of the West
 Germans interviewed were aware
 of the Eisenhower-Khrushchev
 exchange, 76 percent feeling it
 would be good, and 7 percent
 bad.  Most of those questioned
 believed the President  agreed

 to the exchange in the hope it
 would relax East-West tensions
 and maintain world peace. While
 most thought that disarmament
 would be the main topic cov-
 ered, the largest number pre-
 ferred that the President and
 Khrushchev discuss German re-
 unification.   The  poll                        also
 gave-evidence that West German
 hopes for reunification  are
 fading, however, as the number
 of persons viewing the chances
 for unity as "bad" or  "very
 bad" has increased from 52 per-
 cent.in April 1959 to 61 per-
 cent.
 The French press has been
 generally pleased with the re-
 sults of the President's Euro-
 pean trip and remains optimis-
 tic regarding his exchange of
 visits with Khrushchev  as  a
 gesture toward prolonging peace.
 Some papers,however, raise the
 question whether anything basic
 in the international picture
 has really changed.   Meanwhile
 French official circles  wel-
 come the formation of the 10-
 nation disarmament  group                    as
 permitting the  resumption of
 negotiations in a broad frame-
 work--which France has consist-
 ently preferred to discussions
 limited to nuclear disarmament
 or test bans.
 President Eisenhower's
 European trip strengthened the
 British people's belief in his
 sincerity  in his  search for
 peace and their conviction
 that he is going about it in
 the right way.   The American
 Embassy in London observes
 that his visit left Anglo-Amer-
 ican relations in a rosy. glow
 and unquestionably enhanced
 British confidence in the
 United States' leadership of
 the free world.   The President
 is credited with the concilia-
 tory tone of Adenauer's reply
 to Khrushchev and broadcast
 concerning Poland.   Some doubt
 has been expressed, however,
 whether the results of the
 visit-to France may not be "too
 good to be true."
 Following Secretary Her-
 ter's statement before the North
 Atlantic Council on 4 September,
 unanimous support of the Amer-
 ican position was tempered with
 some warnings of the dangers of
 giving the public the impres-
 sion that international tension
 had relaxed.  While Belgian
 Foreign Minister Wigny urged
 expanding East-West exchanges,
 including trade, Greek Foreign
 Minister Averoff opined that
 the risks of Khrushchev's visits
 outweigh the hopes, and Turkish
 Foreign Minister Zorlu similar-
 ly advised that popular fears
 of a Soviet-American detente
 be kept in mind.   Secretary
 General Spaak expressed mem-
 bers' confidence in the United
 States  but  supported   the
 Greek  and  Turkish warnings.
 SINO-INDIAN BORDER DISPUTE
 The Sino-Indian border dig-
 pute seems headed for the  dip-
 lomatic conference table,     al
 though localized  clashes  are
 still possible.  While reassert-
 ing their territorial                                                             claims,

 10 September 1959
 e ru as
 frequently stressed the desir-
 ability of resolving certain
 border questions through diplo-
 matic means and thus will en-
 dorse Chou's suggestion for
 "friendly negotiations." Chou's
 claims to extensive border areas
 long regarded as Indian will not
 be acceptable to New Delhi,which
 continues to declare that its
 "internationally recognized"
 frontier is not subject to ne-
 gotiation--except for minor
 modifications .
 Nehru--heavily   committed
 to defend the McMahon line--
 is also unlikely to agree to
 Chou's demand for a withdrawal
 from all the areas near the
 line occupied since spring.
 clashes could occur if the Chi-
 nese troops continue to enforce
 Peiping's claim that Longju is
 in Tibet and the Indians then
 attempt to expel them forcibly.
 Following an earlier stiff
 Chinese Communist diplomatic
 note accusing India of "aggres-
 sion," the Indian Government on
 7 September publicized the full
 scope of the Sino-Indian border
 dispute by issuing a 122-page
 White Paper documenting   New
 Delhi's case against Peiping.
 The paper included the texts of
 a series of Indian protests and
 Chinese replies on questions of
 disputed border claims, Tibetan
 refugee activity, treatment of
 Indian and Bhutanese nationals
 in Tibet, and the recent border
 incursions.
 New Delhi also took steps
 earlier in September to notify
 the Soviet and Polish ambas-
 sadors formally of its serious
 concern over Chinese  border
 activity.   The Indian foreign
 secretary apparently informed
 the bloc representatives that
 if the incidents were to con-
 tinue, New Delhi would be forced
 to reappraise its policy of
 nonalignment.
 The Indian Communist party,
 already hard hit by Peiping's
 earlier action in Tibet,has in-
 structed its secretary general
 to explain personally to party
 leaders in Moscow and Peiping
 the even more serious dilemma
 created by the Chinese incursions into
 India.   The USSR's desire to soft-
 pedal the dispute was reflected
 in a TASS statement on 9 September
 which stressed Moscow's friendly
 relations with both Peiping and New 25X1
 Delhi and expressed hope that a
 peaceful settlement would be
 reached.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 September 1959
 Widely scattered skirmishing
 between Laotian Army forces and
 Communist partisan elements con-
 tinues in Sam Neua and Phong
 Saly provinces.   The town  of
 Sam Neua apparently  remains
 threatened by Communist forces
 which crossed the Nam Ma River
 on 30 August, although the Com-
 munists do not appear to  have
 followed up their initial ad-
 vantage.  A Laotian Army patrol
 was reported to have been at-
 tacked recently on the edge of
 the town's airfield.  Almost
 daily fighting has also been
 reported at Muong
 Poua, about 15 miles
 northeast of Sam
 Neua town.
 The relative ab-
 sence of contact be-
 tween the opposing
 forces in northeast-
 ern Sam Neua Province
 has led Laotian of-
 ficials to speculate
 that some of the Com-
 munist forces have
 been withdrawn  to
 North Vietnam.   The
 Laotian Army G-2 em-
 phasizes,                        however,
 that this is  merely
 a possibility which
 remains unconfirmed.
 Government sourc-
 es claim the recap-
 ture of Muong Son,in
 Communist-infested
 western Sam      Neua
 Province.   The  Lao-
 tian Army's                   ability
 to retain the post is
 problematical. Gov-
 ernment forces in the
 Sam Teu district   in
 the southeastern part
 of the province are

 as an alternative to the emer-

 4 September,  is due shortly to
 arrive in Vientiane.   It is
 anticipated that the subcommit-
 tee, composed of Argentina,
 Japan,  Italy, and Tunisia, may
 eventually be expanded to in-
 clude 15 men from each country.
 Problems of terrain and weather
 will seriously hamper their in-
 vestigations.   The group has
 no authority to make recommenda-
 tions but will merely report
 its findings to the council "as
 soon as possible."
 (India would
 take no further initiative on
 the Laotian problem now that
 the matter is in the hands of
 the UN,                           al-
 though In  a has felt the In-
 ternational Control Commission
 (ICC) should be reconvened to
 prevent the situation from
 deteriorating into open con-
 flict, it was now unlikely that
 India would make any new move
 for some time.
 While the USSR has main-
 tained a solid front with Pei-
 ping and Hanoi, the remarks of
 Soviet diplomats suggest that
 Moscow is concerned that the
 Laotian issue will have an ad-
 verse effect on Premier Khru-
 shchev's visit to the United
 States.   The Soviet delegate
 to the United Nations, backed
 by Soviet propaganda, has
 charged that "certain circles
 in the West" are using Laos to
 "poisons" the international at-
 mosphere on the eve of Khru-
 shchev's arrival.   Soviet Am-
 bassador Malik on 7 September
 remarked that the Laotian situa-
 tion was not only dangerous but
 also "very untimely just when
 the program of high-level visits
 is taking place and we are all
 looking forward to a summit
 meeting."
 At the Security Council
 meeting on 7 September, Soviet
 delegate Sobolev challenged the
 legality of the Western resolu-
 tion, contending that the es-
 tablishment of a council sub-
 committee was equivalent to an
 investigation of the Laotian
 complaint and that the decision
 was therefore subject to the
 veto.   Sobolev complained that
 the creation of a subcommittee
 would "subvert" the Geneva
 agreements of 1954.
 Soviet propaganda has dis-
 missed the Laotian charge of
 North Vietnamese aggression as
 a "lie" and charged that the
 move to bring the issue to the
 United Nations was an American
 maneuver to pave the way for
 "open interference under the
 UN flag."  Moscow contends that
 the actions of the Sananikone
 government have provoked a
 "civil war" and that now that
 the government is unable to sup-
 press the "democratic and pa-
 triotic forces" in Laos, it has
 fabricated a "tale of aggres-
 sion by North Vietnam to open
 the gates for Western inter-
 vention in Laotian internal af-11
 fairs.
 Laos' UN appeal and sub-
 sequent Security Council ac-
 tion brought on a flurry of pro-
 tests from Peiping and Hanoi.
 The Soviet contention that the
 Security Council action was
 illegal was echoed in a North
 Vietnamese Foreign Ministry
 statement on 9 September which
 was strongly supported in a
 speech by Communist China's
 foreign minister on the same

 Peiping People's Daily published
 a long commentary charging that
 the United States was usurping
 the name of the United Nations
 "to engineer a new conspiracy
 of interference in Laos."  Nu-
 merous Moscow commentaries and

 newed at every opportunity de-
 mands for the recall of the ICC

 A possible  new  line  in

 peared on 8 September when Hanoi
 publicized a statement  attrib-

 the Neo Lao Hak Zat   (NLHZ),
 which asserted that the only
 solution to the Laotian  roblem
 was negotiation between the
 parties concerned--the royal
 government and the Pathet Lao
 forces. Heretofore, bloc prop-

 the ICC in Laos  as the "only"'

 in UAR-Soviet relations last
 week.   On 5 September the UAR's
 controlled press denounced So-
 viet "interference" in the UAR's

 the "interference" has been the
 reproduction by Soviet bloc

 originating in Iraq.  The UAR

 the Soviet Union by republish-

 have been a one-shot operation,

 more symptom of Nasir's extreme

 the UAR minister of education
 has stated that it' is now UAR
 policy to reduce the number of

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 September 1959
 The Imam of Yemen, having
 vented publicly and privately
 his irritation over the unset-
 tled conditions that prevailed
 during his absence in Italy,
 now appears to be in a calmer
 frame of mind.   Some changes in
 administration have taken place,
 and persons involved;in the out-
 bursts of violence last May have
 apparently been punished.
 The Qadi Ahmad al-Siyaghi,
 chairman of Yemen's represent-
 ative council and perhaps the
 most eminent individual to suf-
 fer the Imam's wrath, fled tem-
 porarily to Beihan in the Aden
 Protectorate, but has since re-
 turned and reportedly is again
 in the good graces of the Imam.
 Al-Siyaghi is said to have
 feared the Imam's suspicion of
 his close relationship with
 Crown Prince Badr, whose rela-
 tively modest attempts at re-
 form proved anathema to the
 Imam.   A shifting of other of-
 ficials, both civil and mili-
 tary, is probably continuing.
 Badr's own status is still
 somewhat in doubt.   Aside from
 the administrative reform meas-
 ures, which the Imam interpreted
 as     a   tacit and unallowable
 admission that something was
 indeed wrong in Yemen, Badr.'s
 seemingly weak methods of deal-
 ing with tribal and military
 dissidents obviously infuriated
 his father.   There is some evi-
 dence also that Badr's reliance
 on the Egyptian mission in Yemen
 alarmed the xenophobic Imam. The
 Imam,however, has taken no ac-
 tion toward the Egyptians.
 Badr, meanwhile, has prob-
 ably been stripped of all  real
 authority, although the Imam
 seems still to consider  the
 crown prince capable of being
 reshaped in his own image and
 -thus serving as his eventual
 successor.
 Jordan
 The general security situa-
 tion in Jordan has improved,and,
 the position of King Husayn's
 government appears superficial-
 ly firmer now than it has seemed
 for some time.   During a mid-Au-
 gust tour of West Jordan, where
 the Palestine refugee population
 is concentrated and where oppo-
 sition to the Amman monarchy is
 normally considerably stronger
 than elsewhere in the country,
 Husayn and Prime Minister Ma-
 jalli were given warmer recep-
 tions than observers had ex-
 pected.
 While part of this improve-
 ment results from Majalli's ef-
 forts to conciliate old oppo-
 nents of the government, most of
 it stems from the recent rap-
 prochement between Jordan and
 the UAR.   Earlier orders from
 Cairo telling Jordanian politi-
 cal refugees in Syria to sus-
 pend activity reportedly have
 been reinforced, along with a
 suggestion that some of the
 emigrds might return to Jordan
 and reconcile themselves to
 Husayn,
 Opposition political
 groups within Jordan, notably
 the Jordanian Baath party and
 the Communists, have been weak-
 ened organizationally by the
 long period, of repression under
 former Prime Minister Rifai,and
 their morale has suffered from
 the. setbacks which fellow Commu-
 nists and Baathists have re-
 ceived at the hands of Nasir in
 neighboring Syria.   The domestic
 opposition is merely muffled,

 BRITISH SEEK WAYS TO BOLSTER CENTO
 London believes the Shah
 of  Iran  requires  more  sup-
 port through the Central Treaty
 Organization (CENTO) --the for-
 mer Baghdad Pact--and is there-
 fore advocating various measures
 to give the alliance an appear-
 ance of greater vitality with-
 out imposing any drain on the
 British exchequer.
 Since  Iraq's  withdrawal,
 British officials have viewed
 the pact essentially in terms
 of is usefulness in strength-
 ening Iran.  The British con-
 sider Iran "of direct and great"
 importance to themselves, cit-
 ing it as a major non-Arab
 source of oil and as an impor-
 tant link in Britain's air com-
 munications with the Persian
 Gulf and the Far East.  Foreign
 Office Deputy Under Secretary
 Sir Roger Stevens, a former am-
 bassador to Tehran, has expressed
 London's general pessimism re-
 garding Iran and fear that the
 country might go neutralist if
 the Shah does not receive the
 material and moral support he
 deems necessary.
 London  does  not  appear
 ready to increase its own modest
 material support to CENTO.  The
 British do not plan to increase
 their military aid--mainly for
 the building of radar installa-
 tions--beyond the present $1,-
 400,000 annual figure.   Similar-
 ly, London plans to continue
 its present level of economic
 support--including the princi-
 pal backing for the pact's nu-
 clear center--at about $2,200,-
 000 a year.  The British assert
 that,   in  any  event,   greater
 economic aid probably would not
 have the desired political ef-
 fect.
 Looking toward the CENTO
 ministerial council meeting in
 Washington in October, Britain
 is backing other measures de-
 signed  to  impress  the  Shah.
 While opposed to establishing
 a command structure with the
 Shah as commander in chief, Lon-
 don might favor setting up a
 CENTO air command.
 Britain also urges CENTO
 contingency military planning
 covering USSR-incited aggres-
 sion from Iraq and Afghanistan.
 The British believe that there
 is little risk of such aggres-
 sion in the next few years, but
 consider that Iranian and Paki-
 stani military forces would be
 useful only for "local" wars,
 and  that  in  any  event  such

 by punishing some party lead-
 ers below the politburo level.
 A series of editorials in
 the party press has reflected
 the shortfall in the "leap for-
 ward" in 1958, the downward re-
 vision of 1959 goals, and the
 latest modification of the com-
 mune program, all announced in
 late August.   The positions
 being defended in these pro-
 nouncements are primarily those
 of Mao and the "party-machine"
 leaders, including Mao's heir
 apparent, Liu Shao-chi, and the
 party secretary general, Teng
 Hsiao-ping.  The articles are
 intended to conceal the extent
 of the dominant group's previous
 miscalculations, to find a
 scapegoat, for them, and to re-
 animate the party cadres for a
 new production effort.
 The line of defense taken
 by the dominant leaders has
 been to insist on the "complete
 correctness" of their programs
 as conceived, as well as to in-
 sist that they themselves took
 the initiative in repairing the
 "errors and shortcomings" in
 implementing their programs.
 Mistakes are said to have de-
 rived principally from the un-
 precedented scope of the pro-
 grams.
 The editorials take the
 offensive at several points,
 primarily against "right op-
 portunists" within the Chinese
 party--and, by implication,
 within the Soviet Communist
 party. "Rightist opportunists,"
 it is repeatedly said, have
 failed to understand the poten-
 tial of mass movements like the
 "leap" and the commune program,
 have not done their best, have
 minimized accomplishments and
 exaggerated problems, have dis-
 couraged initiative and enthu-
 siasm and encouraged lethargy
 and pessimism, and indeed "have
 lost faith in the whole under-
 taking."
 It is plausibly implied in
 some editorials that the right-
 ists in China have been buttress-
 ing                                                               their positions with cita-
 tions of Soviet experience and
 of Soviet attitudes toward the
 radical Chinese programs.   Mos-
 cow had seemed embarrassed by
 the preposterous claims made
 for the "leap" and had given
 them little publicity; the So-
 viet party was clearly hostile
 to the ideological claims made
 for the commune program; and
 Soviet spokesman, including
 Khrushchev,had publicly  and
 privately criticized the com-
 mune concept. The arguments at-
 tributed in Peiping's comment
 to opponents of the communes
 are similar to those made in
 articles by Soviet theorists,
 One editorial emphasized
 that the Chinese people have
 been making remarkable progress
 under "their own party" and
 "their own leader."  The Chi-
 nese party leadership--under
 the "great leader" Mao--is pre-
 sented as a true Marxist-Lenin-
 ist leadership which exploits
 to the fullest the potential of
 mass undertakings, in "direct
 contrast" to an "opportunist"
 type of leadership.
 Further in this vein, the
 Chinese leadership,   far  from
 being guilty of  "fanaticism','
 as hostile observers    assert,
 is said to know well that there
 are not "ready patterns for
 everything."  Soviet experience
 is available for "reference and
 study" and is "important... but"
 the Chinese party in "building
 socialism" is faced with spe-
 cial conditions--a backward
 agrarian economy and a huge
 population.   The problem of in-
 tegrating Marxist-Leninist'doc-
 trine with Chinese conditions
 has been "solved" by Mao--e.g.,
 the "leap" and the commune
 program.

 CURRENT INTE LL:tGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 September 1959
 Peiping's threats against
 the "right opportunists" in the
 Chinese party have been ambiva-
 lent.   Some statements offer
 the rightists the hope of re-
 demption.   Other formulations
 treat them as already lost--as
 having joined  "enemy elements"
 and as having engaged in "crim-
 inal activity."
 Both lines seem to be ac-
 curate pointers.   That is, most
 of the "right opportunists," by
 seizing the opportunity to move
 to the left, will probably be
 saved,   Others, however, have
 probably already been marked
 for punishment, and more will
 fall as the party leaders con-
 tinue to exhort the party to
 "go all out."
 The chances are that the
 party leadership will begin to
 select its scapegoats at the
 provincial level, as in 1957-
 58, when several provincial
 leaders were purged for a simi-
 lar lack of confidence in  and
 enthusiasm for the party's basic
 programs.   If action at this
 level does not stop the criti-
 cism and restore morale--as  it
 probably will not--it is likely
 that higher level figures will
 be toppled.
 Mao apparently does not
 intend to reach into the polit-
 buro,   Those politburo members
 who have been to the right of
 Mao and the party-machine fig-
 ures.in recent years--senior
 administrators and economic
 specialists--nevertheless agreed
 with the dominant leaders that a
 period of rapid progress was
 ahead, apparently viewed the
 "leap" and the commune program
 as worthwhile experiments, and
 seemed to be trying their best
 to implement the programs. More-
 over, although they may continue
 to have reservations about Mao's
 programs, they probably will
 ,again  cooperate  in  Mao's ef-
 fort
 Despite Peiping's professed
 satisfaction with the economic
 situation at the end of June
 1959, production figures for the
 first half of the year indicate
 that the "continued leap for-
 ward" planned for 1959 has not
 succeeded.   The regime's deci-
 sion to reduce targets set forth
 in the original 1959 national
 economic plan probably results
 largely from this failure, as
 well as from a realization that
 there is little prospect for a
 noticeably faster rate of prog-
 ress in the second half of the
 year.
 The total value of indus-
 trial production at the end of
 June was only 44 percent of the
 year's goal, whereas 47-48 per-
 cent is ordinarily fulfilled
 by the end of June.   Only 19
 of the 33 principal industrial
 targets for 1959 were fulfilled
 by 40 percent or better.   The
 14 major industrial products
 for which fulfillment was 30
 percent or less included steel,
 cement, sulfuric acid, power
 equipment, locomotives, and
 rolling stock.   The products
 in which the poorest showing
 was made were those most im-
 portant to development in the
 building, transport, power,
 chemical,  and consumer-goods
 industries.
 Faced with industrial pro-
 duction levels which in no way
 approached earlier plans for
 the "continued leap forward"

 badly maintained equipment, and
 with shortages of raw materials
 which preclude greater increases

 in the second half of the year,
 Peiping had to reduce annual
 targets to a level more nearly
 approximating feasible rates
 of development.
 The performance by agricul-
 ture was even less satisfactory.
 Whereas the summer grain harvest
 normally accounts for 30 percent
 of total annual output, the 1959
 output of winter wheat, winter
 coarse grains, and early rice
 was only 13 percent of the orig-

 sions, based on greatly reduced
 figures for 1958 grain produc-
 tion, bring the summer crop to
 27 percent of total grain out-
 put for the year. Regardless of
 statistical juggling, the 1959
 summer harvest constitutes only
 a 2-percent increase over last
 year's officially claimed sum-
 mer harvest.   With adverse
 weather conditions dimming pros-
 pects for any sizable increase
 in the fall harvest, even the

 COMMUNIST CHINA PREPARES TO ENTER INTERNATIONAL MARITIME TRADE
 Except for occasional voy-
 ages down the South China coast
 to North Vietnam, Communist Chi-
 na still uses foreign-flag mer-
 chant ships to carry its over-
 seas trade.   Renewed purchases
 of ocean-going vessels from the
 West, however, plus a stepped-up
 program of domestic shipbuilding
 and training of merchant marine
 crews, suggest that Peiping is
 preparing to enter international
 maritime trade on its own.
 Since the beginning of 1958,
 27 vessels suitable for operation
 in overseas trade have been add-
 ed to the Chinese merchant
 marine.   Sixteen of these were
 purchased from Western countries,
 increasing total merchant ton-
 nage by 100,000 tons, or more
 than 25 percent.   In addition,
 six major vessels were purchased
 from bloc countries last year
 and another five were produced
 in Chinese shipyards.   These
 acquisitions increase by 37 per-
 cent the total tonnage of the
 Chinese Communist merchant fleet,
 which now stands at about 375,000
 gross tons  and  includes  113
 vessels.   At  present,   all
 these  vessels  are  engaged
 in  trade  along  the    Chi-
 na coast.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 September 1959
 Sometime last year, another
 Chinese merchant shipping agency
 was created--the Ocean Transport
 Bureau.   This organization has
 been developing a maritime train-
 ing program and promoting do-
 mestic construction of ocean-
 going vessels, apparently in
 furtherance of plans to develop
 a merchant fleet capable of en-
 gaging in international trade.
 Organizations already exist for
 all other phases of foreign
 shipping operations.
 In conjunction with the es-
 tablishment of the Ocean Trans-
 port Bureau, there has been in-
 creased recruiting of Chinese
 for service in the merchant
 fleet.   For years small numbers
 of Chinese have been gaining
 experience aboard Polish ocean-
 going vessels.   Plans to enter
 the Chinese Communist merchant
 fleet in international trade
 may thus be contingent on the
 availability of sufficient
 trained crews.
 Peiping has an ambitious
 domestic construction program
 calling for five large vessels
 to be finished by the end of
 1961.   One of these--the 12,000-
 gross-ton "Leap Forward"--should
 be completed in the near future,
 and two others sometime in 1960.
 Launched at Dairen last Novem-
 ber, the "Leap Forward" is the
 first vessel of this size to be
 built at a Chinese shipyard.
 It should be prepared to go to
 sea within the next six months
 and quite possibly will be the    25X1
 Chinese vessel nominated to
 make the initial venture into
 international trade.

 The formation on 30 August

 from Addis Ababa and probably
 will contribute to a further
 deterioration in Ethiopian-
 Somali relations.
 The PNM was formulated in
 Mogadiscio by a preparatory coin-

 action the Somali Government
 now is supporting the PNM, ap-

 ment's more extreme leaders.
 The nationalist conferees
 were permitted use of the leg-

 Mogadiscio for the preparatory

 in Mogadiscio devoted extensive
 coverage to the nationalists'
 activities, and Mogadiscio has
 been selected as the site for a
 350,000 Somalis live.
 Addis Ababa, which
 has long sought to
 establish hegemony
 over the Somali ter-
 ritories, has warned
 it'will resort to
 arms to protect its
 Ogaden Province, and
 it recently activated
 a frontier guard to
 patrol the Somali bor-
 der area.   Ethiopia
 demonstrated its ex-
 treme sensitivity
 over the prospect of
 even limited Somali
 unity last February
 when Addis Ababa's
 controlled radio and
 press bitterly  at-
 tacked the United
 States for support-
 ing London's decision
 to permit a future
 association between
 the British protec-
 torate and Somalia.
 While Somalia

 BELGIAN CONGO PROBLEMS
 The Belgian Congo's grow-
 ing  economic  and                     political
 problems have become a matter
 of increasing concern to Brus-
 sels.   On 3 September liberal-
 minded Minister of the Congo
 Maurice van Hemelrijck resigned
 because the government refused
 his plan for speedier political
 reform in the Congo.  His res-
 ignation may arouse an adverse
 reaction among Congolese polit-
 ical groups who regard him as
 their spokesman in Brussels,
 and it could have important re-
 percussions in Belgium by giv-
 ing the opposition Socialists
 an opportunity to attack the
 coalition Catholic-Liberal gov-
 ernment.
 Since  the   race   riot   in
 Leopoldville last January,Bel-
 gium has been confronted with
 serious problems in the Congo
 arising both from economic dif-
 ficulties and from increasing
 African political agitation.
 The mineral-rich colony has been
 hard hit by the low world prices
 of primary commodities, and for
 the first time Brussels will
 have to give the Congo budget-
 ary assistance.   Investors' con-
 fidence in Congo stocks has been
 so shaken by the political sit-
 uation that the value of those
 stocks has dropped over _25 per-
 cent in the Brussels financial
 market.
 Brussels' announcement last
 January of a program of politi-
 cal reform for the Congo--which
 envisaged the early establish-
 ment of an autonomous state
 with increasing legislative and
 executive powers and eventual
 independence--has led to the
 formation of a spate of Congo-
 lese political parties often
 based  on  tribal  or  regional
 loyalties.  Many of these par-
 ties have become critical of
 Belgium's gradual program and
 have demanded a speed-up in the
 Congo's preparation for inde-
 pendence.   Several nationalist
 leaders have been arrested, and
 the acting governor general re-
 cently described the political
 situation in the Congo as "very
 grave."
 In the forefront of the po-
 litical  agitation  is  Joseph
 Kasavubu, the African leader of
 the lower Congo valley area.
 He is opposing Belgium's policy
 of a unified Congo state by
 seeking to create a regional
 tribal state with its own execu-
 tive.                                                        He has called for elec-
 tions in late fall to select
 its officers, demonstrating his
 considerable hold over his tri-?
 bal group by initiating a suc-
 cessful  regional  boycott  of
 recent municipal council elec-
 tions.  These were designed as
 the first step in Brussels' pro-
 gram for the creation of.Congo-
 lese consultative institutions.
 Faced with the deteriorat-
 ing situation, Van Hemelrijck
 in late August asked the Bel-
 gian cabinet to speed up the
 pace of reform by establishing
 a Congolese government and leg-
 islative council in March 1960.
 The cabinet refused to accept
 his program--particularly the
 grant of legislative powers--
 and Van Hemelrijck submitted
 his resignation.  The cabinet
 adopted a compromise plan, and
 a Congo expert, Auguste de Sch-
 ryver, was appointed the new
 minister.  Although he is a sup-
 porter of Van Hemelrijck, De
 Schryver is considered more mod-
 erate in his actions than his
 predecessor and may be able to
 deal more successfully with the
 diverse political elements in
 Brussels.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 September 1959
 De Gaulle has announced he     portedly a "nonpolitical" offi
 will make a public statement of       cer.
 his policy toward Algeria on
 16 September, the day after the
 UN General Assembly convenes.
 Algerian rebel officials,
 in reacting to press reports
 that De Gaulle will outline a
 program providing autonomy for
 Algeria, have indicated annoy-
 ance that such a program might
 be "imposed from above," i.e.,
 implemented by France.  Algerian
 representatives at the Arab
 League conference in Casablanca
 state flatly that there can be
 no cease-fire in Algeria without
 prior negotiations between the
 French and the insurgent National
 Liberation Front (FLN),   The
 rebels probably feel that their
 capability for military and ter-
 rorist activity gives them a
 veto over any unilaterally im-
 posed French program in Algeria,
 and that eventually the French
 must negotiate with them.
 The military in Algeria are
 reportedly reassured by De
 Gaulle's continued commitment to
 pacification.  They continue to
 act as a brake on any policy
 statement which implies accept-
 ance of independence for Al-
 geria, and any proposal of a
 liberal solution in De Gaulle's
 statement will probably be care-
 fully blurred to retain the
 army's confidence.   France's
 ranking soldier, Marshal Al-
 phonse Juin, warned publicly on
 5 September that there must be
 no "appeasement of the US" in
 any new plan for an Algerian
 solution.   Meanwhile, however,
 De Gaulle and the cabinet on 9
 September replaced Army Chief
 of Staff Henri Zeller, who has
 been identified in the press
 with the "hard line" on Algeria,
 by General  Andre  Demetz,  re-
 Two Algerians, self-ap-
 pointed intermediaries between
 Paris and the rebels, have re-
 portedly discussed with rebel
 leaders a statement of principles
 the intermediaries hope would be
 mutually acceptable and which
 might be issued prior to any
 cease-fire talks.
 In the proposed statement
 the two parties would agree that
 the Algerian people have a right
 to self-determination; that a
 military solution is impossible;
 and that following a cease-fire
 Algeria would be administered by
 an "interim administration" ac-
 ceptable to both sides which
 would prepare for voting on
 Algeria's future status.  The
 unlikelihood of French accept-
 ance of any such plan, however,
 is underscored by Premier Debre's
 vigorous repudiation on 8 Septem-
 ber of any political negotiations
 and particularly of any "Algerian
 state."
 The rebels have long fav-
 ored a negotiated settlement of
 the war, and individual leaders
 have indicated that self-deter-
 mnination might be an acceptable
 alternative to independence.
 The rebels, however, will almost
 certainly demand some status
 for the FLN, despite De Gaulle's
 emphasis that it does not repre-
 sent the Algerian people.
 French pressure on rebel
 military forces within Algeria
 continues, and rebel strength,
 now is confined largely to areas
 in northeastern Algeria where
 the French are concentrating
 their major military effort.

 Czechoslovakia,  East
 Germany, Hungary, and Poland,
 possibly taking their cue from
 the very high priority being
 given housing in the USSR, re-
 cently have announced long-term
 housing plans vastly more am-
 bitious than any in the past.
 If fulfilled, they will do much
 to reduce critical housing short-
 ages arising from wartime damage
 and years of neglect.   Bulgaria
 and Rumania may soon follow
 suit.   Underlying the plans is
 a desire to reduce the embarrass-

 housing to that in Western
 Europe, to lessen popular dis-
 satisfaction, and to improve
 worker 3erfDrmance in key in-
 dustrial areas.

 deterioration of the housing
 situation seems inevitable; dur-
 ing the next few years. Hungary's
 plan would not eliminate the
 housing shortage even by 1975,
 as official propaganda alleges,
 but appreciable headway will
 probably have been made by then.
 Under its plan, Poland should
 stabilize its  housing  situation
 by the early 1960s and then
 gradually diminish its huge short-
 age during the late 1960s and
 early 1970s.
 The satellites will rely
 heavily on expansion of housing
 construction by industrial enter-
 prises and tenant cooperatives.
 This locally sponsored scheme
 for construction, still relatively
 untried, has the dual advantage
 of reducing government expendi-
 tures for housing and of in-
 creasing the amount of property
 in the "socialist sector" as
 resources from heavy industry
 and other sectors of the econ-
 omy which in the past have en-
 joyed much higher priorities.
 The first tests of the sincerity
 of the four satellites
 in this will come in
 East Germany and Po-
 land, which plan sub-
 stantially higher
 rates of housing con-
 struction during
 1959-60 than they have
 ever achieved.
 East Germany's
 claim that its hous-
 ing shortage will be
 eliminated by 1965
 is greatly exagger-
 ated, but the prob-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 September 1959
 The immediate threat of
 revolutionary action in Argen-
 tina was dispelled on 4 Septem-
 ber when President Frondizi
 acceded to army demands for
 changes in top command posts.
 Frondizi's action, however,
 strengthened that army faction
 seeking greater influence on
 executive policy, especially
 regarding the Peronistas and
 Communists.   Threats of force
 from dissident army elements,
 intended mainly to oust the war
 secretary, apparently alarmed
 high navy and air force officers,
 who feared civil war.
 The difficulties were pre-
 cipitated by the army commander
 in chief, Major General Carlos
 Toranzo Montero, who ordered
 changes in several key army
 commands without clearing them
 with War Secretary Anaya.   His
 dismissal by Anaya on 2 Septem-
 ber prompted strong enough pro-
 tests to indicate that Toranzo
 Montero had majority support
 among key army commands.   On 3
 September, therefore, he es-
 tablished a "rebel command" in
 a Buenos Aires army school to
 demand the ouster of Anaya but
 not of Frondizi, a personal
 friend.   Important outlying
 garrisons offered support.
 A truce was negotiated on
 4 September,  Toranzo Montero
 was reinstated in his post,
 Anaya resigned, and Major Gen-
 eral Rodolfo Larcher, a proms'--
 nent intermediary in the nego-
 tiations, was named war sec-

 COMMUNAL PROBLEMS ENDANGER STABILITY IN MALAYA
 The national elections in
 Malaya on 19 August reflected
 a continuing trend toward polar-
 ization of voting along racial
 lines which, if not halted, may
 eventually destroy political
 stability in this two-year-old
 democracy.  The ruling Alliance
 party, a moderate pro-Western
 coalition of three communal or-
 ganizations, now is the only
 party which seriously advocates
 and attempts to implement its
 policy of interracial political
 cooperation--a policy essential
 to stability in Malaya, where
 slightly less than half the
 people are Malay.,   37 percent
 are Chinese, and 11 percent are
 Indian.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 September 1959
 This conflict of interest
 reached a climax in mid-July,
 when a complete break between
 the MCA and UMNO was narrowly
 averted.  While personal ambi-
 tions and jealousy played a
 part in the dispute, the racial
 issue was basic.  The MCA de-
 manded 40 Chinese candidates
 under the Alliance banner in
 order to forestall a two-thirds
 Malay majority in the House
 which many Chinese leaders
 feared would lead to unilat-
 eral discriminatory amendment
 of the constitution by the
 Malays.
 The MCA also demanded the
 use of Chinese in school exam-
 inations as an alternate to the
 official Malay and English lan-
 guages.   Leaders of the UMNO
 refused to accede to the Chi-
 nese demands, which they be-
 lieved would be politically
 disastrous for the UMNO.  The
 latter had already been hurt
 by surprising PMIP gains in
 elections in two rural, Malay-
 dominated east coast states. At
 the time, PMIP campaigners were
 stressing the theme that the
 UMNO had already "sold out" to
 the Chinese.
 The UMNO-MCA split has
 only been temporarily healed,
 at the cost of numerous defec-
 tions from the MCA, and further
 serious disputes are likely to
 arise.   It is, in fact, doubt-
 ful that effective and lasting
 political cooperation between
 racial groups in Malaya can
 ever be achieved.  The limited
 cohesion the Alliance does en-
 joy is at least partly engen-
 dered by fear among the better
 informed that a breakup of the
 Alliance would lead to wide-
 spread racial conflict.
 Prime Minister Abdul Rah-
 man has been the'key figure in
 holding the Alliance together.
 He is the only political figure
 in Malaya who enjoys widespread
 popularity among all racial
 groups.  His leadership appears
 essential if any real progress
 is to be made toward the govern-
 ment's long-range goal of sub-
 stituting a Malayan society for
 the present heterogeneous Malay,
 Chinese, and Indian societies.
 Opposition Parties
 To date there appears to
 be no satisfactory substitute
 for the Alliance, as all opposi-
 tion parties have tended to be
 irresponsible on racial matters.
 If an effective "loyal" opposi-
 tion were to evolve, it would
 probably come from the left and
 might develop around the Social-
 ist Front, now a loose and weak
 coalition of the Chinese-dom-
 inated Labor party and the
 Malay-dominated People's party.
 A multiracial Socialist. party
 in Malaya faces many obstacles,
 however, the biggest being that,
 in general, a poor Malay feels
 he has much more in common with
 a ..rich. Malay than he does with
 a poor Chinese.   Similarly the
 Chinese feel closer to fellow
 members of their own nationality
 than to their Malay economic
 counterparts.
 Economic Development
 If Malaya is eventually
 to solve its communal problems,
 the relatively good economic
 conditions and the government's
 development programs will play
 an important role.  A large,
 well-conceived rubber-replanting
 program begun in 1953 will re-
 sult in a major expansion of
 rubber production beginning next
 year as the newhigh-yield trees

 AFGHANISTAN'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
 Afghanistan is making
 steady but slow progress in
 modernizing its economy, al-
 though lack of trained person-
 nel and inadequate financial
 resources have forced Kabul to
 curtail its original over-ambi-
 tious plans.  The program now
 being carried out is generally
 well conceived, with major em-
 phasis on transportation and
 lesser emphasis on agriculture,
 power, and industry.   When the
 projects now scheduled or un-
 der way are completed, Afghan-
 istan will have a more bal-
 anced economy, and its major
 economic handicap--inadequate
 transportation facilities--
 should be largely overcome.
 Reliance on foreign aid in fi-
 nancing the plan will impose a
 .heavy burden of debt repayment
 on the country.
 Background
 Afghanistan's first at-
 tempt at economic development
 was conceived and executed in
 the 1930s by the Banke Mille, a
 private development bank.  The
 bank drew up a modest program
 with emphasis on light indus-
 tries, particularly cotton tex-
 tiles.  While the government
 was directly involved in parts
 of the program, its major role
 was to provide the bulk of the
 necessary, foreign exchange.
 This program made moderate
 progress during the thirties,
 but World War II subsequently
 made it impossible to obtain
 the needed imports of capital
 goods.
 Afghanistan emerged from
 World War II with relatively
 large foreign-exchange hold-
 ings because of the lack of
 wartime imports and the good
 prices it had received for
 karakul,  its principal export.
 Abdul Majid Zaboli--who was
 both head of the Banke Mille
 and minister of national economy
 --drafted a five-year economic plan
 in the belief that the large
 foreign exchange holdings could
 speed up development.   Within a
 few years, however, it became
 evident that the plan was be-
 yond Afghanistan's financial
 ability and that large-scale
 foreign assistance was neces-
 sary.
 Even if Afghanistan had
 been able to secure all the
 necessary foreign aid it de-
 sired instead of only a small
 part, the success of the plan
 would have required the con-
 tinued close cooperation of the
 Banke Mille and the government,
 a cooperation that did not last.
 While the Bank Mille was respon-
 sible for most of the country's
 economic development, it had
 made very large profits and had
 acquired a near--monopolistic
 control over important parts of
 the economy.  Thus it became a
 target for government attacks.
 Abdul Majid Zaboli lost his
 post as minister of national
 economy in 1951, and relations
 between the bank and the govern-
 ment deteriorated.   Since most
 Afghans possessing business or
 technical abilities were directly
 or indirectly associated with
 the bank, economic development,
 except for a few projects, made
 little progress.

 country.       Both Daud and his
 brother Prince Naim--the dep-
 uty prime minister and foreign
 minister--were convinced that' '
 their people would become in-
 creasingly impatient over the
 lack of economic development in
 Afghanistan in view of the
 progress being made in neigh-
 boring countries.  They be-
 lieved that if the government
 did not bring about at least
 limited progress, the royal
 family would eventually be
 overthrown.
 The first basic problem
 Daud had to resolve in order
 to speed economic development
 was the question of the gov-
 ernment's relAtionship to the
 Banke Mille.  Daud.could either
 return to the earlier reliance
 on the bank as the moving force
 for the country's development
 or take for the government the
 role the bank had played. Daud
 chose the latter course, stead-
 ily placing increased controls
 on the private sector of the
 economy, particularly the Banke
 Mille.
 The second problem Daud
 faced was that of securing
 large-scale foreign aid. Where-
 as in the past Afghanistan had
 attempted to keep foreign powers
 out of the country to the ex-
 tent possible, Daud now sought
 to induce them to play a role
 in Afghan affairs by. sponsoring
 and financing economic develop-

 both the West and the Soviet

 thereby enabling the country
 to continue its policy of neu-

 profitable form.
 Afghanistan had secured a
 $21,000,000 loan from the United
 States Export-Import Bank in
 1951 for development of the
 Helmand Valley.   In 1954 Afghan-
 istan accepted Soviet and Czech
 offers of $10,800,000 in aid to
 construct a bakery, cement fac-
 tory, and fruit cannery, pave
 roads in Kabul, and undertake
 several smaller projects.
 Five-Year Plan
 In 1954 the government
 also began to draft its own
 five-year plan, but little ef-
 fort was devoted to the task
 until the announcement of the
 $100,000,000 Soviet loan in
 December 1955.  This announce-
 ment, made during the visit of
 Khrushchev and Bulganin, re-
 sulted in a flurry of activity,
 and a Five-Year Plan (1956-61)
 was prepared for use in discus-
 sion with the Soviet economic
 mission which visited Kabul in
 March 1956 to allocate the loan
 to specific projects.
 Total cost of the plan was
 estimated at approximately
 $325,000,000 exclusive of debt
 repayments on past loans for
 economic development.  Total
 foreign exchange requirements of
 the plan were about $180,000,000,

 it was apparent that this move
 would not result in adequate
 revenues.  There was a reliance
 on deficit financing and a sub-
 stantial credit expansion be-

 sulted in substantial inflation
 and pressure on the balance of
 payments.
 Kabul apparently concluded
 that it could not safely finance
 1961.  The major prob, -AFGHANISTAN

 of Afghan administra-
 tive and technical
 personnel.   This has
 led the government
 to attempt to reach
 a modus vivendi with
 both the Banke Mille
 and the private sector
 during the past 18
 months, although so
 far this has meant
 merely a reduction of
 hostility rather than
 real cooperation. In
 addition, the United
 States has not im-
 plemented its proj-
 ects as rapidly as
 Kabul expected, and
 Afghan-Soviet dis-
 agreements over the
 cost of certain proj-
 ects have delayed
 their construction.
 Although the $100,-

 was extended over
 three years ago, only
 about three fourths

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY.SUMMARY
 10 September 1959
 When it became apparent
 that the plan could not be car-
 ried out on schedule, a number
 of projects--chiefly for irriga-
 tion--were postponed.                               This de-
 cision, coupled with the recent
 acceptance of a'Soviet offer to
 improve the road between Herat
 and Kandahar, placed top pri-
 ority on transportation, with
 agriculture receiving reduced
 emphasis.   Despite these delays
 in implementing the plan, local
 currency expenditures by Kabul
 for economic development in
 1957-58 were as much as 25 per-
 cent over 1956-57.
 Progress to Date
 The economy has been
 strengthened in recent years,
 but major improvements are still
 in the future.   New port facil-
 ities have been completed on the
 Amu Darya.,   Both the United
 States and the USSR have started
 construction of an improved road
 system.   Ariana Airline has been
 improved, and the new Kandahar
 international airport will soon
 be open.  The country's largest
 power plant, a cement plant,
 and the Jungalot industrial
 complex in Kabul are in opera-
 tion.  The Helmand Valley proj-
 ect has made only limited prog-
 ress, however, and most agricul-
 tural progress has taken place
 north of the Hindu Kush moun-
 tain ranges.
 Production of food grains
 appears to have increased sub-
 stantially between 1948-52 and
 1955-56, although poor weather
 has hampered production in re-
 cent years.  Cotton production
 more than doubled between 1948-
 52 and 1955-56, and the output
 of products such as cotton tex-
 tiles, matches, and soap and of
 electric  power  has  increased
 significantly.  While construc-
 tion of the Gulbahar textile
 mill has fallen behind schedule,
 this project when completed
 within the next few years should
 at least triple Afghanistan's
 output of cotton textiles.
 A major failure, however,
 has been Kabul's inability to
 expand coal production more
 rapidly.  Despite an increase
 from about 5,000 tons in 1949-
 50 to over 25,000 tons in 1956-
 57, production will have to be
 increased more rapidly than now
 appears likely if adequate fuel
 is to be available for the ex-
 panded requirements of the new
 industrial projects now under
 construction.
 Outlook for Future Progress
 Recognizing the necessity
 for reducing its short-run'am-
 bitions, Kabul has nevertheless
 been working on several major
 reforms which should result in
 increased economic growth in
 the future.  The government is
 introducing a new bugetary and
 accounting system which should
 greatly improve administrative
 practice and provide much-im-
 proved instruments for carrying
 out economic policies.   In addi-
 tion, a high-level committee has
 been appointed to recommend a
 comprehensive reform of the tax-
 ation system.   Such reform
 should result in substantially
 increased government revenue.
 While some of this increased
 revenue is likely to be used
 for nondevelopment and military
 expenditures--particularly if
 Kabul continuesto expand its
 armed forces--there should be
 more funds available for eco-
 nomic development as well.
 When the projects remain-
 ing in the plan are completed,
 Afghanistan will have a
 much
 better
 balanced economy.
 Agri-
 culture
 and industry are
 likely
 to make
 modest progress,
 the
 education system will be
 im-
 proved, and--most important of
 all--for the first time there
 will be an adequate road and air
 transportation system.  There

 Foreign Economic Relations
 Afghanistan has received
 at least $357,700,000 in for-
 eign economic aid since 1951,
 of which about $300,000,000 has
 been extended for use during
 the five-year-plan period.
 Afghan leaders initially were
 inclined to accept any loans
 offered, but by late 1957 af-
 ter having accepted $213,085,000
 in loans--including $32,391,000
 for arms from Czechoslovakia
 and the USSR--they became con-
 cerned over their repayment
 ability and announced a policy
 of accepting no new foreign
 loans.   Since then the addi-
 tional foreign aid Afghanistan
 has received from the United
 States and the USSR has all
 been in the form of grants.
 Afghan annual repayment
 of foreign-.loans amounts to
 $7,000,000-$9,000,000 at pres-
 ent and will reach a peak of
 about $13,000,000 in 1964, af-
 ter which it will decline to
 about,$9,000,000 annually. These
 obligations are a
 heavy burden on a
 country whose total
 exports are about
 $50,000,000 annually,
 and its ability to
 meet its obligations
 depends on the extent
 to which the develop-
 ment, program enables
 Kabul to increase ex-
 ports or decrease im-
 ports.
 Foreign Trade
 While the inade-
 quacy of trade statis-
 tics prevents any pre-
 cise analysis of the
 country's foreign
 trade, it is possible
 to discern its broad
 trends.  Tradition-
 ally, Afghanistan ex-
 ported karakul to the
 West--chiefly the

 manufactured goods, and ex-
 ported cotton and fruits to
 India in return for cotton
 textiles and tea.
 During recent years, how-
 ever, there has been a major
 reorientation in the direction
 of Afghan trade.   In part this
 resulted from Kabul's diffi-
 culty in retaining its tradi-
 tional markets for certain com-
 modities, particularly in India
 and Pakistan, but the Soviet
 drive to increase its economic
 relations with Afghanistan
 through the offer of especially
 attractive terms has also been
 an important factor.  Afghan
 exports to the USSR increased
 from 17 percent of total ex-
 ports in 1951-52 to 28 percent
 in 1956-57, and Afghan imports
 from the USSR rose from 16 to
 36 percent of total imports
 during the same period.  While
 no detailed figures are avail-
 able after 1956-57, there are
 indications that about 40 per-
 cent of Afghanistan's total
 foreign trade now is with the
 USSR, and 5 percent is with
 other bloc countries, chiefly
 Czechoslovakia.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 September 1959
 Afghanistan's foreign
 trade has also increased sharply
 in recent years.      Total exports
 rose by over 100 percent in
 value between 1951-52 and 1956-
 57, and during the same period
 imports grew by over 150 per-
 cent, largely because of Kabul's
 ability to finance the plan by
 foreign aid.
 The completion of the pres-
 ently scheduled development
 projects--probably by about
 1964--should enable Afghanistan
 to repay its foreign debt obli-
 gations.  The new road system
 will make possible a major ex-
 pansion in the country's al-
 ready large fruit exports. When
 the textile expansion program
 is completed, Kabul will be able
 to reduce sharply its textile
 imports, which now are its most
 expensive   import.  There is
 also a reasonable chance that
 the Soviet-sponsored petroleum
 exploration program in the north-
 ern part of the country will be
 commercially successful and
 further improve the balance of
 trade.   In any case, Afghanistan
 may be able to obtain a post-
 ponement of payment obligations
 if it has difficulty with the
 present repayment schedule.
 Afghanistan's heavy reli-
 ance on trade with the bloc, how-
 ever, makes it vulnerable to So-
 viet pressure tactics.   If the
 USSR were to halt its trade, the
 impact on the domestic economy
 would be serious.   While the
 subsistence nature of most of
 the economy and Kabul's modest
 foreign exchange reserves would
 temporarily cushion the impact
 of Soviet pressures, economic
 conditions, especially in urban
 areas, would probably deteriorate
 fairly rapidly, and the develop-
 ment program would have to be
 sharply curtailed.
 The completion of the devel-
 opment projects--particularly
 the road system--would, however,
 make Afghanistan less vulnerable
 to Soviet economic pressure than
 at present.  The US-sponsored
 Afghan-Pakistani transit devel-
 opment project would be of con-
 siderable value should Kabul
 try to reorient trade away from
 the bloc, and the new roads
 within the country would enable
 commodities to move to the Pak-
 istani border more rapidly and
 more cheaply.
 In addition, Afghanistan's
 import needs are relatively small
 and readily available in the
 West, although Kabul probably
 would require some additional
 Western aid until it found new
 export markets.  The problem
 of finding Western markets for
 certain of the country's ex-
 ports would be more difficult,
 but these exports, because of
 their small quantity, could
 probably be absorbed without
 dislocation of the present pat-
 tern of free world trade.  The
 prices Afghanistan would re-
 ceive, however, would probably
 be less advantageous than those
 paid by the USSR.  While the
 lower prices available in West-
 ern markets would result in
 some loss to Afghanistan, this
 loss would be more than offset
 by the cessation of debt repay-
 ments to the USSR which prob-
 ably would follow any Soviet
 trade embargo
