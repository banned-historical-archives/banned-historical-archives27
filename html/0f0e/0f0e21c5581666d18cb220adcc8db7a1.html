 The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr. Harold Wilson (standing),
 addressing the opening session of the tenth meeting of the SEATO Council
 of Ministers in London, on May 3, 1965.  On his right is the Minister
 of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, Mr. Z.A. Bhutto, and on his left, the then
 Secretary-General of SEATO, Mr. Konthi Suphamongkhon, the Under-
 Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, Mr. Librado D. Cayco,
 and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Thailand, Mr. Thanat Khoman.
 The Situation in South-East Asia
 South-East Asia continues to be harassed by aggression.  Free nations
 are forced to cope with the tactics of infiltration and subversion in order to
 preserve their right to direct their own destinies.  Aggression is aggression, no
 matter what cloak it hides under; and people want to be free.
 The tactics of Communist infiltration and subversion pose a problem which
 has world-wide implications: can a small nation successfully defend itself against
 this aggression which slithers from the pit of deceit, terror and human bondage?
 Or, with the aid of allies, can this aggression be scotched?

 The issue is joined in South Viet-Nam.  In 1954, the Geneva Agreement
 divided Vietnam at the 17th parallel.  At this time the Vietnamese people were
 allowed to move from one part to the other and it is worth recalling that one
 million of them left their homes in the North and moved to the South.  They
 "voted with their feet" against Communism.
 For five years uneasy peace existed.  In South Viet-Nam, people were
 developing their economy, improving their living conditions.  The prospect for
 peace and progress was good.
 In 1959, however, the Government of North Viet-Nam called for a full-scale
 attack by the Viet Cong on the Government of South Viet-Nam.  Men and
 weapons were sent, and military direction was given by the North Vietnamese
 Government.  The International Control Commission in 1962 reported these
 facts. This attack was a deliberate attempt by the Communists to harass the
 Government of South Viet-Nam.  The contrast between the improving economic
 and social conditions in South Viet-Nam and the harshness of life in North
 Viet-Nam may have been a factor in this new attempt at domination.
 Whatever the precipitating factor of the decisions, tens of thousands of
 armed men, some of them in regular battalions, have been sent from North
 Viet-Nam in a campaign of conquest.
 The tactics of the North Vietnamese-directed forces have made the name
 "Viet Cong" hateful in South Viet-Nam and in the world. Through deliberate
 use of terror tactics, they have imposed their will on some of the people-a
 variation of the same terror on which Stalin based his control and which his
 successors denounced.
 The Viet Cong and the political instrument of the Communists, the
 National Liberation Front, have created nothing in South Viet-Nam.  They
 have produced nothing for the people. They have contributed nothing.  In fact,
 they boast of "living off the country" - a cancerous boast.
 Unable to recruit sufficient volunteers in South Viet-Nam for their armed
 forces, the Viet Cong have had to resort to hauling young men off by force.
 Unable to convince teachers and civic leaders, the Viet Cong have resorted to
 murder and terrorism.  These are tactics of infamy.  But these tactics proclaim
 failure: by using them, the Viet Cong tacitly admit that people do not willingly
 support them.
 This repugnance for the Viet Cong is demonstrated by the present movement
 of refugees from the Communist-dominated areas into those controlled by the
 Government of South Viet-Nam.  There are few indeed who move to the Viet
 Cong areas.
 The people of South Viet-Nam and their Government are engaged in
 combatting the Communist aggression while they continue their programs for

 economic and social improvement.  Massive economic assistance has been provided
 by friendly nations.  The United States has contributed the greater share; over
 thirty other free nations (including all of the SEATO members) have demonstrated
 their support for the people of South Viet-Nam by giving assistance in various
 forms.
 Several nations have, at the request of the South Vietnamese Government,
 supplied comba~' troops to repel the Communist North Vietnamese guerrillas.
 In 1964,  five gears after the North Vietnamese attacked, South Vietnamese and
 American air forces began to bomb military targets in North Viet-Nam to
 interdict the so4rces and routes of supply of men and arms.
 The cauO of freedom is thus being strongly defended.
 Commun'st probing for expansionist goals was also directed more closely
 toward Thailand this past year.  In implicit admission of the Communist Chinese
 regime's intentions, its Foreign Minister stated that guerrilla warfare could be
 expected in Thailand before the year is ended.  Communist intentions being
 already well known, the Foreign Minister's statement served mainly to reveal
 his arrogance.
 The Thais Government has long been alert to the threat of Communist
 expansionism.  Is signature to the SEATO Treaty in 1954 was based on
 recognition of that danger.  During the intervening years it has strengthened
 its own defences, as well as acted in co-operation with SEATO allies in defence
 exercises.
 Thailand has also prospered remarkably under the competent guidance
 of its leaders. Its outstanding progress, in economic and social fields, in effect
 constitute a challenge to Communist nations in the area, a beacon to the people
 disheartened by ''the rigidity, the poverty, the cruelty of Communist regimes.
 Communist parties must impose strict thought discipline on their agents in
 Thailand, lest the benefits of the free society there turn their allegiance away
 from their foreign masters.
 The neut ality of Laos, agreed by the 1962 Geneva Conference, continues
 to be violated b the presence of North Vietnamese armed forces, by the actions
 of the Communit Pathet Lao and by the use of Laotian territory to send men
 and supplies to the Viet Cong in South Viet-Nam.  The flouting of international
 agreements by the Communists demonstrates the urgent need for guaranteed
 means of enforcement to be incorporated in such agreements.
 The "confrontation" policy of Indonesia has introduced new tensions in
 the Treaty Area,  It has, as well, introduced a premise which Indonesia itself
 would very probably not wish to see adopted universally.  This premise is that
 a nation has a right to attack another nation simply because it does not approve
 of that nation's Sc licy.

 The ideological and national rivalry of the Soviet Union and Communist
 China has shown no substantial abatement.  The abrupt and totally unexpected
 (even by Khrushchev) fall of the Russian leader in October 1964 could, at first
 glance, have been expected to lead to a healing of the breach. However,
 conflicts based on national ambitions run too deep to be solved by changes in
 personnel.
 The mutual recriminations which have split the Communist "monolith"
 might be thought of as-a source of comfort to nations threatened by Communism's
 aggressive creed. However, this split merely means that there are now two
 main sources of subversion in the world instead of one, and that these two
 sources may intensify their drives because of that competition. Their tactics
 differ but their aims remain the same.  They are agreed that Communists must
 conquer the world.  Their quarrel is primarily concerned with who should rule
 within the Communist world.
 The explosion of nuclear bombs by the Communist Chinese was significant,
 mainly because it demonstrated that in the course of time this weapon of
 tremendous destructive capabilities would be added to the arsenal of a regime
 which advocates violent tactics of conquest.  The world is not reassured either
 by the platitudes uttered by Mao Tse-tung, or by his self-contradictory
 statements.
 The scientific and industrial complex which has been necessary to build
 the nuclear bomb has also created a new area of vulnerability for the Chinese
 Communists.  The regime has now more to lose.  A recent news item reveals
 how seriously the regime takes this vulnerability:  it states that "a million
 young Chinese have been sent to the Sinkiang province to build defences around
 the Chinese nuclear installations there." It is to be hoped that the Chinese
 Communists will inform themselves fully on the inevitable effects of a nuclear
 duel.
 Responsible nations of the world have sought, through the United Nations
 and through collective defence pacts, to establish systems of peace under the
 rule of law.  Using a variety of means, attempts have been made to settle
 international disputes by peaceful means, by discussions or negotiation.  The
 record speaks for itself with regard to the present situation in South-East Asia.
 Over and over again, peace-seeking overtures have been made by neutral
 nations and by nations which are supporting the defensive actions of the
 Government of South Viet-Nam.  The United Kingdom and Canada individually,
 and the British Commonwealth collectively, have initiated moves for a peaceful
 solution. Seventeen unaligned nations joined together in proposals for this
 purpose.  The United Nations has been asked to assume a larger role in South-
 East Asia, and the member nations have been asked to use their influence to

 bring the conflict to the conference table. The United States has initiated or
 supported, on at least fifteen occasions, efforts to resolve the issues by peaceful
 negotiations. The United States has also stated that it is prepared to engage
 in negotiations or discussions with no prior conditions.
 Yet the Communist nations have spurned every overture. The Communist
 proposal for settling the Vietnamese problem is that, first, all United States
 troops shall leave before any negotiations or discussions can take place; and
 that the affairs of Viet-Nam shall be settled in accordance with the principles
 of the Communist fronts, the Fatherland Front in the North and the Liberation
 Front in the South.  No consideration is given to the South Vietnamese people
 who have shown by their long and determined struggle that they do not wish
 to fall under Communist domination.
 The SEATO Council, meeting in London in April this year, declared :
 "Every effort should be made to promote a satisfactory and lasting settlement
 of the conflict which would ensure the right of the South Vietnamese people
 to pursue their future in peace and complete freedom from external interference."
 (The French Government did not participate in preparing the communique;
 however, this statement is not contrary to France's previously stated position.)
 The SEATO Council communique of London also declared it to be
 "self-evident that, if the aggression were ended, the Governments and people
 of both South and North Viet-Nam could live in peace and devote their energies
 to economic and social progress."  Two proposals which would enrich the lives
 and hopes of the people of South-East Asia - whatever their ideological views -
 have been brought forward.  The United Nations Commission for Asia and the
 Far East (ECAFE) is organizing an Asian Development Bank which, as the
 name implies, would assist in the promotion of economic progress.  Also, President
 Johnson has proposed the establishment of a fund for a similar purpose and has
 pledged a billion dollar contribution.  These proposals are open to Communist
 and non-Communist nations alike.  Acceptance by nations from both sides would
 put the welfare of the people outside the sphere of political conflict.  The
 respective national decisions will give an indication of the course of future
 events.
 Eventually, the Communist nations must be made to realize that deprivation
 of liberty and destruction of human values cannot prevail against the rights and
 aspirations of man.  The Marxist dogma of 1848, with its various subsequent
 turnings, cannot provide satisfactory answers to 20th century problems.  Today
 we must build a world of peace based on justice, with penalties for those who
 violate these principles.

 The Role of Collective                             a ence
 The need for preservation of national sovereignty leads logically to collective
 defence. The eight signatories of the Manila Pact pledged themselves to seek
 peaceful solutions of international disputes and to act to meet the common danger
 in case of aggression by armed attack.  They also agreed to co-operate in economic
 development.
 In the interests of peace and freedom, it is the purpose of SEATO to
 provide military strength for the defence of the people and economic strength
 to serve them.
 Military Defence
 SEATO military defence activities during the year under review - as in
 previous years - included military planning, various conferences and meetings,
 and large-scale military exercises.
 The SEATO Military Advisers held their 22nd meeting in London
 from April 28 to 30, 1965.  This photograph was taken at the
 opening session of the conference, which took place at Lancaster House.

 Military Planning
 The Organization's military planning staff situated in Bangkok is continually
 engaged in preparation of defence plans for the Treaty Area.  This permanent
 planning responsibility is carried out by selected officers from the various services
 of armed forces contributed by member nations.
 The Chief of the Military Planning Office, under the direction of the
 Military Advisers, ensures that current defence plans are continually revised and
 refined to meet likely defence contingencies.
 Conferences and Meetings
 During the past year, two Military Advisers' Conferences were held: one
 in Bangkok in October 1964, and the other immediately before the SEATO
 Council Meeting in London in April 1965.  As a normal procedure, throughout
 the year Military Advisers were constantly in contact with one another and
 with their representatives in the Military Planning Office in Bangkok.

 Military Exercises
 Scheduled training exercises are held regularly to maintain the highest
 level of teamwork among member nations.  Various types of land, sea and air
 manoeuvres have provided opportunities for member nation forces to fit them
 for any fighting role they may be required to carry out in defence of the Treaty
 Area. Joint exercises, starting with relatively simple operations in 1956, have
 evolved into complex manoeuvres involving tens of thousands of men. Co-operation,
 co-ordination and general skills have greatly improved with these combined
 operations, 29 of which have now been held.
 During the training year 1964-65, two military exercises were held. The
 first was Exercise Log Train, a logistics exercise centred at Korat, north-east
 Thailand, in March 1965; and the second, Exercise Sea Horse, a maritime
 operation held in the South China Sea in May 1965.
 Exercise Log Train, the first of its type, involved 900 officers and specialists
 of SEATO's eight nations.  Its principal aim was to test the effectiveness of

 navies to escort a military convoy across the South China Sea.  The maritime
 operation began at Manila and continued for ten days before ending at Bangkok.
 During that time, realistic convoy exercises were staged in which air, submarine
 and surface attacks were made on the convoy.  Replenishment at sea also was
 practised during the 2,000 miles covered by the ships.
 Bilateral Assistance between SEATO Member Nations
 Mutual military aid programs have continued during the past year,
 enhancing considerably the combat effectiveness of member nation force.  Apart
 from the provision of equipment and training assistance, two major bilateral
 projects have been undertaken.
 At Loeng Nok Tha, near Mukdaharn in north-eastern Thailand, a
 strategic airfield is nearing completion by United Kingdom Army engineers,
 assisted by Australian and New Zealand elements.  The Prime Minister of
 Thailand, Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn, officially opened the airfield on
 June 17, 1965.

 On the north-western outskirts of Bangkok, a large base workshop is
 close to completion. This Thai-Australian project, in which various types of vehicles
 will be rebuilt, is sponsored by the Australian Government and the Thai Ministry
 of Defence under the auspices of SEATO.  Thailand has contributed about 60
 per cent of the cost in the form of buildings, accommodation and other site
 facilities, while Australia is providing machine tools, workshop equipment,
 structural steel and technical staff to supervise installation of equipment and to
 train Thai personnel, at a total cost of #A396,000.  The workshop will soon
 be capable of rebuilding 20 vehicles per week.
 To provide basic training for future technical supervisors, foremen, skilled
 workmen and instructors of the Royal Thai Army, Navy and Air Force workshops
 and schools, a SEATO Military Technical Training School was established six
 years ago by the Thai Government, with assistance in the form of staff, equipment
 and training aids from Australia.  As a second element of the Skilled Labour
 Project in Thailand, the school has since become a going concern, offering a
 three-year course to some 200 students.  The Australian instructional staff, which
 had served at the school since its establishment, completed its mission in
 January 1964.

 Defence Against Subversion
 Communist parties use many tactics of subversion.  They engage in
 widespread propaganda: radio, pamphlets, news releases, books, cultural programs.
 They create "front organizations", ostensibly innocuous, whose purpose it is to
 subvert.  They join groups of political parties in a "united front" in which
 they maintain their own strict party discipline and design. They form secret
 cells to bore from within societies.  They set up puppet "national liberation"
 movements or "patriotic fronts" which are neither national, free nor patriotic.
 These are some of the tactics of Communist subversion.   Constant
 vigilance is required to guard against these foreign-dominated activities in a
 nation.
 The primary responsibility in countering subversion rests with the nation
 itself.  However, SEATO can best serve by collecting and analyzing reports of
 Communist activities in the area.  This co-ordination is carried out through the
 Special Assistant for Counter-subversion and the Research Office at SEATO
 Headquarters, and through the regular meetings of the Intelligence Assessment
 Committee which is composed of representatives of member nations.
 In addition to this overall evaluation of the threat, SEATO also provides
 facilities for focusing attention on specific problems of member nations and for
 channelling needed assistance in training or materials.

 Economic Situation & Mutual Assistance
 Despite international disturbances which made the situation in South-East
 Asia markedly more critical during the year under review, economic progress
 among the Asian members of SEATO has been satisfactory in terms of national
 development plans and SEATO's efforts to foster closer economic co-operation
 among member countries.  All the three Asian members-Pakistan, the Philippines
 and Thailand-have registered significant advances which provide grounds for
 sustained optimism.
 Under its Second Five-Year Plan, which ended on June 30, 1.965, Pakistan
 had an average annual growth rate of approximately 6 per cent, a considerable
 advance over the 2.7 per cent annual growth rate achieved during the preceding
 decade, 1950-60.  With a growth rate of over 5 per cent during the year 1964-65,
 the overall increase in gross national product at the end of the period came
 close to 30 per cent.  This exceeds the planned target of 24 per cent by a wide
 margin.
 The industrial sector, which registered a growth rate of 15 per cent,
 contributed 12.8 per cent of the country's gross national product.  The most
 notable gains on this account were made in the fields of cotton textiles, jute
 manufactures, sugar, vegetable oil, cigarettes, fertilizers, chemicals and electrical
 goods.
 Export earnings recorded a growth rate of 40 per cent as against the
 estimated growth rate of 30 per cent in the gross national product.  As the country
 embarks on its Third Five-Year Plan, high priority is being given to further
 increases in agricultural and industrial production, as also to the narrowing of
 the gap between foreign exchange earnings and import requirements through
 the expansion of the production of exportable surpluses and the promotion of
 domestic substitutes for imports.
 The healthy performance of the Philippine economy during the year is
 indicated by the growth of production in practically all sectors.  Manufacturing
 showed a robust 10.7 per cent expansion.  Mining registered a 6.3 per cent
 increase in output while agricultural production advanced by 6 per cent, export
 crops gaining about 15 per cent in the first half of the period.   Employment
 went up in every major non-agricultural line and more than 8,000 new business
 enterprises were organized during the year.  Foreign exchange receipts from
 exports exceeded import payments by about $US29 million for a favourable
 trade balance.  Gross national product increased by 6.2 per cent over the previous
 year.
 The economy of Thailand showed an improvement over the previous year.

 Output of major agricultural, industrial and mining products increased markedly.
 Rice production, which went up to a record level of 10.17 million tons, was an
 important factor in raising the country's international reserves by about $US69.1
 inillion and in lessening the country's overall trade deficit of the previous year
 by almost 50 per cent.
 Economic co-operation and mutual assistance among SEATO countries
 continue strongly.  A SEATO group of economic experts met in Bangkok from
 February 22 to March 5, 1965, and in a wide-ranging survey recommended a
 number of specific measures for the improvement of economic relations among
 the member nations. Topics covered by the group, which was composed of 20
 experts and advisers from all eight member countries, included trade, agriculture,
 industry, communications and other economic activities.
 SEATO assistance to the Asian member countries takes many forms.
 During 1964-65, Australia, whose special SEATO aid program amounts to some
 $US2,250,000 a year, was responsible for the supply of machinery, electrical
 equipment and other services for various technical schools in Pakistan, as well
 as to the SEATO skilled labour and cholera research projects in that country.
 Passenger motor buses were given to the Philippines.  In Thailand, Australia is
 providing an adviser to assist in the establishment of the Hill Tribes Research
 and Training Centre at Chiengmai, and vehicles for the centre.  Technical
 assistance and equipment are also being provided for a radio transmitter project
 at the north-east centres of Khonkaen, Korat and Ubol.

 SEA TO Projects
 SEATO Graduate School of Engineering
 The SEATO Graduate School of Engineering in Bangkok completed its
 fifth year of operation on September 8, 1964.  Thirty-seven master's degrees
 were awarded in March 1965: 8 of the graduates were from Pakistan, 7 from
 the Philippines, 3 from Taiwan and 19 from Thailand.     To date, 111 graduates
 have received degrees from the school.
 For the academic year 1965-66, there is an enrolment of 94, of whom
 56 are first-year students, carefully selected from a great number of applicants.
 Thirty-eight students are in their second and final year of study.  Of the total
 enrolment, 18 are from Pakistan, 29 from the Philippines, 41 from Thailand,
 2 from Malaysia, 1 from Hongkong, 2 from Taiwan and 1 from South Viet-Nam.
 Applications for admission from graduates in all South-East Asian countries are
 considered.

 The school now offers majors in hydraulic, structural, transportation and
 public health engineering.  The current teaching staff is drawn from France,
 Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.
 Special lectures, seminars and conferences are sponsored by the school in
 addition to academic courses.  The school also undertakes research projects for
 governmental and private organizations and receives direct income on this
 account.
 The school has achieved a reputation for high standards in post-graduate
 engineering education and is fulfilling a great need in South-East Asia.  An
 expert study group (composed of leading academicians in engineering from the
 member countries), which met in Bangkok in December 1964, made a list of
 recommendations relating to its future.
 The school is at present supported financially on the basis of annual grants
 but efforts are being made to give the institution a permanent financial
 foundation.
 Skilled Labour Projects
 In Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand, national efforts to meet the
 increasing demands of developing industries for trained workers and skilled
 technicians are being complemented by the SEATO Skilled Labour Project.
 There are now two SEATO skilled labour training centres in Pakistan : one
 at North Nazimabad, Karachi inaugurated. on May 3, 1963, and the other at

 a total enrolment of some 900 students, provide a course lasting 18 months and
 offer training in basic skills in the machine tool, electrical and woodworking
 trades. They also have facilities for the training of teachers in technical education.
 One indication of the need for these centres is the heavy demand for enrolment.
 The project in Pakistan, sponsored by SEATO, is supported by the Governments
 of Pakistan and the United States, with assistance in the form of equipment
 and books from the United Kingdom.
 In Thailand, the SEATO Skilled Labour Project has been responsible for
 the establishment of 20 trade training schools in provincial cities and a teacher
 development centre in Bangkok.  About 2,300 students graduated from these
 schools in 1965.  There is a total enrolment of 7,444 students for the academic
 year 1965-66.  The schools offer three-year training courses in automotive and
 diesel mechanics, building construction, machine shop techniques, welding and
 sheet metal work, basic electricity, radio and telecommunications.  The Teacher

 Development Centre, which has an enrolment capacity of 280 trainees, provides
 training for teachers for the project schools and other technical training
 establishments.
 As the program in Thailand is now well established, outside financial
 support has virtually ceased.  The aid project formally phased out on June 30,
 1965, after almost seven years of work.  The United States contributed
 $US1,835,000 to the total cost of the project and the Thai Government $US900,000
 in baht from the Counterpart Fund.  The United Kingdom made contributions
 of machine tools, published text material, automotive and diesel engines and
 transport for supervisory travel, worth in all $US80,000.
 The SEATO Skilled Labour Project in the Philippines has been responsible
 for the completion of a survey of labour market information and a pilot apprentice
 training program.  Equipment has also been provided for the textile training
 department of the Marikina School of Arts and Trades which now offers a variety
 of trade courses.
 Telecommunications Project
 SEATO's interest in telecommunications dates from 1959 when it was
 decided to improve the telecommunications system for gathering and transmitting
 meteorological and aeronautical information between the Asian member countries.
 In 1961-62, the Thailand - Philippines section of the project was approved.
 Eighty-nine teachers from 20 SEATO vocational training schools in the
 provincial centres of Thailand attended a seminar at the Teacher
 Development Centre in Bangkok, in April 1965.  Shown here at a session

 All initial planning and engineering for the Thai element have been
 completed and about 98 per cent of the major equipment and supplies needed
 have been received from the United States.  The installation of transmitters and
 circuits, as also the installation of all message centre terminal equipment in a
 new communications centre, and of meteorological equipment at the Meteorological
 Department of Thailand, are nearing completion. Many technicians have completed
 further training in the United States.
 A report on the Philippines element of the project records progress in the
 installation of equipment and states that the last three of seven Filipino participants
 scheduled for training in the United States are expected to complete their courses
 in 1965.  In-service training has been started in Manila for personnel engaged
 in the installation of the equipment.
 The SEATO Meteorological Telecommunications Project is one aspect of
 the broadening interest of the Organization in the field of telecommunications.
 A SEATO Expert Study Group on Telecommunications met in Bangkok
 from June 28 to July 2, 1965, and made recommendations for improvements to
 communications among the SEATO countries.  The experts' report, which covers
 cable, troposcatter and microwave links in the region, is now under consideration
 by member countries.
 Medical Research
 Activities in medical research under SEATO sponsorship are providing
 part of the essential background to economic and social advancement in South-
 East Asia.  Three SEATO projects in this field are now well established.
 Founded in Bangkok in 1960, the SEATO Medical Research Laboratory
 has five departments: bacteriology and immunology, medical zoology, medical
 entomology, pathology and virology, and a special projects division.  As a centre
 for the study of major diseases common to countries in South-East Asia, their
 means of transmission and social background, the laboratory has made significant
 contributions to scientific knowledge.  It has been responsible for the identification
 of the virus and carrier of haemorrhagic fever and the identification of the liver
 fluke parasite and its life cycle.
 The laboratory, which receives its main support from Thailand and the
 United States, is advancing its research studies on malaria, haemorrhagic fever,
 viral hepatitis, poliomyelitis, venereal disease, encephalitis, liver, lung and blood
 flukes, rickettsial diseases, enteric infections, melioidosis, anthrax, leptospirosis and
 rabies. Aside from research activities, the laboratory provides training for medical
 graduates and hospital technicians.  Eminent medical specialists from various
 countries have visited the laboratory and have given lectures and participated in
 conferences.

 SEATO Clinical Research Centre
 To meet the need for a centre which would find ways of improving
 diagnosis and the treatment and medical management of patients and would train
 teachers in medical education and the basic medical sciences, SEATO established
 a Clinical Research Centre in Bangkok in 1963.
 The Clinical Research Centre has executive and scientific operational staffs,
 and areas of investigation are : nutritional studies - initially thiamine deficiency
 and metabolism, anaemias - studies of haemoglobin types and enzyme-deficiency,
 heart disease, malaria, and bladder stone research.  These projects create the
 framework for the research now being done, but this will probably be modified
 in form and function with project changes to include many diverse clinical
 research problems in South-East Asia.
 An excellently equipped five-storey building for the centre is scheduled
 for completion this year by the Thai Government.  The wards will accommodate
 forty patients, chosen from other hospitals in Bangkok and outlying areas.  The
 biochemistry laboratories will form the core of the centre's work and there will

 also be diagnostic procedural facilities, operating rooms, X-ray equipment and
 a radio-isotope section.  The cardiac catheterization clinic will be in the centre's
 new building.  The centre's equipment affords facilities for testing and medical
 research that, in many instances, cannot be found elsewhere in South-East Asia.
 It will offer facilities for research and training in cardiology, metabolism
 and endocrinology, renal diseases, gastro-intestinal and infectious diseases, nutrition,
 trauma, radiology, nuclear medicine and radio-isotopes, microbiology, biochemistry
 and biophysics.  it will also provide opportunities for research fellows working
 for master and doctoral degrees from their own universities to undertake field
 studies in biochemistry, bacteriology and physiology.
 Pakistan-SEATO Cholera Research Laboratory
 The gravity of cholera in the countries of South-East Asia led SEATO
 to sponsor cholera research in Bangkok in 1959.  Research activity was transferred
 in 1960 to Dacca, East Pakistan.  This is the historic seedbed of cholera and
 the most significant area in the world for the study of the cholera patient, his
 environment and the organism itself.

 The Cholera Research Laboratory has since been designated as the
 official cholera treatment centre for the Dacca area.
 Research studies during the past year have covered five general functional
 areas : studies of the patient and the disease, the pathogenesis of cholera, studies
 of the vibrio, community studies and vaccine study.  Significant findings have
 been made in each of these areas.  The efficacy of simplified ways of treatment
 is under continual test and better definition is being made of the symptoms and
 causes of a group of cases known as "non-vibrio cholera".  A means of almost
 instantaneous specific diagnosis of the majority of cholera cases has been
 developed. The study of vaccines is being carried out in a group of 23 villages
 and is currently being extended to 35 additional villages.
 The Cholera Research Laboratory is supported principally by Australia,
 Pakistan, the United Kingdom and the United States.  All member nations are
 represented on the laboratory's panel of expert consultants.

 Community Development
 The Thai-SEATO Regional Community Development Technical Assistance
 Centre at Ubol supports the Thai Government's community development program
 in the north-east in terms of technical services, research, supervision and training.
 SEATO member nations helped to establish the centre in 1962 and 1963 by
 contributing the services of experts and by providing equipment and livestock.
 The staff of the centre is composed of technicians and specialists from
 Government agencies concerned with various aspects of the program.  It is
 equiped with construction equipment and materials to assist local community
 development or "self-help" works projects.
 The centre arranges training courses for village leaders.  It provides
 information to farmers on improved methods of agriculture and livestock
 management and is engaged in the improvement of water supplies and public
 health education activities.  Through its community education program, the
 centre informs the people of the Government's work for rural development and
 helps to establish confidence and co-operation between officials and village folk.
 In July 1965, SEATO sponsored a Seminar on Community Development
 in Bangkok.  Sixteen expert participants, representing all member countries,
 took part and over 200 observers attended the seminar sessions.
 In August 1963, the Ministry of the Interior of the Thai Government
 submitted a request to SEATO for assistance in providing equipment for a Hill
 Tribes Research and Training Centre at Chiengmai in northern Thailand. The
 centre, now in operation, serves the needs of the Hill Tribes Program of the
 Ministry of the Interior by providing facilities for research and for the training
 of research workers and officials working among the tribes.
 Australia has contributed motor vehicles and the services of an anthropologist
 who is the adviser to the Ministry of the Interior on the establishment of the
 centre.
 The United Kingdom has given books for the centre's library; equipment
 has been provided by the United States.

 Cultural Program
 Through a well-established cultural program, SEATO aims at promoting
 better knowledge, understanding and friendship among member nations and,
 indeed, it is already setting an example in co-operation in this field for the
 entire region of South-East Asia.
 In addition to being a positive contribution to the material advancement
 of the Asian member countries, the cultural program aims to preserve and
 promote all that ire good and healthy in their cultural heritage and traditions.
 A Conference of Heads of Universities, held in Karachi in 1960 under
 the aegis of SEATO, resulted in the commissioning of a survey of Asian
 universities to determine the problems that stand in the way of a freer exchange
 of students. A Commission on University Equivalences met in Bangkok in 1963
 and drafted a convention, the aim of which is to facilitate a freer exchange of
 scholars.  The convention will be signed at Manila by representatives of the
 Governments of Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand on September 8, 1965,
 the eleventh anniversary of the founding of the South-East Asia Treaty
 Organization. This instrument assumes added significance as the first of its kind
 in Asia.

 Mr. K.A. Haseeb of Pakistan, SEATO post-graduate scholar at the
 University of the Philippines, with the apparatus he designed for the rapid
 coating of tablets while working for his master's degree in pharmacy. Mr.
 Haseeb's invention has aroused wide interest in the pharmaceutical industry.
 In the sphere of education, the Organization has established continuing
 projects.  It sponsors two scholarship plans.  The first of these provides grants
 for deserving undergraduates in the three Asian member countries to enable
 them to complete the final year of their first degree course.  Unlike other
 SEATO cultural awards, which are directly administered from Headquarters,
 the undergraduate scholarships are allotted by national authorities who receive
 an annual grant for this purpose.  Some 170 awards have so far been given.

 The second plan provides twelve post-graduate scholarships, distributed
 equally between Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand, and available to
 graduates for studies leading to a higher degree in a university of an Asian
 member country other than their own.  Scholars are thus provided with the
 opportunity not only to improve their academic qualifications but also to gain
 first-hand experience and insight into the people, the language and the customs
 and traditions of their host country. These scholarships cover a period of from
 one to three years depending on the requirements of particular courses of study.
 Since the inauguration of the scheme in 1960, two scholars have earned doctorates
 and 29 master's degrees.  Thirty-five scholars are currently at work.
 Fellowships are also provided for senior scholars intending to do post-
 doctoral work.  Nationals of all member countries are eligible. Eleven awards
 are available each year for research, teaching or for specialized training. Eighty-
 one fellowships have been availed of since 1958.
 SEATO also provides grants at the highest academic level.  Each year,
 at the request of the Asian Member Governments, SEATO makes available the
 services of a professor from a specified member country for a requested discipline.
 Since the inception of the professorship program in 1959, eleven professors have
 served seventeen annual terms.  SEATO professors are engaged not only in
 teaching and counselling but at times also in independent research.
