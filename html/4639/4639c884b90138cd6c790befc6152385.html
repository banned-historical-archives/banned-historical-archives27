 the Japanese population n s a result of which the 21+ members of the Central
 Committee of the Japanese Communist Party were prevented from holding public
 posts, while those members of the Party who were elected as Diet members were
 deprived of their seats.
 This act of MacArthur not only oppresses the J~pane se Communist i arty,
 but also the entire Japanese population.  Under his administration unemployment
 exists everywhere and the country is almost on the verge of economic collapse,
 as a result of which the Japanese people staged an anti-American movement.
 This  reached its climax during, tixe International Labour Day in Tokyo when
 an adviser of MncArthur delivered an anti-Communist speech.
 Altogether 600,000 people met on May 30 and. June 3 respectively to protest
 against the speech and demanded his explus ion.  Workers, students, educnt ional-

 GREAT FOOD MOVE1v1H TS i;ITHIN
 CHINA HAVING PROFOUIMTD ECONOMIC ]FECTS:
 It is already clear that the foresight and energy of the Government in
 transporting food from surplus to the deficiency areas has had profound
 effects on China's economic situation.  This clevelopmrx;nt will hove a long
 term significance, possibly greater than its immediate cffccts, which
 themselves are sufficiently important.  Food prices fell rapidly from March
 onwards and. aroe now 'stable, or with a mild downward tendency,  Famine has
 been prevented from developing.
 Under previous regimes, millions starved in parts of China while food
 rotted. in other parts.  Even while emerging from the war, the -People's
 Government gave priority to the unhenrd-off' project of spreading Chinn's
 fooclstocks evenly over the country.
 Hero is a brief. review of the handling of this enormous and complex
 work of transport.  The task included three main sect ions in which surplus
 grain had to be transported. from Manchuria (over 1,000,000 tons); from
 Szechuan (110,000 tons by mid-Augggust); and from and within Central South
 China (710,000 tons).  This grain had to be reallocated to areas, mostly
 in East Chinn, which were badly affected by floods and other such disturbances
 laot year.
 PhESaTT SITUATION (1) - GItA ThT SUPPLIES FROM NORTH OF TI-IE GREAT . ALL. The
 plan is to send 1,030,000 tons South during 1950, and more if necessary.  The
 major part has been dispatched. by rail, mainly from areas around Mukdcn and.
 Harbin, the grain being marshalled in Tientsin and Peking before being dis-
 tributed to areas requiring it.
 The volume of these supplies is inclica::cd by the number of railway
 waggons used. on the Manchurian part of the work from January onwards, as
 follows:- Jnuary, 7,1+71 cars; February, 7,323 cars; March, 5,638 cars;;
 April, 1,631 cars; first 20 clays of May, 1,901 car s.  Total for the five
 months - 23,964 waggons averaging 30 tons each.  Grain transported 718,920 tons.
 The timing of the greatest volume indicates how far rk. Disorder and confusion must be avoided.

 In the meantime the U.S.  is waging n planned, hostile campnign ngninst
 the Chinese People's Republic.  Herbert Hoover, ex-U.S. President, roadie n
 hostile nttnck. against recognition of the Chinese People's itepublic only

 they t ore opposed. to recognition of the Chinese Peo lo 's Republic and its

 However, the imperialists al?e powerless in their spite.  They cannot
 change the historic events that have occurred,  The recently published book
 "Peace or        by war-maker John Foster Dulles, now chief adviser to the
 State Department, urges that American policy in China be compensated for by
 pushing expansion in other countries of Asia.  And events ro to show that
 ruling circles in the U.S. are taking this course.
 Japan Key to "Small Mar shall Plan?
 It is no secret that the U.S. ruling circles are using the occupation
 of Japan so as to turn it into their military strategic springbonrd in the
 Fear East.  Eloquent proof of this is the rehabilitation of Japanese military
 bases, now taken over by the American occupation authorities.  The imperialists
 of the U.S. want to use Japan as an instrument for carrying out their Impe-
 rialist policy in L sin.
 With the loss of Chinn, wrote U.S. Nevis and World Report,  Japan is

 Army horses galloped up tau track they evidently kno r well.  And the strangest

 M]NUTE BUDGET DEFICIT IN APRIL:
 The def is it in the N at ionnl Bucl.get in April was relatively minute and
 no currency has been i; sued for the purpose of defraying national o q:)en-
 diture since March.  Figures issued by the Ministry of Finance indicate
 that the tendency trnvard achieving, a balance between income and expendi-
 ture is steady.
 In March, the Budget deficit was only one-fifth of January's dofio .t,
 incl. in April it fell to negligible proportions.  This accounts for the
 general price stability throughout the .country since March, and is a result
 of centralised control over the national income and exigcnd.iture-by-the
 Central People'?s Government.
 National revenue has been increasing, since March,  Profits derived
 from :publicly-owne ci enterprises :covered 16.7jo of the April expenditure,
 while in February these profits were negligibly small.   There has been a
 steady rise in tax receipts since the beginning of the year.
 Local government expenditure his been greatly reduced, and most areas
 are delivering surpluses to the Central People's Government instead of
 acting for subsidies.              NC\TA Peking Morse English 2130--hrs 31 May)

 of the bank was VJbJ-LD 1.  500,000,0000000.
 The Bank's activity in calling back currency has helped to bring
 about price stability, and these large deposits have enabled the Bank to

 Children's welfare and education receive close attention in now China,
 says Peking Rnd.io's commentary.      11rt icle 5, Item N o.78 of the Chine se
 People's Political Consultative Conference lays clown the rules for the
 Protect ion of children's healthy while the now marriage laws on the pro-
 teotion of children's interests become one of the fundamentals of the legis-
 lation.                      Under all thecae children's welfare work achieves rapid prox-,-,toss.
 .According to statistics up to the end of May 1950, there are 541
 children's welfare organisations in 27 important cities of China where about
 35,000 children receive  benefit and proper care.  11t the time of the lib-
 oration of Peking, there were only nine children's welfare centres, but now
 there are 54 such centres.  The increase in the, number of children's welfare
 centres indicates that after the liberation many mothers have taken part in
 the 1n oduct ion drive.
 For the benefit of the children's educ.at ion, there are at present
 300,000.-odd  primar?y schools with 20,000,000-ocld students attending them.
 The number of children attending schools has greatly increased since the
 liberation, especially those from the poor working famil-jae,  Of the so stu-
 dents, 81.5are from poor families.  The number of children's youth organ-
 isations has also greatly increased.  2iecording to inoonp1ete reports,
 there are about 4707000 children participating in .these organist ions.
 The above-cited facts prove that children's welfare and education in
 new'China are progressing'?6picily.  Unlike the old feudal regime, most of
 the children of the la:.ouring and farming families are now receiving an
 e ducat ion.
 Under the bare of the children's welfare centres, primary schools and
 the children's youth organisations, now China is producing a :crest number of
 physically cleveloped.:.and morally healthy children.  Credit must go to the
 Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government whose guidance and sup-
 port have made this possible.
 On the occasion of this International Children's Day, we must express
 our respect towards all the child welfare workers.     We also hope that child
 welfare workers will clearly understand that the children arc the future
 masters of the State, and'therefore their duties cinji work are of the utmost
 importance, especially at this period when the KNIT reactionaries have left
 behind them thousands of uneducated children who need, careful guidance and a
 sound egiucat ion,                    (Peking Radio Voice Kuo-yu 20115 hr s 31 May)
 MORE DE\. ELOPIv TT U1tGI;D :
 "Develop children's work further" is the title of an editorial in today's
 Peking People's Daily devoted two International Childrent  Day which takes
 pl. Ace . tomorrow.
 The editorial said that welfare and educational work for children had maw
 rapid advances both in quantity and quality in new China under the guiding
 principles of China's Common Programme of the People's Political Consultative
 Conference.
 (Tile  paper then setsV out all the statist ics nlrendy, quoted above in
 Peking Radio's commentary.' - Editor.)
 Judging by these. facts, the editorial said, 'a sweeping change has taken
 place in child eclucnt ion .and. welfare work, which is nuvv serving children of the
 broad masses if workint people instead of simply catering for a small number of
 children of the Chinese privileged classes.  The nurseries, kinder,artens, pri-
 mary                     schools and Young Pioneers arc turnincc out large numbers of physically and
 mentally well-dbvel':opped children.
 The editorial nttributes this great achieve'ment~.to the personnel and cadres
 engaged in children's work, and ends by calling on these cadres to study Marxism,
 Leninism and the now dernoer.atie education methods, nncl to serve the children of
 China wholeheartedly.              (N{d>T11 Peking Morse-English 2130--1-lrs 31 May)

 This aummona has f ouncl .a YvSr i piponjo amoncr_ all democratically minded
 people.  In France, i;uma ta, great tritain, Germany,  u;~tria, and  ther countries,
 national committees have been set up to prepare for tau observance of Inter-
 national Ctxil:?ren's Day.  June I will be widely marked as a dan in defence of
 the younger generation.
 For million of children in the capitalist countric.Y .anc _col:o:nias,_ life is
 .a Hard struggle with no pro. pucts for the future.  Here are several facts which
 mankind cannot tolerate.
 Tip Italy, out  f user;- 1,000 children, 36 cite. In India 2,500,000 children
 under five years of ago die annually.  Moreover, 1,000,000 of these starve to
 death.   In French Equatorial Africa, 100 out of every 1,000 eti..liren. die. before
 they reacts the are of five.  In Centro  and South AmurIca, Africa and India;
 children of five to seven yeari are fo ced to work, and such child labour Is
 very widespread.  In Japan, chi iciren a. still bought and sold.  It ,has .been
 estimated ttiat of too 500 million children living in the colonies, 4.80,million
 have no opportunity  to go to school.
 In the US, where the ruling. circles boast of the.Country's wealth, 3,000,000
 boys and girls, inatWa,d of studyinC, work in factories, mi la, mines and on the
 cotton plantations, putting in the gamy hours as the adults, but receiving lower
 This speaks far more eloquently of the American way of life than the
 `Voice of America'.; much-quotud figures of the number of refrigerators in the
 riornus of wealthy ,'americans.
 hater ?='reaident Truman bey say about his great efforts to improve the
 ayotem of education, the fact remains that 6,000,000 children in the US do not
 g  to school.   :bile spending more OAK! of, the-national- budget on Tar purposes,
 the American Government .saai_.ns the most negligible sums to education.
 "Tillios>s of children of working people in the capitalist countries and
 colonies are doomed to a AN of semi-starvation.  They lniovt none of the joys of
 childhood.  They have no opportunity to secure an education or learn a trade.
 In.preparation for International children's Day, democratic organisations
 are raising demands that will improve the position of the younger generation.
 They call for an increase in afor ?oriationa for measures to safeguard the health
 and lives of children, for labour protection for juveniles, the abolition of
 child lab our, and a guaranteed living vtale for parents, since small children
 have to       to  ,7ork because there is not enough money to support them, more money
 to build achols, and placing education within the reach of the children of
 working people.
 The solution of these extremely important problems is imperative for milli -.,na
 of working people in the capitalist countries.  But the most important and most
 urgent for the defence of the younger generation is the' demand for a lastis
 peace.  Preparations for war deprive millions of boa and girls of a nappy chuld-
 h od.                  The atom bomb threatens millions cf young lives.
 That  is why the fight for peace cannot be separated from the efforts to
 protect the younger generation.  A fighti for ttxe life and future of our children
 means a fight for a lacing peace.  That is why the Bureau of the International
 C:)rnmittee preaarinE for the observance, of Internat _onal Ch3,ldren's nay on June I
 calles upon working people to mark the 4ay uincior the slogan of     must save our
 children. "
 Preparations for ..gar are increasing, and the at:om b msb threatens trio peace-
 ful existence of the people, says the message.  Under such conditions, all our
 efforts to secure an improvement in the position of the children would prove
 fruitless if our primary goal were not to ensure peace th,-ou`hout the world,
 because a child's first rj ht is the right to live.  The International Committee
 urges all people who wish 'to Nave the children, whatever their political vies
 or religious beliefs,  to sign and collect signatures for too great a?peal which
 calla for prohibition of tore atom bomb on an international scale, ao as to deliver
 hundreds of millions of children from the terrible danger that threatens them.
 In all countries tti  people are pry oaring to mark June 1 as a day of WE=
 of tau right of the younger genorat7 on to life, health and a democratic upbring-
 and education.  in that day they will reaffirm their resolve to fight for
 peace against the menace of a now war, which the Anglo-American imperialists are
 scheming.                             (Mosco r facii" Voice English 2015-his 29 May)
