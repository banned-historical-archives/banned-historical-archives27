 USSR:- Politburo Shifts and Changes
 Soviet President Brezhnev 's political strength
 has increased as the result of the significant shifts in
 the leadership the Central Committee plenum made yester-
 day, The pZenum's action tipped the balance zoithin the
 poZicymalcing Politburo toward the Secretariat and away
 from Premier Kosygin's government apparatus. Brezhnev 's
 interests were also served as the plenum named a junior
 provincial leader to the Secretariat to replace deceased
 agricultural overseer Fedor KuZakov--a move that finesses
 the issue of identifying a Zong-term successor to Brezhnev.
 In the most important change, Brezhnev's close
 associa e, party secretary Konstantin Chernenko, takes a
 seat on the Politburo in place of First Deputy Premier
 Mazurov, a long-time Breznhev critic who was relieved re-
 portedly at his own request "for reasons of health."
 Mazurov's departure means that Kosygin alone represents
 the Council of Ministers in Politburo deliberations.
 Kosygin's other first deputy, Nikolay Tikhonov, became
 a candidate member of the Politburo. Tikhonov is a sup-
 porter of Brezhnev, and his appointment strengthens our
 view that Mazurov was a victim of a power play by Brezh-
 nev.
 Chernenko's promotion means that he joins Brezh-
 nev,  i  ail Suslov, and Andrey Kirilenko as the only
 party secretaries who are also Politburo members. The
 youngest of this quartet at 67; Chernenko has risen
 rapidly in the party hierarchy in the past two years
 with Brezhnev's obvious backing.
 Because Chernenko lacks an independent power
 ,
 base, he seems an unlikely successor to Brezhnev. He is,
 however, now in a position to be a key arbiter in any
 future deliberations on the succession and a strong voice
 representing Brezhnev's interests as the Soviet leader's
 vigor declines.
 Chernenko became a member of the Secretariat
 in April 1976 and a candidate member of the Politburo in
 October 1977. die previously worked as a party adminis-
 trator--a kind of executive officer for Brezhnev and the
 Politburo--but he has become increasingly involved in

 foreign affairs in recent years. Brezhnev appears to have
 tried to give him broader exposure to foreign policy is-
 sues in an effort to improve his credentials in the party
 leadership.
 In another significant personnel appointment,
 the plenum appointed Stavropol premier party leader
 Mikhail Gorbachev to the Secretariat to replace deceased
 senior secretary Kulakov as the party's overseer of agri-
 culture. By opting not to attach Politburo status to
 this position, Brezhnev and his colleagues have indicated
 that they will continue to temporize on the succession
 issue.
 The plenum also promoted Georgian party leader
 Eduard Shevardnadze to Politburo candidate membership.
 Shevardnadze's allegiances are not clear--in past years
 he reportedly was allied with Brezhnev's rival Shelepin
 and may in fact be as beholden to Suslov as to Brezhnev
 for his promotion. The promotion may be a reward for
 having dealt forcefully with corruption in his republic,
 and for his sensitivity in handling the recent flare-ups
 of Georgian nationalism.
 The Supreme Soviet (the Soviet legislature) is
 scheduled to convene tomorrow and may make some changes
 in the government hierarchy--Mazurov is likely to be
 dropped, for example, as First Deputy Premier. The Su-
 preme Soviet's main business, however, is to discuss and
 approve next year's economic plan and budget.
 In his speech to the Central Committee plenum,
 Brez nev   ocused on some of the major shortcomings of
 the economy--highlighting the poor performance in capital
 formation over the past three years and noting that the
 distribution of next year's investment would emphasize
 energy, metallurgy, and transportation. Throughout his
 speech, Brezhnev put the blame for most of the economy's
 problems squarely on the shoulders of planning and man-
 agement, althou h he  roffered no new methods for dealin
 with them.

 JAPAN: LDP Primary Election
 Masayoshi Ohira's victory in the Liberal Demo-
 cratic Party primary on Sunday makes his selection as
 Japan's next prime minister virtually automatic but is
 not ZikeZy to Zead to any major shifts in government
 policy or to any abrupt realignments in the ruling party,
 Ohira has Zong been considered Prime Minister Fukuda 's
 heir, and his victory does not convey any popular repud-
 iation. of Fukuda 's policies.
 Ohira's primary victory--42 percent of the
 vote to 36 percent for Fukuda--hinged largely on the
 vigorous support he received from the faction of his
 primary political ally, former Prime Minister Tanaka.
 Fukuda withdrew his candidacy yesterday after the pri-
 mary results became clear and thus set the stage for
 Ohira's election by acclamation on Friday and his selec-
 tion as prime minister within the following week or so.
 Fukuda's decision to step aside will help
 underwrite both party unity and a smooth transition of
 power, It also insures that Fukuda's faction will be
 well represented in Ohira's cabinet. Indeed, the Ohira,
 Tanaka, and Fukuda factions are likely to dominate the
 new government, much as they have during Fukuda's two-
 year tenure,
 Ohira's political record and the .likely fac-
 tional balance of his cabinet suggests he will not under-
 take any major departures in foreign policy. The politi-
 cal, economic, and security relationships with the US
 will certainly remain the cornerstone of Japanese policy.
 Ohira has strongly boosted the US-Japanese Mutual Secur-
 ity treaty as a vital element of Japan's defense policy,
 but he has been more reluctant than other Liberal Demo-
 cratic Party leaders to advocate a larger role for Ja-
 pan's own Self Defense Forces.
 Ohira was instrumental in normalizing Sino-
 Japanese relations in 1972, is well regarded in Peking,
 and will undoubtedly maintain the current momentum in
 relations with China. As for the USSR, Ohira recently re-
 marked that he has no major initiatives in mind. Depend-
 ing on Soviet behavior, however, some expansion of Soviet-
 Japanese economic relations may occur.

 //Like Fukuda, Ohira is a former bureaucrat
 from the Ministry of Finance, but he has been more lib-
 eral than Fukuda in his economic views. Ohira reportedly
 puts a high priority on solving Japan's trade problems
 with the US, although he has not mentioned any specific
 plans on dealing with this issue. Japan`s bilateral
 trade surplus soared to a record $10.4 billion in the
 first 10 months of this year.//
 //Should upward pressure on the yen resume,
 Ohira is more likely than Fukuda to make an all-out ef-
 fort to prevent further appreciation in order to preserve
 .7apan's share in foreign markets. Ohira will certainly
 honor all agreements made by the Fukuda government on
 the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. Ohira will probably
 try to honor Fukuda's commitment to spur domestic growth.
 I3e may formulate another supplemental budget for the re-
 mainder of the fiscal year that ends in March.//
 //While Ohira may want to do more for do-
 mestic growth, he will find it difficult to push much
 beyond Fukuda's efforts. Fukuda reportedly planned new
 reflationary  measures for the remainder of this fiscal
 year and another large boost in government spending next
 year. He hinted the new measures could push deficit fi-
 nancing to 40 percent of next year's budget--a level
 that Ohira will probably not be able to exceed.//

 CHINA: Peking Party Meetings
 Chinese Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping yesterday
 denied rumors that he wiZZ soon repZaee Hua Kuo-feng as
 Chinas Premier. He also confirmed reports that a high-
 ZeveZ party meeting is under may in Peking but d2d not
 specify what kind of meeting it is.
 In an interview
 Teng sai   he had turned down an o  er  o  ecome  remier
 last year and had no intention of undertaking that post's
 heavy responsibilities now. He also tried to quell spec-
 ulation that he and Hua were at odds by saying "Chairman
 Hua and I have always been in complete agreement on
 everything."
 Yesterday, in a domestic radio account of
 Teng s meeting with a Japanese delegation on Sunday,
 Teng appeared to modify his support for the wall poster
 activity. While noting the constitutional guarantees for
 poster writers, Teng said he found some of the comments
 and opinions contained in them to be incorrect and "not
 conducive to stability and unity."
 Peking has made no announcement as yet on the
 nature of the party meeting, and it is probably still in
 session. Hua will reportedly deliver an "important po-
 litical report" to the meeting. Party leaders may have
 extended the meeting because of disagreements within the
 Politburo over matters such as those raised in the recent
 wall posters.

 //The Turkish Government has reportedly
 decided to ban the principal rightist group involved in
 the current wave of domestic violence--the Nationalist
 Action  Party's  youth  wing  knoz~n  as  the  "IdeaZ2;st  Hearths. "
 This action, if upheld by the courts, will trigger a
 vehement--and possibly violent--reaction from the politi-
 cal right.//
 Under Turkish law, the courts must approve the
 outlawing of any organization, and the judiciary has over-
 turned several past attempts by Prime Minister Ecevit to
 proscribe political groups. Rightists are known to be
 responsible for a significant proportion of the 600 po-
 litical killings in Turkey this year. Ecevit may there-
 fore believe the courts will have no alternative but to
 go along this time, particularly if he submits evidence
 linking the "Idealists" to specific incidents. Leftist
 groups have also been involved in some of the violence,
 and the Prime Minister may find it difficult not to ban
 one or more of those as well. According to a member of
 his party, however, Ecevit has no plans to do so.
 //Ecevit recently accused Nationalist Ac-
 tion Party lea er Turkes of condoning and supporting
 rightist violence. Turkes responded heatedly by accusing
 Ecevit of having belonged to a Communist organization.
 A ban on the "Idealists," following closely on this ex-
 change, would evoke an immediate response from Turkes and
 would further exacerbate the volatile Turkish political
 scene.//
 //Rightist extremists might also increase
 their activities and could shift their attacks from left-
 ist groups to government officials. If violence does in-
 crease, businessmen and members of the political elite
 would further press the government to impose martial law,
 a move that Ecevit and the military have long sought to
 avoid . //

 ARGENTINA-CHILE: Weapons Suppliers
 //Argentine military leaders purchased a

 are already being delivered, and efforts are under way
 to acquire 60 Panhard armored cars, which are particu-

 //Israel has sold at least 24 Mirage air-
 craft to Argentina and intends to provide artillery
 rockets. The Argentines are also reportedly trying to
 buy large numbers of tanks in Spain and possibly other
 West European countries. The Austrian Defense A'linistry
 has confirmed the transfer of 17 Panzerjager-K self-
 propelled antitank guns, which are basically a recon-
 figuration of the French AMX-13 tank that Argentina has
 had since 1968. Delivery is expected in early December.//
 //Argentina has bought from Italy at least
 nine light attack helicopters, which are expected to be
 delivered before the end of the year. It also recently
 purchased 10,000 rounds of 105-mm artillery ammunition
 from Italy and is negotiating for more.//

 guns, explosives, and other military hardware left Spain
 for Buenos Aires in October, and the Argentine Air Force
 reportedly has been negotiating in Madrid for conven-

 //Ecuador's Supreme Electoral Tribunal--
 after a recount and review of balloting procedures in

 that front-runner Jaime Roldos will face center-right
 candidate Sixto Duran-Ballen in the second round of the
 presidential election in early April.//
 //The new tribunal was named last month
 following an attempt by its predecessor to provide
 trumped-up evidence of massive vote fraud to justify
 cancellation of the election. Although some plotting
 against populist Roldos probably will continue, a ma-

 seeing the election process through to its conclusion.//

 has resumed giving selected dissidents tourist, rather
 than emigration, visas, thus implying that they will be
 allowed to return.
 The leadership is probably confident that those
 it gives tourist papers will not publicly attack the re-

 they will not return.
 Intimidation and imprisonment are still used

 early last month, remains in jail. The son of Jiri Hajek--

 Dubcek--is being penalized for his father's current dis-

 versity. Finally, three persons charged with distributing
 "nonconformist music" and literature were recently given
 jail sentences.

 FEATURE ARTICLE
 TUNISIA: Nouira's Visit to US
 Tunisian Prime Minister Hedi Nouira, the eon-
 stitutionaZ successor to ailing President Bourguiba, will
 seek assurances of continued US economic and military aid
 during his official visit to Washington tomorrow-and
 Thursday. Nouira will no doubt stress the importance
 Tunisia attaches to US political support as a deterrent
 to Libyan or other outside interference in Tunisian af-
 fairs.
 The 67-year-old Prime Minister is a sound eco-
 nomic manager and a proponent of Tunisia's moderate, pro-
 Western foreign policies. He heads a group of conserva-
 tive Bourguiba loyalists that is firmly in control of the
 government. Nouira and his cabinet run day-to-day affairs;
 Bourguiba--now in Western Europe for medical treatment--
 provides only occassional policy guidance.
 Tunisia has used its limited influence in re-
 ional affairs to encourage dialogue and compromise. In
 1965, Bourguiba jarred the Arab world by asserting pub-
 licly that Israel is an internationally recognized real-
 ity with which the Arabs should negotiate.
 oday, Tunisia is sympathetic to Egyptian Pres-
 ident Sadat's peace initiatives but is unwilling to anger
 its radical neighbors, Algeria and Libya, by publicly
 supporting the Camp David accords.
 Tunisia's principal foreign policy concern is
 the chronically tense state of relations-with Libya,- which
 has made no secret of its desire to influence political
 developments in Tunisia. Libyan President Qadhafi was
 humiliated by Tunisia's refusal to implement a merger
 agreement in 1974 and blames Nouira for scuttling it. A
 dispute with Libya over oil rights on the continental
 shelf remains unresolved.

 The discovery in September of a Libyan-supplied
 ~.rms cache in southern Tunisia has heightened Tunisian
 concern that Libya may be increasing its covert activity
 to undermine the Nouira government.
 The domestic scene has been generally calm
 since  anuary when Nouira used the Army to suppress wide-
 spread rioting that accompanied the country's first gen-
 eral strike. The subsequent trials of former labor leader
 I3abib Achour and other union officials mark a low point
 Lor the restive national labor movement in its two-year-
 old political contest with the Tunisian political estab-
 lishment. The confrontation with labor was but one as-
 pect of the competition to determine who will run Tunisia
 iahen 75-year-old Bourguiba leaves the scene.
 //Although Nouira lacks a broad-based polit-
 ical following, he will have a considerable advantage
 ever other contenders for power because of his control
 of the government and party apparatus. The military,
 whose support will become increasingly important in the
 post-Bourguiba era, is likely to remain loyal to Nouira
 or to any other legitimately constituted government.//
 The Nouira government does not appear to face
 any significant organized opposition, but it will continue
 under pressure from labor and other groups. If the domes-
 tic scene remains calm, Nouira is likely eventually to
 seek a compromise with moderates critical of the present
 one-party political system, but he will carefully control
 any liberalization.
 Political and economic discontent has been sup-
 pressed but not eliminated. A sharp deterioration of the
 economy could result in more strikes and disorders.
 With little more than 6 million people and few
 natural resources, Tunisia has achieved impressive eco-
 nomic growth--the rate of growth averaged about 6.5 per-
 cent over the past five years. The primary goal of Tu-
 nisia's fifth development plan is to create more jobs.
 .About half of new .investments are earmarked for develop-
 ment of labor-intensive, export-oriented sectors.
 Tunisia's current account deficit has grown
 steadily since 1975 and is likely to reach a record level
 this year. The growing balance-of-payments deficit is
 being financed by increased foreign borrowings.
