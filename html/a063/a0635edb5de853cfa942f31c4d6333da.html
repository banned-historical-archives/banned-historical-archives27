 MEMORANDUM: Sino-Soviet Relations
 14 January 1963
 1.  Attached is a CIA memorandum dealing with the
 status and implications of the Sino-Soviet dispute.  The
 paper points out that the ideological conflict between the
 two Communist parties and the divergence of the national
 policies of the two governments are already so funda-
 mental that, for most practical purposes, a "split" has
 already occurred,  From the viewpoint of most of the
 rest of the world, the USSR and China are now two
 separate powers whose interests conflict on almost every
 major issue.
 2? A formal and definitive break between Moscow and
 Peiping would obviously have many important advantages
 for the West.  However, the emergence of a separate
 Asian Communist Bloc under the leadership of China
 could have grave implications for U.S. security interests
 in the Far East because of Peiping's militant and intense
 anti-Western line.

 OCI No. 0581/63
 14 January 1963
 MEMORANDUM:   Sino-Soviet Relations at a New Crisis
 1.   The conjunction of the Cuban crisis, the
 Sino-Indian border war, and Tito's visit to the
 USSR have led to a rapid intensification of the
 Sino-Soviet struggle.   The mutual denunciations
 have taken the two parties a long step toward pub-
 lic and explicit accusations of heresy which would
 mark the end of any pretense at unity.   They-are
 nearer to such a rupture than at any time, and avoid-
 ing the definitive step of open condemnation is in-
 creasingly difficult.  With or without this step,
 however, we believe that the entire relationship
 is bound to deteriorate further, and only the pace
 of this process is in question.
 2.   The dispute seems to be gaining a momentum
 of its own.   Each new clash of polemics is sharper
 and more extensive than the last.  Both sides feel
 compelled to attack and defend with increasing vigor.
 The Chinese had begun to unfold a new ideological
 attack on Soviet policy even before the Cuban and
 Sino-Indian crisis, but these latter developments
 led Peiping to carry the argument beyond previous
 levels; the Cuban affair opened up a great Soviet
 vulnerability, while the Sino-Indian conflict found
 the USSR "neutral," a position which, among Commu-
 nists, is hardly distinguishable from hostility.
 Peiping wrapped up its indictment in two fundamental
 critiques, published on 15 and 31 December, designed
 to leave the impression that the Soviets had sold
 out the international revolution.   Meanwhile, the
 Soviets have themselves gone over to the offensive
 in speeches by Khrushchev and by his spokesmen at
 a series of party congresses in Eastern Europe.  The
 latest and most thorough Soviet counter attack ap-
 peared in Pravda on 7 January.

 3.   In the current exchange, the basic doctrinal
 arguments have not changed.*      What is new is the open-
 ness with which each side treats the possibility of a
 formal rupture.  Both refer frequently to "splitting"
 activities and the "organizational" consequences of a
 trend toward "fragmentation."     A highly significant
 article by Gromyko on 4 December used an historical
 analogy from the 1920's to warn against naive illusions
 that such a break could not take place; the dispute,
 he implied,  "continues, develops and goes further."
 Pravda's long editorial of 7 January warned that "di-
 visive activities" could not be tolerated because they
 would lead to a "minority trend" in the movement and
 "then to the emergence of the danger of a split...."
 For their part, the Chinese warned that if the Soviets
 continued their activities in condemning China they
 would be moving "further and further along the road to-
 ward a split."  They even went beyond this to cite
 Lenin's precedent when he broke with the majority of the
 international movement in order to preserve the purity
 of the ideology.   Thus both parties are maneuvering to
 place the onus for a split on the other, and to prepare
 the best possible record against this day.
 4.  The ideological conflict between the two Com-
 munist parties and the divergence of national policies
 between the two governments are already so fundamental
 that for most practical purposes a "split" has already
 occurred.   From the viewpoint of most of the rest of
 the world, the USSR and China are now two separate
 powers whose interests conflict on almost every major
 issue.  The issues in conflict are not merely tactical:
 the Soviets and Chinese can no loner a_gree on a common
 line of political guidance for the international move-
 me  , nor concert a common policy against the non-Com-
 munist world.
 Some Implications
 5.  Whatever happens next, it is likely that the
 two other Communist states in Asia, North Korea and

 and Soviet views on key issues is set forth in attach-

 Approved For Release 2005/'NI4DP79T00429A000300020013-1
 North Vietnam, will be key areas for new moves by
 both sides.  The position of these states is of
 the greatest importance, for the adherence of North
 Korea and perhaps North Vietnam to the Chinese camp
 would mean more than the defection or expulsion of
 one or two more separate parties judged heretical
 by the USSR. It would mean the splitting of the Com-
 munist structure on territorial lines with the Chi-
 nese heading a rival Bloc in a commanding position
 in the Far East and Southeast Asia.
 6.   Soviet tolerance of North Korea's support
 for thin    ,seems              ng.  Although there have
 been continued military deliveries to Korea, includ-
 ing newer types of equipment, it is likely that the
 Soviets have begun to use Korean military require-
 ments as a lever for political concessions.  A North
 Korean military delegation went to Moscow on 29 No-
 vember but departed abruptly and apparently without
 any new commitments.  Almost immediately thereafter,
 the North Koreans hardened their support for China
 at the Czech Party Congress and were openly censured
 for it.   Subsequently the North Korean party issued
 a defiant Central Committee statement stressing the
 importance of strengthening their military position,
 on the basis of "self-reliance."
 7. The North Vietnamese are being assiduousi
 cultivated byboth sides.   The Soviets have recently
 been investing considerable time and energy in culti-
 vating General Giap, on whom they may count for sup-
 port in Hanoi.   Giap's stay in the USSR this summer
 has been followed by a visit to Hanoi of General
 Batov, the Deputy Chief of the Warsaw Pact.   This
 has been followed by the departure for Hanoi of the
 Soviet official charged with Bloc Communist party re-
 lations.   The Chinese have greatly increased their
 verbal support for the liberation movement in South
 Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh, who is probably personally
 sympathetic to the S v_iet Union. has managed to main-
 tain a neutral stand, but this Is likely to become
 an increasingly complex position for the North Viet-
 namese leaders.   The danger for the West in this sit-
 uation is that Moscow may feel it necessary to com-
 pete with China by offering more support to the opera-
 tions in South Vietnam.

 8.   The worsening of the dispute is apparently
 becoming a factor in the Cuban situation.  One Cu-
 ban paper, usually identified with Fidel, published
 the complete text of the highly provocative Chinese
 editorial of 15 December, while another Cuban paper
 of lesser importance published the text of the 7
 January Pravda reply.  Castro took note of the "dis-
 crepancies"in the Bloc in his public statement of
 2 January and urged a new try at unity.  At this
 stage in the dispute, such acts of apparent neutra-
 1ity_are  in Soviet eyes, tantamount  o ges lures of
 support for the C'inse
 It is likely that Cas-
 ro's stand in Sino-Soviet ma ters will add to cur-
 rent frictions with Moscow, but neither the Soviets
 nor. t   ~    ap .cap , afford to abandon ,thee r, pu  ic
 om  tmentssoof solidarity.
 9.   The preoccupation of Moscow with the dis-
 pute is evident, and the sharp turn for the worse
 in the past weeks probably has reinforced Khrushchev's
 preference for a quiet period in East-West relations
 in the wake of the Cuban setback.   Numerous Soviet
 spokesmen have privately  implied that no movement on
 East-West questions could take place while Bloc af-
 fairs were in their present tense state.   Gromyko in
 his article of 4 December, went somewhat further and
 hinted that when a break with China might be develop-
 ing, it was prudent to consolidate relations with
 the West, or at least to cease "attacks" on the West.
 10.   Recriminations are likely to continue and
 may even reach a new level at the East German party
 congress (15-19 January.)   Khrushchev will lead the
 Soviet delegation, and he is backed by key Soviet
 officials who deal with the intricacies of Sino-So-
 viet polemics.   Khrushchev is likely to follow the
 hard line of Pravda on 7 January.   The presence of
 the Yugoslavs in an important Communist party gather-
 ing for the first time since 1948 is bound to provide
 ample provocation to the Chinese who have consistently
 and bitterly attacked Tito and Soviet rapprochement
 with him.  At a  minimum, the Chinese will reply in

 kind to whatever denunciations they recCeve from
 Ulbricht and Khrushchev.   In the present tense sit-
 uation this could mean the long-awaited public con-
 demnations.
 11.  At bottom, and in the long run, it prob-
 ably is not crucial whether the Soviets and Chi-
 nese explicitly part company or formally remain
 partners.   Their diverging interests and concep-
 tions are basic and will persist in either case.
 Rival proselytizing will go on, either within the
 existing international movement or between two com-
 peting movements.   The two powers will in their for-
 eign policies pursue their own national interests,
 clashing or cooperating as these may dictate. I_.T_
 nor aurall laws 2.Lpolitics, in other words, will con-
 tinue to prevail over the myths ae'-n`ons "of
 Marxism-Leninism.
 12.  But these myths and definitions are not
 wi jk4 ut their sbi nificance, fvr ,they still, have a
 st ron  h4ldon the minds of Communists.  All con-
 cerned regard it as a fateful move to take the step
 of public denunciation which has historically been
 the decisive move in quarrels of this magnitude.
 The tortured effort to condemn by implication indi-
 cates that, for Communists everywhere, this would
 be an important ritual act.   Even though the conse-
 quences of a rupture are working themselves out in
 practice anyway, the formal admission of :rupture
 would dramatize and sharply intensify these strains.
 Inside various parties, fragile compronises'which
 might withstand a more gradual disintegration at
 the core of the movement could be wrecked in the
 factional forces loosed by an acknowledged split.
 13.   In addition to the organizational conse-
 quences, there will be important political and
 pyschological ramifications for Communists as well
 as non-Communists.   The failure to maintain even
 a minimal unity would be a tremendous blow to the
 self-confidence of Communists and to their belief
 in the efficacy and infallibility of their doctrine.
 It would suggest that both China and Russia placed
 their national interests above the international
 movement.   The existence of two rival centers of

 power would probably be reflected throughout the
 movement.   New parties would appear.   Some parties
 would be opportunist and bargain away their allegi-
 ance.   Other parties would move toward an independ-
 ent position.   Initially the Soviets would retain
 a vast numerical superiority, but over the long
 run the Chinese may gain strength in undeveloped
 areas, and particularly in Asia.   Some parties would
 be paralyzed by internal dissensions, and gradually
 lose public political support and appeal,.  Many of
 these consequences are occuring throughout the move-
 ment already, but the formal proclamations of dis-
 unity would serve to aggravate these tensions and
 accelerate the trend toward diversity and polycentrism.
 14.   Throughout the dispute, a decline in Sino-
 Soviet state relations has paralleled the worsening
 of ideological argument.  Diplomatic contacts have
 steadily been constricted, economic relations have
 been substantially reduced and the Chinese have had
 to forfeit most Soviet assistance for their military
 programs.   This trend is likely to,'bonti:nue as part
 of the larger political deterioration, although dip-
 lomatic relations would probably be maintained even
 in the face of a collapse of formal unity.   The pub-
 lic military alliance between the two countries
 Y              _Qpen1y?repudiated, but this
 is not really a key question.  Already, neither side
 can consider treaty obligations as an important ele-
 ment in future calculations; each recd.nizes_ -'.hat,

 to expose itself to major military risks
 unless               itself feels its vital _interests
 Jo bp,.threatened.,, However, the Soviets would prob-
 ably continue to believe that the preservation of
 some kind of Communist regime in China was of vital
 interest to them.   They would hope that this re-
 gime under new leadership would purge itself event-
 ually of its present heresies.   But in all matters
 short of survival, China and the USSR will increas-
 ingly view each other as hostile rivals and compet-
 i pg powers.

 Building Communism

 three red banners of the general
 line, the great leap forward, and
 the people's communes.  Now, he

 economic construction and national
 defense can be solved..." --People's

 "Unwillingness to make use of
 the experience of fraternal
 countries and political with-
 drawal are greatly harming
 the Communist cause and hin-

 to go against irrefutable

 "The disease of leftist sec-

 manifests itself in the ac-

 gravely concerned over the
 thesis advanced recently that
 there is a  'temporary majori-
 ty'  in the world Communist
 movement which  'persists in
 its mistakes' and a  'tempo-
 rary minority' which  'boldly
 and resolutely upholds the
 truth.'   To insist on this
 thesis would in effect mean
 to lead matters to fragmen-
 tation of the international
 communist movement... This
 contention is especially
 harmful in that it is asso-
 ciated with the incredible
 pretension of proclaiming
 one party the true heir of
 Lenin... Lenin was in favor
 of recognizing international
 proletarian discipline..."
