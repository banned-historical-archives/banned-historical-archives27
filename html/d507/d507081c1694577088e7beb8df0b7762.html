 Soviet Newspapers Hit by TV Competition.  According to official
 Soviet statistics, circulation of the three best known Soviet dailies,
 PRAVDA, the Party organ, IZVESTIA, the government paper, and KOMSOMOLSKAYA
 PRAVDA, the youth paper, has significantly declined.       Radio Moscow gives
 the following circulation figures for 1965 and 1966:
 1965               1966
 PRAVDA                 7,000,000          6,000,000
 IZVESTIA               7,800,000          7,500,000
 KOMSOMOLSKAYA          6,800,000          "more than
 PRAVDA                                6,000,000"
 Most of the decline seems due to increasing sales of TV sets (16.4
 million sets from 1961 through 1964).  Another reason is that the govern-
 ment has cracked down on newsprint allocations, which formerly were made
 arbitrarily without regard to circulation figures, thus encouraging larger
 runs than the papers were able to sell.  Now, however, the government is
 trying to match allocations to actual sales.  An interesting point is that
 NOVY MIR, the "liberal" monthly, has actually increased its circulation
 despite frequent official censure.  One cause of PRAVDA'S substantial
 decline is probably the boring character of this Party paper; the more
 enlightened IZVESTIA suffered a much smaller fall  in circulation.
 Censorship between Communist Countries?  The German-language weekly
 VOLKSZEITUNG, published in Czechoslovakia for the remnants of the German
 minority, asked in its 23 December 1966 issue for addresses of East
 German friends who might subscribe.  The editor added that the East Ger-
 man Ministry for Post and Publications had "given the assurance that
 henceforth any subscriptions to the VOLKSZEITUNG from the GDR could be
 accepted which had previously been refused" on the grounds that "the
 limit of mutual exchanges of press and cultural products had been filled."
 (In East Germany, as in a number of other countries, post offices also
 handle subscriptions to periodicals.)  What this actually shows is that,
 despite all "post-Stalin thaw," even the flow of publications from one
 Communist country to another remains subject to censorship.  Moreover,
 for o I d Stalinist Ulbricht, the Kremlin's satrap in East Germany, even
 publications from neighboring Czechoslovakia have appeared dangerously
 "liberal" and not fit for his East German subjects.  Now, however, he
 needs Prague's unstinted support in his desperate defense against West
 Germany's diplomatic openings to the East....

 Soviet Jour-            Conservatives Versus
 naZs Berate             Liberals in Moscow
 One Another.
 IZVESTIA, the Soviet
 Government daily, has
 within recent weeks
 chastised both OKTYABR (October), conserva-
 tive monthly, and NOVY MIR (New World), a
 liberal (by Soviet standards) monthly, for
 a running feud they have been conducting
 with one another.  NOVY MIR has for the
 past several years been quite daring at
 times in implicitly criticizing the regime.
 Its most significant action has been to go
 as far as possible in defending writers
 such as Andrey Sinyavsky and Yuri Daniel,
 who were sentenced to hard labor for what
 a Moscow court termed anti-Soviet propa-
 ganda.  OKTYABR, on the other hand, has
 consistently criticized artists and writers
 who do not conform to the Party's prescrip-
 tion of "Socialist realism."  Maybe IZVESTIA
 criticized OKTYABR mainly so that it could
 then attack NOVY MIR.  Foreign subscribers
 to NOVY MIR have often remarked that it is
 always much later in arriving than other
 Soviet publications, leading them to be-
 %r, lieve that it is held up in the censorship
 offices at times for as long as two months.
 Assets might speculate that NOVY MIR'S
 position is being undercut further because
 the Party fears that the liberals may ex-
 press dissent and disaffection just prior
 to or at the impending May 1967 (4 years
 overdue) Congress of the Writers' Union
 of the USSR -- or that they may spoil the
 harmony of 50th Anniversary celebrations.
 Thoughts on           The Study of
 Bridge Building       Mao Tse-tung
 The following
 quotation from
 New China News
 Agency and Look Magazine's (7 February
 1967 issue) comment thereon suggests
 one method of countering Chinese
 claims regarding Mao's magic powers:
 New China News Agency... said
 the bridge, measuring 2,190
 feet in length, was built in
 130 days by workers who "held
 aloft the great red banner of
 Mao Tze-tung's thought and
 studied Chairman Mao's works."
 Think what they could have done
 if they'd had their hands free.

 #11     31 January - 27 February
 1967
 ICM AND "SOCIALIST CAMP" AFFAIRS
 1.  The violent Chinese provocation and abuse of Soviet and other Soviet-
 aligned Communist (and French) diplomatic personnel in Peking during the
 3-week "bloody atrocities" campaign -- in addition to the internal excesses
 and chaos of the "cultural revolution" -- draw further sharp condemnation
 throughout most of the ICM.  Notable exceptions are the Albanians, who,
 after avoiding mention of the CR during the last quarter of 1966, have ral-
 lied to strong support, and the Rumanians, who still remain silent.   (See
 special summary of the "atrocities" campaign in Chronology.)
 2.  Rumania cracks the solid EE Communist front with East Germany against
 ties with Bonn and establishes full diplomatic relations while Bonn simul-
 taneously publicly reiterates its claim to represent all Germans.  A hur-
 riedly-called meeting of Warsaw Pact Foreign Ministers fails to support
 East German demands (after Kosygin publicly endorsed the Bucharest-Bonn
 agreement) and seems to give a "green light" to each country to develop
 relations as it wishes.   (J 31-F 10)
 3.  An "Editing Commission" of delegates from 19 European CPs meets secretly
 in Warsaw to prepare for an April 24-27 meeting of "European Communist and
 workers parties" on European security in Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia: re-
 ported absent are Rumania, Yugoslavia, Albania, Sweden, Norway, Iceland
 and Netherlands.   (F 22-26)
 4.  The Italian CP/CC apparently almost supported the convening of a world
 CP conference regardless of Chinese participation, -- and then hedged in
 the fact of the opposition of a few prominent leftists.   (F 21-24)  The
 Soviets seem to be too preoccupied with the Chinese "atrocities" assault
 to push the conference project during this-period.
 5.  The North Korean and Japanese CPs show further alienation from the
 Chinese.   (F 19-26 and F 9ff-&-14/17, resp.)
 6.  The Albanians further publicize the purported pro-Chinese Polish and
 Soviet underground opposition parties; -- and the Czechs sarcastically
 "expose" the Polish as'a 'one-man "Party."   (F 7 & 14)

 INTERNATIONAL =RONT ORGANIZATIONS
 7. The Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity Organization  AAPSO) Council meets
 in Cyprus to consider a proposal to change the venue for the 5':h AAPSO
 Conference scheduled for Peking this year. With the Chinese boycotting it
 as illegal and Soviet-manipulated, a majority votes to hold it it in Algiers.
 The Chinese charge "open splitting" and threaten to hold their own in Peking.
 (F 3 & 13-16.  See also BPG Item #1106.)
 8.  The Chinese member of the World Peace Council (WPC) Secretariat; boycotts
 a Budapest meeting, though he was reportedly invited.   (F 10-1:..)
 9.  Peking reports completion of the "third Afro-Asian course in journalism"
 under sponsorship of its Afro-Asian Journalists Association, with students
 from Ceylon and 5 African lands.  It also publicizes two further Chinese-
 serving "statements" by its "Afro-Asian Writers Bureau."
 10. We have again :presented a sunsnary of the reporting on China in our
 unclassified Chronology.  Although. it may be rash to offer an interpreta-
 tion, to say nothing of a forecast, it does appear to us that Mao may be
 consenting to a tactical slowdown in the headlong drive to "seize power"
 from the established party/state machine which he had launched in January.
 This was probably forced on him by a combination of factors, most important
 of which are certainly the public confusion and demoralization and the dis-
 ruption of the economy, -- especially the disorganization of the country-
 side with the spring planting period at hand and food supplies at a critical
 level.  Chou En-lai and the Army seem to be leading the move toward modera-
 tion and restoration of order, but there is no reliable evidence of any
 formal or informal grouping of opposition to Mao in the hierarchy.   The big
 question now is whether a "revolution" like this -- a naked effort to seize
 power from the established machine on a nationwide scale -- can be stopped
 "halfway" (or less) to the goat and returned. to a durable equilibrium.
 Probably Chou himself has his dcubts on this one!
 11.
 the Chinese Foreign Ministry did warn the resident correspondents in mid-
 February that it considered their reporting unfriendly and in.pl:Led measures
 might be taken in retaliation.   It seems most likely that this ::::ias :Led the
 correspondents to impose a hea,.y self-censorship upon their reporting.
 12.  Mao Tse-tung is reported. making two personal appearances in small
 groups during the period, meeting February 3rd with the Albanian delegation
 which arrived in January and or, the 15th with a Mauritanian delegation.
 Lin Piao has not been reported in public since November.   The status of Liu
 Shao-chi, Teng Hsiao-ping, and other targets of the CR is still uncertain.

 13.  Chinese media continue to hammer away on the theme of Soviet-U.S.
 collusion in sn anti-China alliance -- and are now facing an increasing
 flow of Soviet charges of Chinese -U.S. collusion!   (J 31 and continuing)
 14.  The CPR lashes out at a new target: a note to Tunisia denounces its
 words and deeds (its "two Chinas" policy) as gross interference, flagrant
 provocations, etc.    (F 16)
 SOVIET AFFAIRS
 15.  Soviet media give heavy coverage to China during this period, report-
 ing in detail on the "outrages" against Soviet personnel and property
 (and those of other countries), describing Chinese persecution of national
 minorities and Moslems (F 10 ff), charging the Chinese with interfering
 with the delivery of supplies to Vietnam for the war effort (F 2 ff),
 blasting them for coddling native capitalists (F 8), citing an anonymous
 "letter from a Chinese schoolboy which depicts the tragedy which millions
 of Chinese citizens are experiencing" in the CR (F 18), etc.
 16.  Most notable among Soviet authoritative comment was a major PRAVDA
 editorial on Feb. 16, the strongest denunciation of Mao's policies and
 appeal to the Chinese people since its Nov. 28, 1966, blast.  Also of
 interest was a Feb. 20 PRAVDA signed article defending the "leading role"
 of a CP against both Maoist attack from the left and erosion from the
 right.
 17.  Kosygin's week-long visit to Britain, while not spectacular in its
 immediate results, seems to indicate some rapprochement from both sides.
 (F 6-13)
 17.  The USSR signs a $100 million military aid agreement with CENTO mem-
 ber Iran. (F 7)
 18.  We have a confidential report that the USSR and Cuba finally signed
 their 1967 trade agreement on Feb. 1.  The Soviets will continue to sub-
 sidize the Cubans to the extent of paying six cents per pound for sugar,
 more than 3 times the current market price.   "Any problems encountered
 during the trade talks had no effect on Soviet military deliveries,"
 which "have been increased in recent months."   (Confidential)
 EAST EUROPE
 19.   A Czech youth brigade of designers and metal workers is reported
 bound for service in Cuba.   (F 7)

 The ''Itru. ^1e in Chine.
 Confusion en:', unreliable reporting; on events in China continues: ire
 main treat these developrr:lents in an outline sururary apart fron our usual
 chronological account.
 A.   The -reat 'January revolution'  :
 In January, the Taoist leadership had. apparently launched a drive to
 seize power frorl.. the established Harty/state machine throughout the land.,
 following the  iuch publicized.  Shan7,hai e:;:ar^ple. '   There a  headquarters'
 of a number of  revolutionary rebel organizations'         he,d first taken over
 the principal newspapers and the local radio station anL._ then proclainee
 the seizure of all power fro,^ the Shan':hai ?-iunicipal Party Corn?_ittee.,
 d.eclarinr the latter to be lea~lin', the opposition to 'iao.  This was followed
 by si*rilar proclwnations of seizure in other provincial centers, while
 P OPLI ` r' DAILY frankly adr^.itted_ that :  7U ht from the be~7innin??, the GPCR
 has been a struggle for seizure of :power.   As it beca?a.e apparent that the
 seizure drive was running, into heavy opposition,  ,ao too.: the risk of
 ord.erinm the Army into the fray, Irith orders to support and. Cefend. the
 'revolutionary rebels  when necessary (even thou.mh they may be .a  terr,pora,ry
 minority ), -   and Awry intervention was reported to have played a decisive
 role in several subsenuent provincial take overs.   "eanzrhile, in Peking
 vrall posters clai?.ed the take over of a dozen central i-:iinistries., and, on
 January 29, the forn.ation of a new Pel~i nom; Revolutionax Nebel Coi mun_e to
 assume and execute the overall Doer  in the capital.  On the 31st_, 7.LD
 FLAG declared: ' The stor:l of the ?Januanr revolution" is now sweepin; the
 whole country.
 B.  The revolution stalled in February: one step backward?
 The revolution apparently 71a'_.16s little or no advance after the  en  of
 January.  "edict announce developments T?rhich are depicted_ as gains,     but
 there is also evidence that so'e of the January claims were not valid or
 have not been maintained.   Ieanwhile, the regriye, showing increasing aware
 ness of the country's dependence on the experiences' cadres of the ?arty/
 State machine, emphasizes the necessity of establishing P.  three way alliance'
 of  revolutionaries , the military, anc' loyal cad.res to  'seize  and hold
 Dower at all levels.  The Army's role in this `alliance  is increasingly
 evident, but it is Chou ?n-lai, preaching moderation, who stands out pro-ii
 nently as the spokesman of the repine, while Lin Piao, out of sight since
 ove-vnber, is rarely even mentioned.   Specifically:

 (1)  T-1., TJ FLAG o,._ ; ro )er treatment of cadres: An editorial Jan. 31, 'On
 the Stru'77le to Seize Power by Proletarian revolutionaries,  acknowledges
 that leading cadres  have greater experience in struggle  they are ,-.ore
 mature politically and they have greater organizational skill.  `.she seizure
 and retention of Dower will be irr.easurably helped by their inclusion in
 the core of leadership.  Cadres who have made errors should be treated
 correctly and should not be overthrotmn indiscriminatey....   The lead
 editorial of RF's next issue  appearing Feb. 22, is entirely devoted to
 the subject:   'Cadres Should':. use Treated Correctly.'
 (2)  The rise and. fall of the "People's Co mune'' ?  Evidence indicates that
 the Peking; regirie has had second thoughts and decided not to permit the
 development of  People's Cormiunes` based on the Paris Commune of 1871, at
 least at this time.
 (a)  There was never any official or press mention of the poster-reported
 (Jan. 29) decision to form a Peking Commune, as far as we know.
 (b)  The Shanghai ;Taoists, heroes of the  January revolution,,  on Feb. 5
 proclaimed the establishment of a `provisional committee of the Shanghai
 People's Commune,  and issued a radical `declaration'  and  Order No. 1,'
 the latter including passages such as:
 "l.  The death sentence is declared to the old' Shanghai Piunicipal
 CCP Committee and the S.. People's Council, depriving then of all
 their power.       All directives and documents concerning; the GPCR signed
 by ... [those organs] since 16 May 1966 are declared null and void
 i:ediately, with the exception of directives and documents of the CCP/CC,
 the State Council, the Central Military Council, and the CR Group under
 the CCP/CC....
 I.  Instruments of the proletarian dictatorship, including public
 security bureaus, courts, procuratorates, broadcasting stations, and
 newspaper agencies, shall be subjected to the...Corunune....
 While Shanghai media continue to -publicize the Commune during the follow-
 ing 18 days, Peking never mentions this new development.  Finally, on Feb.
 23, Shanghai renames the Commune as the  'Shanghai `lunicipal Revolutionary
 Committee (S"M-,,C),      in accord with  the correct instruction of the Cen-
 tral Committee:'   However, the first resolution of the renamed S?-'?C on
 Feb. 24 declares that:
 The founding of the SMEC is the beginning of the steeping-up of
 the struggle for the seizure of power and. definitely not the end....
 Our future tasks in the struggle will be more arduous and complicated....

 (c)  11 days after Shanghai, on Feb. 16; the  4aoists in Harbin form a
 provisional committee of the Harbin People s s Cora .une . `  The first paragraph of their ' Tlotice N'`To.  1'  is almost identical with that in Shanghai,
 but they hasten to emphasize proper treatment of cadres.  ~;;arlier in February,
 Peking media had warmly endorsed. the Hower seizure in Harbin.   It was one
 of the first cases of decisive intervention by the Army, after the 'laoists
 had been surrounded. by the so called Jung Fu Chun ('army of the disabled.
 and demobilized )-This was also the only '7ao province to retain the 0l0
 Party first secretary.  All Peking papers on the 11th had front-paged
 the new experience created by the revolutionary rebels in Iieilungkiang
 Province, namely, the allied seizure of -power through the "three way cor-ubina?--
 tion'                  of revolutionary organizations; Army units stationerCl there, and
 revolutionary leading cadres in the Party and Government organizations.'
 Since the announcement of the I=iarbin Co:?.Lmune, however ; Peking has not men?
 tioned Harbin or Heilungkiang Province, as far as we know:
 (3)  The `back where you belong;  movement :  A series of measures were repor.--
 ted taken to get people back to their homes, jobs, farris, and schools,
 including:
 -  A CCP/CC.State Council decision of Feb. 7 to suspend the  long marches'
 and send all Red Guards home.
 _?.W An order by the same organs on Feb. 16 disbanding all mass national
 revolutionary organizations not recognized by the central authorities.
 :?:[embers must immediately return to their native provinces or to their work
 posts.
 A Feb. 17 order by the same organs directing all rural workers to get
 back to their jobs.  A CCP/CC regulation of same date stipulating that
 literary workers should return to their posts.
 CCP/CC directives of the 4th and 12th that all primary and secondary
 schools will reopen by March 1, leaving only the universities closed.  While
 giving top priority to the need to pursue the CR and study Tao's thought in
 the schools, they recognize that some other subjects may be taught: 'even
 during the period of the CR, primary schools must study arithrr.etic and
 basic science,' and, in the secondary schools, "necessary lessons, such as
 mathematics, physics, and foreign languages, shall also be studied."
 (4)  Concern about surin   jantinp and cultivation:  A number of coriniunica-
 tions, including especially a Feb. 11  urgent proposal  from the awriculture
 and forestry departments and a Feb. 20 letter from the CCP/CC to all rural
 corm-runes, show serious concern lest the CR disrupt spring planting.  The CC
 'Military Affairs Committee on the 25th directs the troops  to support
 vigorously  spring cultivation.

 (5)  The key role of the ~?.ilitary-   -arlier reporting and speculation threw
 doubt on the 16yalt ,-caresiveness ; and .probable role of the military,
 but these doubts were not substantiated, the army has increasingly er.,iergecl
 as the only real force capable of order.  It is the fs.rr~y which is called on
 to effect the `threeway alliance' with the  revolutionaries  and cadres
 and to quash extremists among the `rebels.  In Peking, the Military
 Affairs Committee took over control of the Public Security Bureau on Feb.
 11: on the 25th, presumably in support of the above--mentioned order dis-
 banding all unauthorized national organizations, it issued an 5--page decree
 banning eight (or nine?) specific groups using Red Guard or revolutionary
 names.
 (6)  Chou Fn-Lai at the helm?  As indicated above, Chou Ln-lai has increas--
 ingly appeared as the spokesman of the regime, always nominally loyal to
 Mao but counseling moderation and defending the Party/State hierarchy.
 (Speaking to a meeting of finance and trade personnel on the 17th, he went
 so far as to disclose that Coal Minister Chang Lin-chi had died in Red
 Guard captivity followinm 4+0 days of brutal interrogation. )  With Mao out
 of sight, Lin Piao out of sight and almost unmentioned, and even Chiang
 Ching (Mrs. Mao) seemingly subdued., Chou may well be the man in charge
 .insofar as any man can be!
 C.  Chinese censorship?
 European correspondents were practically prevented. from functioningin
 Peking during the first half of. February and seem. to have been somewhat
 inhibited since, leaving the outside world store dependent than ever on the
 Japanese.  Since about the 20th however, the volume of Japanese reporting
 has fallen off sharply, with only one or two new items corning out some
 days.  It may be that they are being subjected to pressure if not actual
 censorship.
 The Chinese "atrocities' campaign
 Since the initial altercation of Chinese students with Soviet Police
 in Moscow's Red Square on January 25, the Chinese expand their campaign of
 provocations and demonstrations-on the theme of  bloody, fascist, revisionist
 atrocities" to unprecedented scale and violence for almost three weeks --
 involving acrimonious exchanges with the Mongolians, French, Czechs, Poles,
 Bulgarians, East Germans, and Hungarians as well as the Soviets, and
 drawing sharp criticism from many other CPs,     until they suddenly ter-
 minate it about February 13.  Soviet media as well as third parties abute the campaign to Pekin-`s desire to divert the attention of its people
 p
 from the difficulties of the CR and rally xenophobic nationalism to its
 support,   - with the ultimate hope of pushing the Soviets to breal. relations.

 In "oscoNr the Soviets refuse a Feb. 1 Chinese request for another group

 to stop them.  This leads to a  louc?.sneaker war.,  with truck-rnounted Soviet
