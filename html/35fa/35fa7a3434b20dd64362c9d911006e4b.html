 NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SURVEY PUBLICATIONS
 The basic unit of the NIS is the General Survey, which  is  now
 published in abound-by-chapter format so that topics of greater per-
 ishability can be updated on an individual basis. These chapters-Country
 Profile, The Society, Government and Politics, The Economy, Military Geog-
 raphy, Transportation and Telecommunications, Armed Forces, Science, and
 Intelligence and Security, provide the primary NIS coverage. Some chapters,
 particularly Science and Intelligence and Security, that are not pertinent to
 all countries, are produced selectively. For small countries requiring only
 minimal NIS treatment, the General Survey coverage may be bound into
 one volume.
 Supplementing the General Survey is the NIS Basic Intelligence Fact-
 book, aready reference publication that semiannually updates key sta-
 tistical data found in the Survey. An unclassified edition of the factbook
 omits some details on the economy, the defense forces, and the intelligence
 and security organizations.
 Although detailed sections on many topics were part of the NIS
 Program, production of these sections has been phased out. Those pre-
 viously produced will continue to be available as long  as the major
 portion of the study is considered valid.
 A quarterly listing of all active NIS units is published in the Inventory
 of Available NIS Publications, which is also bound into the concurrent
 classified Factbook. The Inventory lists all NIS units by area name and
 number and includes classification and date of issue; it thus facilitates the
 ordering of NIS units as well as their filing, cataloging, and utilization.
 Initial dissemination, additional  copies  of  NIS  units,  or  separate
 chapters of the General Surveys can be obtained directly or through
 liaison channels from the Central Intelligence Agency.
 The General Survey is prepared for the NIS by the Central Intelligence
 Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency under the general direction
 of the NIS Committee. It is coordinated, edited, published, and dissemi-
 nated by the Central Intelligence Agency.

 The Other Superpower
 Winston Churchill's famous description of Russia as
 "a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma"
 seems less apt today. For more than a quarter of a cen-
 tury of cold war, the Soviet Union has been scrutinized
 and analyzed as the United States' chief adversary.
 Now it is coming more fully into view in the new light
 of the recent rapid development of unprecedented
 levels of peacetime contact with the West.' The sum-
 mit meetings of President Nixon and Communist Par-
 ty General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev in May 1972
 and  June  1973,  and  the  signing  of  nearly  20
 agreements in little more than a year's time, have laid
 the basis for extensive cooperation between the two
 countries. But there still is no clear-cut answer to the
 question of Russia's real nature and intentions, no cer-
 tain knowledge of the directions it will take at home
 and the role it will play abroad. The Soviet Union's
 nuclear arsenal and  its extraordinary influence in
 world politics make it the X-factor in almost all U.S.
 national security and foreign policy calculations. The

 awesome fact that the Soviet Union could virtually
 destroy  the  United  States  in  a  matter  of
 minutes-however much this oversimplifies the com-
 plexities of U. S.-Soviet relations-gives the U.S.S.R. a
 unique position in international affairs: it alone ranks
 with the United States as a superpower.
 These two countries soared to their unique status
 from vastly different backgrounds in less than six
 decades.  Whereas  America's  culture  has  been
 predominantly Protestant and Anglo-Saxon, Russia's
 was  Byzantine  and  Russian  Orthodox.  While  in-
 dividual liberty and democracy were developing in
 England, America's motherland, the Mongol horde
 tyrannized the conquered Russians for 250 years-tum-
 ing the clock back, many Russians still believe, that
 far behind the rest of Europe.  Russia had neither
 Renaissance  nor  Reformation.  Its  modernization,
 launched by Peter the Great, has been marked not
 by democratization  but  by the imposition of  an
 oppressive,  highly centralized,  bureaucratic autoc-
 racy-first  under  the  tsars,  and  then  under  the
 Communists. On the eve of World War I, the Union
 of Soviet Socialist Republics did not yet exist, and its
 predecessor,  Imperial  Russia,  was  underdeveloped,
 weakened from its defeat by Japan in 1905, and
 menaced by the rising power of Imperial Germany.
 "1'he two World Wars wrought an enormous revolution
 in international politics, politics which swiftly became
 polarized around the American and Soviet power that
 had  emerged  supreme.  Even  the  remarkable
 post-World  War  II  recovery  of  Western  Europe,
 China, and Japan has been overshadowed by the
 colossal growth in economic, technological and, above
 all,  military power of  the  United States and the
 U.S.S.R.
 Yet  for  all  its  immense  power,  the  U.S.S.R.  is
 strangely insecure. It is reaching out to the West and
 yet  trying  to  hold  it  at  bay,  seemingly  eager  to
 promote reconciliation and yet anxious to limit its im-
 pact at home. It has achieved rough nuclear parity
 with  the  United  States  and  has  consolidated  its
 dominance in Eastern Europe, yet it remains obsessed
 by rivalry with China, a country much weaker in
 economic and military terms.  The Soviet Union's
 .political tructure would appear to an outsider to be
 solid and secure, and its society, by Western stan-
 dards, would seem to be a model of law and order. Yet
 political structure would appear to an outsider to be
 solid and secure, and its society, by Western stand-
 ards, would seem to be a model of law and order. Yet
 the U.S.S.R. has tightened ideological controls and its
 secret police have been engaged in a relentless cam-
 paign to crush a small scattering of reform-minded
 and minority national dissidents as if they posed a real
 threat to Soviet power. It is a paradoxical country that
 is publicly triumphant but privately defensive, con-
 stantly proclaiming "socialist superiority"  and yet
 fearful of not being able to compete effectively with
 the capitalist West. It has become industrialized yet
 not really modern.  It has gained growth but lost
 momentum.
 ~~~  The  Communist  Party  of  the  Soviet  Union-
 designated  in  the  Constitution  as  the  "leading
 rv core  of  all  organization.  both  public  and
 ~l+ state"-dominates the country and determines the
 course it is to follow, primarily by placing its people in
 key posts at all administrative levels of the govern-
 ment and in other vital institutions. Through this in-
 terlocking  arrangement  the  party  controls  the
 machinery of government, runs the economy, directs
 the armed forces and police, manages the news and
 communications media, and regulates the country's
 purportedly independent educational, legal, cultural,
 and  social  institutions.  It formulates  policies and
 oversees their implementation.  The party vests its
 decisionmaking authority in a tiny elite, the Politburo
 of the Central Committee, and "politics" becomes
 largely a matter of the conspiring and maneuvering
 among these party leaders,  rather than a struggle
 between the party and special interest groups. The
 power wielded by these party leaders is checked only
 by the need to strike a consensus among themselves
 and by the inertia of the ponderous bureaucratic ap-
 paratus they manipulate.
 The men cloistered in the Kremlin (the Russian
 word for fortress; its ancient walls in the capital city of
 Moscow enclose major government office buildings)
 serve  both  the  Soviet  national  interest  and  an
 ideological  commitment  to  promote  world  com-
 munism. And like Russian rulers in centuries past,
 they seem to be motivated additionally by a hatred of
 backwardness and a consuming desire to be con-
 sidered equals by the West, especially by Washington.
 Like Russian tsars since Peter the Great, they are
 borrowing  and  adapting  techniques  from  major
 adversaries the better to catch up with and surpass
 them.
 The Soviet system remains a secretive one, whose
 communications  media  can  extol  the  benefits  of
 cooperation with the West without disclosing to the
 Soviet citizenry the giant grain purchases it had to
 make from Western nations in 1972. It asks Western
 bankers to put up millions of dollars in loans, but is
 reluctant to permit them normal financial informa-
 tion  about  its  foreign-exchange reserves and gold
 supply.  Foreign  enterprises  negotiating  long-term
 deals for Soviet natural gas involving vast investments

 are not permitted the kind of easy access for their
 specialists  that  they  are  accustomed  to  receiving
 elsewhere.  The Soviet leaders talk of opening up
 East-West relations, yet demand a ban on satellite
 television  relay  without  prior  approval  of  the
 programs.
 This is a country of such anomalies that almost no
 portrait of it is quite accurate. It is proclaimed to be a
 classless society, yet many of its members appear to be
 more status conscious than their counterparts in the
 capitalist West. Those who make up the political,
 economic, and cultural elite are served by a special
 network of well-stocked, cutrate stores; they enjoy a
 host of privileges that are beyond the reach of the
 common man and are often more important than
 money in an economy of consumer shortages. Many
 ordinary citizens genuinely seem to consider their
 system a superior one, and indeed can imagine no
 other. What matters most is that they are better off
 now than ever  before. Yet their standard of living
 is not only below that in the developed West but
 also below that in most of Eastern Europe.
 Even though it is a superpower, extremes of ad-
 vancement and underdevelopment, of the good and
 the  bad,  exist side  by side.  Although  the  Soviet
 Moscow's Metro-an ornate subway with chandeliers
 economy  and  scientific community  obviously  are
 capable of great achievements-exemplified by the
 Sputnik of 1957 and the first manned space flight in
 1961, the construction of the world's most massive
 hydroelectric complexes, the rapid development of
 Siberian oil fields, and the buildup of an advanced
 military arsenal- perhaps its most striking feature is
 the lopsided nature of its development. While earth
 satellites are being launched, there still are occasional
 shortages of potatoes and other staple foods. There are
 subways in several Soviet cities-Moscow boasts a
 superior one-and public surface transport is good.
 Taut away from urban centers, most of the roads are
 astonishingly primitive. At Voronezh, work progresses
 on a 1,500-mile-per-hour jet transport plane while, in
 surrounding  villages,  farmers  with  two  buckets
 dangling  from  a  shoulder  yoke  tote  water  from
 community  wells  to  their  weatherbeaten  log
 homes.
 Typically, Soviet industry has developed the kind of
 brute strength represented by the giant Kama River
 project, a crash effort to build a manufacturing com-
 plex capable of turning out 150,000 big trucks and a
 quarter of a million diesel engines a year, dwarfing
 anything in Detrcrit, or anywhere in the West. It is a
 prime symbol of the Soviet passion for bigness, and

 the belief that bigger means better. But the centrally
 planned Soviet economy has been unable to generate
 enough quality technology and convert it into produc-
 tion fast enough. It lacks the driving force of competi-
 tion that stimulates technological development in the
 West, and Soviet theorists and planners have yet to
 devise an adequate way to fill the void.
 The picture is not entirely bleak, especially for the
 Soviet urbanite, for whom the quantity of new hous-
 ing is impressive and the availablity of cars and even
 scimmer houses outside the city is on the rise. The state
 keeps housing costs low, and foots the bill for medical
 care. Nevertheless, random and unpredictable short-
 ages of hundreds of everyday items seem to,be almost
 endemic in the U.S.S.R. Alongside shortages there are
 surpluses-of poor-quality clothing and shoes, and
 outmoded  models  of  television  sets  and  washing
 -nachines. Such imbalances between supply and de-
 mand, along with evidence of gross waste of resources,
 have long been a part of the Soviet scene. But they
 have acquired a new dimension with the embryonic
 affluence of the Soviet consumer, long accustomed to
 the bottom position on the totem pole of Soviet invest-
 ment priorities. Even though Soviet consumers today
 really can be considered affluent only in comparison
 with their past levels, there has indeed been a signifi-
 cant increase in recent years in the availability of con-
 sumer goods in the U.S.S.R.-enough, ironically, to
 increase the pressure on a system ill-designed to satisfy
 more sophisticated consumer demand.
 One of the most critical tasks confronting the Soviet
 leadership is to forge the organization and design the
 incentives that will match supply and demand over
 the  whole  range of consumer goods and services
 with efficiency and dispatch. The Kremlin's char-
 acteristically  topheavy,  bureaucratic  approach  is
 exemplified by the fact that the agency created 7 years
 ago to study market demand is now engaged in coor-
 dinating  a  massive  (and  seemingly  ineffective)
 demand-forecasting  project  involving  40  separate
 research institutes. This has produced frenetic activity
 and reams of reports by the multiple bureaus in-
 volved, but not the answers for such critical problems
 as how to generate incentives that will insure a rapid
 and precise response to demand forecasts on the part
 of producers and the distribution system.
 The natural riches of the U.S.S.R.-including oil,
 gas, uranium, and gold-are vast indeed. But the
 Soviets still trail the United States in most fields of
 production-except for cement and coal. And in con-
 sumer  goods,  of  course,  there  is  no  com-
 parison-America's  per  capita  lead  is  3  to  1  in
 ownership of refrigerators, 2 to 1 in washing machines,
 Soviet medical students. With
 medical care offered to every

 largely because the bulk of the Soviet housewife's food

 the battle against indestructible plastic bags,  non-
 recyclab'le cans, and "no deposit, no return" bottles
 power  consideration,  are  comparable  in  quantity.
 Yet, despite the surprising signs of backwardness
 that can be noted in the Soviet economy, it has
 nevertheless built military muscle second in its overall
 strength and sophistication only to that of the United
 States. In recent years the U.S.S.R. has developed its
 weaponry to the point that the remaining differences
 between the military arsenals of the two superpowers
 are in large measure of a geostrategic nature, founded
 in the world distribution of land and sea. A com-
 parison of their military forces reflects the inherent
 differences  in  land-based  and  sea-based  power.
 Inasmuch as the United,States has few neighbors, and
 the U.S.S.R. many,* with several in the enemy camp,
 there is a striking contrast in the number of inter-
 mediate and medium-range ballistic missiles and of
 long-range and medium-range bombers, and in the
 number of aircraft and helicopter carriers that each
 possesses. Intercontinental ballistic missiles, being es-
 sentially independent of the land power versus sea
 economy.
 All these shortcomings in the Soviet economy are
 accentuated by the present decline in the impressive
 economic growth rates of the postwar period. Despite
 the growth of the Soviet gross national product (GNP)
 by about 80% over the past decade as opposed to a lit-
 tle over 60% for the United States, America's GNP is
 almost double that of the U.S.S.R., and last year the
 Soviet economy grew more slowly than that of the
 United States. In part, this is a result of the growing
 complexity of later stages of economic development.
 It is clear that the Soviet Union can no longer achieve
 growth so easily by adding to its labor force and its
 capital stock, as it did in the sixties. From now on,
 growth depends primarily on greater efficiency, and
 that has never been the strong suit of the Soviet
 'The Soviet Union has more foreign states on its borders than any
 other country. The United States has common land frontiers with
 only two other countries, Canada and Mexico, and a radius of 500
 miles extends only four more-Cuba, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and
 (from Alaska) the Soviet Union. The U.S.S.R. has common bound-
 aries with 13 countries: Norway, Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
 Hungary,  Romania,  Turkey,  Iran,  Afghanistan,  India,  China,
 Mongolia,  and  North  Korea.  And  within  500  miles  of  Soviet
 territory lie 17 more: Sweden, Denmark, East Germany, West Ger-
 many, Italy, Austria, Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Syria,
 Iraq, Pakistan, Nepal, Japan, South Korea, and the United States
 (Alaska). The 4,600-mile Soviet border with China is the longest
 land frontier in the world.
 Reaching a position of strategic parity with the
 United States has given the Soviets a new confidence
 in their international standing. If that confidence is
 somewhat shaken by concern about economic short-
 comings and the growth of China as a great power,  STAT
 the leadership has closed ranks behind Brezhnev's
 prescribed remedy-detente policies toward the West,
 mixed with tighter political and ideological controls
 at  home.  Brezhnev's  preeminence  in  the  Soviet
 leadership was dramatically underscored at the Soviet
 Communist Party plenum in April 1973. That sort of
 gathering is expected to put a rubberstamp of ap-
 proval on a foreign policy program enunciated by the
 party's boss, but on this occasion the praise was un-
 commonly lavish and convincing. Premier Kosygin,
 President Podgomyy, and the leading party ideologist,
 Mikhail Suslov took the dais to endorse Brezhnev's
 foreign policy report, and the plenum gave the green
 light to his summit trips to Bonn and Washington. At
 the same time, major changes took place in the Polit-
 buro, the power center of the party. It features the ad-
 dition of the Chairman of the State Security Com-
 mittee (KGB), the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the
 Minister of Defense-men who are among Brezhnev's
 strongest  supporters-and  the  explusion  from  the
 Politburo of two of his apparent critics.
 The changes in the Politburo,  by adding  more
 government officials, give it somewhat more of the
 look of a traditional cabinet. But in this, too, the
 appearance is paradoxical. The shakeup actually in-
 dicated that personnel changes, instead of being on an
 institutional basis, still are made on personal and
 political grounds and that the Soviet system of rule
 remains one of men, not law. The system maintains an
 essentially closed society, and its security continues to
 rest, if somewhat less nakedly than in Stalin's time, on
 censorship, police controls, and persistent efforts to en-
 force intellectual conformity, even through threat of
 arrest and banishment to prison labor camps. In all of
 this there is evidence that many features of modern
 Soviet society are in fact bridges from the past. May
 Day  and  Revolution  Day  parades  through  Red
 Square, for example, when huge portraits of Soviet
 leaders  are  borne  aloft,  are  not  unlike  religious
 processions in old Russia. Even Brezhnev's turn to the
 West for the acquisition of capital, advanced equip-
 ment,  and  technological  know-how  fits  the  fluc-
 tuating  pattern  of  Russian  history since  Peter the
 Great opened his celebrated "window to the West" in
 the early 18th century. While its best may be based on
 the borrowed or copied, the outside world is never
 really admitted. For all the techniques from with-
 out,  Russia  today  remains  much  a  continent  to
 itself.

 The magnitude and diversity of the Soviet Union
 are almost  incredible.  It is an awesome land of
 prodigious dimensions, where herds of reindeer trek
 through arctic blizzards while caravans of camels are
 driven across burning deserts. Its rulers are still en-
 gaged in a centuries-old effort to develop and consoli-
 date their immense territory and their multinational
 people. The political and economic benefits associated
 with a country of size and diversity are numerous, as
 demonstrated by the history of the United States. And
 for the U.S.S.R., which is at a lower stage of economic
 development, many of the benefits are only partially
 realized. But the problems related to the size and
 diversity  of  the  Soviet  Union  are  enormous,
 too-including long distances to be overcome by
 transport and communication lines, difficult climatic
 conditions,  unassimilated  national  cultures,  and
 maldistribution of resources in relation to population.
 The processes of development and consolidation are
 not nearly complete; the tasks and obstacles ahead
 are, like the land, of epic proportions.
 The U.S.S.R. is by far the largest country in the
 world-more than twice the size of China, nearly 2'/a
 times the size of the United States, and 40 times the
 size of France, the largest country in Europe. From its
 western border with Poland on the Baltic Sea, the
 Soviet Union sprawls across the northern half of
 Eurasia roughly 6,000 miles to its easternmost point,
 Ratmanov Island, in the Bering Strait of the Pacific. It
 covers the eastern half of Europe, takes up two-thirds
 of the Eurasian continent, and encompasses close to
 half of the northern hemisphere. From north to south
 it extends 2,800 miles from the Arctic Ocean to the
 Afghan border.
 When on a summer evening the sun sinks below the
 horizon on the western borders of the U.S.S.R., it is
 simultaneously rising to greet the following day on the
 eastern borders. The Soviet Union is a country where
 the sun never sets-a phenomenon which actually is a
 product  of  its  polar  position,  but  which  is  also
 s~iggestive of the broad sweep of the land. Its territory
 stretches across  171  of the 360 degrees of global
 longitude and is wrapped around the Arctic Ocean
 and  the  North  Pole-the strategic significance of
 which is illustrated by noting that to take the most
 direct route between Moscow and Los Angeles, one
 would travel northwards. The Soviet polar position is
 enhanced by the fact that its Arctic coastal waters are
 somewhat less bound by ice and land obstructions
 than those of North America. Soviet Arctic navigation
 and scientific research are more extensive than any
 other nation's. In addition to the observation that
 the shortest distance between the Soviet Union and
 the contiguous states of the United States is across
 the polar ice, the size and strategic location of the
 U.S.S.R. is further illustrated by its proximity to other
 key countries and areas, which gives it a natural in-
 terest and potential for involvement. In Asia, not only
 does it border China, North Korea, and Mongolia, but
 Japan lies just across the Sea of Japan, and even closer
 in the Kuril Islands. Pakistan is a mere 10 miles and
 India only 175 miles from Soviet territory. In addition
 to bordering on Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and the
 Middle East, the Soviet Union is separated from the
 Mediterranean  only  by  the  Bosporus  and  the
 Dardanelles.
 The size of the Soviet Union gives it more diversity
 than  any  other  country  in  natural  conditions,
 resources, and peoples. Its great varieties of landscape,
 climate, and vegetation fall mainly into four major
 natural zones from north to south-tundra, taiga,
 steppe, and desert. Agricultural land has been carved
 out of the more hospitable taiga and steppe areas to
 form a distinctive region within the basic zones. There
 is also a relatively small subtropical zone on the Black
 Sea.
 The  often-frozen  tundra  of  the  Far  North  is
 characterized  by  extremely  cold  climate,  sparse
 vegetation of mostly mosses and lichens, and poor
 soils. The few inhabitants maintain a bare nomadic
 existence, and reindeer herding is a primary endeavor.
 South of the tundra is a broad belt of taiga forests,
 encompassing 4 million square miles and stretching
 across the country from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific
 Ocean. The taiga is the world's richest and most ex-
 tensive forest of pine, spruce, and larch. These conifers
 give way to broadleaf forests on the southern edge of
 the zone. The winters of the taiga are long and bitterly
 cold, especially in continental Siberia. Here some of
 the lowest temperatures on earth-more than 90 de-
 grees below zero-have been recorded. Permanently
 frozen soils prevail in much of the area.  Human
 settlement in these harsh conditions has been es-
 tablished  chiefly to exploit valuable mineral and
 timber resources, but large urban-industrial centers
 thrive along the southern periphery of the taiga.

 As cold dominates the tundra and taiga, drought is
 the key feature of the natural environment in the
 steppe and desert zones. The natural grasslands of the
 steppe support a large population, and vast areas are
 devoted to agriculture, particularly in the northern
 steppe where good soil and adequate rainfall prevail.
 Some of~ the most fertile soils-the chernozems-are
 located  in  an  east-west  belt  extending  from  the
 Ukraine to Siberia and are the backbone of Soviet
 agriculture. The southern and drier steppe zone is the
 Soviet "dust bowl,"  where habitation as well as
 agriculture is marginal at best. The introduction of
 irrigation systems and measures to prevent erosion
 have improved land use there, resulting in more settle-
 ment toward the southern limits of the steppe.
 Much of Soviet Central Asia is in the semidesert or
 desert zone. Rainfall is minimal because of the vast
 distance from the ocean, and there is little vegetation.
 Some of the highest temperatures on earth-over 120
 degrees  above  zero-have  been  recorded  in  this
 region. But in spite of the inhospitable natural con-
 ditions, there are pockets of fertile land in river valleys
 and  several  large  cities  flourish  in  these  oases.
 Elsewhere in the desert zone, agriculture has been in-
 troduced and established through extensive irrigation
 efforts, and the population is being extended into
 what once was barren wasteland.
 1'he small subtropical region which rims the Black
 Sea provides a unique landscape in contrast with the
 four  major  natural  zones.  The southern coast of
 Crimea and the eastern Black Sea coast of Caucasia,
 which are sheltered from polar winds, have developed
 into the Soviet "Riviera," teeming with vacationers.
 The mild climate and high rainfall also make it possi-
 ble to raise tea and citrus crops valued throughout the
 U.S.S.R.
 The quarter billion inhabitants of the U.S.S.R. pre-
 sent contrasts as striking as those of the land. The
 Soviet Union is truly a multinational state and accords
 official recognition to each of its minorities, even to
 the point of giving the larger ones the trappings of
 national statehood. There are more than 120 distinct
 nationalities in the U.S.S.R., varying in size from the
 Russian nationality-which accounts for slightly more
 than half of the total population-to the Yukagir
 minority,  with  about  500  members.  National
 traditions are as diverse; this potpourri of peoples in-
 cludes the Europeanized Baltic peoples, the Turkic
 groups of Central Asia with their Middle Eastern
 lifestyles, and the dwindling Chukchi and Koryaks of
 the Far North, close relatives of the American Indian.
 Slavic peoples make up the dominant element in
 the population-specifically eastern Slavs, the closely
 related Russians, Ukrainians, and Belorussians. They
 speak mutually intelligible languages, and together
 make up more than three-fourths of the total popula-
 tion of the Soviet Union. Some of the non-Slavic
 nationalities show a strong tendency towards assimila-
 tion. by the Russians, and are rapidly abandoning their
 languages. In physical characteristics, most Slavs are
 broadheaded, of medium height and stocky build and
 differ little in appearance from the populations of cen-
 tral and eastern Europe.
 Russians,  Ukrainians,  and  Belorussians all have
 their antecedents in the Rus, an 8th century mixture of
 Viking  (or  Varangian) overlords and  Slavic  com-
 moners who held military and commercial hegemony
 in North Russia and south along the Don and Dnepr
 waterways to the shores of the Black Sea. Among the
 Rus, the Grand Princes of Kiev were in the ascendancy
 during the 9th and 10th centuries. After the sacking of
 Kiev by the Mongols (in  1230), however, Russian
 leadership gradually passed to Moscow, which was
 relatively safe in the forested north from the raids of
 steppe nomads. Vast territories in the south and west
 then  came  under  the  control  of  foreign  con-
 querors-mainly  Poles  and  Lithuanians-and  the
 peoples of these territories developed separately from
 the  Russians  as  Ukrainians  and  Belorussians.
 Muscovy, the state which succeeded Kiev and was to
 be the foundation of modern Russia, expanded its
 control over neighboring Russian states through a
 combination of fortuitous alliances and conquests. In
 the 15th and 16th centuries its grand dukes came to
 speak for all the Russian people and Moscow became
 the  focus  for  a  growing  national  self-awareness.
 Although checked and even thrown back in the west,
 the Russians expanded rapidly to the east, conquering
 the Tartar khanates along the Volga while merchant-
 adventurers and their Cossack freebooters penetrated
 into the depths of Siberia. Since then the Russians
 have been the main and decisive nationality and have
 largely determined the character of the subsequent
 political organization, culture, and historical destiny
 of all the non-Russian peoples that have been incor-
 porated into Muscovy, the Empire, and the U.S.S.R.
 As a result, even though the terms are applied loosely,
 in  general  usage-outside  the  Soviet
 Union-"Russia" has long denoted the entire country
 and "Russians" its people.
 The Soviets are clearly caught on the horns of a
 dilemma as they attempt to work out a coherent

 nationalities. policy. The multiplicity of nationality
 political units, languages, customs, and preferences
 clearly is unwieldy and inefficient. Yet much as they
 might favor rapid assimilation, Soviet leaders find it
 difficult  to  apply  pressures  which  smack  of  the
 russification policies of the tsarist era. They remain
 ideologically committed to Lenin's policy of assuring
 national diversity, a policy which was tactically de-
 signed to win for the Bolsheviks the support of the non-
 Russian nationalities on the eve of the revolution.
 '           The result of that policy is a patchwork of national-
 ity units evident in the division of the country into 15
 Union  Republics of widely varying size, each  in-
 habited by a major nationality which gives its name to
 the republic. The Union Republics are divided into
 120 territories and regions which are broken down into
 districts, towns, urban settlements, and rural districts.
 Within the territories and regions there also are a
 number of smaller nationalities formed into essentially
 self-governing units-20 Autonomous Republics, 8
 Autonomous Regions, and 10 National Areas.
 The smallest of the Union Republics, Armenia, is
 nearly  as  large  as  the  states  of  Maryland  and
 Delaware combined. By far the largest is the Russian
 Soviet  Federal  Socialist  Republic (RSFSR)
 which
 ,
 covers all of the northern and western Soviet Union,
 occupying  more  than  three-fourths  of  its  total
 territory-extending to the Black Sea in the south and
 stretching  eastward  to  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Both
 Moscow, the U.S.S.R.'s chief metropolis and capital
 city, and Leningrad which, with a population over 3.5
 million, is the country's second largest city, are located
 in the RSFSR.
 The 14 other Union Republics border the Russian
 Republic on the west and south, forming an arc which
 runs counterclockwise from the Baltic Sea to the tip of
 Mongolia.  The republics of  Estonia,  Latvia, and
 Lithuania are located on the Baltic, below Finland
 and reaching to Poland. Belorussia, the Ukraine-the
 second largest Union Republic in population, having
 more than two- and one-half times the population of
 New York State-and Moldavia border on eastern
 Europe  (Poland,  Czechoslovakia,  Hungary,  and
 Romania). The republics of Georgia, Armenia, and
 Azerbaijan lie between the Black and Caspian Seas,
 and touch Turkey and Iran. Turkmenia, Uzbekistan,
 Tadzhikistan, Kirghizia, and Kazakhstan are in Cen-
 tral Asia, running eastward from the Caspian Sea,
 above  Iran,  Afghanistan,  and  China's  Sinkiang
 Province.  Kazakhstan,  the  second  largest  Union
 Republic in area, is larger than all of the United States
 east of the Mississippi, while occupying only one-sixth
 as much territory as the RSFSR.
 Although  the  U.S.S.R.  has  its  crowded  urban
 centers, including 10 metropolises of more than a
 million inhabitants, a larger proportion cf the Soviet
 people reside in villages and on farms and have a very
 rural lifestyle than is the case in the United States.
 Only as recently as 1961 did Soviet urban dwellers
 outnumber rural residents, a statistical phenomenon
 recorded in the United States in 1918. Even now, less
 than 60% of the Soviet people live in urban areas but,
 as in the United States and elsewhere in industrialized
 states, migration to urban centers is strong. Indeed,
 population and labor maldistribution have become
 major problems in the Soviet Union-while the large
 cities are overcrowded, many rural and remote areas
 are experiencing labor shortages.  Efforts are being
 made to curb the migration to cities, and workers are
 being offered incentives to work in remote regions
 where they are most needed for resource development.
 The heaviest concentrations of population still are
 in the western or European U.S.S.R., but the highest
 population growth rate is in the Muslim Soviet Cen-
 tral  Asian  republics.  Able-bodied  workers  are
 numerous there, but often lack educational oppor-
 tunity and technical skills. Some conflicts and severe
 urban crowding have resulted from the recruitment of
 skilled Slavic workers for these areas. And this kind of
 problem in the distribution of the Soviet population is
 but one indication that the vastness and variety of
 resources and the cultural vitality of a multinational
 state are not unmixed blessings. With all its strength
 and great potential, the Soviet Union also suffers great
 difficulties  because  of  its  size  and  diversity.
 Complications include the fact that its varied cultures
 are unevenly developed, and assimilation produces
 social stresses. Vast areas of its land are unsuitable for
 habitation  or  agriculture.  And  exploitation  and
 transportation of natural resources and the supply of
 goods are difficult over long distances and in the face
 of harsh climate and terrain.

 The Soviet version of "guns or butter," the question
 of  whether  priorities  of  national. power  took
 precedence over consumer interests, was traditionally
 answered quickly by the Kremlin. For decades of cen-
 tral planning, the consumer sector was consistently
 low on the list of Soviet economic priorities, with ar-
 maments and heavy industry at the top. Talk of the
 hoped-for consumer blessings dubbed "goulash com-
 munism"  during the time of Premier Khrushchev
 remained  largely  talk.  Popular  aspirations  for  a
 modest expansion of goods and services available were
 met with little more than the bare necessities of life.
 Beginning in the late 1950's, however, Khrushchev's
 prodding began to swing the economy to the mass
 production of standardized goods, gave the Soviet
 consumer new importance, and brought about signifi-
 cant increases in consumption, largely of more and
 better food and clothing. Ironically, these gains con-
 fronted  Khnishchev's successors with a new set of
 economic problems-those of a slowly emerging con-
 sumer affluence. Steady increases in incomes and con-
 sumption during the 1960's (Soviet per capita dis-
 posable money income increased by more than 85%
 while per capita private consumption increased by less
 than half) put great pressure on a system ill-designed
 to satisfy more sophisticated consumer demands.
 to failures in agriculture, but even industrial produc-
 tion grew by only 5%, the smallest percentage increase
 for that sector since World War II. The slowed in-
 dustrial growth was caused partly by raw material
 shortages stemming from a poor harvest, but mainly
 by the failure to complete scheduled new industrial
 capacity on time and by a significant slump in the. rate
 of growth of productivity.
 In  the  face  of  these  failures,  Soviet  planning
 authorities made significant changes in the 1973 an-
 nual plan, including an overall reduction in the in-
 dustrial output goal. Once again, the consumer sector
 suffered. Its priority was reduced and precedence was
 restored to capital goods, with greater emphasis on the
 completion of numerous projects under construction.
 A much higher goal was also set for agriculture. An ex-
 ceptionally (and suprisingly) good harvest did occur
 last year, and largely as a result of the boost it pro-
 vided, the Soviet economy recovered sharply in 1973
 from its performance the year before. Even though
 they are likely to be of a one-time nature, the 1973
 agricultural gains enabled the Kremlin to renew its
 commitment to consumer welfare in the annual plan
 for 1974. But the 1973 recovery still did not make up
 for earlier shortfalls, and most of the goals of the
 current Five Year Plan apparently have been all but
 abandoned.
 J
 Neglect of consumer interests has been apparent in
 industries producing soft goods and processed foods as
 well as in the production of durable household goods
 and passenger cars. Wearing apparel manufactured in
 the Soviet Union is improving, but some of it is still
 unsalable because of poor sewing, neglect of finishing
 details, poor sizing, monotonous styling, and other
 defects in workmanship. Shoe production is affected
 by  inadequate  supplies  of  raw  materials,  un-
 imaginative styling, and outdated equipment. Radios,
 television sets, and wrist watches are now routinely
 available, but supplies of major electric appliances fall
 far short of demand.
 In recent years Moscow has begun to focus directly
 on the problems of the consumer sector. The Ninth
 Five Year Plan (for 1971 through 1975), although sub-
 sequently altered, has as its so-called "main task" a
 substantial improvement in consumer welfare. Accord-
 ing to the original plan, consumer goods industries
 for the first time were to grow at a faster rate over an
 entire  plan  than  the  heavy  industries  producing
 capital goods. But in 1972, Soviet authorities had to
 acknowledge serious plan failures. The country's gross
 national product (GNP) rose only by 2%, the lowest
 rate of increase since 1963 and only one-third of the
 planned increment of 5.9%. This was due in large part
 J
 The current Soviet leadership seems aware of the
 risk of widespread alienation of the work force for lack
 of incentives, and clearly has pledged itself to finding
 ways of satisfying consumer needs. At the same time,
 however, the Kremlin has displayed no eagerness to
 alter its costly weapons development priorities and
 continues to be unwilling to make sacrifices in other
 economic sectors that traditionally have received most
 of its attention. Nor has it shown a readiness to meet
 the malaise in the consumer sector with bold or im-
 aginative reforms. Instead, the leadership response
 seems to be one of muddling through with stop-gap
 efforts, and the Soviet economy, while demonstrably
 able to provide plenty of guns and an adequate ration
 of goulash, is still unable to provide the quantity and
 quality of goods and services the Soviet people desire.
 Before the beginning of the 20th century, the coun-   '
 try's industrial development was almost entirely con-
 centrated in the European heartland. Raw materials
 were transported to industrial sites adjacent to the
 large coal deposits of the Moscow River Basin in
 Russia and of the Donets River Basin in the Ukraine.
 The  major mineral  base was the Ural  Mountain
 region, which itself developed as a major industrial   i 1
 area. As coal and mineral deposits in western Siberia   ~,/

 and Kazakhstan were developed, industry expanded
 eastward.  Recent  industrial  development  in  the
 eastern regions of the country has been significant, es-
 pecially in western Siberia and Central~Asia, but it still
 does not approach the level of development of the in-
 dustrial centers of the western part of the country,
 where skilled labor resources, industrial plants, and
 transportation networks are well established.
 Outside these established centers, the rest of the
 U.S.S. R.-the North, large parts of Siberia, the Far
 East,  Kazakhstan,  and other locations in Central
 Asia-is engaged in exploring, building, and tying
 together.,Efforts are being made to extend transporta-
 tion  lines,  develop  power  resources,  expand  raw
 material production, build factories, and encourage
 settlement in these areas.
 At the same time the older industrial regions and
 their cities are plagued by congestion, inadequate
 housing, obsolescence, pollution, power shortages and
 overtaxed supply systems. The government's efforts to
 encourage the expansion of industry and population
 in the east, which could solve some of these problems,
 have had only minimal impact. The government is
 also making slow progress in dispersing industry from
 congested centers to small and medium-sized satellite
 towns to create new regional industrial and popula-
 tion agglomerations.
 To redress some of the major imbalances of resource
 and industry location, the Kremlin is promoting some
 grandiose schemes. Among these are efforts to bolster
 .the European industrial regions by importing electric
 power from western Siberia and Kazakhstan and by
 diverting north-flowing river waters southward to, the
 industrialized Volga region and the Caspian Sea, and
 also to the steppes and semideserts of Kazakhstan.
 The Soviet Union has probably the largest raw
 material base of any country in the world, and a high
 degree of self-sufficiency in fuels and other energy
 resources. It is especially rich in metallic minerals,
 such as iron, manganese, copper, zinc, and lead, and
 in the energy fuels-oil, gas, and coal. It is impossible
 even to estimate accurately the extent of the mineral,
 timber,  waterpower,  and  other resources still  un-
 developed in the very sparsely settled eastern half of
 the  country.  But  the  effective  exploitation  and
 development of these potentially enormous supplies of
 natural resources are seriously hindered by the ex-
 tremely difficult climatic and terrain conditions and
 the great remoteness of most of these resources from es-
 tablished industries, transportation routes, economical
 sources of power, and areas of consumption.
 Soviet industrial development since World War II
 has been  rapid, although the rate of growth has
 declined from a peak during the early 1950's, when
 growth through reconstruction and through more in-
 tense use of existing capacity was relatively easy. As
 the economy has expanded, problems of planning
 have become more complex, and it has not been possi-
 ble to sustain the rapid growth of earlier years. By the
 early 1970's, the industrial sector accounted for slight-
 ly over one-third of the country's GNP. But from 1971
 through 1973, industry's rate of growth averaged less
 than 6% per year, rather than the rate of 8% planned
 for the 1971-75 period.
 The Soviet GNP was an estimated $658 billion in
 1973, second only to that of the United States ($1,223
 billion in 1973). The Soviet economy as a whole grew
 at about 5% annually during the preceding 10-year
 period, compared with 4% for the United States, but
 well behind the 10%-11% growth rate recorded by
 Japan. The Soviet Union's performance was uneven,
 with  the weather and other variables that affect
 agriculture determining the overall economic results in
 any given year to a degree not found in other in-
 dustrialized countries. Moreover, annual increments
 in output in the early 1970's have fallen off substan-
 tially from those registered in the 1960's.
 The Soviet population of 251.2 million at the end of
 1973 gave the country a per capita GNP of about
 $2,619 or 45% of the $5,785 of goods and services pro-
 duced per capita in the United States. The Soviet out-
 put level was also surpassed, on a per capita basis, by
 12 West European countries and Japan. Of this rela-
 tively modest per capita product, about 60% consists
 of consumption, as opposed to investment and defense;
 as a result, the average per capita expenditure on all
 consumer goods and services in the U.S.S.R. is only
 slightly over one-third that in the United States. In re-
 cent years personal savings have increased steadily to
 record levels because consumer goods are not yet
 available in the quantities and qualities desired by
 Soviet consumers.
 Financing  economic development in the Soviet
 Union is essentially a function of state financial in-
 stitutions, which channel resources in accordance with
 comprehensive economic plans. Banks exert a con-
 trolling influence over enterprise operations by han-
 dling virtually all enterprise financial transactions,
 allocating  most  capital  investment  funds,  and
 providing  short-term  credit  for  working  capital.
 Financing of major economic programs is provided for
 in the state budget, which relies on turnover taxes and
 enterprise profits as major sources of revenue. The

 largest expenditure item is generally that covering
 economic development, followed closely by the fund-
 ing of cultural and social programs. Overt expendi-
 tures on defense have been stable at 17.9 billion
 rubles in the budgets of 1970 through 1973, equal to
 roughly 10% of total budgeted expenditures. These
 sums, however, significantly understate the defense
 burden because they exclude some expenditures on
 nuclear weapons, research and development on ad-
 vanced weapons systems, and military elements of the
 space program.
 Agriculture  is  the  Achilles'  heel  of  the  Soviet
 economy.  Growing  seasons  are  short  and  water
 supplies are inadequate and undependable. Although
 the country is larger in land area than any other in the
 world, the amount of arable land in the Soviet Union
 is only slightly greater than that of the United States,
 and potential cropping areas are poorly situated for
 high yields. Commercial farming is considered virtu-
 ally impossible in 90% of the country, with some two-
 thirds of the land area rendered almost completely
 useless for agriculture by low temperatures alone.
 The most favorable agricultural area lies west of the
 Ural Mountains, where rainfall and temperatures are
 influenced by air currents from the Atlantic Ocean.
 The remainder of the country is covered by forests,
 tundra, deserts, marshes, and mountains, and may
 never be developed agriculturally. Beyond the effects
 of the environment,  the agricultural sector is also
 adversely affected by poor planning, centralized con-
 trol, insufficient equipment, and inadequate incen-
 tives to producers. Soviet agriculture is organized in
 collective and state farms, with small plots accounting
 for about 4% of the total arable area allocated to in-
 dividual farmers. These plots account for a large pro-
 portion of the vegetables, dairy products, and livestock
 produced in the country.
 The imbalance within Soviet industry in favor of
 the producer goods sector and the urge to meet quan-
 titative output goals have resulted in the production
 of excessive amounts of simple, heavy, general-purpose
 equipment  at  the  expense  of  the  sophisticated,
 specialized equipment required by~technologically ad-
 vanced industries. On the other hand, Soviet industry
 has demonstrated a high degree of sophistication in
 the production of modern weapons and carriers for the
 country's military forces and in the production of the
 hardware and precision instruments essential to the
 country's space exploration program.
 Machine-building is the largest industry in the
 U.S.S.R., but it remains inferior to comparable .in-
 dustries in developed Western countries in terms of
 technology, degree of automation, and quality of out-
 put. Consequently, the Soviets are interested in ob-
 taining through imports many items of high quality,
 often  embodying  the  most  modern  Western
 technology. Soviet accomplishments in the production
 of  sophisticated  defense  and  space equipment,
 however, demonstrate a high degree of competence in
 research and development, which could be channeled
 into civilian  use  in  a  different system  reflecting
 radically changed priorities.
 Raw and intermediate materials for the machine-
 building industry are overwhelmingly of domestic
 origin.  Production of metals has been consistently
 emphasized, and by 1973 the production of crude
 steel soared to 131.5 million tons. World leadership
 or near-leadership has been achieved in the produc-
 tion of many nonferrous metals and minerals, and
 ferro-alloying materials. As with the country's exten-
 sive deposits. of fossil fuels and hydroelectric power
 resources, most reserves of industrial raw materials are
 located east of the Urals in Siberia and the Soviet Far
 East. The country also produces significant quantities
 of rare and precious metals. It ranks second as a world
 producer of gold, and the development of uranium
 production has been intensively. pursued.
 Soviet foreign trade is conducted as a state monop-
 oly by specialized foreign trade corporations.  The
 overall volume of trade is relatively small as the
 U.S.S.R.  is  self-sufficient  in  most  industrial  raw
 materials and finished goods, and has followed a
 policy of development that relies primarily on the
 country's domestic resources. Trade is conducted ac-
 cording to centralized planning by which imports of
 goods required to meet domestic production goals are
 specified, and exports are undertaken essentially as a
 means of paying for these imports and for past credits.
 Changes in the planning are occasionally required to
 compensate  for  underfulfillment  of  production
 goals, as in 1972, when the failure in agriculture re-
 quired huge unanticipated imports of grain. Foreign
 trade is conducted largely with other Communist
 countries,  with  imports and exports more or less
 balanced annually, through bilateral agreements. In
 trade with the West, however, planned Soviet imports,
 heavily weighted with sophisticated machinery and
 equipment and modern technology, almost always ex-
 ceed exports. The U.S.S.R. has made increased use of
 Western credits to finance the resulting deficits. It
 now is also selling gold to help offset the deficits, and
 is certain to continue its search for Western, especially
 American, technology.

 Absolute  power arbitrarily exercised is common
 throughout Russia's long history. To understand the
 Soviet Union it is necessary to recognize that, Marx-
 ist-Leninist ideology notwithstanding, the Soviet state
 owes much to its Russian heritage. In many respects
 the Soviet system represents a continuation, in new
 trappings and with different jargon, of practices and
 organizational patterns rooted deeply in the Russian
 past. 1'he domination of the country by the ruthlessly
 despc)tic Tartars for two and a half centuries during
 the Middle Ages effectively prevented whatever native
 movement there might otherwise have been toward
 individual liberty and self-government and cut Russia
 off from any liberating influences from the West. The
 tsars who replaced the Tartars were entrenched in
 their own autocratic rule over Imperial Russia 200
 years before the time of the American Revolution.
 Historically, the vast majority of the Russian people
 were inclined toward blind submission to a central
 authority that they regarded as sacrosanct. There was
 an  official  religion,  the  highly dogmatic  Russian
 Orthodox faith, which gave autocracy its legitimacy
 and inculcated in the masses the virtue of conformity
 and the sacred obligation to obey the central author-
 ity. The tsar's power was limited only in the way that
 all autocratic power is limited-he was dependent
 upon subordinates to carry out his will. The broad
 scope of  state power naturally gave rise to a vast
 bureaucracy. There was an elaborate system of cen-
 sorship and police controls, and no area of life was
 secure against tsarist intervention. The state controlled
 the movement of its people through such devices as
 police  registration  papers  and  internal  passports.
 Indeed, Russians have always lived in danger of ar-
 bitrary arrest and imprisonment, and the freedoms of
 speech and press as well as other basic liberties have
 either been absent or at best only feebly exercised.
 In addition to its control of the political and even
 the spiritual life of the nation, the state has historically
 ~ been  the  principal  initiator of  economic activity.
 In' Old Russia the only capitalism that developed
 was  essentially  state  capitalism.  In  agriculture,
 state farms occupied great areas of land and com-
 manded the involuntary services of many individuals,
 including  state-owned  peasants.  Peasant  life  was
 traditionally  organized  in  communes.  The  state
 managed various industries, and even those small
 areas of the economy left to private operation were ex-
 pected to gear their activities to the military and
 economic needs of the state. Old Russia grew at the
 expense of its subjects, establishing a rigid pattern of
 absolutism  upon  which  the  Communists  could
 build-and did.
 Paradoxically,  the Russian tradition of political
 absolutism is accompanied and opposed by a noble
 humanitarian tradition, sparked and kept alive largely
 by  a  succession  of  writers  whose  libertarian
 voices-from the time of poet Alexander Pushkin to
 the present period-have not been stilled despite the
 efforts of tsarist and then Soviet secret police. Starin
 was not long in his grave before Boris Pasternak at-
 tracted world attention with a moral force reminiscent
 of Tolstoy. Then from a Stalinist labor camp came the
 voice  of  Alexander  Solzhenitsyn,  who  carried  a
 message from his prison hell as had Dostoyevsky a
 century before. And others warned that the ghost of
 Stalin could yet haunt the land.
 The small group of dissident writers who exist to-
 day have been joined by some prominent Soviet scien-
 tists in a loose collection of critics of the Kremlin.
 These critics operate partly underground and partly in
 the spotlight of international publicity. At the center
 of this harassed and unorganized group, which its
 members  sometimes  call  the  "Democratic
 Movement," is physicist Andrei Sakharov, a brilliant
 scientist often referred to as the father of the Soviet
 H-bomb. He first came into public view in 1968 with
 the publication, abroad, of his "Manifesto," a call for
 democratization  of  Soviet  society  and  for
 Soviet-American  collaboration  to  combat  global
 problems of war, overpopulation, hunger, and disease.
 Sakharov issued a second "Manifesto" in 1970 as a
 blueprint for gradually changing the Soviet Union
 from  a  Communist  dictatorship  to  an  electoral
 democracy. He formed a small public committee on
 human rights, and won the general support of the im-
 pressive circle of intellectuals who circulate their views
 in  samizdat-photocopied  or  mimeographed
 manuscripts passed from hand to hand but which
 never  have  been  formally  published  inside  the
 U.S.S.R. They include such works as Solzhenitsyn's
 explosive "Gulag  Archipelago,"  an  expose of  the
 Soviet  secret  police  and  prison  camp  apparatus,
 published in the West at the end of 1973.
 Widespread publicity in the West for these intellec-
 tual dissidents and for the Soviet Union's Jewish
 minority often tends to exaggerate both the nature
 and extent of the discontent they express. The Soviets
 do not appear to have singled out the Jews for special
 persecution; instead the Kremlin upholds the Marxist
 tenet of disapproval for all religions, and with varying
 degrees of subtlety makes it difficult for any faith to
 flourish in the Soviet state. But a number of Soviet
 Jews, emboldened by Israel's stunning defeat of Arab
 forces in the 6-day war of 1967, began agitating for
 freedom to leave the Soviet Union and migrate to

 Israel. They have' since attracted considerable atten-
 tion abroad by making common cause with the in-
 tellectual dissidents and by capitalizing on the senti-
 ment (and political weight) of sympathizers in the
 United States. But they lack the widespread support in
 the Soviet Union that they enjoy in the West. Dealing
 with  the  Jewish  minority-albeit  an  unsettling
 problem for Moscow-is more a foreign policy com-
 plication than a threat to internal security. In its
 dealings with the West, of course, the Soviets are at
 pains to maintain that such problems are strictly inter-
 nal matters that should be kept out of the inter-
 national arena. Nevertheless, Moscow has grudgingly
 allowed some emigration to Israel and has been flexi-
 ble in responding to pressures from the West on this
 issue and in defense of dissident writers. With growing
 attention  from  the  Western  press  centering  on
 Solzhenitsyn early this year, the Kremlin exiled him as
 the best means of limiting damage and getting rid of
 the policy problem of coping with outspoken criticism
 and defiant defense of his rights.
 Neither the nature of present-day intellectual dis-
 sent nor the regime's response is entirely new. Tsar
 Nicholas I, for example, had 19th century Russian
 philosopher Peter Chaadayev declared insane and
 confined to his home because of his "radical" political
 opinions. Nevertheless, there are important ways in
 which the kind of dissent being heard in the Soviet
 Union is a new phenomenon in its character and im-
 plications. For one thing, the ranks of the present-day
 dissidents are drawn in significant numbers from the
 scientific and technological community on which the
 Soviet Union is dependent for its continued com-
 petitive position as a military and industrial power.
 For another, these critics are not all bent on the
 destruction of the Soviet system. No doubt some of
 them despair-as does dissident Russian historian An-
 drei Amalrik, in his essay, "Will the U.S.S.R. Survive
 Until  1984?"-of  the  present  system's  ability  to
 reform itself. In general, however, the critics believe
 that it can be changed to correct its deficiencies. Their
 objective is for the regime to eliminate the discrepan-
 cies between theory and practice, to reduce the gulf
 between the ideals and realities of Soviet life. They are
 not directly trying to wrest political control from the
 party, but would have it permit the development of a
 more diverse, pluralistic society that would allow more
 people the means for an independent life.
 From within the U.S.S.R., Amalrik is one critic who
 has expressed doubt about the staying power of the
 Soviet system. At some future date-he picked 1984
 for symbolic reasons-he sees the system being torn
 apart by the trauma of a devastating war with China,
 from which only a truncated Soviet state survives. His
 vision is too apocalyptic to win many supporters, and
 he was condemned to a prison camp for promulgating
 it. The scientist Sakharov is perhaps more represent-
 ative of the "democrats" in his assertion that the
 country must change and that the party must set the
 process in motion. Only if the party relaxes its grip and
 abandons gray conformity, he argues, can it rein-
 vigorate Soviet intellectual, artistic, and scientific life;
 if it does not, the country cannot hope to stay abreast,
 let alone gain, an advantage, in international competi-
 tion.
 Thus, central to their criticism is the Communist
 Party's virtual monopoly of power and its influence on
 almost every aspect of life in the Soviet Union. The
 dissidents also object to the very nature of the party
 and  question  the  ideological  base  by  which  it
 rationalizes its rule. They consider parasitic the ruling
 Communist  bureaucracy,  contending  that  its
 members come into their privileged positions neither
 by merit nor any other rational criterion of advance-
 ment. Instead, they see the party advancing its own.
 In the critics' eyes, it exploits society in its own interest
 and is dedicated above all not to the welfare of the
 people  nor  to  intellectual  growth  nor  even  to
 economic development, but to the consolidation and
 expansion of its own power.
 Finally, critics question the viability and relevance
 to an increasingly complex and industrialized society
 of a dictatorial party that dominates and interferes in
 virtually everything in the name of Marxist-Leninist
 ideology. Nor is it only some intellectuals who are dis-
 illusioned. Large segments of the Soviet population
 display no enthusiasm for the dogmatic materialism of
 Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy. Young people are bored
 by it. They are more interested in those phenomena of
 Western youth which have been imported across their
 frontiers-the dress, the talk, the dances, the music
 and, to a small but increasing extent, the drug culture.
 They are restless and alienated.
 The  party  is  concerned  about  this  growing
 ideological void, but has had little success in trying to
 fill it. One upshot has been to give grudging approval
 to an increasingly popular revival of interest in the
 Russian  past.  In  recent  years  this  interest  has
 developed into a kind of movement encompassing a
 variety of scholarly, popular, and faddish efforts to
 rediscover the past and elucidate the essence of the
 "Russian soul." It has become a favorite pastime to
 search for icons and other examples of folk art and
 handicraft.  Organizations  have  been  formed  to

 preserve historical and cultural monuments, and ex-
 peditions scour the Russian countryside for old books
 and manuscripts.
 1'he historical movement, if indeed that is what this
 line of popular thinking can be called, has resulted in
 a new Russian chauvinism. It is not revolutionary but
 conservative, seeking to preserve old values and restore
 old traditions. It is espoused largely, but not exclusive-
 ly, by youth, and participation is centered in the
 relatively well educated urban population. It is helped
 along  by  a  growing  disenchantment  with  the
 dehumanizing effects of  industrialization, and the
 pollution and exploitation of irreplaceable resources
 that it brings. Poets, who have folk-hero popularity in
 tl~e U.S.S.R., speak of the contrast between asphalt
 and  birch  trees,  clearly preferring the latter,  and
 despair of the pollution of Lake  Baykal and the
 destruction of ancient churches, as well as other ex-
 amples of historical architecture, to make way for
 government hotels and housing projects. All of this has
 spawned a Soviet parallel to the ecology movement in

 the   United  States-similar  in  sentiment,  and  in-
 creasingly in organization and impact on government
 policy.
 The regime tries to construe these sentiments as
 patriotic in motivation and generally constructive in
 nature, and evidently is able to accept them as such.
 This acceptance may be based on the assumption that
 such sentiments are better than no sentiment at all.
 But even if these interests should grow with the party's
 blessing, it is doubtful that they would breathe new
 life  into  the  system  or  inspire  devotion  to  its
 ideological  and  organizational  underpinnings.  If
 anything, such sentiments represent a kind of escape
 from general alienation or an outlet for feelings of dis-
 content. Although they are not as pointed, articulate,
 or dramatic as the views the dissidents put forward,
 they also constitute a questioning of the relevance of
 the Soviet system in its present mold.
 There are outside observers who believe that the
 Soviet system is not inert, and that the future holds the
 prospect of a more pluralistic, dynamic society with a

 broadened decisionmaking base. Some expect the ad-
 vance of technology to help bring that about by mak-
 ing it necessary for an increasing number of functional
 specialists and innovators to come into positions of
 leadership and influence. Others see a new kind of
 politics emerging, a participatory bureaucracy with
 information, advice, recommendations, complaints,
 etc., flowing not only from the top down, but upward
 as well. Still other observers cite forces at work in
 Soviet  society  that  tend  to  undermine  the
 authoritarian features of the system; one such force is
 the rising educational level of the party leadership.
 Some say the fact that many of the system's critics
 come from the same stratum of Soviet society as the
 ruling  elite will  tend  to make it  less likely that
 criticism will be ruthlessly suppressed.
 Dissent in the Soviet context can be considered a
 natural step in an inevitable chain of events. On the
 one hand is contemporary Soviet society, now at a
 rather  high  level  of  development,  modernizing,
 maturing, and growing more complex and diversified.
 On the other hand is the essentially defensive role of
 the  highly  centralized  party  bureaucracy,  which
 developed primarily as a device for control and only
 secondarily as an instrument for the management of
 modernization. The Soviet formula fit the society into
 which it was introduced several decades ago, but there
 is a real question  now whether control has since
 become the end rather than the means. The crux of
 the issue is change-the ability of the Soviet system to
 respond and adapt.
 Perhaps if years continue to pass with no essential
 change in the atmosphere inside the Soviet Union, in-
 creasingly numerous elements of that vast country will
 accumulate just causes for grievance and will generate
 mounting  pressures  for change.  Sometime  in  the
 future  the  moment  may  arrive  when  the  sterile
 bureaucracy of the gray Soviet state will no longer be
 able to cope with the disparate contentions of dis-
 satisfied intellectuals, disaffected youth, discontented
 consumers,  disillusioned  workers,  and  a  multi-
 national, multisocial populace. The collapse of the
 Soviet  system,  barring  the  massive  trauma  of  a
 protracted war such as Amalrik suggests, seems as un-
 likely in the foreseeable future, however, as does the
 emergence of an open, democratic society along U.S.
 or West European fines.
 The best hope for change in the U.S.S.R. may be the
 younger members of the Soviet intelligentsia, some of
 whom feel that it is not the system as such which is un-
 / \         responsive, but its present aged and rigid leadership.
 According to this view, those who joined the party
 after Stalin's death cannot be as authoritarian in
 outlook as the present generation of leaders who rose
 to  prominence  during  the  purges  of  the  1930's.
 Although now obliged to mimic the slogans of their
 superiors, today's younger party leaders, untainted by
 Stalinism, are expected by many to be much more
 receptive to new ideas and open to change after taking
 over the reins later in this decade and in the 1980's.
 Although that kind of optimism may not be entirely
 unfounded, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
 continues to promote through its narrow ranks only
 those whose attitudes it considers acceptable. It has
 governed in a relatively stable style, and seems likely
 to continue doing so. It  is  also significant in this
 respect to  note  that the  U.S.S.R.  is,  after all,  a
 remarkably stable society. During an era when many
 would-be revolutions have turned out to be rather
 ephemeral, the Soviet state and party have survived a
 bloody civil war, a coercive transformation of the
 countryside costing millions of lives, Stalin's terrorism,
 and the devastation and loss of additional millions of
 lives during World War II. Few governmental systems
 can boast such staying power.
 In addition, the average party functionary has a
 real stake in preserving the Soviet system. The vast
 party apparatus lives by the status quo, and within it
 there is intense sentiment for holding on to what one
 has, to resisting change because it may mean a loss of
 status, privilege, or perquisites. Moreover, the prevail-
 ing political environment links the governing elite and
 the masses more closely together than it links the
 critics to either. The pattern of rule that developed un-
 der Stalin was in accord with the legacy of Tsarist
 Russia and the current situation continues to fit this
 pattern. The Soviet masses even today do not on the
 whole  demand  freedom  and  representative  in-
 stitutions, which to them remain abstract and un-
 familiar concepts. Their day-to-day demands for food,
 housing, and consumer goods are modest and are be-
 ing met, even though slowly and with occasional set-
 backs. By their own standards, which of course are the
 only ones that really matter, they have never had it so
 good. As for the critics whose names are now widely
 known in the West, many Soviet citizens have never
 heard of them. The reaction of those who have general-
 ly ranges from incomprehension to hostility. Critics
 and  the  dissent  they  express  may  be  a  natural
 phenomenon of Soviet society at this stage of its
 development, but equally natural is the failure of the
 critics to strike a responsive chord among the masses,
 whose conservative mentality is similar in many im-
 portant ways to that of the party functionaries who
 govern in their name.

 ~u~o~c~o~ ~~~ ~~~ ~o~'
 For some  years  following  the  ouster of Nikita
 Khrushchev in October 1964, Soviet foreign policy
 was marked by uncertainty, defensiveness, and consid-
 erable immobility. Pressing internal problems-espe-
 cially economic concerns-took precedence for Mos-
 cow's new decisionmakers. Then too, such interna-
 tional developments as the 1967 Middle East war,
 the Czechoslovak crisis, and the steady increase in
 Sino-Soviet tensions kept the Kremlin off balance and
 served to delay agreement on a broad and coherent
 new foreign policy line. Finally, at least at the begin-
 ning of their tenure, the new leaders faced U.S. stra-
 tegic power markedly superior to their own.
 By the end of the 1960's, however, the Soviets had
 acquired confidence in their capacity to engage their
 foreign adversaries on favorable terms, and in the
 prospects for increasing their international influence,
 to adopt a more assertive and innovative approach to
 fcireign affairs. Attainment of rough parity with the
 United States in strategic weapons was the key con-
 sideration underlying this change of mood in the
 Kremlin, but there were other important contributing
 factors as well. For example, Moscow was encouraged
 by the internal and international difficulties then be-
 ing encountered by the United States over Vietnam
 and by the cracks that had appeared in the NATO
 alliance. Despite the storm of protest it had evoked,
 the invasion of Czechoslovakia (and its subsequent
 justification on the basis of the Brezhnev Doctrine of
 Soviet "duty" to "protect socialist gains'') strength-
 ened the U.S.S.R.'s position in Eastern Europe without
 serious long-term damage to Soviet interests elsewhere.
 Meanwhile, the Kremlin had succeeded in substan-
 tially improving its military and political position
 vis-a-vis Peking. The simmering crisis in the Middle
 East, while still a cause for concern, had yielded some
 notable gains for the Soviets in that area. On the home
 front, the economy had picked up and was performing
 at a pace sufficient to support the large military es-
 tablishment,  foreign  aid  programs,  and  prestige-
 building space spectaculars needed to achieve both
 the appearance and substance of genuine superpower
 status.
 The emergence of Leonid Brezhnev as the leading
 figure in the Politburo also had a good deal to do with
 the changes that became noticeable in the Kremlin's
 international behavior during 1969. While high-level
 decisionmaking  remained  a  collective  process,
 Brezhnev's increasing influence strengthened those in
 the leadership who calculated that the Soviet Union's
 long-term interests could best be served by a marked
 reduction  in  East-West  tensions.  This  course,  in-
 volving diplomatic overtures from the United States
 and from West Germany, was a bold one for the
 Soviet Union to set, for it risked generating new fer-
 ment in Eastern Europe and further undermining the
 U.S.S.R.'s revolutionary credentials throughout the
 world. It also left its advocates vulnerable to charges
 of ideological deviation and of failure to take full ad-
 vantage of their country's growing power.
 Of necessity, then,  Brezhnev's "peace offensive"
 .vas  from the outset a complex affair-a changing
 blend of accommodation and old-fashioned power
 politics, of cold pragmatism and ideological revival,

 Declassified in Part -Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/04/11 :CIA-RDP08S01350R000602010005-4
 and of confidence and caution. For example, the early
 moves which  helped bring about such significant
 developments as the Moscow-Bonn Treaty, the Berlin
 accords, the strategic arms limitations talks (SALT)
 and  agreements,  the Conference on  Security and
 Cooperation in Europe, and the Mutual Balanced
 Force Reduction talks were accompanied by further
 efforts  to strengthen  Soviet hegemony in Eastern
 Europe, an ideological crackdown at home, an in-
 crease in the delivery of weapons and other forms of
 assistance to the Arabs and North Vietnamese, and the
 dispatch of the first Soviet naval squadron to visit
 Cuba  since  the  missile  crisis  of  1962.  Similarly,
 Moscow's  self-serving  but  outwardly  peaceful
 proposal for the establishment of a collective security
 arrangement  in  Asia  was  launched  against  a
 background of unabashed sabre rattling designed to
 intimidate  the  Chinese  and  bring  them  to  the
 negotiating table. Moreover, the initiatives were ac-
 companied by the emergence of a broad range of new
 Soviet strategic weapons programs.
 While at first overshadowed by other moves in
 Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, efforts to improve
 bilateral relations with the United States gradually
 emerged as the key element in Moscow's new global
 strategy. Important Soviet objectives in reaching a
 limited accommodation with the United States have
 included reducing the development of U.S. strategic
 weapons programs rivalled by its own, reducing the
 chance that Russia and the United States might be
 drawn into war as the result of regional conflicts in-
 volving their client states, and checking the move-
 ment of China and the United States toward rap-
 prochement. Also, the Soviets have tended to view
 some measure of cooperation with the United States as
 conducive to the process of negotiation in Europe,
 from which they hope to achieve stabilization of their
 sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, the gains in
 trade and technology needed to push them into the
 front ranks of the advanced industrial states, and,
 eventually, greater influence in Western Europe.
 The Soviets were, of course, correct in concluding
 that the West vas also ready for detente. All told; the
 easing of East-West tensions in Europe and the lower
 temperature and broader scope of Soviet-American
 relations  since  1968  have  been  rather  dramatic
 developments.  And there  is  no question but that
 Moscow's shift in favor of detentist policies has indeed
 yielded it some tangible benefits. The Soviets' sym-
 pathetic  response  to  West  German  Chancellor
 Brandt's  conciliatory  Ostpolitik-and  their
 willingness to apply pressure to bring East Germany
 along-has paid off in widespread de jure recognition
 for their key client state and ally. Similarly, Soviet
 overtures to the West, including persistent efforts to
 organize a broad European security conference, have
 nurtured differences within NATO and have moved
 the Soviets close to their objective of securing formal
 Western acceptance of the political and territorial
 status quo in Central and Eastern Europe. At the same
 time, the summit meetings of 1972 and 1973, several
 sizable trade agreements, and numerous major end
 minor diplomatic accords which have highlighted the
 evolution of U.S.-Soviet relations in recent years have
 brought  Moscow  increased  international  prestige,
 recognition as the military equal of the United States,
 and the possibility of large-scale Western economic
 cooperation and assistance.
 But  detente  has  brought  the  U.S.S.R.  certain
 problems as well. Revolutionary rhetoric about con-
 tinuing  and  intensifying  the  ideological  struggle
 between communism and capitalism notwithstand-
 ing, the Brezhnev regime's growing stake in its policy
 of detente with the West has affected its behavior and
 complicated its position in many parts of the world.
 In Eastern Europe-an area of vital national con-
 cern to the Soviet Union-Moscow is unhappy about
 Romania's wayward (and Western-applauded) course
 in foreign policy and is worried lest the dynamics of
 detente incline others toward independent action.
 Although the Soviets probably could not resort to
 harsh corrective measures without compromising their
 own overtures to the West, if it came to a choice
 between erosion of their position in Eastern Europe
 and  detente  in  Europe,  they would  undoubtedly
 choose to let detente suffer.

 The issue is unlikely to be joined in the near future,
 however,  for Moscow has been demonstrating  in-
 creased deftness in dealing with its problems in the
 area. This has been evident in its flexible response, for
 instance, to leadership shuffles in Poland, Hungarian
 political and economic reforms, and Yugoslavia's con-
 tinued  apostasy.  To  be.  sure,  Romanian  Prime
 Minister Ceausescu's maverick behavior in the inter-
 national arena (particularly his flirtation with China)
 has from time to time brought threats of dire retribu-
 tion down upon his head. But most East European
 Communist  parties  now  enjoy  substantial
 organizational  independence  and-within  the
 "socialist limits" so dramatically reasserted by the in-
 vasion  of  Czechoslovakia  in  August  1968-con-
 siderable freedom to formulate domestic policies. For
 the  time  being  at  least,  the  Soviets seem  to be
 reasonably comfortable with a new generation of East
 European leaders who, while inclined to accord first
 loyalty to their own countries or their own brand of
 communism, are still generally willing to defer to
 Soviet sensitivities.
 Another essential  facet of Soviet foreign policy
 which has both affected and been affected by move-
 ment toward East-West detente is the problem of
 China. Indeed, a major reason for the Russians' deci-
 sion to seek a marked improvement in their relations
 evith the United States was their anxiety about the
 growing threat they perceived from Peking. Moscow's
 fears have been manifested most dramatically in the
 massive buildup of Soviet forces along the forbidding
 frontier with China, but are equally evident in the
 Kremlin's  uneasiness  about  the  possibility  that
 a  Sino-American  alliance  against  Moscow  might
 materialize. Yet the Kremlin's current emphasis on
 negotiated  settlement of disputes and the unique
 nature  of  the  triangular  relationship  which  has
 developed  between  the Soviet Union,  the United
 States, and China have affected Soviet behavior in
 Asia and have made it harder for the Soviets to
 strengthen their position in some of the smaller coun-
 tries-both Communist and non-Communist-lying
 on or near China's borders.
 If, for example, the Kremlin ever seriously con-
 sidered amilitary solution to the Sino-Soviet conflict,
 the idea must now appear even less attractive than it
 did originally. And such bows to U.S. sensitivities as
 Moscow's relatively balanced pronouncements on the
 need to halt cease-fire violations in South Vietnam
 have done nothing to help the Soviets in their com-
 petition with China for influence in North Vietnam
 and North Korea. At the same time, the overall aura
 of detente (including Peking's more friendly posture)
 has prompted many non-Communist Asian nations to
 seek a more even balance in their relations with the
 United States, China, and the U.S.S.R. and to exhibit
 a notable lack of enthusiasm for the Asian collective
 security system proposed by the Soviets in 1969. Even
 outside Asia-in Warsaw Pact councils and broader
 Communist forums-Moscow seems to have more
 and more difficulty lining up support for political,
 economic, and ideological attacks on Peking.

 In keeping with their increased confidence and
 their growing capability to project their power into
 distant areas, the Soviets have met the ever more com-
 plex challenges to their position in Asia and elsewhere
 in the Third World with a new activism in bilateral
 diplomacy and a new willingness to accept deeper in-
 volvement  in  regional  affairs.  The  treaties  of
 friendship they signed with Egypt, India, and Iraq
 anti the speed with which they moved to establish
 themselves in Bangladesh in the wake of the In-
 do-Pakistani war are cases in point. But while more
 energetic and no less opportunistic than in the past,
 the Kremlin's approach to the Third World as a whole
 is now somewhat more sober and more regionally
 differentiated. Retention, consolidation, and if possi-
 ble, expansion of the U.S.S.R.'s position in the Middle
 East and South Asia are regarded as priority objec-
 tives. On the other hand, sub-Saharan Africa and
 Latin America (except Cuba, of course) are considered
 to  be  areas  of peripheral  interest where political
 and economic risk should be held to a minimum.
 So far the Brezhnev regime seems undeterred by the
 difficulties  it  has encountered in pursuing its new
 global strategy. There are sensitive arenas of potential
 Soviet-U.S.  conflict,  such as the  Middle East,  in
 which events can put the new strategy to the test. But
 in  1973 the Soviet-American detente survived and
 helped curtail another round of war between the
 Arabs and Israel, a burst of hostilities from which
 Moscow seemed to gain more than it lost. The Soviets
 acquiesced in helping transform the combat begun by
 their Arab clients into an uneasy truce-one which
 saw  Moscow's  Middle East ties strengthened and
 America's energy crisis sharpened.
 The long-term benefits of detente still are more
 potential than real for the Soviets, but the Kremlin has
 a major stake in maintaining its American connection
 and an accommodation with the West. The detente
 that tends to be looked on in the West and elsewhere
 as an end in itself, as a goal worth achieving for its
 own sake, represents to Moscow the means for realiz-
 ing its hopes to contain China, disrupt the Western
 military  alliance,  and  close  the  East-West
 technological gap.  With these objectives in mind,
 Moscow  is  now  more  willing  to  negotiate  with
 Washington and other Western capitals on the basis of
 traditional concepts of national interest It is more
 able to do so, too; the Soviets' more sophisticated ap-
 proach to foreign relations reflects the new confidence
 born of their sense of political and military parity with
 the United States. Soviet readiness to take this tack
 also is related to the enduring quarrel with China,
 which has confronted the Soviet Union with a new
 and major enemy, and demonstrated to the Kremlin
 that a shared ideology is an insufficient basis for a
 lasting alliance.
 In foreign policy goals as in so much of Soviet socie-
 ty, there is continuity as well as change. There is
 evidence that the Kremlin intends detente to be a
 long-term feature of Soviet foreign policy. One can ex-
 pect the Kremlin to keep intact, however, the en-
 during cornerstones of that policy,  which include
 maximizing Soviet power and influence in relation to
 its rivals, maintaining a buffer zone of dependent Com-
 munist states in Eastern Europe, and shielding its own
 people  from  Western  individualist  thought  and
 culture.  Whether and to what extent detente con-
 tinues to be a determining factor in Soviet foreign
 policy decisions depends, of course, on the interaction
 of many variables. Crucial among these will be the
 U.S.S.R.'s internal evolution, as well as Moscow's ap-
 praisal of Washington's intentions and its assessment
 of  developments in the triangular relationship  in-
 volving the United States, China, and itself.
