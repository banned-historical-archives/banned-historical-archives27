 Efforts to use science and technology to serve the needs of China's "four
 modernizations" program have been constrained by a shortage of qualified
 personnel, ineffective management, and the continued inability to translate
 research findings into production results efficiently. Some of these prob-
 lems derive from the continued aftereffects of the Cultural Revolution on
 Chinese research and educational institutions. Generally, however, most of
 the problems are caused by shortcomings within the institutional structure
 for formulating and implementing S&T policies. Although substantial
 progress has been made in remedying a variety of deficiencies, we believe
 that China's attainment of its modernization goals will be substantially
 delayed, primarily by limitations in manufacturing technology and modern
 control, has resulted in a patchwork pattern of technology.
 In the materials and electronics industries, for example, sophisticated
 products can be developed within the laboratory or produced on a prototype
 basis, but the Chinese have been unable consistently to integrate R&D
 advances into serial production. Lack of quality control and industrial
 standardization are also major obstacles; erratic standards and inconsistent
 quality continue to reduce the compatibility and reliability of communica-
 tions equipment and computers. Where large-scale, high-volume produc-
 tion is not a main objective, as in China's space program, the major
 weakness is a poor understanding of systems management concepts and
 techniques. In the telecommunications network, excessive dependence on
 local initiative and self-reliance, instead of centralized coordination and
 selected areas
 China's leaders, aware of these problems and that modernization must be
 more gradual than originally anticipated, have greatly restructured the
 modernization program. Development of technologies for light industry,
 agriculture, and energy will be given priority. This change in approach and
 several successful cases of indigenous S&T development lead us to
 conclude that the system is potentially capable of functioning effectively
 and of supporting the revised needs of the modernization program in
 Initial plans for upgrading domestic S&T capabilities and reforming the
 S&T system were to be achieved by decentralizing decisionmaking and
 increasing the autonomy of the operating unit. Some of these reforms have
 been postponed by the imperatives of economic readjustment. Various
 centralized controls have been reasserted in selected areas to ensure that

 research activities make a more direct contribution to the modernization
 program. The initial goal of modernizing all domestic S&T capabilities has
 given way to increased emphasis on applied R&D. Budgets for basic
 research programs-such as high-energy physics-have been cut so that
 the limited financial resources can be given to production-related activities.
 Scientists have been given a greater role in S&T policymaking to reduce in-
 efficiency and to ensure that modernization projects meet acceptable
 scientific criteria. During the Cultural Revolution, people were placed in
 key S&T positions on the basis of their political credentials rather than
 their technical qualifications. Problems still exist in trying to replace these
 personnel with more competent individuals. Efforts have also been made to
 place younger, well-qualified people in positions of authority within
 educational and research organizations.
 Large numbers of students and researchers have been sent overseas for
 advanced training, while domestic educational programs are being
 strengthened. Despite some success in improving personnel allocation and
 training, however, the dearth of qualified technicians and scientists in
 China probably will continue to be a serious constraint on the moderniza-
 tion drive well into the 1990s
 A variety of economic and financial factors also will have a major impact
 on the modernization pro ram particularly with respect to the importation
 of foreign technology.
 While China's top leaders have
 shown more willingness to rely on foreign technologies to support moderni-
 zation, the acquisition of foreign technology and equipment has not, in
 many cases, produced the desired results. Emphasis has been shifted,
 therefore, from purchasing whole plants and equipment to renovating and
 rehabilitating existing enterprises. A greater effort will be made to secure
 technologies more appropriate to China's large labor force and inadequate
 energy output. Technology imports once again will be closely reviewed by
 the central economic authorities to ensure a better match between foreign
 purchases, local needs, and resource availabilities.

 A shortage of foreign exchange also will continue to restrict China's ability
 to import foreign technology, particularly since the Chinese remain
 reluctant to incur high levels of foreign debt, except at concessionary rates.
 Initially, China had hoped to finance much of its technology imports
 through expansion of petroleum exports. This has not proven feasible in
 view of the continued technical constraints inhibiting rapid expansion of
 petroleum production. In addition, modernization has led to increased
 energy consumption in China, further reducing the availability of petrole-
 um for export.
 Finally politics promise to continue to influence in the modernization
 program. Because policy was reversed frequently in the past, many S&T
 personnel are skeptical about becoming fully committed to the new
 policies, and political concerns have made many scientists reluctant to take
 the initiative to start new projects or introduce major technical innovations.
 Many of the country's leaders remain concerned about the long-term
 cultural and political impact of foreign ideas and technology on Chinese so-
 ciety. In any case, the success of the modernization program in general,
 and the modernization of science and technology in particular, will depend
 upon the maintenance of a political consensus supporting the primacy of
 the economic objective. Even if China can remedy its technical deficien-
 cies, the effort to advance S&T capabilities in areas relevant to moderniza-
 tion will fall significantly short of its goals without political stability.

 China's "Four Modernizations" Program
 Since the mid-1970s, China has been engaged in a
 major modernization program designed to enhance
 national security while promoting long-term self-
 reliance. The roots of the program, known as the
 "four modernizations," date back to former Premier
 Zhou Enlai's 1975 address to the Fourth National
 People's Congress. The program gained full momen-
 tum in late 1976 after the death of Communist Party
 Chairman Mao Zedong and the arrest of the radical
 Gang of Four.
 Program objectives, as stated by the Chinese, were to
 upgrade agriculture, industry, national defense, and
 science-including technology capabilities-to ad-
 vanced world levels by the year 2000. In February
 1978, a set of modernization goals were spelled out
 that included construction of 120 large-scale indus-
 trial projects and ambitious production targets for
 steel and agriculture. Recognizing the backwardness
 of their industrial and S&T base, the Chinese showed
 a greater willingness to import foreign technologies
 and to engage in international commerce. Reform of
 the existing system of management in industry, edu-
 cation, and research was also stated as a primary goal.
 Without such a comprehensive modernization pro-
 gram, its supporters argued, China would remain
 weak and vulnerable.
 Initiation of the growth-oriented modernization pro-
 gram revealed that the Maoist approach of giving
 primacy to political values had been relegated to
 secondary importance. Generally speaking, policies in
 effect during the Maoist era had greater social equity
 as their primary goal. This emphasis on egalitarian-
 ism implied acceptance of a slower growth rate for the
 national economy in the hope of alleviating three
 major areas of inequality in Chinese society: the
 urban versus rural sectors, industry versus agricul-
 ture, and intellectual versus manual labor. In con-
 trast, the "four modernizations" program was an
 attempt to speed up economic development to improve
 more rapidly the people's livelihood and to strengthen
 national economic, defense, and technological capa-
 bilities.
 By early 1979 Chinese leaders realized that their
 initial goals for modernization were overly ambitious,
 that the details for implementing the program had
 been obscure, and that the priorities for allocating
 scarce financial and technical resources were loosely
 defined, at best. Although China had begun extensive
 purchases of foreign technology and equipment in        25X1
 1978, economic limitations and a lack of qualified
 technical personnel soon impinged upon the country's
 ability to acquire and to absorb imported technology
 for its modernization program. Other bottlenecks,
 such as an underdeveloped and poorly distributed
 transportation system, insufficient energy supplies,
 and a lack of coordination among relevant organiza-
 tions also helped to slow the pace of modernization.
 The Chinese leaders' recognition of these problems-
 a necessary step in any attempt to develop appropriate
 solutions-led to formulation and implementation of a
 readjustment program in early 1979. In this program,
 the Chinese leadership gave increased emphasis to
 agriculture and light industry and scaled down many
 of the goals and projects in the original modernization
 plan.
 The full extent of China's problems, however, became
 apparent during late 1980. Efforts to readjust the
 modernization program were meeting only limited
 success, and the imperatives of readjustment were
 clearly in conflict with ongoing efforts in economic
 reform. In particular, the Chinese leadership recog-
 nized that economic readjustment required increased
 control by the central political authorities to ensure
 adherence to new policies and guidelines; economic
 reforms, which were aimed at decentralizing eco-
 nomic decisionmaking and management to stimulate
 local initiative, had resulted in deviations from the
 goals of readjustment. Domestic problems including a
 growing budget deficit and rising inflation were

 among several factors that forced cancellation or
 postponement of several major development projects,
 including the highly touted Baoshan steel mill and the
 Dexing copper mine. Severe limitations were placed
 upon future capital construction, and work on several
 large petrochemicals projects was suspended indefi-
 nitely as the result of economic cutbacks and inade-
 quate supplies of feedstocks and raw materials to run
 the plants.
 By the end of 1980, the momentum and optimism
 characterizing the modernization program at its in-
 ception had been lost. As the result of a party work
 conference in December 1980, China's top leaders
 codified their readjustment program and continued
 the long process of realigning their priorities. The
 leadership began to scale down their goals still further
 to better reflect financial, personnel, and resources
 limitations. Efforts to ensure adherence to the various
 elements of the readjustment program continued
 throughout the first half of 1981.
 Modernization of Science and Technology
 Throughout the course of the modernization program,
 science and technology have continued to be high-
 priority items as far as the investment of financial and
 personnel resources is concerned. Closing the technol-
 ogy gap between China and the West and overcoming
 the obstacles to greater technological self-reliance are
 the two dominant goals underlying current S&T
 policy. The Chinese consider S&T modernization to
 be a necessary prerequisite to the successful comple-
 tion of the three other areas covered by the "four
 modernizations" movement: agriculture, industry,
 and national defense.
 In March 1978 the Chinese announced a comprehen-
 sive national S&T plan. This provided the basic
 blueprint for the S&T modernization, and delineated
 eight areas where S&T efforts were to be concen-
 trated: agriculture, energy, materials, electronics, la-
 sers, space, high-energy physics, and genetic engineer-
 ing. Some fields were chosen because they had the
 potential to contribute to the modernization program,
 others because key S&T leaders desired to use basic
 research as a means to reintegrate Chinese scientists
 into the world's scientific community.
 The decision to undertake such a comprehensive S&T
 modernization program must be viewed within the
 context of lingering effects of the Cultural Revolution
 on the Chinese scientific community and educational
 institutions. The Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s
 was a political movement in China, designed to
 promote radical egalitarian Maoist goals. It had a
 devastating effect on scientific research and training
 in China: both virtually ceased for almost 10 years.
 Although the direct impact of the Cultural Revolution
 varied considerably from one institute to another-
 depending on the protection afforded by the political
 leadership and the visibility of the institute and its
 members-most were disrupted to some extent.
 Scientists were ridiculed for their "elitist" attitudes.
 Foreign-trained Chinese scientists were suspected of
 treason; many were sent to work in factories or on
 farms. Some scientists committed suicide or were
 physically abused. China's scientific community was
 isolated from the research of other countries. More-
 over, Chinese scientists were prevented from continu-
 ing their own research in China.
 The radicalism of the Cultural Revolution and the
 Gang of Four reinforced the tendency of both Chinese
 S&T institutes and individual scientists to remain
 isolated from each other; scientists were instructed to
 learn from peasants and workers rather than from
 each other. As the last vestiges of the Cultural
 Revolution were removed from the Chinese political
 scene, lack of communication remained a major ob-
 stacle to S&T modernization.
 The Cultural Revolution had a less evident but per-
 haps more pervasive influence on the attitudes of the
 Chinese population, in general, and the intellectuals,
 in particular. Since then, many S&T personnel have
 taken a very cautious approach toward the current
 changes in priorities. A large number have been
 reluctant to become fully committed to new projects
 and policies. This has created a sluggishness in re-
 search and production, because many scientists have
 been unwilling to take the necessary initiative to
 launch new projects or to accept the responsibility for
 overseeing those already in existence.

 Secret
 The scientific stagnation left China's S&T capabili-
 ties 10 to 20 years behind advanced, modern levels. To
 revitalize their S&T system and to stimulate scientific
 advancement, Chinese leaders decided to send large
 numbers of graduate students and scientists abroad
 for advanced technical training. Chinese universities
 reintroduced scientific curricula. Scientific personnel
 were given increased responsibilities in economic or-
 ganizations, as well as those for research and develop-
 ment. Chinese leaders encouraged the acquisition of
 foreign technology as a means of remedying S&T
 deficiencies. By foregoing the more gradual approach
 of developing technologies indigenously, the leaders
 believed that foreign technology and training could
 become the foundation for closing the S&T gap
 between China and the advanced nations by the year
 2000.
 Revision of China's basic modernization plan in 1979,
 however, forced the leadership to reassess its S&T
 modernization strategy. As a result, Chinese leaders
 gave increased attention to areas with near-term
 practical applications. They issued a revised list of
 priority areas: agriculture, energy, materials, commu-
 nications, electronics, and space. In most cases, the
 selected areas constituted critical bottlenecks in the
 modernization program. More importantly, the Chin-
 ese leaders began to recognize that advanced S&T
 alone were not the solution to China's problems.
 Other more fundamental stumblingblocks stood in the
 way of both economic and S&T modernization, in-
 cluding managerial, attitudinal, organizational, and
 financial problems.
 By the beginning of 1981, the imperatives of economic
 readjustment resulted in further changes in China's
 S&T strategy-the foremost being the postponement
 and in some cases, the cancellation of several major
 development projects involving large inputs of foreign
 technology and technical assistance. Above all, eco-
 nomic and financial considerations forced the Chinese
 to become more selective in their technology acquisi-
 tion. The emphasis on purchasing whole plants and
 equipment that formerly was characteristic of the
 initial phase of S&T modernization has been altered.
 Today, greater emphasis is being given to the renova-
 tion of existing plants and equipment. Current policy
 is to purchase from abroad only those technologies the
 Chinese cannot develop quickly enough themselves
 and only the technologies they can rapidly absorb.
 China's top economic administrators have given
 instructions that all available versions of technology    25X1
 must be thoroughly investigated before a purchase
 will be approved. Particular emphasis will be given to
 technologies applicable to agriculture, light industry,
 and energy, as well as technologies characterized by
 high labor intensity and low energy consumption. r
 The Chinese leadership has again altered research
 priorities and policies. The original goal of moderniz-
 ing the complete spectrum of China's S&T institu-
 tions now reflects even greater emphasis on applied      25X1
 research. Most S&T projects must produce economic
 benefits and must make tangible contributions to the
 modernization program. Technological choices are to
 be based upon local needs and capabilities, rather
 than upon purchasing the most up-to-date technol-
 ogies. These new policies are designed to further
 reduce waste of material and financial resources, a
 problem since the outset of the modernization pro-
 gram.
 Although the S&T modernization program has faced
 cutbacks, the cutbacks are less severe than in other
 parts of the readjustment program and reflect greater
 emphasis on applied research. The decision in early
 1981 to postpone indefinitely a major project on high-
 energy physics confirms this new policy orientation
 away from basic research.
 Politics, Modernization, and S&T Policy
 sisting efforts to disengage politics from science
 Despite the spectacular reversals in various policy
 areas since the death of Mao, both the party and state
 bureaucracy apparently are not easily malleable.
 Some S&T administrators-many of whom rose to
 positions of authority during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion-have a vested interest in maintaining their
 positions. Large numbers of such individuals are still
 in place. These well-established bureaucrats are re-

 As a result, foot-dragging and incompetence continue
 to plague Chinese attempts to remold the S&T sys-
 tem. Realizing these problems, the Chinese leadership
 is attempting at both the national and local levels to
 replace and retrain officials who fail to support
 wholeheartedly Deng's modernization program. Deng
 and his supporters probably will succeed in overcom-
 ing this opposition. Some progress has already been
 made in replacing these individuals as evidenced in
 the recent elections held at the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences in May-June 1981. Extensive reforms, how-
 ever, will be slow and eventually may impinge ad-
 versely upon China's ability to modernize S&T.F_
 The extent to which the country should import foreign
 technologies continues to be the subject of an ongoing
 political debate in China. Some officials fear that
 overreliance on foreign technology will seriously dis-
 rupt Chinese society, adding stresses to the political
 system and increasing dependence-real or per-
 ceived-upon other countries for training, and for
 technical and financial assistance. In particular, these
 people are concerned over debasement of Chinese
 capabilities by those who have developed an admira-
 tion for Western scientific and technological progress.
 How much of the Chinese "essence" the leadership
 can safely sacrifice to accommodate the imperatives
 of obtaining desperately needed foreign technology
 and managerial and organizational assistance will be
 a focal point of political debate in the 1980s. We
 believe the Chinese will continue to encounter diffi-
 culties in arriving at a technologically appropriate and
 politically acceptable balance between self-reliance,
 selective borrowing, and outright dependency.
 China has been contemplating the issue of how to
 utilize Western technology for over 100 years. Find-
 ing a workable solution to this question has become
 politically imperative. Throughout 1979-81, the Chin-
 ese press published numerous articles defending the
 import of foreign technologies and the use of foreign
 advisers during the 19th century, implying that there
 is still some opposition to similar programs today.
 These articles also have stressed that China must be
 more selective in its efforts to acquire foreign technol-
 ogy. Similar concern exists about the long-term ef-
 fects of foreign ideas from movies, advertising, and
 books upon China's social order. If opposition to such
 "social pollution" grows, participation by foreigners
 or introduction of foreign technology into the moder-
 nization program will become increasingly difficult.
 Some observers also have commented that the "rush"
 to modernize S&T in China in the late 1970s has led
 to additional political problems and pressures. The
 case of the Baoshan steel mill, a large-scale capital
 construction project involving West German, Japa-
 nese, and US participation, is illustrative. In Septem-
 ber 1979, a high-ranking Chinese official admitted
 that although the Baoshan project was ill-conceived, it
 continued to receive support from the leadership,
 because it had been set up as a premier part of the
 modernization program. A number of technical mis-
 takes resulted in wasting large amounts of foreign
 exchange. The site of the Baoshan project was unsuit-
 able from an engineering standpoint. In addition,
 large ore carriers cannot berth nearby, making it
 difficult to supply the mill with needed raw materials.
 Although considerable expense might have been saved
 by reassigning technicians from the Anshan steel
 complex to build the plant, regional political rivalries
 between North and South, and Shanghai's desire for a
 more modern plant than Anshan-and not technical
 feasibility-led to the decision to undertake the proj-
 ect. In late 1980-because of the large costs, the
 imperatives of modernization readjustment, and con-
 tinued political criticism-China was forced to post-
 pone construction plans for phase two of the project
 and has suspended almost all work in phase one.
 Although the Chinese have reiterated their intention
 to proceed with phase one, final completion will be
 substantially delayed until the technical problems can
 be sorted out. A few Chinese leaders have placed part
 of the blame for the project's problems on Japan,
 claiming that the Japanese gave China unsound ad-
 vice regarding the feasibility of the Baoshan mill.
 Political pressures stemming from the rush to mod-
 ernize also caused key decisionmakers striving to
 attain production objectives to forgo safety measures
 and proper maintenance procedures. As in the past,
 the Chinese have tended to neglect such consider-
 ations. Between 1975 and 1980 the Chinese press
 reported about 1,000 accidents associated with the

 Secret
 operations of the Oceanic Petroleum Exploration Bu-
 reau. One widely publicized incident-among several
 recently in the Chinese press-occurred on 25 No-
 vember 1979, when the Bohai Number 2 oil rig
 collapsed and 72 lives were lost. The media recently
 acknowledged that the Bohai team leader had submit-
 ted three separate warnings to the Ministry of Petro-
 leum concerning the safety of the rig. Apparently,
 because of the pressures to continue and to complete
 the operation, the Ministry-already under fire for its
 poor handling of China's petroleum development-
 ignored these warnings. On 26 August 1980, the
 Minister of Petroleum Industry, Song Zhenming, was
 replaced because of the Bohai accident.
 Economic factors-primarily a shortage of investment
 capital and foreign exchange, as well as inflation-
 constitute serious constraints on Chinese S&T devel-
 opment. A major problem plaguing the modernization
 program since its inception has been that the Chinese
 have attempted to do too much too fast. Major budget
 deficits have resulted. Political and economic leaders
 apparently did not perceive the actual costs of the
 program.
 Because the Chinese initially had hoped to finance a
 large portion of their modernization program through
 the rapid expansion of petroleum exports, offshore
 petroleum development was given a high priority. By
 late 1980, however, it appeared that exploitation of
 both onshore and offshore areas would be much more
 gradual than originally anticipated and that expan-
 sion of oil exports would be limited at least until 1985.
 The increasing energy requirements of the moderniza-
 tion program further reduced the likelihood that
 China would be able to rely on petroleum exports to
 finance the purchase of foreign technology.
 To remedy financial shortfalls, the Chinese recently
 have shown a greater willingness to borrow needed
 funds from abroad, although only at concessionary
 rates. In early 1980, China and Japan signed a major
 loan agreement to help finance the construction of six
 major projects related to energy development. The
 Chinese have been offered additional loans and
 credits for projects from several countries, although
 they have yet to take advantage of these offers. China
 has joined the World Bank and the International
 Monetary Fund, and has secured development-related
 assistance from both organizations. The Chinese hope
 to use World Bank assistance to upgrade the domestic
 education system and to finance additional hydro-
 power development projects. International Monetary
 Fund assistance has been used to help manage the
 country's balance-of-payments problems. The Chinese
 also have held discussions with the United States
 regarding financing from the Export-Import Bank,       25X1
 and in May 1981 signed two agreements, a memoran-
 dum of understanding on financing procedures and a
 loan agreement.
 The Chinese have promulgated a new foreign invest-
 ment law to help alleviate some of their financial
 problems by promoting joint ventures (equity and
 nonequity) between foreign firms and the Chinese
 Government. A structure to promote compensation
 agreements, whereby a foreign partner receives a
 portion of the output in return for bringing technology
 and equipment to China, also has been developed.
 Because of considerations such as political stability,    25X1
 economic performance, and the overall vagueness of
 the legal and financial aspects of Chinese law, many
 foreign investors have been reluctant to undertake
 projects. Domestically, the rapid expansion of equity-
 based joint ventures has been the target of some
 opposition, thus further delaying the expansion of
 these ventures. In the future, the framework of joint
 ventures, however, may be the only viable means for
 China to secure foreign technology and to finance
 badly needed projects.
 In the final analysis, the Chinese leadership still
 remains apprehensive about expanding greatly the       25X1
 extent of their external debt. A major factor behind
 Chinese thinking has been the country's experiences
 with the Soviet Union in the 1950s and the Western
 nations in the early 1970s, which were criticized for
 both economic and political reasons. Thus, the
 Chinese remain concerned about the potential costs of
 becoming overly dependent on external sources for
 financing modernization.

 Major questions of economic priorities have in-
 fluenced the course of S&T modernization. Policy
 disputes revolving around the issue of greater decen-
 tralization of decisionmaking, for example, have
 served to leave the lines of authority only vaguely
 defined. In many cases, the Chinese bureaucracy has
 been unable to formulate clearly stated policies. Even
 when policies have been announced, the bureaucracy
 has lacked the capabilities and authority to implement
 them. Economic decisions and foreign technology
 purchases have been made without adequately consid-
 ering the availability of critical inputs and resources.
 The current program of economic readjustment has
 been designed to remedy some of these problems. For
 example, all large foreign technology purchases will
 be more closely scrutinized; strict controls have been
 placed on the allocation of foreign exchange to avoid
 purchases without the approval of the control authori-
 ties. Financial scarcity and bureaucratic obstacles,
 however, will continue to slow significantly the pace
 of the entire modernization effort.
 The Manpower Requirements of S&T Modernization
 A shortage of qualified technical personnel is another
 major constraint. As a result of the political turmoil
 created by the Cultural Revolution, China's major
 educational institutions were closed, and most of the
 facilities that trained young people in fields such as
 engineering and natural science were shut down for
 almost 10 years. In 1978, China's State Science and
 Technology Commission (SSTC) conducted a nation-
 wide survey to obtain statistics on the number and
 qualifications of technical and scientific personnel.
 This survey revealed that an inadequate number of
 qualified personnel is China's most serious problem.
 Among S&T personnel who have had high-quality
 formal training in China or overseas, many are old
 and incapable of exercising a' direct role in the day-to-
 day operations of active research laboratories. These
 inadequacies have created a serious strain on China's
 S&T personnel resources, because the Chinese have
 yet to develop a successful strategy for the effective
 and efficient use of their limited number of qualified
 personnel.
 China's S&T community can be divided into four
 basic groups or "generations," with varying degrees of
 expertise and training. The first group is comprised of
 personnel who were trained in Western universities
 and returned to China at the time of the Communist
 takeover. With an average age over 60, these people
 are steadily decreasing in number.
 The second group includes personnel trained in China
 or the Soviet Union during the 1950s and early 1960s.
 These people, who are in their forties and fifties, have
 had very specialized training and remain conditioned
 to working in a Soviet-style work environment-one
 in which a worker is given little incentive to pursue
 innovative ideas and projects. Because they have had
 some technical training, however, the majority of the
 students and scholars selected for the initial overseas
 study program in the late 1970s came from this group.
 Most of the third group are technical personnel and
 political workers appointed to S&T jobs immediately
 after the Cultural Revolution. This group includes the
 first people to receive formal education after the
 interruptions of the Cultural Revolution. Although a
 sizable number now hold positions in Chinese re-
 search institutions, members of the group lack the
 background and technical training to spearhead the
 sustained modernization program planned by the
 Chinese leadership. Many obtained their positions or
 entered higher education only by virtue of their
 political credentials.
 The fourth group is comprised of people being trained
 within rehabilitated Chinese universities. Some even-
 tually will be sent overseas for advanced training,
 once they complete their undergraduate training in
 China. This group constitutes the country's main hope
 for meeting the technical demands of the moderniza-
 tion program. In 1981 Chinese universities will grad-
 uate the first class to have entered higher education
 after the fall of the Gang of Four. Although the
 quality of university students has begun to improve, it
 is still too early to evaluate their full technical
 competence.

 Secret
 The Chinese education system must be greatly im-
 proved and expanded before it can produce an ade-
 quate number of qualified persons to fill key positions
 in research organizations and institutions of higher
 education. A major question still to be resolved is
 whether the existing well-trained cadre should be used
 in a teaching or research capacity or should be sent
 overseas for advanced education. Until this issue is
 settled and more competent teachers can be trained,
 the goal of effecting an almost threefold increase in
 the number of scientists-to 800,000 by 1985-which
 was announced in the 1978 S&T modernization plan,
 appears impossible to achieve. Currently, only 3 per-
 cent of all high school graduates (approximately
 270,000 in 1980) can receive higher education, an
 inadequate number in view of China's pressing needs
 for qualified scientists and technicians. Any inability
 to alleviate the current shortage of qualified S&T
 personnel will affect detrimentally the pace of China's
 modernization program.
 Extensive efforts have been made to move younger
 persons into positions of authority within both re-
 search and education institutions. For example, dur-
 ing the May 1981 meeting of the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences, younger scientists were elected to key
 decisionmaking offices to ease the transition to a new
 Academy of Sciences leadership in the future. Bottle-
 necks in replacement of older or less qualified persons
 in the S&T system, however, are still prevalent.
 Promotion on seniority only is very common. These
 problems-unless quickly rectified-also will reduce
 the likelihood of China's meeting its modernization
 goals by the year 2000.
 the-art technologies but also an adequate S&T infra-
 structure and pool of qualified S&T personnel to fully
 utilize existing resources and to effectively assimilate
 foreign technology. This is true in both the civilian
 and military sectors. The major constraints on S&T
 modernization in each area result from ineffective
 management, a continued inability to clearly define
 priorities, and a lack of institutionalized channels to
 effectively translate research findings into actual pro-
 duction results. Current Chinese efforts to remedy
 these problems have led to isolated examples of
 research and development successes, but as a whole,
 the system remains caught in a web of bureaucratic
 inertia. During the past few years, China has ex-
 panded its understanding of the country's primary
 S&T-related deficiencies. In addition, the Chinese
 also have increased their knowledge of the interna-
 tional technology market and alternative technology
 suppliers. These efforts, however, will have little
 impact on the modernization program until existing
 constraints-technical and organizational-can be
 overcome.
 Agriculture
 China's basic goal in agricultural modernization is to
 increase the country's food supply so that its growing
 population can be fed. Chinese agricultural moderni-
 zation is aimed at improved crop varieties, plant
 protection, fertilizer and agricultural chemicals, irri-
 gation and water management, farming methods and
 management, and mechanization. Advances in most
 of these areas have contributed to increased Chinese
 agricultural production during the past 10 years, but
 the Chinese recognize that achieving modernization
 goals will require still further improvements in agri-
 culture, including the adoption of foreign technology.
 This section of the paper will focus on six key fields in
 which S&T modernization has been actively pursued.
 In many respects, Chinese successes and problems are
 representative of the situation in other fields. Each
 area is analyzed from the perspective of development
 priorities established by the Chinese leadership.
 The major point emerging from this analysis is that
 the key to the Chinese S&T modernization drive lies
 not merely in acquisition or development of state-of-
 Considerable disagreement has existed as to whether
 priority should be placed on biological or mechaniza-
 tion technology. Some leading Chinese experts hold
 that scientific research on improved plant varieties,
 fertilizers, and pesticides, as well as improved irriga-
 tion, should be emphasized first, with mechanization
 a longer term goal. The scientists point out that
 emphasis on multiple-cropping requires planting early
 maturing varieties and using more organic and chemi-
 cal fertilizers for the two or three crops per year.

 Approved For Release 2007/08/08: CIA-RDP83B00551 R000200150005-7
 Other experts favor giving priority to mechanization
 of agricultural processes (cultivating, intertilling, har-
 vesting, drying, storage, weeding, and application of
 fertilizers and pesticides, with less emphasis on agri-
 cultural research and chemicals). These scientists note
 that multiple-cropping requires more frequent plant-
 ing and harvesting, which could be done more effi-
 ciently by machines. They also cite as the benefits of
 mechanization-timeliness of farm operations, quick
 turnaround time in multiple-cropping, reduced grain
 losses through machine harvesting and drying, and
 reduction of draft animal population (thereby increas-
 ing meat production).
 That unemployment would be a major drawback to
 extensive farm mechanization, however, is commonly
 recognized in China. Unemployment is already a
 major problem that no one wants to exacerbate.
 According to present Chinese thinking, increased
 mechanization will be considered only for planting
 and harvesting; other operations will continue to be
 done by hand.
 That mechanization cannot be effective without in-
 creased yields also is recognized. Larger yields re-
 quire, in turn, improved crop varieties, extensive
 application of fertilizer, and water availability. The
 Chinese are beginning to adopt features of Japanese
 agricultural modernization, which began with in-
 creased use of chemical fertilizers and high-yielding
 varieties of seed, as well as improved irrigation. The
 Japanese developed and used mechanized equipment,
 specially tailored to Japan's agricultural endowments.
 Recently, Japan has provided China with agricultural
 chemicals, farm machinery, and other agricultural
 inputs. Numerous science and technology exchanges
 between the two countries have facilitated Chinese
 understanding of the pitfalls of expanding the scope of
 mechanization too rapidly.
 Areas of particular interest to the Chinese are plant
 breeding for crop resistance, crop physiology research,
 and experimental design and analysis of research.
 Because more scientists qualified in these areas are
 drastically needed, China is exchanging scientists and
 training Chinese students under agricultural S&T
 agreements with the United States and other coun-
 tries. With the recently increased emphasis on agri-
 culture, even more scientists and students will be sent
 abroad for training.
 At the national level, the Chinese are pursuing the
 acquisition of germ plasm as genetic sources of dis-
 ease- and pest-resistance for major crops and as a
 means to broaden the available genetic base of Chi-
 nese plant breeding. This research is being done in the
 Beijing research institute for crop germ plasm under
 the Academy of Agriculture and Forestry. The Chi-
 nese learned the value of germ plasm when they
 developed hybrid rice varieties, largely at the Hunan
 rice research institute, using restorer lines of high-
 yielding semidwarf varieties developed in the Philip-
 pines. These areas of research-as well as biological
 fixation of nitrogen and enhancement of photosyn-
 thetic efficiency-must be further developed as a
 foundation for all agricultural research and are being
 pursued by Chinese scholars taking advanced training
 in the United States.
 China's purchases of foreign agricultural machinery
 can be expected to increase as agricultural moderniza-
 tion plans are implemented. Equipment purchases,
 however, will be constrained by unemployment con-
 siderations and by China's small plots and terraced
 fields that restrict the amounts and types of equip-
 ment that can be useful. Only on large plains-as in
 northeast China-can the Chinese apply the large-
 scale mechanized farming methods of the West.
 In their farm tests of specialized US equipment for
 subsoiling, agricultural chemical application, mecha-
 nized seed production, and grain drying, the Chinese
 already have found that using such equipment in-
 creases yields. They also have discovered that irriga-
 tion technology-using pumps, metering equipment,
 and center-pivot sprinklers-is valuable because it
 saves substantial amounts of not only water but also
 the land that would be occupied by surface irrigation
 systems.
 The Chinese want to expand sprinkler irrigation. For
 now, however, they are holding up large purchases of
 this and other types of farm equipment while they
 ascertain the merit of investing scarce foreign ex-
 change. Similarly, they are refraining from purchas-
 ing foreign agricultural chemicals and production
 technologies to minimize dependence on foreign
 sources and to strengthen domestic production and
 research capabilities.

 Secret
 Energy Production and Transmission
 China's severe shortage of electric power is a major
 obstacle to modernization. Without power, new fac-
 tories cannot start up and existing factories cannot
 supplement to the energy needs in industrial regions
 that lack coal or hydropower, because nuclear power
 plants can be sited where needed
 operate on a irregular schedule.
 The Chinese estimate that 20 to 30 percent of their
 existing industrial capacity cannot be utilized because
 of power shortages. These are caused by poor plan-
 ning and outmoded technologies in every aspect of
 power generation-from location and development of
 primary energy sources, through energy utilization in
 power stations, to the transmission of electricity.
 Operation of the Wuhan steel mill in Hebei has been
 adversely affected by such problems. Despite their
 ambitious plans for the mill, the Chinese discovered
 that the electricity in Hebei was insufficient to oper-
 ate the plant at projected capacity
 Very much aware of the importance of energy, the
 Chinese have given energy development plans top
 priority. They intend to rely on coal as the main
 source of energy, because they know they have vast
 supplies. In 1980 approximately 71 percent of China's
 energy was produced from coal. The Chinese also plan
 to tap their hydropower resources-the largest in the
 world. But because the major rivers are located in
 southwest China-a long distance from Chinese in-
 dustrial areas-the Chinese will require high-voltage
 transmission technology, which they do not yet have.
 Originally, the Chinese regarded oil as a source of
 foreign exchange to help pay for modernization proj-
 ects, but this potential became uncertain as the
 Chinese realized that they would require much more
 petroleum themselves. (Petroleum accounted for 25
 percent of China's energy in 1980.) Moreover, the
 Chinese do not know the actual extent of their
 resources and cannot expect to substantially increase
 oil production before 1985. Inadequate exploration
 and exploitation technologies will continue to be a
 major constraint.
 As a result, the Chinese have given nuclear power
 greater importance in their long-term energy plans.
 They realize that nuclear energy could be a good
 The complexities involved in developing a nationwide
 energy system make it difficult to judge when the
 Chinese will have enough power to meet their
 modernization needs. These needs and the plans to
 meet them are changing as the Chinese adjust their
 overall economic goals and timetables.
 The Chinese proposals to develop energy resources are
 becoming more and more realistic as planners get
 farther along-realize their past mistakes and antici-
 pate future problems, and modify the plans accord-
 ingly. The success of this massive task depends not
 only upon assimilating the tremendous number of
 technologies directly involved in locating, extracting,    25X1
 and processing energy resources, but also upon devel-
 oping the industrial infrastructure to produce the
 machinery needed in these processes-machinery
 such as mining equipment, drill bits, and turbines.
 Also needed are important supporting elements, such
 as railroads to transport coal to power stations.
 Historically, China has underestimated its needs in
 developing railroad lines to support energy-related
 transportation requirements.
 As in other areas of modernization, the Chinese do       I
 not want merely to buy equipment from abroad.
 Rather, they prefer to learn how to produce the       25X1
 equipment themselves. This requires a large cadre of
 skilled engineers and technicians, which China does
 not have. To meet this deficiency, the Chinese are
 sending scores of people overseas as students to
 Western universities and as delegations to visit all
 kinds of energy facilities in an attempt to learn
 modern technologies.
 If China can maintain an even political keel and
 continue its present emphasis on energy development,
 we estimate that the modernization plans, the supply
 of technical manpower, and the industries themselves
 will begin to crystallize and will become coordinated
 by 1985. Another five years probably will be needed,
 however, to show concrete results in increased energy
 supplies.

 Coal. Increasing the quantity and quality of coal
 production has been made even more essential by
 China's continued reliance on coal as the major
 domestic source of energy. The Chinese plan-where
 possible-to convert their boilers from oil to coal. To
 meet the resulting increased demands for coal, the
 Chinese need to increase mechanization of their coal-
 mining processes, including higher capacity and more
 efficient extraction, loading, processing, and hauling
 systems. At present, only 30 percent of China's coal
 comes from fully mechanized operations.
 The Chinese should have little difficulty in adapting
 to the use of modern, high-speed machinery, because
 they have experience in mechanized, underground
 mining methods. They may encounter difficulty, how-
 ever, in designing underground and open-pit surface
 mines because they are not experienced in designing
 for high-capacity operations. In order to design mines
 capable of using modern equipment efficiently, the
 Chinese will need to improve their drilling and seismic
 programs so that they can delineate precisely the size
 and shape of deposits for accurate mine layouts
 The Chinese are limited in their capacity to purchase
 modern mining machinery abroad because of a short-
 age of foreign exchange and their desire to avoid
 excessive dependence on foreign sources. China's ulti-
 mate goal is to manufacture its own modern mining
 equipment. This, however, will present a vast array of
 problems in industrial technology and infrastructure,
 involving machine design, metallurgy, hydraulics, and
 quality control.
 To meet the demand for better quality, the Chinese
 need to process more coal. At present, only 10 to 15
 percent of their total production is processed; this coal
 is exported or is used in steel manufacturing. To
 replace existing methods, China needs modern, high-
 capacity crushing, sizing, and washing equipment,
 and the flotation technologies upon which this high-
 capacity equipment is based
 The most vital problem facing China in obtaining
 energy from coal is transportation of the coal itself.
 China's railroads cannot move the coal to power
 plants as fast as it is mined. As a result, the Chinese
 lack sufficient electricity to run their electrified
 To speed development of its coal industry, China
 negotiated agreements in 1978 and 1979 with West
 Germany, France, Great Britain, Japan, Yugoslavia,
 Romania, and Poland. The Sino-Japanese agreement
 for coal development is of particular interest, because
 it includes financing for technology purchases and
 technical assistance. The Chinese also purchased a
 wide variety of mining and processing equipment from
 the United States and other countries-apparently to
 survey the variety of coal technologies and equipment
 available and to determine what is most suitable for
 their purposes.
 The Chinese have sent numerous delegations to study
 coal equipment and technologies in foreign countries.
 Hoping to make sales, these countries have welcomed
 the Chinese and have reciprocated with coal delega-
 tions to China. In general, the exchanges have pro-
 duced few concrete sales, but the Chinese undoubt-
 edly have benefited from their exposure to modern
 mining equipment and technologies.
 The Chinese now are caught up in readjusting their
 economic priorities and allocations of precious foreign
 exchange and in determining what kinds of contract
 conditions would be most beneficial. They have invit-
 ed several countries to submit proposals for joint
 ventures, but inasmuch as China has not set definite
 conditions for these ventures, foreign countries are
 refraining from definite commitments
 Oil. China's modernization program will create de-
 mands for increased oil production, not only for
 domestic needs as energy, lubricants, and feedstocks
 that will increase as the country becomes more indus-
 trialized but also as a source of foreign exchange to
 help pay for modernization. At this point, however,
 China is having to reduce its oil exports, because its
 oil production has leveled off, and its own require-
 ments have increased.
 The Chinese have done well up to now in locating and
 extracting oil with the equipment and technologies
 they possess, but it has been "easy" oil. The Chinese

 Secret
 A major Chinese deficiency is outmoded seismic
 technology that does not provide resolution of suffi-
 cient clarity to locate subtle, complex, oil-bearing
 structures. Further, Chinese seismic data are often
 poorly processed, making accurate analysis difficult.
 As a result, China is in desperate need of higher speed
 computers to process the tremendous volume of seis-
 mic data being collected. Another problem is that
 geophysical data often are not correlated with geologi-
 cal data. As a result, many wells are drilled in poorly
 selected locations, resulting in substantial misalloca-
 tions of limited financial and technical resources.
 Most recently, however, many of these problems have
 been at least partially alleviated by the technical
 assistance and data processing provided by foreign
 firms working both in offshore and inshore areas.
 As with many industries in China, an unevenness in
 technical sophistication exists from place to place.
 This probably reflects the scarcity of equipment and,
 more importantly, the shortage of skilled technical
 personnel; both are distributed unevenly and spread
 too thin. The resulting disparities are exacerbated by
 a lack of communication among various oilfields and
 the Chinese reluctance to deviate from procedures
 that have been successful in one place but may be
 unsuitable under different geological conditions.F_
 Drilling rates are slow because the Chinese lack in-
 depth expertise. For example, they seem not to realize
 the value of using drilling mud, which is needed to
 lubricate drill bits and to flush cuttings from drill
 holes. If the Chinese have mud equipment, they often
 do not connect it or they operate it improperly.
 Further, their drilling mud techniques are sometimes
 so poor as to be almost ineffective.
 In-depth expertise also is lacking in China's methods
 of high-pressure drilling control. If the Chinese have
 blowout preventers, they often do not install the
 equipment. They seem not to realize the value of the
 preventers-that blowouts decrease reservoir pres-
 sures and cause delays. In some instances of abnor-
 mally long drilling times, where underpowered rigs set
 up a succession of inefficiencies in the use of drilling
 tools and hoisting systems, the Chinese lacked the
 technical knowledge to identify the source of the
 problems. Relatedly, because the Chinese lack tung-
 sten carbide technology, Chinese-made drill bits wear
 out quickly, necessitating frequent, time-consuming
 replacement.
 Initially, the Chinese limited their requests for foreign
 assistance to exploration techniques for offshore
 areas. Recently, however, they expanded their aid
 requests to include onshore areas as well. US, Japa-
 nese, French, British, and Dutch companies are con-
 ducting seismic surveys off the Chinese coast at their
 own expense, hoping to be invited to develop what
 they find. In May 1981 the Japan-China Oil Develop-
 ment Corporation made a significant oil discovery in
 the Bohai Gulf. The company hopes to begin commer-
 cial production by 1986. French and US companies
 are conducting onshore seismic surveys in far western
 China to delineate more precisely the known oil
 deposits. The Chinese also have requested French
 assistance in processing some Chinese seismic data
 and have explored the possibility of obtaining US
 computers.
 The Chinese are attempting to acquire foreign oil-
 extraction technologies. After two years of negotia-
 tions, the Chinese signed a contract in mid-1980 that
 will give them the US design and manufacturing
 technology they need to produce high-quality drill
 bits. We have some evidence, however, that this
 contract was canceled when all foreign exchange
 commitments were reviewed as part of the overall
 economic readjustment program. If so, the Chinese
 decision shows that despite its priority, energy is also
 subject to close, budget-cutting scrutiny
 Through exchanges of oil delegations and invitations
 to Western oil companies to conduct symposia in
 China, the Chinese are trying to learn how to improve
 extraction techniques. The Chinese have asked some
 foreign oil companies to submit proposals on how
 China could improve extraction' processes-this may
 be only another step in eliciting free advice, or it may
 be the basis for signing assistance contracts.

 over the past 10 years, poor management, and out-
 moded equipment. The Chinese have the basic tech-
 nologies to manufacture their 1950s-vintage generat-
 ing and transmission equipment, but they cannot
 produce enough. They also need modern technologies
 for equipment to generate and to transmit the higher
 voltages required by the expanded industry projected
 under their modernization plan and by the longer
 transmission distances from remote hydropower
 sources.
 The Chinese need to make advances in power generat-
 ing equipment. They have designed and manufactured
 boilers with capacities up to 200 megawatts (MW)
 and 300 MW, but they need advanced circulation,
 welding, and refractory technologies if they are to
 manufacture the 500-MW and 600-MW boilers to
 produce more electricity. They can mass-produce 200-
 MW steam generators, but not the necessary 300-
 MW generators. Chinese delegations studying foreign
 power "systems have expressed interest in US and
 West European steam turbine technology. They have
 discussed purchasing one or two coal-fired power
 plants to serve as prototypes. These projects would be
 joint ventures or would be placed under licensing
 agreements to give the Chinese the capability to build
 their own plants.
 In developing hydroelectric power, a major problem
 for the Chinese has been geologic site surveys of dam
 foundations. Samples taken to determine quality of
 the foundation rocks are often fragmented, because
 the Chinese-made drill bits are inferior, and the
 Chinese generally are weak in rock mechanics. Their
 lab tests and analyses of rock samples sometimes
 produce faulty interpretations, leading to problems in
 dam design and tunnel construction.
 The active hydropower development agreements
 signed with the United States and Japan call for on-
 site studies and training of Chinese personnel; rock
 mechanics have been singled out as an area of
 particular interest. Chinese delegations have surveyed
 French, West German, Swedish, US, and Japanese
 technologies and equipment. Industry representatives
 from these countries have gone to China to present
 sales demonstrations of their equipment. Before their
 concern over foreign exchange caused them to halt
 foreign contracts, the Chinese-still uncertain about
 what technology they wanted-were trying to negoti-
 ate contracts for Chinese manufacture of equipment.
 To cope with the expanded industry of their moderni-
 zation program, the Chinese will need at least 500-
 kilovolt (kV) systems for power transmission. The
 Chinese do not have the technologies, however, for
 systems higher than 300 kV, although they have been
 seeking foreign assistance to develop these capabili-
 ties. Their major power grids are 200 kV; they
 manufacture their own 220-kV transformers,. circuit
 breakers, insulators, switch gear, and other equip-
 The Chinese have one 330-kV line in operation, and
 they have produced 330-kV transformers. But their
 technical capability to mass-produce transmission
 lines at this voltage and tie them into the Chinese
 power grid appears stretched to the limit.
 Nevertheless, the Chinese are working on 500-kV
 systems and have successfully trial-produced their
 first 500-kV transformer, representing a new level of
 technology in China. Construction has begun on a
 500-kV line in northeast China. Much of the neces-
 sary equipment will have to be imported because
 Chinese technology lags in such areas as sulfur-
 fluoride gaseous insulation, arc-interrupters, circuit
 breakers, and lightning arresters for 500-kV systems.
 The Chinese have signed contracts with France and
 Sweden for suitable equipment and technology. Chi-
 nese delegations also have expressed interest in US
 and Japanese equipment, but they want contracts for
 complete manufacturing technology rather than just
 purchase of the items.
 Through delegations abroad, the Chinese are acquir-
 ing vast amounts of information on power transmis-
 sion-and they are learning fast. Because of the
 desperate shortage of trained personnel, however,
 China will require five to 10 years to diffuse the
 information to all concerned and to train enough
 people to design, produce, and use the quantities of
 equipment required to meet modernization goals.

 Secret
 Nuclear Power. The Chinese are beginning to realize
 that nuclear power could supplement the energy needs
 of industrial areas lacking adequate coal and hydro-
 power resources. In some areas, coal deposits within
 reasonable distances of existing industrial power grids
 are insufficient for projected thermal power require-
 ments. As noted, transportation systems would not be
 able to deliver the necessary quantities of coal, there-
 fore, without extensive expansion. Hydropower re-
 sources that could be developed without displacing
 vast numbers of people and covering valuable agricul-
 tural lands lie mainly in the remote southwest. Their
 location thus presents problems of long-distance,
 high-voltage power transmission. The Chinese have
 concluded that nuclear power could provide a solution
 to these problems, because nuclear plants can be sited
 near industry, and transportation of nuclear fuel
 would not impose a burden on the transportation
 system.
 Probably as a result of this realization, China re-
 sumed negotiations with France in October 1980 for
 the purchase of two large pressurized-water power
 reactors. (These negotiations had been terminated in
 mid-1979.) Since 1980 provincial authorities in
 Guangdong Province have been discussing with Hong
 Kong power authorities a joint project to construct a
 nuclear power plant in Guangdong that would supply
 electric power to both Hong Kong and Guangdong.
 The project would provide training and experience to
 the Chinese. Indications are that the French reactors
 will be used. The Chinese claim they would prefer to
 buy nuclear equipment and technology from the
 United States, but they do not want to be subjected to
 safeguard inspections. (France apparently is less con-
 cerned with imposing strict monitoring and inspection
 procedures.) If the Chinese go ahead immediately
 with the Guangdong project, the power station cannot
 become operational until the late 1980s.
 China has not made a firm decision to purchase
 foreign reactors. Quite probably, such a decision has
 been delayed, because it is tied to reappraisals of the
 large, expensive projects during the economic read-
 justment.
 Like other countries contemplating nuclear power,
 China has stirred controversy and bureaucratic power
 struggles in its recent steps toward nuclear power.
 Some Chinese scientists are concerned over safety
 aspects, some economists think nuclear power is too
 costly, and some bureaucrats are concerned about
 foreign interference from safeguard inspections and a
 possible increased dependence upon foreign technol-
 ogy. The ministries of coal, petroleum, and electric
 power-to preserve their own interests-have
 emerged as opponents of the nuclear projects advo-
 cated by a pronuclear group, composed of the Second
 Ministry of Machine Building (nuclear matters) and
 the Guangdong Province electric power bureau, as
 well as elements of the CAS. Because of the dire need
 for energy in China, we anticipate that the pronuclear
 group will prevail. Any test of force, however, appears
 to have been postponed by economic readjustment
 One of the most serious technical problems the Chi-
 nese face in any attempt to develop a viable nuclear
 power program is obtaining a reliable source of
 enriched uranium fuel. (Although unlikely, the Chi-
 nese could purchase or develop CANDU-type reac-
 tors, which use natural uranium fuel.) Without pur-
 chase or development of a nuclear fuel cycle package
 that includes uranium enrichment capacity, the Chi-
 nese would be forced to sign long-term contracts with
 foreign suppliers for most, if not all, of the enriched
 uranium fuel they need. China does not have suffi-
 cient enrichment capacity to support a substantial
 nuclear power program without reducing its military
 weapons programs. Indications are that China might
 rely initially on foreign-supplied enriched uranium
 but would expand its own enrichment capabilities as
 soon as possible to eliminate its foreign dependence.
 To develop a domestic nuclear power industry, China
 will have to rely on appreciable quantities of imported
 technology and adaptation of skills and expertise
 acquired through its nuclear weapons program. Such
 a transfer could save a significant amount of time and
 resources. Chinese officials have stated that they have
 already shifted several thousand technical personnel
 from their nuclear weapons programs to their nuclear
 power program.
 But technology specifically related to power reac-
 tors-such as design and component manufacturing,
 as well as special fuel fabrication, materials testing,
 and instrumentation-would have to be developed.

 From what is known of their research for developing
 their own nuclear power reactors, the Chinese appar-
 ently tend to favor a pressurized-water technology.
 Although some groups are investigating CANDU-
 type heavy water reactors and high-temperature, gas-
 cooled reactors, the emphasis to date has been on
 pressurized-water technology. This tendency is sub-
 stantiated by the greater Chinese interest in pressur-
 ized-water types when evaluating foreign reactors.
 Also, the known Chinese naval propulsion systems use
 pressurized water.
 Chinese research on
 power reactors ranges from five to 20 years behind the
 United States, depending on the area of research. We
 believe that China will not develop a commercial
 nuclear-power reactor for at least 10 years. Research
 has been carried out on fuel-cycle calculations, fuel
 assemblies, irradiation of fuels and materials, and
 core designs for pressurized-water reactors. But we do
 not know how complete this research has been. The
 Chinese acknowledge problems with fabricating reac-
 tor pressure vessels and with welding cladding materi-
 als, as well as with the technology for primary coolant
 pumps.
 The Chinese have the technical capacity to develop
 power reactors, but they have a pronounced lack of
 nuclear technicians as a result of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion. They also lack skilled craftsmen, such as
 welders, electricians, and pipefitters. And they are
 equally deficient in the large, rolling mills needed for
 making pressure vessels, heat-exchange equipment,
 and large steam generators. Whether selected pur-
 chases of foreign equipment and technology, plus the
 expertise gathered from technicians and delegations
 sent abroad to absorb foreign technology, can close
 this 20-year gap in 10 years remains to be seen.
 needs.
 If the Chinese see a need to go full speed ahead on
 nuclear weapons development, their nuclear power
 program will experience some disruption, because the
 required technical personnel are the same for both
 efforts. The likelihood and extent of such a disruption
 are dependent upon China's willingness to push for-
 ward with both programs simultaneously. Indications
 are, however, that development of nuclear power is
 subordinate to the continued development of strategic
 weapons. Such a disruption is probable, therefore,
 because the Chinese have said adamantly that nuclear
 weapons development comes before domestic power
 Energy Conservation
 Fully aware of their severe energy problems, the
 Chinese recently have introduced numerous measures
 and incentives to promote energy conservation within
 their industrial sector. In December 1980, Premier
 Zhao Zhiyang admitted that energy shortfalls have
 caused Chinese industry to run at only 70 percent
 capacity. Through the public media, including a
 variety of national and local campaigns, Chinese
 energy officials have encouraged the adoption of more
 efficient energy use. Conservation plans for 1980-81
 call for saving 23 million tons of coal, 3 million tons of
 gasoline and diesel fuel, 1.5 million tons of fuel oil and
 coke, and 7 million megawatts of electricity. Special-
 energy commissions have been set up in Guangdong
 and Shanghai to implement policies of energy conser-
 vation. In view of the existing shortage of funds and
 the restrictions on large-scale capital construction,
 localities are being encouraged to exploit more fully
 alternative sources of energy, such as biogas, geother-
 mal sources, and wood fuel. Budgets for research into
 conservation-related technologies have been in-
 creased. China's ability to meet the energy needs of its
 industrial and agrarian sector will be greatly depend-
 ent upon the success of these conservation measures.

 Secret
 Chemical Industry
 The technical level of China's chemical industry-
 which provides critical materials for agriculture,
 heavy industry, light industry, and textiles-consists
 of a thin veneer of advanced imported technology,
 layered on a base of small-scale, out-of-date processes.
 As shown by substantial chemical imports and pur-
 chases of whole plants in the 1970s, the industry is not
 meeting the country's needs in quality, quantity, or
 variety of chemical products. Supplies of basic chemi-
 cals for heavy industry probably have kept pace with
 industrial needs, but other crucial areas such as
 fertilizer and petrochemicals have lagged behind de-
 mand. Petrochemicals, of course, have been depend-
 ent upon the development of China's oil industry,
 which only began in earnest in the 1960s and recently
 willingnness to allow foreign technicians to participate
 in various projects to facilitate technology assimila-
 tion.
 Although China is a major producer of chemical
 fertilizer, more than half its production from small,
 inefficient plants is poor quality. In 1973-74, Beijing
 contracted for 13 ammonia/urea complexes from
 abroad. But these plants are only now beginning to
 operate, because their construction was delayed by a
 variety of problems, ranging from a lack of skilled
 workers to shortages of natural gas feedstock. China
 needs additional capacity for fertilizers containing
 nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium and is seeking
 foreign technology for triple superphosphate and com-
 has had growth-related problems.
 As part of its modernization drive, Beijing is firmly
 committed to a policy of importing from the West
 advanced technology for the chemical industry. Such
 technology importation is hardly a new policy for
 China. Several Western petrochemical plants were
 imported in the mid-1960s, and about $1.6 billion
 worth of petrochemical facilities were purchased from
 1972 to 1976. An ammonia/urea plant brought from
 Western Europe in the 1960s was adapted and copied,
 and became the basis for medium-size fertilizer
 plants. The difference today is the scale of imports-
 contracts for over $3 billion in chemical plants have
 been signed since 1977, with continued priority given
 to fertilizers and petrochemicals. China almost cer-
 tainly will attempt to copy the technology in these
 plants. Most recently, however, imports of whole
 petrochemical plants and major investments for con-
 struction of large-scale petrochemical facilities have
 been curtailed as a result of cutbacks in heavy
 industry and capital construction.
 Large-scale effort is under way to solve some of the
 technology absorption problems that became obvious
 during the import program in the mid-1970s. In order
 to boost the woefully inadequate number of people
 technically qualified to build, to operate, and ulti-
 mately, to duplicate these plants, China is rejuvenat-
 ing technical education, reopening research institutes,
 and sending increasing numbers of technicians over-
 seas for study at universities, laboratories, and chemi-
 cal factories. The Chinese have indicated a greater
 pound fertilizers.
 China has sought foreign technology for all phases of
 the petrochemical process-from feedstocks to prod-
 ucts. Emphasis has been given to synthetic fiber
 production-vinylon, nylon, and acrylics-to free
 land from natural fiber production, to boost domestic
 textile production, and to increase exports. The Chi-
 nese also are attempting to increase production capac-
 ity for basic plastics and synthetic rubber. To produce
 these, they need large-scale production technologies
 for basic feedstocks, such as ethylene. In addition, the
 Chinese need to ensure that an adequate supply of
 petroleum is available to produce sufficient feedstocks
 for efficient plant operation. A lack of petroleum-
 based inputs was a contributing factor in the cancella-
 tion or postponement of numerous petrochemical proj-
 ects in 1979-80.
 Production of industrial chemicals-currently from
 small, outdated facilities-will have to be expanded to
 keep pace with planned industrial growth. This will
 require modern technologies, such as ion exchange
 processes for chlorine and caustic soda. These sub-
 stances now are produced with 1960s technologies.
 Technology absorption problems, raw material short-
 ages (particularly petroleum because of competing
 fuel demands), and infrastructural weaknesses will
 continue to plague these plans.

 Metallurgy
 The Chinese have continued to increase the quantity
 and quality of a wide range of steels-including
 carbon steel, high-strength steels, tool steel, spring
 steel, and some stainless steels. They cannot produce,
 however, the quantity, variety, and in some cases,
 quality of steels to meet their needs. The most critical
 technical shortcomings in the metallurgical industry
 are in the manufacturing process, including poor
 quality control, limited standardization, and insuffi-
 cient instrumentation. Electric power shortages also
 have prevented some plants from effectively using
 what modern manufacturing equipment they have,
 such as induction furnaces, electroslag refining cells,
 and electron beam welding
 The Chinese have had several significant technologi-
 cal successes in metallurgy. They have acquired and
 employed important ablative graphite composite tech-
 nology with critical applications in the manufacture of
 missile reentry vehicles. This technology is applicable
 to rocket motor cases, certain wing panels, and other
 components for fighter aircraft structures. Another
 significant achievement is the application of ceramic
 coatings for improving heat resistance of metal com-
 ponents in gas turbines: the Chinese have used the
 ceramic coatings as the matrix for a filamentary
 composite by the inclusion of quartz fibers or metal
 screens.
 To upgrade the quality and quantity of their steels
 and to learn advanced Western steel technology, the
 Chinese contracted with the West Germans and
 Japanese in the mid-1970s to build the Wuhan steel
 plant and in 1978, for a large steel complex at
 Baoshan. Technical bottlenecks, lack of sufficient
 electricity, and funding problems have slowed prog-
 ress of these projects.
 Consistent with their policy of gaining self-sufficiency
 and faced with a scarcity of chromium, the Chinese
 have developed on their own a steel alloy of tungsten,
 silicon, and manganese for use in bearings. The alloy
 is good quality, but it is not equal to American state-
 of-the-art chromium alloys because Chinese process-
 ing techniques are inferior to those in the West. To
 counter a similar lack of nickel, the Chinese have
 developed nonnickel steels. Although they have fabri-
 cated refractory metals, available evidence indicates
 the quality is not up to that of advanced, industrial-
 ized nations. The Chinese have concentrated on mo-
 lybdenum alloy development, because they probably
 are following early Soviet developments and because
 molybdenum is plentiful in China.
 Before economic readjustment slowed their negotia-
 tions, the Chinese had expressed interest in obtaining
 foreign facilities to process aluminum, aluminum
 powder, cobalt, duralumin, magnesium, nickel, tung-
 sten, and titanium. That they used these technologies
 to develop modern weapons has been readily acknowl-
 edged by the Chinese: aluminum for aircraft and
 missiles, aluminum powder for solid-propellant mis-
 siles, cobalt for jet engine manufacture, duralumin for
 airframes, magnesium for aircraft components, nickel
 for aircraft engine alloys, tungsten for armor piercing
 shells, and titanium for high-temperature airframes
 and engine shrouds, as well as the electroslag techno-
 logy for armor plate. Assuming that they will contin-
 ue to acquire foreign technologies, we anticipate that
 the Chinese first will pursue the technologies for dual-
 use systems and tactical weapons. In weapons devel-
 opment programs, China seems to be committed to
 completing existing strategic programs and to deve-
 loping replacements for obsolete conventional wea-
 pons systems.

 Secret
 China is working to develop further its ceramics
 technologies for commercial and military applica-
 tions. Chinese laboratories have successfully manu-
 factured cubic boron nitride, a ceramic material used
 for cutting tools; the Chinese should be able to
 produce enough of this material to supply cutting tool
 producers within their machine tool industry. Another
 significant advance was the laboratory-scale fabrica-
 tion in 1979 of silicon nitride for use as wear- and
 corrosion-resistant coatings for gas turbines.
 The Chinese also are actively pursuing many research
 efforts in composite materials development. The bulk
 of that research, however, is devoted to the simplest of
 the three types-filamentary composites. Serious re-
 search on sandwich and multilayer composites is
 being deferred for the present. The Chinese can
 produce some of the high-purity metals required for
 the matrix part of various filamentary composites, but
 only on a small scale in the laboratory; the Chinese
 encounter quality control problems when they try to
 produce some of the high-performance metal matrix
 materials on an industrial scale. One problem, for
 example, occurs in the production of cast-steel super-
 alloy matrix materials; the thermal resistance and
 stress properties of these materials have been uneven.
 The Chinese also have generally encountered prob-
 lems in their attempts to produce the long fibers and
 filaments used in filamentary composites. Although
 they have made notable advances in creating some
 laboratory specimens, they lack the expertise to man-
 ufacture uniform, full-scale filaments. Because they
 cannot produce some filaments on even a laboratory
 scale, they are actively seeking foreign technologies to
 manufacture aluminum, silicon, and carbon fibers.
 Machine Tool Industry
 The Chinese have developed a substantial machine
 tool industry, capable of supplying China's low- and
 medium-grade machine tool needs. China has ex-
 ported some good-quality, durable, general-purpose
 machine tools to southeast Asia. The Chinese are far
 less capable, however, of making precision machine
 tools and such things as miniature ball bearings and
 the high-speed reduction gears required to produce
 certain weapons. Levels of numerically controlled
 machine tool technology are as much as 10 years
 behind Western technology. Further, even if the
 Chinese acquired advanced numerical control ma-
 chine technology from abroad, problems would arise
 from the impact on employment and from the uneven
 technological match of the imported equipment with
 the managerial system and the equipment already in
 China's machine toolmakers have been handicapped
 by deficiencies in design capability and lack of preci-
 sion standards, as well as their lack of understanding
 of automated production controls. Quality control
 procedures are almost nonexistent. Computer-aided
 design of parts, components, and assembled mecha-
 nisms was virtually unknown until very recently.
 Computer-aided manufacturing is only in an early
 stage of development.
 China's machine-building industry produces serial
 items, using assimilated Western and Soviet technol-
 ogies of the 1940s and 1950s, but it has not yet
 absorbed the newer technologies-such as multiaxis
 and numerically controlled machines-acquired
 through one-of-a-kind or small lot purchases from
 Japan and the West in the 1960s and early 1970s.
 During the 1970s, the Chinese revealed some very
 sophisticated Chinese-made machine tools, including
 indigenous designs of numerically controlled systems,
 using integrated circuits. These precision tools, how-
 ever, are one-of-a-kind prototypes and are not ex-
 pected to result in increased manufacturing capability
 and capacity until the mid-to-late 1980s.

 Communications
 General goals for telecommunications modernization
 were set at China's second national conference of
 postal and telecommunications departments in Au-
 gust 1977: to implement modern telecommunications
 service in each of China's more than 2,000 counties by
 1980, to upgrade or to replace manual and semiauto-
 matic step-by-step switching systems with automatic
 electromechanical crossbar or all-electric switching
 technologies by 1985, and to catch up with the state of
 the art of the advanced world by the year 2000
 The Chinese cannot meet these broad, vague, and
 ambitious goals. Possibly by the year 2000 they will
 be doing world state-of-the-art research in one or
 more areas of telecommunications technology and will
 have some services roughly equivalent to those in the
 most advanced countries. But they will not achieve
 world level across the board for all communications
 technologies.
 Efforts are being made in a wide range of communi-
 cations areas-facsimile, color television, satellites,
 fiber optics, computers, and data transmittal-down
 to replacement of hand-cranked telephones and man-
 ual switching with dial telephones and automatic
 switching. But current levels of Chinese telecommuni-
 cations technology, quantities of equipment, and
 caliber of services are-at best-minimally adequate
 to meet the needs of high-priority defense and the civil
 government. For example, the complete conversion to
 automatic switching in each of China's 2,000 counties
 by 1985 is impossible because of the sheer magnitude
 of the tasks. The Chinese now realize that their
 original goals were too ambitious. Since the economic
 adjustment process began in mid-1979, they have not
 spoken of these objectives.
 Direct broadcasting via satellite is an area in which
 the Chinese could make significant advances by the
 year 2000. The Chinese space program
 is no more than 10
 years behind Western communications satellites. The
 characteristics of communications satellites-high
 technology but low-volume production and testing
 that can be done on the ground-mean that real
 achievements can be made by a relatively small
 number of experts, which is precisely the Chinese
 The other areas in which the Chinese could achieve
 their goals are fiber optics and facsimile technology.
 The Chinese have great interest and need in these
 areas and could make appreciable progress by the
 year 2000, if investments in training and research
 budgets are not cut back significantly
 If the Chinese are to advance in their telecommunica-
 tions technology, they must overcome some serious
 problems. The most serious appear to be the lack of a
 sufficient number of trained scientists and engineers
 and the lack of an infrastructure that can provide test
 and manufacturing equipment, mass production
 facilities, and spare parts. The majority of China's
 research and development facilities in telecommunica-
 tions seem more like prototype laboratories than the
 Western concept of research and development centers.
 The Chinese facilities focus on producing new equip-
 ment, but they also are forced to do most of the
 ancillary development of machine tools, parts, and
 test equipment. This detracts from the efficiency of
 more advanced personnel and limits resources that
 can be devoted to manufacturing the end product.
 Further, the lack of more than rudimentary standards
 and directions from centralized authorities and the
 heavy dependence on local initiative and self-reliance
 make the Chinese telecommunications network a
 patchwork quilt of varying levels of technology. Se-
 rious problems with the interconnectability of equip-
 ment and the quality and reliability of the network
 are inevitable and can be seen everywhere in China's
 telecommunications systems.
 Before economic readjustment halted negotiations,
 the Chinese were looking abroad for technological
 assistance. Between 1978 and 1979 China cooperated
 with France and West Germany to receive training on
 the Symphonie A satellite. The Chinese made no
 purchase, however. Although the Chinese had dis-
 cussed purchase of a US communications satellite,
 they informed the United States in late 1980 that they
 were postponing acquisition of a satellite. The Chinese
 have sent many delegations abroad for international
 meetings and factory tours associated with negotia-
 tions for foreign equipment. In these negotiations, the
 Chinese have strived to obtain maximum exposure to
 advanced design and manufacturing technology, as
 opposed to making outright equipment purchases.

 Secret
 Their efforts have focused mainly on the areas of
 satellite communications and automatic switching
 systems, both of which continue to be the highest
 priorities, as the Chinese have excess microwave and
 cable capacities.
 Electronics
 China lags 10 to 15 years behind the West in
 computer technology and the manufacture of asso-
 ciated semiconductor component technology (microe-
 lectronics). The rate of progress in various aspects of
 computer and semiconductor technologies has dif-
 fered considerably, however. For example, Chinese
 accomplishments in developing large-scale scientific
 computers for scientific applications have been
 impressive, while efforts in the development of soft-
 ware and modern peripheral equipment for general-
 purpose use remain at primitive levels. In semiconduc-
 tor technology, laboratory research has yielded
 impressive developments, but production yields of
 standardized products have been very disappointing.
 Aside from their late start in this rapidly evolving
 industry, the Chinese have faced a number of techni-
 cal and nontechnical obstacles. The very highly de-
 centralized structure of the industry and the lack of
 concern or understanding of the computer user are
 probably the most important problems. The absence
 of a supporting parts-and-materials infrastructure
 creates important technical and manufacturing prob-
 lems. The limited number of skilled personnel, espe-
 cially technically oriented policy officials and middle
 managers, is also a very serious problem.
 The impact of computers on the broad range of
 China's modernization goals is constrained, because
 the Chinese application of computers is limited. Com-
 puters are used in science and engineering in only a
 relatively few, high-priority cases-for example, a
 railroad, a steel mill, or a power grid. To make a real
 contribution to modernization, computers will have to
 be put into general use for planning, coordinating, and
 evaluating in areas such as agriculture, energy devel-
 opment, manufacturing, and transportation.
 For widespread application, computers must become
 available in quantity and must be designed for general
 use. Given the Chinese drive for self-sufficiency, this
 will mean domestic mass production of computers (as
 opposed to importation), for which production stand-
 ards must be established. The Chinese have a pro-
 gram to produce one series of general-purpose com-
 puters, but they have not enforced equipment and
 quality standards evenly. A lack of coordination and
 control, moreover, will impede widespread use of this
 or any other series of computers. We anticipate that it
 will be at least 10 to 15 years before an indigenous
 Chinese computer industry can begin to satisfy do-
 mestic needs.
 Microelectronics. The state of the art of microelec-
 tronics technology in China lags that of the West by
 more than 10 years. If volume production is taken into
 account, the gap is even wider. Most Chinese inte-
 grated circuits-the primary components of most
 electronic systems-produced in quantity are small-
 and medium-scale bipolar and metal-oxide semicon-
 ductor devices. These compare with models produced
 in the United States in the 1960s. But the quality of
 many of the Chinese components and in turn, their
 reliability, are uneven. Probably the most sophisti-
 cated device in production is a 256-bit random-access
 memory circuit.
 The Chinese have announced the development of
 impressive one-of-a-kind devices on a laboratory basis:
 for example, 1,000- and 4,000-bit semiconductor
 memories and high-speed, bipolar memory devices of
 256 bits. These devices, however, appear to be a long
 way from volume production. The breadth of semi-
 conductor research at universities and research insti-
 tutes is impressive, but it provides very little assist-
 ance in solving the major production problems facing
 the Chinese semiconductor industry, because links are
 still inadequate between university research efforts
 and production-oriented organizations.
 The Chinese are following the same basic path for
 developing silicon integrated circuits as that of the
 United States. They have the advantage, however, of
 seeing which technologies are more viable in the West
 and thus are able to emphasize the appropriate tech-
 nologies more quickly. The Chinese are stepping up
 their efforts to acquire Western semiconductor tech-
 nology, specifically production equipment. But pro-
 duction expertise-acquired through purchase of

 complete production facilities and extended contact
 with Western production operations and personnel-
 will be needed to solve many processing problems
 quickly
 The major shortcomings of semiconductor processing
 technology in China are (1) shortages of contemporary
 fabrication equipment, (2) lack of modern production
 facilities with necessary environmental control, and
 (3) inability to control process quality and to enforce
 production standards. Chinese production suffers
 from the very low yields of reliable devices and the
 wide variations in device characteristics. The major
 cause of low yield is contamination of devices during
 manufacture by environmental impurities and han-
 dling. These problems can be resolved only through
 the installation of better clean-room facilities and
 strict adherence to clean-room production practices.
 As the Chinese attempt higher device complexities,
 these problems will multiply if they are not corrected.
 Processing control, through a thorough understanding
 of processing phenomena and causes of defects, is
 necessary to produce semiconductor devices of good,
 uniform quality. To a large extent, this understanding
 can come with experience, but good production prac-
 tices and understanding first must be transferred to
 the many plants producing semiconductors. Enforcing
 device standards and monitoring production opera-
 tions are important means for stimulating this trans-
 fer of expertise
 Whether the Chinese can move to higher levels of
 integration in semiconductor devices will depend di-
 rectly upon Chinese abilities to solve these production
 problems. In addition, more advanced processes for
 design, fabrication, and testing of devices will have to
 be developed or acquired if the Chinese are to manu-
 facture medium- and large-scale integrated circuits
 successfully. Although the Chinese have already
 shown strong interest in computer-aided design and
 automated testing technology, these areas probably
 will not be critical until the Chinese reach large-scale-
 integration levels of density. Efforts are already under
 way to develop capabilities in advanced technologies
 of lithography, ion implantation, and other processing
 that will become important in the future. In the near
 term, however, improvement of existing production
 processes and equipment is the most pressing priority
 in Chinese microelectronics technology
 Computer Technology. The compok_ter situation is
 much the same as that of the United States in the
 1950s-a small installed base of a few thousand
 machines: predominantly digital computers, but with
 a high percentage of analog and hybrid computers
 performing vital functions, a large variety of com-
 puters that are not generally compatible (no one
 model having been made in quantity). The focus is on
 applications in scientific and industrial control rather
 than in business. Because the leading specialists in the
 computer field in China are academic-not indus-
 trial-personnel, they are more interested in the
 technology than in the manufacturability, quality,
 and usability of computer products.
 The Chinese have a firm understanding of the funda-
 mentals of computer hardware design and are knowl-
 edgeable about most of the latest Western design
 innovations. They have shown strong capabilities in
 fairly sophisticated adaptations of Western designs,
 choosing features that best meet Chinese needs and
 making modifications to compensate for limitations in
 their electronic component technology. The Chinese
 do not always make the correct design choice, how-
 ever, to meet application needs of users or to develop a
 computer that can be easily manufactured in quan-
 tity. For example, we believe that a high percentage of
 the new machines developed by CAS institutes do not
 meet these two requirements and thus are not put into
 production.
 The Chinese apparently do not have a strong funda-
 mental capability in software design, particularly in
 areas important for developing large operating sys-
 tems. While they have made respectable accomplish-
 ments in developing compilers for several high-level
 programing languages, their progress in understand-
 ing concepts important in the design of complex
 software systems is very limited. This is due partly to
 their limited base of software specialists and their
 historically narrow focus on scientific and engineering
 applications, involving highly trained computer
 professionals, knowledgeable in machine or assembly-
 language programing. Only a conscious shift to

 general-purpose computing with a commitment of
 significant resources to software development and
 manufacture of electromechanical equipment will im-
 prove this situation. Still to emerge is an emphasis on
 the widespread use of general-purpose computers,
 programed and operated by large numbers of users
 with little formal computer training.
 Only within the last few years have the Chinese had a
 program to produce a series of compatible computers
 of varying size, with interchangeable components, to
 serve a wide variety of general-purpose users. The
 DJS-200 computer series, patterned after the IBM
 360 series, is a major step in this direction. But
 Chinese attempts to build DJS-200 computers at
 different locations, using locally available parts and
 materials, probably will lead to serious variations in
 product quality and major problems of compatibility,
 even among the same models within the series,
 The Chinese computer designers intend to replace the
 200 series with a new general-purpose computer
 series, the DJS-300, which will be compatible with
 Western computer systems and equipment. Its devel-
 opment, however, will be influenced by some of the
 same problems that have affected other Chinese
 computer development programs.
 A State Administration of Computer Industry has
 been formed to enforce conformity with equipment-
 interface standards, to develop important operating
 systems software, and to provide nationwide customer
 support. So far, this organization has had only limited
 success. Failure to meet such responsibilities will
 greatly reduce and delay effective and widespread use
 of the DJS-200 or any other series of computers.
 In addition to lagging the West in developing stand-
 alone computer products, China has very little expe-
 rience in the use or design of complex systems involv-
 ing multiple, interconnected computers or major
 computer centers with a large assortment of remote
 terminals and mass storage. Modest development
 efforts have been under way in building time-shared
 systems, but the Chinese lack the expertise required
 for integrating facilities, equipment, communications,
 and systems. The same deficiencies exist in software
 and peripherals, and understanding users' needs.
 Visitors to China often are impressed by the diversity
 of advanced research projects and by the up-to-date
 technical awareness of Chinese computer scientists,
 whose research efforts in the most advanced areas of
 computer technology give the impression that the
 Chinese are further ahead than they actually are. In
 fact, very few, if any, of these research projects have    25X1
 made any real impact on computer use, because the             M
 concepts are too advanced to be applied
 Surrounded by a vast amount of Western technology
 and expertise, the Chinese have made gallant efforts
 to adapt or to reverse-engineer Western products and
 designs. For example, some series of minicomputers
 for specific functions are patterned after exploited US
 minicomputers, specifically US Data General Nova
 models. A large-scale, general-purpose computer was
 designed in China, based on early design and other
 engineering documentation in Western open litera-      25X1
 ture. Even when the Chinese successfully adapt West-
 ern computer design concepts, however, we doubt that
 the Chinese understand why or how such designs were
 created. To understand user requirements and to
 design a highly serviceable product of adequate man-
 ufacturability cannot be learned from merely reverse-
 engineering of foreign manufactured equipment; di-
 rect involvement in the design process is required.

 Satellites. China made impressive progress early in
 its space program, apparently because of the high
 priority placed on the role of space during the mid-
 1970s when the development of military intelligence
 satellites was emphasized. The general problems of
 mass production that commonly plague most other
 Chinese industries are not a factor in the space
 program, because most related items are custom made
 in very limited quantities. Recently, however, the
 space program appears to have been delayed, possibly
 because of a combination of funding, bureaucratic,
 and technical problems.
 Most Chinese space technologies are not state of the
 art but appear adequate for present needs. We expect
 the space program to improve with China's exposure
 to more advanced foreign technologies. We do not
 expect technological levels and assimilation of more
 sophisticated skills to pose the greatest obstacles-at
 least in the near term. We see lack of understanding
 of the concepts of systems and subsystems reliability,
 lack of rigorous quality control, and poor systems
 integration and program management as the major
 obstacles to the Chinese space program

 China also has a strong interest in earth resources
 satellites. A domestically built satellite is under devel-
 opment, but in the meantime, the imagery from US
 Landsats is being used in a variety of programs. To
 facilitate receipt of Landsat-produced data, the Chi-
 nese have negotiated for several years to buy a
 Landsat ground station. This purchase has been de-
 layed for financial and technical reasons. The Chinese
 have expressed a desire to separate the receiving
 portion of the station from the data processing section.
 This would not only increase the price of the station,
 but because the separation would entail additional
 strategic technology, the sale would require further
 review by COCOM, a coordinating committee of
 representatives from NATO countries.
 China's planned domestic program will provide a
 modest experimental satellite communications system
 but not the fully operational system desired. To
 achieve this and to speed up progress in their own
 space program, the Chinese negotiated for the pur-
 chase of direct-broadcast satellites from the United
 States or Europe, hoping to absorb as much satellite
 technology as possible. Early in 1981, however, the
 Chinese officially informed the United States that the
 purchase would have to be delayed for several years
 due to lack of funds. In the meantime, China appar-
 ently plans to improve its domestic communications
 by leasing channels on Intelsat satellites, which China
 has used for international communications for several
 years.

 Appendix
 The Structure and Operation
 of China's S&T System
 The Chinese leadership has attempted to revitalize
 and to strengthen the organizations responsible for
 managing S&T policy and for conducting R&D activ-
 ities. Scientists and technical personnel have been
 given a large voice in policymaking. The functioning
 of China's S&T system, however, has been plagued by
 organizational and political problems, some of which
 stem from the continued aftereffects of the Cultural
 Revolution, but most of which have been characteris-
 tic of complex organizations in China. The cumber-
 some bureaucratic apparatus for handling S&T af-
 fairs has been beset by coordination problems at both
 the administrative and working levels.
 The prerequisites for S&T modernization, therefore,
 have included not only a need to elevate the status of
 S&T in China but also to confront the large number
 of inefficiencies within the S&T sector that limit
 sustained productivity. Initial indications are that
 economic benefits have been marginal, and numerous
 bureaucratic obstacles still restrict the development of
 an effective, indigenous S&T system.
 Research in China is conducted within three main
 institutional structures: the CAS, the various indus-
 trial and machine-building ministries, and the univer-
 sity system. In addition, there is a defense-related
 research system, which often penetrates the civilian
 research structure. Most basic scientific research is
 conducted within the institutes of the academy, while
 most applied research is carried out in ministry
 institutes. Some research is also conducted in Chinese
 universities, although their primary function is educa-
 tion. The research activities of these three structures
 are monitored and integrated by national S&T com-
 missions.
 Chinese S&T Commissions
 Two national commissions are responsible for oversee-
 ing S&T activities in China. The SSTC coordinates
 and administers civilian-related S&T programs. The
 National Defense Science and Technology Commis-
 sion (NDSTC) has primary responsibility for adminis-
 tering S&T policy for defense-related S&T projects.
 Established in 1958, the SSTC was disbanded during
 the Cultural Revolution. Its reestablishment in
 1977-78 with associated provincial committees re-
 flected China's increased emphasis on the role of
 science, as well as an effort to upgrade the status and
 to expand the role of experts in the formulation of
 S&T policies at both the national and provincial
 levels.
 As currently organized, the state commission reports
 directly to the State Council, which ultimately con-
 trols the commission budget and has final approval
 over all major commission-endorsed projects. Accord-
 ing to pronouncements by the Chinese political and
 scientific leadership, the commission has been dele-
 gated a key policymaking responsibility. Its present
 role in policy formulation probably is much more
 25X1
 25X1
 limited, however, than these statements indicate. In 25X1
 general, we believe, the main function of the commis-
 sion is to give coherence and to foster cooperation in
 the implementation of national policy for science and
 technology.
 The SSTC has five bureaus, each with a specific
 function. The first bureau makes plans for overall
 research efforts, while the second bureau has respon-
 sibility for projects in energy, resources, and materi-
 als. The third bureau oversees S&T activities related
 to transportation, communications, industry, and the
 development of new technologies. The fourth handles
 agriculture, health, and light industry, and the fifth is
 responsible for developing nuclear energy. An admin-  25X1
 istrative office supports China's international S&T
 relationships and facilitates coordination and com-
 munication among S&T groups in China. In each
 province, an S&T committee coordinates provincial

 Approved For Release 2007/08/08: CIA-RDP83B00551 R000200150005-7
 The primary concern of the SSTC is research for
 civilian applications. A major responsibility is seeing
 that research results are distributed to production
 units and coordinating projects that cut across the
 various production ministries. Each SSTC bureau has
 members from universities, the CAS, and the indus-
 trial and machine-building ministries. An example of
 the broad SSTC involvement in both research and
 development was a conference the commission called
 recently to speed up the development and manufac-
 ture of large-scale-integration (LSI) computer com-
 ponents in China. The conference was attended by
 academicians, technicians, engineers, and scientists
 representing research institutes, ministerial produc-
 tion units, and machine-building ministries.
 The SSTC also is responsible for helping to support
 Chinese contacts with foreign scientists and S&T
 organizations. Commission policy encourages and fa-
 cilitates scientific collaboration with other nations in
 support of national development.
 The NDSTC is the chief coordinating body for
 defense-related S&T activities. In contrast to the
 SSTC, the NDSTC appears to have a direct control
 over many of the institutes and factories with which it
 carries out its mandate. It also appears to be much
 more authoritative .than the SSTC and apparently is
 involved in the technical aspects as well as the
 administrative side of research. The NDSTC has
 greater discretionary control over funding and a
 higher priority to utilize nondefense organizations and
 personnel for cooperation on specific projects. It may
 directly task any university laboratory or industrial
 ministry, including those outside its direct administra-
 tive control. (Note: The SSTC does not appear to have
 the ability to task NDSTC institutes, although it may
 request assistance on certain occasions.) The NDSTC
 also has a much larger budget than the SSTC and
 seems to have first priority when new graduates are
 assigned and new equipment is allocated. Some at-
 tempt has been made to bring all S&T research,
 civilian and defense, under the control of the SSTC,
 but the degree to which this has been successful
 remains unclear. Although the NDSTC clearly plays
 a major role in China's S&T system, the full extent of
 its capabilities remains vague, due apparently to
 Chinese efforts to disguise defense-related research
 Chinese Academy of Science
 The CAS, headquartered in Beijing, is the most
 prestigious Chinese scientific organization and the
 central institution in China responsible for carrying
 out basic S&T research. Although the CAS is sup-
 posed to report to the SSTC, it has become semi-
 autonomous in many respects and often reports direct-
 ly to the State Council. Its growing influence derives
 from the fact that most of China's best S&T personnel
 work within institutes of the science academy.' In
 addition, the science academy has sole responsibility
 for the administration and functioning of all its own
 research institutes and facilities.
 The CAS has five major departments: (1) mathe-
 matics and physics, (2) chemistry, (3) biosciences,
 (4) geosciences, and (5) technical sciences. Decision-
 making authority is centered in the presidium of the
 scientific council of the academy. The presidium is
 composed of 29 members; two-thirds are members of
 the academy, and one-third are representatives of
 other government and party institutions. The presid-
 ium elects the president and vice president of the
 academy. The CAS has approximately 117 research
 institutes scattered under the control of 11 branch
 academies in the cities of Shanghai, Hefei, Chengdu,
 Kanjing, Kumming, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Wuhan,
 Lanzhou, Xingiang, and Xian. The institutes are
 oriented mainly toward research in basic and theoreti-
 cal sciences. The CAS also plays a role in S&T
 training and education, because it holds responsibili-
 ties for the administration of four S&T universities-
 from the view of Western observers.

 Industrial and Machine-Building Ministries
 The second major organizational sector for S&T
 research in China includes the industrial and
 machine-building ministries, a number of which have
 S&T departments at the national level. Most have one
 or more research institutes that, in turn, supervise
 varying numbers of research components. Also under
 the ministries are production facilities, some of which
 have their own research facilities.
 Ministerial research institutes mainly conduct applied
 research that tends to be closely related to production
 goals at the national level. S&T activities within this
 sector and budgetary allocations for research gen-
 erally fall under the jurisdiction of the individual
 ministries. Depending upon the scope of a project or
 its civilian/ military orientation, the two commis-
 sions-the NDSTC and the SSTC-have the author-
 ity to task the various ministries
 Universities
 A third source of S&T research in China is its
 universities. The CAS, the industrial and machine-
 building ministries, and the Ministry of Education all
 have universities that they control and fund. Both
 basic and applied research are done at the universi-
 ties; as expected, those with close ties to industrial
 ministries focus on applied research, while the science
 academy universities emphasize basic research. All
 these universities also may do research in industrial or
 defense-related fields. Efforts are under way to ex-
 pand significantly the research function of Chinese
 universities. Among the leading universities with
 strong S&T programs are Qinghua, Fudan, and Beij-
 ing; these are administered by the Mnstof Educa-
 tion.
 ministerial universities also are responsible for train-     25X1
 The CAS universities have already been noted. Exam-
 ples of ministry universities are the 10 controlled by
 the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry; these are
 specifically oriented toward metallurgical studies and
 research. The Third Machine-Building Ministry con-
 trols the Northwestern Technical University in Xian,
 which specializes in aeronautical engineering. These
 ing S&T personnel for their parent ministries. Other
 universities are run entirely by the Ministry of Educa-
 tion or jointly by the ministry and the industrial or
 machine-building industry
 Planning
 First announced in 1978 by the central political
 leadership, the Chinese National Science Plan was
 based upon the recommendations and advice of lead-
 ing scientists throughout China. During the current
 readjustment program, it has undergone major review     25X1
 and revision as a result of shifting priorities and the
 party leadership's better recognition of immediate
 needs. The major emphasis now is on applied research
 and the direct contributions that S&T can make to
 the modernization program.
 The Chinese National Science Plan provides guide-
 lines for determining the priorities of S&T activities.
 It outlines basic objectives for the development of
 specific research plans by each research institution.      25X1
 Based upon these objectives, every research depart-
 ment within each CAS institute, for example, annu-
 ally reviews its accomplishments of the previous year,

 surveys the progress of continuing programs, exam-
 ines proposals for each new research project, and then
 composes a departmental plan for the following year.
 The managerial staff of the research institute-with
 the advice of an academic committee of outside
 experts and some of its own scientists-reviews the
 departmental plans and proposes an institute-wide
 plan. A CAS committee of senior managers reviews
 these institute plans and, theoretically at least, for-
 wards a proposed plan for the entire academy through
 the state S&T commission to the state council.
 New S&T projects within Chinese research institutes
 may be proposed by individual scientists or techni-
 cians or by industrial managers. A good deal of input
 appears to come from below. Once a national research
 program is completed, the staff of the SSTC identifies
 gaps and recommends specific institutes to conduct
 research to fill these gaps. Guidance could concern
 research given a high priority in the national plan but
 not fully covered in institute plans, or it could provide
 for further development of prototypes and products
 that are not quite ready for mass production
 Initial plans for reform of the S&T system were
 aimed at decentralizing decisionmaking and increas-
 ing the autonomy of each operating unit, but these
 plans have been postponed as readjustment has neces-
 sitated greater central control to advance the economy
 and S&T system. For S&T, this has meant a more
 careful monitoring of all related activities and greater
 attention to the ways in which research can make a
 contribution to the modernization program. At the
 same time, scientists have been given an increased
 role in policy formulation to assess proposed projects
 or foreign technology purchases for technical and
 economic feasibility. The emergence of "techno-
 economics" as a growing field of study in China
 reflects the awareness of the leadership to further
 minimize waste and to ensure optimal use of scarce
 S&T resources.
 In theory, research organizations submit yearly re-
 search proposals and plans to the State S&T Commis-
 sion, which then reviews and balances the requests in
 accordance with annual and longer range plans. The
 CAS is an exception. It has enormous prestige and a
 much longer institutional history than the SSTC.
 Prior to formation of the commission and its predeces-
 sor, the science academy was responsible for all
 national S&T planning. The CAS apparently submits
 its research plans directly to the State Ccouncil for
 approval, without going through the State S&T Com-
 mission, except for obtaining tacit approval. This
 bypass was facilitated by Vice Premier Fang Yi: he is
 Minister in Charge of State S&T Commission and
 until May 1981 was president of the science academy.
 His coinciding appointments may have been designed
 to alleviate potential problems with coordination and
 competition between the two organizations. Further,
 the State Council, not the SSTC, approves the open-
 ing of new academy branch institutes and approves
 new members elected to the academy. Most recently,
 the freedom of the CAS to follow an independent line
 of action may be more limited due to the closer
 monitoring of S&T activities by the SSTC and eco-
 nomic officials.
 When different institutes propose similar projects, the
 CAS (if the competing proposals are presented by
 different science academy institutes) or the SSTC (if
 the competing proposals are developed by ministerial
 institutes) is responsible for assigning the project to
 the appropriate institute. Such decisions usually are
 based on the scientific record and geographical loca-
 tion of the institutes, the relative costs of the propos-
 als, and the completion schedule proposed. Although
 research historically has been concentrated in Beijing
 and Shanghai, and institutes in the two cities general-
 ly have had better facilities and more competent
 personnel, an attempt has been made recently to
 disperse research funds and to strengthen local S&T
 capabilities throughout other areas.
 The locus of decisionmaking generally varies with the
 priority and level of funding required for a particular
 project. For example, construction of the recently
 postponed Beijing proton synchroton project entailed
 the participation of more than 10 ministries, commis-
 sions, and other units, as well as more than 100
 factories. The entire project had an estimated price
 tag of US $500 million. It received authorization from
 the Politburo and the State Council, and was ap-
 proved directly by Deng Xiaoping.

 Secret
 On the other hand, CAS institutes, military institutes,
 and universities all have some discretionary funds that
 they can dispense without higher authorization. Deci-
 sions on institutional support and funding for small
 projects often are based upon the guidance and advice
 of participants from the lower levels of these organiza-
 tions. In addition, each Vice Premier at the State
 Council reportedly controls his own scientific research
 funds and can allocate them as desired without any
 other approval. Within the Chinese S&T system,
 organizations that have control over funding tend to
 have control over the assignment of S&T priorities
 and R&D activities.
 Coordination
 A major function of the SSTC is coordinating re-
 search efforts between the ministerial and CAS insti-
 tutes. In addition to eliminating duplication of pro-
 jects, this function involves encouraging cooperation
 among institutes, stimulating the flow of S&T infor-
 mation from abroad to relevant institutes, and ensur-
 ing that new processes and inventions are available to
 potential users. The goal of all these activities is
 effectively and efficiently translating research devel-
 opments into production results.
 The Chinese S&T system frequently is plagued by a
 lack of coordination between research institutes, lack
 of communications between scientists, duplication of
 research efforts, and only limited interactions between
 research institutes and factories. End-user involve-
 ment in the choice of S&T projects and in the
 evaluation of R&D results is often conspicuously
 absent. Chinese R&D efforts tend to be highly com-
 partmentalized. As a result, little communication and
 interaction take place among the science academies,
 the ministries, and the university research groups, or
 even among parts of the same organizations. One
 result is that the way the system will function or how
 innovations will develop and spread cannot always be
 logically predicted
 The SSTC was reestablished to alleviate such prob-
 lems. A closer look at recent examples of R&D
 projects in progress or completed reveals that individ-
 uals and groups from diverse organizations have
 begun to work together to improve the quality of
 technology and related products. CAS research insti-
 organizations and production units.
 tutes have worked with universities and factories
 under the Ministry of Education to develop products.
 The military has become increasingly associated with
 academy institutes to conduct applied research in
 several areas. In a growing number of cases, ministe-
 rial research institutes and universities are working
 closely with factories to solve manufacturing problems
 or to develop new products; ministries are selecting
 CAS research developments to put into production;
 and the science academy is selling its research designs
 directly to factories on a contract basis. In short,
 stronger connections are being established among
 elements within the S&T system and between S&T
 The Chinese bureaucracy, however, remains cumber-
 some, and the S&T system frequently falls victim to
 an overburdensome bureaucracy. The chain of com-
 mand in the research structure tends to be painfully
 slow and tedious, and formal communications
 between structures still appear to have problems.
 Through a variety of personal ties and informal
 channels, Chinese scientists manage to link an assort-
 ment of organizations drawn from any of the three
 research structures, the military, or the factories into
 working units on specific projects. How widespread
 and how often this practice occurs, how long it takes,
 and the percentage of time such linking can be done
 successfully remain open to question. Because of this
 uncertainty, managers in production enterprises have
 difficulty in incorporating technology developments
 into their planning strategy
 Despite recent improvements, such as the emergence
 of various organizations responsible for the collection
 and dissemination of scientific information, links
 among components of the S&T system for diffusing
 technical information remain weak or do not exist.
 Western scientists frequently have reported that
 scientists in one region were duplicating research
 efforts being carried out in another area. Foreigners
 often have been the first to tell Chinese scientists

 This acknowledged unevenness in coordination and
 cooperation appears to result from several factors.
 The narrow professional training of the scientists
 educated in the Soviet Union during the 1950s or in
 China itself since 1949 makes it difficult for scientists
 even in related fields to communicate with one an-
 other. Moreover, scientists working on defense-related
 items often are segregated from those working on
 civilian projects; they are admonished not to discuss
 their work with other scientists. Geographical factors
 also enter into the picture. Substantial distances
 between urban areas and the lack of adequate and
 rapid communication links limit cooperation among
 scientists.
 Many research institutes may be apprehensive about
 volunteering the services of their personnel in cooper-
 ative projects for fear that the personnel might not
 return. Securing a qualified replacement is difficult,
 particularly if the research institute is not in a major
 urban area.
 Frequently, organizational and personal relationships
 have resulted in animosity and competition. Because
 of the paucity of equipment, personnel, and funding,
 institutes tend to compete for resources rather than to
 cooperate. This problem was exacerbated during the
 initial period of decentralization in 1978-79, because
 possession of specialized information and expertise
 became a valuable technical resource with potential
 financial rewards.
 To counter some of these problems, the SSTC insti-
 tuted several policies: Professional S&T associations
 have been reestablished and charged with facilitating
 communication among scientists and technicians
 through national and local level conferences, and
 publication and dissemination of professional jour-
 nals. S&T associations have been encouraged to pro-
 vide advice and guidance to research and production
 units in their vicinity. The state commission has
 actively encouraged greater interaction among S&T
 personnel and has sponsored several national confer-
 ences on particularly important topics. Although the
 tangible benefits of these efforts remain limited, it is
 too early to evaluate their long-term implications for
 S&T modernization.
 Supervision
 The SSTC provides minimal supervision over the
 actual research within both ministerial and CAS
 institutes. The state commission has the authority,
 however, to monitor the work of the institutes through
 several mechanisms: periodic progress reports submit-
 ted by the institutes on research projects and meetings
 between institute personnel and commission officials
 for planning purposes. The lack of technical expertise
 among a sizable number of commission personnel and
 the loyalty of commission scientific advisers to their
 respective institutes probably impact upon the objec-
 tivity and quality of commission reviews. In the long
 run, an institute that fails to fulfill its annual plans
 appears likely to have its share of research funds
 reduced, particularly as the readjustment program
 acquires momentum. The commission has been espe-
 cially anxious to alleviate the frequent waste from
 purchasing foreign technologies that later were under-
 utilized due to a dearth of competent persons to use
 the technology or a lack of understanding of mainte-
 nance procedures. As a result, all proposals for major
 purchases of foreign technology now must be reviewed
 and approved by the central authorities in Beijing
 responsible for foreign technology acquisition.
