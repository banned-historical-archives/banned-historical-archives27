WHEN THE FUTURE BECOMES THE PAST,or, 
THE RETURN-to-the-PAST MOVEMENTS IN 1986 
The Greatest Threat in Today's World

It was the cold, snowy December of 1978, and an unsuspecting 
but infinitely vulnerable world was about to begin turning in its 
axis around such an unlikely spot as the little French village of 
Neauphle-le-Chateau, only 80 miles from Paris. The Ayatollah 
Khomeini of Persia---the type of Old Testament religious autocrat 
that most "rational" 'Westerners could not believe still 
existed---had taken up brief but revealing residence there before 
going back to Iran to overthrow the West's great friend, the Shah 
of Iran. 
That December day, Khomeini, just "out" in the West for the 
first time after 15 years of exile in the holy Shiite city of 
Najaf in Iraq, sat impassively before me on a Persian rug in a 
small and equally unlikely empty French summer house. 
"Yes," this hoary character was saying of the "revolution" 
that already had started between his fanatically religious

followers and the Shah, "we consider this war as a holy war, and 
by that we mean for the sake of Islam and for the sake of God 
and for the liberty of our people. That is why it is a holy war, 
and it will continue until the abdication of the Shah, the 
eradication of the monarchy and the end of foreign domination of 
our affairs and the establishment of an Islamic Republic." 
During the hour-long interview, Khomeini sat totally and 
unnaturally still. He stared, his eyes never blinking or 
flickering, at a space between his aide, Ibrahim Yazdi, and me as 
though he were indeed staring at some vision that we could not 
fathom. He had entered the room---and soon he left it---as though 
he were some great black moth floating in and out of space. 
One had to rub one's eyes to believe that this surreal scene, 
one that could have been out of the "1,001 Nights" of ancient 
Baghdad, were quite real. (One problem was that I could not even 
rub my eyes since the Iranians had insisted I wear the black robe 
or chador over my blonde head!) 
As it turned out, Khomeini WAS staring at a very special 
vision. The odd thing was that his "vision" was not to carry his 
people forward in time; it was not to educate them and free them 
from poverty, pain, hunger and war; it was not to modernize his 
impoverished ancient land. 
No. Instead, his "vision" was to carry his people backwards: 
to some totally pure and perfect Islamic past that he places 
historically around the 7th century! This, of course, was the 
golden age of Islam. To carry him back to it, his perfervid 
.followers 
soon were to claim that he was the "Hidden Imam" of Shiism who

had been hidden in a cave for over 1,000 years---it was this 
"Hidden Imam's" return that would presage the new golden age. 
It was also Khomeini's return to Iran which would set in motion 
forces of such power---hundreds of thousands of black-clad 
Iranians, fists raised, marching into soldiers firing 
machineguns---that within months virtually all Western influence 
would be driven from the very Iran that the Shah had set up as 
"the" inner circle of Westernization in Central Asia. 
Covering something like Khomeini and Khomeinism---something 
we had never seen or dreamed of before, at least in our rational 
and pragmatic times---presented those of us who were trying to be 
serious and responsible correspondents with extraordinary and 
unexpected problems for which there were no guides and no 
guidebooks. 
Because ancient Persia had been overrun so many times by 
virtually all the nations and tribes around them, the Persian 
Shiites had developed as a kind of tenet of their religion not 
only the right but the duty to "dissimulate." To simplify, thin 
meant to lie to the infidel in the service of the faith. 
I knew or at least sensed that Khomeini was lying to me when 
he told me that Iran, under him, would be a democracy and that 
women would have full "rights." But how do you explain that 
you think this chap you are interviewing seated on a Persian rug 
in a big black robe with his sinister ayes fixed on the horizon 
was most probably lying? How do you then speculate that it is 
because of what the Mongoloedid destroying the great Persian

Be that as it may, the reality is that Khomeinism has. become 
if not "the" problem of the 1980s, certainly one of the two or 
three problems. He has reestablished the ancient Islamic law in a

rapidly modernizing Iran. He has established a theocratic state. 
Most important for the rest of the world, he has systematically 
and with extraordinary passion rocked the borders of states as 
near as neighboring Iraq and as far away as Malaysia and 
Indonesia. And---in 1986, he still wages a bitter and ancient war 
with neighboring Iraq in which more than 1 million have died. 
King Hussein of Jordan told me after the Iraqi-Iranian war 
began in 1980 that he could imagine no more "sinister" threat to 
moderation in the Middle East than the breakdown of borders--
through the Khomeini-sponsored ancient form of Shiite subversion 
--that Khomeini so avidly sponsored. 
But, very well, you might say, yes, Khomeinism IS a strange 
and ominous development; but it also IS restricted to the Middle 
East. It is a very particularist response of a special and 
historically paranoid people---the Persian Shiites---against 
Western influence in its country. It is interesting, but mostly 
as a human and geopolitical aberration. 
Unfortunately---most unfortunately---Khomeinism is no 
aberration. It is the tip of the iceberg (to use a faraway Arctic 
metaphor) of a phenomenon that is occurring across the world. To 
mention only some of the most dramatic and some of the 
increasingly noticeable ones, there is the Sendero Luminoso (The 
"Shining Path") in Peru, the radical Sikh movement in the Punjab 
in Northern India, the radical Islamic cults in Egypt whose 
leadership assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and who 
remain a threat to the secular Egyptian state, the Jewish 
militants on the West Bank in Israel and and even some 
extreme fundamentalist Christians in America and Europe.

I call them the "Return-to-the-Past Movements" because I 
don't know a better title for what they are trying to do---and, 
increasingly, what they ARE doing. 
Think of the last two American presidencies. Most analysts 
pretty much agree that it was the Iranian hostage crisis---and 
President Jimmy Carter's too-patient response to the seemingly 
unending ordeal---which sealed his reelection hopes. Most 
analysts also would agree, I think, that the greatest challenge 
to President Ronald Reagan was the eerily related hostage crisis 
in 1985 in Beirut, when Americans on the TWA flight were held by 
Lebanese Shiite militiamen inspired by--who else?---the Ayatollah 
Khomeini. 
At the same time, hopes for peace in the Middle East were 
being torn apart by the attempts by the Shiites literally to tear 
down the borders of Western-leaning countries like Iraq, Jordan, 
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States---by 1986, they were all 
fighting for their lives. Within Israel itself, rational 
Israelis' hopes for peace were being destroyed by their own 
radicals who wanted to return to a territorial Israel of 1,900 
years ago. Once pro-Western Lebanon...also was Khomeini-ized. 
The Reagan administration, like any administration of 
"practical" and "no-nonsense" tough men, was thinking on its 
front burner over relations with the Soviets and of conventional 
warfare. Yet, in case after case, what our men and women in power 
were actually REACTING to was the sinister chaos of these new

6. 
and thoroughly unknown and unanalyzed movements whose self-
righteous violence was wracking the senses of the world. The 
Reagan administration, which never paused for a minute to analyze 
what had happened to it in the tragedy and disgrace of those 
Marines killed in Lebanon against Return-to-the-Past Shiites, 
remained fixed on nuclear war and arms control talks. Yet, across 
the world, the sanity and the structures of the world were being 
strained by maddened movements all of whom gained 'their sure 
inner power through their assurance they were returning to a 
perfect past. 
It should not be missed that that meant--and means?,utterly 
and ruthlessly destroying the relativity of the present.di 
While the men in power --and I must say, the structured 
Western male mind, in all its rationality and pragmatism--were 
ignoring these developments in part because they simply could not 
understand at all the dynamics of what was happening in these 
societies and in their minds), there was an occasional voice of 
concerned wonder. 
Ronald Reagan's feisty and unorthodox Amb. to the United 
Nations in his first term, Jeane Kirkpatrick, perhaps BECAUSE she 
was an unorthodox thinker, expressed her concern that American 
policy was simply not even beginning to address these themes so 
crucial to our times. In an interview in her handaome U.N. Office

fr, 
on Dec. 19, 1984, She told me thoughtfully and worriedly, "Most 
of our planning is only marginally relevant to what is really 
taking place." 
When I asked her why, she went on, saying, "Thinking about 
both political and military problems, there is always a powerful 
tendency to be governed by what was. It is the Maginot Line 
complex. The Power of Conventional Thinking. The conventional 
management of conventional realities tends to obscure the past. 
In the present, the baggage of conventional thinking about the 
continuum of events from the Vietnams to the world wars, I think 
tends to obscure realities of the unconventional challenges with 
which we find ourselves faced." 
What, then, if America did not, still, come to understand 
the unconvetional, the irregular and (finally) the unthinkable? 
"Either we have to, or we fail, she answered simply. 
A high American intelligence official, who cannot be named 
also expressed to me the intelligence community's just beginning 
concern with the unconventional, the irregular and the 
unthinkable. 
"We share your concern regarding the threat posed by 
demographic shifts, illegal migration, the risk of irregular 
warfare and the revolutions of 'The Return to the Past' and are 
actively seeking to improve our expertise in these areas," he 
told me "For example, we now have two analytic groups devoted 
solely to studying the root causes of political instability and 
insurgency in the Third World. 
"Perhaps the greatest challenge before us now is to explore

hdw these new social forces are likely to bring about dramatic 
change in the current political and social order. You mentioned 
that 100 or more political, social, religious and ethnic groups 
are organized militarily and threaten 52 sovereign states. Which 
of these groups are most likely to launch the next revolution? 
More important, how exactly would they go about it?" 
He was referring to some figures on irregular warfare that I 
had dug out that are closely related to the Return-to-the-
Past movements. For instance, by 1984---at a time when AMerica's 
political and ,military leaders were obsessed by the dangers of 
nuclear war and were still busily building up enormous 
conventional lillttary machines, under a huge defense budget---it 
was already clear that that type of military machine correlated 
only negatively (as in LEbanon) to the reality of conflict in 
this new world, some key figures: 
By 1984, there were 40 wars raging across the globe. They 
involved 45 different "nations or, to be more exact, "entities" 
of various forms. Of the 80 wars that began after 1945, only 28 
took the traditional form of fighting between the regular armed 
forces of two or more states. Forty six percent were civil wars, 
insurgencies or guerrilla contests, with the remaining six being 
riots and coups d'etat. U.N. Secy. General Javier Perez de 
Cuellar, one of the world leaders most eloquent on the threat of 
these new non-national or post-national movements, called the 
syndrome abroad in the world the "new anarchy" and he 
characterized it as "armed force, both overt and covert, used and 
increasingly justified as a legitimate means of obtaining 
national objectives.

There were many kinds of irregular movements and many kinds 
of armies. There were Marxist guerrilla movements in Central 
America and elsewhere and there were street gangs and death 
squads who bore no resemblance to the Return-to-the-Past 
movements. But the important point was that, of all the violence 
in the world, the single most violent and threatening 
type of group were the Return-to-the-Pasters.

, certainly not new to history, was explained most sensitively by 
the great 20th century Mexican philosopher, LeoP0140

the difficult but not impossible task of untangling his 
situation, he prefers to escape and to take no cognizance of the

"He then begins to imagine worlds without complications, 
worlds without previous history, worlds in which each individual 
can begin to realize his history as he would have it. Or, these 
worlds appear as virgin worlds in which everything is still to be 
done and thus full of possibilites. In short, they seem to be

Still, even given this historic search of man in all 
cultures, religions and times to exercise the utopian yearning 
and to create utopias (sometimes related to the purity of the 
past and sometimes, as Communism, related to a supposedly perfect 
future), how can we analyse what is happening today and why. Why

Actually, what has happened is quite understandable when one 
looks at the whole phenomenon historically. 
The post-World War II period saw the massive and hemorrhagic 
breakup of the great colonial empire of the European powers. But 
often--although it was not so obvious at the time--the former 
entities were broken up into only supposedly modern "nation-
states." In truth, these entities soon would come to be seen as 
quite simply unnatural for peoples who still thought of 
themselves in terms of tribes, of clans, or religions or even of 
islands. At the same time, the Great Powers' ability to "keep 
peace in the world broke down because the industrialized nations 
were themselves psychologically and structurally fragile on the 
inside.

World---The "Bung" Sukarnos of Indonesia, the Gamal Abdul Nassers 
of Egypt, the Jawaharlal Nehrus of India---simply assumed that 
progress would follow, as night the day, after independence. It 
was only the colonial masters who had held these peoples back. 
Only that was not what happened. In the first age in the 
history of mankind where virtually ALL peoples (or, at least, 
their leadership groups) suddenly believed that they could throw 
away the shackles of the fatalism of the past and ?progress,' the 
fact was that most of them did not. It was really quite simple, 
if sad. 
They did not have modern work habitaf, iiey did not have 
societal organizations tOorOtiriaie for the creation;of.weidAih and 
, 
the care of it and they did not have the all-necessary. Judeo-
Christian or Confucial work ethic. It was not at all unnatural 
that, in their diappointemnt and frustration over 
"modernization," leaders and peopls would in different gays 
decide that the fault lay in the fact that , along the way when 
they were lusting over the new God of "progress," they had turned 
their backs on their past gods. Now they would return to the 
past---or try to---and they would beg its pardon with a vengeance. 
One of the best analysts I have found of this inevitable 
consequence is Sherif Latfy, an Egyptian developmentalist who is 
the leading advisor to the Sultan of Oman, a country which is 
progressing with unusual wisdom and foresight. "The 'thing' will 
always be there," Latfy told me one day, sitting in his simple 
office in the picturesque old capital of Muscat. The 'thing' was 
the imbalance that Cane, inexorably, when countries put

themselves into this kind of pressure cooker of social change. 
"If it were not 'Islam,' it would be called something else," 
he went on. "It is simply somethng that comes with modern life. 
The frustration becomes bigger in the developing countries. You 
find people are frustrated with change---or without it. The more 
development you do, the more frustrated people become. Hundreds 
of years ago, noone knew what development was or what life in the 
U.S. was. The more development, the more impossible life becomes. 
"what do you do? There is no economic solution to it. I can 
say, in many cases, 
what the world should have 
done but no 
matter what you do, there often, is- no file 
through the transitional period? Noone really knows. 
Then he leaned back in his chair in his office and ruminated 
over the violent IslamiC fUndamentalists who had killed Egyptian 
. . . 
President Anwar Sadat. "Look at those men," he said. "They were 
the people brought to school by the government---so naturally 
they are going to blame the government for everything." 
The other man whom I have found who best interpreted what 
happened to the individual soul in these countries when faced by 
the impossible challenge (or is it really a threat?) of 
modernization---a modernization usually represented by the United 
States---was the late psychoanalyst who is often called the 
successor to Freud, Dr. Heinz Kohut of Chicago. Speaking of the 
particular Iranian experience, which is so key to all the Return-
to-the-Past experiences, Kohut told me; 
"The specifics of that tension arise from the attempt to

living a demeaning kind of existence leading to low self-esteem. 
"Then came the Shah in Iran, Ataturk in Turkey, Nasser in 
Egypt. In order to make their people more capable of self-
respect, the message is 'Modernize!' But if the changes made are 
made abruptly, within one or two generations, that threatens the 
continuity of the ethnic self. It is much like the individual 
self. We were once children--then ado1i0Ofnts--then mature 
adults. When a person feels discontinuous, that is a terribly 
Painful feeling. You do not hang together. SIOPla will do almost

there is a sense of tremendous healing. They will do anything for

"Then there is a degree of sadism that is mobilized--give 
them (the foreign agents of change) a dose of that medicine that 
they inflict on others. They feel shamed by us, so they need to

us, because they are at that stage of development where their 
goals are compatible with dying. Ours are not. We can't say we'll

Then he summed up what the West---really just be existing as 
"the" example of the "modernization" that was so hounding these 
peoples from one end of the globe to the other---implicitly has 
done to the poor and struggling countries: "We took a picture of 
their poverty." 
Lest anyone think ("dream" would be a better verb) that 
these movements end with Khomeini or are about to wither away 
into the sun of modern times, here are solo key examples of 
the "Return-to-the-Past movements all around, us and some of the

---It was Miami in July, 1984. Perry Rifkind, the diredtOr 
of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service there, was 
talking about the floods of peoples from other countries who were 
pouring into the U. illegally through his state. Suddenly, he 
paused and said, without any particular emphasis, "And then there 
are the Sikhs...." 
Sikhs? Bearded religious Sikhs from the prosperous Punjab in 
northern India? Sikhs who believe in a religious that is a unique 
mixture of Hinduism and Islam? 
"Yes," he went on, obviously puzzled, "they have been coming 
in for the last two years. We've apprehended hundreds of them. 
They come through a network that gets them through the British 
Commonwealth countries easily and eventually to the Bahamas. From 
there, it is easy for them to come here illegally by boat." 
Then he paused and shook his head. "It is odd," he summed

for some time. Most of them have a lot of money---five, ten 
thousand dollars. Some have testified to us that they were told 
by the Sikh movement to go underground in California, where there 
is a big Sikh community, and to wait for orders...." 
What had happened was that the Sikh independence movement in 
the Punjab---which then went on to assassinate Indian Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi, moderate Sikh leaders and many others and 
to plan to assassinate her successor, Rajiv Gandhi, while he was 
in Washington---had relocated in the United States and Canada.

It was only when, in June, 1985, those radical Sikhs were 
accused of kiiiiing 329 peoplebe detonating a bomb in an Air-
India plane, that I began to look into this fascinating, ominous 
and strangely untold story. I found incredible materials and from 
all sides. I found that that spring, 35 Indian Sikhs had been 
apprehended in (of all places!) Houston, trying to slip through 
with illegal (of all countries!) Dutch passports. They were sent 
back. 
I found that, yes indeed, most of the radical Sikhs had been 
trained behind the Iron Curtain: in the U.S.S.R., in Bulgaria, in 
Poland, Yugoslavia and Cuba. I found that the new Prime Minister 
Rajiv Gandhi knew this and that it was most definitely 
cooling -his warm relations with the Soviets. And I found a 
pattern not at all unlike the patterns of kindred movements in

What led to the Freudian death of Indira, "India's mother," 
and perhaps began to presage the long-propheSied and feared (by 
Mahatma Gandhi, among many others) disintegration of the 
subcontinent that is India was actually quite clear and typical. 
First, secularized lifestyles had been spreading among the young 
Sikhs. More and more young men were shaving off their sacred 
beards and refusing to wear the Sikh turbans. 
In trying to salvage their interests in a time of feared 
changes, the traditional clergy reacted by trying to ignite a new 
fundamentalism. However, their efforts?and even those of the 
once-radical Independence Party, the Akan Dal--soon were 
overshadowed by ultriiradical Sikh led by the ferocious Jarnail 
Singh Bhindranwale. When he and his men took over the sacred 
Golden Temple, they wide it into a sanctuary for murderers and 
terrorists who cdukd not there(they thought) be touched. 
Instead, Indira had her troops scourge them out of the 
temple. Attempted negotiations between the central government and 
the moderate Sikhs had long been broken off, poisoned by the 
deliberately planned excesses of the radicals. Indira was 
assassinated. Once again, the acts of fanatics were able to 
overwhelm and control the acts of moderates and thus destroy the 
center! 
And the Soviet interest? Ah, there is the mystery. There in 
no question at all about the training. ANd that is in Soviet 
style, even with "friends." It could be a warning to India not to 
move too far Westward in its thinking and loyalties. Or---it 
could be the first step in the Soviet-backed but locally

---In 1980, a hitherto unknown and unexpected movement burst 
upon always schizphrenic Peru, a physically glorious country 
divided still in its soul between the descendants of the great 
Inca Empire and the descendants of the brutal and greedy Spanish 
Conquistadores who destroyed that empire in the 16th century. By 
the time a dynamic and young new President was inaugurated in 
1985, the Aprista Party's Alan Garcia, Peru was a traumatized and

Lenin's description of COMMUni8M. The movement, which started 
around a remote university in the historic city of Ayacucho where 
the great battle for the ifidhiOehOentes of Latin America was fought 
by the great Bolivar in 1824. 
The movement actually was started at the National - 
University, a colonial university of Ayacucho that was newly 
reopened after being closed for 80 years. The Marxist professor 
who led it/ the charismatic Abimael Guzman Reynoso, a philosophy 
teacher, as early as 1962 had sent some students to Cuba for 
training. At that time/ this nucleus of the group was more 
Chinese-oriented than anything and they were definitely oriented 
for the long term. Then, in 1980/ they came to the fore in 
murderous and sanguinary ways that make them comparable only to 
Cambodia's Khmer Rouge, which in power killed upwards of 3

million or half of the Cambodian population. 
Not only did they burn ballot boxes to show their disdain 
for democracy, they hung dogs from the lampposts of Lima and 
Ayacucho against, ironically, that revisionist dog," the Chinese 
leader Deng Xiaoping. Then they began to kill. They bombed, they 
caused massive power blackouts. They went into villages and wiped 
out Indians, repeating centuries of terror. And the confused and 
terrified government responded with their own killings. The 
country turned into a kind of natibnal terror.

the American diplomat, and writer. Prof. David Scott Pallor, who

taught in AricpChO-An,thm'formative years of the early 1960s has 
written; 
"The major effect of the changes within Peru over the past 
forty years...was to bring into the national system a much larger 
proportion of the total population. That means that the vast 
majority of Peruvian citizens are now in a position to make 
demands on the system--and do so. A government's staying power is 
thus increasingly dependent on its ability to respond to the 
concerns of the PEruvian citizenry." 
The demand had been created and was there---that devil of 
the new demand for "progress" and for modernization---but the 
Peruvian government, like so many other governments, simply could 
not satisfy it. Peru went through* 1.) democracy in the early

democracy again in the late 1970s. None of them could keep up 
with the demand. 
As Palmer outlined, "With the exception of the 1979-1981 
period, net economic growth has been negative, wage settlements 
have fallen behind the cost of living, and inflation rates have 
increased from a 20-30% range to a 75-125% range... The lower 
strata of society have clearly lost their incremental gains with 
the shrinking of the economic pie." One spontaneous answer of the 
people was the "informal economy, another indicator of the 
failures of nation-states and of ominous problems ahead--two

But remote and beautiful AyactichO, forgotten for ao long, 
had awakened IA those years---or perhaps we should say, "half-
awakened.' In the early 1608, Ayacucho became a kind of model for 
development policies. The American Peace Corps cam* there to show 
what could be done. Europeans came. The Peruvian Peace Corps, 
Cooperacion Popular, came. Cooperatives were formed and roads 
were built. 
Then came the 1968 military coup, and the Americans and most 
of the Europeans withdrew. Ayacucho was half-awakened. Into that 
quicksand of awakened expectation, the Sendero Luminoso stepped, 
now with no competitors. It remains today the most serious threat 
to PEruvian society, and thus to the Andean countries themselves. 
But, although the Sendero was started along semi-Marxist 
tenets (which is natural, since those are virtually the only ones 
which offer a sure pattern for totalistic revolutionary takeover

of a state), it is important to see that it, too, is spiritually 
irredentist. It is another classic example of "Return-to-the-
Past." 
"Sendero is fighting not for adjustments in the system which 
will work ?for the benefit of the grievants at the periphery but 
for the total overthrow of the system itself," Prof. Palmer has 
written. "It is also different in that it is the first full-blown 
rural rebellion in Peru guided by Communist principles. In its 
ideology and in its strategy for taking power, it consciously and 
quite proudly follows the principles and practices of Mao.

inwardly-waiting descendants of the longsuffering Incas have for 
centuries, that there is a "Hidden Inca" under the mountain 
who---in this millenarian hope---will emerge soon to return them 
to the glories of the Inca Empire destroyed so long ago! 
---When Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was killed in 1981, 
shot down by some of his own soldiers---the boys he always called 
"my sons"---people began looking around for reasons for this 
bizarre and heinous deed. 
To the West, Sadat was the hero, the peace-maker, the 
inspirer. The world reeled with shock. How could something like 
this happen? Why? Who WERE these "boys" with the wild eyes and 
the self-righteously sure vision?

---A first solution is to do everything possible to develop 
the countryside and the smaller cities so that the capitals are 
not overwhelmed--and overwhelming. Ironically, Sadat was trying 
precisely to do that, but he did not act quickly enough to stem 
the extraordinary population pressure that made his efforts 
virtually hopeless. 
--Second, socieites should watch for the dangerous 
formation of dual socieites or "two cultures" within them.
