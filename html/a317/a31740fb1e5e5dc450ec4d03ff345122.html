PROPAGANDIST'S GUIDE to COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS 
411( 
#55 Commentary 26 May-8 June 1965 
Principal Developments: 
1, The Chinese Communists continue to press their political/propaganda 
offensive against the Soviet and Yugoslav "revisionists," the Indian "re-
actionaries," and the U.S. "imperialists." Most aggressive are: (a) a 
speech incorporating the most extreme Chinese charges against the Soviet 
leadership delivered by Peng Chen, chief of the Chicon delegation to the 
Indonesian Party's 45th anniversary, at the PKI's Aliarcham Academy; (b) 
a People's Daily Observer article expanding NCNA's earlier denunciation 
of the Shastri visit to Moscow; (c) further expansion of the Chinese cam-
paign against "brutal suppression of Asian, African and Latin American 
students" by the Yugoslav authorities; and (d) an interview given to a 
French journal by Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yl maintaining that Chinese 
anti-Soviet polemics are making a positive contribution to the Vietnam situ-
ation. Peking also lists 9 world languages in which it is distributing its 
March book, Polemics on the General Line of the ICM (which includes 11 major 
attacks on the CPSU previously published as separate pamphlets, as described 
In #49). And as the period ends, Premier Chou En-lai is in Tanzania on 
another visit apparently aimed partiortlarly at building support for the 
Chinese line at the 29 June Afro-Asian Conference II ("Bandung") in Algiers 
(though he hurried back to China on the next day, after expected invitations 
for subsequent African visits apparently did not materialize). 
2. In introducing Peng Chen at Aliarcham, Indonesian CP Chairman Aidit 
admits that the PKI follows "the pronouncements and attitudes of the CCP 
toward modern revisionism," -- even though "sometimes we are not quick 
enough in understanding" them! 
3. The Albanians publish four more major attacks on the Soviet leader-
ship, one of which spreads its fire to include the Italian revisionists. 
4. Meanwhile, the CPSU/USSR continues to take a public stance of re-
straint in the face of these inflammatory provocations. Even while pro-
testing Peng Chen's truly outrageous conduct in abusing Indonesian hospi-
tality to attack another PKI guest from a PKI rostrum, the Soviets are 
defensive and refrain from any counter-charges. Behind-the-scenes Soviet 
political activity is indicated, however, in visits of high-level Party 
delegations to Bulgaria and France and a Marshal Grechko-led military 
mission to Rumania, plus talks in Moscow with a Kadar-led Hungarian dele-
gation and a North Korean military mission, which is granted a new military 
aid pact. There are further indications of (somewhat belated) Soviet in-
tent to press for participation in the Algiers Afro-Asian Conference II.

5. French and Italian CP chiefs met secretly in Geneva (24-25 May) 
while the CPSU delegation was in France (19-31 May), -- and just a week 
before delegations of all West European CPs were to meet in Brussels. 
(We have had no report on the Brussels meeting as yet.) 
6. The Rumanian leadership surprisingly decides in plenum to change  
the name to Rumanian Communist (instead of Workers) Party, to correspond 
with the current stage of development of Rumanian socialism.

CHRONOLOCa -- COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS 
#55 26 May-8 June 1965 
May 25 (delayed): Albanian Party monthly theoretical journal 
Partise No. o features a 23?000-word editorial: "The Modern Revision-
ists, Greatest Liquidators in the History of the ICM." (Also published 
in daily Zen. I Ponu3lit in. 2 parts, 25 & 26.) It is a ponderous attack 
on the Italian Communist. debate published in Einascita in recent months, 
centering around the controversialliendsamt2a.ak on the need for 
creating an entirely new "strAILLarty of the left" in the 28 November 
issue. The editorial ties this development to the "ill-famed 20th CPSU 
Congress" and refers back to the 7 April 1964 ZIP article. entitled "The 
Modern Revisionists on the Road of Social Democratic Degeneration and a 
Merger with Social Democracy." (Chrono #27). It then turns to the 
4 February 1965 Pravda article, "The Communists and the Social Democrats," 
(Chrono #47) and. asks: "Can one not see learly were Ame.1.2a212....mt his 
laulztion?" It answers itself: "Rialuarties are unanimous in declar-
ing that to sabotage the proletarian revolution in thecapitalist coun-
tries and to restore capitalism in the socialist countries, the revolu-
tionary Party of the working class must be 1iaa-2.date1 at all costs." 
"But the liquidating positions of Amendola, of the revisionist 
leadership of the Italian CP, and of the Khrushchevite revisionists, 
have become the positions of all international modern revisionism. 
Thus the discussion within the ICP about the 'single party', the 
new, perfidious and liquidating step by Amendola, is by no means a 
unique and isolated phenomenon. It represents, in fact, one of the 
aspects, and perhaps the most typical and the clearest one, of a 
whole newcam2a1.01 which has been started by all modern revision-
ists for rapprochement., collaboration and fusion with social demo-
31.ax This emerges from the decisions, resolutions, and discussions 
with the various revisionist parties of Western Europe. This is 
clearly demonstrated by the round-table discussions on the problems 
of 'unity of the workers and the democratic movement in the capital-
ist countries' organized by the international revisionist journal 
Problems of Peace and Socialism, discussions which were published in 
issues Nos. 1 and 2 of this year." 
May 25-Jy.122_2 (continuing from #54, May 7..24): Party delegations to the 
Ipdonesian CP's 24.121.2,m_ite_r_ celebration busily engage in local po-
litical activity. Most active and controversial is the Chinese delega-
tion, headed by Politburo member and CC Secretary Peng Chen, whose 25 May 
22a.e.sh at the PKI 's Aliarcham Academy of Social Sciences turned into an 
anti-Soviet harangue incorporating the most extreme Chinese charges 
against the CPSU leadership, including passages such as the following:

"Khrushchev revisionism is gisiniagEatIng the socialist camp, 
alituRE the ICM, sabotaging the national liberation movement and 
the people's revolutionary movement in all countries, lulling the  
vigilance of the people of the world, and Rapying_the role of a 
..qzsial detachment of the U.S. iuerialists and all reactionaries 
By all this, the K. revisionists have set themselves against the 
masses of the people who comprise more than 90% of the world's 
population .... 
K. revisionism is tl-e_2.12,21211.21.1122_2alltalist forces in the 
Soviet_Union. With K's coming to power, a bourgeois privileged 
stratum gradually came into being (It) has completely divorced 
itself from the Soviet people .... K and his like are the political 
representatives of this bourgeois privileged stratum .... 
K's successors are more prafty than K .... They think 
that acting stealthily may be better for them Precisely be-
cause the K. reviuionists are putting on more subtle camouflage and 
are more deceptive, it is all the  more incumbent on the M-16 to 
e2cPcse the essence falie 
their However numerous the 
metamorphoses of the K. revisionists, they will eventually reveal 
their true features as monsters." 
Introducing Peng, PKI Chairman Aidit says that "the PKI and the CCP 
are like nails and fingers" and explains that: 
"It is true that sometimes we are not quick enough in under-
standinz pronouncements by the CCP_Against modern revi-
sionism; we must first read these pronouncements over and over 
again and study them thoroughly. This is generally because we do 
not have a complete grasp of the overall situation. However, lati-
matel we are able to understand these pronouncements thoroughly. 
Based on this experience, we consider the ronouncements and atti-
tudes of the CCP toward modern revisionism as a 'signal' light which 
serves as our beacon and guide." 
Just before its departure from Djakarta on the 4th, the CPSU dele-
ag_Liar. issues a terse statement briefly thanking "the Indonesian Commu-
nists and all friends of the Soviet Union" for their welcome and then 
T.S(2,L2E1_,, Pen's "provocative andanderousattacla" at Aliarchaml 
"The CPSU delegation files its protest in view of the fact 
that an authoritative representative of the CCP, While misusing the 
hospitality of the PKI, has used the forum it was given for improper 
and offensive attacks a ainst the CPSU, whose delegation isa alalit 
of the Indonesian Commnnists ...."

"Nevertheless, there need be no doubt that any efforts to 
undermine the friendship between Soviet and Indonesian Communists, 
to undermine the anti-imperialist unity between the Soviet Union 
and Indonesia, are bound to end in failure." 
Nhy 26: A Radio Pekin-, broadcast (in English to South Asia) lists nine 
'foreign languages in which the People's Publishing House has issued its 
book Polemics on the General Line of the ICM: English, French, Spanish, 
German, Itissian, Japanese, Indonesian, Vietnamese and Arabic. This vol-
ume is a collection of 11 "vit1 articles"r2...sy.L.;iss_a published as sepa-
rate pamphlets -- the 1.4=1.57-0rP7itter to the CPSU, the nine edi-
torials in the series of "Comments on the Open Letter of the CPSU," and 
the November 1964 "Why Khrushchev Fell" -- plus the CPSU letter to the 
CCP of 30 March 1963 and the CPSU open letter of 14 July 1963 (see Chrono 
i49 for first Chinese notice of publication of this volume on 5 March). 
A CPSU delegation headed by leading theoretician Suslov 
pays "a visit" to Sofia to "acquaint themselves with the activities of 
the BCP and exchange experiences." In a 13,000-word speech at a 2 June 
meeting (published in Sofia Rabotnichesko Delo on 4th and Pravda on 
5th), Suslov attributes difficulties in the ICM to differences in eco-
nomic development, historical traditions, and political conditions. He 
warns against "every attempt at artificially erecting a wall between 
'one's own' CP" and the rest of the movement, and says that no "detach-
ment" will be able to solve any task "if it isolates itself, if it re-
tires into its national shell, if it passes on to a platform of national 
egoism."

May 27.: Pravda 5,000-word Sevastyanov article on 45th anniversary of 
Lenin's book Left.,Win Communism An Infantile Disorder says that "the 
entire contents of the book "were intended to strengthen unity" and shows 
that Lenin would be on the CPSU's side in the dispute with the Chinese. 
However, it does not mention the Chinese by name and is generally re-
strained and conciliator in tone. 
An Observer article in Pe.2EaLLEgIE expands baluz on the 21 May 
NONA comment on Indian Prime-kinister Shastri's visit to Moscow (Chrono 
IW), concluding: 
"The more K's successors fraternize with the Indian reaction-
aries, the more clearly will their revisionist face be exposed.

than K.?" 
The French CP announces that its chief Rochet and Italian CP chief 
Longo had conferred secret in Geneva777TR31-On a wide range of 
subjects, -- not identified. 
May 28: NCI IA reports an interview given by Chinese Vice Premier (and 
Foreign Minister) Chen Yl to correspondent K.S. Karol for the French 
journal Nouvel ObserNsteur on the Vietnam problem. One question is: 
"Do you not think that the saemics (between People's China and the USSR)

"This is not mx_ylpw .... The the the people of the

revolutionary, and capitulationist attitude of the Soviet leadership"

LEADERSHIP PROBLEMS  
IN COMMUNIST CHINA  
25X1C10b 
SITUATION: An official Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman has 
denied the recent spate of rumors that Mao Tse-tung is seriously ill. 
But the fact remains that Mao was 71 years old last December, and that 
he certainly is infirm and under the constant watch of medical attend-
ants. His current prolonged absence from public view has encouraged 
speculation that his poor health now keeps him from performing even 
routine ceremonial duties. However, Mao's health at this or any other 
particular moment merely symbolizes the crucial fact that China will 
very soon face a succession problem, not only in transferring power 
from Mao to his individual successor, but also the far more complex task 
of passing authority from one generation to another. Totalitarian so-
cieties have always shown themselves to be ill-equipped to deal with 
these problems. Some quarters contend that the history of the Chinese 
Communist party suggests that the CPC will be able to achieve these im-
mensely complex tasks without much difficulty. When Lenin died and 
again when Stalin died, it was also contended that the remaining Com-
munist leaders were firmly united in their determination to carry on the 
policies of the dead leader, and yet in both cases, the former subordi-
nates of the late departed were soon deeply divided and engaged in life 
and death struggles for power. 
The Chinese have attempted to ease the situation by grooming Liu 
Shao-chi as Mao's appointed successor. In 1959 Mao turned over to Liu 
the Chairmanship of the Government while retaining the more important 
post of the Party Chairman. Liu however is 67, nearly as old and frail 
as Mao and even if he should achieve a successful takeover from Mao, his 
would necessarily be a caretaker administration. Liu certainly does not 
have the status to appoint his own successor as Mao had done, so the 
question of his successor can be expected to be even more problematical 
to the remaining leaders. 
Only two other men besides Liu appear as possible candidates to 
succeed Mao. They are Premier Chou En-lai and Party General Secretary 
Teng Hsiao-ping. Both of these men are about the same age as Liu and 
neither of them is likely to challensphim so long as Mao is alive. 
Whether they would willingly accede to his leadership during a critical 
period after Mao's death remains to be seen. Peking's Mayor Peng Chen 
and Foreign Minister Chen Yi are dark horses who would assume increased

prominence on the demise of any one of the Party leaders mentioned 
above. (See unclassified attachment for biographic sketches of high-
ranking Chinese Communist leaders.) 
The average age of the 18 Politburo members is over 66 and Most 
of them are in,their late 60's or early 70's. No attempt has been 
made to bring younger, second-echelon leaders into the higher bureauc-
racy gradually and train them for ultimate leadership. On the contrary, 
a strenuous effort seems to have been made to keep them out. The top 
40 men in the Party are all in the older age-group, and even in the 
layer below these men, the majority is in the 55-60 bracket. There is 
twofold significance in these facts: First, the younger men may react 
strongly when the legendary Mao departs the scene. Their long frustra-
tion at being kept away from the seat of power may acme to the surface 
and cause them to rebel against the "Yenan Caves" mentality of their 
elders. Second, the advanced age of all of the immediate contenders 
for the top post may mean that the top post will change hands several 
times in the next few years, and the competition might enhance con-
siderably the influence of this younger group as the competing factions 
vie for support against their antagonists. The most important question  
therefore is not who will succeed Mao, but haw many times in the next  
few years will the leadership change hands, and how long will it take  
before power is transferred to the hands of the next generation. 
The old men who rule China have become increasingly alarmed by 
what they consider the flagging revolutionary zeal of the younger peo-
ple; and they have undertaken an intensive indoctrination campaign to 
remedy the situation. The course of events in the Soviet Union since 
the death of Stalin has made them painfully aware of what might happen 
to their own revolution once they are gone; it has made them fear that 
their successors will grow soft and betray the sacred trust of carrying 
the revolution to the rest of the world. Their alarm is probably the 
best evidence that there is at least some possibility for a change in 
the attitude of China's future leaders. If the hard, doctrinaire in-
flexibility of the current leaders appears to the younger generation 
to pay off in the desired results, that generation can fully be expected 
to continue the pattern, and. even to increase Communist China's arrogant 
militarism and interference in the affairs of other countries. If, how-
ever, today's leaders meet firmness and resolution in all their attempts 
to foist their views on their neighbors and on developing nations around 
the world, it may be possible to convince the next generation that its 
best prospects lie in devoting their full attention to their own internal 
affairs and solving the vast problems that have 'plagued the Chinese peo-
ple for so many centuries.

Red Spies in the UN  
by Pierre J. Huss al)Z.T_ George Carpozi, Jr. 
1965. Coward-McCann, Inc., 200 Madison Avenue, 
New York 16, N.Y. Indexed. Illustrated. 
287 pages. $5.50 
As the title suggests, this book concerns the use of official and 
diplomatic status by Communist intelligence officers. The authors, two 
well-known journalists, obtained a number of incriminating photos on 
Communist espionage cases from the United States Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation (FBI), and included them with the FBI's permission. Some 
of the photos show the Communist UN officials in the act of making 
clandestine rendezvous with espionage agents. 
The book relates more than a dozen cases of Communist espionage 
and conspiracies to commit espionage in the United States, all conducted 
under the shelter of the UN missions of the Soviet Union, and of some of 
its satellites. The first known case of espionage involving a Soviet 
employee of the United Nations occurred in 1949, when Valentin Gubitchev, 
an engineer attached to the Secretariat, was arrested with an American 
woman, Miss Judith Coplon. Gubitchev had conspired with Miss Coplon to 
steal highly classified official documents from the United States Depart-
ment of Justice. A court found Gubitchev guilty, and he was sentenced 
to 15 years in prison, but the U.S. Department of State intervened, and 
asked that the court suspend the sentence provided that Gubitchev agree 
to leave the country, a condition waich the latter accepted. Mis Coplon 
received the same sentence, but it was later reversed on a technicality, 
and she was freed. 
As subsequent events have shown, Gubitchev was but the first of a 
long succession of Soviet and other Communist officials working at the 
UN (either as officials of national delegations or as employees of the 
UN itself) who have been caught spying, and been sent home as a result. 
Again and again, the book shows, the protection afforded by the UN to 
the foreign nationals employed there has been abused by the Communist 
Bloc. 
One of the most spectacular cases related involved a 1962 attempt 
by Cubans to sabotage oil installations in New Jersey, and to create 
terror in a large New York department store by causing an explosion. 
According to the authors, there is strong evidence that the Soviets 
masterminded the whole plot, although this was never alleged in court. 
The book concludes with a Soviet espionage operation which was ex-
posed in 1963. It involved two Soviet agents, living together as man 
and wife, who had "borrowed!' the identities of two American citizens, 
unbeknownst to the latter. In fact the man whose name was used by the 
Soviet agent in Washington, D.C. was actually a Catholic priest in

Amsterdam, New York. The case was solved largely because the FBI had 
information that Petr Egorovich Maslennikov, First Secretary of the 
Soviet Mission to the United Nations in 1962-63, was actually a Soviet 
Military Intelligence officer, and kept him under surveillance almost 
from the moment of his arrival in the United States in January, 1962. 
Through their surveillance of Maslennikov, the FBI agents noticed the 
strange couple in Washington, D.C., who were using the names of two 
American citizens, and checked extensively on their backgrounds. In 
this way they learned that the couple were really Soviet citizens, who 
had somehow managed to enter the United States illegally, and that they 
were involved in espionage against the United States. Maslennikov evi-
dently became aware that he was being watched, for he abruptly ceased 
both his espionage activity and his official work at the UN, and de-
parted for the Soviet Union. However, another Soviet national, Ivan 
Dmitrievich Egorov, who was involved, but who did not hold diplomatic 
status, was arrested, as were the couple who were using other people's 
names, and were discovered to be couriers for a Soviet spy ring operat-
ing in New York and WashirCcrun. 
The book is as exciting as most fictional epy thrillers and has the 
advantage of being true. Unfortunately, it is marred by occasional 
slight errors such as giving a date incorrect17. nrertheless, the 
book is well worth reading, and should be rec;:i by those intcrestDd in 
preserving the United Nations, and keeping it -,ree of Cold War activi-
ties detrimental to its main mission of preserving the peace.

United Nations Disarmament Commission 
Resolution Passed 15 June  1965 . 
The DisarmanPnt Commission, 
Having considered the report dated 17 September 1964 of the Eighteen-
Nation Disarmament Committee submitted to the United Nations Disarmament 
Commission and to the nineteenth session of the General Assembly, 
Reaffirming the ultimate and continuing responsibility of the United 
Nations for disarmament, 
Noting with regret that during 1964 despite the efforts made by the 
Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee no specific agreements were reached 
either on general and complete disarmament or on measures aimed at the 
lessening of international tension, or halting and reversing the arras race, 
Deploring that, notwithstanding General Assembly resolutions 1762 
(XVII) and 1910 (XVIII), nuclear weapon tests have taken place and also 
that no agreement has been reached on the QTE discontinuance of all test 
explosions of nuclear weapons for p11 tine UNQTE, which is one of the 
stated objectives of the partial test-ban treaty, 
Considering that the memorandum of 14 September 1964 submitted to 
the Conference of the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee by the dele-
gations of Brazil, Burma, Ethiopia, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Sweden and the 
United Arab Republic, represents a fair and sound basis for the conduct of 
negotiations towards removing the remaining differences for the conclusion 
of a comprehensive test-ban treaty, 
Convinced that failure to conclude a universal treaty or agreement 
to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons leads to the most serious 
consequences, 
Deeply conscious of the urgency of making early progress towards the 
goal of general and complete disarmament under effective international 
control and of reaching agreement on measures which would facilitate the 
attainment of that goal, 
Bearing in mind the proposals made at its present session for measures 
to reduce international tension and halt and reverse the arms race, and 
also at the meeting of the Organization of African Unity and the Second 
Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, 
Recalling the principle that a substantial part of the resources that 
will be released through disarmament should be devoted to the economic and 
social development of the developing countries, thus contributing to the 
evolution of a safer and better world,

I. Reaffirms the call of the General Assembly upon all States to 
become parties to the Treaty banning nuclear weapon tests in the atmos-
phere, in outer space and under water, and to elide by its spirit and 
provisions; 
2. Recommends that the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee should: 
. (a) reconvene as early as possible to resume as a matter of 
urgency its efforts to develop a treaty on general and complete dis-
armament under effective international control, and to consider all 
proposals for measures to relax international tension and halt and 
reverse the arms race, including those submitted to the Disarmament 
Commission at its present session; 
(b) consider as a matter of priority the question of extending 
the scope of the partial test-ban treaty to cover underground tests; 
(c) also accord special priority to the consideration of the 
question of a treaty or convention to prevent the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons giving close attention to the various suggestions 
that agreement could be facilitated by adopting a programme of cer-
tain related measures; 
(d) keep in mind the principle of converting to programmes of 
economic and social development of the developing countries a sub-
stantial part of the resources gradually released by the reduction 
of military expenditures; 
Requests the Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee to report to the 
Disarmament Commission and to the General Assembly during its twentieth 
session on the progress made in respect of the above recommendations.

Biographical Data 21 June 1965 
MAO Tse-tung 
Chairman of the CCP Central Committee and Politburo; Deputy for Peking to 
the National People's Congress; Honorary Chairman of the CPPCC. 
Since 1935 Mao Tse-tung has been the accepted leader of the Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP). In 1930, Mao put don, in a bloody purge at Fu 
Tien, revolutionaries who opposed his orders and from then his claim to 
the party leadership was only a question of time. 
Mao was born in Hainan in 1893, the son of a middle peasant family, 
and was graduated from Changsa Normal College in 1918. In the summer of 
1920 he became a Marxist and was a delegate to the convention that founded 
the Chinese Communist Party in July 1921. His early years in the Party 
were spent in organizing the peasants and conducting propaganda among them. 
His experiences in these early days led him to develop the thesis for which 
he is now best known, namely, that the peasants were the vital element in 
any successful revolt in an agrarian country like China. This thesis was 
opposed by the party leadership of the time. They were following Soviet 
advice at the time and attempting to conduct a revolution based on the urban 
proletariat. The official Party leadership in Shanghai gradually lost in-
fluence and authority to Mao and his lieutenants and finally joined him in 
Kiangi in 1932. During these years the Communist Army successfully fought 
off four attempts by Chiang Kai-shek's forces to crush it, but a fifth at-
tack forced the Communists to undertake the "Long March" in October 1934--
6,000 miles through Kweichow and the mountainous border provinces to Shensi, 
where a new headquarters was established in 1935 at Yenan. 
The Party extended its control during the Sino-Japanese war (1937-45) 
by guerilla tactics and the mobilization of the patriotic peasantry against 
the Japanese. At the end of the war in 1945 the Communists were thus in a 
stronger position than in 1935. On the establishment of the Central People's 
Government in 1949, Mao became Chairman of the Government Council, of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, (CPPCC), and of the 
People's Revolutionary Military Council. In January, 1953, Mao was Chair-
man of the Constitution Drafting Committee and on the consequent reorganiza-
tion of the government structure in 1954, he was elected Chairman of the 
Republic and ex officio became Chairman of the National Defence Council. 
Mao was seriously ill during 1953 and 1954, and little was heard of 
him until July, 1955, when he came back to call for the rapid full-scale 
socialization of agriculture. After this he remained well in the public 
eye, and all subsequent major policies have been ascribed personally to 
Mao. 
In December, 1958, it was announced that Mao was about to retire from 
the Chairmanship of the Republic "in order to devote himself more to ideo-
logical study." His retirement came in April, 1959. Mao remains Party 
Chairman, appears in public regularly and continues to be treated as the 
leader and father of the Chinese people.

Mao married three times, first in 1919 in Shanghai, his wife being 
executed in 1928. His second wife was with him on the "Long March," 
during which some of her children are said to have been abandoned. One 
was killed in the Korean War, one is evidently a Russian translator at 
a Ministry in Peking, another an army officer in Szechwan. His third 
marriage, to an actress, has produced two daughters. No member of his 
family takes part in public life.
