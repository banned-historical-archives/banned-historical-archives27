INTELLIGENCE HIGHLIGHTS NO, 103 
1 JUNE to 6 JUNE 1950 
SECTION I. SUMMARY OF FAR EAST TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS 
The orderly Korean elections have demonstrated a lack of much popular 
support for either of the Republic's major political factions and have 
left the balance of power in the hands of independents (p. 2). 
The Peiping regime has reiterated its promises of fair treatment for 
capitalists, while continuing policies which make the business community 
despair (p. 3). 
The military situation in North Vietnam appears to be increasingly 
favorable for the French, according to US eye-witnesses (p. 4). 
Burma's Prime Minister has indicated a desire to resign his office 
in July, in order to devote himself to religious activities (p. 5). 
25X1-
The OS may be gravely embarrassed by proposed Indonesian actions in 
support of the insurgent Ho Chi Minh regime in Indochina (p. 6). 
Although the military picture in the Philippines is somewhat brighter, 
political and economic affairs continue to cause gloom (p. 7).

SECTION IIL, DEVELOPENTS IN SPECIFIED AREAS 
KOREA  
Election results--The 30 May elections in southern Korea: while not pro-
ductive of a victory for either of the major political factions, consti-
tuted a significant demonstration Ofthe fact that democratic procedures 
have not been entirely set aside in the Rhee administration's program of 
eliminating subversive Communist elements within the Republic. Some 90 
percent of registered voters participated in the generally quiet and or-
derly elections which independent observers, including the members of the 
UN Commission on Korea, agreed were held in a free and fair atmosphere. 
Pressure by the police and government undoubtedly was exerted in favor 
of selected candidates in local areas but, significantly, several adminis-
tration favorites were defeated, while several umoderate" candidates, 
charged by the Government with pro-Communist views or secret Communist 
support, were elected. 
? In general, the electorate appeared more concerned with important lo-
cal issues such as food and inflation than with the issue of Communism: 
they expressed this concern by failing to support incumbents as well as 
some well-known government officials who were candidates. Results from 
206 of the 210 electoral districts ahow that only 31 of the 164 incumbent 
assemblymen retained their aeata. Indeed, 127 of the newly elected can-
didates are not formally committed to any political group. The opposition 
Democratic Nationalist Party (DNP) dropped from 67 to 25 seats, while the 
pro-administration Great Korean Nationalist Party (GKNP) retained only 
25 of its previous 70. In addition to general voter antipathy toward the 
old Assembly, the unexpectedly heavy losses suffered by the opposition 
DNP may be attributed to the stigma still attached to the Party as repre-
sentative of the conservative land-owning interests. GKNP losses, in 
turn, probably are not attributable so much to that Party's support of 
President Rhea as to its lack of grassroots organization. 
Although the new Assembly will remain predominantly rightist, the 
alignment of the 127 successful "independents', who constitute an unorgan-
ized majority, will not be clear until some months after the Assembly's 
first meeting in mid-June. It is probable that the situation will parallel 
that which followed the 1948 elections, when a large number of independents, 
generally critical of the administration, gathered in a loose coalition 
and held the balance of power between anti-Rhee and pro-Rhee forces. In 
the short term, the election's most significant result is the large turn,. 
over in Assembly membership and the consequent loss of experienced legis-
lators. Althouell the general calibre of the new Assembly probably is higher 
than the previous group, there will be coaaiderable inefficiency and delay 
in the legislative process until the new members find their feet.

CHINA 
Communists plug "private enterprise"?Although most destern observers 
take a dim view of the prospects for private business under the Peiping 
regime, the Communists are once more endeavoring to reassure private 
capitalists regarding their future in China. At a recent Ministry of 
Labor conference, labor boss LI Li-aan declared, "to advance industrial 
progress at present, it is necessary to make use of the private capital-
istic enterprises of the country for a time. Al]. private capital that 
can be used will not only be protected by the government, but will be 
aided." Subsequently, MAO Tse-tung, discussing measures to Clarify the 
relationship between State-run and private companies, asserted that "the 
Government has no intention...to compete with private enterprise." 
Such declarations are reiterations of previous Communist statements 
concerning the role of private capital in China. In the "Common Program" 
adopted last September, the Communists declared that "the People's Gov-
ernment shall encourage the active operation of all private economic 
enterprises beneficial to the national welfare and people's livelihood, 
and foster their development." Recent evidence, however, has indicated 
that such statements are mere lip service to the principles of the "New 
Democracy." Advertisements appearing in the Shanghai press during the 
past few weeks for example, have urged factory managers, who abandoned 
their plants in despair at the difficulties of doing business under the 
Communists, to return to their jobs. Meanwhile, high business taxes, con-
fiscatory exactions of Victory Bond pledges and competition from a growing 
number of State trading enterprises have continued to force many business-
men, who at first believed that business could continue profitable under 
the Communist regime, to seek only the salvage of what little remains of 
their investments. 
Despite this seeming contradiction between Communist promise and pane. 
formance, it appears probable that private enterprise will continue to 
occupy a large motor of the Chinese economy for the next several years. 
Many of the difficulties besetting private firma have not resulted al-
together from deliberate Communist designs. The stagnation of trade, in 
large part a result of the Nationalist blockade, has militated against 
profitable operations by private concerns and induced Communist harass-
ment of business --such as refusal of permission to close shop or dis-
charge workers-- which would not have been necessary under more favorable 
circumstances. A return to higher levels of economic activity in the 
second half of 1.950 should ease some of these difficulties, and it is 
noteworthy that in Manchuria and north China, where economic conditions 
have been more favorable than in the south, recent reports indicate an 
increase in the number of private factories in operation.

Although the Communiats consider it expedient to avoid fladventuris-
tier! measures toward commerce and industry at present and private enter-
prise is allowed in such important sectors of the economy as textile 
manufacture and other light indastries, the trend is unmistakable. 
Thus, businessmen are buying raw materials from government oarporations, 
are looking to gpvernment banks for much of their credit requirement, 
and are dependent in large part on government enterprises as customers of 
their finished products. Moreover, in the field of foreign trade and in 
domestic trade to a lesser extent, private firms are being supplanted 
by state trading corporations, while operat JOAO by private capitalists 
are subject to very restrictive limitations. 
INDOCHINA  
/ailttary situation in Tonkin..-On the basis of first-hand survey of rural 
areas in the Red River delta, US officials have reported that French 
military action has largely cleared the delta and that tens of thousands 
of Vietnamese have been streaming into the cleared area during the past 
two months. Among these persons, antipathy toward the Ho regime is 
strong and the US observers believe that the refugees may form the first 
real peasant support for Bao Dai, particularly if US economic and medical 
assiatencr is judiciously given, North Vietnam's Governor, Nguyen Huu Trio 
an able, efficient, and intensely nationalistic official who has estab-
lished a corps of provincial administrators in his own image, is believed 
tr offer first-class material for the implementation of ouch a US aid pro-
w,. am, although the unpopularity of Premier Tran Van Hull --whose own ball.* 
w.ck of South Vietnam presents almost reverse conditions-- together with 
the exaggerated suspicions of the French regarding US aid, are expected 
to present something of an obstacle. 
Emphasis on food conservation in recent broadcasts by the Ho radio 
indicates that the French strategy of keeping Ho's forces out of the 
rice-rich Red River delta may be showing results. It has been noted, how-
ever, that the majority of the refugees entering the French-held areas 
are old men, women and children, a fact which suggests that the Ho regime 
AWL, be deliberately encouraging the movement in order to increase the 
French burden, while the Resistance concentrates on the development of 
its army and speeds the influx of arms from China. A spectacular rebel 
attack, featuring four 105mm howitzers, was recently launched against the 
French post at Dongkhe, some ten miles from the Sino-Vietnamese frontier, 
and near the headwaters of one of the branches of the Sikiang. Although 
eventually repulsed, the attack showed bath augmented Resistance materiel 
and a determination on the part of Ho 'a forces to weaken French defenses 
along the China border.

BURMA 
Possible Change of Prime giniatere--The Burmese Prime Minister, Thakin Nu, 
has reiterated his Intention of relinquishing public office at the earli-
est opoortunitv in order to devote himself to re1i5riona moditation4 
25X1 
 / Nu has indicated a desire to resign on 19 July 1950 
when he hopes that the "Peace Within One Year Plan" will have been suc-
cessfully fulfilled. 
The lolical successor to Thakin Nu is Lt. Gen. Bo Na Win, the Deputy 
Prime Linister and Commander-in-Chief, who is considered to be already 
de facto head of the Government. It is possible, however, that Na Win 
will prefer someone else to hold the office of Prime Minister, but it will 
be someone who would be amenable to his direction. Besides his control 
over Burma's armed forces, No Win is supported by an important segment of 
the influential Socialist Party. Furthermore, his prestige has been 
greatly enhanced by recent military victories over Karen and Communist 
Insurgents and for the part he played in negotiating the "surrender" of 
the rebellious People's Volunteer Organization. Filially, there is some 
indication of friction between the worldly Ne Win and the ascetic Nu. 
Therefore, should Nu tender his resignation, as he has done in the pasts 
there is a good possibility that it will be accepted this time. 
The only group which could conceivably prevent No Win from dominating 
the Government is the Socialist Party, but such a development is unlikely 
in view of Na kilnoo comparatively strong political and military position, 
the existence of a personal following within the Party, and the Party's 
difficulties with factionalism over whether Burma should accept Western 
aid or seek closer alignment with the Communist world. In any case, it 
is unlikely that a Na Win-dominated Government would effect any immediate 
or drastic modification of present Burmese policies. Such a Government, 
however, would probably tend to be opportunistic and dictatorial, and re-
flect Na din's personal principles and prejudices. Ne ain, who has always 
been bitterly anti-British and will probably continue to regard them with 
deep suspicion, is presently friendly to the US. This attitude is un-
doubtedly motivated, in part, by the general's desire for US military and 
economic assistance, but also denotes hie awareness of the threat to 
Burma's independence posed by Communist China. No din, therefore, whether 
or not he actually assumes the office of Prime Minister, appears to be in 
a position to give Burma greater stability than it has enjoyed in the past 
two years -- at least over the short run. In doing so, however, he is 
likely to make dangerous enemies, including many Socialists, whose party 
he has used to rise to power, and to incur the displeasure of Communist 
China, which heretofore has refrained from openly denouncing the Burmese 
Government.

INDONESIA 
USI views on Indochina problem?Public and parliamentary pressure in Indo- "A" 
nesia has reached a point where the USI may either follow the suggestion 
of a vocal leftist minority in the USI House of Representatives and ex-
tend recognition to the insurgent Ho Chi Ninh regime in Vietnam, or, more 
probably, call for a conference of Asian nations to discuss the Indochina

question. While actual recognition of the Ho regime appears to have been 
postponed for the present as a result of parliamentary maneovering, even 
the calling of a conference by the USI could be expected to be embaras-
sing to the US, 
AO early as 28 March 1950, a notion cialing for immediate recognition 
of the "Democratic Republic of Vietnam", together with the "People's Re-
public of China", was submitted by a group of fifteen pro-Communist mem-
bers of the House. Although the matter was not discussed at that time, 
due to the press of more urgent business, a quite substantial body of 
Indonesian opinion continues to view the Ho regime as genuinely national-
istic and worthy of support. This view has been furthered by the activi-
ties of two of Hole publicity men, Tran Mai and Oang Chan Lieu, who arri-
ved in Djakarta on 8 May and have been busy in the hustings ever since. 
The recognition motion me reintroduced in the House in. late May, at 
which time a substitute motion, ceiling for a further study of the recog-
nition question and preparations for. an intra-Asian conference to seek a 
solution of the Indochina conflict, was Introduced by a conservative leader, 
Nateir. The Nateir motion was adopted on 3 June, in a close vote, 49 to 
38. 
While immediate USI recognition of Ho thus appears to have been post-
poned, the possibility that such action may occur in the future cannot be 
dismissed. Such an action would have a considerably adverse impact upon 
the US position in Indochina and throughout Southeast Asia, might well 
precipitate similar action by Burma and India, and would make it virt1Le:11y 
impossible to arouse that widespread popular confidence in the French-
sponsored Bao Dai regime which 13 believed essential to the success of 
current joint French-US efforts to establish an effective, independent 
and non-Communist Vietnamese state. 
Initiation of an intra-Asian conference on Indochina, in turn, would 
make it well-nigh impossible for either the US or France to continue to 
view the Indochina conflict as purely a domestic problem, of concern only 
to France and the three Indochinese states., If such a conference is cal-
led, Burma and the Philippines probably would participate, and Nehru, who 
is due to arrive in Indonesia shortly, probably mould not hesitate to as-
sume a prominent role. 
PHILIPPINES_

anti-Huk operations are currently somewhat brighter, the political scene 
continues to be dominated by Chn wideninti breach between Vice President

There is now 
eome indication that Lopez' position may be substantially strengthened 
by support from Jose Laurel's opposition Nacionalista Party. Quirino,  
in turn, is also seeking Nacionalieta support\ 
 I The Lopez-
Quirino contest demoralized the recent session of Congress and prevented 
the pasease of important legislation including expanded tax measures. 25X1

In addition to political difficulties, the Philippine Government is 
faced with ever-worsening financial problems. The Government has exhaus-
ted its legal credit with the Central Bank, has drawn heavily from a Gov-
ernment-owned trading bank and has utilized sinking and trust funds. Giusti 
balances are practically all spent and even the new tax measures whinh the 
administration is considering will be insufficient to cover the budgetary 
deficit. Moreover, commodity shortages induced by import controls, com-
