 BIOGRAPHY OF ADMIRAL STANSFIELD TURNER
 Admiral Stansfield Turner, United States Navy, was sworn
 in as Director of Central Intelligence on March 9, 1977.  In this
 position he heads the Intelligence Community (the foreign intelli-
 gence agencies of the United States) as well as directs the
 Central Intelligence Agency.
 A native of Highland Park, Illinois, Admiral Turner entered
 Amherst College in 1941 and, two years later, was appointed to
 the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland.  After
 graduation in 1946 (Class of 1947), he served one year at sea
 before entering Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar for work
 on a master's degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics.
 Following Oxford, he held a variety of sea assignments,
 including command of a minesweeper, a destroyer, and a guided
 missile frigate which he placed in commission.  His shore
 assignments included the Politico-Military Policy Division in
 the-Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, the Office of the
 Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Analysis, the Advanced
 Management Program at the Harvard Business School, and Executive
 Assistant and Naval Aide to the Secretary of the Navy.
 He was selected for promotion to Rear Admiral in May 1970,
 and shortly thereafter assumed command of a Carrier Task Group
 of the Sixth Fleet while serving aboard the aircraft carrier
 USS Independence.  After that, he directed the Systems Analysis
 Division of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations.
 On June 30, 1972, Admiral Turner became the 36th President
 of the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, with the rank
 of Vice Admiral.  During his two-year tenure there, he instituted
 major revisions in the curriculum to strengthen its academic
 content.
 In August 1974 he became commander of the United States
 Second Fleet and NATO Striking Fleet Atlantic.  He served in
 that capacity until August 1975 when he was named to become
 Commander in Chief, Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH),
 with headquarters in Naples, Italy.  Upon assuming that position
 on September 1, 1975, he was promoted to the rank of Admiral.
 He held this command until his departure on March 2, 1977, to
 assume his present duties.

 Dear Admiral Turner:
 It was with 'a great deal of interest .that 1, along.
 with many other. residents -of the North 'Shore of Chicago, .
 read of the designation and confirmation: of. a Highland
 Park native as the'President's-choice to head the Central
 Intelligence Agency-
 I am writing you?as -a member of the Board of Trustees
 of the North Shore Unitarian Church which draws many of. its
 members from Highland Park, Deerfield, Northbrook,' Glenview
 and Lake Forest,  Illinois.-  The Board has 'asked me to in-
 vite you to give.a talk at our Church on a subject in the
 general area of your new governmental responsi'biliti'es.
 In view of the New York Times description ofI.you as 'a man
 "endlessly curious about philosophy, theater, opera, in-
 ternational politics -and militaryaffairs"? I would be 'most-
 hesitant to limit you in the choice *of a topic,:.although
 of course,. your concepts. of national -security and military
 affairs would be-of real interest..
 I would schedule your talk on a Sunday evening of your
 choice, and publicize'it in the 'adjoining suburban communi-
 ties.-  Since our Church "generally enjoys -a summer recess-
 from Mid-June to Mid-September,  I might suggest that if you
 can accept our invitation that you let me- have. a few possible
 dates between now and early Junebr from late September
 tough October, 1977.

 "There is the statesmanship of thought and there is the statesmanship of
 action ... the man who has the time, the discrimination, and the sagacity to
 collect and comprehend the principle facts and the man who must act upon
 them must draw near to one another and feel that they are engaged in a
 common enterprise."
 Woodrow Wilson
 APSA Presidential Address, 1910
 The American Political Science Association is the major professional organization in
 the United States for those devoted to the study of political systems.
 Supported by almost 15,000 individual and institutional members and by grants
 from a growing number of foundations, the Association provides a variety of services to
 members, encourages research, conducts educational programs and generally brings
 together theory and practice in the broad fields of government, politics and public affairs.
 The membership of the,Association is made up chiefly of political scientists teaching
 in the nation's colleges and universities. Also included are lawyers, businessmen,
 journalists, federal, state and local government officials, members and staff members of
 Congress. Overall policy for the Association is established by the membership through its
 elective Officers and Council. Samuel H. Beer, Harvard University, served as President
 in 1976-77. Others who have served in this position since the Association's founding in
 1903 include Woodrow Wilson, James Bryce, John Bassett Moore, Charles A. Beard and
 Ralph J. Bunche.
 The Association maintains a national headquarters and staff in Washington, D.C.
 Purchased in 1966, the Political Science Building provides permanent offices for the
 officers and staff of the Association, from which the various membership services and
 programs are administered. Facilities also include conference and meeting rooms for use
 in Association programs and for other political science groups meeting in Washington
 requesting their use.
 Since its founding in 1903, the Association has organized research in numerous
 undertakings involving broader participation than that of the individual scholar. On
 several occasions it has prepared reports on public issues at the request of the President
 of the United States. In the field of individual research, the Association annually
 recognizes-through cash awards and citations-outstanding books and theses in the field
 of political science.
 The Association conducts numerous educational programs for political scientists,
 secondary school social studies teachers, reporters and public officials. The Association
 also operates a number of general service programs for its members. Included are a
 professional Personnel Service, a registry of retired professors, and term life, accident and
 hospital cash insurance programs.
 The Association publishes the quarterly journal, The American Political Science
 Review, which contains articles reporting recent research, book reviews and research
 notes. PS, also a quarterly, includes news and articles about the profession of political
 science as well as news and notes about individual members. The Association also
 publishes a Biographical Directory of Association Members and a Guide to Graduate
 Study in Political Science.

 THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS
 Government and Politics in America
 John A. Moore, Jr., California State Polytechnic
 Univeristy; Myron Roberts, Chaffey College
 352 pages (approx.) paper
 "The authors have produced a fresh, well-conceived, and complete treatment of the basic elements of
 American politics ... (The book) provides a very good treatment of such topics as 'culture' and 'justice,'
 for example, dramatizing their importance while pointing out their elusiveness...
 Chapter 3 is one of the best treatments of the roots of American political culture I have encountered in
 any book. Students will understand the brighter and darker aspects of the 'American dream' better
 because Moore and Roberts have tied it to the compounded values and experiences of the Puritan
 heritage, the frontier experience, and the great immigration.'-a prepublication review.
 THE RELATIONS OF NATIONS
 Fifth Edition
 Frederick H. Hartmann, Alfred Thayer Mahan Professor,

 clear introduction to the study of international relations. This new edition includes ? three new
 maps ? three new diagrams ? for the first time, a Glossary that gives a concise workable statement on
 each significant technical term ? an extensive updated bibliography.

 How to use an instructional unit that involves students in 1) discovering some pivotal themes in
 normative political theory, 2) learning the elements of courtroom procedure, and 3) clarifying
 perennial issues of jurisprudence. Readings are drawn from political philosophy and ethics, and
 assignments are exercises and a role-playing simulation. The unit is appropriate for upper-division
 courses in political philosophy, political analysis and public law. There is one edition of the unit
 for students and one edition for instructors. Each edition includes readings, exercises and
 instructions on the execution of a simulation exercise.

 governments make decisions about public policy and governments' decision making priorities. Data
 are drawn from national budgets for 14 countries, including the USA, USSR, Western and Eastern
 European nations. Students are taught how to measure budgets; assess different measures; examine
 budgetary expenditures for defense, education, health and welfare; determine budgetary changes

 Short Course 3 .......................... Wednesday 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Edison Suite
 Workshop on Audio Visual Materials, conducted by Dean Myers, Indiana State University; Richard
 Blue, AID; and Gary Hammerstrom, Producer for Zenger Productions. $25.00.
 Faced with students ever more oriented toward non-print media, many political scientists have
 recognized the desirability of introducing audio-visual material into their courses. These same
 political scientists soon become aware of how time-consuming and frustrating a task this can be.
 Becoming familiar with material and hardware, evaluating the material, and finding the most
 fruitful way to integrate such material into coursework have led many to return to a more
 satisfying, substantive, preparation for teaching.
 This workshop is intended to alleviate some of these problems by providing an opportunity to
 share the experience of colleagues who have endured the frustration and worked with the
 audio-visual media. It will provide basic information in an immediately applicable form, and an
 effort will be made to meet some of the specific needs of participants.
 Four media will be considered: motion pictures, sound filmstrips, slide-tape modules, and the
 overhead projector. There will be a discussion of commercially available material and how to find
 it; of techniques for using the media; of problems involved in their use; of production techniques
 requiring minimal skill; and hands on experience with these techniques and associated equipment.

 APSA ORGANIZED SUBFIELDS MEETINGS
 James Q. Wilson and Harvey C. Mansfield, Jr., Harvard University, Chairpersons
 At its meeting in August, 1976, the Council of the APSA requested that the 1977 Program
 Committee "explore the degree of interest in beginning to organize continuing sections" for the
 annual APSA program. The reasons for this request include a desire to provide greater clarity and
 continuity in the program sections and to permit scholars working in those subfields to participate
 more fully in defining the panel topics.
 In response to this request, a series of open sessions will be convened at which scholars in various
 subfields of political science may discuss and make recommendations regarding the feasibility and
 desirability of having permanent, or semi-permanent, sections as is now the case in the American
 Anthropology Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Sociological
 Association.
 Clearly, people will differ as to the specification of subfields. The list below is merely a starting
 point. The main task of subfield definition, however, should be left to those who work in them and
 who may wish to attend the meetings themselves. At some subfield meetings, members may decide
 that they do not wish to become an organized subfield and that more diversity is secured by the
 present system of rapid turnover. In others, those in attendance may express a strong desire for
 permanent organization for the reasons above suggested, but perhaps along lines not envisaged by
 the list below. Members are free to attend as many subfield meetings as they wish.
 We see these meetings as the beginning of an extended exploration of the issue. Each meeting will
 be initiated by a "convenor." At the meeting, those present may elect to choose another
 chairperson, or they may choose to disband forthwith, or they may discuss the issue in general
 terms, or they may formulate detailed recommendations.
 The convenor of each meeting will be responsible for insuring that the meeting is held, that the key
 questions are put to those who attend, and that a report to the Program Committee is written on
 the results of the meeting. The Program Committee will transmit these reports to the Council for
 its consideration. The Council, in turn, may wish to develop criteria for recognizing an organized
 subfield and it may choose to proceed incrementally, authorizing subfields in some areas and not
 others.

 draws together theorists from a variety of schools and approaches. This year (and next) the central
 purpose is to move beyond inutile debates over science (which seldom get beyond the 'last
 chapterism' found throughout critical books and papers that end with promised new horizons to be
 explored in the next report) to efforts to demonstrate how alternative theoretical approaches can
 contribute to political understanding. Each paper should illustrate how a specific theoretical
 approach resolves a political and/or political theory problem. The panels are designed to stimulate
 audience discussion of the general theme in light of the papers. Copies of the papers will be
 available at the panel sessions.
 The specific theme of next year's panels at the 1978 American Political Science Association
 Annual Meeting, "The Relation of Fact and Value in Alternative Political Theories," will parallel
 this year's program. Individuals interested in participating in the 1978 Program should write to

 Eight new political "leaders"
 from Wiley...
 STATECRAFT
 An Introduction to Political
 Choice and Judgment
 Charles W. Anderson,
 University of Wisconsin-Madison
 This decision-making approach to political analysis
 and problem solving emphasizes the viewpoint of the
 participant rather than that of the observer. Anderson
 takes into account the role of the policy maker, then
 the role of the advocate-to show how one should go
 about making a decision concerning a controversial
 problem and defending that decision with reasoned
 arguments. An ideal text for Introduction to Politics
 and other courses on policy.
 (0 471 02896-7)   1977    318 pp.    $11.95
 PEOPLE AND POLITICS
 An Introduction to Political Science
 Herbert R. Winter, Rhode Island College &
 Thomas J. Bellows, University of Arkansas-in
 collaboration with Conrad Waligorski, University
 of Arkansas & Stanley Erikson,
 Professor Emeritus, Augustana College
 This comparative examination of political phenomena
 combines the traditional aspects of the discipline with
 an understanding of modern empirical approaches.
 This systems approach permits the use of political
 features common to all societies and serves as a
 starting point for analysis and discussion.
 (0471 95485-3)    1977    514 pp.    $12.95
 POLITICS IN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETIES
 A Comparative Perspective
 Lawrence C. Mayer with John H. Burnett,
 both of Texas Tech University
 This book presents a comparative analysis of various
 Western European industrialized societies by describ-
 ing and explaining their political structures. The
 authors suggest cultural, sociological, and historical
 variables as determinants of patterns in these socie-
 ties, and explore the effects of technology on consti-
 tutional differences.
 (0 471 57986-6)   1977   388 pp.   $11.95
 CONTEMPORARY ISSUES
 IN POLITICAL THEORY
 Robert Booth Fowler, University of Wisconsin-
 Madison, & Jeffrey R. Orenstein, Kent State
 University, Stark Campus
 This contemporary approach to theory covers the
 major topics that fit the scheme of political values-
 anarchy, democracy, justice, liberty and equality, obli-
 gation, and revolt-discussing their historical roots to
 evaluate their present-day significance.
 (0 47127031-8)    1977    168 pp.
 (0 47127032-6)    $5.95 paper
 ADMINISTRATION IN THE
 PUBLIC SECTOR
 Harold F. Gortner, Indiana University
 Public administrators must understand the functions
 of management in guiding the public organization-
 and at the same time know how to operate within the
 political system. Gortner gives proper cognizance to
 this increasingly important role of state and local pub-
 lic administrators in the overall administrative opera-
 tion. (0 471 31891-4)    1977    343 pp.    $11.95
 AMERICAN LEGAL PROCESSES
 William P. McLauchlan, Purdue University
 A volume in the Wiley Series: Viewpoints on
 American Politics-Samuel Krislov, Series
 Editor
 What really goes on in the American courtroom? What
 is the court's role in society? What is the difference
 between trial and appellate courts? These are only a
 few of the questions that McLauchlan answers in this
 complete description of the American legal system.
 He treats the courtroom as one great dispute-settling
 arena and examines the roles of the plaintiff and
 defendant in civil litigation.
 (0 471 58560-2)    1977    218 pp.    $10.95 cloth
 (0 471 58561-0)    $6.95 paper
 OFFENSE AND DEFENSE
 IN THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM
 George H. Quester, Cornell University
 A volume in the Wiley Series on International
 Relations-Richard Rosecrance, Series Editor
 Tracing the overall impact of military technology
 through chronological history, this book presents a
 systematic study of how military force determines
 the shape of politics. Quester uses a macrocosmic
 approach to examine the tendency toward offense or
 defense, and cites particular military campaigns and
 technological innovations that have affected warfare
 throughout the centuries.
 (0 471 70255-2)    1977    219 pp.     $10.95 cloth
 (0 471 70256-0)    $6.95 paper
 INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
 A Policymaker Focus
 Robert L. Wendzel, University of Maine
 Using a policymaking approach, this book provides a
 concise core analysis of the fundamentals of interna-
 tional relations. Wendzel offers an actual feel for the
 feasible options which should be pursued in specific
 situations, giving a pragmatic analytical framework for
 viewing current and future problems that policy-
 makers face.

 Behind the Scenes in American Government
 Personalities and Politics
 Peter Woll
 Brandeis University
 The premise of this unique reader is that the character and style of political leaders and
 the people around them have a profound impact on the political process. Culled from
 popular periodicals and best-selling books, Woll's selections show how different per-
 sonalities interact with political institutions and processes to shape government. Each
 piece underscores an important concept in American political structure or process.
 Instructor's Manual available. Paper 316 pages 1977 $5.95
 War, Peace, and International Politics
 David W. Ziegler
 Western Washington State College
 Organized around the dramatic theme of war and its prevention, this new text provides
 an unusually coherent introduction to the basic concepts and propositions of interna-
 tional politics. Ziegler's goal in writing for beginning students in international relations
 was not encyclopedic scope or methodological sophistication, but genuine readability.
 His central theme focuses students' attention and provides a convenient way of intro-
 ducing topics such as international law and organization, diplomacy, defense policy,
 deterrence, nationalism, transnational influences, and the problems of global resources.
 Instructor's Manual available. Paper 444 pages 1977 $8.95
 America in the Seventies
 Problems, Policies, and Politics
 Allan P Sindler
 University of California, Berkeley
 Six original case studies, all written by top experts in their respective fields, deal with the
 major institutions of national government-Congress, Presidency, Courts, Parties, and
 Bureaucracy-as they grapple with the policies and processes of major importance in
 the 1970s. The contributors include Norman Ornstein, Fred Greenstein, David Kirp,
 Austin Ranney, Thomas Cronin, and Allan Sindler. Each case focuses on a particular
 institution or policy, but remains sensitive to the broader play of forces that shape politics
 and policymaking in America.
 Paper 329 pages 1977 $6.95
 Politics in West Germany
 Second Edition
 Lewis J. Edinger
 Columbia University
 Lewis Edinger's analysis of contemporary West German politics places public policy
 processes in the Federal Republic in the context of the comparative analysis of advanced
 industrial societies. The book is based on materials drawn from recent German studies,
 extensive interviews with West German leaders, opinion polls, census data, and news-
 paper accounts. Historical background is included only to the extent that it bears on
 contemporary politics.

 WARTIME ORIGINS OF THE BERLIN
 DILEMMA
 Daniel J. Nelson
 A fascinating, detailed account of how and why the
 Allies became impaled on the horns of the Berlin
 dilemma. The focal point of the inquiry is the Euro-
 pean Advisory Commission, the inter-Allied body in
 London that in 1944 and 1945 negotiated and signed
 the protocols establishing the postwar status of Berlin
 and the zones of occupation in Germany. Highly
 revelatory is the author's use of the previously un-
 published correspondence of Ambassador John
 Winant.                             $11.95

 and crystallized Booker T. Washington's separate-

 A STUDY IN FEDERALISM

 A timely study of one of the means by which govern-

 Hallman deals in great detail with the Emergency
 Employment Act of 1971. He traces the legislative

 tricate relationships within Congress and between the
 legislative and executive branches; describes how the
 administration of the program unfolded within the
 federal bureaucracy and what happened within state
 and local governments; and finally sets forth the
 results of the whole 1969-1973 experience and brings
 the story up-to-date in a penetrating discussion of the
 current status and future prospects of emergency-
 employment programs.                      $9.75
 POLICY ANALYSIS
 What Governments Do, Why They Do
 It, and What Difference It Makes
 Thomas R. Dye
 In this well informed, challenging critique, the author
 contends that research on cities, states, and nations
 reveals that social and economic conditions have far
 more direct impact on public policy than the structure
 or form of governmental institutions or political pro-
 cesses.                          Cloth $6.50

 MODERN ORGANIZATION
 Victor A. Thompson
 This classic text, available in paperback for the first
 time, shows how insecurity and friction develop in
 modern organizations when bureaucrats who have
 the right to make decisions lack the ability to do so
 and fall into patterns of "bureaupathic" behavior.
 Automaton conformity, exaggerated dependence
 upon regulations and quantitative standards, and the
 "need" to control -- these predominate among the
 many forms of bureaupathic behavior.   Paper $3.50
 PROSKAUER: HIS LIFE AND TIMES
 Louis M. Hacker and Mark D. Hirsch
 A lawyer and New York State Supreme Court judge,
 Proskauer, as president of the American Jewish
 Committee, played a key role in liaison between
 Chaim Weizmann and President Truman, leading to
 American support for an Israeli nation. Later, as an
 emissary to Pope John XXIII and Vatican II, he work-
 ed with Papal representatives for repudiation of the
 infamous concept of Jewish deicide.

 AMERICAN DEFENSE POLICY
 edited by John E. Endicott and Roy W. Stafford
 from reviews of previous editions
 "This book is an attempt to assemble in one
 volume a representative selection of the re-
 cent extensive American writings on defense
 matters: it succeeds brilliantly and, in a field
 in which the student and the policy-maker
 can equally become bogged down in the sheer
 volume of words, its editors have done a
 considerable public service by concise com-
 pilation." - International Affairs
 "In American Defense Policy there is not
 only a wide lateral coverage ranging through
 the major aspects of the spectrum of con-

 historical perspective imparted by many of

 A Unique & Comprehensive
 Reference Guide for Researchers in the
 Political & Policy Sciences.
 WHAT IS IT?
 The University Center for International Studies, University of Pittsburgh, in con-
 junction with the American Political Science Assn., has created an annual reference
 publication designed especially for scholars and educators doing research in the
 social and policy sciences. United States Political Science Documents (USPSD) is a
 quality reference tool to assist in your search for appropriate literature among the
 ever-increasing pool of source materials pertaining to your special area of interest.
 USPSD contains abstracts of articles published in 124 selected U.S. journals as well
 as a set of five indexes to these documents and a "Rotated Subject Descriptor
 Display."
 USE OF THE INDEXES
 USPSD is published in two separate parts. The first part contains the indexes and the
 second part the document descriptions. Each entry in the indexes supplies the
 name(s) of an article's author(s), its title, and its complete journal citation. Each
 entry also supplies a document accession number through which the full description
 of a document can be found in the second part, where the document descriptions
 are listed in ascending sequence by document number.
 In USPSD the identification of articles of possible relevance is accomplished by
 consulting one or all of the five indexes: Author/Contributor Index, Subject Index,
 Geographic Area Index, Proper Name Index, or the journal index. A reader of
 USPSD, then, can search for literature written by a specific author, devoted to a
 specific subject (such as "southeast asia"), discussing a specific organization (such as
 "department of defense"), or published in a specific journal. Also included to facili-
 tate use of the Subject Index is a Rotated Subject Descriptor Display.

 THE DOCUMENT DESCRIPTIONS
 The provision of information which can be used to decide whether or not a docu-
 ment should be looked up is accomplished in USPSD through an in-depth document
 description scheme. This scheme furnishes as many as nine separate items of infor-
 mation about a document: author(s), title, journal citation, abstract of contents,
 names of special features (figures, tables, etc.), names of cited persons, key subject
 descriptors, key geographic area descriptors, and proper names.
 United States Political Science Documents is the published version of the contents
 of a computer-based information system developed by the University Center for
 International Studies, University of Pittsburgh, in conjunction with the American
 Political Science Association. The first edition was published in January of this year
 and contained 2,494 documents derived from journals published during 1975. The
 current volume of USPSD, Volume 2, has a publication date of August 1977 and
 covers 2,824 articles published during 1976. Volume 3 is currently in production
 and is scheduled for availability during July 1978, encompassing approximately
 3,000 documents.
 The 1975 edition of USPSD, containing abstracted articles published during 1975, is
 priced at $90 ($75 for members of APSA). The price for the 1976 edition is $105
 ($90 for members of APSA). The 1977 edition will be priced at $120 but orders
 received prior to December 31, 1977, can take advantage of a substantial discount.
 When ordering both the 1975 and 1976 editions simultaneously, deduct $40 from
 the total price-$155 for both volumes. When ordering all three volumes at once,
 deduct $80 from the total cost-$235 for all three publications. You already have
 the 1975 edition? Then order the 1976 and 1977 editions together for $180-$45
 off the individual price. We want you to examine and use USPSD. We know you'll
 find it a most useful and comprehensive publication.

 Not for the Poor Alone
 European Social Services
 ALFRED J. KAHN and SHELIA B. KAMERMAN
 "An absorbing first-hand appraisal of innovative government programs that have
 developed in Western Europe over the past several decades to improve the quality
 of life. Home health care in England, housing for the aged in Sweden, and govern-
 ment-subsidized vacations in France are representative of the topics presented.
 The study is balanced, nonemotional, well written, and judiciously researched."

 The Age of Bureaucracy
 Perspectives on the Political Sociology of Max Wteber
 WOLFGANG J. MOMMSEN
 "Mommsen's critical judgment is accurate because it springs from genuine under-
 standing, and, to use an old-fashioned word, sympathy. While pointing out the
 dilemma of Weber as a prophet without disciples, he acknowledges the depth of
 his prophetic insight-the growth and inhumanity of modern bureaucracies, the
 asphyxiation of religion and other worldly values by the universal process of
 rationalization, and the potential for political oppression in the modern state."
 -British Journal of Sociology                               TB/1862    $3.95
 Government Secrecy in Democracies
 ITZHAK GALNOOR, Editor
 "This book is an important step forward. The first six essays indicate the wide
 range of related subjects.... The second part is a descriptive analysis of how secre-
 cy is treated in ten democratic states.... the essays analyze how different demo-
 cratic systems cope with the same phenomena and the methods they have adopted."

 Organized Labor in Latin America
 Historical Case Studies of Urban Workers in Dependent Societies
 HOBART A. SPALDING JR.
 "The persistence of workers to organize and fight to improve their lives remains
 constant throughout Latin American labor history. These pages record their strug-
 gle for a new and more just society... Every action, every episode, sometimes
 recorded in a single line, reference, or footnote, involved real people, each with
 hopes, angers, and aspirations." -from the Introduction     TB/1922    $5.95
 Idols of the Tribe
 Group Identity and Political Change
 HAROLD R. ISAACS
 "This is a splendid book, doing for the subject of group identity what Erikson has
 done for individual identity. Brilliantly written, it synthesizes a vast body of
 material and speaks directly to a central problem of our time: ethnicity. Poignantly,
 Isaacs deals with the dilemmas of universality and particularity and their opposing
 tugs on our hearts and minds. It is a book written out of deep personal experience
 ^            and profound intellectual reflection." -BRUCE MAZLISH  CN/483     $4.50             ^

 THE IRONY OF DEMOCRACY: AN UNCOMMON INTRODUCTION TO
 AMERICAN POLITICS
 Fourth Edition
 by Thomas R. Dye, Florida State University and L. Harmon Zeigler, University of
 Oregon
 When IRONY was first published in 1970, it brought something unique to American
 government teaching literature - a reinterpretation of American politics from the
 view point of elite theory. It has since become a standard - adopted by nearly 2,000
 colleges and universities in its first three editions. New to the fourth edition: an
 entire chapter on "The Newsmakers"; a whole new look at "Protest Movements";
 an expanded discussion of the role of the voter in shaping public policy; a thorough
 discussion of the rapid rise to power of Jimmy Carter - "A New Smile on the Face
 of the Establishment". Rewritten to simplify presentation; new format with
 4   expanded use of graphics.
 January 1978. 73/8" X 91/4 ". 512 pages. Paperbound. Instructor's Manual
 with graded test items.

 4   THE QUEST FOR RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT: AN INTRODUCTION TO
 STATE AND LOCAL POLITICS
 4   by L. Harmon Zeigler and Harvey Tucker, University of Oregon
 4   How responsive are state and local governments to demands made upon them, and
 to whom are they responsive? Zeigler and Tucker present overwhelming evidence
 4   that state and local governments are not responsive to the people whom they
 4   represent. Consistent with the new movement in political science to evaluate as well
 as understand governmental processes and institutions, THE QUEST... represents a
 4   bold evaluation of state and local politics. A provocative and iconoclastic text that
 runs counter-grain to mainstream state and local government scholarship.
 4   December 1977.6 3/8" X 91/4'. 350 pages. Paperbound.
 4   UNDERSTANDING INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS
 4   by Deil Wright, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill
 A brief but thorough treatment of intergovernmental relations with specific focus
 40  on public policy issues and the roles of participating officials in local, state and
 .   national government. Appropriate as a core text for courses in federalism and inter-
 governmental relations or as a supplement for courses in public administration,
 state and local government and/or American government.

 INTRODUCTION TO PUBLIC BUDGETING

 sive, up-to-date presentation of the government spending process. Ideal as a core
 text for a first course in public budgeting, or as a supplement to courses in public
 administration, or American government.
 February 1978. 61/2" X 91/4 ". 220 pages. Paperbound.
 THE PEOPLE, MAYBE
 Third Edition
 by Karl Lamb, Cowell College, University of California, Santa Cruz
 A welcome and time-tested departure from standard texts on American Govern-
 ment - THE PEOPLE, MAYBE raises the fundamental questions about the
 American system... Can the people rule? Do they? Will they rule wisely?...in the
 context of contemporary events and a close look at institutions. The style is
 literate and dramatic: the "images" section of each chapter recreates the drama of     4
 politics, providing a sense of excitement and involvement lacking in most texts;
 the "reflections" section of each chapter provides detailed and painless coverage of
 the nature and history of institutions. Streamlined organization.
 March 1978. 7 3/4 " X 91/4 ". 556 pages. Clothbound. Study Guide and Instructor's
 Manual by Len Shipman, Mt. San Antonio College, available with text.

 40 Provides the student with a more provocative approach than the bland descriptive-            4

 4 than merely absorb the author's views. Thoroughly reworked to simplify written                40

 Democrat in 130 years to hold this office in a
 county which has moved up behind Cook County as
 the third largest Democratic voting population
 in the State of Illinois..
 As a former Highland Park resident, you

 county would support this idea.
 As you can well imagine, my campaign

 hope that you will find sometime at your
 convenience during the time mentioned.  Your
 presence at this event would be most appreciated
 by Lake County Democrats, and of course, I
 will be personally grateful-
 Is there any further information you
 would like?  Please call on me!
 Very truly yours,
