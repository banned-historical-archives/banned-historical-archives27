 The
 Middle East
 r ~r
 The area was seething a bit more th'n usual
 last week, and developments in Libya, Egypt,
 Lebanon, and Israel gave little promise that ten-
 sions are likely to ease soon.
 In two free-swinging speeches this week that
 were vintage Qadhafi, the Libyan leader tried to
 breathe new life into his revolution, now three
 and one half years old. He made it clear that he
 was fed up with domestic opposition to his pol-
 icies and characteristically threatened to resign if
 a "new revolution" is not carried out.
 The most extraordinary aspect of the two
 speeches was Qadhafi's call for armed "popular"
 committees to carry out a cultural battle against
 foreign influences and the "arrogant and edu-
 cated" classes. Concerned with the deepening
 controversy in Libya over the proposed union
 with Egypt, Qadhafi may view these "popular"
 units as a sharp warning that he intends to get
 tough. He told a crowd of some 6,000 laborers,
 bureaucrats and students to form these commit-
 Page  1
 tees immediately, and some reportedly have al-
 ready been created in the government and private
 firms. The new groups will probably not be very
 effective in the way Qadhafi would like, but they
 certainly contain seeds of much future trouble.
 Although the major emphasis in the speeches
 was on domestic problems, Qadhafi did say that
 he had no personal differences with presidents
 Sadat and Asad and that he believed in their
 "sincere  patriotism."  Qadhafi's  bow  to  his
 partners probably was intended as a bit of fence-
 mending as well as an effort to underscore Libya's
 commitment to both the confederation and union
 with Egypt. At the same time, the Libyan leader
 did not pass up the opportunity to again warn
 other Arab governments against seeking separate
 settlements with Israel. As he has in the past,
 Qadhafi accused the other Arab governments of
 working only to restore their occupied territories
 and complained that Libya alone is committed to
 all-out war with Israel. He also asserted that Libya    25X1
 has not been party to Arab "battle plans," and
 therefore, he would not shoulder the blame for
 another Arab defeat.

 CYCLE OF VIOLENCE
 The sabotage on 14 April of US-owned oil
 facilities near Sidon, Lebanon, suggests that the
 fedayeen have recovered from the shock of the
 Israeli raid of 10 April. The Lebanese Revolution-
 ary Guard, an obscure extremist organization,
 claimed credit. It seems far more likely, however,
 that the fedayeen are using the so-called guard as
 a cover. Two other attempts were made against
 the US-owned Trans-Arabian  Pipeline, one in
 southern Lebanon, one in Saudi ArabiaJ
 The day before the strike against the Sidon
 facility  Fatah  leader Arafat declared the  US
 "'would not have to wait long" for a "terrible
 reprisal." Throughout the week, the Palestinian
 press hammered hard on the theme of US collu-
 sion with the Israelis. It was charged, for example,
 that US Marine guards attached to the embassy
 participated in the Israeli attacks. Scant coverage
 was given  in  the  Lebanese press to the US
 rebuttal, moderate publishers being intimidated
 by the threat of fedayeen retribution. The govern-
 ment-controlled media in a number of Arab coun-
 Aftermath of Terrorist Sabotage
 tries joined in the effort to incite anti-US senti-
 ment. The treatment was particularly virulent in
 Iraq, Syria, and Algeria..]
 The Lebanese Government has managed so
 far to cope with fedayeen demonstrations. The
 funeral for the slain fedayeen leaders drew crowds
 estimated at 100,000-the largest in recent years.
 Although anti-Israeli and anti-American sentiment
 ran high and 300-400 armed fedayeen marched in
 the cortege, there were no disorders. President
 Franjiyah,  moving  to  replace  Prime  Minister
 Salam who resigned the day of the Israeli raid, on
 18 April charged Amin al-Hafiz, a moderate leftist
 member of the Chamber of Deputies, with the
 formation of a cabinet. Hafiz' task will be to
 select  a politically and  religiously balanced-
 Christian/Muslim-government whose first objec-
 tive will be to deal with domestic repercussions
 from the latest Israeli incursiorr:

 Israeli  raid, Defense Minister Dayan said that
 Israel still held the Lebanese Government respon-
 sible for fedayeen activity against Israel ema-
 nating from Lebanon. He vowed further raids if
 such activity is not halted. Dayan warned that the
 Israelis would not wait to retaliate, but would
 strike at the fedayeen before they struck at Israel.)
 /Brigadier General Shalev, the deputy chief of
 Israeli military intelligence, told US officials he
 thought the major impact of the Israeli raid was a
 demonstration of Israel's ability to strike at the
 "very nerve center" of the fedayeen movement.
 Shalev described this as a "staggering blow" to
 fedayeen morale and to fedayeen plans and opera-
 tions. Shalev had no illusions that the Israeli raid
 would put an end to terrorism, but he called it a
 "significant step ' in the eventual containment of
 fedayeen activities in Lebanon. Other military
 officials have warned again that Israel may strike
 at fedayeen bases and at government facilities of
 any Arab state supporting the terrorists.
 V
 Al The UN Security Council meetings on the
 Lebanese complaint produced some heated ex-
 changes and provide another opportunity for the
 Arab states to focus attention on their cause.
 Lebanon came under strong Arab pressure to
 insist on a harsh resolution condemning Israel.
 Led by Egypt, the Arab states seemed intent on
 exploiting the Israeli raid and the Council forum
 to embarrass and isolate both Israel and the USJ
 )9 /The Egyptians appeared to hope that the
 Council meetings might lead to a full debate on
 the UN role in the Middle East. To this end,
 Foreign Minister Zayatt was reported to favor a
 resolution calling on the Secretariat to report on
 the UN's efforts to achieve peace in the Middle
 East by mid-May.
 6  [Prime Minister Golda Meir has again tried to
 muzzle the debate on the thorny question of the
 SECRET
 occupied Arab territories and to paper over the
 differences on their future within  her Labor
 Party. The main questions being asked are how
 much Arab territory should be retained, does the
 addition of more Arabs pose a real demographic
 threat to Israel, do continued Israeli settlement
 and investment in the territories block peace ef-
 forts. The "minimalists" and "maximalists" have
 been discussing these questions-critical in this
 election year-for months. Mrs. Meir asks, "Why,
 when the Arabs are not ready to make peace with
 us, should we quarrel among ourselves?" aI

 )The issue heated up recently when Defense
 Minister Dayan reiterated his belief that Jews'` 1
 should retain the right in any future peace settle-
 ment to settle anywhere they want to in the
 occupied territories. Dayan wants what he calls a
 "clear statement" on this, i.e., one reflecting his
 views, in the Labor Party campaign platform.
 Then, Justice Minister Shapiro proposed that the
 ban should be lifted against the purchase of Arab
 lands  in  the  territories-specifically the West
 Bank-by individual Israelis or businesses.(
 designs)JThe Israeli press claimed that US pres-
 sures played a decisive role in forcing Mrs. Meir to
 back away from the proposal. Labor Party boss
 Finance Minister Sapir is also reported to have
 voiced his strong opposition to Mrs. Meir. In any
 event, the Israeli cabinet on 8 April announced
 that the existing ban on purchases of occupied
 Arab land would be maintained-only the Israeli
 National Land Authority can purchase land and
 then only with cabinet approval. The cabinet
 communique denied that any proposals had been
 submitted  to  the  cabinet;  actually  Dayan,
 Shapiro, and the National Religious Party each
 a '!  everal under-the-table land purchases have,   had submitted a plan but had withdrawn them

 Party support such purchases, while Foreign Min-

 the-road position, arguing that some purchases
 could be permitted under tight controls. Arab
 willingness to sell land to the Israelis-after 25
 years of hostility-apparently stems from a con-
 viction that the Israelis are going to stay in the
 occupied territories. f

 TRADE TALKS: INITIAL MOVES
 The EC Commission memorandum on a
 community approach to the multilateral trade
 negotiations coincided with  President Nixon's
 request for broad new trade powers from Con-
 gress. The EC Council is pledged to respond to
 the memorandum with a negotiating position no
 later than July. Precise instructions to the Com-
 mission-the body that will actually negotiate for
 the EC-are not likely to be approved by the
 Council, however, until the final shape of the US
 trade legislation becomes clear.
 tories would continue; there are now 45 settle-
 ments, 15 in the Golan Heights, 18 on the West
 Bank, 3 in the Gaza Strip, and 9 in Sinai.:,
 Mrs.  Meir  may  have  thus  temporarily
 papered over intra-party differences, but they are
 sure to burst out again this summer when the
 Labor Party meets to draft its party platform for
 the October election. The various proponents are
 still publicly muttering about their specific posi-
 tions, and a compromise will have to be worked
 out between now and the convention to avoid a
 bitter debate that could tear apart the ruling
 Labor Party.
 Uncertainty over the mood of Congress and
 how the Administration will use the discretionary
 powers it has requested has been a constant
 theme in the European reaction to the President's
 message. France has been the most critical, with
 official  and  press  comments harping on the
 danger of US trade objectives to European farm
 interests  and   the  EC's  common  agricultural
 policy. Other European press comment notes con-
 cern that false hopes may be raised in the US,
 which would force the President to implement

 retaliatory measures if substantial  concessions
 from the EC were not forthcoming. On the
 whole, however, the proposals have been well
 received.
 The Commission's own proposals, which the
 Council will debate next month, attempt a com-
 promise  between  some  of the  member-state
 desires and the intention to show movement on
 matters of concern to the US. In agriculture, for
 example, the international commodity stabiliza-
 tion agreements the French want are put forward,
 but so is restraint on export subsidies. The Com-
 mission rejects the notion that industrial tariffs be
 eliminated and resurrects the idea of reducing
 high tariffs, of which the US has more than the
 EC, proportionately more than low ones. In its
 approach  to safeguards against disruptive im-
 ports-certain to be a major topic in the negotia-
 tions-the Commission would apparently allow
 particular countries (Japan is the target) to be
 singled out even while it calls for non-discrimina-
 tion. In any case, the Commission wants interna-
 tionally supervised safeguards.
 In the case of safeguards as well as the
 matter of non-tariff barriers (such practices as
 government  procurement,  technical  standards,
 and quota restrictions) the Commission hopes to
 use the trade negotiations to extend and con-
 solidate  the  community's jurisdiction.                         Some
 member states will resist this, and reaching agree-
 ment on an approach to the many non-tariff
 barriers still not regulated by common EC policies
 will be a monumental task.
 The Commission may also have trouble in
 getting "improvements" in the EC's program of
 generalized preferences for developing countries'
 exports  of  manufactures  and  semi-processed
 goods. The Commission is making some headway
 in its attempts to meet US objections to the
 "reverse preferences" that the EC now gets from
 those  developing countries directly associated
 with the community. The Commission recom-
 mends that these countries offer similar, tariff-
 free access to third parties, thus in effect elim-
 inating any discrimination. Although this does
 not satisfy US objections, it is at least a step in
 the right direction.
 All community members appear united in
 insisting  that  the  trade  negotiations  be  ap-
 proached in a spirit of reciprocity. Of the EC
 members, the British appear most concerned with
 avoiding any confrontation with the US. London
 apparently feels its EC credentials are now good
 enough to weather some of the criticism, ema-
 nating mostly from the French, that it pays too
 much  attention  to  US  demands.  Germany's
 unquestioned commitment to trade liberalization
 is somewhat undercut by its equally unquestioned
 support for high farm prices. France will un-
 doubtedly scrutinize the Commission's sugges-
 tions closely both for substance and for any signs
 that the Commission is gaining more power. Paris'
 loud and persistent warnings of a tough bargain-
 ing line, while not to be disregarded, have had a
 somewhat defensive tone. They reflect its de-
 clining influence in the community since the
 Kennedy Round.

 until a successor has been organized. At the same
 time, Lon Nol called for the creation of a "su-

 be responsible for all important policy matters
 and decisions. The President intends to head this
 body and wants such prominent opposition fig-
 ures as Republican Party leader Sirik Matak and
 former Democratic Party chief In Tam to join it.)
 To help ensure their participation, the Presi-
 (lent has arranged for his meddlesome younger
 brother, Brigadier General Lon Non, to leave not
 only the government but also the country for a
 few months. Sirik Matak and In Tam have indi-
 cated that they want more concessions from Lon
 Nol-particularly firm assurances that he is pre-
 pared to give them some real responsibility. At
 mid-week, the two met with the President and
 reportedly proposed that the new council consist
 of themselves, Lon Nol, and former chief of state
 Cheng Heng. At last report, Lon Nol was mulling
 over this demand. More dickering clearly is in,
 store before some sort of compromise is achieved.

 Phnom Penh from South Vietnam, and the re-
 opening of Route 4 made it possible to move
 some petroleum supplies to the capital  from
 Kompong Som. As of 15 April, the capital had
 enough fuel to supply about three weeks of elec-
 trical power and about a week's reserve of ra-
 tioned gasoline. Another convoy due to sail for
 Phnom Penh early next week may well be chal-
 lenged by Khmer Communist troops.)

 still important to demonstrate widely that he has
 firm American support. The trip has already re-
 ceived favorable publicity in virtually all of Sai-

 Thieu's success has added to the problems of
 his domestic non-Communist opponents, who are
 weak and divided. The two new coalitions trying
 to qualify as legal political parties-the Catholic-
 based Freedom Party and the six-faction Social
 Democratic Alliance--reportedly are already fall-
 ing out among themselves, and it is entirely pos-
 sible that neither will be able to agree on a slate
 of candidates for the Senate elections this sum-
 mer. Within both coalitions, factions that have
 been unable to have their way are threatening to
 withdraw. Although these factions see the Com-

 ready to join the government.

 last week, North Vietnamese units launched an

 attacks quickly forced the 2,000 government
 troops near  Tha Viang to withdraw into the
 rugged hills to the south and west. Once the
 government force was clear of the area, B-52s
 pounded North Vietnamese positions-.

 :The attacks did not come as a great surprise
 to Vientiane. Government leaders had been eye-
 ing the North Vietnamese buildup in the Tha
 Viang area with apprehension for several weeks,
 and Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma had warned
 Communist negotiators that he would request US
 air strikes if major North Vietnamese assaults
 occurred. In going ahead with the attack on Tha
 Viang, the Communists probably reasoned that
 the  opportunity  to firmly rebuff what they
 viewed as a government encroachment was worth
 the risk of US retaliation(
 As could be expected, the Pathet Lao con-
 demned the air strikes, warning in a radio broad-
 cast of unspecified "consequences" if the strikes
 were not halted. The Foreign Ministry in Hanoi
 labeled the bombings as "a new military es-.

 CHINA AT ECAFE
 Chinese activity in the UN continues to be
 morel of a problem for the Soviets than for the
 US. Last week, Peking made its debut at the UN
 Commission for Asia and the Far East, a forum
 that the  Soviets  have  used  for  years  as  a
 propaganda platform to attack US policy toward
 underdeveloped nations and to defend the in-
 terests of its Asian Communist friends. This time
 Peking took over the role of protector of the
 smaller Asian Communist movements, gave the
 US a few lumps on Vietnam, and told the Soviets
 to go packing with their Asian collective security
 pact.
 As  propaganda  blasts  go,  the  Chinese
 speeches were boilerplate. Their objection to the
 continued exclusion from ECAFE of some Asian
 Communist movements was fairly mild, and their
 criticism of Taiwan's membership in the Asian
 Development Bank was pro forma. Their sharpest
 remarks were directed at Moscow, and even these
 did  not break any new ground. As they did
 initially at the UN in New York, the Chinese at    25X1
 ECAFE  seemed  anxious  to  establish  their
 credentials and in general make a good impression
 on their regional neighbors.

 Early this month a provincial radio broad-
 cast hailed the accomplishments of the Cultural
 Revolution as immortal. But one of the accom-
 plishments of the period, the ouster of a number
 of top party officials, was reversed last week
 when Teng Hsiao-ping, the second highest ranking
 victim in the party, reappeared at a banquet given
 by Premier Chou En-lai.1
 Teng's reappearance has been interpreted by
 some foreign observers as a sign that the leader-
 ship has reached sufficient agreement to be ready
 to convene a party congress or a National People's
 Congress, the government's rubberstamp legisla-
 ture.  Within China, however, Teng's return is
 likely to cause confusion among the cadre, chiefly
 because it is not in step with the current propa-
 -ganda line)  ince last December, the party theo-
 retical journal Red Flag, which is the major leftist
 propaganda vehicle, has been waging a vigorous
 campaign to justify the Cultural Revolution and
 praise its achievements. The campaign even de-
 fends the Red Guards, the youthful activists who
 helped bring down party leaders like TengThe
 rehabilitation of a chief target of the Cultural
 Revolution amid a propaganda campaign to de-
 fend that upheaval will be taken by the cadre as a
 sign that the leadership in Peking remains divided
 on fundamental issues, a situation not conducive
 to the settling of differences.!
 Rehabilitation can take a variety of forms,
 and the precise nature of Teng's status is probably
 still a source of friction. Teng's reappearance`
 serves to remove the stigma of his earlier disgrace,
 but it does not follow that he will be allowed to
 resume active duties.:Although the official Chi-
 nese news agency identified the septuagenarian
 Teng as a vice premier, his former government
 r title,1 hree other aging luminaries, rehabilitated in
 the  past  year,  have been  identified  as vice-
 premiers and still play no active role in govern-
 ment affairs. Peking also skirted the more con-
 troversial issue of whether to return Teng to an
 important party post. As secretary general of the
 party, a post since abolished, Teng was accused of
 using his position to block implementation of
 Mao's policies.I
 J  ;Although the final decision may have been
 made last month when party officials were re-

 JAPAN: A BIGGER NAVY
 he Japanese Navy, already the most power-
 ful non-Communist naval force in the Far East, is
 being further expanded. Under the fourth defense
 plan, which runs until 1977, the Japanese will
 build 54 ships for their navy. Seven destroyers
 ,
 six destroyer escorts, five submarines, and 15
 coastal minesweepers will be added. The navy also
 will get 92 combat aircraft, including 40 heli-
 copters
 (4  Two of the new destroyers will be 5,200-ton
 models. They will be the largest ships in the fleet.
 Each will carry three helicopters for antisub-
 marine warfare operations. Several of the de-
 stroyers are scheduled to be equipped with US
 Sea Sparrow and Tartar air defense missiles; they
 may also be equipped with standard antiship mis-
 siles from the US. The submarines will all be
 conventional torpedo attack models, and later
 models will be capable of increased range.-)
 )The navy will buy additional P-2J patrol
 aircraft which will supplement obsolescent S-2A
 aircraft in antisubmarine operations. The navy
 also will get more SH-3A antisubmarine heli-
 :r copters  and  S-62B  minesweeping  helicopters.
 Both helicopters are being built in Japan under
 US license. The navy has no current plans to
 acquire aircraft with an antiship strike capability.)

 AUSTRALIA: PROBLEMS DOWN UNDER
 7~~)
 uIn the four months the Labor governm(ent
 has been in office, US-Australian relations have
 encountered some rough sailing. Prime Minister
 Whitlam's desire to chart a more independent
 Australian policy contrasts sharply with the pro-
 US attitude of the previous government. Al-
 though Whitlam has repeatedly affirmed his inten-
 tion to continue Australia's alliance with the US,
 complications and frustrations in Washington's
 dealings  with  Canberra  may  become  more
 common.
 After an initial period of indecision, Whitlam
 has now decided in favor of the continuation of
 US defense and scientific installations in Aus-
 tralia. He wants, however, to negotiate greater
 Australian participation and control at the exist-
 ing sites, and he may go slow on any new ventures
 such as the proposed navigational aid station.
 Complicating US-Australian relations is the
 pressure from the noisy left wing of the Labor
 Party. Over time, left-wing opposition could af-
 fect the prime minister's ability to control his
 party and the government. The recent election
 of an outspoken left-wing critic of the US as
 chairman of a joint parliamentary committee on
 defense and foreign affairs points up Whitlam's
 inclination to roll with left-wing punches. And in

 fact, Whitlam finds it neither politic nor possible
 to muzzle the anti-US left-wing of his party. With-
 out its support, his working majority in Parlia-
 ment would be jeopardized.
 Whitlam and the moderates do have one
 great advantage, however, in dealing with the left.
 In a basically conservative country like Australia,
 the moderates can win national elections; the
 leftists cannot, and they know it. This is the
 factor that allowed Whitlam to gain the party

 USSR-US: ACCENTUATING THE POSITIVE
 pbservers in Moscow have been struck by
 the extent of the current campaign to publicize
 the improvement in US-Soviet relations. Despite
 an occasional sour note, favorable coverage of the
 US is at a record high. The Soviet press has been
 diligent in reporting presidential statements, and
 there has been a marked drop in references to
 "circles in the US opposed to detente." Differ-
 ences between the two nations have been receiv-
 ing low-key treatment; they are sometimes dis-
 missed as being of only passing concern. The
 softening of some of the more abrasive May Day
 slogans on foreign policy is the latest example of
 this trend.

 will allow him to continue to have his way on
 critical issues.
 Whitlam  himself  has  strong  convictions,
 which often are contrary to US interests. The
 prime minister, who ran on the slogan "ANZUS is
 not a foreign policy," has not hesitated to take
 issue with the US on external issues. He has been
 especially critical of American involvement in
 Indochina  and  is  publicly  and  privately ad-
 vocating an early and total US military with-
 drawal from Southeast Asia.
 -7 7)
 The most popular theme is the outlook for
 improved economic relations. The visits of Treas-
 ury Secretary Shultz and Ex-Im Bank Chairman
 Kearns have received heavy play, as have the
 extension of credits by the US to the USSR and
 major transactions with US firms such as the
 agreement last week with Occidental Petroleum.
 These and other recent developments have in-
 creased Soviet confidence in the summit under-
 standings. As a result, the Soviet media are hold-
 ing out to the ordinary citizen the prospect of
 new prosperity based on an era of greater bilateral
 cooperation.
 Moscow's upbeat treatment was facilitated
 by the end of the war in Vietnam. After the
 summit last May there was some improvement in
 coverage of things American. Nevertheless, the
 level of criticism remained high, especially so dur-
 ing the bombing of North Vietnam last Decem-
 ber. Since the signing of the peace agreement,
 Moscow has been much less inhibited in forecast-
 ing closer ties with the US.
 The timing of the accelerated campaign to
 publicize the fruits of detente also suggests that
 Moscow is beginning the public buildup for a
 Brezhnev visit to the US. By accentuating the
 successes of his US policy to date, the Soviets
 may be seeking to rationalize his position domes-
 tically  in order to free his hand in Washing-

 Buying from the US
 Poland's purchases from C7 th
 e US may well
 double this year and turn Poland's long-standing
 surplus in commodity trade into a deficit. Poland
 already has ordered an estimated $150 million
 worth of grain, soybeans, and soybean meal; pre-
 sumably, it will place further orders. Poland may
 also boost sharply its purchases of machinery and
 equipment, which so far have accounted for a
 small part of its imports from the US.
 Polish purchases from the US grew 53 per-
 cent last year, largely because of greatly expanded
 imports of agricultural products. On the other
 hand, the large increase in Polish imports from
 Western  Europe  and  Japan  resulted  from  a
 doubling of Polish purchases of capital equip-
 ment. Western Europe and Japan got in on the
 ground floor of the booming Polish market for
 advanced technology.
 Imports of capital equipment from the US
 may grow rapidly over the next few years. In
 addition to contracts already signed with such
 firms as International Harvester, Alan Scott, and
 Textron, Poland is considering a number of other
 purchases. A Polish delegation, recently in the
 US, expressed a strong desire to import large
 amounts of equipment for the copper industry.
 When the president of the US Export-Import
 Bank was in Poland early this month, Prime Min-
 ister Jaroszewicz told him that Poland has a new
 version of the shopping list submitted last April
 and will seek $200 million in credits in the US
 this year.
 President Nixon's decision last November
 authorizing  Export-Import  Bank  financing for
 Poland should facilitate US firms' winning more
 Polish contracts. The Export-Import Bank already
 has authorized credits to finance part of the pur-
 chase price of two meat-processing plants, a Send-
 zimir metal rolling mill, and a Cyber-72 computer
 system. The bank recently upgraded the country's
 credit rating, which, although primarily a matter
 of prestige, may increase Poland's applications for

 Foreign Minister in Trouble
 >/ `Foreign Minister Stefan Olszowski has been
 in and out of the Warsaw dog house ever since he
 got the job. Late last year he apparently tried to
 introduce too many of his own initiatives into
 Polish foreign relations. After a period of some
 uncertainty, he seems to have resolved his prob-
 lems, at least for the moment.]
 N1 )When Olszowski became foreign minister in
 December 1971, he was removed from his posi-
 tion on the party secretariat. This shift suggested
 that party chief Gierek had diminished the power
 of a potential rival by removing him from daily
 contact with party matters. Still Gierek was en-
 trusting the Foreign Ministry to a man of intense
 ambition who was sure to breathe new life into it. 7
 SThough he had no prior diplomatic experi-
 ence, Olszowski's initial performance won the
 approval of senior officials in the ministry, and it
 appeared that Gierek had made a wise choice.
 Olszowski got the foreign
 affairs portfolio specifically to provide dynamic
 leadership to the Polish team  in normalizing
 relations with West Germany. He achieved that
 objective with few problems and much praise in
 September 1972. )

 there was need to improve the functioning of the
 Foreign Ministry and to strengthen its political
 leadership:
 ,Olszowski thus seems to have overstepped
 his authority. Details of his actions are lacking,
 but he may have moved policy a bit further and
 faster than Gierek wanted. He seems to have
 taken this reprimand with good grace, however,
 and has tried to be the model bureaucrat since
 January. He will have difficulties in keeping his
 enormous  ambition  in  check  for  long, even
 though he recognizes he will stay in office only so
 long as he continues to enjoy Gierek's confidence
 or until he  ives the re ime cause form re con-

 More Ostpolitik
 West Germany has launched a new series of
 high-level exchanges with the  East.  The new
 exchanges may help the government somewhat
 with a public oversold on Ostpolitik and skeptical
 about its practical worth. Bonn sees its initiatives
 as the natural follow-up to recent treaties with
 the major Eastern states. By working to eliminate
 remaining sore spots in its eastern relations, Bonn
 hopes that Pankow, the only  East European
 regime that feels seriously threatened by Brandt's
 policies, will become more amenable to improved
 ties.?
 The drive began last week, when West Ger-
 man and Czechoslovak negotiators announced a
 compromise for handling the Munich Agreement
 of 1938. In face of reported Soviet pressure,
 Prague backed off from insisting that the pact was
 null ab initio. The compromise clears the way for

 more  compensation  for  victims  of  Naziism.
 Brandt tried hard to create a good atmosphere,
 but before the visit Bonn   officials conceded
 privately that they cannot do much for Belgrade

 i'/  fSoviet party boss Brezhnev's precedent-set-

 point in the flurry of activity. The Germans will
 urge Brezhnev to take a more permissive stance
 on West German ties with West Berlin, and to
 urge Pankow to adopt a more forthcoming pos-
 ture on inter-German problems. Bonn will argue
 that such steps would promote the detente Mos-
 cow is interested in. The West Germans are afraid
 they will not be able to satisfy Soviet expecta-
 tions for increased trade or credits. Even if sub-
 stantive results are few, the up-beat atmospherics
 of the visit, if nurtured, could have a beneficial
 effect on West German opinion_J
 I~  Romanian party chief Ceausescu will be in
 Vt/est Germany 26-29 June. Bonn-Bucharest rela-
 tions are generally good, but West German offi-
 cials expect that Ceausescu, too, will ask for more
 economic benefits than they can promise. Polish

 FRANCE: DEFENSE SPENDING
 Michel Debre, chief theorist of French de-
 fense doctrine, has departed the Defense Ministry.
 He leaves the French armed forces with a 1973
 budget of 34.8 billion francs-the equivalent of
 about $8.5 billion if the French defense effort
 were reproduced in the US. This budget is up
 about 10 percent from last year, marking the
 largest yearly increase since 1965. In real terms-
 taking into account the effects of inflation in the
 defense  sector-defense  outlays  have  actually
 diminished somewhat since 1969.
 The  French maintain the largest military
 establishment in Western Europe on smaller de-
 fense budgets than either the UK or West Ger-
 many, the other major defense spenders in West-
 ern Europe. The limitations on French defense
 spending have had their greatest impact on equip-
 ment procurement. Over the past decade, capital
 expenditure appropriations have been tight for
 the conventional armed forces, particularly the
 army. This limitation was due in large measure to
 the high percentage of capital funds appropriated
 for the nuclear forces-about 50 percent-until
 1969.
 The capital expenditures for nuclear forces
 have subsequently  leveled  off,  and additional
 funds have been made available to the conven-
 tional forces for purchasing not only more mili-
 tary equipment but new types of equipment. The
 capital outlay for nuclear systems and research
 and development has been a declining percentage
 of the budget for the past five years.
 When he came to the Defense Ministry in
 1969, Debre promised increased spending on de-
 fense, particularly for the conventional armed
 forces. Although he managed to get modest in-
 creases in their budgets, the conventional forces
 have not as well as he seemed to promise. Also,
 many  of  the  improvements  that  have  been
 achieved have come through cutbacks and con-
 solidations, primarily in personnel and facilities.
 The French have the fastest growing econ-
 omy                                                                        in Western Europe, and some European
 countries have suggested that the percentage of
 GNP spent by the French on defense (3.1 per-
 cent) could be increased. Paris frequently has
 argued that the Europeans should spend more on
 their own forces. The French, nevertheless, con-
 tend that they are doing their fair share in the
 defense field. Before he left, Debre warned that
 French defense spending, as a percentage of GNP,
 had reached "a minimum below which it would
 be dangerous to go." This judgment apparently
 has been accepted by the French Government,
 but significantly larger increases in spending prob-
 ably will have to wait until the next five year
 defense plan, which begins in 1975.
 YUGOSLAVIA: TITO, EX CATHEDRA
 I  cTito will deliver a major policy address to a
 huge meeting of regime leaders on 23 April. His
 speech  will  cover constitutional changes, eco-
 nomic problems, party recentralization, and for-
 - eign policy. There may also be a few surprises,
 and it  is not impossible that the 80-year-old
 leader will lighten his load by passing on some of
 his presidential functions to his subordinates.]
 . he meeting Tito has convened is an unprec-
 edented "general assembly of the federation,"
 thus stressing the importance of what he has to
 say. The meeting will be attended by the full
 620-member legislature, the cabinet, the party
 presidium, and leaders from all Yugoslav mass
 organizations. High on the agenda are certain
 changes in Yugoslavia's constitution, including a
 scaling-down of the collective presidency from 22
 to 9 members, and a complex package of reforms
 aimed at strengthening local management of polit-
 ical and economic affairs. The theory of local
 management is fine, but Tito is also likely to
 bestow his blessing on the course of party re-
 centralization.-1

 SOUTH ASIA: NEW PROPOSAL
 :India and Bangladesh have made a proposal
 to Pakistan, which shows a new flexibility in their
 positions. The proposal would give something to
 all parties directly concerned, but Pakistan will
 have difficulty accepting it.
 On the plus side for Pakistan:
 ? The 90,000 Pakistani prisoners of war
 would be sent home.
 ? Pakistan would not have to recognize
 Bangladesh in exchange, though recognition
 would still be required for any direct talks
 with Dacca.
 On the plus side for Bangladesh:
 ? Several hundred thousand Bengalis with
 useful skills would go to Bangladesh. This
 would give the Pakistanis no real problem.
 ? Some prisoners of war-195 according to
 Dacca-would be tried in Bangladesh for war
 crimes. Even if Pakistan decides the sacrifice
 is necessary, the decision will be painful.
 -i ;Prime Minister - designate Naim Talu, asked
 by President Koruturk on 12 April to form a new
 government, has named a coalition cabinet com-
 posed of 13 members of the Justice Party, 6 from
 the Republican Reliance Party, and 5 independ-
 ents.jlTalu will present his proposed cabinet and
 legislative program to parliament this week. A
 vote of confidence will probably be taken on 25
 April.;
 The 54-year-old Talu, minister of commerce
 since December 1971 and a senator since mid-
 1972, is nominally an independent, but is close to
 Sthe Justice Party in outlook. Suleyman Demirel,
 Justice Party leader, clearly had a big hand in
 selecting the new cabinet; the contingent from his
 party is largely made up of his lieutenants. The
 Talu cabinet is the most conservative as well as   25X1
 the most experienced Turkish cabinet since the
 military  forced the resignation of Demirel as
 prime   minister  in  March  1971.
 ? Several hundred thousand Biharis-non-
 Bengali Muslims living in Bangladesh-would
 be sent to Pakistan. Islamabad has made it
 clear it does not want the Biharis and deciding
 to admit them might be even more difficult
 than acquiescing in the trials.
 On the plus side for India:
 ? India would get rid of the prisoners who
 are becoming a source of embarrassment to
 the government and who continue to hinder
 the improvement of relations with Pakistan.
 The  latest  initiative  will  not break the
 impasse on the subcontinent, but the decoupling
 of prisoner repatriation from Pakistani recogni-
 tion of Bangladesh does open up new avenues in
 the search for a settlement.

 ~US firms operating below the Mexican bor-
 der to take advantage of low labor costs are
 continuing to make substantial gains. These firms
 produce various articles from US components,
 selling them mainly to the US under an arrange-
 ment that subjects only the value added to tariff
 levies. Last year, employment in these border
 industries increased about 20 percent, to 49,000
 persons. Sales approximated a half billion dollars,
 and net exports to the US climbed to about $170
 million, a 35-percent gain.
 In general, the US has benefited from the
 program, although the relocation of US factories
 has cost jobs in the US. For example, US firms
 assembling electronic components have gained
 cheaper labor, thus enabling them to be more
 competitive with imports not using US materials.
 US tariff exemptions are necessary to industries
 producing clothing and furniture, but not to
 those assembling electronic components.
 The manufacture of electronic components
 now accounts for 65 percent of border industry
 employment, compared with 50 percent a year
 earlier. The shift to electronics is making border
 industry operations less vulnerable to the repeal
 of tariff exemptions because the benefits of low
 labor costs would outweigh losses from repeal,
 unlike the situation for clothing and furniture
 companies. The shift to electronics has increased
 potential  US  balance-of-payment  losses  that
 would result from repeal of the exemptions. The
 electronics companies probably could continue
 exporting to the US, but they would no longer
 have an incentive to buy components in the US
 because of cheaper sources elsewhere. On the
 basis of 1971 data, the annual cost of repeal to
 the US balance of payments has been estimated at
 $70 million.
 Recent currency realignments and Mexico's
 low labor costs have stirred interest in border
 industry operations among non-US companies. A
 subsidiary of a Japanese firm, established  in
 Tijuana in 1971, is assembling electronic calcula-
 tors from components made in its California
 plant, and Sony and Mitsubishi are planning bor-
 der plants to complement their US operations. In
 addition, Belgian and Israeli firms have recently
 shown  interest in establishing border industry
 operations.
 Although President Echeverria periodically
 expresses  reservations  about  border  industry
 exemptions from regulations requiring domestic
 control of firms in Mexico, he also appreciates the
 contribution exemptions make to exports. He
 consequently    decreed  last  October  that the
 special  border  industry arrangement be made
 available throughout Mexico. As a result of a US
 request, the decree permits the firms to make
 limited sales within Mexico.
 URUGUAY: PAINFUL SOLUTIONS NEEDED
 ,S 6:xr,7ce  )
 (t 4e
 The government's new five-year plan leads
 off with an accurate analysis of the underlying
 causes of Uruguay's economic woes. It fails to
 come to grips, however, with the harsh remedies
 needed  to  cut  inflation  and  spur  economic
 growth.
 Uruguay's   economic   planners apparently
 recognize that a difficult and unpopular reorienta-
 tion of economic policy is necessary to reverse
 nearly twenty years of deterioration and hyper-
 inflation. The plan rightly attributes Uruguay's
 economic malaise to government policies designed
 to  improve the  lot of urban dwellers at the
 expense of agriculture, still the backbone of the
 economy. For many years, artificially low farm
 prices and high export taxes have reduced pro-
 ducer incentives and encouraged contraband ship-
 ments.  Politically  inspired wage increases and
 burgeoning social welfare expenditures mollified
 the urban majority but added fuel to the infla-
 tionary fires.

 While the plan is good at diagnosing Uru-
 guay's fundamental economic problems, there is a
 basic conflict between some of the cited goals and
 proposed remedies. The plan, for example, calls
 for maintaining high real wage levels and im-
 proving the quality and quantity of costly social
 welfare programs; these goals are clearly at odds
 with the government's stated intention to reduce
 inflationary pressures and  increase investment
 outlays. The government's apparent desire to con-
 tinue to protect urban consumers by maintaining
 discriminatory price controls on agricultural pro-
 duce also conflicts with its stated goal of im-
 proving incentives for agricultural producers.
 The plan does call for a more realistic ex-
 change rate and implies a reduced dependence on
 export taxes.  If  implemented,  these  policies
 should stimulate agricultural exports and the
 resulting increase in foreign exchange receipts
 should enable the authorities to reduce restric-
 tions on imports of raw material and capital
 goods necessary for industrial expansion. Equally
 important, the proposed reduction in protective
 barriers should force increased efficiency in the
 nation's high-cost industries. The plan also en-
 visages a large increase in public investment out-
 lays over the next five years that will support
 development  in  the  private  sector  of  the
 economy.
 An effective economic  reform  program
 would entail a long period of politically difficult
 sacrifices with the main burden falling on urban
 dwellers. If the new military-backed government
 backs away from the difficult and unpopular re-
 forms required, it is unlikely to achieve either
 stabilization or growth.
 >'y The use of torture as a means of extracting
 information from suspected terrorists has sur-
 faced again in Brazil, following the arrests of the
 wife and a son of a former cabinet minister,
 Wilson Fadul. Both were interrogated about their
 connections with terrorist groups, and Mrs. Fadul
 later required an operation to repair damage
 caused by the beatings she received at the hands
 of army officers in Rio de Janeiro
 ii  tThe Faduls are well-connected, and friends
 brought the case to the attention of the First
 Army commander, the army minister, and the
 retired general who is the leading candidate to
 succeed President Medici. Their efforts resulted in
 an investigation which indicates that the senior
 officer involved, a colonel, is a close friend of the
 First Army commander, on whose staff he serves,
 and is also the son of a former army Chief of
 Staff.  Although  the  colonel's  career will  be
 damaged and perhaps ended by the incident, he is
 not likely to be punished any further.1
 41 2. The incident points up the different
 titudes taken by senior officers toward torture.
 Some strongly oppose it, on grounds that it re-
 flects the police mentality that some military
 elements have acquired since the armed forces
 took over the main responsibility for combating
 terrorism. Other officers condone torture as a
 necessary and effective weapon against terrorists.
 Perhaps the majority avoid taking a position on
 the issue; they tell their subordinates to get the
 ,.f-,job done and do not concern themselves about
 methods unless an embarrassing incident occurs.
 LThe rigid press censorship usually prevents
 such incidents from causing the government seri-
 ous problems. If a particular example of abuse
 becomes  too  widely known, the government
 usually either publicly denies knowledge of it or
 dismisses it as a regrettable excess by an in-
 dividual and not characteristic of the military as a
 whole. As long as many officers believe that a
 terrorist problem remains and that torture works
 in fighting the terrorists, they are not likely to
 drop jt entirely.

 American positions for dealing with the US. One
 way of accomplishing this could be through the
 expansion  of the Special Latin American Co-

 Hector Campora fell only slightly short of a ma-
