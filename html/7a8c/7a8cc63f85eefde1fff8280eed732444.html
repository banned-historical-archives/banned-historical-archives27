 VIETNAM
 North Vietnamese negotiators in Paris continue to
 hold to the unconditional cessation of the bombing
 and "all other US acts of war" as the indispensable
 first step before talks can move on to other issues.
 They have not set any timetable for US acceptance of
 this demand.   In South Vietnam itself,  fighting step-

 Hanoi's delegation to the Paris talks is keeping attention focused on
 the demand for an unconditional cessation of US bombing as the indis-
 pensable first step before taking up other issues. The North Vietnamese
 vigorously refuted Ambassador Harriman's references to points of simi-
 larity in the positions of the two sides and accused the US of trying to
 divert the talks from the bombing issue. They also sought to increase
 pressure on the US for a unilateral concession by publicly expressing
 readiness to discuss a political settlement if the bombing is halted.
 The North Vietnamese appear confident that the Paris talks provide
 an effective forum for this kind of propaganda warfare and they clearly
 intend to keep the conversations going indefinitely.
 In South Vietnam the Communists' tactics are designed to support
 the delegation in Paris by projecting an impression that they hold the
 military initiative. For this purpose, they are relying primarily on a series
 of mortar and rocket: attacks against allied installations throughout the
 country. Increased ground activity in the Khe Sanh and Da Nang areas,
 however, suggests preparations for a coordinated large-scale offensive in
 the northern provinces.
 In Saigon, President Thieu and premier-designate Tran Van Huong are
 engaged in delicate negotiations to broaden the government's political base
 without provoking a dangerous reaction from senior military figures. Vice
 President Ky and the generals reportedly recognize that they were out-
 maneuvered by Thieu in the appointment of a new prime minister, but
 they probably will work behind the scenes to resist threats to their power
 and privileges.
 The Chinese Communists continue to express displeasure over Hanoi's
 decision to enter talks with the US, but they have avoided any hints of
 reprisals, such as a reduction of their technical and material assistance to
 North Vietnam.
 Despite shrill demands in Peking's propaganda for the purge of
 additional "traitors" in the domestic political struggle, there apparently
 have been no attempts to bring down new victims since the dramatic
 ouster of acting chief of staff Yang Cheng-wu in March. This suggests that
 forces advocating further purges either have been effectively blocked or
 that they are not ready to make their next move.

 VIETNAM
 North Vietnamese negotiators
 in Paris are settling in for what
 they clearly expect to be a long
 stay.   They are conveying the im-
 pression that they are prepared
 for protracted discussions without
 the prospect of early agreement
 even on priority issues.   The dele-
 gation has moved into new quarters,
 and gives every sign of intending
 to remain indefinitely, including
 the installation of extensive new
 communications equipment.
 The North Vietnamese continue
 to hold to the unconditional cessa-
 tion of US bombing and "all other
 acts of war" as the indispensable
 first step before the talks can
 move on to other issues.   Even
 though there has been some escala-
 tion in the polemics attending ex-
 position of the Communist stand,
 the North Vietnamese have refrained
 thus far from setting any time
 limit for US acceptance of their
 demand.
 Ha Van Lau, the deputy head
 of the delegation, told a Japanese
 correspondent that even if the US
 refused to stop the bombings,  "the
 talks will continue."   He added
 that Hanoi believed the US attitude
 toward negotiations was strongly
 influenced by domestic political
 considerations and that the North
 Vietnamese did not really expect
 serious bargaining to begin until
 early August under the pressure of
 the US political conventions.
 Earlier last week, North Viet-
 namese diplomat Mai Van Bo told a
 French newsman that, although Hanoi
 had no intention of agreeing to
 any reciprocal action in return
 for a bombing halt, it was pre-
 pared to keep talking with the
 Americans so long as it appeared
 "useful."  He specifically ruled
 out the return of American pilots
 or any other "gesture" which he
 said could be used to save Ameri-
 can "face" on the reciprocity is-
 sue.
 Hanoi spokesmen in other parts
 of the world are also saying that
 North Vietnam does not intend to
 break off the talks over the bomb-
 ing issue.  A visiting North Viet-
 namese delegate to Japan told his
 hosts last week that Hanoi will not
 break away from the Paris talks
 and is prepared to take a flexible
 attitude toward the negotiations.
 As an example of this intended
 flexibility, he cited his govern-
 ment's willingness to accept a
 phased withdrawal of US forces fol-
 lowing successful peace talks, de-
 spite Hanoi's demands for "im-
 mediate" withdrawal.
 Chinese Resigned to Paris Talks
 Despite increasing evidence of
 Communist China's displeasure with
 the Paris talks, official spokes-
 men in private discussions have
 pointed up Peking's inability to
 dissuade the North Vietnamese from
 negotiating.   They have indicated
 that Peking has only limited room
 for maneuver at this stage and have
 emphasized that China will con-
 tinue to support North Vietnam in
 its war effort.

 China probably estimates that
 any attempt to reduce material sup-
 port, the only significant lever
 available to Peking, would not only
 hinder the Vietnamese war effort
 but would also undercut Chinese
 influence in Hanoi at a critical
 juncture.
 Peking continues to avoid di-
 rect comment publicly on the Paris
 meetings, but Chinese spokesmen
 have repeatedly attacked the con-
 cept of negotiations in general
 as a "hoax" and a "fraud."  Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi at a banquet on 18
 May for a visiting Guinean-Malian
 delegation bitterly denounced the
 "US imperialist scheme of peddling
 the peace negotiations swindle"
 and called on the North Vietnamese
 "to increase their resolve to fight
 and win."   Since Hanoi agreed to the
 talks on 3 April, posters in Peking
 supporting North Vietnam have been
 removed and daily small-scale pro-
 Vietnam parades and demonstrations
 have stopped.
 The War in the South
 Communist forces during the
 week combined increased activity
 in the Khe Sanh and Da Nang areas,
 possibly in preparation for a co-
 ordinated offensive in the northern
 provinces, with a series of mortar
 and rocket attacks against allied
 installations throughout the coun-
 try.   The rocket and mortar attacks
 were probably designed both for
 psychological impact and to restrict
 allied reaction forces.   Camp Evans,
 the headquarters of the US lst Air
 Cavalry Division, sustained the
 heaviest damage.   Five helicopters
 were destroyed, 79 had moderate to
 heavy damage, and 40 were lightly
 damaged.
 The attacks probably also had
 the wider purpose of supporting
 North Vietnamese negotiators in
 Paris by contributing to an impres-
 sion of continued Communist mili-
 tary initiative.   It is not clear
 how far the Communists might wish
 to carry offensive action to punc-
 tuate this stage of the Paris talks,
 but they almost certainly intend
 at least to continue causing heavy
 allied casualties, particularly US.
 In the Khe Sanh area, US 'pa-
 trols are again encountering stiff
 resistance from what are believed
 to be elements of the North Viet-
 namese 304th Division.
 Elsewhere in Quang Tri Prov-
 ince, Communist main force units,
 including elements of two North
 Vietnamese divisions, threaten, many
 vital allied positions and popu-
 lated areas.   Although some of,
 these units suffered heavy casual-
 ties in recent fighting, all are
 either already back in combat or
 getting ready for it.
 In central I Corps, allied
 forces conducted three major spoil-
 ing operations against enemy uhits
 preparing for a possible offensive
 from the southwest against Da Nang.
 The Communists, nonetheless, are
 continuing to add to their strength
 in the area.  There are indications
 that the North Vietnamese 2nd bi-
 vision is returning here, its nor-
 mal area of operations, after prob-
 ably being re-equipped.   There; are
 also tenuous signs that a newly in-
 filtrated North Vietnamese regiment
 may also be in the area.

 Huong Forming New Cabinet
 President Thieu accepted
 Premier Loc's resignation on 18
 May and a few hours later named
 Tran Van Huong to succeed him.
 Huong had a brief and troubled
 tenure as premier in late 1964 and
 early 1965, when his effectiveness
 was limited by his own inflexibil-
 ity, the opposition of the moder-
 ate Buddhists, and lack of sup-
 port from a military establishment
 which itself was deeply divided.
 Huong is widely respected never-
 theless, both because of his in-
 corruptibility and his demonstrated
 willingness to devote himself
 fully to his responsibilities.
 The new premier, with Thieu's
 blessing, is negotiating with rep-
 resentatives of South Vietnam's
 badly fractionalized political
 community in an effort to broaden
 the government's base, which under
 Loc had been limited mainly to
 technicians and military officers.
 In view of long-standing animosi-
 ties and rivalries among South
 Vietnamese politicans, Huong faces
 an up-hill task in putting to-
 gether a new team.
 Haong's appointment is not
 sitting well with Vice President
 Ky and the senior generals, who
 are reported to be miffed over
 Thieu's failure to consult with
 them.   Of probably greater weight
 in their calculations is a fear
 that Thieu, working through Huong,
 is maneuvering to displace them
 from the vortex of power through
 a civilianization  of the govern-
 ment.   Having been outmaneuvered by
 Thieu, Ky and the generals appear
 to have resigned themselves to
 the change in government.   They
 are likely to content themselves
 for the time being with a careful
 monitoring of the situation, work-
 ing behind the scenes to limit the
 inroads Thieu and H.uona can make
 into their power.
 CONFLICTS IN PEKING LEADERSHIP UNRESOLVED
 Two months after the dramatic
 ouster of acting chief of staff Yang
 Cheng-wu, propaganda media in Peking
 are still demanding the purge of ad-
 ditional "degenerates"            and "trai-

 that the forces pushing for more
 purges either have been successfully
 Page  5

 Peking on 20 May.   It appears that
 hierarchic rankings have been static
 since late March.   The new elite
 group around Mao--about 14 people--
 consists of six politburo standing
 committee members, three members of
 the Cultural Revolution Group and
 five drawn from the military and
 police.  Contrary to previous prac-
 tice these latter five are now
 ranked ahead of ordinary politburo
 members.
 The most recent turnout marked
 the second anniversary of the 16 May
 1966 central committee circular
 which gave Mao's case against polit-
 buro member Peng Chen and started
 the overt phase of the Cultural Rev-
 olution.   The most inflammatory por-
 tions of this circular were repub-
 lished, along with commentary sup-
 plied jointly by the editors of
 People's Daily, Red Flag, and Lib-
 eration Army Journal, which ap-
 pears dlesigne  two encourage greater
 revolutionary activity by radical
 elements.   The joint article said
 that considerably more "destruc-
 tion" of society will be necessary
 before "construction" can begin.
 It listed all the key "revision-
 ists" brought down thus far in the
 Cultural Revolution except the ex-
 treme leftists who were expelled
 last fall and winter.   Radical
 forces in the leadership may heave
 decided to stop publicizing the
 sins of this group, who had been
 so closely associated with their
 militant policies.
 Meanwhile violence continues
 to stall the establishment of Rev-
 olutionary Committees in the six
 remaining problem areas.   Since
 mid-April, factional fighting has
 been on the upswing again in
 Kwangtung, where a committee was
 set up in February.  At the same
 time, the acting chairman of
 Kwangtung's Provincial Revolu-
 tionary Committee--a radical who
 has been running Canton since the
 former head became chief of staff
 in Peking in March--has himself
 come under Red Guard poster attack.
 It is possible that the new chief
 of staff, who is reported to have    25X1
 returned briefly to Canton in mid-
 May, himself engineered the criti-
 cism of his acting successor.

 COMMUNIST FORCES IN LAOS CONSOLIDATE THEIR POSITIONS
 Communist forces are concen-
 trating on consolidating their
 hold over newly won territory.
 They have launched an in-
 tensive sweep operation in a fol-
 low-up to their capture of the
 major government supply base at
 Nam Bac last January.   The sweep
 has been aimed at eliminating
 friendly guerrilla teams that have
 harassed the enemy's lines of com-
 munication in recent years.  There
 are continuing reports that the
 Communists are also trying harder
 than before to control the scat-
 tered villages that have been aid-
 ing the government's guerrillas.
 An excessive use of terrorism by
 the enemy may, however, prove
 counterproductive.
 In the northeast,  heavy US
 air strikes appear to have blunted,
 at least for the time being, the
 enemy offensive against the govern-
 ment guerrilla base at Na Khang.
 Although the capture of Na Khang
 would severely hamper government
 operations in the northeast and
 would put the finishing touches to
 the Communists' most successful dry
 season offensive in many years, it
 is far from certain that the Com-
 munists are willing to sustain
 heavy losses to take it.
 In the south, Communist
 forces are making further efforts
 to consolidate their control of the
 Sedone Valley, the  scene of a
 major government development pro-
 gram over the past few years. The
 Communists are using both propa-
 ganda and terrorism to control a
 populace that has in the past
 proved friendly to the government.
 In some  instances  sympathetic
 groups have been given weapons and
 trained as local militia, but the
 majority of the people appear;to
 be resisting close identification
 with the Communists.   Pathet  ao
 cadre are making a special of ort,
 however, to convince the fence-
 sitters that the government will
 not be able to re-establish itself
 in the valley.
 The Communists evidently'in-
 tend to maintain a substantial mil-
 itary presence in the northern
 part of the Bolovens Plateau. They
 continue to move supplies into the
 area via Route 23 and are estab-     25X1
 lishing a medical facility for the
 many North Vietnamese troops still

 Tensions are high in several countries of West and East Europe.
 The French Government survived a vote of censure by 11 votes. The
 vote came after the government offered to negotiate directly with the
 unions to end the walkouts that have paralyzed the nation. Union leaders
 said they were ready to negotiate but presented sweeping demands. The
 powerful National Committee of French Employers, meanwhile, decided
 to oppose any bilateral agreement between the government and the unions
 that would increase wage costs.
 Moscow's heavy pressure on Czechoslovakia, now well into its third
 week, has had little visible effect on the leaders in Prague. Premier
 Kosygin, in Czechoslovakia for an extended stay, had two conferences
 with Czechoslovak leaders the past week. He may leave on the eve of the
 Czechoslovak party's central committee plenum opening 29 May and will
 probably try again to gain some commitment from Dubcek to moderate
 his regime's policies.
 Soviet Defense Minister Grechko and some high Soviet brass spent
 five, presumably not very congenial, days in Prague before winning Czech-
 oslovak agreement to participate in "fair-sized" 'Warsaw Pact maneuvers.
 The pace of the political struggle in Warsaw has visibly slowed, in
 part because of the regime's nervousness over the situation in Czecho-
 slovakia. There may also have been some pressure from Moscow to
 postpone any changes..
 East Germany, to assert its independence, sovereignty and strength,
 may introduce additional controls over West German travel to West Berlin.

 PRAGUE STILL PARRIES SOVIET PRESSURES
 The virtually simultaneous
 arrival in Prague last Friday
 of Premier Kosygin and a high-
 level Soviet military delegation
 suggested Moscow had made an ur-
 gent and possibly climactic effort
 to check what it considered to
 be a deteriorating situation in
 Czechoslovakia.
 The visits were the latest
 in a series of confrontations. Mos-
 cow presumably is now seeking more
 than the verbal assurances with
 which Prague has responded to
 earlier Soviet criticisms.   While
 the leaders talked, Moscow main-
 tained the psychological pres-
 sure by keeping most of its mil-
 itary units in place near the
 Czechoslovak borders.   Reports
 in Soviet and Polish news media
 that a joint Soviet-Polish Warsaw
 Pact exercise took place in south-
 ern Poland were a belated Soviet
 attempt to explain the deployment
 of its troops to the Czechoslo-
 vak-Polish border.
 The military delegation,
 headed by Minister of Defense
 Grechko, probably pressed Prague
 for evidence of its intention to
 continue cooperation with the
 Warsaw Pact and apparently got
 some relatively modest conces-
 sions.   Czechoslovak Minister of
 Defense Dzur announced on 21 May
 that Prague would participate in
 "fair sized" maneuvers this sum-
 mer.               He added, however, that the
 maneuvers would not involve "big
 contingents" of troops.   Dzur
 also stated that he would head
 a military delegation to the So-
 viet Union, which suggests that
 the question of military cooper-
 ation is not yet completely set-
 tled.
 There are no signs that
 Kosygin, who is scheduled to`re-
 main in Czechoslovakia until at
 least 28 May, and the Czechoslo-
 vak leaders are making much prog-
 ress in their negotiations.   A
 Czechoslovak spokesman said last
 week that the USSR is still pon-
 sidering Prague's request for a
 foreign currency credit equiva-
 lent to $400-500 million.   If the
 USSR withholds the credit or.
 refuses to assure the continued
 supply of raw materials to Czech-
 oslovakia, Prague's probes for
 economic aid from the West prob-
 ably will be accelerated.
 Kosygin is probably demand-
 ing that the Czechoslovak lead-
 ers suppress opposition to and
 criticism of the party.   Thus
 far, the Czechoslovaks have held
 their ground.
 Factional fighting within
 the Czechoslovak party may come
 to a climax during a central
 committee plenum which begins
 on 29 May.   Liberals have added
 to their earlier pressure by
 calling upon the conservatives
 to resign voluntarily.
 The party presidium report-
 edly has decided to recommend
 that an extraordinary congress
 be convened at which the liblrals
 could move against the conserva-
 tives.  Dubcek, however, will

 probably oppose the attempt by
 liberals to force the factional
 issue at the plenum, particu-
 larly because he is under So-
 viet pressure to rein them in.
 The conservatives have re-
 cently been more outspoken in
 criticizing the liberal trend,
 and there are no signs that they
 intend to resign.   Diplomats in
 Prague believe the conservatives'
 strength has been underrated, and
 speculate that they will be ma-
 neuvering actively at the plenum.
 FRENCH GOVERNMENT MOVES TO EASE TURMOIL
 An estimated 7-8 million work-
 ers--about half of the industrial
 labor force--are on strike and
 rebellious students continue to
 occupy universities throughout
 France.
 Premier Pompidou's midweek
 offer to hold a dialogue with the
 unions was immediately accepted
 and could be a breakthrough. In an
 effort to keep the university prob-
 lem in the background and to con-
 centrate on the more serious na-
 tionwide strike, the government
 had approved an amnesty for those
 involved in the student disturb-
 ances.          A new outbreak occurred,
 however, when a disorderly student
 march flared into violence on 23
 May.   The march was called to pro-
 test the government's refusal to
 allow "new left" leader Cohn-Bendit
 to return to France following trips
 to Germany and Holland.
 The dilemma the government now
 faces is to offer enough conces-
 sions to satisfy the workers with-
 out undermining the economy. The
 problem is complicated further by
 the Patronat, France's powerful as-
 sociation of factory owners and
 managers, which opposes major con-
 cessions to the unions and a di-
 rect government role in any nego-
 tions.   Occupation of factories by
 workers and the tactical "alliance"
 of all the major unions against the
 government give labor a strong bar-
 gaining position.   Strains between
 the Communist-controlled General
 Confederation of Labor and other
 unions have begun to appear, how-
 ever, and the government may be
 able to exploit the disunity.
 In offering to talk, the gov-
 ernment took a significant step to
 ease the crisis.   The workers do
 have legitimate economic grievances,
 but a deeper problem is the per-
 vasive sense of being incapable of
 influencing both politics and eco-
 nomics.   The coming dialogue at
 least gives the workers a direct
 channe:L to the powers that be, some-
 thing they have lacked in recent
 years.
 The government might couple
 its offer to talk with concessions
 calculated to defuse the crisis.
 There have been indications that
 cabinet: changes are under consider-
 ation, although the timing of such
 changes is uncertain. Another pos-
 sibility is a nationwide referendum.
 Given the depth of dissatisfaction
 over the government's economic and
 social policies, however, turning
 to the people is risky and De Gaulle
 would have to choose carefully what
 issues to          efore them.

 SOVIET GENERAL AFFIRMS FLEXIBLE RESPONSE MILITARY DOCTRINE
 A senior Soviet general has
 affirmed flexible response as an
 important part of Soviet military
 doctrine.   He has refuted Marshal
 Sokolovsky's famous treatise,
 Military Strategy, which holds
 that any future war between nu-
 clear powers will inevitably
 escalate into a general nuclear
 conflict.
 the enemy a "crushing blow of
 decisive significance."
 Colonel General M.  Povaly,
 who is believed to be responsible
 for operational planning in the
 Soviet General Staff, recently
 told US military attaches in
 Moscow that the latest edition
 of Sokolovsky's book--published
 in November 1967--was obsolete
 and that US officials would be
 wasting their time reading it.
 At the high point of a distin-
 guished career Marshal Sokolov-
 sky served as Chief of the Gen-
 eral Staff (1952-1960)  and,
 until his death two weeks ago,
 was a member of the Inspector
 General Group of aged, semi-
 retired military leaders.
 Povaly's charge probably
 is directed primarily at Sokolov-
 sky's opinion that flexible
 response is not feasible.   The
 initial period of a future war
 will be decisive, the marshal
 claimed in his book, and the
 Soviet Union will be able to
 detect preparations for a "sur-
 prise nuclear attack" and deal
 (that
 nuclear powers might not employ
 nuclear weapons in the beginning
 of a conflict or for -some period
 thereafter.  He endorsed the
 rationale of the US strategy of
 flexible response in a Red Star
 article printed last March. ~When
 a US attache recently asked if
 the USSR's strategy resembled
 that of flexible response,
 Povaly replied, "Soviet strat-
 egy has no label, but the Soviet
 Union is ready to meet whatever
 the situation requires."  His
 views seem more in line with pre-
 dominant Soviet military think-
 ing than do those of Sokolovsky.
 The Soviet military leader-
 ship has given more attention to
 adapting its general purpose
 forces for use in limited con-
 flict situations.   The Soviet
 fleet in now operating in appre-
 ciable strength, with obvious
 political effect, in the Mediter-
 ranean.   Besides showing the flag,
 it is capable of supporting very
 limited landing operations with
 its integral elements.   Moreover,
 as the new AN-22 Cock transport
 aircraft comes into service, the
 Soviet Union will have an im
 proved ability to move military
 forces to more distant areas.

 RUMANIAN REGIME SOFT PEDALS DE GAULLE'S VISIT
 President de Gaulle's "Eu-
 rope for the Europeans" mission
 to Rumania from 14 to 18 May en-
 hanced Bucharest's international
 prestige, but achieved little
 else.   The tension in Eastern
 Europe probably induced some
 restraint and dampened the stri-
 dent nationalism customarily
 expected of De Gaulle and Ru-
 manian party and state chief
 Nicolae Ceausescu.   De Gaulle
 left a day early because of the
 French domestic crisis.
 In his speech to the Ruma-
 nian parliament, De Gaulle re-
 marked that no European nation
 should submit to a "shameful
 effacement of national sover-
 eignty" by being caught in a
 conflict between "two great
 powers confronting each other
 along a line which is exterior

 to their own borders."  Ceausescu
 did not rebuke De Gaulle for h's
 statements, as Poland's Gomulka
 did last fall, but he "clarified"
 selected sensitive points later
 with accompanying reporters.
 A bland communique at the,
 visit's end skirted such touchy
 issues as the German question,:
 the future of military blocs, and
 differing stands on the Middle.
 East.  Predictably, however, it
 stressed the "special" role of
 France and Rumania in promoting
 European detente and called for
 the establishment of a joint gov-
 ernmental commission to promote
 economic and technical-scientific
 cooperations.   The two sides also
 agreed to a consular convention
 and to establish French librar.es
 in Bucharest and Rumanian librar-
 ies in Paris.

 POLISH PARTY STRUGGLE TEMPORARILY DORMANT
 The pace of the intraparty
 struggle in Poland has slowed
 temporarily and neither of the
 contending factions has won a
 decisive victory. The infight-
 ing may break out again at a
 party plenum reportedly to be
 held within the next six weeks.
 Since early May propaganda
 against "Zionists" and other
 internal enemies has been con-
 ducted in low key and purges
 appear to have fallen off.   Stu-
 dents and other elements of the
 population have been quiet, with
 party leaders apparently giving
 only cursory public attention to
 the intraparty situation?
 No decisive personnel or
 policy changes have occurred nor
 have shifts in government posts
 last month been followed by
 changes in the upper echelons
 of the party.   Some changes may
 be announced at the forthcoming
 party plenum.   Since March, how-
 ever, purges of Jews and liberals
 have affected significant areas
 of the bureacracy as well as
 academic and artistic life.
 Anxiety over the future has
 caused indecision and delays
 at all levels of the party and
 state apparatus.
 The regime's nervousness
 over the situation in Czecho-
 slovakia, and possible Soviet
 pressure to postpone party
 changes in Warsaw, may have
 induced the truce, as well as
 the factions' fear of losing
 control over zealous activists.
 This lull may help party
 boss Gomulka reassert his author-
 ity, but there is little likeli-
 hood he will regain his former
 pre-eminence.   The impact of last
 year's Middle East crisis and of
 the student disturbances in March
 has shaken the Polish party,
 and imparted an irreversible
 impetus for change.   The under-
 lying forces of nationalism,
 economic dissatisfaction, and
 frustrated ambitions of the
 postwar generation have not
 been satisfied, and will have
 to be considered in any recon-
 struction of the party.

 ITALIAN ELECTIONS RETAIN CENTER-LEFT GOVERNMENT
 The Unified Socialist Party's
 losses in the 19-20 May elections
 seem likely to strengthen those
 in the party who favor a hard
 look at continued participation
 in the center-left government.
 The party had hoped to win
 100-110 seats and get back some
 15 of the 24 seats held by the
 Moscow-oriented, Proletarian
 Socialist Party which opposes
 Socialist participation in the
 governing coalition.  As it
 turned out, the Unified Social-
 ists won 91 seats and pressures
 may develop to divide into new
 right and left wing Socialist
 parties.
 No alternative to some form
 of Christian Democratic - Socialist
 coalition appears feasible, but
 the Socialists may delay a de-
 cision on joining the government
 until after their party congress
 next fall.   They will, however,
 probably support or participate
 in a transitional government
 under Christian Democratic lead-
 ership for the intervening period.
 The Christian Democrats won
 six additional seats and now
 hold 266 in the 630-seat parlia-
 ment, and Premier Moro is the
 leading candidate to head a new
 government.  The small, left-
 center  Republican Party, the
 third member of the coalition,
 increased its representation'
 from five to nine.  The parties
 to the right--Monarchists, Fas-
 cists, and Liberals--dropped
 from 74 seats to 61.
 The Communist Party gained
 11 seats for a total of 177
 while the Proletarian Socialists
 lost only one seat to retain ,a
 strength of 23.
 The strength of the far
 left, in part, is a result of.
 the absence of any other major
 opposition to the government.
 In addition, the Communists evi-
 dently attracted the protest
 vote from youth voting for the
 first time.
 Nevertheless, the Commu-
 nists' hopes for an election
 outcome that would, at least
 mathematically, permit a coali-
 tion with the Proletarian So-
 cialists, the Unified Socialists
 and the Republicans were not
 realized.  The four left-of-
 center parties won a total of
 300 Chamber of Deputies seats,
 47.6 percent of the total.

 Much of the area is threatened with a serious -locust plague this

 cohesive and viable federation
 have so far proved unsurmountable.
 The strongest opposition to
 the federation comes from Iran,
 which lays claim to Bahrain, one
 of the member states, as Iran
 irredenta.   It also sees the union
 as another Arab puppet state, ripe
 for Egyptian domination.   Iran re-
 gards Nasir as the greatest threat
 to its security in the gulf area.
 At the same time, both Nasir and
 Saudi Arabia's Faysal, two of the
 federation's strongest enthusiasts,
 have failed to take energetic
 steps to assist its development.
 Effective support from them has
 been keenly missed in the face of
 strong-arm Iranian diplomacy.
 Most of the federation members are
 close to Iran in terms of social
 and religious orientation as well
 as geography, and without strong
 Arab backing, their Arabism is
 apt to falter.
 Within the membership of the
 federation, traditional divisive-
 ness continues to erode the pub-
 licized union.   This divisiveness
 stems from the differences of
 wealth among the states, the
 varying degrees of political so-
 phistication of their rulers, the
 orientation of their foreign re-
 lations, and a hodge-podge of
 traditional feuds and petty quar-
 rels.   The recent behavior of the
 ruler of Abu Dhabi in doling out
 millions of dollars in tribal
 gifts has encouraged the suspicion
 that he means to make the federa-
 tion his own instrument.   Bahrain,
 on the other hand, believes that
 the other rulers are far too
 friendly with Iran, whose terri-
 torial. ambitions are regarded as
 the chief reason for Bahrain to
 seek safety in numbers.
 This interplay of enmities
 so far has prevented any practi-
 cal measures for implementing the
 federation.  The rulers of the
 component states are scheduled
 to meet on 25 May to review this
 state of affairs.   They will
 attempt to resolve their differ-
 ences, but if their talks enable
 the federation to continue, even
 in name only, there may emerge a
 new form of federation, different
 perhaps in number of members as
 well as in organization.
 NIGERIAN PEACE TALKS BEGIN IN UGANDA
 On 23 May, federal and Bia-
 fran representatives were to be-
 gin peace talks in Kampala, Uganda.
 The talks are likely to be pro-
 tracted and acrimonious.   Biafra
 apparently believes that its rec-
 ognition by four African countries
 has significantly strengthened its
 political position, whereas Lagos
 has virtually clinched a military
 victory in the civil war with the
 capture of Port Harcourt.

 The talks in Kampala must re-
 solve procedural items left over
 from the preliminary talks in Lon-
 don before getting into the more
 crucial matters of a cease-fire
 and political settlement.  Lagos
 is expected to insist that there
 be no chairman and reportedly also
 does not want any foreign observ-
 ers at the talks.
 The federal government, never-
 theless, has been somewhat sus-
 ceptible to international pres-
 sures and could choose to be more
 -forthcoming on procedural matters
 now that its key military objec-
 tive of recent weeks--Port Har-
 court--has been captured.   Lagos,
 however, will not yield on its
 substantive position that before
 a cease-fire can take effect Biafra
 must renounce secession and accept
 the 12-state federal structure.
 The Federal Military Govern-
 ment has named a negotiating team
 of 17 delegates and advisers headed
 by Information Minister Enahoro,
 who conducted the earlier talks
 in London.  The federal group
 includes a number of minority
 tribesmen, as well as one Ibo
 from the former Eastern region.
 The Biafrans are sending five
 delegates, including Sir Louis
 Mbanefo, who also was at London,
 and Dr. Okpara, top political ad-
 viser to Ojukwu.
 Nigeria's ruling supreme
 Military Council has reportedly
 endorsed the recommendation of
 army field commanders to continue
 military operations until the
 Biafran army is destroyed or
 capitulates.  Ojukwu, however,
 in two recent speeches has ex-
 horted the Ibos to fight on, even
 from the forests if necessary,
 and the civil war may well con-
 tinue for a long time.   In the,
 wake of the federal capture of
 Port Harcourt, Biafran forces
 are disorganized. Federal
 troops on the other hand are well
 equipped and supplied and appear
 to have adequate leadership.
 Biafra may be continuing
 its air shuttle service by using
 another airfield farther north'
 now that it cannot use Port Hax-
 court.  Unless sizable quanti-
 ties of new supplies can be
 brought in, the Biafra military
 effort will begin to collapse and
 could degenerate in time into
 protracted guerrilla warfare,
 particularly in the absence of     25X1
 a political settlement acceptable
 to the Ibos.

 INDIA'S CONGRESS PARTY REVIVING AT THE POLLS
 The Congress Party, after
 more than a year of reaping the
 bitter fruits of the 1967 general
 elections, has made some progress
 at the polls, but still faces
 many obstacles in regaining the
 substantial ground it lost in
 many of the states.
 Last week's victory :by Con-
 gress in the Haryana state assem-
 bly elections, the first state-
 wide polling since the general
 elections, capped a series of
 favorable electoral bouts for the
 party.   In Communist-dominated
 Kerala, Congress recently made
 substantial advances in a series
 of municipal elections, and in
 Rajasthan the party dealt a
 strong blow to the conservative
 Swatantra party in two prestigious
 by-elections.
 These limited triumphs should
 boost Congress morale as it pre-
 pares for what promises to be
 bitterly fought midterm elections
 in the much larger and more impor-
 tant states of Uttar Pradesh and
 West Bengal later this year.
 There is bound to be a measure of
 bandwagon effect, but local issues
 will be decisive in these elec-
 tions.   In both states factional-
 ism continues to hurt the party.
 As in Haryana, however, voters in
 Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have
 suffered the chastening experience
 of inept rule by non-Congress co-
 alitions.  This factor is bound
 to work to the Congress Party's
 advantage.
 Meanwhile, the party is hav-
 ing considerable trouble with the
 highly unstable political situation
 that has evolved in several other
 states.  At the heart of the prob-
 lem is the difficulty in maintain-
 ing stable majorities.  The Con-
 gress precedent in Haryana of
 denying a place on the party slate
 to defectors may alleviate this
 problem, but is unlikely to cure
 it.   At least three more non-Con-
 gress governments are approaching
 the brink of dissolution, but Con-
 gress units in these states are
 in no position to take over.

 ELECTION OUTLOOK IN TURKEY
 The Turkish electorate goes to
 the polls on 2 June to fill 52 of
 the 183 seats in the senate, five
 vacancies in the lower house, and
 all municipal and local government
 posts.   As the pre-election campaign
 enters its final week, the incumbent
 Justice Party (JP) appears almost
 certain to capture as much as 55-60
 percent of the popular vote and rhost
 of the contested parliamentary
 seats.   Moreover, initial reports
 from several key areas suggest that
 the JP probably will win a majority
 of the municipal contests.
 The campaign thus far has fo-
 cused primarily on general party
 orientation and on personalities
 rather than on current issues.  -Re-
 ligious reactionism--a perennial
 charge against the JP--economic de-
 velopment, and the left-right con-
 frontation, however, have been the
 subject of partisan propaganda.
 Anti-Americanism per se has not been
 a major issue but is being exploited
 by the leftist Turkish Labor Party
 (TLP).
 There have been few surprises
 in the campaign; however, unexpected
 cleavages appeared in the JP during
 the earlier party primaries.  These
 have been glossed over during the
 ensuing campaign.  The governing JP
 shows every sign of being confident
 of victory, but over-confidence
 could cost it votes.   The relatively
 mediocre performance of parliament
 during the past two years does not
 seem to be an issue with the elec-
 torate which is more impressed by
 the country's general economic prog-
 ress in recent years.   The JP in its
 campaign has come out more openly
 against the TLP, accusing it of being
 crypto-Communist.
 Page  24
 The major opposition Republican
 Peoples Party  (RPP),  led by octoge-
 narian Ismetlnonu, expects to gain
 little from the election.   The, party
 lost many of its supporters among the
 landed gentry to the new Reliance
 Party which was organized following
 the RPP split between moderates and
 the left-of-center faction last spring.
 If the RPP receives less than 30
 percent of thepopular vote, Bulent
 Ecivet, party secretary general and
 head of the left-of-center faction,
 may be ousted in favor of a more con-
 servative leader.
 The conservative Reliance Party,
 headed by Turhan Feyzioglu, has had
 little time to organize nationally
 and is generally regarded as too
 middle-of-the-road to attract much
 popular support.
 The Marxist TLP, on the other
 hand, is expected to do well iri gain-
 ing popular votes, but probably will
 not add to its 15 seats in parliament.
 During the past three years, the TLP
 has been bolstering its nationwide
 organization and has succeeded. in at-
 tracting some of the more leftist
 members of the RPP.
 Should the JP win more than
 57-58 percent of the popular vote
 Prime Minister Demirel's moderate
 position within the party will be
 strengthened, and the JP will have
 more confidence in implementing its
 program. A larger majority could lead
 to increased pressure within the party
 to muzzle the extreme left. Anover-
 whelming majority could also result
 in opposition attempts to undermine,
 through propaganda and rumor, the good,
 working relationship between the JP
 and the military in an attempt to
 cause the downfall of the regime which
 largely represents the old Democratic
 tion in 1960.

 The hemisphere's most dramatic event of the week occurred in Haiti,
 where a small, non-Communist Haitian exile force staged an unsuccessful
 invasion attempt on 20 May that was squelched within two days. Another
 bloody purge of Haitians suspected of working against Duvalier seems
 inevitable.
 Chances for avoiding a violent political showdown in Panama re-
 mained rather poor even though National Guard Commandant Vallarino
 decided not to obstruct the certification of an evidently decisive victory
 by Arnulfo Arias in the presidential elections on 12 May. Public announce-
 ment of the official results of the balloting has been delayed, however,
 while backers of government candidate David Samudio seek through voting
 officials under their control to get their man declared the winner.
 Electoral developments in other countries of the hemisphere are
 proceeding more routinely. The Dominican municipal elections on 16 May
 were accomplished quietly, with mixed results that could be hailed by
 each political faction as a "victory" for its own cause. Bermuda's first
 legislative elections as an autonomous political entity were won by the
 predominantly white pro-British United  Bermuda Party   on 22 May.
 Preparations for Ecuador's presidential election on 2 June continued to go
 forward relatively calmly, amidst growing indications that a rather tight
 race is developing among the top three candidates.
 Political tension climbed in Argentina last week as a result of indica-
 tions that a showdown between President Ongania and his military critics,
 headed by army chief Julio Alsogaray, was imminent. A misstep by either
 Ongania or Alsogaray could provoke an open clash, in which the President
 would probably come out on top.
 In Chile, President Frei's annual state of the nation address to
 Congress on 21 May was boycotted by legislators of all five leftist parties
 because of violence that had erupted between government forces and
 striking teachers the previous day. His speech contained an appeal for
 action on his reform program that he seems unlikely to get--precisely
 because of the excessive political partisanship he denounced during his

 OUTCOME OF PANAMA'S ELECTION STILL UNCERTAIN
 The official counting of bal-
 lots to determine the winner of the
 presidential and legislative elec-
 tions on 12 May continues amid con-
 fusion, government efforts to delay
 the process, and charges of elec-
 toral fraud by both sides.  Although
 the government-supported Samudio
 forces are still trying to rig the
 returns, National Guard Commandant
 Vallarino is no longer supporting
 the official candidate and is ig-
 noring orders from the Robles gov-
 ernment.
 In a communi-
 que issued on 17 May, Vallarino
 emphasized the unity of the guard
 and intimated acceptance of the de-
 cisions of the National Elections
 Board, which is legally charged with
 counting the votes and proclaiming
 the winner.
 Although the board is weighted
 in Arias' favor, the US ambas*ador
 expects the government to try'to
 keep it from declaring Arias pres-
 ident-elect.  While the board'is
 legally authorized to grant cre-
 dentials to the winner, the gov-
 ernment-controlled Electoral Tri-
 bunal can nullify the board's:
 findings.  Any attempt by the,gov-
 ernment to annul the board's de-
 cision and call for new elections,
 however, would hinge on the posi-
 tion taken by Vallarino.   His
 agreement with Arias puts the`pro-
 Samudio forces in a weak position
 to enforce its claims.
 Explosions, sniper fire,; and
 terrorism are creating a mood. of
 growing tension.   Serious violence
 erupted again in Panama City on
 23 May when Samudio toughs touched
 off disorders near the building
 where the elections board has'been
 conducting its count.   Twenty-two
 persons were injured during the
 ensuing gun battle.
 Meanwhile, irresponsible' news
 media on both sides are adding
 fuel to the fire.  A rabble-rousing
 pro-Samudio tabloid, headlining
 its story "Samudio or Chaos,"re-
 ported the formation of a popular
 militia to kill "oligarchs" atd
 their children and burn their'
 houses if Samudio is defeated.  As
 the contested election continues
 unresolved, the potential forvio-

 HAITIAN EXILE INVASION FAILS
 The invasion
 of
 northern
 Haiti by a group
 of
 25 to
 30
 non-
 Communist exiles
 on
 20 May
 was
 suppressed by government forces
 the next day, leaving President
 Duvalier in as strong a position
 as ever.
 After an ineffectual aerial
 bombing of the National Palace
 in Port-au-Prince, the invaders
 captured the airfield at Cap-
 Haitien and took the military
 commander of the north prisoner.
 Their plan to bring in a second
 group of approximately 100 men
 from the launching point in the
 Bahamas was  frustrated, however,
 by the government's recapture of
 the field the following morning.
 The invasion leaders--who had
 been involved in prior attempts
 in 1963 and 1964--reportedly es-
 caped.    Some 18 of the other
 insurgents also remain at large
 and there may be skirmishes as
 military units and militia at-
 tempt to track them down.
 The invasion was sponsored
 by the Haitian Coalition--a non-
 Communist Haitian exile group
 based in New York.   The invasion
 failed because of inadequate or-
 ganization on the part of the
 exile group, which was not able
 to reinforce or resupply the in-
 vaders.   The exiles also mis-
 judged the capability and loyalty
 of Duvalier's security forces as
 well as the extent of popular
 support that would be forthcoming.
 Duvalier reacted calmly and
 confidently.    He dispatched approx-
 imately 200 of his most effective
 tactical troops to the area under
 the leadership of the
 capable Lt. Col. Franck Romain.
 Romain distinguished himself in
 a campaign against a group of
 invaders in 1964.   The secret
 police immediately began to ar-
 rest all potential government
 opponents as well as relatives
 of the invaders.  Duvalier de-
 liberately kept news of the in-
 vasion from the public until
 the situation was well under
 control.
 The invasion attempt is
 likely to reinforce Duvalier's
 underlying bitterness and antag-
 onism toward the United States.
 He appears convinced that the
 US was involved in the plans
 and suggested as much in a note
 to the UN on 22 May requesting
 a special meeting of the Secu-
 rity Council.   He protested
 anti-Haitian propaganda by
 American news media and the
 alleged presence of US "warships"
 in the area.

 ECUADOREAN ELECTION CAMPAIGN NEARS THE FINISH LINE
 Preparations for Ecuador's
 presidential and congressional
 elections on 2 June are proceed-
 ing smoothly..           Little fraud is
 expected, and the role of the
 military probably will be lim-
 ited to guaranteeing order.
 Center-left candidate Andres
 Cordova continues to gain strength
 at the expense of the two leading
 candidates,                   Jose
 Maria Velasco and conservative
 Camilo Ponce.  Clashes between
 Velasquistas and center-left sup-
 porters are continuing; such vio-
 lence is a measure both of the
 closeness of the presidential
 race and depth of the political
 passions it has aroused.   Rowdy
 antics of followers of former
 president Carlos Julio Arosemena,
 who is supporting Velasco, will
 probably cost the Velasquista
 congressional ticket some support,
 although Carlos  Julio is virtu-
 ally assured of winning a senate
 seat.
 There is some military un-
 easiness over the possibility
 that Carlos Julio might go on to
 win the Senate presidency, which
 would put only the vice presi-
 dent--a nonentity--between him and
 the presidency.   The US Embassy
 comments that while the military
 would be reluctant to overthrow
 a popularly elected Velasco gov-
 ernment, it would not take
 lightly the idea that Arosemena
 could regain a position of real
 power.
 A total of 1,198,987 citi-
 zens--some 21 percent of the
 population--are registered to.
 vote, and observers expect that
 approximately 850,000 of them
 will actually cast their ballots.
 This would be an increase of
 100,000 over the vote in the 1960
 presidential elections.
 At the request of President
 Otto Arosemena, the Organization
 of American States will send a
 group of observers headed by a
 Panamanian to monitor the elec-
 tions.  Although the observers
 could verify that the govern-
 ment's organization and admini-
 stration of the elections are
 relatively honest and efficient,
 they would be in no position to
 evaluate the principal opposi-

 POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DETERIORATION IN URUGUAY
 President Pacheco's pros-
 pects for dealing with Uruguay's
 basic economic problems have been
 dimmed by a protracted cabinet
 crisis and by labor agitation.
 Although Pacheco managed to
 form a new cabinet after the old
 one resigned a month ago, the
 subsequent resignation of Inte-
 rior Minister Legnani demonstrated
 the continued lack of political
 stability and has sparked rumors
 of further resignations..
 Finance Minister Cesar Char-
 lone now is under attack by Com-
 munists and other opposition
 elements within the legislature
 because of his identification
 with the unpopular economic aus-
 terity program.   Pacheco report-
 edly will defend him by all con-
 stitutional means and has threat-
 ened to dissolve Congress and
 call for new elections if Char-
 lone is forced to resign.
 Outside the cabinet, Central
 Bank President Enrique Iglesias
 has been severely criticized in
 government circles for his role
 in the latest currency devalua-
 tion.   Charges were made that a
 cabinet: minister or top bank
 official leaked advance word of
 the devaluation to foreign ex-
 change speculators, and Pacheco
 authorized a Senate investigation.
 Although the investigation
 is not completed, the Senate is
 attempting to publish a confi-
 dential. Central Bank Report that
 would trend to embarrass Iglesias
 regardless of his guilt or inno-
 cence.   Press reports continue
 to speculate that both Iglesias
 and Charlone will resign.
 A dramatic increase in la-
 bor agitation is threatening
 Pacheco's wage stabilization
 policies.   A recent offer to
 government workers would increase
 salary expenditures by approxi-
 mately 20 percent, compared with
 the 17 percent a representative
 of the International Monetary
 Fund had earlier described as
 the limit the government can
 afford.   Even with the more gen-
 erous crovernment offer, worker
 demands have not been met and
 organized labor may feel that
 its position is strong enough to
 hold out for still higher wages
 and benefits.

 GOVERNING PARTY WINS DOMINICAN ELECTIONS
 President Balaguer's govern-
 ing Reformist Party  (PR) won
 heavily in last week's municipal
 elections in the Dominican Re-
 public.
 Provisional returns released
 by the Central Electoral Board
 show the PR winning in 66 of the
 77 municipalities contested.   In
 patronage-rich Santo Domingo the
 party polled slightly more than
 65 percent of the vote, and in
 the country's second largest
 city, Santiago, its plurality
 was over 47 percent.   Independent
 slates topped the balloting in
 nine contests, and the Social
 Christians won in two.   The left-
 of-center Dominican Revolutionary
 Party, which had controlled 13
 local governments including Santo
 Domingo, abstained on grounds
 that the elections were rigged
 by the PR.
 Slightly over 55 percent of
 an estimated 1.8 million eligible
 voters turned out for what has
 been termed one of the most
 orderly elections in the nation's
 history.   In the 1966 presiden-
 tial and congressional elections,
 79 percent of the estimated 1.7
 million voters went to the polls.
 The size of the vote was.
 held down by heavy rains on elec-
 tion day and the local rather
 than national character of the
 elections, as well as by the
 abstention of all opposition
 parties except the Social Chris-
 tians.
 Reactions to the outcome,
 have included charges of fraud
 by defeated candidates.   Comm4-
 nist elements have interpreted
 what they call a mediocre turn-
 out as a repudiation of the
 Balaguer government.   The Pre4i-
 dent has described the result$
 as the "worst defeat of the oppo-
 sition."                                                            The Social Christians,
 however, were cheered by their
 performance as they quadrupled
 the vote they received in the
 1966 elections.
 There were scattered minor
 incidents of violence, but plans
 to disrupt the election never
 materialized, in part because:
 of heavy security precautions,
