 Voice of the Editor
 The Marxian Trend
 O VERRIDING the President's veto, Congress has
 voted a 7 percent pay increase for one and one-
 half million federal employees. This adds more than $750
 million to the federal budget every year. Moreover, it
 comes on top of a 10 percent increase for these workers
 just two years ago.
 It has long been the custom of Congress to appropri-
 ate large sums for a great variety of "pork barrel" proj-
 ects before election. To this destructive practice has now
 been added the biennial increases in pay for Civil Serv-
 ice workers and welfare handouts for Social Security
 beneficiaries and numerous other segments of our popu-
 lation.
 Those who have not yet found places on this gravy-
 train are spurred on to demand increases for themselves.
 Their pleas appeal to the sense of justice of the American
 people and are granted. Soon we come full circle and
 the groups getting the first raises demand the second
 installment and the spiral continues upward.
 We have become a nation of thieves wherein our citi-
 zenry align themselves in a vast number of pressure
 groups each striving to see how much it can get from the
 public purse. There is no foreseeable end to this practice
 short of ruinous inflation and bankruptcy. The longer it
 goes on, the harder it is to stop and it has already been
 gathering momentui.i for many years.
 The real danger to America is not external but lies
 rather in covetousness and the now well-organized effort
 to increase one's income at the expense of his fellows.
 When government has the power to take money from
 some and give it to others it becomes the victim of the
 stronger pressure groups and the attention of the coun-
 try is more and more focused on obtaining wealth from
 others rather than the creation of new wealth. In time
 that process will decapitalize us and reduce us toward a
 basis of equality wherein gifted men and women are not
 rewarded in proportion to their exceptional abilities.
 Their efforts will decline accordingly, and we shall all be
 much poorer as the result thereof.
 No society can long endure which denies to its ex-
 ceptionally creative people sufficient reward to stimulate
 them to their best endeavors.
 Regarding federal employees it should be said more-
 over that their work is steady; they are not in danger of
 layoffs; vacations are generous and fringe benefits of
 various kinds considerably above the level of these avail-
 able for other workers. In view of these facts and in fur-
 ther view of the very significant ? fact that every effort
 should be made to discourage the growth of bureaucracy,
 public employees should receive rather less than the nor-
 mal scale available to private employees. If they should
 feel aggrieved by reason of this fact, the remedy is
 always to seek employment in privately owned industry
 or in the professions and as managers of small businesses.
 No one is compelled to work for government and if he
 chooses to do so, should be willing to accept some dis-
 advantages in return for greater security and other bene-
 fits mentioned above.
 There is rarely any lack of applicants for public posi-
 tions. Such jobs are very popular and offer many bene-
 fits. Remuneration therefore, may very properly be
 somewhat lower than for non-government workers. No
 one has a moral right, it seems to us, to accept a job
 which offers many advantages and then seek to bludgeon
 his fellows into paying him just as much as he might earn
 in a non-government job with less satisfactory working
 conditions and less generous fringe benefits.
 The only just basis of determining remuneration for
 any worker, is the free market wherein his fellows bid
 for the goods he produces or the service he renders. What-
 ever they are willing to pay is the just and proper wage
 for him to receive. That is the only system which enables
 each worker to receive all he can fairly earn. It rewards
 the exceptional man in proportion to his production and
 it rewards the thrifty, hardworking man in proportion to
 the effort he puts forth. It enables all men to work hard
 or take life easier while being justly paid for what they
 contribute to the common weal.
 Under this system men cooperate freely to satisfy
 each other's needs and wants. Manpower is channeled
 into the making of such goods and the rendering of such
 services as are most in demand and most desired by the
 people. This adds to the well-being of all. Under this
 system, men develop their self-reliance, remain inde-
 pendent and learn to cooperate voluntarily with one an-
 other to the mutual benefit of all concerned. They depend
 upon themselves and not upon government. There is less
 temptation to covet and little opportunity to profit
 thereby. They quickly learn to devote their energies to
 producing more wealth rather than concocting schemes
 to get some of the wealth produced by others.
 There are two choices before the American people.
 We may return to the free market economy or go deeper
 and deeper into socialism leading eventually to totali-

 Who Will Rescue the Colonies?
 LAWRENCE SULLIVAN, Coordinator of Information, U. S. House of Representatives
 HO WILL finance the newly independent na-
 tions now springing to life throughout Asia and
 Africa?
 Nineteenth Century colonialism is dead and gone, yet
 news dispatches from the Congo recount the emergence
 of primitive savagery over large areas which had been
 moving prudently toward civilization for almost a
 century.
 During 1960, no less than 14 new African states
 carrying a combined population of 80 millions, will as-
 sume their place in the United Nations as self-governing
 independent nations. But nowhere in that stricken area
 is there a cultural foundation adequate to support law
 and order, the historical cornerstones of freedom under
 law.
 The Communist campaign of defamation and hatred
 against Western colonial administration has been un-
 relenting for 42 years.
 After 1918 colony suddenly became a bad word over
 vast reaches of the earth-a term of opprobrium and irra-
 tional hatred. Colonialism became it slogan of fanatical
 violence against British, American, Dutch, German,
 Portuguese, and Japanese development enterprises the
 world around.
 Vast areas of the world achieved a chimerical inde-
 pendence; and more than 800,000,000 people who long
 had been independent and sovereign in their own lands
 passed into Communist slavery-all because they took up
 Moscow's angry cry against colonialism.
 The world around today, statesmen and scholars are
 searching for a new evaluation of colonial history since
 the Industrial Revolution. The classical Marxian doc-
 trine no longer holds water. For contemporary history
 has demonstrated clearly that primitive areas and un-
 developed societies still are dependent upon the larger,
 stronger, and more mature nations for capital assistance
 in their national development.
 Viewed in historical perspective, the Leninist rage
 against colonialism has plunged millions of progressive
 colonials into abysmal economic dislocations, while at
 the same time throwing hundreds of millions of once free
 peoples into the hopeless snakepit of Communist slavery.
 So the basic problems of colonial relationships still
 demand solution.
 A starting point well might be the historical fact that
 the Communist war on colonialism thus far has served
 communism far better than it has served the aspirations
 of freedom. In short, the world gulped down the Com-
 munist slogans against colonies, only to realize after Yalta
 in 1945, that colonies still are dependent economically,
 whatever their political status.
 Capital has a real function in national development,
 and we do not escape the underlying economic realities
 of colonial relations merely by parroting the Kremlin
 slogans of hate and vituperation against investor nations.
 The tragedy of Africa today is the whole ripe fruit
 of the Leninist doctrine of poisonous hatred. India, with
 some $8 billion of United States' aid already devoured
 in twelve years of independence, wobbles precariously on
 the brink of communism. Indonesia, after fifteen years
 of paper independence, still is a political and economic
 quagmire. By destroying old colonial ties with Europe,
 Kremlin policy now has given communism a firm toe-
 hold in all of Indonesia. If this cycle runs its historic
 course, the people of Indonesia simply will have traded
 Dutch colonialism for Communist slavery. Who won on
 that deal?
 A fanatical will to theoretical independence appar-
 ently is not enough to sustain a new nation in the Twen-
 tieth Century. Several of the new nations of the Twentieth
 Century, as it now turns out, simply flopped out of the
 frying pan into the fire-trading British, French, German,
 Dutch, Italian, or Japanese colonial assistance for a lesser
 amount of semantic assistance from Moscow. In this
 process, several weaker nations have lost their identity,

 A ttention!
 ABOUT TWO months ago we received
 through the mails an anonymous commu-
 nication. Later we received letters from a num-
 ber of our readers inquiring about it. Apparently
 the same stencil used by the firm mailing Chris-
 tian Economics for us was used for mailing this
 document. To each inquirer we have replied that
 we do not know who wrote the message or who
 mailed it and that we have no knowledge of or
 connection with the matter. In keeping with our
 custom concerning anonymous communications
 this one was promptly discarded. We want our
 readers to know that we never take part in such
 operations.
 The Editors
 Expanding Usefulness ... From a recent test mailing to 11,311 ministers in
 Georgia, Kansas, Oregon and New Hampshire 1,961 replies were received. These
 were tabulated and certified by John H. Koch and Company, certified public
 accountants, and are summarized as follows:
 - All but 43 receive CHRISTIAN ECO-
 NOMICS.
 - The number reading it regularly is 38.7
 per cent; occasionally 46.1 per cent.
 - Nearly one-quarter-23.1 per cent-find it
 very useful; 46.5 per cent fairly useful; 24.6
 per cent not useful; and 5.8 per cent did not
 reply to this question.
 - A surprising number - 43 per cent - de-
 clared they were in general agreement with
 the views expressed in CHRISTIAN ECO-
 NOMICS; 31.7 per cent reported that they
 agreed about half of the time; 15.2 per cent
 disagreed; while 10.1 per cent did not reply
 to this question.
 - Thus, the freedom philosophy as ex-
 pounded in CHRISTIAN ECONOMICS
 finds increasing acceptance.

 tarian government and the loss of our freedom. We are
 headed in this latter direction and we are increasing our
 pace from a walk to a trot. Soon it will be a gallop. No
 wonder Khrushchev talks about peace. Why would he
 fight when we are hastening pell-mell toward his Marxian
 ideals?
 Our Fatal Delusion
 THE RECENT COMMUNIST conference in Bucha-
 rest, Rumania, frankly acknowledged "the possibility
 of the working class gaining a victory for the Socialist
 revolution by non-peaceful means." This highlights the
 fact that Khrushchev's oft reiterated demand for "peace-
 ful coexistence" is a mere tactic by which he hopes to gain
 advantage over the West by allaying our fears and reduc-
 ing our will to resist.
 The greatest obstacle to our winning of the cold war
 is the failure to recognize that the Communists are play.
 ing for keeps. All their manepvering, pleas for coexist-
 ence, summit conferences, disarmament agreements and
 all the rest are merely the tactics they employ in their
 effort to destroy us.
 Until the American people come to a clear realiza-
 tion that their only hope of survival as a free people is to
 win the cold war we shall continue to lose ground. Every
 subject of discussion between the Communists and our-
 selves relates to some compromise by which we give up
 something. The guiding principle of the Communists.is
 to give up nothing and take as much as they can. We,
 apparently, are still guided by the thought that by giving
 up something or making some compromise we can win
 peace. That is a fundamental error which has dominated
 Western policy. We are insulted, demeaned, abused, im-
 posed upon, our property seized and our citizens held in
 prison camps; yet we do no more than make a pious pro-
 test and consider some further concession in the hope
 that the enemy will then be satisfied and willing to live
 in peace with us.
 No one can win every defensive action; therefore,
 defensive strategy leads eventually to defeat. If we do
 not win the cold war, we shall lose our independent ex-
 istence. An aggressive enemy proceeds against us on all
 fronts until he encounters solid resistance. Then, he stops.
 Out comes the glad hand and he speaks of peace and
 friendship. When we relax in the hope that stability has
 at last been achieved the enemy again becomes aggressive
 and advances as far as our soft appeasement policy will
 allow. When he encounters resistance he again stops and
 proclaims his peaceful intentions until we are lulled to
 sleep and he feels he can impose further aggression upon
 us before we are once more aroused to the point of
 resistance.
 This step by step process has gone on in many ways
 and on many fronts. It has cost us much treasure, millions
 of lives and vast territories in Eastern Europe, Asia,
 Africa and even in the Western hemisphere. We have but
 to continue the same policy a little longer and the curtain
 will be rung down on Western civilization, ushering in
 another long period of tyranny, cruelty and suffering.
 But this need not be-we are far stronger than we
 think and the enemy is far weaker than we think. If we
 would once face up to the fact that freedom and righteous-
 ness, independence and national honor are more impor-
 tant than peace, we would preserve both. By vacillation,
 weakness, irresolution, appeasement and compromise we
 shall never attain peace but only ready ourselves for
 the kill.
 The Dangerous Spiral
 AMERICAN MARKETS are being flooded with a
 wide variety of merchandise from abroad. Domes-
 tic producers are being undersold by foreign competitors
 in many lines in which we have heretofore excelled. Some
 of these are shoes, clothing, automobiles, typewriters,
 sewing machines, cameras, business machines, cement,
 machine tools, brass sheets and tubing, oil pipe, barbed
 wire, and steel.
 The basic reason for this is the wage-price spiral
 which, in many cases, has more than offset the gains from
 increasing efficiency.
 A further rise in wages and prices will bring a new
 flood of goods from Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and
 other countries. This, of course, will bring unemployment
 upon us.
 It will also bring pressure for higher tariffs which will
 in turn reduce our export markets and cause further un-
 employment. This result might be avoided temporarily
 by devaluation of the dollar or more inflation, but this
 would increase rather than diminish our troubles. We
 cannot continue to price ourselves out of the market and
 remain prosperous.
 The only answer is to refrain from further wage and
 price increases except;thtvse that can be, justified by in-,
 creased man-hour output. Even this will not suffice to
 rescue us from our precarious position but we must have,
 in addition, less footdragging, less featherbedding, less
 wastefulness and more cooperation all around to retain
 our competitive position in the world.
 It does not help to remind ourselves that we have
 brought this situation upon ourselves by the flood of dol-
 lars we have sent abroad to equip many foreign producers
 with more modern machines than many of our own man-
 ufacturers are using. We have done that. We cannot undo
 it and we will have to meet the competition which we
 have financed. We must stop waste and work harder than
 we have ever worked before.
 A concomitant of this situation is our growing dollar
 obligations to foreigners. These now exceed $19 billion,
 a sum approximately equal to our gold reserves. In the
 event of some crisis, a run on our dollars by foreign indi-
 viduals and governments seeking to withdraw their bal-
 ances, would be most embarrassing.
 The situation can be met by increasing our exports
 and decreasing our imports but we cannot do either un-
 less the wage-price spiral is stabilized. Two other proce-
 dures, cutting foreign aid and restricting American travel
 abroad would swing the pendulum in the right direction
 but large numbers of our people regard foreign aid, both
 economic and military, as essential and many Americans
 would consider it a great hardship to be restricted in their
 foreign travel. Nevertheless, this problem must be solved
 if we are to retain our commercial standing, our high
 standard of living and our ability to be helpful to the
 people of other countries. We believe the solution lies in
 some workable combination of the above suggestions.
 Refugee Year
 REFUGEE YEAR PASSED into history but the prob-
 lem remains. Over 21 years ago the Editor witnessed
 the first great movement of refugees in modern times
 when half a million Spaniards crossed from Spain into
 southern France. They filled the roadways and darkened
 the fields and hills as they trudged along the countryside.
 Six months later, half a million Frenchmen living near
 the German border to the eastward were evacuated to
 the southern and western part of France-a second layer
 of suffering superimposed on the first one already there.
 After another short interval, in the spring of 1940,
 when the Germans invaded the Low Countries and north-
 ern France, we witnessed the great southward rush of five
 million Belgian and French refugees. It seemed that the
 whole country was on the move. One might see a family
 group camped under a tree or in an orchard with an ill
 member who could not go farther. Or another group so
 exhausted from lack of food that they could not continue.
 This vast stream of humanity crowded all the trains,
 filled the buses, overflowed the automobiles and oxcarts
 while the greater number, heavily burdened with their
 belongings, staggered through the fields in order to avoid
 the clogged roadways. Generous French peasants shared
 with them, often to the last reserves in their households.
 We saw many of the nearly half a million Finns who
 left the part of their country annexed by Russia and went
 to live in other parts of Finland. They had the choice of
 retaining their homes and property and becoming Rus-
 sian citizens or leaving with only such belongings as they
 could carry in their hands. Eighteen Finns chose to be-
 come Russian citizens and all the others left with nothing.
 One of the most cruel movements of people was the
 Communist depopulation of the Baltic countries Estonia,
 Latvia and Lithuania. Large numbers of these fine people
 were sent into slavery in Siberia.
 Later the Sudeten Germans were ousted and at the
 close of the war some 12 million Poles and East Germans
 trudged westward through bitter cold and often with very
 little food.
 Nearly one.. million Arabs were driven-out or fright-
 ened out of their ancestral homes in Palestine when the
 nation of Israel was founded. Millions of North Koreans
 sought refuge in South Korea as did millions of North
 Vietnamese in the southern part of that country. Other
 millions were exchanged between India and Pakistan
 when one country became two in that unhappy land.
 Authoritarian governments exercise the power of
 throwing vast numbers of helpless human beings about
 as if they were less than cattle. None of these people chose
 to leave their homes and endure unspeakable hardship
 but it was the will of their masters, the tyrants who gained
 control over them, that forced them into their bitter fate.
 People are pretty decent wherever you find them - all
 races, religions and nationalities-but the evil wrought by
 their rulers who gain power over them through the organ-
 ization of government is despicable beyond portrayal in
 words. It has resulted in death for many millions, freezing
 and starvation for tens of millions, separation of families,
 loss of loved ones, breaking of human ties and indescrib-
 able misery for vast numbers of human beings.
 Every man of decency and goodwill will pray and
 work and, if need be, fight to stop the inhuman system of

 toward stopping the system of tyrannous government
 which caused their suffering.
 The Biggest Shovel  THE REV. PHILIP JEROME CLEVELAND, [.e Raysr?ille, Pena.,Yhania
 S OME TIME ago I faced the real prob-
 lem of how to serve six churches and
 on a salary of forty dollars a week.
 Three teen-aged youngsters interested
 me in a crumbling white shrine forty miles
 away in the woodlands of eastern Con-
 necticut. This engagement led to another
 and another until I had developed a circuit
 of preaching appointments.
 Was it not a gamble of faith to take
 over the care and nurture of six rural sanc-
 tuaries without appreciable salary? Some
 friends thought I was losing my mind.
 "I will put God in my debt," I said to
 myself.
 As I commenced to work with these di-
 lapidated churches, friends started to ar-
 rive from here, there and everywhere. A
 steeplejack volunteered to repair the bel-
 fry of the main shrine. Folks offered to do
 the work of janitor in various churches;
 neighbors donated Bibles. hymnals, fuel.
 Money came in for paint and clapboards.
 Romance and wonder really entered
 into the bright adventure.
 Day after day I started the car and went
 forth on humble missions in an endeavor
 to recommission for service some old ships
 of Zion, in scorn of consequences. And,
 to and behold, my meagre funds failed to
 run out; rather, ran in, and kept on run-
 ning in.
 It seemed as though Someone was put-
 ting me in His debt. My personal affairs
 flourished, magazine sales, weddings,
 christenings.  Even  a  great  Japanese
 preacher came from Tokyo to aid me with
 my New England parishes. And I com-
 menced to have the time of my life!
 "I cannot put God in my debt!"
 These words thundered at me as new
 doors of opportunity opened and honors
 and blessings came to my central sanctuary
 in Canterbury, Connecticut-the Church
 of the Broken Bell. That forty dollar sum
 unwound as by a fairy wand into another
 forty and on and on.
 My steeplejack said to me one day as
 new work commenced to pile up on him:
 "What's this all about? While I do
 Another's work Another takes over my

 affairs and I can't fill the engagements!"
 A sweet, mild, aged lady in the church,
 a grandmother wrestling with the prob-
 lems of two exhausting grandchildren,
 caught the urge to help me recommission
 these old ships of Zion. She began to place
 dollar bills in every faded collection plate
 or basket passed her way.
 "My dollars go farther at home," she
 was admitting shortly. "We don't need
 the doctor. I seem to get better bargains
 at the stores. The dollars are holding out
 magically!"
 Then, one memorable day, I knew the
 secret. I learned about a man in Philadel-
 phia-Captain Levy.

 THE SERMONETTE-The Spirit of Man
 "The spirit of a man will sustain his
 infirmity; but a wounded spirit who
 can bear?" (Prov. 18:14)
 ONE MAY lose his eyes, his hearing or
 his voice, or all three, and still be use-
 ful and successful. One may lose his hands,
 his feet, or both, and still do useful work
 and be a credit to his family and his
 country. One may lose his health and suf-
 fer all his life and still be a great musician,
 a poet, an artist or a statesman.
 No one has ever written sweeter music
 than Beethoven who could not hear. No
 one perceived more clearly the beauties of
 nature than Milton who could not see.
 Blind men have achieved fame as lawyers,
 Senators, educators and ministers. One can
 overcome almost any handicap if he re-
 tains his spirit. If his spirit falters, even
 though he may have a strong and perfect
 body, he will accomplish nothing.
 That which strengthens, emboldens and
 ennobles the spirit of man, improves so-
 ciety and carries the world forward toward
 its goal of better, finer and more righteous
 living.
 Poverty is no disgrace and scarcely a
 handicap to the courageous of spirit. If
 men develop their self-reliance by meeting
 and solving the problems that present
 themselves, they achieve great strength,
 integrity and force of character. They dem-
 onstrate the fact that they were created in
 the image of God. They achieve the po-
 tential given them by the Creator.
 On the other hand, when men become
 accustomed to living from subsidies, boun-
 ties, long-continued charity or any means
 of sustaining themselves by the effort of
 others, they lose confidence, integrity,
 courage, initiative and independence. The
 soul grows smaller and the spirit withers
 as one seeks more and more to cast the
 burden of his life upon his neighbors, the
 taxpayers. Herein lies the soul-destroying
 evil inherent in any type of collectivism,
 call it socialism, fascism, communism or
 welfare statism.
 All of these ideologies teach men that
 they are not captains of their own souls,
 that they are not custodians of their own
 weal or woe but that they are meant to be
 groveling creatures forever pleading with
 Who Will Rescue the Colonies?    (Continued from page 1)
 perhaps forever; and several others totter precariously
 today on the brink of total absorption by communism.
 One of these latter, Cuba, is actively inviting Communist
 intervention, while vehemently cursing sixty years of
 U. S. cooperation and sympathetic cultural assistance.
 Moscow today is the seat of the most oppressive and
 degrading colonial empire in all human history. Com-
 munist imperialism is plundering and debilitating in a
 measure which no power in the West would have toler-
 ated for thirty days in its pre-war colonial relations. Over
 a span of forty years, Western colonialism has been
 damned systematically to everlasting shame, only to be
 replaced, in many instances, by a far more degrading
 and humiliating system of Communist colonialism, now
 styled "Peoples' Democracy."
 The day is not far distant when the stronger nations,
 probably united in the effort, will be compelled to rescue
 hundreds-of-millions of people from starvation and
 chaos. The insistent pressures of the world's population
 ,explosion today compel leaders of all races to dig deep
 below the surface of revolutionary semantics for an hon-
 est reappraisal of Nineteenth Century colonialism.
 The'Lenin-School of Tactics In Moscow is the foun-
 tainhead of the Twentieth Century's insensate rage
 against colonialism. The curriculum of the Lenin Insti-
 tute, as of 1944, when Russia was our esteemed ally,
 carried these study directives:
 "(1) Imperialism is interpreted to suit the stra-
 tegical purpose of organizing rebellion in the
 colonies against England, France, Japan, and to
 subvert Latin America against the United States.
 "(2) Theory of independence of small nations
 is strategically utilized to create as much division
 as possible in non-Russian Europe and elsewhere.
 "(3) Theory of inevitable decay and collapse
 of empires to create faith in the sure victories of
 national independence movements under Russian
 inspiration, and attract them within the orbit of
 Russian politics.... Dismemberment and exhaus-
 tion of empires aimed at without regard to conse-
 quences to populations involved."
 Such has been the central purpose of the Lenin Insti-
 tute since 1920 - world-wide, unrelenting propaganda
 warfare against all colonial relations.
 Forty years of this Communist-directed independence
 movement has not given a single colony genuine inde-
 pendence. Each is still a dependent nation, several of
 them tottering on the very brink of total communism.
 And the Lenin Institute, now called Moscow's Academy
 The Biggest Shovel
 He possessed a little money and was
 continually doing good with his modest
 income. He was always giving money
 away and yet he always had a little. How
 was that?
 A friend asked him to reveal how he
 could be donating to charities, month to
 month, and yet he always had something
 for the next month.
 The shrewd, aging captain grinned,
 winked an eye and replied:
 "Well, you see, it's this way. As I shovel
 out, the Lord shovels in, and the Lord's
 got the biggest shovel !"
 of World Revolution, still trains 5,000 students a year
 from Asia, Africa, and Latin American nations in the
 tactics of colonial dismemberment. In this student body,
 approximately 1400 are native African Communists;
 1200 are from Arab countries of the Middle East; 230
 are from Latin America, and the rest from China, Japan,
 Korea, and Southeast Asia. These are the hard-core Com-
 munist leaders of the anti-colonial crusade the world
 around as of 1962, and beyond.
 All this incorrigible fury against colonialism, so ex-
 pertly organized and manipulated since 1918, is distrib-
 uted worldwide through formal Communist Party affili-
 ates of the Kremlin in sixty-two different countries-18
 in Europe; 20 in Latin America; 10 in Southeast Asia; 10
 in Africa and the Middle East; and 1 each in Canada,
 the U.S.A., Australia, and New Zealand. The sun never
 sets on Moscow's belching hell-fire for independence.
 In the Lenin theory each newly independent nation
 is a lively prospect for early economic exhaustion, and
 then rescue by Russia, to be incorporated in the new
 complex of Communist imperialism as a full-fledged sat-
 ellite. Such are the real motivations of Moscow's bleeding-
 heart?freedom campaign-for the colonies. -- - , -
 In every age of history there have been contemporary
 nations at different levels of national development. Be-
 fore communism began to call the tune in the 1920's, the
 strong nations assisted the weak; and the weak gradually
 became stronger-and eventually free.
 Today, that entire concept of history has been blacked
 out by a world smog of hateful propaganda against co-
 lonialism. True, the inspirations of freedom are real, and
 they are rooted deep in human instinct. Freedom can,
 and does, accomplish miracles.
 But human society does not advance sure-footedly
 only on slogans of hatred and humiliation against older
 and more deeply rooted cultures. There are still many
 things primitive nations might learn from the cultural
 centers of civilization. Individuals grow strong in youth
 under the wise tutelage of their elders. Young nations
 likewise grow in strength and wisdom under the guidance
 of experience and superior strength. Nations, like chil-
 dren, must crawl before they walk, and must walk before
 they run.
 In our search for human advance, let us look dispas-
 sionately at the true history of Western Colonialism. Too
 much of the world's sorry history during the last half-
 century has turned upon the distorted concept of colonial-
 ism drawn by the Marxian hatemongers of the Kremlin.
 Hatred never can knit the political and social fabrics
 of human progress.
 This Is the Challenge . .
 A UNIQUE venture in public service in
 the interest of national welfare was
 launched by The Champion Paper and
 Fibre Company of Hamilton, Ohio, when
 it brought out a publication entitled,
 VIEW 1-The War We Are In, which is
 the first in a series devoted to views of
 subjects that are basic to our times.
 The theme of the text stems from the
 doctrine of protracted war as spelled out
 by Mao Tse-Tung in a series of lectures
 delivered in 1938 when he was hailed as
 a simple "agrarian reformer" in spite of
 his words which showed him to be a mas-
 ter military strategist and ruthless dictator.
 There is a "crossroad of divergence in
 stronger men who exercise the authority
 of government for bigger and better hand-
 outs of ever increasing variety.
 Such men may have strong, healthy
 bodies but, having lost their spirit, the
 image of God dies within them and they
 become leaners and not lifters. They be-
 come a part of the problem and not a part
 of the answer.
 That which ministers to the courage,
 bravery and independence of man is from
 God and that which teaches him to obtain
 as much as possible of his living from the
 labor of others is from Satan.
 Robbing Peter to pay Paul is an ideol-
 ogy developed by the prince of the pow-
 ers of darkness for destroying the souls
 of men.
 Reality of a Moral Law
 MERE CHRISTIANITY. By C. S. Lewis. The Macmil-
 lan Company. 1960. 175 pp. Paper, $1.25.
 THIS September, Macmillan is bringing out a paper-
 back edition of a popular book which has been on the
 market for several years. This book, Mere Christianity,
 is a defense of orthodox Christianity and it brings apolo-
 getics down to the man in the street in the form of friendly
 conversations. It is never dull or stilted.
 The author, C. S. Lewis, is an orthodox Anglican. He
 begins his argument by establishing the reality of a Moral
 Law which is a good place to begin. The drift toward
 socialism in the West has at least one root in the denial
 of a Moral Law.
 Lewis concludes with a defense of the Trinity which
 is a good climax because the political issue now facing
 the West is bound up with what man believes about the
 nature of the universe. Furthermore, there is a clear se-
 quence from loss of faith in Christ to loss of faith in the
 doctrine of the Trinity to loss of faith in God to loss of
 faith in moral values and to the revolution of nihilism.
 So has run the sad story of the West in the last half
 century.
 It-i& to be hoped-that the paperback edition of Mere
 Christianity will result in a much wider circulation of
 this persuasive book.               Rev. 1. E. Howard
 Urgent Reading
 DARE WE RECOGNIZE RED CHINA? By Dick Hil-
 lis. Zondervan Publishing House, Grand Rapids, Michi-
 gan. 32 pp. 35?.
 WITH A sense of urgency and complete dedication,
 Dick Hillis, Christian missionary in China who was
 captured by the Communists, tells why the United States
 should not recognize Communist China and should con-
 tinue to oppose her admission to U.N. This dedicated,
 Christian voice carries the authority of long experience
 and should be heard by every Christian who would do
 his duty in this matter and by every citizen who has been
 deceived by the false dream of a workable partnership
 with Communist China in particular and communism in
 general.                                Howard E. Kershner
 I take it that it is best for all to leave each man free to
 acquire property as fast as he can. Some will get
 wealthy. I don't believe in a law to prevent a man
 from getting rich; it would do more harm than
 good.                              Abraham Lincoln
 describing the war we are in," says the
 editor of the volume. "Taken along one
 path, it is a struggle of economic theory,
 with the Sino-Soviet Empire representing
 economic collectivism and with the West
 representing varying versions of economic
 individualism. Taken along the other path,
 it is an armed struggle in which economic
 theory is merely a tactical skirmish while
 territorial conquest, raw-power domina-
 tion of the world is the grand, guiding
 strategy.
 "View I is of the latter path. It treats of
 communism as not a way to organize so-
 ciety but a way to organize conflict-total
 protracted conflict. It suggests that the
 gaps between Communist theory and
 Communist reality lead to this path."
 In design, artwork, typography and pho-
 tography this publication is a masterpiece
 of mechanical production that alone com-
 mands attention. In text and editorial con-
 struction it is also a masterpiece that car-
 ries the reader along with consuming
 interest.
 For merely the mechanical cost of pro-
 duction, 55c' apiece, plus shipping or
 mailing charges, your copy or copies may
 be obtained from The Champion Paper
 and Fibre Company, Hamilton, Ohio.
