 Communist China:  Who's Runnin   the Show?
 Introduction
 The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,
 which erupted in the spring of 1966, has had a pro-
 found impact on the shape and effectiveness of the
 nation's leadership hierarchies.   Even though a
 process of restoring some semblance of "normalcy"
 to China's post-revolutionary power structure has
 been under way for more than two years, it is still
 too soon to definitively answer the question of
 "who's running the show?" at the national level.
 Indeed, there is still a serious problem even in
 assessing the shape and perhaps the function of
 Communist China's ruling body, the politburo of the
 Communist Party.   The new body--formed at the ninth
 party congress in April 1969--is a peculiar creation
 compared with the previous one.   Prior to the Cul-
 tural Revolution, the politburo consisted of party
 chairman Mao Tse-tung and a number of top regime

 officials, each of whom had a special constituency
 that he monitored on behalf of the party.   Thus, one
 man's primary duty was agriculture; one concerned
 himself with economic affairs; one with foreign af-
 fairs;  another with party business; yet another with
 military matters and so forth.  The new politburo
 does not appear to be constructed along such lines.
 Below the top triumvirate of Mao, his heir-designate
 Defense Minister Lin Piao, and Premier Chou En-lai,
 who wears many hats both domestic and foreign, only
 economic specialist Li Hsien-nien has a clearly iden-
 tifiable constituency.   For the remainder, there is
 no sharp breakdown of responsibilities and even the
 army leaders on the politburo must now be presumed to
 be heavily involved in affairs outside the strictly
 military purview.   About all that can safely be said
 about the politburo is that most, although by no means
 all, probably participate in setting the broad out-
 line of policy direction.
 In any case, the politburo itself represents
 only the tip of a large iceberg and the implementa-
 tion of the policies which it helps formulate rests
 in the hands of a still emerging and as yet little

 known bureaucracy of second and third echelon leaders.
 This memorandum is an attempt to identify these sec-
 ondary officials and describe how they fit into the
 central ruling hierarchy.   Unfortunately, there are
 still many gaps in our knowledge about the structure
 of China's internal governing mechanism.   The Cultural
 Revolution not only resulted in a sweeping purge of
 Mao's principal opponents within the top leadership
 but also raised havoc throughout the old party and
 government organizational structure.   Although the
 process of putting together the pieces of this appa-
 ratus has been under way since at least the ninth party
 congress in April 1969, it has been slow,  in part be-
 cause both the party and government bureaucracies are
 not only being restructured but also streamlined and
 in part, because many key personnel appointments ap-
 parently have been bones of contention in Peking.
 One of the primary objectives of the Cultural
 Revolution was to bring in new blood into the ruling
 hierarchy.   In this task, the regime was eminently
 successful

 Hopefully, a more definitive assessment
 0
 of at least the central government hierarchy will be
 possible after the regime holds its Fourth National
 Peoples Congress which, among other things, is ex-
 pected to serve as a forum for presenting the full
 slate of post-Cultural Revolution ministerial ap-
 pointments.   There have been reports that Peking in-
 tends to hold this congress sometime this year but
 it is unlikely to take place until some of the polit-
 ical maneuvering currently under way within the ruling
 politburo subsides.
 In examining the state of the nation's leader-
 ship to date, this paper will focus on the three ma-
 jor vertical hierarchies in Peking, the central gov-
 ernment, the party, and the military.   These sections
 will attempt not only to provide a comprehensive
 listing of known officials but will also point out,
 where possible, the division of labor within these
 vertical hierarchies as well as how they relate to
 one another.   The fourth section will examine in

 wives of the major party and government leaders.

 SECTION I:   THE CENTRALG'OVE'RNMENT
 The primary target of the cultural Revolution
 was the Chinese Communist Party  (CCP)  apparatus but,
 because the party and government hierarchies formed
 interlocking directorates with many veteran party
 leaders concurrently holding top government posts,
 it was inevitable that the purge would spill over
 into the central government.   Premier Chou En-lai
 put up a spirited defense for many of his subordinates
 and, indeed, he was successful in saving more than a
 few from total political eclipse.   Even so, well over
 half of his government ministers lost their positions
 within the first few months of Red Guard terror.
 From the wreckage of the Cultural Revolution
 the regime is trying to erect a new, streamlined
 bureaucracy--a move specifically directed by Mao Tse-
 tung on the grounds that the pre-Cultural Revolu-
 tion structure had become an entrenched elite operating
 through a chain of command which was unresponsive to
 the "revolutionary masses" and which was in practice
 modifying Mao's programs and operating largely outside

 his personal control.  Nevertheless, the process is
 not merely intended to satisy Mao's anti-bureaucratic
 bias but also is apparently designed to achieve a
 more clear-cut division of labor between local and
 national levels in which more responsibility for day-
 to-day affairs  (education, health, production for
 local use, etc.) devolves upon the lower levels.   The
 number of ministries, according to Chou En-lai, is
 being reduced by half and many cadres have been sent
 off for labor "re-education" either permanently or on
 rotation.  Numerous unidentified new faces are now
 appearing in lists of departments under the State
 Council.   Some pre-Cultural Revolution officials have
 managed to hang on to their old or similar slots,
 however, and during the past few months a number of
 long absent veteran officials have again appeared.
 There are two major features about the staffing
 of the central state bureaucracy that are immediately
 apparent.   The first is the unusually heavy representa-
 tion of the military.   In many ministries control pre-
 sumably is still in the hands of the military control
 committees that assumed supervision during the Cultural
 Revolution and four of the six new ministers that

 have been named thus far are military careerists.
 These are men in their forties and early fifties who,
 under the old system, would have had to wait ten to
 15 years to acquire comparable positions of authority
 within the top-heavy military bureaucracy.   Judging
 from what has been observed about the new Minister
 of Foreign Trade, for example, these new soldier-
 administrators are intelligent, capable, and articulate
 although they almost certainly have to rely on their
 largely civilian vice ministers for technical ex-
 pertise.
 Although it seems safe to assume that not a
 single government unit will be free of some form of
 military influence, it is also interesting to note
 the return of many veteran cadre to their former
 places of work.   Some are being identified by their
 former titles; others have shifted from one ministry
 to another as part of the government reorganization;
 and still others are listed only as "responsibile
 persons" of various unidentified departments.   Their
 return to duty is ample testimony to Peking's
 recognition that it cannot cavalierly drain the rela-
 tively small reservoir of civilian managerial and

 considerable mellowing in the regime's political

 struggle against the "bureaucrats" and forcibly remove
 them from office.

 Premier
 Chou En-lai                Chou appears to be "running
 the country"; at one time he
 was assisted by 15 vice premiers.
 Li Hsien-nien                Li, longtime Minister of
 Finance, is currently the
 only working vice premier;
 like Chou, he is extremely
 active; his basic field is
 finance and trade but he is
 undoubtedly now performing
 a much more general economic
 and planning role.

 Li Fu-chun                 Once China's top economic
 specialist, Li appears only
 irregularly now and he may
 be in poor health.   His influ-
 ence is felt primarily through
 the State Planning Commission
 with which he may still be
 associated.
 Hsieh Fu-chih               Hsieh, who is also boss of
 Peking city and minister of
 public security, had been
 out of sight for nearly 15
 months when he reappeared
 in June 1971.   At that time
 he was reidentified as vice
 premier but it is not clear
 if he still retains the pub-
 lic security portfolio.

 (There is evidence that the SPC is playing the major
 role in directing China's economic recovery following
 the Cultural Revolution.   At least three former min-

 ministries--have been absorbed by the SPC, thus greatly
 expanding its overall planning capabilities.   The
 State Economic Commission  (SEC), on the other hand,
 appears to have been abolished.   Before the Cultural

 the SEC supervised short-term production plans.   Evi-

 however, the only person that has been consistently

 is reported to head up the military control committee
 assigned to the SPC.   Su's military background is
 obscure but he may have served with the General Staff
 Department of the PLA.

 The existence of this commission was first made
 public in 1966.   It may be responsible for the overall
 direction of China's advanced weapons program.   The
 civilian aspect of China's R&D program appear now to
 be controlled by the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
 which reportedly has absorbed the former State Sci-
 entific and Technological Commission.
 No officials have been identified with this com-

 mentions it.   Nevertheless, it stands to reason that
 the NDSTC or some successor organization must be super-

 During the Cultural Revolution normal judicial
 proceedings were suspended and most serious cases were
 handled by military tribunals.   According to the new
 draft state constitution, the stipulation that the
 People's Court be "independent, subject only to the

 has moved toward resuming a more normal diplomatic role
 in the world community.           Frequently the titles of these
 organizations are virtually the same as their pre-
 Cultural Revolution counterparts and, more often than
 not, the same people are staffing them.   However,
 these persons are largely functionaries, the meeters-

 must proceed more substantive discussions.   They,
 therefore, fall outside the scope of this inquiry.

 SECTION II.   THE PARTY HIERARCHY
 0
 0
 The apex of any Communist party system is the
 politburo.  Usually membership on the politburo is
 kept rather limited, and the Chinese politburo is no
 exception.  However, beneath the politburo there
 exists a large central bureaucracy of departments,
 units, and committees that are essentially struc-
 tured to mirror the government and society that the
 party controls. In Communist China, before the Cul-
 tural Revolution, the party's Secretariat served as
 the executive arm of the politburo.   It controlled
 the day-to-day activities of ten or so operational
 departments or units that, in turn, supervised almost
 every aspect of the party's function and duties.
 The leaders of the Cultural Revolution claim
 that Mao's opponents thwarted his will by seizing
 control of the party apparatus.   Its not surprising
 therefore, that the head of the Secretariat and the
 chiefs of each of the subordinate departments were
 among the first victims of the Cultural Revolution.

 To date, the Secretariat has not reappeared and there
 is no provision for it in the new party constitu-
 tion; about all that can be said is that responsibility
 for party reconstruction and organization now is prob-
 ably divided among a number of politburo members of
 whom Chou En-lai appears to be the key figure.   More-
 over, the regime is being very deliberate about the
 pace of reconstruction and it is presumably an area
 of considerable sensitivity in Peking.  Of the ten
 or so original departments and units, only two have
 been publicly identified as still in existence.   The
 International Liaison Department  (ILD), which is re-
 sponsible for relations with foreign Communist par-
 ties, has been particularly active in recent months,
 following the naming of Keng Piao, China's former
 ambassador to Albania, as the new director.   The ILD
 is roughly the party equivalent of the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs and its relatively rapid re-emergence
 can be likened to that of the Foreign Ministry within
 the central ministries.
 For the most part, however, the regime is being
 extremely secretive about who holds what top party
 jobs.   For example, not one member of the politburo
 has been identified in a specific party post, even

 appearing in the party listings
 though it is presumed that there is some kind of di-
 vision of labor among the active politburo members.
 Moreover, analysis of the lists of central party and
 government figures that attend the major rallies in
 Peking clearly reveals that the central party hier-
 archy is as big and cumbersome as that of the central
 government ministries, despite Mao's efforts to
 streamline all levels of administrations.  Even so,
 the regime has steadfastly refused to identify those
 officials by their party position, except for a hand-
 ful associated with the previously mentioned ILD.
 Nevertheless, it is possible to make a few gen-
 eralizations about the staffing procedures for the
 party.   It is obvious, for example, that the military
 are well represented not only at the politburo level,
 but also at the working level within the central
 party hierarchy.   It is also evident that, when com-
 pared with the ministries, only a small number of
 party cadre have been reinstated in positions of
 authority.   Conversely, the large numbers of persons
 suggests that many more

 SECTION III:   THE MILITARY HIERARCHY
 Organizationally speaking, the Cultural Revolution
 did not seriously harm the central military structure.
 Perhaps the biggest casualty was the General Political
 Department, which dropped out of the news for about two
 years following the disastrous summer of 1967.   Evi-
 dently, the leaders of the GPD became directly impli-
 cated in the short-lived campaign to "drag out" the
 handful in the military establishment or the People's
 Liberation Army  (PLA), as it is known in China.
 Actually, there was a major purge of army person-
 nel at the center in late 1966 but it went largely
 unnoticed because of the rapid flow of events following
 the movement of the Cultural Revolution into the prov-
 inces in a major way in 1967.   Although estimates vary
 depending on how you define a military versus party
 leader, something in the order of about one-third of
 China's top military brass was removed at that time.
 There followed the purge of the GPD in mid-1967 and
 the mysterious Yang Cheng-wu affair in March 1968, in
 which three key military officers were sacked following
 an alleged plot to topple Mao.
 there were serious differences within
 China's military elite over a wide range of defense

 policies
 Given the close rela-

 it is obvious that the key decision making power rests
 with the prestigious Military Affairs Committee, a
 party organ under the central committee but probably
 directly responsive to the politburo and its standing
 committee headed by Mao and Lin.   The MAC probably
 sets the basic guidelines within which the military
 hierarchy operates.

 from what is known about
 its membership it is evident that both the younger,
 more professionally oriented officers as well as the
 old, senior marshals have a share in the decision-
 making process.
 The implementation of purely military policy,
 such as national defense planning, the conduct of
 troop movements, training,  logistics, etc., is probably
 handled by the General Staff Department under the
 overall supervision of the Minister of National De-
 fense, Lin Piao.   The head of the PLA General Staff
 Department, Huang Yung-sheng, is actually more akin
 to the western concept of the Chief of the General
 Staff.   There is no separate staff headquarters for

 leaders of the air force and navy as well as the
 logistics chief.   The only person who does not
 formally come under the chief of staff is the
 director of the General Political Department.   He
 probably answers directly to the MAC.
 The third major element within the military
 hierarchy is the so-called "administrative unit" of
 the MAC.   This is a special body that apparently was
 set up under the MAC to supervise the army's growing
 role in civil affairs as a result of the Cultural Rev-
 olution.
 The importance of this body can be seen in the
 high party ranking that was ultimately accorded its
 top leadership.   Five of its seven members were
 elevated to the politburo at the ninth party congress
 in 1969.   If the administrative unit is, in fact,
 the primary organ overseeing the army's performance
 of its many civil duties, then it is truly a powerful

 SECTION IV:   THE FOREIGN MINISTRY
 0
 In comparison with other party and governmental
 institutions in China,  the foreign ministry is clearly
 a special case. In the first place, because of its
 function in life, the foreign ministry simply gets
 much more exposure than other governmental units that
 are oriented primarily toward domestic matters.  More-
 over, as China has sought to resume more-or-less
 normal diplomatic contact since the ninth party con-
 gress in 1969,  it has necessarily had to move faster
 in restaffing its various geographic and functional
 departments.  As a result, much more is known about
 how the ministry operates than any other comparable
 unit.
 Most of the faces showing up in the ministry
 are familiar ones.   In nearly every case, positions
 in the key geographic departments are going to offi-
 cials with considerable field experience in their
 area of responsibility.   A similar trend toward
 professionalism has been evident in the men sent
 abroad by Peking since mid-1969 to replace the chiefs
 of missions who were recalled in early 1967 for Cul-
 tural Revolution "re-education".   As in the case with

 nearly every governmental unit, there are military
 representatives within the ministry--some of whom
 are ranked higher than vice foreign ministers--but
 none of them have been identified as yet with per-
 manent positions in the ministry.   In short, the
 professionals appear to control the actual operations
 of the ministry.
 Except for a brief period in 1967, the Foreign
 Ministry was spared much of the political upheaval
 that characterized so many other ministries.   In
 April of this year a successor was named to replace
 former Foreign Minister Chen I but Premier Chou En-
 tai still handles most of the major responsibilities
 of the job.   The new minister, ranking deputy minis-
 ter Chi Peng-fei, is only "acting", however, suggest-
 ing that the question of who will ultimately run the
 show is still being debated.

 SECTION V:   THE DISTAFF SIDE OF THE HOUSE

 The Cultural Revolution has witnessed the rise
 of the wives of the regime's two top leaders in
 Chiang Ching   (Madame Mao)  and Yeh Chun  (Madame Lin).
 The wives of certain Chinese officials have always
 held high party positions, such as Premier Chou En-
 lai's wife Teng Ying-chao, who has been a member of
 the party central committee for years, but Chiang
 Ching and Yeh Chun are the first to have been brought
 into the elite politburo.   Although neither one has
 been identified in a specific party or government
 post, Chiang Ching continues to be active in the
 field of cultural affairs and she may be given a
 formal position in this field,  such as the Ministry
 of Culture.
 The list that follows is by no means an exhaus-
 tive study but it does contain the names of those
 women who are currently making appearances at various
 meetings and diplomatic functions in Peking. F
