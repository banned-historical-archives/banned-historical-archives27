 1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF STUDY
 1.  There has long been a need for a survey analysis of the way the Communist Party
 organizes for military action. There are many places where the Party is already engaged in
 armed rebellion. Existing world tensions and unstable internal conditions may encourage re-
 bellion in other areas in the near future. Non-Communist governments may have to face such
 action directly: it is important to know how the action is begun and directed and to know
 something of the problems that the Communists themselves face in raising, maintaining and
 controlling an armed force.
 2.  For these reasons the present paper has been prepared. It deals with the Commu-
 nist armed insurrection in advanced capitalist countries and in "backward", agrarian
 ("colonial") countries. A section also has been included on Communist armed resistance to
 foreign military occupation. This is of interest for two reasons: (a) it supplements the infor-
 mation on military organization for Communist insurrection; and (b) it shows what might be
 expected to follow should non-Communist forces be obliged to occupy a foreign country in
 which the Communist following is significant.
 3.  The conclusions developed in the survey are tentative. In many cases there is not
 sufficient information to draw reliable conclusions: for obvious reasons the Communist Party
 does not publish details on the techniques and organization of its military effort. In the case
 of city insurrections in the manner of the Russian Revolution of November 1917, they have
 been unsuccessful; and failures are not generally recorded in objective detail by the Commu-
 nists. Much more information is available on the 'Communist revolution in colonial countries
 because they have occurred at a time of general public awareness and interest in Commu-
 nist activities, and because, by their very nature, they cannot be kept secret.
 4.  Such shortcomings aside, it is believed that the present paper will enable its
 readers to foresee more clearly what the Communists may be expected to do by way of pre-
 paring and carrying out armed action. The "pattern" of organization and action cannot, of
 course, be rigidly applied in every conceivable detail and there are many places where details
 have been set forth to cover the actual situation in a particular country. It is hoped, however,
 that alternative variations have been furnished that will suggest to the reader what he may ex-
 pect in a given place, time, and set of conditions. There are natural limits to the variations
 possible at any point in the pattern. The Communists are bound by conditions beyond their
 control: their doctrine prescribes adherence to certain standards of organization (Parties are
 modelled after the CPSU); they exchange experiences and thereby develop certain "school
 solutions."
 5.  Two limitations have been imposed on this interim study: (a) no attention is given
 to the organization of state armies in Communist countries; (b) military tactics are treated
 only so far as they affect organization. The study is focused on the military organizations of
 Parties not yet in power.
 6.  While this paper is primarily concerned with the efforts of the Communists to
 organize a military force of their own, a section is devoted to penetration and subversion of
 "enemy" armed services (i.e. the existing army, police force, etc. of the state). Penetration
 and subversion operations of Communist Parties, especially in the city insurrection, contri-
 bute directly and in a large proportion to their military potential. The organization for this
 activity is discussed in greater detail, paragraph 176.
 7.  Several "case histories" of particular Communist military actions are appended
 to the study. They should be referred to when illustrations are wanted on the application of a
 "principle" as set out in the three general analyses of --
 Organization for colonial revolution,
 Organization for armed resistance, and
 Organization for proletarian revolution.)
 1 Communist military operations in. conjunction with an invading Communist army have not
 been considered separately in this study. It is believed that in the event of invasion by the
 Soviet Union or its satellites, CP military action would fall into one of the categories dealt
 with in the paper. It would, perhaps, range from resistance type operations to isolated sei-
 zures of power in cities in the advanced countries. An example of such aid already exists in
 the colonial areas: the help of the South Korean guerrillas to the North Korean and Chinese

 8. These three types of Communist armed actions have characterized three histori-
 cal periods of Communist strategy. They are --
 a)  The period of unsuccessful city insurrections based on the Bolshevik model,
 roughly from 1917 to 1935, with a rash of attempts immediately following the
 Bolshevik Revolution, Insurrections were attempted in,Germany in 1921 and
 1923; in Bulgaria in 1923; in Hungary in 1919; in Lativa in 1924; in Finland in
 1918; in China, repeated attempts until 1928; and in Brazil, in 1935.
 b) The period of armed resistance to Axis occupation: in occupied Europe
 from 1941 to 1944; in China, from 1937 to 1945; and in Southeast Asia, from
 1942 to :1945.
 c) The period of armed rebellion in colonial Southeast Asia and Greece. Al-
 though the principles employed in these revolutions had been applied as early as
 1928 in China, it was not until World War II that their development had reached
 its height and their validity had been proved. The CP's of Indochina, Malaya,
 Burma, the Philippines, Indonesia and India following the war adopted them.
 9. The breaking of the Communist strategy into three historical periods has largely
 been the result of "objective conditions", i.e. social-political-economic factors outside the
 control of the Communists, but providing them exploitable situations. The success of the
 Bolsheviks in 1917 was achieved by a combination of factors that is not likely to be repeated
 again in any other country. Nevertheless, Communists in other "advanced" countries have
 long been taught the "lessons" of the Bolshevik Revolution, and they include some military
 tactics that would appear to be applicable to a city uprising anywhere. The special conditions
 required for resistance operations are evident: the presence of enemy military force.&and "`a"'  - T
 general patriotic hatred for them. There are many similarities between military resistance
 and colonial insurrection. The application of the "lessons" of the Chinese Communist ttevolu-
 tion in colonial countries has been the main feature of the post-war period. It cannot be said
 at this time that the :lessons are more, or less, likely to succeed than the application of the
 techniques of the Bolshevik Revolution. In Greece, the attempt failed; in Malaya, Burma,
 Philippines and Indochina the attempts are apparently at stalemates. In Indonesia and India,
 they have failed.
 10.  It is interesting to note that CP India, having unsuccessfully tried both the tactics
 of the Bolshevik revolution and the tactics of the Chinese Revolution, now attempts to formu-
 late a program which calls for a combination of the two. If it succeeds (and it seems doubtful
 if the two types of revolution can be combined) it will be another major contribution to Commu-
 nist revolutionary practice.
 11.  The three types of Communist military effort defined. The principles for the re-
 sistance organization were develop during World War II, mainly to help the USSR in the war
 with the Axis. They had limited objectives: to harass the occupying Axis-armies, to collect
 intelligence for Allied use and to deny the economic potential of the country to the Axis. The
 organizational structure reflected these missions. Communist resistance formations were
 generally small and mobile and only in rare instances did they engage Axis military formations
 head on. In two cases (Greece and Yugoslavia) the resistance military formations went beyond
 these objectives and during the resistance laid the groundwork for a later attempt to seize
 power. The cases examined were the Communist resistance operations of the USSR, France,
 Italy and Greece. The tactics developed by the Communists would be applicable by any Com-
 munist Party fighting a non-Communist occupation army.l
 12.  The techniques of the Communist revolution in colonial areas have developed over
 the past twenty years, largely as a result of the experiences of the Chinese Communists. The
 distinguishing features of the colonial revolution are:
 a)  the creation of a large army based on the peasantry. The army is first cre-
 ated from. isolated detachments of armed peasantry, but as the revolution succeeds
 the number of troops increases.
 1 A current example being the utilization of Communist guerrilla forces behind UN' lines in
 Korea in direct support of the North Korean forces. See paragraph 130.

 b)  the occupation and protection by this army of a safe base or bases, which be-
 comes the headquarters for the Party political. and military campaign, and which
 is gradually expanded as the power of the Communist forces increases.
 c)  a long-term, sustained effort, with a slow and gradual accumulation of mili-
 tary strength. The Chinese effort took over 20 years.
 Case histories for the preparation and conduct of a colonial revolution by the Chinese,
 Malayan, Philippine and Greek Communist Parties have been included in this study. The
 tactics appear to be applicable to all Southeast Asian countries, some areas in Latin America,
 the Near East and Africa.
 13.        The model for the city insurrection, which takes place in "advanced" capitalist
 countries, is the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. The highly centralized communications of an
 advanced country with strong, mobile coercive forces call for tactics very different from a
 resistance operation or a colonial revolution. The main features of a city insurrection are:
 a)  the necessity to penetrate and subvert the state coercive forces, to win them
 over to the support of the Communists or to neutralize them during the seizure of
 power.
 b)  the creation of armed detachments of workers, and obtaining the support of
 the proletariat for strike action and demonstrations.
 c)  The close timing and coordination of the forces of the Communists. The in-
 surrection must be completed in a few days, before the opposing forces have time
 to rally, although the political preparation for the insurrection precedes it for
 years.
 The Bolshevik Revolution in Petrograd in 1917 was examined in detail for this study.
 An account of the Brazilian Communist Revolution of 1935, which bears many similarities to
 the Bolshevik model, is also included. Similar tactics would probably be employed by Com-
 munists staging an insurrection in any "advanced, capitalist country", particularly in Western
 Europe.
 14.  The general patterns of the colonial revolution, the resistance operation, and the
 city insurrection are set forth In detail below.
 A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES
 15.  Basis of the post-war insurrections. The numerous Communist military uprisings
 in the countries of Southeast Asia following the war were undertaken on the basis of several
 complex factors: (a) events and conditions at home and abroad which the Parties considered
 favorable for revolution (i.e., the "objective situation". in Communist parlance); (b) enhanced
 political strength of the Parties and the existence of at least the nucleus of a Party military
 force (i.e., the "subjective" conditions); (c) existence of a body of practical doctrine about
 strategy and tactics in "colonial and semi-colonial" countries developed during the Chinese
 Communist Revolution.
 16.   "Objective Conditions." In the eyes of the Communists the war had a profound
 effect on the political and social stability and economies of the countries of Asia, on their
 relations with the "imperialist" homelands in Europe, and on the world balance of power be-
 tween the democratic "imperialist" countries and the Soviet-satellite "camp.' The Commu-
 nists thought that these effects worked in their favor, as was stated by Andrei Zhdanov at the
 inaugural session of the Cominform in 1947, and they believed that the favorable trend would
 go on indefinitely, eventually leading to crises in which the Parties could seize total power.
 The strongest manifestation of the changed situation in Asia was the rise of nationalism, upon
 which the Communists had long tried to capitalize. Not until the end of the war, however, did
 they consider the ferment strong enough and the colonial governments (and their principles)
 weakened enough to capitalize fully on it.

 17.  Party Strength. The Communist Parties participated actively in the anti-Japanese
 resistance during hccupation. By doing so, they developed military forces, which they
 were able to carry over in one form or another into the post-war period and which provided
 them with the nucleus Qf an insurrectionary army. The Party leadership had gained valuable
 experience from underground operations during the occupation, and from the military opera-
 tions. Many of the Parties also emerged from the resistance with stores of arms, ammuni-
 tion, and other supplies.
 18.  Lessons of the Chinese Communist Revolution  Out of necessity by way of his-
 torical accident, the Chinese Communists hit upon a formula for revolution that was radically
 different from the "classic" Bolshevik tradition and that, by extension, seems applicable to
 other Asian countries. Following an abortive uprising in the cities, they organized an army
 of peasants to protect themselves against the military forces of the Nationalists; they used
 the army to seize and hold an inaccessible region in the far Northwest (Shensi Province);
 after consolidating their position there -- aided by the neighboring USSR--they used the army
 to "politicalize" the peasantry in adjoining areas particularly through land redistribution and,
 gradually, to expand their base, finally accumulating enough strength and resources to engage
 and defeat the forces of the Government and to take over complete state power.
 From their experiences, a formula for revolution in what the Communist call the
 "colonial and semi-colonial" countries was developed with the following terms:
 a)   The most immediately revolutionary section of the population is not the city
 proletariat, but the peasantry;
 b)    By raising a military. force, and seizing a safe base in the countryside, the
 Communist Party can begin a political-military struggle aimed principally at the
 enlistment of the peasantry for the armed struggle: the principal means of, in-,
 ducement is the distribution of and among the poor peasants;
 c)   The Communist Party can begin a military struggle with limited military and
 political resources because communications difficulties will impede counter-
 measures by the government;1.
 d)    By a combination of military action and political organizing among the peas-
 ant masses, the Party can gradually accumulate forces large enough and suffi-
 ciently seasoned to engage eventually the forces of the enemy;
 e)  Even a limited military struggle will tax the strength of the government,
 throw its economy out of balance and, consequently, cause frictions to grow among
 the social groups supporting the government and thus lead to a crisis.
 19.  The Safe-base, Rough terrain, dense vegetation, and primitive roads common in
 "colonial and semi-colonial" countries of Asia make it possible for Communist Parties to do
 what the Chinese Communists did when they seized part of Shensi -- capture a defensible area
 where the military- force can be built up, trained, and sustained. Having an armed force, the
 Communists can relinquish an area that proves untenable and seize another. Several small
 bases can be taken simultaneously, later to be consolidated into one, or given up as conditions
 and strategy dictate. It is essential, however, that some kind of a safe area be secured.
 20.  Combination of Military and Political Action. The main functions of the Commu-
 nist military force are -
 a)  capture a defensible area; defend it;
 b)  aid in the expansion of the political basis of the revolution: facilitate land
 distribution; protect organizers; attract or coerce peasants to support the insur-
 rection by show of force;
 1 Conversely the existence of an effective communications system will impede the efforts of
 a "colonial or semi-colonial" CP to begin and sustain military operations. See the recent
 complaints of CP India to- that effect.

 c)  damage the resources of the enemy; make him operate a security force be-
 yond his capacity to do so; weaken the morale of his troops by constant harassing
 actions; disrupt his lines of communication and transport of commodities by am-
 bushes, destroying roads, railroads, power and telephone lines, etc.
 d)  expand the safebase(s) until the opposing government is sufficiently weakened
 and can be overthrown.
 21.   The political apparatus of the Party is largely stripped down to provide cadres for
 the military force and the supporting mass organizations. It becomes a control and servicing
 apparatus for the military force: it posts cadres in key military commands, forms mass
 organizations among the peasants to provide food, intelligence, and recruits for the military
 force; and creates special directing organs (staffs) and servicing elements (intelligence,
 courier communications, weapons and ammunition production, supply, etc.).
 22.  "Phasing" of the Insurrection. Because colonial Communist Parties begin their
 insurrections before they have gather-eU preponderant political strength, and use military
 action as a political:izing instrument, they expect the struggle to be long. (The Chinese Com-
 munists fought for over twenty years.) Military forces will be accumulated gradually; the
 enemy is reduced by political, economic, and military attrition. Communist military opera-
 tions are adjusted to tactical and political conditions prevailing at any given time. If neces-
 sary, the force can be withdrawn to the safe area for long periods and confine itself to de-
 fensive actions. Communist military tactics in colonial countries can be much more flexible
 than in "advanced" countries, where the military effort must be quick and overwhelming, or
 be crushed.
 23.       There are two main phases in the colonial insurrection: the military defensive,
 when the Communists are trying to accumulate forces and establish productive and military
 strategic safe-bases; and the military offensive when sufficient forces have been accumulated
 to launch the by-then developed regular army in powerful attacks on the main body of enemy
 forces.
 24.       The period of the military defensive is marked by the use of guerrilla tactics. It
 is divided, according to a document issued by the CP Brazil entitled "Guerrilla, Arm of the
 People," into three phases:
 a) "Acts of sabotage and terrorism, performed by individuals or small groups
 native to the region, who usually work under the very eyes of the enemy." During
 this phase, the Party must organize numerous small secret groups, whose duties
 consist of "sabotage of transportation, communications and supplies; the collection
 of information for. friendly troops or for the guerrilla organization; and finall j ---.__
 propaganda aiming at the complete revelation of the true character of the enemy-
 and the preparation of the people for the fight."
 "Little by little, the enemy avoids the most warlike regions, moves its troops and sup-
 plies over other routes, changes its depots to other places, begins to leave behind only key
 garrisons or send punitive expeditions from time to time. Then the guerrillas become more
 and more masters of the region, progressively armed and organized into military-type bands,
 attack the remaining enemy bands, attack the remaining enemy soldiers, and finally launch
 more energetic attacks on neighboring areas."
 b)  "Next, larger groups are formed which have a military organization and are
 generally based in mountains, forests, or other relatively inaccessible regions,
 whence they can launch constant attacks on the enemy."
 c)  "Finally, the groups of guerrilla warriors, now having available considerable
 resources, are organized into a regular army and establish a definite front and
 begin the occupation of the territory."
 Progress from one "phase" to another is not sharply defined: irregular guerrilla bands
 continue to exist right up to the final, all-out offensive; the forces of the Communists through-
 out these phases are of varying sizes and shapes; small-scale harassing operations are car-
 ried on even when the military force has begun to be reorganized into a "regular army;" the
 first "phase" is skipped over in some cases.

 The Brazilian document has this to say about centralized control of military operation:
 "Coordination is relatively easy in the third phase of the fight, when the existence
 of the regular army and of a territory dominated by it allow the full development
 of a central command. In the first two phases, however, such coordination and
 the establishment of the central command are extremely hard: this can, never-
 theless, be greatly aided through the previous existence of an organized..Commu-
 nist Party."
 25.    The period of the military offensive consists in (a) consolidation of Party-military
 control within the safe-base area; (b) completion of the reorganization of the Communist
 forces into a "regular army;" (c) expansion of the safe-base in the surrounding countryside;
 (d) attacks in force on individual enemy strongholds, then on major provincial cities, then on
 the national capital; (e) creation of a national Communist government and consolidation of
 political and territorial control over the entire country.
 26.  Adjustment of the Party to "Phasing.", The role of the political apparatus of the
 Communist Party and its ancillary ("mass" or front) organizations is adjusted to the stages
 of the military strategy.
 In the early stages, the Party mobilizes its military elements, organizes them into
 tactical units, makes plans for the initial operations, and turns its regular committees into
 military staffs.
 Later, when the military forces have grown sufficiently and conditions afford an oppor-
 tunity for major operations, they are organized as a separate military auxiliary, divorced
 from the control of local Party committees, but still, however, under the control of the central
 Party headquarters. When this happens, the political apparatus becomes primarily a serv-
 icing organization for the Communist army and its operations. The civil administrations that
 are set up in "liberated" areas under Party control are also aimed at supporting the military
 effort.
 27.  In cities under enemy control, the basic function of the (underground) political
 apparatus of the Party is to penetrate governmental agencies, trade unions, and other social
 and political groups to agitate within them, subvert as many city dwellers as possible with a
 view to raising insurrections in the cities when the final, all-out clash is feasible. The extent
 to which cadres are pulled out of city organizations and sent to the field depends upon the
 military requirements and priorities at any given time.
 28.  In organizational terms, the insurrectionary colonial Communist Party must pro-
 vide for the creation and equipping of an armed force, coordination of the political and mili-
 tary programs (and organizations), and constant supervision of all organizations and opera-
 tions, revising plans and organizational forms in the light of "phase" requirements. The in-
 surrection is organizationally fluid and complex, maturing, in case of success, into a Party
 government and dictatorship.
 29.  The discussion which follows treats the problems faced by the insurrectionary
 colonial Communist :Parties in organizing and carrying on their revolutions under the follow-
 ing headings:
 PROBLEMS OF THE SAFE BASE
 THE DECISION TO BEGIN MILITARY ACTION
 ADJUSTMENT OF THE PARTY APPARATUS
 DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMUNIST ARMY
 ORGANIZATION OF SUPPORT
 The discussion is based upon a study of Communist insurrections in China, Malaya,
 Philippines, and Greece, and upon partial examination of the uprisings in Indochina, Indonesia,
 Burma, and India. The rebellion in Greece does not fall in all details into the colonial pattern.
 However, it is decidely closer to the colonial formula than to the "classic" Bolshevik pattern
 of a city insurrection based on the proletariat.

 B. PROBLEMS OF THE SAFE BASE.
 30.        The Party's choice of an area to capture and hold for the building up of its mili-
 tary force depends upon chance, balance of forces, and only partly upon calculation. A base
 may combine several desirable features or it may be simply the only area the insurgents are
 capable of taking at the time.
 31.        Ideally, from the Communist point of view, a safe area would have the following
 features:
 a)  Political value: large population, generally susceptible to the revolutionary
 appeal, to be drawn en masse into the Communist army and into support activities;
 b)  Economic productivity: food production in appreciable excess of the basic
 needs of the population; any manufacturing industry is desirable; it is also desir-
 able that the economy of areas under Government control depend upon the pro-
 duction of the Communist base area;
 c)  Military defensibility with minimum effort: a matter of immediate and neigh-
 boring terrain and character of approaches;
 d)  Strategic location within the country: located so as to threaten enemy econ-
 omy, communications lines, political resources, and military security; at the
 same time, give the Communist maximum advantages for expansion into surround-
 ing areas and cover for more distant expeditions.
 32.  The Communists are seldom able to take an area that combines all these features
 Ideally. They must usually be content in the early and intermediate stages of the insurrection,
 with securing an area that is merely defensible and reasonable adequate in food production,
 hoping to improve their position later.
 33.  In many cases, the Communist forces have taken areas close by a foreign country
 to secure their rear. Preferably, of course, the area will be adjacent to a friendly state in
 order to facilitate outside support. Thus, the Indochinese Communists concentrated in areas
 adjoining neutral countries (Thailand and China), and are expected to obtain substantial assist-
 ance from Communist China, as soon as possible. The Greek Communists established their
 safe-base in Yugoslavia, Albania, and immediately adjacent Greek territories; one of the rea-
 sons why they gave up their attempted revolution was the defection of Tito, which left their
 rear exposed and deprived them of a substantial part of their logistical support. There have
 been recent indications that the Communist insurgents in Burma are moving to the Northeast,
 so as to be close to friendly China. The capture of Tibet by the Chinese Communists may
 eventually enable CP India to set up a safe-base there.
 34.  An important element in the defensibility of the base area, aside from the military
 strength of the enemy, is the condition of communications in the surrounding countryside. If
 they are primitive (as in China), the forces opposing the Communists will find it difficult to
 maneuver for effective attacks, and to coordinate operations of separated forces.
 35.  Uses of the safe base. The military usefulness of the safe base is that --
 a)  It provides a place where a military force can be built up and maintained --
 recruited, equipped, trained, and indoctrinated;
 b) It provides a center for the coordination of military operations: a planning,
 reporting, communications, and administrative center.
 Schools, hospitals and convalescent facilities; storage places for all kinds of supplies; shops
 for the manufacture and repair of weapons and ammunition and other equipment are estab-
 lished in the safe area. Food-is raised there on Party-controlled farms. By controlling a
 share of the national food supply, the Party is able to interfere with the economy and thereby
 disturb the political equilibrium of the state and the government's staying power. If the safe
 base adjoins a friendly foreign country, the Communists will have access to its productive
 resources and military supplies.

 36.  The political utility of the safe base is that --
 a)  It provides a center for the establishment of a "democratic," "people's" or
 "liberation" government;
 b) It provides a jumping-off place for military-political expansion into sur-
 rounding areas (politicalization of the peasants).
 37.  The "Liberation Government." The "Government" set up by the Communists in
 the safe base area.has bpth a political and a practical organizational purpose. Politically, it
 serves as a rallying-point for non-Communist elements opposed to the regime for various
 reasons and it lends prestige and an aura of legality to the insurrection -- a distinct propa-
 ganda asset. There is no question but that such a'facade is useful in winning favor with non-
 Communist, nationalist elements: it was amply demonstrated in China. Practically, the
 setting up of a pseudo-national government. relieves the Party of a large part of the burden
 and the onus of civil administration in "liberated" areas: administrative posts can be given
 to non-Communists, thereby relieving Party cadres for more important work.
 The practice of creating a "government" seems confined to Parties with substantial
 forces and a proven territorial base (Greece, China, Indo-china). Some insurrectionary
 Parties have not yet attempted it (Philippines, Malaya).
 38. There are some disadvantages to the strategy of the safe-base.
 (1)
 The base is, perforce, unstrategically located in an area remote from the
 centers of power which must finally be seized.
 (2) The base is far from the centers of industrial production (arms, clothing,
 other equipment).
 (3)
 Its distance from population centers deprives the Communists of a large
 section of the potentially revolutionary population, and of the services of
 technicians (medicos, mechanics, communications personnel, etc.).
 C. THE POLICY DECISION TO BEGIN MILITARY ACTION.
 39.   The decision to take the Party into a military revolt is serious: it means a- con-
 siderable structural reorKanization of the Party, a painful readjustment in the way of living of
 Party cadres and ranks, and thorny problems of raising and maintaining a military force.
 40.   The decision is made, of course, by the top Party leadership. For example, it was
 made by the. Secretariat of the CP Philippines and then endorsed by, and put out in the name of,
 the Political Bureau.
 41.   The Chinese Communists were forced into an insurrection by enemy action (pro-
 voked by their own action, of course). In the post-war period, however, the decision has been
 deliberately made on the basis of calculated prospects, and has not been forced upon the
 colonial Communist Parties. In some cases, the Party leadership has simply reversed its
 previous policy and has stayed in office to carry out the new policy (Greece, Malaya). In the
 Philippines a bitter factional division arose between Party leaders favoring armed insurrec-
 tion and those favoring continuation of "legal" methods, with the former finally prevailing and
 suppressing or expelling from the Party the advocates of "legal" struggle.
 42.  The influence of more authoritative or stronger fraternal Communist Parties may
 be a powerful stimulant to the decision in favor of armed uprising. Thus, the leaders of the
 CP Greece sounded foreign Communist leaders before beginning the insurrectionof.1947-1949.
 The leaders of the CP Mayala canvassed Communist spokesmen of China, Great Britain, andthe
 USSR during 1945-1946, and, receiving no encouragement, postponed their uprising until later.
 The Zhdanov statement to the Cominform in October 1947 (see above,  ara'2) was a striking
 example of the leadership role of the CP Soviet Union. It Was elaborated at the Second
 Congress of the CP India and the Southeast Asia Youth Conference. The CP's India, Burma,
 and Malaya, all adopted resolutions in favor of a more militant policy. In the Philippines, the
 faction of Party leaders favoring armed action got control of the leading Party offices in May
 1948., just a few months after the Zhdanov thesis had been given general circulation.

 43.   There are indications that two decisions are actually made by the Party: the first,
 a preliminary decision that a "revolutionary'situation" is developing and that the Party should
 prepare itself to begin fighting in the' not too-distant future; and a later decision to actually
 begin fighting. The CP Philippines decided in May 1948 that there was a "heightening of the
 revolutionary flow" and shortly thereafter carried out some reforms in the Party organiza-
 tion: the decision to take to the field was not made until January 1950, when it was estimated
 that a "revolutionary situation" already existed. The CP Greece, when it accepted the Varkiza
 Agreement in February 1945, must have decided that a Revolutionary situation was not too far
 off, for it sent most of its military cadres into camps in Albania and Yugoslavia in 1945, and
 made anumber of personnel and structural changes in the Party organization during the next
 two years. It gave some indication of having reached a decision to begin fighting in September
 1946, but did not undertake serious military operations until the summer of 1947.
 44.  Content of the Policy Decision. It would be reasonable to suppose that the Party
 leadership would make a thorough assessment of its own capabilities and resources as part of
 the basis for the decision. It is surprising, then, to discover that such is not always the case.
 In its resolution of January 1950, for example, the CP Philippines treats the "objective situ-
 ation" in some detail, and from the document itself, it appears that the decision was made
 entirely on the basis of an evaluation of external conditions: the condition of the Party itself
 is not even mentioned. Again, the CP India, during its recent crisis, issued resolutions and
 discussions in which the "situation" is described as being "revolutionary," and the task of the
 Party to be one of setting the masses "on the rails" of an armed uprising, but in which the
 resources of the Party are not merely glossed over as being good, but actually admitted to be
 at low ebb.
 45.  In any event, the colonial Communist Party puts more stock in the external politi-
 cal, economic, and social trends than it does in its immediate resources: provided the trends
 appear to be revolutionary, the Party will be ready to go ahead with an armed uprising on quite
 limited political and military resources. As is shown in the resolution of the CP Philippines
 of January 1950, a "revolutionary situation" has two main features: (a) conditions are not
 merely bad, but (b) will continue to get worse, because the "bourgeoisie" are divided and per-
 manently unable to unite and solve the crucial economic and social problems. With the
 "situation" already developing towards a crisis, the best the Communist Party can do is to
 aggravate the ills of the country by carrying on an armed struggle and to prepare itself mili-
 tarily and politically to stage an all-out campaign when the crisis arrives.
 46.  The major portion of the resolution of the CP Philippines is devoted to a discussion
 of the existing social, economic, and political conditions, including an estimate as to what each
 of the major enemy political parties will be able to do to remedy them (conclusion, negative).
 The last part of the resolution sets forth the "concrete tasks" for the Party to improve its
 own organization. These "organizational, military and educational tasks" are included in the
 Philippine Appendix. Briefly, they consisted of strengthening internal discipline and control,
 raising the level of political understanding within the Party and its armed force, improving
 the work of the Party among the peasants, and reforming the supporting services (finances,
 communications, publications).
 D. ADJUSTMENT OF THE PARTY APPARATUS
 47.  In addition to'the arguments bolstering the decision to begin military action, the
 Party also formulates a strategy and prescribes the "concrete tasks" for the implementation
 of the decision.
 It takes time to get the Party in shape for a military insurrection. The military force
 has to be mobilized, Party cadres have to be given definite assignments, new organizations
 have to be created to handle problems peculiar to military operations, old offices of no use
 when the Party takes to the field have to be closed down or be put underground for "stay-
 behind" operations. Security measures must be put into effect in anticipation of police sup-
 pression. If a preliminary decision had been made, the Party would already have accom-
 plished some of these things, and need only wind them up after making the final decision.
 48.  Nevertheless, there is always a "time lapse" between the making of the decision
 and the beginning of major operations. The duration of the time lapse in each case studied
 was a matter of months: from January to 29 March 1950 in the Philippines; from September
 1946 (?) to mid-summer 1947 in Greece; and, in Malaya, from mid-March to late July 1948,

 To some extent, the Party may be able to pick the time for beginning its major opera-
 tions: the CP Philippines picked the date of the eighth anniversary of the founding of its
 resistance-born army; the CP Greece seems also to have begun operations at what it consid-
 ered to be the most propitious time. The CP Malaya, however, with its army in "moth-balls"
 hit upon the idea of a campaign of terrorism as a means of shocking its people into action, and
 is believed to have counted on having a longer preparatory period and to have been caught
 short when the Government took vigorous countermeasures.
 49.  The main changes which the Party makes in its organization immediately prior to
 the insurrection are:
 Decentralization of authority to lower (Regional or District Party) organs. This
 usually occurs early, in some cases (Greece and Malaya) before the making of the final de-
 cision, possible as a result of a preliminary decision. In Malaya, Regional Bureaus were cre-
 ated to direct all Party operations in prescribed areas, later, direction of operations passed
 progressively into the hands of lower Party committees (State Committees, then District
 Committees), this latter development probably resulting from increasing communications dif-
 ficulties. In Greece, City Committees were given greater authority, under the supervision of
 an "Instructor" from the Politburo, which had removed to the safe base. Regional Committees
 in the countryside were dissolved. Military operations were directed by "area" or "regional"
 commands in seven prescribed areas in "liberated" country until October 1947 when they were
 replaced by Division Headquarters, presumably under a more centralized direction exercised
 by General Headquarters through three regional Headquarters. In the Philippines, several
 members of the Politburo were individually assigned to act as "supervisors" of the most
 important of the newly created Regional Committees. Also, she General Headquarters of the
 army was dissolved. Later, it was re-established when conditions made it feasible to begin
 the reorganization of the guerrilla army into a "regular army."
 Reassignment of cadres from political to military work takes place  Colonial CP's
 are generally small numerically and short of completely reliable cadres. Many of them had
 cadres with experience in guerrilla fighting during the resistance. But a Communist uprising
 is a different matter: it lacks the unifying and disciplining appeal of patriotic resistance and
 it may last a very long time. Consequently, the shortage of absolutely politically reliable
 cadres means that those who are available must be carefully conserved and utilized with maxi-
 mum efficiency. The "best" cadres are sent into the field and only skeleton organization are
 left behind to do what they can in "enemy" areas and these are put deep underground. (A fre-
 quent complaint of the CP Philippines was that its "stay behind" organizations were so far
 underground that they were practically worthless; the same difficulty afflicted the city organi-
 zations of the CP Greece, which were completely paralyzed by Greek police action.)
 Discipline and security are greatly increased, even before the formal decision to begin
 military action is made. In a period when the Party is fighting for its life, it can tolerate as
 cadres only those individuals who are reliable and efficient. All others become a liability and
 while they might be allowed to hang on in a less critical period, they must be purged in anti-
 cipation of military action. The decision to take to the field inevitably throws up numbers of
 previously satisfactory cadres who oppose the decision for one reason or another. These are
 disciplined by suspension or expulsion: they are rehabilitated if possible, but are always
 under a cloud.
 Purges are undertaken, in extreme cases, to rid the Party of those opposed.to the de-
 cision to take military action.
 The National Control Commission, the central disciplinary organization, is strengthen-
 ed and control commissions are set up on local levels. In Greece, the Party instituted a sys-
 tem of "vigilantes" to spot indications of back-sliding and inefficiency in its cadres.
 Stricter qualifications for positions of leadership are instituted and readmission to the
 Party or to committee positions is made more difficult.

 In some cases the Party is forced underground as a result of government action, as in Greece.

 SECRET CONTROL /U. S. OFFICIALS ONLY
 Security Information
 The Politburo and other central executive organs are moved from the city to the safe-
 base, and many of the members are reassigned'to the various regional organizations.
 New Party organs are created, such as military staffs and support sections to direct
 and control t e military operations. In Malaya, Armed Forces Departments were established
 in each State Committee. The Min Yuen (People's Movement) was organized. In the Philip-
 pines various technical sections were created.
 Other Party organs are strengthened and increased in size. In the Philippines the
 National Finance_ Committee and the Regional Finance Committees were placed under close
 cadre control. The Organizational Bureau was expanded.
 Some Party functional sections are dissolved to release cadres assigned to these
 sections for reassignment to more important functions.
 Increased emphasis is placed on Part schools. The cadres have to be trained for
 their new tasks. (Cl) CPhilippines began-training of special cadres to secure the cooperation
 of other armed groups who were non-Communist.)
 The communications system is strengthened. Courier service is better organized on a
 more regular basis. More peop a are assigned courier duties and regular message centers
 and lay-over places are established along courier routes. Plans are sometimes made (Philip-
 pines) for getting communications equipment and trained personnel and for establishing a
 wireless or land-line net.
 50.  Vulnerability during transition period. The Party is particularly vulnerable to
 counteraction in the perio   etween t 15 e m  ing o the decision and the time when its forces
 have been mobilized sufficiently for it to undertake a major military operation. The apparatus
 of the Party is in flux and its personnel often at loose ends, doing things at which they are still
 relative amateurs, and undergoing in most cases severe emotional and/or ideological crises.
 The machinery for conducting and supporting military operations is still imcomplete. Its
 supplies, particularly, of weapons and ammunition, are likely to be limited. The, propaganda
 build-up and the act of recruiting are necessarily semi-overt, at least locally. Party offices
 are physically being moved into the field or to safe-places for underground stay-behind opera-
 tions. Party records are destroyed or moved, and are subject to capture or loss in the pro-
 cess: it may be difficult for the Party's security apparatus to check the bona fides of new re-
 cruits. All these factors provide opportunities for surveillance of functionaries, seizure of
 records, penetration, defection, and provocation;. An alert security force might very well be
 able to squash a colonial insurrection before it had developed, but any action would have to be
 thorough and ruthless.
 E. DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMUNIST ARMY.
 51.  Recruitment of Communist military forces was simplified for Communist Parties
 beginning revolutions after World War II. The nucleus of their military organization was the
 wartime resistance movements which had been sponsored by them and equipped and supplied
 by the Allies. As new recruits were channelled to the military forces, the Party was able to
 seize and maintain a base of operations from which further political-military expansion could
 be launched. Thus, there has been first_an army, and then a safe-base. The Chinese Commu-
 nists learned their lesson the hard way, by experience. They organized an area by political
 means alone and then organized a military force. Not until the experience of the Long March
 and the establishment of the safe-base in Shensi did they begin to utilize systematically their
 military force in expansion.
 52.  The size and structure of the regular units of the Communist Army depends, on the
 stage of development of the safe-base and the type of operations being carried out. In the be-
 ginning, squads and platoons undertake guerrilla operations on a small, loosely coordinated
 scale. At that time, they live entirely off the countryside with infrequent communications with
 each other. As the scale of operations grows, these small units are incorporated into larger
 formations, (e.g., regiments and divisions) with regular service elements, coordinating staffs,
 and comprehensive communications. As a rule, however, units are kept small, to simplify
 supply and to reduce vulnerability to enemy attack.

 Security Information
 Three available examples of post-war colonial Communist armies--Greece, Philip-
 pines, Malaya--show how resources and events influence the general organization of the army:
 a.  Greece. Began with rather large forces (about 10,000), well-equipped, well
 led, and safely based. Conversion from small-scale operations by small bands to
 tactical employment of Brigades and Divisions early in the struggle. Regression
 to guerrilla operations* with unfavorable conditions.
 b.  Philippines. Began with relatively large forces (about 10,000), already in the
 field and presumably adequately equipped. Passed to impressive seizures 'of
 towns in apparently battalion strength within seven months of decision and planned
 conversion to orthodox ("regular army") operations in near future.
 c.  Malaya. Began with few forces, not adequately equipped, not fully mobilized,
 and with little actual combat experience. Apparently, contemplated ambitious
 operations in at least regimental strength at early date. However, unfavorable
 conditions forced progressive disintegration of tactical organization and diminish-
 ing operations.
 53.  The troops of the colonial Communist force in the beginning are "regulars" --that
 is, they are full-time fighters and are, on the whole, politically "reliable.". As soon as opera-
 tions are begun, efforts are made to dxaw in non-Communist peasants--first, into political
 and support activities, then into part-time or "irregular" fighting formations, and eventually,
 into the full-time, "regular" army. Even when the build-up consists of a campaign of terror-
 ism, as in Malaya, the first fighting unfits are select military'cadres, and in every case stud-
 ied, some kind of irregular fightin .groups were formed later.
 54. The most important general conditions limiting the size of regular formations
 used tactically, and consequently, the organization. of the army are:
 a.  Supplies. If inadequate, operations must be small and aimed at obtaining
 (small raids and ambushes). If no supply organization exists, then forces must
 spend time foraging and will not be able to concentrate for the time necessary for
 careful planning, briefing, and rehearsal of large operations. Heterogeneous
 weapons and necessity to refit ammunition limit firepower and feasibility of large
 operations.
 b.  Enemy tactics. Until final stage (full-scale engagement of enemy), Commu-
 nist tactics are in direct response to enemy tactics; flight and temporary disin-
 tegration at advance of superior enemy; concentration and larger tactical opera-
 tions against small enemy forces and areas temporarily free from enemy.
 c.  Condition of leadership, extent of training; morale of ranks. For example,
 the Chinese Communists had great difficulty in solving ogis is  problems of
 large tactical deployment because leaders had been trained in small operations.
 d.  Terrain. Particularly difficult terrain makes use of large units impossible
 or unprofitable.
 55.        Special and irregular units in the Communist Army are organized for two main
 purposes: to serve as training organizat],ons for combat-able men who will eventually be ab-
 sorbed by the regular units and to organize non-combatants to give support to the regular
 forces, In China, for example, the combat-able persons were organized in Youth Vanguards
 and in Model Detachments, and many of them, when trained, were placed in units of the Field
 Forces. Self Defense Detachments, made up of older men, and Women's Detachments per-
 formed intelligence, medical and protective functions.
 In general, the first responsibility of the special and irregular units is to aid the reg-
 ular forces in military operations, engaging. in small battles, diversionary moves, supplying
 food, caring for wounded, etc. They also protect Communist Party and front organizations
 and installations (Malaya), not only in the safe area, but in areas which have not yet been
 secured. They are called upon to carry out occasional acts of terror, such as assassinations,
 sabotage and intimidation. They take over local police authority in the early stages of consol-
 idation of newly won areas.  They also serve to militarize those segments of the population

 which are unqualified for regular military service, thus exerting military control over them,
 and insuring their complicity in the Communist operation should there be any doubts concern-
 ing their loyalty to the cause.
 Formation and control of irregular units is often the responsibility of the local Party
 organization in its own name (e.g., the "wide self-defense" groups in Greece), or in the name
 of a controlled mass organization (e.g., "Self-Protection" squads of the People's Movement
 in Malaya). Sometimes (China), the Party organization in the regular army units organizes
 such units.
 56.  Organization and functions of staffs.
 The Communist military force consists of tactical formations performing military
 operations; and various staffs for planning, coordination and control, and the management of
 special support and technical services required for operations.
 The character of the military staff--their competence, composition, and relations with
 the Party political apparatus  varies with the actual situation as it is reflected in the "phases"
 of the insurrection. In the early stages, when the military force is being accumulated and is
 carrying on operations of a purely guerrilla nature, local staffs, responsible for tactical
 formations in a relatively small area and closely connected with corresponding organs of the
 Party's political apparatus, are most essential. At this time, whatever central direction may
 be given to the military forces is likely to be quite general, and exercised through the chan-
 nels of the political apparatus. The Secretariat of the CP Philippines, for example, took over
 the problems of centralized direction of HMB formations, serving as a General Headquarters
 for several months after the decision had been made to begin fighting. HMB units were direc-
 ted by the Regional Committees of the political apparatus, and the general control over them
 exercised by the Secretariat was achieved by courier correspondence and by posting members
 of the Political Bureau with the Regional Committees.
 Similarly, the Political Bureau of the CP Malaya is believed to have constituted itself
 as a "Military High Command," while the State Committees of the political apparatus (through
 their Armed Forces Departments) took over the functions of area military staffs.
 57.          When conditions have permitted the numerical expansion of the military force and.
 the acquisition of a safe base, or at least, prospects of one, it will be necessary to establish
 a firm central directing staff if operations are to progress beyond the guerrilla stage and the
 army to be satisfactorily serviced. Then, military operations become more technical and the
 military force will have to be reconstituted as a centralized auxiliary of the Party and its di-
 rection divorced to a large extent from local organs of the political apparatus.
 Conversely, if conditions prevent the expansion of the military force and its utilization
 in large-scale operations, direction may remain indefinitely in the hands of local organs of.the
 political apparatus (cf. Malaya).
 58.        Central direction of a (military) technical nature is achieved by the creation of a
 General Headquarters, comprising a commander-in-chief, chief of staff, and varying numbers
 of chiefs for particular staff functions (intelligence, supply, communications, etc.), the estab-
 lishment of regular communications, and the regularizing of command channels through the
 military service (from General Headquarters through area headquarters to the tactical com-
 mand staffs).
 The Party may also organize a Military Committee or Commission, or similar body,
 at national Party headquarters for political control and coordination between the political and
 military (GHQ) programs. Thus the CP Philippines organized a Military Committee of 15
 members to coordinate political and military work and to plan for the future reorganization of
 the HMB and the creation of its GHQ. There was a substantial overlapping of personnel be-
 tween the Military Committee and the GHQ, both being manned by top leaders of the political
 apparatus.
 59.  When a "liberation" government is created, the Communist military force oper-
 ates as a nominal agency of the Communist government. Thus the CP Greece organized a
 "Supreme War Council of the Democratic Army" in August 1948 to supervise the army's

 General Headquarters. It consisted of ranking Party leaders, and its purpose has been de-
 scribed as an effort by the Party to water down the authority of General Markos, who was
 Commander in chief of the. army, Minister of War in the "Democratic Government" and head
 of the General Headquarters, and who was suspected of Titoist nationalist deviationism. As
 first constituted, however, the President of the Supreme War Council was none other than
 Markos.
 60.   The same kind of overlapping of cadres between political and military organs
 occurs in the area staffs. It is sometimes difficult to tell where one leaves off and the other
 begins. Thus, even in the internal correspondence of the CP Philippines, no consistent at-
 tempt was made to distinguish between the (political) Regional Committees and the (military)
 Regional Commands, both being designated RECO's. Such a condition is most likely to be en-
 countered in the earlier stages of a colonial insurrection, when the military and political
 programs are practically one. Later, as conditions make it feasible to organize the military
 forces into a separate and centralized auxiliary, there will be a more clearly defined sep-
 aration between area military staffs and local organizations of the political apparatus. The
 reversal of this is to be seen in Malaya, where many units of the "regular" MRLA gradually
 were detached from any kind of central military direction and put under the local (District)
 committees of the political apparatus.
 Members of local Party committees are often given military command positions. They
 may continue to hold both jobs as long as the military unit stays in the home area.
 61.  Party Control of the Military Organization.
 The establishment of firm control over the actions and loyalties of Communist troops
 in colonial insurrections is a difficult task. If the object of military operations is to facilitate
 political work in these insurrections, it is also a fact that military operations tend to defeat
 the political efforts. A guerrilla force must live off the countryside to a large extent and must
 have general public sympathy with it to do so. However, the force is a natural haven for mere
 brigands, whose activities, if not controlled with an "iron discipline," will bring discredit to
 the Communist movement as a whole, and make it increasingly difficult for the force to obtain
 supplies, intelligence, and recruits from the people. The guerrilla life itself tends to breed
 indiscipline--laziness, arrogance, immorality, greed, and disregard not only for life, but also
 for property that the Communists may greatly need at a later point in the struggle. It tends
 to develop political independence on the part of leaders, and to encourage personal, rather
 than organizational loyalties. The meanness of guerrilla life and its dangers; its long periods
 of inaction, and the remoteness of victory--all make for unrest in the ranks. This is partly
 the reason for the exhortations the Parties make for some kind of operation, no matter how
 small, every day.
 In addition to the above, and numerous other factors, the Party must establish effective
 controls and constantly strive to maintain morale to prevent treachery and suppress dissent-
 ers. It must prevent hostile penetration and defections, and cope with cadres who opposed the
 policy decision or accepted it with reservations.
 62.  Cultivation of discipline takes two lines: raising the political loyalty of the`-troops
 through Marxist study and propaganda; and organizing a control-supervisory-tale-bearing
 apparatus within the army. The task is the more difficult for the fact that colonial CP's
 consist of a mass of political semi-literates and a very small number of fully indoctrinated
 cadres. The control and indoctrination organization must make maximum economical use of
 the reliable .cadres.
 63.  It is necessary, of course, to have military specialists in charge of military oper-
 ations. But military men are often shaky in their political convictions. The Party tries to
 overcome this by indoctrination, but has another solution: the Political Commissar.
 64.  The Political Commissar is an agent of the Party's political apparatus, assigned
 to a military command to ensure the political reliability of the military commander and su-
 pervise the political indoctrination of the troops.1 He sees to the proper application of orders
 1 The institution of the Political Commissar was originated by the Russian Bolsheviks in 1917
 for the October Revolution and the ensuing civil war. It was used by the Red Army during
 World War II.

 from higher authorities, reports on the military efficiency of the commander and his political
 tendencies, and on local conditions affecting the Party's standing and operations, and super-
 vises (at least) personnel assignments within the command. He may also be responsible for
 local civilian Party organizations in the section of operations of the command, and for mili-
 tary security and counter-intelligence.
 The Political Commissar has authority superior to that of the military commander in
 all political matters, and may even interfere in purely military matters. The CP Philippines
 suggested that, in the final, all-out battle, the Military Commander may take over full control,
 but presumably by then the political preparation will have been completed and the military
 campaign will be crucial.
 According to the size and-shape of the command and availability of cadres, the Politi-
 cal Commissar may work alone or with assistants. In Greece and in China, the Political
 Commissar had his own staff organization. In the Chinese Communist 8th Route Army, for
 example, this staff was called a "Politic al. Department" and consisted of five sections--
 Organization
 Education
 People's Movement
 Enemy Services (POW's)
 Work Against Traitors (Counter-espionage)
 The functions of each of the above are described in more detail in China Appendix. 47' The development of a Political Commissar System is illustrated in the case of the CP
 Philippines (q.v.):
 Political Bureau members were assigned to supervise the most important Regional
 Committees and key headquarters sections (Education, Finance) with the making of
 the policy decision. As the struggle developed and Regional cadres became more
 competent, it was decided to recall the PB members to staff national headquarters
 and to "advance promising personnel boldly." Political Commissars, however,
 were to continue to be assigned to military commands until the final battle.
 65.  When the situation and condition of the army impose a decentralization, the local
 Party organization may be expected to assume the control function over a Communist mili-
 tary force in the area. This is the reversal of the practice of the Chinese Communists after
 the Long March, but it is what seems-to have happened in Malaya. It may be expected in the
 beginnings of resistance struggle or insurrection, but if it happens later in the struggle after
 a greater centralization had been instituted, it is probably retrograde: the military force is
 not being utilized to maximum advantage.
 66.  Another control practice is the creation of a Party organization within the mili-
 tary force. It consists of cells in the lowest units, and is directed through a normal system of
 committees (company, battalion, regimental, etc.), in each case probably responsible to the
 Political Commissar.
 F. ORGANIZATION OF SUPPORT
 67.  The Communist military effort in colonial countries can grow only by drawing to
 itself popular support: In adverse circumstances, the rebel forces can break down into small
 bands capable of foraging for themselves, carrying on operations that require neither commu-
 nications with each other nor more intelligence than can be obtained from immediate recon-
 naissance.
 However, such defensive military tactics are politically sterile. For any advance to be
 made, the Communists must produce larger operations by larger units, whereupon problems of
 supply, manpower, communications, and intelligence will have to be met by organizations out-
 side the military. Therefore the Party must organize the civilian population (usually peasants
 and villagers) to fulfill these needs, and also, to bring more and more people into the revolu-
 tionary movement.

 68.  In the safe-base area, practically the entire non-combat population is mobilized
 into the fighting force itself, or into support organizations. CP China is probably the best
 example of the extensive organization of civilian support groups. The support units of the
 Chinese revolution were so well organized that often one individual was a member of more
 than one organization. Support functions were concentrated in the Peoples' Militia (although
 this organization was also responsible for some combat duties), and included Women's
 Groups, Youth Groups, Self Defense Detachments (made up of older--though able-bodied--
 men) and were assigned tasks commensurate with their abilities. Specialized groups growing
 out of these units were formed, such as the Model Detachments, which were especially capa-
 ble members of the youth groups. All of the civilian groups performed many different sup-
 port functions: supply, communications, intelligence, medical work, etc. During the Japan-.
 ese resistance period, the activities of these groups and of the Peoples' Militia were directed
 by local People's Committees for Anti-Japanese Armed Resistance.
 69.  In Malaya, the various civilian support organizations were grouped under the
 Min Yuen (People's Movement). These included the Races Liberation Alliance, Village and
 Squatter Area Committees, Peasants Union, Women's Union, and various Anti-British
 Leagues and Associations. Organizationally, they were similar to the MCP. The type of
 support function expected of each group was, as in China, according to their abilities. The
 success of the organizations outside the safe base was, of course, considerably less because
 the Communists lacked the coercive hold,-on the civilian groups.
 70.  Most of these organizations existed within the safe base area. In areas outside
 the safe-base, organization of "mass" support was achieved by local organs of the political
 apparatus, by the political organizers attached to the military force, or by mixed teams, such
 as the "expansion" teams of the CP Philippines (political organizers assisted by small armed
 detachments).
 71.  In some cases, it may be profitable for the Party to organize an apparatus for
 collecting and bringing money and other supplies from abroad, as the CP Greece did through
 its Mutual Aid (EA) and seamen's union (OENO).
 72.  Manpower. The original military complement is obtained by a mobilization of the
 members of the Party, from such still active guerrilla forces as it may have from resistance
 warfare (e.g., the Huk in the Philippines), and/or from mobilization of controlled veterans
 organizations (Malaya, Greece). The Chinese Communists obtained their original force by
 drafting peasants in the name of the soviets which the Party had set up by political means.
 73.  Later recruits for reinforcement and replacement are obtained by forced mobili-
 zation in the safe-base area, by propaganda-recruiting drives in other areas, and by transfer
 from the "mass" support organizations.
 "mobilization" proclamations issued by the Greek Communist "Democratic Army" promising
 punishment for failure to respond). In areas outside the safe-base, roving guerrilla bands
 often impress civilian youths or threaten reprisals to villages if the young men refuse to
 come out for the insurrection. The Communists also try to get neutral civilians involved in
 the movement by degrees, threatening to expose them should they balk at any step. The pea-
 sant is forced or awed into giving a little food or making a small money contribution or giving
 information on the movements of an enemy troop, and is then drawn more closely into the
 work of local "mass" organizations, eventually passing into part-time "self -defense" actions,
 cations men, medical personnel, automatic and heavy-weapons technicians, etc.
 76.  Intelligence. The Communist force needs information on enemy movements, iden-
 tities of enemy agents, terrain, and popular sentiments for its own defense. It needs infor-
 mation on, the disposition of enemy forces, character of defenses of enemy installations, lo-
 cation of assailable convoys, etc. for its offensive operations. (See Malaya, paragraph 65,
 for items considered by the MRLA in planning an attack.)
 and finally, into full-time fighting.
 75.   The main recruiting function of underground city organizations in enemy areas is
 apparently (cf. Philippines) to recruit technical, personnel -- mechanics, drivers, communi-

 77.  All members of the Party and its mass organizations act as informants. Their
 product is channeled through whatever organizational channel may be available. Local
 "mass" organizations may even have a particular person charged with collecting and trans-
 mitting .intelligence items.
 78.  Secret reporting points may be established into which information obtained by all
 sources in a given area is funneled for collation and further transmission. In Greece, such
 "Intelligence Centers" were organized and manned by intelligence specialists of the regular
 Communist army. In Malaya, "District Information Centers" appear to have been established
 by the District Committees of the political apparatus, but a military representative was
 stationed at them to transmit information to the nearest Communist army unit.
 79.   The military force itself produces intelligence by reconnaissance, command ob-
 servation, and prisoner interrogation. The extent to which military intelligence is special-
 ized depends upon the organizational condition of the Communistforce and the magnitude of its
 operations. In a centralized army, such as that of the CP Greece, the intelligence function
 may be performed by a special service, with intelligence sections an integral feature of the
 military staffs, and with intelligence teams attached to combat units (for reconaissance and
 prisoner-interrogation).
 80.  Communications. For lack of technical equipment and trained personnel, the
 colonial Communist military force is usually reduced to courier communications.
 81.  Couriers are frequently recruited from the "mass" organizations, women and
 children being favored because they are less likely to excite suspicion.
 82.  Each political and military organization has its own courier pool. High-ranking
 functionaries frequently have their own personal couriers.
 83.  In Malaya, and probably elsewhere, regular courier runs were organized, with a
 chain of safe-resting places and message centers where messages could be delivered or
 picked up.
 84.  Special courier services are frequently organized. The Communist military
 staffs in Philippines and Greece included communications sections. In the Philippines, a
 special Communications Department of the Party existed before the current uprising and
 needed only expansion to make it usable for military operations.
 85.  Radio and telephone communications are normally beyond the capabilities of
 Communist colonial forces. The CP Greece had fairly comprehensive W/T nets (W/T issued
 to units down to brigades, and to battalions on special missions). The Chinese Communists
 gradually developed extensive W/T and land-line systems. In the beginning of their revolu-
 tion, they. had-only occasional wireless communications between Juichin and the Central
 Committee in Shanghai. The CP Philippines considered the establishment of a wireless net in
 1950, one feature of which was a proposal to plant a Communist in a standard broadcasting
 station in Manila: he would broadcast carefully camouflaged coded messages in the course of
 his regular announcements.
 86.  Supply. Supply of food is no great problem in a period of decentralized military
 operations. Interdiction of the regular food supply can hamper the expansion of a Communist
 force, but need not mean its defeat, for the guerrillas can live off the countryside to a large
 extent. When the tactical formations have been enlarged and are operating away from home,
 a regular food supply service becomes essential.
 87.  Local "mass" organizations furnish supplies of food. See, for example, the
 People's Movement in Malaya. Special production, storing, and distribution services may be
 organized by the Party or the military force, usually on a local basis. The CP Philippines
 planned to create "Production Departments" on a Regional Committee level and it was pro-
 posed to organize "Harvest Struggle Committees" in military commands. The Greek Commu-
 nists had a regular quartermaster corps, with supply trains running down from Yugoslavia
 and supply service elements in tactical formations and a transport service. One of the rea-
 sons for the defeat of the Greek uprising was the inability of the Communists to supply their
 forces at some distance from the safe base.

 88.                             Armaments. An adequate supply of arms and ammunition is a more difficult pro-
 blem for the colonial Communists. They depend to a large extent on what they can capture
 from the enemy. As the CP Philippines put it, "our main source of weapons ultimately is
 Washington. . . ." In some cases the Party may have appreciable quantities of arms left over
 from the anti-Japanese resistance. In Greece, the Party had free access for some time to
 weapons produced in the neighboring satellites. The CP China is expected to provide arms
 and ammunition in quantity to the insurgents in Indochina when it can afford to do so, and may
 do the same for the Communists in Burma.
 89.  The Party may be able to buy some arms in the general black market and from
 corrupt Government troops. Communists in the Greek Army in the early stages of the in-
 surrection there furnished some arms to the guerrillas by deserting with as many weapons as
 they could carry. The CP Philippines hoped in the final stages of its revolution to be able to
 subvert Government troops and get them to bring over their heavy weapons for the Party.
 90.  One difficulty is that the colonial Party's arms are of many different sizes and
 types.. This means that ammunition supply is complicated and Communist fire-power often
 very limited. The CP Malaya set up armorers' shops in safe areas where disparate ammuni-
 tion could be refitted and weapons repaired. Bombs, mines, and general explosives are also
 manufactured by the Communists in safe areas. (The CP Philippines had a Technological
 Group of specialists at its headquarters for the production of such weapons.) The Party is
 sometimes able to establish arsenals across the frontier: for example, the Buljkes camp of
 the CP Greece; the Viet Minh forces in Indo-China were at one time reported to have had
 shops in Thailand.
 III. THE COMMUNIST RESISTANCE ORGANIZATION
 A. OBJECTIVES AND LIMITATIONS
 91.  Communist Parties in countries overrun by the Axis during the last War carried
 on military and political resistance to the occupation forces. The Communist aims were--
 (a) to render maximum assistance to the USSR by harassing her Axis enemies; (b) to strength-
 en the Party for the resumption of the class struggle in the postwar period. Tactically and
 organizationally, the Communist military resistance was similar to the Communist armed
 uprising in colonial countries. The Parties began fighting with limited Party membership and
 limited mass support. The Communist aim was to harass the enemy, not to overwhelm him,
 or even, in the first stages, to attack his forces directly. Fighting formations were generally
 small and were not closely controlled by a central headquarters in their operations. Guerrilla
 tactics.were used, and safe bases were established where possible.
 92.  The fighting resistance, begun by small forces, attracted numerous non-Commu-
 nists who were moved by patriotism. In some countries, the Communist Party rallied so
 many supporters and built up such a good military force that it was able to turn the resistance
 struggle into an armed insurrection after the Axis forces had been driven out. In other coun-
 tries, although unable to turn immediately to an insurrectionary effort, the Parties emerged
 from the resistance with greatly enhanced political prestige and with reserves of trained
 fighters who could be used in an insurrection when conditions became favorable.
 93.  Communist resistance was not exclusively military. The Parties also carried on
 political resistance and economic sabotage:
 Political resistance: agitation against the enemy; encouraging sabotage of occupation
 administration by passive non-cooperation and inhibiting cooperation on the part of
 those inclined to submit; stimulating minor political unrest--protest demonstrations,
 slow-down movements in production, violation of commodity control procedures.
 Economic Sabotage: organization of secret sabotage groups in productive centers,
 utilities, etc. to damage equipment, waste materials, cause snarls in production traffic,
 produce faulty materials, etc.

 Security Information
 Military Resistance: creation of a military force to make attacks on enemy forces,
 insta ations, and supply lines for purposes of weakening morale of occupation troops;
 to make it more difficult to realize full economic and military value of the occupation;
 to make it necessary for the enemy to divert forces to militarily unproductive duties,
 etc.; aid Allied armies by providing intelligence and limited tactical support.
 94.  In non-industrial countries, the Parties concentrated largely on military resist-
 ance. It was more profitable for them to do so, and terrain and other factors made it possi-
 ble to establish and hold the safe-bases necessary to substantial military operations.
 95.  In industrial countries the Communists divided their efforts among military,
 political, and economic resistance, not only because it was most profitable in political terms
 and in terms of how much it benefited the USSR, but also, because it was practically impos-
 sible to build up and hold areas safe enough and large enough for serious military operations.
 96.  It is difficult to gauge the actual effectiveness of Communist military resistance.
 There is no question but that the military and economic resistance carried out in France was
 of considerable help to the Western Allies, but it is impossible to say how much of this was
 owing to the Communists. The military resistance of the Soviet Partisans was probably of
 even more help to the Red Army: it kept large numbers of German troops busy in protecting
 duties, deprived the Germans of a large share of needed agricultural produce, interfered with
 German military communications, assisted the intelligence work of the Red Army and other
 Soviet agencies, and was of some use in direct tactical support of advancing Red Army forces
 when the Germans retreated.
 B. ORGANIZATION OF MILITARY RESISTANCE
 97.  In the countries where the Party concentrated on military resistance, the bulk of
 the Party was put on a military footing and a single or several safe-bases were organized.
 Offices of the political apparatus of the Party were transformed into central and area (mili-
 tary) staffs. Most of the fighting formations were composed of "regulars" (i.e., full-time
 guerrillas).
 98.  In occupied industrial countries, where military resistance was less exclusively
 the form of resistance engaged in, only a portion of the Party was put on a military footing
 and the remainder was employed in other forms of resistance action (political action, econo-
 mic sabotage). Fighting units were more often made up of "irregulars" (i.e., part-time
 fighters).
 99.  The =Party often carried on military resistance in the name of a "roof" organi-
 zation ("liberation front," etc.) which included forces of non-Communist organizations. The
 Party tried to get full control of such fronts. When it could not, it was sometimes obliged to
 accept general direction from the (non-Communist) headquarters of the organization (Italy),
 or it accepted only nominal direction, actually retaining full organizational and operational
 independence (e.g., the relationship of the FTPF of the CP France to the National Council of
 Resistance).
 100.   Initial military resistance complements were obtained in the following ways:
 a.  The Party set up organizing committees in the offices of the political
 apparatus to mobilize able Party members: assigned cadres to take command of
 military groups, arranged for arming them and sending them into military opera-
 tonal bases in the countryside (e.g., the "War Commissions" set up by the CP
 Yugoslavia on a national and on Regional and District levels).
 b.  The Party dispatched individual organizers and organizing teams to the field
 to take over already existing resistance formations (Greece, Italy).
 c.          Outside agencies sometimes assisted the Parties to set up and maintain mili-
 tary resistance forces:
 In the USSR, agents of the Party, Red Army, and State Security services
 stayed behind or were sent into occupied areas to organize fighting resistance
 units.

 Security Information
 In Malaya, the British and the Party cooperated to organize forces prior to
 the Japanese invasion, and the British Army later sent organizing iiTf  1
 nical advisory teams to aid the Communist guerrillas.
 101.     Some Parties (Yugoslavia, France, Italy) had a mobilizable nucleus of men who
 had fought in the Spanish Civil War. Considerable numbers of soldiers and officers of the
 state army defeated by the Axis also joined the Communist guerrilla forces in some countries
 (Yugoslavia in particular).
 102.  Parties that had had considerable experience in underground operations (France,
 Yugoslavia, Greece) had some advantage over non-Communist organizations in establishing
 their first resistance bands. The non-Communists, particularly in France, were more dis-
 turbed by the repressive measures taken by the occupying forces. The Communist Party,
 which already had workable secret communications lines, contacts, safehouses, and cadres
 who know how to work effectively and still preserve their own freedom, was able to establish
 active guerrilla bands as soon as its policy made it profitable to do so. On the other hand,
 in Italy, where the Party had been thoroughly repressed for years, it had not been able to
 preserve its cadres and may have been unable to organize a central resistance staff independ-
 ent of non-Communist organizations.
 103.  Additional recruits were obtained by the organizational and propaganda efforts of
 underground political organs of the Party and the political resistance fronts established by it;
 by the actions of the fighting units themselves; and by getting control of spontaneously formed
 groups and of those organized by non-Communists. The CP France, for example, published
 instructions to patriotic youths to form their own groups and carry on actions that would
 quickly get the attention of regular FTPF cadres, who would then get in touch with the new
 bands. One strong reason why the Party was always anxious to obtain supplies from the
 Allies was the fact that deguate ar a jpents and other_ supplies were a good recruitirng_a   -
 ment.
 C. STAFFS
 104.  The Party created staffs to control and give technical support to the combat for-
 mations. Tactical formations had their own command staffs, and staffs were organized on an
 area basis also, to coordinate the operations of tactical formation's within the area. Staffs
 were manned by Party members as far as possible, but non-Communists were also utilized in
 tactical command positions, under close political supervision of Party cadres. In countries
 where the Party concentrated rather exclusively on military resistance, regular organs (com-
 mittees and working offices of committees) of the political apparatus were converted into
 military staffs; for example, the Political Bureau, or a part of it, became a General Head-
 quarters, while a Regional Committee would transform itself into a regional military staff.
 In France, a central Staff and various lower area staffs were organized parallel to the politi-
 cal apparatus, which was retained, but independent of it below the Inter-Region (7) level. It is
 possible that a similar practice was followed by the Party in other countries where the re-
 sistance effort was divided among political, military, and economic resistance activities.
 The organizational pattern should not be viewed as having been mechanically applied by the
 Party. The political apparatus of the Party continued to exist, trimmed down to underground
 operations, in areas held by the enemy even in countries where the military resistance was by
 far the most important effort of the Party. Committees of the political apparatus that were
 converted to military staff duties were sometimes revamped prior to the conversion, with a
 view. to the most efficient utilization of specialist cadres: men were assigned and reassigned
 according to their talents and the military needs of the moment. Special organizing commit-
 tees were sometimes created by higher headquarters of the Party's political apparatus to go
 to an area and instruct the area committee in the setting up of military staffs and to super-
 vise personnel selections made by the area committee. In at least one case (Philippines), the
 headquarters of the military resistance was set up and manned by a regional committee of the
 Party, the reason being that that particular regional committee (Central Luzon Committee)
 had assumed the leadership of the whole Party when the members of the normal headquarters
 organ were arrested by the Japanese.
 105.  Communist resistance staffs had approximately the same composition as Commu-
 nist insurrectionary staffs in colonial countries. Technical services were represented in the
 General Headquarters and in lower area staffs, and in the case of large, safely-based forces,

 in higher tactical command staffs (Division, Brigade) as well. Political Commissars were
 customarily attached to area and larger tactical command staffs. A typical General Head-
 quarters, duplicated in most respects by higher area staffs, would have the following com-
 positon:
 Commander
 Political Commissar
 Vice-Commander
 Supply Officer
 Communications Officer
 Intelligence Officer
 Ordnance Officer
 Administrative Officer
 Medical Officer
 D. TACTICAL FORMATIONS
 106.   The size, shape, and articulation of military units used tactically depended upon
 particular missions, capabilities of the military resistance as a whole, and the degree to
 which the Party concentrated its efforts on the military resistance form. In countries where
 military resistance was most important and safe bases had been established, Brigades and
 even Divisions were employed. In France, on the other hand, most attacks were made by
 squads and platoons. In general, enemy strength being what it was, it was found impractical
 to try to use elements larger than a Brigade in a tactical operation. The Hualahaps of the
 CP Philippines, for example, suffered a devastating loss when they concentrated large
 numbers in a single area where the Japanese found it profitable to attack in force and to em-
 ploy aircraft against them. Even when relatively large units were used in an operation, it was
 customary to stick to guerrilla tactics, and the effect was more that of a number of small
 .units taking part in the operation under fairly loose control, rather than of a closely coordi-
 nated action of an orthodox large unit.
 107.  As in the Communist colonial insurrection, there were both "regular" (full-time)
 and "irregular" (part-time) units in the Communist resistance armies. In the FTPF in
 France, for example, the "francs-tireurs" were people who lived outwardly peaceful lives in
 the villages and towns and who came together on call to carry out operations, returning to
 their homes when the mission was completed. The "partisans," on the other hand, were
 people who lived in small camps in the woods and who were full-time guerrillas. The Chi-
 nese Communists organized both full-time resistance forces and "irregulars" (the People's
 Militia, which furnished intelligence to the regular units, did sentry duty, acted as guides and
 stretcher bearers for the regulars, and carried out harassing operations against isolated
 Japanese strong-points). The seizure and maintenance of a safe base does not mean the end
 of recruitment and utilization of irregular forces in areas under full or partial enemy control:
 the Yugoslav Partisans continued to raise part-time detachments outside the safe-base area
 for harassing operations at the same time that their regular units were making larger attacks
 out of the safe base. Irregular units were often organized for defense, as well as support
 functions: the SAP's in Italy and the People's Militia in China stood guard while farmers
 brought in their crops for the resistance; the Soviet Partisans also organized self-defense
 groups among the peasants for the same purpose. In France, the Party organized armed de-
 fense groups within the organizations of the political apparatus itself to protect demonstrators.
 secret installations (headquarters, safe houses, printing plants, etc.) in an attempt to relieve
 the FTPF military formations of such tasks.
 108.  Party Control of Tactical Units. The Communists tried to draw as many people as
 possible into t eir military resistance 1n-many cases this meant that the ranks of the tactical
 formations were predominantly non-Communist. A control problem existed. Even in coun-
 tries where the Party was large, as in France, it has difficulty finding sufficient reliable
 cadres to take command assignments. In some countries it was necessary to put non-
 Communists in charge of large tactical formations and even on important staffs. Wherever
 possible, Communists with military talents or experience were given command assignments,
 but sheer military necessity dictated the utilization of able non-Communist military personnel
 to the fullest extent.

 SECRET CONTROL /U.S. OFFICIALS ONLY
 Security Information
 109.  Control was exercised in the resistance force by the same methods as in the
 Communist colonial insurrection: reliable Party members were put in charge of central and
 area staffs which perforce? often contained some non-Communists; Political Commissars
 were assigned to tactical formations as a check on the military commanders; an effort was
 made to indoctrinate the non-Communists in Communist principles. It is interesting to note
 that the Communist revolutionary line was deliberately played down in the Soviet Partisans,
 while patriotism was played up: this may have been the case in other Communist military
 resistance forces also, but probably to a lesser extent.l
 110.  Local committees of the underground political apparatus of the Party in areas of
 resistance-fighting had a share in the direction of resistance formations. Details on this
 relationship are lacking, but It is believed that underground political functionaries often as-
 signed tactical missions to the resistance formations, took part in operational planning with
 the military staffs, and when communications between the latter and higher military head-
 quarters were broken, exercised general control over the units (see Soviet Partisans).
 111.  The tightness of centralized control varied from one country to another. Commu-
 nications, availability of Party cadres, and the existence of an underground political apparatus
 determined the extent of centralization of control. The development of the Soviet Partisans,
 for example, illustrates the variations: they began with small isolated units under the in-
 dependent control of individual commanders (Red Army stragglers, "stay-behind" or infil-.
 trated agents of the Soviet Government or CP); gradually banded together into "Partisan
 Unions," which established communications with other groups and with the Soviet authorities
 in unoccupied countries, but which did not act as tactical units; eventually came under the
 control of a central staff for the Partisan forces, through area staffs set up in unoccupied
 sectors of the front; and in the final stages, during the Red Army offensive, were utilized in
 direct support of Red Army commands and then incorporated into the Red Army as it swept
 forward.
 112.  Conversely, in Italy, where cadres were scarce and the political apparatus of the
 Party within the country sketchy at best, the Communist resistance forces appear to have
 been unable to establish a centralized direction under strict Party control and were dependent
 upon Allied command-communications nets for their direction.
 113.  Some provision was undoubtedly made for the coordinated direction of formations
 created, to handle special assignments (intelligence squads and nets, terror squads, industrial
 sabotage groups, etc.). In the FTPF, control of these groups was in the hands of the Political
 Commissar of the Inter-Regional FTPF staff. In the Yugoslav Partisans, the underground
 organs of the political apparatus in German-held areas controlled such special groups, while
 others were directed by the intelligence service of the Partisan organization. In the USSR,
 headquarters of several governmental agencies (NKVD, NKGB, NKO) controlled some of them,
 while the political apparatus of the Party may have controlled others.
 E. ORGANIZATION OF SPECIALIZED UNITS
 114.  The groups organized for special duties were created and controlled by the Com-
 munist military resistance organization directly, by underground organs of the political ap-
 paratus in enemy-held areas, by auxiliaries and fronts of the Party, and, in the case of the
 USSR, by agencies of the government.
 The FTPF in France had its own specialist squads (Grow es Speciaux for documenta-
 tion, sabotage, assassinations, reinforcements) and services (a service for receiving and
 caching materiel parachuted by the Allies, an intelligence service, and a technical apparatus
 for making and caching materiel).
 In Yugoslavia, an intelligence service was set up under the Central Committee of the
 Party. It operated in liberated areas as a security service independent of the military formation,
 "information centers" within the formations, and sent intelligence teams behind enemy lines.
 1 The Vichy Police remarked that many people were involved in Front National activities
 without knowing that it was a Communist organization: the same situation may have existed
 in the FTPF.

 The Partisan commands also sent reconnaissance teams (five-man groups called "petorkas")
 across the lines for tactical intelligence. The underground political apparatus of the Party in
 German-held areas also organized small sabotage and terror squads.
 In Italy, the terror squads called GAPS's (r_ uppo Azione Patriotico) were organ-
 ized, ized, but it is not known whether they were under the control of nearby partisan (Garibaldi)
 formations or some other directing apparatus.
 The CP Malaya organized Mobile Killer Squads (LTT's) during the Japanese occupa-
 tion, but, as in the case of Italy, it is not known exactly how these terror groups were con-
 trolled. (It may be guessed that the underground organizations of the political apparatus con-
 trolled them, for the Party had not been suppressed in Malaya to the extent that it had in
 Italy, and it had a considerable network of underground Party organizations and fronts from
 which to draw recruits and maintain coordinating communications.)
 F. SERVICE FUNCTIONS
 115.  The Communists organized supporting functions for their military resistance
 formations; Intelligence, Communications, Supply.
 116.  Intelligence. The Communist resistance forces needed tactical information on
 the enemy for their own defense and for tactical planning, just as do the insurrectionary
 forces in colonial countries. In the case of resistance, however, two additional factors in-
 fluenced the extent to which the Communists engaged in and organized intelligence services:
 (a) information of no immediate. tactical value to the resistance was valuable to the Allies
 during the war, and to a certain extent, was systematically obtained and transmitted to them,
 (b) in industrial countries, such-as France, the Communist resistance needed economic,
 political, administrative, and technological information to carry on rational political and eco-
 nomic resistance operations. For these reasons, extensive intelligence systems were organ-
 ized by the resistance armies or other Communist organizations. The Allies sent liaison
 teams into many countries to assist the Communist resistance and to receive its intelligence
 product.
 117.  Tactical Intelligence. For the production of purely military tactical intelligence,
 the Communist forces organized. reconnaissance teams and set up chains of informants in the
 countryside and a system of reporting places. The Party tried to "saturate" the area of op-
 erations with civilian reporters, utilizing all political organizations at its disposal. For
 practical purposes, this sort of intelligence collection for resistance operations was similar
 to that in postwar colonial insurrections.
 118.  Non-tactical Intelligence. For the production of industrial, economic, political,
 and strategic military intelligence, the Communists often organized special intelligence serv-
 ices, consisting of secret agents and informants in key places. Thus, the People's Commis-
 sariat for State Security (NKGB) of the USSR dispatched agents into enemy-occupied areas to
 set up networks for the collection of strategic intelligence. This was in addition to the regu-
 lar intelligence service of the Partisan military forces, the "Intelligence Administration" (RU)
 of the central Partisan staff and the "Intelligence Sections" (RO's) of lower Partisan staffs
 down to Brigade level. The latter produced intelligence of immediate utility, but also furnish-
 ed information of value to the higher agencies of the Soviet Government, and this was trans-
 mitted by radio and other means across enemy lines to the interested agency.
 119.  It has been alleged by the French Communists that their resistance intelligence
 service ("Service B") furnished strategic intelligence of considerable value to the Allies.
 The validity of this claim may be questioned, but it is certainly true that the French Party had
 numerous channels open to it for the obtaining of such information. For example, a detailed
 "Questionnaire" was prepared by the CP France for information on production and lay-out of
 French chemical factories. Party members, sympathizers, members of the political resist-
 ance organizations collected such information directly or from their friends, and put it into
 Party channels.
 120.   The Communists had especially favorable opportunities for penetration of state
 and enemy agencies during the resistance period, because the Germans had to employ large
 numbers of the local people as interpreters and to carry on administrative and policing work.

 The Soviets made considerable use of this situation, sending agents disguised as anti-Soviets
 into the various offices of the occupation authority, labor services, production control offices,
 etc. The French Communists also achieved some success in this regard: Vichy police re-
 cords contain many cases of policemen arrested for Communist activities.
 121.  In Yugoslavia, the Partisan intelligence service gradually took over political se-
 curity functions in liberated areas, and even beofr-ethe Germans had evacuated the country,
 was transformed into a state secret political police organization, later known as OZNA.
 122.  Communications. Communist resistance forces relied heavily upon couriers for
 communications. Regular courier services were organized, either by the political apparatus
 or the military force itself. The best supplied organizations had extensive radio and some-
 times telephone nets. The Allies provided the equipment for communications abroad with the
 liaison teams they despatched to the resistance organizations. The Soviet Partisans had reg-
 ular radio communications with each other and with the Partisan staffs on the Soviet side of
 the lines. They also sent messages across the line by dog, pigeon, courier, and airplane.
 The Communists were sometimes able to capture enemy communications equipment and put
 it to use: the Chinese, for example, had radio and land-line networks consisting largely of
 captured equipment.
 123.  Supplies. In "backward" countries, where the Communists concentrated on mili-
 tary resistance, they supplied their units in much the same way as they have been doing in
 the colonial insurrections: by foraging and contributions (voluntary or extorted) by civilians,
 and by capture of enemy supplies. The Allies furnished several of the Communist resistance
 organizations by parachute drops and coastal smuggling. The Soviet government even landed
 planes loaded with all sorts of supplies (ordnance, technical equipment, clothing, morale-
 building items) in Partisan-held areas in the USSR. In some cases, the resistance forces
 obtained weapons and other supplies abandoned by the defeated state armies (the British in
 Malaya, the Americans in the Philippines).
 124.  It was customary for the Communists to set up secret weapons - producing and
 repair shops. In backward countries, these were located within the safe-base area. In
 France, the FTPF had special groups responsible for making arms, explosives, etc. in safe
 houses and for caching them. The French Communists were also able to get civilian labora-
 tories to secretly manufacture explosives, mines, booby-traps, etc.
 G. POST-LIBERATION DISPOSITION OF MILITARY RESISTANCE STRENGTH
 125.  The Communist Parties did not neglect to consider the possibilities their resist-
 ance forces offered for action when the enemy should be defeated. In Yugoslavia, Greece,
 Philippines, and the USSR, the Communist forces began military attacks on anti-Communist
 resistance forces even before the Axis troops had been driven out of the country. In some
 cases, these operations were comparatively small; in others, they represented clear attempts
 by the Party to leave itself an open field for a revolution, and were quite bloody. The Yugo-
 slav Partisans, backed up by the Soviet Army, were able to complete this monopolization of
 military power and to take over the government. The Greek resistance force (ELAS) also
 systematically began to attack rival resistance organizations before the liberation, and was in
 an excellent position to seize the government power when the Germans evacuated: such an
 attempt was made shortly after the liberation, but was frustrated by the forceful presence
 and action of British troops.
 126.  During the liberation campaign, many of the Parties tried to complement their
 regular military resistance operations by creating "people's militia" which were intended to
 seize local civil administrations as soon as the enemy had abandoned them. In most countries
 these Party-inspired, self-appointed police carried on brutal reprisals against people who had
 collaborated with the enemy, or whom the Communists considered dangerous and therefore
 liquidated under the pretex of "collaborationism." In some countries, the Communist attempts
 were quickly frustrated as Allied forces moved in in strength and liquidated the local admini-
 strations. The forces liberating Paris encountered difficulties with the Communist "militia"
 that would have been much more serious had it not been for the fact that the Allied military
 campaign had been so rapid and the Communist unable to make adequate preparations, and
 that the non-Communist resistance organizations managed to command sufficient public sup-
 port.

 As in Yugoslavia, the Chinese Communists resumed their revolutionary campaign
 ccessfully when the enemy had been driven out. In China, the occupation of Manchuria by
 oviet forces checked the possibility of the Nationalist Government's re-occupying that area
 and gave the Communists a decisive material advantage in the ensuing revolutionary cam-
 paign.
 128.     In countries where the Communist resistance forces were faced with Allied oc-
 cupation, rather than Soviet, the Parties did what they could to preserve their military
 strength for possible future use in revolution. The CP Philippines managed to retain the
 cadres of its Hukbalahap in small guerrilla bands in the mountains. The CP Greece, having
 failed in its insurrection following the liberation, began shipping as many of its resistance
 fighters as possible to camps established in the mountains and in the neighboring "New De-
 mocracies." In France, Italy, and Malaya, the Parties enrolled as many of its fighters as
 possible in controlled veterans' associations. Wherever possible, the Communists hid their
 best arms away for future use.
 129.  The resistance veterans' associations represent a major portion of the Commu-
 nist military reserves. In Malaya, the association was utilized by the Party to mobilize the
 forces for the insurrection that began in 1948. In Italy, the Party-controlled veterans asso-
 ciation, ANPI, has been a major factor in the general political strength of the Party; has been
 utilized to spark Communist demonstrations, and its offices have been used as contact places
 for Communist strong-arm elements. The local para-military organizations, such as the
 Garibaldi Clubs, that made their existence felt during the unrest following the elections of
 1948 and the attempted assassination of Togliatti, were recruited from ANPI members, and
 ANPI may be used systema1icahy"as cover -for their activities.
 H. USE OF RESISTANCE BANDS IN KOREAN WAR.
 130.  The pattern of organization for Communist resistance forces has been followed in
 the use of Communist guerrilla units in South Korea. To their use, however, has been added
 another function: support of an invading Communist army. In deployment they most closely
 resemble the resistance operations of the Chinese Communist Party, which is natural, in view
 of the probable training of Korean Communists with the CCP forces. It has been estimated
 that a_cadre of 1700 trained2ersonnel provided the hard core for the South Korean Guerrilla
 forces, which in January 1951 reached a peak of 37,500. South Korean guerrilla units can be
 classified into four broad categories, according to their functions:
 a.  specially organized and trained personnel infiltrated individually or as small
 units;
 b.  irregular county and other local volunteer groups;
 c.  stragglers and remnants of the North Korean Army cut off from the main
 body and forced to resort to guerrilla tactics for self-preservation.
 d.  professional bandit groups.
 131. The organization) structure of the guerrilla units is not known in any detail, al-
 though, as in all Communist resistance forces, it is probably very flexible. There is some
 evidence which indicates the possible existence of a 1st North Korean Guerrilla Corps of
 5-10 brigades, each with 10-20 battalions of approximately 100 men each. Other reports iden-
 tify three guerrilla brigades (the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd).
 132. The guerrilla units appear to be subordinated to the regular North Korean Army
 units when the latter is in an area in which the guerrillas exist. This is also similar to the
 Chinese pattern. Communications are believed to pass from the General Headquarters Staff
 of the North Korean People's Army, through the regular North Korean units and to the guer-
 rilla groups, although direct communication between the General Headquarters and the guer-
 rilla formation is not unusual.
 133.  In most other respects, the guerrilla operations in South Korea were standard --
 their missions and tactics were similar to those in other colonial resistance operations, their
 arms supply depended on capture of enemy equipment: as could be expected, only 30-40% of the
 forces were equipped with arms, and supplies were either, captured, requisitioned or plundered.

 134. It is significant that immediately prior to the North Korean invasion the activity
 of the South Korean guerrillas showed a marked decrease, possibly the result of a "lie-low"
 signal from North Korean General Headquarters.
 IV. COMMUNIST CITY INSURRECTION
 A. MAIN FEATURES OF THE PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION
 135. Differences between the Proletarian and Colonial Revolutions. The Communist
 revolution in an advanced industrial country differs radically from the revolution in a colonial
 country:
 a.  The class on which the Party depends for the mass of the revolution is the
 class of city workers (proletariat).
 b.  The regime in industrial countries is technically much stronger than in colo-
 nial countries: it possesses strong, maneuverable, and experienced military
 forces and a comprehensive police system; it commands transport and communi-
 cations facilities and can swiftly shift its forces about to squash uprisings as they
 occur.
 c.  For these reasons, the Qtrate y of the Communists in advanced countries is
 the  verse of the colonial strategy: armed action is not undertaken in the be-
 ginning of the revolution as a means of expanding the limited political basis, and
 weakening the enemy by attrition, but is rather, the climax of a period of political
 and organizational preparation.
 d.  The proletarian revolution consists of, first, the maximal organizational
 build-up of the Communist Party and the accumulation of preponderant mass sup-
 port; and then, the conversion of this support to an armed uprising in which the
 places and institutions of power are seized and the regime defeated at once.
 136.  Success in the armed insurrection depends upon many factors, the most important
 being --
 a.  Favorable "objective conditions;" producing mass support for the Party and
 weakening the authority and power of the regime: economic dislocations (unem-
 ployment, inflation, disruption of supply system), political frictions (inability of
 non-Communist parties to agree on remedies of problems, factionalism within
 parties and government), break down of general morale (cynicism, corruption,
 defeats in war, continual pressures from abroad).
 b.  Preponderant political strength of the Communist Party: numerically strong
 mass following; or relatively small following, but neutralization of regime's
 political support.
 c.  Extent to which masses are convinced that a real revolution is possible and
 are willing to support it (not merely general discontent which could be satisfied
 by reforms). This is the measure of the effectiveness of Communist propaganda.
 It involves "isolating" and "discrediting" the previously accepted leaders of the
 regime and its parties and workers organizations supporting it; "exposing" all of
 them as enemies of the workers and as plotting to deprive the workers of their
 just rewards; setting up the Party as the only true and consistent champion of the
 class; and convincing the workers that only through a revolution can the evils be
 abolished.
 d.  Extent to which the secret Party organization within the government's defen-
 sive forces has succeeded in subverting them--in neutralizing them or getting
 them to come out in active support of the uprising.

 e.  The large number of places (targets of the insurrection) that the Party is
 capable of taking in a present-day advanced country. In addition to the above pri-
 mary operations, armed groups will have also to carry out many secondary op-

 tives (e.g., bridges, key buildings, intersections, etc.). Schematically, the targets
 of military insurrectionary operations might be shown as follows:

 Security Information
 137.  It is difficult to say how the CP weighs these factors relative to each other when
 it is making the decision for an insurrection. Outstanding advantage in one respect may per-
 mit the Party to go ahead when other advantages are lacking. However, the numerical
 strength of the Party is seemingly considered less important than the others: if this were not
 so, the CP's France and Italy would probably have carried out insurrectionary attempts in
 the postwar period. It is also unlikely that a Party would begin an uprising in these times
 without having gone far in the work of subverting the government's defensive forces. If any
 generalized conclusion can be drawn, it is that the Party is probably more influenced by the
 weakness it sees in the regime (including the effects of systematic subversion by the Com-
 munists) than it is by the "revolutionary fervor of the masses" or by the number. of armed
 units it is able to muster.
 The Party has no magic calculator to produce completely accurate estimates of any of
 these factors. Its success rests upon the ability of the top leadership, which makes the de-
 cision, which is just as prone to miscalculation as are non-Marxists, and which can fumble a
 revolution when the odds are in the Party's favor, or can achieve success against adverse
 conditions.
 138.  The degree to which the Party is able to meet these requirements for success
 depends upon the preparations it makes prior to the insurrection. In periods of social stabil-
 ity the Party makes long-range general preparations by way of developing its organizational
 discipline, giving its cadres practical experience in general mass political and organizing
 work (including the handling of large groups of people in demonstrations, etc.), training
 specialists in insurrectionary tactics, etc., and by way of planting its organization in places
 of strategic and tactical importance to the insurrection (key factories and plants, arsenals,
 warehouses, communications centers and facilities, -etc.). When social conditions become
 unstable, these long-range preparations begin to pay off: the disciplined apparatus is in a
 position to exploit difficulties to best advantage and to organize the workers into revolutionary
 formations.
 139.  Specific practical preparations for the insurrection are made also during the
 period of "revolutionary calm" and are stepped up In the period of instability. These include
 the selection and assignment of cadres to secret insurrectionary planning and subversion
 staffs and to skeleton military formations. Practical preparations will be discussed in
 further detail.
 B. ORGANIZATION OF MASS SUPPORT
 140.  Accumulation of mass support, with emphasis on the workers, is the continuing
 occupation of the Party. In a "revolutionary situation, " the organizational groundwork laid
 down begins to pay off--the Party organizations in factories and trade unions are able - to win
 additional workers and are able to get control of workers' organizations. This, however, is
 not enough. The success of the insurrection hinges upon the organization of political support
 for the CP on the. broadest possible basis.
 141.  To secure maximum support for the uprising, therefore, the Party will make use
 of some broad outside (front) organization- -one that musters other classes (peasants, lower
 middle class) and that provides the Party with a headquarters that can be set up as a revolu-
 tionary government if necessary. It may be an organization already in existence that the
 Party has penetrated and got under its control (e.g., the Soviets in Russia), or a front organi-
 zation created by the Party in non-revolutionary times, or one especially inverted for the in-
 surrection (e.g., the A.N.L. in Brazil, 1935). Through such an organization the CP can at
 once broaden and conceal its revolutionary appeal.
 The ultimate is the seizure of power in the name .of government itself, which is what
 happened in Czechoslovakia. (The Party and its controlled central labor union demanded
 nationalization of all industries and direct labor participation in the Government. Non-
 Communist Ministers made the terrible blunder of resigning in protest, and the Communist
 Ministers simply prevented their return and forced substitution of dupes and fellow-travellers.)

 142.  Ideally, a usable extra-Party mass organization for the uprising would have these
 characteristics:
 a.  Broad appeal: capable of assimilating wide sections of the population, cutting
 across local and class partitions;
 b.  Appearance of legitimacy: the workers can be convinced that. the front is the
 rightful authority (e.g., the position of the soviets in Russia in 1917);
 c.  Strategic coverage: the front commands support in the main cities,. parti-
 cularly in the capital;
 d.  Effective Party control over the headquarters and lower organs of the front;
 e.  Revolutionary aura: the front orginated in a revolutionary movement (e.g.,
 the soviets arose during the February Revolution).
 143. Party Control. Establishment of effective Party control over the mass revolu-
 tionary.organization is done from below or from above; the Party wins control over an al-
 ready existing organization or creates one under its initial control. The Bolsheviks, for ex-
 ample, got control of the workers', soviets by winning individual factories and being elected
 by the workers as representatives to the soviet, first in the workers' districts, and then in
 the major cities. The role of the Party during the resistance was very important in many
 countries in securing for it control of the workers' organizations (particularly, of the leading
 trade union federations in Italy and France).
 144.  Propaganda Support. The campaign to get control of the mass organizatio
 supported by the propaganda tactics of the Party. In the period of instability the pro  gan a
 line is revolutionary in two respects; (a) it is fundamentally and clearly hostile to th
 ing social system and its government; (b) it is distinctly hostile to the parties and organi-
 zations competing with the CP for the workers' allegiance. The attack on the regime consists
 of setting up the utopian program of the Party; making demands for "reforms" that are im-
 possible under existing conditions or that would lead to the weakening or dereliction of power
 by the government, making open -demands for a revolution.
 The attack on individual rival political parties and their leaders and policies are
 aimed at (a) causing them to break with the regime; or (b) to go further to the Right, thereby
 "exposing" their "real" anti-labor sentiments; or (c) to make concessions further destructive
 of the economy and political stability of the country.
 145.  Slogans. The propaganda campaign is carried on by the Communist press, by
 agitation teams, calling of meetings, demonstrations, strikes, etc. The appeal is put out in
 slogans that have vital appeal to fundamental desires of the workers ("peace," higher wages,
 privileges for the workers, lower prices, abolition of wage controls, workers control of in-
 dustry, production and distribution, or a greater share in economic decisions etc.)
 146.  Testing the Mass Temper. During the developing revolutionary situation the
 temper of the masses is tested and raised by leading the workers into actions progressively
 more challenging to the regime: demonstrations, small strikes, larger strikes, particularly
 sit-down strikes, which give the workers a taste of taking a portion of power (property);
 armed demonstrations and riots; finally, the general strike.
 147.  The General Strike. The Party need not specifically call for a general strike, but
 it will always produce an equivalent when it tries an insurrection. (The Bolsheviks did not
 call a general strike, in 1917, but the effect was the same: the insurrection itself closed
 down all the factories). The leader of the CP Germany, Brandler, called off the projected
 1923 revolution when he failed to get socialist support for a general strike. The CP Brazil
 failed in its 1935 attempt partly because it was unable to produce a widestrike movement.
 In tactical terms, a general strike or its equivalent has the following effects:
 a.  It brings workers out of plants and into streets: causes confusion, impedes
 police action, etc.;

 b.  Organized insurrectionary forces are given an opportunity to act on the un-
 organized workers, who are at loose ends;
 c.  Strike action at key plants is used to spark insurrectionary seizure of plants;
 d.  Strikes give Party a chance to observe government countermeasures (effec-
 tiveness and weak spots) in action and make appropriate changes in plans and
 organization and in tactics;
 148.  A general strike movement may be undertaken without positive preponderant
 workers control. (See,, for example, the October 1950 strike movement of the CP Austria.)
 In some cases, a general strike may be called primarily as a test, but with the idea that if it
 goes well, the movement will be carried forward to an insurrection. The ability of the Party
 to carry the movement just so far, without going over into a premature uprising or without
 causing serious setbacks for the revolutionary temper, is dependent upon a variety of factors
 (extent of control, general temper, astuteness of CP strike leaders, capabilities of govern-
 ment, etc.)
 149.  The General Task. It is necessary at the time of the uprising to translate the
 general mass political support- -expressed in elections, strike movements, demonstrations,
 etc.--into military form: the conversion of political organizations into military organizations,
 the integration of masses into the skeleton military apparatus of the Party, and arming them.
 The process will be described in more detail below.
 C. SUBVERTING THE DEFENSES OF THE GOVERNMENT
 150.  The armed security services of the government are not insulated from the general
 situation. The political and organizing work carried on by the Party among the workers is
 supplemented by work carried on to defect the soldiers, police, sailors, genarmerie, etc.
 from support of the government. It has long been understood by Communist theorists that the
 armed. state services will have to be neutralized before the insurrection begins, for the
 forces of the workers will be numerically and technically much inferior to those of the state.
 The work of neutralizing- -either achieving an actual neutrality of the state arms, or winning
 them over to active participation in the insurrection- -is achieved by: building up a Party
 organization within the services (as in Russia and Brazil) or getting control of the government
 offices in charge of them (as in Czechoslovakia).
 151.        "Military Work." The building up of a Party organization in the armed and secu-
 rity services has been a requirement for all Parties for many years. One of the "21 Condi-
 tions" for admission to the Comintern specified that the Parties do this work, and later i    -
 national resolutions and writings emphasized its importance. It is called "Military work
 is discussed in some detail in Section V below. The following are, briefly, the essentials.
 a.  CP's establish an organ to direct penetration and subsequent organization in
 the state forces as part of the long-range preparations (i.e., in quite stable times).
 This organ is a small, secret body under top Party control and is often called the
 "military" or "anti-military committee," "commission," "section," or "depart-
 ment." The Communist youth organization is sometimes given responsibility for
 military work, and always plays some part in it.
 b.  Organizing work in particular military commands is carried out by Commu-
 nists who form secret cells and receive instructions from a responsible for the
 work connected with a lower civilian Party committee (i.e., state, regional, city,
 etc.);
 c.  The work of the organization consists of agitation and propaganda aimed at
 subverting the loyalty or confidence in the state of maximum numbers of troops.
 At the time of the insurrection, where the work has been effective, the Party
 organization will seize command of the unit and hold it to the insurrectionary con-
 trol or cause mutinies and partial refusals to obey or to carry out anti-revolu-
 tionary operations effectively;

 d.  the military organization may also furnish operational intelligence and arms
 to the insurrection and, conversely, deprive loyal defensive forces of their arms.
 e.  In special circumstances, special non-Communist organizations may already
 exist, facilitating the defection of armed services masses in the same way as they
 do in the workers' centers (e.g., the fortuitous existence of the unit committees
 and soldiers' soviets in Russia.) These special organizations need only be cap-
 tured by the CP to become effective instruments of subversion.
 f . In periods of enhanced CP prestige and political strength     CP France in
 the immediate post-liberation period) the "subversion" can e( carried out openly
 through the activities of CP nuclei in armed and security forces, which may be
 organized into thinly disguised fronts.
 The effectiveness of military work in an insurrection was demonstrated in the Bol-
 shevik revolution in Petrograd, where all but 1-2,000 of the city army garrison was neutral-
 ize   Inadequate work was demonstrated in the Brazilian uprising of 1935.
 152.   The effect of penetration and subversion from above was clear in the Prague coup
 of 1948: the Army was neutralized by the Minister of Defense, a fellow-traveler; the bulk of
 the state police was neutralized, and some units were actually put at the service of the Party,
 by the Communist Minister of the Interior.
 D. MILITARY PREPARATIONS
 153.   Preparations for the military conduct of the insurrection consist of-
 of planning, tactical coordinating, and service organs; (b) creation, arming, and mobilizing ian
 insurrectionary force. The latter is discussed further below.
 154.   Planning Organs. The Party established an organ to make concrete plans for the
 insurrectionary operations--for assessing target installations and considering tactical ap-
 proaches and requirements for each; for locating assembly places, communications and staff
 centers; arms, ammunition, and transport centers, etc. In the early days, this was not done
 until a revolutionary situation had already developed and a decision had been made for the
 uprising. For example, the plans for the Petrograd insurrection of 1917 were not even begun
 to be made until less than a week beforehand; plans for operations in the 1923 German project
 were made during the summer, several weeks prior to the target date.
 From what evidence is available, it would appear that during recent years plans for
 uprisings are. being made well in advance. (See, for example, the premature operations car-
 ried out in Italy in 1948). Obviously, such plans could not be complete, for the course of actual
 events would determine many details; however, the main outlines could easily be worked out.
 155.  It appears that insurrectionary plans are made by, or in close connection with,
 the organ responsible for "military work" (subversion in the state services). Each major city
 would require an individual operational plan; what agency of the city Party organization is re-
 sponsible for'it is not known. As an h  otheis, the following is offered:
 a.  A specialist is designated or sent out to each major Party organization to col-
 lect data and draw up a tentative operational plan. This would undoubtedly entail
 discussions with certain functionaries, such as cadre (personnel) men, leaders of
 the city strong-arm squads and veterans' organizations, and leaders of city dis-
 trict organizations and trade union functionaries (particularly in industries im-
 portant to the success of the insurrection);
 b.  The tentative plans are sent to national Party headquarters, where they are
 considered, compared, criticized, modified by the Military Committee or com-
 parable body, and probably sent to the CP Soviet Union for approval of comment.
 c.  Final approved plans form the basis for stand-by assignment of cadre per-
 sonnel to various tactical and support staffs to be mobilized at the time of the up-
 rising.

 156.  Service Organization. A number of important functions must be provided for in
 the operational and organizational planning for the armed uprising: arms procurement, stor-
 age, and distribution; communications; transportation; intelligence.
 157.  The Arms Problem. Procurement, storage, and distribution of weapons in a
 country with an effective police force, is a complicated problem. The number and types of
 weapons needed depends upon so many factors (number of cities considered vital; number of
 target installations in each; size and character of defenses, etc.) that it is impossible to
 generalize. Obviously, the Party will want to arm every one of its fighters, but how many
 members of a fighting formation must be armed? Can the Party depend upon every man's
 furnishing his own weapon? Since this would probably be hazardous, how many weapons must
 be cached away for distribution at the beginning of the uprising? Is it better to have small
 caches or to have caches large enough to equip a given formation? These are some of the
 problems which the CP must consider.
 158. Sources of arms are --
 a.                         weapons belonging to individuals;
 b.  hand-made weapons (demolitions, Molotov Cocktails, etc.);
 c.  government and commercial stocks seized in the first stages of the uprising
 (by assault or from within);
 d.  disarming of enemy captured in the course of fighting;
 e.  distribution of weapons from secret Party caches (large quantities were ac-
 quired by many CP's during the resistance and were hidden away for future use);
 f . theft of weapons by Communist workmen (in warehouses, railroads, arsenals)
 and by Communist soldiers.
 159.  The Italian services have been turning up Communist arms deposits for some
 years. Most of the caches have been small (5-20 weapons); others have been large. In several
 cases, weapons and ammunition sufficient to equip over a hundred men have been discovered;
 many included automatic weapons, and small mortars, and some included disassembled can-
 nons'.
 160.  Choice of location of caches depends upon considerations of safety and convenience
 of control on the one hand, and of the use to which the weapons will be put on the other. For
 example, some of the Italian caches were in factories, for the use of the insurrectionary force
 eventually to seize the factory. Other caches have been in various places of safety and con-
 venience--in abandoned buildings in the country; in the grounds of a railroad station where the
 Communist station master hid them after stealing them from trains passing through.
 161.  Tactical considerations are undoubtedly important. The Italian authorities, for
 example, believe that caches were systematically made in factory grounds in the industrial
 areas of the North on the theory that the factories would serve as defensible bastions in an
 insurrection; whereas Party military strategists in other areas did not consider it possible
 to hold out in the factories and therefore did not establish large factory caches.
 162.  The CP Germany is the only Party known to have organized arms procurement and
 storage on a systematic basis. Plans for the 1923 uprising there included the organization of
 special weapons procurement committees in each of the regions of the country. Details of the
 implementation of this plan are lacking, but the project sounds very much like the "WUMBO'
 (Weapons and Munitions Procurement Office) which existed in the 1920's as a part of the I, g-
 ~eh,-r-r "Apparat." It is believed to have had a national chief, a number of regional chiefs,
 and under them, local groups in charge of collection and hiding arms.
 163.  It is generally believed on the basis of evidence so far available, that the arms
 problem in the period following the second war is handled locally: small caches entrusted to
 reliable Party men in a position to take care of them. If no individual functionary of the re-
 gional and national Party headquarters is specifically responsible for arms, it is, however,

 inconceivable that military planners at all levels of the Party would not take a close interest
 in data on weapons that will be immediately available from the secret caches.
 164.   There is always the possibility that arms may be smuggled into the country by
 sea or air drop from the USSR or satellites for a Party about to begin an insurrection. There
 have always been rumors about such smuggling, and they may be believed by rank and file
 Party members--may even be floated by the Party leaders to raise the temperature. Ruth
 Fischer (Stalin and German Communism) writes that the ranks of the _QP Germany.believed
 firmly that the Partvpossessed_lare hidden storesof arms and_t_hat large quantities would
 be sent in from Russia for the 1923uprisina. The rumors in this case were empty, and the
 more current ones have had no more demonstrated substance: the possibility cannot be en-
 tirely dismissed, however. As a tentative conclusion it appears that the USSR would supply
 arms only to CP's in adjacent territories, and would supply other CP's only in case of war.
 165.  Communications. An adequate communications system is essential to the success
 of the insurrection: to give the signal for the simultaneous uprising in all of the key cities
 and to coordinate operations thereafter.
 166.  The insurrectionary plan calls for the seizure in the first moments of the uprising
 of the principal existing communications--either by assault from outside, or by armed Com-
 munists working within them. First targets of attack are telephone exchanges, telegraph
 offices, radio transmitters, teletype lines: possession of these will provide the insurrection-
 ary headquarters with the means of coordinating all subsequent operations and will also de-
 prive the regime of vital service. (Extensive use of radio in present day police and army
 would lessen the effect of this to some extent: the government would not be so helpless as it
 was in Russia in 1917.)
 167.  Past failures (Brazil, Germany, and to a certain extent, in Russia) of preparations
 for communicating initial operational instructions by couriers and seized facilities show the
 importance of having a reliable Party communications system organized ahead of time. At
 least, there is some evidence that a CP would organize a W/T network in advance, consisting,
 for example, of a headquarters transmitter and a number of regional nets --
 Given the current availability of personnel with technical experience and easy access to radio
 equipment, such a network would not be difficult for a Party to establish. It would have to be
 tested occasionally, but not often and then, for periods short enough to escape locating efforts
 by the authorities. Such a network would be of particular value in giving the initial operational
 orders and would lessen difficulties arising from delay in seizing existing land-line and radio
 centers. It may be questioned, however, that all operations could be adequately handled by a
 pre-organized W/T system alone: other facilities would have to be captured.
 168.  The taking over of standard broadcasting stations and their utilization in issuing
 instructions and propaganda was an important factor in the Prague coup of 1948 and was easily
 accomplished by the Communist Minister of Information, who controlled them in the name of
 the government. A Communist high up in the post-telegraph-telephone administration (ordi-
 narily government-run in Europe) could perform a similar service for the Party.
 169.  The radio system of air fields would probably be an important target for the in-
 surrection. Party members infiltrated into the system could set up a nation-wide communi-
 cations network at the service of the Party and could work havoc with air transport by

 sabotaging electronic navigation systems. This could be particularly dangerous in countries
 where the government air force uses commercial fields and facilities.
 170.  It has been reported that one Party has considered the possibility of jamming
 government radio nets. It is not known whether the idea has been implemented, or even if it is
 feasible.
 171.  Intelligence. The regular Party organization as a whole is an information-
 producing network, and at the time of an uprising all Party members would furnish military
 intelligence from direct observation. In addition, various staff headquarters and fighting units
 would send out individuals on scouting missions. Also, more "professional" espionage sys-
 tems, consisting of secret penetration agents and informants, secure reporting facilities, and
 intelligence specialists are organized by many CP's in advanced countries in non-revolutionary
 times. These facilities would be of considerable value in an insurrection. Finally, there is
 some evidence that the Party at this time makes room in its insurrection plan for the assign-
 ment of military intelligence men to the insurrectionary staffs. It is possible that individuals
 in key installations are given stand-by assignments to constitute a comprehensive military
 intelligence network when the proper time arrives.
 172.  Transportation will be needed In the uprising. The revolutionary forces will com-
 mandeer whatever vehicles they can, and this is one reason why efforts are made to get con-
 trol of railroad workers' organizations, street car and bus unions. Advance preparations may
 consist of locating and planning the seizure of garages and motor pools, establishing Party
 transport services during non-revolutionary times, and convassing Party members to deter-
 mine how many vehicles of all types will be available at the time of the insurrection and
 making plans for their maximum utilization. The CP Italy, for one, has bought quantities of
 i  t u ycles and registered them in the name of individuals. During the period between the
 wars, many European CP's had bicycle and motorcycle clubs, which would be definite assets
 in an insurrec--lion. _
 173.  The CP Brazil in 1935 included plans for the seizure of government airplanes, and
 even in the more current theories of revolution in that country, now based on the colonial
 pattern, importance is laid on the capture of planes--a natural emphasis considering the over-
 land transport difficulties in Brazil.
 E.. THE INSURRECTION
 174.  In organizational terms, the tasks of the Party are--
 a.                       to mobilize, arm, and deploy the insurrectionary formations at the optimum
 time;
 b.  to establish headquarters where needed for the coordination of operations;
 c.  to activate the subversion apparatus within the state services.
 175.  Timing. There is little that can be said about timing beyond the fact that the up-
 rising should be begun when Party forces are at peak strength, the workers are most ready
 to come out, and the strength and morale of the regime are at low ebb. The CP cannot achieve
 a "surprise" insurrection, but it can achieve partial surprise in the matter of the exact date.
 A recognizable crisis is desirable, particularly if the Party can wring a claim of self-defense
 out of it. Therefore, in both Czechoslovakia and Russia, first action followed a crisis pre-
 cipitated by the Party itself. In Czechoslovakia, it was simply a cabinet crisis, provoked by
 the Party. In Russia, there were several crises, the most important being: first, the engi-
 neered refusal of the Petrograd soviet to permit the Government to send garrison troops to
 the Front; second, the systematic usurpation of authority by Bolshevik Commissars sent to
 garrison commands and government agencies (utilities, bank, etc.). The latter finally pro-
 duced government countermeasures, which the Party was able to seize upon. as "proof' of a
 "plot" to overthrow the workers' soviets. The call was made for general mobilization to
 "defend" the revolution.

 176.  Mobilization of the Party. Party members capable of bearing arms are organized
 into fighting formations, with the exception of the cadres posted to various tactical head-
 quarters. Women and others not fit for combat in the streets are assigned to support func-
 tions--courier, scouting, driving, distributing weapons, agitating, answering telephones, first
 aid, etc. Leaders will have been given specific posts--to take command of a fighting unit, to
 lead the workers in a railroad station in its seizure, to work on the staffs, etc. Assembly
 points will have been previously designated for the mustering of military formations and they
 will be given missions by their commanders upon assembling. (In some cases, it will have
 been possible for certain units to have rehearsed their individual operation unobtrusively
 beforehand). The signal for the uprising is given in various ways--a radio broadcast, des-
 patching of couriers, a telephone call, a pre-arranged signal (e.g., calling of a general strike;
 anticipated action of the government; a given date and time).
 177.  Establishment of Coordinating Headquarters. It is probable that following the
 pattern of the Bolshevik Revolution, selected cadres are assigned in advance of the uprising
 to establish various headquarters. The national Military Committee or its equivalent is be-
 lieved to be the organ that will establish itself as the national "general staff." If a different
 organ is created, it will probably include some of the members of the Military Committee,
 along with the top political leaders of the Party. In the capital city, the national insurrection-
 ary headquarters will probably take over local operations, either working through the Party's
 city committee or utilizing it. Comparable headquarters will be set up in every city in which
 it is planned to raise a rebellion, and insurrectionary centers will be established in the var-
 ious sections of each city, particularly in the workers' districts. These lower headquarters
 may consist simply of the city district committees of the Party on a military footing, or a
 section of it, and special persons may have been previously designated to take command as is
 the case in the national headquarters. Reserve headquarters may be organized to take over
 in case the regular headquarters are captured, and field headquarters may be established to
 direct particular important operations.
 178.  Composition of Headquarters. The official account of the Bolshevik Revolution,
 which was the model for Communist Revolutions, states that the insurrection in Petrograd
 was controlled by a "Party Center" supervising the work of a military general staff embedded
 in the revolutionary headquarters of the mass organization (i.e., in the Military Revolutionary
 Committee of the Petrograd soviet). It is said that individuals were assigned the following
 functions:
 "defense,
 supply,
 communications,
 intelligence,
 etc."
 The "general staff" of the insurrectionary forces of one present-day CP is reported to consist
 of - -
 Chief of Staff
 Coordination and Action
 Intelligence
 Tactics
 Materiel
 Discipline and Morale
 179. Personnel posted to various headquarters will be those most experienced in mili-
 tary matters--graduates of schools in the USSR or at home, ex-resistance leaders and veteran
 of the International Brigades in Spain, and Communists with experience in state armies. Spec-
 ialists from the USSR may be attached to the "general staff."
 180. Representatives of Party headquarters will be posted to tactical formations in the
 role of political commissars to supervise the unit commanders.
 181. Insurrectionary staffs will be flexible in composition and function, whatever the
 formal organization: personnel will be called into carry out duties generated by events, indi-
 viduals will be shifted from one job to another and around the various headquarters as need-
 ed, casuals will be utilized as they become available.

 182.   Fighting Formations. It is accepted Communist doctrine that a full-scale armed
 organization is impossible to maintain for a long period in a highly industrialized area. How-
 ever, the Party will have at least a skeleton army (commanders and staffs) and in unstable
 times may be able to maintain a police force.
 Insurrectionary-CP's have made use of three types of military forces: the armed
 fighting groups of workers and others drawn into the uprising -- that is, military mass for-
 mations -- formations of Party members, and subverted units of armed forces and police.
 The ability of the Party to organize formations from among the masses depends mostly upon
 the degree to which the "objective situation" has deteriorated. In non-revolutionary periods,
 the government will be strong enough to prevent or break up any considerable armed groups.
 In a developing revolutionary situation, however, it may not be able to do so. In Russia, the
 Party found already at hand primitively organized bands of factory militia, which had grown
 up on the workers' initiative during the February "bourgeois" revolution. By its organizing
 and propaganda work in the factories, the Bolshevik Party gradually got control of the factory
 detachments, which had a semi-official position, and developed them into a formidable fight-
 ing organization under reasonably good central control. In addition to these "Red Guards" of
 the Party controlled soviet, in some places, the Bolshevik Party organized detachments of
 Party members. Finally, in the uprising in Petrograd, the Bolshevised units of the garrison
 and the Baltic fleet joined with the workers' Red Guard.
 183.  The CP Germany also had made factory detachments (ned Hundr  s and "shock
 troops" made up of Party members for the uprising of 1923. The CP Czechoslovakia had
 factory detachments (workers' militia) and also, controlled units of the state police for the
 1948 coup.
 184.  Communist Parties customarily have a semi-military organization for routine
 defensive and occasional strong-arm duties even in non-revolutionary times. It consists of
 small, partially armed groups of militants, in most cases under the control of local Party
 committees (city or city district). Such groups can be the nucleus for the formation of an ex-
 panding fighting organization in a developing revolutionary situation.
 185.  Size of formations. The R?d Guard of the Bolsheviks in Petrograd was organized
 on a factory basis, with "tens", squads (4"tens"), companies, (3 squads), battalions (3 com-
 panies), and divisions (all the battalions in a district of the city). Most operations were car-
 ried out by squads and companies, that is, by units of from 40 to 120 men. The final, big'
 operation, seizure of the government headquarters, was carried out by all available forces.
 The Red Hundreds of the CP Germany in 1923 were also organized on a factory basis
 and consisted of tens and the Hundred. Each Hundred took the name of the factory in which it
 was based.
 186.  Activation and Utilization of the Subversion Apparatus. Subverted sections of the
 state armed services are held in neutrality by their Communist organizers or are drawn
 actively into the insurrection on the Communist side. The signal to act is given them by
 whichever organ of the Party is responsible for military work. In Russia units were formed
 out of subverted garrison regiments; the night before fighting began, the Party Organizer
 called upon the Bolshevik leader of the Baltic sailors to pick 1500 reliable men and send them
 to Petrograd to help the insurrection. Mobilizing orders may be taken to the units by special
 .representatives of the Party headquarters (e.g., Political Commissars), who then supervise
 operations undertaken by the subverted units. It was declared by the Bolsheviks that such
 units were most effective when used in conjunction with workers' detachments. Mobilization
 may also be achieved by direct orders from Communist agents in the command ranks of the
 army or police (e.g., in Czechoslovakia, the Communist Minister of Interior despatched sev-
 eral police regiments to Prague to help the insurrectionary coup there.)
 187.  Current Preparedness. It is difficult to judge how much of a paramilitary organi-
 zation the CP's of Western Europe, particularly of France and Italy, have at this time.
 Following the war, the press was full of stories about the existence in Italy of a great
 Communist military organization, ready to go and with immediate access to adequate arms`.
 It appears now that these stories were based simply on the overt existence of former Commu-
 nist resistance formations (Garibaldi formations) throughout the country and affiliated with the

 general Partisans Association, ANPI. Undoubtedly, however, the Communist veterans move-
 ment is a pool of experienced fighters, many of whom could be recruited into Communist in-
 surrectionary forces, and a cover for secret skeleton staffs.
 In addition to the resistance veterans organizations, the CP Italy had actually.organi-
 ized in many places small strong-arm formations, with access to arms and under the control
 of local Party committees. These were actually the nearest thing the Party had to a going
 military apparatus, so far as concrete evidence goes.
 188.  Similar stories were circulated in France, based on the existence of the Commu-
 nist resistance veterans and some other veterans groups under Party influence. Again,
 evidence points merely toward the existence of skeleton staffs.
 189.  It is probable that skeleton military organizations for insurrection (with or with-
 out concurrent Soviet military aggression) exists in both Italy and France and perhaps also in
 other countries in Western Europe on the following lines:
 a)  secret military committees at national and federation levels of the Party and
 of lower tactical command staffs (battalion, company, platoon);
 b)  individual Communists given assignments to take command of forces raised
 in various places at the time of an uprising;
 c)  nuclei of special Party formations within the framework of the veterans or-
 ganizations: these to mobilize and lead as many individual members of the or-
 ganizations as possible at the proper time;
 d)  secret weapons caches to be put at the disposal of the formations;
 e)  local mobilization plans (designation of assembly, points, assignment of
 missions to select, reliable, future unit commanders);
 f)  plans for expansion of strong-arm "self-defense" groups.
 190.   City revolutions on the Bolshevik model have become increasingly difficult to
 execute. The complexities of the modern bureaucratic state makes seizure of power by a
 small group of militants difficult. The technological advances of the coercive forces of the
 state in firepower, mobility, and communications make it difficult to defeat detachments of
 the police and the army. Furthermore, simultaneous uprisings in all major cities is a neceS
 sity -- any city left in the hands of the government can be turned into a seat of government in
 a relatively short time. In effect, Communist strength in all areas will have to be much
 greater than the Bolshevik strength in 1917, with correspondingly high capabilities for simul-
 taneous and coordinated action. To what extent the military potential of Western European
 Parties may be nurtured for the contingencies of an East-West war rather than for an in-
 surrection, is an open question at this time.
 V. PENETRATION AND SUBVERSION OF ARMED FORCES.
 191.  Purpose of Penetration. The military forces created by the Communists in re-
 volutionary operations are augmented by attempts to neutralize and win over elements of the
 armed forces opposing them. The coercive forces of the state represent the most powerful
 potential enemy of the CP in a revolutionary situation. It is from the beginning the most im-
 portant target for penetration and subversion, even in periods of revolutionary calm. Pene-
 tration operations are carried out by the Party whether it is a colonial revolution, a resistance
 operation or a city insurrection. The character of the city insurrection, however, makes It
 absolutely essential that the penetration and subversion be successful, which means a greater
 preoccupation of the Party apparatus with this task.
 192.  Party Organization for Penetration. When the Party is small and the penetrations
 are few, such work may be conducted on a decentralized basis -- local Party, organizations
 such as District and Regional Committees have control of the penetrations as a routine matter.

 However, as the size of the operation increases or as the chances of revolution or war in-
 crease, the operation is centralized in a Military Committee, an organ of the Central Com-
 mittee of the Party (see above para. 151.). Broadly, the work of the Military Committee (or
 Commission) is as follows:
 a.  Secret, high level penetrations of the armed forces and police and the govern-
 ment organs controlling them. Direction of Party members making the pene-
 trations.
 b.  Recruitment of members of the armed forces and police, sometimes secretly,
 sometimes openly, depending on the local conditions. This is supported by a
 propaganda campaign aimed at attracting supporters.
 c.  Organization of veterans groups, sporting clubs, etc. as para-military re-
 serves of the Party. Attempts to gain control of non-Communist organizations
 with military potential.
 d.  Creation of armed detachments of Party members and supporters insofar as
 security will allow.
 e.  Study of military questions in general for use of other sections of the Party.
 f . Planning of military operations for the Party, including long range plans for
 insurrection.
 g.  Formulation of the Party line and advice to the Party press on military
 matters.
 While the penetration operations mounted by the Communist Party against the coercive force
 of the state are primarily designed to increase the military potential of the Party either by
 winning over whole units of the armed forces or by so demoralizing the members of the forces
 so that they are incapable of taking strong action against the Party-instigated insurrection,
 the Party also utilitizes its penetrations for intelligence purposes, both for itself and the USSR.
 A summary of some of the cases of Communist penetration and subversion of the armed forces
 will illustrate these points.
 193.  The Bolshevik Penetration Operations. The classical example of the penetration
 and mass subversion of the coercive forces of the state is, of course, the Bolshevik Revolu-
 tion of 1917. The subversion of one Petrograd garrison (depriving the Government of all but
 1-2,000 garrison troops) was largely responsible for the success of the. Revolution. The basic
 units of the Military Organization of the Bolsheviks were the Party cells in garrison and front
 line Army units and in the Russian fleets. The directing organization for penetration was first
 the Petrograd City Committee but after the March 1917 Revolution, this function was trans-
 ferred to the national headquarters. The Party organization for penetration and subversion is
 described in more detail in the case study of the Bolshevik Revolution.
 194.  The pattern of penetration operations of the Bolshevik Revolution, being the com-
 pulsory pattern for Communist city insurrections, was followed in every attempted revolution
 from that timel, and CP's which were not in advanced revolutionary situations also made con-
 stant efforts to penetrate the armed forces and police services, in preparation for an eventual
 revolutionary situation.
 195.  Conditions of membership of the Comintern. Recognition that penetration and sub-
 version of the armed forces of the state are a primary task of all Communist parties was
 1 The Brazilian Revolution of 1935 relied almost entirely on the Communist ability to pene-
 trate and subvert key Army units - a method which proved disastrous. This is discussed
 in the Brazilian case study.

 indicated in the 21 Conditions for membership in the Communist International drawn up at the
 Second World Congress in 1920. The fourth condition states:
 "Persistent and systematic propaganda and agitation must be carried on in the
 army, where Communist groups should be formed in every military organization.--y'?
 Wherever owing to repressive legislation agitation becomes impossible, it is net-c'
 essary to carry on such agitation illegally. But refusal to carry on or participate
 in such work should be considered equal to treason to the revolutionary cause,
 and incompatible with affiliation to the Third International.
 196.   Early Penetrations by the CP Italy. The illegal CP Italy in 1923 has as one of its
 primary targets the penetration of the Fascist Army and Navy. The methods used and the
 success of the penetration are not known in detail. The organization of the military forces of
 the CP was suspended during the illegal period; however, Party records refer to the necessity
 to keep alive and functioning the "directive part of the organization" (the Regional, District,
 etc. Committees for military work). A circular dated 7 December 1922 outlines the tasks
 and methods for the Communist penetration operation against the Italian Army:
 "1. Obtain the entry of able and secure soldiers in places of great confidence.
 There they must become masters of every information and data of their immediate
 and superior commands in order to refer them to us.
 "2. Charge others to lift the exact plans of all the buildings and areas, depots,
 which are of military interest. The same must be done for the barracks and
 buildings of the public safety, profiting from the fact that often soldiers are assign-
 ed for reasons of public safety in the said buildings.
 "3. Disseminate the local Communist printed matter, and daily writings and
 those leaflets which we will transmit, thus arriving at all the strata of the Army.
 "4. Soldier sympathizers must fraternize efficiently with the Royal Guard and the
 Carabinieri to knock holes in that sphere, letting our propaganda enter, especially
 giving it an economic character.
 "5. Take over arms, munitions, explosives, consigning them to our fiduciaries;
 favor outside transactions in contraband arms, etc., etc."
 197.   The CP Germany Apparatus for Penetration. In 1925 when the German Commu-
 nist Party (KPD) set up an extensive illegal apparat, they created the "ZER" (for ZERSETZUNG
 "subversion") Section. It was one of the principle sections of the Apparat from 1925 to 1937
 although two groups were created as early as 1920, according to Ruth Fischer. The ZER
 Section was responsible for neutralization and subversion of the police. Later (in 1932) the
 ZER Section was combined with the "Army Section" which up to that time had had similar re-
 sponsibilities for the Army.
 The ZER Section of the German CP Illegal Apparat carried on a steady propaganda
 campaign among the police by written and oral means, made detailed intelligence studies of
 their organization and established secret Communist cells within the police forces, constantly
 seeking to recruit new policemen for the Party. The "ZER" Section was organized at the local
 level into activist groups of from three to six persons, each group being assigned to work ex-
 clusively on a single limited target - - a specific police station or dormitory. These groups
 worked under strict discipline, and on a clandestine basis, all their members being normal
 remol d from P     m,  be shij on their entrance into this work. It was apparently a rule
 that an activist group should be set up for every physical installation normally used by the
 police.
 198.   The methods used by members of th?ZER section are typical of penetration opera-
 tions by Communist Parties. Police officials were ordinarily first approached through suitable
 intermediaries, persons with whom the officials were known to associate. Having inconspicu-
 ously obtained an introduction to the target official, the agent then planned his recruitment on
 the basis of his personality and political complexion. Sometimes plain talk, sometimes a slow
 program of social activity and political discussion, would be needed to convert the prospect.
 Amenable officials were guaranteed Party support if they should be discharged or encounter

 any difficulties as a result of their new activities, but at the same time they were firmly
 warned of consequences of betraying their mission. As a further precaution, such converted
 police officers were usually required to divulge classified police information to tighten the
 Party's control over them, and the cultivation of dissipation via drink or prostitutes often
 provided the Party with another source of control through threat of blackmail.
 199.  Anti-Military Committees. As the threat of war increased in the interwar years
 and as the military establishments of the capitalist powers grew, the Communists found in-
 creasing need to step up their campaign of penetration of the armed forces and the supporting
 industrial enterprises. Consequently, at the meeting of the Sixth Comintern Congress in 1928,
 one of the Resolutions passed concerned "The Struggle Against Imperialist War and the Tasks
 of the Communists." Organizationally, the resolution resulted in the establishment of "Anti-
 Military Committees" in Parties where no Military Committees existed, and an increase in
 the scope of military work where Military Committees had been formed. The functions of the
 Anti-Military Committees as outlined by the resolution were:
 1.  Concentration on factory and trade union activity in war industries.
 2.  Anti-war work among the peasantry, who would comprise the bulk of the
 military force in a conscription program.
 3.  Anti-war work among the industrial youth.
 4.  Anti-war work among women and workingmen's wives.
 5.  Anti-militarist activity; work in the Army and Navy; work among the re-
 cruits and reservists and in bourgeois defense organizations, i.e., penetration and
 subversion.
 200. A Small Party Penetration Operation. Communist military penetrations are the
 most secret of Communist activities. Therefore, details of such operations are not obtainable
 in large quantity. However, from evidence obtained from several CP's, it has been possible
 to construct a hypothetical case of a small Party penetration operation in the inter-war years.
 201. A Comintern agent designated a Party functionary to be responsible for the mili-
 tary penetration. He was to set up a Military Committee, with advice from the Youth organi-
 zation and the Organization Committee, and was to run the initial penetration. Priority tar-
 gets Were also designated by the Comintern agent, selected in consultation with staff members
 of the Red Army. The Comintern also supplied secret instructions concerning methods of
 penetration, security, communications, etc. The national Party functionary then picked sev-
 eral Communists who were eligible for military service and instructed them to join the regu-
 lar military units: the army, navy and air force; and if possible, to volunteer for service at
 one of the three or four priority geographic targets which had been selected by the Comintern.
 Targets were strategic military centers, such as port cities, and key industries, shipyards,
 etc. The Communist penetration agents were instructed to soft-pedal or to conceal their Com-
 munist affiliations and views to prevent detection. Communications was not to be maintained
 openly with any Communist headquarters; the soldiers wrote letters to girls. with no known
 Party affiliation and the girls forwarded the information to the Party. In some cases pseu-
 donymns were assigned and information sent directly to a Party address, but in plain envelopes.
 202.  The first penetrations run by the Party were closely controlled by the Central
 Committee. The Party enlistee was given a Party address near the military installation to
 which he was to be assigned. This address was to be used only in case of emergency, such as
 loss of contact. The Party member was given detailed instructions concerning his objectives
 and his conduct, and if more than one Communist were in the same military units, a responsi-
 ble would be designated. Agents forwarded intelligence material to headquarters; suggestions
 for propaganda capitalizing on soldier grievances were sent and mailing lists compiled for
 Party headquarters, which in turn mailed propaganda without revealing how the Party obtained
 possession of the name.
 203.  More open penetrations of the reserve and auxiliary para-military units were
 mounted by the Communists. In these, Communists would openly propagandize for the Party..
 program. They would capitalize on the hardships and inequalities of military service and

 205.  Penetration during World War II and Later. The rapid increase in the size of arm-
 ies immediately preceeding and following the outbreak of World War II offered the Communists
 a good opportunity to increase their penetration operations. However, the suddenness with
 which the Parties found themselves engaged in military operations in the case of occupied coun-
 tries and the twists and turns of the Party line prior to-the war prevented full exploitation of
 their wartime penetration opportunities.

 206.  KOSSA. One example of a Party which not only maintained its organization for
 penetration and subversion of the armed forces, but expanded it during the war was the Greek
 Communist Party. The organization, KOSSA, was of considerable aid to the Greek Party when
 it launched its insurrection immediately following the war.
 207.  KOSSA had its roots in the "Anti-Military Bureau" formed in the mid-1920's under
 the Central Committee of OKNE (Communist Youth). It underwent some reorganization prior
 to the war, and followed the Greek army-in-exile to Egypt during the Nazi occupation of Greece
 although its work then was relegated to second place -- military resistance became more im-
 portant.
 208.  Immediately following the war KOSSA was reorganized and contributed substantially
 to the Greek Communist Revolution? Details of its organization during this period can be
 found in the Greek case study.
 209.  In all cases penetration and sub    ion of the armed forces, the Communist
 Youth organizationh~ played an important role. In?-Denmark, in 1948, the military activities
 of the ANJV (Dutc"eneral Youth Movement) were centralized in a National Military Bureau.
 The Military Bureau was assisted by district and sub-district leaders specifically charged
 with military work. The Bureau published a newspaper and registered those ANN members
 who were called up for military service. In statements drawn up by sub-district officials,
 each name was marked with a figure indicating the extent the member in question was deemed
 fit for any future political action. The said registration was used to establish relations among
 the members being in military service and was the first step towards the formation of cells.
 210.  The original plan was to make the ANJV members who were to be called up for
 military service take a training course beforehand specially arranged to turn them out as
 "politically" fit. Owing to lack of trainers, however, this plan had to be abandoned.
 211.  A National Soldiers Committee also exists in the Danish CP and has as its func-
 tions maintaining contact with Party members who are conscripted, and through them to prop-
 agandize among non-Communist personnel. This committee has local sub-committees in
 various towns.
 212.  The most successful example of penetration and subversion of not only the armed
 forces and police, but of key governmental organs as well, is the Czech coup of 1948. Com-
 munist penetration of labor, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Information, and the
 Army proved to be of decisive value for the execution of the coup. The organization of the CP
 Czechoslovakia to carry out the penetration and subversion is not known, although it is of
 major importance as a model for the subversion of the state apparatus of an advanced capital-
 ist country.
 213.  While it is presumed that the CP's in other advanced countries, especially France
 and Italy, have well organized and functioning sections to carry out penetrations of the coer-
 cive apparatus of the state, few of the details have come to light.

 A.  INTRODUCTION
 1. The Chinese Communist Party was formally organized in 1921. In 1923 negotia-
 tions were begun for a Chinese Communist-Kuomintang alliance and were successfully con-
 cluded in January 1924. In the autumn of 1923, Soviet advisers, headed by Michael Borodin,
 began the work of refashioning the KMT organization and the Cantonese armies after the
 Soviet pattern. The KMT was constituted with a Central Committee, a Politbureau, a Secre-
 tariat and various Commissions. It also had a Military Commission (corresponding to the
 present CCP Central Military Council), which functioned as a directing unit for the Kuomin-
 tang armed forces. During this period, the Communists maintained organizational distinction
 between their Party and the KMT. As a result, there were identical organs (such as an
 Agricultural Commission) in both the CCP and KMT, sometimes headed by the same indivi-
 dual (if he happened to be a Communist) with the same staff. However, it was not until early
 1925 that the Communists organized their own Military Commission, previously having been
 content to advance their aims through the Military Commission of the KMT, in which they
 held membership.
 2. In July 1927 the alliance between the Communists and the Kuomintang ended. The
 Communists established themselves in a small area in Kiangsi province and began recruiting
 and training their army. Their armed forces were made up of the defected soldiers, units and
 commanders of the Kuomintang and the local peasantry, which had been rather successfully
 organized by Mao Tse-tung. Scattered peasant-workers' detachments from the Kuomintang
 labor corps had fled to the hills and had independently organized partisan bands. Many of
 these elements were fused in 1927 and 1928 and there emerged a number of Red Armies, the
 most important being the First Peasants' and Workers' Army formed by Mao Tse-tung. From
 1928 to 1930 the Communists gathered strength. Their army numbered 10,000 in 1928; by
 1930 it had grown to 62,000.
 3. A series of annihilation campaigns was begun against the Communists by the
 Kuomintang in 1930. After successfully beating off five attempts to exterminate them in
 Kiangsi, the Communists succeeded in escaping and after the Long March bf 60,00'miles
 (August 1934 to October 1935), arrived decimated, though not disorganized, in Shensi province
 in the northwest. They set up headquarters in Yenan and remained there recouping their
 strength until they began their resistance against the Japanese in 1937.
 4. The decision of the Chinese Communists to form a Red Army and establish it in a
 safe base in the rural areas was not a decision which was made voluntarily. It grew out of a
 number of complex factors, including the expulsion of the Communists from the Kuomintang
 Party, the Trotsky-Stalin feud, the inability of the Communists to organize the urban prole-
 tariat and the success of Mao Tse-tung in establishing support among the peasantry. Com-
 munist strength waned from 1927 to 1930 as a result of successive failures: (1) to seize
 power in the cities with an organization based on the urban proletariat (Canton, 1927), (2) to
 form peasant-based Red armies to take the cities in the name of the proletariat (Changsha,
 1930) and (3) to realize that continued alliance with the bourgeois elements in the Kuomintang
 spelled disaster for the Chinese Communist Party. The minor activities which were carried
 out by Mao Tse-tung in the hinterland were at this time the only positive development in the
 whole bleak landscape of Chinese Communism. The now highly-touted doctrine of peasant-
 protected liberated areas (nearly identical with the heretical recommendations of Trotsky)
 developed as a result of the failure of the orthodox (i.e., Stalinist) doctrine.
 5. The peasant-based Communist insurrectionary army, a feature which the Chinese
 Communists were forced to accept out of necessity and desperation, has now become the
 model for colonial areas. It represents a sharp contrast (though by no means a contradiction)
 to the doctrine which was being applied in advanced countries (e.g., Germany) at about the
 same time. It can be expected that if colonial revolutions in other areas achieve greater
 success than they presently have, they will follow rather scrupulously the insurrectionary
 strategy and organization of the Chinese Communist Party.
 B.  EARLY COMMUNIST ORGANIZATION FOR MILITARY ACTIVITIES
 6. Within a short time after Kuomintang and Chinese Communist collaboration was
 effected, a two-pronged penetration attempt was launched to gain control of the Kuomintang

 S
 for Soviet and Communist purposes. Penetration at the highest levels was achieved by the
 influx of Soviet advisers who remodelled the Kuomintang after the CPSU. The Communists,
 a short time later, launched their own efforts to penetrate and influence the Kuomintang armed
 'forces from below. In March 1925 a Military Committee was set up by the Chinese Communist
 Party, primarily to extend penetration of the Kuomintang. A member of the Central Commit-
 tee in Shanghai was designated to be responsible for military matters. His chief duty was
 control and expansion of Communist cells in the Kuomintang and guidance of their work among
 the non-Communist troops.
 7. Although several references have been found indicating the existence of a Military
 Section of the Central Committee of the CCP, the Secretary of the informal Military Commit-
 tee, Chang Kuo-tao, claims that it was not formalized until after 1931. Whether this is true
 is immaterial for this discussion; a portion of the Central Committee was charged with
 responsibility for military activities (penetration) in the Kuomintang as early as 1925.
 8. Some idea of the early activities of the Military Committee can be obtained from
 the documents of the Soviet Military Attache seized by the Shanghai police in April, 1927. One
 of these documents gives January 1927 as the date a "Military Section attached to the Provi-
 sional Commission of the Central Committee of the CCP" was created. The tasks of the
 Section were outlined only generally, falling roughly into two categories: organization of a
 Communist Army ?-- with peasant and worker detachments ,-- and penetration of the Kuomin-
 tang military establishment.  Another document dated 3 March 1927, purportedly a transcript
 of a meeting of the Military Section, lists eight.persons as attending, although all eight may
 not have been permanent members.  Five appear to have been Russians. Chou En-lai was
 probably one of the Chinese present. At the meeting it was decided to dispatch a request to
 the USSR for arms for 3,000 soldiers.
 9. Earlier in the year (in January 1927) a meeting of the Central Committee of the
 CCP had outlined a program for subversion of the Kuomintang forces. This program not only
 indicated the manner of organization of Communists in the "People's Revolutionary Army"
 (Kuomintang) but also set up conditions for recruiting soldiers into the Communist ranks.
 The pertinent portions of the resolution follow:
 "In each corps or separate division, brigade or regiment where there are 10
 or mere Communists a separate nucleus may be organized. In small nuclei, the office
 of a secretary and in large ones a bureau of three or five members for conducting the
 work should be established. Small associations subordinated to the nucleus may be
 formed, the number of whose members is not limited.
 "Each small association is directly subordinated to the nucleus, and the
 associations have no connection among themselves.
 "Each nucleus shall establish cbnnection only with the secretary of the local
 Party organization and with the section to which it belongs; in relations with other
 comrades and committees of the Party strict secrecy is to be observed.
 "With regard to the training of Communists in the army, special attention must
 be paid to separate individual instruction and to instruction of small associations.
 Meetings of the nuclei and of the small associations must not be disclosed in advance.
 "The question of recruiting Communists in the army: If possible, the com-
 rades in the army must pay due attention to the recruiting of new members. But the
 greatest caution is to be observed in this respect. Besides, the increase of the num-
 ber of members of the Party is temporarily limited to the intermediate and lower
 ranks of commanders and to the most -conscious among them. As regards organization
 and instruction in this period of secret work the comrades must have in view only
 Party organizations but not organizations of Communist youth."
 10. Since the Kuomintang up to 1927 was in organizational appearances essentially a
 Communist Party, it is useful to examine what information is available concerning Soviet
 groups in the Kuomintang military organization.

 11. Russians from the outset dominated the Kuomintang army. This caused frequent
 Chinese expressions of dissatisfaction, mostly because of the type of advice (usually more
 political than military) and the incompetence of the Russians in military specialties. When
 General Galen was sent from the USSR as adviser to Chiang Kai-shek he reorganized the
 Whampoa Military Academy. The chief feature in the reorganization was the introduction of
 the political-military system which included the establishment of a Political Committee,
 Political Bureau, and political professors.  This system afterwards was applied to the
 Chinese Communist army. In general it followed the Soviet Manual for Political Work among
 Troops.

 groups in the Kuomintang had not changed substantially from 1925 to 1927. This document

 "2. The Chief of the group has two assistants, one of whom is his regular substitute
 and at the same time the senior Adviser of the General Staff. The other is the
 assistant for political matters and the Senior Adviser of the Political Department of

 "3. Each corps has a Senior Adviser who works according to the instructions which he
 receives from the Chief Adviser and who directs the work of the Junior Advisers of

 "4. In political matters the Senior Advisers of the corps receive instructions from
 the Senior Adviser of the Political Intelligence Department and carry them out

 "5. Divisions belonging to a corps have advisers directly subordinated to the Senior
 Adviser of the Corps and they carry out the latter's instructions in their units.
 "6. The adviser of a division has under him an assistant and an adviser for political

 14.   he activity of these groups was apparently directed by the Soviet Military Attache in
 Pek ng. For this purpose the Military Attache set up a Peking Military Center which, in
 addition to the Attache, consisted of a representative of the Intelligence Section of the Soviet
 Mission to China and a representative of the Military Section of the Central Committee of the
 CCP.
 15. Soon after the Kuomintang-Communist break, Soviet activities and influence in the
 Kuomintang were curtailed. However, Soviet efforts were then more intensively directed
 toward the Chinese Communist Party and the USSR continued to be highly influential until the
 Central Committee of the CCP moved to Kiangst. Soviet  viser.s re__n_ot known to have been

 16. While the Chinese Communist leadership in Shanghai was attempting to bolster its
 waning influence in urban areas, Mao Tse-tung was building up Communist influence in the
 peasant areas of Kiangsi. Although soviet areasl of short duration began to emerge in South
 China as early as 1927, it was not until November 1931 that the first soviet (at Juichin,
 Kiangsi) was proclaimed. Chou En-lat came from Shanghai for the first meeting which
 elected Mao chairman. The Central Committee, which was still in Shanghai in 1931, decided
 that the establishment of soviet areas was its most important work. It set up military com-
 mittees in every important soviet area. The Secretary of the Politburo of the local Party
 organization, two or three of its important members; the provincial secretary, the top mili-
 tary commander, the highest commissar and the chief of staff were to form each military
 committee. In the Central Soviet, Chou En-lai, Mao Tse-tung, Chu Teh, Hsiang Ying, Ch'in
 Po-ku, Liu Po-ch'eng, Wang Chia-hsiang were members and at one time Chou En-lai was
 Chairman. Later, Mao was Chairman, while Chu Teh and Chou En-lai were vice-chairmen.
 Chang Kuo-t'ao was Chairman of the Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei Soviet Military Committee and
 Hsia Hsi was Chairman of the Hunan-West Hupeh. These committees had free and independent
 power, except for orders from the Central Committee and the Central Military Committee,
 and appear to have concentrated on measures to strengthen the Chinese Communist armed,
 forces.
 17.  Liaison between the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in
 Shanghai and the Kiangsi Soviets was sporadic because of the difficulties in communications.
 The Central Committee transmitted only general resolutions to the Soviet regime -- no
 detailed directives. Some time later (the exact date is not known) the Central Committee
 moved to Juichin, but its membership dispersed throughout the Communist-held areas in
 South China. The real power of the Communist Party was in the hands of Chen Po-ku who
 was then Secretary of the Party and Chou En-lai who was chairman of the Military Committee.
 1 Chinese soviet areas were regions controlled by Communist forces where the Communists
 had attempted to set up governments patterned after the Soviet Union. Except for advice
 given by USSR representatives attached to the Chinese Communis Party in these areas,

 is available concerning the specific organization of the military and its relationship to the
 Party, that even tentative conclusions probably are not justified. While the early experiences
