INTRODUCTION 
The differing approaches Moscow and Beijing have 
taken to this year's presidential election 
campaign reflect their changing relationships 
with the United States. With the sharp deterior-
ation of U.S. ties, Moscow has minimized serious 
analysis of the 1980 campaign and concentrated 
on attacking the foreign and defense policies of 
the two major candidates. Beijing, reflecting 
the increased importance it has attached to 
Sino-U.S. relations since the establishment of 
diplomatic ties and the Soviet intervention in 
Afghanistan, has for the first time paid close 
attention to a U.S. election, taking particular 
note of expressions of anti-Soviet sentiment 
during the campaign.

25 JULY 1980 
MOSCOW DECRIES POSITIONS OF BOTH MAJOR CANDIDATES 
Moscow has thus far shown no inclination 
to favor publicly either of the major 
contenders in the 1980 presidential race. 
Soviet press correspondents and political 
observers are portraying the election as 
a barren choice between a Republican from 
the far right and an incumbent Democrat 
bent on returning to the Cold War. Moscow 
up to now has sustained its vigorous attacks 
on President Carter and his Administration's 
Soviet policies. Tempering their traditionally 
harsh treatment of Governor Reagan, however, 
Soviet media have professed to see a recent 
moderation in his foreign policy positions. 
TONE OF COVERAGE 
Soviet commentary to date has concentrated on flaying the American 
political system and the atmosphere of "hysterical" anti-Sovietism 
in both parties. There has been little effort to present the 
candidates' positions in greater depth, as was done during the 
last two presidential election campaigns. IZVESTIYA's Washington 
correspondent on 21 June illustrated Moscow's plague-on-both-your-
houses approach. He charged that the economic programs of the 
two major candidates would bring the Americans "the same burdens--
inflation, unemployment, and recession." Despite their claims, he 
asserted, both President Carter and Governor Reagan pursue the same 
"hegemonistic, adventuristic, aggressive" foreign policy; both 
oppose ratification of SALT II, and both "gamble on military force 
and interference in the internal affairs of other states." 
ISSUES AND CANDIDATES 
As the architect of current U.S. policies toward the USSR, 
President Carter remains the most frequent target of Moscow's 
wrath. He is regularly accused of trying to whip up American 
chauvinism and war hysteria and of exploiting the Iranian and 
Afghan crises .to strengthen his electoral support. Soviet 
commentators have shown no inclination to tone down their attacks 
on the President out of concern over the prospect of a Reagan 
administration.

While relentlessly pursuing its polemic against the incumbent 
President, Moscow has recently moderated some of its traditional 
criticism of Governor Reagan. Although continuing to characterize 
him as a rightist in the American political spectrum, Soviet 
observers have commented favorably on some of his positions. 
Central Committee information official Oleg Anichkin maintained 
in a 10 June Moscow domestic radio' program, for example, that 
Reagan, sensing victory, had "recently started behaving in a 
more restrained fashion." Anichkin cited as evidence the candi-
date's pronouncements "on holding the Olympic games in Moscow and 
on the SALT II treaty." Counterbalancing earlier reporting of 
Reagan's opposition to SALT II, IZVESTIYA on 29 Jtine reported the 
candidate's foreign policy adviser Richard Allen as saying that 
Reagan would not put a halt to SALT negotiations with the Soviet 
Union. Soviet media reacted to the 14 July CBS television inter-
view in which the governor predicted that the USSR would try to 
help President Carter get reelected, dismissing that remark as 
"demagoguery," but they have so far ignored his acceptance speech 
at the Republican convention. 
Evidently skeptical of Congressman Anderson's chances of being 
elected, Moscow has given his campaign little attention. His 
independent race and the support he has received have been 
portrayed mostly as a reflection of voter discontent with a 
Carter-Reagan choice. Some commentators have stressed the role 
Anderson's candidacy could play in preventing either of the major 
party candidates from getting the necessary votes in the electoral 
college. Moscow has credited Anderson with moving away from 
"extremely rightist views" and has reported favorably on his 
support for SALT II and opposition to the development of the MX 
missile. 
Moscow has played down Senator Kennedy's chances of being the 
Democratic nominee, emphasizing evidence of his political 
vulnerability within the party. Although in the early stages of 
the campaign Soviet media compared his stance on international 
issues favorably with President Carter's, they have made little 
effort in recent weeks to spell out distinctions between the 
Democratic contenders. 
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION 
While maintaining their relative circumspection on Governor 
Reagan himself, Soviet media responded sharply to the party 
platform approved by last week's Republican convention in Detroit. 
Commentators attacked the Republicans for rejecting SALT II, 
calling for U.S. military superiority, and seeking to "turn back 
the clock." The 19 July PRAVDA said that the convention platform 
and speeches suggest that the Republicans view the world "through

the sights of a submachinegun." IZVESTIYA charged on 20 July 
that the platform even broke with agreed principles of U.S. - 
Soviet relations that the Ford and Carter Administrations had 
left unquestioned. At the same time, Soviet commentators have 
diluted their attacks on the Republican platform by alluding to 
the questionable significance of such documents after the 
November election. 
POSTELECTION OUTLOOK 
Moscow is hedging its bets on the future. Speculation about the 
direction of U.S.-Soviet relations beyond November has been 
conspicuously absent in commentary for the domestic audience. In 
slightly more expansive commentary for audiences abroad, Soviet 
specialists have professed readiness to work with the next White 
House incumbent, whoever he may be, but have discouraged hopes for 
a rapid improvement in relations. USA and Canada Institute director 
Georgiy Arbatov commented in this vein in a 9 July Moscow radio 
interview broadcast to North America. Arbatov expressed long-term 
optimism about the prospects for U.S.-Soviet detente but cautioned 
against any expectation of sharp changes for the better immediately 
after the election. The "emotions and moods" generated during 
the campaign, he argued, develop their own inertia; political life 
is not like "water in the faucet," which one can manipulate at will. 
HEAVY BEIJING COVERAGE DISCERNS CONSERVATIVE TREND 
Chinese media have depicted a clear conservative 
-swing in the attitudes of American voters in 
response to persisting economic difficulties 
and anxieties concerning the U.S. strategic 
posture against the Soviet Union. The emergence 
of President Carter and Ronald Reagan as the 
major candidates is seen as reflecting that 
shift in the public mood. Chinese commentary, 
more voluminous than on prior campaigns, has 
predictably avoided explicitly stating a 
preference for any candidate and has thus far 
shied away from speculating on the outcome in 
November. 
SCALE AND TONE OF COVERAGE 
The unprecedented scale of Beijing's coverage of the campaign 
is in keeping with the broader and more intensive attention 
Chinese media have given to foreign events in general in recent

-4-
years, and specifically to events in the United States since 
the normalization of Beijing-Washington relations. Beginning 
last November, the Chinese news agency XINHUA carried generally 
straightforward reports on the decisions of all major candidates 
to run and on the results of all the party primary elections. 
XINHUA and the Beijing press have also carried reports on the 
background of various candidates and commentaries on the principal 
campaign issues. By contrast, Chinese media in 1976 carried only 
two brief reports on the entire election campaign: one in August 
on the selection of the presidential candidates of the "two major 
U.S. bourgeois parties" and another in November reporting the 
Carter victory. A single XINHUA dispatch covered the presidential 
elections in 1972. 
Beijing's treatment of the campaign reflects the ambivalence 
toward international and domestic policy concerns that is common 
to Chinese reporting on the United States in general. Much of 
the commentary on the elections has registered Chinese attitudes 
toward the United States as a strategic and economic power; at 
the same time, an inherently conflicting strain in this comment 
manifests a compulsion to assert Chinese ideological purity and 
institutional superiority. Comment contrasting the U.S. and 
Chinese systems seems designed to counter domestic malaise and 
disaffection, which paradoxically may have been fanned by the 
favorable Beijing media treatment of the United States that 
accompanied Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping's U.S. visit last year 
and lent support to the unexpected strength of the dissident 
"democracy movement" in Beijing. Thus Chinese comment on the 
U.S. election campaign has pointed to the great expense involved 
in running for president, to the lack of significant choice 
offered the U.S. voter between candidates equally linked to U.S. 
monopolistic financial "cliques," and to alleged voter apathy 
throughout the United States, which Beijing ascribes to the 
nature of "bourgeois" democratic institutions and practices. 
ISSUES AND CANDIDATES 
Chinese commentary has portrayed the U.S. electorate as 
increasingly conservative in mood and has attributed the success 
of President Carter and Governor Reagan in the primaries to this 
trend in public opinion. Initially Beijing related the conser-
vative trend to popular anxiety concerning U.S. economic problems. 
Later, however, Beijing concluded--with scarcely concealed 
satisfaction--that the "shock" of Iran and Afghanistan had 
engendered widespread U.S. concern about foreign policy, particu-
larly with regard to the U.S.-Soviet strategic balance.

In reporting the Democratic Party primaries, Chinese comment 
has portrayed President Carter's "hardened" attitude toward 
Soviet expansionism as an asset in his campaign against 
Senator Kennedy, noting that the senator had criticized the 
President for "exaggerating" the significance of the Soviet move. 
While welcoming what it sees as a shift to a stronger U.S. stance 
toward Moscow since the Afghan invasion, Beijing has suggested 
that the Administration's policies are less a product of con-
Wsistency in conviction and principles than a response to growing 
public pressure on the President to defend U.S. strategic interests. 
/1Commentary on the Republican Party primaries has portrayed 
Governor Reagan as a "hardliner" on the Soviet Union from the 
start and has seen his success as a product of the conservative 
U.S. mood. Chinese media virtually ignored statements by 
Governor Reagan in May on restoring some form of official ties 
with Taiwan, but in early June--presumably once the governor had 
&emerged as the prospective Republican nominee--authoritative 
Chinese press commentary attacked his views as a potential threat 
to Sino-U.S. relations. That Beijing commented on this issue at 
all breaks with its usual pattern of silence--except when reacting 
to statements on Taiwan by Administration officials--and underlines 
the persistent anxiety of the Chinese leadership about U.S. attitudes 
toward Taiwan. On 23 June and 2 July the Chinese party paper 
RENMIN RIBAO asserted that Reagan's "preposterous views" on this 
issue are extremely "unpopular" and may harm his election campaign; 
subsequently XINHUA reported assurances by the governor that he has 
no intention of altering the current PRC-U.S. relationship. 
Media attention to the Republican convention reaffirmed the themes 
predominating in coverage of the primary campaign. XINHUA's 16 
July report on Governor Reagan's nomination, for example, observed ' 
that his success "reflects the change of mood" among Republican 
voters resulting from the "tremendous difficulties in the country's 
economy and its position abroad." 
Beijing has described Congressman Anderson as the "only liberal" 
among Republican candidates. While noting his call for a firm U.S. 
military response to further Soviet expansion in the Persian Gulf 
region--a stance the PRC favors--Beijing has also pointed out that 
he is an advocate of SALT and an opponent of increased defense 
spending. After Congressman Anderson announced his independent 
candidacy, RENMIN RIBAO on 2 July published a background report on 
U.S. constitutional procedure in the event of the failure of any 
candidate to win a clear majority.

PROSPECTS 
Chinese commentary on the election campaign has predictably 
indicated no clear preferencelor any candidate and has eschewed 
speculation about who might be the victor. A 7 June RENMIN RIBAO 
analysis of the campaign did observe, however, that persistent 
disunity within the Democratic Party between the President and 
Senator Kennedy and the independent campaign of Congressman 
Anderson may harm President Carter's prospects in November. The 
commentary observed that while the President's election campaign 
staff had initially considered Governor Reagan the most easily 
defeated Republican, "such optimistic views have rarely been 
heard recently." ,At the same time, commentary on the Republican 
convention reflected Beijing's doubts about Governor Reagan. 
A 16 July RENMIN RIBAO commentary, for example, examined evidence 
that the governor was moderating his "hawkish" views and his 
policy on China and commented that "so far no one has sufficient 
clues" to know how he will act.
