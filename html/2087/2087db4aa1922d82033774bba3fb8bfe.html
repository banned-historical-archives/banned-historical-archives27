 IND0CHINA
 Vietnamese communist attacks on the Nixon Administration's
 "aggression" throughout Indochina and alleged duplicity at the
 Paris talk-- continue along standard lines.  The tone is typified
 by a Hanoi radio commentary on 19 June, pegged to the President's
 TV speech on the economy on the 17th, which says that "if Nixon
 re"rises to look at the truth and to put an end to the war, the
 U.S. economy will undergo unpredictably more serious consequences,
 and his career will collapse like Johnson's."
 Soviet attacks on U.S. "aggression" in?Cambodia'and  he rest of
 Indochina include a 21 June PRAVDA article by Yuriy Zhukov which
 is notable for its direct censure of the President.  Zhukov does
 not discuss U.S. Indochina policy in the context of Soviet-U.S.
 relations.  But in conclusion he does quote Brezhnev's remark, in
 his 12 June election speech, that by the expansion of the war
 into Cambodia, U.S. leaders are merely expanding their military
 and political defeats both in Indochina and beyond.
 Current Soviet propaganda is not marked by the attacks on Peking's
 Indochina policy that had become a propaganda staple since the
 inception cf the Cambodian crisis.  But Peking's most direct,
 though still implicit, criticism of Moscow's policy on Cambodia
 comes in the 25 June joint PEOPLE'S DAILY-RED FLAG-LIBERATION ARMY
 editorial on the 20th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean
 War.  It says that at a time when Asian peoples are strengthening
 their unity in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, "there are
 certain persons who are collaborating with U.S. imperialism in evil
 doings . . . , ever:. maintaining dirty relations with Lon Not and
 his like."
 While Peking had not commented independently on Soviet failure to
 recognize the Sihanouk government, NCNA on 12 May carried an attack
 by the Burmese CP, which said that "the Soviet revisionist clique
 dares not denounce the counterrevolutionary Lon Nol clique by name
 and has not dared up to now" to recognize Sihanouk's government.
 Allusions to the Soviets also seemed evident in Mao Tse-tung's 20 May
 statement in which he noted pointedly that the new Cambodian govern-
 ment had been recognized by "nearly 20" regimes, as well as in Kang
 Sheng's 9 June banquet speech for a delegation from Romania in which
 he praised that country as one of the first to extend recognition.
 CAMBODIAN ACTION DESCRIBED, INDOCHINA "VICTORIES" HAILED
 Propaganda on recent military action in Cambodia includes Liberation
 and Hanoi broadcasts on 19 and 20 June, respectively, which cite
 the Western press in reporting the cutting off of Phnom Penh.  Hanoi

 observes that "the Cambodian patriotic forces have severed all
 roads linking Phnom Penh with the provinces, thus making the
 capital almost completely isolated."  VNA on the 20th, citing the
 Information Bureau of the United National Front of Kampuchea (FUNK),
 rounds up selected military actions in June and says that Chhep
 and Chey Seng districts of Preah Vihear Province were "completely
 liberated" on the 13th when the local armed forces and people "rope
 up in insurrection."  VNA also mentions action adjacent to the
 Thai bord.er, saying that the "patriotic forces" on 19 June attacked
 government forces in Pai Lin "about two kilometers from the Thai
 border."
 In hailing the "victories" of the first 15 days of June on the
 battlefields of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, Liberation Radio on
 the 19th comments that the "most striking point" of the Cambodian
 situation during the first half of the month was that the "Cambodian
 revolutionary forces continued to develop -y leaps and bounds,
 qualitatively and quantitatively."  LPA on 20 June routinely
 describes the exploits of the "armed forces and people in Indochina;"
 as attaining a "new stage" in the respective anti-U.S. struggles of
 the three peoples.
 Comment on the war in South Vietnam includes an 18 June QUAN DOI
 NHAN DAN commentary which does not dwell on military feats but
 stresses the importance of strengthening bases in "liberated areas."
 The DRV army paper says it is neces.;ary to "build political organs"
 in areas under allied control and to develop guerrilla warfare in
 adjacent aretis to contain the enemy.
 PATHET LAO DENIAL OF     Following Hanoi's denunciation on the 13th
 TROOPS IN ANGKOR WAT     of the "fabricated news" put out by the
 Phnom Penh regime that 10,000 Vietnamese
 communist troops, including Pathet Lao and Chinese elements, were
 quartered in the Angkor Wat temple complex, the Pr_thet Lao news
 agency KPL issued an "authorized" denial dated 17 June.  As
 publicized by Pathet Lao radio on the 18th and by VNA on the 20th,
 the statement "absolutely" denies "foreign reports from Cambodia"
 to the effect that Pathet Lao units were operating it Siem Reap-
 Angkor Wat area of Cambodia.
 ACTIVITIES OF MINISTERS IN SIHANOUK'S GOVERNMENT
 DELEGATION Li     On 19 June VNA cited t.io FUNK information office
 INDIA, CEYLON      as reporting that a delegation of the Royal
 Government of National Union, led by Foreign
 Minister Sarin Chhak and Minister of Popular Education and Youth
 Chan Youran, had spent the week of 10-17 June in India, where they

 were received by and had a "cordial talk" with Prime Minister. Gandhi,
 External Affairs Minister Dinesh Singh, and Foreign Secretary Kaul.
 VNA noted that Mme. Gandhi affirmed "sympathy with and respect for
 SE.mdech Norodom Sihanouk, head of state of Cambodia," expressing
 hope that the Cambodian people would soon recover the peace,
 independence, and neutrality of Their country.  VNA said the
 delegation left India on the 17th to visit "a number of African
 countries."  An 18 June NCNA report of the meeting with Indian
 officials adds that Sarin Chhak, asked at a press conference if there
 was any possibility that Sihanouk would "come to the conference
 table" with Lon Nol, responded by asking r.etorically how it would
 be possible for Sihanouk to hold talks with a "traitor."
 On the 23d, NCNA reported that the delegation visited. Ceylon from
 the 18th to the 22d.  Neither VNA nor NCNA has raised the question
 of possible recognition of Sihanouk's government by India* or
 Ceylon.  But AFP on the 22d described the visit to Ceylon as an
 effort to add it to the countries which have recognized the
 government; the report noted that according to Chhak,
 Mrs. Bandaranaike said Ceylon would not recognize the Phnom Penh
 regime healed by Lon Nol.   (AFP reported that the delegation left
 on the 2%d for Cairo.)
 PEKU;G MEETING OF           LPA reported on 19 June, as Peking had
 PENN NOUTH, MME. BINH       done earlier, that PRG Foreign Minister
 Mme. Binh had met with Chou En-lai in
 Peking on the 17th.  Another LPA item the same day said that she
 also met with Sihanouk and his prime minister, Penn Nouth, while
 in Peking.  (On the 18th PTI reported that Mme. Binh will visit
 India from 20 to 26 July, having been invited by External Affairs
 Minister Dinesh Singh last September when he was in Hanoi for Ho
 Chi Minh's funeral.)
 PARIS TALKS:  ROUTINE DEMANDS FOR U.S. WITHDRAWAL REPEATED
 Consistent with recent practice, the VNA account of the 71st se-sion
 of the Paris talks on 18 June glosses over much of the detail of
 the communist delegates' speeches and barely acknowledges the
 allied delegates' remarks.  PRG delegate Nguyen Van Tien reiterated
 *  The Bombay PTI reported on 18 June that Sihanouk's government
 is "expected shortly" to set up an "information bureau" in New
 Delhi and that the question was discussed by Sarin Chhak during his
 visit.

 in standard terms the two basic demands--a complete U.S. withdrawal
 and the establishment of a provisional coalition government.  The
 LPA account., but not VNA, notes that Tien reiterated the PRG's
 proposal that if the United States would declare its intention to
 unconditionally withdraw all its forces within six months, then
 the parties concerned would discuss the withdrawal timetable
 as well as the question of insuring safety for the withdrawing
 troops.
 The VNA account reports that DRV delegate Nguyen Minh Vy termed
 a "hoax" U.S. delegate Habib';, remark at the previous session that
 the United States was prepared to act on the principle of a
 withdrawal of all U.S. forces from South Vietnam.  But it does
 not acknowledge Vy's criticism of the "driblet" withdrawals and
 the Administration's refusal to announce a timetable for complete
 withdrawal, or his caustic remark that despite the President's
 claims he in fact has no timetable.  The account notes Vy's
 observation that the United States is still pursuing its
 unreasonable demands at Paris but omits his specification of
 these demands as the call. for a mutual troop withdrawal--which
 Vy routinely described as a "notorious" proposal--and maintenance
 of the GVN.
 VNA reports Vy's comment that President Nixon's statements in his
 3 June address regarding continued U.S. air strikes in Cambodia
 and the possibility of continuing ARVN ground operations in
 Cambodia amount to "a completely new version" of the policy the
 President had enunciated at his 3 May news conference.  (The
 account, however, does not fully report that Vy presented his
 version of what the President said on 8 May--that intruding U.S.
 forces would go no further than 35 kilometers and that by 30 June
 all U.S. and Saigon troops would be withdrawn and all U.S. air
 support missions would cease.)
 ALLIED       As in last week's account, VNA fails to offer its
 SPEECHES     usual terse description of the allied delegates'
 presentations.  Nor does it even extend the courtesy
 of naming Ambassadors Lam and Habib.  VNA simply says that "for
 all their phraseological efforts, the delegates of the U.S. and
 Saigon administration failed to make their arguments sound in any
 way different from what they had said previously, which largely
 illustrated the United States' unwillingness to stop its policy
 of aggression and to negotiate seriously for a fair and just
 settlement of the Vietnam problem."

 24 JUNE 1970
 VNA BELATEDLY NOTES GVN PLAN 10 RELEASE DRV PRISONERS
 A VNA "authorized" statement on 23 June conveys the DRV's belated
 ?          reaction to GVN delegate Lam's announcement, at the 11 June Paris
 session, of his government's intention to release a group of
 North Vietnamese wounded prisoners and captured fishermen on
 11 July.  Ignoring the fact that the issue came up at Paris,*
 the statement says that "on orders from the United States," the
 Saigon administration on 11 June again raised the issue of
 releasing a group of 24 North Vietnamese fishermen and 62 "other
 people who were arrested and have been illegally detained by
 them in South Vietnam and whom they call 'North Vietnamese
 prisoners of war.'"  It states categorically that "since all
 Vietnamese citizens have the right to live on Vietnamese territory,"'
 the United States and the Saigon administration "must free all
 Vietnamese patriots illegally arrested and imprisoned in South
 Vietnam."
 The statement concludes by stating that past practice must b.
 followed and by outlining provisions, including release of the

 MOSCCvv SCORES U.S. "AGGRESSION," SILENT ON CONFERENCE ISSUE
 ZHUKOV         An unusually sharp attack is leveled at President
 IN PRAVDA     Nixon by Yuriy Zhukov in a 21 June PRAVDA article
 which has been summarized by TASS and broadcast by
 Moscow radio in foreign languages including Vietnamese and
 Cambodian.  After graphically describing the action in Cambodia,
 including casualties sustained by civilians, Zhukov says that
 "all this President Nixon dares to call concern for 'consolidating
 peace throughout the world,' at the same time boasting that his
 operation in Cambodia 'has proven the most successful throughout
 this prolonged and arduous war!'  Such an interweaving of
 brutality and hypocrisy is truly monstrous."  Despite this direct
 attack on the President, Zhukov does not discuss U.S. Indochina
 policy in the context of U.S.-Soviet relations.  But in conclusion
 he does quote Brezhnev's remark in his 12 June election speech that

 by expanding the war "Washington leaders are expanding only the
 scale of their future defeats on a military and political front,
 both in Indochina itself and beyond, and in their own country
 also."
 The bulk of the article consists of quotations from the foreign
 press, and Zhukov cites reports that even after the withdrawal
 of U.S. ground troops from Cambodia "the level of military actions
 will remain higher than at the end of April" through the use of
 allied "puppets" and U.S. "artillery, air, and material assistance."
 He (-:ven accuses the Uni'ed States of using "nuclear blackmail,"
 saying the Western press has noted that nuclear weaponry is
 present in the region of Southeast Asia.  Noting Soviet support
 for the Cambodians, Zhukov says the Soviet Government has expressed
 "sympathy and support" for the Cambodian struggle and recalls the
 14 May CEMA statement and Brezhnev's 19 May message to the Cairo
 conference on Laos.
 U THANT IN     Moscow's avoidance of the issue of a conference on
 MOSCOW         Indochina is pointed up in its treatment of UN
 Secretary General U Thant's Moscow visit.
 Consistent with Soviet media's failure to acknowledge U Thant's
 11 June call for a 15-nation conference, propaganda on his
 17-21 June visit not only fails to mention a political settlement,
 but says little about Indochina.  On the 19th TASS quoted Thant
 at a Kremlin luncheon as denouncing the "barbarous war" in
 Vietnam and criticizing "recent events" in Cambodia, and :.
 as adding vaguely that the conversations "showed that his attitude
 to the war in Cambodia coincides almost completely with that of
 the Soviet Union."
 Vietnamese communist media are not known to have mentioned Thant's
 Moscow visit, although both Hanoi and the Liberation Front
 denounced his 11 June call for a conference.  Peking says nothing
 about a political settlement on its own authority, but PTCNA
 azd Peking radio have carried LPA and VNA commentaries denouncing
 U Thant's statement on a conference.*

 SOVIET-SWEDISH     The Soviet-Swedish communique on Prime Minister
 COMMUNIQUE         Olof Palme's visit, carried in the Moscow domestic

 the need for "all foreign troops" to be withdrawn from Indochina
 and for the peoples of the region to have the opportunity to decide
 their own future.  It adds that both sides pointed to the need for

 aggression in Indochina and strict respect for the right of the
 peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos to decide independen?.ly their

 DJAKARTA CONFERENCE     Soviet propaganda is not known to have
 THREE-NATION MISSION    mentioned the Moscow visit of the Djakarta
 conference three-nation mission which met
 with Gromyko on 17 June.  But according to Djakarta's ANTARA press
 agency on the 18th, Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik said
 that on the issue of an international conference Gromyko merely
 referred to Kosygin's 4 May remarks that the initiative should come
 from Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos.  And on the 22d ANTARA quoted
 Malik further as reporting that Gromyko stated that the Soviet
 Union had never wanted the ICC suspended in Cambodia--a remark that
 Malik said showed that the USSR shared the view of the Djakarta
 conference, which wanted to reactivate the ICC.
 Although Soviet propaganda ignores th'. presence of the mission, an
 attack on the Djakarta conference along the lines of earlier
 comment appears in a TASS commentary on the 18th, published in
 IZVESTIYA the next day.  It repeats earlier propaganda in charging
 that the conference was composed of "direct accomplices of U.S.
 aggression in Indochina" and that it constituted an attempt to
 "divert attention" from the U.S. invasion of Cambodia.  It concludes
 with the standard demand for a U.S. troop withurq.wal.
 The three-nation mission is mentioned briefly in a communique on
 talks between Japanese and Chinese fishery associations, carried by
 NCNA on 20 June.  The communique merely scores the mission for
 engaging in "scheming activities of all descriptions" but does not
 mention its visit to Moscow.

 NLHX Chairman Souphanouvong to Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma,
 answering the latter's 9 April letter defining the RLG position

 Souvanna's letter had been in reply to Souphanouvong's first letter,

 pressed the NLHX five-point proposal and urged that Souvanna agree
 to "an immediate, complete, and unconditional halt to the U.S.

 concerned in Laos to negotiate and to solve Laotian internal
 affairs."  In his reply on 9 April Souvanna reaffirmed that the

 HANOI CLAIMS SHELLING OF DRV, ASSAILS JUNE "CRIMES"
 A 20 June DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement claims that the
 United States "launched artillery attacks from positions south of
 the demilitarized zone (DMZ) and from the open sea" against Vinh
 Son and Vinh Giang villages in the northern part of the DMZ on
 16 June.  On 18 June, it says, U.S. aircraft fired rockets at
 fishing boats of the coastal areas of Ky Xuan Village, Ky Anh
 district, Ha Tinh Province.  It further charges that the United
 States also launched artillery attacks from positions south of the
 DMZ against some areas of the northern part of the DMZ, "using toxic
 chemical shells, thus affecting many innocent people."  In standard
 fashion, the spokesman "sternly condemned these criminal acts" and
 demanded an immediate halt to all actions violating DRV sovereignty
 8 security.
 The most recent previous ministry spokesman's protests, on 27 and
 30 May, charged the United States with using B-52's to bomb the DMZ.
 U.S. "war crimes" committed in both North and South Vietnam in the
 first half of June were documented in a DRV War Crimes Commission
 communique, carried by VNA on 18 June.  Routine in nature, the
 communique enumerated charges of continued reconnaissance flights,
 alleged U.S. bombings in Ha Tinh and Quang Binh provinces and Vinh
 Linh area, and offshore naval patrols said to threauen the "normal
 life and activites" of fishermen.  It scored "indiscriminate U.S.
 bombing raids against populous areas near Saigon" and "stepped-up
 repression" by the GVN against youths, students, Buddhists, and the
 press.

 DRV NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DELEGATION VISIT TO EAST EUROPE
 On 23 June VNA reports the composition of' a DRV National Assembly
 delegation, headed by Hoang Van Hoan, Politburo member and vice
 chairman of the National Assembly Standing Committee, which will
 "pay a friendship visit" to a number of socialist countries in
 Eastern Europe at the invitation of their national assemblies.
 (The communique of the last National Assembly Standing Committee
 meeting reported by VNA on 11 June, had noted that the committee
 had decided to send a delegation "to several fraternal socialist
 countries.")  On the same day, VNA notes that the delegation left
 Hanoi that day and was seen off by Truoug Chinh and Nguyen Duy Trinh.
 An NCNA item on the 21.l cryptically reports that the delegation had
 arrived in Peking that afternoon "on its way to other countries."
 It says they were welcomed at the airport by Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien,
 who gave a banquet in their honor that evening.
 A NHAN DAN editorial on the 24th describes the delegation's tour as
 "an event of important significance for the further consolidation
 and development of the existing relations of friendship between
 the DtIV National Assembly and people and the national assemblies
 and peoples of the brother countries."  The paper notes the "great
 importance" the DRV attaches to the "friendship, militant solidarity
 and mutual support" between it and the other socialist countries.
 Recalling a similar visit in July-August 1965,* it says that the
 current visit "again shows the determination of our state and
 people to fulfill" the task of strengthening solidarity.  It
 routinely thanks the countries for their "hearty support and
 assistance."  Going on to hail the "strength of unity and struggle"
 of the three Indochinese peoples as "invincible", it stresses that
 the socialist countries'"support and assistance" make up an
 "important factor" for their victory.  It declares that in the
 present stage the "sympathy and support of the brother socialist
 countries bears a significance of even greater importance."
 *  The delegation in 1965 was similarly headed by Hoang Van Hoan
 and it visited the PRC, DPRK, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union.

 KOREA
 DPRK ANNOUNCES FOUNDING OF "MARXIST-LENINIST PARTY" IN ROK
 On 20 Juric KCNA announced the establishment; of a "Marxist-Leninist
 party" in South Korea, reporting that "South Korean revolutionaries"
 formed the "central committee of the Revolutionary Party for
 Reunification" In August 1969 and adopted a party manifesto and
 program.*  Later on the 20th KCNA carried a NODONG SINMUN editorial
 effusively praising the founding of this "Marxist-Leninist party"
 as a "historic event" and a "new turning point" in the South
 Korean revolution.  The editorial recalls that many times in the
 past Kim I1-song has emphasized the necessity of building such a
 Marxist-Leninist vanguard party ir, the South to guide the
 revolution.  It says the building of the party now "fully meets
 the urgent demands of the development of the South Korean revolu-
 tion and completely accords with the subjective and objective
 situation prevailing in South Korea."
 KCNA says that the Revolutionary Party for Reunification was
 formed in March 1964 as "an illegal revolutionary organization."
 `i'bis is apparently the same organization as--or an outgrowth of--
 the United Revolutionary Party first known to have been mentioned
 in August 1968.  Although KCNA in English now refers to the
 "Revolutionary Party for Reunification," the version in Korean
 is Tongil Hyonmyong Tang--the same Korean title of what has
 previously been referred to in English as the United Revolutionary
 Party.  Further evidence that the parties are identical is that
 the founding date of the Revolutionary Party for Reunification,
 March 1964, has previously been cited as that of the United
 Revolutionary Party.  The "organ" of the new party, REVOLUTIONARY
 FRONT, has been identified in the past with the United Revolutionary
 Party, although the "Journal" CHONGMAEK has been given more
 publi city.
 Calls for a vanguard "Marxist-Leninist" party date back to
 Kim I1-song's speech at the Fourth KWP Congress in September
 1961 and appeared repeatedly in subsequent propaganda.  References
 KCNA says the details were reported in a "recent" issue of the
 party organ REVOLUTIONARY FRONT.  It says the manifesto and program
 were published "recently" in a number of foreign papers, including
 the U.S. BLACK PANTHER, the Manchester GUARDIAN, and several
 African and Japanese papers.  The documents are known to have
 appeared in the Cairo EGYPTIAN GAZETTE on 10 March 1970.

 is a "new-type Marxist-Leninist party" guided by him I1-song's
 :.dca of "chuche," the "original embodiment of Marxism-Leninism
 in the present era and in the actual conditions of our country."
 The party's first task, says the manifesto, is to "carry out the
 people's democratic revolution in South Korea," overthrow the
 "corrupt, colonial, sernifeudal system," set up a "people's
 democratic system," and accomplish national unification.
 The 12-point party program calls for the overthrow of the
 colonial rule of U.S. imperialism and the establishment of
 an "independent democratic government."  It includes points
 on land reform, nationalization of industry, labor laws, women's
 rights, cultural development, education, and public health, and
 it calls for the formation of "national self-defense ar.,ied
 forces," the realization of "independent diplomacy," and
 "friendship with the anti-imperialist peace-loving countries."
 It concludes with a reassertion of the goal of "independent
 peaceful unification of the country."

 MOSCOW'S OFFENSIVE ABATES, PEKING CONTINUES RESTRAINT
 Au Peking continues by and large to maintain its propaganda ntanddown
 toward the Oovietu, Moucow'u polemical offensive act oft' by the
 18 May 1'HAVDA editorial article seems to have spent its force.
 Since puibIication oC ci.cction L1pecches delivered by the three top
 soviet Lcaduru from :LO to 12 Junc, the Soviet central press has
 ignored China, with the bulk of Moscow's connnent on China appearing
 in broadcasts beamed to the Chineuc.
 TRUD ON     Apart from citing the leaders' speeches, which blamed
 BORDERS     the Chinese for causing an impasse at the Peking talks,
 Soviet propaganda ha,s avoided the border question.
 However, an article in TRUD on the 12th, appearing on the third
 day of the successive speeches by Kosygin, Podgornyy, and Brezhnev
 attacking the Chiresc for impeding the Sino-Soviet border talks,
 discusses in suggestive detail how the Soviets and Turks arc going
 about redemarcating their border.   The article does not mention any
 borders other than those with Turkey, but its discussion is replete
 with implications for the Sino-Soviet negotiations.  In a PRAVDA
 article on 28 May the Soviet border guards commander, Col. Gen.
 P. Zyryanov, had mentioned the Sino-Soviet talks alongside references
 to work on demarcation of the Soviet borders with Turkey and Ircn.
 Presented is the form of reportage from a site where work on
 delimiting the border is being conducted, the TRUD article explains
 that redemarcation has been rreccnsitated by changes wrought by nature
 since border treaties were signed in the 1920's.  Among such changes
 it cites those affecting river beds and islands which have disappeared,
 have joined the other country's bank, or have been newly formed.
 Explaining that the border is always the most sensitive barometer
 of interstate relations, the article observes that the slighte,-,t
 complication in any sector, "even the tiniest," can lead to "serious
 conflict."  For this reason, it adds, the Soviet Government offered
 to make the existing border "more precise," and talks were held in
 which an agreement was reached on the basis that there would be an
 exact balancing of awards of land to each side In the course of the
 redemarcation.
 The approach set forth in the article suggests how the Soviets might
 be prepared to make adjustments with the Chinese on such questions
 as the disputed river islands.  't'hus, it would be compatible with

 NCNA ON     The Chinese have permitted themselves various polemical
 SOVIETS     slaps at the Soviets, while avoiding giving an
 impression of intent to reopen major polemics which
 might alienate the Asian parties the Chinese have been trying
 to cultivate.  NCNA on 18 June took to task a m'.nor Soviet
 "expert on Japan" visiting that country for having appealed in
 it speech for Soviet-Japanese cooperation to cope with revolu-
 tionaries in China, Vietnam, and Korea.  Though the NCNA report
 contains a passing reference to "the renegade features of the
 Soviet revisionists," it is mainly designed to score easy points
 at the expense of Moscow's reputation among the Asian parties
 without undercutting the effects of Peking's current polemical
 restraint.
 According to NCNA, citing a report in MAINICHI, the Soviet speaker
 indicated that Asia is the most dangerous area in the world
 because it contains three of the four split countries--that is,
 Ching, and Taiwan, North and South Korea, and North and South
 Vietnam.  NCNA thus contrived to play on Pyongyang's concern
 over Soviet dealings with Japan and to associate Peking's claim
 on Taiwan with North Korean and North Vietnamese aspirations for
 reuniting their divided countries.*  The NCNA report has been
 given wide dissemination -.n Peking broadcasts, presumably in
 keeping with NCNA's explanation that it was reporting the speech
 "specially for the entertainment of all."
 Japan also figured in another reminder of Peking's rivalry with
 Moscow, an NCNA report on the 22d that Chou En-lai and Kuo Mo-jo
 had received the Japanese authors of "Is the Soviet Union a Socialist
 Country?" and members of a visiting Japanese "antirevisionist"
 youth delegation.
 *  A Peking joint editorial dated 25 June, marking the 20th anniversary
 of the outbreak of the Korean war, also seeks to associate Peking's and
 Pyongyang's irredentist claims by charging in its opening sentence that
 20 years ago the United States "launched a war of aggression against
 Korea, and two days later it occupied by force China's sacred territory
 Taiwan province."

 Peking's propaganda against the renewal of the Japan-U.S. siecurity

 attacking the Soviets while playing on common interests of the PRO

 Korean war anniversary, however, indirectly attacks the Soviets
 in charging that unnamed "certain persons" are "collaborating with
 U.S. imperialism in evil doings, fraternizing with the Japanese
 reactionaries, and even maintaining dirty relations with Lon Nol

 EL PRC SAYS TIME NOT SUITABLE FOR SETTING WARSAW MEETING DATE-
 Peking announced on 20 June that the Chinese liaison officer for
 the Warsaw talks notified his American counterpart that day that
 it would not be suitable at this time to set a date for the next
 session of the ambassadorial talks.  The announcement said the,
 date for the next session will be discussed "at the proper time"
 through the liaison personnel.
 Unlike Peking's announcement on the postponement of the meeting
 scheduled for 20 May, which cited the U.S. incursion into
 Cambodia as the reason for the postponement, the current
 announcement points only to the fact "that both sides clearly
 understand the current situation."  Thus the announcement care-
 fully leaves the door open for a resumption of the talks after
 the United States winds up its involvement in Cambodia, while
 indicating to Moscow that Peking intends to continue using this
 channel as part of its effort to acquireleveraga against the
 Soviets.
 Chinese comment on the Nixon Administration and Indochinese
 developments seems inconclusive regarding what sort of atmosphere
 surrounding Sino-U.S. relations ti;ould be regarded as suitable for
 a resumption of the Warsaw talks.  A commentary carried by NCNA
 on 7 June for domestic publication indulged in venomous personal
 vilification of the President, but, significantly, it was not
 disseminated abroad by NCNA and has been monitored from Radio
 Peking only in Korean and Japanese.  Comment on Washington's
 declared intent to withdraw American troops from Cambodia by
 30 June has characterized the U.S. position as d.aceitful and
 designed to mollify the American people.  NCNA on tra 7th and
 PEOPLE'S DAILY on the 8th, discussing the President's 3 June
 speech, no;;ed that he indicated U.S. bombing of Cambodia would

 against, the people in Indochina and in Southeast Asia as a

 MOSCOW CAUTIOUS ON IMPLICATIONS OF CONSERVATIVE VICTORY
 Moscow treats the upset victory of the Conservatives in the
 18 June British Parliamentary elections as a vote not so'much
 for the Conservatives as against the policies of the Laborites,
 both domestic and foreign.  Pre-election comment had described the
 differences between the two'parties on. foreign. policy as negligible
 and portrayed, the contest as being waged primarily,over domestic
 issues--essentially minor questions of reform within the'Briti-sh
 capitalist system.  Commentators now picture the vote as an
 expression of deep dissatisfaction with Labor's economic policies
 and as a rejection of U.S.-oriented foreign policy positions
 from which the new government will have to draw the appropriate
 conclusions.
 Addressing British listeners on the 22d, a Radio Moscow commentator
 suggested that one conclusion the Heath government might draw from
 the election was the need "to put maximum effort into restoring
 Britain's prestige on the world scene as a big power"--a policy
 which "entails a more independent foreign policy course than the
 one the Labor Party was following."  Citing the fact that citizens
 in the 18 to 20 age group were permitted to vote as one factor
 contributing to the outcome, a panelist in the 21 June domestic
 radio roundtable observed that  the majority of British young
 people" opposed U.S. policy in Southeast Asia and voted against
 "the Labor leaders' subservience to U.S. foreign policy."
 Prognostications are avoided in Moscow's typically cautious initial
 comment on the vote.  Panelists in the roundtable broadcast saw
 the defeat of the Labor government as a vote against its positions
 on such issues as NATO and entry into the Common Market--issues
 cited in Moscow's pre-election comment as areas of agreement
 between Laborites and Conservatives.  A 20 June broadcast in
 English tailored for African audiences contained the only speculation
 on a specific foreign policy course of the new regime, seeing as
 "well-grounded" the hopes of South African and Rhodesian
 "racialists" that the Conservative government will "strengthen
 contacts with them, lift the embargo on arms deliveries to South
 Africa, and reopen its mission in the Rhodesian capital."

 MOSCOW SEES NO CHANGE IN BRANDT POLICY DESPITE CDU POLITICKING
 Low-volume Moscow propaganda on the 14 June West German Laender
 elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, and the Saarland
 concentrates on attacking CDU efforts to "torpedo" Brandt's
 Ostpolitik but concludes that these efforts have been largely
 unsuccessful and that the elections will leave Brand.t's policy
 substantially unchanged.
 The size of the CDU vote is traced to the support of voters from
 the "neo-Nazi" NPD.  On this point, commentator Potapov, partici-
 pating in a domestic service roundtable on 21 June, remarked
 that the "revanchist and chauvinistic slogans" used by the CDU
 "were literally copied word for word from the program" of the NPD.
 There is nothing surprising in this, the commentator added, because
 "the neofascists' program and the CDU's political concepts are
 in many ways similar," notably in their demands for "sole
 representation" of the German people and for a revision of the
 results of World War II.
 Potapov said the CDU had leveled "wild attacks" on the "realistic
 aspects" of Brandt's policies toward the problem of strengthening
 European security and broadening relations with the socialist
 countries:  The CDU has in fact attacked "what I would say is
 precisely the encouraging prospects that have opened up lately
 in relations, in particular between the Soviet Union and the
 FRG."  He concluded that the CDU, by "Juggling" the results of
 the elections, seeks to place in doubt the FRG's contacts with
 the Soviet Union and to foil sny possibilities for detente in
 Europe.
 Commenta;ors largely ignore the election setbacks suffered by
 the FDP, the minor party in the coalition, and the possible
 consequences for government policy.  Potapov observed that
 the elections have not brought about any large-scale changes
 in the positions of political forces in the FRG and that Brandt
 and other government leaders have stated that their outcome
 will not influence the political course of the present
 government."  On the 16d;h, the Moscow domestic service had
 briefly reported that Brandt, in remarks to SPD officials,
 had indicated that his government would "continue its course
 rnd strive to achieve its aims."

 An international review article in the 21 June PRAVDA by Ratiani
 Joins Potapov in favorably assessing Brandt Is foreign policy.
 According to Ratiani, Brandt "has been accused of every mortal
 sin merely because a few positive elements have entered his
 government's policy, elements which, should they be developed
 and implemented in practice, would have a favorable effect on
 the European situation."  Leveling a largely pro forma attack
 on the CDU, Ratiani goes on to allege that Washington is
 displeased with Brandt's policies also.  The article cites a
 Washington POST report that some "high-ranking figures in the
 Nixon Administration are alarmed that Brandt might display
 excessive zeal" in his attempts to reach agreement with the
 USSR, Poland, and the GDR.  It goes on to quote from Henry
 Kissinger's "The Troubled Partnership:  A Reapprisal of the
 Atlantic Alliance," which it says reflects the "real position"
 of the White House on the dangers of the FRG's initiating
 "independent" steps toward the GDR.

 EUROPEAN  SECURITY
 BUDAPEST MEETING DISCUSSES PACT'S STAND ON SECURITY CONFERENCE
 The communique on the 21-22 June Budapest meeting of Warsaw Pact
 foreign ministers, released by TASS on the 23d, again endorses
 the long-standing proposal for an "all-European conference" on
 security, noting that "a relevant document was unanimously approved"
 and "will be communicated to the governments of all interested
 states."  Polish Foreign Minister Jedrychowski was reported by the
 Warsaw radio on the 23d as saying that a number of documents "to be
 published in the next few days" would "throw further light on the
 outcome of the conference."
 GDR Foreign Minister Winzer, in remarks carried in East German
 media after his return to Berlin on 23 June, said that the new
 Pact proposals would be circulated among "the European states"
 and then published.  Winzer's use of the term "European states"
 is more restrictive than the communique's "interested states."
 Moscow, for its part, had long been ambiguous and ambivalent on
 the matter of U.S. participation in such a conference.  But a
 foreign ministry spokesman, in a 13 January 1970 press conference,
 said Moscow had informed Washington "of its favorable attitude to
 the participation of the United States in an all-European conference,"
 adding that this view was shared by the other socialist states.
 Soviet propaganda since then has only infrequently broached the
 question of U.S. participation.
 The communique on the Budapest meeting reports that the participants
 exchanged information on bilateral and multilateral contacts held in
 recent months on the question of holding a conference and took note
 of the "positive" response to the proposals put forward in Prague
 last October.  The Prague meeting, the last previous gathering of
 Pact foreign ministers to discuss European security, had set forth
 a two-point agenda for a conference:  renunciation of the use of
 force and the broadening of economic and other ties.
 According to the communique, the Budapest participants stressed
 that direct participation of interested states at all stages of
 preparation for the conference was desirable.  Teking this into
 consideration, the communique concludes, the foreign ministers
 reached agreement on "further important steps" aimed  at insuring
 the success of a conference--steps designed "to achieve agreement
 on an agenda acceptable to all interested states and the methods
 of preparing the all-European conference, which could be started
 in the near future."

 "REACTION" TO    Scant availal  ~ comment from Eastern Europe includes
 NATO MEETING     a 21 June Budapest broadcast which, after noting
 that the Budapest gathering followed the NATO
 Council session in Rome by less than four weeks, commented that "the
 quick reaction shows.in itself that the socialist countries have
 found positive elements in the Rome documents."  The broadcast said
 the Rome meeting marked the first time NATO had gone beyond
 generalities with regard to a Europ ari security conference and
 had replied to the March 1969 initiative of the Warsaw. Pact.
 Moscow propaganda at the time of the NATO meeting, while noting
 that the Italian foreign minister had been given the task of
 circulating that gathering's declaration among interested. countries,
 had portrayed the document as a ruse to delay the convening of a
 European security conference.*
 Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Marko, in remarks reported by CTK
 on the 23d, said that the NATO Council in Rome "could not take
 a negative stand" toward a conference on European security,.
 concluding that "the future will show .  . . whether the approach
 of the NATO countries toward European security and cooperation
 will be more concrete end constructive."
 There has been no Soviet comment on the Budapest session so far.
 Moscow reported the scheduling of the meeting in a brief TASS
 item on 19 June, and confined its treatment of the gathering
 to reportage.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 1?UBCEK AND CERNIK REMOVED FROM LATEST POSITIONS
 The stepped-up drive against the top leaders of the 1968
 liberalization was underscored as Czechoslovak media announced
 the almost simultaneous removal of former CPCZ First Secretary
 Alexander Dubcek and former Premier Oldrich Cernik from their
 latest posts.
 DUBCEK     The Prague domestic service on 24 June said President
 Svoboda "has recalled Alexander Dubcek" from the post
 of Ambassador to Turkey and "entrusted him with another function."
 An Ankara radio report on 30 May, never confirmed by Czechoslovak
 media, said Dubcek had returned to the CSSR that day.  The Ankara
 report took note of reports both that Dubcek, "suspended" from the
 party since January, would be finally expelled and that he had
 returned to visit his ailing mother.
 High-level personal attacks on Dubcek continue in Czechoslovak
 media, presumably setting the stage for the fallen leader's
 expulsion from the party during the current "exchange of party
 cards" and his possible prosecution in a political trial.*  Thus
 a 17 June RUDE PRAVO article by CPCZ international department
 head Pavel Auersperg, commemorating the first anniversary of the
 June 1969 Moscow international party corference, stressed that
 "as a result of the grave errors of Diibcek's leadership" the
 Czechoslovak party was "strongly affected by rightwing opportunism"
 in 1968-69.
 CERNIK     On 23 June, CTK reported that Svoboda had recalled Cernik
 from the minor post of Minister Chairman of the Committee
 for Technical and Investment Development, "at his own request,"
 with no indication of assignment to any other function.  Cernik
 had joined publicly--in a low key--in the denigration of Dubcek
 which led up to the latter's dismissal as party First Secretary
 in April 1969, thus apparently buying time and making possible
 his retention of the premier's post until 28 January 1970, when
 he was succeeded by Strougal and downgraded to his latest position.
 He has not so far been the target of the public vilification
 directed at Dubcek, Smrkovsky, Kriegel, and other more liberal
 leaders of the 1968 experiment.
 *  Western news sources reported on the 23d that Czechoslovak
 Ambassador to Denmark Anton Vasek has asked for political asylum in
 that country for himself and his family, presumably to avoid recall
 and disciplinary action in the current purge.

 EULOGY       The further downgrading of Dubcek and Cernik was
 OF HUSAK preceded, on the 22d, by an unusually fulsome
 personal eulogy of Gustav Husak, in a Prague domestic
 service commentary which noted, among other things, that the CPCZ
 First Secretary is "often compared to Wladyslaw Gomulka and Janos
 Kadar"--other leaders who emerged from internal political upheavals.
 Defensively, the commentary went to considerable lengths to show
 that Husak had been an obstacle to the plans of the "rightist
 opportunists" since the start of the January 1968 reforms and
 had thus been the target of attacks by their press organs.
 SOVIET       Soviet propaganda shows continued circumspection in
 RETICENCE    dealing with events in Czechoslovakia.  Thus a two-
 part serie3 on Czechoslovakia by Mayevskiy in the
 19 and 20 June PRAVDA does not mention either Dubcek or Cernik,
 singling out for attack only Smrkovsky, Kriegel, Mlynar, Spacek,
 and others who have already been finally expelled from the party.

 One significant omiaol.on from the list of deputies is L.N. Yefremov,
 recently removed as Stavropol first secretary to become first deputy
 chairman of the state committee for science and technology.  If
 Yefrcmov's new post does not warrant Suprcme Soviet mr:mbership, it
 probably does not warrant Centrul Committee membership either.
 T.I. Sokolov, removed as Orel first secretary to become Gooplan
 first deputy chairman coincident with Yefremov's transfer, was
 reelected as a deputy.
 Prospects for two of Shelepin's fading proteges appear dim.  Former
 KGB chairman V. Ye. Semichastnyy, now a first deputy premier of the
 Ukraine, was not reelected, unlike the other two Ukrainian first
 deputy premiers, N.A. Sobol and N.T. Kalchenko.  Semic hastnyy's
 successor as Komsomol first secretary, S.P. Pavlov, now chairman
 of the state committee for physical culture and sports, was also
 not reelected to the Supreme Soviet.
 Also dropped from Supreme Soviet membership were two prominei.t
 republican leaders who previously showed no signs of slipping:
 Ukrainian Central Committee Secretary V.I. Drozdenko--the only
 top Ukrainian leader excluded--and RSFSR first deputy premier
 K.G. Pysin.  The other RSFSR first deputy premier, A.M. Shkolnikov,
 was reelected.
 Two recently dismissed high-level propagandists, N.N. Mesyatsev
 and N.A. Mikhaylov (chairman of the r'dio-television committee
 and of the publishing committee, respectively) were not reelected.
 V.I. Stepakov, rumored on the way out as Central Committee
 agitprop chief, also failed to be reelected--unlike most of his
 fellow Central Committee section heads.  There are reports, still
 unconfirmed, that Stepakov and Mesyatsev are to be appointed
 ambassadors, and their omission from the roll of deputies would
 be a natural consequence.

 C C P  R    I 1.D I INCREASED ACTIVITY ON EVE OF 1 JULY PARTY ANNIVERSARY
 On the eve of the 49th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party
 (("CP), to be commemorated on 1 July, there is increased propaganda
 attention to party organs and party rebuilding.          Several provincial-
 level conferences on party rebuilding are reported, mention is
 made of provincial party core groups in the northeast area, Kirin
 forms Its i'irot county-level party committee, and Peking refers
 openly for the first time since the Ninth Congress to a reorganized
 party committee at the municipal level.
 Provincial meetings on party rebuilding have been reported by
 Heiiungkiang and Kwangtung, the only provinces to claim rebuilt
 municipal-level party committees, and seem aimed at providing
 new party-building achievements to celebrate the CCP anniversary.
 A 12 June Harbin radio report on Heilungkiang's 12 May-1 June
 conference on party building, which was conducted by the
 provincial party core group, warned that efforts to rebuild
 the party still faced possible obstruction both from the right,
 opponents of "the mass line," and from the left, those who
 negate the party by overemphasizing the mass line.  Canton radio
 on 14 June reported that the Provincial Revolutionary Committee--
 not the party core group--conducted the Kwangtung conference,
 which was attended by leadership cadres of special districts,
 counties, and municipalities.
 Earlier, on 23 May, NCNA reported a provincial-level conference
 in Hunan on party rebuilding, and on 29 April the Hupeh radio
 reported a provincial telephone conference on the subject.  In
 mid-June, Tsinghai, Hannan, and Shensi reported provincial-level
 directives calling for new mass campaigns to study the party
 constitution.
 KIRIN COUNTY     On 17 June the Changchun radio, announcing the
 COMMITTEE        formation of the Huaite county party committee,
 stated that Wang Huai-hsiang, chairman of the
 Provincial Revolutionary Committee (PRC) and "leader of the CCP
 core group" of the PRC, attended the Huaite county congress which
 elected the new committee.  A KIRIN DAILY editorial, also broad-
 cast on 17 June, welcomed "the first county-level leading organ
 of the party established in our province according to the new
 party constitution."  Condemning those who mistakenly separate
 "the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Centra.L Committee"

 from basic-level party organizations and "regard the basic-level
 party organizations as something dispensable," the editorial
 dismissed such thoughts as incorrect and reflective of a "weak
 party concept."  It warned that basic-level party organizations,
 "especially those below the county level," are vital because
 without them "party leadership will become ineffective."
 While provincial-level party core groups, presumably the fore-
 runners of provincial party committees, have also been mentioned
 in recent broadcasts from Kwangtung, Heilungkiang, Tsinghai,
 Shantung, and Shensi, the Kirin broadcast is the first to
 s,.iecify that the PRC chairman is also head of the party group.
 (,Shantung recently identified a number of members of its core
 group, inc!,:ding presumed acting chairman Yang Te-chih, but
 without specifying relative ranking.  In 1967, Shansi and
 Tsinghai broadcasts had stated explicitly that the chairman
 and first vice chairman of their PRC's served also as head
 and deputy head of the core groups.)
 CITY-LEVEL    On 13 June, suddenly overcoming its apparent
 COMMITTEE     inhibitions against publicizing rebuilt party
 committees above the basic level, Radio Peking
 praised the Maoming municipal CCP committee in Kwangtung
 Province for its work in industrial coordination.  Originally
 welcomed by Canton radio  on 1 February, the municipal
 committee had not been mentioned in central media. As
 recently as 2 June, in a similar report on Maoming activities,
 NCNA spoke only of the leadership of the municipal revolu-
 tionary committee, although a Canton radio account of the
 same activities lauded the municipal party committee.
