 ISRAEL:   The fedayeen attack on the Israeli town
 of Qiryat Shemona yesterday is likely to elicit Is-
 raeli reprisals against fedayeen strongholds in south-
 ern Lebanon.                                Tel Aviv recently has avoided such re-
 prisals lest they endanger peace negotiations;  the
 government will probably not allow political consid-
 erations to deter action in this case because of the
 substantial number of Israeli civilian casualties.

 The Popular Front: for the Liberation of Pales-
 tine - General Command, a small terrorist group based
 in Lebanon, has claimed responsibility for the attack.
 25X1
 The General Command is not a constituent member
 of the Palestine Liberation organization, nor is it
 closely tied to any Arab government.   However, it
 receives some financial and operational support from
 Libya,  Iraq,  and private Persian Gulf sources.

 USSR:   Academician Sakharov, in a retort to
 exile  novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn on April 3,
 has moved away from total confrontation with the re-
 gime.                              He now supports detente while still dissenting
 on the lack of democratization in the Soviet Union.
 His new position provides a badly needed focal point.
 for reformist forces in Soviet society and finds pa.r-
 t.i.a1 common ground with the "modernizers" in the
 regime itself.
 The text of the statement, issued in response
 to Solzhenitsyn's "Letter to the Soviet Leaders"
 last September, is not yet available in Washington.
 The US Embassy, which has read it, sees it as an
 elaboration of the dialogue developing in dissident,
 ranks, differentiating the inward-looking orthodox
 nationalists  (Solzhenitsyn)  from the outward-looking
 modernists  (Sakharov, Roy Medvedev, et al,).   The em-
 bassy reads this dialogue as a reflection of the
 divergence in Soviet society between the Westward-
 looking modernizers at one end of the spectrum and
 the conservative, isolationist nationalists at the
 other.
 It is possible to see these two strains of
 thought, also reflected in the different degrees of
 enthusiasm for detente among Soviet leaders and in
 the contradictions of Soviet policy.   Thus, the re-
 gime is encouraging Western-style modernization
 through detente, while trying to maintain all bar-
 riers against, democratizationo   Sakharov adopted a.
 very dangerous strategy last year when he divorced
 himself from all aspects of the regime's policy by
 arguing against trade unless it was accompanied by
 democratization.   Now in supporting detente--albeit
 ultimately for reasons of democratization--he moves
 back closer to official opinion and his words gain
 added weight.
 According to the embassy, Sakharov has provided
 a strong and balanced counterargument to Solzheni.-
 t.syn's views on the future development of Soviet--and
 for So.lzhenit.syn principally Russian--society.

 While Solzhenitsyn disdains scientific progress and
 plumps for a simple, authoritarian society based on
 Russian nationalism and the ideas of the Russian
 Orthodox Church, Sakharov rejects mysticism and over-
 emphasis on ideology, and argues in practical terms
 for harnessing science to serve and better the lot
 of mankind and for expanding the contacts between
 the Soviet Union and the West.
 Sakharov sees no absolute good in Russian tradi-
 tional values, in contrast to Solzhenitsyn's mystical
 belief in them, and argues that Soviet democratic
 activists should be equally concerned about the sup-
 pression of non-Russian peoples in the Soviet Union.
 He takes Solzhenitsyn to task for his view that an
 authoritarian system, based on the benevolent patri-
 archy of the church, would be most suitable and
 healthy for the country.   Sakharov states his belief
 that only in a democratic system can national and
 human character be developed fully.  He sees no in-
 surmountable barriers to the possibilities for demo-
 cratic development, either in Russian history or in
 the Russian character.
 Sakharov is particularly hard on Solzhenitsyn
 for arguing that Russia needs to pull away from the
 evil influence of the West and to develop itself in
 splendid and simple isolation.  He reasons that the
 world's problems are so immense that one nation can-
 not solve them alone, and he mentions a variety of
 issues ranging from disarmament to environmental
 protection in which international cooperation is
 essential.   Sakharov makes a strong case, in this
 respect, for expanded trade, scientific and cultural
 exchanges,  free travel into and outside the country,
 and free movement of people and ideas across national
 boundaries.   He relates this to the development of a
 more democratic system in the Soviet Union, and
 brings in his theory of the convergence of Soviet. and
 Western societies to argue that both voluntary meas-
 ures and outside pressures can act as catalysts for
 beneficial change.

 EC-SYRIA:   Syrian officials have expressed strong
 interest in establishing formal links with the European
 Community.   During EC Commissioner Cheysson's recent
 visit to Damascus, the Syrians declared that they were
 prepared for immediate negotiations to broaden economic
 cooperation with the community.
 Syrian interest in ties with the EC may reflect
 President Asad's efforts to balance off the heavy
 Soviet economic presence with Western aid.   Syria has
 struck a number of bilateral deals with the West since
 the last major Soviet credit agreement in 1972.   Now
 that other Arab states have granted Syria considerable
 financial aid, Damascus may be interested in negotiat-
 ing additional multilateral. development projects.   Com-
 mission sources in Brussels report that the Syrians
 offered the EC a long list of projects from which to
 choose.
 Until recently, the Syrians have shown little
 interest in EC efforts to formulate an overall policy
 that would give the Mediterranean states preferential
 access to community markets and provide development
 aid.   During Cheysson's visit, however,  Syrian officials
 expressed great interest in the present status of the
 EC's Mediterranean policy and particularly the status
 of negotiations with the Maghreb countries.
 Syrian officials insisted that Cheysson sign a
 document on behalf of the commission that would express
 understanding for Syria's desire to reach agreement
 with the community on preferential access to community
 markets;  technical, scientific,  and industrial coop-
 eration;                                and EC financial participation in Syrian de-
 velopment projects.   Although Cheysson had no mandate
 to negotiate and had expected only informal discussions,
 he signed the document because it merely embodied the
 outline of existing EC Mediterranean policy.
 The commission may propose to the EC Council that
 formal exploratory talks be opened with both Syria and
 Jordan, but the timing of such a step is not clear,

 The community's negotiations with the Maghreb states
 and with Spain and Israel have been stalemated by
 differences among the Nine.   EC agreements with these
 states will probably not be concluded before fall
 at the earliest, and EC talks with eastern Mediter-
 ranean Arab states will not be permitted to get ahead
 of the negotiations with the western Mediterranean
 countries.

 *BELGIUM:   Negotiations for a new Belgian Govern-
 ment broke down last night over the sensitive issues
 of regional autonomy and educational reform.   Formateur
 Leo Tindemans will report to the King today.
 Reports earlier this week indicated that Tinde-
 mans' powerful Social Christian Party had reached
 tentative agreement with the Socialists on these and
 other crucial issues.   A new two-party coalition was
 expected to be in office by Easter.   A strong element
 within the Socialist Party, however, may have forced
 the Socialist negotiators to make demands that were
 known to be unacceptable to the Social Christians.
 If Tindemans is unable to bring the Socialists
 back to the negotiating table, he may attempt to form
 a minority government with the conservative Liberal
 Party.   This could be done if he had the formal or
 the tacit support of the linguistic parties, but it
 would create serious strains among the Social Chris-
 tians.                             Such a coalition would be highly unstable.

 *UGANDA:   President Idi Amin may be losing con-
 trol of the Ugandan Army to the factions that opposed
 him in the fighting which took place on March 23-24.
 Amin's opponents are predominantly Christians? and
 many belong to the Lugbara and Madi tribes.   They ap-
 pear to have emerged in a stronger position than first
 appeared to be the case from last month's clashes with
 soldiers from Amin's Kakwa tribe and allied tribesmen
 brought in from Sudan.   Amin's opponents forced him
 to dismiss Brigadier Husayn Malera as acting army chief
 of staff   and are now pressing him for further conces-
 sions.
 Amin reportedly brought a contingent of 400 Lib-
 yan troops into Uganda early this week, presumably to
 serve as a bodyguard.   Libyan President Qadhafi sent
 Libyan troops to aid Amin in late 1972, at which time
 serious friction developed between Libyan and Ugandan
 soldiers.   If 400 Libyan troops have in fact arrived,
 their presence may further anger the Ugandan soldiers.
 Mounting tensions may spur a spontaneous assas-
 sination attempt against Amin which, if successful,
 almost certainly would touch off extensive fi htincr
 between tribally based factions in the army.

 *ETHIOPIA:   There have been further outbreaks of
 unrest among security forces and labor groups as these
 elements press the government for action on their de-
 mands for the dismissal of corrupt officials and for
 wage increases.
 Police units in recent days have stepped up their
 protests against unpopular officers, harsh working
 conditions, and maladministration.   Enlisted men in the
 port city of Massawa,,on the Red Sea coast, arrested
 their officers on April 8.   Members of a police unit
 in Harar Province temporarily held their officers cap-
 tive earlier this week and forced the appointment of a
 new commanding officer.   Police at two other locations
 in Harar have expressed dissatisfaction with their of-
 ficers.
 Junior officers and NCOs of the Tenth Mechanized
 Brigade in Jijiga, the army's most prestigious unit,
 have held the city since April 9 and have arrested
 several senior officers and some customs officials for
 alleged corruption.   The dissidents are also unhappy
 with their recently appointed commander.   The mechanized
 brigade's action, after the Third Division successfully
 forced the removal of the deputy chief of staff last
 weekend, indicates the military is demonstrating its
 strength as a reminder to the government not to falter
 in carrying out promised changes.

 CHINA:   Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping's speech
 to the special session of the UN General Assembly
 on April 10 broke little new ground and essentially
 restated moderate themes that have characterized
 China's description of the international situation
 for several years.   Detente with the US emerged
 intact, and Teng reserved his fire for the USSR,
 which he denounced in uncompromising terms.   Teng
 stated that the current political campaign in China
 was intended to prevent China from becoming an ag-
 gressive "superpower," thus implying that foreigners
 should not interpret the campaign as an ominous de-
 velopment.   Throughout the speech, Teng echoed Chou
 En-lai's analysis of international affairs as the
 Premier had described them in the keynote address
 to the Tenth Party Congress last August.
 The special session of the assembly obviously
 affords China an ideal forum in which to emphasize
 solidarity with Third World nations, and Teng took
 full advantage of the occasion to curry favor among
 the "have-not" states, explicitly placing China it-
 self in that category.
 He attacked both superpowers for using their
 economic strength to "plunder" the Third World and
 retard its economic development.   Hewing to the now-
 standard Chinese analysis, he attributed the unrest
 in the world to the superpowers, accusing them of
 competing for hegemony throughout the world.   Teng
 focused his attack, however, on the USSR, which he
 singled out as being especially vicious, unscrupu-?
 lous, perfidious, and self-seeking.   All Teng's
 examples of superpower misdeeds referred to the
 USSR.   His criticism of the US was generally indi-
 rect and the mildest possible under the circumstances.
 While this expresses a standard Chinese line, Teng's
 harsh criticism of the Soviets was also intended to
 remind Third World countries that their attention
 during the special session should be directed toward
 the Soviets as well as toward the developed coun-
 tries of the West.

 There was no hint in the speech that domestic
 criticism of accepting foreign aid and technology,
 which has surfaced during the political campaign in
 China, had forced a change in Chinese policy.  While
 re-emphasizing standard Chinese views on the neces-
 sity for self-reliance in economic development, Teng
 pointedly cautioned that self-reliance does not mean
 "self-seclusion" and rejection of foreign aid.
 Rather, such assistance and trade, if equitably ar-
 ranged, were characterized as beneficial and necessary
 for the development of independent national economies.
 Teng asserted that US-Soviet detente was a myth
 overshadowed by the larger fact of superpower
 rivalry, and that balanced reduction of forces and
 strategic arms limitation "are nothing but empty
 talk."  By reasserting this line Teng was indirectly
 reaffirming that the policy of improved relations
 with the US remains viable.
 Reflecting Peking's anger at Soviet efforts to
 arrange a world Communist meeting that will almost
 certainly be directed against China, Teng attempted
 to blunt any ideological criticism that might emerge
 in such a meeting by declaring that the USSR's shift
 to "social imperialism" means that the "socialist
 camp" no longer exists.
 Teng combined his exposition on superpower
 rivalry
 with strong support of Third World economic
 goals,
 but
 in general terms that contained few spe-
 cifics.
 He
 aligned China with demands for higher
 prices
 for
 the underdeveloped countries' raw mate-
 rials,
 national control of resources and economies
 "up to
 and
 including" nationalization, and a "thorough
 change" in international economic relations.   He ex-
 plicitly endorsed Arab use of the "oil weapon" as a
 good example of what developing countries must do to
 fight imperialism, and suggested that nations pro-
 ducing raw materials form organizations similar to
 OPEC.

 If Teng's speech was a major effort at align-
 ing China with Third World goals, his treatment of
 Europe and the oil weapon demonstrated a keen sense
 of the pitfalls inherent in the use of economic
 weapons and calls for struggles by poor nations
 against the rich.   Expanding an idea long inherent
 in Chinese policy, Teng explicitly placed the in-
 dustrial nations of Europe and Japan in a special
 category between the superpowers and the Third World,
 pointing out that Europe is the focus of superpower
 hegemony.   He played down  the "rich-vs-poor nation"
 theme and focused instead on national control of
 economies as an indispensable part of national sov-
 ereignty.                                 In endorsing the oil. weapon, Teng cau-
 tioned that Third World unity must be preserved and
 that equitable economic relations must be maintained
 among the developing countries.

 CHINA:   The latest People's Daily editorial re-
 iterates the call for a reasoned, controlled approach
 to the anti-Lin, anti-Confucius campaign, but seem-
 ingly unauthorized attacks on provincial leaders con-
 tinue to spread.
 Recent travelers have observed political wall
 posters criticizing a number of provincial party lead-
 ers, almost all of whom are military men.   The most
 recent observations add several names to the growing
 list of leaders who have been attacked this year.
 Four of the eight individuals involved in the rotation
 of regional commanders last December have now been
 censured in their former provincial bases.   The post-
 ers, which have been reported in at least six prov-
 inces, apparently continue to violate Central Commit-
 tee directives issued earlier this year against crit-
 icism of individuals by name.   Nonetheless, the impetus
 for the poster attacks almost certainly comes from
 elements in Peking.
 The initial wave of poster attacks, like the
 criticisms of two politically offensive operas, ap-
 peared to be attempts by Chiang Ching, Mao's wife,
 and her radical associates to reorient the course of
 the anti-Lin, anti-Confucius campaign.   The assaults
 on provincial figures may now have broadened to the
 point where both her allies and her opponents are
 involved.
 For the first time, the poster criticisms name
 a ranking Peking leader who was the army's top polit-
 ical commissar.   Party Vice Chairman Li Te-sheng, who
 was transferred to head the Shenyang Military Region,
 was attacked as a follower of Lin Piao in Anhwei, Li's
 bailiwick during the Cultural Revolution.   Another first
 is the reported criticism of Kiangsu Province leaders
 by the leading mass organizations there--the trade
 union federation, youth league, peasants'  association,
 and the like.   A few attempts to pass the initiative
 for criticism to former Red Guard groups do not seem
 to have any steam behind them.

 It is becoming more evident that as the anti-Lin,
 anti-Confucius campaign progresses, elements in both
 the provinces and Peking are striving for control of
 the movement.   Some posters in Kiangsu accuse provin-
 cial leaders there of having arrested a number of
 individuals for putting up wall posters, and the cur-
 rent spate of attacks in that province may have been
 triggered by this incident.
 Posters in Fukien Province criticizing Han Hsien-
 chu, the former boss of that province who was transferred
 to northwest China at the end of last year, may have been
 inspired by more authoritative elements than those re-
 sponsible for the attacks on Li Te-sheng and other offi-
 cials in east China.   A recent article in the party
 theoretical journal Red Fly, which seems to point: an
 accusatory finger at Han,  gives some official weight
 to the charges against him.   Han has not appeared pub-
 licly in his new district since the beginning of the
 year.
 Political wounds inflicted during the Cultural
 Revolution and its immediate aftermath are also being
 reopened.  An important theme raised in at least two
 provinces concerns the so-called 516 Group,  an ult.ra-
 leftist organization that was the object of a nation-
 wide investigation and purge between early 1970 and
 the Lin crisis in September 1971.   Leaders in Shantung
 and Kiangsu are being accused of using the 516 inves-
 tigation to purge the wrong persons.   The political
 left may have raised the 516 question as a means not
 only to criticize provincial power-holders but also
 to push for rehabilitation of extremists purged at the
 end of the Cultural Revolution.   Thus far this issue
 seems to focus on internecine quarrels at the provin-
 cial level, but the fact that it has been raised in
 more than one province suggests that local malcontents
 may have been encouraged by elements in Peking.
 The question of rehabilitation, however,  is a
 double-edged sword.   At both the national and provin-
 cial levels, it has been used thus far to resurrect
 party officials purged in the initial stages of the
 Cultural Revolution--to the discomfiture of the polit-
 ical left.

 The criticisms of provincial leaders are consis-
 tent with an ongoing effort to reduce the political
 power of the military, but they clearly involve much
 more.   The immediate issue of who is to hold political
 power in the countryside is an integral part of the
 power struggle in Peking, which includes criticisms
 of the moderate policy line of the past few years.
 This contest will have a   important effect on the suc-
 cession to Mao and Chou.                                           25X1
 AUSTRALIA:   Nearly 95 percent of Australia's
 wheat available for export this year has been committed.
 Canberra now has less than 500,000 tons left from the
 7.4 million tons available to the wheat board for com-
 mercial export.                                  An additional 225,000 tons have been
 reserved for food aid.
 Australia, the world's third largest wheat ex-
 porter, has been able to supply its usual customers
 but has little left for new ones.   Egypt, Japan,  and
 China have purchased about 1 million tons each, and
 other Asian countries accounted for most of the rest.
 While world production of wheat is expected to
 increase this year, the market is likely to remain
 tight.   World stocks are low and,  as a result,  local-
 ized shortfalls will have to be met from current pro-
 duction.                                  Now that Australia is effectively out of the
 wheat market until the next crop year, which begins
 in December, buyers must s'      to other major suppliers,
 such as the US and Canada.
 Spain-USSR:   Madrid is negotiating with the USSR
 for purchase of uranium-enrichment services worth more
 than $200 million.   If concluded,  the deal would be
 Moscow's largest enrichment arrangement with a Western
 country.   A contract is expected to be signed in mid-
 April; delive i s would begin in 1978 and continue
 through 1990.
