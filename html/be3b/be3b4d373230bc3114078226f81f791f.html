SUMMARY 
Austerity Committees and People's Tribunals work diligently to settle corruption cases; 
workers are urged to help their employers restore production and State comparies to give 
busineSs to private firms, and businessmen are offered refunds on taxes and fines if only 
they will get business back to normal. Yet despite this anxiety to have done with the 
anticorruption drive, the apparent No. 1 aim of the broadcasting stations is to convince 
listeners that the drive has strengthened both capital and labor. Workers are c:redited 
with improving techniques, becorrt'ng more efficient, and achieving a higher plane by 
becoming "supervisors" of their employers. "Model accusers" and 4mode1 informers" who 
were rewarded with promotions are represented as accomplishing miracles in business, 
though it was admitted only a few weeks ago that many of them were unable to "handle their 
new jobs. Workers are promised higher wages, new houses, and better living corglItions from 
the gains of the drive. The need for new houses is apparent from a EUnming admission 
that "no regular housing is available" for 90 percent of the city's workers; further 
disappointment may be in store, for in the Northeast higher housing allowances now are 
offset by higher rents. 
One noticeable result of the drive is the rising iqportance of the Youth Corps, which has 
strengthened its membership with thousands Of enthusiastic anticorruption workers,, many 
of them now assigned to Government positions, and seems to have assumed the tecelr of 
supervising capital through its nevmembers. Many of these are given special courses in 
business, along with political indoctrination. Another obvious result of the drive is 
the disclosure of inefficiency among State trading companies, which in some areas fulfilled 
only 80 percent of their 1951 contracts. A tightening of controls over these concerns 
is seen, with all major purchasing to be done through Central GOvernment agencies and

Cadres get their Lionel quota of criticism for farm ills, especially in the Southwest, 
where in one district they distributed loans equally among all farmers, irrespective 
of need, and where drorght, flood, insects, and livestock disease are serious. 'Even 
more serious is the farm situation in southern Kiangsup where only about half the 
cotton land is under .cultivation. Medical workers are singled out for special censure, 
as they do not want to work for State organs; schools are accused of being reactionary; 
and new attacks on missionaries are disclosed.

-promote" the anticorruption drive. Wuhsi reported (May 12) that in mobilizing 
its forces to persuade corrupt merchants to confess the Wuhsi Women's Democratic 
League had called together family members of the merchants to hold discussions 
until the corrupt elements were ready to confess. In this way the owner of the 
Chungming Machine Shop was prevailed upon to confess and seek leniency. 
Anshan announced Nay 18) that 19 active shop clerks had been taken into the local 
Youth Corps at a ceremony May 80 after which a rally was held May 13 to "strengthen

that production could be encouraged." Shanghai said (May 13) that at a meeting 
of all circles in Tsinan the Mayor declared that all private traders would be 
given lenient treatment if they were willing to increase production, promised 
that corrupt elements would not be fined if they agreed to confess and resume 
production, but asserted that those who refused to confess would be fined heavily. 
Hangchow declared Nay 13) that the local Austerity Committees in the city were 
reviewing thr cases of firms whose corruption had been adjudicated, with the 
idea of granting greater leniency. The case of textile merchant Jen Yeh-chai 
was reopened and the firm reclassified as law-abiding because Jen war -Tilling 
to invest more capital and encourage production, although he had formerly 
obstructed the drive and had been given a heavy sentence. Chang Shui-chien0

the percentage of defective goods "in order to help the mill owners." Hangchow 
reported Nay 14) that the Hangchow People's Tribunal May 12 sentenced Kho I-jen

Wuhsien, Kiangsul workers in the transport, hardware, textile, and food trades were 
expediting investigations in order to adjudicate rapidly all corruption cases, with 
105 cases being investigated under the five-antits program and 3,000 adjudications 
already completed. Yangchow stated (May 15) that in Nantung, Kiangsu, 3,646 firms now

Gains from Anticorruption Drive. Peking reported in numeral code (May 13) that as a 
result of the anticorruption drive officials in the State-owned Kalgan Mining 
Equipment Co* now consulted the workers in mapping production plans, had installed 
requisition, inventory, and operational systems to eliminate waste, and had increased 
production 28 percent. The anticorruption drive had disclosed that the company 
operated without any definite procedure, filed work plans without consulting them: 
was regularly short of materials and loaded down with lead stock: regularly wreckea 
machines by overloading and operating at high speeds, and wasted enough in the past 
3 years to pay for construction of a new factory* 
Dairen asserted (May 18) that the norms at the No. 2 Power Plant had been raised 300 
percent after progressive cadres had demonstrated that older workers were wrong in

increasing their capital and putting in more machinery, as well as allowing workers 
to inspect their books and offer suggestions. Shanghai stated (May 12) that in Taengtao 
the Hsin Bin and Nin Pen Flour Mills had improved production both qualitatively and 
quantitatively after the anticorruption drive had led workers to sign new compents. 
Shanghai said (May 17) that the Nanking Railway Administration had improved pro; tion 
because of the promotion of active cadres to positions of leadership and had 
established a record of 10 minutes in crossing from Hsiakuan to Pukou. 
Peking said in numeral code (May 12) that in Canton the success of the anticorruption 
drive led to worker-capital consultative meetings and increased production. The canton 
Textile Factory No. 2 set a new production record in February; production in the copper 
department of the Chieho Iron and Steel Factory for February and March was 25 percent 
higher than in November and December, with a drop of 70 percent in defective goods; and 
rice processors had increased their productivity efficiency 20-30 percent. Anshan asserted 
(May 14) that a "new atmosphere" pervaded the Bureau of Industry Machine Factory because 
of dismissal of the director, production section chief, and accounting section chief: 
"promotion of a number of enthusiastic workers," and resulting new production records.

manager of the China Good Company's Hsincheng Rice Mill at Chiathsing, Chekiang, had 
refused to cooperate with the morkers, causing frequent shut-downs. and mechanical diffi-
culties that led to huge Government losses. During the anticorruption drive the Ansterity 
Committee removed the manager and replaced him with Ling Chi-seng, with the result that 
the factory now was increasing production. 
Shanghai stated (May 12) that with adjudication of corruption cases and increased super-

Withal reported (May 18) that the owners of the Chengmei Pharmacy of WUhaien lost interest

capital in the busineas. Wuhan asserted (day.13) that workers in Canten no held regular
