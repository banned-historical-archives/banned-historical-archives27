SECTION I. SUMMARY OF FAR EAST TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS 
Recent propaganda broadcasts to Southeast Asia have highlighted the 
Chinese Communiste interest both in Overseaa Chinese oommunities and in 
growing nationalism in that area (p. 2). 
In Japan,, the YOSHIDA Government has maneuvered SCAR into the position 
of "directing" that unpopular measures be incorporated in the new budget 
(P0 3)i. 
President Rhee has followed up his announced intentions of last 
fortnight and relieved Lee Bum Stile as Korean Minister of Defense (pr, 4). 
Both Nationalists and Communists have named 5-man delegations to 
the Chinese peace conference scheduled for 1 April in Peeping. The 
quality of Premier HO's new cabinet, selected with the impending peace 
conference in mind, leaves much to be desired (p. 5). 
The commander of the French forces in Tonkin has stated that the 
French military position in northern Indochina is precarious (p. 7)4 
' Premier Phibul's failure to remove General Kaoh from his position 
of authority in the Siamese Ay mayprecipitate renewed disorders (p. B).

SECTION II. DEVELOPMENTS IN SPECIFIED AREAS 
General 
Chinese Communists o a endive Southeast Asia. In two significant North 
ensi eroadoasts as week, t e nese Communist Party (CCP) has 
demcnstrated increasing interest in nationalist movements and Chinese 
minorities in Southeast Asia. A CCP appeal to the Indonesians, trans-
mitted on 21 March, suggested that they avail themselves of "correet 
leadership" in their struggle for liberation and outlined the CCP formula 
whereby the success achieved in China might be duplicate,/ elsewhere in 
%eta. The formula three points, as detailed, wares (1) formation of a 
ulited front within the country; (2) establishment of an international 
united front with other anti-imperialist forces, particularly the USSR; 
and (3) development of a strong Communist Party. The ctr broadcast 
further characterized present Republican leaders as "old bureaucrats", 
"oompradore bourgeoisie" and "fascist stooges of the Japanese". 
At this time, when Indonesian extremists are gaining popular support 
at the expense of Republican moderates, such CCP propaganda might well 
make a deep impression. Such attempts at the extension of a Communist 
influence highlight the deairability of an immediate restoration of 
Republican leaders to thein former positions of authority (see p. 9)e 
The second CCP broadcast, on 24 March, quoted Marshal LI Chi-shen, 
Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee leader, as protesting against "the 
brutal persecution ce Overseas Chinese in Malaya---by the French aggressors 
in Vietnam and by the Fascist governments of the Philippines and Siam." 
The CCP radio went on to threaten leaders of Overseas Chinese communities 
who were still loyal to the Kuomintang, saying that unless they "immediately 
stop playing the role of flunkies of imperialists...(they),-..wilI receive 
due punishment from the Peoples* Government." In exchange for loyalty to 
the CCP, Overseas Chinese were assured that the New China will rive them 
strong support againet the oppressive actions of local governments. 
Overseas Chineve in Southeast Asia total some nine million and their 
wealth and influence is out of all proportion to their numbers. They 
rarely assimilate and their continued loyalty to China is largely non-
political. Control of the Overseas Chinese would be a major political 
and economic asset to the CCP t "spiritual leadership" of Southeast Aaials 
discontented nationalists eould be an even greater CC? asset. Chinese 
Communist propaganda can be expected to press aggressively torards both 
goals,

o a a e so me w o wou d ncresse Japanese textile exports while 
adding to the US strategies materials stoekpile. Dutch authorities in 
Indonesia need some $60 millioneorth of Japanese textiles but have only 
$66 million set aside for that purpose. Additional ECP. funds Which could 
have closed the gap have become unavailable as a result of the Netherlands 
"police aetion." SCAP has proposed, therefore, that the ITS Rureau of 
Federal Supply increase its rubber purchase program in Indonesia with the 
Dutch reopiving Japanese textiles as payment for the extra purchase's. 
iThile this triangular trade system woeld help both to lessen the tin

JAPAN 
Conservatives resist SOAP bud et ro)osals. Preparation of the Japanese 
tutge or 4- e a ng sca year s prov ding an indication of increasing 
Japanese Government resistance to direction from SOAP. 
The YOSHIDA cabinet was committed by campaign promises to economic 
measures favoring the vested conservative interests supporting the 
Democratic Liberal Party. Prominent among these aims were: abolition or 
economic controls within the extent permitted by the nine-point econmio 
Program, revision of taxation, discontinuance of the transaction tax, and 
government assistance toward Japanese recovery, On the other hand, Josoeh 
Dodge, SOAP'S financial advisor, believes that eueb measures cannot be 
reconciled with Japan's straitened economic conditions? SCAP's recommended 
budget provitiones first offered as "seggestion," aroused a storm of 
controversy among Democratic Liberal leaders; especially those Of the 
ultra-conservative factioree. Resorting to procrastination, the Party 
succeeded in putting off e final decision on the budget until somethine 
more decisive than a "sugeention" came down from SCAP, Last week, Dodge 
"directed" the Japanese Government to have a budget inoorporeting his 
proposals prepared for presentation to the Diet by 10 Aprile

JCP in recent local elections has boon trying to capitalize on the 
remarkable shoeing made in the January national elections, uhenAt

on Korea UNCOK has officially received a petition signed by 63 of the

ardent nationalist petitioners who still naively believe that -a Bette-
factory nen-Conmunist solution for Korean unification can be found if the 
US and the USSR withdraw completely and leave the Koreans to their cion 
devices. His latest move in appealing to UNC(Z to enflame US troop vitb-

sity Rbeevs determination to restrict UNOOK's freedom of contact with the 
Korean neople.

Cabinet change, named Shin Sung Mo, former Minister of Home Affairs, to 
replace Lee Bum Suk as Defence Minister last week. (See Bin Veekly - 
#34.) Lee retained his post as Prime Minister. 
Shin Sung MO served for many years as a master in the British merch-
ant merino and probably will give increased attention to the neglected 
Korean. Coast Guard. Shin is sup)osed to have been a tee man when he 
returned to Keene in 1948, but his principal loyalty now appears to be to 
President Rhee ,ho has evidenced implicit faith in Shlnifs integrity and 
ability, During his brief tenure as Hem Minister, Shin acquired the 
reputation of being an able administrator and has impressed US officials 
as one of Rhee's most capable Cabinet members. 
The Home Ministry vacancy was filled by the former deputy, Kim HYo 
SA, a Democratic Nationalist. This move probably will satisfy the 
National Assembly recommendation for a full time Defense Minister as rell 
as Democratic Nationalist Party demands for greater Cabinet representation.

..CRET 
CHINA 
Peace negotiations to begin on 1 April!! Following the appointment 
of five Nationalist peace delegates by Acting President LI Tsung-jen's 
Cabinet, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) named its own five delegates 
last week and agreed to begin peace negotiations on 1 April in Peiping. 
The CCP also announced that its Central Committee had approved Chair-
man MAO Tse-tung's "'eight demands" as a basis for discussions, and 
notified the "Nanking reactionary government" to send with its delegates 
"All pertinent data" concerning those demands. 
The leading figures of the Nationalist delegation are SHAO Li-tze, 
onetime Ambassador to Moscow and CHANG Chih-chung, director of Nationalist 
Northwest Headquarters recently active in promoting a Sino-Soviet trade 
agreement in Sinkiang. Both have long advocated a negotiated peace. 
CHOU En-lai, a shrewd and adroit diplomat who has previously represented 
the CCP in peace talks with the Nationalists and was the chief Com-
munist negotiator during General Marshall's mediation mission, 
heads the CCP delegation. LIN Piao, whose "Northeast People's Liberation 
Army" took Manchuria from the Nationalist Government and assisted in 
forcing the capitulation of Tientsin and Peiping is another negotiator. 
LIN, in a recent speech, reaffirmed the CCP's intention to control 
all of China, and stated that the. CCP while welcoming the "Peiping 
formula" of negotiated peace, is prepared to resort to the "Tientsin 
method" of military assault. Other CCP delegates are: (1) Gen. YEH 
Chien-ying, director of the Military Control Committee which rules 
Peiping and former head of the CCP's branch of Peiping Executive Head-
quarters during the Marshall mission; (2) LIN Po-chu, former Chairman 
of the CCP's Shensi-Kansu-Ninghsia Border Government; and (3) LI Wei-
han, a member of the CCP delegation in Nanking during the Marshall 
mission. CCP Chairman MAO has transferred his headquarters and those 
of the Central Committee to Peiping and presumably will supervise the 
CCP's delegates. 
The Nanking Government cannot possibly comply in full with MAO's 
eight demands. It can comply in full, if it wishes, with five: 
abrogation of the Constitution, relinquishment of the Kuomintang's 
prerogatives, endorsement of Communist "agrarian reform," cancellation 
of "traitorous treaties" and convocation of a political consultative 
conference to transfer power to a "coalition" government. Nanking can 
comply in part with two other demands: surrender of "war criminals" 
and confiscation of "bureaucratic capital 7 but many of the "war criminals" 
and much of China's monetary resources are inaccessible to the Nanking 
Government. The eighth demand--for "reorganization" of Nationalist 
armies-is the crucial one. By this, the CCP means simply the surrender 
and subsequent inclusion of all Nationalist forces in the CCP army. Even 
if the negotiators should promise to deliver the Nationalist armies for

"reorganization," the Nanking Government does not have the power to 
deliver any significant part of the remaining anti-Communist troops 
in China, Thus the CCP will either: (1) settle for the partial com-
pliance of LI's government with its demands and thereafter move its 
armies south to begin the complete realization of all by threate or 
(2) force the negotiations to break down by insisting on compliance 
with all demands and thereafter resume actual military operationa, 
Premier HO or anises a weak "Peece" cabinet HO Ying-chin's 
newly appointed cabinet, while giving the appearance of greater unity 
to LI Tsung-jen's government, is lacking in administrative competence, 
although many able administrators declined offers of cabinet posts, 
LI strengthened his regional support to a limited extent by the 
inclusion of leaders of the Kwangtung and Shansi'Suiyuan military 
cliques in HO's cabinet. Among the more capable members of the new 
cabinet are Ministers without portfolio CHANG Chih-chung, CHANG Chun, 
and CHU Chia-hua? all holdovers from the defunct SUN Fo cabinet, S. Y. 
LIU, Governor of the Central Bank has been appointed Minister of Finance. 
Although LIU is an able and honest financier he is not considered capable 
of coping with the present chaotic economic situation. 
That the new cabinet's chief mission, is to present a suitable 
peace front in the coming negotiations with the Communists is evidenced 
by appointment of FU Ping-chang, Ambassador in Moscow since 1943, 
to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs, This move reportedly 
was recommended by leading Nationalist peace delegate SHAG Li-tze, 
who has publicly denounced the Atlantic Pact as "rubbish" and urged 
the Government to remove all vestiges of anti-Soviet policy and atmos-
phere and assume a more neutral policy toward both the U6 and the USSR,, 
Fills appointment however, does not reflect a fundamental change in 
foreign policy, since FU is believed to have little influence with 
Soviet officials. 
Meanwhile, the National Government remains dependent on actual 
and potential US aid for survive], Premier HO has renewed recent 
Nationalist appeals for a sizable currency-stabilization loan, which 
he declares is essential to maintain his government in power. More-
over, he has instructed the new ministers to draft plans on which requests 
for other forms of economic aid can be based? Presently, HO can count 
only on ECA aid, chiefly in the form of much-needed commodities, which 
may serve to prevent economic collapse in important Nationalist cities 
during the next few months? Failure to obtain greatly increased 
US aid, to secure substantial Soviet support, and to achieve a peace 
settlement with the Communists probaely will bring about the complete 
discrediting of Premier HO and Acting President LI and lead to the 
reemergence of President CHIANG. Kai-shek.

-7-
end to civil administration and a r,:.sultant period of unrest in China's 
largest city is presaged by K.C. RU's intention to resign his mayorship, 
Despite his record as a capable administrator and unquestioned loyalty 
to the National Government, WU has found his authority diminishing 
rapidly while that of General TVG En-pa, Nationalist Commander of 
the Nanking-Shanghai-Aungchow area,increases. Several of WU's municipal 
bureau heads have already resigned but Premier NO Ying-chin,and various 
/ocal groups have urged UU to remain. However, it is doubtful if RU 
can be persuaded to continue as mayor since there is little chance that 
he can make a satisfactory agreement with TANG regarding the division 
of authority. 
Should RU's resignation be accepted he probably will be succeeded 
by TANG'S deputy. General GNU Shao-chou, recently Governor of Shenai, 
or by another of TA:NG's close associates. Such a change would lead 
to consolidation of military control over city affairs and to unpopular 
policies regarding taxation and finance, food supply, trade, and treat-
ment of labor, as well as action against the local peace movement to 
which TANG is strongly opposed. Economic and political Instability 
thereby would be greatly intensified. 
RU's withdrawal from the Shanghai scene would not necessarily 
mean his departure from national politics; he has been mentioned several 
times as a successor to CHEN Cheng, present Governor of Taiwan. 
Communists be,in discussions on US trade: Communist Foreign Affairs 
officials in Tientsin made their first direct approach to American 
businessmen this week when the Communists met with the President of 
the Tientsin American Chamber of Commerce to discuss US controls and 
tariffs on Chinese exports and imports and the possioility of US 
trade on a barter aasis, This meeting indicates that the depression 
in North China has probably forced the Communists to modify their 
hostility toward foreign businessmen. The action also reveals the 
Communists ignorance regarding forein trade; e.g., the US has no export 
tariffs and rarely trades with any country on a barter basis. A 
further reason for theapproach is that the Communists probably have 
discovered it is less profitable to export goods destined for US 
markets (such as bristles and furs) via Hong Kong and South China 
ports than directly to the U.

The statement may have been prompted by the extensive military 
operations which are now in progress in the Sino-Tonkinese frontier 
area, where the French are facing the most serious opnosition they 
have so far encountered in the Franco-Vietnamese etruggle. An ordea 
to bring badly-needed reinforcements to Tonkin from Cochinchina was 
apparently ccentermanded by the Commanding General of French forces 
in the Far East, who insisted upon maintenance of the present Cochin-
china strength at least until Dao Delta arrival there in late AiL 
Reaumption ef concerted cembat activity by the Viet 'Minh may 
well indicate both the opening of the general counteroffensive premised 
by Ho Chi TInh in recent broadcasts and the predicted increase of 
eetivity which was anticipated as part of the anti-Mao Dai campaign,. 
indications that this campaign may well be successful make the. French 
General ,s pessimistic estimate of the situation appear realistic.

of a political understanding has been denied consistently, it is believed

the government, revieione of the draft constitution and removal of "strong 
man" General Each, Area Deputy CeineC,. In return, the Navy Agreed among 
other concessions, to remove the Marine Commander who had been active in 
support of the Pridi group. The Navy carried out its part of the under-
standing and thus Phibul,a failure to reciprocate has placed the Navy 
C-in-C in an embarreesing position with his subordinates, some of whom 
are reported considering support of Pridi,s followers in event of another 
attempt to overthrow the government. 
While the full remifications of the Phibul-Each relationship have

Council directive sent to the ITN Committee for Indonesia (UNCFI) Jest 
reek will probably pave the way for a resumption of negotiations on 
the Indonesian prnblean UNCFI has been directed: (1) to submit a 
report on the darage to Jogjakarta; and (2) to assist the Dutch and 
Republicans in reaching a working agreement within the framework of 
the 28 January olution. In this ccnnection, UNCFI has suggested 
that the Dutch and Republicans each send delegations to a series of 
discussions to be held in Batavia early in April0 The proposed meet,-
ings will consider restoration of the Republican novernment to Jogja-
'-ertl as well as conditions for the conduct of the proposed Hague 
conference The Netherlands has already conditionally accepted the 
ineltetion and nlans to send Van Roijen, who recently represented 
the Dutch at enurity Council discussions on Indonesia, as chief dele-
gate. &ltl'ough the Republic has not as pet indicated a willingness to 
participate, there is reason to believe that it will accept and will 
send a stroeg delegation after it has contacted its scattered leaders, 
The direct eld immediate purpose of these meetinp,e will be a 
cessation of hostilities and establishment of a time-table for the 
transfer of Netherlands sovereignty to a federated Indonesian govern-
ment. Unless sore immediate provision is made to terminate warfare in 
Indonesia, the monomy of the area will be completely disrupted and

Far 1a torn Reaction to? Atlantic Pact 
Although. reaction to the impending North Atlantic Pact has been 
generally favorable in the non-Communist areas ef the Far East0 the comment 
has had a distinct undertone of apprehension tha the defense of Pacific 
natione rill necessarily suffer neglect as a result of this primarily 
Weetern orientation, ,.One immediate and widespread miggestion for avoiding 
'71s danger is the establishment of a "Pacific Pact" with objectiven 
t:.eallel to the Western alliance* 
In Japan. the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs appealed to Australia, 
the US and other nations of the Padifio and the Thr Nast to join Japan in 
a Pacific defense treaty. The semi-official Nippon Times, in comment, 
suggested that even passive Japanese partioilialon:IirsoA such arrangement 
would serve to check the spread of Communism in japan., 
Presieent Quirino of the Philippine Republics. in urging "Pacific 
Peet% has recommended that the US take the leadership in eetablishing 
such a form of collective security. Quirino wants Japan to be included in 
any alliame so that the former enemy state could he carefully observed 
and directed in the "right" channelee 
Korea,s President Rhee has supported Quirino 'o proposal with the 
statement that "a Pacific alliance will make any power think twice before 
planning another war," 
In Australia, where agitation for some sort of a regional defense 
aereement has been intermittent since the end of 7orLd War II, recent 
Atlantic Prat publioiLy has revived the issue again. Government officials 
and the Australian press earrently advocate variove Enhemes. The most 
exteneive of these envisions an alliance stretching from India to Chi/e; 
another is designed for Southeast Asian countries aline. while a third is 
restricted to Commonwealth countries. NeerZealend has expressed parallel 
interest.,
