BIOGRAPHIC BRIEF 
Mao Tse-tung joined the Chinese Communist 
Party (CC?) in 1921. After many years of agitation 
within the Party, and in the face of considerable 
opposition from Li Li-san, he became CC? Chairman 
in 1935. Mao solidified his position in the hills 
of Yenan and until 1949, when he marched victori-
ously into Peking, operated in China's countryside 
guiding his band of followers through the anti-
Japanese and civil war years. In Peking, the 
Central People's Government was founded, and Mao 
became Chief of State. 
Mao then negotiated a treaty with Moscow and 
began a series of suppressive movements designed 
to ensure his supremacy at home. The "cult" of 
Mao spread, but following the disastrous Great Leap 
Forward of 1958, Mao resigned his top government 
post, while retaining the CC? Chairmanship. To 
rejuvenate the CCP with a revolutionary spirit, 
and to defeat the rising threat from "revisionists" 
and "capitalist-roaders," Mao launched the chaotic 
Cultural Revolution in 1965. Four years later he 
remained leader of the CCP backed by a Politburo 
entourage of loyal Maoists. 
Mao, now 77, has been in uncertain health for 
many of his adult years but currently appears to 
be in good physical and mental condition. His life 
has been a combination of the ruthlessness of a 
totalitarian leader, the cunning of a clever Ming 
Court official, and the sensitivities of a poet. 
He is married to Chiang Ch'ing, his fourth wife.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA MAO Tse-tung 
(3029/3419/2639) 
Chairman, Chinese Communist Party; 
Chairman, Politburo; Chairman, 
Military Commission 
Mao Tse-tung has been Chairman of the Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) since 1935. He also holds 
the following major positions: Chairman of the 
CCP Politburo, member of the Politburo Standing 
Committee, and de jure chairman of the Military 
Commission of the CCP Central Committee (CCP-CC). 
In addition, the existing draft constitution, 
which will be discussed at the impending Fourth 
National People's Congress (NPC), specifically 
names him commander in chief of the whole army and 
whole nation. This is a new title and appears to 
be deliberately vague but more all-embracing than 
the post of head of state, formerly held by the 
now deposed Liu Shao-chli. Mao has been a Deputy 
representing Peking municipality in the previous 
NPC's. 
Mao's rise to power was gradual achieved in 
the face of considerable opposition from rival 
leaders and, indirectly until 1935, from the Com-
munist International (Comintern) and the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Mao consoli-
dated his leadership in Yenan, Shensi, where he 
developed an interpretation of China's situation 
within the framework of Marxist philosophy. In 
this period at Yenan, Mao solidified his position 
as an ideological as well as political leader of 
the Chinese Communist movement. 
Since the Yenan era and the 1949 CCP takeover, 
Mao has decided the fate of numerous party cadres 
and has demonstrated a ruthless vindictiveness 
toward anyone he believed disloyal to him. His 
continued domination is the result of leadership 
abilities, tremendous charismatic appeal, and the 
often unrewarded loyalty proffered by lifelong 
associates. The invaluable aid he has received 
from Lin Piao, Chou En-lai, Chien Po-ta and K'ang 
Sheng, his fellow members of the Politburo Standing 
Committee, has been instrumental in maintaining

his preeminence in China. There have been others, 
of course, such as military elder Chu Te, as well 
as the now purged Liu Shao-chli, Teng Hsiao-pling 
and P'eng Te-huai, upon whom Mao has relied for 
assistance and who stand out in the annals of CC? 
history. Particularly noticeable is the respect 
all of these men have had for Mao, even during 
many years of internal troubles and discontent. 
At times, the personality cult surrounding Mao 
has prevailed to such a degree that his stature 
could best be described as that of a semideity. 
Whether Mao's personal traits are a result or a 
cause of this stature is difficult to determine. 
In any case, he exudes an air of extreme self-
confidence, is skillful in manipulating protago-
nists during infighting and intrigue, and demon-
strates great patience, a sense of timing, and 
a readiness to retreat when necessary. 
Early Life  
Mao Tse-tung was born on 26 December 1893 to 
Mao Shun-sheng, a moderately wealthy peasant farmer 
and Wen Ch'i-mei, a kind, generous and sympathetic 
woman and a devout Buddhist who gave her children 
religious instruction. Mao was the eldest of four 
children--three sons and a daughter. The family 
lived in Shaoshan village, Hsiangt'an hsien, a 
rural county some 20 miles south of the Hunan pro-
vincial capital of Changsha. 
Early in life, Mao learned a lesson from his 
relationship with his quick-tempered father who 
frequently beat his sons. The elder Mao often 
accused young Tse-tung of laziness and unfilial 
conduct, but when the latter asserted his rights 
by open rebellion, his father relented; when Tse-
tung remained weak and submissive, his father 
only cursed and beat him more. Mao Tse-tung 
later told American journalist Edgar Snow, "I 
learned to hate my father but it probably bene-
fited me. It made me most diligent in my work." 
From the age of 8, young Mao received a 
traditional Chinese education at the local pr 
school while continuing to work on the family 
2 
ary 
arm.

His teacher was harsh and severe and did not hesi-
tate to beat his students. At 13 Mao left school 
to work longer hours on the farm. He managed to 
continue reading, and stories of Western technol-
ogy and the mistreatment of Chinese at the hands 
of foreigners stimulated his desire to resume his 
education. He ran away from home, studied classi-
cal literature with an unemployed law student, and 
at age 16 enrolled in Tungshan Academy. The fol-
lowing year he studied at a Changsha middle school. 
With the outbreak of the Wuhan uprising on 10 
October 1911, Mao joined an anti-Manchu Hunan army 
unit, but thinking the revolution had ended he 
resigned in 6 months to return to school. He soon 
left school again, returned to spend about 6 months 
at the Hunan Provincial First Middle School in 
Changsha, then quit once more to begin a period of 
self-education, reading poetry and romances and 
serious works on Russia, England, America and 
France. In 1913 Mao reentered the Hunan Provin-
cial First Middle School. This time he remained 
until 1918, having been influenced by liberal 
instructors such as Yang Ch'ang-ch'i, whose daugh-
ter Mao would soon marry. 
During this period Mao became an enthusiastic 
supporter of the magazine Hsin Ch'ing-nien (New 
Youth), founded by Ch'en Tu-hsiu in 1915 after 
Japan's announcement of the degrading Twenty-One 
Demands. Ch'en, who later became dean of the 
Faculty of Letters at Peking University and the 
first secretary general of the CCP, wanted to 
awaken China's youth ideologically and to show 
the need for destroying stagnant traditions. 
Inspired by Hsin Ch'ing-nien, Mao gradually built 
up a small nucleus of serious-minded colleagues 
and on 18 April 1918 founded the Hsin-min fisiieh-
hui (New People's Study Society) in Changsha. 
(Among its activities, the society helped to 
organize students to go to France under the work-
and-study program. In 1920 Mao went to Peking 
with 20 such prospective students; at the last 
however, he stayed in China.)

Financially unable to enter a university, Mao 
was given a minor position in the National Peking 
University library by Li Ta-chao, head librarian 
and soon to be another of the founders of the CCP. 
Mao joined Li's Marxist Study Society and read Karl 
Marx's Communist Manifesto and various other works 
on socialism and class struggle. He returned to 
Changsha in early 1919, took part in the Hunan 
phase of the May Fourth (1919) Movement (a student-
led political crusade opposing the degradation of 
China at the Paris Peace Talks), and then went to 
Shanghai. There he met Chien Tu-hsiu and worked 
out the plans for a Hunan Reconstruction Associa-
tion. Mao then returned to his native province, 
where he continued the work of the New People's 
Study Society, corresponded with Ch'en and took 
up a teaching position. That winter he helped to 
organize workers politically and instigate strikes. 
Mao has declared that by 1920 he had become in 
theory, and to some extent in action, a Marxist. 
The Beginnings of the CCP  
_ 
The founding date of the CCP is usually given 
as July 1921, the occasion of the First CCP Con-
gress, in Shanghai. Of the 12 persons who partic-
ipated in the congress, only Mao, who was one of 
two Hunan representatives, and Tung Pi-wu, who 
represented Hupeh, are still active in the CCP. 
After the congress, Mao returned to Changsha 
to set up the party organization in Hunan, aided 
by Li Li-san and Liu Shao-ch'i. Mao missed the 
Second Congress, held in 1922. At the Third CCP 
Congress, in Canton in 1923, he was elected to the 
CCP-CC for the first time. He was also appointed 
director of the Organization Department of the 
party and until late 1924 worked out of CCP head-
quarters in Shanghai. 
In 1923, at the outset of the period of CCP-
Kuomintang ( ) cooperation in the first united 
front, Mao joined the KMT. In January 1924 he 
became an alternate member of the KMT's First 
Central Executive Committee. Mao threw himself 
into his task of organizing cooperation with the 
-4 
Approved for Release: 2022/02/10 006928171 
Approved for Release: 2022/02/10 C06928171 
KMT so enthusiastically 
that he was soon looked 
upon with suspicion in 
his own party. By the 
end of 1924, according 
to his autobiography, 
Mao became ill and 
returned to Hunan for a 
rest. There is little 
doubt that his illness 
was at least partly 
political. He was under 
heavy attack from those 
in the CCP who were 
opposed to an excessive 
emphasis on KMT-CCP 
cooperation at the pos-
sible expense of their 
own party's independence. 
(In fact, Mao was not 
elected to the Fourth 
CCP-CC in January 1925.) 
MAO IN 19 23 
Upon returning to his native province Mao 
noticed a growing awareness and concern of the 
peasantry for political matters. He began try-
ing to organize peasant associations, but his 
work in the Hunan countryside was brought to 
a halt by the provincial governor, and he was 
forced to flee to Canton in the fall of 1925. 
By this time the peasant movement in Kwangtung 
Province had reached considerable proportions, 
as had the tensions between the KMT and CCP 
over the united front policy. 
Much of the available evidence suggests Mao 
still favored cooperation, and during the next 
year and a half he played a rather significant 
role within the KMT apparatus. In November 1925 
he and two Communist colleagues gained the domi-
nant voice on the credentials committee for the 
forthcoming Second KMT Congress. 
At about the same time Mao became de facto 
head of the KMT Propaganda Department, although 
his title was only deputy chief. In this capac-
ity, at the Second KMT Congress in January 1926, 
_ 5 -

he delivered a report on propaganda, in which he 
stressed the need for the KMT to center its work 
on the peasantry. Mao was again elected an alter-
nate meMber of the KMT's Central Executive Commit-
tee, and he continued to serve as acting head of 
the Propaganda Department. In February he also 
became a member of the Peasant Movement Committee, 
more than half of which was made up of Communists, 
and which apparently was intended as a device by 
which the CCP hoped to gain control of KMT organi-
zations that dealt with peasant questions. 
After March 1926 Chiang Kai-shek moved to 
curtail Communist power. He was able to accomplish 
much in this direction at the Second Plenum of the 
KMT Central Executive Committee in May 1926. Mao 
was removed from his Propaganda Department post, 
and most of his fellow Communists were stripped of 
their positions. Surprisingly, Mao continued to 
occupy the important post of principal of the Peas-
ant Movement Training Institute during the period 
from May to October 1926. 
The institute, though under KMT jurisdiction, 
had been a stronghold of the CCP since the school 
was established 2 years earlier. While head of the 
institute, Mao arranged for a number of top Commu-
nist leaders to teach or give lectures while he 
himself lectured on the peasant question in China 
and on methods of teaching in the countryside. 
After his class graduated, Mao spent a brief 
me in Shanghai as secretary of the newly estab-
lished CCP Central Peasants' Committee and then 
made an inspection tour of rural areas in Kiangsu 
and Chekiang. In December he was in Changsha, 
where he gave the keynote speech to the First 
Hunan Peasants' Association Congress, stressing 
the critical importance of the peasantry to the 
revolution. 
The result of Mao's tour of Hunan was A Report 
on the Investigation of the Peasant Movement in 
Hunan. In this paper, Mao anticipated massive 
rural uprisings in which the peasantry would over-
throw the landed classes. His plea that the party 
-6

exploit the revolutionary potential of the peasants 
went unheeded, however, because it conflicted with 
official CCP policy. The CCP-CC published Mao's 
report without comment, and Chien Tu-hsiu then 
tabled it at the Fifth National CCP Congress in 
Wuhan in May 1927. At this congress, which took 
place 1 month after Chiang Kai-shek's anti-Commu-
nist coup in Shanghai, Mao was reelected to the 
CCP-CC but only as an alternate member who was not 
permitted to vote on policy decisions. Fellow 
party members still held him in suspicion because 
of his work with the KMT, and he had gained the 
reputation of a "hot-head" who was not easily 
disciplined. Not only did Mao oppose the party's 
policy, or lack of policy, toward the peasants, 
he also led the All-China Peasants' Union (whose 
chairman he became in May 1927) in a series of 
rebellions throughout Hunan early in the summer 
of 1927. This was at a time when the Comintern 
was issuing directives to stop inciting peasant 
uprisings. 
On 1 August 1927 a band of Communist forces 
under Yeh T'ing captured KMT-held Nanchang, Kiangsi. 
Within a few days they were driven out, and on 7 
August an emergency CCP meeting was convened in 
Hankow at which Chien Tu-hsiu was deposed as CCP 
leader. A Provisional Politburo under Chili Ch'iu-
pai was established, and Mao became an alternate 
member of that body. 
Under revised instructions from the Comintern, 
the Politburo planned a series of rural uprisings 
(later known as the Autumn Harvest Uprisings) with 
the ultimate goal of surrounding and capturing the 
major Yangtze Valley urban centers. Mao was sent 
to his native Hunan, and by September his 1st Divi-
sion of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army 
began to experience minor successes. Soon, however, 
after many battles and troop losses, the uprisings 
failed. The KMT drove Mao's forces to Chingkang-
shan, a mountain retreat on the Hunan-Kiangsi border. 
Repudiated and dismissed from the Central Com-
mittee and Politburo, Mao remained at Chingkangshan 
through the winter of 927-28, completely cut off 
7

from the party center and short on food and arms. 
In April or May 1928 Chu Te arrived with his ragged 
troops and joined forces with Mao in the beginning 
of an important, strategic alliance. Officially, 
Mao was the political commissar and Chu the com-
mander of the 4th Army of the Chinese Workers' and 
Peasants' Red Army. In the summer of 1928, Mao was 
reelected in absentia to the CCP-CC by the Sixth 
National CCP Congress, held in Moscow. 
Kiangsi Period  
During 1929 and early 1930 the Chu-Mao forces 
marched about in southeastern Kiangsi near the 
Fukien border while Mao was strengthening his per-
sonal position. In December 1929 he convened the 
Ninth Conference of 1st Red Army delegates at 
Kutien in Fukien. It was an obscure event, but 
it signified his growing control over the Red Army 
and was his initial attempt at independent policy 
formulation. 
Mao called for the subordination of military 
to political affairs; he opposed the policy of city-
based revolution as advocated by Li Li-san, strong 
man of the party in Shanghai; and he expounded his 
own views on agrarian revolution and the means of 
building up the Red Army for a revolutionary role. 
The Kutien Conference marked the end of Mao's 
passive resistance to the Soviet-oriented Li L -san 
leadership and the beginning of his attacks on the 
Moscow-educated "returned students" group known as 
the "28 Bolsheviks." Mao's proposal to concentrate 
his efforts on Kiangsi and his claim that his policy 
was the only correct one were clear indications 
that he intended to function autonomously. He had 
perceptibly strengthened his position, and the 
Comintern began to accord him public support. 
In December 1930 Mao suppressed a local rebel-
lion against his authority at nearby Futien in 
Kiangsi. This incident resulted in the first and 
one of the most extensive and bloody purges car-
ried out by Mao prior to 1949. 
Mao was secure in his position in the Kiangsi 
Soviet by 1931, having been elected Chairman of the

Revolutionary Military Council (RMC) in 1930 and 
of the Provisional Chinese Soviet Republic (PCSR) 
in 1931. Mao's position in the CCP, however, was 
less imposing, and over the next year and a half 
his policies--especially regarding military 
strategy--came under constant attack from the 
returned student faction and Chou En-lai. 
Power in the CCP had shifted from Li Li-san 
to the "28 Bolsheviks" who, by 1932, were head-
quartered in Juichin, Kiangsi. This development 
signalled a temporary waning of Mao's power. He 
was replaced by Chou En-lai as RMC Chairman, but 
as disillusionment with Soviet guidance grew, Mao 
gradually regained political strength. In late 
1932 he was elected a full Politburo member for 
the first time, and he has continuously served on 
that body since then. 
The Long March and the Yenan Era  
In October 1934 the Kiangsi Soviet succumbed 
to the KMT extermination campaigns, and the Red 
Army set out on its historic Long March to Shensi. 
En route, in January 1935, the Politburo held the 
Tsuni (Kweichow) Conference at which Mao became 
Chairman of the CCP. He also took back from Chou 
En-lai the post of Chairman of the RMC. During 
the next 2 years Mao reestablished the PCSR in 
north Shensi, first in Paoan and then in Yenan 
after December 1936. He remained in Yenan for the 
next 10 years, devoting most of his time to the 
consolidation and organization of the CCP. 
From early 1935 Mao successfully withstood a 
series of challenges to his position within the 
party, and with each challenge his power increased. 
His main opponents were Chang Kuo-t'ao, another CCP 
founder, and Ch'en Shao-yii (Wang Ming), a Comintern-
sponsored advocate of strong Soviet ties. Mao was 
aided by the services of Ch'en Po-ta, the late Ai 
Ssu-ch'i, and other members of a "brain trust" he 
had formed to counter the charges of the Moscow-
trained men that Mao did not understand Marxism-
Leninism.

MAO ( 3RD FRN LEFT) IN YENAN, 1937 
Several articles written around this time--
which form part of the basis of Chinese Communist 
thinking--are attributed to Mao: "The Tasks of 
the Chinese Communist Party During the Anti-
Japanese War" (1937); "On Practice" (1937); "On 
Contradiction" (1937); "Strategic Problems in the 
Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War" (1938); "On Protracted 
War" (1938); "On New Democracy" (1940). 
The Cheng-feng Movement  
Mao's attacks on his opponents culminated in 
the Cheng-feng (rectification) movement of 1942, 
which dispelled any doubts about Mao's primacy 
in the CCP. Generally designed to raise party 
efficiency and ideology, the campaign also effec-
tively eliminated Mao's opposition in the party. 
The specific target for Cheng-feng was Ch'en 
Shao-ya, one of the leading "28 Bolsheviks," and 
the greatest significance of the campaign was 
Mao's insistence that Marxism be made Chinese.

The message of the reform was that the Chinese 
party was determined to direct its own revolutionary 
activities. Mao called for the eradication of dog-
matism, subjectivism in thought, sectarianism in 
party relations, and formalism in literature and 
art. Party members were ordered to check on each 
other's attitudes and ideology; incorrigible com-
rades were to be dismissed from the party, but a 
second and third chance were to be given to those 
who confessed and showed a willingness to reform. 
Excesses in the early stages of the movement 
worried the Central Committee. In July 1942 Liu 
Shao-ch'i wrote one of his best known works, On 
Intra-Party Struggle, which was a set of procedural 
rules for the Cheng-feng movement. This proved to 
be a turning point for Liu who at the time was in 
central China as political commissar for Ch'en I, 
the acting commander of the New 4th Army. 
Mao summoned Liu the next year to aid him in 
general party administration and in carrying out 
the rectification campaign. Their goal was the 
type of intensive indoctrination and training that 
would allow party cadres to operate with unanimity 
in guerrilla-controlled "Liberated Areas" where 
close administrative control and inspection were 
impossible. This indoctrination was to include 
emphasis on the Sinicization process of Marxism 
and the application of Marxist-Leninist theories 
to China. The outcome of the movement was three-
fold: A group of high leaders fell from power; 
the "Thought of Mao Tse-tung" cult was inaugurated; 
and Mao's position as leader of the party was con-
solidated as he affirmed the independence of his 
own leadership from Moscow. 
The 1944-49 Period 
In 1944 Mao accepted an offer in principle from 
Chiang Kai-shek legalizing all political parties in 
China. As he prepared for the next phase of his 
political career, Mao strengthened and consolidated 
his hold on the organization and thinking of the 
CCP. At that time he also headed the five-man 
Secretariat of the Central Committee, then the 
party's top policymaking body.

MAO WITH AMERICAN OBSERVERS IN YENAN, 1944 
The Seventh Party Congress, held during April-
June 1945, reviewed wartime developments and 
elected a new Central Committee and Politburo, 
both of which were composed overwhelmingly of men 
who had proved their ability and their loyalty to 
Mao during the difficult war years. A revised 
party constitution was also adopted, and it offi-
cially enshrined the "Thought of Mao Tse-tung" as 
necessary to guide the entire work of the party. 
Mao himself was reelected Chairman of the Politburo 
and Secretariat. 
A highlight of the meeting was an address by 
Mao, "On Coalition Government," a statement that 
summarized Mao's political thought as it had 
evolved during the Yenan years and gave the con-
ditions under which the CCP might cooperate with 
the Kuomintang. Mao proposed a "united front 
or democratic alliance based on the overwhelming 
majority of the people under the leadership of 
the working class" to take the place of KMT politi-
cal tutelage after the defeat of Japan. He called 
for two steps: 
In the first stage, to form a provisional 
coalition government by common agreement 
of the representatives of all parties and

people without party affiliation; in the 
second stage, through free and unrestricted 
elections, to convene a national assembly 
which will form a proper coalition govern-
ment. 
Mao challenged the KMT's ability to solve the 
economic and political problems of China in terms 
of Confucian tradition as suggested by Chiang Kai-
shek in his China's Destiny. Mao wanted a new 
authority, namely the coalition government, which 
would be responsible for tackling such questions 
in the postwar period. 
The civil war between Mao and Chiang continued 
after the defeat of Japan. The Nationalists 
occupied Yenan in March 1947, and Mao was then 
reported in various rural areas of north China. 
He finally entered Peking on 25 March 1949, 2 
months after its occupation by Communist forces. 
The Early Years of the People's Republic of China  
From 21 to 30 September 1949 the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) 
an "organization of the democratic united front 
of the entire Chinese people," was convened. It 
adopted the Common Program and the Organic Law, 
which set up the Central People's Government (CPG) 
of the People's Republic of China. Mao was named 
Chairman (Chief of State) of the CPG and--in order 
of rank--Chu Te, Liu Shao-ch'i, Sung Ch'ing-ling 
(Sun Yat-sen's widow), Li Chi-sen, Chang Lan and 
Kao Kang became Vice Chairmen. The highest civil-
ian policymaking body was the CPO Council, and 
subordinate to that was the 20-man Government 
Administration Council (GAC) headed by Chou En-lai. 
The GAC had jurisdiction over ministries, commis-
sions and committees. 
Mao faced two problems when he took over China: 
the consolidation of authority and, as he wrote in 
"On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" (July 
1949), "the education of the peasantry." In Mao's 
view, the traditional hunger for land and the indi-
vidualism of the peasants needed to be overcome, 
as did the backwardness of rural areas with refer-
ence to modern agricultural methods.

On 28 June 1950 the Land Reform Law was prom-
ulgated, but it produced disappointing results. 
Land reform teams then urged the peasants to wage 
"fierce class struggle" against local landlords 
and to arouse class hatred. Mass trials and 
accusation meetings became the order of the day, 
and by November 1952 over 116 million acres of 
land were confiscated and divided among 300 mil-
lion poor peasants. This campaign was carried 
out at considerable human cost. By Mao's own 
admission, some 800,000 people lost their lives 
in the opening years of the People's Republic. 
Mao also inaugurated three other suppressive 
movements: the "three anti movement" against cor-
ruption, waste and bureaucracy in government 
bodies and public enterprises; the "five anti 
movement" aimed at merchants and businessmen as 
a class; and the "study campaign for ideological 
reform" designed to gain the support of China's 
intellectuals (it resulted, however, only in 
alienating them). 
Mao Goes to Moscow 
In December 1949 Mao made his first trip 
outside China, traveling to Moscow to discuss 
political, security and economic arrangements with 
Stalin. Nine weeks of negotiation led to the 
signing of the Sib-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, 
Alliance and Mutual Assistance on 14 February 1950.

In addition to defense and aid provisions, the 
alliance called for Chinese recognition of the 
independence of the Mongolian People's Republic. 
Upon leaving Moscow, Mao declared that Sino-
Soviet friendship was "eternal and indestruc-
tible." 
The alliance also provided China with war 
materiel during the Korean conflict in which China 
was involved from November 1950 to July 1953. The 
performance of the Chinese Communists in that war--
in which the Chinese People's Volunteers fought 
the Western world's strongest power without being 
defeated--further enhanced the prestige of the 
Chinese and of Mao, their leader. 
With the death of Stalin in 1953Moscow, aware 
of the importance of retaining China's friendship, 
paid increased attention to Mao's ideological 
stature. Soviet reviews of Mao's literary works 
began to describe them as enriching Marxist theory. 
The CCP went further, claiming for Mao the title 
of the leading Marxist-Leninist theoretician. 
Admitting his stature as a natural leader, many 
non-Communist Western observers nevertheless 
consider Mao's principal contribution to Marxism-
Leninism to be his concept of rural tactics. This 
concept is known today as guerrilla warfare. 
1954-57: Government Reorganization  
The CPG was reorganized in 1954, and the 
National People's Congress (NPC) became the high-
est organ of state authority. Mao was elected 
chairman of the People's Republic of China and 
the Council of National Defense, and under the 
new constitution he had other wide-ranging and 
undefined powers. Liu Shao-ch'i became head of 
the Standing Committee of the NPC, and Chou En-
lai head of the State Council--the highest 
administrative organ. The military-dominated 
regional administrative system was abolished, 
thus removing a source of potential personal chal-
lenge to Mao's leadership. In its place, a sys-
tem of provinces municipalities, and minority 
autonomous districts was established.

The first major internal attempt to jar the 
party and government structure occurred in the 
famous Kao-Jao case publicized in April 1955. 
Kao Kang was the powerful head of the Northeast 
Administrative Area (Manchuria) and also headed 
the State Planning Commission. Jao Shu-shih was 
a member of the same body and director of the then 
important Organization Department of the CCP-CC. 
In early 1954 both men mysteriously dropped from 
public view, and in February of that year Liu 
Shao-chsi made a call for party unity. He made a 
scathing reference to those who "regarded the 
department under their leadership as their indi-
vidual inheritance or independent kingdom." This 
reference was not given full explanation until 4 
April 1955, when Peking issued a report on the 
so-called Kao-Jao antiparty alliance. The two men, 
and a number of their subordinates, were expelled 
from the party for "engaging in conspiratorial 
activities" with the aim of deposing Mao and Chou 
En-lai and stepping into their places. Kao com-
mitted suicide, and nothing has since been heard 
of Jao. 
In 1955 Mao decided it was time to advance 
from socialism directly to "higher" forms of col-
lectivism, a theory based on what Peking called 
"uninterrupted revolution." Mao's call for rapid 
collectivization and a speedup in industry, science, 
education and public health work was supposed to 
be voluntarily implemented. It worked better in 
the rural areas than in the cities, but by June 
1956 it was clear that the program was out of 
balance. The campaign had met with considerable 
opposition, and it was later officially admitted 
that during the first 7 months of 1957 there were 
100 cases of agricultural sabotage in one small 
county alone. Cooperativization was nevertheless 
decreed complete by 1957; Mao declared that there 
was a "high tide" of enthusiastic support for a 
"Next Great Step" toward socialism. This was 
clearly tantamount to a decree that such a step 
was impending, but the nature of the move Was not 
divulged until the summer of 1958.

Meanwhile in September 1956 the CCP convened 
the Eighth, Party Congress. Under the terms of 
the revised constitution Mao retained the party 
chairmanship. He was also elected to the newly 
established Standing Committee of the Politburo, 
which in effect replaced the former Secretariat 
as the "inner Politburo." The Standing Committee 
then consisted of Mao, Liu Shao-ch'i, Chou En-lai 
Chu Te, Ch'en Yiin and Teng Hsiao-pling. A year 
and a half later, Lin Piao was added to the group. 
"Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" 
At the time of the Hungarian revolt in October 
1956, Mao stated that a similar revolt could never 
happen in China because the Chinese people under-
stood their freedom and the extent of its limits. 
In May 1957 he launched the "Hundred Flowers" cam-
paign, based on the slogan "Let a hundred flowers 
bloom, and a hundred schools of thought contend." 
It was ostensibly designed to mobilize support for 
the government among China's intellectuals by 
permitting open criticism of political conditions, 
including criticism of the CCP. This, Mao thought 
would help prevent the type of situation that had 
occurred in Hungary. The resulting rash of criti-
cism, however, was more than Peking expected, and 
the CCP soon reimposed strict controls. "Rightists" 
were denounced and intellectual dissidence was 
quickly suppressed before it could spread to the 
peasants and working class. 
The Great Leap Forward: 1958-59  
Mao next went from political to socioeconomic 
experimentation as he launched the Great Leap 
Forward and the People's Communes in 1958. He 
wanted the people to accomplish in 4 years what 
would normally take a decade. Mao required that 
the utmost speed be used in incorporating enormous 
numbers of workers into new productive enterprises 
under a decentralized economic administration. 
In 1958 he proposed the commune as a new organiza-
tional form for agriculture. Again, debate on his 
new idea within and outside the party was intense. 
In a move to ensure that his view on the commune 
- 17 -

(and other topics) would be heard, Mao created a 
new party journal, Hung Ch'i (Red Flag), and 
appointed Chien Po-ta as its editor. Hung Ch'i 
replaced Hsieh Hsi as the major theoretical peri-
odical of the CCP. 
There are many disputes about the campaign's 
short- and long-range significance, but there is 
little debate regarding the economic dislocation 
that followed in the 1959-61 period. Discontent 
became rampant, and the situation demanded a 
retreat. 
One of the first signs that Mao might be 
in trouble was an announcement in December 1958 
that he was resigning as Chief of State, osten-
sibly to give him more time to devote to reading 
and theoretical writing. This was the first major 
setback Mao had experienced since the People's 
Republic of China was formed. Most of his actions 
since the failure of the early communes and his 
Great Leap Forward policies have been designed to 
restore his authority and get the country moving 
again in the revolutionary direction he wants. 
During November-December 1958 the Sixth 
Plenum of the CCP-CC called for a retreat from the 
extremes of the Great Leap Forward. At the Seventh 
Plenum, held in April 1959, Liu Shao-ch'i became 
Chief of State and Chairman of the National Defense 
Council. Chou En-lai replaced Mao as Chairman of 
the CPPCC, the predecessor of the NPC as the high-
est governmental representative body. Mao became 
Honorary Chairman. 
The Lushan Plenum--August 1959  
Mao attended the Eighth Plenum of the party, 
held in Lushan, Kiangsi, in August 1959, to sup-
press the opposition raised against his policies 
and preeminence. Gen. P'eng Te-huai, Minister 
of National Defense, came to Lushan to challenge 
Mao's recent policies, especially the Great Leap 
Forward. P'eng did not seek to overthrow Mao--
only to moderate his excesses and open a construc-
tive debate on policy. He implied, however, that 
China's leaders had ignored reality in the frenzy 
of the Great Leap.

P'eng's criticism of Mao and his policies was 
no longer discreet as he said, "Putting politics 
in command is no substitute for basic economic 
principles, still less for the concrete measures 
needed to run successful economic enterprises." 
Mao openly acknowledged that some errors had been 
committed but noted that if P'eng's destructive 
criticism continued, it would bring the collapse 
of the nation within a year. 
The Central Committee voted on 16 August 1959 
that P'eng Te-huai and his "antiparty clique" 
had aimed at splitting the party. The Maoists' 
triumph appeared total. On 9 September P'eng 
wrote a letter to Mao that, in effect, seemed to 
be an explanation and an apology for his actions. 
It was in vain, however, for on 17 September Liu 
Shao-ch'i delivered his "Order of the Chairman 
of the People's Republic of China": 
...it is hereby ordered to appoint Lin 
Piao Minister of Defense; Lo Jui-ch'ing 
Chief of Staff of the People's Liberation 
Army [PLA], and Hsieh Fu-chih Minister of 
Public Security; and to relieve P'eng Te-
huai of his duties as Minister of Defense 
and Lo Jui-ch'ing as Minister of Public 
Security. 
On 30 September Nikita Khrushchev visited 
Peking on his way back from a meeting with Pres-
ident Eisenhower. He brought gifts for P'eng 
Te-huai, praising him as "the most righteous, 
most courageous, most outspoken man in the CCP." 
Khrushchev asked to meet with P'eng but was 
denied the opportunity. 
Domestic Affairs--1960-65  
From 1960 to 1965 China gradually rose from 
the economic and psychological morass into which 
the Great Leap had precipitated the country. In 
November 1961 P'eng Chen, first secretary of the 
Peking Party Committee, chose 20 of his closest 
associates to search the records of the two disas-
trous years of the Great Leap to find a rational 
road to the future through a full understanding 
of the errors of the past.

By 1960 CCP morale was low and disillusionment 
over the results of the Great Leap was high. The 
organizational structure of the party was in dis-
repair, and younger party members lacked a revolu-
tionary spirit. A "socialist education" campaign 
was begun in 1962 to reinvigorate the party with 
such a spirit, but it failed and Mao held senior 
party officials responsible. 
During 1961 and 1962 numerous intellectuals, 
economists and party cadres began to ignore Mao's 
policies in five major areas: culture, education, 
ideology, agriculture and industry. Therefore, 
in what seemed to be an attempt to bolster his 
apparently slipping image, Mao added three loyal 
supporters to the party Secretariat: K'ang Sheng, 
who was an alternate member of the Central Com-
mittee and a political security specialist; Lo 
Jui-ch'ing, Chief of Staff of the PLA; and Lu 
Ting-i, a propagandist and Vice Premier of the 
State Council. 
It was apparent that Mao continued to leave 
the day-to-day conduct of party affairs to Liu 
Shao-ch'i and Teng Hsiao-p'ing. According to 
Cultural Revolution documents, one result of Mao's 
neglect of economic planning and development was 
that Liu and the party apparatus continued to 
slight Mao's "mass line," substituting central-
ized control for decentralization and local self-
sufficiency, stressing material over ideological 
incentives, and relying on expertise and organi-
zation rather than mass campaigns. 
Mao was out of public view for long periods of 
time from 1962 to 1965, often in seclusion at his 
retreat outside Peking. His visible activities in 
domestic matters continued to be relatively low key 
during this period, but there was nevertheless a 
steady increase in Peking's efforts to spread the 
cult of Mao.

CHATTING WITH YOUTH LEAGUE MEMBERS, JUNE 19611 
The forthcoming Cultural Revolution was fore-
shadowed in a Jen-min Jih-pao editorial of 3 August 
1964 entitled "Cultivate and Train Millions of 
Successors Who Will Carry on the Cause of Proletar-
ian Revolution." This editorial was probably the 
first time that party rectification (termed the 
"reeducation of functionaries and readjustment 
in the revolutionary ranks") and revitalization 
(described as the selection and cultivation of 
younger talent within the nucleus of leadership 
at all levels) were authoritatively discussed as 
closely interrelated subjects. The logic of the 
new combination, coupled with the intensified 
urgency of the regime's concern over training Mao-
ist successors, led some observers to see that 
gradual but widespread personnel changes were 
being contemplated at every level of the party 
and government structure. 
Faced with pressure from below, threatened 
by "degenerate" ideas from within and without, 
aware that younger men would inevitably take 
over some day--regardless of their ideological

qualifications--Mao and his aging supporters seem 
to have decided that younger men must be readied 
for positions of responsibility. 
In January 1965, under Mao's supervision, the 
Politburo drafted the "23 Articles," which shifted 
the focus of the campaign to a general "clean-up," 
and basic construction in politics, economics, 
ideology and organization. The "Articles" also 
attacked high-level party officials as class ene-
mies for "taking the capitalist road." 
The DismisBal of Hai Jul 
By mid-1965 Mao had set up a group of five 
party officials, led by P'eng Chen, mayor of Peking 
and first secretary of the Peking Party Committee, 
to conduct a "cultural revolution" among intellec-
tuals. In September of that year, at an enlarged 
Politburo meeting, Mao issued a new series of 
directives demanding a more vigorous attack on 
"bourgeois ideology." 
On 10 November Yao Wen-yjian, a literary critic 
and then an obscure member of the Shanghai Municipal 
CCP Committee, launched an attack on a play written 
by Wu Han--one of P'eng Chen's deputies--entitled 
The Dismissal of Hai Jul. The play was staged in 
1960-61 and was the story of a legendary Ming 
Dynasty official who brought exploiters of the 
people to justice only to be dismissed through 
court intrigue. The political significance of the 
play lay in the analogy to the P'eng Te-huai case 
and the issue of Mao's responsibility for the suf-
fering of 1960-61. P'eng Chen tried to subtly 
evade those factors in a memorandum and instead 
concentrated merely on the historical accuracy of 
Hai Jul. He also authorized a counterattack on 
Yao Wen-yuan (who is now a member of the Polit-
buro).

quickly followed by the fall of Lu Ting-1, head 
of the CCP Propaganda Department, and T'ao Chu, 
Lu's replacement. Chou Yang, a literary theorist 
and member of the CCP-CC, was also an early vic-
tim of the purge. 
The Calm Before the Storm 
Mao revealed at an expanded Politburo session 
in May 1966 that his "revisionist" opposition 
program was centered at the very highest level of 
party leadership. Addressing a number of these 
top leaders in July, Mao disclosed that revolu-
tionary students and teachers (the precursors of 
the Red Guards) were "going to impose revolution 
on you people because you did not carry out the 
revolution yourselves." 
The Cultural Revolution Group was also set up 
by Mao in July. It consisted of 17 members, headed 
by Ch'en Po-ta and Mao's wife, Chiang Ch'ing and 
advised by K'ang Sheng. 
The year 1966 was marked by the near deifica-
tion of Mao and his thoughts and the appearance 
of numerous big-character posters calling for the 
overthrow of all "bourgeois reactionaries." Mao 
himself wrote a poster--"Bombard the Headquarters"--
that openly attacked all those at the party center 
guilty of "revisionism" and of "taking the capital-
ist road." 
In August 1966 the 11th plenary session of the 
Eighth CCP-CC adopted the 16-point "Decision Con-
cerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," 
which was drawn up under Mao's personal direction. 
At the plenum, the party gave formal sanction to 
the Cultural Revolution and to the censure of Liu 
Shao-ch'i and Teng Hsiao-pling, head of the Party 
Secretariat. Mao stated that he only expected a 
small minority of party cadres to resist and that 
therefore, the prospects for the success of the 
Cultural Revolution were good.

REVIEWING RED GUARDS WITH LIN PIAO, AUGUST 1966 
On the whole, however, provincial party leaders 
withstood the first assault of the Red Guards much 
more successfully than did their colleagues in 
Peking. The extension of the Cultural Revolution 
to agriculture and industry in mid-December 1966 
and the formation among workers of revolutionary 
rebel groups led to the collapse of most party and 
administrative organs. 
1967: The Year of the Storm  
The first big blow against the existing order 
came in January 1967, when revolutionary rebel orga-
nizations in Shanghai banded together and seized 
power from the city's party and municipal authori-
ties. This act--the "January Revolution"--was 
applauded by Mao and the CRG, and by 22 January the 
Jen-min Jih-pao had made it clear that events in 
Shanghai should be emulated throughout the country. 
For the next 20 months--January 1967 to Septem-
ber 1968--revolutionary committees were established

in all 21 provinces, three municipalities (under 
direct control of the central authorities) and 
five autonomous regions of China to take over the 
powers of former party and government organiza-
tions. Mao paid a price for this Cultural Revo-
lution, however. It was carried on amid violence 
and bloodshed, the purge of numerous high-level 
party and government officials, the disruption of 
the economy and party apparatus, and the bringing 
of China to the brink of civil war. What often 
astonished the outside world the most was Mao's 
concurrence in or at least tolerance of this 
anarchy to achieve his various ends, such as the 
cleansing and rebuilding of the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
In 1967 Mao made a number of public appearances, 
received several foreign delegations, and made two 
tours into the Yangtze valley. The official praise 
and "deification" of Mao during the year reached 
unprecedented heights. A major segment of the 
paper and metal industry was devoted to the produc-
tion and distribution of materials contributing to 
the perpetuation of the Cult of Mao Tse-tung. In 
1967 alone more than 76,000,000 sets of the Selected 
Works of Mao Tse-tung were published, along with 
some 47,000,000 copies of Mao's Selected Readings 
and 57,000,000 copies of his poems. In addition, 
there were the Mao badges, his portraits, and the 
famous Little Red Beck, which permeated Chinese 
society. 
By the end of 1967, 13 of the original CRG 
members had been purged for "rightist sympathies" 
or "ultraleftist tendencies." Efforts to form 
revolutionary committees and rebuild the adminis-
trative apparatus proceeded slowly. March 1968 
witnessed a new purge of the military, which was 
torn between its dual tasks of maintaining order 
and implementing power seizures. The result was 
a new surge of radical ferment that required Mao's 
calling in the army to suppress militancy and 
restore order. Finally, in September 1968, Chou 
En-lai proclaimed that as a result of the "tremen-
dous victory" in the 20-month struggle "to seize 
power from the capitalist-roaders," China was 
"now all Red."

Power Consolidated 
The Ninth CCP Congress met in April 1969. 
Because the campaign to rebuild the party (which 
reportedly was originally directed by K'ang Sheng 
and later by Chou En-lai) had had little success, 
most of the delegates to the congress were selected 
either by the central authorities or by ad hoc 
meetings. At least 40 percent of the delegates 
were PLA members, while many of the others were 
labor heroes or Mao-study activists. 
The new Central Committee reflected a similar 
balance, with a preponderance of senior provincial 
military figures, most of whom held concurrent 
posts in revolutionary committees, replacing the 
leaders purged during the Cultural Revolution. 
Mao was again chosen Chairman of the CCP, and 
Lin Piao was elected Vice Chairman. The composi-
tion of the Politburo and its Standing Committee 
reflected the fact that loyalty to Mao and Lin was 
a strong consideration in selection for those 
elite bodies. 
Mao and the Sino-Soviet Conflict 
The Sino-Soviet dispute, which might partially 
be called the Mao-Soviet rift, took root in the 
early days of the CCP and began to blossom in the 
decade of the fifties. It was in 1956 that Mao 
reacted against Nikita Khrushchev's famous de-
Stalinization address to the 20th CPSU Congress 
in February. Mao is reported to have told Anastas 
Mikoyan in April that Stalin's merits outweighed 
his faults. 
Mao's public reaction to "de-Stalinization" 
was expressed in "On the Historical Experience of 
the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," which appeared 
as an editorial in the Jen-min Jih-pao of 5 April 
1956. A second editorial, "More on the Historical 
Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," 
was published on 29 December 1956. The editorials 
disapproved of the lack of Soviet self-criticism 
and censured Khrushchev's failure to consult with 
other Communist parties in advance and to make an

overall analysis of Stalin. In Mao's logic, to 
affiim that Stalin's whole policy during the last 
two decades of his life was basically a series of 
crimes and errors was to cast discredit on the 
entire world Communist movement and on the Chinese 
Communists who had come to power with the support 
of this movement. Khrushchev's attempt to estab-
lish a complete separation between Stalin and the 
system he had dominated for a generation appeared 
to Mao logically absurd and politically explosive. 
KHRUSHCHEV (2ND FROM LEFT), LIU SHAO-CHII, MAO, 
PIENG CHEN, 2 OCT i959 
The year 1959 saw Sino-Soviet relations deterio-
rate at a markedly fast pace due to such factors as 
Khrushchev's "peaceful coexistence" line and dis-
sensions over China's border conflict with India. 
Moscow's refusal to provide Peking with specifica-
tions on an atomic bomb and Khrushchev's suggestion 
that year that Mao consider accepting a two-China

C-, 
Li 
policy served to widen the gap between the two 
powers. The U-2 incident of I May 1960 provided 
Mao with more ammunition in his war of words as he 
implicitly taunted Khrushchev for having displayed 
"illusions" about imperialism and peaceful coexis-
tence. 
Heightened polemics at the Romanian Workers' 
Party Congress of June 1960 and at the 81-party 
meeting in Moscow in November, coupled with the 
recall of all Soviet experts in China the same 
year, added new strains to Sino-Soviet tension. 
Many letters, statements and communiques began 
to pass between Peking and Moscow as the former 
attacked "revisionist" Yugoslavia (meaning the 
Soviet Union) while the latter counterattacked 
"doctrinaire" Albania (meaning China). 
In 1962 Mao openly challenged Soviet authority 
in the world Communist movement. At the 10th CCP-
CC plenum, in September, Mao struck out at Khrush-
chev, publicly naming him as a wrecker of the 
socialist camp and the "betrayer" of Castro. The 
situation continued, and in mid-1963 Teng Hsiao-
p'ing held fruitless talks with the Soviets in 
Moscow. Mao was pointedly present at the airport 
to see Teng off and to welcome him back from his 
trip. 
The Chinese continued to issue a series of 
letters to Moscow. The language and style were so 
similar to Mao's that their authorship was widely 
attributed to him. In any case, it is clear from 
their importance that Mao at least authorized them. 
The letters contained endless charges against the 
Soviet Union and presented arguments, often char-
acterized by pungent wit and keen logic, that 
China's sponsorship of continuing revolutionary 
activity in the "Third World" was the only hope 
for sustaining the international Communist move-
ment. Soviet responses indicated their sensi-
tivity on a number of issues, but Mao's goal of 
turning Soviet policies around were, in large 
part, a failure as of the mid-1960's. 
The replacement of Khrushchev with Leonid 
Brezhnev and Aleksey Kosygin in 1964 failed to

alleviate Sino-Soviet tensions. Kosygin tried 
unsuccessfully to negotiate a reconciliation with 
the Chinese. PLA Chief of Staff Lo Jui-ch'ing 
advocated a rapprochement with the Soviets, but 
Lo soon became one of the purge victims (November 
1965) of the Cultural Revolution. At the 11th 
CCP plenum, in August 1966, Mao obtained sufficient 
voting strength to carry his policies in the Polit-
buro and to keep China on an independent course of 
action. 
Mao's Family  
Mao has had four wives. The first, whom he 
married at 14, was a girl 6 years his senior with 
whom he never lived. It was a marriage arranged 
by his parents following traditional Chinese cus-
toms. No other information is available on his 
first wife. 
In 1920 Mao married Yang Klai-hui daughter 
of his former teacher, Yang Ch'ang-ch'i. They 
had two sons: An-ying was born in 1922, educated 
in the Soviet Union, and killed in Korea in 1950; 
An-ching, also educated in the Soviet Union, 
became a translator of Russian political works. 
Yang K'ai-hui was executed by the KMT in 1930. 
Mao's third wife was Ho Tzu-chen, reportedly 
a normal school graduate and a party member from 
1927. Mao married Ho around 1930, and she bore 
him five children, four of whom were left with var-
ious friends during the Long March. Ho was one of 
about 30 women who survived the March despite her  
having been injured or wounded several times. 
About 1937 Mao married an actress in Yenan 
named Lan P'ing. This is his present wife, Chiang 
Ch'ing, by whom he has two daughters. Li Na (Hsiao 
Li) was born in 1943, and Mao Ming was born in 1951. 
Both were still living at home as of 1957, and one 
was reported to be a history student at Peking 
University in 1959. Li Na is supposedly married 
to Politburo member Yao Wen-yaan.

Mao had two brothers: Mao Tse-min was director 
of the Financial Department of the Sinkiang Provin-
cial Government before his execution--probably by 
the KMT--in 1943; and Mao Tse-tan, once a command-
er of a Red division, died in battle in 1935. The 
KMT executed a younger sister. 
Mao Tse-tung--the Man 
In the past, Mao has been said to have the 
naturalness and simplicity of a peasant. He has 
long been noted as a man of simple tastes, plain 
speech and plain living, but he occasionally appears 
coarse and abrupt. He smokes, drinks little in the 
line of alcoholic beverages, and consumes large 
quantities of tea. Up to 1957 Mao had been known

as a good orator, speaking in a high-pitched voice 
with a noticeable Hunanese accent. He has been 
overweight for some time but apparently has reduced 
slightly in recent years. Mao is taller than most 
Chinese and has prominent cheekbones, long slender 
hands and a receding hairline.
