 ASIAN NATIONALISM
 The crux of the problem for America
 is to bring American power, to bear in
 Asia on terms acceptable to Asian na-
 tionalism.                                       It is; a difficult but not an
 impossible task, ' Communist China's at-
 tacks on Korea, Tibet, and India had
 alerted neighboring countries to a devel-
 oping pattern of expansionist design.
 The unsuccessful, Communist-inspired
 coup d'etat In Indonesia last year pro-
 jected this design Into the forefront of
 Asian consciousness.  The result was a
 greatly heightened realization that Corn-:
 munist China, soon to become a nuclear;
 power, has everybody's security problem

 -.Trod SALIFNT ELEMENTS  OF AMERICAN  POLICY
 The salient elements of American pol-
 Icy emerge from this brief recital of
 recent events. The first is that, follow-
 ing the end of the Second World War,
 there was a deliberate attempt to orient
 American policy away from Asia and
 the Pacific toward Europe and the At-
 lantic.  The second is that American
 policy In Asia has been essentially pas-
 sive in character, developed and pur-
 sued mainly in response to Communist
 initiatives in subversion, aggression, and
 conquest. In short, the United States
 has been a reluctant participant in the
 affairs of Asia.
 UNLIMITED COMMITMENT IN EUROPE, LIMITED
 COMMITMENT IN ASIA
 That reluctance did not spring from
 a new spirit of Isolationism among the
 American people: It sprang rather from
 the feeling that prevailed among the
 makers of American foreign polic at the
 The American presence In Vietnam
 makes sense only when viewed in the
 historical context of the development of
 the United States as a Pacific power.
 To recall this chapter of American his-
 tory Is not, of course, necessarily to jus-
 tify the motives that brought the United
 States to Asia.  The truth is that the
 American Republic, having isolated itself
 from the affairs of Europe and having
 had no share in the spoliation of Africa,
 was obliged to turn to Asia, across the
 Pacific as the object of its belated im-
 perialist attentions.
 NO MORE IMPERIALIST AMBITIONS IN ASIA
 Today, having relinquished control of
 the Philippines and terminated the oc-
 cupation of Japan, the United States
 can truthfully disavow any surviving ini-
 periallst ambitions in Asia.  The pres-
 ence of American bases and American
 troops In South Korea, Japan, Okinawa
 and the Philippines could be justified, as
 aiming solely to deter or repel any enl-
 croachments of Communist power in
 these areas.

 tural affinities with Europe probably jus-
 tified this attitude in a situation where
 -American power was, in any case, inade-
 ciuatc to police the world as a whole.
 VIETNAM JUSTIFIED NEITHER DY AFFINITY NOR
 UN KOREA EXAMPLE
 Today, we face the fact of massive
 ;American involvement in Vietnam--in a
 struggle which can neither be explained
 on the basis of recognized affinities nor
 justified by the example of the previous
 United Nations action In Korea.
 IIISrORY-UNITED STATES WAS FIRST PACIFIC
 POWER DEFORE IT WAS AN ATLANTIC POWER
 History, however, may provide both
 explanation  and  justification.   One
 ;elementary fact of American history is
 that the United States was a Pacific
 power long before it became an Atlantic
 power. President Washington's injunc-
 tions against "entangling alliances" and
 President Monroe's promulgation of the
 doctrine that bears his name insured
 America's virtual i isolation from Eu-
 ropean affairs.  This isolation lasted a
 long time, and America did not become
 an Atlantic power until after the First
 World War.
 COMMODORE  PERRY AND  JAPAN,  PHILIPPINES
 HAWAII, AND ALASKA
 By contrast, the United States became
 a Pacific power just before the Civil War,
 when Commodore Perry opened feudal
 Japan to the modern world.  This was
 followed at the turn of the last century
 by the acquisition of the Philippines,
 Hawaii and Alaska, and by American
 support of the open door policy in China.
 American rule over the Philippines, the
 war in the Pacific, and the American
 occupation  of Japan confirmed and
 strengthened the status of the United
 States as a Pacific power.
 tonal integrity.  They should give every
 assurance that they are not in Vietnam,
 or anywhere else in Asia, for the purpose
 of political hegemony or economic gain.
 This, President Johnson has repeatedly
 done.
 Such avowals of American purpose
 would correspond to the deepest aspira-
 tions of the non-Communist Asian na-
 tions themselves.  Their common hope
 and desire is to be given an opportunity
 to consolidate their independence, to
 translate it in terms of a better life for
 their citizens, to determine and shape the
 destiny of their country without outside
 Interference of any kind.  To achieve
 these goals these non-Communist na-

 "Peking-Jakarta axis" which the Indo-

 In effect, and almost without realiz-
 ing it, we are even now already reaping
 valuable dividends from the American
 presence in Vietnam. Those benefits are
 certain to multiply as the non-Commu-
 nist neighbors of China understand that
 their security is guaranteed by the um-
 brella of American power.  The assur-
 ance that has been given by President
 Johnson that this protccl,iou will not
 suddenly be withdrawn tomorrow, thus
 leaving then to the mercy of Chinese
 communism, is an indispensable factor
 in maintaining the stability of south-
 east'Asia.
 DOMINO THEORY
 The so-called "domino theory" which
 many experts tend to discount, may be
 an oversimplification. But it is certainly
 correct to argue that a country like
 Thailand, for example, Is hardly likely
 to depend for its security on an Amer-
 lean army that has been defeated or has
 withdrawn under fire from Vietnam.
 Thailand would have to adjust to Chin-
 ese hegemony in Asia and its attitude
 would be shared in varying degrees by
 Laos, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Japan,
 and the Philippines:

 But the critics were more cruel. And
 even the veterans scoff at our own sears
 in battle.  One of these scars I received
 in trying to save an American comrade.
 "Where is he now?" they ask.  "lle is
 dead like many of our dreams."
 Yes, my American comrade died ill my
 arms. We were surrounded and we had
 to break out. He fell and, as he tried to
 crawl to safety, I returned to him, to
 fall at his side-Pllipino and American
 blood commingling In Philippine soil.
 As I cradled him in my arras to a fox-
 hole, he died with the words; "Tell them
 back home, you who will live, my only
 regret in dying is that America has failed
 US."
 I, the Filipino, assured the American,
 as if this would assuage his dying, "No,
 America does not forget and will not fail
 us.,'
 Many years are past.  Time should
 have muted the toile of confidence and
 the tyranny of circumstance should have
 !eroded the memory but still today, I say;
 to you as I have said to my people:
 'America does not forget. America will
 not fail us.'
