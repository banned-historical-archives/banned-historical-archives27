 "Go _V.ll What Did Mr. Trudeau Say When You Told Him What To Dc
 With. His 9 Million Tons of Wheat?"
 ever notorious for impeccable trade habits, the Soviets now
 have let their three-year wheat purchase agreement with Canada expire with some
 nine million tons left unpaid for and undelivered.   (See attached news story.)
 Should the Soviets fail to meet the terms of the June 1966 contract (reportedly
 it had no stretchout clause), it may cost Canada between $200 million and $300
 million.  Neither party has publicly conceded default.
 The Soviets don't really need wheat this year as they did in 1966 and there
 are two practical explanations for their foot-dragging:  sharp internal Soviet
 competition for hard currency reserves, and the hope of getting a better deal
 while international wheat prices stay low.  Soviet eagerness for Western busi-
 ness portends against outright default.  Rather, the Soviets might try to
 pressure Canada into accepting soft currency credits, or even a barter arrange-
 ment, as part payment.  Recall that it was just such soft currency deals that
 caused West Germany's Krupp industries to hover on the brink of disaster:
 Krupp became overextended in East Europe, especially in the USSR, and couldn't
 convert the repayments into hard currency at high enough prices.

 "FISHERMEN'S RESERVES"
 Fishing ships flying the Soviet flag can be encountered on near and
 distant'seas and on the expanses of the World Ocean.  Every year they
 catch many millions of tons of fish and products of the sea.  Our fleet
 is constantly supplemented with modern ships.  Fishing ports are being
 developed.  The equipping of shipyards and other'shore..enterprises is
 improving.
 In all the fishing basins there are crews that have a complete
 mastery of the technology of sea fishing and get good catches.  The
 Murmansk refrigerator-ship trawler "Apatit," where the captain and
 director is Hero of Socialist Labor I. T. Shan'kov, upon returning from
 the first trip this year to the shores of Southwest Africa,. delivered in
 its hold 43,400 centners of valuable fish output, with a plan?of 35,700
 centners for the first half-year.  The crew obtained good economic indi-
 ces and conserved fishing armament, fuel, and packaging materials.  At
 the present time it is on a second trip and is also successfully coping
 with the assignment.  There are many such examples.  In the Norhtern,
 Western, and Far Eastern Basins, dozens of ship's crews have already
 completed their yearly assignments.
 And yet the great reserves that the fishing industry has at its
 disposal have -not been put into action everywhere.  Some of the fishing
 ships operate at less than full workload.  Too much time is spent in
 moves to new areas, stays at anchor in ports, and especially for the
 repair of the ships.  Often the ships remain idle, engaging in no
 fishing operations, because of the poor organization of acceptance
 of fish by the floating bases [mother ships] and the transport refrigera-.
 for ships.
 A very important tqsk of the managers of fishing organizations
 and ship's crews is the putting to an end of the unproductive idle time
 of the fleet, the increasing of the effectiveness of utilization of every
 trawler, refrigerator ship, every floating base.  The proposals concerning
 the organization of the work of the fish-catching and fish-processing
 ships in a new manner are deserving of attention. At the present time
 the ships operate in uncoordinated way, are subordinate to different
 administrations, and sometimes the floating bases refuse to accept the
 fish that has been caught.  In the Western Basin it has been decided,
 by way of an experiment, to assign a group of trawlers to a floating base,
 so that they can have a single trip plan and so that the responsibility
 for its fulfillment can be borne not only by the captains of the fishing
 ships, but also by the floating-base crew.  That will make it possible to
 achieve a better maneuvering of the fishing fleet and the manpower, and
 will increase the self-interestedness of the crews in the fulfillment
 of the plans.

 stores, for example, herring or other fish that is constantly in demand.
 That is why it is necessary to take all steps to increase the catch of the
 most valuable food fish, to furnish it to the customer primarily in
 processed form, and to deliver to the trade network more live and fresh
 fish and more smoked products. Workers in production and in trade have
 been called upon to study the purchasers' demands constantly.  The adverti-
 sing of fish commodities, especially new types of fish obtained from
 the ocean-going fleet and various other products of the sea, is in need: of
 fundamental improvement.
 A major source of supplying the public with a variety of tasty
 fish must continue to be found in our internal bodies of water --
 ~rivers, lakes, ponds, reservoirs.  For that purpose it is necessary to
 'achieve a sharp increase in their productivity, to organize on a mass
 ,scale the artificial reproduction of valuable commercial fish, and to
 combat more actively the pollution of bodies of water.  Unfortunately,
 .new fishing areas, new pond and lake managements are planned and built
 slowly, and are poorly provided with material resources.
 The economic reform is contributing to the increase in the
 effectiveness of production, and to the improvement in the variety and
 quality of fish output.  Practice shoes that fishing ships and enterprises
 that operate in the new way make more complete utilization of their
 reserves and achieve higher economic indices.  It is very important that
 new release prices be established for certain types of fish that are
 caught'which were loss items for the branch.  That will contribute to
 the production of output needxd by the public and will noticeably expand
 the opportunities of increasing the funds for the development of produc-
 tion and the providing of material incentives at the enterprises.  The
 improvement of methods of.planning and economic stimulation as applicable
 to the specific conditions of the branch is one of the vital tasks of
 the personnel in the fishing industry.
 The present-day technical level of production of fish output
 demands the broad application of electronics, means of automation, the
 achievements of chemistry and other branches of science and technology.
 Much more will have to be done by our scientists, designers, machine
 builders, and instrument builders.  For example, the processing of the
 caught fish is insufficiently mechanized.  The Ministry of Machine Building
 for Light and Food Industry and Household Appliances USSR has been called
 upon to show some concern for the mass production of equipment needed by
 the people in the fishing industry.' The instrument builders are supposed
 to arm the fleet with improved searching apparatus, means of communication,
 and electronic navigation equipment.
 For months the fishermen are out on the ocean, far from their
 beloved shores, far from their families, fishing during the summer and
 during the winter, often in complicated conditions.  It is necessary to
 demonstrate the maximum amount of concern for their labor, their living
 conditions, their recreation.  This includes everything -- the fishing
 gear, 'the providing for the cultural and everyday needs of the crews,
 the regular delivery of mail to the ships, the construction of housing
 for fishermen, and many other things.

 work in a well-directed manner to assure that each communist serves as
 an example in labor and a pioneer in the competition for the increase of
 production of fish output and for' the preterm fulfillment of the

 During these, days the people on the ships, at the enterprises, and
 .at the fish farms  'together with the entire nature, are serving a labor
 watch in honor of the hundredth anniversary of the birth of V. I. Lenin,
 and have developed on a broad scale the struggle for the receiving of Lenin
 'Jubilee Honorary Certificates and Jubilee Medals.  'L'he crews of 14 fishing
 ships in Kamchatskaya Oblast which have already completed the yearly plan
 have decided to give to the country an additional 140,000 centners of
 edible fish.  Their example was followed by the leading crews of. the
 Northern, Western, and other basins.  Let us hope that the present year
 will be, for the fishermen,. a year of great catches and. new labor

 NEW YORK TIMES,

 ECONOMIC REFORM
 GAINS IN HUNGARY
 Budapest Acts Cautiously to
 CPVR@K-f New. Ideas
 BUDAPEST (UPI)-While the'
 reform movement in neighbor-
 Ing Czechoslovakia has been
 cut short in tragedy and confu-
 sion, the Hungarians now blaze
 the trail in Eastern Europe withi
 fresh ideas and changes.
 They .do it quietly and cau-
 tiously, partly for fear of up-
 setting the Soviet Union and
 partly because they know that
 sweeping or premature reforms
 of the hated, top-heavy, Soviet-
 type economy might easily lead
 to massive unemployment, in-
 flation and anarchy.
 So that now, when stock is
 being taken of the changes be-
 gun in January, 1968, the most
 hopeful conclusion in Budapest
 Is that moves for partial free-
 ing of prices, greater responsi-
 bility given to enterprise man-
 agements and other innovations
 have at least not. caused any
 violent dislocations while they
 have certainly given the econ-
 omy a new psychological cli-
 mate.
 CPYRGHT
 The gross national product-
 value of all goods and services
 -grew by 5 to 6 per cent in
 1968, which was markedly less
 than in 1967 when the growth
 was 9 per cent. But this was
 exceptional: besides, the slower
 growth now can largely be ex-
 plained by the more general in-
 troduction of a shorter working,
 week.
 Many Prices Freed
 Something like one third of,
 all items sold in ? shops and.
 many other goods have seen
 their prices entirely freed from
 overnment  control.  Other
 prices are determined by the
 me lay of supply and de-
 and within set limits at both
 nds. Yet others have their ceil-
 ngs fixed by the Government.
 e prices of a few items,
 otably essential raw materials,
 ay always be laid down by
 entral authorities.
 In principle, it. is now left to
 nterprise managers themselves
 o decide what they should pro-
 uce, how much and where to
 ell it, at home or abroad.
 tate-owned companies negoti-
 te freely with each other for
 he supply of goods and their
 arketing, they hire and fire
 abor according to their require-
 laotive., ..?                               ,  .        -1

 This year, for the first time,
 wage levels are freely negoti-
 able.
 Increasingly;  the  national
 planning authorities will be left
 only with safeguarding broad
 indicators and developments,
 while resorting to credit policy,
 taxation and other "regulating
 instruments" rather than direct
 Intervention.
 Hungarians now feel that a
 large  measure  of  economic
 stability can be maintained by
 such methods while individual!
 and local initiative is being en?
 couraged as greater responsi?
 bilities are afforded to enter-
 prise managements and more
 rational  incentives  provided.
 Rezso Nyers, the father of the
 Hungarian reform-.a basically
 self-educated man in his forties,
 known for his rugged common
 sense  and pragmatism-has
 been given the green light for
 changes to continue and gather
 momentum.
 Problem Is Huge
 The achievements so far are
 necessarily small if measured
 against the . magnitude of the
 task of revamping the entire
 economic  structure,  making
 sense of the price 'system, ori-
 entating Industry along lines
 that are most profitable for,
 Hungary and generally placing;
 economic activity on a sound,'
 self=paying  footing.  Officials
 and observers in Budapest reck-
 on it might take as much as
 10 or even 15 years'to attain
 the broad aims of the new eco-
 nomic mechanism.
 But no one can fail to -he
 encouraged by so much, frank-
 ly spelled out, awareness of the
 need to revolutionize (or per.
 haps counter-revolutionize) the
 orthodox Communist pattern of
 Hungarian economy. That this
 N nera.scarv in order that dual.
 ity of production, productivity
 and standard of living can bel
 raised, is plainy accepted by
 those who matter in Hungarian
 political circles.
 .One of the chief yardsticks
 for measuring the success of
 the reform must be the extent
 to which the crushing burden
 of Government subsidies paid
 out to uneconomic enterprise,
 can be reduced. According to
 one source, this amounted last`
 year to $3.5-billion. This was
 somewhat over the level in
 1967, but the difference might
 have arisen because of new ac-
 counting methods.

 THE COMMUNIST SCENE
 (2L August - 26 September 1969)
 I.   Brezhnev Doctrine Embraces China
 The Brezhnev Doctrine of limited sovereignty was originally launched
 in a Pravda article of 26 September 1968 as a doctrinal legitimization of
 the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.   Speaking at the
 Polish Communist Party Congress in October 1968, Brezhnev himself confirmed
 this doctrine, which asserts the right of the Soviet Union to intervene in
 any way it deems necessary when it decides socialism is threatened in any
 country within the "socialist commonwealth:"  While the Soviets have claimed
 that this doctrine of "limited sovereignty" (in those terms) is an invention
 of their enemies, they have reiterated it in their own terms at discreet
 intervals up to the present.   From the outset, the doctrine raised specu-
 lation not only in the free world, but among Communists, notably the Yugo-
 slavs (quite openly) and the maverick Rumanians (somewhat more indirectly),
 as to whether the doctrine was supposed to apply to all Communist countries.
 Until now it strained plausibility to claim that the Soviets had in mind
 not only the East European Satellites, but also Communist China.   But now
 the Soviets have made it clear that they do indeed embrace China under the
 protective custody of the Brezhnev Doctrine.
 A Soviet journalist, Victor Louis, who among his various functions is
 also the Moscow correspondent of the London Evening News, wrote what would
 appear to be an ordinary news commentary for the Evening News of 16 Septem-
 ber (full text attached).  The article, in ostensibly raising questions as
 to the applicability of the Brezhnev Doctrine to Communist China, in actual-
 ity asserts that it is indeed applicable.  What gives his assertion the
 weight of real authority is the fact that Louis has been widely known and
 labeled as an agent through whom the KGB, the Soviet secret police organi-
 zation, has at times deliberately launched policy initiatives carrying the
 sanction of the Soviet government.   For example, last year Louis visited
 Taiwan and was authorized to invite Nationalist Chinese newsmen to visit
 the Soviet Union.   This move was universally interpreted as a Soviet step
 toward rapprochement with Nationalist China.   Similarly, Louis' present
 pronouncement can be taken as a Soviet declaration that they arrogate to
 themselves the right to intervene in Communist China if they deem it neces-
 sary in the best interests of "international socialism."
 The big question causing concern to all responsible outsiders is whether
 this inclusion of China might mean that the Soviets will actually act on the
 doctrine and attack the Chinese.   Outsiders to the secret and mysterious
 realm of Communist inter-relations can only hope that this will not be the
 case and that the other cold-blooded possibilities outlined by Louis in his
 article (especially pre-emptive nuclear strikes against China) are nothing
 more than crude sabre-rattling.   Even as a propaganda move, the article is

 an unfortunate ploy and again raises the ever more frequently recurring
 question as to the diplomatic competence of the Soviet leadership.   (As
 an incidental matter, it is surprising that the leading free world Commu-
 nist parties do not take a stronger stand regarding the conflict, nor of-
 fer to mediate it as "honest brokers," and even stranger that they seem
 to make no effort to find out first hand what is really happening, for
 example by sending news reporters to the scene.)
 How the Louis article fits in the Kosygin visit to Peking, with ;;the
 aftermath of Ho Chi Minh's death, with the rumored illness of Mao, with
 the temporary suspension of Soviet anti-Chinese propaganda, and the re-
 ports of armed border incursions, and how these all affect the vital ques-
 tion of peace or war can only be speculated upon.   Unfortunately, in the
 closed totalitarian societies represented by the Soviet Union and China,
 access even to ordinary facts and information is not a public right as it
 is in the non-Communist world.
 II.   The Brezhnev Doctrine in Yugoslavia
 "In the assessment of present Soviet-Yugoslav relations, both sides
 stressed the significance which they attach to the principles contained
 in the 1955 Belgrade Declaration of the governments of the Soviet Union
 and Yugoslavia and as reaffirmed during the meeting of the President of
 the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with the Soviet leaders in
 Moscow in 1956, documents which lay down the principles of respect for
 sovereignty, equality, and noninterference in internal affairs...."
 This excerpt from the Soviet-Yugoslav communique resulting from the
 official visit of Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko to Yugoslavia 2-6 Sep-
 tember appears on the surface to be a concession on the part of the Sovi-
 ets toward the Yugoslav point of view concerning the proper relations be-
 tween Communist states.  With the stress on "sovereignty, equality, and
 noninterference" and the absence of a reference to the "duty" of "inter-
 national socialism" (the formula used to represent the Brezhnev Doctrine),
 the Yugoslavs won a verbal victory for their point of view over the Brezh-
 nev Doctrine.   Whether it was Soviet two-faced cynicism or a matter of
 substance is debatable, but it should be noted that, first of all, Gromyko
 was far from renouncing the Soviet doctrine and, secondly, he answered
 evasively to a pointed question during a press conference in Belgrade in
 which he was asked whether he regarded Yugoslavia as a part of the "so-
 cialist commonwealth" and therefore subject to the Brezhnev Doctrine.
 By way of answer, he chose to refer to an earlier speech of his in which
 Yugoslavia was treated separately from other socialist states but was
 not expressly excluded from the "commonwealth."
 Other than this crucial point, the visit seems to have tried to re-
 pair the relations damaged by the invasion of Czechoslovakia. This was
 accomplished more by negative moves such as stopping or softening the
 polemics, and avoiding mention of or taking positions on, issues on which
 they disagree (e.g. relative Yugoslav detachment from the Sino-Soviet
 conflict, the Yugoslav promotion of non-alignment, Yugoslav's friendly

 relations with the West, etc.).  A mutual effort was made to say cordial
 things about each other and to emphasize what they could of their common
 ideological platitudes, for example, their common hostility to capitalism,
 imperialism, the bourgeois enemy, etc.   The Soviets hoped thereby to stop
 Yugoslav doctrinal provocations over the issue of Czechoslovakia and per-
 haps to enlist support on other international initiatives, while the Yugo-
 slavs may be looking for advantages in trade relations, though keeping a
 wary eye on the limited sovereignty doctrine.
 III.   Czechoslovakia under the Brezhnev Doctrine
 The Brezhnev Doctrine had its origins in the Soviet suppression of
 "humane Communism" in Czechoslovakia under the now sidelined, former Sec-
 retary General of the Czechoslovak Communist Party (CSCP), Alexander
 Dubcek.   Czechoslovakia's evolution since Dubcek's ouster and replacement
 by Gustav Husak last April is an example of the continuing application of
 the limited sovereignty concept.  Dubcek was ousted and Husak installed
 under the direction of the Soviet Politburo, not by independent Czecho-
 slovak action.   The elaborate security and police precautions taken to
 keep commemoration of the first anniversary of the Soviet invasion under
 control were undertaken under the watchful supervision of the Soviets.
 The progressive elimination of all liberals in the party and in positions
 of public influence of any kind has also been Soviet-directed.   The daily
 events in Czechoslovakia are a sad chronicle of this continuing denial of
 Czech sovereignty as well as of the basic freedoms of a people.   That the
 main leaders of the 1968 experiment in "humane communism" (at least Dubcek
 and Josef Smrkovsky, if not Prime Minister Cernik) will suffer further
 denigration and;.punishment.~is not in doubt -- only what the nature of
 the denigration will be and when it is to take place.   To observe the
 forms of legality, their fate will be made known after a Central Committee
 Plenum, though the decision, again, will have been made by the Soviets,
 with the announcement coming from their Czech puppets.

 Moscow hitherto has denied the existence

 Even if his article reached the Evening
 News before Mr. Kosygin's surprise visit
 to Peking, its publication could have been
 stopped. .
 As matters stand today, Mr. Louis's arti
 cle has introduced a new negative element
 into the Sino-Soviet discussion. A newsreel
 of Mr. Kosygin and Mr. Chou taking leave.
 showed that the two men had come closer
 to each, other's views. The, Chinese press.
 and radio no longer refer to the "renegade
 Brezhnev-Kosygin clique." Mr. Kosygin's
 name has ceased to be a matter of abuse..
 !Dnly "Brezhnev & Co." are supposed to be
 the villains.
 Diferences hinted
 Some "sources" in Moscow seem to have
 admitted that the Sino-Sovict dispute could
 be solved and that the border revisions
 demanded by Peking actually cover only
 about 40,000 square miles. The more-than-a-'
 million square miles which, Peking says,
 were ceded to Russia in the past century as
 a result of "unequal treaties" now are said
 to have been a political argument and not
 a formal revendication.
 The only valid explanation for the pub-'
 lication of Mr. Louis's article at this par-
 ticular time seems ' to be that differences
 regarding policy toward China continue to
 exist among the Soviet leaders.
 .Mr. Louis's presumed principal, the XBG,
 headed  by alternate  Politburo member
 Yuri V. Andropov, is subordinate to Gen-
 eral Secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev rather
 than to Premier Kosygin. It also is possible
 that members of the military high com-
 mand would like to exert pressure on China.

 campaign In the Soviet press is bound to heighten'
 world fear of a Moscow-Peking conflict. It seems in-'
 credible that the Kremlin can be seriously considering
 a preventive war against China or even an aerial strike'
 at}Chinese nuclear facilities. Yet little more than a1
 year ago it seemed equally incredible that Soviets
 troops would invade Czechoslovakia. It required only,
 a few months advance indoctrination to make most'
 Soviet citizens accept the "necessity" of "saving
 Czechoslovakia; the "Hate China" indoctrination has
 gope on for almost a decade.
 Whatever Brezhnev & Co. may intend, much recent
 Soviet comment on China has implied that Mao is ?a'
 paper tiger, who could be defeated easily if the need
 arose.- Sovietreaders have been presented a picture of
 a chaotic China in the grip ofvirtual civil war. Most
 pointedly, perhaps, the new commander of the Soviet
 Far' Eastern .Forces, rocket specialist Gen. V. F.
 Tolilbko, has recently recalled the Soviet-Chinese
 border miniwar in 1929. He stressed how easily rela-,
 tidely small Soviet forces were able orl that occasion

 illiam P. Rogers; Secretary of
 ate, made a week ago.
 Addressing a group of students
 nding up their summer em-
 1 yment  as "executive in-

 ~ hat do you people feel the
 noes are that the Soviet Un-
 that probably it will not do so,'!
 Mr. Rogers answered.
 He added, "The Russians
 would be faced with a very seri-
 ous problem because, although if
 they made v strike against Com-
 munist China they could take.
 over a good segment of that
 area up near Peking-they prob-
 ably could even take over Pe-
 king-but then they would be-
 come involved In a land, war.
 with 800,000,000 Chinese.   '
 "That would be a very diffi
 cult thing for them to handle,
 and I think they are quite aware
 of that, even though they have l
 moved military equipment up to-
 ward the Chinese border."
 Mr. Rogers went on to volun-
 teer a commentary on the possi.
 bilities of Peking initiating a
 "YtYcin`i%~a an atmosphere of
 political crisis and inflicted
 great damage to the country's
 economy."
 The party newspaper said
 again that a. "war psychosis"
 was being created in China and.
 that the population was being
 ,alerted for possible nuclear
 !war. On the other hand, it reas-,
 fsured the Soviet people that
 "there is a great distance be..
 tween the schemes of the Mao.
 fists, their noisy threats ad-
 dressed to the Soviet Union, and
 the real possiblility of realizing
 them."
 The border clashes, Pravda
 said, are part of the chain of
 "hostile actions by the Peking
 leadership  which  does  not
 cease  its  absurd territorial.
 claims on the Soviet Union."
 "It deliberately continues to.
 create tension in various sec-
 tions of the Chinese-Soviet bor-
 'der, engineering the intrusion of
 armed groups. into Soviet t rrl-,
 tarp and creating dangerous sit-
 u atdons.

 repeated offers to ne
 gotiate differences with the Chi-

 "The Chinese Communists, I
 think, realize that they are not
 really able militarily to cope
 with the Soviet Union; so we
 rather doubt that they would ini-
 tiate ai major attack," Mr. Rog-
 ers said.
 "Very Permanent"
 Then, referring to the more
 than  430  Sino-Soviet  border
 clashes that Peking claims have
 occurred this year and blames
 on Moscow, including the latest
 one on August 13, Mr. Rogers
 added:
 "Our best judgment Is that the
 border clashes and incidents
 probably will continue to recur.
 We are convinced the hostility
 between the two is very deep
 and very permanent. We are
 quite conscious, though, of the
 fact that these border incidents

 Three Categories
 Speaking of conflicts, amon
 the reports, they divided the

 consisting of reports that Sovie
 leaders, as hosts in June to a
 international conference of Com
 munist parties at Moscow, ha
 merely lectured , their gues
 about "the great threat fro
 China."
 The second category com-
 prised reports that the Russian
 had warned the leaders of just
 some countries' Communist par .
 ties that Peking might escalat
 the border situation and genera
 hostility to a point where th
 Russians might have to tak
 military action.
 To the third category, the re-
 ports' collators assigned those
 they called the ,, 'most extreme",-meaning, they explained, re
 ports that Moscow has been tell
 ing Its Warsaw Pact allies that
 the Soviet Air Force might have
 to "take out" Communist Chin
 a's nuclear arms installation
 and wants to know what attitude
 its allies would take in that
 event.
 The collators professed t
 know that some of the 'soviet
 Union's East European allies an
 concerned" lest they be called o
 to aid it in a Sino-Soviet war
 They also suggested that the
 looser language appearing i

 of Communist China startled
 foreign diplomats and observ-

 ided today on the political
 significance of the talks.
 The meeting was reported
 ere about a dozen hours late,
 in the middle of the night, in
 a brief dispatch car;ied by
 sinhua, the Chinese Commu-
 nist press agency. The dispatch
 said merely that the two Pre-

 [In New Delhi, the Foreign
 Ministry said today that com-

 The.briefness of the dispatch

 In foreign quarters here, where.
 the initial reaction was to con-
 sider the meeting as a historic,
 event in view of the protracted
 Chinese-Soviet dispute.
 This morning, Renmin Ribao,
 official newspaper of, the Cen-
 tral Committee of Chinese Com-i
 munist  party,  reported  thell
 meeting by printing the Hsin-l
 hua dispatch on an inside page.,
 At the same time the paper con-1
 tinued Its attacks on the Soviet
 Union.                        i
 Indications were that the Lo?
 sygin-Chou meeting took place;
 around 3. P.M. yesterday and-
 lasted about one hour. Asked
 to comment, Soviet Embassy

 the meeting than what had al-

 accorded scant cordiality when
 the did.
 Neither the Russians nor the
 Chinese have given any hint
 of what was discussed, but
 since the Soviet Union initi-
 ated the encounter, it is pro-
 able that Mr. Kosygin stressed
 the Soviet desire for a general
 conference to settle border dis-
 putes and other problems.
 The Chinese so far have not
 accepted Moscow proposals for
 a general conference and it is
 unlikely Mr. Chou did so yes-
 terday. Some observers here
 sat the Chinese do not want a
 !border settlement because of
 the propaganda value in being
 able to depict the Russians as
 aggressors.
 There is some speculation
 that Mr. Kosygin asked about
 reports  that  Mao  Tse-tung,
 chairman of the Chinese Com-

 fJSSIA'S CHINESE BOGEY
 IT IS UNLIKELY THAT Russia's round robin to friendly:
 Communist parties, alleging that China is preparing a,
 protracted frontier war and stating that Russia would not'
 tolerate this, was marked " top secret."  Moscow seems
 most anxious that both. West and East should share her
 preoccupation with the' Chinese problem. .. A 13-column':
 editorial in Pravda accused China of aggressive' intentions;
 and warned the world at large thit if war broke out'
 is no continent would be left out." There was also
 confirmation by the State Department in Washington
 that it knew of "rumours or reports ".. that Russia had
 asked other Communist parties for their reactions to the,
 possibility of a Russian nuclear, strike against China's'
 nuclear installations.
 Care must be. taken to get the Russo-Chinese' dispute
 into perspective.  It is obviously of great importance,
 and might within a decade'or two, barring other upheavals
 in the meantime,' become the most important factor in
 world' affairs'.'` For the moment, on' the basis of first
 things first, ;it ranks behind Russia's military'prepondcrance,
 in Europe, her'.hold on her satellites, her strategic arms'
 race with America, and the Middle East and Vietnam
 wars. The balance of evidence at the moment points to
 a deliberate Russian campaign to exaggerate both the-
 immediacy of , the Chinese threat and -her' own jitters iii
 the face of it.                                     '
 This  enables  Russia,  in  the contest ' for world'
 Communist leadership, to represent China not only as,
 a- heretic but also as a dangerous aggressive imperialist,
 mad dog. It could also be intended to justify a pre-emptive,
 strike if Russia should cold-bloodedly decide to settle
 the growing Chinese problem while the going was good.,
 In addition. Russia hopes to encoura;e'the West to expect
 salvation less from its own  efforts  than from the.
 repercussions of the Russo-Chinese dispute, and to assume'
 that Russia's military expansion is directed against China
 and  not  against the  West. Such  expectations  and
 assumptions remain unwarranted, and dangerous.

 A mild flirtation is going on between Mos
 dow and Belgrade.
 Moscow is doing the wooing while Marshal
 Tito sets the stage for ideological rapproche-
 ment.
 The latest indication of this is seen in
 Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A.  Gro.
 myko's talks with his Yugoslav counterpart,
 State Secretary Mirko Tepavac.
 They began on Sept. 2, and were described
 by Tanyug, the official Yugoslav news '
 agency, as having taken place "in an at-
 mosphere of frankness and mutual respect."
 Tass's international service, designed for
 Soviet diplomatic and military personnel,
 said the talks are being conducted "in a
 friendly atmosphere."
 in the case of Czechoslovakia, the right
 to invade and repress with armed force
 any Communist land that seeks to be its'
 own master, free of Moscow's iron ideo-'
 logical, economic and military rule.
 The Yugoslavs, of course, have stood
 .,fast against this doctrine ever since
 their historic 1948 break with Stalin's
 Russia. Hence their support for those'
 xnenbers of the Warsaw Pact   notably
 ,the Czechoslovaks and the Romanians -
 who have, had ' the courage to oppose,.
 total Soviet domination. Gromyko had'
 some ambiguous things to say about this
 in Belgrade, but he did sign a commu-
 nique supporting -- despite the crime"
 against Czechoslovakia - Tito's insist-4
 ence on principles of respect for sover-i
 eignty and non-interference in internal,
 national affairs.
 In lending his signature to these
 principles, Gromyko may have had some
 cynical thoughts. But he may also have
 felt, and with good reason, that a move,
 against  the ready-to-fight Yugoslavs
 could become a -very troublesome bus!
 ness indeed.
 L:astern War prompted the new approach.-

 Harder line echoed .
 Now Marshal Tito, in a speech of Aug, 27,
 has voiced opinions which might have come
 from Czechoslovak First Secretary Gustav
 Husak,

 agency., "He lives, he acts, he undermines
 our society, and hinders social progress. We
 are submerged by the West with theories,
 concepts, and conceptions of all hinds, and,
 all Are negative."
 In the Tanyug version for the West the
 speech was toned down, but a local broad-
 cast monitored by the United States In-
 formation Agency Aug. 28 was very similar
 to.the French version.
 "We should not ignore antisocialist occur-,
 'rences and tolerate the undermining activi-
 ties of some individuals who are alien to
 socialism," the Marshal was quoted in the
 monitored broadcast as saying.
 "We must act energetically and in time.
 We have the right to strike resolutely at
 those who work against the interests of so-
 cialism and to prevent [their) activities."
 "Our society has a real democracy, where
 people speak freely and freely give vent to
 their initiatives, but it is clear that there
 must be no democracy for those who act
 from an antisocialist position.... 1;'e carry
 a tremendous responsibility, because the
 revolution has not yet been concluded."
 As a sign of Soviet approval, Pravda'
 summarized Marshal Tito's speech.
 On Aug. 20, the Yugoslav weekly, Kom
 unist, welcomed Mr. Gromyko's coming ar-
 rival 'as a token of further. cooperation be
 tween the two countries in the spirit of the
 Yugoslav-Soviet reconciliation of 1955. Korn
 unist's hopeful appraisal was broadcast in'
 Russian to the U.S.S.R.
 On his arrival in Belgrade, Mr. Gromyko
 said that "the Soviet Government attaches
 great importance to the development of re-
 lations with Yugoslavia.... Both countries
 are linked-by common ideals in striving for
 socialism and communism and by a friend-
 ship tempered in the struggle against the
 fascist invaders."
 `Why have illusions?
 On the same day the district prosecutor
 of Belgrade banned and seized the latest
 issue of the literary, weekly Knijevne No.

 tack on Soviet political methods. Echoing
 earlier Yugoslav criticism of Soviet- prac-

 Yugoslavia. may, temporarily at least, be
 headed for a stricter course, more accept.
 able to the Soviet dogmatists. Marshal
 Tito's latest speech announced "a progres.
 sive selection, from bottom to top, of the
 million-strong Yugoslav League of Com-
 munists."
 "Why have illusions about this figure?"
 said the Marshal. "Do not hesitate to chase
 from our ranks those who shame us." Ac-
 cording to the French version, Marshal
 Tito even spoke . of "a purge.
 "They say in the West that Yugoslavia
 gradually is adopting a Western regime..
 That is what our enemies want, but they
 are mistaken if they imagine that we will
 deviate from our dedication to socialism."
 If Marshal Tito on this occasion has given
 in to the urgings of Yugoslavia's old-time
 Communists, he must have reasons to think
 such a policy will benefit his country.
 Albanian role seen
 Haunted by the possibility of a nuclear
 war with China, the Kremlin needs Yugo-
 slavia to hold down Albania, where the
 Chinese are . believed  to have installed
 rockets. Yugoslavia, in turn, is interested
 in bringing about a change in the hostile
 Albanian regime and also may want to ob-
 tain concessions from Bulgaria.
 These issues will not be mentioned in the'.
 final communique, but are likely to be be
 In the long run, though, it' is, doubtful
 that Yugoslavia will draw closer to the
 Kremlin or adopt a, true hard-line Com-
 munist policy. Once Marshal Tito has taken
 advantage of the present Soviet overtures,
 he is expected to resume his policy of in-
 dependence and to continue his country's
 balancing act between East and West.
 Yet the Tito speech at Zadar, on the
 Adriatic coast, does remind Yugoslavia and
 the world that the older leaders in Bel-
 grade and in other countries' national
 capitals still are Communists at heart and
 that their collaboration with the West is a
 matter. of expediency.

 L Difference of Emphasis
 This became clear at a din-
 ,ner given by Foreign Minister
 Tepavac in 'honor of Mr. Gro-
 `
 myko.
 While Mr. Tepavac in his
 (toast firmly declared that Sov-
 iiet-Yugoslav relations must be
 ased on the principles of In-
 dependence, equality and non-
 interference, Mir. Gromyko an-
 swcred that according to the
 views of his government these
 relations should be based on
 lthe principles of "socialist in-
 Iternationalism."
 "Socialist internationalism" is
 the term used by Moscow,to
 justify the occupation of Czech-I

 with which Moscow is backing
 the doctrine of limited sover-I

 that "there are certain ques-

 gives the international class struggle its

 In occupied Prague.
 In Russia on Aug. 21, 1968,
 the majority . of people felt
 as though world war had.
 broken out.. The very air,
 seemed to smell of gunfire.
 People went around. with
 long faces, all asking the
 same question: "What's going
 on in Czechoslovakia?" Many
 wept as they listened to their
 radios.

 "unanimous, nationwide ap-
 proval" of the aggression.
 These were strange, dreary
 meetings at which people lis-
 tened        with  sad,  worried
 faces to the official speak-
 ers        reading prefabricated
 texts of   resolutions that
 approved the actions of "our
 wise Communist party and
 Soviet Government."
 such ritual is a famlllari
 integral part of life in theSoviet Union. 'Nevertheless,',
 the seizure of Czechoslovakia'
 was such a brazen act, and
 affection for the people of
 Czechoslovakia so genuine
 and strong in Russia, that
 there had to be some addi-
 tional explanations.
 Thousands of propagandists
 were sent round the country
 to tell people by word of,
 mouth:
 "West Germany was pre-
 paring to invade Czechoslo-
 vakia. If our tanks had not
 gone in, the Germap tanks
 would have been there the
 next day. But we managed to
 get there first and saved
 Czechoslovakia."
 I heard this said dozens
 of times.
 Information from the West
 does not reach the great mass
 of the population in the So-
 viet Union, and Russian sus-.
 picion of the Germans is
 understandable. But the im-.
 portant thing was that this
 false explanation was com
 municated in a sort of confi-
 dential form, whispered in
 your ear, so to speak.
 And the Soviet people are
 accustomed to a state of af-
 fairs in which, if what is said
 openly is usually false, what
 is said in closed meetings can
 sometimes contain a little
 tr.
 Itwas amazed occasionally
 to hear the most honest and
 apparently experienced peo-
 ple say with a shrug and a
 sigh: "It's terrible that we
 had to send our tanks into
 Czechoslovakia. But we had
 to save them from - the Ger-
 mans."
 .  Briefing by Party Aide
 Among the Soviet politi-
 cians                                            who  made  many
 journeys at that time be..
 tween Moscow and Prague
 was the First Secretary of
 the Communist party, the
 "boss,"- of the Tula Region,
 Ivan Yunak. In October, fol-
 lowing one of these trips, he
 held a closed meeting to
 brief propagandists and edi-
 tors on how to speak and
 write about Czechoslovakia.
 I was' present. Yunak had
 just returned from the Krem-
 lin and was in a godd mood.
 His speech added up to this:
 "We have, comrades, dealt
 with Czechoslovakia. Order
 has been restored. It is true
 we have had to leave Dubcek
 there for the time being. But
 he is not, of course, the
 right man. He is not our
 comrade. When passions have
 subsided a little he will be re-
 placed.
 ,You can refer more fre-
 quently to people like Indra
 and Husak. As for Smr-
 kovsky,on no account: he is
 not one of ours, he is a shady
 character.
 "There will, of course, still
 be many difficulties, but it
 is already in the bag. It is
 our country. You Ought ax o-
 ciaily to stress the great dis-
 cipline and humanity shown
 by our troops, Only a single
 accident, which was blown
 up in the West: A woman
 standing near a window was
 killed by mistake.".
 GSring's Awkward Comment
 The writer Boris Polevol
 was at this time about to re-
 issue one of his books that
 was an account of the Nu-
 remberg trial of German war
 criminals. With a sarcastic
 gesture he told me:
 "It's enough to drive you
 madl The censor has demand.
 ed that I make some cuts.
 You would think it was pret-
 ty old stuff. - the book's
 been printed many times. But.
 it appears that I quoted a
 conversation of Goring when'
 they annexed Czechoslovakia
 in 1939. He said something
 like: 'Arrest the Government,
 compromise the others. Form
 another government. Then
 have them issue a program
 and make some 'declaration.
 And keep tanks at all the
 crossroads."'
 I asked him: "Are you go-
 ing to cut that out? After
 all, it is part of history."
 Polevol laughed: "I've al-
 ready cut it. Today that
 would be a trump card in
 the hands of our enemies.
 We mustn't put cards in the
 enemy's hands, so we have
 to cut things out of history.
 And it's right to do it. We
 must make use of such facts
 as suit our purposes and not
 the enemy's."
 Thus in the Soviet Union
 the truth is whatever helps
 the cause of Communism.
 Thinking people in Russia,
 and primarily the intelligent-
 sia, were nevertheless well
 aware of the true situation
 in Czechoslovkia. Yevgcny
 Yevtushenko, the poet, sent
 off a telegram of protest to
 the Soviet Government in a
 moment of rage but then
 went and took it back, or so
 I was told by an official of
 the secret police. Others were
 more consistent.
 And then, suddenly, some-
 thing unheard-of happened.
 People. started to refuse to
 vote at meetings.
 Slogans on the Walls
 Many letters of protest
 were written, bearing the
 signatures  of  well-known
 scholars, writers, professors
 and so forth. Slogans were
 Chalked on the wally in many
 towns and on tht statues in
 Leningrad: "Brezhnev out of
 Czechoslovakial"   "Barbar-
 ians out of Czechoslovakia!"
 It had never happened be-
 Leaflets also began to ap-
 pear in large numbers. And
 finally a demonstration took
 place.,             . . .
 True, it was a very small
 demonstration -- seven peo-
 ple altogether: Larisa Daniel,
 Babitsky, Delone, Pavel Lit-
 vinov, Dremlpuga, Fainberg.
 and Gorbanevskaya. But in
 Russian terms they were act-
 ing in the same way as the
 Ch:'istian martyrs of ancient
 times, deliberately sacrificing
 themselves so as to "demon-
 strate that not all the cit-.
 izens of our country agree
 with the use of force "that is
 being practiced in the name
 of the Soviet people."
 They carried banners say-
 ing "Shame on the invaders"
 and "Hands off Czechoslo-
 vakia!' for a minute or two
 before they were seized.
 They are now in Siberia.
 Leaflets Circulated
 But all Russia- heard about
 them  and  respects  their
 bravery. Tula, where I lived,
 learned  about them from
 leaflets, or rather handwrit-
 ten notes, that were dropped
 into letter boxes. I photo-
 graphed one of them and
 brought it with me: "Friend!
 The Government has violated
 the Constitution by arrest-
 ing participants in a demon-
 stration against the occupa-
 tion of Czechoslovakia on
 Red Square. Long live free-
 dom of speech, of the press
 and of assembly!  Please re-
 produce and circulate."
 The secret police have been
 really shaken by what has
 happened this year. They are.
 demanding permission to re-
 introduce Stalin's methods.
 There aee numerous dismis-
 sals from work, punishments,
 arrests, trials, imprisonments
 and the country is boiling
 with protest.
 Before I left for Britain I
 was given this advice at the
 central office of the Commu-
 nist party in Moscow: "If
 you are asked about Czecho-
 slovakia, don't say anything.
 Don't give . any interviews:
 say you are too busy. If you

 A. ANATOL (AnatoUi Kuznetsov),
 the Soviet writer now in Britain, reveals.
 the hopes and fears of ordinary Russians.
 What is the chance of a popular explosion?
 Do they believe their Press? What do they
 realty think of Communism? Are they afraid
 of China? Interview by DAVID Ell 0Xn

 are all ' hawks'."
 With these words Ana-
 toli Kuznet4ov, the Russian
 writer who a few weeks ago
 evaded his siicret police guard
 and chose freedom in Britain,
 summed up his view of, the
 present leaders of Russia.
 Kuznetsov does not shard the
 view common among Western
 observers of the soviet scene
 that the men in the Kremlin are
 divided   into  "hawks"  and
 "doves", into those who want
 to he tougher towards the rest
 of the world and those %,be
 want to be more friendly. As
 far as this intelligent and sen-
 sitive Russian can see, they are
 all " hawks ".
 Slat,  then,  was  going to
 never happen in anystcha change Would
 for there the
 better, towards greater internal,
 reedom and democracy? : Kuz-
 netsov is not optimistic:
 "An explosion-that is to say,
 nation-wide revolt capable of
 verthrowing the present Soviet:
 egime---is  impossible.   The'
 machinery of oppression is tool
 owerful for that. ? Nor can I
 ec much hope for the gradual,
 democratisation' Of the regime,;
 ecause   there   is   no  real"
 litical life at all in the Sovictl
 nion in the Western sense of-
 e term. But there is the very
 al possibility of a new reign of
 rror, such as we knew under,
 talin and such as the Russian;
 eople  have known  so  many
 mes in their history.
 "Many people still hope that,
 cre may emerge an intelligent
 vilised,  humane  leader, and
 hen, they think, all would be
 ell.  But among the present
 .aders  there  are  none --whoi
 joy any popularity with the
 ople as a whole. Nevertheless:
 ogle go on hoping.
 "I would be inclined to `say,
 vvever, that Russia is more
 ady for a new Stalin and a new
 ria   Stalin's  secret  police
 ief]_ than for an intelligent
 and  humane leader.  In  the                                 course of-. history Russia has.                                 been through many more bad than good and she is                                 ready for anything. That is, of                                 course, a pessimistic view.:  I be very happy if I were                                 proved wrong."
 Passengers to cln'                                 The population of the SovietUnion, says Kuznetsov, play nopart at all in the making of policy.  Policy is magicby                                 a  very  small  number  ofpeople in Moscow, and the rest the population get to know their decisions only after.                                 the event. The whole population                                 is interested in politics but only                                 in. the sense of wondering whaton earth the very small group                                        leaders will think up and do                                 next.                                 " The attitude of the population                                 of the Soviet Union to the policy-                                 makers in the Kremlin is like of passengers on a shipwhose destination they do not

But did the ordinary people in                                 Russia not have some say in'                                 local politics?

 inform him, about the few brave                                 spirits who had dared to protest                                 against Official Soviet policypeople like General Grigorenko                                 Pavel Litvinov, Larissa Daniel
 and others?
 The further you go from
 Moscow the less is known about
 such protests,             , and I have not
 heard of any signs
 of open
 support for them in other cities
 and towns.            . But there have been
 other  forms
 of  protest  in
 provincial towns.

 Novoc
 herkassk. There were simi-
 Jar incidents in Tula, but on a
 smaller scale.              . But on the whole
 the position'         tion in Russia is just the
 same
 as it was described so
 vividly
 a hundred years ago by
 the great
 Ukrainian poet Taras
 S
 hevchenke: `All is silent , in all
 languages.
 ...:

 called
 'deputies,' the Supreme
 Soviet,
 local "Soviets, which in

 in favour of everything that is

 What then,do the       of
 people
 Russia believe in? What-are they
 striving     towards?   Do they
 believe in
 "I a         Communism?

 of the people in Russia no longer
 believe in any
 kind of ..Com-

 there

 is a
 firmlyestablished imperialist
 state of
 a special kind unknown
 in history.          . Communism is taken
 seriously by practically
 no one;
 it only provokes ironic and sad
 smiles

 "All the same, the majority of
 people in the Soviet Union; con-
 tinue to use the term, simply
 because they have got nothing
 else.  They  argue  like  this:
 ` What is there left for us to do?
 -to turn back again to capital-

 be no good. And what can we
 do that is new? Maybe we shall
 find something. But I must say
 that our efforts to rind 'some.

 maybe an intelligent and decent

 E  1 1. His best-known work in the West is the novel "Baba Yar", an account of the
 'Nazi massacres in the Ukraine in 1942.
 Kuznetsov's story is made of the stuff of classic spy fiction. But it is brutally
 true. It involves the Soviet secret police, the KGB, a shabby hotel in the West End
 of London, the Apollo, a favorite place for the Soviet Embassy to put up visiting
 delegations, and sex, too, among the seedy strip clubs of Soho. It is a story of escape
 and betrayal. Like many good thrillers, a newspaper man is involved -- the London
 Daily Telegraph's Soviet Affairs Editor, David Floyd, the man in the middle.
 Someone had'given Kuznetsov Floyd's name. Kuznetsov now lives in hiding.
 He prefers to be called by his first name, Anatoly. Kuznetsov, he says, was the man
 who wrote what he was told to write, and he wants to forget him. But he emerged from
 hiding to tell his remarkable, sometimes sickening story of life in the Soviet Union. _

 SAFER: But there have been many things in the past twenty years and more1equally

 After that I really didn't have any faith loft, or any hope.
 SAFER: All right, there you are, a Soviet citizen who decides to leave Russia.
 What do you do?
 INTERPRETER: Of course, it's very difficult to leave the Soviet Union. Very few
 people travel outside the Soviet Union.
 First of all, if there IS a dossier on you with the police, then you won't
 get out anyway. You've got to have a very good reputation at work.
 You've got to, make frequent- statements about your political loyalty, your love
 for the party and the government. You must be psychologically and nervously in good
 form, fit. If you've consulted a doctor, and especially if you've consulted a psychiatrist,
 you would never be let out. And then for five or six months you fill in a mass of different forms.
 You particularly have to put down what people near to you, close to you, you leave
 behind in Russia. A~bachelor has very little hope of getting out. A man with a family has
 better chances. Then he has children left behind and people related to him.

 Sometimes they will tell you to follow the activities of the people who go with
 you because they very seldom let.you out alone. You have'to'go out in a group. In my
 case, they attached a special personal agent to me. ?
 I had no permission to leave.
 I once made a journey in 1961 to France.
 Since then, fore ight years, theywouldn't?let me out.
 Foreign publishing houses invited me out.
 I was invited to Paris by a French publishing firm at their expense, with their
 "money. And it looked as though they were going to let me out. Then the secret
 police got in the way, and I wasn't released.
 Then I was invited to New York by the Dial Press publishers.
 They wrote a-long letter. They promised to put up five thousand dollars. And then
 once again, at the very last moment, they wouldn't let me out.
 So then I decided to get out at any price. I got ready to try and swim out
 underwater because it's very difficult, this tremendous guard on the frontier everywhere.
 I took a lot of chances, and I was very scared.
 I trained myself to do this. I trained myself to swim. underwater.
 I can now, for example, swim for fifteen hours underwater. Because what I had
 to do was to swim under the water and do it in one night and only if it were bad weather.
 I just got a letter from another Russian who actually did manage to do it by swimming.
 He got out to `Turkey in the end.
 There he met up with a Soviet frontier guard who had also got out to Turkey. And
 the frontier guard explained to him it was only a miracle that he had got out at all.
 Lots of people tried, but they all get caught.
 The Russian authorities don't only have radar equipment on the surface. Which is
 good enough even to detect a child's ball floating on the surface. But they also have
 hydro-radar locators, underneath the water. And they would have caught me. They would
 have detected me.
 SAFER: So you decided against swimming out, and you made one more attempt
 to come out hga I ly?
 INTERPRETER: I made my last, my third effort to get out legally so that !would -

 A lot of these people told me what was happening and warned me about it.
 My telephone was bugged, my letters were opened. I think there were
 microphones in my rooms. They knew absolutely everything about me. I had two copies
 of the magazine "America".
 Suddenly some completely unknown person rang me up and said, "Why on earth do
 you keep those foreign magazines in your home? It's already written down in your dossier."
 So then, in desperation, I decided to show them that I had changed my ways, that
 I would improve -- behave differently.
 What you have to do, I said to myself, is to just pretend to yourself, believe that
 this is the Gestapo. I must escape from the concentration camp. What do the want in

 And I would just have to go,and visit all the places where he'd been in London.
 SAFER: You created a kind of phony project in a way?
 INTERPRETER: Well, I made it -- it was a very detailed plan, too. So then,
 they started to work with me and said that they'd let me go to England and that maybe
 they would give me some secret task to perform secret mission, that just before I left
 from -- left Russia -- I should telephone and I would probably get my secret instructions.
 But, you know, I took a chance and I didn't bother to ring up.
 SAFER: Anatoly, do you feel any guilt about what you wrote and reported
 about Yevtushenko and the others?
 INTERPRETER: Of course, I do. It's by no means excluded that they may have
 hod difficulties. I wrote about it immediately as soon a I was here in the Daily
 Telegraph. So that the KGB over there should know what I'd done. But it was
 a false project. Yes, of course. But this is such an ordinary, everyday thing with them
 that this isn't going to surprise anybody.
 SAFER:  Yet, you know that Yevtushenko was once greatly admired in the West
 and many of his poems were against the Soviet system. So, perhaps, there were some grains
 of truth in what you reported to the KGB.
 INTERPRETER:  No, of course not, he has no plans to start an under-
 ground print shop.
 SAFER: So there you. are on a plane with your shadow and you arrive in London.
 Then what do you do?
 INTERPRETER: Well, you find a room in a hotel, which was booked for us either
 by the Soviet Embassy or people who were very close to the Embassy. I don't have the
 ,right to choose a hotel myself.
 SAFER: Then you have a plan?
 INTERPRETER: We always, when 'we.come on these trips, have several
 sheets of paper containing the program of. what we are to do and .a copy of this remains
 behind in Russia.

 wrote himself in as a Yugoslav citizen.
 In Russia we are strictly forbidden to visit anything like strip-tease or get mixed
 up with women. We have to sign a paper' saying that We shan't do this.
 In this way, both of us, both I and my watchdog became criminals. So this introduced

 There are, of course, some people who do say what they think. But these are just
 people who are not very bright people who are just using set phrases of official propaganda.
 But a thinking man finds it very hard there. And it's a terrible system of universal
 informing, universal following. You cannot trust a single person there. It's quite,
 possible for a son to inform on his fathers Or a wife on her husband. Not to mention what

 really ever trust each other?
 INTERPRETER: A hundred percent, you can't trust anybody. You have to carry on
 your conversations like this. Now, you say, this is Very bad and this is bad and this is
 bad but these were all. mistakes. But altogether, we are .Communists. We just think that
 there are little small mistakes committed in Russia.
 SAFER: Anotolyr I've read everything you've written and one word keeps coming
 .up in almost every article. The word cynicism." Could you expand on that?
 INTERPRETER: I am at this momenta very fortunate person. I am for the
 first time in my life saying what I really think.  Many, many people in Russia think
 exactly the Sarno as I do. I'm rosponsiblo for my words. I know what I'm saying, Insofar
 .as we have to live in that theatre, every single person has a sort of collection of phrases
 which he speaks and says officially, publicly, and a corresponding collection of
 actions.
 Insofar as to a normal human being it's extremely difficult to lead such a double
 life.
 SAFER:  What are the rewards for that cynicism?
 INTERPRETER: Well, of course, hd?gets the possibility of living more richly than
 others, be better off than others. He can buy commodities, special things, special
 shops. He will be, allowed to travel, travel abroad. He may.receive decorations, official
 state medals, state prizes.
 SAFER: Do any of your colleagues place any real value on these awards?
 INTERPRETER: No.. Can the whole, we'repretty cool towards the sort of rewards
 you get.
 My novel "Bobo Yar" was put forward for a`state prize'.
 They used to be called
 Stalin Prizes. But when this was reported in the newspapers, a lot of very decent people
 began to change their attitude toward me for the worse.
 Fortunately for me, I didn't get the prize.
 SAFER: The Soviet authorities were very unhappy with your novel, "Baba Yar".
 Now I know that book, and it's a simple account of how the Nazis slaughtered hundreds
 of thousands of Jews and Ukranians in the Ukraine. What on earth did they object to in
 that?

 But in the first place, there is a great deal of anti-Semitism, in the Soviet Union.
 And "Baba Yar" is primarily concerned with the murder of Jews,..,
 The Soviet officials prefer not to talk about this.
 Then, my novel went rather further than this. It begins with talking about the
 beginning of the war and inquiring why there was such a terrible defeat at this time."
 The.truth of the matter Is that a great many Soviet citizens and'espcially
 t Ukranians waited for Hitler as a liberator.
 Then it turned out that the Germans were offering them the some kind of'terrorist
 regime as Stalin. So the people found themselves between two fires, between the
 hammer and the anvil. The ordinary citizen preferred his own, Russian form of terror.
 And the third objection on the part of the censor was purely literary quality.
 {My literary method.
 They considered that they knew better than I 'how I should write.
 Consequently, they did such an enormous number *of cuts and changes that the novel
 in, fact was turned upside down. And all my novels have been treated in the same way?.
 So I'm always faced with the dilemma of printing at least something or publishing
 nothing at all.
 But in the end it became so. objectionable to me :what they were going to print that
 I simply reject the whole of 'it.
 SAFER: Now, in coming out you didn't really come out'alone.You came out w th
 everything you'd ever written. How did you achieve this?
 INTERPRETER: I'm a bit of an amateur photographer. And I took pictures of all
 my manuscripts. I put them onto film. I'll show you some of them. I've got them here.
 That's roughly -- that's the sort of thing. Just ordinary film.
 I managed to get 'six sheets --.typing sheets onto each exposure.. You see, if- I
 brought it all out as-actual manuscript,- well, it would make something like five or six.
 cases, five or six -- so I squeezed it and wound it up really tight and it didn't take up much
 more room than a cizarette pack.
 But I hid it inside my jacket. And that really were the whole.of my possessions,
 the whole of my property with which I came out of Russia. And that there.is the whole
 .of my life. These are my real books, not the ones as they.areknown to the reader.

 Mother Lives In Kiev
 Mr. Kuznctsov, who was born.
 In Kiev -on Aug. 18, 1929, was;
 12 years old when the Nazis
 came. His mother once was a
 grade-school teacher. She still lives in Kiev, in the
 same cottage his grandfather
 built In swampy Kurenevka. It
 Is not far from Babi Yar, the
 ravine where the Nazis slaugh-,
 tered tens of thousands of Jews
 as' well as lesser numbers of
 Ukrainians, gypsies and others,,
 His grandfather, Fyodor, born
 in. 1870, the same. year, as
 .Lenin, and ? ,to. his dying days
 a rabid foe of the Commu-
 nistg, has long since died. So
 has his grandmother, Marfa, a
 woman who died illiterate but
 whom the ,grandson adored as
 a saint. A 'devout believer in
 the' Russian- Orthodox faith,
 the grandmother secretly' took
 her grandson to church and had
 :him christened,
 "I remember my grandmother
 with' great respect,' he said.
 "She taught me humanity."
 II`ather a Communist
 His father, Vasily, was an
 engineer and a party member.,
 The boy Anatoly grew up in
 Kiev and lived by his wits as
 a street urchin under the Nazi
 occupation.
 While he, now repudiates his
 novel, Babi Yar, which'related
 the horror of the extermin?tion
 of the. Kiev Jews, he affirms
 that it is a documentary work.
 He maintains that every fact
 in it is a true fact; that every
 experience is a real one; that
 many Kiev' residents, his grand-
 father included, awaited the
 the Germans with intense an
 ticipation and welcomed their
 arrival. .
 . Mr. Kuznetsov attended sec-
 ondary schools in Kiev. In 1952
 he was sent, with many of his
 comrades to help build con-
 struction projects of the Stalin
 era.. He worked on. the hydro-
 electric and irrigation project
 at Kakhovka in-the Ukraine for:
 two years. Then he went to Mo
 cow and began his literary
 :studies at the Gorky Institute,,
 finishing in 1960.,           1
 Was Married in 1960
 That year he married irina
 Marchenko and they went. to
 live in the city of Tula, about
 100 miles south of Moscow,
 once famous 'for its manufac-
 ture of samovars and cannon,
 now an industrial center of
 400,000 population. -
 He had hoped to stay in
 Moscow, but that Is no easy

 there, or to be born there, or

 Soviet writers ire faciiw a nainf~l
 The strains of communist life  Russia
 CF ft b OLD LA13EDZ
 Mr. Ana  y Kuznetsov's
 decision to stay in Britain can'
 be best understood against the
 background of `Soviet literary
 history, particularly In its pre-
 sent phase.
 It is now a decade and a half
 since Ehrenburgs Thaw gave Its
 name to the hope4 of Soviet
 writers,   and ' Poenerantsev's
 article "On Sincerity in Litera-
 ture" indicated their basic pre-
 occupation.  Since then, there
 have been many ups and downs,'
 periods    when  writers  were
 allowed a greater degree of lati-I
 tude alternating with times of,
 stricter party control of litera-!
 lure.
 However, these 15 years ofd
 cyclical ebb and flow have also
 witnessed the progress of dis-
 ;'enchantment among the literary
 intelligentsia, whose hopes were
 dashed as they became increas-I
 )ngly and acutely aware that they;
 were still facing only two pros-'
 peels: either to be the obedient,
 servants of the regime (with a
 somewhat greater degree of per
 tonal  security  than ' Stalin's
 " engineers of human souls '),'
 or to be its victims if they showed
 themselves too deeply concerned,
 with Pomcrantscv"s  first pre
 requisite of the literary vocation.
 It is a cruel dilemma. During
 the past five years of "-collect;
 `.trvc leadership " in the Kremlin,,
 .continuous efforts have been
 (made to bring the writers to heel..
 Their position was made more,
 `difficult by the tightening of cen-
 sorship, a more intolerant pub-
 lishing  policy,  restriction ? of
 foreign contracts, the persecub
 .tion ..of nonconformist writers
 like Sinyav6ky or Solzhenitsyn,
 ,and, not least important, a series
 ';of trials pour ddcourager les
 ourres.
 It should not be surprising
 that the earlier cautiously hope-
 ful mood of the more liberal
 Soviet writers bas given way to
 melancholy or even to outright
 despair.
 The idol of Soviet youth, the
 `' poet-cbansormier Bulat Okud..
 z ava, who recently said in con-
 versation with an Italian jour-
 nalist that Soviet literary society
 was made up of masks, and
 complained bitterly that he was
 "tired of living",, reflects this
 more . general  mood,  which
 reached its nadir last year after
 the invasion of Czechoslovakia.;
 Like other ' occasions of this'
 kind, it  has affected Soviet'
 writers profoundly. The decision
 to invade spelt the end not only
 of Czechoslovak hopes for a
 "" socialism with a human face"
 in their country, but also of
 hopes for some ' liberalization"
 in the Soviet Union itself.
 Soviet writers were-, torn be-
 tween their   ipatriotic " and
 their " liberal" loyalties. Many
 of them realized the gap which
 existed between the attitudes to-
 wards Czechoslovakia prevalent
 among the more enlightened
 milieux of the intelligentsia, and
 those among the population in
 general. The hostility shown by
 the crowd to the courageous
 lonely demonstrators in  Red
 Square led by Larissa Daniel, wasr
 not without wider significance.
 But if "' patriotic " fervour (or
 blackmail) inhibited some and
 brought home to others their iso-
 lation, it did not completely stop
 literary manifestations, however
 discreet, of disapproval of the in
 vasion.
 It took two months of intense

 duce an " open letter " (which

 But the signatures of three

 Deprived of any outlet, even
 for expression in an Aesopian
 form, liberal protests are increas-
 ingly taking an unofficial form,
 either .as "underground" litera-
 turc, or as writings and docu-
 ments published abroad.
 As other avenues of expression
 have gradually been blocked,
 there has been a remarkable in,
 crease in  the circulation of
 Samizdat, the literature being
 copied by hand and passed on
 from hand to hand.  Some of
 these writings find their way
 abroad; but what has been pub-
 lished outside the Soviet Union
 is only a part of tho.innumerable
 stories, essays, poems. and letters
 of protest circulating inside the
 country.
 There is now a regular periodi-
 cal,  distributed , clahdestincly,
 which trips -to 'keep track of the
 underground  publications and
 unofficial materials, as well as of
 events not reported in the official
 Soviet press. It is'called Chron-'
 icle of Current Events; the first
 issue appeared on April 30, 19,68,
 and its most recent, no. 7, on
 April 30, 1969.
 The Chronicle provides infor-
 mation about matters which of-
 ten do not reach either the Soviet
 or the western press.  For in-
 stance, the issue of December 31.
 1968, (no. 5), gives a review of
 Samizdat for 1968 which reveals
 the extent to which the intensi-
 fied campaign to bring dissident
 intellectuals to. heel, and the
 harsh reprisals taken by the au-
 thorities, are being countered by.
 their  boldest  representatives.
 They continue their literary acti-

 to be paid may include the loss

 Approvea  or a ease
 syn,  the slow crushing of the
 meteroric poet, Vozncssensky.
 Yet now, by his own choice, he
 embarks on the life of a rootless.
 emigre in a foreign land whose.
 way, are alien, perhaps in some
 particulars repellent, and whose
 language he cannot speak. For all
 practical purposes. he finds himself,
 a visitor to another planet. He is
 cut oft from everything he has ever:
 written about or ever felt about. He`
 has to speak and read through ate
 interpreter; he has to :write. through
 a translator: and he knows nothing
 of the people for whom he must!
 now write.  It 'was  a terrible
 decision.
 Since he felt compelled to make!
 it, evidently the reality of his situa-'
 lion was very difTerent from the
 picture presented to the outsider
 looking in on his career only a few.
 days ago.  And indeed this is so.
 No matter what he may himself tell
 us of the reasons for his great dcci-.
 Sion, anybody with any understand-
 ing of the current, situation of the
 Soviet  intellectuals  and  artists
 knows that the picture was false in
 detail and in general.
 Kuznetzov was published and
 admired---but everything he pub.
 lished had first to be carefully.
 censored by himself, then mauled
 by the official censor before it
 appeared. Almost without a doubt
 it was only a part of his output that,
 he published. He will have written
 other books for his own satisfaction
 and to circulate by hand among his
 friends and admirers-a rractice
 institutionalised almost into  an
 industry under the name Saiurzclat,
 self-publishing.  And all the time
 he would be under heavy, nagging;
 sometimes threatening pressure to
 write the sort of books and articles
 he (lid not wish to write, books and
 articles designed to present the
 official image of the Soviet Union
 which has no correspondence with
 any sort of truth. Even when not
 writing, he would he required, day
 in, day out, to connive in a sort of
 officially inspired conspiracy of lies
 -lies designed for no other pur
 pose  than  to  sustain  in  their;
 positions of authority the ruling
 gang and their innumerable do-;
 pendants and supporters, the party.
 functionaries, the apparatus men.
 There are only two ways to avoid
 entanglement in this conspiracy : to
 be silent and thus abandon any
 hope of building a career, even of
 making a living except a menial
 one; or to protest openly, at the
 risk of probable imprisonment and
 certain exile to some remote region.
 Others beside Kuznetsov must
 from  time  to time  have been
 ,tempted to cut themselves off from
 Russia. but until lately they could
 still hope for better things. It has
 been only during the past three or
 four years that the pressures on the
 independent mind have -gathered
 crushing weight. it was only with
 the invasion. of Czechoslovakia a
 year ago that it became finally clear
 to those who hoped that the new
 repression brought about by fear.
 and,"uncertainty in a mediocre and
 divided leadership might be a pass-
 ing phase was, in fact, irreversible
 for as long ahead as could be seen.
 Czechoslovakia was the closing
 of a door to all ideas of 'socialism'
 with a human face,' in the Soviet,
 Union as well as in Prague. The
 experience was traumatic for many
 socialist intellectuals. It meant the
 end of a dream that had been sus-
 ,tanned  with  greater  or  lesser
 optimism for the 15 years since
 Stalin's death.
 Under the collective government
 presided over by Malenkov, then
 tinder Khrushchev, exciting things
 had, happened.  Some who had
 been silent for years found their
 yokes; many who had compro-
 mised at last spoke out truly and
 .firmly about the shamefulness of
 their compromise; young men and
 women, poets above all, sprang up
 in  numbers,  reproaching  their
 elders for their pusillanimity and
 declaring, in effect, that the only
 thing to fear was fear itself. Stalin-
 ist hacks with a vested interest in
 the repression of their more gifted
 colleagues withdrew into them-
 selves and sulked. There were still
 plenty of them about, typified by
 the scurrilous and almost unread-
 able novelist, Kochetov; by Cha-
 kovsky, who was to come much
 later to England and explain on
 BBC Television how necessary and
 desirable it had been to. confine
 those well-known traitors, Sinyav-
 sky and Daniel, to the camps.
 . At first they kept quiet.  Hope
 rose *, very strongly. . The Soviet
 Union was waking up. Khrushchev
 himself needed the writers, the
 whole of the intelligentsia, in his
 own fight for power and in his
 desperate efforts to break the coun-
 try out of the Stalinist paralysis,
 and harness its best minds to the
 job .of making a success of the
 economy. The writers in particular
 he needed for the support they
 could give him in his de-Stalinisa-
 lion campaign, which was also a
 campaign against those colleagues
 who wanted to pull him down.  It
 was for this reason that he person-
 ally encouraged Solzhenitsyn and
 allowed him to publish his first
 short novel; 'One Day in the Life
 of Ivan Denisovich; an exposure
 of the penal labour camps, pre-
 sented by Khrushchev as Stalin's
 camps-and Molotov's and Maien-
 kov's and Kaganovich's.
 But Khrushchev, who had the
 sense to see that unless the Soviet
 Union saes to stagnate until it be-
 came a backwater of history he
 must allow the mind to expand and
 drag the best thinkers, the best
 dreamers out of hiding, never had
 any intention of giving them a,
 totally free rein. He aimed at a sort
 of Stalinism without terror.  And
 except for one or two direct and,
 crudely threatening interventions,'
 which usually occurred when, he
 himself was under extreme pressure
 from the opposition in the Kremlin,
 he tried to achieve a sort of balance
 by allowing the liberalisers a little
 rope, then, when they threatened to .
 take too much, encouraging the
 Kochetovs to fight back.
 So it went on, two steps forward,
 one and a half steps back, for 10
 years. Things were happening all
 the time.  Things were said and
 done, books were published, which
 would have been unthinkable under
 Stalin; and although from time to
 time the party came down heavily,
 there was no real fear. Above all,
 the intelligentsia was sorting out its
 ideas, discussing freely. preaching
 decency,  and  responding  in  a
 greater or lesser degree to the im
 perious demands of the very young
 for something more than decency.
 I remember during this time being
 worried by the complete openness
 with which the young would speak,
 even  to  total  strangers  and
 foreigners at that. Again and again
 1 would ask: ' Is it really wise for
 you to talk like this? Shouldn't you
 be more careful?' And always, by
 these youngsters who had never
 known life under Stalin except as
 schoolchildren, I would be regard.-d.

 But we know where we're going.

 I am speaking of young men and,

 teens' and their early twenties in,
 say, 1955. Some of their contem-
 poraries are . now in prison or in

 been 25 in that year. Perhaps:he
 felt like that, too., The mood-
 per-listed at least until 1.963, when
 Khr.ushchev, fighting for his own
 political life. clamped down.
 After 1964, when Khrushchev
 fell, things went dead.  Nobody
 knew what the new Government
 would do. The new Government did
 not know itself.  For nearly .#wo
 years they fought and manoeuvred
 among themselves, tried to sort out
 the muddles' in the economy, and
 marked time. There were no policy
 initiatives of any kind. But in this
 period of uncertainty the security
 police, the KGB, were assuming a
 new authority. And in February
 1966 they made a demonstration
 with the mock trial of Sinyavsky
 and Daniel, who had been arrested
 some time earlier for publishing
 books, impossible to publish  in
 Russia. under assumed names in
 the West.  We know what hap-
 pened.  They were savagely sen-
 tenced, and the transcript of the
 trial. which was smuggled to the
 West, and published as 'On Trial'
 in 1967, showed the world the new

 sincerity in literature; Tvardovsky,
 who held open the pages of the
 review Novy Mir for the 'best of
 the young writers (at this moment
 he is under great pressure to
 resign);  Ilya  Ehrenburg, many
 more besides, argued the necessity
 for freedom of expression if litera-
 ture was to live, and the Soviet
 Union to mature, almost as though
 it were 'a new idea to be carefully
 and lovingly explained, nurtured,
 cherished.
 The young men and women of
 the protest movement in the sixties
 argued differently.  Ginsburg and
 Galanskov, who protested against
 the  Sinyavsky-Daniel trial  and
 were themselves arrested and con-
 demned for their pains; Kaustov
 and  Bukovsky,  who    protested
 against this action, only to be
 arrested in their turn; the young
 Litvinov and Daniel's wife Larissa,
 who protested against everything
 that had gone before and were
 finally arrested and sent into exile
 for demonstrating against the inva-
 sion of Czechoslovakia; a group of
 young people in Leningrad who
 were  sentenced for, distributing
 books  published  abroad;   the
 Ukrainian  journalist Chornovil,
 who lucidly protested against the
 trial and sentencing of Ukrainian
 patriots-all these and many more
 who have suffered in the last three
 years did not bother to argue about-
 the desirability of freedom of ex-
 pression.
 They took this for granted. They
 did not bother to argue about the
 crassness and imbecility of the
 party bureaucracy; they took that
 for granted..One and all they based
 their stand on the written Consti.
 tution of the Soviet Union, Stalin's
 hollow mockery of a Constitution
 with which he successfully con-.
 fused the world in 1938.
 This was a new approach.  It
 did not get them very far. They
 were permitted to discuss and
 argue and agitate among them-
 selves. but as soon as any of them
 got together to appeal to the public
 at large the police closed in.
 And the public at large did not
 help. Materially, things are better
 than they used to be; further,
 people no longer get taken away
 in the middle of the night and shot
 or sent to rot in the camps for
 grumbling among themselves or
 making subversive jokes.  They
 are safe provided they do not kick
 demonstrably over the traces. They
 have suffered much in their life-
 times, and they are content to he
 alive, with-enough to eat and some
 consumer goods to queue for in the,
 shops.  They want only a quiet
 life.  in their comfortable philis.
 tinism they have no' sympathy for,
 these hotheads and silly idealists
 with their vapourings about free-
 dom and sincerity and self-expres-
 sion.                                                                                Live and let live and the
 devil take the hindmost is the
 unheroic mood.
 The dissident intellectuals soon
 found that they were very much'
 alone.  Most of their university
 contemporaries  were  intent  on
 making some sort of a career,
 which meant keeping their heads
 down and doing what they were
 'told.  The highly paid scientists.
 engineers and all the rest might,
 and did, and do. criticise aspects
 of the regime with extreme bitter-
 ness and sympathise warmly with
 the young protesters; they might
 hope that one day there would
 be enough of them in positions of
 influence to shift the balance of
 power in the Kremlin.  But they
 knew that they could do nothing
 now when it came to the crunch.
 How lonely the protesters were,
 their sympathisers, too, was borne
 in on them with intolerable impact
 by the crushing of the Czecho-
 slovak movement towards the light.
 Many were appalled. Many refused
 to sign the obligatory letters declar-
 ing solidarity with the party and
 the Government in this action. But
 to the mass of the Soviet people in
 the cities (the peasants have barely
 heard of Czechoslovakia) it seemed
 that the Czechs deserved what they
 got. They were a nuisance, irritat-
 ing foreigners to be put in their
 place.  And they showed what
 they felt when Litvinov,and Larissa
 Daniel and a handful of others
 demonstrated in Red Square : the
 demonstrators were set upon and

 even before the police could got to

 P. '. e 'ongress May Discuss Censorship:, of Soviet Writers
 By HENRY RAYMONI'
 The Soviet-Government's re-
 pression and censorship of lib-.
 eral authors, described In the
 recent series of articles by?
 Anatoly Kuznetsov, is likely to
 emerge as a key subject of the;
 International P.E.N. Congress;
 to be held next month in Mon-[
 ton, Prance.
 Arthur Miller, the Pulitzer,
 Prize-winning playwright who;
 is international president of
 P.E.N. -- an organization of;
 poets,  playwrights,  essayists!
 and novelists--said In an inter-i
 ;,view yesterday that he would:
 press for an extensive debate!
 .of the conditions that led tol
 .Mr. Kuznetsov's defection to;
 the West.
 The 39-year-old Soviet au?
 thor, who received asylum in
 Britain on July 30, denounced
 the Soviet authorities for hav
 {=ing forced him and other lib
 erals to adapt their manuscripts
 to Communist party guidelines
 and to spy on one another for
 the K.G.B., the state security
 services.
 Mr. Miller said he would sub-
 mit the issue to some 700
 authors from more than 50
 Countries,  including  several
 from Eastern Europe, who are
 expected to attend the congress.
 Some Opposition Expected
 "I think that Kuznetsov's
 articles provide an urgent rea-,
 son to examine freedom of ex-
 pression all around: the,-world,
 not only in the Soviet Union,".
 he declared.
 Though there might be offi-
 cial opposition from some East-
 ern European delegations, Mr.
 Miller anticipated overwhelm-
 ing support from the AE.Nr
 membership for a broad discus-
 sion of the Kuznetsov case.
 Mr. Miller has just completed
 a book on his meetings with
 the intelligentsia during a, trip
 to the Soviet Union last year
 in which he -recounts some of
 the fears generated by Govern-
 ment surveillance. The book,.
 "In Russia," will be published.;
 by Viking Press In the fall, It
 will contain 100 photographs'

 taken by Inge Morath, Mr.
 Miller's wife.
 William Styron, another au-,
 thor who visited the Soviet`
 Union  last. year, reluctantly;
 acknowledged  yesterday,  to
 "rather mixed feelings" about,
 Mr. Kuznetsov's denunciationl
 of the plight of Soviet writers
 for fear of the consequences it
 may have for the liberal dis-+
 senters who remained behind.!
 "I agree ? 100 per cent with)
 what he had to say," Mr. Sty-
 ron said from his summer home
 in  Martha's Vineyard. "Cer-
 tainly the Soviet Union Is the
 last place on earth where a
 writer can live With any sense
 of, freedom or indpendence.
 "Yet I cannot help wonder-
 Ing what effect his actions will
 have on the other writers who
 are still there. Perhaps betrayal
 is too strong a word, brit the
 whole thing. has an overtone of
 selling out when his fellow suf-
 ferers are likely to face increas-
 tng repression as a result of  i
 own liberation."
 'Desperate to Get Out'
 Mr. Styron, who won a Pulit-
 zer Prize last year for his novel
 "The Confessions of Nat Tur-
 ner," said that during his three-
 week  trip  to  Moscow  and
 Tashkent he had found the op-
 pression of liberal writers so
 intolerable that "I became des-
 perate to get out again." .
 But he said he had decided
 not to write about his experi.
 ences because he believed the
 Soviet Government would level
 reprisals against any author he
 had associated with during the
 Visit.
 "In evaluating, Kuznetsov,"
 he said yesterday, "it is impor-
 Itant to keep in mind that such
 courageous writers as Alek-
 sanr  Solzhenitsyn,  Yevgenia
 Ginsburg, Andrei Sinyavsky and
 Yuli Daniel, .are dc(ving censor-
 ship and rcpressilon in their own
 way and even. willing to suffer
 imprisonment for 'their convic-
 tions."

 to live in the West in April, 1963, has disclosed that he does not feel safe`
 in returning to Russia.
 Mr Ashkenazy, one of. the world's foremost pianists, broke a six-year silence about'
 his personal status in an exclusive interview with the 11 Guardian" Ile contradicted as
 Vladimir As?hkenazy, the Soviet pianist who was granted permission.
 travesty of the truth!' a, Russian claim that he can move"
 freely in and out of the Soviet Union, He and his wife,
 e said,, were kept in Moscow against their will for some
 weeks " in a state of acute anxiety and distress " during
 their first-and last-return visit in May, 1963.
 said that he and his wife subse?,    at the Moscow Conservatoire
 quently realised they had fallen,    that he was forced to play in
 into " what you could call a kind    the 1962 Tschaikovsky inter
 of trap ", by accepting the visas.   national competition, which he
 They  were  subjected  to  a.'       won ;
 This was less than two
 months after he decided to
 remain in London while__
 on a concert visit.   At a
 holiday bungalow in Palea
 Epidaurus, Greece, he said he
 believed he was probably
 ,only able to return to London
 from Russia because of the
 personal intervention of Mr
 Khrushchev,  then  Prima
 Minister.
 Since  then he  had been
 "completely unable to trust "?
 the authorities to let him leave,
 ,Russia if he went there again.
 Air   Ashken'azy, now 32,,
 repudiated "carefully - fostered
 ilction " that -he spends half of
 each  year  In  Russia,  but he
 ,stressed that he only decided to
 take this step after the Soviet
 claim  was  reported     in the'
 ' Guardian " on August 1. " When
 .an official Soviet spokesman says
 I move freely between' Russia
 and the West, as I only wish I
 could, it is a gross and unfair
 distortion of the truth."
 In a fetter to the." Guardian
 sent soon after the Soviet claim,,
 he sai(I  that he and his wife's
 guaranteed exit visas were not
 honoured in ltloscow. They had
 lived under the "very real fear'
 ,that we wnald never be permitted
 to leave ae;aln. Despite the fact;
 that our child.(Vovka, then two,
 years old) was in London at the
 time."
 Invited to clarify this during:
 the Interview at Epidaurus ho
 bureaucratic  cat  and mouser
 game as soon as they reached,
 ;Moscow. ire was told by the then
 head of cultural relations at the=
 Ministry of Culture, Mr Stepanov
 " You are a Soviet citizen. You
 may not go." Ile was reminded.
 by implication that the visas were
 "bits of paper."
 Ile "lost all hope " of leavinyg,
 and,  deeply  depressed,  played
 unscheduled   recitals  td order.
 But he was braced to persist'in
 his appeals to the Ministry of.
 Culture by his wife Dody "who
 gave me an incredible example:
 of how you can behave under
 stress."
 Finally the Minister of Culture.
 Airs Furtseva, let them go--by'
 the " kindness " of AIr Khrushchev
 as a senior unnamed source later
 told him.
 Talking during the interview
 of his earlier life as a pianist
 in Russia and of what led to
 his  decision  to  leave,  Mr
 Ashkenazy said :
 he was " tried" at the Ministry
 of Culture after his first
 American tour in 1958, accused'
 by his tour escort "who was
 probably briefed by the KGB "
 of  expressing  a  liking  for
 modern painting and music-
 and  banned                                                from   further
 foreign tours for three years;
 that the ban was renewed in 1962
 after his marriage to a non-_
 Soviet girl he met as a student
 that his wife was compelled by
 a threat to his career to take
 Soviet citizenship and become
 a " moral hostage " for. him ;
 and that what tipped the scale
 in their decision to leave was
 a last-minute attempt by the
 authorities to stop his w i f c
 joining him on his 1963 British'
 visit.
 He said   Since 1 always had
 a bad conscience about my wife's
 sacrifice of her freedom of .move-'
 our marriage would have'
 been distorted and under stress
 had we stayed in Russia."
 A prodigy,

 prodigy iii 'coming second In the.
 Chopin international '.comrpeti
 tion in Warsaw at the age of 17?
 and winning the Queen'Elizabeth
 international piano competition,
 at Brussels at 18, and the Tchai-
 kovsky competition, is still cen-
 tral to  the world prestige of
 Russian music.
 Even in the West, he has
 remained one of "good boys"
 among Soviet artists abroad. Ile
 maintained from the start-and
 convincingly Insisted at Epidau-
 rus-that his motives were non-.
 political  and  entirely, centred
 round his family.
 The main motive behind his
 detailed repudiation of the Rus-
 sian claim appears to have been
 a sense  that  Russia  was  not
 matching his own reticence-and
 was, indeed, exploiting it. " I
 will be glad to know that people
 who care know the facts." lie
 said.
 Ile did not feel that his father,
 mother, or sister, who still live
 in 1lloscow, would be endangered
 by his action in " putting the
 record  straight."  He  said :
 "These are not Stalin's ;times in
 Russia any. more."
 His  father  is  a  successful,
 variety pianist-:accompanist. His
 sister is studying to be a musi-.
 ciao or music teacher at the.
 Pedagogical Institute in Moscow.
 `Access' to Russia
 The text of Alr Ashkenazy's
 letter was
 Dear Sir.
 In the " Guardian" of August 1
 an article appeared regarding Mr'
 Kuznetsov's decision to remain in
 England. In this article reference
 was  made  to  my  own  free
 "access" to and from the USSR.
 The relevant paragraph read as
 follows : "The Russian argunient
 is that Mr Kuznetsov would
 ' probably' have been granted a
 period of residence abroad if ho
 had applied  in Moscow.  The
 recent examples cited arc Valcriy
 Tarsis, a far more savage critic
 of the regime than Alt' Kuznetsuv,
 and the pianist Alr Vladimir Ash?
 kenazy,   who   moves freely
 between   Aloscow.  Iceland. and
 Britain."

 that Anatoly Kuznctsov, the Soviet

 states, who must try to function and
 survive under bizarre and tortuous, re-
 strictions unimaginable, to a Western
 writer. A simple sigh of thanks for our
 blessings might be more in order. The
 plight of the artist under Communism,
 never pleasant, is worsening; the only
 thing going for him is the enthusiasm

 he falls short of the heroic standards
 upheld by Miss Hellman and Mr.
 Amis-a ? custodian, for millions, of
 a certain human . flame, of certain
 human capacities for expression, ex-
 altation, formal control, and creative
 joy. We are moved - to these remarks
 by a letter that has been passed on to
 us. Its recipient is a young American
 writer, its sender a Czech girl now
 living in exile who happehed to like
 a book the man had written. "There in
 Prague, we used to exhibit our paint-'
 ings on Charles Bridge," she wrote
 him. "Our paintings were probably
 bad, because we were just seventeen
 or, twenty, but we loved them, because
 through them we were perceiving the
 world. And there we discussed life and.
 death, eternity and matter, and the
 confluence of things, and everything.
 We were so terribly happy there in the
 midst of the paintings and the light, on
 that stone bridge saturated with cen-
 turies of history. It was as if we were
 watching, the sea; everything was as if
 grown together with the' earth-it had
 the same kind of symmetry. I do not
 know whether you can imagine all this.
 -but it was immensely hcautiful.
 So beautiful that one did not
 sense other people or life, and
 felt removed from one's own
 body and sensed only the words,
 surrounded by the, paintings. Or
 those crazy chases when the
 cops tried to prevent us from
 selling the paintings. (Because
 Czechoslovakia is a Communist
 country and only the state is
 entitled to sell and exploit.) 1 t
 used  to  be  a  happy  chase
 through the crooked streets of
 the Little Quarter. We .shouted
 out of slicer happiness at seeing
 the clumsily moving cops. And
 the immense feeling of happi-
 ness when we ran, tired, into a
 pub, clutching our paintings, to; our!
 breasts. That was our world. It was
 not necessary to read so much in those
 times, because one could learn about
 the world through one's friends."
