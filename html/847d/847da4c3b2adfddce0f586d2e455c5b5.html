 How We Helped Ho Chi Minh
 By HILAIRE DU BERRIER
 The war in Indo-China today is no accident. Plans
 were laid in China in 1941; stepped up by American
 aid which went for arming the "agrarian reformers."
 In ages past, natives shunned the jungles along the
 Seam Rap River of Indo-China. Phantom armies,
 they said, swept ceaselessly through the forest led
 by weeping queens on shadowy elephants.
 Today armies are there but they are not phan-
 toms of the vanished empire of the Khmers. Crack
 divisions composed of some 120,000 men of Ho
 Chi Minh's Red rebels have cut Indo-China in
 two and are bleeding France white in both men
 and money-one-fourth of her officer cadre and
 more money than France has received in Marshall
 Plan aid in the disheartening years since World
 War Two theoretically closed its ledgers. Aid to
 France has thus been more than nullified by the
 lone struggle in Indo-China.
 But there are ghosts in Indo-China-the same
 sort of ghosts that haunt the record of America's
 part in the fall of the Chinese mainland. For in
 Indo-China, too, the background of the Commun-
 ists' rise to power follows a grimly familiar
 pattern: an American-fostered propaganda line that
 the Communists were agrarian reformers; that
 their leader Ho Chi Minh was a "good man" despite
 his Moscow training; that forces opposing the
 Communists were reactionary and not to be listened
 to.
 Moreover, in Indo-China, American aid initially
 armed the very troops the French are fighting
 today. Thus, in the horrible topsy-turvy of diplo-
 matic blunders we find ourselves paying 80 per
 cent of the war cost in Indo-China to combat a
 foe we actually encouraged with our help.
 A Lulling Tune
 The Institute of Pacific Relations was given a
 full report on Indo-China as far back as July 1950.
 It was, in effect, a Wedemeyer-like report, de-
 tailing the Communist build-up and pointing to
 future aggressions. The report was rejected in its
 entirety.
 Instead, I.P.R. and the American public listened
 to a more lulling tune. The pace of the "line" on
 Indo-China was set in Harper's Magazine in a
 series of articles by Harold R. Isaacs. These
 articles, in turn, were the by-product of a reporting
 trip Isaacs had just completed for Newsweek, to
 which he was then contributing as an authority on
 the Far East. Isaacs' line was simple and to the
 point-the Communist point: Ho Chi Minh was a
 patriot, fighting the evil colonialism of the French.
 Isaacs' view aroused a number of readers.
 Ho, the man Isaacs defended as a sort of local
 saint, was educated in the Soviet's Orient Uni-
 versity and then, in 1925, sent to Canton as an
 assistant to Borodin. In 1931 the British dis-
 covered that he was head of the Southeast Asia
 Bureau of the Third International, and expelled
 him from Hong Kong. At the time Isaacs was in
 Shanghai as a newspaperman certainly in a posi-
 tion to know what was going on. Yet, in the
 Harper's articles he described Ho as a patriot kept
 alive by "honesty of purpose and absence of
 illusion."
 In 1941 (not 1943 as indicated by U.S. reports
 of the "tenth anniversary" of Ho's government in
 December 1953), Ho's Vietminh Front first emerged
 as a shadow government. It was established, not
 in Indo-China, but on Chinese soil. The man who
 planted its seeds was a southern war lord named
 Chang Fa-kwei. It was his hope actually to take
 over the rich provinces of Kwangsi, Yunnan, and
 Kwantung and, eventually, part if not all of Indo-
 China. Ho, then posing as head of an "exile"
 government during the Japanese invasion, seemed
 a perfect foil. Chang Fa-kwei "recognized" Ho.
 His master plan called for Ho, after American
 arms had run off the Japanese, to run off the
 French. Then Chang could run off Ho ! The plan
 benefited only Ho. Chang Fa-kwei is now in Hong
 Kong, himself an exile from both Formosa and the
 mainland. Gradually, forces he set in motion en-
 circle him.
 Within three years Ho's "government in exile"
 was given full diplomatic status and established
 as a going concern in Luchow. Large quantities
 of American arms, from that moment on, were
 dumped in Ho's eager hands. He was, of course,
 supposed to fight the Japanese. There is only one
 instance on record of any friction between the
 Vietminh and the Japanese during this period.
 It was an incident in an isolated village. Eight
 Japanese were killed.
 The Japanese were well aware of what was going
 on; that Ho would pounce on the French as soon
 as the Japanese withdrew. So it was to Ho and his
 American-equipped forces that the Japanese sur-
 rendered their arms when they gave up in North-
 ern Indo-China.

 ?
 of our opinion makers and politicians to admit
 their past blunders and lack of principle.
 In general the American press, too, avoids re-
 examining the past in favor of preserving the
 illusion that Roosevelt's "unconditional surrender"
 policy and the Teheran, Yalta, and Potsdam agree-
 ments were justified. The danger which results
 from this pretense is that the, public can be
 persuaded that future agreements with Moscow
 and Peiping are both possible and desirable.
 It has already been proved that Mr. Dulles
 was wrong when he said, following the Berlin Con-
 ference, that the Soviet "alternatives to Western
 planning" are so repellent that even France would
 recognize the necessity of permitting western Ger-
 many to rearm. On the contrary, the French are not
 only showing less and less inclination to ratify
 the European Defense Community treaty. On March
 19, after Dr. Adenauer's government had managed
 to persuade the Bonn Parliament to amend the Con-
 stitution to permit German rearmament for the
 defense of Europe, the Allied High Commissioners
 intervened at French insistence to delay President
 Heuss' signature to the constitutional amendment.
 Finally, France was persuaded to withdraw her
 veto on condition that Germany should never re-
 arm except within the confines of the EDC treaty.
 France would never have dared to take such
 action were it not for the encouragement given
 at Berlin to the French politicians who want peace
 at any price in Indo-China, and who, having never
 liked the European Defense treaty, would be de-
 lighted to sacrifice it for the sake of an entente
 with Moscow and Peiping.
 As the New York Times said in an editorial
 February 25: "The Geneva Conference can become
 a trap only if France permits herself to be lured
 into abandonment of the European Defense Com-
 munity and her own safety in return for a `peace'
 in Indo-China that can be broken the next day."
 The one thing wrong with this statement is
 the word "only." For, as the New York Times'
 own Paris correspondent reported on March 21,
 U. S. officials have "reluctantly come to the con-
 clusion that the French government wants to
 preserve the European Defense Community issue
 as a bargaining point at Geneva," on the assump-
 tion that throwing EDC into the discard will
 be "the price exacted for a settlement in Indo-
 China."
 At Geneva Mr. Dulles will have to contend not
 only with the French appeasers. He will also face
 the more formidable opposition of the British
 empire. Sir Gladwyn Jebb has publicly stated
 that the Chinese Communists should be admitted
 to the U. N. provided they "purge themselves" of
 their aggression in Korea and Indo-China._ Mr.
 Lester Pearson, Canada's Minister of External
 Affairs, has declared that we ought to take "a
 more realistic, less emotional look" at Communist
 China, provided she refrains from any "fresh
 acts of aggression." And Mr. St. Laurent, the
 Canadian Prime Minister, after conferring with
 Nehru, announced in Manila in March that Can
 ada must sooner or later recognize Communist
 China as "the government that the people want."
 Meanwhile Adlai Stevenson has been busy preach-
 ing the old Lattimore line, as when he said in a
 speech at Harvard March 19: "In Asia Commun-
 ism has the advantage of the great weight of
 the New China's power and attraction."
 Betrayal of Asian Allies
 The stage is set for our abandonment of the
 Chinese  Nationalist  Government,  and  in  the
 course of time, also of Syngman Rhee. The be-
 trayal, urged upon us by the British and French,
 need not take the obvious form of recognition of
 the Peiping government and its admission to the
 U. N. What the Communists want now is not de
 jure recognition of Peiping but trade with the
 Western world for the purpose of preparing them-
 selves to attack and destroy us in the future.
 They will be well satisfied if we agree to supply
 them with the sinews of war even if we remain
 outwardly loyal to our old ally, Chiang Kai-shek.
 It is all too obvious that Mr. Dulles faces not
 only a hard, but a well-nigh impossible task at
 Geneva. He cannot at the same time satisfy Brit-
 ain and France and the American people and
 Congress. The former are clearly ready to let the
 Far East go for a few paper promises from Moscow
 and Peiping, making it possible for France to
 retire gracefully from Indo-China, and for Britain
 to resume unrestricted trade with Red China and
 the rest of the Soviet empire.
 The  Secretary of  State's  speech  on  March
 29 shows that he will make a valiant effort not
 to give way to appeasement pressures. But since
 the American people are prepared neither to
 risk war now before Moscow is ready to attack
 us, nor to appease the Communists for the sake
 of peace in our time and to please our faint-
 hearted allies, there seems no solution for Mr.
 Dulles' problem. He may have only himself to
 blame for the impossible assignment he is faced
 with at Geneva. However, it seemed to me while
 in Berlin during the first two weeks of the con-
 ference that Dulles, having first adopted a high
 moral and also politically realistic position, was
 being forced to climb down from it by Washing-
 ton as well as by Paris and London. For instance,
 according to information given me by two corre-
 spondents who attended his highly select small
 press conference on Sunday February 7, Dulles
 stated he had had a two-hour conversation with
 Washington the day before, and went on to say that
 he would go along with Bidault on the Far East.
 He is clearly slated to be the scapegoat for
 America's irresoluteness and for the shortsighted
 selfishness of our Western allies.

 Saigon, Hanoi, and Haiphong. A pair of them as-
 signed to investigate the situation in Indo-China
 got in touch with the French "underground" officer
 who had written the report on which they were
 acting. The officer was in rags. He had no facilities
 to entertain them. He had, after all, just been
 through a war. So had Ho's men, but, unlike the
 French, they had not suffered. Within twenty-four
 hours the American officers were firmly in the
 hands of a well-primed and sufficiently heeled group
 of English-speaking Communists and former col-
 laborators who efficiently set about denouncing the
 French and praising Ho-in direct opposition to the
 demonstrable facts the French were trying un-
 successfully to get the officers to heed.
 "Guides" and "Translators"
 The efficiency of these "guides" was increased
 in ever-widening circles as other American mis-
 sions lavished their vitamin tablets and K-rations
 on them, while the French remained relatively
 impoverished. And, as in China, as soon as the
 Americans became committed to any part of the
 line being fed by the "progressive natives," they
 acquired an unshakable vested interest in all parts
 of the line. Before long such an officer as Major
 Robert Buckley of the 01S8 wrote off all French
 charges against Ho as mere gripes, to be ignored.
 George Sheldon, a bitterly anti-French observer
 to begin with, worked with OSS in the area, then
 returned to Saigon as vice-consul. From that van-
 tage he wrote letters, official reports, and articles
 (for I.P.R.) supporting Ho's cause against the
 French. Another American officer, while French
 officers who knew the situation watched amazed and
 helpless, donated money to Ho and made a stirring
 speech on his behalf.
 To keep this American support going, Ho used
 a device that had served the Communists well in
 China. As if by magic pro-Ho translators always
 appeared to grab jobs with American missions. A
 bright young man named Li Xuan was an out-
 standing example.
 In his day-by-day work, Li simply told natives
 that American aid would come because of Ho. And
 for the Americans he "translated" their replies
 to any questions as ringing tributes to Ho. What
 either side in the conversation really said was
 incidental and unknown. After a while Li acquired
 G.I. clothes and went off more and more on his own,
 linking American aid and Ho for the benefit of the
 impressionable natives. Finally, after ",hitch-hiking"
 to Shanghai aboard an American general's plane,
 he instigated there a rebellion of Annamite troops
 against the French. This time he even posed as an
 American officer to whip up the fury. A full report
 on his activities was greeted by the thoroughly
 buffaloed OSS with the comment: "The French are
 beefing again."
 And so Li went merrily on. From the garrison-
 rousing he went to Fred Hamson, bureau chief of
 the Associated Press in Shanghai, and made an
 arrangement to work as a "stringer" correspondent
 in Indo-China. Back home he affixed A.P. war cor-
 respondent badges to his clothes and, besides filing
 news to the international wire service, again used
 a phony American connection to raise Ho's prestige.
 When Hamson tried to stop him he simply dis-
 appeared.
 Meantime, the barriers against any factual re-
 ports from Indo-China grew. A North Dakota-born
 OSS employee was summarily dismissed on orders
 from Washington after warning -against Ho. The
 reason given: that the man was a Canadian!
 Back in America things were humming for Ho,
 too. When a Vietnam-American Friendship Asso-
 ciation held a banquet in New York in 1948 (and
 it must be recalled that Vietnam, today, is anti-
 thetical to Ho's Vietminh), the pro-Ho OSS Major
 Buckley was on hand to provide his learned views.
 Harold Isaacs' was busy, too. After leaving News-
 week at about the time of the Alger Hiss trial,
 he busied himself as a reviewer of books on the
 Far East for the New York Herald Tribune. In
 April 1950 he turned up as a lecturer at the
 American Academy of Political and Social Science
 in Philadelphia. On the same dates the meeting
 was also addressed by Owen Lattimore. A year
 later Isaacs denied knowing Lattimore.
 American Fears Tied French Hands
 With war finally blazing, of course, the direct-
 support phase of the great Ho Chi Minh hoax was
 over. Indirection became the only possibility-a
 situation again comparable to the one in China.
 In the fall of 1953, as more and more signs
 pointed to the building up of the present Red
 all-out offensive, French officers debated possible
 counter-measures. The situation was desperate.
 Public opinion at home was against further sacri-
 fices in a lone fight for an area in which little
 influence or interest would remain to them if they
 won it. While they felt they were staving off the
 communization of southeast Asia alone, portions
 of the American press continued to oppose such
 aid as they were receiving with the cry that
 America was perpetuating colonialism.
 Specialists on the Far East, led by a former
 underground leader in Indo~China, hit on an idea.
 Commerce in the Associated States of Indo-China
 is largely in the hands of Chinese merchants. It
 was their war also. A Chinese general of sufficient
 stature to command a following in the border
 provinces of Yunnan, Kwangsi, and Kwangtung
 was enlisted to form an anti-Red Chinese volunteer
 army, take over a sector of the front, and start
 hacking his way toward Red China. In return for
 arms and support he pledged a guerrilla movement
 within these provinces that would cut Chinese aid
 from Ho Chi Minh and even harry the Vietminh

 rear. With Ho's defeat, the Chinese might gather
 momentum and roll into Red China. Again Amer-
 ican fears of bringing Mao Tse-tung openly into
 the struggle tied French hands. As in North Korea
 in the case of General MacArthur, we committed
 the French to ?a struggle without victory.
 In Paris a rumor spread at the beginning of
 this year that the fighting would cease with
 a direct deal between Washington and Moscow.
 Whether the idea was inspired by the Communists
 to bring about French inertia while their own plans
 for reinforcement proceeded, or whether the forth-
 coming Geneva conference is a step toward that
 end, it is still too early to say.
 Letter from Paris
 Bidault's Mistake
 By R. G. WALDECK
 Only a few weeks ago American diplomats in
 Europe believed that the Berlin Conference had
 convinced the French that no solution for Europe
 was to be expected from talking with the Russians,
 and that speedy ratification of EDC was the only
 alternative. But it came out quite differently. Opti-
 mistic observers here note that the conference had
 no effect on the French attitude on EDC one way or
 the other. Pessimistic ones insist that resistance to
 ratification has stiffened since the conference. My
 own observations gibe with those of the pessimists.
 This much is certain: the efforts made by Wash-
 ington and Bonn to get the French to ratify EDC
 before the Geneva Conference have failed. The
 Parliament feels that there is no use in beginning
 the debate on EDC before the Saar question is
 settled and close association between the United
 States, Britain, and EDC countries is guaranteed.
 As for the Saar question, it looked for a moment
 as though a settlement was within reach. Dr.
 Adenauer, in his eagerness to bring off EDC, "of-
 fered up the Saar to Europeanization in a non-
 existent Europe," as one sharp-penned German
 journalist put it. However, the French suddenly
 raised the ante, and talks have been suspended.
 Bidault, it is said, wishes to use ratification as a
 trump card in Geneva. Premier Laniel, who has
 been in power for nine months, wants to beat the
 record of M. Queuille, who stayed in power for a
 whole year-but the debate over EDC, he fears,
 might spoil it all. Also dampening to the govern-
 ment's enthusiasm is the growing suspicion that
 only a socialist government, headed by Europe-
 minded Socialist Guy Mollet, can bring about a vote
 for ratification.
 It will be, at best, a hard fight. For the French
 feel more strongly than they did a year or so ago
 that EDC constitutes a long-term adventure of the
 first magnitude. Still, in the end, France is likely
 to ratify EDC as being the lesser evil. At least
 that's what the public opinion polls indicate and
 what most friends of the West hope for. "Just let
 them end the war in Indo-China," they say, "and
 the ratification of EDC will go through like a
 breeze."
 But will the Geneva Conference end the war?
 While in the United States the conference is con-
 demned as a "concession" to the French which
 might result in a Far Eastern Munich, the French,
 too, have their misgivings about the conference. In
 fact, with the exception of M. Bidault and his
 friends inside and outside of the Cabinet, almost
 everyone seems to fear that nothing good can re-
 sult from it. Also, a heated debate is raging both
 publicly and privately as to whether or not it was
 clever of Bidault to insist on this new confrontation
 with the Reds.
 Bidault, it is well known, founds his hopes for
 Geneva on the apparent alacrity with which Molotov
 in Berlin jumped at the chance of a conference on
 Asia; and on reports that Mao does not get on with
 Malenkov, is sorely in need of economic aid such
 as only the West can furnish, and is eager to play
 his part in the concert of nations. Thus Bidault
 believes that Mao would be ready to stop aid to the
 Vietminh in exchange for admission to the U.N. and
 economic concessions. But, even assuming that
 Bidault knows the score, politically minded French-
 men realize that only the United States can fur-
 nish what Mao covets. And they think it unlikely
 that the United States will abandon her resistance
 to recognizing Red China just to end the war in
 Indo-China. Not that they approve of Washington's
 intransigence concerning Mao. His de facto recog-
 nition is inevitable in the long run, they say, and
 it is unwise to resist unduly the inevitable.
 Although the French have cried "wolf" fre-
 quently since the Liberation with a view to extract-
 ing aid from the United States, it would be a mis-
 take, I believe, to take too lightly the fears they
 voice at present. The failure of the Geneva Con-
 ference to produce peace in Indo-China might well
 result in the collapse of the pro-Western conserva-
 tive regime in France and its replacement by the
 neutralists, who would end the war at any cost and
 delay the ratification of EDC indefinitely.
 No wonder, then, that quite a few astute French
 politicians consider the Geneva Conference as a
 trap, designed to swallow up the Atlantic Alliance,
 and as a device to delay and kill the European army
 plan. They argue that while there might be a
 ghost of a chance for peace in direct negotiations
 with the exhausted Ho Chi Minh, it was sheer mad-
 ness to expect peace from Molotov. Why, they
 argue, should Molotov wish to facilitate the ratifi-
 cation of EDC by making peace in Indo-China? It
 just isn't his way of doing things, they say, and
 they fear that Bidault made a fatal mistake in
 letting the West in for the conference.
