 The proposal contained in the report
 prompted the announcement a few days
 ago that Solvay has been prepared to go
 much further.  The company is very
 interested in the possibililty of joining
 with the county in the development of
 a single treatment facility to deal with
 the industrial waste and the municipal
 sewage in Nine Mile Creek, the stream
 into which Solvay's waste water flows.
 Solvay has offered to pay for the feasi-
 bility study.  A spokesman for the di-
 vision terms the action "a growth in com-
 pany policy," but I believe it is much
 more than this.  At the very least it is
 an example of Solvay's responsible rec-
 ognition of a problem, its progressive
 willingness to contribute to a solution,
 and an expression of leadership that both
 other industries and units of govern-
 ment should emulate.
 I am hopeful that the true spirit of co-
 operative federalism, resting, as it must,
 on local initiative and planning, will
 bring about in the very near future the
 long awaited restoration of Onondaga
 Lake.
 H.R. 13993, HORTON BILL TO ALLOW
 AN INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR
 CERTAIN COSTS OF MOVING
 (Mr. HORTON asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. HORTON. Mr. Speaker, my col-
 leagues will recall the strong support I
 voiced and voted yesterday in behalf of
 H.R. 10607, a bill to provide reimburse-
 ment to Federal employees for many of
 the costs they incur when they are re-
 quired to move from one job location to
 another.  I believe we acted wisely in
 according Government employees a pro-
 tection that is already practiced widely
 in private Industry.
 However, there is another aspect of
 these moving expenses that deserves our
 consideration and constructive correc-
 tion, and this problem involves all em-
 ployees, public or private, who receive
 reimbursement for moving costs.  I am
 referring to the tax treatment of such
 reimbursement.
 Certain categories of reimbursement
 for employee moving expenses; namely,
 travel costs of the employee and his im-
 mediate family as well as the costs of
 moving household goods from the old to
 new place of employment, have not been
 considered income to the employee and
 thus have not been taxed.  As a logical
 extension of this tax-free treatment, the
 88th Congress provided that these ex-
 penses, whether reimbursed by a new em-
 ployer or paid for by the employee chang-
 ing employers, in his move from one
 location  to  another,  were  similarly
 deductible.
 The problem presented and that which
 my new bill seeks to overcome is that the
 aforementioned expenses do not embrace
 the total cost burden to a moving em-
 ployee. Just as we have legislatively rec-
 ognized in H.R. 10607, he faces-
 The expenses of a house-hunting trip
 for himself and his wife;
 Temporary living costs at his new lo-
 cation while he and his family await the
 arrival of their household effects;
 The fees and other costs of selling his
 old house;
 Expenses attendant on the purchase of
 a new house, such as attorney fees and
 other closing costs; and
 The numerous items commonly con-
 sidered as a lump sum or miscellaneous
 figure, including appliance connections,
 licenses, size adjustments, and other in-
 cidentals.
 Repeating, H.R. 10607 recognizes these
 items as a burden on the moved Federal
 employee that his Federal Government
 employer  should  assume.  Similarly,
 many private concerns already make
 provision for the reimbursement of these
 costs.
 But, the benefit of reimbursement be-
 comes considerably diminished when the
 employee must treat it as ordinary in-
 come.  Further, his employer is required
 to withhold from it and report it in the
 same manner as the employee's wages.
 A taxpayer who carried a case through
 the courts involving his belief that he
 should be permitted a deduction for re-
 imbursement received lost out when the
 Supreme Court denied a review.  How-
 ever, in opposing the review, the Attorney
 General argued that Congress rather
 than the Court should decide the issue
 Involved.
 Thus, Mr. Speaker, I believe there is
 this additional reason for a congressional
 response to the present unfair tax treat-
 ment of thousands of Americans required
 to move from one place to another each
 year because such a move is required by
 the nature of their employment or the
 mobility of our economy.
 For two principal reasons, first, that it
 Is manifestly inconsistent for the Gov-
 ernment to recognize the legitimacy of
 these expenses for reimbursement on the
 one hand while taxing that reimburse-
 ment as income on the other, and second,
 that it is not proper policy for Govern-
 ment to impose a drag on the necessary
 mobility of our society and economy.
 I urge my colleagues to consider closely
 the need for this legislation with the
 hope they will join me in working for its
 prompt passage.
 CORRECTION OF ROLLCALL
 Mr.  DUNCAN  of  Tennessee.  Mr.
 Speaker, on roilcall No. 268, on Septem-
 ber 8, 1965, a quorum call, I am recorded
 as absent.  I was present and answered

 that the permanent RECORD and Journal

 Tennessee?
 There was no objection.
 demonstrated the fact that most Amer-
 icans support our present Vietnam policy.
 The principle of. free speech is deeply
 ingrained in our American life and it
 has proven its benefits over the years.
 The arguments we have heard have
 served to crystallize the areas of con-
 troversy, to define the Issues more clearly
 and, therefore, to give all Americans a
 better opportunity to understand our
 course of action.
 An editorial appearing in the March
 11, 1966, issue of Life magazine com-
 ments on this debate.  It suggests that
 we should now call a truce on such di-
 visive debate and give the administra-
 tion an opportunity to demonstrate what
 it can accomplish in Vietnam.
 I suggest that such a pause would be
 wise and would serve our Nation's inter-
 est well.  While we recognize that there
 is not total unanimity of opinion on all
 phases of our Vietnam policy, there is
 substantial agreement by a great ma-
 jority of Americans in support of it.
 Let us now get on with the job.  Our
 position has improved, our troops have
 the initiative.  Let us spend the next
 few months determining how to give
 them the maximum support rather than
 engaging in a great debate which will

 TIME FOR A PAUSE IN THE BIG DEBATE
 The overwhelmingly favorable vote on the
 President's request for an additional $4.8
 billion in funds for Vietnam shows that most
 Congressmen recognize the need to pay for
 our commitments.  Even so, the action.was
 not accomplished in a spirit of pure unanim-
 ity.  Senator FULBRIGHT cast an approving
 vote only because he belatedly decided that a
 money bill is not the proper place to amend
 policy.  Seventy-five Members of the liberal
 House Democratic study group thought it
 necessary to explain their "ayes" did not
 mean that they favor unrestrained or indis-
 criminate enlargement of the military effort
 in Vietnam (as if anyone did).
 Congress reflects the undercurrent of dis-
 sent and controversy that continues to flow
 beneath our Vietnam policy.   But for all
 their qualms and misgivings most Americans
 seem convinced that the hard course chosen
 by the administration is the correct one. The
 conviction of this majority deserves to be
 honored too.
 The debate during the last 2 months has
 been enlightened, and enlightening, in our
 tradition of free speech.  FULBRIGHT'S forum,
 the  Senate  Foreign  Relations  Committee
 hearings, succeeded in defining the main is-
 sue as whether or not we can or should con-
 tain Red China.  Answers to this come no
 easier, but the questions make more sense
 than they often did before.
 Now that the hearings are complete, and
 the money deposited to account, perhaps the
 G  1 l   - time has come to recognize that we are en-
 TIME TO REPLACE DEBATE WITH
 SUPPORT
 (Mr. BROOKS asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks and include an editorial.)
 Mr. BROOKS.  Mr. Speaker, for many
 weeks there has been a continuous dia-
 log concerning the U.S. activities in Viet-
 nam.  While this discussion has dis-
 closed areas of controversy, it has also
 gaged in a war in Vietnam which can in fact
 be won.  President Johnson observed a 37-
 day pause in the bombing at the beginning
 of this year, to give North Vietnam a chance
 (which it ignored)  to respond with some
 pacific gesture.  How about a 37-day pause in
 the criticism to let the President's policy
 go forward unhindered?  Or better yet, a
 137-day pause, during which time the admin-
 istration should have a real opportunity to
 show what can be accomplished militarily
 and otherwise in Vietnam. After that, crit-
 icism might be appropriate or even-who
 knows? unnecessary.

 STATEMENT
 The managers on the part of the House at
 the conference on the disagreeing votes of
 the two Houses on the amendments of the
 Senate to the bill (H.R. 6845) to correct in-
 equities with respect to the basic: compen..
 sation of teachers and teaching positions
 under  the  Defense  Department  Overseas
 Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act,
 submit the following statement in explana??
 tion of the effect of the action agreed upon
 by the conferees and recommended in the
 accompanying conference :report:
 Amendment  No.  (1) :  This  amendment
 struck out subsection (c) of the first sect tort
 of the House bill which contained provisions
 to the effect that a teacher shall not be eli.?
 gibie to hold a teaching position or positions
 overseas for any period exceeding 5 consecu-
 tive years with the exceptions (1) that any
 teacher who returns to the United States for
 not less than 1 year shall be eligible again to
 hold a teaching position or positions over-
 seas for an additional period not exceeding
 5 consecutive years, and (2) that the Secre-
 tary of Defense may extend such 5-year pe-
 riod to not more than 8 years, when neces-
 sary in  the  public interest in individual
 cases.
 The House recedes from its disagreement
 to amendment numbered (1) and agrees to
 the same with an amendment which adds a
 new subsection (c) to section 5 of the De-
 fense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and
 Personnel Practices Act requiring annual re-
 ports by the Secretary of Defense to the Com-
 mittees on Post Office and Civil Service of the
 Senate and House of Representatives with
 respect to teachers subject to such Act.
 Specifically, the new subsection. (c)  pro-
 vides that, on or before the 15th day of
 January of each  calendar  year beginning
 after the date of enactment of the confer-
 ence agreement, the Secretary of Defense
 shall report to the Committees on :Post Office
 and Civil Service of the Senate and House of
 Representatives the following information:
 (1) The  number of  teachers  separated
 from teaching positions subsequent to the
 close  of  the  immediately  preceding full
 school year;
 (2) The number of such separated teach-
 ers who returned to the United States;
 (:3) The number of such separated teach..
 era placed in   positions as teachers in the
 United States following such separation;
 (4) The number of such separated teach-
 ers returned to positions as teachers in the
 United  States  under voluntary  reciprocal
 interchange agreements with school juris-
 dictions in the United States;
 (5) The number of such separated teach-
 ers placed in positions as teachers in the
 United States through special placement as-
 sistance programs of the Department of De-
 fense and the military departments;
 (6) The number of such separated teach-
 ers who (A) were separated at their own re-
 quest and (B) were separated involuntarily;
 (7) The number of such separated teachers
 who had served in teaching positions (A) 3
 years or more and (B) 5 years or more;
 (8) The  number  of  new  teachers  ap-
 pointed to teaching positions at the begin-
 ning of the school year current at time of the
 report; and
 (9) The number of such new teachers ob-
 tained through voluntary reciprocal inter-
 change agreements with school jurisdictions
 in the United States.
 In reaching  agreement with respect  to
 amendment numbered (1), the committee of
 conference makes several observations with
 respect to the intent of such agreement.
 This conference amendment requires the
 Secretary of Defense to report annually, to
 the respective Committees on Post Office and
 Civil Service of the Senate and the House of
 Representatives, certain statistical data with
 respect to the numbers of teachers who are
 appointed to overseas teaching positions, who
 are separated from such positions, who are
 returned to the United States after such
 separations, and who are placed in positions
 as teachers in the United States after such
 separations, as well as with respect to the
 number of years served by teachers In over-
 seas teaching positions.
 This  amendment  recommended  by  the
 committee of conference is intended, and is
 needed, to provide the Senate and House
 Committees on Post Office and Civil Service
 complete, accurate, and timely information
 each year for the exercise of their legislative
 oversight responsibilities with respect to the
 programs for the improvement and revitaliza-
 tion of the overseas dependents school sys-
 tem and its corps of teachers which are to
 be  placed  in  effect  by  the  Secretary  of
 Defense as set forth hereafter.
 This past of the conference agreement was
 adopted in the light of strong and persuasive
 reports from the Department of Defense, the
 three military departments, and organiza-
 tions of teachers that the "rotation" system
 provided by subsection (c) of the first sec-
 tion of the House bill is unworkable.  To
 operate any plan or program of rotating em-
 ployees between Federal positions overseas
 and in the United States, there must be a
 reasonable number of positions of the kind
 involved not only in overseas areas but within
 the  50 States.  The military  departments
 have over 6,000 teaching positions that must
 be filled overseas, whereas the Government
 operates only a relatively few schools in the
 United States.  It is clear that the number
 of possible vacancies In federally operated
 schools within the United States would be
 completely inadequate to support a rotation
 program.
 The managers on the part of the House
 feel, however-and conferees for the Senate
 expressed agreement-that the fundamental
 rotation principle involved in subsection (s)
 of the first section of the bill, as passed by
 the House, is sound and desirable and that
 its purpose should be implemented to the
 extent possible.  An alternative to contribute
 to the achievement of those purposes, devel-
 oped in negotiations with representatives of
 the Department of Defense, was considered

 "I think they will liquidate it by them-
 selves in the course of time."
 Mr. Kennan was talking exactly 1 month
 after the Tri-Continental Communist Con-
 ference in Havana.
 Representative ARMISTEAD  SELDEN, Demo-
 crat, of Alabama, chairman of the House
 Inter-American Affairs Subcommittee, called
 that conference a "Mein Kampf" of interna-
 tional communism.
 Seven hundred and eighty-two Communist
 delegates and observers from 95 countries
 were present.
 They produced what was termed by the
 Organization of American States a "declara-
 tion of war" against the governments of
 Latin America.
 The U.S. representative at the OAS con-
 ference called the Havana meeting "the latest,
 in some respects, the most blatant and open
 effort of the U.S.S.R., Communist China, and
 Cuba * * * to extend their power and in-
 fluence in the free world."
 Not a word of this in Kennan's testimony.
 Listening to him, the conference never took
 place, or at least was too unimportant for
 comment.
 On the contrary, he assured us that we can
 now "sit back."
 "It was just a year ago," wrote the Wash-
 ington  Report  of  the  American  Security
 Council on January 17, "that the Soviet Em-
 bassy  in  Havana  summoned      Communist
 Party delegates from 22  countries of the
 Western Hemisphere to a secret conclave.
 Solidarity plans were mapped for fomenting
 revolution and guerrilla warfare in six Latin
 American countries and a fund of $100 mil-
 lion was set up to finance the objective."
 Was there any mention of this in Ken-
 nan's testimony?
 Not at all.
 On  the  contrary,  he  rejoiced  because
 "someone else pays the bills in Cuba." The
 fact that the money spent is aimed at de-
 stroying us doesn't seem to bother Kerman.
 This kind of testimony from Senator FuL-
 BRIGHT'S "expert" is frightening.

 Mr.                        RUMSFELD.  Mr.  Speaker, if
 there ever was any evidence that a credi-

 can be found in the remarks of various
 Federal Government officials in recent
 years.
 The following article published in 1965

 of one Government official:

 OF
 HON. J. WILLIAM STANTON
 OF OHIO
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, March 15, 1966
 Mr. STANTON.                                                       Mr. Speaker, a most
 persistent theme of Soviet propaganda
 has been that in the Soviet Union racial
 and ethnic groups enjoy perfect freedom
 to pursue and develop their distinct na-
 tional cultures within the framework of
 the Soviet system.  This clever move had
 deceived millions of people, but all well-
 informed people of the free world know
 that it is a hoax, a mere sham.  We know
 that what the Soviets do is almost the
 opposite of what they say in this as in
 many other respects.  Not only are the
 nationality groups within the Soviet
 Union denied the freedom to follow
 their own national cultural, artistic and
 educational development, but this is also
 forbidden even in the allegedly sovereign
 Soviet satellite countries.  The leaders in
 these countries do not even contemplate,
 for fear of brutal reprisals by their mas-
 ters in the Kremlin, doing anything that
 would arouse the wrath of their Commu-
 nist overlords.
 The story of the Byelorussians is a
 case in point.  These gifted and genial
 people, today numbering more than 10
 million, have had their ups and downs
 in their turbulent history.  In modern
 times theirs has been a sad ar}d tragic
 lot.  After enjoying relative peace and
 prosperity through the Middle Ages and
 in early modern times, their country was
 overrun by the Russians in the 17th cen-
 tury and it became part of the Russian
 empire.  For centuries they strove to
 maintain their distinct national traits
 and national traditions . They kept alive
 their sentiment of nationality, and the
 spirit of freedom they never allowed to
 shrivel. And in the First World War,
 when the Russian empire was crushed in
 A1705
 the Revolutions of 1917, these people saw
 their chance to free themselves and pro-
 claimed their independence on March 25,
 1918.
 That memorable event took place 48
 years ago.  Since then untold numbers
 of catastrophic events have overtaken
 the Byelorussians, but these events have
 no   extinguished their long-cherished
 spirit of national independence and free-
 dom.  Their independence lasted for
 about 2 years; and soon Communist Rus-
 sians put an end to that, making Byelo-
 russia a part of the Communist Soviet
 Union. There the Soviets imposed their
 rigid and inflexible tyranny, and turned
 the country into a large prison house.
 Amid all the misery and suffering pre-
 vailing there for more than four decades,
 it is encouraging to know that the Byelo-
 russians still cherish their national goal,
 their freedom and independence. On the
 48th anniversary of their independence
 we ardently hope that some day and soon
 they will cast off their Communist yoke
 and regain their freedom.
 Rescue Service in Space?

 HON. LESTER L. WOLFF
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, March 22, 1966
 Mr. WOLFF.                             Mr. Speaker, I include
 in the RECORD the following editorial
 from a recent edition of the New York
 Times, as I believe the proposal for a
 space rescue service merits study, as does
 any suggestion that would increase the
 safety of those intrepid men who are
 expanding the limit of man's under-
 standing of the universe.
 RESCUE SERVICE IN SPACE?
 American and Soviet disclosures last week
 of specific hazards in manned space travel
 have indicated at least the outlines of needed
 next steps in space safety.
 The Gemini 8 astronauts, it has now been
 made clear, were in extreme peril while their
 capsule was rolling wildly.  A short-circuit
 of the type that caused their plight can never
 be totally eliminated as a risk in the complex
 electronics of space.  From Moscow, mean-
 while, has come word that a malfunction a
 year ago forced two Russian cosmonauts to
 land in a snowbound forest far from their
 target area.  They could not be rescued for
 2  days.
 No  doubt, engineers  will  make  further
 progress in building protective and back-up
 equipment to reduce the danger of break-
 downs in flight.  Yet, the likelihood that
 mishaps will occur even with the most in-
 genious safety system makes it desirable that
 consideration be given now to the practicality
 of organizing a space rescue service, prefer-
 ably under cooperative auspices of the United
 States and the Soviet Union.
 Its function would be to send space craft,
 on very short notice, to aid a space vessel
 marooned in orbit and incapable of returning
 to earth under its own power.  In some cases
 the need might be for additional rocket fuel
 or replacement parts; in others the primary
 function might be to save lives by taking
 aboard the crew of a disabled capsule.
 Man has already demonstrated that his
 basic capabilities in space hold out the po-

 Mr. Dubinsky's Well-Earned Rest
 1iiXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 ZION. ROMAN C. PUCINSKI
 1)t' ILLINOIS
 l1V THE HOUSE: OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday. March 2.2, 1966
 Mr. PUCINSKI.    Mr. Speaker, as were
 his multitude of admirers and friends, I
 Loo was saddened to learn that David
 Dubinsky is retiring as general president
 of the International Ladies' Garment
 Workers.
 The news was unexpected and con-
 a;til,utes a tremendous loss to the labor
 movement.  I was saddened because of
 the great contribution David Dubinsky
 has made not only to the cause of union-
 ium but to his country, and because it
 is hard to imagine the international and
 domestic scene without his active partic-
 ipation.  Although no giant in physical
 size, he is indeed a giant among labor
 leaders in our country.
 Of the many articles, editorials and
 columns I have  read concerning Mr.
 Dubinsky's retirement, John Herling's
 recent column in the Washington Daily
 News seemed to me to express unusually
 well  the essence  of  the  man  David
 nubinsky is and the sense of loss his
 members and so many of his friends must
 feel. I would like to bring it to the atten-
 tion of my colleagues.
 David Dubinsky     has  unquestionably
 earned the privilege of spending his lat-
 ter years in a less strenuous life, un-
 doubtedly pursuing interests of special
 concern to him.  It is my hope that he
 will continue to give to his members and
 the American people the benefit of his
 vast experience and wisdom.
 Fortunately, Mr. Dubinsky's successor,
 Louis Stulberg, brings a wealth of expe-
 rience to his new position.   Happily,
 1-1,G's petite representative on Capitol
 l:iill, Miss Evelyn Dubrow, will continue
 to advise us and charm us as we consider
 legislation of interest to her union and
 t;o the welfare of the country. In spite
 of her own sadness about Mr. Dubinskv's
 retirement, I am sure she will continue
 to serve well in her dedication to the
 principles for which he fought for so
 many years.
 Tile article follows:
 DOTns!'.,KY  Bows  OUT
 (By John Herling)
 The announcement of the presumed re-
 Lirement of David Dubinsky as general presi-
 dent of the International Ladies' Garment
 Workers Union comes under the head of un-
 believable news.
 At the age of 74 D.D. seems to be able to go
 on forever, with the acquiescence of mern-
 bera, leaders and the public Itself.  He has
 made remarkable contribution to the life of
 his city, State and Nation.  His effectiveness
 in  his  American  field  of  interests  was
 matched by his ready response to interna-
 tional causes.
 All of this comes quite naturally to `iim.
 Pa., in his career there run the stream!i of
 several lives.   First, as the young teenage
 revolutionary in Russian Poland, he literally
 fought czarist tyranny all the way to prison
 and worked. for the unionization of workers.
 When he finally escaped from the Russian
 police, he came to the United States in 1911,
 burning with zeal for carrying on the work of
 social justice.  He did this through the So-
 cialist Party as well as through the cust.ers
 local.  Local leadership led to larger respon-
 sibility in his international union.
 By the middle 1920's, lie was deep  n a
 hand-to-hand conflict with the Communists
 who nearly destroyed the ;[LGWU.  If ever it
 could be said that history was written --or
 made-by  survivors,  it  could  be  said of
 Dubinsky.
 When he succeeded to union presidency in
 19:32, he was on the eve of yet another career:
 The reconstruction of his union, Its enlarge-
 ment  of purpose,                                                                          and identification with
 public causes.   No union. responded more
 creatively to the stimulus of Roosevelt's New
 Deal, whether it was through bringing co-
 herence to a, chaotic industry or by stimulat-
 ing the cultural life of the country through
 the fantastic success of "Pins and Nccdle,"
 a musical show of social significance which
 has become a part of the American theater
 tradition, or through the aggressive support
 of the anti-Fascist and anti-Nazi effort;; at
 home and abroad.
 Ho became important in and to the Anieri-
 can labor movement.  He brought to ii so-
 phistication and it sense of maneuver.  lie
 participated in the early stages of the CIO
 and then withdrew from it.  When he and
 his union rejoined the A.F. of L. he became
 ac>L,ive in unifying the labor movement. By
 this time his friendship with F.D.R., Gover-
 nor Lehman, and Mayor La Guardia moved
 him into the limelight which he has rover
 shunned.  Over the past three decades, his
 sharp jibes and shouting, ebullience have
 brought laughter and light to occupanla of
 the White House as well as residents of U ally
 House, his union's summer resort.
 We are not attempting here :T comprel,en-
 sivo evaluation of David Dubinsky.   As a
 man he can be generous; as a union official
 penny-pinching.   He is by turns efferves-
 cently candid or annoyingly secretive.  lie
 lluctuates from a mood of bouncing, cha.s-
 sidic enthusiasm to the calculating role of a
 tight-lipped, cold-eyed cardplayer.  His pride
 has often led him to excesses of affection or
 to ruthlessness in his relations with his col-
 leagues.  With a group of staff employees who
 took his organization example too literally
 and organized a union of their awn, he be-
 came an implacable foe.  But he bled a little
 in the process.
 .Above all, Mr. Dubinsky has brought Ran
 to his many environments and his friends.
 His zest is infectious.  If you disagree with
 hire, he is apt to regard you as one suffr-ing
 from an  illness  of some  doubtful  origin.
 Even when you agree with him, he expects
 you to agree absolutely.   He won't take a
 mere "yes" for an answer, as some of the
 employers  in  the  garment  industry   have
 learned.
 Now the ILGWU will be facing real trou-
 ble-it will have to learn how to build a life
 without father.     Most of its officials and
 nearly all of the union's membership have
 known no other president.  What is certain,
 they will never know another such..
 Export Controls on Cattle Hides
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 ZION. MASTON O'NEAL
 OF GEORGIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 24, 1966
 Mr. O'NEAL of Georgia.  Mr. Speak-
 er, I would like to join my colleagues
 who have expressed deep concern over
 an injustice to our livestock producers
 resulting from a Department of Com-
 merce order imposing export Controls
 over cattle hides.
 I am no longer shocked when agricul-
 ture is singled out to take the loss in a
 back-door attempt to impose Federal
 price controls.  I do wonder, however,
 just how long the American farmer will
 be able to exist on a smaller and smaller
 share of the consumer dollar.
 In a statement presented to the Sub-
 committee on Livestock and Feed Grains
 of the House Agriculture Committee, I
 attempted to show that the entire live-
 stock industry has been adversely affect-
 ed by the export control order.
 I am taking the liberty of inserting :my
 testimony in the RECORD to call attention
 to the need for a careful reconsideration
 of the matter:
 STATEMENT PRESENTED TO THE HOUSE AGRICUL-
 TURE COMMITTEE, SUBCOMMITTEE ON LIVE-
 STOCK AND FEED GRAINS, BY MASTON O'NE:AL,
 MEMBER OF CONGRESS, SECOND DISTRICT OF
 GEORGIA
 Mr. Chairman, like so many of my col-
 leagues who are concerned over any develop-
 ment  adversely  affecting  the  American
 farmer, I was surprised to learn of the deci-
 sion of Secretary of Commerce Connor to :im-
 pose  export  quotas  and  validated license
 control over cattle hides.
 I have been advised by it number of con-
 stituents  that the        order has already re-
 suited in the reduction of prices on live cattle
 by the equivalent of 25 cents per hundred-
 weight.
 I am deeply concerned over the fact that
 our livestock producers are suffering as the
 result of a seemingly arbitrary decision by
 Secretary Connor.  And I should add that
 the  decision  is  totally  inconsistent  with
 previously announced departmental policies
 to    promote the  exports  of  livestock by-
 products.
 It should be pointed out that the quota
 does not just affect livestock producers for
 we do not know with certainty from where
 the 25 cents per hundredweight on cattle is
 coming.  We are all representatives of con-
 sumers and should be particularly interested
 in the answer to such a question.
 Mr. Chairman, I for one question the wis-
 dom of imposing export controls on cattle
 hides when it seriously affects the entire
 cattle industry.
 The  Department of  Commerce  says its
 move was designed to check an inflationary
 trend in leather prices.   However, I deem
 the move unwise and unnecessary, for we
 are apparently dealing with a temporary sit-
 uation that should correct itself within a
 year or so, or perhaps less.
 Evidence indicates that the increased de-
 mand for exports resulted from the serious
 drought in Argentina.  The reduced exports
 of hides from Argentina are already being
 reversed.  The South American Republic has

 stitutes nothing short of a high-handed
 shakedown," BYRD said, adding that those
 who do not honestly believe home rule to be
 the best solution for Washington's troubles
 "may get their windows smashed."
 Not every Senator is willing to lay it on
 the line like that.  That's why our respect
 for BOB BYRD continues to grow.  In a dis-
 agreeable task that has nothing to do with
 West Virginia, but one that has to be done
 nevertheless, he is doing what he always
 does-a conscientious job without fear of
 the consequences.
 Reasonable  and
 whatever political
 for it.

 persuasion admire him
 Correct Approach
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ROMAN C. PUCINSKI
 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, March 22, 1966
 Mr. PUCINSKI.  Mr.  Speaker,  the
 Chicago Daily News comments editori-
 ally on the thesis that while contain-
 ment of Red China is essential, it would
 be desirable to end China's isolation from
 the family of mankind.
 The paper believes:
 The reexamination of American policy is
 all to the good if it illuminates the difficul-
 ties standing in the way of a change In
 American-Chinese relations as well as the
 desirability of such a change.
 The editorial on "The Unreachable
 Dragon" sheds light on a timely matter
 of great concern to us all, and believing
 that others will want to peruse its con-
 tents, I offer the article for inclusion in
 the RECORD :
 THE UNREACHABLE DRAGON
 But to do either would mean abandoning
 the Nationalist Chinese on Formosa, whose
 cause we have espoused since the Commu-
 nist takeover on the mainland.  Even if, in
 the  long  run,  Nationalist  China  should
 weaken in its contention that it is the law-
 ful ruler of all China, there is no sign that
 Peking will abandon Its claim to Formosa.
 - It is  this  issue,  more than any other,
 that has isolated Red China.  In the periodic
 Warsaw talks between representatives of the
 United States and Red China, nothing of
 substance is talked about because Peking
 sets as a precondition our abandonment of
 the Chiang Kai-shek government on For-
 mosa.  In short, the isolation of Red China
 is largely of Peiping's own making, and Mao
 seems to prefer it that way.
 There is, in fact, much internal benefit
 to Peking in its hostility toward the United
 States.  As long as the people can be per-
 suaded that the United States is a mortal
 enemy, the Government has a lever for mak-
 ing them work harder to build up the Com-
 munist state.  A show of friendship on the
 part of the United States clearly calls for
 fast rebuttal such as that directed at Vice
 President HUMPHREY.
 The reexamination of American policy is
 all to the good if it illuminates the difil-
 culties standing in the way of a change in
 American-Chinese relations as well as the
 desirability of such a change.  But it is hard-
 ly a time for believing that a few kind words
 or simply wishing for better relations will
 bring them about.
 (IN
 The Question of Vietnam
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. LESTER L. WOLFF
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 . Tuesday, March 22, 1966
 Mr. WOLFF.                                                          Mr. Speaker, I would
 like to include in the RECORD the follow-
 ing article on Vietnam which appeared
 in the February 4, 1966, issue of the
 Weekly Nation, one of the foremost mag-
 azines of the Philippines. It presents a
 view of the Vietnamese conflict from a
 nation that has long been a stanch
 friend.
 The article follows:
 It is still uncertain whether the reexami-
 nation of U.S. policy toward Red China fore-
 shadows a shift in that policy.  Some shift
 of emphasis is evident, however, in the atten-
 tion paid the hearings last week before the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and in
 the weekend statements. of Vice President
 HUMPHREY.  HUMPHREY appeared at least to
 adopt the thesis that while containment of
 Red China is essential, it would be desirable
 to end China's isolation from the "family of
 mankind."
 Peking's answer was prompt and ugly.
 The Communist Party publication Jenmin
 Jih Pao said HUMPHREY offered a "kiss of
 Judas" that "cannot fail to disgust the Chi-
 nese people."
 This exchange should dispel any illusions
 that Red China is ripe for offers of friend-
 ship, or that dealing with Peking on any
 rational terms will be easy.  The reasons for
 treating Mao Tse-tung and his crowd as out-
 laws are still valid, and underlined by every
 move and statement Peking makes.
 But  an  outlaw that      already  has  some
 nuclear capability and is rapidly expanding
 In that field cannot be ignored.  If it is true
 that the United States and Red China are on
 a collision course, a change of course by one
 or the other or both is imperative.
 While the experts differ on how to "con-
 tain"  China,  there  is essential agreement
 that this phase of our effort is correct.  The
 main drive for a shift of course on our part
 will come, then, as it applies to isolating Red
 China.  The suggestion Is increasingly heard
 that we welcome Peiping into the United Na-
 tions, and perhaps work toward diplomatic
 recognition of the Communist regime.
 THE QUESTION OF VIETNAM
 (By O. S. Villadolid)
 (NoTE.-We have chosen the path of help-
 ing an ally fight in a war that is as much to
 the interest of the Philippines as it is to the
 free world.    The alternative, which is to dis-
 engage completely from the Vietnam conflict,
 is unthinkable.)
 "As far as I am concerned," said President
 Marcos last week, "the Philippines is already
 involved in the war in Vietnam."
 The view of the President represents one
 side.  The other side, shared by exponents
 of noninvolvement in the "dirty" war next
 door, maintains the  fine distinction that
 Filipinos are merely engaged in humanitarian
 efforts and warns that dispatch of combat
 engineers  will  automatically  Involve  the
 Philippines in the Vietnam war.
 In a Very real sense, President Marcos up-
 holds a point of view which commonsense
 dictates.  This can best be illustrated by
 the case of a Filipino 'aid. official last year in
 Vietnam who, caught by the Vietcong guer-
 rillas during a raid, raised his hands in sur-
 render and asked that his life be spared
 because he was engaged in humanitarian
 work.
 "I am a Filipino," he was reported to have
 said.   But the Vietcong raiders shot him
 just the same.  His body was found riddled
 with bullets-and his throat slit.
 NO EXCEPTION
 This is the grim reality of any war, and
 Vietnam is not an exception.  While many
 of us would wish to think that our "no-
 involvement"  In Vietnam  could  save  our
 men, the ugly reality is that men and na-
 tions on opposite sides of the ideological
 fence are locked in a bitter, desperate strug-
 gle in Vietnam for supremacy in Asia. It is
 a war where the doctrine of Mao Tse-tung's
 "protracted struggle" through wars of na-
 tional liberation is meeting its severest test,
 the outcome of which holds untold conse-
 quences for the remaining free countries in
 the Asian rimland and in southeast Asia.  It
 is not difficult to imagine what the stakes
 are.  Vietnam, a chunk of the former French
 colony of Indochina, forms an indispensable
 part of the rice bowl of Asia.  It has, for
 centuries,  been the gateway to    southeast
 Asia, where conquering armies, the most re-
 cent being the Japanese, passed to bring
 Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philip-
 pines and the Pacific islands near Australia
 down to their knees.  With its archipelagoes,
 southeast Asia abounds with rich natural
 resources which any ambitious nation must
 covet  to  hold  power.   Geographically,  its
 strategic importance cannot be overlooked.
 For it dominates the gateway between the
 Pacific and Indian Oceans, flanking the In-
 dian subcontinent on one side and Australia
 and New Zealand on the other.     Indeed, the
 loss of southeast Asia to communism would
 upset the balance of power against the free
 world in this area.  And South Vietnam's
 loss would not only make defense of the
 rest  of  southeast Asia  very  costly  but
 unmanageable.
 REPERCUSSIONS OF FALL
 The      Importance  of  South  Vietnam  to
 Philippine national security can best be
 appreciated in the light of the assessment of
 the  recently  concluded chiefs of mission
 conference.  The envoys agreed that Philip-
 pine defenses against communism would be
 weakened by South Vietnam's fall, that a
 Communist victory in that area would en-

 Bicentennial Anniversary of Declaration
 of Independence
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. CARLTON R. SICKLES
 OF MARYLAND
 N THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 24, 1966
 ivlr. SICKLES.  Mr. Speaker, I would
 like to call to the attention of my col-
 leagies a resolution adopted at the 1965
 convention  of  the   Communications
 Workers of America to plan for bicen-
 tennial observations of the signing of
 the Declaration of Independence.
 t feel that the interest of the Com-
 munications Workers in planning a fit-
 ting commemoration of this important
 landmark in our  Nation's  history de-
 scrves our attention.
 The resolution follows:
 ILESO:.UTION 27A-65-18, BICENTENNIAL ANNI-
 V':A..ARY OF DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
 The signing of the Declaration of Inde-
 pend(mce on July 4, 1776, not only marked a
 turning point in the history of the Nation
 which has since become the United States
 of America, but it also marked a decisive
 :and dramatic moment in the history of the
 autirr:: world.
 IT.,) ringing words of this famed document
 signaled the call to areas which led to the
 t mnding of a new and great nation.  It also
 rounded the death knell for the long era
 of colonial expansion in the Western Hem-
 lsphere  by the nations  of  Europe.   Even
 today, the historical process begun on July 4,
 1,776,  is continuing in other parts of the
 world where old colonial structures are crum-
 bling and new and dynamic countries are
 being born.
 In :a few years we will have reached the
 200th anniversary of the signing of the Dec-
 lam tion of Independence.  It would be fit-
 ting that the year 1976 be devoted to a year-
 lime Observation of the bicentennial a.nni-
 versuiy of this important date in world his-
 tory.
 Lik: the Magna Carta, the Declaration of
 independence is a document revered through-
 out the world.  We would do well to show the
 world that its words are deeply honored to-
 lay in the Nation in which it was signed
 ueariy 2 centuries ago.
 'Uiiii Nation recently gave impressive ob-
 ;ervation to the centennial anniversary of
 the Civil War.  Countless new histories and
 atudi(s of this period were published. Battles
 were  reenacted. Fitting    ceremonies  were
 held  at  such  places  as  Gettysburg   and
 'lpporlattox.
 These   observations,   which   were  well
 )1annad and coordinated, made an important
 contribution to our awareness and under-
 :;Landing of that chapter in  our Nation's
 histary.
 A carefully planned bicentennial observa-
 iaon of the signing of the Declaration of In-
 depen2ence could serve a similar and equally
 important function,  reminding the entire
 world of the Nation's revolutionary heritage
 .iirough which our freedom was won and our
 nationhood was established.
 pend'ix
 The full-scale observation of this 200th
 anniversary will. require much study and
 preparation. Although the  anniversary is
 still 11 years off, It is by no means too early
 to begin laying the groundwork for its ob-
 servation: Therefore be it
 Resolved, That this 1965 convention of the
 Communications Workers of America urges
 that plans and study begin as soon as pos-
 sible to prepare for the 200th anniversary of
 the signing of the Declaration of Independ-
 ence.
 CWA firmly believes a nationwide campaign
 to win congressional approval for the estab-
 lishment of a commission to undertake this
 important project is in order.
 As loyal, patriotic, and proud Americans,
 the members of this union pledge themselves
 to play their part In such a program so that
 this important historical anniversary will re-
 ceive the honor it so richly deserves.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JAMES KEE
 OF WEST VIRGINIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 24, 2966
 Mr. K:EE. Mr. Speaker, Senator ROB-
 ERT  C.  BYRD  of  West  Virginia,  distin-
 guished himself during his service in the
 U.S. House of Representatives, and fol-
 lowing his election to the U.S. Senate,
 he has proved himself to be one of the
 most effective Senators ever produced by
 the State of West Virginia.
 He is one of the most progressive sen-
 ators ever to honor our home State in
 the august Chamber of the other body.
 His performance as chairman of the
 Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for
 the District of Columbia has been the
 most outstanding leadership ever af-
 forded to the residents of our Nation's
 Capital.  Yet, it blind and unthinking
 minority has felt complete unrestraint
 in launching vicious attacks against this
 outstanding, hardworking, and brilliant
 man.
 The People of West Virginia., however,
 as I am sure is the case with the major-
 ity of the residents of the ]District of
 Columbia, recognize the unjustness of
 these attacks against BOB BYRD as eVf-
 denced by an editorial which appeared
 in the March 21, 1966, issue of the Sun-
 set News-Observer of my home city of
 Bluefield, W. Va.
 Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I wish to share
 with the Members of the Congress this
 editorial, which recognizes the stature of
 this dedicated statesman:
 BYRD, SNCC, AND CLERGY
 We have commented in this space before
 about the problems West Virginia's Demo-
 cratio Senator RoeERT C. BYRD has encoun-
 tered in his position as chairman of the U.S.
 Senate's Appropriations  Subcommittee  on
 the District of Columbia.
 Recently he has been having new troubles
 in this thankless job.  Because of his long
 and effective effort to clean up welfare abuses
 in the Nation's Capital, he is being viciously
 attacked and vilified by leaders of the "Free
 D.C. Movement," an activity of the Student
 Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC
 for short, which seeks home rule for the Dis-
 trict.
 A scurrilous handbill has been distribuaed
 by this group against Senator BYRD, Con-
 gressman JOHN W. MCMILLAN, of South Caro-
 lina, and a figure labeled "D.C. Power Struc-
 ture."  The three are pictured pulling chains
 tightly about the neck of a Negro figure.
 "Who keeps D.C. In chains?" the inflamma-
 tory poster asks.  BYRD is accused in its text
 of "keeping children hungry" and sending
 welfare investigators into homes "in the mid-
 dle of the night violating the rights of our
 women."
 What the Senator has done among many
 other things, of course, Is to crack down on
 the practice of some women of bearing ilie-
 gitimate children as a means of gaining ad-
 ditional welfare payments.
 For this and his other cleanup efforts he
 has also been bitterly arsailed in so-called
 liberal newspaper and magazine articles, he
 has been threatened by pickets and demon-
 strators, and, we are sorry to say, denounced
 by some clergymen.
 He hasn't backed up an inch.  Instead he
 has gone on the offensive against his at-
 tackers.  In a recent statement on the floor
 of the Senate he said leaders in the Free
 D.C. Movement indicate that "a campaign of
 extortion, intimidation, and coercion will be
 leveled against  all businessmen and mer-
 chants-large and small, Negro and white-
 who refuse to sign the (mayor-council form
 of government) petition and place cold cash
 in the hands of the committee."
 Leaders of SNCC are seeking $100,000 for
 their war chest and have threatened a boy-
 cott of all stores and businesses that won't
 contribute or go along with their plans.
 In  other  words,  BYRD  said,  "while  the
 leaders of this movement speak of the right
 to vote, they publicly deny the Individual
 merchant's right to his own opinion about
 home rule."  This  threat,  he  added,  "is
 ominously reminiscent of Los Angeles."
 Noting that SNCC charges the District has
 "lousy schools," BYRD said It chooses to say
 nothing of the 27,689 windowpanes smashed
 in D.C. schools by rock throwers last year, the
 replacement  of which  cost  the  taxpayers
 $1:12,868.
 But  what    should  "cause  serious   soul
 searching," the Senator said, "is the sup-
 port given to such an irresponsible, ques-
 tionable, and dangerous movement by cer-
 tain members of the clergy."
 He referred specifically to a statement in
 the press which quoted Suffragen Episcopal
 Bishop Paul Moore, Jr., as saying he was
 "sorry that this kind of militancy is neces-
 sary," but that all other means of dealing
 with the problem had failed.
 "In other words," BYRD commented, "you
 Ile what he directs or he will apply militancy
 tactics.   This  does  not  sound  like  the
 religious  leadership, understanding,    and
 tolerance that give significance to our Chris-
 tian inheritance."
 The demand for $100,000 from D.C. stores
 with the threat of an economic boycott "con-

 free way of life and the Communist Ideology
 in Vietnam."
 What the Philippines will finally give to
 South Vietnam as expanded assistance is a
 big question.  The South Vietnamese Gov-
 ernment has a year-old request for an engi-
 neer battalion with its own security support
 involving  2,000 men.   But  Senator  Jovito
 Salonga, back from a trip to South Vietnam,
 announced a desire of Saigon's head of state,
 Lt. Gen. Nguyen Van Thieu, for more medical
 and civic action teams.  In this light, Presi-
 dent Marcos has correctly decided to send a
 Philippine  survey  mission  to Vietnam to
 ascertain what the Saigon government really
 needs from the Philippines in the anti-
 Communist struggle.
 CAMPAIGN DAMPENED
 Dispatch of the mission has dampened a
 well-organized campaign here of misinforma-
 tion against the sending of any form of addi-
 tional assistance to the beleaguered South
 Vietnamese.  Charging that the administra-
 tion had a commitment with the United
 States to send combat troops, outspoken ad-
 vocates of noninvolvement, most of whom are
 pressing for neutralism in foreign policy here,
 said President Marcos was doing the bidding
 of the "dirty American imperialists" to fight
 in the "senseless American war."  "The Mar-
 cos administration finds itself locked be-
 tween the horns of a dilemma," proclaims
 the propaganda line of the neutralists.  They
 argued  that  Mr.  Marcos'     dilemma   was
 "whether to send some 2,000 combat en-
 gineers to Vietnam and so please the Ameri-
 cans that they will readily provide this coun-
 try with a badly needed stabilization loan,
 or refuse to do so and incur the displeasure
 of the Americans."  This line conveniently
 obscures the fact that the South Vietnamese
 themselves have not asked for combat troops
 from the Philippines, but merely engineers
 who would help in repairing broken bridges,
 destroyed schoolhouses and construction of
 various public works projects vital to the
 civic-action phase of the anti-Communist
 campaign.
 The resort to obscurantism is not without
 basis.  The idea is to secure early polarization
 on the hazardous Vietnam problem.  By in-
 sisting, through false representations, that
 Philippine combat troops have been promised
 on pressure from the United States to with-
 hold economic assistance, the. neutralists had
 hoped to draw severe public reaction to their
 cause of preventing any dispatch of addi-
 tional help to the South Vietnamese.  The
 maneuver aimed to bring back memories of
 parity, in which Filipinos, economically pros-
 trate after World War II, allowed their con-
 stitution to be amended giving Americans
 equal share in the exploitation of their na-
 tional patrimony.  To bolster public hatred,
 the proneutralists went even to the extent
 of utilizing a top secret document containing
 the working draft of the chiefs of mission
 conference 4 weeks ago to mislead the public
 into believing that even those in the high
 echelons of government oppose the sending
 of combat troops to South Vietnam.  Mis-
 labeling the working. draft as a preliminary
 report to the President, the proneutralists
 insisted  on  the existence  of a consensus
 against troop commitments.   Actually, the
 consensus was in favor of expanding Philip-
 pine assistance to Vietnam and that if con-
 gress should decide on sending troops, the
 Philippines must shoulder their keep to up-
 hold national dignity.
 CORRECT PERSPECTIVE
 The report of the survey mission to visit
 South Vietnam is expected to set in correct
 perspective the debate raging on the burning
 question of combat troops.  It is not impos-
 sible that the Saigon Government, as con-
 tended by Senator Salonga, will now prefer
 additional medical and civic action teams
 from the Philippines.  If this should happen,
 there will be little argument even in the
 Senate where the sentiment is overwhelm-
 ingly in favor of technical and economic as-
 sistance.  The pro-neutralists will, naturally,
 complain for it is their goal to prevent the
 sending of any form of assistance to the
 South Vietnamese.  But a real problem will
 arise if the Saigon Government should in-
 sist on troop commitments, even on a token
 basis.  It will arise not so much from a desire
 to concentrate on noncombatants, but from
 the lack of funds with which to support
 an expenditionary force.  It is possible that
 the Philippines will allow the United States
 to bear the expenses, as she did during the
 Korean war and in the Congo action.  But
 the inhibiting factor is that both actions
 were under the  auspices  of the  United
 Nations.
 This, then, is the dilemma for the Philip-
 pines on Vietnam.  For we have chosen the
 path of helping an ally fight a war that is as
 much to the national interest of the Philip-
 pines as it is to the free world.  The alterna-
 tive is, of course,'unthinkable.  It is to dis-
 engage completely from the Vietnam con-
 flict and avoid any involvement whatsoever.
 This will mean that the government shall
 have changed one of its basic postulates in
 foreign policy: commitment to the cause of
 anti-communism.  It is a situation furthest
 from  the  thinking  of  President  Marcos.
 "What threatens humanity in another area,"
 he said during his inaugural, "threatens our
 society as well," He added:    "We cannot,
 therefore, merely contemplate the risks of
 our country without coming into any de-
 cision on our own.   Wherever there is a
 sight for freedom we cannot remain aloof

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. ROBERT B. DUNCAN
 OF OREGON
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 24, 1966
 Mr.                               DUNCAN   of   Oregon.  Mr.
 Speaker, our Nation's land and water re-
 sources offer abundant economic oppor-
 tunities if properly developed.                                                                                                           Recog-
 nition of this has been reflected in much
 of the conservation legislation passed by
 the Congress in this decade.
 Resource development in my congres-
 sional district in Oregon is a good exam-
 ple.  The Upper Willamette resource
 conservation and development project is
 one of the first 20 such projects to be
 carried out as a result of legislation in
 1962.
 The Oregon project covers 3 million
 acres in four counties.  It has opened
 many avenues for communities in the
 area to develop unexplored potentials of
 their land and water resources.  The
 products of land-use adjustments, forest
 land  improvement,  and  changes  in
 cropping patterns will lead to the need
 for new manufacturing and processing
 enterprises.   Expansion  of recreation
 facilities, development of agricultural
 and municipal water supply, enhance-
 ment of wildlife, and protection of the
 area from crippling and costly floods will
 improve economic opportunities.
 I have been close to this project as the
 local people have planned it.  I have
 A1703
 visited the area and talked to the local
 people. Their interest has been beyond
 expectation.  The project has brought
 public and private agencies and local
 people together for a common purpose,
 and they have each contributed to
 planning the project.  They now look
 forward to making the plans a reality,
 with each doing his part. -
 Stimulated by the enthusiasm of work-
 ing out the plan, local people have al-
 ready started many projects that require
 no Federal cost sharing and some that
 require only a small amount of technical
 help.  I understand that the other 19
 resource conservation and development
 projects have created this same kind of
 enthusiasm, with people going ahead on
 their own before the program actually
 got underway.  Just the act of getting
 together and bringing out the potentials
 of the area has given them new life and
 new hope.
 The concentration of conservation and
 development activities of all the public
 and private agencies and the local peo-
 ple has promoted closer working rela-
 tionships among them. It has also served
 to inform communities of what assist-
 ance is available and how programs of
 the various levels of Government fit to-
 gether.
 I believe this group approach is an
 especially effective tool to resource de-
 velopment.  It enables local people, by
 their own initiative, to make full use of
 their resources.  It gives support to the
 concept that local people should be the
 mainstay of such an undertaking.
 The Upper Willamette project is spon-
 sored by six of the local soil conserva-
 tion districts, which are locally formed
 and managed units of State government.
 It is an endeavor in which towns and
 cities and rural people are participating.
 When completed, the area expects a $15
 million a year increase in their economy,
 with more than 200 new businesses in
 the area.
 The door has been opened. These peo-
 ple are showing what can be done with
 a little help.  They have my support.

 The unanimous vote of 39 Governors at-

 tions Committee's intensive examination of
 that policy with support strengthened,  if
 anything.

 Such a conclusion is further buttressed
 by  the  latest  public  opinion  poll  which
 showed more than '( to 1 approving the Presi-
 dent's actions.
 At the White House conference, the Gover-
 uors were briefed on the current Vietnam sit-
 uation by Mr. Johnson, Secretary of State
 husk, Defense Secretary McNamara, and mili-
 tary leaders.  Utah's Governor Rampton, who
 was present, described the briefing as thor-
 ough and frank, and he said he was heart-
 ened to learn "the picture in Vietnam is a
 ant better than when we were here 8 months
 l,o..,
 That is heartening news, although it must
 tie tempered with the knowledge that the
 lighting continues viciously and costly, with
 no reason to hope that the end is in sight.
 But while public debate of American policy
 rotative to Vietnam is fully justified when
 the debate ends, it is well to close ranks in
 the face of any enemy all too ready to inter-
 pret debate in terms of indecision and weak-
 nerS.
 Besides, there is work to be done in Wash-

 Leader MANSFIELD report that after the weeks
 of debate. Congress is now "getting into the

 HON. JAMES H. (JIMMY) QUILLEN
 RW TENNESSEE
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, liiarch 24, 1966
 Mr. QUILLEN.  Mr. Speaker, on March
 1.0 of this year, the Department of Agri-
 culture held a referendum to determine
 the standards for tobacco allotments for
 1966.
 The tobacco growers in my district and
 in the State of Tennessee voted over-
 whelmingly against the acreage-pound-
 age program, advocated by the Depart-
 ment of Agriculture.
 Because of their negative vote, which
 I wholeheartedly supported, most of the
 tobacco growers will now receive a 15-
 vercent reduction in acreage, which they
 (lid  not  want..   The  tobacco farmers
 would have preferred that the standards
 remain the same as they were for 1965.
 I do not feel that any cut is justified,
 and   the  Department  of  Agriculture
 should leave the allotments as they are.
 I ant hopeful that, in the future, we
 can prevent the Department of Agricul-
 Lure                from  blackmailing  our  tobacco
 ;;rowers by supposedly giving them a
 choice, but in actuality, forcing them to
 Lake a, stand that can do nothing but
 hurt them.
 I: insert at this point in the RECORD two
 editorials, commenting on the meaning
 of this vote:
 I From the Knoxville (Teen.) Journal, Mar.
 he, 19661
 BLOW FOR FREEDOM
 l;urley tobacco growers emphatically re-
 jected in their vote this week it proposal by
 ,lie Department of Agriculture that would
 have substituted acreage-poundage limita-
 tion for the plan long in use under which
 f. rowers were free to market all the leaf they
 were able to raise on a fixed acreage allot-
 ment.
 Having rejected the Federal agency's acre-
 a.ge-poundage  proposal, most  growers will
 now face a 15-percent reduction in acreage.
 The vote of the burley growers will be in-
 terpreted by some of us, at least, as striking
 a blow for freedom to the extent that this Is
 possible under any federally imposed mar-
 keting control plan.  Individual enterprise,
 which is to say the quality and skill devoted
 to the production of it burley crop, will con.-
 tinue to be the main factors in determining
 the profitability of each grower's crop.
 Incidentally, a factor in this election was
 that a substantial number of growers already
 have only the minimum acreage allotment
 so that they will not be affected by the 15-
 percent cut proclaimed by the Department of
 Agriculture.
 I From  the  Johnson  City  (Tenn.)  Prcus-
 Chronicle, Mar. 1.3, 1966]
 QUITE A MESSAGE
 Tennessee tobacco growers put on a display
 of  independence last Thursday   by voting
 against the acreage-poundage program while
 growers of L2 other States were voting for it.
 So overwhelming was the anti sentiment
 in Tennessee that it swung the balance over-
 all, and acreage-poundage failed to get the
 two-thirds majority it had to have.
 T entucky  tobacco  leaders  are  reported
 stunned, and some are saying grower:      In
 our  State  have  "cut  their  own throats."
 'they may have, at that, since many now
 face a slash of 15 percent on their acreage
 allowances.  Yet in rebelling against the idea
 of having poundage as well as acreage con-
 trolled, Tennessee growers undoubtedly were
 showing  their weariness  over  controls in
 general. And  in doing    that, they  have
 achieved some personal satisfaction if noth-
 ing else.
 Acreage-poundage  may  have  been  just
 what the doctor ordered, but the individual
 farmer in Tennessee is chafing tinder the
 doctor's continued ordering and prescribing
 without being requested to do so by the
 patient.  That, we think, is the meaning of
 the heavy negative vote (6 to 1), and we
 hope the message gets through.
 Meanwhile, the  efforts  of  all  concerned
 should be directed toward. making the pres-
 ent program work.  If changes are needed,
 there will be another day and another vote
 and another decision.  That is the American
 Way.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. PAUL A. FINO
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIV ES
 Thursday, March 24, 1966
 Mr. FINO. Mr. Speaker, today I in-
 troduced legislation to require local pub-
 lic housing agencies to :ignore certain in-
 come in computing income levels  and
 resultant rent levels for tenants in fed-
 erally aided public housing projects.
 This bill would require local public
 housing agencies to exclude from ten-
 ants' income such part of any govern-
 mental pension increase-Federal, State,
 and local pensions---which the agency
 shall find to represent a cost-of-living
 increase, as well as such income as the
 tenant family spends for medicare cov-
 erage.
 One of the greatest difficulties in pub-
 lie housing today is the continual re-
 adjustment of tenants' rent levels based
 on changing income levels.  Each time a
 tenant's income goes up, his rent must
 go up.
 This is particularly unfair as regards
 the many old people in public housing
 who live on small social security and
 other pensions.  When these people re-
 ceive a small pension boost, it is often to
 cover a rise in the cost of living or the
 expense of a new program like medicare.
 This type of pension hike should not be
 gobbled up in increased public housing
 rents.
 My bill provides that the contract be-
 tween the Federal Public Housing Ad-
 ministration and the local public hous-
 ing agency must provide that in calcu-
 lating tenants' income, and rentals based
 thereon, the public housing agency must
 omit the amount spent for medicare cov-
 erage and also that part of any pension
 increase which the agency shall find as
 corresponding to a rise in the cost of
 living.
 Government pensioners living on small
 fixed pension incomes have it hard
 enough in these inflationary days with-
 out having to see any cost-of-living pen-
 sion hike they get eaten up by rent boosts.
 My bill would keep cost-of-living pension
 hikes and boosts to cover medicare ex-
 penses from being counted in income so
 as to cause public housing rent rises. I
 think that this exclusion is in the true
 spirit of the public housing program.

 SOME IDEAS ARE UNREAL
 By Dumitru Danfelopol)
 WASHINGTON.-When  I listen  to  George
 F. Kennan and Senators FULDRIGHT, MORSE,
 CHURCH,                              and  ROBERT KENNEDY, I wonder
 if they live on the same planet, if they have
 seen this 20th-century world in which we
 toil.
 Let's concentrate on Kennan. His views
 expressed before the Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee make me wonder if he has found
 an island or an ivory tower where facts and
 events never intrude on his philosophical
 notions of communism.
 Here is an example of Kennan's view:; on
 Cuba, taken from the record of the hearings:
 "Mr. KENNAN. A great many Americans are
 concerned,  for  example,  about  Castro  in
 Cuba, and at times they have had good rea-
 sons to be, and I do not for a moment un-
 derestimate the seriousness of the crisis; we
 faced there some years ago.
 "But it does seem to me that we must care-
 fully stack up our advantages against our
 disadvantages in these situations.  For the
 first time in a long, long time, someone else
 pays the bills in Cuba, someone else is get-
 ting milked, someone else has the problems of
 dealing with the Cuban regime.  For once we
 can sit back and personally I do not think
 the Russians are going to have any great
 satisfaction out of their involvement in Cuba
 over the long run.

 that Greece might still be free," lived on
 to inspire the Greeks to continue their
 fight for freedom.
 The years between 1821, when the
 struggle began, and 1827, toward the close
 of the war, were marked by a series of
 both victories and defeats for the Greeks.
 Finally, on October 20, 1827, the Brit-
 ish, French, and Russian fleets inter-
 vened in the Bay of Navarino and dealt
 a crushing blow to the Ottoman naval
 power. Sixty out of 89 Turkish-Egyptian
 vessels were destroyed, the Greeks seized
 the initiative, and the tide was turned
 irreversibly in their favor.
 Although the Battle of Navarino made
 the independence of Greece a certainty
 the fighting continued for another 2
 years and almost 5 years elapsed before
 the new state took shape.  In 1832 the
 Treaty of Constantinople was signed,
 and with the signing of this treaty, the
 Turks renounced their claims and recog-
 nized Greek independence.
 The Greek ideal of democracy, born in
 ancient Greece over 2,000 years ago, once
 more prevailed, and Greece took her
 rightful place among the free nations of
 the world.
 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to participate
 in the 145th observance of this significant
 event, and wish to express my admiration
 for the indomitable courage of the
 Greeks and to pay tribute to them for
 their enduring and universal contribu-
 tions to civilization.
 Informed Attack on Grain Dumping
 Earlier this year President Johnson had
 occasion to tell Congress that under present
 law the Secretary of Agriculture "must dis-
 pose of all stocks of agricultural commodities
 as rapidly as possible, consistent with orderly
 marketing procedures."
 It is obviously inconsistent with orderly
 marketing procedure to dump Government-
 owned grain on the market in quantities so
 huge as to cause prices to drop.  That would
 seem to indicate the Department of Agricul-
 ture is guilty of flouting the law.
 It would also indicate that when supply
 and  demand  forces  in  the      marketplace
 dictate corn prices higher than the Govern-
 ment thinks they should be, it is just too
 bad. The real dictation comes from Wash-
 ington.

 Mr. SHIPLEY.  Mr.  Speaker,  the

 American general as saying that if we
 should abandon our commitment to
 South Vietnam, we will "face more Viet-
 nams in Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia,
 Australia, and New Zealand."
 The paper adds:
 "This is not a battle for hills and moun-
 tains, towns and rivers.  The battlefield is
 the people."
 And this has imposed a dreadful ordeal on
 the people of South Vietnam.  They are the
 ones who bear the brunt of the kidnaping,
 extortion and terror inflicted by the 100,000
 guerrillas who supplement the 50,000 hard-
 core Red troops in South Vietnam.
 These sorely beset South Vietnamese plead
 for our protection. We are giving them all we
 can.  They want schools and hospitals.  We
 are responding.  And, says Krulak, "little by
 little we have won their confidence"
 If the United States now were to pull out
 of Vietnam, as some insist we should, this
 painfully won confidence would be shattered.
 Throughout southeast Asia, if this un-
 thinkable and unlikely retreat were to take
 place, it would indicate to friends and foes
 alike that we cannot be trusted.
 General Krulak has incisively explained
 why we must stand and fight.

 Mr. MOELLER.  Mr. Speaker, I think
 my colleagues will be interested in a
 Washington Star editorial hailing the
 value of HEW Secretary Gardner's visit
 to Vietnam.
 The mission reflects "an awareness
 that something more than success on the
 battlefield is needed," the Star believes,
 and it quotes one general as having said:
 We could kill the last Vietcong guerrilla
 and still lose the war unless the people can
 see something worth living and striving for.
 The Star adds:
 The Gardner mission should be appraised
 in this spirit, as a token of our good faith
 in pledging that we will do what we can to
 make certain that, after the fighting is over,
 there will be something worth living for in
 Vietnam.
 The editorial, on this subject of such
 vital concern to us all, is offered for pub-
 lication in the RECORD-where it may be
 read in its entirety:
 MR. GARDNER'S MISSION
 This week's  arrival  in Saigon of  HEW
 Secretary Gardner with a team of 22 spe-
 cialists adds more than lipservice to the an-
 nounced intention of the United States to
 rehabilitate  South  Vietnam's war-stricken
 civilian economy.  It suggests that the fine
 words which followed the President's meeting
 in Honolulu with Vietnamese officials will be
 followed by action.
 The rehabilitation program looks toward
 the  provision  of such  things  as  schools,
 Clinics, hospitals, better sanitation facilities,
 and the like.   Something is being done in
 these areas now, more perhaps than is gen-
 erally known.                                                                                                                                            But the big part of the job
 remains to be done, and the importance of
 getting it done should not be underestimated.
 This train of events would put aggressive
 communism  much  closer to  the Western
 World.
 The officer quoted by the paper, Lt.
 Gen. Victor H. Krulak, replies to the
 question, "Why are we in Vietnam?" and
 because his answers seem pertinent, I
 have permission that the article to which
 I hate referred be included, in its en-

 Cure for Crisis of Credibility

 tlr. RUMSFELD.   Mr. Speaker, the
 only cure for today's crisis in credibility
 concerning    Government   information
 would be a little more candor on the part
 of Federal Government. officials.
 The ideal of "truth-in-Government"
 would  be  hastened  immeasurably   by
 passage of a public records law by the
 Congress.  The presence of such a law
 would give Government officials an ex-
 cuse for being less devious in their in-

 that the Johnson administration isn't level-
 ing with the public.
 Flee "oh, yeah?" and "since when?" re-
 sponses to presidential utterances are pro-
 liferating in an embarrassing way.  So em-
 barrassing, in tact. that White House staff
 members are inquiring into the scope of
 and reasons for this skeptical phenomenon..
 ITN. Ambassador Arthur Goldberg is the
 father of the thought that the credibility or
 Johnson policies on peace in Vietnam was in
 question.  There was, the Ambassador frank-
 ly admitted in explaining the vigor of the
 question.  There was, the Ambassador frank-
 ly admitted in explaining the vigor of the
 quest for peace, a question about the credi-
 bility of U.S. eagerness for negotiation which
 had to be answered-
 Perhaps the word credibiilty in connec-
 ti.on with what President Johnson says and,
 does is not precise.  Devious may be a, bet-
 ter word. or any other word that conveys
 the impression of artful aims not fully ex-
 posed, or a constructive coloration on un-
 pleasant events, or simply the telling of part
 truths in  the pursuit of masked purposes,
 it is possible to recite at length instances
 wherein what Johnson says might he con-
 ;;idered at variance with what he does.  There
 was no visible resemblance between what the
 White House was saying about aluminum
 and steel price Increases and what President
 Johnon was doing about them.  Little be-
 lievahil:ity may have rung through his be-
 lated statements on the New York transit
 strike  and the inflationary effects of.  the
 wage settlement.  A dash of gullibiliry helps
 in swallowing his budget forecasts.
 But are the maneuvers and techniques of
 a President in getting 'what, he wan   to be
 judged by the standards, that his critics wish
 to impose?  By these standards all questions
 would be answered with complete frankness
 regardless of the consequences.  The simplest
 among uc could demand from the President
 the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
 the exposure of his purposes and methods in
 the most delicate of negotiations, as well as
 every  t?IOught  and  act  while  waking  or
 ;sleeping.
 These standards demand no floss 'use or
 diversions from White Reuse Press Secre-
 tary Bill D. Moyers, such. as not telling exactly
 what the President did or intends 1? do or
 not  responding  in  precisely  the  way  his
 questioner desires.
 Such. standards are obviously both   ilu'eal-
 istic and undesirable.  They are unrealistic
 because no President has ever operated that
 way, and undesirable because if he did he
 would then  frustrate justifiable aims and
 aometim,es the national interest,
 But, that really is not the question in the
 present  circumstances.  The  quest on  is
 whether or not the President's methods are
 so often devious and circuitous that  they
 arouse skepticism that he is headed where
 he says he is going or reveal where he has
 been.  It must be this that is of cone er:n at
 the White House, for it is not likel; that
 confidence in a President can be maittained
 at the highest level if his credibility  ;; con-
 tinuously in doubt.
 It is absurd to say that the Pre:;.dent's
 credibility has created any kind of crisis, or
 that he is in imminent danger of losing the
 confidence of the American people.  '.. Ius is
 familiar Washington talk, arising in large
 part from those who  disagree more  with
 what the President :has done, or may dc. than
 with what has been said.
 Johnson is not likely at his age to go
 through a reformation of the method; and
 techniques that kept him in command of the
 Senate for so many years,  He does depend
 upon a certain amount of naturally endowed
 flim-flarmnery that often enough meet,: with
 dazzling success, and other times falls flat.
 It would take very little to dispel  the
 Washington talk about a "crisis of credi-
 bility."  Just an ounce or two more of irank-
 n.ess and openness would help.  A return. to
 the preoperative Johnson when he saw and
 talked with many more people in various
 pursuits  outside the  official family  would
 be good.

 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. Speaker, tomorrow
 marks  the                                        145th  anniversary  of  the
 struggle for Greek independence.                                          The
 concepts of freedom and democracy giv-
 en birth in ancient Greece were the same
 goals of those valiant Greeks who, many
 centuries later, took up the cause of
 freedom against the hated repression
 of the Ottoman Empire.
 Our admiration for the courage and
 fortitude of the Greeks in response to
 Communist aggression in the hills after
 %1709
 World War II played a major role in the
 establishment of the North Atlantic
 Treaty Organization.  Greece is a valu-
 able and respected member.  Even now
 Greece's geographical promiximity to the
 Soviet Union serves as a constant re-
 minder of the struggle for freedom.
 The free world can never fully repay
 its debt to the values and ideals than, have
 come down to us from the Greek heri-
 tage.  Our repayment is made even more
 difficult because of the many contribu-
 tions that are being made to our Nation
 by the million and one-half Greek-Amer.-
 jeans,  They are active in the Common-
 wealth of Massachusetts in social, civic,
 cultural, and community enterprises;
 they are valued citizens and trusted
 neighbors.
 On the occasion of the 145th anraver-?
 sary of Greek independence, let us join
 in thanking our friends of Greek ances-
 try for their many contributions to our
 national life.

 OF ILLINOIS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATI\. ES
 Thursday, March 24, 1966
 M:r. ANNUNZIO.  Mr. Speaker, tomor-
 row, March 25, 1966, we commemorate
 the 145th anniversary of Greek inde-
 pendence from four centuries of oppres-
 sive rule under the Ottoman Turks
 Traditionally, March 25 is regarded as
 the day when a small band of patriots,
 under the leadership of Ypsilanti, struck
 the first blow for Greek liberty.  Because
 the Ottoman Turks greatly outnumbered
 the Greeks, Ypsilanti suffered an initial
 defeat, but the struggle continued both
 on land and on sea for 7 succeeding years.
 In the meantime, world evelits were
 gradually changing the balance in favor
 of the Greeks.  Such occurrences as the
 American and French Revolutions, the
 decline of the Ottoman Empire, the fall
 of Napoleon, the outbreak of national-
 istic revolutions in other countries such
 as Serbia, and most important of all, the
 awakening of a strong nationalistic feel-
 ing among the Greeks themselves
 served
 ,
 to give a cohesiveness to the Greek strug-
 gle and to rouse the sympathy and sup-
 port of Europeans and Americans alike.
 Among the Americans who took an ac-
 tive part in the Greek fight for freedom
 were Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, Gen.
 George Jarvis, Capt. Jonathan r'eckllam
 Miller, and Lt. William T. Washington,
 who lost his life in July 1827, Burin;i a
 factional outbreak.
 And, of course, it is fitting that, we
 remember here the contribution of Ens,-
 land's illustrious poet, Lord Byron, who
 went to Greece in 1824 to help the Greeks
 and who did much to popularize their
 cause.  Lord Byron finally lost his life
 from exposure, but his most important
 poem about the Greek struggle, in which
 he wrote the immortal line, "I dreamed

 a significant start cannot be made, and made
 now.
 Secretary Gardner's remarks upon arriving
 in Saigon suggest that he understands the
 real nature of the problem.  "Our presence
 here," he said, signals "a vital new phase" of
 the effort to improve Vietnamese health, wel-
 fare, and education programs.  "We are not
 here to provide overnight answers.  We are
 here to learn, to observe, to try to under-
 stand * * *   There will be many followup
 missions that will build on our findings."
 These comments, if one chooses, can be dis-
 missed as generalities.  But we think there is
 substance In them.  They reflect an aware-
 ness that something more than success on
 the battlefield is needed.  One general has
 put it this way: "We could kill the last Viet-
 cong guerrilla and still lose the war unless
 the people can see something worth living
 and striving for."
 The Gardner mission should be appraised
 in this spirit, as a token of our good faith in
 pledging that we will do what we can to make
 certain that, after the fighting is over, there
 will  be  something  Worth  living  for  in
 Vietnam.
 Resolute Washington
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ROBERT B. DUNCAN
 OF OREGON
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 24, 1966
 Mr. DUNCAN of Oregon.  Mr. Speak-
 er, the Christian Science Monitor has
 commented most favorably on the vote
 Congress gave the President to conduct
 the difficult yet honorable struggle in
 which the United States is engaged in
 Vietnam.
 The paper states:
 The size of the vote must have a salutary
 effect upon those abroad who of late may
 have been led to believe that there is greater
 opposition to the President's course than
 actually exists.
 It adds its approval to President John-
 son's renewed and urgent plea to "nego-
 tiate peace and let war stand aside while
 the  people  of  Vietnam  make their
 choice."
 With permission of my colleagues, I
 make   this editorial on a "Resolute
 Washington" available for the RECORD,
 where others may read it in its entirety:
 [From the Christian Science Monitor, Mar. 4,
 1986]
 RESOLUTE WASHINGTON
 The Senate  did the right  and sensible
 thing in resoundingly and overwhelmingly
 voting the $4.8 billion supplemental Viet-
 namese war budget (the House voted for it
 even more strongly) and in keeping the fa-
 mous Gulf of Tonkin resolution.  Although
 not all those who voted affirmatively support
 all aspects of America's military policy, the
 vote gave the President the backing he needs
 to conduct resolutely the difficult, thankless,
 yet honorable struggle in which the United
 States Is engaged.
 The size of the vote must have a salutary
 effect upon those abroad who of late may
 have been led to believe that there is greater
 opposition to the President's  course than
 actually exists.   Things are thus back In
 somewhat better perspective.
 At the same time we welcome with equal
 warmth President Johnson's renewed and
 urgent plea to "negotiate peace and let war
 stand  aside, while the people of Vietnam
 make their choice."  We also say bravo to
 the  President's  reiteration  that  America
 would stand by the outcome of any freely
 held election.
 As we discuss in the editorial immediately
 following, we hope that there is a growing
 realization on the Communists' part that
 they cannot now hope to win the war in
 Vietnam.  Negotiations must someday come.
 And, frankly, we do not we how they are
 likely to come on better terms or at a more
 favorable moment for the Communists than
 today.  Moscow knows this.  Peking may be
 realizing it.  Why not Hanoi?
 If such a Communist change is possible,
 might this not eventually lead to a serious
 study of the latest proposal from Senator
 FULBRIGHT, who suggests an agreement with
 Communist China for the neutralization of
 all southeast Asia?  It is hard to think of
 any achievement which would draw wider
 and deeper sighs of relief, from the world
 than this.
 Yet it would be naive to underestimate
 the difficulties In the path of such an ac-
 cord.  Neutralization would have to be un-
 derwritten by foolfast guarantees.  It would
 require that both Communist China and the
 local Communist Parties end all armed at-
 tempts to change the status quo. It would
 necessitate that the Communists also end
 all subversion, placing their future hopes on
 free elections and peaceful politicking.  On
 the other side, it would require adherence to
 democratic principles.
 The  American  people  and        Government
 yearn for such a solution. The Communists
 can have a neutralized southeast Asia tomor-
 row if they are prepared to make the reason-
 able adjustments required.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS

 HON. JOSEPH E. KARTH
 OF MINNESOTA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 24, 1966
 Mr. KARTH. Mr. Speaker, I know we
 are all proud of America's latest pioneers,
 the Gemini 8's astronauts and their
 thousands of skilled and dedicated assist-
 ants on land and sea.
 The Chicago Sun-Times carried a re-
 cent editorial praising the men for their
 courage and self-sufficiency.
 The article was written shortly before
 it was learned what caused the vehicles
 to gyrate, but the writer points out:
 Faced with trouble they could not possibly
 diagnose (the astronauts), reacted with the
 highest sort of courage.
 The editorial is typical of many which
 I have seen, and I make it a part of the
 RECORD:
 [From the Chicago (Ill.) Sun-Times, Mar. 18,
 1966]
 TRIUMPH OUT OF DEFEAT
 Despite the failure to accomplish all that
 had been planned, Gemini 8's astronauts and
 their thousands of skilled and dedicated as-
 sistants on land and sea enjoyed great tri-
 umphs.
 The precisely scheduled launching of two
 giant rockets, one following the other into
 orbit through a tiny keyhole in the sky,
 was  unprecedented.   The  chase  through
 space at speeds approaching 20,000 miles an
 hour, the delicate maneuver of joining the
 space capsule to the target rocket, was a
 tremendous  achievement and a most ina-
 A1711
 portant one.  In the years ahead, when man
 continues in his effort to explore space, the
 docking maneuver will be essential in the
 joining together of structures in space that
 will form the bases for further explorations
 into the unknown.
 Whatever caused the two joined space vehi-
 cles to gyrate and thus bring an end to the
 mission is not known.  The two astronauts,
 faced with trouble they could not possibly
 diagnose, reacted with the highest sort of
 courage.  They extricated their capsule from
 the target vessel and effected an emergency
 landing in the far reaches of the Pacific
 Ocean that came off so smoothly that it al-
 most seemed routine.
 That, too, was a great triumph for the
 detailed  planning  against  emergency,  the
 long and patient training to meet every fore-
 seeable                                                                                                                                    hazard          in  space  or  after reentry.
 Astronauts  Armstrong and    Scott  are  safe
 aboard a naval vessel with their space cap-
 sule.  The causes of their trouble in space
 will be explored and solved, as other dif-
 ficulties have been solved, and new triumphs
 can be expected in succeeding Gemini and
 Apollo flights.
 By his very nature, man is a pioneer.  In
 days gone by he pushed his frontiers across
 dread and unknown oceans and into strange
 lands.  His 20th century frontier is the un-
 charted realm of space.  Man brings to that
 effort the same high level of courage and
 self-sufficiency possessed by earlier pioneers,
 as the flight of Gemini 8 so dramatically
 proved.

 the Appendix of the CONGRESSIONAL REC-
 ORD an editorial recently appearing in the
 Washington, D.C., Post entitled "A Good
 Word for L.B.J."
 It is comforting to see that a calm,
 measured, and careful handling of the
 crisis in Vietnam by President Johnson
 achieves the approval and respect of an
 outstanding commentator like Mr. Ros-

 merits careful reading:
 A GooD WORD FOR L.B.J.
 (By Roscoe Drummond)
 I would like to say a good word about
 President Johnson's management of the Viet-
 nam war.                                                                                                                       Obviously, there is a great risk of
 timidly doing too little to arrest the aggres-
 sion and a great danger of recklessly doing
 so much that Red China enters the fighting.
 With these two opposite perils in mind,
 I cannot escape the feeling that many more
 Americans will come to see that the Presi-
 dent is bringing wisdom, caution and deter-
 mination to bear on the conduct of the war.
 Surely the touchstone Of wisdom in our
 role in Vietnam is to do whatever is needed
 to secure South Vietnam from conquest and
 to use our massive military power in such a
 prudent and measured manner that Peking
 Is given no legitimate reason to enter the
 war.
 Such a course will not get the easy plaudits
 of those who want to win quickly at any cost
 by bombing North Vietnam to bits; will not
 get the praise of those who want to quit at
 any cost by pulling out; and will not get a
 high Gallup rating from those who suggest

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, March 24, 1966
 Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina.  Mr.
 Speaker, the following article recently
 appeared in the News and Courier-one
 of South Carolina's leading newspapers.
 In view of the touchy situation in
 Rhodesia, I found the article to be very
 interesting.  Mr. Thomas R. Waring, the
 editor, assures me the author's source of
 information is excellent.  Under unani-
 mous consent, I insert the article in the
 Appendix of the RECORD- for the informa-
 tion of the Congress:
 SOUTHERN AFRICA: TARGET OF BLOCKADE
 (EDITOR'S NOTE.-The author of this article
 about a projected blockade and invasion of
 southern Africa, a foreign military observer
 who resides abroad, has excellent sources of
 information in England, Europe, and Africa.
 He is known to the News and Courier, but
 prefers not to be identified by name or na-
 tionality.  His report confirms a recent ar-
 ticle by Russell Warren Howe in the New
 Leader  magazine  entitled  "Showdown  in
 Southern Africa." Mr. Howe, who is travel-
 ing in Africa on a Ford Foundation press
 fellowship, reported February 28 that the
 Soviet Union is prepared to put its navy at
 the service of the U.N. for a blockade of
 southern Africa.)
 The British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson,
 seems to be determined to escalate his ven-
 detta against Ian Smith, the Prime Minister
 of Rhodesia, who 5 months ago declared uni-
 lateral independence from Britain.  Wilson
 promised the assembled Afro-Asians at the
 British Commonwealth Conference in Lagos
 last year that he would destroy Ian Smith
 and his government by March.   He then
 imposed sanctions against Rhodesia, and per-
 suaded the United States to join in.
 The result has been utter failure, and it
 is even likely that Wilson knew all along
 that it would be.   It is, in fact, probable that
