 DCI CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING FOR
 SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE
 6 March 1974
 I.    Mr. Chairman, before discussing Soviet strategic
 weapons,  I would like to say a few words about
 the Soviet foreign policy developments we have
 come to call detente.   The Russians are still
 holding to this policy, which is increasingly
 identified with General Secretary Brezhnev.
 When we speak of their policy of detente,
 however, a careful definition is in order.
 A.   Detente does not mean a change of heart.   Nor
 does it mean that Moscow has abandoned its
 basic objectives.
 1.   We see continuity most clearly in the
 strategic field,  as will become evident.
 when I discuss weapons development.
 B.   Detente does mean that the Soviets are seek-
 ing advantages in their relationships with
 the West through a new tactic,  to which they
 have committed considerable effort, and prestige.

 Approved For Release 20J6q$/1 ~-WA-M  9R01099A002200010020-1
 II.    This new tactic reflects their realization that
 they are falling behind in the technological
 race.   They have acknowledged to themselves
 that, if they are to begin closing the gap be-
 tween themselves and the Wes"t,  they need to
 import and absorb large amounts of Western
 technology.
 A.   They are trying to do this in a number of
 ways.   One is normal trade...   Another is the
 project method,  in which a Western firm
 contracts to build and bring into operation
 an entire plant..   A third is the exchange
 of technological data with individual
 Western companies.
 B.    As one measure of this effort,  Soviet
 orders for Western machinery and equipment
 hit $2..5 billion last year--a 60 percent
 increase over 1972.   The US is a major
 recipient of such orders, but we by no
 means monopolize the field.   Only some
 $435 million of that $2.5 billion was
 placed with American firms.

 TOP SECRET
 Approved For Release 2006/03/17 : CIA-RDP79RO1099AO02200010020-1
 C.   A second factor in Moscow's new tactic is
 that it sees China as holding a single-minded
 hostility toward the USSR:
 1.    Peking has rebuffed .all Soviet. overtures
 for an improvement of Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions,  and the border negotiations remain
 at square one.
 2.    China devotes the energies of  its new
 diplomacy to countering Soviet policy in
 every area of international politics.
 3.    Moscow realizes that this attitude is not
 just a peculiarity of Mao's personality,
 which will disappear when he does,
 III.    Both the economic factor and the Chinese factor
 are thus fairly  long-term ones,  and both work in
 the same direction on Soviet foreign policy.
 A.   Obviously, normal and amicable relations with
 the West are necessary .if the Soviets are to
 promote their economic objectives.   Major
 confrontations over Berlin, or Cuba, or the
 Middle East would undermine the chances for
 technological gain.

 TOP SECRET
 Approved For Release 2006/03/17 : CIA-RDP79R01099A002200010020-1
 B.   Tense relations with the West would also expose
 the USSR to the risk of pressure on two fronts:
 Western and Eastern    So long as China remains
 actively hostile, the Soviets have a strong
 interest in keeping relations with the West
 on an even keel..
 1.    In particular, they want to give as little
 encouragement as possible to cooperation
 between China and the US--which appears to
 them as collusion against the Soviet Union.
 C.   There are positive political incentives as
 well.   Detente provides a useful climate for
 the extension of Soviet influence in Western
 Europe. It also promotes the concept of So-
 viet equality with the US and Moscow's claim
 of its right to be involved in all interna-
 tional questions,  such as the Middle East.
 IV.    These current priorities have some impact on re-
 lations with the US. Moscow is no longer so ac-
 tive and automatic in opposing US policy in every
 corner of the globe.
 A.   This has helped, for example,  to get a Viet-
 nam settlement and to bring about negotiations

 in the Middle East.   It has not, of course,
 solved major problems in either area, nor
 do the Soviets intend to do that.
 B.     Brezhnev's personal prestige is commited to
 detente.   Last year he made his biggest gains
 with his trips to Bonn and Washington.
 1. All Brezhnev's politburo colleagues now
 acknowledge his preeminent position but
 he is aware he cannot get too far ahead
 of them, and must show some fruits of
 detente.
 2.   Coping with Solzhenitsyn and other dissi-
 dents poses a continuing dilemma of how
 to square the needs of domestic discipline
 with foreign policy considerations.

 DCI CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING
 SOVIET DEFENSE EXPENDITURES
 I.   I would like to conclude this overview of the So-
 viet military effort with a brief discussion of a
 subject that this committee is familiar with--the
 costs of military programs.   Our evidence indicates
 that the Soviet leaders,  too, pay close attention
 to their defense spending.   They apparently be-
 lieve, however, that their economy is capable of
 sustaining or even accelerating the pace of defense
 spending.
 A.  Our calculations of the absolute values of So-
 viet defense costs contain uncertainties, but
 we can depict overall trends in defense spend-
 ing with some confidence.   Since 1960,  the
 trend has been generally upward, increasing
 at an average annual rate of about 3 percent.
 1.   For the last few years, however, ruble
 spending has remained at essentially the
 same level,  reflecting the fact that the

 USSR is between major strategic procure-
 ment cycles.
 a.    Procurement of weapon systems developed
 in the 1960s, and now deployed, was
 largely completed by the end of 1970,
 and             wi- of the strategic sys-
 tems now under development has not
 yet begun.
 2.   The USSR recently announced that defense
 spending would decline by about one per-
 cent in 1974.  We regard this announced
 cut as largely a political gesture, rather
 than an indicator of actual spending.
 3.   Our estimates of Soviet spending for 1974--
 which are based on observed and projected
 changes in military and space programs and
 forces--show a slight increase in total
 defense outlays.
 4.   Moreover, we expect to see--if not a spend-
 ing splurge--at least a substantial upswing
 in Soviet expenditures for procurement in
 1975 and 1976.   By then, production of the
 new strategic systems now under development
 should begin.

 TOP SECRET
 Approved For Release 2006/03/17 : CIA-RDP79R01099A002200010020-1
 5.     The share of total defense funds allo-
 cated to military R&D and space has
 grown steadily over the last five years.
 In fact, outlays for.these purposes have
 been the fastest rising element of de-
 fense spending and now account for about
 one-third of the total.   We expect growth
 in military R&D to moderate over the next
 few years, however,  as the USSR begins
 procurement of new strategic systems.
 6.      As for manpower, the Soviets devote about
 37 percent of their ruble defense spend-
 ing to active military,  retirEd military,
 and civilians--as opposed to about 51 per-
 cent for the United States for these items.
 The shares for active duty pay and al-
 lowances alone are much closer.   Never-
 theless,  the Soviets are able to keep 65
 percent more men under arms--simply by
 paying their conscripts relatively much
 less than we pay our soldiers./ (Thfr mp-

 CHINA
 I.    One can hardly mention the Soviet Union without
 thinking of China.   I would like to bring you up
 to date on the internal political situation,         for-
 eign policy trends, the progress the Chinese are
 making toward a nuclear deterrent,  and chances of
 hostilities with the Soviet Union.
 The Domestic Scene
 II. As you know, the Tenth Party Congress took place
 last August,  and it has given us a new basis for
 assessing the domestic political scene.
 A.   The congress was the shortest since the Com-
 munists gained power in 1949, suggesting that
 the leadership wanted to avoid a full discus-
 sion of many controversial policy issues.
 B.   The meeting focused on reconstructing the top
 organs of the party after the disruptions of
 the Lin Piao affair and the earlier Cultural
 Revolution.

 L&HP79R01099A002200010020-1
 1.    The congress adopted a revised party con-
 stitution, which deleted a specific refer-
 ence in the previous version to Lin as
 Mao's designated successor but did not
 name a new heir.
 C.    The new Politburo,  like its predecessor, had--
 until very recently--21 full members and four
 alternates.   It is a mix of moderate officials,
 radical ideologues, military men and elder
 statesmen--a coalition of divergent interests
 that seems roughly balanced between moderates
 and ultraleftists.
 1.    All of the active members of the previous
 Politburo retained their positions,  and
 nine new faces appeared.
 2.    Earlier this year, one more name was added.
 Teng Hsiao-ping,  a former secretary-
 general of the party who was purged
 during the Cultural Revolution and then
 rehabilitated last year, regained the
 seat he used to have on the Politburo.
 a.   His reinstatement is an indication
 that other rehabilitated party and

 government officials who were vic-
 tims of the Cultural Revolution will
 again be given positions of respon-
 sibility.
 D.   Chou En-lai is clearly the number two man in
 China, but he is only one of five vice chair-
 men elected at the congress.
 1.           The others are two military men, an aging
 radical who is largely inactive,  and the
 rising young official from Shanghai, Wang
 Hung-wen.   Wang is only in his mid-thirties,
 and was a radical during the Cultural Revo-
 lution.   His. elevation is the leadership's
 acknowledgement that there must be new blood
 in the highest councils.
 2.    This group presumably will serve as a col-
 lective leadership when Mao dies,  although
 the revised party constitution did not so
 stipulate.
 III.      The army's role in politics has been a controver-
 sial issue.
 A.   Army leaders were thrust into politics simply
 because the party and civil administrations

 were shattered by the Cultural Revolution.   As
 soon as the dust of that phenomenon began to
 settle,  and particularly after the Lin Piao
 affair, the civilian authorities started to
 reassert their control over the military.
 B.   On New Year's Day Peking revealed a massive
 reshuffle,  affecting the commanders of seven
 of the 11 military regions and the head of
 the army's General Political Department.
 1.    The transfers separated the leaders from
 their provincial power bases in which all
 but one had concurrently headed the pro-
 vincial party committee.
 C.   The reinstatement of Teng Hsiao-ping also is
 important to this move as he has been assigned,
 even though a civilian, to the party's Mili-
 tary Commission.
 IV. Let me,  finally, say a few words about "Confucius."
 A.   In August 1973 Peking's major propaganda out-
 lets began to feature articles attacking the
 ancient sage Confucius  (around 550 B.C.)  and
 his followers.   They were depicted as conser-
 vative, tradition-bound forces who were

 successfully opposed at crucial periods of
 Chinese history by more progressive elements.
 1.     It is clear that this campaign has direct
 relevance to what is going on today in
 China,  and that "Confucius" is some actual
 person.   There is much speculation among
 China specialists--and among the Chinese
 themselves--about the purpose of the
 whole affair.
 2.   Some observers see the campaign as an
 attempt to reinvigorate the populace with
 the "revolutionary" spirit so dear to Mao.
 3.   Another view holds that the campaign is
 part of a bitter feud between radical
 and moderate forces in the party's top
 leadership.   The radicals--led by Madame
 Mao--are said to be attacking Chou En-lai
 in an effort to protect the leftist poli-
 cies of the Cultural Revolution.
 4.   Our analysts see the campaign as the open-
 ing round in the succession struggle.   They
 believe Chou En-lai and Madame Mao differ
 sharply over the conduct of foreign and

 domestic policy,  and see the campaign as
 Chou's effort to keep Chinese policy on
 the moderate course that he was able to
 set--with Mao's support--after the Cul-
 tural Revolution.
 5.   Madame Mao has limited political power
 of her own, but is apparently the rally-
 ing point for disaffected elements in
 the power structure, especially those
 military leaders who are unhappy over
 their diminishing political power.
 B.   The campaign is of major political importance, and
 could well result in a purge, but we do not
 believe it will escalate into the chaos of another
 Cultural Revolution.
 1.   The Chinese leadership has taken steps to
 keep the campaign under strict party control.
 a.     In January the Central Committee issued a
 series of directives, including one that
 set clear limitations on the conduct of the
 campaign,  such as a ban on attacks on
 specific individuals.

 b.    On February 20,  an authoritative editorial
 in People's Daily warned that the cam-
 paign must stay on the "correct course"
 and must not become "entangled" with "other
 problems."
 2.   Chou En-lai, moreover, is in the strongest
 position of his long career,  and he is
 firmly opposed to excessive measures.   At
 the age of 75, however,  Chou will not be
 around indefinitely.   In the meantime, he
 reportedly is attempting to ease the crushing
 burden of work he has borne by transferring
 some functions to Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping.
 Chinese Foreign Policy
 V.   Despite the heating up of the internal situation,
 China's foreign policy remains on course.   Major
 departures from the pattern of the past few years
 are unlikely.
 A.   In the last week or two, the Chinese have gone to
 considerable lengths to indicate officially and
 unofficially that no such changes are contemplated
 and that the new relationship with the United
 States remains intact.

 B.    Chou En-lai in a recent speech sought to
 damp down Western press speculation that major
 policy shifts were imminent by emphasizing the
 controlled nature of the anti-Confucius campaign.
 C.    Despite this speculation, we think it likely that the
 campaign will ultimately reaffirm and reinforce
 Peking's current foreign policy stance.
 1.    In the immediate future, however, the Chinese
 will probably concentrate more oft internal
 than external affairs.
 VI.  In any case, Chou En-lai's main concern is to
 counter Soviet efforts to isolate China.   One of
 his and Mao's main weapons is "detente" with the
 United States.
 A.   Secretary Kissinger's visit last autumn
 gave Peking an opportunity to demonstrate
 the importance it attaches to detente.
 B.   Mao's long meeting with the Secretary--
 nearly two hours--set the seal of high-
 est authority on the policy of continuing--
 and improving--relations with Washington.
 C.   The Chinese also seem anxious to forestall
 any significant improvement of relations be-
 tween Japan and the Soviet Union.

 DCI CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING
 THE MIDDLE EAST
 I.          Turning now to the Middle East, you all know that
 the Israeli-Egyptian disengagement agreement was
 successfully concluded on March 4,  24 hours ahead
 of schedule.
 A.   The entire 40-day disengagement period pro-
 ceeded smoothly, with only minor and mostly
 accidental violations.   Both sides seemed to
 take particular care to follow both the letter
 and the spirit of the agreement.
 B.   The Egyptians now have control of both banks
 of the Suez Canal for the first time in almost
 seven years,  and they have been proceeding at
 a smart pace to begin clearing the waterway
 and rebuilding the devastated cities along it.
 C.   The Israelis are now situated some 15-20 kilom-
 eters from the Canal, where they retain con-
 trol of the strategic Mitla and Gidi passes.
 A UN buffer force of about 2,000 men has been
 interposed between the Egyptian and Israeli
 forces on the east bank.

 Vietnam
 I.  Turning to Indochina,  Mr:,   Chairman, we see that
 the war in South Vietnam still sputters more than
 a year after the Paris accord was signed.
 A.    It is worth noting, however,  that the level
 of fighting has dropped since the signing of
 the accord.
 1.   Casualties in 1973,  for example, while
 still high, were down significantly
 compared with the previous year.
 a.   On the Communist, side, they declined
 from over 160,000 to about 41,000.
 b.   Government losses dropped from 36,000
 killed to around 15,000,
 B.   Significant fighting continues,  however, and
 engagements are sometimes intense.
 1.   Two of the peak periods last year were
 just after the cease-fire was signed on
 January 28th,  and just before the second
 agreement on June .15th that was intended

 Approved For Release 200QV11~79R01099A002200010020-1
 to tighten up the ceasefire.
 2.   In both periods,  the fighting resulted
 largely from last-minute Communist ef-
 forts to grab additional territory that
 they hoped to keep permanently if the
 cease-fire proved effective.
 3.   In most cases, however,  the South Viet-
 namese were able to push the Communists
 back,  and Saigon probably controls more
 territory today than it did when the cease-
 fire agreement was signed.
 C.   The larger battles have been fought primarily
 over remote government outposts in areas the
 Communists use for supply movement.
 II.    The question remains whether the North Vietnamese
 will launch a major offensive in the current dry
 season, which ends in May,,
 A.   Hanoi's intention to gain control of the South,
 by military force if necessary,  remains unchanged.
 B.   Late last year we concluded, after a thorough
 examination,  that it was a close choice whether
 an offensive would occur this dry season.
 C.   Since then,  although analysts still differ,
 there is general agreement that the chances
 of an offensive have declined0

 D.    Our evidence over the past several months has
 had many conflicting strands.
 1.   On the one hand,    Hanoi has moved large
 quantities of war materiel into South
 Vietnam.   It also has more troops in the
 South than it did at the start of the 1972
 offensive.
 2.   On the other hand,  infiltration of replace-
 ments for anticipated losses--which in previ-
 ous years has been one of our most depend-
 able indicators of Communist intentions--
 has been less this dry season than we
 might have expected,,
 a.    So far only about 35,000 regular com-
 bat troops have set out for South Viet-
 nam--mostly for the central highlands
 and the southern part of the country.
 b.    Infiltration rates have fluctuated
 greatly in earlier years, but this
 is an unusually low rate by the
 standards of the last five years.
 c.    Moreover,  it appears that the mili-
 tary conscription effort in the North
 was smaller in 1973.

 Hanoi could still. move enough infiltrators
 south to sustain an offensive this
 dry season.      In any major push it
 probably would also use the three
 infantry divisions now in garrison in
 the North,
 Inside South Vietnam, Communist briefers
 have recently asserted that no offensive
 is planned this spring.
 a.    One of our best sources,  for example,
 says he was told that while
 the Communists will intensify the level
 of fighting in an effort to prevent
 government inroads and expand their
 own holdings,  there will. not be a
 major offensive.
 b.       Our source added that the Communists
 intend to emphasize political subversion,
 rough activities such as recruiting,
 propagandizing, and terrorism.
 III.     There is likely to be sporadic fighting,  some of
 it quite heavy,  as both sides probe for weaknesses
 along the ill-defined lines that separate them.

 A.   Early this year,  for instance,  heavy action
 occurred in the central highlands, where the
 Communists sparred with Saigon's forces over
 several communications routes and key outposts.
 B.   More recently the focus has shifted to the
 populous delta, where government forces are
 trying to move into Communist base areas.
 C.   Fighting could increase in the provinces north
 of Saigon, and there also is always the
 possibility of heavy fighting in the far north
 of the country--the only area where Communist
 combat forces could quickly be reinforced for
 a major offensive.
 IV.    Talks on a political settlement between the Thieu
 government and the Viet Cong have made little
 headway.
 A.  Both sides have been mainly concerned with
 gaining propaganda advantage,  and have shown
 little inclination to compromise their positions.
 V.    The Thieu government has improved its position
 vis-a-vis its Communist and non-Communist opponents
 during the past year.
 A.  Senate elections last summer gave Thieu firm
 control over both houses of the legislature

 for the first time.,
 B.   The President has continued to develop his
 Democracy Party to strengthen his political
 apparatus throughout the country.
 C.   A presidential decree on political parties
 early last year has served to further weaken
 the already factionalized opposition parties.
 D.   The government is implementing a broad program
 of administrative reforms to improve its per-
 formance and standing in rural areas,  although
 the program is behind schedule and its scope
 has been reduced.
 VI.    The most serious problem is in the country's
 economy.
 A.   South Vietnam still depends heavily on foreign
 economic aid, although it has been trying to
 diversify its sources of aid through agreements
 with countries such as Japan and France.
 B.   Inflation is a chronic problem,jnd prices rose
 some 67 percent last year.
 C.   The government,  however,  staved off the most
 severe threat of serious rice shortages late
 last year.

 Cambodia
 VII.     in Cambodia,  the Lon Nol government continues to
 bear up fairly well under Khmer Communist military
 pressure.   The Cambodian Army has pushed back
 all recent Communist attacks in the Phnom Penh
 area.
 A.   The Communists have had only limited success in
 carrying out plans for coordinated attacks
 around the capital that were to began around
 February 25.
 1.    They have mounted light attacks against
 army outposts southeast of Phnom Penh and
 on the Mekong River's east bank just
 upstream from the capital.
 2.    Northwest and south of Phnom Penh,  however,
 the Communists have been forced to surrender
 most of the gains they made early in t]e
 present dry season.
 3,    The Communists' withdrawal in the south
 has taken them out of artillery range of
 Phnom Penh in that area.
 4.    Although the Communists have interdicted
 key overland supply routes,  they have
 failed to block vital resupply convoys on
 the Mekong.

 B.   The Communists' performance in the past few
 weeks suggests that they may not be able to
 launch another major offensive against Phnom
 Penh in the near future.
 1.   It may take them some time to offset the
 effects of steady casualties, sickness, and
 desertions.
 2.   Communist offensive plans may also be
 affected by the need to stockpile new
 munitions near the front lines.  (Hanoi,
 incidentally, still supplies arms and
 ammunition.)
 3.   In addition, their tactical coordination
 continues to be weak.
 C.   The Communists have also been suffering some
 slippage in the countryside.
 1.   Their hold over the population in some rural
 areas has been weakened by the dispatch
 of provincial security forces to the
 Phnom Penh front.
 2.   There are also signs of growing villager
 unrest over harsh Communist control measures.
 3.   Local government forces are beginning to
 exploit this situation by running aggressive

 operations into some of the affected areas.
 4.    In one such area,  22,000 villagers recently
 rallied to the government.
 D.      Despite these encouraging developments, the
 Lon Nol government is still not out of the
 woods.   But it now appears that it may emerge
 from the dry season in somewhat better military
 shape than the Communists.

 to form a new coalition government by the first
 anniversary of the Laos peace agreement, on February 21,
 but he still hopes to do it soon,
 A.   Souvanna has made significant progress in
 resolving disputes over the proper procedure
 for the coalition's investiture--a key sticking
 point in the protracted negotiations.
 1.        The King has finally agreed to invest the
 government even it it is not presented to the
 legislature for approval.
 2.       This is in line with the Lao Communists"
 view that only royal approval of the govern-
 ment is required.
 3.         Dissident rightist political elements in
 the legislature appear willing to go along
 with this procedure.
 B.   Souvanna now expects a senior Pathet. Lao official
 to come to Vientiane "very soon" with a definitive
 list of the Communist ministers  for the new
 cabinet

 1.   He then expects to meet with Lao Communist
 leader Souphanouvong to approve all
 nominees for the new government.
 C.    Thus, the next moves clearly are up to the
 Communists.
 1.   The chief Pathet Lao negotiator left
 Vientiane on February 27 to report the
 results of his recent talks with Souvanna to
 Pathet Lao leaders in Sam Neua.
 3.    He also showed concern over some lingering
 procedural difficulties associated with the
 neutralization of the twin capitals of Luang
 Prabang and Vientiane,
 4.   If his superiors uphold these concerns, there
 will be still more delay in forming the new
 government.
 IX. Hanoi has withdrawn some of its forces since the
 cease-fire went into effect.

 regiments have redeployed from southern

 Laos--at least one has gone back to North
 Vietnam, and another to the western
 highlands of South. Vietnam?
 2.   We have also noted the first significant
 withdrawals of North Vietnamese combat
 units from northern Laos.   Major elements
 of the North Vietnamese 316th Division went
 home in December.
 3.   However, an estimated 55,000-60,000 North
 Vietnamese troops are still in Laos.
 X.        The Chinese have also begun to scale down their military
 presence in northern. Laos.
 A. Since last fall, virtually all of their air
 defense forces--as well as the two infantry
 regiments which deployed to Laos in late 1971 and
 early 1972   have returned to China.
 1.    Despite these departures, however, the
 Chinese are still rotating engineer units
 in and out, of Laos..
 2.    These road construction and maintenance forces
 presently constitute the bulk of the estimated
 25,000 Chinese personnel in north Laos.

 CUBA
 I. The Castro government is beginning its 16th year
 in power in the midst of a major restructuring
 of its party and government bureaucracies.             This
 process was begun in 1970 at least partly as a
 result of Soviet pressure.
 A.   The Cuban Communist Party has been undergoing
 a reorganization to increase its influence
 in the formulation and execution of the
 regime's policies.
 13.   The sweeping reorganization of the upper
 levels of government in November 1972
 freed the top leaders from active involve-
 ment in routine matters,  and enabled them
 to concentrate on long-range policy for-
 mulation.
 C. These changes are primarily designed to
 reduce the economic stagnation and admin-
 istrative chaos caused by the Castro regime's
 spontaneous style of decision-making.

 II.  Cuba is expanding its ties with other Latin
 American governments.   At the same time, Cuban
 involvement in subversive activities is at an
 all-time low.
 A.   Cuba now has diplomatic relations with
 Argentina,  Mexico, Peru,  Guyana,  Jamaica,
 Barbados,  and Trinidad.
 B.   Venezuela,  Honduras,  and Panama are trading
 with Cuba but formal relations do not appear
 imminent.
 C.   Last fall Cuba's national airline inaugurated
 a new air route linking Havana to Barbados,
 Trinidad,  and Guyana.
 III.    Relations with the USSR reflect Cuba's almost
 complete dependence on Soviet military and
 economic support.
 A.   There are some signs that Castro is not
 entirely happy with the situation,  but he
 knows his options are limited.
 B.   During Brezhnev's recent visit, Castro gave
 his first public endorsement to detente.
 1.     The Soviet leader apparently convinced him
 that Moscow's pursuit of detente would not
 lead to compromise of Cuban interests.
