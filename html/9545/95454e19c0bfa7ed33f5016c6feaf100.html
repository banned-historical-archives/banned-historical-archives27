 De Gaulle's priority problem is Algeria, where
 leaders of the insurrectionary junta are making a major
 effort to induce the new Paris government to espouse their
 program for Algeria's future.          The Moslem nationalist
 rebels can be expected to continue their fight for the
 recognition of Algeria's right to independence.  The
 governments of Tunisia and Morocco, hopeful that the
 De Gaulle regime means improvement in their relations
 with France, have nevertheless emphatically reiterated
 that their immediate objective is the evacuation of
 French troops.
 FRANCE .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .    .    .  . .       .  .  .  .  .  . . . .  .  Page 2
 General de Gaulle has been voted authority to
 rule for six months without Parliament while prepar-
 ing constitutional reforms to be submitted to a ref-
 erendum.  His foreign policies are still not clear
 but he appears to be making an effort to reassure
 France's allies.  Domestically, although invested
 with the solid support of the right, a great major-
 ity of the center, and about half of the non-Commu-
 nist left, he faces difficult political problems,
 and even more urgent economic issues.
 LEBANESE DEVELOPMENTS   . .  .  .  .  .  .  .       .  . . . .  .
 Rebel military activity in Lebanon appears to
 an increasing degree to be a product of UAR inspira-
 tion and support, since indigenous dissident leaders
 have shown some signs of discouragement and now may
 be more willing than before to compromise.  Presi-
 dent Cbamoun has implicitly abandoned his second-term
 effort, and the present objectives of the opposition
 appear to be to install a "neutral" prime minister and
 to prepare the ground for new parliamentary elections.
 However, political moves have been held in abeyance
 pending a UN Security Council debate on Lebanon's
 complaint against UAR interference.

 PART I (continued)
 SINO-SOVIET BLOC DISPUTE WITH YUGOSLAVIA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  5
 Khrushchev's personal attack on Yugoslav here-
 sies delivered before the Bulgarian Communist par-
 ty congress on 3 June virtually excludes all possi-
 bility of an early reconciliation between Moscow
 and Belgrade.   He upheld the 1948 Cominform reso-
 lution expelling Yugoslavia, endorsed in unequivo-
 cal language the Chinese Communist "hard line" to-
 ward the Yugoslav leaders, and asserted that the
 bloc is united against Yugoslav "revisionism."
 His harsh statements increase the pressure on Go-
 mulka to conform to the basic line already espoused
 by the Soviet press that Yugoslav heresies cannot
 be tolerated.

 Moscow, in agreeing to participate in techni-
 cal discussions on a control system for the suspen-
 sion of nuclear tests, has reiterated its willingness
 to consider installation of inspection posts on Soviet
 territory.  While bloc leaders continue to urge a sum-
 mit meeting publicly, the USSR still insists on main-
 taining a veto over the agenda items to be discussed.

 KHRUSHCHEV AND COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY  . . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  Page
 Khrushchev appears to be showing increased interest in
 Communist ideology, and Izvestia has identified him person-
 ally with doctrinal innovations.  This portrayal of him as
 a theoretician adds to the growing number of fields in
 which Khrushchev is being depicted as the Soviet Union's
 leading spokesman.  Concomitantly there has been a decrease
 in the number of references to collective leadership in the
 party presidium.
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 KHRUSHVHEV'S SOVIET-US TRADE PROPOSAL . .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .    Page  3
 Khrushchev's letter to President Eisenhower calling
 for an official trade agreement and proposing exchanges
 worth "several billion dollars in the next few years" is
 intended to demonstrate to the world a "conciliatory" at-
 titude toward the United States and to emphasize Moscow's
 repeated proposals for discussing international trade at
 the summit and for holding an international economic con-
 ference.  The proposals seem primarily politically in-
 spired.
 USSR SEEKS BIDS ON PIPELINE TO BALTIC AND POLAND    .  .  .     Page  4
 Soviet interest in expanding petroleum exports to
 the West was again noted in May when the USSR renewed an
 invitation to a Swedish engineering firm to bid on a
 major 1,900-mile oil pipeline system from the Urals-Volga
 oil fields to the Baltic Sea with branch lines to Eastern
 Europe.   Such a system, together with the scheduled con-
 struction of refineries and port facilities on the Baltic,
 would put the USSR in a favorable position to sell its oil
 in northern Europe. F_         I
 LEADERSHIP CHANGES IN RSFSR   .  .  .  . . . .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  5
 The direction of the Russian Republic Council of
 Ministers has been transferred to new bands as a result
 of top-level appointments during the last few months.
 Four of the new appointees were previously working out-
 side Moscow and bring to their new4osts an understanding
 of conditions in areas away from the center; three are
 former regional party functionaries.  The naming of party
 careerists to government and industrial administrative
 posts is a trend associated with Khrushchev which has de-
 veloped since his industrial reorganization went into
 effect a year ago.

 SINO-SOVIET BLOC ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH YUGOSLAVIA  . .  .  Page  7
 The principal economic effect of the five-year sus-
 pension of Soviet development credits to Yugoslavia, an-
 nounced on 27 May and tantamount to cancellation, prob-
 ably will be the hindrance of long-range planning in
 Yugoslavia.  Belgrade may have to buy or obtain by barter
 about 1,000,000 tons of wheat it was to have received
 from the USSR over the next five years to generate local
 construction funds for an aluminum mill.  The bloc, how-
 ever, now accounts for no more than 25 to 30 percent of
 Yugoslav trade in any particular item, and Belgrade,
 while it might be seriously inconvenienced, can find
 alternate markets to avert any major economic crisis.
 SOVIET-FINNISH COMMUNIQUE                                           Page  8
 The communique issued at the conclusion of Finnish
 President Kekkonen's recent 10-day visit to Moscow reaf-
 firms Soviet acceptance of Finland's neutrality and indi-
 cates that the USSR wishes to continue its good relations
 with the Finns as an example of friendly coexistence be-
 tween a small and large nation having opposing social
 systems.  The communiqud is broader than those issued.in'
 previous years and expresses agreement on subjects of some
 significance, including Soviet acceptance in principle of
 a Finnish loan request and specific Finnish endorsement
 of certain Soviet foreign policy objectives.                                25X1
 THE BLOC AND THE WORLD RUBBER MARKET . . . . . . . . . . .  Page 10
 The Sino-Soviet bloc imports and consumes only about
 15 percent of the world output of natural rubber and by
 its purchases can only temporarily affect world rubber
 prices.  Careful manipulation of purchases and offers, how-
 ever, has contributed to the bloc's expanded influence in
 rubber-producing countries.
 THE PHILIPPINES   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  Page 11
 Philippine President Garcia, who arrives in Washington
 on 17 June for a state visit, has indicated he will seek at
 least $300,000,000 in financial aid to alleviate his coun-
 try's economic problems.  Garcia has done little himself,
 however, to prevent political and economic deterioration
 under his administration.

 Present Soviet policy toward the West German'Gov-

 rearming of Bonn's armed forces. At the same time,tbe USSR
 recognizing West Germany's,increasyingly important posi-

 since 1953 to a figure of $762,000,000 in 1957, encouraged
 investments in the area, and set up technical assistance

 SOVIET INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY SYSTEM  . . . .  .    . .  . . . . .  Page  8
 A major goal of Khrush6hev's 1957 reorganization of
 the Soviet industrial administration was to improve in-
 dustrial efficiency through changes in the system of sup-
 ply and marketing which would reduce transport costs and
 make economies possible by production specialization.
 While progress in many aspects of the reorganization has
 been rapid, the important matter of revamping supply re-
 lationships has moved slowly*-  It now appears that further
 changes will continue to be gradual, reflecting the gov-
 ernment's concern over the ill effects of an abrupt change.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 DE GAULLE AND NORTH AFRICA
 De Gaulle's priority prob-
 lem is Algeria, where leaders
 of the insurrectionary military-
 civilian junta are making a
 major effort to induce the new
 government in effect to align
 itself with their virtual rev-
 olution.   Although the general
 in his 4 June speech in Algiers
 seemingly endorsed the "integra-
 tion" line espoused by local
 leaders, his explicit promise
 of political equality to Algeri-
 an Moslems and his failure to
 commit himself to "indissoluble"
 ties between Algeria and France
 have undoubtedly heightened the
 existing anxiety of French set-
 tlers and the military over his
 ultimate Algerian policy.
 The junta leaders' concern
 on this score, founded original-
 ly on past De Gaulle statements
 favoring a federal relationship
 for Algeria, was stimulated by
 the general's  preinvestiture
 compromises with the condemned
 "regime of parties" and, par-
 ticularly, by his inclusion in
 the new cabinet of former Pre-
 mier Pflimlin and exclusion so
 far of anyone--such as Jacques
 Soustelle--closely associated
 with the rightist movement in
 Algeria.   Semiofficial French
 reports that De Gaulle considers
 himself minister for Algeria
 are unlikely to alter the situa-
 tion.
 In the likely event that
 De Gaulle's further policy pro-
 nouncements increase the dis-
 enchantment of the 1,200,000
 resident Europeans in Algeria,
 extremists among them, who are
 determined to perpetuate the
 revolutionary public safety
 committees, may well organize
 new protests.   However, the bulk
 of the army and particularly the
 local high command, which has
 recently tightened its control
 throughout Algeria and is most
 anxious to regularize its role
 with legitimate French authority,
 is believed loyal to De Gaulle
 and unlikely for the foreseeable
 future to oppose any of his poli-
 cies overtly.
 Top French military leaders
 --concerned above all with main-
 taining the unity of the army--
 will nevertheless probably be
 unable entirely to ignore pres-
 sure emanating from the influ-
 ential younger officers who par-
 ticipated in plotting the 13 May

 local civilian extremists.   More-
 over, the psychological impact
 of the insurrection on the en-

 between its personnel and the
 European Algerians--appears to
 have been such as to practically
 exclude the possibility of em-

 extremist-instigated demonstra-

 De Gaulle.
 The American consul general
 in Algiers reports that the par-

 ing the "new French Algeria" is
 so far still a purely surface
 development.   He does not believe
 the long-disillusioned Moslems
 have recently undergone any
 fundamental  change of heart to-
 ward France and especially dis-
 counts junta claims that they
 now regard themselves as Frenchmen.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 June 1958
 De Gaulle's personal popularity,
 in North Africa and his 4 June
 speech may have aroused hopes
 of a better future among some
 Moslems, but these have undoubt-
 edly been tempered  by  fears
 that even the general may be
 unable ultimately to prevail
 over the rightists. The Public
 Safety Committee's recent public
 repudiation of Algiers' Mayor
 Chevallier--a liberal in whom
 many Moslems have confidence--
 was certainly not reassuring to
 the Moslems, who will be further
 alienated if Chevallier's- prof-
 fered resignation is accepted.
 Despite the immediate "cat-
 egorical  rejection"  of  De
 Gaulle's 4 June proposals by
 spokesmen in Cairo and Tunis
 for the Moslem rebels of the
 Algerian National Liberation
 Front (FLN), FLN leaders were
 probably somewhat encouraged by
 the general's vague reference
 to the future election of rep-
 resentatives with whom Algeria's
 future would be discussed and
 by his praise for the "courage"
 of rebel fighters. However, the
 FLN can be expected to'continue
 to fight until Algeria's; right
 to ultimate independence is at
 least implicitly recognized.
 Both'Tunisian President
 Bourguiba and Moroccan King Mo-
 hamed V have responded cautious-
 ly to De Gaulle's notes of 2
 June,but probably are guardedly
 hopeful that his policy toward
 North Africa will be positive
 enough for progress to be made
 in solving their major difficul-
 ties with France.   The Tunisian
 press was critical of the tone
 of the note to Bourguiba, which
 was notably cooler than that to
 the King, and also criticized the
 failure of De Gaulle's statement
 to specify that the settlement
 of "present difficulties" would
 include early French evacuation
 from Tunisia.  The Tunisians ap-
 parently believe-De Gaulle's
 principal aim is less to renew
 talks than to eliminate Anglo-
 American good offices..
 Although the King's 'response
 was as cordial in  tone as  De
 Gaulle's note, the  Moroccan
 premier's office issued a state-
 ment on 3 June explicitly em-
 phasizing that Morocco's goals
 remain the evacuation of French
 troops and Algerian independence.
 The American ambassador in Rabat
 expects Moroccan policy toward
 France to harden if De Gaulle
 accepts the thesis of Algerian
 "integration."  Reaction in both
 Morocco  and  Tunisia  to  De
 Gaulle's 4 June speech in  Al-
 giers was disappointment and
 skepticism that relations with
 France could be improved.
 25X1
 Although armed with a six-
 month grant of  power to  rule
 without parliamentary obstruc-
 tionism, General de Gaulle faces
 difficult and urgent political
 and economic problems.   The gen-
 eral's investiture vote of 329-
 224, a smaller margin than he
 had hoped for, can be explained
 at least in part by the assem-
 bly's jealousy of its preroga-
 tives and by party maneuvering
 with an eye to future political
 alignments when De Gaulle final-
 ly steps down.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 De Gaulle's Appointments
 De Gaulle selected his 15-
 member cabinet with a view to
 obtaining as much National As-
 sembly support of his program
 as possible, particularly on
 the non-Communist left.   He re-
 ceived the solid support of the
 right, a great majority of the
 center, and about half the non-
 Communist left.   The Socialists
 are divided over Guy Mollet's
 support of De Gaulle, and the
 split may have permanently
 ended Mollet's ability to domi-
 nate his party. There are only
 two "Gaullists" in the cabinet.
 De Gaulle has named an
 "inner cabinet" of major party
 leaders--Socialist Guy Mollet,
 Popular Republican Pierre
 Pflimlin, Independent Louis
 Jacquinot, and the West African
 leader Felix Houphouet-Boigny--
 apparently to advise him politi-
 cally and muster popular support
 for his policies.  The general
 is acting at least temporarily
 as his own defense minister,
 presumably to ensure healing
 the breach between Paris and
 the army in Algeria.   He has
 also reappointed General Paul
 Ely, who resigned in protest
 over Pflimlin's policies, as
 chief of staff of the armed
 forces in a move designed to
 please the army and possibly,
 since Ely is firmly pro-NATO,
 to reassure Western military
 leaders.
 De Gaulle's decision  to
 name Atomic Energy Commissariat
 Administrator Pierre Guillaumat
 to a cabinet post--as yet un-
 specified--probably foreshadows
 a drive to make France the
 fourth nuclear power as soon
 as possible.
 Foreign Policy
 De Gaulle's foreign poli-
 cies, unmentioned in his in-
 vestiture speech, are still not
 clear, but he appears to be mak-
 ing a major effort to reassure
 France's allies, particularly
 the United States.   Couve de
 Murville, former ambassador to
 Washington, has been named for-
 eign minister, and Mollet, a
 stalwart supporter of NATO and
 European integration, has re-
 portedly been asked to give his
 attention to foreign affairs,
 particularly "relations with
 Anglo-Saxon countries."  Presi-
 dent Coty's chief civil adviser
 is now optimistic that France
 will be a "solid, though prob-
 ably difficult" ally in NATO.
 Pinay has stated that De Gaulle,
 while he realizes he must live
 with NATO, will insist on a
 greater French share in NATO
 planning.   Pinay said De Gaulle
 favors a European community
 "built around France" rather
 than one in which France is an
 equal partner.
 The American Embassy in
 Paris reports a "host of confus-
 ing and contradictory informa-
 tion" as to De Gaulle's inten-
 tions regarding constitutional
 reform, but suggests that he may
 favor a presidential system with
 a president elected by universal
 suffrage.   Although De Gaulle
 was subsequently quoted in the
 press as opposed to a "presiden-
 tial regime," he has, in any
 case, long favored strengthening
 the executive at the expense of
 the all-powerful assembly.   De
 Gaulle will also probably propose
 electoral reforms to cut down
 party fragmentation, which pro-
 portional representation encour-
 ages.   There is also a report
 suggesting that he is thinking
 in terms of a general decentral-
 ization, with greater powers
 being granted to the local de-
 partmental,councils.

 25X1
 With a mounting economic
 crisis in France, De Gaulle
 probably faces a wave of worker
 demands and strikes for higher
 wages, which have been held in
 abeyance pending a settlement
 of the political crisis.   He
 has attempted to fashion a
 "bridge" to the non-Communist
 labor unions via Mollet and by
 appointing Popular Republican
 Paul Bacon, who is close to the
 Christian Labor Confederation,
 as minister of labor, but the
 Communists will continue to en-
 courage strike activity.   France's
 economic problems will also be
 complicated by the probable re-
 newed demands of the military
 for funds they lost during
 Gaillard's   economy  drive.
 Neither the Lebanese Gov-
 ernment's security forces nor
 the opposition's irregulars
 have been able to achieve a
 decisive victory in any of the
 areas of the guerrilla  war.
 Moslem quarters of the larger
 towns remain closed to the gov-
 ernment, and the general strike
 continues as far as Moslem shops
 are concerned.   A more active
 rebel effort has been made to
 close down the oil
 port of Sidon, the
 terminus of the Amer-
 ican-owned Tapline
 from Saudi Arabia.
 Outside the
 towns, the Biqa Val-
 ley remains the scene
 of most of the  ac-
 tion.   With the help
 of army  aircraft,
 progovernment  par-
 tisans in the north-
 ern part of the val-

 jor attack early this
 week by a rebel group
 which had been heav-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 June 1958
 Syrians have recruited a.,number
 of Lebanese nationals who had
 been working in Kuwait and tkans-
 ported them by air to Damascus,
 where they are being transformed
 into rebel partisans.   The
 Lebanese Army estimates the reb-
 els now number 11,000, exclu-
 sive of outside reinforcements.
 There are indications that
 rebel leaders may be worried
 that their growing dependence
 on LIAR support will limit their
 own freedom of action. Should
 the opposition forces be un-
 successful  in  getting  a
 satisfactory political settle-
 ment soon, they might be driven
 to embrace the idea of the pre-
 dominantly Moslem areas of Leb-
 anon of eec eding ' and' joining the
 UAR.
 The American Embassy in
 Beirut has reported that calls
 for new parliamentary elections
 are becoming stronger. However,
 most  moderate leaders oppose
 such elections on'the ground
 that they would only exacerbate
 the divisions which the moder-
 ates want to heal.   Little has
 been heard this week of the de-
 mand that President Chamoun re-
 sign immediately. The opposition
 tactic has been to urge a "neu-
 tral" prime minister, who would
 in fact govern the country while
 Chamoun was restricted to his
 "legitimate"--presumably merely
 ceremonial--sphere of activity.
 The result of a compromise of
 this kind would be to place the
 opposition leaders in charge of
 the country  in  a  few  months
 rather  than  immediately,  and
 there  are  strong  indications
 that  this course is being pushed
 by Cairo.
 The presentation to the
 Arab League Council of the Leb-
 anese complaint of UAR inter-
 ference was merely a gesture
 of the traditional kind toward
 the idea that Arab unity must
 be preserved.   The Lebanese
 expected nothing to come from
 it, and the UAR is reported to
 have persuaded the league sec-
 retariat to name Bengazi, Libya:;
 as the  scene of the meeting be-
 cause of the lack of facilities
 for direct reporting from there.
 The council on 4 June agreed
 to send a "fact-finding" com-
 mission to Lebanon if the Leb-
 anese withdraw their complaint
 in the UN Security Council.
 Even if the Lebanese Government
 should accept this proposal, it

 would try to keep a door open
 for UN action. F77        I
 SINO-SOVIET BLOC DISPUTE WITH YUGOSLAVIA
 Khrushchev's Endorsement
 Khrushchev'"s attack on Yu-
 goslav heresies delivered before
 the Bulgarian party congress on
 3 June virtually excludes all
 possibility of an early recon-
 ciliation between Moscow and
 Belgrade.   He upheld the 1948
 Cominform resolution expelling
 Yugoslavia,   endorsed-in un-
 equivocal language the Chinese
 Communist "hard line" toward
 the Yugoslav leaders, and as-
 serted that the bloc is united
 against Yugoslav "revisionism."

 SECRET
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 5 June 1958
 His harsh statements increase
 the pressure on Gomulka to con-
 form to the basic line already
 espoused by the Soviet press:
 that Yugoslav heresies cannot
 be tolerated.
 The Soviet premier's ad-
 dress was intended in part to
 bring unity out of the diversity
 of bloc commentaries on Yugo-
 slavia, both by extending his
 own approval to the harsher at-
 tacks made by the Chinese and
 by his establishment of a basic
 position on Yugoslavia to which
 such countries as Poland would
 be expected to conform.   Not
 only has bloc propaganda on Yu-
 goslavia varied in recent weeks,
 but the Yugoslavs have asserted
 that Poland and Hungary argued
 strongly against a "hard line"
 toward Belgrade during the re-
 cent Moscow meetings.
 Avoiding vituperation and
 epithets, Khrushchev devoted
 his speech to discrediting Yu-
 goslavia in the eyes of the
 bloc parties by "proving" that
 Yugoslav policies were ideolog-
 ically bankrupt.   Presumably
 as a warning to the satellites,
 particularly Poland, Khrushchev
 again spelled out the dangers
 inherent in Communist states
 accepting Western aid.  He em-
 phasized that cooperation on is-
 sues of foreign policy was no
 substitute for ideological con-
 formity as a prerequisite for
 membership in the "socialist
 camp."   Khrushchev's assertion
 that, if party relations are
 impossible, Moscow wants "normal
 state relations" with Belgrade
 appears to mean that there will
 not be a complete breakdown in
 state relations, but that such
 manifestations of cordial rela-
 tions as economic aid and high-
 level exchanges of visits will
 cease.
 Yugoslav Reaction
 Khrushchev's remarks came
 as no surprise to Belgrade,
 where he has been regarded as
 the prime mover behind the anti-
 Yugoslav campaign.   Yugoslavia
 now will probably abandon its
 defensive attitude in the dis-
 pute.   The sharpness of Yugoslav
 press attacks in the wake of
 the Soviet decision to "postpone"
 credits for the second time--a
 tone not evidenced following the
 first postponement 14 months
 ago--indicates that the Tito re-
 gime is starting a campaign de-
 signed to embarrass the USSR,
 particularly in its economic. re-
 lations abroad.   Yugoslav rep-
 resentatives in Moscow have ad-
 vised "neutral" embassies there
 that Soviet "aid without strings"
 is a myth and should be accepted
 only with "open eyes."
 Yugoslav charges that Mos-
 cow's unilateral cancellation
 of its economic agreements with
 Belgrade violates the principle
 of "higher forms of mutual co-
 operation"  already have re-
 ceived support from influential
 sections of the Indian press.
 Belgrade has subsequently noti-
 fied the USSR that unless the
 credits are restored, it will
 be compelled to "claim compensa-
 tion for losses suffered."
 Khrushchev's denial in Sofia
 that the "struggle for peace"
 is a common objective that brings
 the USSR and Yugoslavia together
 will probably mark the end of
 the automatic endorsement of So-
 viet foreign policy by Belgrade.
 On 2 June Belgrade's Politika,
 in attacking Moscow's rejection
 of the Belgrade declaration of
 1955, declared that "if the So-
 viet Union is unable to exist
 side by side with socialist Yu-
 goslavia--how can it cooperate

 on a lasting basis with coun-
 tries with different ideologies
 and radically different social
 systems?"  To date the Yugoslavs
 have withheld any comment on
 Moscow's announced troop with-
 drawals from Eastern Europe and
 proposed cuts in bloc armed
 forces--a negative attitude
 virtually without precedent
 since the rapprochement with
 Moscow began in 1955.
 Poland's Attitude
 The Poles reportedly had
 regarded Khrushchev's previous
 silence on Yugoslavia as a hope-
 ful sign that the dispute with
 Belgrade could be contained.
 However, his endorsement of
 the 1948 resolution--a declara-
 tion Gomulka has steadfastly
 refused to recognize as legit-
 imate--swings the official bloc
 line even further away from
 Gomulka's.
 In view of Khrushchev's
 declaration at Sofia that devia-
 tions in questions of ideology
 "will not be tolerated" within
 the camp,  pressures for Poland
 to conform probably will mount.
 Moscow may not take an extreme
 position with Warsaw, however,
 feeling that the internal Pol-
 ish  situation compels it to
 allow Poland certain liberties
 it would not permit the other
 satellites. A high-level Polish
 Foreign Ministry official de-
 clared recently that Poland in-
 tends to continue to develop
 closer economic ties with the
 Yugoslavs  and,where feasible,
 expand its trade with the West.
 Peiping Continues Attack
 Peiping's determination
 to persevere in its anti-Tito
 polemics was underscored in
 the first issue of the Chinese
 party's new theoretical jour-
 nal, Red Flag, which appeared
 on 1 3une`ed Flag asserts
 that "it is impossible to end
 this struggle here" in view of
 Belgrade's persistence in chal-
 lenging orthodox principles.
 The Red Flag article is
 probably a-full-exposition of
 Mao Tse-tung's own views, as
 it is written by his most active
 eulogizer,  politburo alternate
 Chen Po-ta.   It continues the
 Chinese practice of distinguish-
 ing between Yugoslav leaders
 and the populace and makes the
 first derogatory comments on
 internal Yugoslav developments
 to come from any bloc country
 in the current dispute.
 This sharp tone avoids
 the balanced cast of Chinese
 statements in 1956 and early
 1957, which were turned against
 Moscow by certain East European
 Communists.   The Chinese seem
 especially concerned over the
 danger that a Titoist infection
 might spread to other Communist
 countries and to Poland in par-
 ticular.   The Chinese Red Flag
 article repeated Soviet crib
 cism of Belgrade for accepting
 American aid, probably an im-
 plied warning to Warsaw.
 The Yugoslavs are con-
 vinced that the difference in
 the intensity of Peiping's and
 Moscow's attacks has no  prac-
 tical significance on the policy
 level and that they are the
 victims of a concerted Sino-
 Soviet attack rather than one
 initiated by Peiping alone.
 Peiping's first formal move in
 the current dispute--its refusal
 to   send  an  official  delega-
 tion                                                            to  the Yugoslav congress
 --followed Moscow's   5  April
 letter   to  Tito   announcing a
 similar decision,   although in-
 tense                                                             Soviet  criticism  of
 the  Yugoslav leadership  did
 not  appear  until  after that
 of  the Chinese.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 SOVIET DISARMAMENT
 Moscow, in agreeing to
 participate in technical dis-
 cusSions on a control system for
 the suspension of nuclear tests,
 has reiterated its willingness
 to consider the installation of
 inspection posts on Soviet ter-
 ritory.   While bloc leaders con-
 tinue to urge a summit meeting
 publicly,  the USSR still in-
 sists on maintaining a veto
 over the agenda items to be
 di.-cussed.
 f~   dhrushchev's letter of 30
 May to President Eisenhower ac-
 cepted the plan for technical
 talks and suggested that Poland
 and Czechoslovakia be included
 to balance Britain and France
 and  that  India and perhaps
 other nations also be included.
 In recommending that the experts
 reach an agreement within four
 weeks, Khrushchev was reiterat-
 ing the Soviet claim that the
 West would use the talks to de-
 lay indefinitely negotiations
 at the summit for an  end  to
 tests.
 On the same day Khrushchev,
 in a letter to the Canadian
 prime minister, emphasized So-
 viet willingness to discuss in
 the talks the number of control
 posts and their specific dis-
 position in the territories of
 the countries concerned.   On
 the other hand, Khrushchev re-
 peated the standard Soviet ar-
 gument that such control posts
 are unnecessary for detecting
 AND SUMMIT TACTICS
 any nuclear explosion wherever
 it occurs.   Soviet willingness
 to hold talks on controls as a
 preliminary step suggests that
 the USSR will actually offer a
 detailed plan for inspection,
 one which it would be willing
 to implement.
 The Soviet plan will prob-
 ably fall far short of the
 elaborate controls that the
 West considers desirable.   If
 an agreed inspection plan does
 not emerge from the discussions,
 Moscow-.will then probably try
 to convince world opinion that
 the West is blocking test sus-
 pension by making unreasonable
 and unrealistic inspection de-
 mands.                                                         An intensified Soviet
 propaganda campaign on the ease
 of detecting nuclear explosions
 can be expected during the tech-
 nical talks.
 The USSR presumably would
 like to use its proposed agenda
 for a summit meeting as the ba-
 sis for discussion, to incor-
 porate those Western proposals
 that are closely related, and
 to exclude the remaining Western
 topics--particularly Germany
 and Eastern Europe.   The USSR
 apparently still  believes that
 the discussions should be trans-
 ferred as soon as possible to
 the foreign ministers' level,
 where the issues would receive
 more publicity, but has not yet
 found a way to achieve this.
 KHRUSHCHEV AND COMMUNIST IDEOLOGY
 Khrushchev appears to be
 showing increased interest in
 Communist ideology, and Izvestia
 has identified him personally
 with doctrinal innovations.
 This portrayal of him as a the-
 oretician adds to the growing
 number of  fields  in  which
 Khrushchev is being depicted as

 spokesman.   Concomitantly there
 has been a decrease in the num-
 ber of references to collective
 leadership in the party presid-
 ium.
 On 12 May,  Izvestia hailed
 Khrushchev's plan to Ml ma-
 chine tractor station machinery
 to the collective farms as a
 "most important and revolution-
 ary step in the development of
 socialist agriculture," ranking
 second in importance only to
 Lenin's concept of collectivi-
 zation.   The article claimed
 Khrushchev has shown both ma-
 chine tractor stations and col-
 lective farms to be socialist
 forms of property and had there-
 by made a "vital contribution
 to theory."  He has "resolutely
 refuted"  those  critics who
 have advanced the "incorrect and
 dogmatic view" that the move was
 a doctrinal step backward  be-
 cause it would strengthen co-
 operative property (the collec-
 tive farms) at the expense of
 socialist property. Izvestia's
 strong language seems too leave
 little room for further ideologi-
 cal contention on this issue.
 Three days after the Iz-
 vestia article was publisher,
 RE-r-u-s-Vehev's protege  Aleksey
 Rumyantsev was named chief edi-
 tor of the new international
 Communist journal soon to begin
 publication in Prague.   He is
 one of four former Ukrainian
 party officials who were appoint-
 ed to head  departments in the
 Soviet party central committee
 after Khrushchev's assumption
 of the party first secretaryship.
 He became director of the De-
 partment' of Science and Culture
 in 1954, and since the fall of
 1955 has been editor in chief
 of the central committee journal
 Kommunist.   The  implications
 of his new assignment seem clear:
 what could become the most au-
 thoritative mouthpiece of world
 Communism is headed by an ex-
 perienced Soviet propagandist
 whose loyalty to Khrushchev
 seems certain.
 Rumyantsev was succeeded
 as Kommunist chief editor by
 F. V.   ons antinov, a  well-
 known ideologist and former
 boss of the central committee's
 Department of Propaganda and
 Agitation (Agitprop) for the
 union republics.   Although he
 appeared to have been on the
 wrong side of the Malenkov-
 Khrushchev controversy over
 light and heavy industry in late
 1954,   Konstantinov  was named
 rector of the Soviet Academy
 of  Social Sciences  in March
 1955, shortly after Malenkov
 was ousted as  premier. He could
 hardly have succeeded to this
 post had he been opposed by
 Khrushchev.   By the following
 autumn, he had become chief of
 Agitprop.
 The Agitprop department for
 the union republics  is  now
 run    by Leonid  Ilichev.  Also
 a propagandist, he has served
 at various times as chief editor
 of Pravda and of Izvestia, and
 during 1948-49 was-  eeputy chief
 of Agitprop under Mikhail Suslov.
 Since  1953,   he  has   been
 chief  of  the  Foreign  Min-
 istry's press department, where
 he was assigned to replace a
 henchmen of former secret police
 chief Lavrenty Beria.  Unlike
 Rumyantsev or Konstantinov,
 however, there is nothing  in
 Ilichev's career to suggest he
 is more closely tied to Khru-
 shchev than to other members of
 the party hierarchy.

 Both the Izvestia article
 and the personnel sfiifts are
 obviously advantageous to Khru-
 shchev.                        He has never displayed
 a particular interest in ideol-
 ogy, but he may now feel a need
 to establish his reputation as
 a theoretician and to strengthen
 the ideological basis for the
 programs and policies which he
 formulates.
 KHRUSHCHEV'S SOVIET-US TRADE PROPOSAL
 Khrushchev's letter to
 President Eisenhower calling for
 an official trade agreement and
 proposing exchanges worth "sev-
 eral billion dollars in the next
 few years" is intended to dem-
 onstrate to the world a "con-
 ciliatory" attitude toward the
 United States and to emphasize
 Moscow's repeated proposals for
 discussing international trade
 at the summit and for holding'
 an international economic con-
 ference.
 The proposals seem
 primarily
 politically inspired.
 However,
 in the case
 of certain
 types of
 industrial
 equipment,
 of which
 Soviet purchases are
 potentially very large, American
 technology is superior to that
 of other Western countries.
 This is particularly true in the
 fields of iron ore concentration
 and in the construction of large-
 diameter, long-distance pipe-
 lines.
 The letter points out that
 the USSR requires equipment and
 complete factories--industrial
 equipment it has recently been
 shopping for in Western Europe--
 to increase further its output
 of consumer goods, including
 synthetic fibers and plastics.
 Khrushchev offers immediate or-
 ders for refrigeration and air-
 conditioning equipment; equip-
 ment for cellulose, paper, wood-
 processing, textile, leather
 footwear, and food industries;
 television equipment; pumps and
 compressors; mining machinery,
 and transportation and construc-
 tion equipment.
 "Additional big orders could
 be placed" for equipment for
 rolling ferrous metals and pipe,
 chemical products, and consum-
 er goods.  The USSR offers to
 deliver goods of interest to
 the United States, including
 manganese and chromium ores,
 ferrous alloys, platinum, pal-
 ladium, asbestos, lumber, cel-
 lulose and paper products, chem-
 icals, and furs.  American im-
 ports of such commodities now
 total about $2 billion annually;
 while some of these items had
 been imported from the USSR
 prior to  1949,   alternative
 sources of supply, many of which
 are in underdeveloped countries,
 have since been established.
 In 1956, Soviet-US trade
 totaled $28,200,000.   Soviet
 purchases from the United States
 consisted of $1,200,000 worth
 of seed corn, $1,000,000 in
 industrial machinery, $800,000
 in agricultural equipment, and
 $800,000 worth of miscellaneous
 commodities.  Soviet sales to
 the United States in that year
 consisted of $10,500,000 worth
 of chemicals, $7,300,000 in furs,
 3,400,000 in platinum, and
 3,200,000 worth of miscellane-
 ous items.

 for several months.   In press
 interviews, Khrushchev also has
 given heavy emphasis to the
 Sino-Soviet bloc's'ability to
 "liquidate on a healthy basis"
 the American industrial reces-.
 sion by the purchase of "great
 volumes" of American goods. He
 may believe the proposals will
 excite strong interest in Amer-
 ican business circles, as did
 similar proposals in British
 industry in 1956, and contrast
 to the World the alleged :weak
 American economy with the al-
 leged strong Soviet economy.
 The USSR presumably would
 characterize an American refusal
 to consider the proposals seri-
 ously as evidence of unwilling-
 ness to ease tensions between
 the free world countries and
 the Communist bloc. It is prob-
 ably aware that any American ef-
 fort to further US-bloc trade
 as proposed by the letter could
 be construed by present Amer-
 ican sources of the commodities
 offered as an effort by the
 United States to reduce its
 internal economic problem at the
 expense of other free world coun-
 tries.
 The list of plants the USSR
 purportedly is seeking contains
 some equipment now subject to
 COCOM trade controls, and Mos-
 cow probably hopes its proposal
 to the United States will re-
 sult in a further relaxation of
 cooperation within COCOM, now
 reviewing trade control policy
 in Paris.
 Khrushchev's letter also
 emphasizes that the resumption
 of trade with the United States
 in "considerable dimension"
 would require that Washington
 make both long- and short-term
 loans available, since US-sup-
 ported trade restrictions had
 created "certain difficulties"
 for traders which could not be
 quickly dispelled.   This is in
 direct variance with Khrushchev's  25X1
 statement on 3 June in Sofia
 warning that all Western credits
 1
 Soviet interest in expand-
 ing petroleum exports to the
 West was again noted in May when
 the USSR renewed an invitation
 to a Swedish engineering firm
 to bid on a major 1,900-mile
 oil pipeline system from the
 Urals-Volga oil fields to the
 Baltic Sea with branch lines to
 Eastern Europe.   The current
 Soviet program for building oil
 and gas pipelines is apparently
 utilizing the USSR's full capac-
 ity for such construction.
 In January the USSR an-
 nounced a plan to build a ma-
 jor oil depot on the Baltic Sea
 near Klaipeda (Memel), Lithuania
 It now appears that the pipe-
 line system up for bids will
 supply this oil depot, and that
 this system is in addition to
 the sizable program of oil and
 gas pipelines called for in the
 Sixth Five-Year Plan (1956-1960).
 Subsequent revisions have in-
 creased the plan for gas pipe-
 lines and decreased that for
 oil pipelines but have not in-
 creased the over-all total, sug-
 gesting that the original plan
 constituted the USSR's maximum
 capacity for pipeline construc-
 tion between 1956 and 1960.
 The main section of the
 proposed pipeline is to run from
 a point referred to in Soviet
 specifications as Point b, near
 Tuymazy in the Urals-Volga area,
 west to a point--called Point B
 --believed to be near Panevezhis,
 a distance of about 1,100 miles.
 This 24-inch pipeline is to have
 a capacity of 18,000,000 tons
 per year of gas oil or 9,000,-
 000 of residual fuel oil.   For
 the remaining 135 miles to Memel,
 the USSR specifies a smaller line

 Oil pipeline proposed
 with a capacity of about one
 half that of the main pipeline.
 The capacity of the smaller
 line could later be increased
 by one third by additional pumps.
 Two additional branch
 lines from the Panevezhis area
 are each to have a capacity of
 6,000,000 tons of gas oil. One
 of these is to run 260 miles
 to Poland.  Warsaw, which is
 the proposed location of a large
 new refinery, is the probable
 terminal.   The other branch
 line is described as extending
 "330 miles" to Yugoslavia.   The
 nearest point in Yugoslavia,
 however, is over 620 miles from
 the point near Panevezhis.
 The specifications provide
 not only for the construction
 of pipelines but also for equip-
 ment needed to heat, pump,  and
 store the oil.   They call for
 470,000 metric tons of steel
 pipe alone, and it can be rough-
 ly estimated that the cost of
 the completed pipeline system,
 would be $300,000,000 to $350,-
 000,000.
 The proposed pipelines
 and port facilities on the Bal-
 tic Sea at Memel and planned
 refineries would put the USSR
 in a favorable position to sell
 its oil in northern Europe.
 It could probably capture a
 sufficient share of the expand-
 ing market for petroleum in
 nonbloc northern European coun-
 tries to operate the proposed
 pipeline to Memel at its rated
 capacity of 9,000,000 tons of
 gas oil per year.   In addition,
 the branch line to Poland would
 greatly reduce the  present

 of the appointees had worked
 outside Moscow and hence bring
 to their posts an understanding
 of post-reorganization condi-
 tions in areas away from the
 center.   Three are former re-
 gional party functionaries.
 The decentralization of
 the industrial administration
 last summer, which has resulted
 in the creation of 58 regional
 economic councils in the Russian
 Republic, considerably increased
 the importance of the RSFSR
 Council of Ministers in coordi-
 nating and controlling indus-
 trial production.   The designa-
 tion of Leningrad party boss
 Frol Kostlov as premier of the
 republic last December was both
 a reflection of the enhanced
 status of this post and a move
 to bolster the effectiveness of
 the RSFSR administration.
 In late March, at the time
 of the formation of the new
 Khrushchev government, Kozlov
 became a first deputy chairman
 of the USSR Council of Ministers,
 and D. S. Polyansky was named
 to replace him as RSFSR premier.
 Polyansky, a full member of the
 party central committee,.has
 had extensive experience as a
 regional party chief in the
 Ukraine, Chkalov Oblast, and,
 most recently, in Krasnodar
 Kra y .
 In late February, N. N.
 Organov and N. A. Dygay replaced
 V. A. Maslov and K. M. Sokolov
 as deputy chairmen of the RSFSR
 Council of Ministers.   Organov,
 who,is a member of the party
 central committee, served suc-
 cessively since 1948 as first
 secretary of Primorye Kray and
 Krasnoyarsk Kray.   Dygay, a con-
 struction engineer, was USSR
 minister of construction until
 the ministry was abolished in
 May 1957, when he became RSFSR
 minister of construction.   He
 is a candidate member of the
 party central committee.   Dygay's
 deputy, Mikhail F. Madtocky,
 replaced him as RSFSR minister
 of construction.   On 28 March,
 Vasily M. Ryabikov, a candidate
 member of the party central com-
 mittee, was also appointed a
 deputy chairman of the RSFSR
 Council of Ministers.   Ryabikov
 was last identified in March
 1946 as a deputy minister of
 armaments.
 On 9 May, it was announced
 that N. K. Baybakov,  long a prom-
 inent industrial and planning
 official, had been replaced as
 RSFSR planning chief by V. N.
 Novikov, in "connection with
 his transfer to other work."
 Press criticism of the operations
 of RSFSR Gosplan and personal
 criticism of Baybakov in the 9
 May issue of Building Gazette
 for his handling o  Investments
 while minister of the petroleum
 industry prior to 1955 suggest
 that he may be in disfavor. The
 appointment as RSFSR Gosplan
 head of Novikov,  onetime  minis-
 ter of general machine building
 and most recently chairman of
 the Leningrad regional economic
 council, is probably a move to
 improve the crucial and often
 criticized Gosplan-sovnarkhoz
 relationship, since he is inti-
 mately familiar with sovnarkhoz
 operational problems.   Aleksandr
 Damrachev, who replaced Novikov
 as Leningrad Sovnarkhoz chief,
 has been appointed an RSFSR min-
 ister.
 Most recently, on 2 June,
 A. I. Popov replaced T. M.
 Zuyeva as RSFSR minister of cul-
 ture.   For the last several
 years Popov has been a secretary
 of the Leningrad Oblast party
 committee with general responsi-
 bility for propaganda, education-
 al,  and cultural matters.
 While each personnel shift
 has its own rationale, the sum
 total of the various moves is
 a refurbishing of the RSFSR gov-
 ernmental. leadership by offi-
 cials who have had.recent. ex-

 The principal economic ef-

 27 May and tantamount to can-
