 THIS MATERIAL CONTAINS INFORMATION AFFECTING THE NATIONAL
 DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
 ESPIONAGE LAWS, TITLE 18, USC., SECS. 793 AND 794, THE
 TRANSMISSION OR REVELATION OF WHICH IN ANY MANNER TO AN
 UNAUTHORIZED PERSON IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.
 French object to American disarmament proposal:  The
 French Foreign     ice fears that the  i.sarmamen  p an which
 the United States recently submitted to the French, British
 and Canadian UN delegations contains "grave pitfalls."  The
 French object specifically to a reduction in armed forces
 based on a percentage of each country's population because
 they think such a system would permit the Soviet bloc to
 overwhelm the West. F_                   7                     25X1
 Comment:   The British thought that the American pro-
 posal washeavily weighted in favor of NATO and the British
 Commonwealth against the USSR, and have already proposed a
 modification which distinguishes between metropolitan and
 overseas areas.   They expect the Russians to reject the pro-
 posal in any case, and the modification suggested removes
 an occasion for a Soviet propaganda blast.
 The French presumably are not considering any of South
 Asia as pro-Western.

 2.            Hungarian party leader reportedly suffering heart
 condition :      e U    egation at Budapest speculates on press
 silence regarding Jozsef Revai, Minister of People's Culture
 and Deputy Secretary General of the Hungarian Workers'
 Party.   Revai was last mentioned by the press on 4 March.
 Reliable information stated that he has not been purged, but
 i     convalescing from a bad heart condition.                               25X1
 Comment:   This information confirms previous reports
 that Revai suffered from a heart condition that necessitated
 sick leaves in 1949 and 1950.  His non-appearance at the
 Liberation Day ceremonies on 4 April has caused comment.

 Revai is a top ranking member of the Hungarian Communist
 hierarchy and the leading Party theoretician.   Allegedly he
 belongs to the Gero wing of the party in opposition to Party
 leader Rakosi.   The disappearance of the fifty-four-year-old
 Revai might strengthen the position of Rakosi, whose own purg-
 ing has been a subject of speculation.
 3.         Renewed collectivization campaign continues in Rumania:
 The American Legation in Bucharest reports that the Rumanians
 have announced the formation of 25 new collective farms with
 nearly 1,000 families between 1 and 7 May.
 Comment:   Fewer than 100 collective farms were estab-
 lished in Rumania during all of 1951, and only six of those
 were formed after September.   During the first quarter of
 1952,  130 new collective farms were set up.
 The regime weakened the peasants economically by con-
 fiscating their savings in the January currency reform and
 now appears to be stepping up their incorporation into col-
 lective farms.
 25X1
 4.          Deportations from Rumanian cities continue:   The Amer-
 ican Legation in Bucharest reports that evacuations of
 "some hundreds" of persons from the Transylvanian cities of
 Stalin (Brasov) and Alba Iulia in central Rumania have been
 confirmed.   The destination of the evacuees is said to'be
 upper Moldavia in the northeast part of the country.
 Movement from Bucharest is reportedly still compara-
 tively slow, but a ste -                              rum red to be -up-in deportations is scheduled for 15 May. T                                                  25X1
 Comment:  This is the first confirmation of evacuations
 from cries other than Bucharest, although previous reports
 have stated that all large Rumanian industrial centers are
 to be cleared of political undesirables and unproductive per-
 sons in order to provide housing for the expanding industrial
 labor force,

 FAR EAST
 5.          Yoshida gives views on current Japanese problems:  Prime
 Minister Yoshida  e  eves that it is "too early"  o approach
 the Japanese  people with proposals for a                 constitutional
 amendment to permit rearmament, according to American Ambassa-
 dor Murphy.                     Yoshida said that his people must be indoctrinated
 over a period of time, and that the creation of a government
 information agency to deal with such matters is being studied.
 In the same conversation, Yoshida discounted the danger
 of Communist penetration of trade unions, despite the ascen-
 sion of extreme left-wing elements to power in the labor
 movement.   He added that criticism of United States policy by
 the opposition parties should be construed as a tactic to em-
 barrass the Yoshida Government.
 The government is "preoccupied" with Communist and left-
 wing influences among Japanese university students, according
 to Yoshida, much of which comes from the f            mbers
 having a "wrong attitude."
 b.           Composition of Chinese Communist Secretariat reported:
 The composition of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of
 the Chinese Communist Party is now believed to be:
 Mao Tse-tung, chairman; Liu Shao-chi, secretary; Chou
 En-lai, deputy secretary;  Chu Teh, Peng Teh-huai and Chen Yung
 members; and Kao Kang and Peng Chen, alternate members.
 Comment:   The Secretariat is elected by the Central
 Commit ee to      andle its routine activities.   The chairman of
 the Central Committee, Mao Tse-tung, serves concurrently as
 chairman of the Politburo and Secretariat.
 The presence of Liu Shao-chi and Chou En-lai on the
 Secretariat has been confirmed by official party documents.
 It is probable that Liu and Chou, second and third in the Chinese
 hierarchy,'occupy the second and third places in the Secretariat.
 With the exception of Peng Teh-huai, commander of the 1st
 Field Army, the above list of mamhers is identical with a list
 obtained by                                         It appears to be
 Peiping's nn  cy not to place any field army commander on
 either the Politburo or the Secretariat.

 7.          Chinese Communists move five armies to East China:  At
 a Taipei Briefing for Admiral   a  or  , t e Minister of National
 Defense pointed out that recent Communist preparations for
 the invasion of Formosa have included the movement of the 4th,
 7th, 67th and 78th Armies to the Shantung peninsula and the 11th
 Army to Kwangtung. F_                          I           25X1
 Comment:   If confirmed, this report would represent an
 increaseseof T50,000 troops on the East China coast.  However,
 current order of battle information shows that the Communist
 78th Army has never been identified and that the 67th Army is
 located in Korea.   Moreover, the other three armies are loca-
 ted in western China.
 8.          American Minister says French face basic decision in
 Indochina:  The American Minister in  aigon believes that
 unless the French and the Vietnamese Governments now make a
 "supreme effort" to execute a substantial reform program in
 Indochina, the French will have to negotiate with the enemy,
 broaden Western support, or continue the present stalemate.
 Minister-Resident Letourneau, in order to dispel Viet-
 namese distrust, is now prepared to bring into the government
 nationalist elements with anti-French records.  Furthermore,
 Paris is willing to permit the French Union to evolve into
 something more like the British Commonwealth.   The American
 Minister points out, however, that even if all French
 restraints were removed, no prospective Vietnamese leadership
 could of itself produce immediate results withou     onstant
 United States pressure.
 Comment:   Letourneau has previously expressed opposition
 to fur  ei r political concessions to  Vietnam so long as
 military operations are in,progress.

 9.           Letter indicating readiness of Huk leader to defect
 Philippine  overnmen  declared false:     letter allegedly
 written by the Huk leader, Luis   aruc, indicating his disil-
 lusionment with Communism has been declared false by Philippine
 Defense Secretary Magsaysay'.   Prior to its publication in a
 Manila weekly, the letter was shown to Magsaysay who initially
 believed it might be genuine.   The letter may have been ori-
 ginated by a Taruc sympathizer in order to create false peace
 -hopes  mon  the Filipinos.                                                  25X1

 `10.           Indonesia preparing to open embassy in Moscow:   Indonesian
 Foreign Minister  u ar o told the Foreign Affairs Section of
 Parliament that preparations are under way for an exchange of
 ambassadors between Indonesia and Soviet Russia.   In referring
 to the exchange, government officials have emphasized to Ameri-
 can Embassycfficers that all privileges, such as size of
 mission and o  ortunities for travel,       be "strictly
 reciprocal."
 Comment:  The present government's decision to exchange
 diplomats with Soviet Russia is a further indication of its
 intention to return to a strict interpretation of Indonesia's
 "independent" foreign policy.   The former cabinet opposed
 having a Soviet embassy in Djakarta.
 The proposed insistence upon reciprocal privileges
 undoubtedly arises chiefly from Indonesia's experience with
 Communist China, and the latter's refusal to permit the same
 freedom of movement to the Indonesian Embassy in Peiping as
 is exercised by the Chinese Embassy in Djakarta.

 11.          Soviet broadcast to Central Asia raises subject of
 Kashmir s in :pen ence:      ussian- anguage  roa cas  o  10
 May from Moscow to Soviet Central Asia discussed the Kashmiri
 people's efforts to free themselves from foreign domination.
 It stated that "the liberation movement" in Kashmir has been
 mounting since the end of World War II.   The broadcast des-
 cribed the steps being taken by the United States and Britain
 "to prevent the Kashmiri people from taking their fate into
 their own hands."
 Soviet delegate Malik's 17 January speech before the UN
 Security Council was also recalled, and Malik was quoted as
 saying that only the Constituent Assembly could decide the
 future status of Kashmir.    The broadcast ended with the remark
 that "the Kashmiri people indignantly resent these imperialist
 plans and continue the struggle for real independence of their
 country." F_                   I
 Comment:   The USSR is apparently continuing a campaign
 reliably reported last January to be underway in Kashgar and
 other cities of Sinkiang for the "liberation" of the two
 Kashmir border provinces of Gilgit and Ladakh.   Chinese

 12.          Greek left-of-center paper fills in for Communist press:
 EPEK newspaper, AlIRghi, has followed a consistently pro-
 Communist line since its appearance in August 1951.   Its refer-
 ences to the Soviet Union always have been favorable and its
 treatment of the Greek Communists and left-wingers has been
 sympathetic.   It has taken every opportunity to present an
 unfavorable picture of the United States, emphasizing American
 "imperialist tendencies" and "aggression."
 The American Embassy in Athens which made a study of
 the paper comments that although its bias is expressed indirectly,
 there is little doubt that it is now fillip  in admirably  for
 the outlawed Communist press.                                             125X1
 Comment:   Prime Minister Plastiras' EPEK Party claimed
 Allaghi as is mouthpiece when it was founded.  Although there
 s3  no evidence of direct Communist control or support of
 Allaghi, both its owner and director Nicolas Papapolitis and his
 brother Savvas, the Minister of Commerce, have a history of
 Communist affiliations.   Both are currently described as
 holding pro-Communist views and the director of Savvas' poli-
 tical bureau is the brother of a guerrilla leader.   Allaghi's,
 circulation jumped 100 percent when the Communist front
 Dimokratiki was suppressed.
 British troops in maneuvers with the Arab Legion:   A
 battalion group from the lFritish Independent  arac u e Brigade
 in the Suez Canal zone held a two-day training exercise with
 units of the Arab Legion in Jordan on 12 and 13 May.   The
 object of the exercise, which included parachute drops, of
 troops, weapons and vehicles, was for the parachute group   to
 hold a certain defined area against action by Arab Legion
 forces.
 The Jordan Government agreed to the presence of British
 troops. in accordance with the joint training facilities clause
 in the annex to the Ang]n-Jordan treaty.   The American Lega-
 tion in Amman considers t   s    step     bolster British pres-
 tige in the Middle East.

 Comment:   The British have been paying increasing
 attention t-
 omaking the Arab Legion a more effective and use-
 ful force.  Over the last five years the annual subsidy for
 the Legion has been tripled to the present 7.5 million pounds.
 Besides better training and equipment, the program involves a
 build-up of reserve strength to permit rapid expansion of the
 Legion in case of need.

 14.  Figl discusses Austrian peace treaty and Trieste issue with
 Eden:   In a conversation with Foreign Secretary   en during his
 goodwill visit to London last week, Austrian Chancellor Figi said
 that Austria might appeal to the United Nations about a peace
 treaty.   He also told Eden that Austria was particularly anxious
 for a settlement in Trieste for economic reasons.   Figl said that
 if Austrian shipping could not move through Trieste, it would have
 to depend more and more on the Rhine River outlet, and this might
 lead to closer political ties with West Germany.
 British spokesmen said that the Foreign Office would
 continue to discourage any Austrian appeal to the United Nations.
 The American Embassy was not informed about Eden's comments on
 Trieste and Figl's conversation with Churchill.                        25X1

 crowd of 30,000 attending a garden show.   The demonstrators
 carried no placards or posters, but shouted their views until
 300 reserve police, stationed there because of advance knowledge
 of the demonstration, tried to disperse them with loud-speakers
 and clubs.
 The Communists thereupon attacked the police with bottles,
 stones, and pistol shots.   The police then fired, first over,
 then later into the demonstrators,                boy and injuring
 three others.
 Comment:  American press reports stated that 30,000 Com-
 munist`s had rioted in Essen.   The use of pistols is something
 new in Communist tactics in West Germany.
 East German Deputy Premier Ulbricht used the incident in
 his 12 May speech hinting at action against West Berlin, when
 he declared that "the inhuman attack by the police of Interior
 Minister Lehr" showed how the German people would fare if
 Chancellor Adena.uer succeeded in putting the "General War Agree-
 ment" into effect.

 16.         Netherlands insists on right to withdraw from Defense Com-
 munity:                           utc  Foreign Minister Stikker states t Eat the Net erlands
 s osu d have some assurance. that it could withdraw from the Defense
 Community should a West European federation not be achieved
 within 17 years and should NATO be dissolved.   Stikker adds that
 Belgium, Luxembourg, and possibly Italy will Join the Netherlands
 if it insists on this reservation.
 Stikker is concerned that the German financial contribution
 will not be sufficient to permit the British to keep their forces
 in Germany.   The Netherlands is not disturbed at the possibility
 of helping to underwrite the German military build-up.   Stikker
 adds that the Canadian Foreign Minister seems to favor a proposal
 for Canada to give economic aid to Britain to make up its  possible
 loss from reduced support costs.                                          25X1
 Comment:   The Netherlands views the presence of British
 troops in Germany as emphasis of British intentions to remain
 closely associated with Western European defense.   The Dutch
 fear that the British for economic reasons might withdraw their
 troops as the German units come into being, thus preventing a
 net increase in Allied troop strength on the Continent.
 17.         British aircraft production delayed by lag in American
 machine too   a  ver es:. The British government has forma ly
 advised the Mutual Security Agency that production of the latest
 type jet fighters and light bombers may be delayed 9 to 12 more
 months because American machine tools are not being delivered.
 on schedule.  The US Military Assistance Advisory Group (My.G)
 in London, justifying the need for these tools, lists seven'
 specific orders placed between December 1950 and March 1951
 which are needed especially to speed up production.
 This additional postponement is viewed as most serious by
 MAAG because production and financial difficulties have already
 caused a reduction of thirteen squadrons in RAF 1954 planning
 goals for commitment to NATO.                                             25X1
 Comment:  According to the study of British aircraft
 production capabilities made by MAAG for NATO last fall,
 shortage of machine tools was not considered a likely bottle-
 neck if current orders were delivered on schedule.   The new lag
 in delivery has now made this the most critical factor instead
 of labor shortage.

 Mexico's leftist o  osition coalition collapses:  The US
 Embassy in  ex co considers that the proposed tripartite coa-
 lition of opposition parties is now a dead issue.                           Vicente
 Lombardo Toledano has refused to withdraw his presidential
 candidacy in favor of Miguel Henriquez Guzman, though Candido
 Aguilar will probably support the latter.   The failure of the
 three parties to put forward a. single candidate is viewed as a
 victory for the administration candidate, Adolfo Ruiz Cortines.
 Comment:  A highly publicized pact between Lombardo's
 Partidoo- opular, Henriquez' Federacion de Partidos del Pueblo
 Mexicano, and Candido Aguilar's small, unregistered Partido
 de la Revolucion was signed on 2 April.   No agreement was made
 on a single presidential candidate, and, although a joint political
 platform was announced on 8 May, the plan to cooperate in electing
 congressional candidates appears to have fallen through.
 Although Lombardo's refusal to withdraw in favor of
 Henriquez is given as a reason for the coalition breakdown,
 Henriquez might have regarded his official support as a liability
 in view of increasing anti-Communist propaganda.

 Peru protests pro2osed.United States tariff on tuna:  Ap-
 prova   by t e     Senate Finance Committee of a three-    ts-per-
 pound import duty on tuna has brought strong protest from Peru.
 The Foreign Minister, in a note which the US Ambassador termed
 the bitterest received during his three years in Lima,.called
 the proposed tax "economic aggression" and accused the United
 States of trying to destroy Peru's important fishing industry
 which, he said. was built     meet United States needs du i

 Comment:  For several months Peru, as well as five other
 Latinmerican countries, voiced objections to this tax, already
 approved by the House of Representatives.   The Peruvian Congress
 even threatened to retaliate with a bill extending territorial
 waters 200 miles from shore.   In recent weeks optimistic reports
 from Washington temporarily quieted Peruvian protests, but the
 US Embassy in Lima predicted intense reaction should the tax
 meet with further approval.
