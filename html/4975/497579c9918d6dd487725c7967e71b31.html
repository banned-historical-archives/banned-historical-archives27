 VIETNAM
 A captured enemy document indicates that the Viet Cong
 plan to initiate intense military activity immediately
 upon expiration of the Tet cease-fire period on 23 Jan-
 uary.   Although North Vietnam continues to deride US
 efforts to end hostilities,  there is little doubt it
 desires to encourage the longest possible cessation of
 bombing to enable it to repair bomb damage and move
 supplies.
 'HE SHELEPIN MISSION TO HANOI
 The results of the mission are not yet clear,  but the
 statements occasioned by the visit suggest that it has
 produced little significant change in Soviet-DRV relations
 or in either side's concept of how the Vietnam conflict
 should be waged.
 BREZHNEV'S VISIT TO MONGOLIA
 The visit apparently was intended to further emphasize
 Peking's isolation in the Communist world,  and to en-
 hance the prestige of the Mongolian leadership.
 COMMUNIST CHINA'S LEADERS OUT OF PUBLIC VIEW
 The protracted absence of both Mao Tse-tung and Liu Shao-
 chi does not necessarily mean they have been seriously
 ill,  but does suggest they are slowing down.
 POLISH CHURCH-STATE STRUGGLE DEEPENS
 Party chief Gomulka and Cardinal. Wyszynski have exchanged
 emotional speeches in the confrontation resulting from
 the cardinal's attempts to open a semipolitical dialogue
 with the German Catholic episcopate.   However,  both pro-
 tagonists have retained room for maneuver.
 EAST GERMANY HARDENS POLICY ON CULTURAL AFFAIRS
 The regime,  which relaxed its rigid cultural policies
 in 1963,  has begun to revert to greater restrictiveness.

 A REVIEW OF THE DOMINICAN ECONOMY
 The Dominican Republic's economy, which has never sup-
 ported most of the population zibove the subsistence
 level,  has been floundering since about 1958.   Any sig-
 nificant economic growth will depend on foreign aid for
 developing and diversifying agriculture, which dominates
 economic activity,  and on correction of budgetary im-
 balance,  disequilibrium in the balance of payments,  and
 inefficiencies in the operation of state-owned enter-
 prises.  (Published separately as Special Report OCI No.

 President Castello Branco's desire to obtain the par-
 ticipation of labor--some 25 million strong--in the pro-
 government National Renewal Alliance,  one of two polit-
 ical groups replacing the old parties abolished late
 last year,  is likely to meet with reserve because of
 labor's widespread dissatisfaction with the government's
 policies.   The regime's relations with labor will become
 increasingly important during the coming months as
 Brazil prepares to transfer power to a new administration.

 SJ C'REI'
 An upsurge of Viet Cong at-
 tacks was reported during the four
 days prior to the Tet holiday
 cease-fire period which began on
 20 January.   Mortar bombardments
 were directed at the provincial
 capitals of Quang Ngai and Quang
 Tin provinces,  and government po-
 sitions near both capitals were
 overrun.   In Binh Dinh Province,
 government forces were attacked
 by an estimated battalion  which,
 according to a prisoner report,
 was an element of the North Viet-
 namese 18th Regiment.   Meanwhile,
 intensified enemy activity near
 Saigon resulted in moderate gov-
 ernment losses and high civilian
 casualties.
 An enemy document dated 4
 January, which was captured by
 allied forces in Hau Nghia Prov-
 ince last week,  indicates that
 the Viet Cong are planning to
 initiate intense military activ-
 ity immediately upon the expira-
 tion of the Tet cease-fire period
 on 23 January. During the holi-
 days,  the Viet Cong apparently
 will generally observe a cease-
 fire with both South Vietnamese
 and allied forces,  although the
 document revealed that a strong
 anti-American propaganda campaign
 will be undertaken during the
 period.
 Political Developments
 in South Vietnam
 A joint communique,  issued
 after Secretary of State Rusk
 had met with Vietnamese Govern-
 ment leaders in Saigon on 16
 January,  stated that the posi-
 tions of the two governments re-
 garding peace in Vietnam were
 consistent in all fundamental
 respects.   The communique noted
 that there were as yet no posi-
 tive responses from Hanoi regard-
 ing recent peace initiatives and
 concluded that the South Viet-
 namese Government and its allies
 must continue all necessary mili-
 tary measures while remaining
 alert for all peace proposals.
 Earlier,  a second convention
 of the Vietnamese armed forces--
 convened by the military regime
 in Saigon and attended by 1,400
 officers--had pledged renewed
 efforts against Communist aggres-
 sion and approved the government's
 domestic program for 1966.   This
 :program included rural construc-
 tion,  control of inflation,and
 preparations for eventual civil-
 ian participation in the govern-
 ment.   At the final and only
 public session of the convention,
 Premier Ky reviewed his first
 seven months in office and an-
 nounced that a civilian  "democracy
 building council" would soon be
 established as an initial step
 toward national elections sched-
 uled for 1967.
 There were allegations of
 dissatisfaction among lower rank-
 ing officers at the convention.
 the rank-and-file delegates

 were not as enthusiastic as at
 the first such gathering last
 September. Some members were re-
 portedly disappointed by the
 Military Directorate's lack of
 response to the delegates' recom-
 mendations at the earlier conven-
 tion,  and others were distracted
 by the forthcoming holiday and
 the US "peace offensive."
 Strong security precautions
 apparently surrounded Ky at the
 convention as a result of reports
 of an assassination plot led by
 retired General Tran Van Don.
 Subsequently, four noncommissioned
 military police officers were
 arrested for involvement in the
 plot,  although the government has
 not yet moved against the alleged
 leaders.
 Hanoi on US Initiatives
 North Vietnamese propaganda
 continued to deride US efforts
 to bring an end to hostilities.
 The Hanoi army daily published a
 detailed critique of the US "14-
 point program" and the party
 daily dismissed the President's
 State of the Union message as
 "no different from previous US
 statements."   The attacks again
 called the "unconditional pull-
 out of US forces" the key to a
 settlement and said that the US
 would have to do more than allow
 the South Vietnamese National
 Liberation Front to present its
 views on a negotiated settlement--
 it would have to "recognize the
 front and its program."  On US
 willingness to use the Geneva
 agreements as a basis for nego-
 tiations, Hanoi said that if
 this were true the US should
 accept the DRV "four points"
 which are the "sum and substance
 of these agreements."
 There is little doubt,  how-
 ever,                                                                     that despite their intransi-
 gence,                                                                      the North Vietnamese wish
 to encourage the longest possible
 cessation of bombing.   The DRV
 probably is taking maximum advan-
 tage of the lull to repair bomb
 damage and move supplies.
 Peking Propaganda
 Peking also maintained its
 propaganda attack against the
 US peace effort,   underscoring
 allegations of US "atrocities"
 in an apparent effort to divert
 the attention of Afro-Asian na-
 tions from the adamant Chinese
 stand against any negotiations
 except on Communist terms.   In
 an editorial on 19 January de-
 nouncing President Johnson's
 State of the Union message,  the
 party daily asserted that the
 US was employing a "scorched
 earth" policy in Vietnam,   "burn-
 ing all,   and destroying all.'
 It also characterized the US
 peace effort as a "trick" de-
 signed to mask escalation of the
 war.

 The Communist World
 THE SHELEPIN MISSION TO HANOI
 The results of Soviet party
 secretary Shelepin's mission to
 North Vietnam are not yet fully
 clear.   The statements occasioned
 by the visit,  however,  suggest
 that it has led to little signif-
 icant change in Soviet-DRV rela-
 tions or in either party's con-
 cept of how the Vietnamese con-
 flict should be waged.
 If,  as seems likely,  Shelepin
 encouraged the North Vietnamese
 to give more serious considera-
 tion to political alternatives,
 he was apparently unsuccessful.
 The terse communique released
 after the visit was unusually
 bland,  containing only the mini-
 mum to be expected in the cir-
 cumstances:   renewed expressions
 of Soviet support for North Viet-
 nam and of North Vietnamese grat-
 itude for the Russian aid already
 given,  and the promise of further
 assistance.
 What the statement failed
 to say is the best gauge of the
 results of the private talks.
 There was no reference to recent
 US diplomatic probes--which was
 certainly a key topic in the
 DRV-Soviet talks.   This omission
 is probably a sign that the two
 parties were unable to achieve
 a consensus or even a compromise
 position on a proper response to
 the US peace probes.
 There had been earlier in-
 cations in public speeches of
 differences between Hanoi and
 Moscow in their attitudes toward
 the US "peace offensive."   The
 Soviets have assumed a generally
 noncommittal attitude,  in con-
 trast to the virulent denuncia-
 tions emanating from Hanoi and
 Peking.
 Shelepin apparently also
 ran into trouble in his attempts
 to secure North Vietnamese sup-
 port for Moscow's anti-Chinese
 line.   Missing from the communi-
 que was the normal plea for Com-
 munist unity in support of North
 Vietnam,  an obviously anti-Chinese
 theme which ran through Shelepin's
 public statements in Hanoi.
 There is no evidence that
 the Shelepin visit will bring any
 drastic changes in the extent or
 type of Soviet military and eco-
 nomic aid.   Military assistance
 has thus far been primarily de-
 fensive in nature,  but of a
 gradually increasing level of
 sophistication.   According to the
 final communique,  a new agreement
 on additional,  unspecified assist-
 ance was signed and "specific
 questions" concerning further So-
 viet help for North Vietnam's
 economy and defense were discussed-

 Soviet party chief Leonid
 Brezhnev's visit to Mongolia
 from 12 to 17 January appears to
 have been intended in part to
 emphasize Peking's isolation in
 the Communist world.   The stature
 of  the  Brezhnev   delegation--
 which included Defense Minister
 Malinovsky and Foreign Minister
 Gromyko--and its timing--coinci-
 dental with the close of the
 Tashkent meeting and the Shelepin
 mission to Hanoi--underscored
 Moscow's campaign to check the
 expansion of Chinese influence
 in Asia.
 The communique ending the
 visit highlighted the "full
 identity and community of views"
 of both countries on all of the
 many foreign policy positions
 cited.   It also called for "joint
 actions in the common struggle
 against imperialism," a  line
 aimed at China, which has openly
 refused to cooperate.   In a
 speech on 16 January Brezhnev de-
 fended the principle of "peace-
 ful coexistence," stating that
 Soviet foreign policy sought to
 "liquidate the hotbeds of war
 and to settle international con-
 troversies by negotiations."   At
 the same time,  however,  he sup-
 ported the North Vietnamese and
 the South Vietnamese Liberation
 Front positions on the question
 of a Vietnam settlement but em-
 phasized the need for unity.
 The visit culminated with
 the revision and renewal of the
 20-year-old Treaty of Friendship,
 Cooperation,  and Mutual Assist-
 ance between the two governments,
 thus accomplishing its announced
 purpose.   The treaty, which is
 general in scope,  calls for in-
 creased cooperation in the mili-
 tary,  political,  economic,  and
 cultural fields.   It includes
 provisions for mutual consulta-
 tion and joint measures to en-
 sure the security of both coun-
 tries.   In contrast with the
 1946 treaty,  the language of the
 new agreement reflects an attempt
 to portray Mongolia's status as
 an "equal" partner.
 The high rank of the Soviet
 delegation as well as the praise
 heaped upon Mongolian party boss
 Tsedenbal's government also re-
 flects Moscow's desire to en-
 hance the prestige of the present
 Mongolian leadership, which has
 been subject to criticism from
 nationalist elements during the
 past several years.   One of the
 major criticisms of Tsedenbal
 had been his subservience to
 Moscow.
 Brezhnev's visit also drew
 considerable Mongolian praise
 for Soviet economic assistance.
 Only recently the USSR wrote off
 a big portion of Ulan Bator's
 debt which had resulted from
 sizable Soviet support of the
 third five-year plan (1960-65).
 The Soviets have also announced
 a one-third increase in their
 contribution to the current plan.

 COMMUNIST CHINA'S LEADERS
 Mao Tse-tung has not made
 a public appearance since 26 No-
 vember,                          and his deputy,  Liu Shao-
 chi,.was out of public view be-
 tween 21 November and 20 January.
 Other top leaders,  including
 Premier Chou En-lai,  party sec-
 retary Teng Hsiao-ping,                          and Pe-
 king Mayor Peng Chen,                        have con-
 tinued their usual round of pub-
 lic activities.
 Mao Tse-tung customarily re-
 treats to a villa in east or cen-
 tral China during the winter and
 spring.   Last spring he was out
 of sight for two months.   Liu's
 absence was more unusual,  however.
 As chief of state,  he is expected
 to make frequent ceremonial ap-
 pearances and to receive foreign
 diplomats and many visitors.    Liu
 is rarely out of the public eye
 for more than two weeks at a time,
 and then usually in the summer.
 His  recent  absence was the long-
 est since 1957.
 The regime has continued
 to give heavy propaganda atten-
 tion to both men,  as if to give
 the impression that they were ac-
 tive and well.   People's Daily
 on 1 January broke precedent 6y
 publishing an informally posed
 photograph of Mao Tse-tung smok-
 ing_a cigarette,  plump,  smiling
 and obviously in good health and
 spirits.  New Year's Day portraits
 in the past have been formal poses.
 The lengths to which Peking
 will go to make it appear that
 Mao and Liu are active are demon-
 strated by the publication on the
 front page of the 9 December
 People's Daily of inscriptions in
 their own calligraphy commemorat-
 ing an obscure and normally un-
 publicized anniversary--in this
 case the 20th anniversary of the
 broadcasting industry.
 On 11 December Liu Shao-chi
 reportedly presided over a "re-
 cent" conference on education, and
 his name has appeared frequently
 in the press in connection with
 the sending and receiving of dip--
 lomatic messages and the appoint-
 ment of ambassadors.
 The protracted absence of
 Mao and Liu does not necessarily
 mean they have been seriously ill.
 Both are reported to have had
 serious illnesses in the past,
 but they seemed to be in rela-
 tively good health during their
 numerous appearances last fall.
 Their  recent  apparent inactivity

 does suggest that Mao, now 72,
 and Liu, 67, are slowing down,
 and that younger, more vigorous
 men like the militant Teng Hsiao-
 ping must be playing a more ac-
 tive role in determining national
 policies.  The simultaneous ab-
 sence of the two top leaders also
 underscores the possibility that
 Liu,  the heir apparent,   might
 not be on the scene much longer
 than Mao.   If so,  this would com-
 plicate the process--always dif-
 ficult in a totalitarian state--
 of attaining an orderly succes-
 sion to leadership.
 POLISH CHURCH-STATE STRUGGLE DEEPENS
 Worsening church-state rela-
 tions in Poland have led to a di-
 rect exchange of emotional
 speeches by party chief Gomulka
 and Cardinal Wyszynski, but both
 protagonists have retained room
 for maneuver.    The confronta-
 tion reflects the regime's failure
 to deter the Roman Catholic pri-
 mate from defending the Polish
 episcopate's incipient semipolit-
 ical dialogue with the German
 Catholic episcopate.
 Coming in the wake of the
 regime's ban on foreign travel
 by Wyszynski, Gomulka's speech
 of 14 January capped a month-long
 attack against the episcopate.
 Gomulka demanded political loy-
 alty from the church,  but hinted
 that limited church-state polit-
 ical cooperation was still possi-
 ble if the church did not chal-
 lenge the state's foreign policy.
 Previously,  the regime had for-
 mally discouraged all church po-
 litical activity in the foreign
 policy sphere.   Gomulka absolved
 the episcopate of making conces-
 sions on the Oder-Neisse frontier,
 but termed the bishops'  letter
 of 18 November to the German hier-
 archy which touched on the subject
 "badly formulated."
 Although Wyszynski  in a sermon
 oa 15 January acknowledged Gomulka's
 concessions, his sharp rebuttal
 of the party chief's charges may
 reflect hopes that domestic and
 international pressures can yet
 induce the regime to temper its
 antichurch stand. Vatican support
 for the cardinal was contained in
 a papal message read in Polish
 churches on 15 January,  the same
 day that England's Roman Catholic
 primate Heenan called for world
 condemnation of the Polish regime's
 antichurch drive.
 There seems little popular
 alarm over the church-state strug-
 gle as yet.  However, Gomulka's
 awareness of the explosiveness
 of this issue is another factor
 which could lead to an elaboration
 of some of the conciliatory as-
 pects of his speech and a backoff
 from extremes--a policy which the
 regime has followed in past churc
 state confrontations.

 EAST GERMANY HARDENS POLICY ON CULTURAL AFFAIRS
 The East German  (GDR) regime,
 which reluctantly relaxed its rigid
 cultural policies in 1963 and 1964,
 has begun to revert to greater re-
 strictiveness.   The new keynote was
 sounded at the December plenum of
 the party  (SED) central committee
 simultaneously with a propaganda
 campaign. against deviating intellec-
 tuals.   This was quickly followed
 by the firing of Minister of Culture
 Hans Bentzien,  the regime's scape-
 goat, and of many officials in cul-
 tural organizations.
 The period of cultural relaxa-
 tion,                       in the eyes of SED conserva-
 tives,  led to growing antiregime,
 decadent,  or pornographic themes in
 many works of art.   Writers such as
 Stefan Heym and Werner Braeunig,
 playwright' Peter Hacks, and beatnik
 cabaret performer Wolf Biermann crit-
 icized the party and life in East
 Germany rather openly.'  Perhaps more
 important than this development,
 however,   was a growth in restiveness
 among youth which party conserva-
 tives 'linked to "Western influences"
 allegedly allowed to infiltrate East
 Germany during this period.
 There once was a man
 Who put his, foot,
 His naked foot,
 Into a dung heap.
 He was much repelled
 By that one foot.
 He didn't want to take another step
 With that foot.
 And no water was there
 With which to wash his foot;
 For his one foot
 There also was no water there.
 60550
 Encouraged by recent harsh
 criticism of cultural dissidents in
 the USSR and a crackdown in Czecho-
 slovakia--earlier pressure from
 Prague had been instrumental in the
 GDR's decision to relax restraints
 two years ago--regime leaders
 .spelled out their grivances in de-
 tail at the December plenum.  Lead-
 ing the way, Erich Honecker, the
 number two man in the SED,  criti-
 cized by name several writers,  lit-
 erary publications, and radio-TV
 and cinema productions.
 Continuing attacks on Biermann
 and other writers suggest the regime
 will pursue its harsh line against
 prominent artists as well as cul-
 tural organizations.   While the ar-
 tists presumably will remain restive,
 they have shown no ability to or-
 ganize themselves into an effective
 countermovement.   The fawning self-
 criticism now prevalent indicates
 that intellectual discontent will
 remain splintered and,  perhaps for
 the immediate future, muted.

 The USSR has started its
 1966 foreign aid program by ex-
 tending a $290-million economic
 credit to Iran.   Repayable over
 a 12-year period at 2.5 percent
 interest, the credit is to be used
 to finance the construction of a
 steel plant and a machine tool
 factory and for assistance in lay-
 ing a620-mile natural gas pipe-
 line from Iranian fields to the
 USSR.   Acceptance of the long-
 standing Soviet offer for the
 steel mill has enabled the Shah
 to demonstrate that he retains
 freedom of action despite his
 ties with the West.
 Soviet participation in the
 pipeline project is limited to
 engineering and technical assist-
 ance for construction of the
 northern section of the pipeline
 and to supplying the compressors
 for the entire pipeline.   The Na-
 tional Iranian Oil Company will
 do the survey, engineering,  and
 construction of the major section
 of the pipeline from the southern
 oil fields to the Tehran area.
 Iran is responsible for obtaining
 the wide-diameter pipe--an item
 in short supply in the USSR--as
 well as the auxiliary equipment
 for the project.
 The credit is to be repaid
 by Iranian exports of natural gas
 through the pipeline, which is
 scheduled to be completed in 1970.
 Agreement was reached for the in-
 itial sale of 6 billion cubic
 meters, sufficient to meet loan
 repayments, and rising to 10 bil-
 lion cubic meters, thus presaging
 an expansion in trade between the
 two countries.
 During the past year the USSR
 has expended considerable effort
 to enhance its influence in other
 pro-Western countries near its
 southern borders.   By intimating
 that it might offer new economic
 assistance,  Moscow has sought to
 encourage Pakistan to pursue a
 course more independent of both
 the West and Communist China.  In
 late November the Soviet Union
 boosted its $30-million economic
 aid commitment to $50 million.
 Additional aid may be forthcoming
 for Pakistan's third five-year
 plan  (1965-70) after the comple-
 tion next month of some feasibil-
 ity studies by Soviet experts.
 The gradual improvement in
 Soviet relations with Turkey has
 set the stage for an expanded aid
 program there.   Moscow has ex-
 pressed its willingness to supply
 factories and other installations
 worth up to $200 million with re-
 payment over a 15-year period at
 2.5-percent interest.   Soviet ex-
 perts arrived in Turkey in late
 September to undertake preliminary
 surveys of steel,       petroleum,
 aluminum,   glass,      tractor,  and
 vodka factories,   but final de-
 cisions will be made only af-
 ter the submission of more de-
 tailed project reports.

 SUKARNO AND INDONESIAN
 Despite increased student
 agitation and political maneuver-
 ing by both President Sukarno and
 the Indonesian Army,  the impasse
 between the two sides continues.
 A series of student demonstra-
 tions protesting soaring prices
 and the inefficiency of Sukarno's
 ministers rocked Djakarta this
 week.   Initially sponsored by the
 army,  the demonstrators demanded
 a cabinet reshuffle and a ban on
 the Indonesian Communist Party
 (PKI).   Handbills with slogans
 aimed at Sukarno appeared.
 Sukarno's response was a call
 for his supporters to "gather your
 forces, form your ranks,  defend
 Sukarno."   The appeal was renewed
 by First Deputy Premier Subandrio,
 who stated that the President's
 long-anticipated "political solu-
 tion" to Indonesia's crisis would
 be unveiled shortly.
 The palace is trying to or-
 ganize a "Sukarno Front" of work-
 ers,                         peasants,  youth,  and women,
 but the move has so far had lit-
 tle success.                          Members of the left-
 ist-dominated National Front--
 virtually inactive since the abor-
 tive coup--have been asked to mo-
 bilize in expectation of orders
 from the President.   However,  a
 "roll call" staged to voice sup-
 port for the President was attended
 only by a small,  lethargic group.
 The army apparently first
 launched the protests in an effort
 ARMY REMAIN STALEMATED
 to blame Sukarno for Indonesia's
 economic malaise, which has been
 largely unrelieved by recent stop-
 gap measures.   When student demon-
 strators battered down the gates
 of Sukarno's palace on 15 January,
 however,  the army apparently feared
 that that activity might get out
 of hand. Djakarta's military com-
 mander subsequently banned fur-
 ther demonstrations in the capital
 on the grounds that they had been
 "exploited by'imperialists and
 Communists."  However,  students
 defied the ban and continued to
 rally in Djakarta and Bandung.
 Although army forces and police
 are on the scene,  the army ap-
 parently plans no action against 25X1
 the unauthorized demonstrations.
 The army is plagued by dif-
 ficulties on a variety of other
 fronts.   Military discipline is
 apparently slackening in Djakarta
 and other areas.    Moreover,
 cracks are appearing in the
 makeshift coalition opposing
 Sukarno.   Army leaders histori-
 cally distrust civilian-politi-
 cians,  and there are signs of      25X1
 rivalry between Muslim and
 Christian anti-Communist groups.

 COMMUNISTS CONTINUE PRESSING GOVERNMENT FORCES IN LAOS
 Communist military activity
 in Laos continues to be focused
 in the panhandle area.   On 13
 January, government forces were
 pushed from Ban Thateng,  on the
 Bolovens plateau some 20 miles
 south of Saravane.   No significant
 new action has been reported in
 the area since then,  but the at-
 tack raises the possibility that
 the Pathet Lao, with the support
 of North Vietnamese elements,
 intend to try to bring the pla-
 teau under their control.   At a
 minimum the Communists can be
 expected to react sharply to any
 government operation which threat-
 ens the infiltration corridor

 strategically along the road to
 repair damage caused by air
 strikes.
 If true,  this movement rep-
 resents a substantial increase
 over the one or two southbound
 trucks per day reported to have
 moved on Route 92 during the dry
 season last year.   The report
 also appears to jibe with an in-
 creasing number of truck sight-
 ings reported by US pilots fly-
 ing interdiction missions in the
 panhandle.
 The Communists evidently are
 moving considerably more trucks
 in the southern section of  the
 panhandle during the current dry
 season than they did last year.
 According to a Pathet Lao defec-
 tor,  some 10-15 trucks were mov-
 ing south nightly along the re-
 cently completed Route 96 as late
 as mid-December.   He claimed that
 the trucks were carrying rice,
 ammunition,  and men destined for
 South Vietnam.
 The defector has also  Indi-
 cated that it took the trucks 3-5
 days to negotiate the 45 miles
 between Ban Bac and Chavane be-
 cause of precautions taken to
 evade air attack.   He said that
 small labor crews were placed

 the road in 14 days of coverage

 southbound truck traffic on Route
 23 has averaged eight trucks per
 day since the road was opened in
 early November 1965, compared
 with 17 per day during the last
 dry season.
 In northern Laos,  the Com-
 munists are continuing to harass
 government guerrilla positions
 around Na Khang,  south of Samneua
 town.   Government troops have lost
 some positions to enemy clearing
 operations north of Luang Prabang.

 Public reaction to the Tash-
 kent Declaration has been split
 along geographic lines in Paki-
 stan.                  Most of East Pakistan ap-
 parently received the settlement
 with relief,  feeling that a sec-
 ond round with India had been
 prevented.   In West Pakistan,
 however,  violent student demon-
 strations against the declara-
 tion and against President Avub
 erupted on 13 and 14 January.
 These were probably stimulated
 by a joint statement of several
 opposition leaders criticizing
 Ayub for "buying peace at the
 cost of national honor."
 The government now has muf-
 fled open opposition by arrest-
 ing students--over 200 in Lahore
 alone--closing schools,  banning
 the assembly of more than five
 persons,  and launching an "en-
 lightenment campaign" on Tashkent
 in the controlled press.   There
 remains considerable disenchant-
 ment with the government,  however,
 particularly among students and
 lawyers,  and this appears to be
 developing into open criticism
 of Ayub's heavy-handed efforts
 to control public opinion.
 Ayub has taken special pre-
 cautions to retain the support
 of the army.   While there has
 been grumbling among senior of-
 ficers over the outcome at Tash-
 kent,  reports indicate the top
 commanders are resigned to accept-
 ing Ayub's continued leadership.
 The Country Team in Rawalpindi
 tends to discount an earlier un-
 confirmed report that on Ayub's
 return from the meeting with Shas-
 tri several senior generals pre-
 sented him with an ultimatum de-
 manding "action" on Kashmir.
 Army Chief of Staff Musa sent a
 letter to commanders of all prin-
 cipal units strongly defending
 the Tashkent agreement.   Another
 order to the army--presumably
 reflecting reports of widespread
 bitterness among junior officers
 --prohibits any discussion   of
 the declaration within the army
 or between army personnel and
 civilians.
 The adverse reaction to the
 agreement may aid the career of
 Foreign Minister Bhutto.   He de-
 livered only a perfunctory defense
 of the declaration in a speech of
 15 January,  and is widely believed
 to be opposed to recent trends in
 Ayub's foreign policy.   Reports
 that he will resign persist.  Should
 he choose to leave the cabinet
 at this time,  he could emerge as
 a political martyr and even a po-
 tential leader of forces oppos-
 ing Ayub.
 Indira Gandhi,  India's new
 prime minister,  is not expected
 to make any immediate policy
 changes in trying to solve her
 country's numerous domestic ana
 international problems.
 The selection of Mrs.  Gandhi
 was largely a matter of politi-

 election was virtually assured
 some days before when key state
 and national political leaders
 rallied behind her as a "con-
 sensus" candidate.   Few of these
 leaders regarded Indira as their
 favorite candidate, but they
 agreed with powerful party presi-
 dent Kamaraj that she was the
 contender most likely to stop a
 strong bid by right-wing former
 finance minister Morarji Desai,
 a long-standing foe of the "syndi-
 cate" of leaders who brought
 about Shastri's succession to
 Nehru.   As Nehru's daughter she
 also enjoys a national image
 which will be advantageous in the
 1967 general elections.
 Following Kamaraj's endorse-
 ment,  all other contenders stepped
 down except Desai, who at age 70
 saw this party election as his
 last chance to capture the top
 government position.   His rela-
 tively strong showing--about 33
 percent--probably reflects to a
 considerable extent the tendency
 of some party backbenchers to
 vent secretly their pent-up dis-
 gruntlement at the sometimes
 heavy-handed machinations of the
 party leadership.   Desai himself
 --above all a good party man--
 will probably be a graceful loser
 and not a troublemaker within
 the party.
 Some cabinet
 changes may be made,  but many in-

 Minister Subramaniam and Defense

 five-year plan,  originally sched-
 uled to begin in April,  has been
 shelved temporarily in favor of
 an emergency one-year plan.   Mrs.
 Gandhi's doctrinaire socialism
 is looked upon with suspicion
 by the conservative business
 community and may make it dif-
 ficult for her to obtain the
 vital support of  that sector.
 Iraq's proposals to discuss
 settlement of problems with
 Iran--and Tehran's acceptance
 thereof--indicate a willingness
 on both sides to relax the ten-
 sions which led to border clashes
 earlier this month.   The situa-
 tion remains delicate,  however,
 and the tendency toward improved
 relations could be reversed.
 Iranian Foreign Minister
 Aram, who was in India when
 Prime Minister Hoveida accepted
 the Iraqi proposals,  is furious
 that the Shatt-al-Arab question
 was not specifically mentioned.
 Despite  the Shah's reluctance
 to press the Iraqi Government
 too far,  Aram's anger may in-
 crease Iranian pressure to re-
 negotiate the status of the
 Shatt-al-Arab River, which forms
 the southernmost portion of the
 Iraqi-Iranian border.   The pres-
 ent   boundary generally follows
 the low-water line on the Iranian
 side.   Iraq has in the past re-
 jected Iran's attempts to reopen
 the boundary problem.
 Baghdad will probably press
 for a halt to Tehran's support for
 the Kurdish rebels in northern
 Iraq.   Iran has already agreed to
 an Iraqi suggestion that it pull
 back its troops from the border
 area.
 Iioveida reportedly hopes to
 begin talks with the Iraqis in
 Baghdad in late January,  but the
 timing will depend on ability to

 ARMY TAKES OVER IN NIGERIA
 Nigeria's 10,000-man army has
 taken control of Africa's most
 populous country following a bloody
 coup d'etat initiated on 15 January
 by lower echelon officers.   The up-
 heaval, apparently triggered by
 army unhappiness over the continu-
 ing tribal turmoil in Western Ni-
 geria,  has swept away the old
 federal power structure over which
 conservative Muslim northerners
 had been steadily tightening their
 grip. It could culminate in an
 early large-scale breakdown of
 order.
 The situation remained fluid
 and uncertain for days after the
 coup was initiated with the vir-
 tually simultaneous assassinations
 of the premiers of the Northern
 and Western regions.   The federal
 prime minister was abducted from
 Lagos,  the national capital,  and
 has been reported killed.   Within
 hours a "revolutionary military
 council," headed by a Major Nzeogwu
 and evidently backed by most of
 the army units in the north,
 emerged as the effective govern-
 ing authority in Kaduna,  the re-
 gional capital.   Nzeogwu told the
 US consul the same day that the
 coup was engineered by younger of-
 ficers who wanted to eliminate es-
 tablished politicians and parties
 because of "corruption and tribal-
 ism."
 Later on 15 January it was
 announced in Lagos that Major
 General Ironsi,  the army command-
 er  who was first reported under
 restraint and then as leader of a
 successful countermove by "loyal-
 ist",troops, had assumed tempo-
 rary supreme authority at the in-
 vitation of federal cabinet mem-
 bers.   Shortly thereafter Ironsi
 .announced a sweeping "suspension"
 of offices and institutions at both
 the federal and regional levels and
 promised   a   new constitution "pre-
 pared in accordance with the wishes
 of the people."   Ironsi,  a southerner
 (as apparently are most of the lower
 ranking officers who spearheaded the
 coup), thus in effect moved to take
 over the revolt.
 Ironsi now has apparently se-
 cured acknowledgment of his authority
 by the commanders of all army units
 deployed in the regions,  including
 those controlled by the coup leaders
 in Kaduna.   In a 19 January press
 conference, Nzeogwu, who had con-
 firmed earlier that he was negotiat-
 ing with Ironsi,  formally announced
 his "allegiance" to the new central
 regime and his transfer of "all
 power" to the officer--Major Katsina
 --whom Ironsi had named military gov-
 ernor of the north the day before.
 Katsina and his three counterparts
 in the south are all members of the
 predominant tribe in their assigned
 regions.   This reflection of re-
 gional and tribal realities is pre-
 sumably designed to help hold the
 country together in this emergency
 and forestall the tribal unrest
 widely feared in the wake of the
 coup.
 In Lagos Ironsi's interim gov-
 ernment is beginning to function
 through continuing civil service
 channels and he is reported trying
 to set up a small executive council
 w:tth substantial civilian member-
 ship.   His personal position still
 seems rather precarious,  however.
 A subordinate officer reportedly
 made an attempt on his life on 17
 January and subsequently there have
 been many unconfirmed reports of
 arrests and even summary.executions
 of dissident army personnel in the
 Lagos area.   Ironsi has a poor

 reputation both as an officer and an
 administrator--much of it earned when
 he headed the UN force in the Congo--
 but a successor who could command as
 much authority would probably be dif-
 ficult to find.
 No unfavorable public reaction
 to the new regime has yet been re-
 ported.   It has,  in fact, been quickly
 acclaimed by various elements of Ni-
 gerian society,  including two major
 southern political parties,  labor,
 youth,  and student groups,  and some
 prominent northerners.   Such elements
 are surely all hoping to play an in-

 Serious intertribal violence, es-
 pecially in the Northern Region, or a
 breakdown of discipline within the army,
 which reflects the country's tribal
 and regional divisions, remain real
 possibilities as knowledge and under-
 standing of what has happened spreads.
 So far, however,  the regional capitals
 and the countryside have remained gen-
 erally quiet on the surface, except
 for the parts of the Western Region
 which have been experiencing unrest
 since last October.   New disturbances
 occurred in Ibadan, the Western capital,
 shortly after the coup but,  follow-
 ing the virtual imposition of martial
 law by the army,  the security situa-
 tion there has reportedly improved.

 The 17-18 January meeting
 of the EEC Council of Ministers
 found the members apparently still
 far apart on the issues under-
 lying the six-month-old community
 crisis.
 French Foreign Minister Couve
 de Murville offered a set of "ten
 commandments" to govern the role
 and activities of the EEC Commis-
 sion.   The total impact of these
 proposals--which also implicitly
 criticized the council for giv-
 ing the commission too much au-
 thority--would be to deprive the
 commission of the independent
 role the EEC treaty envisaged.
 Combined with the clear French
 intention to replace present com-
 mission personnel and to prevent
 any future decision on important
 issues by majority vote,  the
 French package would in effect
 end the further supranational
 development of the community and
 probably even its effective func-
 tioning.
 While some of the ten points
 concerning the commission were
 evidently acceptable to France's
 partners, several of the key ones
 were not.   On majority voting,
 Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak--
 reportedly supported by the Ital-
 ians and the Dutch--offered a
 compromise formula which would
 restrict or delay application of
 the majority rule in certain vi-
 tal issues,  but not preclude its
 possible use for the future.   The
 discussion was inconclusive, how-
 ever, with the French indicating
 that Paris would submit counter-
 proposals.   Moreover, when Couve
 subsequently introduced a time-
 table for community action--con-
 ditional on settlement of the po-
 litical issues and focusing on
 matters primarily of concern to
 France--German Foreign Minister
 Schroeder angrily left the con-
 ference room and was followed
 shortly thereafter by the dele-
 gates of Italy and the Benelux
 countries.
 The council meeting, which
 was later suspended,  is scheduled
 to resume on 28 January after
 preparatory talks at a lower level
 in the middle of the week.   Some
 community sources believe the
 French have already pulled back
 considerably from their initial
 demands concerning the commission's
 powers,  and they do not exclude
 the possibility that some vague
 formula can be worked out.   Some
 quarters believe that Paris will
 also concede on majority voting,
 provided it can obtain agreement
 to reconstitute the commission's
 personnel with "nonpolitical
 types."   Another school of thought
 maintains,  however,  that the ma-
 jority vote is a question of
 principle for De Gaulle, whose
 simple criterion for a settlement
 remains whether France will have a
 permanent veto.

 The Dominican situation is
 still in an impasse, with rebel
 leader Caamano demanding unreal-
 istic concessions before he agrees
 to leave,  and the regular military
 leaders refusing even to discuss
 their departure until he goes.
 Caamano has demanded assur-
 ances before he leaves that most
 of his military followers,  in-
 cluding about 100 not on active
 duty when the rebellion began in
 April, will be quicly integrated
 into the armed forces.   Pending
 this,  Caamano wants them moved to
 a location in downtown Santo Do-
 mingo.   Garcia Godoy has rejected
 this latter demand.   He appears,
 however,  to underestimate regular
 military opposition to rebel in-
 tegration.
 The military is reportedly
 developing elaborate plans in
 case of a possible Inter-Ameri-
 can Peace Force  (IAPF) move to
 force its leaders to leave,  al-
 though it does not really expect
 such a move to develop.   Minis-
 ter of Defense Rivera will prob-
 ably accept an assignment as at-
 tache in Washington if Caamano
 goes on acceptable terms,  but air
 force chief De los Santos and
 army chief Martinez are under con-
 siderable pressure from hot-
 headed subordinates to stay.

 A new note of uncertainty
 was introduced when Leon Bosch,
 son of the Dominican Revolution-
 ary Party leader, was wounded on
 19 January under circumstances
 that are unclear.   Earlier in the
 week Juan Bosch had complained
 to Latin American legislatures
 of the "chaotic situation" in the
 country and made press statements
 attacking "persecution" by police
 and military forces.  If the wound-
 ing of his son can be atrributed
 to rightist elements,Bosch is sure
 to reiterate his charges of an
 organized attempt to eliminate or
 intimidate "constitutionalists."
 The incident may also increase
 the likelihood of Bosch's boycott-
 ing   elections on the grounds that
 the provisional regime cannot guar-
 antee his safety.
 Many Brazilians,  particu-
 larly military personnel,                                                                        have
 continued to feel that the Garcia
 Godoy regime does not take a
 strong enough position against
 the leftist elements and have
 not been happy with the restraints
 put on the IAPF by the OAS--and
 implicitly by the US.
 Because of its close ties
 with the US,  however, Brazil can
 be expected to continue to back
 the US policy despite any mis-
 givings.

 TRI-CONTINENT CONFERENCE IN HAVANA
 The Cuban-sponsored Tri-
 Continent Conference in Havana
 from 3 to 15 January trumpeted
 the cause of national liberation
 movements--including armed rebel-
 lion--in Asia, Africa,  and Latin
 America,  but failed to muffle
 bitter Sino-Soviet wrangling.
 Havana was chosen as the interim
 headquarters of the secretariat
 of a new People's Solidarity Or-
 ganization for Asia, Africa,  and
 Latin America, and a Cuban was
 named secretary general.   A 12-
 member committee,                 including the
 USSR,  China,  and Cuba, was cre-
 ated to "promote,               increase,  and
 coordinate national liberation
 and fighting movements" and lend
 them "moral,   political, and ma-
 terial aid."
 Vietnam was clearly the first
 order of business.   A special
 subcommittee drafted resolutions
 expressing full support for Hanoi
 and the National Liberation Front.
 Latin America got second prior-
 ity.                Revolutionaries in Colombia,
 Venezuela, Peru,  Ecuador,  and
 Panama were called upon to co-
 ordinate their efforts.   Solidar-
 ity was expressed for the people
 of Guatemala and their "armed
 struggle," and the US was con-
 demned for its Dominican policy.
 In Africa, the Portuguese colo-
 nies,  South Africa,  and Rhodesia
 were the principal targets.
 Cuba vainly attempted to
 prevent Sino-Soviet polemics,  and
 to refurbish its image as a major
 leader of revolutionary movements.
 Most sessions were secret,  but
 press reports indicate that a
 Sino-Soviet deadlock caused at
 least one all-night session.
 Three days after the conference
 ended, Radio Havana was still an-
 nouncing special resolutions that
 had been adopted but had not men-
 tioned a "special resolution on
 peaceful coexistence" which Mos-
 cow news services earlier claimed
 had been passed.   Soviet report-
 ing, which covered earlier pro-
 ceedings extensively but gave
 only brief treatment to the con-
 clusion,  suggests some dissatis-
 faction with the outcome.
 China has editorially hailed
 the final resolutions and the
 statements supporting the "Viet-
 namese people's struggle."   The
 Chinese, however, were generally
 forced to accept compromise so-
 lutions.   China will still ap-
 parently host the 1967 meeting
 of the Afro-Asian People's Soli-
 darity Organization  (AAPSO). The
 Chinese are deeply concerned,
 however,  that a permanent tri-
 continental body to be created
 the following year in Cairo will
 eventually absorb AAPSO,  in
 which they have long exerted a
 considerable influence.   Peking
 is undoubtedly playing for time,
 and at the AAPSO meeting will
 probably seek some formula which
 would preserve AAPSC separate
 from the Cuban-dominated tri-
 continental organization.
 Fidel Castro, in his speech
 at the closing session in Havana,
 urged an audience of nearly 500
 representatives of revolutionary
 groups from the three continents
 "to implement revolution" both in
 word and in deed.   In Latin Amer-
 ica,  he said,  "the battle will
 take on the most violent forms"
 for almost all the people.   It

 was his most explicit call for
 armed revolution since he report-
 edly agreed in late 1964 to sup-

 parties in Latin America.
 Following the conference,
 the Latin American delegates met
 separately,  and on 18 January
 Cuba announced formation of a
 Latin American Solidarity Organi-
 zation with headquarters in Ha-
 vana.   A nine-member committee
 was created to cooperate with the
 "most active anti-imperialist
 groups with extensive popular
 roots," and to plan the organiza-
 tion's first conference for 1967.
 This development presages re-

 activities throughout the hemi-

 BOLIVIAN POLITICS QUIET PENDING BARRIENTOS' RETURN
 General Rene Barrientos
 Ortuno is expected to return from
 Europe about 3 February to be-
 gin his campaign for the presi-
 dency in the 3 July national
 elections.   Barrientos resigned
 as junta co-president on 4 Jan-
 uary under heavy military pres-
 sure to respect a constitutional
 requirement that presidential
 candidates resign from office
 six months before the election
 date.   He then left for Europe
 for medical attention and a rest.
 The government has been func-
 tioning smoothly. The tin mine
 workers, weary of being used by ex-
 tremists for political ends,  are
 indisposed to violence at this
 time.   The military is probably
 more united now than it has been
 for several months.   The junta
 president,  General Alfredo Ovando
 Candia,  has made no known move
 to prevent Barrientos from re-
 turning, nor is he known to have
 tried to undercut Barrientos'
 popular or military support. Ap-
 parently Ovando is anxious that
 Barrientos return and get on with
 the electoral process.
 Political activity,  dormant
 since Barrientos'  resignation,
 should pick up after his return.
 .His small,  four-party political
 vehicle,  the Bolivian Revolution-
 ary Front  (FRB),  has publicly
 acclaimed him its presidential
 candidate, but in a telegram
 from Zurich, Barrientos declined
 to commit himself,  stating that
 ;z is health "temporarily prevents
 me from making a decision." Bar-
 _cientos apparently wants to hold
 off accepting the nomination un-
 til his triumphant return, when
 the political impact will be
 greater.   The longer he procras-
 tinates,  however,  the greater
 the danger that the FRB will dis-
 integrate and Barrientos lose
 popular appeal.
 Bolivia's major political
 parties--the rightist Bolivian
 Socialist Falange,  the Nation-
 alist Revolutionary Movement,
 Juan Lechin's National Leftist
 Revolutionary Party,  and the
 Christian Democratic Party--are
 still stumbling about in quest

 President Castello Branco is seeking participa-
 tion by labor,  students,  and  intellectuals in the
 progovernment National Renewal Alliance, one of two
 political groups being formed to replace the old
 parties which were all abolished late last year.
 In terms of numbers alone--Brazil has some 25 mil-
 lion workers--labor is obviously the main target.
 However, Castello Branco's efforts to broaden his
 political base and lessen the regime's dependence
 on the military are likely to encounter skepticism
 among labor.   There is widespread dissatisfaction
 with the government's policies among workers and
 union leaders.   Furthermore,  athough the extreme
 left has little chance at this time.of regaining
 the influence it once enjoyed in the labor movement,
 Communist activity is on the rise again.   The re-
 gime's relations with labor will become increasingly
 important during the coming months as Brazil pre-
 pares to transfer power to a new administration.  Con-
 gress will elect a new president sometime before
 3 October 1966 and the new administration will take
 office the following March.
 Causes of Disagreement
 The difficulties between
 the regime and the workers are
 partly a result of historical
 factors,  including continuous
 political exploitation--and some-
 times coddling--of the unions by
 a succession of governments be-
 fore Castello Branco came to
 power.   At the same time, much
 of the responsibility for the
 current difficulties must be at-
 tributed to the present govern-
 ment's ineffective labor policies
 and neglect of worker problems.
 Two main causes of popular
 discontent are the rising cost
 of living and poor social con-
 ditions.   The absence of adequate
 unemployment compensation and
 effective welfare programs are
 other contributing factors.   The
 most recent wage adjustments
 have been below increases in the
 cost of living and only one ad-
 justment per year is authorized.
 Soon after it took power
 the government enacted wage leg-
 islation placing stringent norms
 on adjudication of wage disputes
 involving public employees,  and
 has extended this wage guideline
 to the private sector.   The
 harshness of this policy in the
 workers'  eyes is contrasted with
 former president Goulart's prac-
 tice of decreeing frequent wage
 increases of up to 100 percent.
 Aside from a small number
 of enlightened union officials,

 few workers seem to show any
 sympathy for the administra-
 tion's efforts to curb infla-
 tion by using austerity meas-
 ures.   Workers complain that
 they are bearing the brunt of
 the belt-tightening programs.
 They especially cite the policy
 of holding down wages despite
 the continuing rise in the
 cost of living as the main
 cause of the workers'  plight.
 The administration agreed to a
 60-percent boost in the mini-
 mum wage in 1965, but union
 leaders argue that salaries lag
 so far behind the cost of liv-
 ing that workers'  purchasing
 power has been declining stead-
 ily.   The unions have been cir-
 cumscribed as channels of pro-
 test by new laws that prohibit
 political strikes by the unions
 and strictly limit the use of
 the strike as a tool Of pro:-
 test.   There thus have been few
 strikes of any consequence un-
 der the present regime.
 Government Policy
 Castello Branco has done
 little during his 20 months of
 rule to help labor.   Adminis-
 tration policies in this area
 have been generally weak and in
 many respects nonexistent. Cas-
 tello Branco seems to regard la-
 bor problems,  along with stu-
 dent problems,  as of secondary
 importance at most.   Arnaldo
 Sussekind, the labor minister
 until November 1965, was a weak
 figure in the administration,
 and more influential cabinet
 members such as Planning Minis-
 ter Roberto Campos gave little
 priority to improvement of work-
 ers'  conditions.   The present
 labor minister, Peracchi Bar-
 cellos, has not had time to
 demonstrate an understanding
 of his responsibilities, al-
 though he has expressed an in-
 tention to alleviate working
 conditions.
 On the other hand,  the ad-
 ministration has shown strength
 and determination in the aus-
 terity policies it has ad-
 vanced.   Castello Branco is
 willing to endure a period of
 unpopularity in expectation
 that the anti-inflation pro-
 gram will eventually demonstrate
 that it benefits everyone. Ad-
 ministration officials have
 been convinced that to abandon
 the policy of holding the line
 on wages would lead to further
 increases in the cost of liv-
 ing, which was held to a rise
 of 45.4 percent in 1965,  com-
 pared with 87 percent in 1964.
 The rate in 1964 would have
 been about 140 percent had
 Goulart remained in office.
 Planning Minister Campos,  the
 main architect of the austerity
 program, has privately admitted
 the reduction in real wages
 attending stringent application
 of the wage policy,  but he
 fears that any loosening of
 the wage formula would lead
 to a hopeless erosion of the
 current wage policy.
 The labor code gives the
 federal government ultimate
 control over the unions and
 almost total responsibility
 for worker welfare.   Only the
 federal government can legis-
 late in labor matters.   The

 contributes one day's pay per
 year to a government-supervised
 fund is a strong instrument of
 control since it is the main
 source of income for the unions.
 However,  Labor Minister Barcel-
 los stated recently that the
 government plans to eliminate
 this tax gradually over the
 next two or three years and to
 give unions complete control
 over their funds.
 The Labor Ministry is le-
 gally all-powerful in the labor
 management field.   It determines
 how the unions will function,
 how elections will be adminis-
 tered, what working conditions
 will prevail,  how grievances
 are settled,  and who can be dis-
 missed from employment. Paternal-
 ism has substituted for collec-
 tive bargaining,  and grievances
 are handled by labor courts.
 The unrest in labor is
 facilitating the work of the
 Communists, who have made the
 nearly 3,000 unions in Brazil
 the focus of their subversive
 efforts.   At the time of Gou-
 lart's overthrow in April 1964
 the labor movement was under
 strong Communist influence,  with
 the Communists dominating the
 leadership of four of the coun-
 try's six national labor con-
 federations.   The extreme left
 coordinated strikes and demon-
 strations through the Communist-
 influenced General Command of
 Workers, an illegal but active
 national labor organ.  Ultimate
 control of organized labor then
 as now rested with the govern-
 ment,  but Goulart was willing
 to cooperate with Communist un-
 ion leaders in exchange for their
 support.  The National Confed-
 eration of Credit Institution
 Workers, for example, was given
 Goulart's approval to affiliate
 with the Latin America  Bank
 Workers Confederation (CADEB),
 a Communist front group.
 Almost immediately after en-
 tering office the Castello Branco
 regime carried out a purge of
 Communist labor officials and
 their allies, and federal ad-
 ministrators were appointed to
 run some 400 unions.   Among the
 labor organizations brought un-
 der direct federal direction
 were most of the important in-
 dustrial unions in Sao Paulo and
 Rio de Janeiro.
 A few such administrators,
 notably in Santos and Salvador,
 used an iron fist in dealing with
 union officials. In most of the
 locals the interventors replaced
 elected officers, a number of
 whom were placed under detention.
 The long delay in lifting the in-
 tervention--many unions were not
 freed until late 1965--became an
 additional irritant in labor-
 government relations.

 Communist activity is on
 the rise again in the labor move-
 ment,  but the extreme left has
 little chance of regaining the
 degree of influence it once en-
 joyed because of government re-
 strictions.   Renewed Communist
 strength is evidenced by results
 of several important elections
 during the past several months.
 Communist-backed slates won over
 progovernment rivals in the large
 Guanabara metal workers' union
 and in key Sao Paulo locals rep-
 resenting metal workers and bank
 employees.   Although the govern-
 ment has sought to keep known
 Communists off the ballots,  the
 Communists formed tickets with
 lesser known party members and
 sympathizers.   Another tactic
 has been to organize unity slates
 with ostensibly "independent"
 candidates.   In at least one in-
 stance the government annulled a
 union election after subversive
 candidates had won.   The present
 policy is to require police clear-
 ances of all candidates.
 In the Sao Paulo area the
 pro - Chinese Communist Party of
 Brazil,  a small dissident group,
 apparently has begun organizing
 some support among labor groups.
 The regional labor delegate
 for Guanabara--the federal gov-
 ernment's representative--re-
 signed in protest against the re-
 turn of extreme leftist influence
 in the labor movement there.   The
 Labor Ministry became concerned
 over the outcome of union elec-
 tions in Guanabara,  the majority
 of which won either by unity
 slates containing subversive ele-
 ments or by opposition slates.
 Page 5
 Many of the government-
 sponsored programs that would
 most benefit labor have yet to
 advance much beyond the planning
 stage.   Progovernment candidates
 in union elections thus have had
 few administration achievements
 to which they can, point in their
 campaigns.   One prominent labor
 lawyer has criticized the ad-
 ministration's failure to explain
 its policies to the public as
 the reason for the election re-
 sults.
 Leadership Gap
 The lack of a positive gov-
 ernment policy toward labor dur-
 ing the past two years has com-
 pounded what has long been one
 of the most pressing problems
 for the unions--the lack of a
 system that develops capable and
 responsible democratic leader-
 ship.   Even those democratic
 labor leaders who privately ex-
 press support for the government's
 economic stabilization program
 usually denounce many of the
 measures because they feel that
 it would jeopardize their support
 to do otherwise.   In some areas
 it has become extremely difficult
 to find responsible trade union-
 ists who are willing to be candi-
 dates for union offices.
 The government faces over-
 whelming problems in the rural
 labor field, where unemployment
 is high,  benefits are few,  and
 social conditions are extremely
 bleak.   The church and other or-
 ganizations are engaged in im-
 provement projects but little

 has been accomplished by way of
 land reform,  and real wages
 have declined.   Employers often
 do not comply with the minimum
 wage law.   Since Castello Branco
 has been in power abuses by em-
 ployers in rural areas,  particu-
 larly in the northeast sugar
 zone,  have frequently gone un-
 checked.                  Shortly after the over-
 throw of Goulart, conditions be-
 came especially bad as landown-
 ers committed flagrant abuses
 "in the name of the revolution."
 Agricultural unions have
 been ineffective in developing
 mass support and only recently
 have they shown any sign of per-
 forming a constructive role.
 There no longer is widespread
 agitation among the peasants
 in the northeast such as existed
 when extreme leftist Peasant
 Leagues leader Francisco Juliao,
 now in exile, sucessfully
 mustered his followers for po-
 litical demonstrations.   The
 army has maintained a close
 watch over peasant activities
 in that region.
 Outlook
 The government will con-
 tinue to be under great pres-
 sure to come up with a long-
 promised comprehensive reform
 of the labor code and with in-
 creased benefits for workers.
 There are some signs that the
 administration is beginning to
 recognize the danger of continued
 labor dissatisfaction.   The low-
 cost
 been
 year
 housing program
 that
 had
 stalled for more
 than
 a
 is being revived
 and
 50,000
 scholarships are to be provided
 workers' children.
 In the government's favor
 is the likelihood that the cost
 of living will be held to
 gradually smaller increases in
 the coming months.   The anti-
 inflation program may eventually
 produce visible results that
 will persuade the general pub-
 lic, including labor, of the
 value of Castello Branco's aus-
 terity  measures.   The govern-
 ment will be racing against
 time to achieve results before
 summer, when the disrupting ef-
 fects of congressional and pres-
 idential election campaigning
 can be expected to dominate the
 political scene.
 As long as the regime re-
 tains the support of the armed
 forces it should have little
 difficulty in preventing any
 serious provocation by the unions
 despite renewed Communist ac-
 tivity among them.   Castello
 Branco's main problem in trying
 to win labor participation in
 the progovernment political bloc
 will be to overcome dissatisfac-
 tion among the workers so that
 labor leaders will feel that
 they can support the government
 without losing the confidence
 of the rank and file.

 The economy of the Dominican Republic, which
 has never supported most of the population above
 the subsistence level, has been floundering since
 about 1958.   In 1964, per capita gross national prod-
 uct                                         (GNP) was only at about the 1957 level--far be-
 low the average for Latin America.   The economy has
 failed to keep pace with the increase in population
 --in part because of a drop in levels of investment.
 The probable depletion of domestic savings makes the
 re-establishment of any significant economic growth
 dependent on foreign economic assistance for the de-
 velopment and diversification of agriculture, which
 dominates economic activity, and on the correction
 of budgetary imbalance,  disequilibrium in the balance
 of payments,  and inefficiencies in the operation of
 state-owned enterprises.
 In large measure,  the po-
 litical instability and recur-
 rent breakdowns in public order
 that have plagued the Dominican
 Republic since the assassination
 of Trujillo in May 1961 reflect
 the prolonged influence of de-
 pressed economic conditions and
 gross inequities in distribution
 of income.   In a Latin American
 population which is generally
 inadequately fed,  clothed,  housed,
 educated,  and doctored,  the Do-
 minican people rank among the
 lowest.   In terms of per capita
 food intake and per capita,GNP,
 Dominicans rank 20 to 25 percent
 below the Latin American average.
 The normally low level of
 personal welfare was worsened
 severely following the outbreak
 of revolution last April.   The
 almost total. disruption of eco-
 nomic activity in the capital,
 and in varying degrees throughout
 the country, led to breakdowns
 in normal marketing activities.
 To fill this vacuum the US Food
 for Peace program was converted
 into a massive emergency relief
 activity, reaching some 17 per-
 cent of the population at its
 peak during the middle of the
 year.
 Agricultural Dominance
 The country's inability to
 provide more than a bare level
 of subsistence for most of the
 population is caused in part by
 the weakness of the agricultural
 sector which dominates the econ-
 omy.    Agriculture directly con-
 tributes about 40 percent to the
 country's GNP, and normally em-
 ploys nearly two thirds of the
 labor force.   Agricultural prod-
 ucts--primarily sugar, coffee,
 cocoa, tobacco, and bananas--are
 the source of about 90 percent of
 the country's foreign exchange
 earnings from exports.   The sugar

 industry alone accounts for more
 than half.
 Despite important gains in
 the output of sugar, tobacco,
 bananas, rice, and peanuts, al-
 most all of agriculture produc-
 ing for the domestic market and
 that producing coffee and cocoa
 for export has stagnated since
 the early 1950s.   Terrain and
 rainfall limit the amount of new
 land that can be brought into
 production,  and government pol-
 icies have done little to in-
 crease productivity on that al-
 ready under cultivation.
 Mountainous terrain excludes
 agriculture from about half of
 the total land area.   Moreover,
 climatic conditions, ranging from
 semiarid to arid in the agricul-
 tural regions of the western half
 of the country,  contribute to low
 levels of productivity.
 Levels of output are further
 limited by the low levels of tech-
 nology, particularly among farmers
 who produce for domestic consump-
 tion.   In part,  the low level of
 technology reflects the large
 number of very small landholdings
 as well as the high rate of il-
 literacy among the rural popula-
 tion.
 About 86 percent of the
 farmers operate on plots less
 than 12 acres in size which con-
 stitute only 19 percent of the
 farmland.   The small size of these
 plots means a subsistence standard
 of living and prolonged periods of
 economic inactivity for the major-
 ity of the nation's farmers.
 At the other end of the
 ,distribution schedule, one per-
 cent of the farms account for
 54 percent of the total farmland.
 About half of this area was con-
 fiscated from the Trujillo family
 and associates following the dic-
 tator's assassination and is still
 owned by the state.   Much of this
 land,  however,  is inefficiently
 managed and inadequately used.
 Recent stagnation in agriculture
 is directly attributable to the
 inept management of state-owned
 farms.
 The value of total agricul-
 tural output is also limited by
 the heavy commitment of land and
 capital resources to permanent
 crops.   In 1960,  about 46 percent
 of the country's land in crops
 was being used to produce sugar
 cane,  coffee,  and cocoa.   Because
 of the heavy fixed investment in-
 volved,                                                                           the lower world prices
 for these three crops since the
 mid-1950s have not led to any
 substantial reallocation of land
 to more valuable crops.
 Industry and Services
 Industrial activities in
 the Dominican Republic are se-
 verely limited.   Minerals and
 metals resources are few, con-
 sisting principally of bauxite,
 nickel, salt, gypsum, and lime-
 stone.   The most significant min-
 ing activity is a bauxite mine
 near Pedernales on the southwest
 coast. The Aluminum Company of
 America, which has a 55-year con-
 cession, has an investment of
 about $15 million in this mine,

 and contributes about $10 million
 annually to export earnings. The
 country also has substantial iron
 ore reserves of premium grade,
 but these have apparently not
 been exploited since the end of
 1960.   No commercially exploit-
 able petroleum deposits have been
 discovered,  and the country im-
 ports virtually all its mineral
 fuels.
 Manufacturing activities
 are limited to a few large-scale
 agricultural processing and chem-
 ical industries and a wide range
 of small food-processing,  textile,
 and building materials establish-
 ments.   The milling and further
 processing of sugar cane dominate
 manufacturing activity,  constitut-
 ing an estimated half of the
 value added of all industrial
 activity.
 A good primary road system
 links all major economic regions,
 but the feeder system linking
 farms to their principal markets
 is inadequate.   The sugar mills
 maintain an extensive railroad
 network in the southeastern
 coastal plain, but there is only
 one single-track,  narrow-gauge
 public railroad of about 70 miles
 linking the interior city of La
 Vega to Sanchez on the east coast.
 The telecommunications system is
 small but modern.
 Economic Performance
 Recent economic performance
 is divided roughly into two pe-
 riods.   From the end of 1950
 through 1958, the economy gen-
 erally grew steadily at an aver-
 age annual rate of about 6.2 per-
 cent,                     a very respectable rate
 for a Latin American country.
 On a per capita basis, GNP ex-
 panded about 2.5 percent annually
 during the period.   The most im-
 portant factors in this sustained
 rapid economic growth were the
 high rates of public and private
 investment and the steady expan-
 sion in exports.   Trujillo's
 ability to assure political sta-
 bility, to hold down private con-
 sumption by restricting increases
 in wage rates, and to squeeze the
 profits of the nation's farmers
 was a major factor permitting the
 high rates of investment.
 From the end of 1958 through
 1964, annual changes in GNP fluc-
 tuated widely.   GNP has expanded
 at an average annual rate of only
 3.3 percent, or less than the an-
 nual population increase of 3.5
 percent.   Per capita GNP in 1964
 was slightly less than in 1957.
 Even the steady increase in
 exports after 1953 failed to keep
 pace with imports,especially of
 :nonconsumer goods, which.were
 stimulated by steady economic
 expansion.    A sharp drop in the
 normally positive trade balance
 in 1958 led the government to
 introduce austerity measures in
 :its budget and to impose import
 restrictions in 1959.   These
 measures slowed business activity
 Ln general and hit investment
 activity  particularly hard.   The
 maintenance of these measures
 through 1961, along with a dete-
 rioration in the political cli-
 mate, largely explains the gen-
 eral stagnation experienced
 through 1961.   There was a spurt
 in activity in 1960,  resulting
 from the US reallocation of part
 of the Cuban sugar quota to the

 Dominican Republic,  but Trujillo
 banked much of the revenues abroad.
 The economic policies of al-
 most all Dominican governments
 since the beginning of 1962 have
 done little to end this stagna-
 tion and, on balance, have prob-
 ably led to a deterioration in
 the bases for sustained long-term
 growth.   The permissive wage pol-
 icies of most of Trujillo's suc-
 cessors led to an estimated 50
 percent increase in real wages in
 the two years following 1961.
 This lowered business profits and
 savings and limited investment.
 Although expanded consumer demand
 growing out of the wage increases
 led to a jump in economic activity
 in 1962,  domestic producers were
 unable to meet the increased re-
 quirements and prices rose ap-
 preciably in 1962 and 1963 fol-
 lowing a prolonged period of gen-
 eral price stability under Tru-
 jillo. Despite the upheaval in
 1965, there are no indications of
 significant price increases.   In-
 creasing demand combined with
 higher domestic prices also led
 to a sharp jump in imports fol-
 lowing 1961.   Only high levels
 of foreign assistance, beginning
 in 1962 and amounting to probably
 more than $125 million in dis-
 bursements through 1964,  avoided
 considerably greater inflation-
 ary pressures.
 The drop in output in 1965
 was probably on the order of 10
 to 20 percent.   This decline was
 largely a result of the disrup-
 tion to business activity in
 Santo Domingo caused by the revo-
 lution.   It also reflects a con-
 tinuing fall in world sugar
 prices from the low level reached
 in 1964 and a sharp drop in world
 cocoa prices.
 Problems and Prospects
 The immediate prospects for
 the Dominican economy depend
 heavily on levels of foreign as-
 sistance.                                                                    The best that can be
 expected in 1966 is recovery to
 levels of about 1964.   Bases for
 long-term growth cannot be laid
 until long-standing political,
 social, and economic problems are
 solved.
 Viewed broadly,  the basic
 problems of the economy are the
 current low levels of savings
 stemming from a prolonged period
 of high consumption and the lim-
 ited stock of physical capital
 resulting from six years of low
 investment.
 A re-establishment of high
 levels of investment will be
 needed to lay the bases for any
 future growth.   Heavy foreign
 economic assistance will prob-
 ably be necessary because of the
 lack of domestic savings and do-
 mestic business confidence. More-
 over, export earnings, which
 could generate future savings,
 are not expected to increase sig-
 nificantly.

 If needed foreign assistance
 is received,  it would appear nec-
 essary to direct the bulk of the
 investment funds into agriculture.
 The extension and rehabilitation
 of irrigation systems,  improve-
 ments in rural marketing facili-
 ties,  including storage and trans-
 portation, and an over-all rise
 in the level of technology will
 be necessary to increase output
 through advances in productivity.
 A vigorous agrarian reform pro-
 gram designed to promote fuller
 employment of human and land re-
 sources also will be an essential
 component of any development plan.
 Finally, as world prices for
 several of the country's major
 export crops are expected to re-
 main low for several years,  diver-
 sification of agriculture for both
 export and domestic purposes is
 necessary.   All forms of live-
 stock activity,  as well as output
 of winter vegetables,  cotton,  and
 rice,  among others,  could probably
 be increased efficiently.   Because
 of limited natural resources,   in-
 dustrial development will tend to
 be directed to wider use of avail-
 able agricultural raw materials
 and continued expansion of such
 basic services as electric energy.
 The ability of the Dominicans
 to allocate development funds to
 the most efficient uses is severely
 restricted by the lack of trained
 personnel or a meaningful develop-
 ment plan as well as by political
 considerations. The shortage of
 skills in government is matched by
 an equal, if not more severe, ab-
 sence of managerial and other
 skills in most of the private sec-
 tor.
 Even with proper allocation
 of investments, benefits-which
 accrue to the economy would probes
 ably be wasted in the support of
 inefficiently operated state en-
 terprises.   An illustration of
 such inefficiency is the govern-
 ment-owned Dominican Sugar Cor-
 poration, which lost more than
 $18 million in 1964.   As a re-
 sult of the confiscation of
 properties owned by Trujillo and
 his associates,  the government
 owns about one-fourth of the
 country's farm land and an esti-
 mated half of the country's in-
 dustrial capital.   Apart from
 Cuba, this percentage of state
 ownership is the highest in the
 non-Communist world.
 The government's ability to
 provide necessary and efficient
 government services and to
 promote development also is re-
 strained by the existence of a
 large budget deficit and the coun-
 try's foreign exchange position.
 Planned budgetary expenditures
 of almost $254 million in 1966
 probably will result in a deficit
 on the order of $100 million, or
 about $70 million higher than
 any deficit recorded prior to
 1965.   The Dominicans will hope
 to finance about $75 million of
 the deficit through foreign a rants
