 VIETNAM
 Political unrest mounted this week in South Vietnam as
 Premier Ky tried both concessions and military pressure
 in an effort to end demonstrations against his govern-
 ment.   The unrest did not prevent the mounting of a
 record number of allied military actions, although
 South Vietnamese units have been deployed to security
 and riot control duty.  Viet Cong military initiatives
 remained at a low ebb, but reports continue to reflect
 a high level of infiltration and a massing of enemy
 troops in the northern provinces of I and II Corps.

 The political situation in
 South Vietnam remained highly vola-
 tile this week as Premier Ky tried
 both concessions and military pres-
 sure in an effort to end the demon-
 strations in the northern provinces
 and in Saigon against his military
 government.
 Following a meeting of the
 Armed Forces Congress on 3 April,
 members of the ruling Directorate
 announced that a national political
 congress would be convened "to set
 up an assembly."   Although this
 step appeared to hold out the pos-
 sibility of further concessions to
 Buddhist demands for faster transi-
 tion to civilian rule,  Buddhist
 leaders now have declared that the
 political congress is a step back-
 ward,  and boycotted its preliminary
 sessions on 6 April.
 The communique on the Armed
 Forces Congress meeting also an-
 nounced that strong measures would
 be used to restore peace and order.
 Ky spelled out for the press that
 this foreshadowed action against
 Da Nang, which he characterized as
 "in Communist hands."   The govern-
 ment moved three battalions of Viet-
 namese Marines to Da Nang Air Base
 on 4 April,  but it has so far post-
 poned an attempt to "retake" the
 city from defiant,  pro-Buddhist ele-
 ments for fear of armed clashes with
 local army units.
 Ky apparently remains deter-
 mined,  however,  to discipline offi-
 cials in Da Nang who have cooper-
 ated with the antigovernment move-
 ment.  He has arranged to send ten
 Vietnamese tanks there to strengthen
 his military position and is keep-
 ing his marine battalions in readi-
 ness.   Ky's choice of Da Nang for a
 show of strength probably reflects
 a belief that the elements in the
 "struggle movement" there are suf-
 ficiently divided to permit the
 government to bring the situation
 under control.   Demonstrations are
 continuing,  however,  in major towns
 in I and II Corps and in Saigon.
 Numerous reports indicate con-
 siderable Viet Cong penetration of
 the "struggle movement" in Da Nang
 and other cities,  but there is no
 proof that any of the local offi-
 cials or the Buddhist leaders who
 are providing the backbone of the
 current protest campaign are them-
 selves Communists.
 Vietnamese Communist propa-
 ganda has been increasing its ef-
 forts to turn the political unrest
 into a movement directed chiefly
 against American presence in South
 Vietnam.   Both Hanoi and the Libera-
 tion Front have attempted to portray
 the struggle groups as part of a
 broad political movement sharing
 identical aims with the Front.
 Moreover,  by calling for coopera-
 tion between these elements and
 the Front,  the Communists may be
 holding out the possibility of
 further cooperation with these
 groups in an eventual coalition gov-
 ernment under Viet Cong control.
 The Military Situation
 The political unrest has not
 as  yet  affected the unilateral op-
 erations of either US or other free
 world troops,  but it has tended to

 interfere with coordinated US/
 Vietnamese Army (ARVN)  operations
 as ARVN units have responded to
 the demands of security and riot
 control.   Allied forces, mount-
 ing a record number of unit ac-
 tions, scored impressive results
 in several widely scattered op-
 erations,                              inflicting heavy losses
 on the Viet Cong while suffering
 only relatively light casualties
 themselves.
 The heaviest fighting oc-
 curred in southern Pleiku and
 northern Darlac provinces, where
 five battalions of the US 1st
 Cavalry and two battalions of
 the 25th Infantry Division con-
 cluded their second week of Op-
 eration LINCOLN and continued to
 face resistance from Viet Cong
 forces in regimental strength.
 Toward the end of the week the
 fighting centered around Chu Pong
 Mountain some 40 miles south-
 west of Pleiku city on the Cam-
 bodian border,  scene of a major
 battle with North Vietnamese
 troops last November.   Communist
 losses to date in the operation
 stand at 373 killed as against
 US casualties of 33 killed,  83
 wounded,  and five missing.
 US Marines,  supported by
 B-52 air strikes,  are continuing
 amphibious Operation JACK STAY
 in the Rung Sat Special Zone 28
 miles southeast of Saigon.  Thus
 far no major resistance has been
 encountered from the VC forces
 which inhabit the area and har-
 ass river shipping from Vung Tau
 to Saigon.    However, discovery
 of a large hospital,  a mine fac-
 tory, classrooms,  and other in-
 stallations suggests that the
 Viet Cong had a major headquar-
 ters in the area.
 Although Viet Cong activity
 remained at a low ebb this week
 in terms of its intensity,  evi-
 dence has continued to accumu-
 late that the Communists are
 massing forces in the northern
 provinces of South Vietnam in
 apparent preparation for major
 offensive actions.    This evi-
 dence includes a considerable
 number of low-level reports of
 substantial additional infil-
 tration of North Vietnamese Army
 (PAVN) units in recent weeks
 which,  if borne out, would
 strongly suggest a significant
 threat to friendly forces and
 bases in the area.
 The confirmation of another
 PAVN unit in South Vietnam--the
 95th "B" Regiment--brings known
 North Vietnamese troop strength
 in South Vietnam to 18,630,
 organized in ten regiments and
 four separate battalions.    The
 new unit, which has a strength
 of 2,000 and consists of three
 battalions,  is the tenth PAVN
 regiment confirmed in the South.
 It participated in the attack
 on the A Shau Special Forces
 camp in early March.

 70 MIG-15 Fagot or    "-]7 Fresco

 In addition,  two IL-28 jet light

 These aircraft may be in-
 volved in training North Viet-

 force personnel.   Yunnani/Peitun
 is in a relatively remote area

 of safety for training not pres-

 Its use would also relieve con-

 half of the line since November
 1965,  and work was presumably

 ACCESS TO SOUTHEAST ASIA
 The Kunming-Kueiyang rail-
 road--together with the Kuei-
 yang-Chungking railroad com-
 pleted in late 1965--provides
 the first direct rail connection
 between Yunnan and the rest of
 China.   For contingency plan-
 ning,  the military now can count
 on shifting large numbers of
 troops by rail to the western
 part of the Vietnam border area.
 In addition,  rail communications
 with Yunnan no longer need be
 affected by the status of the
 Vietnamese lines from Hanoi to
 Lao Cai and Dong Dang, which
 are exposed to US attacks.   Be-
 fore US attacks began,  about
 half the traffic on these two
 railroads consisted of freight
 between Yunnan and the rest
 of China.    It is believed that

 MAO TSE-TUNG STILL OUT OF SIGHT
 Peking's sensitivity to for-
 eign speculation that Mao Tse-tung
 is seriously ill--his activities
 have now gone unreported for 19
 weeks--provides additional support
 for the view that the Chinese leader
 is incapacitated.
 On 26 March,  a government
 spokesman, responding to a question
 submitted by a Reuters correspon-
 dent, asserted that "Chairman Mao
 is in very good health," and called
 stories to the contrary "vicious
 fabrications."  On 29 March, a
 Chinese Communist newspaper in Hong
 Kong republished a fuzzy photograph
 of a smiling, healthy Mao from the
 25 March issue of the chief party
 daily in Canton.   There was no in-
 dication when or where the picture
 was taken, and this unusual circum-
 stance raises rather than settles
 questions about Mao's health.
 Mao almost certainly remains
 mentally competent, regardless of
 his physical condition.   If he were
 not,    it is unlikely that his deputy,
 Liu Shao-chi would have gone abroad
 for a series of visits to South
 Asian countries scheduled to last
 until mid-April.
 Several of the most publicly
 active members of the top leader-
 ship have been absent from the cap-
 ital for unusually long stretches
 during the past four months, and
 may have been manning a second top
 command headquarters to keep Mao
 informed and to implement his deci-
 sions.  If so,  this,  too, would in-
 dicate that Mao is mentally alert.
 Lo Jui-ching, army chief of
 staff, and Yang Shang-kun, who has
 served as Mao's personal link with
 the party secretariat, went out of
 sight simultaneously with Mao.   Liu
 Shao-chi and Foreign Minister Chen
 Yi were both out of the news for
 two-month spans last winter, and
 Tong Hsiao-ping, party general sec-
 retary, has not been seen since 9
 March.   Teng was conspicuously ab-
 sent from three major gatherings for
 the visiting Japanese Communist Party
 delegation, at which he would have
 been the appropriate host.
 Mao has been out of Peking
 since mid-October and is probably
 in East or Central China, where he
 has often gone for winter rest cures
 in past years.   It is quite possi-
 ble that he would choose to spend
 his last days in Hunan Province,
 which is his boyhood home.

 South Korea's recent seizure
 of a Japanese fishing boat was
 the first dispute in this long-
 standing area of friction to be
 handled in diplomatic channels
 since Seoul and Tokyo normalized
 relations late last year.
 The boat was seized on 14
 March in waters that by bilateral
 agreement are open to the fisher-
 men of both countries.   The Ko-
 reans,  however,  maintain they pur-
 sued the boat from an area re-
 served exclusively for Korean
 fishermen.
 In the past the Koreans of-
 ten handled such cases arbitrarily,
 confiscating the catch and boat
 and frequently imprisoning the
 crew.   In this case,  however,  af-
 ter holding the boat about two
 weeks,  the Koreans released it,
 apparently because their case was
 so weak.   Their patrol boat lacked
 electronic navigational equipment,
 whereas the Japanese  fishermen,
 who denied having been inside re-
 stricted waters,  pointed out that
 their boat had both loran and
 radar.
 Seoul an-
 nounced that,  although it has
 released the Japanese fisher-
 men and their boat, it will con-
 tinue to seize foreign fishing
 vessels that violate exclusive
 Korean fishing waters.   The Ko-
 reans say they intend to apply
 the doctrine of hot pursuit,
 which is open to dispute in in-
 ternational law.   Japan opposes
 treating exclusive fishing areas
 as territorial waters.
 In any event,  the incident
 may bring home to Seoul the
 necessity for greater caution
 in dealing with suspected Japa-
 nese fishing violations and       25X1
 could result in new guidelines
 for regulating fishing areas off
 South Korea.

 A press conference this
 week in Djakarta provided fur-
 ther indications that power has
 passed from President Sukarno to
 Indonesia's new ruling group.
 The government's two principal
 civilian leaders outlined plans
 to redirect national policies
 along more moderate lines.
 Foreign Minister Adam Malik
 made clear that Indonesia would
 follow a middle road in foreign
 policy and take steps toward re-
 admission to the United Nations.
 Although he paid lip service to
 continuing Sukarno's policy on
 Malaysia, Malik specifically
 stated that Indonesia would wel-
 come efforts to end the three-
 year paramilitary campaign.
 The Sultan of Jogjakarta,
 who directs economic affairs in
 the revised cabinet, emphasized
 that a program of economic sta-
 bilization must deal first with
 basic needs--an adequate rice
 supply,  improved transport, and
 expanded exports.   He welcomed
 "foreign aid without strings"
 and said that Indonesia would
 have to negotiate a new repay-
 ment schedule for its massive
 international debt.
 Other signs of the shift in
 power come from the controlled
 Djakarta press, which is increas-
 ingly directing criticism at Su-
 karno himself and demanding a
 "return to the constitution."
 Army chief Suharto stated on 4
 April that under Indonesia's con-
 stitution the congress--not the
 president--holds supreme power.
 In further anti-Chinese ac-
 tion,  the Djakarta military com-
 mander on 5 April ordered the
 closure of all Chinese schools
 in the city.   The order stated
 that after the 1 October coup
 attempt the schools had proven
 to be "sources of subversion"
 and that they "still bore a for-
 eign character."   This action
 followed a strong protest by Pe-
 king on 2 April over the recent
 looting of Chinese schools in
 Indonesia by anti-Communist dem-
 onstrators.

 The USSR's success in placing
 Luna 10 in orbit around the moon
 on 4 April is a significant mile-
 stone in its lunar program.   Data
 from this scientific probe should
 add to Soviet knowledge of the moon
 and be of some value to Soviet prep-
 arations   for future lunar missions.
 The Soviet lunar program has
 concentrated in the past on soft-
 landing a payload on the moon.
 After 11 unsuccessful lunar opera-
 tions since early 1963, the Soviets
 finally accomplished a soft-landing
 with Luna 9 on 3 February 1966.
 This success led to the initiation
 of the lunar-orbit program.   The
 next operation--Cosmos 111, which
 failed to eject from earth-parking
 orbit on 1 March--was probably the
 first attempt to orbit the moon.
 According to Soviet announce-
 ments,  the inclination of Luna 10's
 orbit to the moon's equator is   25X1
 about 72 degrees, which carries
 the spacecraft over most of the
 lunar surface.
 (public state-
 ments from Moscow have not yet men-
 tioned photography as a part of
 Luna 10's mission.

 Premier Kosygin's 5 April
 report to the 23rd Soviet Party
 Congress was largely a recapit-
 ulation of the 1966-70 economic
 plan announced last month,  judg-
 ing from available summaries.
 He made several strong statements
 on the need to strengthen the
 USSR's military potential and
 defense industry,  but he stressed
 that the future growth of the
 over-all economy would in itself
 achieve an improved defense pos-
 ture.
 His remark that Vietnam and
 the international situation "have
 forced the central committee and
 the government to increase ex-
 penditures on defense" came in
 an early section of his report
 explaining in part why the seven-
 year plan (1959-65)  targets were
 not completely fulfilled.   This
 statement apparently relates to
 the same time period as other
 recent assertions that military
 spending was unavoidably increased
 in recent years.
 In addition to reviewing
 the major domestic goals for
 1966-70, Kosygin stressed the
 importance of developing the
 USSR's foreign economic relations,
 particularly with respect to im-
 proving its foreign trade mecha-
 nism and to upgrading the range
 and quality of its exports.   His
 remarks also underscored the im-
 portance the USSR places on in-
 creasing its earnings of foreign
 exchange.
 Military Leaders'  Speeches
 The keynote speech on mili-
 tary affairs to the congress--
 delivered by Defense Minister
 Malinovsky on 1 April--was more
 moderate than his speech to the
 preceding congress in the fall
 of 1961.   In what may have been
 an indirect warning aimed as
 much at Peking as at the "capi-
 talist" powers, Malinovsky stated
 that the Soviet armed forces
 were for the "defense of the
 borders of our country" and to
 "ensure the security of our peo-
 ple and countries friendly toward
 us."   In a more propagandistic,
 anti-US vein, General A. Yepishev,
 political chief of the Soviet
 armed forces, recalled for the
 congress that Soviet military
 personnel and entire units had
 declared their readiness to go
 to Vietnam.
 With regard to the USSR's
 Strategic Rocket Forces, Malinov-
 sky announced that "a large num-
 ber of new mobile launching in-
 stallations have been built."
 This was an apparent reference
 to the mobile Scamp and Scrooge
 missile systems unveiled for
 the first time in Moscow's May
 Day parade last year.   There is
 no indication,however,  that these
 systems are operational. If
 the Soviets do perfect and deploy
 a large number of these mobile
 missiles,  the survival of their
 strategic attack forces will be
 considerably enhanced.

 Malinovsky made a brief
 reference to the construction of
 a "blue belt," possibly alluding
 to the deployment of a new de-
 fensive missile network (probably
 air defense)
 The
 "blue belt" could also refer to
 something other than an air-de-
 fense missile system,  for exam-
 ple,  a more effective coordina-
 tion of existing air defense
 weaponry through the introduc-
 tion of high-speed communications
 and automation.
 Malinovsky reported that a
 "group" of atomic submarines had
 several days earlier completed a
 "round-the-world" cruise.   He
 also claimed a five-fold increase
 "in recent times" in the total
 number of long-range cruises by
 Soviet nuclear-powered submarines.
 Malinovsky's comments on the
 ground troops did not suggest any
 basic change in the organizational
 status of these forces as an in-
 tegral component in the defense
 structure.   He noted that conven-
 tional means of warfare had been
 expanded in proportion to the
 development of tactical nuclear
 delivery means for these forces.
 The defense minister stated that
 airborne assault troops had been
 "considerably strengthened," and
 noted that these forces were in  25X1
 a position to perform "great
 strategic missions" in modern
 war.

 POLAND LIMITS FOREIGN ATTENDANCE AT CATHOLIC MILLENNIUM
 Warsaw's decision to bar
 Pope Paul and probably most for-
 eign prelates and tourists from
 the 3 May celebrations of the
 millennium of Christianity in Po-
 land is unlikely to cause serious
 unrest,  in view of Cardinal
 Wyszynski's so far moderate re-
 sponse.   The move to limit in-
 ternational participation prob-
 ably stemmed from the regime's
 failure to obtain concessions
 from the Vatican,  as well as from
 a'desire to underscore its ulti-
 mate control over church actions
 in the foreign policy area.
 These developments were f ore-
 shadowed by an early March letter
 from Premier Cyrankiewicz to the
 Polish episcopate and by subse-
 quent regime statements that
 Wyszynski's failure to seek of-
 ficial permission before invit-
 ing foreign prelates would re-
 sult in the "dashing of his
 hopes."   The regime's decision
 on 17 March to call an apparent
 truce in church-state polemics
 was evidently designed to reduce
 the domestic impact of its in-
 tended scuttling of the papal
 visit and other moves to limit
 the scope of the religious cele-
 brations.
 gime's most sought-after goal ap-
 pears to have been the appoint-
 ment of a Polish cardinal to the
 "Recovered Territories."   This
 would have implied Vatican recog-
 nition of Poland's western fron-
 tier, and somewhat diluted Wyszyn-
 ski's dominance in the Polish
 hierarchy.
 Vatican Radio's sharply
 worded charges on 3 April that
 Warsaw "feared" a papal visit and
 that Soviet pressure is the major
 reason for the Polish antichurch
 campaign reflect the failure of
 both sides to come to terms and
 may result in an increase in
 anti-Vatican propaganda by the
 Polish regime.
 Recent reports that Yugo-
 slav, German, and Austrian:prel-
 ates would also be barred from
 the millennium observance at
 Czestochowa suggests that most,
 if not all,  churchmen from 56
 countries who had been invited
 by Wyszynski will be excluded.
 A Polish Embassy official in
 Washington said on 1 April that
 visas would not be granted to
 US bishops and that Wyszynski
 probably would not come to the
 US this fall.
 Both the Pope and Wyszynski
 have been pressing the Polish
 regime to allow a papal visit,
 believing that it would enhance
 popular identification of church
 and nation and point up the coun-
 try's religious and cultural ties
 with the West.
 both the Vatican
 and Warsaw were hoping that the
 other party would make conces-
 sions to pave the way.   The re-
 The regime's reported plan
 to restrict sharply the number
 of tourists during early May is
 another indication that Warsaw
 is seeking to ensure that the
 church celebration will not over-
 shadow the July observance of the
 millennium of the Polish state.
 There are indications that re-
 strictions on tourist travel will
 be largely rescinded by that

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA STEPS UP ARMS SALES PROGRAM
 Motivated more by the desire
 for economic gain than by polit-
 ical considerations,  the Czechs
 are expanding their arms sales
 to non-Communist underdeveloped
 countries.
 Major military equipment
 programs are handled by the Czech
 Chief Technical Directorate
 (Techsprava),  which participated
 in the initial Soviet military
 aid pacts with non-Communist
 countries in the mid-1950s,  then
 acting principally as Moscow's
 agent.   Techsprava also handles
 negotiations for and construction
 of military facilities such as
 ordnance factories in Egypt,
 Ghana,   and Cambodia.
 Commercial arms sales are
 managed by the Techsprava sub-
 sidiary trade corporation,  Omni-
 pol, which has long sold small
 quantities of light aircraft and
 light arms--which it labels
 "sporting equipment"--to under-
 developed countries.   It appar-
 ently has made the initial con-
 tact with prospective Techsprava
 customers in many cases.   Omnipol
 representatives currently are ac-
 tive throughout Asia and Africa
 and are in contact with some
 Latin American countries.
 Prague apparently is anxious
 to increase arms sales to under-
 developed countries because of
 Czechoslovakia's growing ability
 to produce military hardware,
 its stockpile of obsolescent
 equipment,  and its role as the
 only supplier of the bloc's chief
 jet trainer aircraft.   During
 1963 and 1964,  in deals that may
 have alerted Prague to the pos-
 sibility of expanding profitable
 arms sales,  it sold some $20 mil-
 lion worth of jet trainers to
 Syria and Indonesia.
 Under the largest military
 aid pact  it has concluded in re-
 cent years,                                                                 Czechoslovakia cur-
 rently is supplying India with
 $45 million worth of equipment.
 Over 250 T-54 medium tanks,  some
 field artillery,  ammunition,  air-
 craft spare parts,  and radar
 equipment are now arriving in
 Bombay.   New Delhi's military
 equipment requirements are expected
 to engender additional purchases
 from Prague this year.

 At the 4 April meeting of
 the North Atlantic Council--
 France did not participate--it
 was agreed to establish five work-
 ing groups with "open-ended" mem-
 bership to deal with the main
 France/NATO problem areas identi-
 fied at the 29 March meeting of
 France's 14 NATO partners.   The
 five groups and their "leaders"
 are:   (a) military consequences
 of the French actions--the US;
 (b)  reorganization and streamlin-
 ing of NATO--the UK;  (c)                         infra-
 structure problems and the air
 defense ground environment  (NADGE)
 --Canada and the Netherlands;
 (d)  relocation of NATO commands
 --a consortium of Italian and
 Benelux delegates;  and (e) fi-
 nancial implications--West Ger-
 many.   The Netherlands and Cana-
 dian representatives accepted
 the arrangements ad referendum
 pending approval of their govern-
 ments.
 With regard to the critical
 problem of the future status of
 French troops in Germany,  it was
 agreed that the development of a
 policy should be entrusted to the
 US,  UK,  and Germany.   The Dutch,
 Belgians,  Italians,  and others
 had reservations over this ap-
 proach.   However,  the three-power
 consultative arrangement was ap-
 proved when it was made clear that
 all of the allies would be kept
 informed and consulted before
 any major actions were taken.
 While the alliance now ap-
 pears to be organized to deal
 systematically with the crisis,
 it is still far from clear that
 a common approach has emerged.
 Belgian Foreign Minister Harmel
 has expressed the reservations
 of the 11 smaller NATO countries
 to Ambassador Knight.   He remarked
 that the French attempt to dis-
 associate the less solid members
 among the 11 would undoubtedly
 be made easier if the 11 felt
 they were being ignored by the
 Big Three.   Harmel believes that
 the US should not appear to take
 the lead in any field.   Future
 alliance action must take into
 account two main concerns of the
 smaller countries--Germany's
 power in the alliance must not
 be enhanced as France withdraws,
 and the Gaullist argument that
 NATO is merely an appendage of
 American foreign policy must not
 be reinforced by any US action.
 In France,  a major foreign
 policy debate centering on De
 Gaulle's NATO moves will begin
 on 13 April in the National As-
 sembly.   The Socialist Party and
 the Catholic-oriented Popular
 Republican Movement are expected
 to present a censure motion
 against the government,  although
 the sponsors acknowledge that
 the motion has almost no chance
 of garnering the necessary 242
 votes.   The government can count
 on the solid backing of the Gaul-
 list Union for the New Republic
 (UNR)  and probably the Gaullist-
 allied Independent Republican
 Party.       The French Communist Party
 has publicly announced that it
 will not vote for censure.   UNR
 leaders are optimistic that if
 the censure motion wins only lim-
 ited support,  it will be inter-
 preted as a "vote of confidence"
 for the government.

 MOSCOW'S ATTITUDE TOWARD FRANCE AND NATO
 Moscow is viewing with cau-
 tious approval Do Gaulle's moves
 to withdraw from NATO military
 commands and to renegotiate bi-
 lateral accords on US military
 facilities in France.   The So-
 viets are aware that the French
 initiative has set off a process
 of maneuver and discussion within
 the Western Alliance which can
 have a variety of outcomes,  not
 all of which would be favorable
 to Moscow.   The Soviet course of
 action over the longer run will
 depend heavily on the emerging
 reactions of Washington and Bonn
 and the consequent evolution of
 Western security arrangements
 and negotiating positions.
 The Soviet response thus
 far has included continuing ef-
 forts to court France and to
 foster the belief that Franco-
 Soviet rapport can enhance the
 prospect of new security arrange-
 ments for all Europe.   The So-
 viets probably will present an
 image of reasonableness toward
 those governments showing simi-
 lar signs of "independence."
 Typical of the line the USSR can
 be expected to follow was Soviet
 Ambassador Zorin's recent public
 remark in Paris that "should
 NATO be liquidated there would
 no longer be any need for the
 Warsaw Pact, which would disap-
 pear."   Moscow can also be ex-
 pected to continue to avoid pro-
 vocative statements or actions
 in sensitive areas such as Ber-
 lin,  and to mark time on exist-
 ing negotiating positions.
 Despite the uncertainty of
 the long-term benefits to be de-
 rived from Do Gaulle's initia-
 tive,  the Russians probably are
 pleased with its immediate ef-
 fect of highlighting disagree-
 ments within the Western Alli-
 ance.   At the same time,  the So-
 viets are under no illusion that
 essential problems of European
 security--the German question in
 particular--can be settled with
 France alone.    Moscow's inter-
 ests and objectives obviously
 are much broader than the estab-
 lishment of a bilateral relation-
 ship with France.
 Soviet preoccupation with
 the German problem has been a
 basic reason for Moscow's wish
 to see NATO disrupted.   The very
 primacy of the German question
 to Soviet strategic interests
 in Europe,  however,  also argues
 against any deal between Moscow
 and Do Gaulle that might promote
 a further build-up of West Ger-
 many to fill a gap left by
 France.   It is therefore likely
 that the Soviets do not over-
 estimate Do Gaulle's value, and
 that any entente they form with
 him would not seriously preju-
 dice the position of most West-
 ern European countries on major
 East-West issues.

 Malta's Prime Minister Borg
 Olivier and his Nationalist Party
 have been returned to power with
 a comfortable majority, winning
 28 of the 50 parliamentary seats
 in the first general elections
 since Malta received independence
 in 1964.   His party and the op-
 position Malta Labor Party  (MLP)
 won all the seats in the Maltese
 parliament,  eliminating the three
 small center parties.   The op-
 position MLP made proportionately
 greater gains than anticipated
 both in percentage of total vote
 and the number of seats in par-
 liament.   The MLP can justify,to
 some extent,  its claim that  the
 Catholic Church's last-minute
 intervention in the campaign was
 a decisive factor in its defeat.
 The Nationalist government
 is immediately confronted with
 two tasks--the need to avert eco-
 nomic upheaval following Britain's
 reduction of its base in Malta,
 and to build a viable economy for
 the overpopulated   island.   The
 US Embassy, nevertheless,antici-
 pates a period of relative po-
 litical stability and believes
 that the election results and
 the over-all quality of the new
 parliament herald responsible
 government for the foreseeable
 future,  assure Borg Olivier of
 a stable working majority for
 the next five years, and should
 permit continuation  of the NATO
 headquarters on Malta

 The ouster of Premier George
 Papandreou last July and the en-
 suing prolonged deadlock have
 produced Greece's most serious
 political crisis since the end
 of the guerrilla war in 1949.
 Premier Stephanopoulos'  weak
 government has so far managed to
 ward off the pressures for new
 elections, but it survives only
 because his supporters fear a
 return to power by the popular
 Papandreou.   This uneasy alli-
 ance of conservative and dis-
 affected center factions has had
 little energy for anything be-
 yond survival.   Its main goal
 has been to enact an electoral
 bill, which the leaders of all
 parties support,  and then adjourn
 until next fall.   Stephanopoulos
 hopes that a tax bill designed
 to restore a revenue loss caused
 by the political crisis can be
 approved in principle and then
 referred to a parliamentary re-
 cess committee for final approval.
 would further reduce the mon-
 archy's popular prestige.
 Papandreou's continuing high
 standing with the electorate is
 a cardinal feature of the politi-
 cal maneuvering.   His Center Union
 parliamentary followers,  despite
 their dissatisfaction with his
 leadership,  are unwilling to aban-
 don him and gamble their future
 on a ticket headed by any less
 popular figure.
 The 78-year-old Papandreou
 may now be convinced,  however,
 that he cannot overcome the con-
 servative opposition to his re-
 turn.   There are signs he is
 grooming his son Andreas, who
 served in his government,  for an
 eventual take-over of the Center
 Union.   Andreas has been busy
 mending his political fences. He
 is even more controversial than
 his father,. however.   Conserva-
 tive forces are convinced that
 he is allied with the Communists.
 Much of the talk of dicta-
 torship that was present early
 in the crisis has now abated.
 However,  Stephanopoulos'  in-
 ability to govern effectively,
 the stories of corruption in his
 government,  and the conviction
 of many that there is a moral
 decline in public life have
 fostered a growing tendency
 among conservative groups to
 favor a palace-imposed authori-
 tarian solution.   Such a move
 The main chance for an early
 break in the present stalemate
 would come if the elder Papandreou
 were permanently removed from the
 scene.   Barring that,  there seems
 little likelihood elections will
 come before October or November
 when parliament returns from its
 summer recess.   The Greek ten-
 dency to arrange political com-  25X1
 promises will probably keep the
 government together in the mean-
 time.

 Efforts to case tensions be-
 tween India and Pakistan remain
 stalemated in the aftermath of
 last month's unproductive cabinet-
 level meetings in Rawalpindi.
 Each side is blaming the other
 for blocking progress toward im-
 plementation of the Ayub-Shastri
 agreements reached at Tashkent
 in January.
 In his monthly radio address
 on 1 April  Pakistan's  President
 Ayub criticized Indian leaders
 for their repeated public declar-
 ations that Kashmir is an inte-
 gral part of India.   On the same
 day Pakistan also charged that
 the Indians had failed to with-
 draw their forces from three
 small border salients--40 acres
 25X1    in all--which Rawalpindi asserted
 were controlled by Pakistan be-
 fore the outbreak of hostilities.
 New Delhi,  for its part,
 has accused Pakistan of stepping
 up its propaganda campaign in
 direct violation of the Tashkent
 accords.   In a recent parliamen-
 tary statement Indian External
 Affairs Minister Singh warned
 that India would find it diffi-
 cult to maintain its restraint
 in the face of Pakistani provoca-
 tions.   Indian propaganda broad-
 casts,  quiescent since the Tash-
 kent meeting, have themselves
 become more strident following
 Chinese Communist chief of state
 Liu Shao-chi's state visit to
 West Pakistan last week.   A new
 round of recriminations may be
 touched off by New Delhi's for-

 India's Mizo Hills District--a

 Both India and Pakistan
 still profess an interest in
 keeping the "spirit of Tashkent"

 the vitriolic blasts of the pre-
 Tashkent era.   Nevertheless,

 the prospects of easing tensions.

 Britain, which called a ses-
 sion of the UN Security Council
 for 7 April to discuss the oil
 embargo, has apparently decided
 that stronger measures are needed
 now to prevent oil from reaching
 Rhodesia.   A Foreign Office offi-
 cial told a US Embassy officer
 that if a tanker now at the port
 of Beira in Portuguese Mozambique
 unloads its oil cargo, the British
 may try to get a Security Council
 resolution aimed specifically at
 preventing Portugal from allowing
 oil to be pumped through the pipe-
 line from Beira to the Umtali
 refinery in Rhodesia (see map on
 next page).   The pipeline, operated
 by a Portuguese-dominated firm,
 has not been used since the vol-
 untary sanctions program began
 taking effect last December.
 The UK ambassador in Pretoria
 believes that a tough resolution
 singling out Portugal will also
 help encourage South Africa to
 quietly withdraw its own support
 from Rhodesia.   The US Embassy in
 London also reports a growing feel-
 ing there that the UK should
 "stretch legalities" and act more
 decisively if another tanker at-
 tempts to reach Beira.   The Brit-
 ish halted the first tanker off
 Beira,  but finally let it proceed
 to the port.
 The UN General Assembly's
 Special Committee on Colonialism
 (the "Committee of 24") has passed
 a resolution calling on the Secu-
 rity Council immediately to reopen
 debate on Rhodesia, which African
 members of the  committee hope will
 lead to mandatory sanctions. Eight
 Western and Latin America repre-
 sentatives on the  committee., includ-
 ing the US and UK, expressed reser-
 vations about the resolution.
 The expansion of the Security
 Council's membership earlier this
 year to include more representa-
 tives from Afro-Asian countries
 will make it more difficult to
 block Security Council action
 without a veto by one of the coun-
 cil's permanent members.
 Meanwhile,  the Verwoerd gov-
 ernment in South Africa is report-
 edly reviewing its Rhodesian pol-
 icy, a development which may be
 more important to the Smith regime
 in Salisbury than access to oil 25X1
 from Beira.
 L        Verwoerd's government
 still hopes that some intermedi-
 ary--perhaps   the US--will
 bring Wilson and Smith together
 for a compromise solution.

 Leaders of 11 cast and cen-
 tral African countries meeting
 in Nairobi last week made prog-
 ress toward eliminating tensions
 among themselves and achieved a
 considerable measure of rapport.
 All states from Sudan to
 Zambia,  including Congo  (Leopold-
 ville), were represented either
 by chiefs of state or government
 or by some other high official.
 In view of past and continuing
 feuds between some states,  in-
 formal consultation between such
 men as the Congo's Mobutu and
 Tanzania's Nyerere or between
 Ethiopia's Haile Selassie and
 the Somali Republic's Abdirazak
 would have been virtually impos-
 sible in any but this multilat-
 eral forum.   Mobutu had never
 before attended an African con-
 ference as head of state.
 The leaders dusted off the
 doctrine of noninterference in
 the domestic affairs of other Af-
 rican states.   Growing violations
 of this doctrine had provided
 the main stimulus for the meet-
 ing.   The 11 agreed that refugees
 should not be given press facil-
 ities, military training,  or
 other aid which could be used
 against the governments of their
 own countries.   Nyyerere appears
 to have been the target of com-
 plaints from several countries
 on this score.   He promised to
 circumscribe the activities of
 Malawi exiles in Tanzania,  and
 he had already stopped support-
 ing Congolese rebels.
 During the conference Ken-
 ya's hosting President Kenyatta
 gained some credit by expelling
 two Congolese rebel leaders and
 rounding up several dissidents
 from southern Sudan.   Mobutu's
 talks with Nyerere,  Burundi's
 Biha,  Uganda's Obote, and Sudan's
 Magoub concerning the Congolese
 insurgents reportedly were en-
 couraging to him--presumably on
 the grounds of preventing any
 resumption of supplies.   On his
 way home Mobutu visited Uganda
 and Burundi where he agreed to
 open embassies.
 On Rhodesia,  the conferees
 proposed no further action them-
 selves.   Instead,                                                                      they passed a
 resolution calling on Britain to
 take action against the Smith
 regime more decisive than the
 present economic sanctions. They
 proposed that the UN act under
 Chapter Seven of its charter to
 impose mandatory economic and
 military sanctions as the answer
 to South African and Portuguese
 aid to Rhodesia.
 The African leaders evi-
 dently made no plans to meet
 again or to institutionalize
 themselves in what would have
 been construed as a factional
 threat to the enfeebled Organi-
 zation of African Unity.   In-
 deed,  they were careful in their
 comments to underline their con-
 tinued support for the all-Af-
 rica  organization and for a con-
 tinent-wide approach to African
 problems.

 BOSCH DOMINATES DOMINICAN POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
 Juan Bosch has dominated
 recent political developments in
 the Dominican Republic.   His Do-
 minican Revolutionary Party  (PRD)
 plans to commemorate the anniver-
 sary of the 24 April Revolution
 through a series of celebrations
 --a move designed to undercut
 other aspiring "constitutionalist"
 leaders.
 In a 3 April radio address
 Bosch praised former rebel leader
 Caamano and noted that his vice-
 presidential candidacy on the
 PRD slate would be advantageous.
 In the past Bosch has considered
 Caamano a rival for leadership
 of the left but he may now feel
 that a Bosch-Caamano ticket is
 the strongest the PRD could put
 up for the June elections.
 In a 4 April conversation
 with a US official, Bosch sug-
 gested that Caamano might even
 head the PRD ticket.   The pur-
 pose of this ploy--which Bosch
 made in private while in a de-
 pressed mood--is not clear. The
 PRD leader may be attempting to
 shock US officials into conclud-
 ing that his candidacy would be
 a more satisfactory alternative
 than Caamano's.   On the other
 hand,  the statement may reflect
 Bosch's real thinking, since he
 has given indications he has
 little stomach for the demands of
 the presidency,  particularly un-
 der the ever present threat of
 military overthrow.   In any event,
 Bosch's electoral intentions
 should be made clearer this week"
 end when the PRD holds its nom-
 inating convention.
 Bosch has also attracted
 public attention by delivering
 daily radio orations. attacking
 accusations linking him with
 Communism.   During the 1962 cam-
 paign Bosch effectively exploited
 similar charges and appears
 again to have found an audience.
 Rival political broadcasters
 have commented that Bosch's pro-
 grams have outdrawn their own.
 Bosch's rival,  Joaquin Bala-
 guer, has been continuing his
 campaign, concentrating on the
 rural areas where his Reformist
 Party (PR) appears to have con-
 siderable support.                                                                                        A develop-
 ing contest over the PR vice-
 presidential nomination may en-
 liven what promises to be a rou-
 tine party convention slated    25X1

 ECUADOR UDDER PROVISIONAL PRESIDENT YEROVI
 Ecuador's provisional Presi-
 dent Yerovi in his first week in
 office   has proved to be a weak
 executive,  inclined to permis-
 siveness toward pressure groups,
 who sees himself primarily as a
 caretaker until a constituent as-
 sembly is convened.
 The cabinet consists mostly
 of little-known older men divided
 fairly evenly between residents
 of the coast and the sierra.
 Some are considered able and
 honest, but they are a colorless
 group whose capabilities are un-
 proven.   Business and finance
 predominate   in their backgrounds,
 although thu education minister
 is a leftist intellectual chosen
 to placate rebellious students.
 Yerovi apparently contem-
 plates a constituent assembly,
 to convene sometime in the autumn,
 and intends to name a special
 committee to draft regulations
 for its election.   The junta's
 constitutional reform decrees
 have been nullified, and specific
 plans for transition to constitu-
 tional rule will be left to the
 assembly.
 The country team believes
 that Yerovi's "inexperience and
 irresolution" are blunting the
 government's capacity to assure
 internal security.   Although at-
 tempts by extremists to take over
 towns and provinces failed--and
 student agitation has ended,
 extremist groups remain a poten-
 tial danger, since Yerovi seems
 to attach little significance to
 their activities.   Exiles have
 been allowed to return, and sub-
 versives freed from prison re-
 portedly hope to get into action
 soon.
 Yerovi has removed the com-
 mander of the national police,
 and that organization is receiv-
 ing insufficient financial sup-
 port from the government.
 After naming as minister of
 defense a little-known lawyer,
 Yerovi dismissed both the army
 commander and the chief of the
 armed forces General Staff when
 they called to protest the re-
 lease of subversives and capitula-
 tion to the demands of groups
 with complaints against the for-
 mer regime.   Many ranking officers
 have been retired,  left without
 assignments, or shuffled from
 key posts.   Concern has grown
 within the army over government
 security policies and,  although
 reluctant to resume power, it may
 take action against Yerovi if

 the security structure is further
 debilitated.
 Two prominent Guayaquil
 politicians,  in a discussion with
 the US ambassador,  confirmed that
 vested interests will be no more
 tolerant of imperative economic
 reforms if applied by Yerovi
 than they were of those decreed
 by the junta.   Mentioning that
 Yerovi at best has a "temporary
 and somewhat precarious mandate,"
 they claimed that new taxes would
 be suicidal.   Predictably,  they
 contemplated US financial assist-
 ance--rather than a responsible
 attitude among men like themselves
 --as the immediate solution.
 Yerovi probably will seek some
 t   e of emergency US loan.

 making official his candidacy

 asked for an indefinite release

 ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT WITHSTANDING COUP RUMORS AND STRIKES
 Despite a wave of coup ru-
 mors in-Argentina attendant on a
 series of transportation strikes
 and dissatisfaction over con-
 tinuing inflation,   the govern-
 ment of President Arturo Illia
 does not appear to be in danger
 of falling soon.   Government ef-
 forts to end the strikes and
 deal with pressing economic
 problems,  in combination with
 a strong statement by military
 leaders that they have no inten-
 tion of intervening against the
 Illia administration, may serve
 to settle the unrest that has
 agitated Buenos Aires since the
 end of the summer vacation pe-
 riod in February.
 The government put a stop
 to a bus strike in the capital
 by seizing buses and threatening
 to turn them over to government
 operators.   A personal appeal by
 Illia caused postponement of one
 railroad strike,  although another
 was subsequently held.   Air force
 personnel have been operating
 the national airline and air
 force guards have been used to
 maintain order at Buenos Aires
 Airport.   The government has
 also taken steps to end the sugar
 strike in Tucuman, which has
 dragged on since late in 1965.
 The military leaders made
 their statement in a War Office
 communiqu6 of 1 April.   The dec-
 laration reinforced the stand of
 the military "legalist" leader-
 ship that,  while it has not re-
 nounced its role as guardian of
 the constitution,  it would pre-
 fer that the civilians find their
 own answers to the nation's prob-
 lems.                                                            The statement was a re-
 buff  to politicians and some re-
 tired military officers who see
 a coup as an easy way to gain
 power for themselves.
 The provincial election in
 Mendoza on 17 April, which will
 probably result in victory for
 Illia's People's Radical Party
 (UCRP), may be another factor
 in strengthening the government's
 position.    The Peronists,   who
 have been badly split by internal
 squabbling,   have been unable to
 unite in a common front against
 the UCRP.   A defeat for the Pe-
 ronists in Mendoza could lead to
 a further weakening of the move-
 ment.                                                            The possibility of a Pe-
 ronist victory in the national
 elections in 1967 has been con-
 sidered one of the major causes
 of the coup rumors,  and a con-
 tinued weakening of Peronism
 would favor the government.
