 Key Judgments          China has pressed the merger of its military and civilian R&D organiza-

 notably the six military machine-building industries, are being integrated
 with civilian industry. The aim is to lift the technological levels of military
 industry and enlarge its contribution to overall development of the
 economy.
 Resistance within the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the military-
 industrial establishment had prevented reform of military industry until
 1981, although the civilian sector had been committed to reform as early as
 the Third Plenum of the CCP Central Committee in 1978. The 1979
 attack on Vietnam, however, showed that Chinese weaponry was inferior
 and demonstrated the need to abandon the traditional Chinese emphasis
 upon quantity in favor of higher quality military production:
 ? The military subsequently was given assurance that defense programs
 would continue to be given a high, if not the highest, priority in Beijing's
 decisions on how its limited resources will be allocated.
 ? The military was also assured that it would have initial use of all new
 technology developed or acquired abroad.
 We believe the organizational and policy changes introduced since 1981
 will have major impact on future Chinese military and civilian industrial
 activity:
 ? Planning of military and civilian S&T and industrial activity will be
 increasingly centralized.
 ? Military and civilian research institutes and factories will be consolidated
 into specialized research and production combines.
 ? Acquisition of advanced foreign technologies and equipment will be
 stepped up.
 The relationships among the many new organizations that are to imple-
 ment the new policies are still evolving, and we believe the process will not
 go smoothly. Some elements in the military still resist the new policies, and
 bureaucratic inertia and organizational rivalries continue to slow the effort.
 Nevertheless, we believe that Beijing will benefit:
 ? There will be a more systematic ordering of priorities. This could
 eliminate some of the wasteful duplication of past Chinese efforts to
 acquire technology and equipment abroad.

 ? Although military needs will remain paramount, civilian industry will
 also profit from increased access to technology developed or acquired for
 military purposes.
 ? Increased production of civilian goods by military industry should also be
 a plus-for the military in terms of greater use of idle capacity and
 increased revenues; for the civilian economy in terms of larger quantities
 of badly needed producer and consumer goods.
 The concentration on key industrial and S&T projects implied by these
 policy changes may already be starting to bear fruit. China's new
 "Galaxy" computer was developed by combining the talents of both
 military and civilian research organizations and using both domestically
 produced and imported components.
 The closer military-civilian relationship will pose new problems for the
 United States in monitoring Chinese weapons programs and in implement-
 ing the export control system:
 ? The merger of military and civilian institutes and factories into special-
 ized combines will further obscure Chinese progress in the strategic and
 special mission areas as will newly tightened security measures in
 Chinese research and production facilities and on Chinese personnel.
 ? Determining the military or civilian status of end users of US and
 Western technology exports will become far more difficult.
 ? If China follows through on its stated preference for acquiring US
 technologies, other members of COCOM may become even more
 reluctant to agree to further liberalization of export restrictions.
 ? The new policies also increase the likelihood of closer military linkages to
 joint ventures and similar technology transfer mechanisms. These types
 of transactions may become a more sensitive issue in COCOM delibera-
 tions than the export of particular pieces of equipment and machinery.

 China: Changes in
 Military Industrial
 Development Policy
 Laying the Groundwork (1978-81)
 The Need for Policy Change. When China began to
 develop its military-industrial base during the First
 Five-Year Plan (1953-57) it drew heavily on Soviet
 organizational experience. The defense industrial and
 scientific establishment operated as an independent
 and self-sustaining entity well insulated from the
 civilian industrial sector. By late 1965, the heart of
 China's military-industrial establishment comprised
 six consecutively numbered defense industrial minis-
 tries, the Second through Seventh Machine Building
 Ministries.' These were tasked respectively for the
 research, development, and manufacture of nuclear
 weapons, aircraft, electronics, land armaments, naval
 ships, and ballistic missiles. The defense industrial
 system enjoyed greater financial and political support
 than the non-military-industrial sector. It received
 special treatment in the allocation of scarce re-
 sources-scientists and technicians, precision machin-
 ery and instrumentation, and high-quality materi-
 als-to the detriment of the civilian economy.
 Military research and development (R&D) was kept
 separate from manufacturing throughout most of the
 defense industrial ministries, however, and this tended
 to slow technological progress in weapons production.
 Until 1979, China's policy for both military and
 civilian industrial development emphasized large-
 scale expansion of capacity through both indigenous
 construction and importation of turnkey facilities.
 Various domestic construction programs, such as the
 Great Leap Forward (1958-60), had little effect on
 military industry. In contrast, the so-called war prepa-
 rations effort that began in 1961 had a long-lasting
 impact on military industry. For 10 years or more
 China invested massive amounts of labor and capital
 into moving its heavy industrial and defense facilities
 from coastal and central areas to remote locations,
 including mountain valleys and caves, to make them
 Acquisitions of foreign plants and equipment-from
 the Soviet Union in the 1950s and from Japan and
 Western Europe in the 1960s and 1970s-significant-
 ly increased China's industrial capacity and provided
 the basis for a fairly sophisticated industrial complex.
 Little attention was given, however, to improving the
 technological capabilities of these facilities. After the
 first generation of merchandise was produced, there
 was no follow-on research and development of new
 product types. In some cases the products of civilian
 and military industry have remained unchanged for
 Many of these problems were the result of the Soviet-
 style planning introduced in the 1950s, under which
 factory managers paid attention to output quotas and
 little else. With few, if any, rewards for technical
 innovation, factory managers had little incentive to
 develop close ties with research units. Those links that
 did develop were usually conducted through unofficial
 channels and were aimed at maintaining the existing
 level of production rather than developing new prod-
 ucts or more efficient manufacturing methods.
 The gap between research and production was partic-
 ularly acute within the defense industrial system. The
 problem resulted from a division of responsibility,
 beginning in the late 1950s, between the National
 Defense Industries Office (NDIO) and the National
 Defense Science and Technology Commission
 (NDSTC). The NDIO ostensibly was responsible for
 serial weapons production, while the NDSTC was
 charged with research and development. The NDIO,
 however, had also assumed control over conventional
 weapons research in the mid-1960s, and there was
 little pressure from the NDIO's primary customer,
 less vulnerable to foreign attack.
 ' The First Ministry of Machine Industry was established in 1952
 and, although its production tasking has frequently been modified,
 is charged with design and production of machinery used in the

 the General Logistics Department of the PLA, for
 new weapons development. Moreover, the ministries
 under direct NDIO administration-the Third
 through Sixth-did not want to risk failure attempt-
 ing any new weapons designs. Because there were few
 strategic weapons available for series production in
 the 1960s, the NDSTC retained the manufacturing
 functions of the Second and Seventh (nuclear weapons
 and missiles) MMBs, in addition to its remaining
 research and development responsibilities.
 After the death of Mao Zedong in September 1976
 and continuing until early 1978, Beijing's military
 and civilian planners pursued industrialization poli-
 cies of expanding industrial capacity. Growth of
 China's major defense industrial facilities continued,
 and large quantities of obsolete weaponry were serial-
 ly produced. And with new emphasis being given to
 acquiring weapons technology from abroad, indige-
 nous R&D continued to be slighted. An ambitious
 program, however, was being undertaken on the civil-
 ian side to import entire industrial complexes from
 abroad.
 By early 1978 Beijing began to reassess its military
 and civilian industrial programs and to question the
 need for additional capacity to manufacture an in-
 creasing amount of obsolete equipment. In January
 1978 the theoretical group of the NDSTC argued
 publicly that the key to a modern national defense
 was priority development of science and technology
 and the national economy. At the same time, critics of
 China's policy of importing complete plants were
 debating the wisdom of relying totally on foreign
 suppliers for turnkey facilities when portions of these
 plants could be produced domestically. The implica-
 tion of these arguments became clearer in December
 1978 when Beijing called for a closer coordination of
 military and civilian resource allocation and greater
 military involvement in nonmilitary manufacture.F_
 Reforming the Industrial Base
 The December 1978 meeting'of the Third Plenum of
 the 11th Central Committee and the decisions made
 for readjustment, reorganization, and reform of the
 economy in general and the machine-building indus-
 try in particular marked a major turning point in
 military and civilian industrial cooperation and pre-
 pared the way for China's current economic restruc-
 turing effort. These proceedings reaffirmed earlier
 calls for the defense industrial sector to direct its work
 to both military and civilian purposes.
 the principles governing military
 production of civilian goods adopted by the Beijing
 leadership in mid-1978 were
 aimed at
 maintaining a large standby defense production ca-
 pacity during peacetime that would be supported and
 camouflaged by commercial activity and civilian pro-
 duction. In addition, military production was to focus
 on strategic tasks, and more emphasis was to be
 placed on research and development of new weapon
 systems.
 F4ffects of Readjustment. China's efforts to reorganize
 and reform its machine-building industry began to
 accelerate with the establishment of the State Ma-
 chine Building Commission (SMBC) in February
 1980.' The responsibilities of this commission-which
 was headed by Vice Premier Bo Yibo-were to
 restructure and upgrade all machine-building indus-
 tries in China.
 Transport, and the Ministry of Railways.
 The SMBC made substantial progress throughout
 1980 and 1981 restructuring the various industries
 under its control. In addition to the Electronics and
 Shipbuilding Ministries, the SMBC also was tasked to
 oversee readjustment and reform of the Ministries of
 Machine Building and Agricultural Machinery, the
 machine-building bureaus within the Ministries of the
 Coal Industry, Petroleum Industry, Building Materi-
 als Industry, Textile Industry, Light Industry, Marine

 ished in May 1982 and its readjustment responsibilities were

 Many small plants were merged or consolidated with
 other facilities to enhance specialized production.
 Improvements also were made in the organizational
 structure and management of larger facilities. A
 number of economic combines formed on the basis of
 product specialization were established within the
 machine-building industries. Several were given au-
 thority to function beyond respective ministerial and
 provincial boundaries and to engage in foreign trade.
 Significant progress was made in readjusting the
 electronics and shipbuilding industries. Readjust-
 ments within the electronics sector resulted in in-
 creased output through specialized production, new
 product lines, production of new civilian goods, and
 improved industrial technologies and product quality
 through closer cooperation between research and pro-
 duction.
 Reshaping Science and Technology
 Need for New Technology. Despite the accomplish-
 ments in some sectors of the machine industry, there
 was a growing awareness within the leadership that
 most of China's military and civilian industrial facili-
 ties suffered severe technical deficiencies. To promote
 a revitalization of these enterprises, actions recom-
 mended by the Beijing reformers included a greater
 diffusion of R&D achievements, and a direct transfer
 of technology from the military to the civilian sector.
 Methods for transferring technology to the civilian
 sector were to include: (1) using part of the military
 production capacity to manufacture civilian goods
 that were badly needed; (2) transferring military
 research and design personnel to civilian facilities to
 provide technical service and technological support;
 (3) providing the civilian sector with the results of
 military research as technological spinoffs for nonmil-
 itary production.
 In April 1981 the Chinese Government adopted a new
 science and technology policy for the development of
 the national economy. The new policy stressed Chi-
 na's need to: intensify research and development of
 new production technology; increase the spread of
 R&D achievements for use in advanced industrial and
 agricultural production; and to assimilate foreign
 S&T achievements into the domestic S&T establish-
 Convincing the Critics. The 1979 Chinese attack on
 Vietnam played an important role in weakening mili-
 tary opposition to moving China's military industry
 into new ways of operating. Vietnamese weaponry was
 more advanced and superior to Chinese arms.
 a major conclusion
 emerging from Chinese postmortems was the need to
 abandon traditional emphasis upon quantity in favor
 of higher quality military production. This would
 require new efforts to strengthen China's capabilities
 for both military and civilian research and
 development.
 The change in the military's position began to emerge
 at the December 1981 sessions of the National Peo-
 ple's Congress (NPC). In his published report to the
 NPC, Premier Zhao Ziyang amended the S&T policy
 announced in April with a plan that was more appeal-
 ing to the military in terms of its initial use and
 application of all new technology and achievements.
 The plan emphasized four types of technology trans-
 fers: from laboratory to production; from military use
 to both military and civilian use; from coastal regions
 to the inland; and from foreign countries to China.
 the Army and state and between Army and people
 were at an alltime low and that the military's contin-
 ued resistance to the new policies had become a
 particularly serious matter.
 The PLA deputies and other members of the NPC
 reportedly acceded to party and government demands
 that China's defense industry in peacetime would
 concentrate research and development on new weap-
 onry but that the bulk of the defense industry's
 production capacity would be diverted to nonmilitary
 manufacture.
 (there was also agreement
 that: (1) major defense industrial facilities would
 retain the capability to design, develop, trial-produce,
 and manufacture small quantities of weaponry; (2)
 military factories within the defense industrial system
 would be incorporated into economic combines along
 with nonmilitary enterprises, based on their particular
 specialization; and (3) that these economic combines

 would be given a certain autonomy in foreign trade
 and a share of the foreign exchange earnings. There
 was also agreement that the defense industry would
 be included as part of the unified state plan, with the
 provision that the weapons manufacturing responsibil-
 ities of defense facilities would be given appropriate
 attention when these plans were made.
 Organizing the Bureaucracy
 Many NPC members reportedly expressed concern
 that the government would be unable to implement its
 new policy because of resistance from middle-level
 cadre to programs that they believed endangered their
 vested interests. Beijing pushed forward with its in-
 dustrial integration and technology development plan
 despite these misgivings. In March 1982 Zhao Ziyang
 announced a major reorganization of the state bu-
 reaucracy. A subsequent shakeup shifted the orienta-
 tion of the machine-building ministries from servicing
 primarily heavy industrial and military construction
 to advancing the technological level of the entire
 country.
 The State Council's new structural organization pro-
 vides China the necessary framework to coordinate
 military and civilian research,. development, and pro-
 duction program (see figure 1). As in the past, major
 policy decisions are made by the Politburo and Cen-
 tral Committee and, in the defense area, the Military
 Commission of the Chinese Communist Party.
 Under the State Council, four commissions are known
 to be involved in coordinating plans for China's
 industrial modernization effort.' These are the State
 Planning Commission (SPC), the State Science and
 Technology Commission (SSTC), the State Economic
 Commission (SEC) and the National Defense Science,
 Technology and Industry Commission (NDSTIC).
 The SPC is responsible for formulating long-term
 plans and an annual plan for national economy and
 social development. The SEC is responsible for the
 day-to-day implementation and coordination of annu-
 al plans and also for the adjustment and reform
 functions previously assigned to the SMBC.
 'So far, there is no evidence that the new State Military Commis-
 sion, established in December 1982, plays a role in these activities.
 Perhaps the single most powerful entity to emerge
 from the bureaucratic reshuffling was the NDSTIC,
 which was formed through a merger of the NDIO and
 the NDSTC. The NDSTIC is responsible for the
 managing and coordinating of all military research,
 development, and production. With the SPC and the
 SEC, it jointly formulates the national defense indus-
 try plan and a national defense science and technology
 plan. The NDSTIC also is the focal point for major
 redirections of military-industrial and scientific re-
 sources and has considerable influence in the selection
 and purchase of military and dual-use technologies.
 In January 1983 a special supraministerial body was
 established directly under the State Council to coordi-
 nate national scientific and technological activities.
 This organization, the Science and Technology Lead-
 ing Group, is headed by Premier Zhao Ziyang and is
 composed of senior representatives from all leading
 economic, education, research, and defense R&D
 sectors as well as the various commissions of the State
 Council. Its major tasks include improving the links
 between defense and civilian scientific and technologi-
 cal entities, coordinating the program for foreign
 technology acquisition and technical transformation
 of enterprises, and overseeing all scientific and tech-
 nological planning and policy formulation from a
 unified perspective. One of the research bodies to
 which the leading group funnels research projects and
 from which it gets feedback is the SSTC's National
 Research Center for Science and Technology for
 Development (NRCSTD), which plays a major role in
 formulating China's science and technology research
 and development strategy.
 China also announced in March 1983 the establish-
 ment of a Special Defense Coordinating Committee
 that would be in charge of both military research and
 the armament industry.
 this new organization may serve as a liaison
 between defense and civilian industries on production
 problems. It is still unclear how this organization's
 function fits in with the responsibilities of the
 NDSTIC.

 Beijing's determination to pursue a new course of
 military industrial development was underlined by the
 appointment of Gen. Zhang Aiping as Minister of
 Defense in August 1982. As director of the former
 NDSTC, Zhang had been a key figure in the Chinese
 military R&D establishment since the mid-1970s.
 Since 1982 he has been the most prominent spokes-
 man for the new policies and has been instrumental in
 persuading military officials and officials in the minis-
 tries of nuclear industry, aeronautics, ordnance, and
 astronautics to cooperate in using defense production
 capacity for national economic construction.
 A Plan for Action. By August 1983 Beijing apparently
 was confident that it had garnered enough support
 within the military-industrial system to press its mili-
 tary-civilian merger plans publicly. In an unusually
 candid article in Liberation Army Daily, Zhang
 presented a, number of sweeping proposals for speed-
 ing up the modernization of China's national defense.
 These proposals embodied the decisions reached in
 December 1981, as well as many additional sugges-
 tions that the Defense Minister had made in the 12
 months after his appointment. Zhang noted that
 although China's defense research and industrial base
 was extensive, its capabilities were considerably be-
 hind those of developed countries, and its weaponry
 and equipment did not meet the demands of modern
 war. Zhang noted that, since the state had to concen-
 trate its money and material on key construction
 projects and could not allocate additional funds to
 military construction, the only alternative was for the
 defense industry to accomplish its modernization un-
 der existing conditions. He proposed the following
 steps:
 ? In peacetime the armed forces would cut troops and
 streamline operations.
 ? Outmoded weapons and equipment would be dis-
 carded and, apart from meeting the needs of border
 defense units and training, no old weapons would be
 held in reserve.
 ? The defense industry's production capacity would be
 diverted to civilian manufacture and armament
 production urgently needed in military training.
 ? Military research activity would increase with the
 focus on specific R&D projects.
 ? Renovation of existing military equipment would be
 stepped up.
 ? The research and manufacturing capabilities of
 defense facilities would be used to develop and
 produce civilian goods for domestic use and foreign
 export.
 ? Savings made through reduced production of mili-
 tary equipment would be used to develop new
 weapons and equipment. Some of the revenue gener-
 ated through civilian production would be used to
 develop technology-intensive defense industries.
 Zhang's proposals are consistent with the major
 changes that have occurred in overall Chinese defense
 modernization strategy and are now occurring within
 the defense industry.' Resources and material that
 have in the past been dedicated to supporting defense
 production are now beginning to be diffused through-
 out the economy. In nonferrous metals, for example,
 factories that were previously subordinate to an indi-
 vidual defense-related industrial ministry, such as the
 Ministry of Aeronautic Industry, are now being ad-
 ministered at the national level by the China Nonfer-
 rous Metals Industrial Corporation through affiliates
 such as the China Huaxing Tungsten Corporation.
 The Huaxing Corporation is responsible for coordi-
 nating the planning, pricing, purchasing, and supply-
 ing of all tungsten metal throughout China in addition
 to popularizing new products and promoting scientific
 research within the industry.
 In September 1983, the SPC, SEC, and NDSTIC
 held a conference with China's military and provincial
 industrial leaders. The conference formally endorsed
 Zhang Aiping's earlier proposals and discussed a

 military-civilian industrial cooperation plan. The pur-
 pose of the meeting was to: (1) relay the instructions of
 the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and
 the Military Affairs Commission on transferring mili-
 tary technology to civilian use; (2) plan and arrange
 for the military's research and production of civilian
 goods; and (3) mobilize the defense research and
 industrial facilities to serve national economic mod-
 ernization objectives. A decision also was made to
 incorporate defense production of civilian goods into
 the State plan for the remainder of the Sixth Five-
 Year Plan (1981-85) and in the Seventh Five-Year
 system. According to one Chinese official, this three-
 generation process of importing and absorbing foreign
 technology is China's definition of self-reliance. F_
 Plan (1986-90).
 Emphasis on Weapons Research
 Because research and development of conventional
 weaponry had been largely ignored in the past by both
 the NDIO and the defense industries, China is now
 attempting to upgrade its capabilities in this area by
 renovating existing conventional weapons systems and
 stepping up development of an indigenous R&D pro-
 gram. A similar problem has been avoided in the
 strategic weapons sector because the NDSTIC con-
 trolled both the research and production of nuclear
 weapons and ballistic missiles
 China is attempting to apply more sophisticated
 methods to its conventional weapons renovation and
 development programs by introducing systems engi-
 neering, integration, and design concepts into the
 overall process. It is making efforts to implement a
 "three-generations" weapons development policy-
 improving of one-generation, developing another gen-
 eration, and preparing for the development of a
 follow-on generation. For example, Beijing is current-
 ly upgrading a number of indigenously developed
 weapon systems including antitank missiles, air-to-air
 missiles, and radar, while looking to Western suppli-
 ers for the "second-generation" technology. Beijing is
 aware that much of weapons technology it may
 acquire from abroad will not be state of the art. Thus,
 its indigenous research capability must be upgraded
 in order to improve on this imported technology and to
 develop a Chinese style "third-generation" weapon
 New Methods of Management. China's use of systems
 engineering techniques has been strongly encouraged
 by Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders and is
 being widely applied to the management of military
 R&D activity. China has introduced a technical com-
 mand system into the defense industrial system that
 appears to be patterned after the chief designer
 systems used in the USSR and the United States. The   25X1
 Chinese system makes a specific individual officially
 responsible for a particular weapons development
 project at each level of the technological hierarchy.
 This individual can come from industry, an institute,
 or from within the military.
 China also has established a contingent of
 factory-based military representatives from each of
 the armed services who will be responsible for ensur-
 ing that the quality of weaponry produced meets the
 expectations of the respective military organization.F
 In addition, Beijing is responding to the problem of
 having too many research institutes engaged in over-
 lapping activities by limiting the research within these
 facilities to specifically assigned tasks such as antiair,
 antitank, and electronic countermeasure systems re-
 search. To make more judicious use of its R&D
 resources Beijing also is attempting to bring about
 closer cooperation between military and civilian re-
 searchers and technicians and to increase military
 participation in the development of nonmilitary equip-
 ment. China also is stepping up efforts to promote

 closer cooperation between research and production in
 its key manufacturing enterprises by installing new or
 additional research units within these facilities.
 The Research and Production Combine
 Beijing's decision to formalize cooperation between
 military and civilian research and production presages
 significant structural changes in China's military-
 industrial organization, particularly below the minis-
 terial level. Until now, China's defense plants have
 been supervised by an unwieldly, though identifiable,
 system that subordinated them to the provincial bu-
 reaus of their parent ministry and the provincial
 bureaus of the National Defense Industries Office
 (NDIO). As now planned, many defense research and
 production facilities will be merged into joint research
 and production combines.
 As the various defense industrial ministries merge
 their subordinate facilities with nonmilitary enter-
 prises, the identity and function of the individual
 defense industrial facility will become obscured.
 These economic entities will be headed by boards of
 directors. Within each economic region or key munici-
 pality, such as Shanghai or Tianjin, there is a supervi-
 sory body for research and production and a science
 commission whose functions are to administer the
 various corporations within the area jointly with
 assistance from local authorities and to report these
 activities to the State Council.
 A number of the specialized research and production
 corporations that have been only recently formed
 seem to be at least administratively responsible to a
 military control element. The Tianjin Machine Tool
 works, for example, is a regional corporation compris-
 ing machine tool, heavy machinery, and off-highway
 equipment plants and several research facilities. The
 director of this conglomerate is
 an active duty PLA general who was assigned tot e
 unit in 1983 as part of a nationwide program to
 improve efficiency in key Chinese industries.
 ]senior
 PLA officers are now being placed in charge of many
 other large regional groupings of key industries.F_
 Each civilian element within a military-controlled
 research and production corporation appears to re-
 main subordinate to its civilian parent unit in all
 aspects except research, design, and technology trans-
 fer, which are activities administered by military
 control elements within the corporation. The manu-
 facturing process reportedly is a combined activity up
 to the final assembly or packaging stage. And where
 the military and civilian product are the same, coordi-
 nated production continues through final manufac-
 ture. Where the military production process is highly
 specialized, for example, nuclear weapons, there
 would be little or no civilian involvement.
 The research and production corporations that have
 been observed so far appear to be organized along the
 same regional boundaries as the country's new eco-
 nomic regions or priority investment zones. These
 economic regions are planned by China to be focal
 points for 90 percent of all foreign investment and an
 increasing share of domestic investment. At least
 eight priority investment zones have been established
 thus far, including the Northeast Zone, the Beijing-
 Tianjin Zone, the Shanghai Zone, the Min River
 Zone, the Pearl River Delta Zone, the Wuhan Zone,
 the Central China Zone, and the North China Zone.
 A number of joint military and civilian regional
 industrial companies have been formed over the past
 year in Chongqing (Central China Zone) as part of a
 State Council economic experiment. The Ministry of
 Ordnance Industry (MOI) as well as the China State
 Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) reportedly cooper-
 ated with Chongqing authorities in working out plans
 for the joint production of military and civilian goods.
 The CSSC also has regional shipbuilding industry
 companies in Shanghai (Shanghai Zone), Guangzhou
 (Pearl River Delta Zone), Tianjin (Beijing-Tianjin
 Zone), and Wuhan (Wuhan Zone).
 Contract research and the establishment of consultan-
 cies also are becoming additionally significant forms
 of cooperation between the research community and
 industrial enterprises. Funding from these types of

 technical exchange are key sources of revenue for
 both military and civilian universities and institutes.
 For example, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has
 signed agreements with several universities to initiate
 long-term research in several of its priority areas.
 Jointly managed research centers also are being es-
 tablished on some university campuses to intensify
 cooperation between research and production.
 The defense industry has only recently started to
 introduce new and extensive forms of technology
 cooperation with the civilian sector. Among these
 exchanges is a long-term technical cooperation agree-
 ment that was signed between the NDSTIC and the
 city of Tianjin. The agreement enables 38 of China's
 military research institutes to cooperate with 80 civil-
 ian industrial facilities in manufacturing military and
 civilian products. A similar agreement also is being
 arranged by the NDSTIC with Sichuan Province.
 Another first in defense science and technology ex-
 change is the recent establishment of a consultancy
 corporation under the auspices of the Ministry of
 Astronautic Industry (MOAI) -the defense industrial
 ministry responsible for China's ballistic missile and
 space development. The corporation offers the serv-
 ices of the MOAI's 60,000 technicians to provide
 expertise in introducing and appraising foreign tech-
 nology that is being imported by civilian industrial
 enterprises. Other military research organizations are
 beginning to augment their research budgets with
 revenues received from supplying technical expertise
 to civilian firms on a contractual basis
 Linking the R&D Community
 Combining the research and production unit is only
 one of several methods China is using to forge closer
 ties between its military and civilian industrial enter-
 prises and the R&D community (see figure 2). This
 form of cooperation is limited in that it can only bring
 together universities and industrial facilities located
 within the same general area.
 China's research and development system comprises
 about 4,300 facilities and employs more than 425,000
 researchers; there are more than 6 million scientific
 and technical personnel throughout China. The prin-
 cipal elements of the research system are the Chinese
 Academy of Sciences (CAS) and its affiliated insti-
 tutes, the institutes under the direction of the Minis-
 try of Education (MOE), those under various industri-
 al ministries, the local research sector, and the
 national defense research units.
 Based on recent Chinese claims, in 1983 there were    25X1
 119 research institutes affiliated with the CAS and
 more than 900 civilian research institutions under the
 jurisdiction of ministries and commissions of the State
 Council.                            there are 200     25X1
 or more research facilities within the defense industri-
 al system that are not included in China's published
 statistics. These are the most advanced research
 facilities in China and are staffed by some of the
 country's most accomplished researchers and techni-  25X1
 cians. Many Chinese students now studying in the
 United States come from these institutes.
 Engineering education ranks as China's highest aca-
 demic priority. Approximately one-third of the million
 or more college-level students in China are studying
 engineering. About 100,000 of engineers graduate
 from Chinese universities each year-a figure sur-
 passed only by the Soviet Union. In addition, China
 reportedly has some 20,000 students studying abroad
 who are engaged in science and technology and
 related management curriculums. As shown in appen-
 dix A, the majority of China's college-level students
 are engaged in a standard four- to five-year curricu-
 lum. In an effort to expand its body of engineer-
 technicians, China is developing a shortened engineer-
 ing curriculum that would provide the senior          25X1
 technicians needed to fill intermediate positions be-
 tween the university-level engineer and the technician
 produced by specialized secondary schools (see
 table 1).
 In addition to its research organizations China has
 over 106 science and engineering associations and
 societies affiliated with the China Association for
 Science and Technology (CAST). CAST is a multidis- 25X1
 ciplinary science and technology organization that is

 directly subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party.
 Its objectives are to enhance public understanding of
 science and technology and make significant contribu-
 tions to the rapid advance of China's expertise in this
 area. As part of this function, CAST's responsibilities
 involve: organizing both domestic and international
 academic exchanges and symposiums; providing in-
 service training; publishing periodicals and other ma-
 terial for the scientific community and the general
 public; providing advice and expertise to various
 sectors in military and civilian industry; and serving
 as a mechanism to relay its constituents' comments
 and appeals to the party and relevant government
 departments.
 In early 1983 CAST played a major role in the
 formation of the China Science and Technology Con-
 sultive Service Center in Beijing. The center, com-
 posed of more than 500 separate consulting organiza-
 tions, serves as a vehicle for bringing together
 multidisciplinary teams of experts to advise on eco-
 nomic and technical matters. Where appropriate,
 advice reportedly will be rendered on a fee basis. The
 center is located within the SSTC and operates closely
 with the Commission's Institute of Science and Tech-
 nical Information, which has widespread access to
 Western technical data bases.
 firms, institutes, and technical personnel to deal di-
 rectly with Chinese Government organizations such
 as the SSTC, the center will, on behalf of the
 commission, maintain contact with these foreign enti-
 ties and people on a nongovernmental basis. The
 CSTEC, for example, sponsored the much publicized
 Beijing Science and Technology Policy Forum held in
 June 1983 and attended by more than 20 overseas
 Chinese scientists and technicians from the United
 States and Canada. Deng Xiaoping underlined Bei-
 jing's interest by meeting separately with these indi-
 viduals during the conference.

 The Search for Foreign Expertise
 China has significantly increased efforts to enlist
 foreign scientists in its scientific and technological
 development as teachers, advisers, and researchers. In
 October 1982 a China Science and Technology Ex-
 change Center (CSTEC) was established under the
 auspices of the State Science and Technology Com-
 mission (SSTC). A major function of the CSTEC is to
 organize and promote exchanges and cooperation
 between Chinese scientific and technological circles
 and corresponding nongovernmental scientific and
 technological communities and people in foreign
 countries. Because of the reluctance of some foreign

 Unified Procurement of Foreign Technology
 China reportedly is attempting to define its foreign
 industrial technology and equipment needs more sys-
 tematically through a process of unified planning that
 will encompass most basic military and civilian needs.
 Each industrial ministry is to formulate its technology
 and equipment requirements according to domestic
 and foreign availability. These requirements are fur-
 ther refined in terms of regional, central city, and key
 installation needs. When submitted to the State
 Council the requirements are examined to determine
 requirements.
 those technologies and equipment available domesti-
 cally, those that can be expected to become available
 domestically, and those that must be imported. The
 state planning commission reviews the requirements
 further, in the context of broad military and civilian
 industrial objectives. A decision is then made as to
 what foreign technology and equipment would best
 meet these comprehensive research and industrial
 factories they control.
 Key Targets in Development: Electronics and the
 Machine-Building Industries
 Development of China's machinery and electronics
 industries is crucial to technological progress in all
 sectors of the economy. Because of this, the State
 Council decided in 1981 that development of these
 industries should receive priority attention. To facili-
 tate this objective, the State Council indicated its
 intention in December 1982 to import 3,000 advanced
 technology packages during the last three years of the
 Sixth Five-Year Plan. More than 1,000 of these
 projects will be used to refurbish 490 factories and
 nearly 60 research institutes within the machine-
 building and electronic industries. The plan also
 provides that an additional 3,800 items would be
 manufactured or developed indigenously to upgrade
 many other facilities, most of which will be machinery
 and electronic plants. In addition, local governments
 and specialized trade corporations are making similar
 investment to modernize the machinery and electronic
 The priority on machinery and electronics was reflect-
 ed in Beijing's effort to attract foreign investors and
 suppliers to the China International Mechanical and
 Electronic Technology Conference held in Beijing in

 December 1983. The conference was used as a forum
 to work out technical and commercial details for 107
 machinery and electronic projects, most of which
 represent technologies of the late 1970s and early
 1980s, that China hopes to assimilate and eventually
 replicate for use in other machinery and electronic
 facilities throughout China
 China has set strict guidelines on which plants within
 the machinery and electronics industry will use for-
 eign technology and equipment. The State Council in
 early 1983 stressed, in its "Tentative Rules for the
 Technical Transformation of the Engineering and
 Electronics Industries," that factories selected to use
 advanced foreign technology and equipment must
 have a solid foundation and strong administration and
 management so that the imported technologies can be
 rapidly studied and assimilated. The guidelines fur-
 ther suggest that importing facilities must pay close
 attention to purchasing "know-how" as well as the
 equipment, so that the technology can be closely
 integrated with the factory's own research and devel-
 opment.
 China's objective for technological progress in the
 machinery and electronics industries is to develop and
 produce a variety of quality products that have both
 significant export potential and are urgently needed in
 China's modernization effort. To further these objec-
 tives the machinery and electronics industries have
 been assigned specific product improvement targets
 that must be attained in the course of China's present
 and future five-year plans.
 According to SEC Vice Minister Lu Dong, who also
 serves as a member of the State Computer and
 Integrated Circuit Leadership Group, the research
 and design contingent within China's machinery and
 electronics industries will be expanded until it consti-
 tutes one-third of the total technical personnel em-
 ployed in these sectors. Technological development
 also will require greater coordination between the
 research units and the production facilities and be-
 tween the machinery and electronic industries and the
 raw material suppliers. Increased attention also is
 being directed to improving the quality and training
 of scientists, technicians, and managers; establishing a
 strict system of individual responsibility; promoting
 the application of modern management techniques in
 both research and manufacturing; and raising quality
 control and product standards to international levels
 by yearend 1985.
 Electronics Development and Military Needs. Bei-
 jing's highest technological priority in modernizing its
 industries is to establish a modern electronics industry
 capable of satisfying both its military and economic
 needs. Particular attention has been focused on build-
 ing a modern semiconductor industry that can support
 Chinese plans for expanding computer development
 and manufacturing. Beijing is thus engaged in a
 massive effort to replace its obsolete electronic compo-
 nent production lines and processes with technology
 and equipment of a more current vintage. In addition
 to importing all types of electronic component and
 integrated circuit manufacturing equipment, China is
 stressing the acquisition of relevant "software"-
 design technology, training, management techniques,
 production, and quality control methods-in order to
 assimilate, replicate, and diffuse this advanced tech-
 nology and equipment to other parts of industry.
 This technology acquisition process is consistent with
 China's goals:
 ? To achieve within a decade an integrated circuit and
 computer manufacturing capability equal to that
 existing in the United States.
 ? To provide an infrastructure to support China's
 strategic, military, and commercial electronic needs.
 ? To minimize China's dependence on foreign supplies
 of electronics and equipment.
 ? To establish a competitive foothold in the interna-
 tional market for electronic materials and
 equipment.

 Beijing's progress toward these objectives is reflected
 in its development of a near state-of-the-art super-
 computer with an operational speed of 100 million
 operations a second,
 What the Military Receives ... More and more, we
 have seen the Beijing leadership addressing the impor-
 tance of, electronic advancement to China's military
 weapons development. A special leading group was
 established within the State Council to monitor Chi-
 nese civilian and military progress in development and
 manufacture of computers and large-scale integrated
 circuits (LSIs). Defense Minister Zhang Aiping has
 called for rapid development of the electronic indus-
 try, describing it as crucial to all Chinese military
 research and development goals. China's Minister of
 the Electronics Industry also has recently stated that
 military electronics occupies a top priority in the
 industry's development.
 The strategic importance Beijing attaches to its elec-
 tronics industry at this juncture is consistent with
 China's policy for using new and emerging technol-
 ogies for military use before they are transferred to
 economic and social applications. A leading official of
 the Chinese Academy of Sciences stated in October
 1983 that China's strategy for technology dissemina-
 tion is to transfer achievements from the laboratory to
 production, from production to the military, and from
 the military to both military and civilian application.
 China's Defense Minister also has frequently stated
 over the past year that new technologies will be used
 in military R&D before they are transferred to civil-
 ian economic use.
 China's interest in applying new technologies first to
 military experiment goes beyond microelectronics and
 computers. Technologies in such fields as nuclear,
 space, laser, bioengineering, and the material sciences
 are also targets. In the material sciences, for example,
 China has shown strong interest in acquiring an
 advanced composite materials production capability.
 Advanced composite materials are used in the fabri-   25X1
 cation of rocket motor cases and weapons reentry
 vehicles.
 ... And What It Delivers. As increased cooperation
 between military and civilian research and production
 progresses, the defense industrial sector is expected to
 play an increasingly more positive role in China's
 economic development. The value of civilian products
 turned out by military factories has grown considera-
 bly since 1978. According to Chinese claims, nonmili-
 tary production by the defense industries for 1982
 represented more than 20 percent of their total indus-
 trial output value, or roughly 2.3 billion yuan.
 In addition to production for the civilian sectors,
 military-industrial facilities continue to produce arms
 for export. Shipments of A-5 aircraft to Pakistan and
 Type-69 tanks to Iraq, for example, provide foreign
 exchange earnings. Nevertheless, industrial capacity
 within the defense industry continues to be underuti-
 lized.                       as much as one-third
 of China's total military industrial capacity remains
 idle.
 Military-industrial cooperation in civilian manufac-
 ture is, nevertheless, leading to problems of competi-
 tion between military and civilian producers. The
 North China Industries Corporation (NORINCO),
 the export-import arm of the Ministry of Ordnance
 Industry, is actively involved in a number of foreign
 transactions relating to the manufacture of nonmili-
 tary products (see table 2). In 1982 it was engaged in a
 dispute with the Ministry of Light Industry (MLI)
 concerning the conversion of 22 MOI facilities to the
 production of bicycles and mopeds. Because MLI
 wanted the domestic market to itself, it successfully
 sought State Council intercession in order to force
 NORINCO to limit its production scheme to the
 export market.

 for implementing the new policies are still evolving.
 Nevertheless, China appears to have dismantled its
 Soviet-style R&D and military-industrial production
 systems and is beginning to integrate them with
 civilian economic activity (see figure 3).

 a The Yanshan Science and Technology Corporaton and the Xin-
 shidai Corporation are NDSTIC elements that are responsible for
 coordinating the military weapons and technology procurement
 activities of the various trade organizations affiliated with the
 defense industry. Yanshan Corporation reportedly deals primarily
 with weapon systems and technologies that are more advanced,
 while Xinshidai Corporation concentrates on procurement of weap-
 on systems of a lower technology level or where little technology
 Beijing will benefit from this merger in several ways.
 In general, China should be able to take better
 advantage of the increasingly rapid worldwide diffu-
 sion of technology.' We believe these new policies will
 lead to a more systematic ordering of priorities as to
 which technologies will be developed and which will
 be imported. Although military needs will remain
 paramount, civilian industry will also profit from the
 increased opportunity to draw on technologies devel-
 oped or acquired for military purposes. Both military
 and civilian industry will gain as increased centraliza-
 tion of R&D programs eliminates some of the waste-
 ful duplication that has accompanied Chinese efforts
 to acquire technology and equipment abroad. In-
 creased production of civilian goods by military indus-
 try should also be a plus-for the military in terms of
 greater use of idle capacity and increased revenues
 and for the civilian economy in terms of larger
 quantities of badly needed producer and consumer
 goods.
 The concentration of resources on key industrial and
 S&T projects implied by these policy changes may
 already be bearing fruit. In electronics, for example,
 the new state-of-the-art "Galaxy" computer was de-
 veloped by using the combined talents of the military
 and civilian research establishments to incorporate
 both domestically produced and imported compo-
 nents. Although this computer is expected to help
 China's nuclear weapon program by allowing studies
 of more complex weapons models, it also may be
 applied in such areas as oil and geological exploration,
 long-term weather forecasting, and satellite imagery
 processing.

 The increasing Chinese emphasis on scientific and
 engineering education is a fundamental part of the
 new policies. The number of engineers now graduat-
 ing from China's universities is second highest in the
 world, a figure that is being boosted each year by
 thousands of foreign-trained scientists and techni-
 cians. Moreover, China is attempting to attract scien-
 tists and engineers living abroad to China for extend-
 ed stays. In large measure, China's ability to
 replicate, and eventually to improve upon advanced
 technology to produce achievements such as the Gal-
 axy computer will depend upon the abundance of the
 resources made available to these personnel and the
 working conditions provided for them. In this last
 respect, the leadership has repeatedly stressed that
 China's scientists and technicians are not the targets
 of the current campaign against "spiritual pollution."
 Nonetheless, ambivalent leadership policies toward
 intellectuals seem unlikely to encourage innovative
 thinking.
 In any event, we believe there are significant obstacles
 to the full integration of military and civilian research
 and production elements. In January 1984 Minister of
 Defense Zhang Aiping indicated that military re-
 search and production elements continue to be unen-
 thusiastic in supporting the merger effort. Personnel
 within these facilities believe that their primary func-
 tion should be military research and production and

 not non-military-related activity. There is also evi-
 dence of a developing rivalry between the State
 Economic Commission, which is tasked with the
 overall acquisition of foreign technology and equip-
 ment, and the various national-level foreign trading
 organizations-including those associated with the
 military establishment-over the extent of SEC con-
 trol over individual transactions. Similarly, although
 individual plants are being encouraged to compete
 with each other for specific foreign technologies, this
 has strengthened the longstanding tendency of enter-
 prises to refuse to share newly acquired technologies
 with other enterprises.
 For the United States, the merger of military and
 civilian institutes and factories into specialized re-
 search and production combines probably will further
 obscure Chinese strategic or special mission activity.
 because it has meant additional business for everyone.
 However, as China continues to concentrate on ac-
 quiring technology, rather than hardware, and, if it
 follows through on its stated preference for US tech-
 nology, the market for other COCOM members will
 contract. The other members of COCOM are already
 sensitive on this score and they may become less
 willing to approve further liberalization of export
 restrictions. The new Chinese policies also increase
 the likelihood of closer military linkages to joint
 ventures and similar technology transfer mechanisms.
 Thus, these types of transactions may become a more
 sensitive and more complex issue in COCOM deliber-
 ations than the export of particular pieces of equip-
 ment or machinery.
 The new Chinese policies will also create additional
 problems in the export control area. As the delinea-
 tion between military and civilian research and pro-
 duction becomes less clear, determining the status of
 end users will become far more difficult. Problems
 with other members of COCOM are also likely to
 multiply. Until recently, COCOM members have
 agreed to a relaxation of export controls for China
