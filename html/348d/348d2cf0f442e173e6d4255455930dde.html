 Modern intelligence:.
 Myth and Reality
 By. William E. Colby  .
 WASHINGTON-The Aztecs thought
 the Sun God had to he strengthened
 each day by the sacrifice of a young
 man or woman. Without the sacrifice
 the sun could not rise.
 . The myth of the Sun God's need
 drove the. nation through the daily,
 travail of the sacrifice.
 The reality of astronomy to explain
 the sunrise was unknown.
 Today we have myths about our
 Intelligence. They are expressed in.
 sensational catchwords: "dirty tricks,"
 "invisible  government,"  "terminate
 with extreme prejudice," "lie to any-
 one but the President," "infiltration of
 the White House," "destabilization,"
 "secret war," "massive illegal."
 They come from old, outmoded ideas
 about intelligence: espionage, intrigue,
 derring-do.
 These myths achieve lives of their
 own. Formal denials, evidence to the
 contrary,  and independent,  serious,
 follow-up assessments of the true pro-
 portions of a catch phrase never over-
 take the original allegation. The myth
 becomes accepted as reality.
 In normal times, these myths are'
 but part of the life of an intelligence
 -professional, like the anonymity and
 the lonely challenges, intellectual as
 well as physical, of a demanding craft.
 Today, however, these individual
 myths are . gaining momentum and
 mass. They tend to portray intelligence
 as  unconstitutional,  improper,  un-
 wanted by our citizens. They threaten
 American intelligence's ability to con-
 tribute to the political, economic and
 military safety and welfare of our
 nation. These myths threaten intelli-
 .gence's ability to help our country to
 negotiate with-not confront-oppo-
 nents in an unsettled world.
 If we believe 'these myths, we can
 make our own mistaken Aztec sacri-
 fice-American intelligence-in the be-
 lief that only thus can the democratic
 sun of our free society rise.
 - We must not sacrifice a virile, a
 necessary, contributor. to, the safety of
 our nation, the welfare of our citizens,
 and peacekeeping in the world of the
 future to a handful of myths. The
 reality of intelligence today is as dif-
 ferent from the myths about it as the
 reality of astronomy from the Aztec
 .myth of the sunrise.
 . Let's note some of the realities:
 Our careful centralization of foreign.
 information from open, public sources
 provides us with a compendium and.
 continuity of facts.
 America's technical genius has revo-
 lutionized intelligence. It has given us
 new views of distant objects, new
 abilities to analyze and absorb masses
 of data and detail, new e    fJ  i /For Release 200110810Et1w0F *-Rl    !0 4a3Pft0ftY?r3iM004-3
 complex world of today.    ? -~
 To these must still be added that
 information that we can only get from
 the resourceful, dedicated clandestine
 operator. He is the only one who can
 overcome the barriers of. the closed
 and hostile societies that share our
 planet. He can tell us of secret plans
 for tomorrow or the research ideas of
 today. He tells us of the human inter-
 action-something no technology can
 show--among groups and leaders of
 -closed societies.
 Experts of independence, talent. and
 intellectual integrity study this wealth
 of reporting. They write objective as-
 sessments of world affairs free from
 domestic political bias or Government
 departments' budget desires,
 Intelligence collection and analysis
 cover not only military threats but
 political problems and economic dan-
 gers as well. Intelligence forecasts of
 future trends abroad permit us to.
 -make national decisions, about future
 foreign threats in time to react.
 Intelligence permits us to negotiate
 international differences before they
 become disputes. And today the excel
 fence of our, information now con-.
 tributes to ,a new.role for intelligence:
 peacemaking and peacekeeping.
 With sure information about the
 plans, capabilities and dispositions of
 the political and military forces on
 both sides of foreign crises, we-can,
 clarify their misunderstandings of each
 other that might lead them to go to
 war; we can reassure both sides of
 getting from us early warning of
 hostile moves by the other side.  .
 Perhaps the strongest myths relate
 to the Central Intelligence Agency's:
 mission of covert political . and para-.
 .military action. Today's reality is that'
 little of this nature is done. What is
 done is fully controlled by the policy
 levels of our Government -and is ' re-
 ported to committees of the Congress.
 This, then, is the reality of modern
 intelligence. We understand why the.
 myths arose, as we understand why
 the Aztec myth was born, but serious
 and scientific investigations by the
 Congressional committees examining
 intelligence will clarify the need of
 our free society for intelligence and,

 also show the true proportions of the:

 atmosphere in which they occurred.
 With .this new perception of reality,
 should also come clear direction and
 effective supervision. This will insure'
 that the new reality remains, fully'
 compatible' with our free. society. For:
 this, too,, is ' a reality . of. American'
 intelligence, that it must conform to,
 the will of -the American public as
 well as our constitutional procedures.
 This need not. include some new
 ,myth that "the public has a right to
 know" everything. The citizen does
 have a right to expect that this new
 reality of intelligence will 'protect his
 country's essential secrets.
 We protect other American secrets:
 proceedings of grand juries, diplomacy,,
 .trade,.. income tax and - census data,
 although intelligence secrets are being
 exposed in unprecedented, and danger-
 ous, volume.
 Secrecy is not new in America.. In-

 seek, a better discipline to enforce ad-
 herence to the fundamental obligation'

 With public understanding. of the
 realities of American intelligence, we,
 can avoid a useless Aztec sacrifice.'
 Nor need we believe that ultimate'
 myth: that America does'not have the
 responsibility and restraint necessary'
 to have the best intelligence' service!
 in the world.        .

 advisers believe that the agency should
 be maintained in its present general
 form. and have the capability to mount
 covert operations. The Adrninistrntion
 is not likely to accept the advice of for-
 mer Defense Secretary Clark. Clifibrd
 and others who argue that the CIA should
 be split into two separate units: one
 for intelligence gathering and one for
 covert operations. White House officials
 believe that this could be inefficient,
 since the two functions often involve
 the same agents. In addition, there is
 the fear that putting operations under
 a separate and smaller agency might
 bring them too close to Pentagon
 influence. ?
 Public Budget. The goals of the
 White House are to restore public con-
 fidence in the functions of the intel-
 ligence agency and establish an effec-
 tive congressional watchdog organiza-
 tion. President Ford, say his top aides,
 now favors the creation of a special
 joint committee, drawing members from
 both the House and Senate, that would
 have the power-still not spelled out
 -to oversee the operations of the CIA.
 Such a step was recommended by both
 the Rockefeller ' Commission, which
 looked into the domestic transgressions
 of the CIA, and a blue-ribbon com-
 mission on foreign policy that was cre-
 ated by President Richard Nixon and
 headed by Robert D. Murphy, a for-
 mer Under Secretary of State.
 Also wider consideration by the
 White House is a Rockefeller suggestion
 that at least part of the CIA budget
 should be made public; it is now en-
 tirely hidden, in the nooks and cran-

 Hies of other agencies' appropriations.
 Furthermore, the President is mulling
 over a recommendation made by both
 the Rockefeller and Murphy commis-
 sions that, as a general rule, the di-
 rector of the Clx should be chosen from
 outside the agency-a point that is
 agreed upon in principle by none oth-
 er than Director Colby, 55, the ar-
 chetypal insiderat the agency.
 Colby's experience has been almost
 entirely in the covert field from the
 time he parachuted into France in 1943.
 to lead an underground operation until
 he served as head of the CIA's plans, a
 job he left to become director in June
 1973, just a year before the roof fell in.
 Since the beginning of 1975, Colby has
 had to spend most of his working hours
 coping with the criticisms of the or-
 ganization. He has testified 36 times
 this year before a variety of congressio-
 nal committees," maintaining his poise
 admirably and replying frankly to hos-
 tile questions. Indeed, Colby is being
 criticized privately at the highest levels
 of the Government for being needlessly
 apologetic. One senior official charac-
 terizes him as "the kind of guy who,
 when he is given a parking ticket, ad-
 mits to seven felonies."
 Sooner or later, quite possibly by the
 end of this year, Colby'seems certain to
 be asked to leave-a fate that he ac-
 cepts philosophically. Says one White
 House aide: "He inherited all the skel-
 etons in the closet and issued all the cor-
 rective memoranda, but that's not going
 to make him any less expendable. He
 should be allowed to see the investiga-
 tion through, then retire with honor."
 Tough Questions. The search for.
 Colby's successor as director is already
 quietly under way. One prime possibility
 is Elliot Richardson, now the U.S. Am-
 bassador to Great Britain, formcrly-
 Under Secretary of State, Secretary of
 Defense and Attorney General. Rich-
 ardson earned a national reputation for
 probity-when'he quit as Attorney Gen-
 eral during Richard Nixon's Saturday.
 Night Massacre rather than accede to
 demands to take the pressure off the Wa-
 tergate investigation. Other names being
 mentioned: former Treasury Secretary
 George Shultz, former Assistant Attor-
 ney General William Ruckeishaus and
 former Deputy Defense Secretary Cy-
 rus Vance. Whoever is chosen is like!
 to face tough questioning during his con-
 firmation hearings. "There will be one
 hell of a fight and an attempt to tie him
 down," predicts a senior policymaker.
 But finding the right man for the
 top job will be only part of the answer
 to the fundamental question of what
 kind of a clandestine operation the U.S.
 is prepared to conduct: How dirty should
 the dirty tricks be? The Hill and the
 White House will have to come to a.ba-
 sic accord on the matter, then work out
 a reasonable way for Congress to mon-
 itor the work of the agency. Until this
 happens, the CIA will continue to be a
 badly shaken organization working be-
 low its potential to serve.the nation.
 The agency is also defending itselfagainst 13 law-
 suits aimed at prying out information. In addi-
 tion, because of the new Freedom of lnformatian
 Act, it has had to answer nearly 4.500 requests
 from individuals and organizations demandins
 copies of any information about themselves in Cta
 files (in 90c of the cases, there is none).

 he experienced from memory and supple-
 mental research. Thus the book Is more
 history than diary, with large-chunks of
 material on the political, social and eco-
 nomic backgrounds for events be observed
 as an operations officer in Ecuador, Uru-
 guay and Mexico from 1960 through 1968.
 The book was first published in Britain
 to, avoid the kind' of C.I.A. censorship that
 shredded parts ',of Victor Marchetti and
 'John D. Marks's-"The CIA and the Cult of
 Intelligence." Its, most valuable purpose is
 that of exposure, with Mr. Agee playing
 the "whist'_e-blower" who brings heretofore
 secret information into the light of public
 revelation. Although previous "outside"
 .reporting on the C.I.A. has given us a
 pretty good idea-.of how the agency plies
 its sub rosa trade, we have never before
 had such a detailed account of its opera-
 tions written by an insider, albeit a rela-
 tively low-level one whose service was
 limited to Latin America.
 Open Window on a Secret World
 Circumscribed as Mr. Agee's vantage
 point is, it nonetheless throws 'open a
 window on much of the C.LA.'s secret
 world, and it is doubtful that the agency's
 methods elsewhere differ much from-the
 ones Mr. Agee describes. In his eagerness

 the reader at the outset while describing
 his preliminary training at the C.I.A.

 ficials. One was lured into bed by a
 comely agent, where his performance
 -said to be remarkable-was photo-
 graphed and recorded for possible fu-
 ture use.
 .In a scene reminiscent of the Wa-
 tergate bungle, Agee kept watch one
 night, walkie-talkie in hand, while two
 technicians and an engineer tried to bug
 the Czech legation in Ecuador. The
 agents were caught in the act by four
 guards. The fast-talking engineer saved
 the day by taking the guards aside to
 allay their curiosity while the techni-
 cians furiously ripped out installations.
 The encounter is one of the few
 memorable passages in a book stuffed
 with detail. Indeed, Agee includes so
 many facts and names that the book has
 two glossaries, one for. the cast of char- -
 acters, another for organizations-as if
 the reader were wading through War
 and Peace. Perhaps, in a sense, he is. The',
 events in Inside the Company are a mat-,
 ter of life and death; below their flat
 prose there moves a complex universe of
 national intrigue and human paradox. ;
 --The greatest paradox is Agee him-
 self; his conversion- is never fully ex-
 plained. The .superpatriot simply
 decides one day that he has been.
 on the wrong side all along: the
 good guys were the revolutionar-
 ies. "The CIA," he writes with
 pious hindsight, "is nothing more
 than the secret police of American
 capitalism, plugging up leaks in
 the political dam night and day
 so that shareholders of U.S. com-
 panies operating in poor coun-
 tries can continue enjoying their
 rip-off."
 With his new vision as a.
 Marxist socialist, Agee quit the
 CL4 in 1969 and wrote his book
 abroad while bugged and hound-
 ed, he claims, by Company agents.
 Agee profited from the experience
 of Victor Marchetti, another dis-
 illusioned CIA agent and co-author
 of The CIA and the Cult of Iri-
 telligence. When Marchetti set out
 to publish his exposd in the U.S.,.
 the CIA took him to court and scis-
 sored out 168 passages. To avoid
 this fate. Agee first published his      Agee,' the Americans are always one-

 It almost takes the stamina and
 interest of a Soviet spy to get through
 Philip Agee's attempt to relate every-
 thing he knew and did during his
 12 years as a  Central Intelligence
 Agency operations officer-his selec-
 tion, training and assignments in Ecua-
 dor, Uruguay and Mexico in the 1960's,
 and his. final disillusionment and resig-
 nation at the end of 1969. Too bad
 "Inside. the Company" is such a task
 to read, because there is important
 information buried in its 600. or so
 pages that the general American public
 should understand, particularly with
 today's debate over the past and future
 roles of the C.I.A.
 Agee, however, wants his book to
 be more than just an expose for
 his readers. He wants to. convince
 them that -"the C.I.A;, after all, is
 nothing, more than ? the secret police
 of American capitalism, plugging up
 leaks in the political dam, night and
 day, so that shareholders of United
 States companies operating in poor
 countries can continue enjoying the
 rip-off.". To, support this thesis, the
 book is weighed down with polemics
 which Agee thinks of as "the more-
 difficult political and economic reali-
 ties that give the [covert C.I.A.] opera=
 tions meaning."
 To ' my way of thinking they don't.
 Instead they offer a distorted picture
 of many ugly .and often unnecessary
 attempts by United States agents to
 manipulate politically unstable Latin
 American  countries.  According  to.
 no one on that side acts for noble
 or even patriotic reasons. The political
 and economc "realities"  in Agee's
 vouch- for details, think most of it rings world also never seem -to include
 true-a fact that should shock only the disruptive acts by Cuban 'or Soviet
 naive. In a world full of other intelli- agents, though bombings, strikes and
 gence agencies and dirty tricks, a good
 deal of the CIA's work may be defended
 as useful and even necessary.
 The most volatile aspect of this an-
 gry volume remains the author's indis-
 cretion: he has blown the cover of hun
 dreds of CIA men and Latin American
 agents. Agee took the step to discredit,
 and cripple the CIA, surely knowing he
 guerrilla warfare were being promoted
 by their Communist agents. I don't
 believe such actions justified the total
 C.I.A. interventionist response, but by
 leaving them out Agee defeats his-
 overall purposes.
 Agee also sees his book as a means
 to "neutralize the C.I.A.'s support to
 repression" in third world countries-
 an objective he hopes to accomplish
 and women. The ex-agent, who now:     by exposing names of Agency "officers

 abroad. If Agee limited his naming
 names to those in the police end
 of things it would be understandable.
 He does not. Page after page of C.I.A.'
 covert operations-intelligence gather-
 ing as well as political action-are
 listed  along  with  the  names  of
 Americans directing them and the hun-
 dreds of Ecuadorian, Uruguayan, Mexi-
 can and other nationals who have
 served as-paid or unpaid C.I.A. agents.
 There are so many indiviuals named
 along with their cryptonyms and pseu-.
 donyms that two full appendices. are
 devoted to explaining them. When
 Agee was in agent-training he found
 the use of acronyms "rather complicat-
 ed" and "confusing." His own use
 of names and cryptonyms is no less
 confusing to readers who don't plan
 to become agents.              _
 This torrent of names, however, .
 raises a question about some of Agee's
 sources and the purpose of his book.
 In a recent Playboy interview, Agee
 said that '1 had no notes from my'
 C.I.A. days; I had to find contemporary
 sources to refresh my memory, so
 I could reconstruct events." In a 15-
 page section early in the .book, Agee
 lists some 24 covert C.I.A. operations
 which he said were under way in Ecua-
 dor in December,, 1960, when he was
 first assigned there. He not only lists
 the operations but also the real names
 and cryptonyms of. 34 Ecuadorians -
 whom he identifies as C.I.A. agents
 working on these operations.
 It is hard to believe. a man without
 notes could sit down- 12 years later :
 and fecall from, memory that many
 agents' names or reconstruct intel-
 ligence operations without any assist-
 ance from individuals who themselves
 had been collecting that very same
 information. Thus it seems likely that
 during Agee's 1971 trip to Havana
 for research, the "considerable mate-
 rial" he found there was of this intel-
 ligence variety: Both Agee and Cuban
 intelligence have, in a sense, an identi-
 cal goal-to disrupt C.I.A.. activities
 in Latin Amerca. Agee's book certain-
 ly ly has done that, though any major
 public response apparently will come
 only with a Spanish edition of the.
 book.,
 Once the American reader gets
 over the twin hurdles of Marxian
 polemics and exposure for destruc-
 tion's sake, the book has real rewards.
 It describes how the C.I.A. functioned-
 in Ecuador and Uruguay between 1961
 and  1966 far beyond any point of

 'had directed the C.I.A. to fight back,
 using covert methods. In short, the
 United States was exporting Counter-
 revolution.
 As Agee puts it, when he arrived
 in Quite in December, 1960, the Ecua-
 dor C.I.A. station's basic. campaign
 'was "to promote a break in diplomatic
 relations between Ecuador and Cuba."
 To support that effort, according to
 Agee, the C.I.A. financed anti-Castro
 political candidates and even gave,
 money to those running for office
 in labor union and university student-
 government organizations if they were
 .anti-Castro. Through Equadorian po-'
 lice the Agency arranged for the bug-
 ging of pro-Castro leaders and even
 directed C.I.A.-paid surveillance teams-
 to follow specific individuals both in-
 side and outside leftist organizations.
 False documents were placed in news-
 papers through a respected newsman
 who Agee says was a paid C.I.A. agent.
 The agency also apparently con-
 trolled a hemisphere-wide news ser-
 vice and used it to circulate misinfor-
 mation to aid in the anti-Cuban pro-
 gram. At one point, Agee describes
 how one . pro-Castro individual was
 framed when a phony report was

 planted on him so that. it would,:
 be "discovered" when he returned
 to Quito from Cuba. Since there were
 no Soviets in Ecuador--.there were
 no diplomatic relations -between the
 two countries then-agency attention
 focused almost entirely on the Cubans
 and the inherent instability of the
 country's own politicians. Inevitably,
 American money and attention became
 a major factor in Ecuadorian politics.
 In Uruguay, Agee describes only
 a . slightly different atmosphere. There

 .1. feel, rather better qualified
 than most people to comment on
 these two events.  I am an old
 rocket buff,  a. member of the,
 British Interplanetary Society for'
 many years before the first arti-.
 ficial satellites. I lately had a long
 and most amicable morning with
 Solzhenitsyn. And I am just back
 from a tour of the United States
 where I met political and trade
 u; ion leaders, academics and res
 po nsib a journalists (while avoid-
 ing the irres},on';ihle, such as some
 sections of the British Press in
 ,Washington).
 The'roeket display, as is widely
 recognised, is of fairly marginal
 technical  significance:  its  main.,
 point is as a demonstration, a
 propaganda exercise, in favour of
 "detente." Solzhenitsyn, on the
 other hand, in the tradition of
 Russia's Holy Fools, has been blurt-
 ing out truths, has been the child
 pointing out that the glittering
 raiment  of  detente  is  largely
 imaginary.
 This has produced, in America,
 itself and in our own Press too, an
 enormous volume of abuse, mis-
 representation  and  denigration
 from owners of ideological shares
 in  this  phantom company.
 But let us note that even Soyuz
 contains  striking confirmation
 of all that Solzhenitsyn stands for.
 The genius of the Soviet space
 apparently, runs the logic of Solzhenitsyn
 Many congressmen still' seem ready to do
 anything in the name of anticommunism, and
 so they cheered Solzhenitsyn when he ad-
 dressed them a few days ago. When President
 Ford declined to receive him at the White.
 House, there was -so much criticism the Ptes.'
 .ident backed down and issued an invitatiorl.
 One can only wonder about Kremlin's react;
 tion to all this. How would we react if the to-.
 bles were turned? Fortunately, the United'
 States does not have a prominent exile whc
 .might publicly call for our downfall. But if
 .there were, imagine what might happen if the
 Soviet government, while saying it was for
 detente, invited him to give an address in the
 Supreme Soviet.
 Solzhenitsyn does merit our respect as a'-
 great writer and a courageous man. As such;
 he deserved a hearing. Now that he has had
 it, I hope the American public will tune him
 out and consign him to his proper place as a
 literary giant and a political oddity.
 We can then get on with the business of
 working out ways to live peacefully in a dan-,
 gerous world--and in the bargain perhaps
 contribute to a climate which could breed
 more freedom in the U.S.S.R. and elsewheret
 programme was Sergei Koroiev.
 This was admitted only after he
 had  died.  Before  that,  the
 w h o l e thing was attributed to
 harmless  academicians of  the
 second and third rank who were
 allowed to meet foreigners, go
 abroad and behave in a manner
 appropriate to the New Soviet Man.
 Korolev could not be trusted to
 do this. He had started his contri-
 bution in a scientific prison, in`
 exactly the circumstances which
 Solzhenitsyn himself experienced
 and which formed the theme of
 'the "First Circle."
 When released, and given com-
 fortable quarters and fine labora-
 tories, he remained totally cynical
 about the Soviet order. He used to
 say that even then (as with Sol-
 zhenitsyn's heroes), he remained`
 ready to move with the minimum,
 prison  bundle,  at  the  usual
 3-noment's notice..
 .  And now, to put it crudely,
 -Korolev's product is generating
 fantasy in space, while his col-
 league is telling the truth on earth.
 He is pointing out, in fact, and in
 the bluntest and most tactless way,
 that, though there may be a peace
 in  the  sense  of  armed  truce
 betwden the present-day Soviet
 Union and the countries of the
 West, the idea that the Kremlin's
 motivations have basically changed,
 or are likely to change, as the.
 result of trade, conferences, hand-
 shakes and mutual expressions of
 goodwill, is a false one.
 To  do  the  Russian  leaders
 justice they at least have always
 proclaimed that detente is " a
 method of struggle."
 For them " detente" is different.
 from " cold war " merely in the
 tactical sense which Aesop devel-
 `oped  2,000  years  ago  in  that
 famous fable where the Wind and
 the Sun try in turn to remove a
 traveller's cloak, the first by cold
 blasts, which only make the man
 clutch A he garment more tightly
 about him, the second by increas-
 ing warmth.  The sun, of course,,
 wins.
 -
 There are two types in America
 and Europe who do not wish these'
 facts to be made known. . First
 there are those'who, for whatever
 reason, are motivated by an anti-
 Western  automatism.   Secondly,
 there are " men of goodwill " who
 are so concerned with, or person-.
 ally  committed  to,  the rosiest
 opinions about pseudo-detente that
 they cannot believe the truth to
 be otherwise.
 Both types have found Solzhen-.
 itsyn a nuisance. On the advice of
 the detente faction in the Ameri-
 can Administration, President Ford
 was originally unable to fit in a
 talk with him-being busy with
 such matters of state as a meeting
 with a basketball team.
 At a lower level  (lower in,
 every sense) there has been vicious
 sniping at Solzhenitsyn. To under-
 mine his vast moral authority is
 not, indeed, an easy task. Nor can
 it be argued very convincingly by
 those in the trendy bars of the
 Washington Press corps that he
 does not understand Russia.
 Still, there are ways: he is a
 difficult customer from a cruder
 society, he does not understand
 how such bonds  as trade and
 official visits will gradually erode
 Soviet hostility (even while free-
 dom of movement of 'people and
 ideas remains under total ban and
 while Soviet-ruled populations are
 subject to a vast campaign of anti-
 Western "vigilance," even when it
 is recalled that the highest points
 of German-Russian trade were in
 1914 and 1940 respectively).
 But above all he can be got at
 i -as in a widely condemned and
 particularly nasty little piece in
 the  Guardian  the  other day-
 through those in the West who
 agree with him.   These are all
 " red-necks " or idiot trade ' union
 leaders, proponents-of course-of
 " cold wai."   One would gather
 that none but Neanderthal patriots
 from the Ozarks hold the view of
 the Soviet leadership which Sol-
 zhenitsyn. puts forward, or have
 qualms about " detente."
 In fact, of course, it is common
 to almost all serious students of
 the Soviet Union and of foreign
 affairs in the ::United State's  and
 'here too: by everyone who writes
 and thinks of these affairs, in fact,
 except  for       appeasement-minded
 journalists and some circles in the
 American Administration.
 The phrase " cold war" is of
 course the litmus paper for the
 Guardian attitude. Cold war, bad;
 detente, good-these appear to be
 the furthest limits  of political
 thought such minds can attain. But
 during the recent prevalence of
 detente we have    seen  Russian
 cannon  blasting  the  way  into
 Saigon, Russian tanks pouring to
 the edge of the Golan Heights;
 the Russian-sponsored C u n h a I
 h i d d i n g for dictatorship in
 Lisbon . , .
 For the more serious propon-
 ents of the American Administra-
 tion's current policy, the disadvant-
 age has                                                                                             always  been  that  an
 atmosphere of the utmost cordiality
 towards a power that you admit-
 tedly do not trust enough to give
 it supremacy in armaments contri-
 butes to the psychological disarma-
 ment of the West.
 I would suspect that even while
 Soyuz  and  Apollo  bombinate
 amicably in the vacuum overhead
 Dr. Kissinger himself, if not his
 lesser followers,  welcomes. the
 strengthening of the West's resolve
 which arises from such bluntness
 as Solzhenitsyn's.      -
 Meanwhile., one could hardly
 express the issue more clearly than
 one of the major bugbears of the
 "liberals," George Meaney, did a

 Wfflkn mn F. Buckley Jr.
 A-   A_
 The
 _
 The gradual re7iection of
 Solzhenitsyn by the Ameri-
 can intellectual establish-
 ment was predictable. For
 one thing he is entirely
 independent,     moving
 through the cosmopolitan
 scene without tripping over
 any of the lilliputian nets
 that ensnare most of us.
 Now Newsweek magazine
 has come up with the killer
 designation: "The exile
 found himself ignored by`
 some influential liberals
 and embraced - apparent-
 ly to his discomfort - by
 the conservative right." If
 only they can thus taxono-
 mize him - a member of
 the conservative right -
 they can pin him ? up in a
 showcase along with the
 rare and grotesque butter-
 flies, let him go on there
 with his writhings and -
 forget about him.
 The extensive story in
 Newsweek does not tell us
 just how Solzhenitsyn is'
 embarrassed by the support
 given to him by the conserv-
 ative right. When he insist-
 ed that Senator James.
 Buckley of New York be
 invited to hear his speech in
 Manhattan, he was hardly
 shrinking from an associa-
 tion with the right. On the
 other hand, his principal
 sponsors were the trade
 unions, the organized voices
 of the working man - and
 they gave him a tumultuous
 reception. Unremarked in
 Newsweek.
 "His writings. glorify the
 wisdom of the simple peas-
 ant and the righteousness of
 the most rural communi-
 -ties," wrote the editors. So
 did Thomas Jefferson's, the
 founder of the Democratic
 party.
 He speaks of the "deca-
 dence of Western society.".
 So does the New York Re-
 view  of  Books,  Noam
 Chomsky, and Herbert Mar-
 "He hates cars  and
 cities."  So does Ralph
 Nader.
 "He was shocked to find,
 that interest in Soviet af-
 fairs seemed to be limited
 to the far right." Well,'if
 that is so, I too am shocked.
 Interest in Soviet affairs
 was very great among the
 far left during a period
 when much of it was servile
 to the Soviet state. New-
 sweek seems to be suggest-
 ing, though I doubt it was.
 intentional, that American
 liberals have lost interest in
 the Soviet Union now that
 they acknowledge it as a
 slave state bent on main-
 taining the captive nations
 in captivity, and manufac-
 turing more and better
 hydrogen bombs with which.
 to threaten us.
 If Solzhenitsyn is a far
 rightist who appeals to the
 far right, he goes at it in a
 most unorthodox way. Hav-
 i                                     g declared that the Rus
 sian people are the natural
 allies of the American
 workers, he commented in
 .one of his recent speeches
 about "another alliance
 at first glance a strange'
 one, a surprising one - but
 if you think about it, in fact
 one which is well-grounded
 and easy to understand:
 this is the.alliance between
 our Communist leaders and
 your capitalists."
 "This alliance is not
 new," Solzhenitsyn remind-
 ed his audience. "The very
 famous Armand Hammer,
 who is flourishing here
 today, laid the basis for this
 when he made the first ex-
 ploratory trip into Russia,'
 still in Lenin's time,' in the
 -very first years of the Revo-
 lution. He was extremely
 successful in this intelli-
 gence mission and since
 that time for all these 50
 " - .  with regard to Moscow's
 present line, we are told that we
 must' accept the politics of reality.'
 That means the Berlin Wall, mine-
 fields along the frontier, ransom
 for Soviet Jews, and acceptance of,
 say, the persecution of Lithuanian
 Catholcs as an 'internal Soviet
 affair."'
 " Well, we don't see it that way.
 We  don't  want  to  start  any :
 wars, but. we insist on something.
 that seems to disturb a lot of
 so-called intellectuals-we insist on
 emphasising the difference between
 democracy and dictatorship."
 And so says Solzhenitsyn. And
 stigmatize 001zhenitsyn
 ous and steady support by
 the businessmen of the West
 of the Soviet Communist
 leaders." Doesn't sound to
 me like a typical far right
 talk.  .       . .
 Solzhenitsyn went on 'to,
 discuss a recent exhibit of
 United States anticriminal
 technology which the Rus-
 sians bought up with fasci-
 nation. The difference being
 that we were selling our
 scientific paraphernalia not
 to the law-abiding for use
 against criminals, but to
 criminals for use against
 the law-abiding: rather like
 inventing a guillotine for
 the. purpose of chopping
 meat, and then selling it to
 Rosespierre for other uses
 "This is something which
 is almost incomprehensible
 to the human mind: that
 burning greed for profit
 which goes beyond all rea-
 son, all self control, all con-
 science,  only  to  get
 money." Far right talk, .to
 NEW YORK
 4 August
 the editors of Newsweek. As-
 a veteran of a number of
 .right-wing rallies, I take
 leave to pronounce this as
 an unorthodox way to ce-
 ment relations with the.
 capitalist class.
 What Solzhenitsyn is of
 course proving is that the
 deep resources of humanity
 lie for the most part in the
 conservative community.
 This is despicable. Because
 conservatives,  by  and
 large, do not believe in the-
 shifting standards of right
 and wrong which, for in-
 stance, can bring a Barbara
 Tuchman, a James Reston,
 or a John Kenneth Gal
 braith to travel to mainland
 China and report back their
 boundless enthusiasm for
 the work of Mao Tse-tung.
 If his tormentors truly suc-
 ceed in identifying Solz-
 henitsyn as a member of the
 far right, they will succeed
 in identifying themselves as
 the  heartless,  mindless
 robots they, in f?et, so often
 are.

 By Anthony Lewis
 In his speech to the Helsinki Con-
 ference, President Ford emphasized its
 pledges of freer movement for people
 and ideas. "It is important," he told
 the leaders of thirty-four other coun-
 tries there, "that you recognize the
 deep devotion of the American people
 and their Government to human rights,
 and fundamental freedom."
 How embarrassingly hollow those'
 words must have sounded. For Mr.:
 Ford had just had a chance to demon-'
 strate his devotion to human rights in
 the simplest way-by meeting a man
 who symbolizes the struggle for them
 -and he failed the test.
 The decision not to invite Aleksandr' Solzhenitsyn to the White House has'
 been deplored by now from all points
 of the ideological compass. For sheer
 political inepitude it was in a special
 class. But beyond that, the episode
 teaches us some things about the na-
 ture of political life.

 tatdrs in the United States seized on
 Soizhenitsyn's presence here as a
 way to dramatize their argument that
 detente is a mistake because the
 Soviet Union can never be trusted. The,
 only way to deal with Communism,
 they say, is to oppose it everywhere
 by military strength-and increase the
 already enormous burden of the arms
 budget.
 President Ford and Secretary of.
 State Kissinger allowed that view,to.
 occupy the field by their foolishness.
 But the special importance of Sal-
 zhenitsyn -does not lie in any par-
 ticular political stance, or in his own
 Christian-Slav mysticism. It lies in
 his person, his witness, his words.
 'Solzhenitsyn has shown the world
 that one human being, through his
 courage and his. art, can inflict moral
 defeat on the most powerful of tyran-
 nies. He has reminded us of the poten-
 tialities of the human spirit. And of
 course that achievement transcends
 any narrow politics.         ,
 The United States cannot ordinarily
 help the victims of tyranny by means
 of bombs or missiles. We do not live
 in that kind of world. Our recourse
 has to be to other ways of pressure:.

 things we can do is simply to make

 clear that we have a commitment to
 human rights-a commitment going`
 beyond immediate political considera-
 tions.
 For those who live under oppression,
 it can make all the difference to know
 that somewhere outside others care
 about them and share their views of
 humanity. That is why those who
 suffer discrimination in South Africa
 .give such an emotional welcome to
 visitors from abroad. And it is exactly
 the same for dissenters in the Soviet
 Union.' It would have been a restoring
 symbol of hope, for them, if an
 American President had shaken the
 hand of Solzhenitsyn.
 A second lesson of the episode, a
 sad one, is that we suffer these days
 from political leaders without ideals,
 without dreams. Their interest is
 limited to the immediate, their vision
 to- power.
 Consider the reason finally given for
 the decision of state to keep away
 from 5olzhenitsyn,. After v.irio::s pa-
 thetic excuses from the WLte- House,
 Mr. Kissinger gave this explanation:
 Solzhenitsyn's "views," if they be-
 came our "national policy," would
 threaten "military conflict."
 ilow   happen to think that that
 stated reason had nothing to do with
 the case. I think Henry Kissinger just
 cares much less about human rights
 and decency than he does about power'
 and short-term political objectives. He
 Watching Alexander Solzhenitsyn on TV, on the Meet -the
 Press program, one saw a transplanted hero, with a Dostoevs-
 ' kian growth of beard and fierceness of eye, coming on with the
 intensity of a major prophet. Because the setting was the fa-
 miliar American one of electronic journalism the torrential
 flow of his talk had to be, sliced up into question-and-answer
 segments. When the'Apocalypse comes it will be measured out
 in two-minute driblets, with time out for a commercial.
 Solzhenitsyn's American tour is not just a 'case of another
 visit by another famous foreigner. It is a historic test of what '
 happens to a hero when he gets ripped up from his native soil
 .and transplanted to a foreign one. Does the magic of heroism
 get muted, the halo tarnished? Does the sense of the extraor-
 dinary dissolve when dipped into the everyday?
 The Soviet leaders, when they packed Solzhenitsyn off on a'
 'plane to Switzerland, may have gambled on this happening.
 They hoped that with the transplanting to Western. Europe and
 America the bloom would wear off the rose.
 Will it? The danger of its happening is clear enough. As long .
 as. Solzhenitsyn spoke and wrote from within the belly of the
 monster itself, putting his life on the line, courting peril, dar-
 ing the Soviet masters to stop him, the rest of the world --
 . including his critics on the left - watched in awe. They didn't
 dare speak out against him. But now that he is out of extreme
 danger, appearing securely before American audiences, vis-
 iting with 'a delegation of American senators, his .critics no
 :longer are inhibited.
 The whispers get louder. Isn't he a cold warrior, as witness
 his quoting Melvin Laird on SALT I? Isn't he old hat, hobnobb-
 ing with George Meany and the other old men of American
 conservative labor? Is-Ti't he a fanatical anti-Communist, who
 sustains the right-wing governments
 of such countries as Chile and South
 .Korea, despite their brutal character,
 because he thinks them helpful to his
 policy. And he does not want to let
 anything get in the way of his doing
 business with Leonid Brezhnev.
 But in a way it would be worse if
 Mr. Kissinger really meant what he'
 said. For the suggestion is that an
 American President dare not meet a
 person with bad ideas, however great
 a ;human being, lest the President be
 infected with his views and make
 them "national policy." Try to imag-
 ine Jefferson or Lincoln or Roosevelt
 -afraid of ideas.
 We ask our politicians to do the'
 work of the day, and we should not
 expect them to show the same concern
 as artists for eternal truths. But we
 may begin to. wonder, in this age,
 whether something has happened to
 make political leaders everywhere--
 not only in the United States-such
 narrow, humorless, insensitive crea-
 tures.
 It is our own fault, as citizens, if
 we begin to see life in the politicians'
 limited terms. There is more in- the
 stars than that. Generations thrill to'
 Mozart that do not know the poli-
 . ticians of his age. Men will remember
 and read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn when
 Gerald Ford is a footnote to history:
 '   name of a President who pardoned
 ' is criminal predecessor.
 will get the United States into trouble with the. Soviet Union?.
 Isn't it dangerous to talk of the Russian people being buried by
 their rulers? Isn't he just a Catholic writer carrying the same
 old anti-Communist message that other exiles have carried the Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians and the .rest?
 Isn't he a stick-in-the-niud conservative, and a mystical one,
 too, with all his , talk about religion and love of the Russian
 earth and the soul of the people? Isn't he enveloping the.
 -American people of the Heartland with the same mystique?.
 The answer ,is, of course, that one can disagree with particu-'
 lar views of Solzhenitsyn and still see his continuing heroic
 quality. He could have made an easy adjustment to his exile.'
 He could now be mouthing all the fancy rhetoric that would go
 down beautifully with the -intellectual elites of. New York,
 Washington, Paris, London, and they would be carrying him
 on their shoulders,- before they dumped him in time: But that
 isn't his style. He is in dead earnest, he is consumed with an
 inner. fire, and he won't let anyone near him get out of reach
 of the flames.
 On the question of President' Ford's failure to see him, Sol-
 zhenitsyn's answer - that he didn't come as a guest of the
 American Government and didn't expect to be received by Mr.
 Ford - is good enough in its own way. Yet something must be
 added. As long as the rulers of one great power would deem it
 an unfriendly act for the head of another great power to talk
 with a major intellectual' figure from either country, there is
 no common climate between the two, and as yet no world in-
 tellectual community.
 Solzhenitsyn is especially good on the question of commu-
 nication between peoples.. The experience of one people, he
 says, is communicated back to another by its great writers. He
 adds that the burden of experience borne by the Russian
 people has been tragic. This is true of the American people,
 too, if our. writers and thinkers could only express it.
 Asked whether he regards the West as in decline, Sol.
 zhcnitsyn answers no; that it is only the will' of its ruling
 groups which is weak. He might have added that the pe_-
 ceptions of its intellectual communities are also confused. I
 Solzhenitsyn can act as a seer, and invoke the experience of
 the Russian people to make the people of the West see more.
 clearly, he will play a great historic role outside Russia, as be
 did within Russia.                   '
