 The cumulative impact of trends that are now gathering force will
 confront the United States with hard choices in tl,e next fifteen years
 involving major adjustments to a diffusion of world power, a decline of
 America's relative economic and political influence, and growing inter-
 national economic interdependence.  Tne world distribution of power will
 gradually evolve from the postwar bipolar system into a multipolar con-
 figuration  by  tine  end of  tine century.   The United States,  the Soviet Union,
 Western Europe, China, and Japan will be the principal powers in t?e new
 pentagonal constellation.  Tne ability of the two superpowers to control
 developments outside ti~eir alliance systems and, to a lesser extent,
 within them will diminish.  European members of both NATO and the Warsaw
 Pact will seek to distance themselves from the Soviet-American rivalry.
 Simplistic notions of containment and zero-sum competition will give way
 to greater reliance on a diplomacy of flexible maneuver among shifting
 coalitions.
 The Soviet Union will not experience anything approaching a genuine
 systemic crisis before the year 2000.   The system commands sufficient
 reserves of social and political stability to enable the regime to ride
 out the economic stagnation and civic malaise of the late 1970s and early
 1980s.  If General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev succeeds in reinvigorating
 the party's authority, the economy, even without significant reforms,-will
 resume steady growth rates of four to five percent a year by the early
 1990s.  Tne USSR will then be a more assertive competitor in the inter-
 national arena than it was during Brezhnev's last seven years and tt~e
 Andropov-C~ ernenko interregnum.  The most important stimulus for change
 in Soviet policies and prospects in the next decade will be a sweeping
 turnover of leaders and elites.  'The departure of the old guard will end a

 prolonged period duzing which policy differences were submerged, and the
 new leadership will find it more difficult to maintain a facade of unity.
 Soviet foreign policy in the next five years will remain focused on
 achieving recognition of the  USSR's global political, as well as strategic,
 equality with the United States and on altering the geopolitical equilibrium
 in Europe to Moscow's advantage.  Tt~e Soviets will persist in their dual
 strategy of waging controlled cold war against the U.S. while promoting
 selective detente with Western Europe.  They will continue to attach high
 priority to advancing an accommodation with China because this policy offers
 the quickest and least costly way to strengthen their leverage in dealing
 with the U.S., Western Europe, and Japan.  Moscow's external behavior and
 freedom of action, however, will be constrained not only by the requirements
 of protecting the Soviet position in the strategic triangle but also by a
 growing need to import foreign technology, industrial plant and equipment,
 and grain.
 Soviet policy toward the United States will be more active tactically
 but it will show little substantive change.  The Soviets will see little or
 no prospect of concluding arms control agreements in the next five years,
 and they believe the potential threat that the Reagan Administration's
 strategic modernization program might tilt the balance against the USSR
 has been averted-for the foreseeable future.  Soviet policy will keep the
 issue of "space Weapons" at the forefront of international attention and
 hold agreements on offensive nuclear weapons hostage to a prior accord
 banning the "militarization of outer space."  The Gorbachev leadership,
 however, will keep the door open to expanded economic relations with the
 United States in the 1990s and to collaboration in containing anticipated
 challenges from an expansionist China and a resurgent Germany.
 Wasters Europe will move toward more independent policies aimed at
 avoiding the repercussions of Soviet-American rivalry and at arranging
 accommodations with Moscow that would allow increased access to markets
 and resources in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  The new generation
 of West German leaders in the 1990s will alter the Federal Republic's
 traditional western orientation in order to promote policies to relax
 barriers created by the division of Europe and Germany, with the ultimate

 goal of clearing the wey for Cermen reunification.
 Trends in the Arab world will be determined by the outcome of
 competition between the influence of economic development and moderniza-
 tion, on the one hand, and the rising force of "Populist Islam" or
 Islamic fundamentalism, on the other.  If the recent decline in oil revenues
 accelerates, popular unrest in the oil producing countries will escalate
 and the fundamentalists will become a more dangerous threat to incumbent
 regimes.  The Palestinian question will gradually be overshadowed in Arab
 politics by a new phase in the traditional struggle between a coalition
 led by Egypt and a new version of the "Steadfastness Front" headed by Syria.
 The balance of forces will be altered to Egypt's advantage after Syria's
 power and influence are weakened by domestic strife that will follow the
 death of President Hafer Assad. -The Isiaelis will capitalize on Syria's
 decline by unilaterally implementing their formula for "full autonomy"
 for Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza and by encouraging them
 to emigrate to Jordan.  The influx of West Bank Arabs will produce an
 internal upheaval in Jordan that will lead to the downfall. of the
 Hashemite dynasty and the replacement of King Hussein by a Palestinian-
 dominated regime.
 East Asian politics will be increasingly dominated by an ascending
 China committed to becoming the preeminent power in Asia early in the next
 century.  Within two to four years, Beijing will reopen the issue of U.S.
 arms sales to Taiwan as an instrument to compel movement on the broader
 question of the island's reunification with the mainland.  By the mid-1990s,
 the Chinese will move to enforce their claims to the continental shelf in
 the Yellow and East China Seas and to islands in the East and South China
 Seas.  In the late 1990s, China will seek to establish a sphere of preponder-
 ant influence in Southeast Asia, draw Japan and the Koreas into relation-
 ships of economic and strategic dependence on China, .and reduce American
 influence and presence in East Asia.  In the last phase of its expansionist
 scenario,-China will confront the Soviet Union with demands for a settlement
 of territorial disputes on Chinese terms, restoration of China's primacy
 in Mongolia, and major reductions of Soviet military forces along the border.
 Japan will shift to a more independent and nationalistic posture, relying

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 increasingly on improved relations with the USSR to counterbalance
 China's ambitions.  If trade wars and Chinese expansionism undermine
 Japan's confidence and economic security, Tokyo will undertake a major
 rearmament program, including tt~e development of an independent nuclear
 capability.
 Central American political dynamics will be driven by a confused and
 violent transition from the political-economic order that evolved fn the
 first half of the century to a new distribution of power.  With the
 exception of a relatively stable Costa Rica, domestic conflicts will ebb
 and flow until monolithic orders ruled by dominant figures or authoritarian
 elites emerge.  The Nicaraguan regime-will settle into a precarious
 existence sustained by Soviet and Cuban assistance, and the Sandinistas'
 collective leadership will fragment, giving rise to a single dominant
 ruler.  The conflict in E1 Salvador will subside within five years without
 a formal settlement, and Panama will become the new focus of U.S. concerns
 in the late 1980s after an internal crisis prompts its leaders to demand
 major changes in the Canal Treaties of 1977.- Mexico will enter a period
 of upheaval in the late 1990s that will destroy the existing power structure.
 Tiie rise of political consciousness among the black majority in South
 Africa will lead to civil war in the next five years.  This will eventually
 bring down the present government, opening the way for a series of truces
 and de facto partition of the country, with the white minority relocated
 into scattered and shrinking enclaves.
 The United States in the year 2000 will command a superior geopolitical
 position and immense advantages over its principal competitors in a multi-
 polar world.  This new configuration of power will require major changes in
 the assumptions and priorities of American foreign and security policies.
 In the mid-1990s and beyond, the most volatile potential for a U.S.-Soviet
 military confrontation will reside in a resurgent Germany's quest for'
 reunification and preponderant power in Central Europe.  Tne East Asian
 periphery of an expansionist China will be the second major focal point
 of possible conflict.

 'The International Environment
 The world power configuration in the next decade will continue to be
 defined by the present modified bipolar structure, Dut forces now at work
 will gradually evolve into a rudimentary multipolar system by the year 2000.
 By the end of the first quarter of tt~e next century, a genuine pentagonal
 configuration, composed of ti,e United States, the Soviet Union, Western
 Europe,China, and Japan, will be in operation.  Tt,e unique strengths and
 resources of the U.S. and tiie USSR, however, will continue even then to
 confer on them tiie distinction of being the only true global powezs.  The
 other three members of the system will be essentially regional powers.
 The term "modified bipolar structure" refers to the reality that the
 United States-will remain tine only authentic superpower until well into
 the next century, primarily because its long-standing relationships with
 Western Europe and Japan and its economic pzeeminence will give the U.S.
 immense advantages which the Soviet Union will be unable to match.  T:ze
 USSR in the next fifteen years will not achieve the economic capacity or
 global influence necessary to enforce its claim to full political, as well
 as strategic, equality with the United ,States.  Nor will it be able to
 command a major role in the political management of affairs in any region
 outside Eastern Europe.  The ascription of superpower status to the USSR
 has never been warranted by its strengths, achievements, and influence in
 the nonmilitary ingredients of national power.   The Soviets achieved putative
 superpower status only because of the West's excessive preoccupation with
 the military dimensions of .East-West competition.  Apart from her strategic
 capabilities, the USSR will not acquire any of the essential attributes of
 true global power in the next decade and a half.  Soviet influence abroad
 will continue to be restricted by its inability to play a leading role in
 an American-dominated international system in which the constant interplay
 of economic,. political, and military power and presence distinguishes
 authentic global status from regional hegemony.
 In the 1990s, the ability of the United States and the Soviet Union to
 control developments outside their alliance systems and, to a lesser extent,
 within them will diminish steadily.  Second and third-ranking powers will
 become more reluctant to subordinate tl}eir separate .national interests to
 upholding t1r.e credibility and vitality of rival alliances

 or to support the global interests of the superpowers.  American and Soviet
 relations with allies and clients will grow more interdependent end the
 superpowers will have to deal with allies more as partnezs than as dependents.
 This trend will reduce the scope for unilateral initiatives by Wasnington and
 ?loscow and make the management of alliances more difficult.  European members
 of both NATO end the Warsaw Pact will increasingly seek to distance them-
 selves from superpower rivalry.  The rise of interest in the '?Europeanization
 of Europe" reflects a desire in both parts of the divided continent to reduce
 vulnerability to repercussions from U.S.-Soviet competition and confrontation.
 Helmut Schmidt articulated widespread European reactions to U.S.-Soviet
 polemics in the aftermath of the invasion of Afghanistan in his acerbic
 comment that "We can afford no gestures of strength and no doughty demonstra-
 tions of steadfastness.  We've had a noseful of that sort of thing."
 As the bipolar balance is gradually displaced by a multipolar system,
 simplistic notions of containment and zero-sum competition in both camps will
 give way to greater reliance on a diplomacy of flexible maneuver and to
 higher priorities for preserving maximum freedom of decision and action.
 The United States will increasingly encounter situationSin which important
 friends will be on both aides of a given issue, and it will frequently have
 to perform the. role of crucial intermediary rather than one of guaranteeing
 the security of allies and defending a rigid bipalar status quo.  America's
 principal interest in managing a multipolar system will be to protect its
 privileged position as the hub of a shifting network of alignments.
 The advantages of the bipolar system--a shared interest in preserving
 the central balance, stability, calculability, and clarity of threats to
 the system--will be replaced by uncertainties and instabilities that are .
 inherent in a multipolar configuration.  With five principal players, there
 will be greater risks of miscalculation, unilateral initiatives, and a loss
 of control.  The bipolar balance has not guaranteed stability, but it has
 been less subject to abrupt transformations and surprises titan the multi-
 polar structure will be.
 The United States will continue to have a compelling interest in
 maintaining close relations With a more, independent 1Jestern Europe and Japan

 not only because they will buttress Americe~'s superior position in a
 pentagonal system but also because trey will have the incentive and capacity
 to forestall a destabilizing bipolarization into two Hostile blocs in which
 one aide or the other must lose in any confrontation.  Bipolarisation of a
 multipolar system has been the prelude to several major wars, notably the
 division of Europe into tWO rival alliances that collided in 1914.  The
 dynamics of a multipolar system will center on competition among the
 major players for the advantages that will derive from leading a majority
 alignment within the five-power arena.  The Soviets are already maneuvering
 to secure this advantage.  Their efforts to arrange an accommodation with
 China and to strengthen leverage over Western Europe are aimed in part at
 achieving a pivotal role in the coming pentagonal system.  Aleksandr Yekovlev,
 director of IMEMO, claims to discern a "relative leveling in the strength
 of the three centers of (capitalist) power:  the U.S., Western Europe, and
 Japan."  He contends that "in the historically foreseeable future the
 centrifugal tendency in the capitalist world will grow."
 As inheritors of the European tradition of Realpolitik, Soviet leaders
 would endorse Bismarck's maxim for manipulating a five-power system:  "One
 must not lose sight of the importance of being one of three on the European
 chessboard.  That is the invariable objective of all cabinets and of mine
 above all others.  Nobody wishes to be in a minority.  All politics reduce
 themselves to this formulas  to try to be one of. three as long as the
 world is governed by an unstable equilibrium of five great powers."  The
 grand stakes in the internatinnal politics of the next half century will
 largely hinge upon the capacity.of American statecraft to preserve the
 enormous advantages inherent in postwar relationships with Western Europe
 and Japan, and upon the resourcefulness of the Soviet Union and an ascendant
 China in neutralizing these advantages by dissolving the majority alignment
 and securing the crucial pivotal role in a new majority coalition.
 The Soviet Union:  Domestic Trends and Prospects
 The passing of the old guard will not herald an era of major reforms
 in the Soviet political and economic systems.  Continuities will prevail
 over innovations in the next fifteen years because the successor generation,
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 just as its predecessor, will have to deal with the stern imperatives of
 managing and holding together a huge multinational internal empire in an
 age marked by the solvent forces of nationalism end modernity.  The new
 generation of leaders will face the same dilemma of how to modernize
 economically without modernizing politically.
 Domestic and foreign policies will continue to be conditioned by the
 Kremlin's perennial fear of losing control of powerful centrifugal forces
 in the empire.  This all-pervasive political-security reality will oblige
 any leadership in the next quarter of a century to cling to orthodox
 Marxism-Leninism as an indispensable means of legitimizing the Communist
 Party's monopoly of power.  Soviet elites will support, or at least
 acquiesce to, the  supremacy of the party because the fear of chaos and
 disintegra-lion will far outweigh yearnings for political freedoms and major
 reforms.
 Since the 13th century, Russia has existed not as a nation-state but as
 a multinational empire maintaiaed by formidable military forces and omni-
 present police controls.  The Soviet regime with its cant about enlightened
 nationality policies has concealed its dread of disintegration far better
 than its more candid Tsarist predecessors.  Alexander I warned that "The
 least weakening of autocracy would lead to the separation of many provinces."
 Sergei Witte, finance minister under Nicholas II, declared that "The world
 should be surprised that we have any government in Russia, not that we have
 an imperfect government.  With many nationalities, many languages, and a
 nation largely illiterate, the marvel is that the country can be held together
 even by autocracy."
 In addition to these fundamental historical and institutional barriers
 to major reforms that would undermine central control and thus tt~e survival
 of the .empire, the latitude of the new generation of leaders will be constrained
 by the accumulated inertia of the long Brezhnev era.  The basic political
 problem confronting the Gorbachev leadership will be how to restore the
 party's dominant role as the sole policy initiator and energizer of the
 ponderous party and state bureaucracies.  Gorbachev alluded to this problem
 in his "acceptance speech" to the Central Committee on 11 Marcie when he
 stressed that "The solution of the complex tasks we~are faced with presupposes
 a further strengthening of the party and a rise in its organizing and guiding.

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 role."  Under Brezhnev, the party gradually relinquished its unchallenged
 primacy and drifted into the role of arbiter among contending claimants to
 power and resources.  The Brezhnev gerontocracy nought to avoid hard ci~oicea
 .that would trigger disruptive tests of strength with powerful segments of
 the military and civilian estab]iahments and threaten the delicate balance
 within the Politburo and party Secretariat.  The price of preserving an
 untroubled status quo, however, wan economic stagnation, a large degree of
 immobilism in both domestic and foreign policy, and a sharp decline in the
 managerial effectiveness of the party, state, and economic bureaucracies.
 The entrenched inertia of Brezhnevism will circumscribe Gorbachev's
 options in the next few years.  Ke will have insufficient authority to do
 much more than reinvigorate Andropov's campaign to restore work discipline
 and bureaucratic accountability.  If [:orbachev, or a successor, succeeds in
 recovering the party's unquestioned dominance of policy and management, the
 Soviet economy, even without significant reforms, will resume a pattern of
 steady growth of four to five percent a year by the early 1990s, and the
 Soviet Union will. become a more formidable and assertive competitor in the
 international arena than it was during Brezhnev's last seven years and in
 the Andropov-Chernenko interregnum.
 The USSR will not experience anything approaching a genuine systemic
 crisis before the year 2000.  The system commands immense reserves of social
 and political stability that will enable the regime to ride out the economic
 stagnation and civic malaise of the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Even if
 marginal and incremental changes in economic policy and management do not
 ovezcome stagnation in the next decade,. the economy will maintain an average
 growth rate of two to three percent--slightly above the growth of the
 population.  The party apparatus will provide a reliable instrument for
 containing dissent and social frustrations.  Although there will be growing
 labor unrest and more frequent but sporadic work stoppages, these will focus
 on local grievances and will not expand into a nation-wide movement.  The
 fundamental source of the party's authority and control will continue to be
 its effectiveness in coopting successive generations of ambitious and
 energetic members of the social and national elites by offering them a
 substantial stake in the system in exchange for their loyalty.

 The Soviet economy, even at annual growth rates of only two to three
 percent, will command sufficient resources to maintain a formidable~militery
 machine and to support an assertive foreign policy.  It is the long-term
 implications of economic stagnation that will concern the Gorbachev leader-
 ship.  The declining growth rate of investment in recent years will eventually
 erode the basis for future growth of defense spending in the late 1980s and
 1990x.  The reduction in the growth of defense procurement to about two percent
 since the mid-1970s represents only a short-term expedient to avoid even
 deeper declines in investment and consumption.  The moment of truth for the
 Soviets will not come until the late 1980s and early 1990x.  If the ratio
 of Soviet GNP to that of the United States worsens, the Soviet Union's
 capacity to maintain global competition will then come into question.
 The moat important stimulus for change in Soviet policy and prospects
 in the next fifteen years will be a sweeping turnover of leaders and elites.
 This process will provide Gorbachev and his supporters with potentially
 decisive leverage to overcome the inertia of Brezhneviam.  Not only most of
 the top party leadership but a large part of the central elite will be ze-
 placed in the next decade by a successor generation.  Taere is no precedent
 in Soviet history for such a massive turnover in a short time-span.  The
 transition will act as a catalyst to release pressures for change and rejuvena-
 tion that have existed for the past decade but have been frustrated by the
 Brezhnev gerontocracy.
 The rise of so many members of a new generation to senior positions in
 the party, state, and military establishments will generate sharp competition
 and conflict over power and policy.  The departure of the old guard will end
 a prolonged period during which policy differences were contained, if not
 completely submerged, and the new leaders will find it much more difficult
 to preserve the usual facade of.unity.  Contention over economic priorities
 and defense policy-has agitated Soviet poli-tics since the last party congress
 in 1981, and these differences will break out in a more acute and open
 struggle in tt-e next five years.  This contest will reveal the  presence of
 widespread support for Chernenko's insistence last year that economic develop-
 ment and consumer welfare should have higher priority than defense.  Although ,
 Chernenko's prescriptions were rejected by the old guard led by Uatinov,

 Cromyko, and Romanov, they command considerable support in the present
 Central Committee, particularly among regional leaders w~~o are more sensitive
 to the danger of public unrest than the remote hierarchs in Moscow.  The
 departure of the old guard will erode tl~e strength of the defenders of
 traditional priorities and enhance the political acceptability of the
 policies that Chernenko championed.
 Tne Soviet Union;  Foreign Policy Trends and Prospects
 In the next five years, there will be no major changes in the foreign
 policy strategy that was outlined at the last party congress in 1981.
 Tne Gorbachev leadership's fundamental goals--especially as long as Gromyko
 continues to exercise preeminent influence in shaping foreign policy--will
 remain centered on achieving general recognition of the USSR's global
 political as well as strategic equality with the United States and altering
 the geopolitical balance in Europe by exploiting what the Soviets perceive
 as growing conflicts between American and West European economic and political
 interests.  The Soviets will persist fn their dual strategy of waging con-
 trolled cold war against the U.S. while promoting selective detente with
 West European governments.  They will continue to attach high priority to
 advancing an accommodation with China because this policy offers the
 quickest and least costly way to strengthen their leverage in dealing with
 the U.S., Western Europe, and Japan.  A rapprochement with China, moreover,
 will be an indispensable means of protecting the Soviet Union's position
 in the "strategic triangle" during the next decade and placing the USSR in
 the most favorable position as the multipolar configuration of-power begins
 to emerge in the late 1990s.
 Moscow's international behavior and freedom of action will be constrained
 not only by the requirements of manipulating the strategic triangle but by
 a growing need to import foreign technology, industrial plant and equipment,
 and grain.  A trend toward expanding economic relations with .the West and
 Japan will be irreversible in the next fifteen years if the Gorbachev leader-
 ship's efforts to reverse economic stagnation and, in Gorbacl~ev's words, to
 "transfer the national economy to the tracks of intensive development" are
 to have any chance of success.  The new generation will be bound as much as
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 the Brezhnev leadership by it~e fundamental judgment made in the late 1960s
 that imports of grain end technology and joint development ventures with
 Western firms are vastly preferable to the zfaks and uncertainties inherent
 in any major restructuring of tt~e Soviet economic and administrative systems.
 The Soviets will not abandon this basic, long-term national policy because
 they recognize that they cannot revert to a strategy of greater autarky and
 self-reliance.
 In addition to these geopolitical and economic constraints, Gorbachev
 will avoid provocative and high-risk foreign adventures that might generate
 potentially dangerous public unrest and even open resistance in the Soviet
 internal empire.  He shares the concerns expressed in the last two years by
 Andropov and Ghernenko that public dissatisfaction, if unattended or mis-
 managed, could assume "crisis" proportions.  In a speech last June, Gorba-
 chew carefully coupled a call for stronger vigilance and defense with an
 assurance that "iJe certainly do not believe that the cause of international
 detente has been irreversibly undermined."
 Soviet policy toward the United States in the next few years will be
 more active tactically but it will show little substantive change.  Although
 the Soviets will not expect any significant modifications in the Reagan
 Administration's foreign and defense policies, Gorbachev will agree to a
 bilateral summit meeting in the next year, seeing this encounter as a useful
 way to strengthen his political standing at home and to advance the Soviet
 Union's international pretensions to full superpower equality.  The Soviets
 will not alter their present negative assessment of prospects for arms control
 agreements in the next five years, and their view of economic and political
 trends in the United States will lead them to downgrade concerns four years
 ago that the President's program for modernizing U.S. strategic forces
 might eventually tilt the balance against the USSR.  They believe this
 threat has been averted for the foreseeable future.  Authoritative Soviet
 commentaries recently have portrayed congressional and public opinion as
 turning against-the Administration's defense policy and claimed that a
 "further increase in military spending is becoming intolerable because of
 inconceivable deficits that are placing the prospects for the development
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 of the U.S. economy as a who l? in question."  The Soviets, moreover, antici-
 pate a further weakening in the U.S. international trade and financial position
 that will erode the credibility and effectiveness of American foreign policy.
 With this evaluation of a long-term secular decline of America's
 relative economic and political power as the basis for their calculations,
 the Soviets will perceive little incentive for genuine concessions in
 arms control negotiations in the next five years.  The Gorbachev leadership
 will share Brezhnev's assumption following the failure of SALT II that an
 unmanageable arms race can be avoided by manipulating the political atmosphere
 and arms control issues to undermine the ability of U.S. administrations
 to mobilize a sustained effort to restore America's strategic preeminence.
 Constant assurances that the USSR is not seeking military superiority will
 be accompanied by ostensibly constructive initiatives for resolving the
 arms control impasse.  Sucmnit meetings and arms control negotiations will
 be used to wage political warfare against the U.S., not to explore prospects
 for an accommodation. .The long-term nature of the research phase of the
 Strategic Defense Initiative and the well-publicized reservations of West
 European governments regarding testing and deployment of such a system will
 encourage the Soviets to keep the "space weapons" issue at tt,e forefront of
 international attention.  't'hey will continue indefinitely to hold agreements
 on offensive nuclear weapons hostage to a prior agreement prohibiting the
 "militarization of outer space."
 .This scenario for controlled cold war with the United States as a
 .central element in Soviet foreign political strategy during the next five
 years will not be intended to foreclose collaboration with the U.S. on
 matters of mutual interest in the longer-term future.  The Gorbachev
 leadership will wish to keep the door open to expanded Soviet-American
 economic relations in the 1990s.  By the mid-to-late 1990x, the Soviets
 will have growing incentives to arrange a limited accommodation as the
 basis for political consultations and cooperation in containing a more
 assertive and expansionist China,~a resurgent Germany, and a nationalistic
 and ambitious Japan.  They recognize that "centrifugal- tendencies" in an
 emerging multipolar world will confront both superpowers with complex and     '

 potentially dangerous new problems, and they will want to keep their lines
 open to Washington.
 Strategy .f or dealing with a revival of the German question will be the
 centerpiece of Soviet foreign and imperial policies after the mid-1990s.
 Propaganda about German "revanchism" in the past five years has been a
 device to keep restless clients in Poland and East Germany in line, but
 the Soviets have no illusions tnat tc~e stable postwar line of division in
 Central Europe will be a permanent condition.  When the expectFd West Getman
 challenge to the status quo matures in the late 1990x, tiie Soviets will have
 only two principal alternatives.  Tney must either accept a potentially
 explosive showdown with a "revisionist" West Germany supported in varying
 degrees by its NATO allies, or seek early collaboration with the U.S.,
 France, and Britain to defuse the threat to East Germany and to the Soviet
 strategic glacis in Eastern Europe.
 The Soviets also recognize that a rapprocnement with China will not
 remove the long-term prospect of Chinese expansionism to the north as well
 as to the east and south, and this will provide another powerful incentive
 to avoid an irreversible freeze in Soviet-American relations.  If the
 leaders in charge of Soviet policy around the turn of the century lack the
 political foresight and resourcefulness to arrange timely collaboration
 with the United States in containing a resurgent Germany and an expansionist
 China, they will incur grave risks of stumbling into an unwanted war.
 Eastern Europe
 There is at least a SO-50 chance that crises in Moscow's East European
 empire in the next fifteen years will overwhelm its political strategy toward
 the West and destroy its capacity to protect its global interests in a
 pentagonal world.  Growing conflicts of interest between the Soviets and
 their Warsaw Pact allies will be compounded by an emerging Soviet-West German
 competition for influence in Central and Eastern Europe that will largely
 displace Soviet-American rivalry.  As a new generation of leaders assumes
 key decision-making positions in .the Federal Republic, the "national question"
 will increasingly override Bonn's traditional western orientation in foreign
 and security policies.  West Germany's changing priorities will stimulate

 more aggressive economic, political, and cultural penetration of East
 Germany and other Soviet bloc states by capitalizing on their need for
 -credits, technology, and expertise and then  desire for greater autonomy
 in relations with the West.
 Resurgent German nationalism and the resulting quest for a solution
 to the German problem will seriously aggravate Moacow'a dilemmas in
 imperial management.  In the absence of any effective and durable remedies,
 the Soviets will see no alternative but to plunge ahead with heavy-handed
 efforts to tighten economic and political controls in Eastern Europe. The
 non-remedy of promoting economic integration and specialization of produc-
 tion within CEMA will worsen the disease these measures are intended to
 cure.  The Soviets will discover that the economic and political costs of
 this strategy will increase and its effectiveness will diminish.  The
 policy of tightening imperial controls will cause significant declines
 in productivity and living standards, and the soviets will then respond
 by pressuring their allies to suppress manifestations of public discontent
 and intensify political discipline and mobilization.  These and otner
 simple solutions, however, will no longer work.  East European leaders will
 protest that the stability and even survival of their regimes depend on
 improving living standards and that internal reforms financed largely by
 Western credits are absolutely necessary to avert unmanageable threats to
 public order.
 Poland and East Germany will be particularly vulnerable to the political
 consequences of economic stagnation or decline.  Their regimes will face
 growing pressures for major changes in economic policy and organization
 from reformists in party and managerial elites, and this will intensify
 frictions in relations with Moscow.  In contrast to the crisis in 1980-81
 when the Soviets feared that the Polish disease would spread into East
 Germany, Moscow's: major concern in the next fifteen years will be that
 disarray and' instability in East Germany might fuel a chain reaction
 reaching into Poland and Czechoslovakia, as well as invite West German
 exploitation.
 East Germany will experience increasing political ferment arising from
 the regime's inability to maintain its "consumer communism".which has
 contained public discontent fn the last fifteen years.  The nonofficial
 peace movement--the strongest link between ti-e two Germanys--will grow

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 in size and visibility.  It will be increasingly regarded by the regime
 and the Soviets as a potential political opposition similar to Poland's
 Solidarity and as a dangerous source of agitation for the reunification
 of Germany.
 The Honecker regime will be unwilling to risk severing economic
 relations and dialogue wit~~ West Germany because these are the only
 available means of restraining public unrest.  Without access to West
 German transit routes and otj~er facilities througn tine Federal Republic
 and to Bonn's financial subsidies and credit guarantees, the regime will
 not be able to meet public expectations or keep prices of medical care,
 food, and consumer goods at low levels.  The Soviets will become more and
 more apprehensive about the potential political consequences of Bonn's
 growing economic influence in East Germany.  Pravda warned last summer
 that Bonn's guarantee of a $350 million bank credit to East Germany
 would be used as an "economic lever" to "erode the foundations of the
 socialist system and to break the postwar peaceful structure in Europe."
 The Soviets in the next five years will move to disarm this threat
 by increasing pressure on Honecker to reverse his dependence on Bonn.
 Soviet fear of losing control of the relations between ttie two Germanys
 will ultimately lead to a showdown with East Berlin.  It may be precipitated
 by a judgment that growing public unrest had become a serious threat to
 discipline in East Germany's military and security forces and thus to the
 regime's capacity to maintain public order.  If Honecker resists pressure
 to crack down, .the Soviets will replace him with a more compliant proconsul.
 This blatant interference in East German affairs will trigger massive protest
 demonstrations that will be suppressed by Soviet troops.
 A repetition of the East German uprising of 1953, but on a much larger
 scale, would compel a vigorous reaction from the Bonn government and entail
 high risks of rapid escalation.  With their entire position in East Germany
 at stake, the Soviets would be obliged to react to West German demands
 on behalf of the East German population in the most forceful manner.  This
 confrontation would signal the most serious and potentially fateful crisis
 in Europe since 1945.  It would also precipitate dangerous public reactions
 in Poland that might threaten the survival of the Warsaw regime and force

 Soviet military intervention.  Even if hostilities between Soviet forces
 in 8aat Germany and West German and NATO forces were averted or at least
 contained, Moscow's European policy and prospects would be shattered.
 With nothing to lose in terms of future relations with Bonn and the other
 Western powers, the Soviets might move to expel allied forces and West
 Germany's official presence from West Berlin and incorporate the western
 sectors into East Berlin.
 Any leadership in Moscow will view control of East Germany as the
 keystone of Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe, which in turn is vital to
 the preservation of the USSR's global geopolitical position. .The Soviets
 therefore will be prepared to commit any amount of armed force necessary
 to defend this stake.  Theft nuclear and conventional superiority on the
 continent will embolden them to beliPVe .they could prevail in a test of
 strength and nerves with West Germany and the U.S.  They would reject the
 alternative of a retrenchment of Soviet power in Central Europe through a
 negotiated settlement involving the reduction or removal of foreign forces
 in the two Germanys and some form of neutralization of both states.
 Western Europe
 By the year 2000, the political, economic, and military face of Europe
 will have undergone far-reaching changes in both the East and the West.
 The trend toward increasing contradictions between Soviet and East European
 interests as Moscow's clients seek to loosen imperial bonds will be
 paralleled by a drift in West European attitudes and policies toward greater
 independence within an attenuated Atlantic alliance.
 The security interests of the East European regimes will cause them to
 remain within the Warsaw Pact without pressure from Moscow, and West Euro-
 pean governments will prefer to retain the Atlantic connection.  The insti-
 tutional machinery of NATO and its integrated military planning, however,
 will become little more than a formal facade,-and the alliance will revert
 to a more traditional type of loose political-military coalition.
 Western Europe's gradual evolution into an autonomous, although far
 from cohesive, member of the emerging IItultipolar system will be powered by
 three main factors:  West Germany's growing preoccupation with the search
 for a German national identity;  amore pervasive public awareness of the
 political and military implications of the Soviet Union's achievement of

 of the American deterrent for Western Europe; and the imperatives of main-
 taining domestic political and social stability in an ere of economic stag-
 nation or, at best, low growth rates.  In the next five to ten years, Western
 Europe's eeonomic vulnerabilities will be the principal force pushing these
 governments toward accommodations with !loscow.  Such arrangements will in-
 creasingly be perceived as a prerequisite to gaining expanded access to
 Soviet and East European markets and resources.  This thrust will be greatly
 magnified if protectionist measures by the European Community, tine U.S.,
 and Japan set off a damaging trade war.
 Economic necessity will enhance the political attractions of an upoated
 version of de Gaulle's vision of a "European Europe,."  In view of the
 prospect that Western Europe's unemployment rate will reach 12 to 15 percent
 by the early 1990s, governments will not have the option of curtailing
 expensive social welfare programs, the cost of which has increased from a
 fifth to a fourth oz more of the gross domestic product in the last 15 years.
 Tc-ese domestic imperatives will strengthen political incentives to disengage
 from the Soviet-American rivalry and to adopt the role of broker between the
 superpowers, with the goal of easing East-West competition and facilitating
 the integration of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe into ttie European and
 international economic systems.
 A gradual transition from the role of dependent allies to that of
 autonomous brokers will be feasible for the first time since 1945 because a
 majority of West Europeans no longer regard the Soviet Union as the menace
 it was perceived to be in the first 25 years after  World War II.  There is
 now much greater public confidence in the West's political, ecoaomic, and
 technological superiority over the USSR.  This change in psychology is
 largely the product of demographic change.  A majority of West Europeans
 alive today were born since World War II, and members of this generation
 already hold important second-echelon positions in political parties,
 ministries, and parliaments.  By the early 1990s, many of them will occupy
 senior decision-making offices.  Although there will be many divergent,
 even incompatible, outlooks among the new generation of leaders--particularly
 those in Bonn-and Paris--tney will generally be urn~illing to view major
 international issues in a narrow context of East-West competition, and they

 will be much more inclined to act independently of the United States in
 promoting accommodationist policies toward the Soviet bloc.
 West Germany
 The new generation of West German leaders will be in the vanguard of
 autonomous European brokers.  In addition to sharing their western neighbors'
 incentives for accommodation with the East in search of markets and resources,
 the West Germans will be motivated by political ambitions to relax the
 barriers created by tine division of Europe and Germany.   Their ultimate
 goal will be to bring about a confluence of the two Europes in order to open
 the way  to a solution to the German problem in  ttie next century.
 The Federal Republic is in the midst of a transition from the postwar
 western orien ration to a more independent, nationalist outlook that will
 increasingly dominate national policy after the early 1990x.  There is already
 a deep gulf in attitudes between the older generation and those born since
 1945, witi~ the latter much more favorably inclined toward policy changes
 that would expand intra-German relations, cultivate a new German national
 identity, encourage a discreet evolution of the East German regime, and
 prepare the ground for some form of confederation that would ultimately
 lead to a united state.  All the West German political parties will be
 obliged to respond to this sentiment in tcie next decade.  Even now, the
 Green Party and the extreme right favor withdrawal of the two Germanys
 from their rival alliances as the first step in this process.  A poll
 sponsored by the Sc'nmidt government five years ago revealed that almost
 half of the population viewed "military neutrality" of both German states
 as a useful way of safeguarding peace in Europe.- Resurgent nationalism in
 the younger generation was reflected in a poll two years ago that showed
 that 64 percent of citizens aged 18 to 24 blamed international tensions
 on American policies, compared with 41 percent of those in the middle-age
 category, and only 29 percent of those 65 or older.  The director of the
 Allensbach polling organization recently described West Germany as "a
 psychological battlefield" in that the gap in values between parents and
 children is broader than in any other country in the West.
 Pressures to redefine national goals in ways that accommodate shifting
 public sentiment are evident in the recent statements and actions of

 current leaders in Bonn.  In outlining a future Deutschlandpolitik soon after
 the March 1983 elections, Chanchellor Kohl gave first priority to t1~e unity
 of the German nation, declaring that the "present circumstances are not
 unchangeable."  Two months ago, Kohl ignored objections from his foreign
 policy advisers end agreed to address a rally. of German exiles from
 Silesia in June.  Franz Josef Strauss, a vehement critic of past neutsch-
 landpolitik, negotiated major loans to East Germany in 1983 and 1984, and
 was greeted on the streets of East German cities with the adulation of a
 movie star.
 Any government in Bonn in the next 1S years will give much greater
 prominence to the obligation, mandated in the preamble to the Federal
 Republic's constitution, to work toward peaceful change in European borders
 that ultimately will bring territories now held by Poland, Czechoslovakia,
 and the~Soviet Union back under one German domain.  The Christian Democrats'
 Bundestag floor leader, Alfred Dregger, has declared that the partition of
 Europe is unacceptable and, in the long term, untenable and that the ultimate
 boundaries of Poland will be determined only when the Poles and all the
 Germans are free.  Last November the CDU's youth organization rejected a
 motion accepting the Oder-Neisse line as Poland's western frontier.
 Trends in public opinion could make the Bundestag elections in 1987
 a historic turning point in West German politics.  The decline of ttie Free
 Democratic Party in recent years could lead to its extinction as a political
 force and to its replacement by the Greens as the FRG's third party.  Were
 this?to occur, a Social Democratic-Green coalition government would be a
 real possibility.  The only alternative would be another CDU-SPD "grand
 coalition," but such a government would be incapable of pursuing coherent
 policies if Lhe left wing achieves control of the Social Democrats.  Oskar
 Lafontaine, mayor of Saarbruchen and a potential SPD candidate for chancellor
 in 1987. has called for a West German withdrawal from NATO'' military
 infrastructure and advocated unilateral disarmament.
 Revival. of the German question by an energetic and ambitious sew
 generation a~f leaders who will not be burdened by the traumas of the Nazi
 era will be viewed in Moscow as an ominous challenge to Soviet hegemony in
 Central and Eastern Europe and to the postwar status quo on the continent.

 deploy the maximum political and military resources to counter this threat.
 They will devise new "united front" tactics in appealing to Pzance and other
 West European states to loin in a common effort to contain German revanchiam
 and remove the threat of a third world war caused by German chauvinism and
 expansionism.
 The Bonn government in the 1990s will attempt to neutralize Soviet
 political initiatives and threats of military action to defend East Germany
 by asserting claims to the unqualified support of the United States and
 the other NATO allies.  Walther Leisler Kiep, a member of the presidium of
 the Christian Democratic Union, has declared that "a change in the current .
 state of affairs is a historical necessity" and that tine task of German
 policy now is "to persuade the various governments (of the Western allies)
 of the practical value to them in making German unity a central element of
 their policies."  West German demands for the support of its allies in
 advancing the Federal Republic's legitimate national aims will confront
 tt~e United States with its most critical decisions since 'World War II.
 Unequivocal support for West Germany will lead to the ultimate teat of
 strength and nerves with. the Soviet Union.  The stakes will be so high
 that Moscow will be unable and unwilling to back down.  Unforeseeable
 incidents or provocations by one side or the other could quickly escalate
 out of control.  On the other hand, American hesitation or.a forthright
 refusal to support the Germans would result in a political upheaval in
 the Federal 8epublic that would bring down the government and alienate
 West Germany #rom.the West indefinitely.
 Over forty years ago, Nicholas J. Spykman wrote that "A defeated nation
 that has not last its vitality inevitably adopts a revisionist policy because
 national pride demands that the symbol of its defeat be destroyed."  By
 the mid-to-late 1990x, the new generation of West Germans will have fully
 restored the nation's vitality and self-confidence, and the symbol of
 defeat for them will be the par tition  of Germany and its capital city.

 The Middle East
 Long-term trends in the Arab world will be shaped by the competition
 between two major forces, the outcome of which is contingent on ao many
 variables as to defy conjecture.  On the one hand, the ongoing process of
 modernization and economic development will give most Arab governments
 growing incentives to pursue separate national interests and to disengage
 from the constraints imposed by the traditional mythology of pan-Arabism
 and the "Arab nation."  These governments will gradually relinquish the
 time-honored game of manipulating the Palestinians as pawns in feuds with
 Israel and with rival Arab regimes.  Tt-e modernizing trend will erode the
 political and psyci~ological obstacles to emulating Egypt's example in
 coming to terms with the power and permanence of Israel.
 On the other hand, the resurgence of "Populist Islam" will pose grave
 challenges to Arab ruling elites and reduce their latitude for maneuver
 on the Palestinian issue.  Islamic fundamentalism in the 1990s and beyond
 will have powerful destabilizing effects throughout the region.  .It will
 increasingly become a vehicle for promoting various forms of revolutionary
 nationalism and the frustrated political and social aims of the middle
 classes as well as the dispossessed.  Populist Islam will not be the
 exclusive property of the Shiites or the Iranian revolution;  it will
 command equal attraction for Sunni .Muslims.  Fundamentalist movements will
 mount potent challenges to incumbent regimes, press for reforms of economic
 systems and rigid social structures, and campaign for the expulsion from
 tine Muslim world of "imperialist intervention."  Tne United States will be
 the principal target of Populist Islam because it is viewed as inseparable
 from Israel and as the main foreign defender of the status quo in the region.
 The outcome of this contest between two powerful forces will be determined
 to a large extent by trends in world oil prices and consumption and by the
 policies of the Western powers in dealing with the Arab-Israeli question.
 There will be a direct connection between the fortunes of the oil-producing
 states and the power and prospects of Populist Islam.  Saudi Arabia and the
 Sunni regimes in the six traditional Gulf states have managed to maintain
 the stability of their systems because oil revenues have enabled them to
 satisfy many of the economic and social demands of their populations.

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 If the recent decline in oil revenues aecelerates in the next decade,
 popular unrest in the oil states will escalate and the fundamentalists
 will become a more dangerous threat to the status quo defended by
 Establishment Islam.  The near-term trend will operate against the status
 quo.  OPEC's snare of global oil production has diminished from 75 percent
 in tue 1970s to less than 35 percent today.  World demand is now almost
 ten million barrels a day less than it was at its peak in 1979.  If present
 consumption trends in the industrialized countries continue, OPEC in the
 next five years will have essentially lost its capacity to control prices
 and restrict production.  If these trends lead to the collapse of the oil
 cartel,there will be far-reaching repercussions on the economic health and
 political stability of its members.
 Saudi Arabia's influence in Arab politics, vastly inflated by its role
 in the 1970s as the leading source of U.S. oil imports until 1981, will
 decline sharply.  Its oil income fell from $110 billion in 1981 to below
 $40 billion in 1984, and it will decline further in the next five years.
 There is at least a 50-50 chance that the resulting economic retrenchment
 will fatally erode the political authority of the Saudi royal family and
 trigger a power struggle among contending factions.  The outcome within
 the next decade could be a domestic upheaval, disintegration of the armed
 forces, and coup attempts culminating in the collapse of the present regime.
 The removal of Saudi Arabia's financial power would destabilize the politics
 of the Arab world, thereby affording unprecedented opportunities for Islamic
 fundamentalists and Iran's revolutionary regime to expand their power and
 influence throughout the region.  A collapse of Saudi financial, political,
 and military influence would undermine the positions of ruling elites in
 the Gulf states and tilt the power balance in the Gulf in favor of Iran.
 If economic expansion and a rising curve in oil consumption in the
 industrialized s-tates remove or at least postpone these threats to the status
 quo, the power potential of Populist Islam will be tempered and contained.
 The opposing trend of modernization and development will then exercise
 greater influence on Arab psychology and national policies unless these
 effects are arrested or even nullified by the West's handling of the Arab-
 Israeli dispute.  Assuming the challenge of Populist Islam is contained,
 the pace and prospects of an evolution in Arab policies toward an accommoda-
 tion with Israel in the next quarter of a century will depend to a great

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 extent on Western policies.  If the United States and the European Community
 remain committed to the prescription for an Arab-Israeli settlement contained
 in UN Security Council resolutions adopted 18 years ago, the latitude for
 gradual changes in Arab attitudes and policipa will be sharply circumscribed
 and Arab governments Will heve no choice but to persist in agitating the
 Palestinian cause.
 The political-military order in the Middle East that was embodied in
 these Security Council resolutions after the Six-Day War in 1967 has long
 since been made obsolete by the enormous growth in Israel's military and
 political strength, by President Sadat's removal of Egypt from the Arab
 coalition in 1977-79, and by Israel's destruction of the PLO in Lebanon
 in 1982 as an autonomous political-military force capable of asserting
 itself as a quasi-independent power in Arab politics.  These developments
 fundamentally altered the nature and stakes of the Arab-Israeli dispute.
 Western policies, however, have remained anchored to assumptions that were
 formulated in the late 1950s, namely, that this dispute is the major cause
 of instability in the Middle East that threatens the West's access to
 Gulf oil supplies and that the Palestinian question is the crux of the
 dispute.  As long as the Western powers continue to insist that a solution
 to the Palestinian question is essential to an Arab-Israeli settlement,
 Arab governments will be obliged to press for unachievable maximalist terms.
 They cannot afford to appear less dedicated to the Palestinian cause than
 the West.  The inability of the United States to deliver on unrealistic
 terms for a settlement will continue to provide opportunities for Arab
 radicals and the Soviet Union to capitalize on Arab frustrations and
 animosities toward Israel and the U.S.
 If the United States and the European Community were to disengage from
 the futile enterprise of brokering an Arab-Israeli settlement, with a
 solution t? the Palestinian question as the centerpiece, the long-term forces
 of modernization, economic development, and separate national interests will
 gradually move most Arab governments toward de facto acceptance of the
 impossibility of reversing the consequences of Israel's military preponderance.
 Under these circumstances, the PLO would rapidly lose its remaining, and
 highly artificial, status as a serious 'political force in the region;
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 Areb governments, in  their own self-interest, would eventually be free to
 adopt policies of assimilation of Palestinians in their countries as the
 only viable long-term solution.  Tne Arab states, moreover, would undergo
 grudging adjustments to irreversible realities, and a new regional order
 would emerge in the next quarter of a century not through a grand, compre-
 hensive settlement but through incremental accommodations to the requirements
 of dealing with a strong Israel in control of the West Bank, Gaza, and a
 united Jerusalem.
 Even in the absence of change in Western policy, the Palestinian
 question will gradually be overshadowed in Arab politics by a new phase in
 the traditional struggle for preeminence between a coalition led by Egypt
 and a new version of the "Steadfastness.Front" headed by Syria.  This
 renewed rivalry will rule out any prospect of a unified Arab position on
 a formal settlement  with Israel, and posturing on terms for negotiations
 will simply be one of the weapons used in the competition.  Iraq will play
 an opportunistic role with the usual aims of overshadowing Syria and pro-
 moting the ambition of displacing both Syria and Egypt as the preeminent
 Arab power.  This infra-Arab contest will be inconclusive until the balance
 of forces is altered to Egypt's advantage by the death of President Hafer
 Assad.  Hia departure will precipitate an upheaval in Syria focused on a
 debilitating struggle between Alawites-and Sunnis that will sharply diminish
 Syria's power and influence in the region.
 Syria's reversion to its pre-Assad condition of internal division,
 weakness, and rapidly shifting governments will afford Israel a free hand
 to proceed with its formula of "full autonomy" for Palestinian Arabs in
 the West Bank and Gaza under de facto Israeli sovereign ty.  The Palestinians
 will not be granted Israeli citizenship because i~ the Arabs in the
 "occupied territories" were added to the half million already in Israel,
 more than one-third of the total population of the Israeli state would be
 Arab.  Since tfie Arab population has been increasing at twice the rate of
 the Israeli, the proportion within a decade would be 50 percent.
 Political trends in Israel in the next 15 years will increase the
 likelihood that the Israelis will deal with this Arab demographic problem
 by "exporting" a substantial part of it to Jordan. -Israeli politics will

 become increasingly polarized betty@en the Sephardic and the Aakenazia, with
 both the Likud bloc and the Labor Alignment growing more and more "ethnic."
 The prospective erosion of Labor strength and the rise of the Nationalist-
 Religious bloc will strengthen advocates of encouraging the emigration of
 bleat Bank and Gaza Arabs to Jordan.  A majority of  Israelis in the next
 decade will come to view Palestinian predominance in Jordan as an appro-
 priate "solution" on the ground, as Foreign Minister Shamir has put it,
 that "Jordan and Palestine are identical and Jordanians and Pales*_inians
 are one and the same."
 The influx of West Bank and- Gaza Palestinians into Jordan--either
 voluntarily or under Israeli pressure--will produce an internal crisis
 that will lead to civil strife and the downfall of the Hashemite dynasty
 before the end of the century.  The 1.1 million Palestinians in Jordan
 already comprise 60 to 70 percent of the kingdom's population, and the
 arrival of hundreds of thousands more will tilt the balance decisively
 against the traditional Jordanian clans and Bedouin tribes which form
 the real base of King Hussein's power.
 The advent of a Palestinian government in Jordan dominated by the
 contemporary equivalent of the PLO will begin a new phase .in the long
 war of succession to the British Mandate in Palestine.  Israeli govern-
 ments will have little choice but to conduct an aggressive strategy of
 coercive diplomacy in dealing with the new regime in Amman.  The Israelis
 will respond to Palestinian subversion in the bleat Bank by greatly ex-
 panding Jewish settlements, expelling large numbers of the Arab population,
 and extending Israeli law and administration to the occupied territories.
 Repercussions from these events will bring the process of Arab accommoda-
 tion to Israel's power and permanence to a halt for a decade or more,
 but an eventual truce between a Palestinian Jordan and Israel will open
 the way for-the consolidation of a new regional order.  The Palestinian
 question finally will have been resolved, and the emergence of a genuine
 inter-state system in the Arab world free of the disruptive grievances of
 stateless Palestinians will dissolve the barriers to a modus vivendi.

 The Iranians will continue a war of attrition with Iraq as long es the
 Ayatollah Khomeini survives.  The initial successor regime will be too weak
 and divided to make a settlement, but it will gradually liquidate the war
 by arranging tacit cease-fires and minor exchaagea of territory.  The
 fighting will subside in a year or ao without a formal peace under con-
 ditions that closely resemble the terms of the Algiers Accord of 1975.
 Knomeini's death will remove the only authoritative voice able to
 contain disputes among rival factions in the ruling Islamic Republic
 Party (IRP).  A succession struggle will pass through several stages
 before a strong and charismatic figure emerges to impose an internal
 settlement.  Ayatollah Montazeri, Khomeini's designated successor, will
 have neither the strength nor the ability to consolidate his authority.
 Contention over power and policy will deepen into sporadic open warfare
 between Khomeini's main supporters in the IRP~s Maktabi faction backed by
 the bulk of the Revolutionary Guard, on the one hand, and a coalition of
 the traditional clergy who have never accepted Khomeini'a primacy, rival
 IRP factions and elements of the Guard, and major segments of the armed
 forces, on the other.
 After a period of virtual civil war, a stable successor regime will
 gain mastery by the early 1990s.  At the outset, it will be more "pragmatic"
 only in the sense that it will have to represent a broader spectrum of
 political interests than the Khomeini regime.  In foreign affairs, the
 new regime will continue to regard itself as the custodian of an~ongoing
 Islamic Revolution with a messianic mission to export the revolution.
 It will persist in a hostile stance toward both the United States and the
 Soviet Union--the "Great Satan" and the "Lesser Satan"--and it will maintain
 the role of champion of oppressed Islamic and Third World nations.  In
 prosecuting its messianic mission, the successor leadership will rely more
 on proselyting, subversion .and sabotage than on the overt use of military
 force.  It will intensify efforts to compel Arab governments of the Gulf
 region_to acknowledge Iran's preeminent leadership, and it will continue
 to host and subsidize revolutionary groups from these countries and other
 Arab states.                                           .~

 The new leadership will achieve a gradual but steady economic recovery
 and restoration of Itan's position ea the moat powerful state in the Culf.
 The Revolution's influence in the Arab world in general, however, will con-
 tinue to be limited by the long history of conflict and rivalry between
 Pezaians and Arabs.  The unique political personality of Shia rule in
 Iran, moreover, will dilute the revolution's appeal even among~Sunni
 fundamentalist movements which genezally dominate Populist Islam in
 Arab countries.  By the mid-1990s, the revolution will enter a Thermidorian .
 period in response to urgent economic imperatives and tae ascending influence
 of the professional and business classes.  The xenophobic, messianic com-
 ponent will be tempezed, and Iranian politics will partially revert to the
 pre-revolutionary tradition of rival domestic forces seeking foreign
 support.
 East Asia
 The far-reaching changes in the political and economic landscape of
 Europe will be matched by equally portentous alterations in the East Asian
 configuration of power in the next fifteen years.  East Asian politics will
 be increasingly dominated by an ascending China committed to becoming the
 preeminent power in Asia early in the next century.  In the mid-1990s,
 China will .~dertake a long-term career of geopolitical expansion that will
 coincide with the resurgence of German nationalism and a bid for preponderance
 in Central Europe.
 China's initial moves to resolve long-standing territorial claims to
 the east and south will accelezate an evolution in Japan's foreign and
 defense polacies toward greater independence and self-reliance.  China's
 expansionism will cause Japan and the Soviet Union to discover common
 strategic, political, and economic interests, and they will craw closer to
 each other in order to counter China's challenge.  These trends will confront
 the United Mates with hard choices in protecting its position in the
 strategic triangle and in managing its relations with a nationalistic Japan.
 while dealing simultaneously with poteptially explosive tensions between
 West Germany and the Soviet Union.

 A  -
 Chinas  Domestic Trends and.Proapecta
 China'a aspirations to become the dominant power in Aaie will ultimately
 prevail over the potential advantages of collaborating with the Weat and
 Japan in integrating the Chinese economy into an interdependent world system.
 In the medium-ter~- future, however, China's economic and military priorities
 will ensure a continuation of the opening to the West since the early 1970s.
 Barring a domestic political crisis triggered by a succession struggle
 after Deng Xiaoping's death, Beijing in the ,next decade will maintain what
 it describes as an "independent and self-sufficient foreign policy" in order
 to protect access to Western and Japanese trade, credits, and technology
 that are vital to achieving the "Four Modernizations" of agriculture, in-
 dustry, science and technology, and the armed forces.  Deng?s departure will
 create serious problems since none of his principal lieutenants commands
 sufficient authority to perform his unique role in the party leadership.
 If Deng dies in the next year or two, there will be a 40 percent chance of
 a disorderly succession contest because General Secretary Hu Yaobang and
 Premier Zhao Ziyang would not by then have accumulated the power and
 support necessary to avert challenges to their leadership.  If Deng survives
 another five years, however, Hu and Zhao would be in a stronger position to
 manage an orderly succession.
 Even if China experiences a post-Deng period of political struggle and
 confusion, this will not result in sweeping policy reversals or derail the
 party's long-term programs for economic reform and the Four Modernizations.
 The pendulum will not swing back again to the nativistic and xenophobic
 China of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution.  Deng's designated successors
 are acutely sensitive to the volatility of China's politics and they will
 manage to avoid another prolonged-and costly upheaval.  Hu Yaobang bluntly
 reminded high-level party officials last January that the party had "wasted
 twenty years" since the revolution in 1949 because of "radical leftist
 nonsense," and he warned that "We can never again afford internal chaos,
 or we will cause our own collapse and poverty."

 Chinas  Foreign Policy Prospects
 China's geopolitical expansion will peas through four major phases in
 the next twenty-five years.  Within two to four years, Beijing will reopen
 the issue of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan as an instrument to compel movement
 on the broader question of reunification of the island with the mainland.
 The second phase will appear in the early-to-mid-1990s after China's land,
 atr and naval capabilities have been strengthened by imports of western
 military equipment, weapons designs and technology, aircraft engines, and
 naval propulsion and air defense systems.  The Chinese will move to enforce
 their claims to the continental shelf in the 7ellow and East China Seas and
 to islands and shoals in the East and South China Seas that are in dispute
 with Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia.  In
 addition to obtaining control of vast reserves of offshore oil that are
 believed to lie at exploitable depths, in these seas, China will seek to
 secure predominance in the strategic passageway through the South China
 .Sea between the Western Pacific and the straits leading into tiie Indian Ocean.
 In this second phase, the Chinese will proceed on the assumption that the
 Uaited States, in the interest of avoiding a disruption of bilateral relations,
 will offer no more than rhetorical resistance to their thrusts to the east
 and south.
 After these objectives have been achieved, the Chinese will be ready
 in the late 1990s to launch the third phase of expansion.  They will attempt
 to break Vietaam'a ties to the soviet Union and establish preponderant
 influence in Southeast Asia.  They will also maneuver to bring Japan and
 the two Koreas into relationships of economic and strategic dependence on
 China and to reduce American influence and presence in Rest Asia and the
 Western Pacific.  Throughout the first three phases, China will seek to
 neutralize soviet power and resistance by cultivating normal and stable
 and mutually beneficial relations with Moscow.-  Beijing will gamble that
 the Soviets will concede Southeast Asia as a sphere of Chinese primacy in
 order to avoid a test of strength that would deflect China from challenging
 American interests in East Asia and the Pacific.  China's aims in Southeast
 Asia will require the threat and use of major land, sea, and air power to
 cow Hanoi into submission and intimidate the ASEAN -states into acquiescing

 2 7'
 in the establishment of preponderant, if not exclusive, Chinese influence
 throughout the region.
 Beijing's strategy to displace the United States as the preeminent
 foreign influence in Japan and South Korea will rely primarily on securing
 decisive leverage through offers to supply vast quantities of energy fuels
 and raw materials and to expand joint production ventures in China and on
 the continental shelf.  These initiatives will be reinforced by displaying
 superior air. and naval power in the Yellow and East China Seas.  This
 pattern of Chinese leverage wes first illustrated in the Sino-Japanese
 $20 billion trade agreement in 1976 which provided for an exchange of
 Chinese raw materials, especially oil and coal, for Japanese manufactures
 and industrial products.
 As China's interests and ambitions expand along with her economic and
 military power in phase three, she will increasingly collide with American
 interests in East Asia and the Western Pacific.  The United States will then
 revert to its status in the 1950s as China's "principal enemy" because
 America will be the only country, aside from a temporarily neutralized
 Soviet Union, that has the strength to resist and contain Chinese expansionism.
 The Chinese, however, will endeavor to design and control their initiatives
 toward Japan and South Korea in such a way as to avoid riskiag direct military
 confrontations which would completely disrupt Sino-American relations and
 undercut the Four Modernizations as well as destroy China's chances of
 playing the U.S. off against the Soviet Union in the fourth phase of its
 career of expansion.
 This final phase will appear in the second or third decade of the next
 century when China turns the tables on the Soviets, confronting them with.
 demands for a settlement of territorial disputes in Siberia and Soviet
 Turkestan on Chinese terms, restoration of Chinese primacy in Iiongolia,
 and major reductions of Soviet military forces along the Sino-Soviet border.
 China's aims vis-a-vis the USSR will closely resemble its objectives with
 respect to the United States, namely, to bring about major retrenchments
 in ttie presence and influence of both superpowers in East Asia, thereby
 clearing the. way for China to become the unchallenged dominant power in Asia.

 Taiwan
 Beijing's inteationa toward Taiwan deserve special attention because
 the outcome of its initiatives in the next few years will have major effects
 not only on Sino-American relations but also on the long-term expansion of
 China's power in Eaat Aaia.  A failure of China's policy on the highly-
 charged Taiwan question, moreover, could produce a domestic political
 crisis that would strengthen Deng Xiaoping's opponents--primarily senior
 military officers and party bureaucrats who remain loyal to Mao's legacy
 and stubbornly resist Ueng'a economic reforms and plans for smaller, more
 professionally competent armed forces.
 The Chinese have elevated "reunification of Taiwan with the Chinese
 motherland" to the positfon of one of their three top priorities for the
 1980s.  They will be unwilling to live much longer with the ambiguous
 Sino-U.S. compromise of August 1982, and they will soon resume heavy
 pressure on Washington to halt arms sales completely, or at least establish
 a definite date for their termination.
 There is a direct relationship between Beijing's recent initiatives to
 improve the atmospherics of relations with the Soviet Union and its plans
 to reopen the arms sales issue.  The Chinese are confident that the slow
 but steady movement toward a rapprochement with Moscow will strengthen
 their leverage with Washington on this question.  Their initial move will
 be to sharpen private and public complaints that the U.S. has neither acted
 on its August 1982 pledge to reduce weapons sales nor urged Taiwan authori-
 ties to take steps toward negotiating peaceful reunification.  Tire Chinese
 may be awaiting another downturn in U.S.-Soviet relations, calculating that
 Washington's incentive to avoid damage to ties with China would then be even
 greater.  They will gamble that the U.S. will be obliged to halt arms sales
 if confronted with an ostensible choice between satisfying Beijing's demands
 or risking the consequences a disruption of relations with China.  In sum,
 the Chinese are convinced that the improvement in relations with Moscow has
 already enabled them to secure the "swing" or pivot position in the strategic
 triangle--an advantage lust affords them greater potential for maneuver than
 Washington possesses.
 In the next few years, Beijing will feel growing urgency to induce

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 movement on the Taiwan question because of concern that the death of President
 Chiang Ching-kuo will trigger a succession struggle in Taiwan in which a
 majority of native-born Taiwanese will make a bid for power and independence.
 Elderly Kuomintang leaders will soon pass from the scene, increasing the
 chances, in Beijing's view, that Taiwanization of the political system will
 accelerate so Tepidly that China will be confronted with the fait accompli
 of a unilateral declaration of independence.  The value of agitating the
 arms sale issue lies in Beijing's expectation that a cessation of U.S.
 weapons deliveries will precipitate a political crisis in Taiwan that will
 compel Chiang Ching-kuo to accept China's seemingly generous terms for
 reunification as the only way to avert a collapse of Kuomintang power.
 If China's scenario proves to have been based on a miscalculation of
 its ability to bluff the United States into halting arms sales, or an exaggera-
 tion of the impact an arms cutoff would have in Taiwan should the bluff
 succeed, the Chinese in a year or two would have to raise the stakes.  They
 may then bring the reunification question to a head by attempting to entrap
 the Taiwan authorities into military actions in the Strait that could be
 portrayed as provocations justifying reprisal in the form of a ban on all
 traffic from Taiwan to the offshore islands of Quemoy and Matsu.  The
 political purpose of this blockade would be to isolate some 100,000 Nationalist
 troops on the islands, making them hostage to Taiwan's agreement to negotiate
 reunification on Beijing's terms.  China's naval and air forces now have the
 capability to close the Taiwan Strait and threaten to starve the Nationalist
 garrisons on the offshore islands unless Taipei capitulates.
 Japan
 The reappearance of Great Han expansionism will have profound effects
 on Japanese foreign and defense policies.  Critical decisions will be made
 during a period of generational change in Japan's political and business
 elites.  The outlook of the successor generation will be similar in many
 ways to that of the new generation of West German leaders.  As postwar
 Japanese leaders leave the stage, public and elite attitudes toward the

 United States, China, and the Soviet Union will undergo significant changes
 that will make the U.S.-Japanese relationship much more difficult .to manage.
 Tne new generation, having been raised in relative affluence, Will carry no
 burdea of guilt or inferiority expressed through deference and acquiescence
 to the United States.  A majority of younger Japanese now believes their
 nation's economic performance is superior to that of the U.S., an attitude
 that will make traditional American practices of wringing concessions on
 trade counterproductive.  The last decade has witnessed a strong resurgence
 of national self-confidence and assertiveness that is reflected in a deluge
 of historical revisionism challenging the war-guilt thesis on which Japanese
 adults were educated.  More than half of the population was born after the
 Japanese defeat in 1945, and young adults view the present generation of
 political and business leaders as too subservient to American economic and
 strategic intezests.
 U.S.-Japanese relations will continue to be aggravated by Japan's
 deep-rooted obsession with maintaining a huge export surplus in order to
 finance vital imports of food, fuel, and raw materials.  In the last half
 decade, exports have accounted for 40 percent of Japan's economic growth
 and 22 percent of its GNP.  The nation's unique political-economic culture
 will preclude significant reductions in this explosive dependence on ever
 rising exports.  If the European Community and the United States impose
 protectionist measures to curb these exports, the Japanese will focus
 greater attention on their markets and "export platforms" in Southeast
 Asia and seek new markets in Latin America and the Soviet Union.  Western
 moves to reduce Japanese competition will also cause an emotional public
 backlash that will strengthen undercurrents of opinion that are already
 pressing for significant changes in Japan's foreign and security policies.
 If a trade war and its damaging political repercussions can be averted,
 the new generation of Japanese leaders will not end the security relation-
 ship with the L'.S. or abrogate the- Mutual Security Treaty, but they kill
 act to recover full control over tree nation's destiny and end what they
 view as the subordination of Japan's freedom of decision to American policy.
 In the 1990s, Japan's foreign policy priorities will. diverge sharply from

 Ameriea'a, snd the Jepaneae will insist on a free hand in defining Jopen'a
 obligations under the Mutual Security Treaty.  The desired freedom to
 pursue separate national interests will be expressed in an independent and
 more "equidistant" diplomacy that will seek to ensure cordial relations with
 both  China and the Soviet Union.  The growing Sino-Soviet rapprochement will
 give Japan more latitude for maneuver vis-a-vis Moscow and Washington,
 especially the latter.
 As China moves into an era of expansion, the Japanese will increasingly
 rely on improved relations with Moscow to counterbalance Chinese power.
 Tokyo will be obliged to shelve its demands for tine return of the Southern
 Kurile Islands as the precondition for a peace treaty and a complete normaliza-
 tion of relations with the Soviet Union.  The Japanese, moreover, will find
 that the political benefits of investments and joint development ventures in
 Siberia will override their economic liabilities.
 In dealing with sensitive issues arising from growing competition with
 China for political influence and markets in Asia and. from China's efforts
 to bring Japan into a position of economic and security dependence, the
 Japanese will try to beat the Chinese at their owa game.  In order to
 secure leverage over China's policy toward Japan, Tokyo will seek to develop
 substantial integration between the two economies so that Beijing would
 damage itself if it attempted economic blackmail against Japan.
 Japan's defense policy in the next fifteen years will jettison the
 evasions and  euphemisms required by the constitutional prohibition on the
 maintenance of land, sea, and air forces and the self-imposed defense budget
 ceiling of under one percent of GNP.  A substantial rearmament program will
 command growing support in a climate of revived nationalism, and the
 public will support dropping the war renunciation article in the coastitution.
 If Japan's confidence and sense of security are threatened by trade wars
 or China's external behavior in tne~next two decades, the program advocated
 by aggressive nationalists on the political right will command general
 support--a power policy based on a Japanese nuclear force de frappe. as the
 only reliable means to protect the nation's security, particularly the
 long oil lifeline through the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean.  Almost
 half the public now believes Japan will have an independent nuclear arsenal

 .before the end of the 1980s.  A militant nationalism and self-reliance
 will also require the removal of American military and naval forces and
 bases from the main islands and Okinawa. and abrogation of-the security treaty.
 The Koreas
 A potentially explosive breakpoint in the impasse between North and
 South Korea will occur in the next three to five years as a result of
 changes in the leadership of both states.  The succession processes will
 generate power struggles that will not only make intentions and actions
 more unpredictable but also increase the chances of miscalculation, provo-
 cation, and accident.
 In the next three years, President Chun Doo Hwan will face growing
 pressure from the new Korea Democratic Party for sweeping liberalization
 of the political system, particularly direct election of his successor
 and concessions granting the National Assembly a much more prominent role
 in public policy.  The outcome of the national elections last February in
 which the new opposition party demonstrated formidable streng th in Seoul
 and other cities foreshadows a period of rfsing~volatility in South Korean
 politics.
 A crucial turning point will come when Chun Doo Hwan's term expires in
 1988.  If he tries to amend the constitution that limits the president to
 one term or seeks by extra-legal means to designate a successor, violent.
 protest demonstrations exceeding the riots and virtual anarchy in early
 1980 after Chun's seizure of power will be inevitable.  In a climate of
 political violence and repression, Chun may suffer the same fate as nis
 predecessor, Pak Chong-hi, in 1979.  Tne fact-that-the expiration of Chun's
 term will coincide with the Olympic Games in Seoul will make 1988 an even
 more volatile year in Korean politics.
 In North Korea, the death of Kim I1-song in the-next five years will
 be followed by a disorderly and violent struggle over Kim's attempt to
 ensure the succession of his son Kim Chong-il.  The old president's demise
 will remove the only force capable of controlling a_fractious party elite.
 After a period of factional warfare, the high command of the armed forces

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 will impose North Koree'a equivalent of martial law.
 Periods of instability end violence in both North end South will
 generate incidents along the Demilitarized Zone and contrived war scares
 on both sides, but neither regime will rink major offensive actions against
 the adversary.  The long-term Korean equation will change, however, as an
 ascending China seeks to draw both states into-its sphere of exclusive
 influence and the Soviet Union, Japan, and the United States move to
 counter Beijing's ambitions.  This competition will increase the incentives
 and opportunities for all these foreign powers to expand their presence and
 influence in both parts of Korea.  The paradoxical outcome may well be that
 contacts and growing mutual interests between the rival Korean regimes
 will for the first time since 1945 open genuine prospects for movement
 toward some form of limited confederation.
 The Philippines
 The United States in the next five years will face the kind of dilemma
 it experienced in Iran in late 1978:  whether to throw full support behind
 a friendly. authoritarian regime's efforts to suppress a rapidly growing mass
 opposition or to disengage from the ,Marcos leadership in order to protect
 American interests during a transition to a new political order.  Marcos
 will not be able to arrest the erosion of public confidence is his leader-
 ship or the decay of his political authority.  He confronts the familiar
 predicament of entrenched political machines in developing nations:  he
 cannot implement sweeping economic, military, and political reforms without
 undercutting his political base.  There is little or no prospect therefore
 of effective reform and revitalization of the Philippine armed forces.
 There is an equally scant prospect that the political establishment
 will have sufficient time or command the quality of leadership necessary
 to develop a plausible alternative to the present regime.  The authoritarian
 system Marcos has installed since 1972 has destroyed the foundations of the
 defective but relatively open democratic system that ,existed in the 1950s
 and 1960x.

 The Philippines, like South Korea, will enter a crueial period in the
 next two or three years.  An election year in 1987 will be a critical turning
 point.  If the Communist New People's Army (NPA) continues to advance et its
 present rate, Marcos or his chosen successor will invoke the sixth consti-
 tutional amendment which authorizes the president to rule by decree.  This
 action will be justified by the threat from the NPA and alleged foreign
 Communist support for the guerrillas.  Such a stratagem will provoke massive
 protest demonstrations that will far exceed the scope and violence of protests
 in tiie summez of 1984.  These upheavals will afford the NPA and the Communist
 National Democratic Front unprecedented opportunities to infiltrate urban
 areas and non-Coem-unist opposition groups.  Breakdowns in .public order will
 also precipitate a massive capital flignt and freeze foreign investments
 and loans, thereby bringing the urban economy to the brink of collapse.
 Prevailing trends will facilitate an expansion of the NPA and its
 areas of control.  Opposition forces will attempt to exploit spreading
 public hostility to America's identification with the Marcos regime by
 demanding the removal o.f U.S. bases at Clark Field and Subic Bay, and
 guerrilla groups will stage terrorist attacks on these installations.
 There will be a 70 percent chance that the Marcos regime or its
 immediate successor will fragment and collapse within five years, and a
 50 percent chance that a regime controlled by the NPA and the National
 Democratic Front will take power largely by default.
 Central America
 The political dynamics of the region in the next 15 years will continue
 to be driven by a confused and often violent transition from the political-
 economic order that evolved during -the first five decades of the century
 toward a new distribution of power.  Except for a relatively stable Costa
 Rica, domestic conflicts will ebb and flow until the present polarization
 of forces is gradually replaced by monolithic orders ruled in the
 Bolivarist tradition either by dominant figures oz by, small elite groups.
 Most of these new regimes by the year 2000 will be variants of the pattern

 established by the Mexican Revolution from 1911 to 1929--an authoritarian
 elite governing in the name of the whole people.  Political, economic, and
 social conditions in the next two decades will not provide congenial environ-
 ments for the growth of pluralism or pseudo-liberal democracy.
 The Sandinista revolution will prove to be a uniquely Nicaraguan
 phenomenon, not the wave of the future in Central America.  Its messianic
 impulses will be neutralized and contained by the regime's limited compe-
 tence, by deterrent pressures exercised by the United States and other
 states in the region, and by sporadic multilateral efforts by Mexico,
 Colombia, and .Venezuela to promote regional accommodations.  The Sandinista
 government will settle into an erratic and precarious existence, sustained
 largely by subsidies and advisory assistance from Cuba and the Soviet.Bloc.
 Recalcitrant problems of governing in the next five to ten years will divide
 the Sandinista Directorate into competing factions, with periodic power
 struggles and purges leading ultimately to the rise of a dominant leader
 in command of a new monolithic order.  This system, like the present one,
 will lack the reserves of economic competence and political credibility
 essential to a career of exporting revolution.
 The Soviet Union and Cuba will retain a substantial presence in
 Nicaragua, but Moscow's interest in the region will be confined to demonstrating
 its capacity as a global power to exercise influence in any region of the
 world, particularly one located in the traditional U.S. sphere of influence.
 The conflict in E1 Salvador will gradually subside in the next three
 to five years without a formal settlement.  Remnants of the FMLN insurgents
 will be confined to scattered and isolated areas along the Honduran border
 and they will persist indefinitely in spozadic and largely ineffective
 guerrilla ,activity.  Shifting coalitions among centrists in the political
 and military establishments will consolidate sufficient authority to provide
 tolerable internal order and national administration.  The FMLN-FDR will
 fragment, dividing non-Communist leftists from hard-core Communist cadres.
 Revolutionary nationalism, however, will persist as a potentially decisive
 .force in E1 Salvador, as well as in Honduras, Guatemala, and Panama, and a
 new incarnation of this force will emerge again in the next ten to twenty
 years.                                                                        '

 Panama wl11 become the principal focus of U.S. concerns in Ccntrel
 America in the laic 1980s, overshadowing Nicaragua and E1 Selvedor.
 Economic stagnation and explosive population growth will lead to an un-
 manageable political upheaval which the government will try to contain
 and deflect tnrougn chauvinistic demands that the Canal Treaties concluded
 in 1977 be revised in ways that would grant a mucks larger financial settle-
 . went (now $50 million a year) and move forward the-date for tranaferzing
 canal territory to full Panamanian sovereignty.  By the end of the 1980s,
 the transition to full sovereignty will be only half complete, with a
 final transfez only in the year 2000.
 Panama's population will increase by half by 1990, and the economic
 and social pressures this growth will generate will be well beyond the
 government's capacity to control.  Public discontent will fuel strong
 revolutionary nationalism that will quickly focus on the alleged inequities
 of the Canal Treaties.  There is already a large reservoir of dissatisfaction
 and resentment toward the United States.  Nearly one out of three Panamanians
 voted against the treaties in a plebiscite staged by the late President Omar
 Torrijos seven years ago.
 Public chauvinism will escalate beyond control, resulting in attempts
 to sabotage and occupy canal locks and other facilities in canal territory.
 Closure of the canal, if prolonged, could have a catastrophic effect on
 fuel supplies and shipping costs within the United States.  Some 70 percent
 of all ships tzansiting the canal have U.S..pozts as their destination,
 and many of these are oil tankers. .The canal, moreover, is a vital lifeline
 to Japan and Australia, as well as to countries on the west coast of South
 America.
 Mexico
 In the late I990s and well into the next century, Mexico will experience
 a series of destabilizing social and political crises that may well destroy
 the existing power structure.  The populist nationalism and patronage system
 that are the main legacies of the Mexican Revoution-ono longer provide

 effective inatrumenta for coping with the consequences of a prodigious
 rate of population growth, which now stands at 3.S percent a year--tl~e
 fastest among major nations.  The current population of 63 million will
 have grown by half at the end of the 1980s and duplicated itself by the
 year 2000.  Almost one of every two Mexicans is under 1S years of age, and
 45 percent of the labor force is now umm~ployed or marginally employed.
 Agriculture is in a state of decline and the rate of economic growth has
 slowed from the steady 6 percent a year in the past three decades.
 The population explosion and high unemployment will produce further
 debt crises aimilaz to that in mid-1982, which was caused largely by the
 government's policy of financing welfare spending through foreign loans
 rather than by taxing the nation's wealthy classes--a choice dictated by
 the domestic power structure.  Thin policy was undermined when the world
 recession in 1981-82 drastically curtailed revenues from oil and gas sales
 that would have serviced the foreign debt.  Even in a favorable environment
 of world economic expansion, Mexico's oil will only postpone the time of
 reckoning unless the decline of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
 Party's (PRI) moral and political authority can be reversed in the next
 decade--an unlikely prospect.' Electoral defeats during this period and a
 growing challenge from the center-right National Action Party will increas-
 ingly polarize Mexican politics and force the PRI to tighten authoritarian
 methods of control.
 The explosive potential of these trends will be compounded by the
 uncontrollable problem of illegal emigration to the United States.  If
 the .critical safety valve of emigration should be closed in the next few
 years, the result will be social chaos and political upheaval in Mexfco as
 well as a grave crisis in relations with the U.S.  If the problems of
 political reform and rejuvenation, public finance, population growth, and
 emigration are not brought under control in the brief time-span of the
 next fifteen years, Mexico will-plunge into a prolonged period of chaos,
 with incalculable consequences for American economic and political interests.
 South. America
 The outcome of measures to manage, the foreign debts of Venezuela,
 Argentina, and Brazil will largely determine whether these countries will

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/04/04 :CIA-RDP92B00181 8000300260018-1
 be able to avert dangerous political crises in the next two decades.  Debt
 service obligations will absorb large proportions of export earnings well
 into the 199Us, and most of these countries will be unable simultaneously
 to service debts and provide the high level of domestic growth necessary to
 a
 ensure political stability.
 A trend toward protectionism in the United States, Europe, and Japan
 will undermine. La tin America's capacity to service its restructured debts,
 and the recent restoration of civilian democratic government in the major
 states of South America will be placed in serious jeopardy if they lose
 their present access to markets in the major industrial nations.  Even
 with continued access to world markets, most of these countries will face
 growing indebtedness and population increases that will neutralize the
 effects of modest economic growth,.such as the 2.6 percent recorded last year.
 As long as Fidel Castro remains in power, he will prefer to rely on
 Moscow's annual $4 billion subsidy to support his pretensions as the great
 exemplar of a new order in Central America and the Caribbean rather than.
 undertake a serious exploration of prospects for an accommodation with the
 United States.  Castro's dependence on the Soviet Union, however, will pre-
 clude any high-risk ventures to promote his grandiose ambitions in Latin
 America.  The Soviets will not allow him to jeopardize their global geo-
 political imperatives and, in particular, their interest in avoiding con-
 frontations with the  U.S. in the Western Hemisphere that might destroy
 the opt-ion of collaboration with Washington in the late 1990s in dealing
 with challenges from West Germany and China.
 Castrola demise will precipitate a succession contest that will faction-
 alize the regime and undermine its stability and authority.  The Soviets will
 use their leverage to ensure that compliant clients prevail.  In the un-
 likely but conceivable event that reliable pro-Soviet successors fail to
 impose control, an opening would eventually develop for !lexico, other Latin
 American states, Spain and France to strengthen their influence in Cuba at

 the expense of the Soviet Union.  In the longer-term future, Soviet-Cuban
 frictions over divergent foreign policy and economic interests will grow,
 and the time may come in the first decade of the next century when Moscow
 wi21 be ready to strike a deal with the United States that would involve a
 retrenchment, if note liquidation, of the Soviet stake in Cuba.  The re-
 quirements of protecting Soviet security in a multipolar world, especially
 against emerging German and Chinese ambitions, will bring about significant
 changes in the attitudes and policies that characterized Moscow's conduct
 in the bipolar era.  These changes will open prospects for trade-offs in
 superpower bargaining that the Soviets would never have contemplated in
 the past.
 Southern Africa
 Bishop Desmond Tutu was not exaggerating when he warned last fall that
 South Africa has already entered "low-intensity civil war."  The rapidly
 growing political consciousness of t:ie 23-million black majority, spear-
 headed by organized black labor, will lead inexorably in the next five
 years to a series of confrontations of increasing scope and violence with
 the dominant Afrikaners.  Neither the ruling National Party nor its rival,
 the breakaway Conservative Party, will command the political resources and
 leadership necessary to manage evolutionary change that would avert large-
 scale~violence.  Afrikaner leaders, even if they were disposed to seek a
 political compromise along the lines of the Rhodesia settlement, will not
 have sufficient time or maneuver room to pursue .this alternative.
 A widespread breakdown in public order will occur in the next few
 years if the government attempts to carry out its policy to move all blacks
 into the "national homelands."  (11 million are still outside)  Even if
 the government were to suspend this policy, escalating black demonstrations
 and draconian repression by white security forces will increasingly divide
 the white leadership elite and population, and this will further erode the
 government's capacity to manage a partial retreat from unyielding Apartheid.
 The spectacle of mass uprisings on~-the part of the black majority will

 compel the governments of neighboring front-line countries to provide
 growing financial, political, and military assistance and oblige them to
 deepen reliance on aid and support from the Soviet Union end Cuba.  This
 kind of involvement in the struggle in South Africa will provoke Afrikaner
 military and economic retaliation, including denial of vital transportation
 facilities through South African territory. The Namibian and Angolan
 problems will inevitably become embroiled in this chain of actions and
 reprisals, and South Africa will unilaterally grant independence to
 Namibia after installing a compliant government in Windhoek.  This will
 destroy all remaining chances of a regional settlement and prompt Angola
 and front-line states to expand assistance to a drive by SWAPO forces to
 overturn Pretoria's unilateral action.
 In the late 1980s, after several years of inconclusive civil war, a
 new Afrikaner leadership, including senior military officers, will replace
 the National Party government and, with Western or United Nations mediation,
 arrange a aeries of truces with black organizations.  This process will
 eventually result in a de facto partition of the country, with the white
 population relocated into scattered and shrinking enclaves.  Civil war
 will inflict enormous economic damage and precipitate a mass exodus of
 whites and capital
 Conclusions
 The United States in the year 2000 will command a superior geopolitical
 position and immense advantages over its principal competitors as the multi-
 polar era unfolds.  The resources available to the Soviet Union and China
 will be no match for the formidable assets that have accrued from forty
 years of close relationships with Western Europe and Japan and from the
 U.S. role as the hub of the international economic system.  The only way
 Moscow oz Beijing could undermine this commanding position would be to
 draw Western Europe and Japan away from the American-led majority coalition
 into a new majority under their leadership.
 In order to maintain this privileged position,-however, American foreign
 and security policies will have to adjust to a very different international
 distribution of power than that which prevailed during the first twenty-
 five years after World War II in which basic political and strategic
 assumptions were formed.  The int~rnatinnal  gars t- ..   _. eta __:_~

 multipolar system.  The new configuration will be more difficult to manage
 and potentially more susceptible to surprise and loss of control because
 threats to the equilibrium will be more ambiguous than they have been in
 the bipolar world.
 On the other hand, a pentagonal balance in which the two superpowers
 are flanked on one aide by a China end a Japan capable of maneuvering between
 them and, on the other, by Western Europe acting as an East-West broker
 will have the potential of being a more durable configuration.  This
 system, moreover, will provide a vital margin of time to temper the
 Soviet Union's traditional ambition to overturn what it has long viewed as
 an unsatisfactory international status quo and to protect the global equilibrium
 from the disruptive influence of an expansionist China.  There would then
 be at least a theoretical chance in the second quarter of the next century
 to move toward a genuinely global international political and economic
 system.
 In the mid-1990s and beyond, the single most volatile potential for
 a U.S.-Soviet military confrontation will reside in resurgent German
 nationalism and a quest for reunification and primacy in Central Europe.
 Both superpowers will be under enormous pressures to support and protect
 their respective German allies.  West German efforts to penetrate and subvert
 the East German regime could propel the United States and the Soviet Union
 into an explosive game of "chicken" in which neither could risk a retreat
 without incurring unacceptable damage to its global position.
 This potential flashpoint underscores the emerging reality that the
 United States in a multipolar age will no longer be free to identify its
 national interests and security with the routine management of its alliance
 systems, or to assume that there can be no fundamental conflicts between
 American interests and those of Germany and Japan.  Central Europe, and to
 a lesser degree, the East Asian periphery of an ascendant China will be
 the main focal points of conflicts of interest that will be particularly
 susceptible to loss of control and to maneuvers by West Germany or Japan
 to play the United States off against the USSR or China.  The greatest
 danger in a multipolar world will not be a deliberate initiation of war
 but rather a heedless drift into an irrepressible conflict.
