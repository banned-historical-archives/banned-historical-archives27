China's New Westernized 
F-8 Fighter: US Role 
and Implications for 
Regional Air Balance 
25X1 
China's military leaders have recognized for some time that their lack of a 
modern all-weather, day/night fighter-interceptor has left China without 
an effective deterrent to the increasingly sophisticated Soviet air forces in 
the Far East. In an attempt to meet this Soviet air challenge?or at least 
not fall too much further behind over the next decade?Beijing has decided 
me F-8 Finback fighter, 
The Chinese plan to convert this 1960s-
vintage daytime fighter into a modern, long-range, high- and low-altitude 
interceptor, designated the F-8-2. Two versions of the F-8-2 are under 
development, one with advanced Western technology and the other with 
domestically built radars, missiles, and engines: 
? For the Western version, China on 30 October 1986 signed a Foreign 
Military Sales (FMS) purchase agreement for a US-integrated avionics 
system and has signed a tentative contract?pending COCOM approv-
al?for an Italian radar-guided, air-to-air missile, the Aspide. The 
Chinese have also expressed interest in US- or Israeli-produced engines. 
? The domestic F-8-2 may eventually carry a new Chinese radar

25X1 
25X1 
By the mid-1990s, Beijing should have at least 50 F-8-2 long-range 
interceptors far superior to anything in its present inventory. The all-
weather "Westernized F-8-2," for example, will be able to distinguish low-
flying bombers from ground clutter and destroy these targets, and should 
be able to destroy aircraft coming head-on up to 46 kilometers away. 
Current Chinese aircraft, by contrast, have a maximum missile-firing 
range of only 15 kilometers, can engage targets only from behind, and are 
limited to clear weather. 25X1 
The F-8-2 also will have the potential to operate as a multimission fighter 
with credible ground attack/strike capability. By relatively simple modifi-
cations to the US fire-control system and the fitting of a laser designator, 
the F-8-2 could be armed with antiradiation missiles to destroy defending 
ground radars, incapacitating surface-to-air missile batteries.

We judge that the F-8-2 is more likely to affect the air balance between 
China and Vietnam than that between China and the Soviet Union or 
Taiwan: 
? US avionics and Aspide missiles would make the fighter superior to the 
Soviet MIG-23 Flogger. But the F-8-2 will be no match for the advanced 
MIG-29s and SU-27s that will become the mainstays of Soviet airpower 
in the Far East by the time F-8-2s are deployed in numbers in the 1990s. 
? We believe Beijing already has the ability to gain command of the air 
over Taiwan because its Air Force greatly outnumbers Taiwan's. The 
F-8-2s would erode the qualitative advantage of Taiwan's F-5E fighters, 
but Taipei's planned Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) would offset 
many of these gains. 
? Vietnam in the mid-1990s might face a force of Chinese F-8-2s that are 
more advanced than its own fighters and a Chinese Air Force more 
prepared than today's for deep strikes into Vietnam. The shape of the 
Sino-Vietnamese air balance, therefore, is likely to depend heavily on the 
Soviet Union's willingness to provide Hanoi with a more modern fighter 
than its current MIG-21s and with more sophisticated ground-based air 
defense systems. 
Although the Chinese have signed a letter of agreement for the US 
avionics package, we believe tough negotiations lie ahead. The Chinese, in 
our judgment, will again press for the transfer of technology in addition to 
the purchase of 55 radar packages. They also will seek the production 
technology for the avionics and missiles necessary for an air-to-ground-
attack capability. 
The technology transfer issue notwithstanding, Beijing is pleased with the 
avionics program, but is concerned that Washington might use the F-8 
program to justify new arms sales to Taiwan. Taipei, for its part, will 
almost certainly push more vigorously for the Patriot air defense system, 
advanced air-to-air missiles, and F-16 or F-20 fighters.

We believe the sale of the avionics packages to Beijing will serve as a model 
for future FMS sales, such as a Mark 46 torpedo coproduction agreement, 
and will increase US influence with the Chinese military. Indeed, Military 
Commission Chairman Deng Xiaoping has already signaled Beijing's 
interest in an even wider arms technology relationship by asking about the 
possibility of US military credits or commercial assistance for weapon 
purchases during Secretary Weinberger's visit to Beijing in October 1986. 
Moreover, the United States will gain its first real access to China's 
defense plants and operational air units through the Defense Department 
officials and contractors on hand to install the avionics packages and 
provide maintenance training.

China's New Westernized 
F-8 Fighter: US Role 
and Implications for 
Regional Air Balance 
F-8-1: A Problem Aircraft 
Beijing's attempts over the past three decades to build 
a twin-engined, high-altitude, high-speed intercep-
tor?without foreign assistance?have largely failed. 
The Chinese began work on the F-8 Finback, which is 
similar to the 1961 Flipper?a Mikoyan design that 
Moscow never put into production?in the mid-1960s 
soon after the Sino-Soviet split. The first F-8 
in the early 
1970s, but even at that time-
China's senior leaders were skeptical that the aircraft 
industry was capable of building a modern fighter. 
In fact, unsatisfactory performance prevented even 
the prototype of this aircraft from entering service 
with the Chinese Air Force until 1982, almost two 
decades after the project began. The Chinese have 
produced only 73 of the F-8-1 aircraft at the Shen-
yang aircraft plant  
We believe these were only 
intended to familiarize the Air Force and Naval Air 
Force with the aircraft

which is based on the Soviet-designed R11F engine

first 300 hours of operation and discarded after 
another 300 hours,

markedly underpowered compared with the latest

short-range PL-2 infrared-guided air-to-air missile, 
which can only be fired from behind the enemy 
aircraft at ranges less than 7 kilometers in clear 
weather. 
If the Chinese are to develop a credible air defense 
against the Soviet bomber force, Beijing needs all-
weather, day/night fighter-interceptors with look-
down/shootdown capability. But China's air defense 
inventory is largely composed of F-5 (MIG-17) Fres-

is simply another clear-weather fighter in which the 
pilot must acquire targets visually. The deployment of 
radars with terrain-clearance features 2 gives today's

Revamping the F-8 
The Chinese, recognizing that the utility of the F-8 in 
its present configuration is low, are on a two-tracked 
course of domestic and foreign upgrades to make the 
F-8 an all-weather, day/night interceptor. To allow 
the fitting of the larger, more sophisticated air-
intercept radars?crucial to lookdown/shootdown ca-

ing negotiates for Western add-ons and designs new 
indigenous components. 
Seeking Foreign Assistance 
Cognizant that its defense industries were sorely 
deficient, the Chinese Air Force in early 1984 sought 
US assistance, primarily to improve the avionics on 
the F-8. After extended negotiations, the Chinese on 
30 October 1986 signed a contract for 55 US integrat-
ed avionics system kits-50 for installation in the 
F-8-2s and five for spare parts?for approximately 
$500 million under a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) 
agreement. Under the proposed terms, the US avion-
ics package will provide the Chinese markedly en-
hanced capabilities: 
? The US pulsed Doppler radar will enable the F-8-2 
to detect a target up to 65 kilometers away and 
track it up to 46 kilometers away?doubling the 
capabilities of China's best current radar, the Type 
204. 
? The radar also will give the Chinese their first all-
aspect attack capability against low-flying targets. 
The radar in its lookdown mode can differentiate 
targets from ground clutter 37 kilometers away. 
? And the head-up display, fire-control computer, and 
inertial navigation system are all new capabilities 
not found on the F-8-1. 
If installation of the avionics packages goes as sched-
uled, the first F-8-2s with the US upgrade should be 
ready to fly in the early 1990s. 
The other critical improvement Beijing is seeking 
from the West is a beyond-visual-range air-to-air

seven missiles for compatibility testing, outright pur-
chase of 1,500 more missiles, and eventual acquisition 
of production technology. 
China, however, is still 
Secret 
awaiting approval of the purchase by the Coordinat-
ing Committee for Multilateral Export Controls 
(COCOM). Japan has not cast its vote on the pur-
chase, citing fears that China could gain a power 
projection capability with the acquisition of beyond-
visual-range missiles. 
The Aspide is a potent all-aspect, all-weather missile 
capable of destroying aircraft flying at high altitude 
or at very low altitude. Essentially an Italian version 
of the US-built AIM-7M Sparrow, Aspide provides a 
maximum head-on range of 57 kilometers and if 
mated to the US radar would be able to hit targets up 
to 46 kilometers away. China's infrared- and radar-
guided missiles are estimated to have ranges up to 15 
kilometers. They are, therefore, limited to close-in 
combat engagements, where the F-8's lack of maneu-
verability?compared with current state-of-the-art 
fighters?makes it extremely vulnerable to the most 
modern Soviet fighters.' 
To power the F-8-2, China has expressed interest in 
the GE-404 engine. An F-8 using the GE-404 would 
have a significantly higher thrust-to-weight (T/W) 
ratio than an F-8 with WP-7A engines-1.2 for the 
GE-404 versus 1.0 for the WP-7A. The increased 
T/W would give the aircraft greater sustained turn 
performance, an improved rate of climb, and better 
acceleration?all valuable in air combat maneuver-
ing. China initiated discussions two years ago with 
General Electric officials,

The Chinese will probably arm the F-8-2 with short-range Israeli

nated the PL-8 in China?has a 15-kilometer range and has 
performance characteristics similar to those of the US AIM-9L

F-7M airframes with GE-404 engine mounts?will 
lead to a relaxation of US control on the technology. 
Alternately, Beijing may believe, on the basis of its 
close military ties, that Islamabad will illicitly pass 
the GE-404 to China as it has done with French 
antiship and air-to-air missiles. 
China has also looked at the Pratt & Whitney 1117, a 
lower thrust derivative of the F-100, and the Israeli-
produced J79-GE-17 to power the F-8-2. For reasons 
of power and compatibility, however, we believe the 
GE-404 is Beijing's first choice. The GE-404 is lighter 
and, although its smaller size would necessitate some 
modifications to the inlet and nozzle ducts on the 
aircraft, it would fit better in the F-8-2 airframe than 
either the PW-1117 or J79-GE-17 engine. Moreover, 
the fuel consumption of the GE-404 is significantly 
lower than that of the older J79. Although the J79 
engine has performed well on the Kfir fighter and 
Israel has become an important source of military 
equipment for China in recent years, Beijing would 
probably prefer the newer GE-404 engine. 
The Domestic Upgrades 
Although Beijing appears committed to US and Ital-
ian upgrades to the F-8 aircraft, the Chinese have by 
no means given up on indigenous programs to improve 
the fighter. The proposed US sale of avionics pack-
ages contains no provision for China's acquisition of 
the production technology. Thus, Beijing is faced with 
the prospect of continuing to buy the expensive radars 
outright or develop a pulsed Doppler radar of its own. 
According to a brochure acquired at the Farnborough 
Air Show in early September and published by 
China's aircraft industry, China has developed a new 
radar, designated the JL-7, which is fairly sophisti-
cated. Although probably lacking a lookdown/shoot-
down capability, the radar reportedly can detect a 
target 29 kilometers away and track it up to 16 
kilometers away. 
The Chinese could use this radar with the Aspide 
missile, giving them a beyond-visual-range capability 
on the "non-Americanized" F-8-2s, but only if the 
missile was modified to operate on the radar's fre-
quency. 
Secret 
China may also choose to power at least some of its 
F-8-2s with WP-13 engines, 
The WP-13, however, is essential-
ly Soviet technology of the 1960s. 
Why Modernize the F-8? 
Despite its flaws, the F-8 fighter interceptor is Bei-
jing's only option if it wishes to deploy an indigenous 
fighter with an all-weather capability, beyond-visual-
range missiles, and a lookdown/shootdown capability

Secret 
Why Is China Not Buying a Foreign Fighter? 
Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang publicly stated 
in August 1982 that China was ready to buy and 
coproduce French Mirage fighters, but no contract  
was signed. 
We believe that, because an imminent threat is not 
perceived, and because of national pride and cost, 
Chinese purchase of a foreign fighter such as the 
Mirage 2000 is unlikely. A widely publicized Mili-
tary Commission meeting in May 1985 codified the 
strategic judgment that China has a "window of 
security" until the end of this century to revamp its 
military forces before a major Soviet invasion is even 
a possibility. Moreover, Beijing's stated goal is self-
sufficiency in weapons development and production, 
and the Chinese are wary, once again, of depending on 
a foreign country?as they did with the Soviets in the 
1950s?for defense modernization. In addition, Bei-
jing holds insufficient foreign exchange to finance the 
bulk purchase of aircraft and prefers either limited 
imports or technological cooperation to enhance its 
indigenous systems. 
Moreover, the F-8-2 has the potential to operate not 
only as a fighter-interceptor, but also as a multimis-
sion fighter with significant ground attack/strike 
capability. The proposed US radar has a ground-
mapping mode, allowing for imprecise navigation and 
target recognition?with a third of the resolution 
available with state-of-the-art US radars?and an air-
to-ground ranging mode that will provide range infor-
mation for weapon launches. With relatively simple 
modifications to the US fire-control system and the 
addition of a laser designator for target illumination, 
the Chinese F-8-2 could, for example, be armed with

The Sino-Soviet Border 
When Beijing begins fielding F-8-2s in the early 
1990s, the Chinese Air Force will have its first 
credible capability to interdict Soviet medium and 
light bombers attacking China. Soviet TU-16 Badger 
and TU-22M Backfire medium bombers, as well as 
SU-24 Fencer light bombers, already are deployed in 
East Asia. We expect that by the early 1990s the

Soviets will also deploy in East Asia TU-160 Black-
jack bombers, capable of carrying nuclear-armed 
long-range cruise missiles. 
The F-8-2s, however, will not substantially alter the 
overall air balance because the Soviet Union will 
maintain its marked qualitative edge in fighter air-
craft by deploying more of its new fourth-generation 
fighters?MIG-31 Foxhound, SU-27 Flanker, and 
MIG-29 Fulcrum?in East Asia. An F-8-2 equipped 
with US avionics and a beyond-visual-range missile 
like the Aspide surpasses the performance capabilities 
of the Soviet second-generation MIG-21 Fishbed and 
approaches those of the third-generation MIG-23

for the Foxhound?in East Asia since 1983?and the 
Flanker?initially deployed to East Asia in 1985?or 
the Fulcrum?expected in East Asia in the 1990s. 
The Chinese fighter's avionics will not give it the 
multiple-target or track-while-scan capabilities that 
the Soviets are developing for their advanced aircraft. 
With a multiple-target capability, the Soviets would 
be able to track more than one enemy aircraft at a 
time. The Flanker and Fulcrum fighters will also be 
far more maneuverable than the F-8-2. We believe,

therefore, that Beijing must field large numbers of F-
8-2s?as well as modern ground-based air defenses?
just to keep pace with the Soviet threat of the 1990s.4 
The Taiwan Strait Balance 
We believe Beijing already can gain command of the 
air over Taiwan because its Air Force greatly out-
numbers Taiwan's. But China would take heavy, 
probably exorbitant, losses primarily from Taiwan's 
ground-based air defenses. China has about 5,100 
11 
311092 12-86 
fighter aircraft compared with only some 320 fighter 
aircraft for Taiwan. F-8-2s will still be highly vulner-
able to surface-to-air missiles. But, if equipped with 
effective antiradiation missiles and TASMs as well as 
air-to-air missiles, they could greatly reduce the num-
ber of Chinese aircraft lost to Taiwan's ground-based 
air defense systems.' 
'Another option for reducing Chinese losses over Taiwan would be 
to equip A-5 ground-attack aircraft with ARMATs and TASMs to 
erode Taiwan's surface-to-air missile-firing capability.

Secret 
In aerial combat, today's F-8-1 is not a match for 
Taiwan's F-5E Tiger II fighter, but the proposed 
improvements to the F-8-2 would erode the F-5E's 
qualitative edge. The F-5E's air-to-air combat capa-
bility exceeds that of the F-8-1 because Taiwan's 
fighter has a search-and-track radar and a better air-
to-air missile. The F-8-2, however, is likely to be more 
maneuverable and have beyond-visual-range missiles 
that allow the F-8-2 to fire before the F-5E acquires 
the F-8 on its radar. Even if only armed with PL-8 
(Israeli Python 3) missiles, the F-8-2 would have an 
all-aspect attack capability not found on today's F-5E 
fighter. Better engines?such as the GE-404  
?on the F-8-2 would also improve 
Secret 
China's capabilities in air operations against Taiwan, 
giving the aircraft a combination of greater payload 
and longer range. In addition, the longer engine life 
for the F-8-2 engines will greatly reduce the aircraft 
maintenance problems China experienced during its 
1979 war with Vietnam. 
Taiwan's planned development and deployment of its 
Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) will offset many of 
the advantages Beijing could gain from the F-8-2. 
Taipei plans to equip the IDF with AIM-7F Sparrow 
beyond-visual-range missiles and AIM-9L Sidewinder 
all-aspect infrared-guided missiles, although Wash-
ington has not yet approved the plan. This equipment

would make the IDF more than a match for the 
F-8-2, with its shorter, radar-limited missile range. 
 Powered by two engines based on the Garrett 
TFE731-2L, the IDF will be similar in capability to a 
US F-20 Tigershark. The fighter's proposed APG-67 
radar will give the IDF lookup/lookdown capability, 
air-to-ground ranging, distinction of targets in ground 
clutter, and the option to add track-while-scan and  
surface moving-target track capabilities. 
Implications for Vietnam 
Fielding of F-8-2s may have its greatest impact along 
the China-Vietnam border, although airpower has not 
been a factor in Sino-Vietnamese hostilities. The 
Soviet Union has not provided Vietnam with any 
fighters more advanced than the MIG-21 Fishbed, 
but China's deployment of F-8-2s will substantially 
strengthen Vietnam's hand in requesting MIG-23 
Floggers. the 
Soviets have denied Hanoi's requests on the grounds 
that the MIG-21 is at least as capable as any Chinese 
fighter in service. Vietnam in the mid-1990s might 
face a force of Chinese F-8-2s that are more advanced 
than its own fighters and, if these fighters are 
equipped for strike missions, a Chinese Air Force far 
more prepared than today's for deep strikes into 
Vietnam. The shape of the Sino-Vietnamese air bal-
ance, therefore, is likely to be determined by the 
Soviet Union's willingness to provide Hanoi with more 
modern fighter aircraft and ground-based air defense 
systems. 
A New Entry in China's Arms Export Catalogue 
China is aggressively exporting arms to the Third 
World?with sales of over $9 billion since 1980?and 
has added the F-8-2 to its list of aircraft for export. At 
the Farnborough Air Show, China's aircraft industry 
displayed a model of the F-8-2 and distributed bro-
chures extolling the performance capabilities of the 
fighter in air combat, battlefield interdiction, and 
close air support missions. China hopes to find a 
market for its indigenous F-8-2?not the aircraft with 
US upgrades?which we estimate may be ready for 
export as early as late 1987. 
13 
Secret 
Beijing is likely to initially sell the F-8-2 to customers 
who have previously purchased Chinese aircraft, such 
as Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe,  
Tanzania, and Sudan. 
rklthough the F-8-2 may not be a 
modern fighter, its estimated price of less than $10 
million will make it attractive to Third World coun-
tries that have come to view China as a reliable and 
discreet supplier of inexpensive and easily operated 
arms. 
Implications for the United States 
Beijing has high expectations for the F-8 moderniza-
tion program and the role the United States will play. 
Because this is the first major FMS case, the Chinese 
are bound to push the limits of the Foreign Military 
Sales agreement to set precedents for future arms 
sales. According to a US Defense Department offi-
cial, the Chinese have tried?in violation of the FMS 
accord?to persuade the US negotiators to let them 
select the contractor who will provide the F-8-2 
avionics packages. The Chinese are unlikely to be 
satisfied with the purchase of 55 radar packages and 
will want Washington to eventually provide produc-
tion technology. In addition, we expect Beijing to seek 
the avionics and missiles necessary for an air-to-
ground attack capability and active electronic coun-
termeasure equipment to better defend the aircraft. If 
the Chinese cannot acquire this technology from the 
United States, they will certainly turn to other West-
ern countries, such as France, Italy, or Israel. 
Beijing appears pleased with US efforts to supply the 
F-8 improvements and probably views them as a 
signal that the United States is willing?at least to a 
limited extent?to upgrade China's military capabili-
ty despite its possible detrimental impact on Taiwan's 
defenses. In our judgment, though, Beijing is con-
cerned that the anticipated F-8 program will be used 
in Washington to justify new arms programs for 
Taiwan. Successful modernization of the F-8 with US 
assistance probably will lead Taiwan to pressure the

United States to at least match the technology provid-
ed to China. We believe that if Washington decides to 
further aid F-8-2 development by providing engines or 
upgrading the avionics packages, improving its air-to-
ground capability, Taipei probably will press more 
vigorously for: 
? Better ground-based air defense systems, such as 
the Patriot. 
? The AIM-7F Sparrow beyond-visual-range radar-
guided missile for the IDF. 
? The AIM-9L Sidewinder all-aspect infrared-guided 
missile for the IDF and F-5E. 
? F-16 or F-20 fighters. 
We believe the successful conclusion of the F-8 
avionics sale signals the beginning of long-term ties to 
Chinese defense industries that are likely to increase 
Washington's influence with the Chinese military. 
Today, US-Chinese military ties are limited to occa-
sional senior- and training-level exchanges, but instal-
lation of the avionics packages and maintenance 
training will necessitate the presence of US Defense 
Department officials and contractors at Chinese de-
fense plants for at least the next 10 years. If the 
Chinese are pleased with the results of the F-8-2 
avionics upgrade, we expect future FMS sales of 
items such as the Mark 46 torpedo, currently under 
negotiation with a contract expected next spring. 
Deng Xiaoping, moreover, signaled Beijing's interest 
in a wider arms technology relationship when he 
raised the possibility of US military credits or com-
mercial assistance for weapon purchases with Secre-
tary of Defense Weinberger  during his October 1986 
trip to China.
