 The military governor of Tehran announced Last night
 that all Iranian airports will be closed until Sunday.
 The decision to close the airports indicates that nego-
 tiations between the military and the oppo-i*-.on have
 broken down.                                  25X1        25X1

 Movement of Iran leader Mehdi Bazargan earlier this week
 to discuss Ayatollah Khomeini's return.   The confusion
 yesterday over whether the airport in Tehran would be
 opened probably indicates that further negotiations were
 tinues to insist that he will try to go to Iran on Friday.

 Khomeini into accepting some power-sharing arrangement
 before he returns to the country.   It is unlikely that
 Khomeini will change his position,  and his entourage con-

 If the military and Bakhtiar decide to stick by
 their decision and prevent Khomeini's return, we expect
 the opposition to respond with more demonstrations and
 strikes to force the government's downfall.   Large demon-
 strations had already been planned for Friday to cele-
 brate Khomeini's homecoming.                                 25X1
 Bakhtiar continues to insist that he will not turn
 power over to Khomeini.   The closure of the airports is
 likely to identify the Prime Minister further with the
 military and the Shah and reduce what little popular ap-
 peal Bakhtiar has. F     __1                         25X1

 Bakhtiar's efforts
 to organize progovernment demonstrations have so far met
 with little success.   Fewer than 5,000 demonstrators
 turned out for a progovernment march yesterday.

 Chinese officials are talking in tougher and more
 uniform terms about the prospects for a  "swift and major"
 e along the Vietnam-China border.
 In comments apparently designed to reach the US   25X1
 that appear to reflect recent guidance, one official
 noted that such a strike would assist in deterring Viet-
 nam from extending its influence to other neighboring
 countries and might ease Vietnamese pressure on Pol Pot's
 forces in Kampuchea.   The same official had previously
 described Chinese military activity along the Vietnamese
 border as purely defensive and had said that China was
 restrained by the possibility of Soviet retaliation.
 Another official suggested that Vice Premier Deng
 Xiaoping  (Teng Hsiao-ping)  plans to explain China's
 strong "resolve" concerning the border situation during
 his coming talks in Washington.                                25X1
 Despite this sterner approach,  the officials con-
 tinue to link China's actions with Vietnam's "encroach-
 ments" on Chinese territory.   Thus,                                  the Chinese are con-
 tinuing to develop a rationale for a border strike while
 maintaining the option to take action at a time and place
 of their choosing.                                              25X1
 The Chinese officials acknowledge the potential
 costs involved in an escalation of China's conflict with
 Vietnam, including political damage in Southeast Asia and
 delay of China's domestic modernization plans.   The offi-
 cials implied that China can keep these costs at manage-
 More important, the Chinese officials appear to be
 minimizing the possibility that the USSR would react with
 force to any Chinese strike against Vietnam.   The offi-
 cials asserted that China believes the USSR would not
 retaliate against China in such an event.

 BRIEFS AND COMMENTS
 WEST GERMANY:   The Disarmament Issue
 Chancellor Schmidt's Social Democratic Party will
 face a defense policy debate in the Bundestag within a
 few weeks, and it has not yet reached agreement on the
 priority to accord disarmament.   AZZ West German parties
 place high priority on national security,  so the internal
 debate will not weaken Bonn's adherence to the Western  25X1
 alliance.   Yet key party advocates of disarmament hold
 views not fully consistent with Schmidt's policy,  and
 press now seems to be magnifying this difference.
 Leading the disarmament advocates are party Chairman
 Willy Brandt and parliamentary leader Herbert Wehner,
 whose public statement on the coming debate is being in-
 terpreted as giving higher priority to disarmament than
 to accepting weapons to offset Soviet theater nuclear
 forces. In fact,  the relevant comment by Wehner is aimed
 at the opposition and is not a clear policy declaration.
 25X1
 Wehner is also playing up Schmidt's concern that
 West Germany not be the only West European country to
 upgrade nuclear-capable forces as a counter to the Soviet
 medium-range threat.   Wehner quotes selectively from the
 Chancellor's public statements,  furthermore, to indicate
 that the "gap" between NATO and Warsaw Pact military
 forces might be acceptable because the overall strategic
 balance can incorporate certain military imbalances.   At
 Guadeloupe, however, Schmidt a reed that the allies must
 deal with this gap.                                    25X1
 Schmidt, who must take account of the prominent dis-
 armament advocates to ensure party harmony, has entrusted
 Defense Minister Apel with a policy review,  in effect a
 search for a concept that makes progress in disarmament
 a central objective.   Apel will probably recommend a
 policy that emphasizes disarmament and force limitations--
 such as MBFR--as one road to parity but clearly main-     25X1
 tains the option to improve NATO forces if the Soviets
 continue to be evasive on theater balance.

 YUGOSLAVIA:   Continuing Rivalries
 tive forums at that level as well.
 he is playing to a reported wave of unhappiness in the
 regional parties over Tito's order to introduce collec-
 personal rivalries in the  Lead-
 ership remain acute and aspects of the collective rule
 system introduced by President Tito Last October are in
 contention.   The main protagonists--Stane DoZanc,  secre-
 tary of the Presidium,  and Vladimir Bakaric,  the senior
 Croat in President Tito's inner circle--also differ on
 some basic policy issues.                                    25X1
 At the party congress in June, Tito tapped Dolanc
 to run the ruling Presidium,  thus strengthening Dolanc's
 succession claim by elevating him to first among equals.
 Bakaric led the opposition to Dolanc's effort to estab-
 lish himself as the preeminent candidate to succeed Tito
 in the party.   The conflict led Tito to introduce the
 collective leadership scheme in the Presidium and to
 argue for its adoption throughout the party.   Under the
 collective scheme, Tito appointed Branko Mikulic, an
 ally of Bakaric, to head the Presidium in a rotational
 position as chairman for one year.                        25X1
 Since the first of the year, Dolanc has made sev-
 eral speeches that emphasize a moderate approach to in-
 ternal political dissent and directly contravene
 Bakaric's position.   Dolanc's failure to refer publicly
 to the new collective leadership principle may well mean
 and counterbalanced against each other.
 While Tito is still in charge,  there is little
 chance of a decisive resolution of the test of wills
 between Bakaric and Dolanc.   Tito's ruling style is to
 keep his potential successors uncertain of their status

 ZAIRE:   Inter-African Force Withdrawal
 Zaire has informed the Moroccan commander of the
 Inter-African Force in Shaba Region that the Zairian
 Army will assume fuZZ responsibility for the security
 of Shaba in March and that the IAF should plan to with-
 draw soon thereafter.   The Moroccan contingent, which
 accounts for most of the 2,400-man force,  is awaiting
 specific instructions from Rabat;  the 600-man Senega-
 lese contingent tentatively plans to leave in mid-March.
 25X1
 President Mobutu's decision to have Zairian troops
 assume the responsibility of the IAF probably reflects
 his recognition that the threat to Shaba from rebels
 of the Congolese National Liberation Front has signi-
 ficantly lessened during the past six months.   He may
 also have been influenced by recent incidents between
 IAF and Zairian soldiers as well as by calls from
 countries represented in the IAF for an early disband-
 ment of the force.                                           25X1
 The Zairian Army probably will not be able to per-
 form its mission effectively for the foreseeable future,
 and the absence of the IAF probably will lead to a re-
 sumption of army depredations against the Shaban popula-
 tion.   France and Belgium each are training a Zairian
 brigade to take over eventually in Shaba, but the train-
 ing is months behind schedule and European military ad-
 visers are pessimistic about Zaire's long-range prospects
 for developing a competent security force.
 Fortunately for Mobutu, rebels now in Zambia        25X1
 and Angola are largely disorganized and lack significant
 foreign support, circumstances that make it unlikely
 they will be able to launch another major incursion in

 MALTA:   Aid
 Libya, France, and Italy so far have failed to    25X1
 formulate a joint response to Malta's demand for eco-
 nomic aid after the scheduled British military withdrawal
 on 31 March.   Meanwhile,  the USSR again has  indicated a
 strong desire to establish a presence in Malta.
 Italy,  in particular,  fears that continued lack of
 progress on a European aid package will encourage closer
 bilateral relations between Malta and Libya.     Maltese
 Prime Minister Mintoff claims to have concluded "defense
 arrangements" with Libya. There is no evidence to sup-
 port his claim--despite his frequent assertions that
 Libya is ready to come to his rescue.   The US Embassy
 in Valletta,  however,  believes that negotiations may be
 in progress.                                                25X1
 During a recent meeting with French and Italian of-
 ficials, Libyan officials reiterated their government's
 willingness to help Malta--through both project assist-
 ance and direct budgetary grants--and requested the Eu-
 ropeans to match this assistance.   French law, however,
 forbids giving cash aid,  and Italy can grant such aid
 only with parliamentary consent.                           25X1
 The Soviets hope to expand access to port facilities
 on the strategically located island, but Mintoff's
 demands,  including stringent controls on Soviet activity,
 have always been too high a price to pay.   Earlier this
 month, a Soviet delegation visited Malta to discuss
 bunkering rights for Soviet commercial ships and landing
 rights for Aeroflot aircraft as well as opening Malta
 to Soviet tourism, but the talks reportedly were incon-
 clusive.   Soviet access to Malta would be highly un-
 popular with the Maltese population and, a public setback
 to Mintoff's much touted neutrality policy.

 USSR:   Reaction to State of Union Message
 Initial Soviet media reaction to President Carter's
 State of the Union message mixes a largely straightfor-
 ward and positive account of his remarks on the impor-
 tance of US-Soviet cooperation and the necessity of SALT
 with familiar criticism of alleged US reliance on mili-
 tary force.   TASS carried a relatively upbeat summary of
 the President's comments about SALT--consistent with
 other recent optimistic Soviet public assessments--but
 criticized his statement that he would not sign an agree-

 INDIA:   Janata Party Unity
 The appointment yesterday of former Home Minister
 Charan Singh as finance minister and deputy prime
 minister--a newly created post--reduces the threat of
 a split in the ruling Janata Party.   Singh's open cri-
 ticism of.Prime Minister Desai's leadership had resulted
 in his ouster from the cabinet last June.   Desai may
 have secured Singh's agreement to return to the cabinet
 by assuring him that the government will move ahead with
 plans to prosecute former Prime Minister Gandhi for ex-
 cesses during her emergency rule.  Singh had been highly
 critical of Desai's cautious approach toward Gandhi.
 PALESTINIANS:   Council Adjournment
 The Palestine National Council, unable to decide
 on a formula for expanding radical representation on the
 Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation orga-
 nization,  adjourned yesterday without naming new leaders.
 The present Executive Committee, dominated by moderates,
 will remain in office, but radicals may again raise
 their demands for increased representation once the PLO's
 investigation of the assassination on Monday of a key
 Fatah official is completed.   The assassination dis-
 rupted thelCouncil's deliberations, and radical demands
 for a greater voice in the organization's finances and
 military apparently were never fully considered.
 A Vatican spokesman announced yesterday that the
 Holy See has agreed to mediate the Beagle Channel dis-
 pute between Argentina and Chile that last month nearly
 led to armed hostilities.   No venue has been selected,
 and a mediator is yet to be named.   Antonio Cardinal
 Samore, whose shuttle diplomacy paved the way for Vati-
 can mediation, appears to be the most likely candidate.

 POLAND:   Defense Spending
 The official Polish budget for 1979 shows an in-
 crease in defense expenditures of 5 percent over the
 1978 budget.   The budget for the armed forces probably
 will increase by 4.4 percent, with the remainder going
 for investments in defense industries.   This contradicts
 a Western press report earlier this month that indicated
 the Poles planned to increase defense spending in 1979
 by only 2.6 percent, slightly above Poland's current in-
 FRANCE:   Ballistic Missile Submarine Program
 The fifth French ballistic missile submarine will
 go on sea trials this spring.   Completion of a sixth
 unit, which was postponed in 1976, plus research and
 development on a new class of submarines, were authorized
 last fall by the National Assembly as part of the French
 program to upgrade naval and tactical nuclear forces.
 The sixth unit and the new class of ballistic missile
 submarine will be designed to accommodate the new, mul-
 tiple warhead M-4 missile, which is under development.
 The M-4 missile will provide a several-fold increase
 in French capabilities against Soviet targets.   France
 also plans to retrofit the M-4 into the other five sub-
 marines, which now carry 16 single-warhead missiles.
 When the sixth unit becomes operational in about 1986,
 France will be able for the first time to keep two
 ballistic missile submarines continuously on patrol.

 EUROPEAN MONETARY SYSTEM:   Dispute
 Implementation of the European Monetary System,
 originally scheduled for 1 January, remains stalled by
 a dispute over agricultural pricing policy.   Although
 active consultations are continuing and there are some
 signs of compromise between France and West Germany,
 there have been few indications of movement toward even
 an interim solution.   The UK has complicated the picture
 by calling for a fundamental reform of EC agricultural
 policy rather than the inflationary half-measures now in
 prospect.  Most of the potential compromises reported
 in the press would postpone any basic decisions and
 probably would include some increase in EC-wide farm
 prices.                                         25X1

 SYRIA-IRAQ:   A Temporary Alliance
 The three-month-old rapprochement between Syria
 and Iraq is the product of mutual concern over the
 Israeli-Egyptian peace process and the upheaval in Iran,
 as well as the narrow tactical considerations of each
 side.   Although a "unity" scheme between these two tra-
 ditional rivals may come soon,  it will be fragile and
 superficial.   Both governments are deeply suspicious
 of each other and have rival pretensions for leadership
 in the eastern Arab world.                               25X1
 Limited political, economic, and military coopera-
 tion between the two is nonetheless likely as long as
 their short-term objectives outweigh their permanent
 national ambitions.   Syrian President Assad and Iraqi
 President Bakr may announce agreement in principle to
 "unite" their two countries at a summit meeting in
 Damascus later this month.   Jordan and the Palestine
 Liberation Organization may be invited to the final
 session or to an immediate postsummit conclave to make
 more credible Syria's military threat on Israel's east-
 ern front.
 Ancient Rivals
 There is little chance of a real integration of
 the two countries.   Arab groups in Syria and Iraq have
 been rivals since the seventh century.   Their long-
 standing inability to agree on sharing waters of the
 Euphrates River,  for example, reflects their geopoliti-
 cal difficulties.                                               25X1
 Religious sectarianism also works against unity;
 a Sunni Muslim minority rules in Baghdad and an Alawite
 minority regime governs in Damascus.   Many Syrians,
 including Assad's influential brother Rifaat, oppose

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/09/08: CIA-RDP81T00368R000100010048-5
 a real rapprochement because they fear the Iraqis will
 support a bid for power by a Sunni or even a rival
 Alawite faction.                                           25X1
 Since Syria achieved independence in 1946,  its fore-
 most foreign policy concern has been to preserve national
 independence against threats from its neighbors.           Syria
 has supported the idea of Arab unity but largely as a
 matter of its Baath Party's pan-Arab ideology.     Iraq
 and Egypt have tried to exploit this tendency in order
 to dominate the Syrians.   Syria joined the United Arab
 Republic with Egypt in 1958,  signed a never-implemented
 federation agreement with Egypt and Iraq in 1963, and
 joined the Confederation of Arab Republics initiated by
 Egypt and Libya in 1971.   None stood the test of time.
 Prospects for Cooperation
 The Camp David accords and developments in Iran
 are the most important, but not the only, current
 sources of affinity between Syria and Iraq.   The
 Syrians are also attracted by Iraq's oil wealth and view
 Iraq's armed forces as a possible reserve that could
 enhance Syria's military credibility and its ability
 to obtain concessions from Israel in future negotiations.
 Iraq sees ties with Syria as the first step toward play-
 ing a stronger role in Arab affairs and toward minimiz-
 ing Soviet and domestic Communist influence in the
 region.   Iraq also is concerned about unrest spilling
 over from Iran.                                                  25X1
 The various joint committees created in the past
 two months to pave the way for unity apparently have
 made little progress in the key areas of party, mili-
 tary,  intelligence,  and security matters.   Both sides
 want Israel to feel increased military pressure and
 thus are likely to hammer out some arrangement for
 closer military coordination.   The possibilities include:
 -- The formation, at least on paper, of a
 joint military command.

 -- A token Iraqi military presence in Syria,
 possibly on the Golan Heights.
 -- Contingency planning for deployment of
 an Iraqi force to Syria.
 The economic results of the rapprochement to date
 have been mixed.   Transportation services have been
 resumed, restrictions on border crossing lifted, and
 new commercial and trade contracts signed.   Disagree-
 ment over distributing waters controlled by Syria through
 the Tabaqah Dam on the Euphrates River, however, may
 continue to block the reopening of the Iraq Petroleum
 Company pipeline that runs through Syria to the
 Mediterranean.                                             25X1
 Despite their congruent views toward Camp David,
 the two countries have made little apparent progress in
 the area of political cooperation.   The two international
 wings of the Baath Party could be reunited in a scheme
 to stress Arab solidarity at the coming summit meeting,
 but the depth of the personal antagonisms and ideologi-
 cal differences between the two sides would make such a
 move only cosmetic.   The national leaders of Iraq and
 Syria will, in any event, retain ultimate control of
 all political activity in their respective countries.

 South Korea - North Korea
 The US Embassy in Seoul reported yesterday that the
 South Korean Government apparently has decided to accept
 the first three conditions the North Koreans posed for a
 meeting of representatives of political parties and mass
 organizations.   The South Koreans will propose a meeting
 of governmental authorities by 1 February or earlier.
 The Embassy noted that the South Koreans have narrowly
 defined the North's condition concerning a cessation of
 military activities to mean a cessation of such activities
 along the Demilitarized Zone.   It pointed out that this
 position impinges on the authority of the commander of
 the UN Command.   The Embassy also commented that the
 South Korean timetable suggests that the government will
 only advise and not consult the US.
 The US Embassy in London reports that Prime Minister
 Callaghan,  faced with general labor unrest and required
 to submit a budget in April implementing the Labor Party's
 economic strategy, will probably call a general election
 sometime before mid-April.   The Embassy notes that in
 the meantime Callaghan must strive to avoid a confronta-
 tion with the unions and maintain the cohesion of his
 party, despite his diminished credibility and popularity.
