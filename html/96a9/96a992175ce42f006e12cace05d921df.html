 A WEEKLY
 No. 4                         JANUARY 24, 1951
 Leninism-Mankind's Banner of
 Emancipation
 T HE PEOPLES of the Soviet Union and
 hundreds of millions of working folk in all
 countries of the world have just commemorated
 the 27th anniversary of the death of Vladimir
 Ilyich Lenin, supreme genius of the human
 race. The grandeur and vitality of Lenin's
 cause stand out with particular force today, in
 the present state of international affairs. The
 major world events of these past years, as
 indeed the whole history of the first half of
 the twentieth century, demonstrate over and
 over again the invincible power of the im-
 mortal ideas of Lenin, leader and teacher of la-
 bouring humanity and founder of the Bolshevik
 Party and the Soviet State.
 A living and most vivid embodiment of the
 ideas of Leninism, which have been further de-
 veloped in the works of the genius who was
 Lenin's closest colleague and is the continuer
 of his cause, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin-is
 the state which they founded, the Union of
 Soviet Socialist Republics. The victory of the
 Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia
 ushered in a new era in world history.
 Lenin said as far back as January 1918 that
 in Soviet society "all the miracles of technol-
 ogy, all the achievements of culture, will be-
 come the property of the. whole people, and
 henceforth the mind and genius of man will
 never be converted into a means of coercion,
 into a means of exploitation." And this task set
 by Lenin has been fully accomplished: by the
 will and effort of the Party of Lenin and Stalin,
 the Soviet Union has become a mighty social-
 ist power, with a first-class socialist industry
 and a large-scale collective-farm and state-.farm
 agriculture; exploiting classes and all forms
 of exploitation of man by man have been abol-
 ished; unemployment and poverty have been
 eliminated for all time; the material welfare of
 the people is steadily and continuously rising,
 and the benefits of the foremost of all cultures,
 Soviet culture-its science, its literature, its
 art-have truly become the possession of all
 the people.
 The Party of Lenin and Stalin, successfully
 liberating the minds of the Soviet people from
 the selfishness, individualism, racial and na-
 tional enmity which cripple man's mentality
 under capitalism, has imbued our people with
 the new and noble sentiment of collectivism,
 the striving for peace and friendship with all
 nations.
 Under Lenin's banner, and led by Stalin, the
 Soviet people have built Socialism, and are
 successfully advancing to Communism, the
 contours of which can be clearly discerned in
 the majestic Stalin plans for the remaking of
 nature, which are already being implemented.
 That the Soviet social and political system, a
 system of peaceful constructive endeavour, is
 superior to the capitalist system of robbery,
 destruction and violence, is now obvious and
 incontestable to every honest-minded person in
 every country.
 Lenin's genius foresaw that "our Communist
 economic development will become a model
 for the future socialist Europe and Asia." This
 prediction is being realized before our eyes.
 The grand achievement of the Soviet Union
 in building a socialist society has already been
 taken as a model by the European People's
 Democracies-Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hun-
 gary, Rumania, Bulgaria and Albania, which
 were liberated from the chains of imperialism
 by the victory of the Soviet Union in the second
 world war, and which have firmly embarked on
 the road of socialist development. The ex-
 perience of the Soviet people is being broadly
 drawn upon and adapted to the conditions of
 their own historical development by the great
 Chinese people, who have emancipated them-
 selves from imperialist oppression and have
 begun to build a new life under the banner of

 Leninism.  The  historic victories  of So-
 cialism            in the        Soviet  Union    inspire the
 masses in all countries to fight for a brighter
 future, and they are rising against American
 imperialism-the most brutal and savage of
 all imperialisms-and its junior partners and
 servitors.
 The vilest and most bestial features of im-
 perialism have found their most complete and
 undisguised embodiment in American impe-
 rialism. More than thirty years ago Lenin
 pointed out that British and American impe-
 rialism were out for world domination. He
 said in November 1918:
 "We find England and America-coun-
 tries with greater potentialities of remaining
 democratic states than any-going to just
 such savage and insensate lengths as Ger-
 many before them, and they are therefore
 just as rapidly, if not more rapidly, ap-
 proaching the end which has so effectively
 been reached by German imperialism. The
 latter first swelled, spread over three-quar-
 ters of Europe, grew incredibly fat; then it
 burst, leaving a ghastly smell behind it. And
 that is the end for which British and Amer-
 ican imperialism are now heading."
 Pointing out that German imperialism had
 dug its own grave in 1918 when it tried to
 crush the revolutionary workers and peasants
 of Russia and the Ukraine, Lenin predicted
 that
 "all the more will British and American
 imperialism dig their own grave when they
 embark on a similar venture, which will lead
 to their political collapse-when they con-
 demn their troops to be the thugs and gen-
 darmes of all Europe."
 How timely these prophetic utterances of
 Lenin sound today, when American imperial-
 ism is openly laying claim to world supremacy
 and has already passed from preparation for
 aggression  to  outright acts of aggression.
 Today, when American shells and bombs have
 for already more than half a year been destroy-
 ing Korean towns and villages, when Amer-
 ican troops are slaying Korean women, chil-
 dren and old folk, when the United States and
 its satellites have launched into an incredible
 riot of militarism and reaction, and when the
 American imperialists have assumed the role
 of thugs and gendarmes of Europe and Asia
 --what a prophetic warning Lenin's words are
 of the inevitable collapse and certain doom of
 American imperialism.
 The myth of the almighty power of American
 imperialism has already been dispelled in the
 fields of Korea, where the courageous Korean
 people, heroically upholding their liberty and
 independence, have inflicted telling defeats on
 the American interventionists. There can be
 no doubt that the American intervention in
 Korea will end in complete fiasco.
 The masses the world over are resolutely
 combating the menace of a new world war,
 which the U.S. imperialists are trying to pre-
 cipitate. The front of peace is spreading and
 serrying its  ranks. The  protest  movement
 against the arming of Western Germany and
 Japan isa demonstration of the maturity of
 the forces of peace, and of their ability to
 bridle the aggressors.
 If the American imperialists so far lose their
 heads as to precipitate another world war, and
 venture to attack the Soviet Union, the Chinese
 People's Republic and the European People's
 Democracies, that war will end even more de-
 plorably for American imperialism than the
 second world war did for Hitler Germany-it
 will end in the universal downfall of impe-
 rialism.
 Countries embracing 800 million people-
 more than one-third of the population of the
 globe-now stand rallied beneath the victor-
 ious banner of Leninism. The peoples and gov-
 ernments of these countries do not want war
 and harbour no aggressive designs against any
 country. They are building a new society, and
 are interested in stable and enduring peace
 among all states in order that they may suc-
 cessfully accomplish this work. Democratic
 peace and friendship among nations is one of
 the first slogans inscribed on the banner of
 Lenin and Stalin.
 For more than thirty-three years now the
 Soviet Government has been unfailingly and
 persistently upholding the cause of peace and
 friendship among nations. The Lenin-Stalin
 peace policy, the struggle of the Soviet state
 for a democratic peace, runs like a crimson
 thread through the entire history of interna-
 tional relations in these past decades. Educated
 by the Party of Lenin and Stalin in the spirit
 of peaceful co-operation and friendship with
 other  nations, the Soviet people head the
 struggle of all the peoples of the globe for .

 durable peace and against the imperialist war-
 mongers.
 Leninism laid the foundation for the people's
 struggle  for  independence, democracy and
 peace. The 500 million signatures appended to
 the Stockholm Appeal are a vivid indication
 of the strength of the peace front, headed by
 the Soviet Union. The defeat sustained by
 American imperialism in Korea testifies to the
 fact that there are formidable obstacles to its
 schemes for unleashing another world war.
 Obsessed by a lust for world domination,
 the American imperialists are endeavouring,
 by wholesale bloodshed, to prevent the deliv-
 erance of mankind from capitalist slavery. But
 no moribund and doomed class has ever suc-
 ceeded in halting and reversing the march of
 history. Still less can this succeed now, when
 hundreds of millions of people have stirred into
 action, guiding themselves by the teachings of
 Lenin and Stalin, as a sure compass pointing
 the way to their complete emancipation.
 Local Government Councils in the People's
 Democracies
 T HE MEASURES of democratic reconstruc-
 tion undertaken in the People's Democra-
 cies have definitely put these countries on the
 road of socialist development. They are in the
 period of transition from capitalism to So-
 cialism.
 Of immense significance was the abolition
 of the old, bourgeois-landlord, machinery of
 state, which was so detested by the working
 people, and its replacement by an apparatus
 of government which is in the hands of the
 people and serves to promote their interests.
 Legislative authority in the People's Democ-
 racies is exercised by democratically elected
 higher representative institutions: the People's
 Assembly in Albania, the National Assemblies
 in Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, the Sejm in
 Poland, the Grand National Assembly in
 Rumania, and the State Assembly in Hungary.
 The members of these legislative bodies are
 men and women of the people, representatives
 of the workers, the peasants and the intel-
 ligentsia. Forty-four per cent of the deputies
 of the Hungarian State Assembly are work-
 ers, about 29 per cent are peasants, and the
 rest are representatives of the professions or
 small artisans. In the Grand National As=
 sembly of Rumania there are 177 workers and
 66 peasants, and the remaining deputies are
 professional people.
 In all the European People's Democracies,
 a new system of elected local government bod-
 ies has latterly been introduced. This places
 the coping stone on a single and uniform sys-
 tem of organs of authority, elected from bot-
 tom up by the people and responsible to the
 people.
 The law on the local government councils
 in the Hungarian People's Republic states:
 "In its advance towards Socialism, the Hungar-
 ian People's Republic is creating a system of state
 administration which will ensure the constant and
 active participation of the working people in the
 exercise of state authority and the work of govern-
 ment administration, bring the decision of all mat-
 ters within closer reach of the working masses, and
 consistently practise the principles of socialist law."
 With the creation of the People's Councils,
 as the sole organs of local government, the
 last vestiges of the old forms of local adminis-
 tration are eliminated.
 In Poland, parallel with the People's Coun-
 cils (Rady Narodowe) there existed  until
 March 1950 authorities appointed or endorsed
 from above: the governor in the province, the
 elder in the county and rural area, the mayor
 in the town.                       .,

 government organs, abolished the antiquated
 dual system of local  authority which was
 hampering the  Republic's further develop-
 ment.
 "The concentration of authority in the Peo-
 ple's Councils," said Premier Cyrankiewicz of
 the Polish Republic, "means annulment of the
 division into government and self-government
 administration, which is contrary to the es-
 sential nature of a people's state and is a sur-
 vival of the now abolished capitalist system."
 In the elections to the new local government
 bodies in the People's Democracies, the voters
 display a high level of civic activity. In the
 elections in Albania in 1949, 97.99 per cent of
 the electorate went to the polls, and 96.99 per
 cent of these voted for the candidates of the
 People's Democratic Front. In Bulgaria, 96.73
 per cent of the voters took part in the elec-
 tions to the county and communal councils on
 May 15, 1949, and 92.01 per cent of the bal-
 lots were cast for the candidates of the
 Fatherland Front.
 Elections to the local councils in Hungary
 were held in October 1950; 96.9 per cent of
 the voters went to the polls, 97.8 per cent of
 the votes going to the People's Independence
 Front.
 A high civic consciousness was likewise dis-
 played by the populace in the elections to the
 People's Councils in Rumania on December 3,
 1950: 9,473,872 persons, or 95.27 per cent of
 the electorate, took part in the voting, and
 9,124,766 ballots, or 96.31 per cent, were cast
 for the candidates of the  Front of People's
 Democracy.
 In Poland, the Presidiums of the People's
 Councils have already been elected on the
 basis of the law of March 20, 1950, and the
 election of the Councils themselves is to take
 place shortly.
 The elected People's Councils replace the
 provisional organs of local authority which
 have existed hitherto. The latter were set up
 with the object of speedily replacing the for-
 mer system of local administration, ousting
 the bureaucratic officialdom, creating a new
 machinery of local administration, and pre-
 paring for the elections to the People's Coun-
 cils. In Bulgaria, the powers and functions of
 the People's Councils were exercised for the
 time being by provisional boards. In Rumania,
 before keg first People's Councils were elected,
 their powers were exercised by provisional
 committees appointed by the Council of Min-
 isters.
 These provisional authorities were set up as
 a preparatory step to the institution of elected
 People's Councils, and they fully answered
 their purpose.
 The provisional bodies were a school for
 training future officials of the People's Coun-
 cils. They accomplished a good deal. Here, for
 example, are some figures from the record of
 the Bucharest provisional committee,  which
 was headed by a journeyman printer, Nicolae
 Vaculescu. In 1949, 44 streets were paved and
 the roadways of 33 streets repaired, and 12
 new  dispensaries  and  5  polyclinics  for
 school children were opened. In one year-
 from April 1, 1949, to March 31, 1950-60,193
 apartments were assigned to workers' fami-,
 lies, and 266 apartments were built for fore-
 most workers in production. The provisional
 committee opened 18 public libraries and 4
 houses of culture in working-class districts.
 A People's Council is elected for each admin-
 istrative division of the country. In Albania,
 for instance, there are district, city, rural area
 and village People's Councils; in Hungary-
 provincial, county, city, city district and vil-
 lage;                                                        in  Bulgaria-provincial, county, and
 communal (urban and rural) ; in Rumania-
 provincial, district, city and village; in Po-
 land-provincial, county, city, city district
 and rural area; and in Czechoslovakia-pro-
 vincial, district, and local People's Councils or
 Committees.
 Prior to the emancipation of these countries
 from the yoke of capital, their local authorities
 were headed by officials appointed from above,
 or were a mere parody of self-government. The
 picture there was the same as in other capi-
 talist countries, where the organs of "self-gov-
 ernment" are nothing more than advisory
 bodies, with very restricted powers. In France,
 for example,  over the General Council, the
 organ of "self-administration" of a depart-
 ment, stands a prefect appointed by the gov-
 ernment. Under the constitution, he exercises
 "administrative control over the local com-
 munities." Decisions of the municipal councils
 are valid only after they have been endorsed
 by the prefect. A city mayor may be dis-
 missed by the government on application from
 the prefect; so may a municipal council. The
 French Minister of the Interior has on more
 than  one  occasion  dismissed  Communist

 1951                          N  E  W
 mayors and dissolved municipal councils that
 incurred the displeasure of the reactionary
 government.
 In Italy, under the constitution of  1947,
 every department, in addition to its  elected
 council, has a government commissar, and all
 the council's decisions have to be endorsed by
 him, as the representative of the central gov-
 ernment. A departmental council may be dis-
 solved by decree of the President on practi-
 cally any pretext.
 In contrast to this undemocratic system, the
 organs of local government in the People's
 Democracies are elected or dismissed by the
 will of the people. The People's Councils are
 the local organs of state authority in the full-
 est sense of the term.
 "The system by which the local organs of author-
 ity, which will now also be the sole organs of the
 executive power of the state in the given district,
 are appointed and dismissed by the will of the
 population," says President Boleslaw Bierut of the
 Polish Republic, "is the most democratic form of
 government known in the history of social relations
 up to the present time, a form which has been
 tried and tested by the more than thirty years'
 experience of the Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
 publics."
 The People's Councils are mass organs of
 government authority. The number of mem-
 bers elected to them aggregates 220,000 in
 Hungary, over 95,000 in Poland, 50,000 in
 Bulgaria,  18,000  in  Albania, and 109,000
 (elected on December 3, 1950) in Duman;a.
 The Councils are truly representative of the
 people. In Poland, 29.5 per cent of their mem-
 bers are workers or of working-class origin,
 50.8 per cent are peasants, 14.2 per cent are
 professionals, and 4.9 per cent are handicrafts-
 men.
 Of the members of the local councils in
 Hungary,  55,000  are  industrial  workers,
 132,000 are labouring peasants, 10,000 are
 professionals, more than 5,000 are handicrafts-
 men, while  many  thousands  are                 clerical
 workers or representatives of other walks of
 life.
 The People's Councils are thus a medium
 for training tens of thousands of working
 people in the art of state administration.
 "The creation of these local organs of authority,"
 says Gheorghiu-Dej, Vice-Chairman of the Rumanian
 T  I              M E  S                         No.4
 Council of Ministers, "will mean drawing the mass
 of the populace into the work of directing the state.
 "They will be a genuine school for the training of
 government officials of a new type, government of-
 ficials coming from the ranks of the people."
 The powers conferred on the People's Coun-
 cils by the constitutions and by special legis-
 lation are very broad. They direct the economic
 and cultural affairs of their locality, endorse
 its economic plan and its budget, see to the
 maintenance of public order, help to strength-
 en the defence capacity of the country, en-
 force observance of the laws and protect the
 rights of citizens.
 Improvement of the conditions of the work-
 ing people is one of the chief concerns of the
 People's Councils. The People's Council of
 Sofia has restored the city's water supply and
 sewage systems and extended them to sur-
 rounding industrial  settlements, resurrected
 its neglected or devastated public parks and
 gardens, and laid out new parks with a total
 area of 240,000 sq. metres. New hospitals, dis-
 pensaries, maternity homes  and  children's
 creches have been built in the city. In 1949
 over 108,000 sq.  metres  of roadway were
 asphalted or paved.
 The Sofia Council has started a number of
 establishments catering to the needs of the
 population: a system of consumer goods dis-
 tributive stores, a meat distributive system, a
 house building organization,  and  suburban
 market-gardens, which supply 60 per cent of
 the city's vegetables.
 The People's Councils meet in regular ses-
 sion to consider and pass decisions on eco-
 nomic, cultural and  other  matters                                                                    cowing
 within their jurisdiction.
 In Bulgaria, the provincial People's Coun-
 cils meet in session once in three months; the
 county councils, and the city councils directly
 subordinated to provincial councils meet once
 in two months; and the communal and city
 district councils meet once a month. In Po-
 land, the new law provides that the provincial
 councils shall hold sessions not less than
 once  in three months; the county councils,
 not less than once in two months; and the
 other councils, not less than once a month.
 The relations between the various rungs of
 the ladder of People's Councils, and between
 the latter and the higher organs of state au-
 thority, are based on the principle of demo-
 cratic centralism. This combination of central-

 ized direction and planning with broad pop-
 ular initiative and local activity  and close
 attention to specific local features and require-
 ments yields splendid results. The principle of
 democratic centralism makes it possible to
 harmonize local interests with the national in-
 terests and to co-ordinate the activity of the
 local and higher organs, which together con-
 stitute a single system of government. Higher
 People's Councils direct those below them and
 see to it that their actions do not infringe legal
 requirements.
 Elected by the people, the People's Councils
 are responsible to the people, maintain close
 contact with them and must periodically re-
 port to the electorate on their activities. The
 Bulgarian constitution, for example, requires
 that the communal and county People's Coun-
 cils shall render account to their electors not
 less than once a year.
 In Rumania, the law on the People's Coun-
 cils provides for the convening of regular
 popular assemblies, as a means by which the
 population can share in the exercise of gov-
 ernment functions and supervise the activities
 of the Councils. Popular assemblies must be
 held in both rural and urban election areas not
 less than once in three months, and are open
 to all voters in the area. Extraordinary pop-
 ular assemblies must be convened if demanded
 by one-fifth or more of the voters. The popular
 assemblies are empowered to discuss the work
 of the Councils and other matters of local im-
 portance, and also the activities of higher
 authorities.
 The People's Councils are obligated to dis-
 cuss the decisions of the popular assemblies
 and to report to them on measures taken.
 The People's Councils are thus under the
 constant control of the populace. If a deputy
 forfeits the confidence of his electors, they
 may unseat him before the expiry of his term.
 This right to recall deputies is one of the car-
 dinal guarantees that the organs of govern-
 ment authority will function in a truly demo-
 cratic spirit.
 In the performance of their duties, the Peo-
 ple's Councils enlist the initiative and activity
 of the working masses. The law on the Peo-
 ple's Councils of the Bulgarian People's Re-
 public expressly states that the Councils must
 rely in their activities "on the broad partici-
 pation of the masses, and on political, trade-
 union, mass and other organizations." To
 assist the Councils, permanent committees are
 set up for all the principal divisions of eco-
 nomic and cultural affairs. The Bulgarian law
 on the People's Councils provides for the for-
 mation-depending upon the specific require-
 ments of the given community,  district  or
 province-of the  following committees: fi-
 nance, municipal services and improvement,
 public education, social welfare, local industry
 and handicraft, agriculture, animal husbandry,
 sanitary and veterinary, trade and food, health,
 etc.
 Workers, labouring peasants, professionals
 and housewives are invited to take part in
 the work of these committees. Such voluntary
 aides of the People's Councils total about
 200,000 in Poland, and over 60,000 in Bul-
 garia. The permanent committees (those deal-
 ing with cultural matters, sanitary arrange-
 ments and municipal improvement) supervise
 the building of schools, the repair of roads and
 so on. Such matters as education, bread tak-
 ing, and location of retail stores are handled
 by the Sofia People's Council with the active
 participation of the permanent committees.
 By enlisting the assistance of such bodies
 of volunteers, the People's Councils strength-
 en their ties with the masses and draw them
 into the work of state administration.
 The directing and guiding force in the local
 People's Councils, as in the higher organs of
 authority, is the Communist and Workers'
 Parties.
 In the performance of their manifold func-
 tions,  the local  Councils  of  the  People's
 Democracies draw freely upon the rich expe-
 rience in administrative organization and ac-
 tivity of the local organs of authority of the
 Soviet Union.
 The inspiring record of Soviet socialist
 democracy-the highest type of democracy-
 and                                                        the  remarkable  achievements  of the
 world's first socialist state are a glowing
 example to the working folk of the People's
 Democracies in the building of their new
 states.

 Reconstruction
 THE PROLONGED and persistent intrigue
 and the enormous pressure exerted by
 the Finnish Coalition and Social-Democratic
 Parties on the Agrarian Union have borne
 their fruit: on January 17, the President of
 Finland appointed a new cabinet which in-
 cludes the Social-Democrats. Kekkonen -re-
 mains Prime Minister, and Gartz  (Swedish
 Popular Party) retains the Ministries of For-
 eign Affairs and of Foreign Trade. The Social-
 Democrats have been given seven cabinet
 posts: Minister of Defence, First and Third
 Ministers  of  Communications  and Public
 Works, Minister of Trade and Industry, Sec-
 ond Minister of Social Affairs, First Minister
 of Finance, and Second Minister of Agricul-
 ture.
 In the program it published on January 18,
 the new Finnish government declared that it
 would adhere to the foreign policy course of
 the previous government, and would "in its
 activity cherish and promote friendly relations
 with the Soviet Union on the basis provided
 by the Peace Treaty, the Treaty of Friendship,
 Co-operation and Mutual Assistance, and the
 trade agreement of June 13, 1950."
 This, of course, is a very important assur-
 ance. It certainly conforms with the senti-
 ments of the Finnish people at large. And it
 is in Finland's interests to pursue such a
 policy.
 However, democratic opinion in Finland
 expresses the apprehension that the presence
 of Right-wing Social-Democrats in the cabi-
 net may prevent the Kekkonen government
 from adhering to its intentions. The Vapaa
 Sana points out that, with the advent of the
 Right-wing Social-Democrats, the government
 now includes representatives of the most anti-
 Soviet and most pro-American group in the
 country.
 To take, for one, the new Minister of Trade
 and Industry, the Right-wing Social-Democrat
 Penna Tervo. He is the editor of the central
 organ of the Finnish Social-Democratic Party,
 a paper which rabidly campaigns against the
 Soviet Union and supports the war policy of
 of the Kekkonen Cabinet
 the Western powers. Penna Tervo is one of
 those Right-wing Social-Democrats who spe-
 cialize in foreign affairs and are associated with
 Comisco (International Socialist Conference
 Committee), which is notorious as a doughty
 auxiliary of the North-Atlantic bloc. He is,
 moreover, a former functionary of the fascist
 Brotherhood-in-Arms, which was disbanded
 by the Control Commission. The new Minister
 of  Defence,   Right-wing  Social-Democrat
 Emil Skog, is also associated with this fascist
 clique.
 Such being the complexion of the Right-wing
 Social-Democratic leaders, and especially in
 view of the anti-Soviet campaign conducted
 by their sachem, Tanner, no particular confi-
 dence is inspired by the effusive assurances of
 the Finnish reactionary press that the recon-
 struction of the Kekkonen cabinet was prompt-
 ed solely by considerations of home policy,
 and that it will not be productive of any
 changes in foreign policy. Is this not a smoke
 screen?
 Are we to believe that the American and
 British diplomatic circles who for six months
 manoeuvred behind the scenes to get the
 Right-wing Social-Democrats included in the
 Finnish government were interested in chang-
 ing only Finland's home policy, and not her
 foreign  policy? And now, when some of
 Tanner's    most  intimate   colleagues,  like
 Messrs. Penna Tervo and Emil Skog, really
 have been included in the Kekkonen cabinet,
 is it not natural to assume that, both in home
 and in foreign policy, they will strive to carry
 out the will of the Finnish and Anglo-American
 reactionaries, whose appointees they are?
 The reconstruction of the Kekkonen cabinet
 aroused the vehement protest of Finnish dem-
 ocratic opinion. A resolution of the Finnish
 People's Democratic Union states:
 "The foreign and internal reactionaries have suc-
 ceeded in carrying out their plans for forming a
 bourgeois-Social-Democratic  government. The de-
 mand of the working masses and other democratic
 elements of the country for a government of demo-

 cratic co-operation has been grossly flouted. As a
 result, the vital interests of the working class and
 the country's international position are imperilled."
 The Coalition Party I's not represented in the
 cabinet. Its leaders realize that the inclusion
 of its representatives in the government would
 be too brazen a challenge to the peace-loving
 Finnish people, who know that this party
 openly supports the machinations of the Amer-
 ican warmongers. But the Coalitionists regard
 the present government merely as a caretaker
 government, and undoubtedly have an eye to
 forming their own cabinet later on. Mean-
 while, they consider that the Tannerites,
 now that they are in the government, will
 help them to create conditions more favour-
 able to their interests in the next elections-
 all the more that, in matters of home and for-
 eign policy, the Right-wing Social-Democrats
 in all essentials take the same stand as the
 Coalitionists. What this stand is in regard to
 foreign policy is only too well known: it is
 one of participating in the anti-Soviet intrigues
 and criminal ventures of the American war-
 mongers.
 It is obvious that with the appearance of the
 Right-wing Social-Democrats in the Kekko-
 nen government, Finland has made a step
 away from the path to peace and progress.
 A Weak Link in the North-Atlantic Chain
 Review of the Italian Press
 1   APPEARS that Italy is another sector of
 1 the aggressive North-Atlantic bloc that is
 beginning to wobble.
 The policies dictated to De Gasperi from
 Washington have long since brought the Italian
 reactionaries into sharp conflict with the peo-
 ple. The atmosphere is strained enough as it
 is; yet the United States keeps piling on the
 pressure. The appearance of Eisenhower  in
 Western Europe threw Italy's ruling circles
 into what 11 Popolo called an acute "fit of
 neurasthenia."
 The first signs of the fit came on January 11,
 at a meeting of the parliamentary group of
 the party in power, the Christian-Democrats.
 Hitherto, they unmurmuringly carried Wash-
 ington's orders through  parliament, where
 they command an absolute majority. But this
 time they fell to quarrelling over the govern-
 ment's foreign policy. The chief protagonist
 of the dissidents was no other than Giovanni
 Gronchi himself, speaker of the Chamber of
 Deputies. He said that the government's pol-
 icy was arousing alarm and apprehension in
 the country, and that there was no unity
 among the Christian-Democrats on the sub-
 ject.
 Speaking in connection with the affairs
 Eisenhower has come to Europe to arrange,
 Gronchi insisted that the Italian government
 under no circumstances enlarge its commit-
 ments under the North-Atlantic pact, and dis-
 countenanced the moves to involve Europe in
 the war the United States is engineering.
 On the eve of the meeting of the parlia-
 mentary group, La Libertd carried an article
 by Gronchi, in which he said that "Italy is
 fatally committing herself to decisions which
 she has no power to influence," and that
 "dissatisfaction   and  alarm  are  charac-
 teristic of very large sections of the Italian
 public."
 Gronchi disapproved of the plan to form a
 European army under American command,
 and sharply criticized Minister of Defence Pac-
 ciardi and the Italian generals, who, he said,
 instead of training army cadres "on the model
 of the German Reichswehr," were prepared to
 place  divisions  at  Eisenhower's  disposal.
 Gronchi repeated this criticism at the meet-
 ing of the parliamentary group, where he de-
 manded the resignation of Sforza and Pac-
 ciardi-a demand which, the Rome newspapers
 say, was greeted at the meeting with manifest
 approval.
 The government's policy and war prepa-
 rations were taken exception to by a number
 of  other  Christian-Democrat   deputies

 1951                          N  E  W
 notably Del Bo, who declared that "all Italy is
 opposed to a preventive war."
 So trenchant was the opposition that De Gas-
 peri  deemed  it  necessary  to          give  assur-
 ances in the press that there would be "no
 alterations in the government" and that no
 consequences would follow the wordy battle
 in   the  Christian-Democrat  parliamentary
 group.
 Nevertheless, the press  which is close to
 government circles intimates that the govern-
 ment's policy is badly discredited. "The gov-
 ernment will have to reckon with the situa-
 tion," says Il Momento Sera.
 La Voce Repubblicana, organ of the Repub-
 lican Party and mouthpiece of Ministers Pac-
 ciardi and Sforza, whose policy Gronchi criti-
 cized for its lack of independence and dis-
 regard for Italy's national dignity, gives the
 following insight into the discord prevail-
 ing among the Americanized politicians:
 "Every party ... has split into active Westerners
 and passive Westerners, or fatalists, into consistent
 and convinced supporters of the Atlantic pact and
 ostensible supporters."
 In the opinion of these "ostensible" support-
 ers, the paper says, participation in America's
 ventures must be more cautious and rearma-
 ment must as far as possible be only symbol-
 ical. They consider that "an extra day of peace
 is preferable to war," and therefore support
 the idea of talks with the Soviet Union on
 major international problems. Apparently, La
 Voce Repubblicana is worried by this trend,
 and says:
 "If this attitude goes much further, it will threaten
 to end in a split, and its supporters run the risk
 of sliding into neutrality and open opposition to
 the Atlantic pact."
 The appraisal of the state of political feeling
 given by such a reactionary paper as II Tempo
 is significant:
 "It is in the natural order of things that the same
 tendencies should be manifested in Italian home
 affairs as in foreign affairs. Their source is the
 widespread dissatisfaction, both in Europe and in
 America, with the polities hitherto pursued by the
 Western powers."
 Some prominent members of the Italian rul-
 ing camp favour the calling of a four-power
 conference to settle the German question, and
 T       I         M E  S                         No.4
 are also urging negotiations on Far Eastern
 affairs. Writing in La Liberia, Christian-Dem-
 ocrat deputy Igino Giordani vigorously op-
 posed rearmament and war, and urged that
 "before going the whole hog in rearmament, let us
 pause and reflect ... and try to achieve agreement,
 conciliation."
 Be it noted that these Christian-Democrat
 oppositionists do not attack the North-Atlantic
 bloc openly and directly. Senator Quinto Tos-
 atti declared in an interview printed in Paese
 Sera:
 "The Atlantic pact is not subject to discussion,
 but we must not step by step increase our com-
 mitments under it. For example, the appointment
 of a supreme commander in Europe in peacetime
 is a step which requires explanation, and which
 may immediately involve direct interference in eco-
 nomic affairs. In my opinion, such interference is
 impermissible outside of normal diplomatic chan-
 nels. Reasonable rearmament commensurate with
 neutrality, defence or nonbelligerent status is the
 right of every country. But such rearmament must
 be undertaken on the basis of the broadest possible
 agreements, and not for ends which may create the
 impression of prejudiced hostility."
 The controversy in Christian-Democrat cir-
 cles is highly symptomatic. It bears witness to
 a certain discord among the reactionary forces
 on which Washington relies. Even many of
 those who helped to draw Italy into the North-
 Atlantic pact are becoming apprehensive of
 the possible consequences of participation in
 this aggressive undertaking of rabid Amer-
 ican imperialism.
 Like France, Italy is regarded by Washing-
 ton as a weak link in the North-Atlantic
 system. Its weakness, of course, springs from
 the attitude,  not of the  Christian-Democrat
 reactionaries but of the Italian people.
 The policy of the ruling camp which has
 placed the country at the mercy of the Amer-
 ican monopolies has brought intolerable hard-
 ships upon the Italian working masses. Their
 legitimate demands go unheeded, their eco-
 nomic interests are suffering severely, and their
 democratic rights are trampled upon by Euro-
 pean gendarmes of American imperialism like
 Minister Scelba.

 reactionary newspapers asserted that it was
 all the result of "incitation." But such state-
 ments are a smoke screen, intended to hide the
 wide scope, the unanimity, the spontaneity
 and unquestionable legitimacy of the people's
 protests against the policies of the De Gasperi
 government and against the North-Atlantic
 bloc. In point of fact, it is the American war-
 mongers themselves and their Rome abettors
 who are inciting the Italian people to protest.
 Hunger, violence and preparation for war are
 the most powerful incitations to popular in-
 dignation.
 The uproar caused by Eisenhower's visit to
 Rome confirmed the worst fears of the Italian
 agents of the North-Atlantic bloc. Once again
 the Italian people gave an impressive demon-
 stration of their desire for peace and their op-
 position to plans that would involve Italy in
 the preparations for imperialist war. The gov-
 ernment resorted to extreme measures of vio-
 lence. But firing upon men and women who

 peaceful people, are misdeeds which can only
 add fuel to the flames of popular wrath. If,
 besides acquiring military bases and establish-
 ing control over the armed forces of America's
 European satellites, Eisenhower really desired,
 as he claimed, to feel the pulse of popular sen-
 timent, he certainly had no cause to ponder
 over the diagnosis. The sentiment is as clear
 as clear can be.
 And the Italian reactionaries too are aware
 of the sentiment of the people, and fully realize
 that they remain in power only thanks to the
 American system established in Western Eu-
 rope. And it is the bankruptcy of this system
 that is the cause of the doubt, alarm and crisis
 in the ranks of the Christian-Democrat politi-
 cians.
 One can imagine what an impasse Truman's
 policy has reached when it is being criticized
 even among the Rome politicians, the meekest
 of the U.S. satellites.

 INTERNATIONAL LIFE
 It took Adenauer six weeks to reply-in the
 negative-to Prime Minister Grotewohl's pro-
 posal for negotiations to set up an All-German
 Constituent Council with a view to re-estab-
 lishing German unity. Adenauer's rejection
 was accompanied by a whole stack of ex-
 planations, calculated, presumably, to provide
 some sort of justification for a policy that cuts
 against the national interests of Germany and
 her people. But all these  explanations and
 elucidations elucidate absolutely nothing, ex-
 cept the fact that the Adenauer gang of Amer-
 ican hirelings do not want to see Germany
 take the path of peace and democratic unity.
 Adenauer gives his whole game away when
 he names the Peace Defence Act recently
 adopted by the German Democratic Republic
 as one of the reasons for his flat rejection of
 the negotiations proposal. This law, which
 makes war propaganda a crime, does not suit
 Herr Adenauer. And no wonder, for prohibition
 of war propaganda cannot but infuriate the
 men who are working so hard to resurrect the
 Nazi Wehrmacht and turn Western Germany
 into a base for fresh aggression.
 It is highly indicative that it took Adenauer
 so long to reply to the Grotewohl letter. The
 explanation is that the initiative of the Prime
 Minister of the German Democratic Republic
 met with such support throughout the coun-
 try, and among all sections of its population,
 that the Bonn puppets were in a quandary.
 Not only the democratic elements, but quite a
 large section of bourgeois opinion too, have
 been bringing strong pressure to bear on
 Bonn, demanding that an end be put to the
 treasonous policy of splitting Germany and
 that some understanding be reached with the
 German Democratic Republic. Neither Bonn
 nor Petersberg (residence of the Western High
 Commissioners) could make up their minds
 just what to do. After a series of backstage
 conclaves a document was produced which,
 needless to say, advances no valid arguments
 against negotiations and only exposes  the
 Bonn rulers as obedient tools of the U.S. and
 British policy of partitioning Germany.
 The Adenauer reply is a clear-cut demonstra-
 tion to the German people that the Bonn rul-
 ers are agents  of U.S.-British  imperialism,
 that they are prepared to convert Germany
 into a bridgehead of war, and her people into
 cannon fodder for Eisenhower.
 The rejection of Grotewohl's proposal was
 met with indignation by the German peo-
 ple. Protests are being voiced in every pact
 of the country and by all sections of the popu-
 lation.
 Every German can now see that  all  the
 Bonn politicians' talk about German unity is
 just so much humbug. German unity and peace
 in Europe are about the last thing Adenauer
 and his crew want. Adenauei's reply to the
 Grotewohl proposal is fresh proof of that.
 The Bonn "government" has come out in
 its true colours-as an enemy of German
 unity, and this will undoubtedly serve to in-
 tensify the popular struggle for the demo-
 cratic unity of Germany and the peaceful de-
 velopment of her people.
 The assurances of Sweden's Social-Demo-
 cratic Ministers that they have no hand what-
 ever in the aggressive North-Atlantic bloc
 would by now probably fill quite a thick vol-
 ume. But there are numerous facts showing
 what these assurances are really worth. Some
 recent events have been especially revealing.
 Visits by American and British militarists
 to Sweden and by Swedish military men to
 America have become more frequent. In De-
 cember the Swedish press reported the arrival
 in Stockholm  of British  Lieutenant-Colonel
 Bell, whose official mission it was to arrange
 supplies for the Swedish air force, and of
 U.S. Assistant Secretary  of the  Air  Force
 Stuart. Swedish Admiral Ekstrand went to
 Washington "to contact representatives of the
 U.S. armed forces." In an interview published

 Approved For Release 2002/01/18 : CIA-RDP83-00415R00770003000'3-0
 early this month United Press quoted a mean-
 ingful statement by the admiral to the effect
 that supplying the Swedish armed forces with
 the war materials they need is in line with
 America's own interests.
 It should not be difficult to divine just what
 "American interests" the admiral had in mind,
 especially if we recall that Sweden is herself
 supplying arms to members  of the  North-
 Atlantic bloc, primarily to Norway and Den-
 mark. The Dutch De Waarheid reported                     on
 January 9 a number of interesting statements
 by Colonel Saebo, head of the Norwegian del-
 egation at the recent meeting of the North-
 Atlantic "Defence" Production Board. It ' ap-
 pears that there is a ramified network of
 Swedish-Norwegian   military   committees,
 which, on Colonel Saebe's admission,
 "allocate war contracts, co-ordinate armament sup-
 plies for the Swedish and Norwegian forces, deal
 with matters pertaining to joint command of the
 armed forces, and study the strategic plans and
 tactical objectives mapped out for the Scandina-
 vian general staffs."
 In pursuance of these strategic plans and
 objectives, the Washington origin of which is
 beyond doubt, the Swedish authorities-to
 quote Saebe once more-
 "have in the specified period provided Norway with
 sufficient arms to enable her to complete the rear-
 mament of her forces."
 Saebo further boasted that regular co-oper-
 ation was practised between the Norwegian
 and Swedish general staffs, and also between
 their joint military committees and the cor-
 responding North-Atlantic pact body.
 Saebs's opposite number on the Danish del-
 egation, Lindhardt, was likewise lavish in his
 praise of Sweden for the assistance she had
 rendered to the Danish army. He also an-
 nounced that, on the recommendation of U.S.
 advisers, a joint Swedish-Danish military com-
 mittee would soon be formed.
 General Eisenhower did not visit Stock-
 holm during his tour of the capitals of the
 Marshallized countries. But, as the Stock-
 holms Tidningen reported on January 12, the
 Danish government took upon itself the mis-
 sion of "informing Sweden of the talks with
 General Eisenhower."
 The  militarization  of  Sweden  is  being
 pushed at top speed. One very plain indication
 of it is the new national budget submitted to
 the Riksdag by the Erlander Cabinet. Military
 allocations in the fiscal year 1951-52 will be
 nearly 50 per cent above the figure for the
 preceding year: 1,212 million kronor compared
 with 839 million, and will account for over
 22 per cent of all budgetary expenditure.
 All these facts go to show that the U.S. im-
 perialists, through their agents in Sweden's
 ruling circles, are continuing their attempts
 to draw Sweden into the aggressive North-
 Atlantic bloc, even if by the back door.
 The Pakistan papers announce that the so-
 called All-Moslem Conference will meet for
 its second session in Karachi this February.
 The conference leaders maintain that the pur-
 pose of their organization is merely to pro-
 mote cultural, religious and economic rela-
 tions among the various Moslem states. But
 the facts indicate that its activities and the
 plans of the politicians grouped around it are
 of quite a different nature.
 The conference was inaugurated in Febru-
 ary 1949. It was sponsored by leading mem-
 bers of the Moslem League, the ruling party
 in Pakistan, and by the heads of the Egyptian
 International Islam Brotherhood Association,
 a product of the British intelligence service.
 It was clear from the very outset that these
 Moslem politicians were plotting against the
 national-liberation movement in Asia and the
 Middle East and supporting the anti-Soviet
 military schemes of the U.S. and British im-
 perialists. The leader of the International
 Islam Brotherhood Association stated outright,
 in connection with the call for the All-Moslem
 Conference, that his party was  striving to
 build up a Moslem alliance "to combat Com-
 munism in the East."
 Right after the first session of the confer-
 ence, representatives of the Islam Brother-
 hood and the Pakistan Moslem League made
 an extensive tour of the Arab countries to
 bring the rulers of these countries into their
 plan.
 In November and December 1949, the first
 "economic conference" of Moslem countries
 met in Karachi. Commenting on its outcome,
 the London Foreign Report, a City mouth-
 piece, gave its undivided approval to the idea
 of a Moslem bloc in Asia as a "counterblast
 to Communism."

 The practical implementation of this    idea
 Washington entrusted to the leaders of the
 Pakistan Moslem League, who tackled the job
 with the greatest zeal. The League's president,
 Khalik  ez-Zaman,  visited  various  Moslem
 countries, the expenses of the trip being de-
 frayed, according to the Pakistan Imrooz, by
 the U.S. Embassy in Karachi. The same paper
 stated that the object of the tour was to pre-
 pare the ground for the foundation of Islami-
 stan-an alliance intended to combat the
 mounting movement for national liberation in
 Asia.
 A second "economic conference" of Moslem
 countries was held in Teheran last October;
 Pakistan's Finance Minister Ghulam Moham-
 mad was elected chairman. The purpose and
 underlying idea of this conference did not re-
 main a secret either. The Ahang-e Shark news-
 paper described it, and not without reason, as
 a "continuation of the same old bloc-building
 policy." And another paper, the Peyk-e Isfa-
 han, added that the aims of this meeting were
 anything but economic, its chief object being
 to line up an "anti-Communist bloc."
 The  purpose of  the  forthcoming second
 meeting of the All-Moslem Conference is to
 found a "World Moslem  Brotherhood." The
 engineers of the new aggressive  bloc hope
 that the Karachi meeting will speed up the
 implementation of their plan. The clique of
 unscrupulous  imperialist-serving politicians
 behind these insidious schemes are shamelessly
 trying to capitalize national and religious sen-
 timents in order to disrupt the just struggle of
 the masses in the Eastern countries against
 imperialist oppression and for national libera-
 tion.
 When the U.S. military attache in Finland
 went on a "vacation trip" to Kauhava, where
 there is a military airfield and other military
 installations, no one was very much surprised.
 Indeed, what could be a more suitable place
 for the military attache to rest from his la-
 bours? But when, shortly after, a plane be-
 longing to the American legation appeared
 and circled over Kauhava, many Finns felt that
 this was really going too far, particularly as
 this was not the plane's first visit to the area.
 Some Finnish papers asked the Defence Min-
 istry to explain why American pilots were
 T        I  M E  S                         No.4
 flying over Finnish military installations. A
 week passed, then another, vet no official ex-
 planation was forthcoming. There was an un-
 official one instead: sonic of the papers said
 the American pilot had flown over the Kau-
 hava installations only to "convey a message
 of New Year greetings" (the flight took place
 on December 28)-see how polite and courte-
 ous the Americans were! But other papers re-
 fused to swallow the story. The plane hadn't
 come to bring "New Year greetings," they
 said, but to take photographs of the airfields
 in Osterbotten, and the American pilot had
 no doubt received permission to do so from
 the Defence Ministry.
 Driven to the wall, the Defence Ministry
 had to give some sort of explanation. It turned
 out that the man who flew over the Kauhava
 airfield was not an ordinary pilot, but the
 U.S. air attache himself. And, so the version
 ran, he was not going specially to Kauhava;
 his destination was Vaasa and Kemi further
 on, but he encountered "bad weather" near
 the Gulf of Bothnia and only got as far as
 Kauhava. As for permission to fly over that
 village, it was issued by radio immediately.
 So it was "bad weather" that was to blame for
 the whole affair!
 A STRATAGEM THAT FAILED
 Last December, rumours began to spread
 in the Middle East to the effect that a new
 "independent Arab State" was to be founded
 in the Persian Gulf area. It was to include the
 Bahrein Islands and the states of Kuwait,
 Oman and Qatar, the rulers of which had
 been  conducting  negotiations  that  month
 about amalgamating their police forces and
 customs, currency and postal systems.
 According to Teheran newspapers, the proj-
 ect for this new state enjoys governmental
 support in some of the Arab countries, whose
 press and radio are insisting that it include
 also the Iranian province of Khuzistan.
 The Iranian public was not slow to detect
 in this suspicious clamour  a new piece of
 British imperialist intrigue against Iran.
 "Teheran political circles think that Britain prob-
 ably has a hand in the affair," wrote the weekly
 Tehran-e Mosavcar.
 Nor did it require any particular perspicac-
 ity to arrive at this  conclusion.  Everybody
 knows that the Bahrein Islands, Kuwait, Oman

 and Qatar are British protectorates and their
 rulers cannot move a finger without London's
 consent. Then again, Britain's Iraqi vassals
 would never have dared to challenge Iran's
 territorial integrity had not the word  been
 given from London. It now turns out that the
 word had been given.
 Telepress reports that a special meeting of
 the British Cabinet was held early in Decem-
 ber at which Labour M.P. Philips Price re-
 ported on his recent trip to Iran. The object
 of that trip was to prepare the ground  for
 Mejlis approval of the notorious "supplement-
 ary agreement" with the Anglo-Iranian Oil
 Company, which was intended to perpetuate
 the domination of the British monopolies in
 Iran. The news Price brought back was not
 reassuring. He had seen for himself that Ira-
 nian opinion is vehemently opposed to the "sup-
 plementary agreement" and, in fact, demands
 the dissolution of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Com-
 pany altogether.
 Then it was that sinister rumours began to
 be disseminated from every British source in
 the Middle East about the establishment of a
 new "independent" Arab state, of which Khuzi-
 stan was to form part.
 But this stratagem failed to produce the de-
 sired effect. The "supplementary agreement"
 was not ratified by the Mejlis, which, evidently,
 could not disregard the violent popular op-
 position to the British plans for turning Iran
 into a colony.
 SOLIDARITY
 The heroic struggle of the Korean people
 against the American intervention meets with
 the support and sympathy of the masses every-
 where. Relief funds have been started in many
 countries; people are donating food, clothing
 and money to help the Koreans, the victims of
 monstrous atrocities and marauding at the
 hands of the American soldiery, who are laying
 waste the land of Korea.
 Numerous meetings dedicated to the libera-
 tion struggle of the Korean people are being
 held throughout the Rumanian People's Re-
 public. In response to an appeal of the Demo-
 ratic Women's Union and the Rumanian Red
 Cross, over 1,000,000 lei were collected for
 Korean relief in the space of a few days. Ru-
 manian women are knitting socks, gloves and
 other  warm  things  for  Korea.  Patriarch
 Justinian of Rumania has called on all mem-
 bers of the clergy and their congregations to
 come to the succour of the Korean people.
 "The Koreans are battling in a sacred cause,
 the hardships and sufferings of this heroic
 people are numberless," the Patriarch's ap-
 peal reads.
 The Polish Peace Committee is collecting
 gifts for Korean children who have lost their
 homes. Women's, youth and other mass or-
 ganizations, writers, actors and artists, are all
 sharing in this undertaking. Contributions to
 the Korean Relief Fund already total millions
 of zloty.
 Over 110,000,000 leva have been collected in
 the Bulgarian People's Republic for a fund in
 defence of peace and to aid the embattled
 people of Korea. The workers of the Plovdiv
 tobacco factories alone donated about 1,500,000
 leva.
 In the German Democratic Republic, about
 2,000,000 marks have been contributed for re-
 lief to the victims of American air bombings
 in Korea. The Korea Relief Committee formed
 in connection with the National Council of the
 National Front of Democratic Germany has
 purchased and shipped to Korea large quan-
 tities of medical supplies.
 Relief funds are also being collected in
 Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Albania.
 A BRAZEN COURSE
 The French National Assembly has lately
 been debating a bill sponsored by a Right,
 wing Socialist called Guy Desson. This col-
 league of Jules Moch wants to give back to
 the French fascists the property of publishing
 houses and newspapers that worked for Hitler
 during the occupation. He also wants to re-
 habilitate  collaborationist  publishers  and
 newspaper proprietors, restore their property
 rights and pay them 3,000 million francs in
 "damages"! Under the Act of May 11, 1946,
 the property of these publishing concerns was
 confiscated and turned over to Resistance or.
 ganizations. The  Desson  bill  accordingly
 strikes at the democratic publications, which
 appeared illegally during the Nazi occupation
 and after the liberation of France took over
 the premises of the pro-Hitler publishing
 firms.
 Why was the present government in such
 a hurry to frame this bill? Why is the National

 Assembly being asked to rehabilitate forth-
 with individuals who used their pens to betray
 martyred France? Replying to these questions,
 the Paris Ce Soir says it is because the Wash-
 ington directors of French               policy have so
 ordered. They are arming Germany, amnesty-
 ing collaborationists and restituting the prop-
 erty of notorious Nazi abettors.
 And indeed the Desson bill is not the first,
 and presumably not the last, link in the long
 chain of pro-fascist measures put through by
 France's rulers and the reactionary majority
 in the National Assembly. On January 2, this
 majority approved a bill amnestying French
 traitors and accomplices of Hitler. It is also
 known that an amnesty is being prepared for
 the fascist Marshal Petain, the arch-traitor of
 Vichy.
 T  I  M E  S                         No.4
 While rehabilitating  fascists and paying
 them "damages," the Washington agents in
 the Pleven-Moch Cabinet are trying to oust
 all democratic, progressive and genuinely pa-
 triotic elements from the civil service, the army
 and police, and from every sphere of public
 life. A pretty brazen thing to do in a country
 with such glorious democratic traditions, and
 with such a powerful popular movement as
 exists in France today.
 ANOTHER FLOP
 Three years ago the reactionary A.F. of U.
 leaders,  acting on  instructions  from  the
 State  Department,  collected  a     handful
 of  Latin American   trade-union   splitters
 and blacklegs  and     proclaimed  them  the

 "Inter-American Confederation of Labour." The
 move was meant to produce a bogus trade-
 union centre as a counterblast to the progres-
 sive and influential Latin American Confedera-
 tion of Labour. The Green clique sank many
 a million dollars in this scheme, but it failed
 for all that. The Inter-American Confedera-
 tion of Labour exists only in the lists of
 Acheson auxiliaries, and it is not a paying
 auxiliary either.
 The  American  imperialists  regard  the
 struggle waged by the Latin American Con-
 federation of Labour for peace, for better
 working and living conditions, for the national
 independence of the Latin American peoples,
 and against imperialist oppression, as a se-
 rious hindrance to their plans.
 The State Department accordingly decided
 to step up its efforts to undermine the Latin
 American labour movement by enlisting the
 services of the CIO leaders, who have long
 since become agents of Wall Street. Last year
 Jacob Potofsky and other CIO officials made
 a series of visits to Latin America in search
 of new adherents. But their praises of the
 Truman program and lies about the "Com-
 munist peril" failed to bring the workers over
 to Washington's side. As before, the American
 reactionaries could count only on their puny
 collection of corrupt trade-union  politicians.
 They had to manage  with these,  and  the
 Green-Murray clique summoned this crew to
 Mexico City for a "Regional Inter-American
 Labour Conference," held on January 8-12.
 An Associated Press message from Mexico
 City gives a very candid description of the
 gathering:
 "Even the newspapers most friendly towards the
 United States reported that the meeting was a ma-
 noeuvre to bring the Latin American workers under
 the control  of  U.S.  labour organizations. Pro-
 foundly anti-Communist newspapers are echoing the
 statement that the meeting only wants  to  enlist
 Latin American labour on the side of the United
 States in a war with the Soviet Union."
 The conference announced the establishment
 of an "Inter-American Regional Labour Or-
 ganization," which is to be an affiliate of the
 so-called International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions. Actually no new organization
 was established; there was only a new reg-
 istration, so to speak, of the old gang of
 trade-union fakers who have taken upon them-
 selves the ignominious mission of splitting the
 labour movement in Latin America and are
 unable to deliver the goods.
 Near the town  of Wolbrom, in Southern
 Poland, three gunmen lay in wait for 15-year-
 old Waldemar Grabinski and shot him dead.
 Monstrous as it may  seem,  Waldemar's
 mother, Marja Grabinska, was not at all
 grieved by the death of her son. She knew he
 would be killed. More, she had given priest
 Piotr Oborski her written consent to the mur-
 der of Waldemar, and the priest had absolved
 her of all sin.
 Such are the gruesome details in the trial
 held in Cracow of the priests Gadomski and
 Oborski, Marja Grabinska and other members
 of a band of assassins, terrorists and robbers
 who operated in the counties of Olkusz and
 Miechow.
 The trial untangled their skein of crime. It
 came to light that the band had been organized
 by one Henryk Adamus, a known criminal and
 former member of the counterrevolutionary
 Armia Krajowa, who had been released from
 prison by the people's government under the
 amnesty of 1948. It was led by Oborski and
 Gadomski.
 Gadomski supplied the bandits with weap.
 ons, which he kept in his church, and organ-
 ized the murder of militia officials and mem-
 bers of the Workers' Party. Among the gang's
 victims were Sawerin, headmaster of a vi1-
 lage school, and militia corporal Kamionka.
 The gang also committed a number of armed
 robberies.
 When Waldemar Grabinskf found out that
 his mother was connected with the terrorists
 and was sheltering one of their leaders, he
 warned her that he would report the murder-
 ers' hide-out to the militia.
 The cassocked bandits at once decided to
 get the boy "out  of  the way,"  and  his
 mother gave her consent to their villainous
 plan.
 The crime in Wolbrom sheds a lurid light
 on the infamous methods employed by Vatican
 agents in their fight against people's democ-
 racy.

 The campaign launched by reactionary cir-
 cles in Western Germany for the release of
 German war criminals has been intensified of
 late. The Bonn Bundestag even passed a spe-
 cial decision to send a delegation, headed by
 the Social-Democrat Schmid, to U.S. High
 Commissioner N,IcCloy with a petition request-
 ing the pardon of criminals now held in the
 Landsberg jail.
 But as a matter of fact, the German neo-
 fascists  do not have to  exert themselves
 much to secure the release of their colleagues.
 They are being released by McCloy of his own
 accord.
 A Nuremberg tribunal tried Krupp and Flick.
 Now, with McCloy working hand in glove
 with the Ruhr magnates, Flick and two Krupp
 directors, Houdremont and Ihn, have been set
 at liberty, and I. G. Farben director Fritz ter
 Meer was released a long time ago.

 sacker, has been released.
 A Nuremberg tribunal tried Nazi  jurists.
 Now Schlegelberger, former state secretary
 to the Nazi Ministry of Justice, who was
 sentenced  to life  imprisonment,  has been
 set free.
 The American authorities are riding rough-
 shod over the will of the peoples, who have de-
 manded stern punishment for the Nazi war
 criminals. Is it not because many American
 military and civilian leaders are themselves
 guilty of heinous war crimes?

 179 Days in Korea
 W F. ARRIVED in Korea in May 1950.... A
 clear sky of pastel-blue, the  shimmering
 blue of flooded rice paddies. In the paddies,
 men in white, women in white blouses and
 bright coloured skirts-and children, many
 children. Wooded mountainsides, a picturesque
 irregular coast line, wide rivers that start as
 creeks somewhere up in the mountains. The
 first general impression was of a wealth of col-
 ours, in glorious and startling combinations.
 We visited all the principal areas of North
 Korea. And wherever we came we saw the peo-
 ple busily at work. Factories and roads were
 being built, irrigation canals and fishing ves-
 sels, bridges and stadiums, schools and homes.
 The city of Phyongyang, provisional capital of
 the Korean People's Democratic Republic, was
 being reconstructed. A broad new thoroughfare
 was cutting its way among the little ram-
 shackle houses, a new railway station was be-
 ing erected, a huge sports ground was being
 laid out at the foot of Mount Moranbong.
 We observed the people's life, their daily
 doings, and endeavoured to make as complete
 a film record of it as we could. We did not sus-
 pect then that soon we would be witnessing
 events which would focus world attention on
 Korea.
 The Korean Cinema
 Korea never had a film industry of her own
 before, and no film workers. It was only the
 government of the People's Democratic Repub-
 lic that provided the conditions for the develop-
 ment of a Korean cinema art and industry.
 Film studios were built in Phyongyang. They
 were just outside the city.... I put that sen-
 tence down and had to stop. It is bitter to have
 to say that the Phyongyang film studios exist
 no more. Early in October they were razed
 to the ground by American aircraft.  But I
 know they will rise again. You can destroy a
 house, can wreck the walls, the roof, but you
 cannot destroy the living art of a living
 people.
 Besides a number of newsreels and docu-
 mentaries, Korea's young cinema industry put
 out three  full-length feature films: "Home-
 land," "Blast Furnace" and "Frontier Guards."
 This latter picture was released when the war
 was already on, and it met with a tremendous
 response, for the subject of it was the heroic
 frontier units, which were the first to repel the
 foul underhand attack of the Li Seung Man
 hirelings of American imperialism.
 In South Korea, the development of a Ko-
 rean cinematic art was not even attempted
 under the American marionette Li Seung Man.
 American firms monopolized all the screens
 and swamped them with Hollywood trash. All
 that was done at Seoul was to put Korean cap-
 tions to the American pictures.
 When the People's Army freed Seoul, a
 large stock of newsreels made by South-
 Korean cameramen was discovered there. And
 epitomized in them was the puppet nature of
 the whole South-Korean regime. The Seoul
 cameramen's work seems to have revolved
 largely around MacArthur: the General arriv-
 ing, the General appearing before the people,
 Li Seung Man making a lengthy speech in
 praise of General MacArthur. MacArthur here,
 MacArthur there, MacArthur everywhere....
 Dulles arriving in Korea. Dulles on the 38th
 parallel.... An American military parade in
 Seoul, and so on and so forth. I saw several
 thousand metres of captured newsreels but
 failed to discover even a few shots from the
 life of the people of South Korea. What the
 newsreels did bring out, however, was that Li
 Seung Man and his henchmen were foreign
 flunkeys, and their regime an outrage on the
 people. Well, we may be grateful to the time-
 serving South-Korean cameramen  even  for
 that: they have made a lasting record of Li
 Seung Man's infamous betrayal.
 North-Korean  cameramen, on the other
 hand, did work that was truly invaluable. From
 the moment hostilities broke out, they were
 up front all the time and produced a success
 sion of reels which were an important factor
 in mobilizing the efforts of the Korean people
 for the liberation struggle.

 The North-Korean cameramen  filmed the
 jubilant reception accorded the People's Army
 by the inhabitants of South Korea. They made
 films of the election of the People's Committee
 in liberated Ongdin, the liberation of Seoul,
 rejoicing crowds at meetings of many thou-
 sands. There are shots of a bridge over the
 Hangang River blasted by the Li Seung Man
 troops in their flight from Seoul, of the heroic
 South-Korean guerilla fighters who helped the
 People's Army, and of the rehabilitation of
 damaged railways. Other films show the grue-
 some atrocities perpetrated by the American
 and Li Seung Man fiends and of the sufferings
 of the people. I recall this episode, for ex-
 ample: an old mother wandering among mu-
 tilated corpses, looking for the body of her son;
 finding it, and sitting down on the ground be-
 side it, her face stony with grief.
 These film records belong to history.... The
 day of the Korean people's final victory is not
 far off, and many a film will be made about
 Korea's matchless, heroic  struggle  for  in-
 dependence. And some of the newsreel shots
 will undoubtedly figure as evidence before the
 International Tribunal that will try the Amer-
 ican war criminals.
 First Impressions
 Arriving while Korea was still at peace, we
 for several weeks saw a country absorbed in
 peaceful constructive endeavours. We went
 about studying it. Not knowing the language
 was a hindrance, of course, but it could not
 prevent us from seeing the noble qualities of
 the industrious and freedom-loving Korean
 people.
 The bulk of the population are peasants. The
 Korean peasantry follow time-honoured tradi-
 tions in their daily round of life, beginning
 with the clothes they wear and the way they
 cook their food, and ending with family rela-
 tionships.
 Rice is the staple food of the people. The
 "agrarian reform carried out by the democratic
 authorities gave the peasant land and freed
 him from age-old servitude to the landlord. At
 long last, the tiller began to work fields that
 were his own. Growing rice is hard work, it
 calls for patient, painstaking, scrupulous la-
 bour. And yet you do not see even a scrap of
 land untilled. Even the steepest slopes are
 cultivated. Kaoliang, millet, potatoes are grown
 on them.
 The rice paddies are arranged in terraces,
 and are flooded in the spring. The  rice  is
 planted in dead-straight rows. Gradually slen-
 der shoots push up through the blue of the
 water, the colour of the field changes from blue
 to pale green, then a darker green, and finally
 yellow-towards the end of September, when
 the rice ripens. And all this time you see in the
 fields, from sunrise to sunset, the patient white-
 clad figure of the peasant tending his plants.
 Grateful nature repays man's work a hundred-
 fold. Rice yields abundantly, but only if given
 this painstaking care.
 The Korean peasant works his land individ-
 ually, but irrigation matters are dealt with
 collectively. The complex system  of  dams,
 ponds, canals needed for the purpose cannot
 be built by individual effort. And the inhabit-
 ants of a whole village or district, as the case
 may require, go out together to dig pits and
 canals and put up dams and locks.
 Even the visitor from outside could not help
 seeing how much the country's progress, its
 political and economic development had been
 impeded by the artificial partition into North
 and South Korea. It was also clearly to be seen
 that North Korea was rapidly developing her
 potentialities.
 American aggression broke into the people's
 peaceful life and destroyed the things they had
 created. But the fires of war only steel the will
 of a people that has known freedom. Their
 ordeal and tribulation once behind them, the
 Korean people will square their shoulders and
 begin anew to build the glorious life of peace.

 Geography
 The confusion prevailing in the names of
 Korea's towns, rivers and mountains is a re-
 flection of her history. In no other country has
 history left so distinct an imprint on the map.
 It is often difficult to find the place you want
 on maps of Korea, because nearly every point
 has two names-a Korean and a Japanese.
 In the Soviet Union we now generally use
 the Korean names, with the Japanese added
 in brackets. I should add that Korean names
 are very hard to transcribe in other languages,
 and many variants exist as a result. There is
 a town for which practically every map you
 see has  a different designation:  Haidzyu,
 Hedyu, Haiju, Hyadzyu, and lastly, the Jap-
 anese version of Kaisyu. And none of them

 Approved For Release 2002/01/18 : CIA-RDP83-00415R007700030003-0
 really reproduces what the name sounds like
 in Korean.
 He who has not seen the Keumgangsan Hills
 has not seen Korea, Koreans say. Translated,
 Keumgangsan means   "Diamond   Hills."
 "Diamond" is used here, I imagine, in the sense
 of "precious," for these hills contain untold
 mineral riches.
 The Diamond Hills were a favourite holiday
 resort of the working folk of the Korean Peo-
 ple's Democratic Republic. There were hot
 springs there, and well-appointed sanatoriums,
 hotels and tourist camps.
 These hills have long known the presence of
 man. They are crisscrossed with paths; there
 are steps cut in the mountainside, and railings
 around the edge of sheer cliffs-the work of
 nameless hermits who in days gone by sought
 quiet and solitude here. Each mountain top
 has its crop of tales and legends.
 We were told that the Japanese deliberately
 impeded geological prospecting in the Dia-
 mond Hills. Fortunately for Korea, the future
 of these hills now no longer depends either on
 Japanese or any other imperialists. It is in
 the hands of the people, who have shed so
 much blood for their homeland.
 In mid-June I spent some time on the 38th
 parallel. On the map, the parallel cuts across
 the Korean peninsula, from the Yellow Sea to
 the Sea of Japan, in a straight line. That, of
 course, is a conventional representation of the
 demarcation line. Actually, the line is not a
 straight one-it skirts communities and winds
 in and out among the mountain ranges.
 In Haiju the line ran along the shore of a
 small inlet of the Yellow Sea; it was inadvis-
 able, I was told, to appear on the shore.
 "Why?" I queried in surprise.
 The answer was that anyone who appeared
 there was fired upon from the other side. There
 had been no fresh fish in the local market for
 a long time past because the fishermen could
 not put out.
 We drove over a road running along the
 parallel. Peasants were at work in the paddies
 and apple orchards. Wherever you looked you
 saw the labours of peace, a peaceful life. Noth-
 ing to indicate that only a few days separated
 us from the great tragedy that was to befall the
 Korean people.
 Phyongyang, June 25, 1950
 In the evening of June 24 1 went to a dance
 recital by a young Korean ballerina, Li So Ge.
 Korea's art, young, optimistic, full of promise,
 had  thriven marvellously in the five years.
 Standing on Mount Moranbong on our way
 home from the recital, we gazed down on
 Phyongyang's sea of lights. It was to be the
 last time....
 Next morning promised a beautiful day. The
 sun rose hot and clear. The morning hours in
 Korea are wonderful; nowhere else, I would
 say, is sunrise so majestic. Perhaps that is why
 Korea-Chosen-is called the Land of Morn-
 ing Calm-clear, fresh, tranquil. And so,
 the morning promised a beautiful day.  Be-
 sides,                                                           it  was  Sunday-the  day  of         rest.
 The town's awakening was quiet and peace-
 ful.
 And into this calm, peaceful quiet of the
 Korean morning broke the news that the Li
 Seung Man hirelings had  invaded North-
 Korean territory at dawn, and that the order
 was out to throw them back across the 38th
 parallel. All this was announced over the radio,
 and during the day, notices issued by the Min-
 istry of the Interior of the People's Democratic
 Republic were posted up on the walls. People
 gathered in groups to read them. Otherwise
 the city was still much as it had been. Only
 the lights did not go on at night.
 We sat on the roof. The city was dark.
 Every now and again we could hear the police-
 man calling out below: a window was not
 blacked out properly, or someone had struck
 a match to light up.... In the darkness, the
 stars burned brighter overhead. Little by little
 the city settled down for the night, and only
 the sound of cars, moving with lights down,
 broke the stillness.
 On the fifth day, June 29, at 5:30 p.m., Amer-
 ican B-29's-Flying Fortresses-made their
 first appearance over Phyongyang. There were
 27 of them. People looked up at the sky with-
 out any great apprehension, for they did not
 expect Phyongyang, a peaceful city, to be at-
 tacked. They did not know that that hour was
 to mark the beginning of the ruthless destruc-
 tion of Phyongyang, of the barbarous bombing
 of peaceful communities, of the American free-
 booters' savage policy of turning a flourishing
 country into a wasteland.

 Black Sunday
 Sunday, July 23, fully deserves the name
 Black Sunday. We looked out in the morning-
 clouds hung low overhead and there was a
 drizzle of rain. Someone said:
 "It should be quiet today...."
 The words were no sooner spoken than the
 drone of approaching planes was to be heard.
 The sirens sounded the alert. Bombs screamed.
 The air blast shook the house, windowpanes
 clattered. AA-guns opened up, then stopped-
 the gunners could not see their targets through
 the solid cloud bank.
 Korean AA-gunners are amazingly good
 shots. I myself saw enemy planes hit time
 and again-one of them went off listing bad-
 ly, another fell to pieces in the air. The Amer-
 ican airmen accordingly preferred to fly out
 of range of the AA guns, which naturally af-
 fected the precision of their bombing.
 The raid lasted a long time. The drone of
 engines, the screech of bombs, then the hurri-
 cane blast of an explosion; again the drone,
 again the screech, again the blast.... Unable
 to see the target, the Americans took to instru-
 ment-bombing or simply dropped their bombs
 at random.
 Time passed. At one moment it would seem
 that the noise was subsiding  and  the  air
 pirates were  gone.... But  then came the
 screaming of bombs again.... It was raining
 harder now, the drops pattered loudly on the
 iron roof, it was hard to sort out the sounds,
 but again  we thought the noise had les-
 sened....                 Then  bombs  tore  down  once
 more.... This went on for eight hours; we
 had ceased to believe that it would ever end,
 that the planes would ever go away.
 During one of the lulls we climbed up on
 the roof. A black pall of smoke hung over the
 city. Whole blocks were aflame. There were in-
 jured people on the streets, the rescue crews
 were out, ambulance parties darted about with
 stretchers. Two children knocked at our front
 door, we went down and let them in. They
 seemed to be brothers; one a tiny thing, the
 other a little older. They were so worn out
 with crying that they could only whimper. We
 did our best to soothe them, though this was
 rather difficult, as none of us knew Korean.
 Gradually the older boy calmed  down;  he
 whimpered no more and talked gently to the
 little one, evidently telling some story to
 divert him. The little boy stopped crying too
 and even smiled. Nowhere have I seen such
 relations among children as in Korea. The
 little Koreans "have their own unwritten code
 of how older children should treat the younger
 ones. They care tenderly  for  their smaller
 brothers and sisters, feed them, play with
 them charmingly, doing much to relieve the
 mother....
 At last the elder lad managed to comfort
 his brother, and the little one went to sleep
 in his arms.
 Twilight fell on Phyongyang amid pillars
 of smoke and clouds of dust raised by the ex-
 plosions. We went to look at the damage. The
 city had been deluged with bombs. They had
 wrecked the unfinished new building of the
 railway station and razed the whole working-
 class district around-a giant plough might
 have passed there. Pieces of wall were piled
 on each other in grotesque confusion. Many
 of the streets could no longer be distinguished.
 Overturned tramcars had been flung a long
 way from the tracks; tram rails stood up on
 end and lampposts lay on the ground. Bomb
 craters gaped in the asphalt;  the roadways
 were littered with pieces of mangled human
 bodies  and  scattered  household  effects....
 Such measureless suffering among these peo-
 ple here below, and such inhuman cruelty of
 those others up above-it was terrible....
 The things that we saw in many different
 parts of the country cannot possibly be ex-
 plained away as "tragic accidents." Korean
 hospitals had large canvasses marked with the
 Red Cross stretched on their roofs. These huge
 crosses were visible from any altitude. Perhaps
 it was just because these international insignia
 were so conspicuous that the American flyers
 chose hospitals for their targets. I saw a
 bombed hospital in Phyongyang, under the
 ruins of which hundreds of sick and wounded
 had perished; and besides this I saw the smok-
 ing ruins of many other hospitals-in Wonsan
 (Gensan),  Heungnam  (Konan),  Nampho
 (Tsinanpo), Sariwon and several other towns.
 Heroic People
 North Korea has quite a network of rail-
 ways. Whereas the Japanese were out to build
 a base for attack on the Soviet Union and were
 interested only in strategic routes, the People's
 Democratic Republic began to reconstruct the

 Approved For Release 2002/01/18 : CIA-RDP83-00415R007700030003-0
 transport system to promote Korea's econom-
 ic development. The mountainous nature of
 the country makes it very difficult both to build
 and to operate the railways. Electric traction
 is extensively employed on steep gradients, as
 for example, on one section of the Phyong-
 yang-Wonsan railway, which runs across the
 peninsula, over the Masikren mountain range.
 You see no elderly railwaymen in Korea.
 The entire transport system is run by young
 people. Under the Japanese, Koreans were
 allowed to perform only the roughest unskilled
 work on the railways. But in the five years
 of North Korea's independence, forces of Ko-
 rean railwaymen have been trained. The rail
 system passed the grim test of war and has
 been working without a hitch, thanks to the
 heroic Korean youth.
 Nor is heroism confined to the youth. Here
 is another instance. Near the town of Heung-
 nam (Konan) on the shores of the Sea of
 Japan, stood a large mineral fertilizer works.
 I write "stood," and my heart boils with anger.
 For the savage bandit  bombings have  de-
 stroyed this factory, as they have destroyed
 the greater part of the Korean people's prop-
 erty. The Heungnam works was one of the
 largest in the country, producing the sulphate
 fertilizer that is so vital to agriculture. It had
 trained skilled forces, its workers and engi-
 neers made numerous inventions and did much
 to rationalize and advance production. Like
 other factories, it was a centre of public ac-
 tivity.
 Such was the Heungnam works when I
 visited it the first time. How different the
 second!
 A few days before, seventy Flying Fort-
 resses had reduced it to a pile of tangled iron
 and a maze of broken walls. The ruins were
 still smoking, rescue parties were still trying
 to save people buried under the debris....
 And of Heungnam itself, nothing whatever re-
 mained-nothing but a scorched patch of earth
 and small heaps of rubble. The cranes in the
 port were mangled, the very fish in the water
 were dead.... Yes, it was a scene of death.
 Some of the survivors wandered like shad-
 ows among this devastation. But others were
 working to clear the wreckage.... American
 planes came over again-not Fortresses this
 time, but fighter-bombers with machine guns
 going full-blast.... Once they came, and a'
 second time.... But the people went on with
 their work-nothing could terrorize them.
 Another instance still-something that hap-
 pened in July in the town of Hamheung, fifteen
 kilometres from Heungnam. Hamheung stands
 on the Sonchongang River. Near its source in
 the mountains, the turbulent stream has been
 harnessed  for hydroelectric power; then it
 flows on through the valley, bringing moisture
 to the thirsty rice fields. By the time it gets to
 Hamheung it is very wide, and a long railway
 bridge spans it here.
 That day in July, an American plane made
 this bridge its target. From bank to bank, the
 bombs came crashing down. Two bridge-spans
 and one of the piers-the second from the right
 bank-were smashed to smithereens. But this
 bridge was vital to railway traffic between the
 northern industrial area and the south. Any
 interruption might affect the supplies of the
 fighting forces. The damage must be repaired
 without delay!-the Party of Labour called,
 and all the people in the Hamheung area re-
 sponded. Men, women, old folk and children-
 over 3,000 people in all-turned out for the
 repair job. The river's swift flow was dammed
 back with sand bags while a pier of wooden
 logs was erected. Day and night they worked,
 by torchlight when it got dark-and in three
 days' time, traffic over the bridge was resumed.
 I travelled over it myself several times. The
 trains moved slowly, the logs creaked under
 their weight, and no doubt the driver heaved
 a sigh of relief when the last car was safely
 across. But the trains were running, and that
 was the main thing.
 The heroic effort of the Korean men and
 women who rebuilt it seemed to have given
 this bridge a charmed life. The Americans
 bombed it time and time again, but without
 effect. I was there in August, and again in
 September. Everything around was hideously
 mutilated, but the bridge remained intact. And
 when the air bandits saw this, they vented their
 spite in murdering children bathing and wom-
 en washing clothes up the river, a long way
 from the bridge. The bridge, they realized, was
 invulnerable.

 Paris Impressions
 Notes of a Film Producer
 M. CHIAURELI
 L AST DECEMBER the France-U.S.S.R. As-
 sociation invited a delegation of Soviet in-
 tellectuals to visit France and take part in
 the Franco-Soviet Friendship Month.
 By the time the Soviet delegation, headed
 by Academician Nesmeyanov, rector of the
 University of Moscow, arrived in France after
 surmounting countless obstacles in the matter
 of visas, the Month was nearly over. How-
 ever, the cordial welcome we were given on
 French soil quickly dispelled the understand-
 able feeling of resentment evoked by the
 actions of the Paris authorities.
 The Franco-Soviet Friendship Month was a
 striking demonstration of the deep and unfail-
 ing sympathy which the ordinary people of
 France cherish for the Soviet people. The mem-
 bers of the France-U.S.S.R. Association come
 from all sections of the nation. True French-
 men and ardent patriots, they repose great
 hopes in friendship between France and the
 U.S.S.R. and bring the truth about the Soviet
 Union to the masses, explaining its peaceful
 aspirations and giving a true picture of the
 Soviet people's tremendous achievements in
 economy and culture.
 Thanks to the Association, tens of thousands
 of French men and women are receiving cor-
 rect information about the life of the Soviet
 people, and are getting to know their liter-
 ature and art. The Association arranges talks
 and lectures about the Soviet Union, pub-
 lishes books and magazines, holds exhibitions,
 concerts and demonstrations of Soviet films.
 All this activity knocks great holes in the iron
 curtain of malicious lies with which the pres-
 ent rulers of France and their American task-
 masters want to shut the French people off
 from the land of Socialism.
 Inviolable friendship between our two peo-
 ples was the watchword of the congress of the
 France-U.S.S.R. Association, which met in
 Paris. The welcome accorded the Soviet del-,
 egates was unforgettable. And the stormy ova-
 tions that rocked the hall whenever a speaker
 mentioned the name of Comrade Stalin, the
 touching expressions of love and gratitude to
 the Soviet people for saving the world from the
 Nazi plague, were  eloquent testimony  that
 American propaganda is powerless to make
 the French people hostile to the Soviet Union.
 "Long live peace!" "Long live friendship
 with the Soviet Union!" "Long live the great
 Stalin ["-echoed and re-echoed through the
 hall.
 In the right-hand corner sat a delegation
 from one of the northwestern departments.
 The women were dressed in picturesque local
 costumes, the men wore the traditional red
 caps. Colourful too were the costumes worn by
 women delegates  from the department of
 Hautes-Pyrenees, who, we were told, had
 worked hard all the previous summer on vege-
 table plots planted for the express purpose of
 raising money for the trip to Paris to attend
 the congress.
 From the rostrum of the congress, the finest
 men and women of France voiced the senti-
 ments of the French people.
 "The real France is true to its friendship
 with the Soviet Union, and that is the best
 guarantee of peace," said Marcel Cachin, vete-
 ran Communist Party leader.
 "You don't have to be a Communist to be
 a friend of the Soviet Union," Pierre Debray,
 the Catholic writer, declared.
 Fanalette Janneau, a peasant woman, said
 that never will Frenchmen take up arms
 against the heroes of Stalingrad.
 Our Soviet film "The Fall of Berlin" was
 shown in Paris during the Friendship Month.
 The French authorities had not permitted the
 picture to be released, but that had made the
 public only the more anxious to see it. The
 huge Mutualite hall where the film was to be
 demonstrated was filled to overflowing. The
 showing was preceded by an introductory talk
 about Soviet cinematic art. Then the lights
 went down, but no sooner had the opening
 shots of the film been flashed on to the screen
 than the police appeared and ordered the
 showing to stop on the grounds that no official

 No.4                            N  E  W
 permit had been issued for the picture's re-
 lease in France-although the law permits
 the private showing of such films. Only upon
 the unanimous protest of the audience and the
 assurance on the part of the organizers that
 the film would not be shown in full did the
 police withdraw.
 Incidentally, the leaders of the Association
 found an ingenious way of compensating for
 the mutilation of the film by the censorship:
 they inserted explanatory titles in the spots
 that had been censored out. For example, in
 Part I after Alexei Ivanov and the factory
 director leave for Moscow at the invitation of
 Comrade Stalin came the subtitle:
 "Here Stalin receives the ordinary steelworker
 and has a friendly talk with him, but on the insist-
 ence of the censors this section has been omitted."
 And in place of the deleted section at the
 Yalta Conference:
 "Here Stalin demands from the Allies guarantees
 of peace and security for the peoples, but this scene
 has been deleted by the censors."
 It is difficult to describe the storm of pro=
 test and indignation in the hall when the de-
 letions began. Still, with the help of the cap-
 tions the audience was able to follow the ac-
 tion and understand  what was happening.
 Each appearance of Comrade Stalin on the
 screen was greeted with fervent ovations.
 The other Soviet pictures shown during the
 Month, "The Third Blow," "Kuban Cossacks,"
 "Men of Courage," and "A Forest tale," were
 likewise highly successful. The progressive
 French press printed enthusiastic reviews of
 them. The reactionary papers as usual either
 tried to ignore them or showered them with
 abuse. Curiously enough, however, the very
 same bourgeois reviewers who disparage our
 films in the columns of the yellow press rush
 to see every Soviet picture that happens to be
 shown in France.
 As an art worker I was naturally interested
 in the position of my French colleagues. I must
 say that acquaintance with the cultural life
 in bourgeois France today makes a depressing
 impression on the Soviet visitor.
 The indifference of the powers that be to-
 ward genuine art and the resounding publicity
 given to nonentities who pander to the lowest
 T        I  M  E  S                          1951
 tastes are evidence of the spiritual devastation
 that the American "benefactors" are bringing
 Western Europe.
 I visited the art gallery where the works of
 Rodin, France's  greatest sculptor,  are ex-
 hibited. It was impossible, however, to view
 all of his work: the premises are so cold and
 gloomy that you simply cannot remain there
 for any length of time.
 "We are poor, we have very few visitors,"
 the attendant explained.
 If few people visit the Rodin Gallery, that
 is again the fault of those who are trying to
 divorce art from life, from the people, those
 who in place of the lofty ideas of democracy,
 freedom and peace that nourish true art are
 preaching obscurantism, savagery and moral
 corruption, degrading art by being accessories
 of capitalism in its preparations for another
 destructive war.
 I saw the cafe where the "existentialists,"
 those cosmopolitan aesthetes, foregather. It is
 in the very heart of Paris, the reactionary
 press is full of the doings of its habitues, and
 their delirious writings are given blaring pub=
 licity, while true, humane, realistic art is ne-
 glected.
 The  "existentialists"-the   followers  of
 Sartre--and  other  proponents  of  fascist-
 minded cosmopolitanism, have no homeland.
 for the interests of the land of their birth are
 alien to them. These outcasts can only pile up
 their ill-gotten gains, considering this the be-
 all and end-all of life, or squander them in
 dissipation to kill the years of their pointless,
 futile existence. They are like the sparrows
 who point their tails impudently skywards
 with their beaks stuck in the dung on which
 they feed.
 It is evil-smelling, noxious spiritual pabu-
 lum that the cinema, the radio and the press
 serve up to the French people. Nearly 75 per
 cent of the films shown on the French screen
 are  American  gangster,  pornographic,  or
 frankly fascist pictures. And in the meantime
 the French cinema is falling into decline, un-
 able to compete with the American trash
 which enjoys the encouragement of the Mar-
 shallized authorities.
 At the beginning of last year the American
 film magnates, out to get the French cinema
 completely under their thumb and ensure the
 undivided domination of Hollywood in France,
 imposed on the French film industry what they

 call "Joint Franco-American film production,"
 which, like all other forms of "co-operation"
 between the U.S.A. and France, has turned
 out in practice to be a flagrant violation of
 French interests. French actors, producers and
 technicians have simply been left without
 work to do, and the "co-operation" simply
 amounts to the use of French film studios and
 properties  for  the  shooting  of  American
 movies. Script-writers, actors (including those
 featured in  leading roles), producers   and
 technicians are all   brought over      from the
 United States. One of the provisions of the
 arrangement is that each picture is made in
 two versions, French and English; but Amer-
 icans are cast in the French versions as well,
 and as a result, French cinema workers    do
 not take part even in the shooting of films
 destined for the French screen.
 The censorship in France is perhaps as
 much an enemy of the French cinema as the
 American producers are. While readily issuing
 licenses for American films, it savagely sup-
 presses everything progressive and honest in
 French cinematography.
 Soviet film-goers saw "The Battle of the
 Railways," which gives a faithful picture of
 the French patriots' heroic struggle against
 the fascist invaders; but few people in France
 saw it. "The Man We Love Best," a poetic
 record of the love that the working people of
 France bear the great leader and teacher of
 toiling humanity, was banned by the censors,
 as was "Battle for Life," a film about the
 First World Peace Congress in Paris. Among
 the many other films banned were "1848," put
 out for the centenary of the 1848 revolution,
 and "They Rose Before Daybreak," about the
 struggle of the Spanish people for their in-
 dependence.
 Progressive film workers and their trade
 union are putting up a vigorous fight against
 the censors' tyranny. The infamous actions of
 the censorship authorities are the subject of
 indignant articles in the progressive press and
 of interpellations by Communist deputies in
 parliament. The ordinary film-goer, sick to
 death of the American trash, also has his say
 on this score. Outside cinemas with dazzling
 advertisements of  American  "hits"  I  saw
 posters with fiery protests against the flood of
 imported tripe, and appeals for the promotion
 of French films.
 American ideological aggression in France
 is not confined to the cinema. Lying prop-
 aganda about the American way of life, which
 is utterly repellent to honest French men and
 women who want to see their country free
 and independent, is dinned into the ears of
 radio-listeners on all wave lengths.
 In broadcasting, as in the cinema, progres-
 sive elements are being hounded at the bid-
 ding of the American imperialists.
 Not long ago Jean Vidal, one of the most
 popular radio reporters in Paris, lost his job.
 The circumstances of his dismissal are note-
 worthy. Vidal arranged a program about the
 demonstration in the High Commission  for
 Atomic Energy of the film "Life Begins Tomor-
 row," made by Nicole Vedres and Andre La-
 barthe. The broadcast consisted of brief state-
 ments by Mme. Vedres and Labarthe and the
 comments of four employees of the Commis-
 sion who had viewed the picture.
 "Life Begins Tomorrow" treats of famous
 men of France. The different parts of it are by
 no means of equal merit as regards their con-
 tent. The film gives equal prominence to the
 "philosopher" Jean-Paul Sartre and the out-
 standing peace champion, the artist Pablo
 Picasso, to the mediocre reactionary writer
 Andre Gide and the famous progressive sci-
 entists Frederic and Irene Joliot-Curie. How-
 ever, it poses the question: is creative work of
 any kind possible under the threat of the atom
 bomb? And it shows what awaits mankind if
 the threat to employ the bomb should be car-
 ried out.
 In his broadcast Vidal interviewed Andre
 Labarthe, co-author of and actor in the film-
 though, incidentally, before the program went
 on the air, Vidal's chiefs cut Labarthe's state-
 ment, ostensibly in order to shorten the broad-
 cast from five to three and a half minutes.
 What did Labarthe say to his listeners? He
 told them that his film was not about politics,
 that it was about peace and science.
 What did the four spectators say? That the
 film is an appeal to all workers in science to
 unite in the interests of peace;  they spoke
 about the indignation aroused by the govern.
 ment's decision to remove Professor Joliot-
 Curie from his post as High Commissioner for
 Atomic Energy, and said that they continued
 to consider Joliot-Curie their chief.
 They said what they thought, and they
 thought what millions of other French people

 who do not want war and are demanding the
 outlawing of the atom bomb are thinking.
 But this was enough to alarm the reaction-
 aries and obscurantists in the Paris radio.
 One of them, Vasseur, publicly admonished
 Vidal thus:
 "You ought not to have brought spectators in.
 Peace is a subject of Communist propaganda, and
 Communist propaganda cannot be tolerated on the
 radio. To speak of peace is to fling a challenge to
 the government."
 These frankly cynical words actually re-
 quire no comment, but there is one colourful
 sidelight I should like to mention: Vidal's
 broadcast was given in the program "Paris
 Speaking," which is beamed to America. Evi-
 dently it was an irate reprimand from that
 quarter that set the Paris reprisal machine in
 motion, and Jean Vidal found himself without
 a job.
 It was painful for us to witness such out-
 rages against the national dignity of the
 French, in whose country the American im-
 perialists are trying to behave like conquerors.
 In  an effort to suppress  all  true French
 thought, the overseas businessmen are seizing
 control of both the publication and sale of
 literature and flooding the French book market
 with trash. Countless "digests" crammed with
 American propaganda are being put out in
 France with American money. To the "Read-
 er's                                                                Digest,"  "Sport  Digest,    "Catholic
 Digest,"  and numerous others,  one    more
 was recently added-the "Family Digest." It
 is, so it says, "a publication intended for
 the family, a happy, healthy, purely French,
 pleasant  and useful publication."  But the
 only thing it could do to prove its "purely
 French" origin was to proclaim the notorious
 Vichy slogan, "work, family and country,"
 which the  Petain crew advanced with the
 blessing of Hitler and invested with a pro-
 foundly reactionary meaning. Thus are the
 reactionary "ideas" of the fascist occupation
 period being revived today in Marshallized
 France, this time in an American version.
 But there is another France, the true, coura-
 geous, freedom-loving France; there is the
 great French people, loyal to the glorious tra-
 ditions of the Paris Commune, firmly resolved
 to fight for the independence of its homeland,
 for the triumph of progress and democracy,
 for world peace. And it is to this France that
 the future belongs.
 Story of Sfruggle and Victory
 THE AUTHOR of "China Victorious," a Rus-
 sian translation of which appeared recently,
 is an Austrian progressive who spent a num-
 ber of years in China and took part in the anti-
 imperialist liberation struggle of its heroic peo-
 ple. Jensen dedicates his book "to the millions
 of men and women fighting for China's free-
 dom." His account was completed a few
 months before the history-making victory of the
 Chinese people and the birth of the Chinese
 People's Republic. Permeated with the fervour

 of revolutionary struggle, the book traces the
 principal stages in the people's revolution and
 exposes the terrorist regime of the Kuomintang
 clique and the machinations of the imperialists.
 Despite  some  shortcomings,  "China  Vic-
 torious" is a valuable addition to literature on
 the new China.
 Jensen was born in Austria and is a phy-
 sician by profession. He came to China in 1939
 with a background of three years of anti-fascist
 struggle in the ranks of the International Bri-
 gades in Republican Spain.
 "In spite of my... practical experience in polit-
 ical struggle on my native continent, I was still

 1951.                         N _E  W
 weighed down by some of the prejudices of the
 'educated European,' " the author writes. "I re-
 garded my mission to China as that of the dis-
 penser of knowledge, teacher and enlightener; I
 thought I knew what I had left behind and what
 I could expect here. Only gradually, through in-
 tense work, did I change from 'adviser'-the ca-
 pacity in which I had come to China-to pupil.
 And I remained a pupil for several years before
 I could  become  useful  in  at  least  a  modest
 measure." (P. 27.)
 Comparing the capitalist jungle of Western
 Europe with the new China, Jensen came to
 see that it is the labouring masses, raised to
 political maturity in the struggle for independ-
 ence and true democracy, that are the creator
 of a genuine human culture.
 ..In the liberated areas, the areas of the Com-
 munist Party and Mao Tse-tung, I found the peo-
 ple  of  our  own  future:  millions  of  workers,
 peasants and soldiers who, in spite of the material
 want still to be overcome, were united by such a
 high level of political consciousness that compared
 with them the entire mode of life of the European
 bourgeoisie and its fellow travellers from the labour
 aristocracy-a life externally comfortable and se-
 cure yet so utterly hopeless-seems like the darkest
 Middle Ages." (P. 27.)
 The people of the liberated areas, Jensen
 found, had not the slightest doubt about the
 nature of imperialism:
 "The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army
 know what they are fighting for, and they are fully
 aware that their struggle is closely linked with
 the struggle of the workers of Europe and Amer-
 ica. In this respect they belong to the most pro-
 gressive forces of the world.... They are the brothers
 of the workers and  peasants who built up the
 European People's Democracies." (P. 36.)
 The Chinese people are inspired and edu-
 cated by the Communist Party, which springs
 from  the  midst of the  people  and  has
 supreme faith in their revolutionary powers.
 The People's Liberation Army grew into a
 formidable adversary of imperialism   and
 Chinese reaction, winning the unbounded love
 and confidence of China's population. Every-
 where the behaviour of its soldiers showed that
 they are fully aware of their political respon-
 sibility and the identity of their interests with
 the interests of all working people.
 The P.L.A. did not have to resort to mobi-
 lization to augment its numbers. The peasants
 flocked to its banners, knowing that in its
 ranks they would be defending their own vital
 interests. Nor did the P.L.A. have to turn to
 other countries for help. The population of the
 liberated areas voluntarily supplied it with
 food and clothing, and armaments it captured
 from the enemy.
 "We are scoring our victories without outside
 military aid. We have achieved great successes and
 are winning because the strength and support of
 the  entire  Chinese  people  are  on  our  side,"
 Chou En-lai told foreign correspondents at a
 press conference in February 1947. (P. 184.)
 Jensen quotes the following eight rules gov-
 erning the behaviour of soldiers toward the
 civilian population:
 "1. If you remove a door from a peasant's home
 to use for a bed, put it back before you leave
 the village.
 "2. Before leaving, tie up the straw you slept
 on and put it back where you took it from. Put
 everything you may take back into its place. Sweep
 the floor before you leave.
 "3. Be modest, truthful and friendly.
 "4. No requisitioning. Pay at market prices for
 everything you buy.
 "5. If you borrow anything, return it.
 "6. If you  cause  some  damage,  compensate
 for it.
 "7. Do not dirty the village.
 "8. Do not annoy women." (P. 175.)'
 Whereas in the liberated areas the peasants,
 workers and intellectuals took over the admin-
 istration of the state and became the masters
 of their own lives, in the Kuomintang-con-
 trolled territory the workers and peasants, that
 is, the bulk of the population, remained down-
 trodden slaves.
 Ruinous rents, landlord usury, crushing
 taxes and outright extortion by Kuomintang
 officials reduced the peasantry to a state of ab-
 ject poverty. Peasants died by the million from
 hunger and disease. As for the Kuomintang
 army, it was founded on a system of forcible
 mobilization, with slave traders trafficking in
 men irrespective of whether they were fit for
 military service or not; the recruits were put
 in irons and otherwise brutally treated, and
 a large number died even before they reached
 training camp.

 1951
 Describing the appalling social conditions
 and the monstrous corruption that was rife
 throughout the Kuomintang military and gov-
 ernmental machine, Jensen shows how the
 Communist Party became the rallying centre
 for patriots in Chiang Kai-shek's rear. It was
 the organizer of the united national front of
 the entire Chinese people.
 s  s  s
 Chiang Kai-shek worked out his strategy
 and tactics in the civil war with the direct
 assistance of such a prominent representative
 of the American military clique and Washing-
 ton ruling circles as General Marshall, the
 present U.S. Secretary of Defence.  Marshall
 came to China as a special representative of
 President Truman shortly after the surrender of
 Japan. In the performance of his mission k e
 was assisted by U.S. Ambassador Hurley and
 General Wedemeyer. In organizing aid to the
 Kuomintang regime which had rotted to the
 core, they
 "assumed the role of proponents of the American
 postwar policy. It was part of that policy to em-
 ploy any feudal dictator to serve as agent of the
 huge commercial concern which is the imperialist
 camp." (P. 131.)
 The Washington diplomatists and strategists
 screened their far-reaching expansionist plans
 with hypocritical protestations of their desire
 to put an end to the civil war in China and
 effect a "reconciliation" between Chiang Kai-
 shek and the Communists. And General Mar-
 shall was sent to China at that time to play
 this part of "peacemaker" and "mediator."
 The practical purpose of these manoeuvres
 was to gain time for military preparations. The
 idea was to complete the reorganization of the
 Kuomintang army, under the direction of
 American instructors, and move it, on Amer-
 ican transport facilities, to advantageous bat-
 tle positions. All told, nineteen armies were
 carried by American ships and aircraft to the
 North and Northeast and to Manchuria. The
 plan was to throw a tight ring around the
 liberated areas. With U.S. aid Chiang Kai-shek
 had thus secured great numerical superiority
 over the P.L.A., and his army was supplied
 with American arms,  in addition to the
 weapons it received after Japan's surrender.
 In July 1946 Chiang Kai-shek, with the as-
 sistance of a staff of American advisers and
 the American troops which had occupied
 Tsingtao and Tientsin, launched his offensive.
 But already by the beginning of  1947 the
 P.L.A. began to strike back and soon it halted
 the Kuomintang drive all along the front. The
 strategic objectives which General Marshall
 had set Chiang Kai-shek were not achieved. In
 the summer of 1947 the P.L.A. mounted a
 counteroffensive that smashed the Kuomintang
 "fortress" and buried Washington's plans un-
 der the ruins. The policy of the Communist
 Party, the strategy and tactics of the People's
 Liberation Army brought the people of China,
 complete victory over the enemy, thereby,
 thwarting the designs of the American monop-
 olies, which sought to establish their undi-
 vided domination over this vast country and
 turn it into a colony of the dollar and a stra-
 tegic springboard for the preparation of a new
 world war.
 As we have already said, Jensen's book is
 not free of flaws. Its main shortcomings are
 the following:
 In discussing feudal relations in China, the
 author approaches the question too narrowly
 when he explains the persistent and stagnant
 nature of these relations by the geographic
 factor and overlooks the fundamental economic
 and political factors. He even loses sight of the
 fact that in the last hundred-odd years feudal
 relations in China were preserved and sus-
 tained by the foreign colonial powers, which
 resorted to every means, force included, to
 prevent China's progress.
 Jensen also fails to see so important a fact
 as the development of capitalism in China.
 True enough, Chinese capitalism came into
 being in the specific conditions of semi-colonial
 subjugation, but for all that capitalist relation-
 ships had already taken shape in the latter
 part of last century. This is of cardinal impor-
 tance, for it helped to undermine feudal rela-
 tionships and accelerated the development of
 the struggle waged by the peasant masses.
 The prime factor, of course, was the appear-
 ance of a working class, which gave leadership
 to the peasantry, became the hegemon of the
 national-liberation movement and ensured the
 victory of the great Chinese people's revolu-
 tion. The triumph of people's democracy in
 China is a fitting culmination of the bitter but
 glorious fight of the masses for independence,

 for the overthrow of the foreign yoke and the
 abolition of the chains of feudal exploitation.
 Lenin's brilliant prediction that "the trans-
 formation of the old Chinese riots into  a
 conscious democratic movement is inevitable,"
 came true. The working class was able to
 unite the basic, predominant forces of the na-
 tion-the peasantry, urban working people and
 the petty and middle bourgeoisie, all of whom
 suffered from the oppression of foreign capital-
 ists and the feudal exploiters.
 Although he gives a correct and vivid pic-
 ture of America's imperialist policy in China,
 Jensen does not lay sufficient emphasis on the
 fact that the American imperialists have always
 been the worst enemies of the Chinese people.
 And yet this circumstance is of particular sig-
 nificance at the present time, when predatory
 American imperialism is seeking to camouflage
 its criminal plans of aggression by the old
 claim that the Wall Street magnates "are not
 interested" in exploiting the Far Eastern coun-
 tries, a claim which the American colonial in-
 terests have used for more than a century to
 conceal their efforts to establish themselves as
 the sole masters of China.
 These shortcomings, however, 'do not nullify
 the merits of Jensen's book, which con-
 tains a wealth of factual data characterizing
 the policy, strategy and tactics of the Commu-
 nist Party of China at the various stages of
 its struggle and its vast constructive activity.
 The value of Jensen's book lies first and
 foremost in the fact that it is the testimony of
 a participant in the historical events described,
 events that culminated in the complete failure
 of the "anti-Communist crusade" in Asia, the
 defeat of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary, fas-
 cist clique, and the collapse of American policy
 as a whole in China and throughout the Far
 East. Under the leadership of the Communist
 Party, the people of China have done away
 once and for all with the yoke of imperialism
 and made their country a bulwark of democ-
 racy and progress in Asia.
 The lessons to be drawn from the events in
 China  are  timely  indeed.  For  not  only
 the reactionary comprador bourgeoisie of the
 colonial and dependent countries whose peo-
 ples have risen to fight for freedom and in-
 dependence, but also the ruling circles of the
 metropolitan countries of Europe have, like
 Chiang Kai-shek, pinned their hopes on Amer-
 ican imperialism. After the second world war,
 the forces of peace and democracy clashed with
 the forces of imperialism on the vast expanses
 of China, with the Kuomintang armies serving
 as American mercenaries and carrying out
 plans drawn up in Washington. The flames of
 civil war in China were fanned by the Wall
 Street moguls, their aim was to strangle the
 people's revolution and turn Asia's greatest
 country into an American colony.
 The book ends with the spring of 1949, when
 the People's Liberation Army redeemed Peking
 and Tientsin and only a few months remained
 until the great day-October 1, 1949-when
 the Chinese People's Republic was proclaimed.
 The victory of the Chinese people has been
 a source of inspiration for all the oppressed
 peoples of Asia, who are waging a struggle for
 freedom and independence, against imperial-
 ism. China's example shows them that if their
 struggle is to succeed, all the national forces
 must be united under the leadership of the
 working class, the most progressive class of
 modern society, headed by the Communist
 Party, the most consistent and steadfast cham-
 pion of the people's interests.
 The heroic fighters and builders of dem-
 ocratic China, Jensen writes,
 "hold a forward outpost in the vanguard of the
 democratic world. ... They are Asia's people of the
 future. They are the focal point of the revolution
 that has stirred a billion men and women in the
 colonies and semi-feudal countries of their conti-
 nent." (Pp. 36-37.)
 Speaking of the machinations of the Amer-
 ican imperialists in Asia and the help they are
 rendering the feudal, comprador elements of
 Indo-China, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philip-
 pines, etc., Jensen points out that the struggle
 of the peoples of these countries against the
 forces of reaction
 "is at different stages of political development, but
 they all are following the same path, the path of
 people's democracy in China." (P. 267.)
 Mao Tse-tung, analyzing the roots of the
 military  and political fiasco that overtook
 Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism in
 China, said in one of his speeches:
 "When the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek
 clique unleashed in 1946 civil war against
 the people throughout the country, it em-
 barked on this gamble ... mainly because it
 relied on the support of American imperial-

 ism, considering the latter extraordinarily
 powerful, equalled by none in the world,
 inasmuch as it possessed the atom bomb....
 This clique harboured insensate hopes of the
 'inevitability of a Soviet-American war' and
 the 'inevitability of a third world war.'
 "After the second world war, this depend-
 ence on American imperialism has become
 a common feature of the reactionary forces
 in all countries....
 "However, is postwar American imperial-
 ism really so powerful as Chiang Kai-shek
 and the reactionaries in the various other
 countries imagine? Can Chiang Kai-shek
 and the reactionaries of the various coun-
 tries really expect unlimited aid from Amer-
 ican imperialism? By no means.... The
 might of the U.S.A. is of a superficial and
 transitory character. American imperialism
 is sitting on a volcano of crisis which threat-
 ens to erupt at any moment. This compelled
 the American imperialists to draw up a plan

 collecting reactionary forces, the scum cast
 out by the peoples....

 is stronger than the imperialist camp. We,

 These words from Comrade Mao Tse-tung's
 report to the Central Committee of the Com-
 munist Party of China on December 25, 1947,
 carry a redoubled impact today.
 Events in Asia and Europe show that the
 arrogant claimants to world dominion have
 everywhere earned the hatred of the peoples,
 who are firmly resolved to fight against the
 instigators of a new war, for world peace.
 The Chinese People's Republic, which has
 entered into fraternal alliance with the Soviet
 Union, has become a mighty peace factor in
 Asia.
 FROM THE EDITORIAL LETTER BOX
 The Canadian Sector`- of the Peace Front
 "IT IS OUR ardent wish that Canada and the
 Soviet Union may be on the same side-the
 side of world peace." This was the keynote of
 the Canadian-Soviet Friendship Month which
 opened in the early part of last November, and
 it expressed the sentiment of thousands of or-
 dinary Canadians.
 Our Society had to cope with many difficul-
 ties in arranging the event. The big dailies and
 the broadcasting stations surrounded our work
 with a conspiracy of silence. Our modest funds
 did not even permit us to advertise the planned
 lectures, talks and meetings. High railway
 fares ruled out a national tour to make ar-
 rangements for the Month. Our country, as you
 know, is a large one.
 All the same, the Month was a success. Some
 thirty public meetings were held. Over six
 thousand people signed or approved a Letter
 to the People of Stalingrad. Thousands saw the
 films and visited the exhibitions illustrating
 Soviet life, art, industry, agriculture  and
 science. In some towns the meetings were so
 large that big theatres had to be hired for them.
 In the prairie provinces farmers and miners
 travelled many miles in the bitter frost to at-
 tend gatherings. Special meetings were ar-
 ranged for women, youth and students. Books
 and magazines about the Soviet Union sold
 like hot cakes at all the meetings. There was a
 particularly big demand for Soviet works of
 fiction.
 Before the Friendship Month our Society
 had only three local committees. By mid-De-
 cember about twenty groups had been formed.
 Furthermore we obtained over 500 new sub-
 scribers in the four weeks to the Society's small
 bulletin, News-Facts.
 All this is very significant in a country like
 Canada, where the government, the radio,

 press, cinema and church are lashing up war
 hysteria and conducting a campaign of vili-
 fication against the Soviet Union, and where
 "emergency measures" in the American style
 threaten all who fight for peace or who desire
 peace. This is because ours is a Society of
 ordinary Canadians.
 The Letter to the People of Stalingrad says:
 "We who sign this letter are not great
 people. We are ordinary Canadians, writ-
 ing to you ordinary citizens of Stalingrad.
 Believe us ... we have no wish to see you
 and your families blown to dust with atomic
 bombs, any more than we ourselves want to
 suffer that fate!"
 The old National Council for Canadian-
 Soviet Friendship was at one time patronized
 by prominent members of the Canadian bour-
 geoisie. These distinguished "friends" have
 long ago ceased to favour co-operation with
 the Soviet Union. In December 1949, the Coun-
 cil decided to form a society of friendship with
 the Soviet Union in which ordinary Canadians
 would take part. The idea found a response
 among workers, farmers and progressive mem-
 bers of the middle classes.

 fu), Kaphen (Kahee) and Chhun-

 Canada is rife with unscrupulous fabrica-
 tions about the Soviet Union. The truth about
 the land of Socialism is practically boycotted
 by the press. But the Canadian people are
 deeply interested in the life of their great
 neighbour.
 The decisive thing for the Canadian masses
 is that the Soviet Union is the most deter-
 mined, the strongest and most reliable cham-
 pion of world peace.
 This truth is shaking the foundations of anti-
 Soviet propaganda.
 Of course, it will take a great deal of work
 before the Canadian-Soviet Friendship Society
 can down the anti-Soviet lies  and slanders
 spread by the warmongers and their abettors
 in Canada. But the motto "friendship with the
 Soviet Union means peace and prosperity" is
 now re-echoing through Canada and finding a
 response among the masses. This too is one of
 the sectors of the great peace front.
