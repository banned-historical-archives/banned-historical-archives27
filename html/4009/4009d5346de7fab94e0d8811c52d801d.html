 CHOU EN-LAI AND THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
 Premier Chou En-lai has been a key member of the
 triumvirate that has ruled in Peking since August 1966,
 and his behavior during the period suggests that he is
 the only reasonable man left at the top of the politi-
 cal heap in China.   He has reached his key position
 after decades of savage struggle and subtle compromise.
 Chou has had more experience in the outside world than
 any other Chinese leader.   By temperament more an ad-
 ministrator than a theoretician, he is a suave, urbane
 pragmatist who has proved his competence and durabil-
 ity in more than 40 years of service to Chinese Com-
 munism.
 Throughout the Cultural Revolution, all regime
 propaganda portrayed Chou as loyally supporting and
 operating on behalf of Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao.   In
 fact, however, Chou has persistently worked to moder-
 ate extreme policies ordered by his superiors and at
 times has even seemed to be working at cross-purposes.
 Although not entirely in step with the Maoists, Chou
 appears publicly as the most active member of the
 leadership and has even taken on some of the ceremo-
 nial duties of the chief-of-state role.   Capable of
 being all things to all men, and possessed of unri-
 valled political skill, Chou--of all those at the top
 of the power structure--has the best prospect to sur-
 vive in authority.
 Chou's Character and Background
 Since August 1966, Chou En-
 lai has appeared to be firmly en-
 trenched as the number three man
 in China, a ranking he had held
 for years.  At the eight mass
 rallies last fall and in all simi-
 lar turnouts of the leadership
 this year, he has been consist-
 ently ranked directly after Mao
 and his heir apparent, Lin Piao.
 Chou's prominence derives in large
 Page  1
 part from his position at the sum-
 mit of China's huge government
 structure and from his role as
 chief spokesman for the regime's
 policies.   As premier, Chou im-
 plements policies that have been
 decided upon in the inner councils
 of the regime where his voice un-
 questionably carries great weight.
 Chou's characteristically
 practical attitude toward problems
 is legendary.   Soviet officials,

 for example, have said they would
 rather deal with Chou than almost
 any other Chinese leader, because
 they consider him more flexible
 and intelligent.   He has demon-
 strated an uncanny knack for emerg-
 ing on the right side of issues
 and riding out crises.   In his
 ability to survive in the jungle
 of intraparty politics, he has
 been likened to Mikoyan.   Time
 and again he has been called on
 to undertake delicate negotiations
 and to rationalize embarrassing
 policy retreats.  While many of
 his colleagues in Peking are
 rigid and often press for extreme
 measures, Chou almost invariably
 emerges as the exponent of the
 possible.
 Inside China, Chou is a
 much-admired and popular figure,
 and he has long been Peking's
 best salesman with foreigners.
 His experience in the
 Western world has given him a
 broader, more cosmopolitan out-
 look than that possessed by any
 other Chinese Communist leader.
 When he chooses, Chou can be
 sociable, affable, and informal,
 and is not above enjoying a stiff
 drink on occasion--a display of
 humanity his more wooden col-
 leagues would not dare to permit
 themselves.
 He has always been somewhat
 of an anomaly in Mao's entourage.
 He was born into a well-to-do
 east China Mandarin family and
 was steeped in the tradition of
 Confucianism--in contrast to other
 Chinese Communist leaders, most of
 whom spring from more humble be-
 ginnings.  At the age of 15, Chou
 entered a secondary school in
 Tientsin sponsored  by American
 missionaries and, upon graduation
 in 1917, studied in Japan and
 later in Germany and France--
 where he also worked as a miner
 and factory laborer.   While in
 France, he associated with several
 other men who also rose to the top
 ranks of the Chinese Communist
 Party  (CCP)  in later years.
 Back in China, Chou became
 involved in patriotic student
 agitation--along with his future
 wife--and both were imprisoned
 in Tientsin in 1919-20.   In 1925-
 26, during the period of the Kuo-
 mintang  (KMT)  - CCP entente, Chou
 was acting director of the po-
 litical department at Whampoa
 Military Academy, China's West
 Point. Later he served as a cap-
 able army commander.   In the early
 1930s, he supported two of Mao's
 rivals for the leadership of the
 CCP, not joining Mao's camp un-
 til after Mao had seized control
 of the party at the Tsunyi Con-
 ference which took place early in
 the course of the Long March.
 For the remainder of this ordeal,
 Chou proved his usefulness to Mao
 and he played a key role during
 the period of exile in Yenan.
 During the war years Chou
 handled contacts with the Ameri-
 cans in Chungking and later served
 as chief negotiator for the Com-
 munists in dealing with the KMT
 and the US in 1945-46.   In 1949-50

 he had a leading role in the hard
 bargaining that eventually pro-
 duced the Sino-Soviet Mutual De-
 fense Treaty.   Chou was the cen-
 tral figure on the Chinese side
 in the talks that led to the Ko-
 rean and Vietnamese settlements
 of 1953-54.
 In all of these negotiations,
 Chou proved to be tough, careful,
 and.patient.   He scored what was
 probably his :biggest international
 public relations success with his
 brilliant performance at the Afro-
 Asian Conference at Bandung in
 1955.   Beneath his skillfully
 projected exterior of reason and
 pragmatism, however, Chou is prob-
 ably as ruthless as any of his
 colleagues.   This has been amply
 demonstrated by his survival
 through three decades of service
 in his precarious post so near the
 summit of power in the CCP.   Chou
 has served as China's premier
 since establishment of the regime
 in 1949 and was concurrently for-
 eign minister until 1958.
 Chou En-lai's Official Status
 Chou has for years followed
 a bone-crushing schedule of offi-
 cial duties that would tax the
 energy and constitution of many

 younger men; a typical work day
 runs from 11:00 a.m. until two or
 three the next morning.   These
 duties include frequent ceremonial
 appearances, the management of
 China's huge government machinery
 in ever-increasing detail, and a
 prime public (and doubtlessly be-
 hind-the-scenes) role in the Cul-
 tural Revolution.   During the
 course of the Cultural Revolution,
 moreover, additional responsibil-
 ity has devolved on him almost by
 default, for he is the only one
 of the ruling triumvirate with
 sufficient vigor to engage in the
 day-to-day direction of the gigan-
 tic government machinery.
 The evident importance of
 these activities has led some ob-
 servers to judge that his politi-
 cal stature is  rowin
 This probably reflects a
 widespread   view in the Chinese
 foreign service, not untinged by
 wishful thinking.   Similar views
 had been expressed by Chinese of-
 ficials overseas as far back as
 October.   British diplomats in
 Peking have judged that, despite
 the persistent attacks on men
 identified with Chou, the premier
 was holding on with a fair degree
 of confidence, and continuing his
 efforts to impose order on the
 social turmoil of the Cultural
 Revolution.
 Chou's formal ranking as
 number three in the ruling trium-
 virate has been reinforced on
 countless occasions in the propa-
 ganda treatment of leadership
 gatherings.  He has appeared at
 each turnout of the elite inner
 circle in the last several months,
 always listed just after Mao and
 Lin when they are present (the
 protocol established in August
 1966),  or heading the group in
 their absence.   In recent months
 when Lin has appeared in public
 without Mao, Chou has been at his
 elbow--most recently at a rally on
 25 July.
 Chou appears to be taking on
 additional formal functions.  When
 Peking was indicating its support
 of the Arab nations during the
 recent Middle East crisis, Premier
 Chou not only spoke for the na-
 tion and government, but received
 correspondence from Arab leaders.
 On 27 May, Foreign Minister Chen
 Yi received diplomatic representa-
 tives from six Arab nations and
 the Palestine Liberation Organiza-
 tion "on behalf of Chou En-lai."
 Again, during the state visit of
 Zambia's President Kaunda to China
 on 20-24 June, Chou appeared to
 occupy the roles of both chief of
 government and chief of state,
 as does Kaunda.   He greeted, wined,
 and dined Kaunda, held summit
 talks with him, gave speeches on
 the occasion, and presided at the
 signing of a trade agreement.
 Since Peking has made no attempt
 to provide an alternate stand-in
 for the denigrated Liu Shao-chi,
 foreign diplomats in Peking have
 been led to assume that Chou is
 now acting as Peking's chief of
 state, adding one more time-con-
 suming job.
 As if this were not enough,
 there have been several reports
 since January that Chou has taken

 on part of the day-to-day adminis-
 trative duties of those of his
 subordinate officials on the State
 Council who are now in trouble
 with the inquisitors of the Cul-
 tural Revolution.   In a major un-
 published speech on 30 April, Chou
 stated that lie had assumed direct
 management of the state offices
 for foreign affairs, for finance
 and trade, and for agriculture
 and forestry, thus filling in for
 the beleaguered Chen Yi, Li Hsien-
 nien, and Tan Chen-lin.
 Chou's Role in the Cultural
 Revolution
 In addition to his full-time
 formal functions, Chou has been
 pictured in poster reports as
 serving as chief executive offi-
 cer for the Cultural Revolution,
 ordering military actions, cajol-
 ing revolutionary rebels to ac-
 cept guidance, setting down pol-
 icy, and negotiating agreements
 between contending factions--all
 this professedly in compliance
 with the policies of Mao and Lin.
 In his role of Cultural Revolu-
 tion trouble shooter, Chou has
 personally met numerous delega-
 tions from the provinces, and
 several central committee deci-
 sions or directives endorsing or
 criticizing provincial leaders
 have been issued in his name.
 Chou's policy statements
 have fairly constantly supported
 the more rational options, such
 as the three--way alliances to end
 dissension and restore order,
 calls for the reopening of schools
 this summer to absorb restless
 youth,  and statements concerning
 central committee approval for
 moderate economic policies to pro-
 tect industrial and agricultural
 production.   Both his public and
 private speeches have often been
 treated as major statements of
 Cultural Revolution policy.
 After the collapse of the
 provincial party machinery in Jan-
 uary 1967, it was Chou's task to
 try to keep the government ma-
 chinery intact in the large ma-
 jority of provinces where the
 Maoists were unable to form ac-
 ceptable "revolutionary" govern-
 ments.  Chou's authority in deal-
 ing with the new leaders, mainly
 local military commanders, was
 undercut in April, however, when
 several arrangements he had made
 were contested by Maoist mili-
 tants and overturned by the cen-
 tral committee.  Also, in May
 and June, radical Maoist leaders
 such as Kang Sheng, Chen Po-ta,
 and Madame Mao for the first time
 began to be publicly associated
 with the settlement of some pro-
 vincial problems.
 Chou remained very active
 in provincial affairs, however.
 In April he flew to Canton to
 endorse leaders of the Canton Mil-
 itary Region who had been criti-
 cized by Maoists for supporting
 "conservative" groups.  As dis-
 orders spread in Kwangtung and
 Hunan provinces--both in the ju-
 risdiction of the Canton Military
 Region--Chou personally inter-
 vened.   In late July he ordered
 the 47th Army to take control of
 Hunan away from the Hunan Mili-
 tary District, and several times
 during August Chou issued orders

 to Red Guard groups and local mil-
 itary authorities in the Canton
 area in unsuccessful attempts to
 stem the spread of violence.
 Chou's most dramatic trouble-shoot-
 ing act in the post-April turmoil
 was to arrange the release of two
 high officials who were being de-
 tained in Wuhan by the local mil-
 itary commander.
 Attacks on Chou En-lai
 In the early months of the
 Cultural Revolution, Chou and the
 men working for him in the gov-
 ernment machinery were left
 strictly alone by Maoist leaders
 and Red Guards, who were then
 concentrating their fire on lead-
 ers in the party apparatus.   Soon
 after a crucial high-level meet-
 ing in Peking in October, how-
 ever, Red Guard groups launched
 a major onslaught against vice
 premiers and government ministry
 officials.   Luring late October
 and early November the Guards
 broke into government buildings,
 paraded and manhandled many of-
 ficials--at least one minister
 died at their hands--and plas-
 tered the capital with vicious
 poster attacks on proteges of
 Chou.   Chou himself did not be-
 come a major target, but the sud-
 den attack on his personal base
 of power strongly suggested that
 he had clashed with Maoist lead-
 ers at the October meeting.
 Attacks on government, as
 distinct from party, officials
 were renewed in the first two
 weeks of January, but subsided
 quickly when Chou, seconded by
 Madame Mao and Cultural Revolu-
 tion Group head Chen Po-ta,
 Page  6
 spoke out strongly at Red Guard
 rallies in defense of the vice
 premiers under attack; Madame
 Mao and Chen also used the occa-
 sion to praise Chou.   Once again,
 the episode suggested that Chou
 had incurred the wrath of the
 Maoists but had weathered the
 storm because they were convinced
 that he was needed to hold the
 country together.   Chou was almost
 certainly the architect of the
 moderate policies pursued by the
 regime in late January and Feb-
 ruary, a period when his prestige
 and authority seemed to be excep-
 tionally great.
 By March, however, the Mao-
 ists realized that the Cultural
 Revolution to which they were com-
 mitted was losing its steam, and
 they decided to open the throttle
 wide again, regardless of the
 cost.  This decision, reached at
 reportedly stormy meetings of the
 politburo standing committee dur-
 ing the first two weeks of March,
 was immediately followed by heavy
 and sustained Red Guard attacks,
 through posters and rallies, on
 policies associated primarily with
 Chou's name, and on men who worked
 for him.
 As in earlier periods, the
 Maoists avoided launching direct
 attacks on Chou himself, but the
 existence of a concealed threat
 to Chou's position has been re-
 flected in staunch defenses of him
 against unidentified attackers.
 A poster put up by the powerful
 Peking Aviation Institute Red
 Guards on 18 March stated that
 Chou "is Chairman Mao's close
 comrade-in-arms.... Bombarding

 Chou En-lai is the same as bom-
 barding the proletarian head-
 quarters, the same as opposing
 the revolution."   Similar de-
 fenses have often been publicized
 in major Red Guard newspapers.
 A poster of 31 May reported
 a more high-powered defense.  Ac-
 cording to this account, Chen
 Po-ta and three other top Cultural
 Revolution leaders met with Red
 Guard representatives and critics
 of Chou, and told them not to
 criticize him.   Chen Po-ta said,
 "Chou is respected abroad as well
 as at home .... He is a responsible
 person who is carrying out the
 policies of Chairman Mao and Vice
 Chairman Lin.  Nobody is allowed
 to find fault with him."
 Chou's Defense of His Allies
 Chou has repeatedly come to
 the public defense of his own as-
 sociates who have been under spo-
 radic criticism for many months,
 and this has undoubtedly con-
 tributed to the ire of his an-
 tagonists.
 On 20 May,  for example, he
 told a conference that Marshal
 Yeh Chien-ying was loyal to Mao,
 and "good for the most part,"
 that he had performed signal serv-
 ices for Mao up through 1966,
 and had made mistakes in Szechwan
 and Tsinghai early this year
 (when he reportedly backed the
 PLA's suppression of rebel vio-
 lence) only because he had been
 misled by reports from lower or-
 ganizations.   Moreover, Chou
 openly defended Li Hsien-nien,
 the finance minister, on 11 June,
 as he had done implicitly at a
 meeting on 6 April.
 The official for whom Chou
 has accepted the greatest politi-
 cal risk, however, has been Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi.  According to
 pamphlets  passed out on 12 June
 by Red Guards at the No. 2 For-
 eign Languages Institute, Chou
 presided at a rally of 10,000 on
 24 January at which Chen.Yi made
 a public self-criticism.  Chou im-
 mediately characterized this self-
 abasement as "exceedingly good,"
 apparently trying by this means
 to end the vitriolic public cam-
 paign against Chen Yi.  When it
 resumed with greater ferocity in
 March and April, Chou again rose
 to the defense.
 Subsequently, Chou has on
 three occasions faced down Red
 Guard "rebels" from the Foreign
 Language Institute and other or-
 ganizations connected with for-
 eign affairs--twice following un-
 ruly mob "invasions" of buildings
 of the Ministry of Foreign Af-
 fairs.  Angrily rebuking the
 Guards for breaking into the of-
 fices, Chou refused their demands
 for the ouster of Chen and other
 officials and bluntly told them
 that they were "not the politburo.
 Don't try to pressure me.  That is
 quite unacceptable."
 Most recently, according to
 news posted by rebels in the 7th
 Ministry of Machine Building,
 which oversees missile production,
 Chou received a group of rebels on
 1 June and criticized a rival
 rebel group from the 7th ministry
 for having attacked Nieh Jung-chen,

 until recently in over-all charge
 of advanced weapons development.
 Chou then took this occasion to
 extend his protection to all vice
 chairmen of the Military Affairs
 Committee, vice premiers, and
 politburo members by objecting to
 all poster criticism of this
 group.
 Chou and the Wuhan Incident
 New efforts by the Maoists
 to accelerate the Cultural Revo-
 lution during July resulted in a
 gesture of open defiance of Pe-
 king by the commander of the stra-
 tegic Wuhan Military Region.   Chou
 was deeply involved in this un-
 precedented and complicated prob-
 lem.
 Another drive against the
 discredited Liu Shao-chi had been
 launched just before the middle
 of July.   Official broadcasts ex-
 plained that this was necessary
 because Liu still had "henchmen"
 in nearly every sector of soci-
 ety--including the army--who must
 be brought down.  At the same
 time, the Red Guards were given
 new encouragement to press ahead
 with their destructive revolu-
 tionary campaign.   In short, of-
 ficials at the center and in the
 provinces who had survived ear-
 lier attacks were confronted with
 a new personal threat--in the
 midst of spreading disorder and
 violence which promised to de-
 velop into ruinous chaos.
 The Wuhan commander responded
 by seizing and humiliating two
 key officials sent out from Pe-
 king.  This was probably intended
 as a gesture of protest against
 the Cultural Revolution rather
 than an attempt to raise the flag
 of rebellion.   It was an unprece-
 dented challenge of the most se-
 rious sort, however, and may have
 marked a definitive turning point
 in the course of China's internal
 political struggle.
 A strong central authority
 and a united leadership would have
 reacted by immediately removing
 the defiant official and making a
 public example of him.  Peking
 did neither.   It was more than two
 weeks before the dismissal of the
 Wuhan commander was announced
 and no further punishment for him
 was publicized.  The circumstances
 suggest that the reason for this
 failure to deal promptly and "de-
 cisively" with the situation in
 Wuhan resulted from pressure
 brought to bear by other key re-
 gional military leaders.
 Chou was apparently instru-
 mental in obtaining the release
 of the two detained officials
 and probably had a major, if not
 primary, role in negotiations be-
 tween Maoists and the military
 concerning a solution.   In this,
 he was supporting Mao and Lin,
 but he probably attempted at the
 same time to maintain ties and
 influence with those opposing
 them.  The result of the bargain-
 ing was a compromise--unsatisfac-
 tory to all parties concerned--
 which was soon followed by a new
 and more violent phase of the
 struggle.

 Chou's Current Position and
 Prospects
 Chou's toughness, caution,
 and willingness to use the knife
 when necessary have served him
 well in the vicious infighting
 that has been part of the Cul-
 tural Revolution from the outset.
 Throughout this period of offi-
 cially encouraged violence and
 disorder, Chou has consistently
 been the spokesman for moderation.
 He has repeatedly defended like-
 minded adherents and allies within
 the bureaucracy and military es-
 tablishment.
 Chou's ability to appear oc-
 casionally out of step with the
 Cultural Revolution in some re-
 spects while retaining a position
 close to the top of the political
 hierarchy is a reflection both of
 his adroitness and of the fact
 that he is as close to being the
 indispensible man as any official
 in China today.  Because he has
 not been identified with the
 worst excesses of the Cultural
 Revolution, Chou is probably the
 only high-ranking official still
 in a position to talk with all
 groups engaged in the current
 struggle for supremacy.  Barring
 a collapse of central authority
 and a descent into civil war that
 destroys the Communist regime en-
 tirely, Chou can be expected to
 end up in a position at or near
 the top of the political hierarchy
 that eventually emerges from the
