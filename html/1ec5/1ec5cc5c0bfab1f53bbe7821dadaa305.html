 broad scope of reform in recent years has forcefully reasserted its
 influence. This group, which for convenience both we and the Chinese call
 "conservative," consists of leaders who initially supported Deng Xiaoping's
 reform program but have grown alarmed by the direction of reforms in
 recent years, which they fear threatens party authority and China's
 socialist system. Among the conservatives are many of China's most
 influential party figures: Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, Bo Yibo, Wang Zhen,
 Yang Shangkun, Hu Qiaomu, and Deng Liqun. Some of these men are
 close confidants of Deng Xiaoping, others-especially Peng Zhen-long-
 time rivals.
 Although they share concerns, we believe the conservatives represent at
 most a loose coalition. Their success in imposing ideological strictures on
 reform and in increasing the power of their supporters at the expense of
 younger reform leaders will depend largely on whether they can maintain
 their uncharacteristic unity or, as in the past, are outmaneuvered by Deng
 Xiaoping.
 In our view, this group can be roughly subdivided into economic thinkers,
 party stalwarts and military conservatives, and ideologues. Economic
 conservatives want tighter central control over the economy. They believe
 some liberalization was needed but that in many ways reforms have gone
 dangerously far. Their concern is that the loosening of central control will
 lead to economic and social disorder. They represent organizations such as
 the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance whose
 bureaucratic clout stands to be reduced by reform. In addition, they draw
 support from sectors of the economy where central planning has tradition-
 ally played an important role and where, consequently, officials are more
 comfortable with that approach. These include heavy industry, foreign
 trade, and banking.
 Party stalwarts, in many ways the political mirror image of the economic
 specialists, emphasize the need for a strong party role in economic and
 government affairs. They oppose some of Deng's proposed political reforms
 and fear the political fallout of economic reforms. Party stalwarts reflect
 the views of the many party cadres unhappily anticipating the lowered

 profile and reduced powers of the party under reform. We believe that, at
 the middle levels of the party, such cadres may well be a majority. Many
 within the military and security services are also conservatives of this
 stripe, attracted by the emphasis on discipline and dedication.
 The ideologues see themselves as guardians of Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy;
 they probably have less influence on policy than the other groups, but have
 frequently been the most outspoken and troublesome-in part because
 reformers are, in our judgment, vulnerable on ideological grounds. The
 institutional base of the ideologues is primarily within the propaganda
 apparatus. They also have adherents among the older generation of
 academics, artists and writers, and other intellectuals.
 Although they have not been dominant at the center for several years,
 conservatives have a number of ways to influence policy:
 ? The most effective probably is to take advantage of their personal
 relationships with Deng Xiaoping to influence him, appealing to concerns
 he shares or raising problems they believe he cannot afford to ignore.
 ? Conservatives can employ the wide networks of contacts they have built
 up over many years to obstruct or vitiate reform, drawing on the support
 of those who feel threatened by reform.
 ? By harping on acknowledged problems that have arisen in the course of
 reform, the conservatives have had some success in forcing modification
 or delay of reform measures.
 ? Conservatives have used propaganda channels to press their case against
 some reforms and to challenge them on ideological grounds.
 In our judgment, the 13th Party Congress, scheduled for October, will test
 the strength and cohesion of both the reform and conservative wings of the
 party. Both sides will be seeking to win personnel battles and to put their
 mark on the document the congress will issue. We believe key points on the
 conservative agenda include:
 ? Slowing market-oriented economic reform and limiting price reform to
 adjustments that reflect scarcity.
 ? Strengthening controls over agricultural production, rural industry, and
 rural credit.

 ? Limiting management reform in factories and preserving a greater role
 for party committees.
 ? Tightening the reins on intellectuals and restricting investigative press
 stories that cast party officials in an unfavorable light.
 ? Increasing political study sessions in schools and the workplace, and
 reinstituting political requirements for such things as graduate study.
 Conservatives and reformers are closer on foreign policy issues, and we do
 not expect foreign policy to become a contentious issue at the congress,
 although some conservatives would probably prefer to keep greater dis-
 tance from the West and pursue a harder line on regional issues, such as re-
 lations with Japan. Similarly, there is no great disagreement on policy
 toward the military, but the conservative wing might press to give the
 military a greater voice to ensure a powerful political ally.
 The conservative wing has inherent weaknesses that have prevented it from
 overturning Deng's reform program. Despite recent successes, we believe
 these weaknesses will persist. Among the most important are:
 ? Lack of a strong leader. The conservatives have no one who combines the
 stature, vision, connections, and energy of Deng Xiaoping. As a result,
 the conservatives have been unable to sustain a united front against
 reformers, often bickering over who should call the shots and what goals
 take priority.
 ? Tired policies. Conservative policies tend to be reactive and negative--
 conservatives know what they do not like but offer no alternative. They
 favor policies and methods-tighter central control and motivation by
 exhortation, not incentive-that, in the eyes of many Chinese, are proven
 failures.
 ? Age. Most conservative leaders are in their seventies and eighties, and
 many are in ill health. Conservative leaders may not have time, even were
 they to attain sufficient power, to install a successor generation.

 Despite the weaknesses of the conservatives, we believe conflict between
 the reformers and conservatives will remain a feature of Chinese politics.
 Conservative misgivings about reform reflect fundamental social ten-
 sions-many people are frightened by the strains of modernization and
 reform. As party elders die, we expect the nature of conservatism will
 change, becoming less concerned with ideology and more with defending
 party privileges and power. The basic conflict will persist, however, and
 reformers will have to find ways to compromise with conservative constitu-
 encies and concerns that will, in our judgment, remain too powerful to
 ignore.

 China: The Conservative
 Challenge to Reform
 Since the fall 1986 student demonstrations and the
 ouster of Hu Yaobang in January (see inset), a group
 of party leaders whom both we and the Chinese tend
 for convenience to call the "conservatives" has force-
 fully reasserted its influence, exercising, we believe,
 greater power and authority than it has enjoyed for
 years. Capitalizing on the opportunity, these party
 elders have attempted to impose ideological strictures
 on reformist policy and reduce the power of younger
 leaders unsympathetic to their concerns. It is unclear
 how successful they have been, and it probably will
 not become apparent until the horsetrading over key
 personnel decisions is concluded and the preparations
 for the 13th Party Congress in fall 1987 unfold. Much
 will depend on whether they can maintain their
 uncharacteristic cohesiveness or whether Deng
 Xiaoping is able to co-opt or coerce some of them, as
 he has in the past.
 The most prominent of these leaders-Chen Yun,
 Peng Zhen, Wang Zhen, Bo Yibo, and Deng Liqun-
 represent at most, in our judgment, a loose and
 shifting coalition bound by certain attitudes and
 policy preferences, rather than consistent and clearcut
 ideological tenets. These men strongly supported the
 reform package launched by Deng Xiaoping in the
 late 1970s, and they continue to support some re-
 forms. In our view, what justifies calling them conser-
 vatives is their opposition to the direction of reform in
 recent years.
 by retiring members of the old guard-like them-
 selves. Despite the elders' lipservice to the ideal of
 turning the reins over to a new generation, we believe
 many see this policy not only as a threat to their
 position and prestige, but also as a ploy by Deng and
 his supporters to monopolize power.
 Underlying conservative preferences is what Deng has
 termed "nostalgic leftism," a yearning for the Com-
 munism of the 1950s, a period many of these leaders
 hark back to as a golden age for China. Although not
 "Maoists" in the radical leftist sense that that term
 has taken on since the Cultural Revolution, many see
 themselves as the spiritual heirs of the early Mao,
 whose policies were less extreme. Several key points at
 which conservative and reformist views diverge
 emerge from conservatives' writings and speeches:
 ? In economics, conservative leaders prefer a mix that
 depends more on central planning and direction and
 less on market forces. This preference is dictated
 partly by ideology-a strong market role looks like
 capitalism-but also by a fear of the "chaos" of the
 market. Chen Yun's famous description of the
 economy as a "bird in a cage," with the cage
 representing central control, sums up their
 philosophy.
 ? Conservatives tend to be ideological hardliners,
 believers in the Chinese brand of Marxism-
 Leninism and intolerant of any suggestion that
 Marxism is outmoded and inappropriate.
 Conservative "Ideology": Nostalgic Leftism
 In general, these conservative party elders fear that
 increased experimentation with market forces, the
 devolution of decisionmaking authority, and the loos-
 ening of restraints on intellectual debate threaten to
 undermine the ideological underpinnings and eventu-
 ally the power of the Communist Party. Most also
 resist Deng's efforts to rejuvenate China's leadership
 ? A corollary to their ideological inflexibility is a
 strident insistence on party control and a readiness
 to see threats to that control. Conservatives favor
 retention of strong party control in such areas as
 education or factory management, where reformers
 have been moving to reduce it.

 Causes of Hu Yaobang's Downfall
 Although the student demonstrations were the imme-
 diate pretext for dismissing Hu Yaobang as General
 Secretary, in fact his fall was the result of a number
 of factors working together:
 ? We view Hu as in part the victim of his own
 idiosyncratic personality. His independence, failure
 to consult on major decisions and propensity for
 verbal gaffes-such as his remarks on China's
 policy on nuclear-capable ships that led to cancella-
 tion of a US ship visit-alarmed and alienated
 many senior leaders.
 ? Hu's well-documented tolerance for intellectual
 dissent and his-to many leaders-reckless lack of
 concern about party control also contributed to his
 downfall and probably helped undermine Deng's
 confidence in him.
 ? Hu pushed policies that many powerful elders
 opposed. High on the list of his alleged mistakes
 were attempts to retire these men, but the elders
 also objected to his support for political reforms
 and aspects of his foreign policy, especially his
 strong advocacy of closer ties to Japan.
 ? According to the party documents leaked to the
 press, Hu's interference in areas such as economic
 policy, where he had little expertise, upset even
 reformist figures like Zhao Ziyang. Many believed
 that Hu pushed the system faster than was safe.
 ? The same documents suggest that Hu angered
 many by his active promotion of his own proteges,
 which in the post-Cultural Revolution Chinese
 ? One consequence of traditionalist fears about party
 control is hypersensitivity about the party's image.
 The conservatives believe that the party should not
 tolerate open criticism of its motives or policy line,
 even when the criticism is accurate, because that
 might undermine faith in the party's leadership and
 historical mission. This attitude is most apparent in
 political context occasioned alarm that Hu might
 be trying to monopolize power for his own faction.
 He also failed to recognize the necessity of allow-
 ing his opponents a portion of patronage jobs to
 reduce their animosity.
 ? In the spring of 1986, Hu and others mounted a
 harsh and temporarily successful attack on conser-
 vative opponents that included arresting and sen-
 tencing some of their family members for corrup-
 tion. This drastic action, plus the flood of extreme
 political and economic reform proposals that sur-
 faced in the media after the conservatives were
 cowed, apparently succeeded in uniting and galva-
 nizing the loose conservative coalition.
 ? Ultimately, Hu fell because he lost the confidence
 of Deng Xiaoping.
 the party elders, who include some of
 Denosest friends and advisers, made clear
 their implacable opposition to Hu, which called
 into question Hu's ability to lead after Deng's
 death. Deng also agreed with these men that Hu
 had allowed party control to slip too far. Finally,
 Hu in our view became more of a liability than an
 asset to Deng, and                           he
 compounded the error by suggesting on at least one
 occasion that Deng should retire, taking other party
 elders with him-and leaving Hu and his proteges
 in charge. Deng reacted angrily to the suggestion
 and withdrew his support, effectively putting the
 stamp on the decision to oust Hu.
 conservative approaches to policies on intellectuals.
 For example, in April conservative ideologues led
 by Deng Liqun denounced as "an effort at rebel-
 lion" a 1984 Writer's Congress that had officially
 approved creative freedom.

 ? Conservatives distrust the reliance on material in-
 centives to promote economic development that has
 characterized reform policies; they believe in the
 efficacy of indoctrination and propaganda, and in
 the rightness of applying political requirements in
 such areas as college admissions. In recent months,
 conservative spokesmen such as Yu Qiuli, Politburo
 member and Director of the Army's General Politi-
 cal Department, have held up the People's Libera-
 tion Army (PLA) as an exemplar of self-sacrifice
 and other "revolutionary values" to offset what they
 believe is excessive reliance on material incentives
 by reformists.
 ? Although closer to reformers on foreign policy
 issues than on most domestic issues, the conserva-
 tives generally would prefer that China distance
 itself from the West, especially the United States.
 This does not imply a pro-Soviet stance, but proba-
 bly would mean greater Chinese efforts to demon-
 strate a balanced line between the two superpowers.
 Conservatives probably would follow an even tough-
 er line than reformers on some regional issues, such
 as Sino-Japanese relations-a reflection of their
 greater insularity and Sinocentrism.
 In part these differences reflect a generational gap,
 we believe. Most prominent conservatives are in their
 seventies or eighties, in contrast to the reformists, who
 can boast several leaders in their fifties and sixties. In
 recent months some younger conservative leaders
 have emerged as the reformers' grip on the personnel
 process has loosened, and we believe that conservative
 views still have strong support among this generation
 throughout the party, government, and Army. State-
 ments by Chinese leaders and analysis of press arti-
 cles indicate, however, that conservative views attract
 relatively few from the younger generation of Chinese
 and are held in especially low regard among the better
 educated.
 role for an opposition. For convenience, we have
 distinguished three principal groupings within the
 conservative camp-economic conservatives, party
 stalwarts and military conservatives, and ideologues.
 These groupings are based on the members' chief
 concerns and policy interests, although the distinc-
 tions are artificial and there is a great deal of overlap.
 Moreover, a leader can be conservative on some issues
 and support reform on others; this is particularly true
 of a number of old associates of Deng.
 Key Conservatives in Economic Policy
 Politburo Standing Committee member Chen Yun, at
 82 considered the dean of China's economists, is the
 leading figure in this group, whose main quarrel with
 reform is that it has taken China too far in the
 direction of a market economy.
 Chen has said that he fears reforms may
 create an economy the party cannot control; like
 many of the conservatives, he believes that anarchy is
 never very far away in China and can be prevented
 only by firm control.
 Chen and his supporters even have doubts about
 recent agricultural policies, the centerpiece of reform-
 ist success. They regard self-sufficiency in grain as
 critical, reflecting a deep-seated fear that a fall in
 grain production could trigger social instability. After
 grain production fell in 1985, Chen delivered a speech
 at the Party Conference of Delegates that sharply
 criticized reformers for having paid too little attention
 to grain production in their rush to promote rural
 industries and a more varied rural economy.
 Chen is the most prestigious of the conservative old
 guard; he is the senior Communist cadre alive today,
 having become a Politburo member in the 1930s,
 years before any other living leader. He also enjoys
 considerable respect because of his opposition to
 Mao's disastrous economic theories. Indeed, Chen
 may be the only leader whose personal prestige rivals
 Deng Xiaoping's. Because of this, we believe he has
 been able on occasion to force modifications in reform
 policies and to criticize Deng for usurping authority.
 Although the conservatives have not been dominant at
 the center for at least five years, they represent
 important constituencies in various segments of the
 party and government apparatus. This allows them to
 exert influence in a system that has no institutional

 Chen Yun (left) and Wang Zhen, at the Septem-
 ber 1985 party conference. Wang retired from the
 Politburo, probably unwillingly, at this meeting.
 Chen, however, has not been able to challenge Deng's
 control. He lacks broad support within the party
 bureaucracy, and has not demonstrated Deng's skill at
 building coalitions and holding them together. More-
 over, Chen is in failing health, according to a number
 of press accounts. He has appeared rarely in public in
 recent months and, while still a rallying point for like-
 minded officials, may be increasingly less active.
 Two other leaders who, in our judgment, share many
 of Chen's beliefs are Advisory Commission Perma-
 nent Vice Chairman Bo Yibo and Vice Premier Yao
 Yi1in. Of the two, Bo, 80, is the more powerful. An
 active party member since the 1920s, Bo can claim
 membership among the elite revolutionary founders;
 he may have inherited Chen's mantle as the leading
 conservative economic theorist. Bo played a leading
 role in Hu Yaobang's downfall,
 and has been an active and vocal advocate
 of the conservative viewpoint since then. According to
 a Hong Kong press account, Bo accused Hu of
 maiguo (sell out the country) politics, implying that
 Hu espoused policies that betrayed Chinese ideology
 and interests. Bo has since said that China still has
 problems with maiguo economics-which we believe
 is a slap at Acting General Secretary Zhao Ziyang,
 who, as Premier since 1980, has been a principal
 architect of the economic policies.
 Yao lacks the stature of Bo and Chen, being a few
 years too young at 70 to qualify as a revolutionary
 elder, but he is an important supporter of conservative
 policies at the level just below the top. He is a close
 associate of Chen Yun. This June, Yao was put in
 charge of the State Planning Commission, where he
 had served from 1980 to 1983. We believe Yao's
 appointment was part of a conservative drive to
 reestablish control over economic policy.
 Vice Premier Li Peng is one younger official who, in
 our view, generally supports the conservative line. Li
 has been prominently mentioned by some Chinese
 officials as a candidate to succeed Zhao Ziyang as
 premier, assuming Zhao relinquishes that job and
 keeps the top party post, as seems likely. Li believes in
 modernization, especially technological moderniza-
 tion, but favors greater central control over China's
 economy than do reformers. Li is also conservative on
 social issues, especially education, one of his areas of
 responsibility.                        Li was
 behind a recent decision to set up a "Youth Ideologi-
 cal Research Center," a sort of "detoxification" cen-
 ter to reeducate students who may have been influ-
 enced by Western ideas while studying abroad.
 There are signs that conservative economic thinkers
 have regained some clout in setting policy. Although
 reform is being stressed again in the press and is on
 the agenda for the congress, the reforms being dis-
 cussed are much less far reaching than those floated
 last year; several resemble policies of the early years
 of reform that many of the group we label conserva-
 tive supported. For example, price and ownership
 reform have been deemphasized, and attention has

 shifted to management reforms. Although some of
 this shift probably is a cautious response to economic
 problems by reformers themselves, we believe re-
 newed conservative authority is an important factor.'
 The influence of this group extends beyond economic
 issues. When Yao Yilin took over the State Planning
 Commission, its former head, Song Ping-another
 economist who leans toward greater central plan-
 ning-took charge of the party's Organization De-
 partment. Having Song as head of this department,
 the party's personnel office, probably will give the
 conservatives considerable say in personnel decisions,
 especially at the middle level.
 Conservative economic thinkers, we believe, retain
 considerable support in some sectors of the bureaucra-
 cy, particularly the State Planning Commission, with
 its vested interest in strong central planning. Other
 organizations that in our view harbor conservative
 supporters include the Ministry of Finance; some of
 the heavy industry ministries such as power that need
 sizable central funding and where, consequently, plan-
 ning has traditionally had a strong role; parts of the
 central foreign trade apparatus; and, at least in its top
 leadership, the People's Bank of China. In addition,
 party cadres who have lost power under reform,
 factory managers unhappy with their new responsibil-
 ities, and some urban workers and peasants who have
 not fared well under reforms represent inchoate con-
 stituencies for conservative economic leaders.
 Party Stalwarts and Military Conservatives
 Another group that has been more active on the
 political scene since Hu's fall consists of party elders
 who oppose the diminution in party power that has
 occurred under reform, and who fear that further
 reforms may lead to loss of party control. These men
 are most concerned about Deng's political reforms
 and the political consequences of economic liberaliza-
 tion. This group numbers among its leaders many of
 the most illustrious elders, men such as Politburo
 ' Another instance of growing conservative influence in economic
 policy is that,                     the State Council-under
 the influence of a Bo Yibo associate-is turning more and more for
 advice to scholars from People's University, reputedly one of the
 member Peng Zhen, 85; Advisory Commission Vice
 Chairman Wang Zhen, 79; and President Li
 Xiannian, 78. It also includes important military
 leaders such as party Military Affairs Commission
 Vice Chairman Yang Shangkun and Yu Qiuli; Wang
 Zhen, in fact, had a long and distinguished military
 career although since the 1970s he has been involved
 largely in party work.
 This group is difficult to characterize. Although these
 leaders go along with Deng on most issues, they share
 a hostility to political reform proposals that question
 or limit the party's authority. While admitting China
 must open more to the outside world to develop its
 economy, most of them in our view still want to shut      25X1
 out Western ideas-which they regard as subver-
 sive-about everything from politics to art. It was this
 sentiment that led to the campaign against "total
 Westernization" in early 1987. We believe Deng
 shares many of their concerns (see inset), but is more
 willing to take risks and has a greater sense of
 urgency about reform.
 The many revolutionary founders in this group give it
 greater status than any of the other loose groupings
 within the conservative wing; it also represents a more
 complex category than the economic planners. Many
 of Deng Xiaoping's oldest friends and closest advis-
 ers-including Wang Zhen and Yang Shangkun-
 belong to this group, which also includes Deng's
 strongest rival, Peng Zhen. Because of their revolu-
 tionary credentials and long careers, they are uniquely
 able to maintain their relationship with Deng even
 when they oppose his plans. That access to Deng
 makes them particularly effective advocates of conser-
 vative views.
 We believe Peng Zhen poses the greatest threat in this
 group to Deng and the reform program. Since Hu's
 fall, Peng has been extremely active.
 he has mounted several attacks
 in recent months on Deng or his proteges in attempts

 Secret
 Although he is widely considered to be China's
 leading reformer, in important respects Deng Xiao-
 ping sympathizes with the conservatives. Like other
 elders, he is concerned first and foremost about party
 control and social order. Although moreiiexible in
 his thinking than many of the old guard, he often
 supports them against younger reformers on some
 issues. The clearest examples are in intellectual
 matters, where Deng has frequently instigated harsh
 crackdowns or criticized individuals. In 1981, Deng
 sided with military leaders in criticizing Army writer
 Bai Hua, because some of his writings were highly
 critical of the PLA and, even worse, one famous
 screenplay of his ended on a note of doubt and
 despair over the party's commitment to the people.
 Deng has sharply criticized other writers who have
 gone too far in satirizing the military, and he has
 been particularly hard on intellectuals who have
 dared to express doubt about the ultimate realization
 of Communism and the party's role in achieving it.
 We believe the 1983-84 "spiritual pollution" cam-
 paign-an effort to stem the influx of Western social
 and philosophical ideas-was at least in part the
 result of Deng's anger at a growing tide of skepticism
 in intellectual circles. Most recently, we believe that
 Deng was in agreement with much of the conservative
 rhetoric aimed at "bourgeois liberalism" and "total
 Dengist reform policies. He has expanded the power
 of the National People's Congress (NPC), of which he
 is chairman, and in recent sessions succeeded in
 blocking promulgation of several measures sought by
 reformists, such as a bankruptcy law. In an unprece-
 dented press conference during the March session of
 the NPC, Peng also took an indirect slap at Zhao
 Ziyang by saying that, of present Politburo Standing
 Committee members, only Deng Xiaoping was indis-
 pensable.
 Yang Shangkun has also become increasingly promi-
 nent in the months following Hu's dismissal. A
 Chinese official told a US Embassy officer that
 Yang's responsibilities had broadened since January,
 especially in domestic affairs. Yang is one example of
 Westernization." Deng shares the emotional commit-
 ment of the party elders to their revolution and on
 occasion joins them to defend it from criticism. He
 differs from them largely in that his commitment to
 modernization is even stronger, and typically he calls
 a halt to the campaigns after a few months to
 preserve economic reforms. In our view, Deng may
 use these occasional campaigns to act as a brake on
 the overzealousness of some reformers.
 Deng is not a believer in Western-style democracy.
 Although he has called for greater democratization
 as part of political reform, in essence Deng means
 broadening input at low levels into party decisions,
 and providing more candidates in some elections-
 although the party will still choose these in most
 cases and will be able to overrule election results it
 dislikes. Deng revealed his autocratic side in 1979
 when he shut down the famous "Democracy Wall,"
 where citizens had been able to post "big-character
 posters" expressing a remarkable range of opinion.
 Deng had supported this phenomenon when he was
 consolidating power and could use it to his advan-
 tage, but he soon moved to suppress it; moreover, he
 permitted the prosecution of some leading dissident
 proponents of greater democracy.
 a leader who has generally supported Deng but who,
 on certain issues-such as last year's student demon-
 strations-ranks as a conservative, and can on occa-
 sion oppose Deng without losing Deng's trust. In fact,
 we believe Yang's May visit to the United States was
 at least in part a move by Deng to enhance Yang's
 leadership credentials.
 Yang is being groomed to get a higher post at the
 coming congress.
 We believe that the constituency for the defenders of
 party control includes many middle-level cadres who
 resent their loss of power under reform, or believe that
 relaxing party control will lead to instability. They

 academic estimates that many commanders at the
 division through army level are distrustful of reform-
 ist moves to reduce the party's role in the military,
 believing that a healthy dose of indoctrination is
 necessary to inspire the soldiers-who cannot easily
 reap the benefits of economic growth. Yu Qiuli's
 statement that, in the PLA, the anti-bourgeois-liber-
 alization drive would not be confined to party mem-
 bers, directly contravening limits Zhao Ziyang had
 drawn, exemplifies this attitude. We believe some
 military leaders may also resent reformist moves to
 pare down the Army's political influence.
 Ideologues
 A third conservative group consists of those who
 appeal primarily to Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy as a
 standard for policy. Other conservatives stress ideo-
 logical purity, of course, but this group distinguishes
 itself by attacking reform policies solely on theoretical
 grounds. It is, in our view, the group least sympathetic
 to the pragmatism of the reformers and probably most
 intolerant of intellectual experimentation. Its strong-
 hold is the party propaganda apparatus, but it also
 draws adherents from intellectuals, mostly of the
 older generation, who have followed an orthodox line
 in their work and complain that reformers have
 pushed them aside and denied them an audience.
 Although they have had recent successes in making
 party propaganda conform more closely to their views,
 the ideologues, in our judgment, have less direct effect
 on policymaking across the board than other conser-
 vative groupings. However, they have been in many
 ways the most persistent and troublesome critics of
 the reform program. Their ability to snipe at reforms
 as heretical reflects the weakness of the reform
 platform; reformers justify their policies through re-
 sults, but the lack of ideological legitimacy leaves
 them vulnerable to attack, especially when their poli-
 cies falter as they did in 1985 and 1986.

 Secret
 Chief spokesmen for the ideologues are Politburo
 member Hu Qiaomu, 75, and Secretariat member
 Deng Liqun, 72. Both are longtime propaganda spe-
 cialists and orthodox theorists; both were active in the
 "spiritual pollution campaign" of 1983-84 that, like
 this year's anti-bourgeois-liberalization campaign, at-
 tacked foreign influence in China and targeted many
 reformist intellectuals. Although they have parted
 company with Deng Xiaoping in recent years, Deng
 Liqun and Hu Qiaomu supported him in earlier
 ideological battles when he was consolidating his
 power. Hu, as a Politburo member, outranks Secretar-
 iat member Deng, but Deng has been much more
 visible and active since Hu Yaobang's resignation,
 entitling him, we believe, to be considered the chief
 figure in this group today.
 Hu, Deng, and their allies have pushed hard to
 capitalize on their opportunity. Hu Qiaomu, accord-
 ing to one story in the Hong Kong press, criticized
 Zhao Ziyang for "not knowing what politics is about
 and acting like a money-minded merchant." In April,
 Deng Liqun organized a conference of conservative
 ideologues to produce 500 essays plugging the conser-
 vative line. The ideologues have been successful in
 removing reformist-minded figures and replacing
 them with their choices in key posts such as that of
 director of the Propaganda Department.
 They also increased conservative influence over the
 arts, literature, and the media in the weeks after Hu's
 fall. In one province, 39 publications were shut down
 during the anti-bourgeois-liberalization movement.
 According to US Consulate reporting, artists and
 writers have adopted self-censorship under conserva-
 tive scrutiny. Helped by those seeking a way to instill
 discipline in the students, the ideologues have boosted
 the amount of political indoctrination required in
 universities.
 There are some signs, however, that the ideologues
 have overreached, as they did during the 1983-84
 "spiritual pollution" campaign. According to well-
 connected Hong Kong political journals, both Zhao
 and Deng Xiaoping have recently criticized Deng
 Liqun by name, and since May the press has begun to
 carry articles exploring reform ideas again. Moreover,
 the orthodox theorists have been frustrated by their
 inability to attract able intellectuals. Credible press
 accounts claim Deng Liqun's April conference fizzled
 when only a handful of the essays met minimum
 standards. Nonetheless, the ideologues remain power-
 ful; their arguments may be unappealing to a majority
 of intellectuals, but we believe their message appeals
 to many poorly educated, run-of-the-mill officials who
 feel threatened by reform.
 How They Exercise Influence
 The conservative leaders have several methods they
 use to influence policy or to try to block or modify
 reform initiatives:
 ? In our opinion, probably their most effective tactic
 is to lobby Deng Xiaoping. Historically, they have
 been able to change Deng's mind by persuading him
 that party control is threatened or that a given
 reform policy carries an unacceptable risk to politi-
 cal stability. Deng, we believe, sympathizes with the
 conservatives on these issues. The reaction to the
 student demonstrations is an example of the effec-
 tiveness of this tactic.
 ? Similarly, conservatives have been adept at pointing
 out legitimate problems, leading to reformist retreat
 from some policies. We believe conservative com-
 plaints about a drop in grain production and declin-
 ing acreage committed to growing grain were in
 part responsible for moves last year to tighten up
 rules on grain contracts and to tie certain inputs to
 grain production.
 ? Conservatives have had some success in manipulat-
 ing press and propaganda channels to voice their
 complaints and stir up opposition, although their
 ability to do this has varied considerably with the
 balance of power. After Hu Yaobang's fall, the
 official press took a marked turn toward the conser-
 vative, and even reformist leaders were mouthing
 conservative slogans.
 ? Conservatives have built up extensive networks of
 supporters and proteges within the bureaucracies
 that they can tap to frustrate reforms. A particular-
 ly effective ploy is to appeal to groups that stand to

 Secret
 lose authority and privileges, or gain unwelcome
 new duties and responsibilities, under reform. One
 weapon we believe the conservatives used to delay
 introducing a bankruptcy law this year was the
 protests of factory managers who felt threatened by
 the measure.
 ? At the highest levels of leadership, conservatives can
 work to affect swing votes-that is, those who favor
 some reforms but oppose others or who want to
 proceed more slowly. For instance, Yang Shangkun
 has supported many of Deng's military and econom-
 ic reform policies, but we believe he is conservative
 on party control issues. Other conservative leaders
 can use such classic political strategies as logrolling
 to get Yang's support on issues where his own
 interests are not deeply enough engaged to lead him
 to argue against proposed reforms.
 We believe that many of the conservatives see the
 13th Party Congress, slated for October, as their last
 chance to put their stamp on policy. From the summer
 preparatory meetings right up to the Congress, re-
 formers and conservatives almost certainly will ma-
 neuver to influence the decisions of congress. To
 strengthen their position, the conservatives realize
 they must install more of their own choices in key
 positions. At the same time, both sides will be trying
 to shape the document now being prepared that is
 intended to be the policy blueprint for the next several
 years. There are a number of areas where the conser-
 vatives would, in our view, like to reverse or modify
 state-set price schedules for a number of goods.
 Many production decisions, especially in key heavy
 industries, would continue to be administratively
 determined.
 ? Agriculture and rural industry. Conservatives such
 as Chen Yun and Bo Yibo support China's rural
 responsibility system but want to implement tighter
 controls over some aspects of agricultural produc-
 tion, particularly of grain, and restrain the rapid
 growth of rural industry and rural credit. They
 would do more than the reformers have to control
 growing income disparities between rich and poor
 peasants and between the city and countryside. We
 believe conservatives would more actively search for
 ways to mandate peasant investment in production.
 ? Enterprise management reform. Conservatives ob-
 ject to the sweeping management reforms aimed at
 giving managers more autonomy and more responsi-
 bility for their factory's performance. They fear that
 these measures would undermine the power of the
 party organizations in factories; they are also con-
 cerned at the probable loss of central control over
 the economy if factory management becomes too
 independent.
 ? Ownership reform. Some reform thinkers have pro-
 posed major changes in China's ownership system
 that, in some cases, would amount to de facto
 privatization of important sectors of the economy as
 state enterprises are leased to individuals. Conserva-
 tives believe that these changes are ideologically
 unsound and, as with many other reforms, under-
 mine central authority.
 policy.
 Economic Policy
 Although conservatives are not uniformly hostile to
 Deng's economic program, they nevertheless demon-
 strate a consistently clear preference for administra-
 tive controls over a more freewheeling, market
 approach:
 ? Foreign borrowing. Although they recognize the
 need to finance development, especially technology
 purchases, through borrowing, conservatives are
 very cautious about borrowing from abroad. If they
 are able to gain sufficient influence, we expect a
 reduction in China's willingness to incur foreign
 debt, and increased pressure to obtain government-
 to-government concessionary financing.
 ? Plan versus market. If conservatives have their way,
 further moves toward a market economy would be
 curtailed. Fewer items would be released from
 Central planning and price reform would be recon-
 strued to mean revising, but not doing away with,

 Secret
 ? Banking reform. Conservatives generally have not
 objected to reforms aimed at strengthening China's
 central bank. They probably believe banking re-
 forms that make credit levels more responsive to
 monetary tools and administrative dictates are com-
 patible with central planning-and are an inprove-
 ment over past policies that allowed low-level offi-
 cials to use banks as private treasuries for local
 construction projects. We believe conservatives have
 qualms, however, about other financial reforms,
 particularly experiments aimed at developing stock
 and bond markets.
 Propaganda, Ideology, and Education
 Conservatives, led by Deng Liqun and Hu Qiaomu
 but probably with the support of elders such as Wang
 Zhen, will argue for a strong conservative slant to the
 congress document that they can use to hamper
 reform initiatives. We doubt they will try to enshrine
 specific proposals in the document; instead, they will
 concentrate on winning personnel battles, then rely on
 their proteges to achieve their specific objectives,
 which include:
 ? Restricting the number of nonparty publications
 and carefully monitoring their content.
 ? Increasing required political study sessions in the
 workplace and, especially, the schools.
 ? Instituting formal political requirements where re-
 formers have been moving to abolish them, notably
 for college admissions and study abroad.
 ? Tightening the reins on artists and writers and
 reducing or eliminating works that contain social
 criticism, that satirize the party, that are negativ-
 ist-that imply serious flaws in socialist society-or
 that are pornographic under the extremely narrow
 conservative definition.
 ? Discouraging investigative reporting and exposes in
 the press-both of which have flourished under the
 reformers-on the grounds that these undermine
 the people's faith in the party.
 Political Reform
 Political structural reform-never clearly defined-is
 basically a Dengist slogan, shorthand for reducing the
 party role in economic activity and day-to-day govern-
 ment administration. Used by some of the more
 radical reformists to justify last year's airing of such
 heterodox ideas as a multiparty system for China, the
 slogan was eclipsed temporarily. Deng has resurrected
 it; his definition is fairly narrow, we believe, encom-
 passing largely administrative measures to increase
 accountability and efficiency and broaden support for
 reform. However, conservative leaders would construe
 political reform even more narrowly. For example,
 conservatives would probably agree that the party
 secretary in a factory should not make decisions on
 product mix but would argue he must preserve his role
 in such areas as hiring and firing, a power reformers
 would take away. Conservatives, moreover, would
 probably interpret the party secretary's remaining
 authority broadly. For instance, conservatives might
 press for the party secretary to have a say in a
 decision that would change a factory's product mix to
 include more expensive, and fewer low-quality but
 cheap, items on the grounds that such a change would
 hurt poorer members of society.
 Policy Toward the Military
 We believe there is broad consensus among the
 various groups that the military's first priority should
 be professionalism, not politics, and that the military
 must accept a reduced budget share so scarce re-
 sources can be devoted to economic modernization.
 Nonetheless, there are some important points where
 conservatives depart from reformers:
 ? Conservatives would probably pay more attention to
 the views of senior soldier-politicians holding top
 party posts, thereby according the military a greater
 voice in policymaking than reformers favor. Many
 prominent conservatives are also military leaders,
 and the military is an important reservoir of conser-
 vative sympathies; conservative leaders need the
 military's support and therefore, we believe, might
 accept a broader policy role for top military leaders.

 ? Conservative preferences for distance from the West
 and self-reliance might translate into less contact
 between the Chinese military and its foreign coun-
 terparts and more effort to build up the Army's
 technological base with domestically produced
 weapons. However, this would put the conservatives
 at odds with those in the PLA who want greater
 access to Western technology to hasten moderniza-
 tion.
 Until Hu's fall, the conservatives went from one
 setback to the next, betraying some fundamental
 weaknesses. We believe that despite recent successes
 these weaknesses remain, and that the conservatives,
 though they will probably continue to disrupt the
 implementation of reform, cannot overturn the reform
 program.

 Lack of Cohesiveness
 The leading members of the conservative coalition
 have failed to find a way to work together over an
 extended period. At best, they have united briefly to
 counter a common threat or to pursue a specific
 goal-they can often agree on what they do not want
 and work to get rid of it (or him)-only to fall out over
 what to do next.
 The chief cause of this tendency to fragment is, in our
 judgment, the lack of a single strong leader. Within
 the conservative camp there is no supreme power
 broker, no trusted arbiter of disputes and setter of
 policy directions. There is no one who combines the
 stature, connections, vision, and energy of Deng Xiao-
 ping. Chen Yun has wide respect, but his active
 support is confined largely to certain economic fig-
 ures, and in any case his health is probably too poor.
 Similarly, Peng Zhen has support only from some
 sectors. Peng Zhen is also personally unpopular with
 many of the powerful elders
 Peng seems a pure political player with little
 overarching vision, and the senior leaders may be
 distrustful of his ambitions and motives.
 The group is characterized by fractiousness. Accord-
 ing to a Hong Kong press report, for example, conser-
 vative leaders Wang Zhen and Bo Yibo recently fell
 out over the selection of delegates to the 13th Con-
 gress. In 1985,                        an effort by
 three of the most influential party e ers-Chen,
 Peng, and President Li Xiannian-to reverse certain
 economic reforms fell apart when Peng and Chen
 quarreled over a relatively low-level patronage ap-
 pointment. Personal jealousies can also weaken the
 conservative alliance. For instance,
 Peng once accused Li of selling out
 his principles for a seat on the Politburo Standing
 Committee-a post Peng himself has long coveted.
 Tired Policies
 The conservative coalition has little to offer as an
 alternative to reformist ideas. Its methods-central
 planning and motivation by exhortation-are seen as
 bankrupt by many Chinese, and its policies tend to be
 reactive and negative. We believe there is consider-
 able disillusionment and even popular disgust with
 much of the conservative program. At the outset of
 the recent anti-bourgeois-liberalization campaign, one
 party newspaper editor told a US official, "The people
 hate this stuff. I hate this stuff." Such sentiments
 from a party journalist suggest to us that opposition to
 conservative beliefs and policies is strong
 The Age Factor
 Another factor working against the conservatives is
 age-most of their leaders are in their seventies and
 eighties. Many are in ill health, which cuts down on
 their ability to play an active political role. We can
 identify a few younger figures who could emerge as
 leaders of this group (see foldout), but generally the
 younger leaders who are ready to move up are
 identified with the reform wing. Conservative leaders
 may not have time, even were they to accumulate
 sufficient clout, to install a generation to follow them.
 The point is not lost on their reformist opponents, who
 have worked hard to control appointments and shut
 out challengers. We believe the reformers' earlier
 success in this area means conservatives must play
 catch-up to identify, promote, and protect their
 choices.
 It would be rash to predict winners and losers in the
 struggle between reformists and conservatives. Re-
 forms could founder for a number of reasons apart
 from conservative opposition-several years of bad
 weather, a severe international economic downturn,
 splintering of the reform camp-and the course of
 politics for at least the next few years will be deter-
 mined partly by the order in which the elders die.
 We believe, however, that conflict between the two
 wings of the party will probably be a long-term
 feature of Chinese politics. Conservative misgivings
 about reform reflect fundamental tensions in the
 society. Nearly 40 years of Communist rule have
 shaped expectations and attitudes that reform seeks to
 change-guaranteed employment, egalitarian distri-
 bution of wealth, strict social discipline. Aspects of

 this socialist legacy resonate with Chinese tradition,
 so that reformers are trying both to modernize a poor,
 traditional society and to remake Chinese socialism.
 Conservatives speak for those frightened by the politi-
 cal and social strains or those skeptical of the benefits
 Therefore, even after the present generation of party
 elders dies, we believe conservatism will remain a
 powerful political force. Its character is likely to
 change, becoming less ideological and more concerned
 with defending narrow party and policy interests. We
 expect, though, that future conservative leaders will
 continue to use Marxism-Leninism to cloak their
 arguments and embarrass reformers. Reformers, for
 their part, will be forced to accommodate conserva-
 tives, not only because some will be personally influ-
 ential but also because they represent concerns and
 constituencies too powerful to ignore or override.
