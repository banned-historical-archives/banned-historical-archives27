 announced on Tuesday.

 Rapidly spreading strikes and labor violence are forcing the government to
 adopt sterner control measures and may set back government plans to introduce
 labor reforms and other liberalization measures.
 More than 200,000 workers are now idle because of strikes or lockouts. That
 number could double if threats of a nationwide banking strike materialize. Work
 stoppages are concentrated in Madrid, but unrest has spread to other areas. In
 Barcelona, the dockworkers are on strike, and other work stoppages have affected
 industry and banks. The strikes began over increased wage demands, but they have
 become politicized, with demonstrators now protesting police tactics and demanding
 amnesty for political prisoners.
 Interior Minister Fraga and Justice Minister Garrigues-leadirig proponents of
 reform-have issued public warnings that subversion will not be tolerated and that
 politically motivated strikes will not be permitted.
 Following this warning of -tougher action, the government placed striking postal
 workers under military control. This subjects them to military disciplinary measures
 if they participate in demonstrations or refuse to work. Previously, the government
 has only threatened to draft strikers to get them back to work.
 More liberal strike regulations are reportedly being considered, but the
 deteriorating labor situation may make it impossible for the government to resist
 rightist pressures to hold the line. On Monday, two prominent rightists-Antonio
 Giron, a former labor minister under Firanco, and the former Civil Guard
 commander, General Iniesto Cano-who oppose liberalization met with Vice Premier
 for Defense General Santiago and the army minister.

 The government has announced that tomorrow it will begin to set up
 machinery for the national elections scheduled to be held no later than April 25, and
 :hat informal campaigning by the political parties can now begin.
 The degree of civilian control of the future government and the timetable for
 "nding the military's political domination are being negotiated by the Revolutionary
 Council and the political parties. The parties have received the military's proposals
 nor the new agreement, which will supplant one signed under duress last spring, but
 !:hey have been asked by the Council not to make public disclosure of the contents.
 The parties' counterproposals are to be submitted to the Council by Monday, and
 eaders of each of the parties will meet separately with the Council next week to
 liscuss them.
 Despite the military's injunction, Freitas do Amaral, leader of the conservative
 Social Democratic Center, said yesterday that some aspects of the Revolutionary
 Council's draft are unacceptable to his party. While applauding the military for its
 _ipparent agreement to go along with the election of the president by universal
 suffrage, Amaral charged that the Revolutionary Council is attempting to retain
 >ower for another four years.
 Press reports from Lisbon yesterday appeared to confirm that the Council is
 >neking to retain its position as the supreme ruling body.
 Amaral's opposition to a continued role for the military is believed to be shared
 hot only by Popular Democratic leaders and some Socialists but also by an
 nfluential group of "professional" officers in the Revolutionary Council itself.
 These differences may be worked out when the military officers and civilian
 politicians begin talking face to face. Concern that failure to reach an early
 agreement might interrupt the election timetable will be a strong incentive for both
 =Ides. Only the Communist Party would benefit by a delay in the elections.
 Meanwhile, the government appears to have given ground to an Azorean
 delegation which is presently in Lisbon to demand further concessions on Azorean
 autonomy. The cabinet announced yesterday that it had reexamined a recent decree
 law on the subject and that popular aspirations in the archipelago have now been
 "more accurately interpreted." Azorean leaders had predicted a violent reaction in
 the islands unless the government changed its position on the decree law.

 Soviet officials profess to be pleased with last month's release of the Soviet
 helicopter crew but are skeptical about its significance.
 According to a Soviet Foreign Ministry official, Moscow is "delighted" with the
 return of the three military personnel and view it as confirming the USSR's position
 on the matter. Viktor Krashennikov, a member of the ministry's First Far East
 Division, reiterated Moscow's claim that the helicopter was a standard military
 aircraft that had been conducting a medical rescue mission when it accidently
 strayed across the border.
 Krashennikov said the crewmen were in good health and would return to their
 units upon the completion of medical examinations. He offered no further
 information on their 21  months in captivity, particularly the possibility of
 mistreatment. A Soviet public lecturer had hinted earlier this month that this had
 occurred, and a Chinese diplomat had reportedly said that the crew has undergone a
 "re-education" process.
 Speculating on Moscow's possible response to this gesture, Krashennikov
 indicated that offers of increased trade have previously been rejected by Peking, but
 he hinted that the renewal of cultural or scientific exchanges is a possibility. The
 initiative, he added, rests with China, inasmuch as the USSR has continually sought
 improved relations despite ideological differences. Although the return of the crew
 was a positive development, he noted that anti-Soviet commentaries continue to
 appear in the Chinese press.
 The official noted that he was not aware that Deputy Foreign Minister llichev,
 the chief border negotiator, would be returning to Peking in the near future. The
 talks are continuing at the working level, and he indicated that Ilichev would go if
 there were any reason for him to do so. llichev most recently visited Peking last
 spring, and an East European diplomat in the Chinese capital has reported that he is
 expected to return there sometime this month.
 Turning to China's internal developments, the official observed that Chou
 En-lai's death had done little to clarify the leadership struggle in China. Moscow's
 condolence message was almost the same as that issued at the death of Politburo
 member Tung Pi-wu last year. Soviet media reported that Deputy Premier Mazurov
 paid a condolence call at the Chinese embassy on January 14.
 According to Krashennikov, the most significant event during Chou's 18-month
 illness was his success in getting Teng Hsiao-ping in place so as to effect an orderly
 transition.

 Prime Minister Razak's death will set off maneuvering among potential
 successors. Deputy Prime Minister Hussein Onn has stepped into Razak's position,
 but Hussein is in poor health and may not be able to stay in office long.
 The three vice presidents of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO),
 the dominant party in the ruling National Front, are the frontrunners for succession.
 None of them-Minister of Agriculture Ghafar Baba, national oil company
 (Petronas) chief Razaleigh, or Education Minister Mahathir-has Razak's stature or
 his authority in the ruling party.
 UMNO could postpone a decision on the leadership by offering an interim
 prime ministership to the respected former prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman.
 Razak's passing also will bring into question the durability of his communal
 policies that have kept racial tensions in check. Leading Malay politicians generally
 accept the necessity of avoiding policies that could touch off communal strife. The
 large Malaysian Chinese community, however, will have doubts as to whether any of
 the potential successors to Razak possesses the political adroitness and strength to
 tend off grassroots Malay pressures aimed at sharply curtailing the dominant Chinese
 position in Malaysia's economy.

 Moscow apparently plans to increase its economic assistance to the new
 communist regime in Laos this year and may provide it some military hardware.
 The Soviets have agreed to donate equipment for mineral exploration and
 powerplants, as well as farm machinery, gasoline tank-trucks, consumer goods, and
 other basic commodities.
 They have continued to provide the Lao technical advice in the field of civil
 aviation and have also been involved in directing the construction and upgrading of
 airfields. The Soviet defense attache in Vientiane recently confirmed that the Soviet
 Union is helping the Lao build a new airfield in the Xieng Khoang area of
 northeastern Laos. The Soviets also recently agreed to send a group of air transport
 specialists to the country, as well as to contribute additional equipment and spare
 parts to improve Lao aviation facilities.
 Moscow is also providing petroleum products, including aviation gas, some of
 which is probably being used to support its own in-country operations.
 I                                         he Soviets are also apparently planning
 to upgrade current Aeroflot commercial operations into Vientiane from IL-18 to
 TU-154 service.
 There have been recurring reports that the Soviets plan to provide an
 unspecified number and type of MIG aircraft to the Lao and that they are offering
 training in the USSR in 'flight and aviation support skills. There is presently
 insufficient evidence that any MIGs have yet arrived. There are several airfields in
 Laos capable of supporting limited MIG operations, and a number of Lao pilots
 reportedly sent to the Soviet. Union may already have returned.
 Even though the new Lao leadership is relying heavily on the Soviets, North
 Vietnamese, and Chinese for assistance, it has continued to seek and receive help
 from other sources. India, East Germany, and Hungary are among several countries
 that are providing emergency supplies of aid.
 The Lao also recently reiterated their desire for unconditional US aid. The Lao
 government clearly regards such assistance as a precondition for improved relations
 with the US.

 The Khmer communists continue to rebuff Soviet efforts to gain a foothold in
 Phnom Penh. The three East European countries that took the lead in championing
 the Cambodian  insurgent cause during the war-Albania, Yugoslavia, and
 Romania-have nevertheless been allowed to open embassies.
 the Cambodians refused a Soviet request
 made in December to open an embassy of "moderate size." Phnom Penh apparently
 is still smarting over Moscow's lack of wartime support and refusal to break relations
 with the Lon Nol government until the last days of the war. The Chinese have no
 doubt urged their Cambodian allies to go slow in repairing relations with Moscow.
 Phnom Penh's willingness to allow the three East European countries to open
 embassies presumably stems from their previous support of the Khmer insurgents.
 The Albanian ambassador arrived in Phnom Penh late last year. The Yugoslav
 embassy is scheduled to open soon, and the Romanians are making preparations to
 establish their presence. The Cubans, who gave diplomatic support to the Khmer
 communists, have also joined the Chinese, Vietnamese, and North Koreans in Phnom
 Penh.

 Terrorist efforts to free a guerrilla leader under military arrest have prompted
 US diplomatic officials in Buenos Aires to 1:ake special security precautions out of
 concern that they will be selected as kidnap victims to be used in exchange for him.
 The terrorist campaign began earlier this week with the sabotage of a suburban
 commuter train. A message issued by extremists then stated that other attacks will
 follow until guerrilla chief Roberto Quieto is released. This has increased diplomatic
 concern that the extremists might provoke an international incident to force the
 government to accept their demands.
 The danger that the terrorists will continue to stage spectacular attacks is high
 so long as the authorities prevent any chance of negotiation by denying that Quieto
 is a prisoner. The guerrillas will continue to press the issue because they believe that
 he is cooperating with military leaders and could provide information that would
 permanently damage their movement.

 Admiral Alfredo Poveda is attempting to solidify his position as leader of the
 jhree-man military junta that ousted former president Rodriguez Lara last week, but
 rivalries among its members will hinder the execution of the triumvirate's policies.
 Poveda has assumed responsibility for the military and security services, while
 putting the army General Guillermo Duran in charge of economic policy, a post for
 which he lacks talent and which will become a focus for discontent. The move is

 Two legislators who recently lashed out against the military have lost their jobs
 in the latest skirmish between Brazil's liberal politicians and conservative generals.
 When military security officials in Sao Paulo last month labeled three
 opposition politicians Communist subversives, all three protested their innocence in
 public statements, and two went on to charge that the investigators had used torture
 to obtain their evidence. The two-a state deputy and a federal congressman-were
 promptly divested of their office by President Geisel, who used a broad, all-purpose
 piece of legislation to suspend their political rights for ten years. The third
 deputy-who is the best known leftist politician in the group-did not raise the
 sensitive issue of torture and escaped his colleagues' fate.
 Conservative military officers generally see political criticism of their activities
 as threats to national security and are especially sensitive to the issue of torture.
 There is no question that they pressed Geisel to act, and that he had to respond. His
 refusal to move against the less outspoken legislator, however, demonstrates Geisel's
 unwillingness to cave in to the generals in matters where military honor is not
 directly impugned.
 This is a municipal election year in Brazil, and opposition congressmen are now
 attacking Geisel's use of dictatorial powers, hoping to revive the international
 attention focused a few months ago on the suspicious death of a jailed newsman also
 accused of illegal Communist affiliations.
 Geisel clearly considers the case closed, but he will crack down again if
 sufficiently provoked.

 across the Indian Ocean. The naval group, including a guided-missile destroyer, a
 guided-missile destroyer escort, an unarmed supply ship, and a coastal escort, has
 already called at Sri Lanka. It will now travel only to Singapore, the Maldive Islands,
 and the Seychelles-not on the original schedule-before returning to Iran. Port calls
 in Indonesia, Australia, and India have been canceled. The schedule change may be
 related to other operational commitments for scheduled naval exercises in the
 Persian Gulf or to the recent top-level navy command changes.
