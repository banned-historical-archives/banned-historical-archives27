 A C MBODIAN DID
 II'T L AOS REPORTED
 Troops Would Cet U.S. Arms
 There for Operations
 By HENRY KAMM
 frEOla1 to TM New Yerk Times
 SAIGON,  South  Vietnam,
 'Nov. 8-According to informed
 sources, Cambodian officers are
 discussing with members of the
 entourage of Prince Boun Oum,
 the feudal chief of southern)
 Laos, the possibility of sending
 Sizable numbers of Cambodian
 ,t-tops to Laos to be equipped
 with United States arms.
 ? - These arms, it is said, would
 be in addition to the limited
 program of American military
 aid now granted to Cambodia.
 At this stage, the sources
 said, the United States has not;
 been brought= into ? the discus-'
 ions, which were initiated by
 the Cainbodfans. However, the
 impetus 'for the talks arose
 from the fact that about 1,500
 Can bodian soldiers are being
 tr ned under the auspices of)
 ,the United States Central Intel-
 ligence  Agency  in  southern
 Laos.
 The Cambodian Idea is sim-
 ply that Cambodia has more
 troops than arms, and Laos
 needs soldiers but has found
 it easy to get weapons and
 equipment  from  the  United
 States.
 Prince Operates Independently;
 The  Cambodians    evidently
 see no need to raise the issue,
 with the Government of Pre-
 mier Souvanna Phouma, of hav-
 ing  their              troops        equipped,
 trained and operating in the
 panhandle of Laos.
 Not  only  is  Prince   noun
 Oum's authority in southern
 Laos almost independent of the
 central Governrneiit, but also,
 perhaps of more importance, his
 dealings with the Central Intel-
 ligence Agency on military op-
 erations- run by the agency
 in the Ho Chi Minh Trail re-
 Although an additional ap-
 propriation is expectcvl by early
 next year, it would still be.
 easier to escape budgetary re-
 strictions strictions by supplying Cam-~
 hodian troops through funds for'
 Laos.
 5 Battalions Considered
 No specific proposals have
 been made, but Cambodian offi-
 cers are thinking in terms of
 five battalions, each of about
 600 men. They feel that such a
 force would be of equal value
 to Laos and Cambodia endli
 could operate in either coun-
 try.
 At -the' moment, the Viet-
 namese  Communists  control
 roughly the eastern half of the
 Laotian panhandle as well as
 the adjoining Cambodian prov-
 inces of Ratanakiri and Stung-
 treng to the south.
 The Laotian Government is
 worried about Communist at-
 tempts to widen the Ho Chi,
 Minh Trail network westward
 to supply their forces in Cam-
 bodia.
 Cambodian authorities con-
 sider it imperative to introduce
 at   least   small   military
 units  into   the    occupied
 provinces to give the civilian
 population arallying point and
 to counter Communist political
 influence in the regions they
 have held since April.
 Greater Containment Needed
 Intelligence  reports  of  a
 growing Communist build-up in
 southern Laos have added ur-
 gency to the need. for troops
 to contain the Communists,
 keep their flow of men and
 supplies under surveillance and
 call in American air strikes.

 FROM PEKING
 Cambodia's deposed Prince says why he thinks U.S. policy helps spread
 Communism in Asia,
 In February, 1968, 1 visited Prince
 Norodom Sihanouk in Cambodia. Dur
 Ing a long interview that later ap
 peered in LOOK, he spoke to me
 frankly-as a neutralist - about his
 fears of Chinese expansionism as well
 as American intervention in Southeast
 Asia. After he was deposed as Chief
 of State last spring, I wrote him in Pe-
 king-where he has been living ever
 since - suggesting we have another
 talk. He replied that he had made it a
 rule not to give interviews but would
 answer my questions by mail as soon
 as he had time. Then he cabled, say-
 ing he would receive me in Peking
 after.all and suggested I apply for a
 visa at the Chinese Embassy in Paris.
 When the Chinese turned me down,
 Sihanouk promptly cabled from Pe-
 king saying he would send me his
 answers via the French Diplomatic
 Pouch. Here they are.

 Editor in Chief
 South Vietnam and Thailand between
 t% he years 195G.-when Cambodia
 started diplomatic relations with the
 Peoples' Republic of China, and 1965,
 when, as a consequence of too many
 murderous aerial bombardments of
 our national territory by the U.S. Air
 Force, we had to sever diplomatic re-
 lations with Washington.
 All these plots failed, thanks to the
 loyalty of the army and the police and
 their Commander in Chief, Gen. Lon
 Nol, the same man who committed
 treason against me in 1970.

 the government of Bangkok, it is be-

 overthrow) and the invasion of my
 country by American forces in order
 to "destroy the Vietcong sanctu-
 aries." These reports emphasized
 that unless this was done, the war
 could not be won by the United
 States in South Vietnam.
 President Johnson did not dare
 adopt this "extreme solution," but
 now we see both "the change of po-
 litical orientation" and the invasion
 by American and satellite forces. All

 Au just .81, .1970          CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE
 Evidence that the largest American
 corporation, such as Lockheed, the Penn
 Central Railroad,  General Dynamics,
 and LTV are susceptible to failure under
 certain circumstances has surfaced re-
 cently. This fact, in my opinion, makes
 highly questionable the wisdom of plac-
 ing too large a percentage of our defense
 dollars in the hands of a single corpor-
 ate entity.
 The country's economy has taken a
 serious downswing vvhicli makes it more
 important than before to balance our de-
 fense spending geographically.
 The Nixon administration's Blue Rib-
 bon Defense Panel, headed by Mr. Fitz-
 hugh, has within weeks recommended
 that huge defense contracts he divided
 where possible to avoid overconcen??
 tration and to maintain a reasonable
 mobilization base. If the report of this
 team of experts had been made 6 weeks
 earlier and if the Department of De-
 fense had heeded the advice of this com-
 mittee, it is probable that the Navy
 would have divided the DD-963 con-
 tract. And the contract should be di-
 vided now.

 Mrs. SRTITH of. Maine. Mr. President,

 he stated that the Navy had told him

 since Admiral Sonensliein increased that

 about 6 weeks' time.

 The- PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mxii
 EAGLETON). Without .objection, it is so
 ordered.
 Under the previous order, the Chair
 now lays before the Senate amendment
 No. 862 which the clerk will state.
 The assistant legislative clerk read as
 follows:                         -     -
 - SEC.   . (a) In  accordance  with public
 statements of policy by the President, no
 tirnds authorized by this or any other Act
 may be obligated or expended to maintain
 a troop level of more than two hundred
 and eighty thousand armed forces of the
 United States in Vietnam after April 30, 1971.
 (b) After April 30, 1071, funds herein au-
 thorized or hereafter appropriated may be ex-
 pended in connection with activities of Amer-

 only to accomplish the following objectives:
 (1) the orderly termination of military
 operations there and the safe and systematic
 withdrawal of remaining Armed Forces by
 December 31, 1071;
 (2) to secure the release of prisoners of
 war;
 (3) the provision of asylum for Vietnamese
 'who might be physically endangered by
 withdrawal of American forces; and
 (4) to provide assistance to the republic
 of Vietnam consistent with the foregoing
 objectives.

 a period of not to exceed sixty clays and shall
 inform the Congress forthwith of his find-
 ings; and within ten days following applica-
 tion of the suspension the President may
 submit rec-onimendations, including (if nec-
 essary) a new date applicable to subsection
 (b) (1) for congressional approval.
 Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I yield
 30 minutes to the Senator from Iowa (Mr:
 HuGIIES), one of the cosponsors of this
 amendment.
 Mr. HUGHES. Mr. President, I thank
 the distinguished Senator from Oregon
 for-yielding me this time.
 Mr. President, as we move to consider
 the end the war amendment, we get to
 the target center of what is the over-
 riding Issue before the t'Amerlcan people
 today.
 Shall we, at long last, take the deci-
 sive steps to end American military in-
 volvenicnt in Southeast Asia?
 Or, shall we continue present policies,
 which, whatever their merits may be,
 give no real assurance of total military
 disengagement?
 Whatever else we are accomplishing by
 this debate, we are keeping faith with the
 American people by bringing this central.
 issue to a vote.
 The debate on our military policies has
 been long and impassioned between re-
 sponsible elected Representatives of the
 people, Representatives who are alike
 in their devotion to the national inter-
 ests but deeply divided on exactly what
 our national interests are and on the
 policies that will most effectively imple-
 ment those Interests.
 I am deeply grateful to the distin-
 guished chairman of the Armed Services
 Committee, the Senator from Mississippi
 (Mr. STENNIs), and his colleagues of both
 parties, who have carried the adminis-
 tration's side of this issue, for the fair-
 ahd high-minded plane on which they
 have conducted the debate.
 To question the motives of the dedi-
 cated men in this Chamber, who have
 fought the uphill battle against tradi-
 tional public attitudes to bring about
 this vote on a definite plan to end the
 war, would be an incalculable disservice
 to a free people.
 We disagree in matters of judgment-
 not in fundamental objectives nor in de-
 votion to our country.
 . I have never met more devoutly pa-
 triotic men than the Senator from South
 Dakota (Mr. McGovERN), the Senator
 from Oregon  (Mr. HATFIELD), and the
 other sponsors of the amendment to end
 the war.
 If I am convinced of anything about
 the American people, it would be that
 every responsible American wants to sup-
 port his President, in time of war, re-
 gardless of party differences.
 The optimum solution for ending our
 involvement in Indochina would be for
 the President to take the necessary moves
 to get all of our troops out and to create
 the necessary preconditions for 'giving
 peace negotiations a credible chance of
 success.
 I do not question that this is what the
 President wants.
 But one after another of the current
 news reports tell us the familiar story
 of increasing involveriient, as the dis-
 patch of yesterday that said:
 Fresh evidence that American planes are
 carrying out direct bombing missions in sup-
 port of the Cambodians came through a
 Cambodian radio at a government strong-
 point near Phuoni Penh yesterday.
 We are repeatedly told that the only
 way we can safely withdraw our troops
 is by extending our engagement.
 The pronouncements of the Vice Presi-
 dept in his recent trip to Southeast Asia
 give little solace to those who believe we
 should get out of Southeast Asia as soon
 as it can be safely and systemtically done.
 Although  Mr.  Nixon  acknowledges
 that the settlement in Indochina must be
 political, not military, our policies, in
 point of fact, continue in hot pursuit of
 a military victory.
 The President continues to refer to
 peace negotiations, and his appointment
 of Ambassador Bruce to the Paris peace
 talks was a commendable and statesman-
 like move. But at the same time, Mr.
 Nixon pledges our country to the perpet-
 uation of the Thieu-ley regime in Sai-
 gon. Flatly, this objective and the ob-
 jective of realistic peace negotiations in
 Paris are mutually incompatible.
 In this country, the pendulum of pub-
 lic opinion about the Indochina war has
 swung back and forth between deep con-
 cern and apathy-or despair. For a
 number of months, following last No-
 vember, an almost unbelievable amnesia
 enveloped the Nation-a lapse of mem-
 ory about the on-going horror of the kill-
 ing, maiming, and destruction in Viet-
 nan1. Then, for a time, the fog lifted.
 The revelations of My Lai shocked us
 into awareness of how this war is brutal-
 izing our own people. The discovery by
 news correspondents of the extent of our
 Government's  involvement  in  Laos
 aroused new doubts and apprehensions.
 The invasion of Cambodia was the straw
 that broke the camel's back.
 In the heat of the national concern
 over the Cambodia invasion, I believe
 that the passage of the amendment to
 end the war would have been assured..
 Now the cutting edge of the public
 protest has somewhat dulled, although I
 a1n convinced that the deep-lying senti-
 ment is as strong as ever.
 In my own State, the untold story, as
 I see it, is of the peace movement that
 has emerged in the small communites
 of  middle  America-not  among  the
 youth, who were already with it, but
 among the calm and established adult
 citizens of these communities.
 The on-going story of the Indochina
 war is one of abstract comparatives.
 There were "fewer casualties" this week
 than the week before-or than 6 months
 before. We tend to lose sight of the fact
 that the men killed are flesh-and-blood
 people, not statistics, and that for each
 One killed there are many others horribly
 maimed or otherwise incapacitated.
 But, I am convinced that an increasing

 LED 'GUERRILLAS AGAINST SIHANOUIC
 By DONALD' KIRK
 stex staff writer
 SAIGON-Cambodia's
 most celebrated rebel is still
 fighting  for the "nationist
 cause" even though he is no
 ,longer in revolt against his
 government.
 The name Son Ngoc Thanh
 means little outside the Indo-
 chinese peninsula, but for a
 generation  he  posed what
 many observers regarded as
 the most serious threat to the
 government of the then Cam-
 bodian chief of state, Prince
 Norodom Sihanouk.
 Thanh, prime minister un-
 der the Japanese in the closing
 days of World War IT,, fought
 Sihanouk  incessantly,  both
 militarily and politically, until
 the Prince was overthrown on
 March 18 by rightist elements
 in his own government.
 "On that day," said 'T'hank,
 "I turned over my troops to the
 government of Gen. Lon Nol,"
 the Cambodian Prime minis-
 ter who helped engineer the
 coup.
 Free Cambodians
 Thanh's "troops" were some
 4,500 Khmer Sere!, or free
 Cambodians. He led them for
 12 years on the South Viet-
 nam side of the Cambodian
 frontier.
 Trained since 1964 by U.S.
 Special Forces advisers, the
 Khmer Serei have fought with
 the Cambodian army in practi-
 cally  every  major  battle
 against the Vietnamese Com-
 munists since May.
 Thanh maintained his troops
 during their rebel days with
 funds supplied by the Central
 Intelligence  Agency. "I no
 longer command them. They
 are part of the Cambodian
 army," he said.
 Remain Loyal
 But the Khmer Sere!, still
 profess loyalty to their legend-
 ary leader. They. stand out
 from the rest of the Cambodian
 forces in almost any engage-
 meat in which they're involved.
 For one thing, they wear
 American-style fatigues and
 boots and carry American-
 made rifles, radios and other
 equipment.
 And then, according to those
 who have covered the off-
 again, on-again war in Cambo-
 dia, the Khmer Serei are con-
 siderably more effective mili-
 tarily than most of their un-
 dertrained,   under-equipped
 Cambodian army comrades.
 "At least they seem to know
 how to handle themselves,"
 remarked one seasoned ob-
 server. "They're not complete-
 ly  inexperienecd  and they
 don't look for somewhere to
 hide as soon as they hear
 some shots fired in the dis-
 tance."
 Future Elite
 Some Americans describe
 the Khmer Serei as the future
 elite of the Cambodian army.
 "By elite I mean in compari-
 son with the rest of them,"
 said  an  American officer.
 "They may make the differ-
 ence if anything does, in some
 big battles we're anticipating
 this winter."
 The praise of the Khmer
 Serel does not surprise Son
 Ngoc Thank, who formed his
 first guerrilla forces in the
 jungles of western Cambodia
 after  fleeing  from Phnom
 Penh in 1952 after an argu-
 ment with Sihanouk over his
 policy of conciliation with the
 French colonial rulers.
 "They have had constant ex-
 perience along the Cambodian
 border," said Thanh, a short,
 wiry man who, at 62 still looks
 physically capable of leading a
 guerrilla army in the. field.
 Ambushed Viet Cong
 "T"hey were recruited from
 among Cambodians living in
 South Vietnam. Many had fled
 from Cambodia.
 Knowledgeable sources here
 say- Thanh's army "crossed
 the frontier all the time on
 secret 1n ssions to ambush
 North Vietnamese and Viet
 Cong units.
 Thanh insists the Khmer
 Serei are now under Cambodi-
 an government control "in ev-
 ery sense." But. some sources
 arriving here of a new buildup
 of north Vietnamese troops
 within several miles of the
 capital of Pehnom Penh.
 He said the Communists will
 never occupy Phnom Penh
 Downfall "Inevitable"
 believe they still receive mon- / "Sihanouk cared for bin self
 ey, indirectly, from the CIA.\( and not his country," said
 Thank, would not discuss
 how much his men were-or
 are-paid or where the Khmer
 Screi had obtained their funds.
 He preferred instead to talk
 about the prospects of the
 Cambodian  government, on
 which he now serves officially
 as a "councillor" to Prime
 Minister Nol.
 "The government will sur-
 vivs," he said as reports were
 Thanh. "His downfall was in-
 evitable in view of his policy
 of favoring the Vietnamese
 Communists."
 Thank feels vindicated now
 that Sihanouk has fallen.
 "But I'm still fighting for
 my country," he said, "even
 though I no longer lead my
 men in battle: We are closer to
 true freedom than ever be-
 fore."

 By HENRY S. BRADSTTER
 Star Staff Writer
 HONG KONG -- While the
 military situation in Cambodia
 remains uncertain, and the po-
 litical stability of the Lon Nol
 government is still of en to
 doubt, Prince Norodom Snhau-
 ouli is having problems.
 The exiled Cambodian lead-
 er has failed to win wide-
 Spread acceptance for his con-
 tention that he was unconstitu-
 tionally ousted from the post
 of chief of state.
 His efforts to secure accept-
 ance of his Pekma-based "roy-
 al government of national un-
 ion of Cambodia" as the lc-giti-
 rnate  regime have bogged
 down. Only 17 Communist and
 left-leaning  countries  have
 recognized it in preference to
 the  government in Phnom
 Penh.
 And lie is running out of
 places to visit, of crowds
 ready to feed his love of popu-
 lar acclaim.
 These problems do not mean
 that Sihanouk's cause is neces-
 sarily doing poorly and his fu-
 ture prospects are dim. The
 situation inside Cambodia re-
 mains fluid enough to offer
 him hope of outlasting Pre-
 mier Lon Nol.
 The hope is dependent upon
 continued ' military  support
 from Hanoi and conditioned by
 ed the throne" of uaniooula.
 He  "participated  by your
 side" in the 1955 Afro-Asian
 conference in Bandung and,
 "still by your side," in the 1961
 Belgrade non-aligned summit
 conference.
 News Selected With Care
 This persona.l touch ignored
 the fact that only Ethiopia's
 Ilaile Selassie among present
 non-aligned  leaders was in
 power in 1941, and few were
 even in 1.1,61.  _
 The letter used a careful
 selection of. Western news re-
 ports on events in Cambodia
 since Sihanouk's ouster March
 18 to depict conditions support-
 ing his case. There was partic-
 ularly  heavy  reliance  on
 French writers who saw the
 CIA  behind every anti=)
 Sihanouk move --- a charge
 that no one has documented
 and many independent observ-
 ers have rejected.
 Sihanouk argued at length
 that the Cambodian constitu-
 tion did not make it possible
 for him to he removed as chief
 of state.  Ile also contended
 that the adoption of a republi-
 can form of government under
 Lon Nol would violate the 1947
 constitution and would lack
 the approval of a genuinely
 free referendum.
 Claims Popular Foots
 "uncertainty over North Viet-
 nam's ultimate intentions.
 With a touch of desperation,
 Sihanouk has issued an open
 letter to "the kings, heads of
 state and heads of government
 of non-aligned countries" ap-
 pealing for support.
 Took Week to Print
 It is so long -- more than
 '12,000 words  -that the New
 China News Agency made it
 public in installments from
 Aug. 8,. the day Sihanouk re-
 leased it, over a week that
 ended Friday.
 "Your majesties and your
 excellencies," Sihanouk asked,
 in effect, how can you(turn
 your backs on me -- me,; your
 old friend?
 Switching to third person, he
 wrote that "Norodom Sihan-
 ouk has had the honor to he
 your humble `colleague' since
 the year 1941 when he ascend-

 "has its `roots' among the poe-
 pie and possesses all the at-
 tributes of a legal govern-
 ment."
 The government was ap-
 pointed "after having been
 elected by the general con-
 gress of adherents of the na-
 tional united front of Kampu-
 chea,"  Sihanouk's  political'
 party formed in exile.
 f   The front was  originally
 known, from - initials of the
 French version, as FUNK, but
 i    K7 f'M'  It  \ Ji    ~._            xfl ~'Sai l o;i
 apparently some Cambodian
 or   Chinese public relations
 man thought better of that and
 switched to the English initials
 NUFK.  .
 The letter did not mention
 that the NUFK congress was
 held in Peking and not attend-
 ed by the three ministers
 whom  he described as its
 "principal rnernbers." Sihan-
 ouk denied reports that he had
 once had ? the three murdered,
 before he switched to their
 leftist side.
 His government has so far
 been recognized by Albania,
 Algeria, China, Central Afri-
 can Republic, Congo (Brazza-
 ville), Cuba, Guinea, Iraq, Li-
 bya, ]Mauretania, North Ko-
 rea, North Vietnam, Romania,
 Sudan, Syria, South Yemen
 and Yugoslavia.
 Noticably missing from the
 list are the Soviet Union and
 its most loyal followers. The
 exile government's minister of
 finance, Thiounu L%Tumm, re-
 cently  visited Moscow and
 some ,;cast European capitals
 seeking support.
 Intensive lobbying also has
 been under way in non-aligned
 countries. Special efforts have
 been made, so far without suc-
 cess, to gain admission to the
 non-aligned  summit confer-
 ence of 74 nations scheduled to
 begin Sept. 8 in Lusaka, Zam-
 bia.
 If-I'D
 ___-STA,TUx4T.
 Most non-aligned .nations
 seem inclined to try to avoid
 having to make a decision on
 which Cambodian government
 to recognize. Neither is likely
 to he seated at Lusaka, al
 though Phnom Penh also has
 been trying to gain admission.
 Picks Up Some Support
 Sihanouk continues to pick
 up support from Cambodians
 abroad. His government is-
 sued a statement Friday wel-
 coming the adlicrence of Cam-
 bodian students and a diplo-
 mat in Czechoslovakia. Last
 month an official sent on a
 mission to the Worlrl Beak by
 Lon Nol defected on the way
 home and went to Peking.
 On Aug. 1 the "Voice of the
 NUFK" radio began broad-
 casting. Sihanouk's open letter
 claimed that the station is "in
 the liberated zone" of Cambo-
 dia, but this seemed unlikely
 for logistical reasons.
 There is precedent for it to
 be in southern China. The
 "Voice of the Malayan Revolu-
 tion" and the "Voice of the
 People  of Thailand," both
 Chinese-controlled Communist
 insurgent stations, are located
 there.
 A news agency, the "Agency
 Khmere D'Inforin ati en
 (AKI)," was established Mon-
 clay to distribute material on
 the exile movement.

 PRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK
 C/O PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
 PEKING, CHINA
 DEAR PRINCE SIHANOUK:
 FOUND your photograph the other
 day, torn by shrapnel and lying
 in the dust near a bombed-out pa-
 goda at Oudong. A monk either hadn't
 heard the directive of last March that
 your image was henceforth banned
 throughout Cambodia or had ignored
 it. This old laminated photo had been
 tacked to the wall of his but until
 the morning a rocket caved in its
 thatched roof and sent it flying. You
 were younger in the picture, thinner,
 holding a bouquet of yellow flowers
 and smiling with that expression of,
 vague discomfort I see so often on
 the faces of your countrymen. In
 Cambodia, a furtive, grateful smile

 Correspondent, is on a freelance report-
 tour of Sou6east Asia.
 seems to be the best defense against
 Ill fortune.
 Riding back from Oudong,  we
 stopped to let pass a battalion of
 Cambodian soldiers,  untested and
 exuberant boys who cheered and ap-
 plauded themselves, all the while
 showing their teeth in that same self-
 conscious way. They were traveling
 to war in civilian buses painted bright
 green and gypsy blue because their
 allies hadn't yet provided enough
 military trucks. A few miles to our
 right, almost lost in gray clouds, rose
 Pnom Oudong, the hill where Cam-
 bodia's capital once stood.
 The Communist tortes--call them
 Vietminh or Vietcong or the North
 Vietnamese Army  or the  Khmer
 Rouge-had taken the hill for strate-
 lgic as well as symbolic reasons, and
 they could watch our car racing down
 .Route 5 and could count the Govern-
 ment buses as they moved toward
 Kompong Cham.
 The Communists that clay were
 also holding Angkor, and according
 to other rcAW~C`(   IOWFl      el'a$~
 there and pr  laim your government
 Inside the sacred ruins. You had done
 something like that once before, In
 1953, when the French treated you
 like a 30-year-old adolescent and tried
 to distract you from your demands
 for Cambodian independence with
 another round of Paris nightclubs.
 You exiled yourself in Bangkok and
 at Battambang until the French gave
 way. Now you wait in Peking for a
 wave of history that will restore you
 again to power.
 Given the American appetite for
 absolutes and quick solutions, we
 have often found your political style
 bizarre if not immoral. For a decade
 one newsmagazine referred to you
 as "Snooky" for your crime of rais-
 ing doubts about the Pax Americana.
 But less chauvinistic observers have
 been just as distressed by your con-
 trariness. What to make, for exam-
 ple, of your relationship with Lon
 Nol, the general who deposed you?
 For years you have alternated praise
 for him with denunciations. You re-.
 moved him as Premier in 1957, then
 insisted last August that he accept
 the job again. On a dozen occasions
 you've predicted that he and Prince
 Sirik Matak would try to unseat you
 and yet, it now appears, you never
 really believed your own warnings.
 Intrigue,  compromise,  tendentious
 neutrality--the dodges and twists to
 your policy have been hard to follow,
 so that when I returned to Cambodia
 after six years away from it I set
 myself only four questions and tried
 to keep them simple: Why were you
 deposed? Did the United States take
 part in removing you? Can the pres-
 ent Cambodian Government survive?
 Would the people. of Cambodia be
 better served with you back in Pnorn-
 penh or as a permanent guest of
 Peking?
 5 NEVITADLY the answers proved
 more convoluted than the questions,
 more subjective, and often clumsy
 with parenthetical qualifications and
 disclaimers. But looking down at your
 photograph on the ground, I decided
 I would share my conclusions with
 you. Given the avidity with whim  population. "One American _ repre-
 you have conducted state business                                               sentative of a peace group was in

 2d{}h0~b1.u6 : CIA-RDP80-01601 ROOI~~snce 1958:" A Cabinet
 When I heard last March 18 that minister looked at me half-hopefully
 the Cambodian National Assembly
 had voted to remove you as chief of
 state, I drew the same conclusion
 that's occurred to much of the world.
 I assumed that the Government of
 the United States, acting through the
 most-publicized secret agency in the
 history of espionage, had a hand in
 pushing you from office. From Paris
 you made that accusation. And the
 North Vietnamese, who had seen
 their embassy sacked in Pnompenh
 one week earlier, seemed to believe
 it. Over the next days when Lon Nol
 tried to bargain with Hanoi and
 Peking he should not have been sur-
 prised that they rebuffed him. Why
 deal with a puppet of the Americans?
 Lon Nol was ready to make certain
 concessions to protect Cambodia's
 neutrality, including the continued
 -passage through the eastern prov-
 inces of medical supplies for the
 Vietcong. But how could a govern-
 ment with so strong an anti-Commu-
 nist bias be trusted?
 That suspicion of American in-
 volvement is not going to die. It is
 too useful a propaganda tool. And
 the nature of intelligence work makes
 it impossible to say flatly that no
 secret understanding was reached.
 With some justice, you have always
 been convinced that American agents
 were implicated in the attempt to do
 away with you in the late fifties.
 You even produced a movie about it
 -"Shadow on Angkor"-though I
 haven't seen the picture and theaters
 in Pnompenh are now booking -the
 American Westerns you had pro-
 scribed for so long.
 Officials of Lon Nol's Government
 deny categorically that they had
 dealings with the C.I.A., but the
 accusation doesn't anger them. They
 are well-disposed toward the United
 States and many of them would have
 been delighted to have had guaran-
 tees from American agents before
 embarking on a step so traumatic

 N  MARCH                    18,  AN  AMERICAN-backed military
 coup overthrew the neutralist government of
 Prince Norodom Sihanouk, forcing the Cambo-
 dian I eft into all-out insurgency and providing
 American counterinsurgents with yet another Vietnam.
 First South Vietnam; then Laos; now Cambodia-American
 power has finally toppled the last domino in Indochina into
 communist revolution.
 For over a decade, the United States had tried to unseat
 Sihanouk and replace him with a right-wing regime. Though
 a conservative in domestic policies, Sihanouk jealously
 guarded his country's independence, knowing that entan-
 gling alliances could only lead Cambodia straight into the
 Indochina war, and from there into a full-scale revolution
 of her own. He also knew that if Cambodia ever became a
 junior partner in America's Asian alliances, she would open
 herself to the territorial expansion of her traditional ene-
 mies, the Thais and the South Vietnamese.
 He was right. General Lon Nol, Cambodia's new ruler, has
 abandoned neutrality. South Vietnam's General Thieu has
 agreed to occupy Cambodia, defending Lon Nol from the
 Cambodian people, at least until a successful Cambodianiza-
 tion of the war permits the withdrawal of South Vietnam-
 ese combat troops. The Thais have volunteered military aid
 and their own combat troops. And the Americans, striking
 from air and land, are turning Cambodia into the newest
 battlefield in an unending war.
 Sihanouk, meanwhile, is now chief of his country's revo-
 lutionary movement. "America attracts communism," the
 former neutralist once explained, "like sugar attracts ants."
 Sihanouk first became King of Cambodia in 1941, ap-
 pointed by the Vichy. French, who from the outset of
 World War II administered the country on behalf of the
 Japanese. In early 1945, after Vichy fell to the Allies, the
 Japanese seized direct control of Indochina, made the right-
 wing collaborator- Son Ngoc Thanh premier, and pushed
 Sihanouk to declare Cambodia independent of French rule.
 Following the defeat of Japan in World War 11, the French
 returned, jailing Son Ngoc Thanh and forcing Sihanouk to
 make Cambodia "an autonomous state within the French
 by
 Itm
 Union." This effectively reestablished French military and
 economic control, and gave the French the use of Cambo-'
 dia and Cambodian troops in their campaign to regain con-
 trol of Vietnam from the Viet Minh.
 In reaction to the French takeover, many of Son Ngoc
 Thanh's followers fled to Thailand, where they organized a
 Cambodian independence movement. The new group, the
 Khmer Issarak, covered the political spectrum from right-
 wing nationalists to communists, and included ethnic Viet-
 namese' living in Cambodia. By 1953, the anti-French
 Khmer Issarak, working closely with the Viet Minh, con-
 trolled three-fifths of Cambodia..
 S IHANOUK, HIS NATIONALIST credentials now in ques-
 tion, began his own "royal crusade for indepen-
 dence." Capitalizing on French fear of the Khmer
 Serai and the Viet Minh, he skillfully maneuvered the
 French to back his crusade and, in October 1953, declared
 the independence of Cambodia.
 Sihanouk's success undermined the nationalist position of
 the Khmer Issarak. Son Ngoc Thanh and a few of his right-
 wing followers went into exile in Bangkok; the great major-
 ity of the Khmer Issarak, including the left, accepted Siha-
 nouk's offer of amnesty and laid -down their arms.
 Sihanouk then set out to govern Cambodia in classic fash-
 ion: balancing right against left, class against class, while
 maintaining his own position, as the indispensable man-in-
 the-middle. He permitted the communist Pracheachon
 Party to operate openly. But, stepping down from the ;
 throne, he actively campaigned for his own "Buddhist'
 Socialist" Party, the Sangkum, helping it establish exclusive,
 control of the National Assembly. He surrounded himself,
 both in the Sangkum and in his cabinets, with representa-
 tives of the entire span of Cambodian political life, includ-
 ing veterans of the Khmer Issarak. Yet he ran the govern-
 ment as a one-man show, single-handedly making decisions,
 on even the most trivial matters.                                                '
 Economically, Sihanouk practiced a kind of top-down
 socialism.. But, rather than promoting growth, the profits of

 OUR MAN IN NORTH VIETNAM
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President,
 Robert S. Boyd, chief of the Akron
 Beacon-Journal Washington Bureau, re
 cently returned.from 2 weeks' traveling
 in North Vietnam. Mr. Boyd is one of the
 foremost investigative reporters in the
 Nation.
 I ask unanimous consent that his re-
 port which was published in the Akron
 Beacon-Journal of June 7,  1970, be
 printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the report
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 As follows:
 HANOI Bsr,IEvEs NIXON INVENTED VIET WAR
 (By Robert S. Boyd)
 In North Vietnamese eyes, Richard Nixon
 is even worse than Lyndon Johnson was.
 Although it was L13J who bombed the day-
 lights out of their country, Nixon is consid-
 ered even more treacherous, stubborn and
 cruel than his predecessor.
 They believe Nixon Invented the Vietnam
 War.
 In the Museum of the Revolution In Hanoi,
 which covers the 40-year struggle against
 French  and  then  American  Intervention,
 there is an interesting exhibit devoted to
 Nixon.
 It Is dated 1953, and it shows him smiling
 and chatting with the former French puppet
 emperor, Bao Dal.
 The caption asserts that this was when
 Nixon-then a freshman vice president-
 conceived his policy of "Using Vietnamese to
 fight Vietnamese."
 Another  display  shows  Nixon  visiting
 Hanoi. In the Spring of 1954, before the
 French defeat. He toured Dien Bien Phu on
 that trip.
 The exhibit recalls  Nixon's  April 1954
 speech suggesting American aid to  the
 French-a project which President Eisen-
 hower rejected.
 In other words, Hanoi elates Nixon's "Viet-
 namization" plan of 1970 back 17 years-
 even before the French collapse.
 That's how long they say the President has
 been trying to make South Vietnam into an
 American "colony" by means of Vietnamese
 troops.
 As a general rule, American presidents are
 not among North Vietnam's favorite people.
 The last good one, in their eyes, was Abra-
 ham Lincoln, whom He Chi Minh admired in
 his youth.
 It Is the North Vietnam view:
 Woodrow Wilson fouled up by ignoring the
 young He's plea for Vietnamese self-deter-
 m?Ination at the end of World War I.
 Franklin Roosevelt showed promise, but he
 died before he could be of much help.
 Harry Truman sold out to the French in
 1946 and supported their campaign to hang
 on to their old colony.       -
 Dwight Eisenhower -refused to hold the
 'promised elections to reunite Vietnam In
 1956. Instead he created a tyrant, Ngo Dinh
 Diem, and put him in Saigon.
 'John Kennedy beefed up the American
 "advisers" and launched a "special war" of
 counter-insurgency    against    "liberation
 forces" in South Vietnam.
 Lyndon Johnson "Americanized" the war
 with half a million GIs, and expanded it to
 North Vietnam.
 And now, at the bottom of the barrel,
 comes Richard Nixon.
 Nixon's "Vietna:mization" plan is crueler
 than LBJ's "Americanization" of -the war,
 said Lutt Quy Ky, secretary general of the
 North Vietnamese Journalists Association.
 "The cruelty Iles In the fact that if Nixon
 uses the blood of other people, he will not be
 as economical with it as with American
 blood," Ky said.
 Nixon Is also mere deceptive than LBJ,
 according to the North Vietnamese. Vietnami-
 zation Is only'a ruse to lull the American
 public, they argue. While cutting down U.S.
 casualties and costs, Nixon is actually pro-
 lcuging and extending the war, they say.
 The harshest Indictment of Nixon I heard
 in' my two weeks in North Vietnam came
 from H:ang Tung, a smiling, deceptively
 mild-mannered intellectual who is editor
 in chief of the official communist party news-
 paper, Nhan Dan (The People).
 "Nixon has accelerated his own defeat
 his political defeat at home and the defeat
 of his policies in Indochina," Tung said.
 "Why? Because he has done things con-
 trary to common  sense. Things that even
 those who us:d to agree with him now dissent
 from. Things that even President Johnson
 dared not do."
 Tung cited what he called Nixon's "escala-
 tion" of the war in Laos, the overthrow of
 Prince Sihanouk in Cambodia (which IranolN
 claims was a CIA plot) and now the inva-
 sion of Cambodia.     `
 Nixon even succeeded In making a Commu-
 nist ally out of Cambodia's pleasure-loving
 Prince Sihanouk, Thing scoffed.
 "We couldn't do that," he said, "but your
 Nixon did."
 The editor noted sarcastically that Nixon
 undertook the Cambodian operation only
 days after his Secretary of State told Con-
 gress it wouldn't be done, and after a Senate
 committee voted against helping the Lon
 Nol government of Cambodia.
 "Nixon acted in defiance of the Legisla-
 ture," Tung said. "His acts bring much dis-
 sent. He is more unpopular than Kennedy
 or Johnson.
 "Nixon claims his 'silent majority' supports
 him. But that is' self-deception. The votes
 cast for Nixon in your last election were not
 meant for him to expand the war, but 'to end
 Many Americans may find it poor taste for
 an official, of a Communist dictatorship- to
 criticize the President for falling to consult
 public opinion.
 A number of American bomb casings that
 have fallen on Vietnamese soil have been de-
 risively painted with his name.
 Billboards, slogans and cartoons mock him.
 And one day, in the southern part of the
 country, while American planes were roaring
 overhead cn a bombing mission, a 23-year-old
 girl looked up and said quietly:  "Nixon's
 airplanes."
 ORDER OF BUSINESS
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore. In accordance with the previous
 order, the Senator from South Carolina
 is recognized for not to exceed  20
 minutes.
 Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, there
 can be no doubt that there is an urgent
 the alarming rate of crime that is flour-
 ishing in our Nation. This is particularly
 true in the District of Columbia. S. 2601,
 the District of Columbia crime bill, pro-
 vides these additional measures, and will,
 in my judgment, be instrumental in ef-
 fecting a reduction  in the number of
 crimes committed. However, it is unfor-
 tunate that certain provisions of this bill
 have been, and still are, the subject of
 gross misunderstanding by responsible
 critics and inaccurate reporting by the
 news media.
 Mr. President, the provisions of this bill
 have been exhaustively studied in com-
 mittee by the House and the Senate,
 debated on the floor and again studied
 by the House-Senate conference. All pro-
 visions which were deemed unconstitu-
 tional or unwise were eliminated. How-
 ever, there is still controversy surround-
 ing pretrial detention and no-knock pro-
 visions of this bill. Critics of these meas-
 ures have argued that such provisions
 are unconstitutional and will be misused
 by the courts and law enforcement offi-
 cials. It seems to me that a careful read-
 ing of this bill and a study of its legisla-
 tive history, should dispel any doubts one
 could possibly have regarding its con-
 stitutionality or the fact that many safe-
 guards were included in order that the
 possibility of misuse would be eliminated.
 Let us first consider pretrial detention.
 t must be remembered that the concept
 eluded in the American Law Institute's
 model code of criminal procedure. In
 the mid-1960's pretrial detention was
 considered by the Senate Subcommittee
 on Constitutional Rights and by the
 House Judiciary Committee. In 1966, the
 President's Commission on Crime in the
 District of Columbia recommended legis-
 lation to authorize the pretrial detention
 of those defendants who present "a truly
 high risk to the safety of the commu-
 nity." Since that time, other studies have
 been undertaken by the District of Col-
 umbia Metropolitan Police Department,
 the U.S. Attorney's Office, and the Judi-
 cial Council Committee To Study the Op-
 eration of the Bail Reform Act in the Dis-
 trict of Columbia. All of these studies
 confirmed the fact that a system of pre-
 trial detention was necessary to prevent
 dangerous criminals from committing
 additional. crimes after being released on
 bail.           .
 These studies, showing the serious
 problem" of  recidivism  during  bail,
 prompted the measure we now have be-
 fore us. However, some critics argue that
 pretrial detention is repressive and that
 ruler.                            _
 Section 23-1322 of the act provides in
 part that:
 (a) Subject to the provisions of this sec-
 tion, a judicial officer may order pretrial de-
 tention of-
 (1) a person charged with a dangerous
 crime     . If the Government certifies by
 motion that based on such person's pat-
 tern of behavior consisting of his past and
 present conduct, and on the other factors set
 out in Section 23-1321(b), there is no con-
 dition or combination of conditions which

 mese  border.  They  seem  to
 have performed other functions
 too.
 It  was publicly known that
 sometime in late April. the U.S.
 began  airlifting thousands of
 Khmer Krom troops into -he
 Cambodian  capital  of  Phnom
 Penh to help defend the Lon
 Not regime. The Senate staffers'
 inquiries about the precise date
 when the Khmer Krum had in-
 tervened in Cambodia were all
 rebuffed by U.S. military and
 civilian officials in Phnom Penh
 and Saigon.
 But an American newsman in
 Phnom  Penh  told  Lowenstein
 and Moose "that he had talked
 to one of the Khmer soldiers
 who had told him that he 1-ad
 been in Phnom Penh for four to
 six weeks. which would mean
 that he had arrived there during
 the month of March." i Empha-
 ,;is mine-T.F.
 This is a crucially important
 admission. Prince Norodom Si-
 hanouk was ousted by the Lon
 Not clique on March 18. but the
 country was supposed to have
 remained at least theoretically
 neutral until near the end of
 April. The new Lon Nol regime
 made quite a point of the as-
 `Viet Cong"
 sertion  that. the "
 and "North Vietnamese" were
 the only foreign troops in Cam-
 bodia. Now we find that CIA-
 trained ethnic Cambodian troops
 were in the Cambodian capital
 in  March.  perhaps during  or
 even before the Lon Nol coup.
 This may go a long way to-
 ward explaining many of the be-
 wildering events of March in
 I STATINTL
 Phnom Penh.".which were so un-
 characteristic of the Cambodians
 and baffled people who had liv-
 ed and worked with them for
 years. No one would have thought
 that  Cambodians  could  have
 been organized  to attack and
 plunder  the embassies of the
 Provisional Revolutionary Gov-
 ernment of South Vietnam or
 the Democratic Republic of Viet-
 nam. Almost no one would have
 thought it possible for the easy-
 going, tolerant Cambodians to
 launch real pogroms against the
 peaceful: Roman Catholic fisher-
 men of Vietnamese descent who
 live in a separate quarter of
 Phnom Penh. 'Yet. these things
 happened. and Cambodians were
 seen waving banners inscribed:
 --Kill the Viet Cong! ' If it were
 to be assumed that the leaders
 of these activities and the bru-
 massacres which  followed
 tal
 were Khmer Krom, 'trained CIA
 killers who have been fighting
 'in  South  Vietnam  for years
 against the National Liberation
 Front. then many people would
 feel that things begin to fall into
 place.
 Even if none of these assump-
 tions are made, however, the
 fact that the CIA's Khmer. Krom
 troops were in Phnom Penh in
 March is enough to rule out the
 possibility that the Lon Nol coup
 was a home-made affair.

 hatred reached a critical level. In twoo and
 threes boys and young men climbed the cab
 and tailgate of our truck to glare down at
 us. They shook their fists. Several made ob-
 scene gestures. At one point an older man
 clambered to the cab roof and berated us.
 There was a respite when a young Vlet-
 nameso soldier arrived and ordered the villag-
 era off the truck. He asked a few questions
 and then he, too, assured us we would not
 be shot. He and others tied strips of toweling
 tightly around our heads, blindfolding us.
 Someone took me by the hand. Linking hands
 with Mike and he with Beth, we climbed over
 the tailgate to the ground.
 A slip knot of. binder twine went over my
 right wrist, and the other end was tied to a
 motorbike. Mike's wrist was tied the same
 way. "Di, dl, di" came the command. Blind-
 folded, stumbling, fearful of breaking an
 ankle, we ran as fast as we could to keep up
 with the bike.
 Several hundred villagers had gathered, and
 .the  motorbike  pulled  up  through  their
 gantlet. Fists and hands hit and shoved W
 from both sides. "Beat the Americans to
 death," the people shouted angrily.
 Eventually the voices faded. The motorbike
 kept going, and we kept running. We must

 TIMES OF TERROR
 In nearly six weeks of hiding in jungle and
 paddyland there were times of terror when
 our lives were at stake. There also were much
 boredom and occasional happy times playing
 chess with our captors and making a feast of
 roast dog. We lost weight, but except for
 some ant bites, minor infections and dysen-
 tery, we came out in reasonably good health.
 It also was a newspaperman's, once-in-a-
 lifetime opportunity to see life on the other
 side in the chaotic new conflict that has
 spilled over from the war in Vietnam.
 We saw a well-organized movement of
 Cambodian and Vietnamese guerrillas in a
 determined war against American tanks and
 planes. We gradually learned about their
 hatred of America, their tactics, their rela-
 tionship with the Cambodian peasants and
 what kind of people they are, as we traveled

 S l`I,VERAI., areas in Asia, Africa and Latin America have
 been the scene of reactionary plots in the first half of 1970.
 One of them, in Cambodia, , culminated in a coup d'etat.
 Information filtering into the press suggests that all the plots can
 be traced to the US Central Intelligence Agency headquarters at
 Langley.
 Of course, the State Department consistently denies American
 complicity, and CIA guilt cannot always be pinpointed. In fact,'
 it may well be that not all these conspiracies were directly
 instigated and organised by imperialist secret services--in some
 cases they may have joined at a later stage. But this much is
 certain: everywhere the cloak-and-dagger operators have been
 at work.

 sujipoirt the aggressive forces. It was to be achieved by use of

 Three Come Back
 "It was an experience we'll never for-
 get," said Richard Dudman, "and it was
 a journalistic opportunity like nothing
 we've ever had before." The veteran cor-
 respondent for the St. Louis Post-Dis-
 patch grinned, then added: "Now that it's
 over we can say that." Elizabeth Pond of
 the Christian Science Monitor expressed
 a universal sentiment: "I hope this proves
 to be a precedent for the treatment of
 other journalists who may now be in
 Cambodia."
 Dudman, Miss Pond and Michael
 Morrow of Dispatch News Service were
 back in Saigon after 51 weeks in the
 J
 hands of soldiers who identified them-
 selves as members of the "pro-Siha-
 nouk  Cambodian  United  National
 Front." In a carefully worded joint state-
 ment they reported that their only rough
 treatment occurred on the day of their
 capture, along Highway One about two
 miles west of Svay Rieng in the Par-
 rot's Beak area of Cambodia.
 Suspected of being CIA agents, they
 were taken at gunpoint in a truck to sev-
 eral Cambodian villages and displayed
 as American captives. At their last stop
 they were blindfolded and marched
 through a gauntlet of jeering villagers.
 The two men next were tied behind a mo-
 torbike and forced to run half a mile,
 blindfolds still on. Then they were
 knocked to the ground with blows on
 the head and left in a darkened room
 with their hands tied behind them.
 In Ten Homes. But once their cre-
 dentials as correspondents were estab-
 lished, they were treated with "kindness
 and consideration" as they traveled
 about 200 miles, staying in ten dif-
 ferent village homes. At one point they
 were asked to tape-record, apparently
 for the Liberation Radio or Hanoi, state-
 ments about their experiences, "but none
 that conflicted with our own views."
 Eventually, the trio were honored
 guests at a meeting of 1,000 villagers
 at which speakers "expressed the grat-
 itude of the Cambodian people toward
 those Americans who oppose aggression
 by the Nixon Administration in Indo
 china." They were also given an in-.
 terview with a military commander of
 the Cambodian United National Front.
 The joint statement did not provide de-
 tails of the interview. Obviously, the
 three correspondents were holding back
 some facts for first-person stories. Buts
 they did report asking for informations
 on the 20 other newsmen still missing
 in Cambodia. They got no reply.

 ANGST LOGIC          STATINTL
 Civil was has raged for 20 years in Laos, situated west of Vietnam, north of
 Cambodia, east of Thailand, south of China. Progressive forces, led by prince Sou-
 phanouvong, chairman of the central committee of the Laotian Patriotic Front, now
 occupy virtually two-thirds of the country. The remaining third, along the west-
 ern border with Thailand, is in the hands of a coalition "neutralist" and rightist
 regime supported by the U.S. (more than $50 million a year) which sits in Vientiane,
 the administrative capital.
 In the last months, the Laotian Patriotic Front has registered victory after
 throughout Laos.  On June 9, patriotic forces captured the strategic town of Sar-
 evane.           In recent weeks, the liberation army has gone on the offensive in dozens
 of areas, including battles with troops from Thailand sent into Laos by the cor-
 rupt Bangkok military government to bolster the shakey Vientiane regime.
 During his recent swing through Southeast Asia Guardian staff correspondent
 Wilfred Burchett submitted four questions to prince Souphanouvong.  Following are
 his answers, received last week.
 What is the present military situation in Laos?  The Western press mentions
 that in capturing towns like Attopeu and Saravane, the Pathet Lao forces have for
 the first time violated the 1962 cease-fire line. What is your comment?
 .The present military situation in Laos shows that on the one hand the American
 escalation of "special war" has been redoubled and on the other that the deeper
 they plunge in such escalation the greater will be the defeat of the U.S. and its
 puppets.  From a strategic viewpoint they were severely defeated in the Plain of
 Jars.  Indeed, this was the first serious defeat in Laos for President Nixon's
 theory of using puppet troops with maximum American firepower.
 Despite such escalation the U.S. and puppet forces were not able to change the
 situation in their favor.  On the contrary, they have been driven onto the defensive
 from a military point of view and politically they are more isolated than ever.
 As for the Laotian patriotic forces they have retained and constantly developed
 their position of active initiative.  After having kicked the enemy out of the
 Plain of Jars and completely, recaptured the whole area, the patriotic forces direc-
 ted their attack against the hideout of the "special forces" at Sam Thong-Long
 Cheng.  They liberated Attopeu and other places near the Bolovens plateu.  That
 is to say they have punished the enemy in the jumping off points and bases for
 their criminal attacks.
 Right from the start the Laotian patriotic forces have serupulously respected
 the letter of the 1962 Geneva agreements.  But as the U.S. and puppet forces have
 undertaken a most criminal war of aggression against the the rest of the country. in fact they have completely

 population.
 The U.S. air force has bombed and machine-gunned
 our Laotian territory for six years on end, sowing death
 and destruction over the whole country and using their
 r"N, air power as tactical support for puppet troops in their
 Lam' attacks into the regions held by our side. It is clear that
 without air support  the  puppet  troops would  be
 incapable of carrying out any actions of any importance.,
 But U.S. air superiority has in no way weakened the
 combativity of the patriotic forces of the Laotian;
 people. On the contrary, this has brought about well,
 deserved return blows resulting in defeat for 'the
 aggressors.          _ .                           '
 The U.S. has not only used Thailand as a springboard
 for its aggression against Laos, as a logistic base for its
 "special war" and as a base for aerial bombardments of
 Laos, it has also introduced Thai combat units in
 support of the puppet troops. In giving a hand to. the
 Americans and in pursuing at the same time their own
 expansionist aims in Laos, the reactionary authorities in
 Bangkok are guilty of complicity with the American
 aggressors.
 Ever since Nixon came into power he has intensified
 the war of aggression against Lao?. For example, by the
 attack against the Meng Khoung region in the Plain of
 Jars; the intensification of air attacks at the end of 1969
 ,and the beginning of 1970 to a degree and ferocity never
 before known, including B-52 raids in south and north
 Laos. Still more serious, the Americans have introduced
 ,thousands of Thai infantry and artillery troops and
 Saigon puppet commander troops to take part in combat
 operations. This state of affairs has doubled the anxiety
 of certain political. circles in the United States and
 among the U.S. people, who feel that one escalation will
 lead to another and that Laos will become a second
 Vietnam.
 Nixon has advanced all sorts of slanderous arguments
 and fallacious pretexts to justify U.S. aggression against
 Laos. In using such pretexts as the "presence and
 aggression  by North Vietnam troops" while it is
 precisely Vietnam that is the victim of U.S. aggression,
 Nixon is only reviving old slanders exposed long ago and
 condemned by public opinion. Nixon has even advanced,
 "protection of American lives in South Vietnam" to
 justify the bombing and military activities in Laos. He
 used the same argument to invade Cambodia with over
 100,000 U.S. and Saigon troops. This is gangster logic,
 making mockery of the rights of peoples and elementary
 rules governing relations between nations. .
 It is not a question of discussing the various pretexts
 advanced by the U.S. aggressors. The real question is
 that this "international gendarme" has absolutely, no
 right to threaten with destruction any people in any
 country at all.       -
 The U.S. has no right to carry out its criminal
 aggression against Laos, a country situated half way
 around the globe from the U.S. If the U.S. halts its air
 attacks and all other acts of military escalation and ends
 its interference and aggression against Laos to enable the
 Laotian people to settle their own affairs, the situation
 in  Laos woula  immediately return to normal. All
 Laotian problems would be satisfactorily solved and lives
 and dollars of the American people would cease to be
 uselessly squandered in Laos. This is the true way to
 safeguard American lives as well as the dignity and
 authentic interests of the United States.
 How do you evaluate the recent Summit conference
 in which you recently took part ,with Prime Minister
 Pham Van Dong of tare DRV, Nguyen Huu Tho of the
 fight Indochinese." The success of the conference
 highlighted new progress in the anti-U.S. struggle for the
 national salvation of the three countries of Indochina
 and marked an important contribution to the struggle
 for national independence and peace in Southeast Asia
 and in the world in general. That is why it was widely
 acclaimed and warmly supported by a very large section
 of international public opinion. The joint declaration of
 the conference (Guardian, May 30, 1970) is one of unity
 and struggle against the common enemy and will serve to
 reinforce and extend the relations of support, mutual
 help and long term cooperation. between the peoples of,
 Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
 The program will still further and intensify the
 coordination and unity of efforts deployed by the three
 countries in their fight against U.S. imperialist aggres-,
 sion. It will lead the struggle of the Lao, Khmer and
 Vietnamese people to new heights and will lead to
 complete victory over U.S. interference and aggression,
 transforming Indochina  into an authentic area of
 independence and peace.              ' -

 the United States and the world in general. This is
 nothing but a most adventurous act committed at a
 moment when American troops are in a defensive,
 .passive posture. A mortal blow has been dealt to the
 "Vietnamizatiort"  concept  in South Vietnam. The
 American forces have got themselves further bogged
 down in Cambodia. The development of this large-scale
 attack with over 100,000 GIs and South Vietnamese
 puppet troops proves the U.S. has not attained its
 strategic objectives there.
 The development of the situation in Cambodia, after
 the U.S.-dirccted overthrow of the Cambodian head of
 state Norodom Sihanouk has also not turned out as the
 Americans expected.  Responding to the five-point
 declaration of prince Sihanouk (Guardian, April 11,
 1970), the political program of the National United
 Front (Guardian, June 20, 1970) and the manifesto of
 the Royal Government of National Union, the Cambod-
 ian people's struggle has developed very rapidly on a
 national level, taking over vast areas of the countryside
 including many towns and dealing heavy blows at the
 U.S.-Saigon forces, shaking to its very foundations the
 Lon Nol-Sirik Matak regime recently installed in Phnom
 Penh.
 In extending the war of aggression to the whole of
 Indochina the Americans have got further bogged down
 and are in a critical impasse. This military adventure of
 the Nixon administration has only caused further
 indignation and swelled the movement of opposition to
 the war within the U.S.. itself. From- Congress to the
 university, from the lawmakers to GIs in numerous
 military bases in the U.S., from towns in the East to
 those in the West, the struggle of the American people
 has developed in increasingly powerful waves of protest.
 The Nixon administration is attacked on two sides-
 bogged down in Indochina and in the U.S. itself.

 r?
 The anti-war element that enjoyed a field day
 condemning the United States role in the ouster
 of Prince Sihanouk as ruler of Cambodia must find
 a new arrow for its bow. The United States has been
 ,,cleared of participation in that coup by no less
 than the Communists themselves.
 When vindication comes from the people who .i
 stand to lose most because of the coup, it must be
 factual. It, probably is disconcerting to the anti-war
 ,element which seems to prefer the accusations from
 the outside. The anti-war element has endeavored to
 bolster its position by airing the charges the CIA instigated the coup.
 While the "at home" element' was thus en-
 gaged it has been significant that foreign countries i
 were strangely silent. Soviet Russia had little, to
 say, indicating the possession of pertinent infor-
 mation that Red China either did not have' ? or
 .chose to disregard.       S
 It is possible that Communist vindication was not intended for general distribution but rather for '
 .a restricted circle. It.also may be the case where
 Cambodian Communists refuse to follow the lines
 established at Peking.
 What does, count heavily is that the United
 states has been cleared. . Those. who have used the?

 changed political climate creating the de-
 mand for additional military involvement.
 THE EFFECT of the President's 10-day-
 turnabout  -  from his promise of troop
 withdrawal and the expected slow-down of
 fighting to his sudden. decision to send a
 massive strike-force into Cambodia - has
 drawn  heated and  widespread  criticism,
 which the President, himself predicted would
 follow his decisive action.   -
 At the time of his announcement, he cit-
 ed the hazards to his political future, but
 he appeared confident nonetheless that the
 Majority of Americans would come around
 to his support. Indeed, a Gallup poll, con-ducted immediately after the Cambodian
 announcement, showed 51 per cent of those
 who heard the President approved his ac-
 tion.
 BUT PERHAPS these recent events -
 a nd the strident protests they stirred
 around the world - will help refocus na-
 tional attention on questions of morality
 and honesty, rather than on the; "success" of
 military strategies.
 Will Amerioa?'s leaders begin to listen to
 these voices of protest? Will the tragic-stu-
 dent uprisings help them see that the pri-
 mary role of a peacemaker is to remain
 open, to try to hear and understand what'
 the opposition is saying, no matter how
 "wrong" they may appear to be?
 Will the American people soon awaken to
 the dangers of relying on the "invincible"
 military machinery to give them security
 and "peace" in a world torn by suffering
 and strife?
 The world's religious leaders, galvanized.
 into action by well-founded fear of global
 war, have suggested the 'abandonment of
 military security in favor of Christian risk-
 taking. The times, they say, demand new
 approaches, new resolve, new hopes.
 Judged from the viewpoint of military
 expediency,  it was without doubt sound
 strategy. But the protesters among religious
 leaders argue that, from a moral viewpoint,
 it is indefensible. The American bishops, for
 [example, cite the "just war" theory in their
 1966 peace statement. The just-war princi-
 ple (which traces its venerable beginnings'
 back-to St. Ambrose and St. Augustine in I
 the 4th and "5th Centuries) states that a
 war is justifiable only if it 'meets certain -
 basic conditions, among which are: The war
 must be declared by just authority, it 'must.
 be entered for a just cause, it must employ ;
 just means, and it must have reasonable
 expectation - of success.
 the Cambodian situa-
 tion in light of the just-war theory:
 0 The military action was not author-
 ized by the Cambodian government or by a, 1
 consensus of the American people or by their
 elected representatives.'                    i
 ? The just cause was professed. to be the i.
 protection of American fighting men from a
 suspected  enemy  build-up  in  Cambodia.
 Subsequent news reports from U, S. troops
 AND SO WE JOIN our voice with
 churchmen who have called upon govern-
 ments to risk a new venture - withdrawal.
 of troops and ending the war through "set-
 tlement by international arrangement." An
 opportunity - perhaps the last - has been
 presented to the United States by the Unit-
 ed Nations Secretary General U Thant.
 Thant, urging "the parties involved" to
 take  "urgent,  decisive  measures  toward
 peace," warned of new threats "not only for,
 the peoples of Indo-China but for the whole
 of mankind." He called for an international'
 conference, suggesting that a neW, unspeci-'
 fied search for a solution such as those held
 in 1954 and 1962 should be undertaken
 immediately, "whatever their form."
 We appeal to the, nation's Catholics -
 bishops, clergy, Religious and ' laity, who.
 now comprise nearly . a quarter of the total
 U. S. population - to lend their strong
 support to this hopeful, - peacemaking Yen-
