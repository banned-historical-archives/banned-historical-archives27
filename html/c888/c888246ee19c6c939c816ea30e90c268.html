KASHMIR FUMBLE? 
CI tuestioned 
On India Policy 
By HENRY S. BRADSHER 
Star Staff Writer 
HONG KONG?Recent revelations about Central Intelli-
gence Agency estimates on the India-Pakistan war raise curious 
questions. 
How balanced are the sources of the CIA's information in a 
place like New Delhi? In other words, how vulnerable is the 
agency to one-sided rumors? 
Some of the CIA estimates 
contained in the Anderson pa-
pers disclosed in Washington 
amount to rumors circulating 
in the Indiana capital at the 
beginning of the war last 
month. They were rumors 
that well-informed Indian 
sources flatly denied at the 
time?and their denials seem 
to have been borne out by de-
velopments. 
? The CIA thought India was 
going to make an all-out at-
tempt to smash the military 
power of West Pakistan and 
capture the Pakistani-held 
part of disputed Kashmir 
state, according to the Ander-
son papers. This was reported 
as an Indian goal after captur-
ing East Pakistan? which is 
now Bangladesh. 
Helms Quoted 
Richard Helms, CIA direc-
tor, is quoted as telling a Dec. 
8 meeting of Washington's spe-
cial action group on the India-
Pakistan war: 
"It is reported that prior to 
terminating the present hostil-
ities. Mrs. (Indira) Gandhi 
(Indian Prime Minister) in-
tends to attempt to eliminate 
Pakistan's armor and air 
force capabilities." 
Helms and Dr. Henry A. 
Kissinger, President Nixon's 
national security adviser, 
thought India intended to 
seize the rest of Kashmir, the 
Himalayan state which India 
claims but Pakistan has held 
part of for a quarter-century. 
The U.S. government's 
"tilt" toward Pakistan appar-
ently was based on these as-
sumptions of Indian intentions 
to try to smash West Pakistan 
into "an impotent state," as 
Kissinger put it. 
But were those ever really 
the serious intentions of the 
people who controlled policy in 
New Delhi, rather than being 
simply the dr am of some -F 
dian hawks vROp.riet 
policy? 
Interpretation  
Report Cited 
This correspondent reported 
from New Delhi Dec. 9, and 
The Star published Dec. 10, 
that "the best available indi-
cations are that India will 
want to bring the war to a 
speedy end once Bangladesh is 
cleared" of Pakistani troops. 
The dispatch went on: "In-
dian military commanders 
have been itching for a chance 
to smash Pakistani tank and 
warplane strength in the West 
with major battles which they 
are confident of winning. But 
political control of the situa-
tion, heavily influenced by 
the Soviets, is against provok-
ing big battles." 
There was considerable So-
viet pressure on India to hurry 
up and capture East Pakistan 
and then end the war. Both 
Moscow and New Delhi envis-
aged the capture "and then 
cease-fire on the Western 
front," that dispatch said. 
India declared the cease-fire 
the day after Dacca fell. 
The dispatch, and several 
others that repeated the same 
points as background to devel-
opments, was based on high-
ranking informants in both the 
Indian government and Saviet 
mission in New Delhi. 
What they said would hap-
pen is what happened, contra-
ry to the Helms-Kissinger ex-
pectations. The question is 
what sort of sources the CIA 
was using. 
Embassy Locked 
One correspondent, even one 
with the kind of contacts built 
up by five years of reporting 
from New Delhi and almost as 
long from Moscow, cannot 
compete with the CIA's exten-
sive system of sources for in-
formation. That other political 
o ease02 9 a 
section in the U.S i 
its doors locked, as distinct 
from the political section with 
an open-door policy?picks up 
all sorts of information. 
Maybe the problem is evalu-
ation. If the CIA heaps Indian 
generals talking about smash-
ing Pakistani military power, 
maybe it believes them rather 
than believing those quieter ci-
vilians wlio hold them back. 
The armed forces in India 
never have been able to do as 
they pleased regardless of ci-
vilian politicians, unlike a 
number of other undevel-
oped countries and overdevel-
oped generals with which the 
CIA is a lot more familiar. 
And Mrs. Gandhi is not the 
personality to let her armed 
forces start such impudence, 
as anyone who has been in 
India long should know. 
Weather Problms 
As for India's trying to take 
Pakistani territory problems 
of winter weather and the lo-
gistical situation of the Indian 
army were involved. 
Perhaps Helms and Kissin-
ger had noted the Indian state-
ment that India would no long-
er respect the old United Na-
tions cease-fire line dividing 
Kashmir and they had made 
the herotic jump of lbgic?or, 
considering the georgraphy, 
winter and logistics, illogic?to 
conclude that India wanted to 
capture everything beyond the 
line. 
But in fact, as reported from 
New Delhi, Indias' ambitions 
were limited to clearing out 
some Pakistani army outposts 
that endangered Indian coma-
The U.S. government has 
argued that its estimate was 
right and that only its efforts 
prevented the larger war 
which it foresaw. Thus, the 
dispatch of a naval task force 
built around the nuclear pow-
ered aircraft carrier Enter-
prise to the Bay of Bengal has 
been claimed in Washington to 
have had the effect of limiting 
india's war aims. And Ameri-
can influence in Moscow got 
the Soviets to restrain Indian 
according to claims. 
Perhaps this will have to be 
marked down in the doubtful 
column on U.S. policy influ-
ence and results. Perhaps 
Washington more influential in 
limiting the South Asian viar

In pain over our disclosure of 
their India-Pakistan secrets, 
have slipped fragments from 
the same secret documents to 
their friends in the press. 
This illustrates how the 
White House uses official se-
crecy to control the flow of 
news to the public. Favorable West Pakistan. But the same 
facts are leaked out; unfavora- disgests also suggested India 
nation reserved for the dar-
kest of the CIA's secrets. 
Alsop's 'Proof' 
Alsop told us he never read 
the CIA reports himself. He 
had no way of knowing, there-
fore, that his sources gave him 
only part of the story. 
These CIA digests, true 
enough, raised the possiblity 
of an Indian attempt to crush 
ble news is suppressed. 
? The official le.akers are nm,v 
spreading the word that Presi-
dent Nixon's pro-Pakistan pol-
icy was not the disaster it ap-
peared but really saved West 
Pakistan from dismember-
ment. 
' As evidence, the boys in the 
basement leaked a few selec-
tive .secrets to our column-
writing colleague; Joseph 
Alsop, who has excellent con-
tacts at the highest levels of 
government. 
Alsop stated "on positive au-
thority" that the U.S. govern 
merit had "conclusive proof" 
of India's Intention to crush 
the main body of the Pakistan 
army in West Pakistan. This 
positive proof, he wrote, was 
"the centerpiece of every one 
of the CIA's daily reports to 
the White House during the 
crisis period." 
We have read the CIA's 
!daily reports to the White 
, House during the India-Paki-
stan war. They are stamped 
1"Top Secret Umbra," a desig-
would accept an early cease-
fire. 
Here is a typical excerpt: 
"There have been reports that 
(Indian Prime Minister) Gan-
dhi would accept a cease-fire 
and international mediation as 
soon as East Bengal had been 
liberated ... On . the other 
hand, we have had several re-
cent reports that India now in-
tends not only to liberate East 
Bengal but also to straighten 
its borders in Kashmir and to 
destroy West Pakistan's air 
and armored forces." 
The strongest CIA warning 
was sent to the White House 
on December 10. "According 
to a source who has access to 
information on activities in 
Prime Minister Gandhi's of-
fice," declared the report, "as 
soon as the situation in East 
Pakistan is settled, Indian 
forces will launch a major of-
fensive against West Paid-
sten." 
But the CIA also took note 
of repeated Indian assurances 
to American Ambassador Ken 
Lyn Secrets 
Keating that India has no ter-
ritorial ambitions and wished 
only tO end the conflict with 
the least possible bloodshed. 
Dubious 'Proof' 
It is clear from the secret 
documents in our possession 
that the CIA had no "conclu-
sive proof" of an Indian plan 
to dismember West Pakistan. 
The CIA had received a num-
ber of reports that a major In-
dian offensive might be immi-
nent on the western front. But CIA: 
viet Union . .," according to 
the CIA. "Kuznestsov has told 
Indian officials that the Soviet 
Union is not prepared to rec-
ognize Bangladesh until Dacca 
falls and until the Indian 
army successfully liberates 
Bangladesh from Pakistani 
forces," 
The question of an Indian 
offensive . against West "Paki-
stan was brought up the next 
day by Soviet Ambassador Ni-
kolai ? Pegov. Reported the. 
these were discounted by both 
the State and Defense Depart-
ments. 
Only Henry Kissinger, the 
President's foreign policy czar, 
seemed eager to believe the 
worst. 
Alsop's sources also told 
him that President Nixon in. no longer exists. 
tervened with the Kremlin, "If India should decide to 
threatening "an ugly show-
down," to stop Mrs. Gandhi's 
army from. carving up West 
Pakistan. 
In response, Alsop claims 
that the Kremlin hurriedly 
dispatched Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vasily Kuznestsov to 
New Delhi on December 12 to 
tell Mrs. Gandhi not to attack 
West Pakistan. 
The secret CIA report on 
"Pegov pointed out that 
India has achieved a marvel-
ous military victory. Pakistan 
is no longer a military force, 
and it is therefore unneces-
sary for India to launch an of-
fensive into West Pakistan to 
crush a military machine that 
take Kashmir, Pegov added; 
the Soviet Union would not.in-
terfere, but India would have 
to accomplish this objective. 
within the shortest possible 
time." 
Joseph Alsop is an enter-
prising and conscientious col-
umnist. He acknowledged to 
us that "it is possible to be 
lied to on the very highelst 
level." But he assured us his 
his mission, however, doesn't source had "never lied be-
mention any ultimatum fore." 
The evidence in our posses-
sion, however, suggests that

peekaboo with CIA secrets to 
distort the truth.

BY WILLARD EDWARDS 
(Chicano Tribune Press Service] 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15?The 
Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion has reportedly narrowed 
an original field of about 200 
suspects down to a few individ-
uals in its pursuit of the feder-
al official responsible for leak-
ing secret documents dealing 
with the India-Pakistan crisis to 
columnist Jack Anderson. 
One highly placed staff aide, 
in particular, is under suspi-
cion. His identification, if and 
when it comes, should serve to 
dispel some of the wide-rang-
ing speculation published about 
this incident. 
? But in the strange world of 
the capital, where political ma-
neuvers command more atten-
tion than illegal acts, the 
? "why" of the leak to Anderson 
has provoked more concern 
than the "who" and the 
"how." 
Second Thoughts Begin 
The first instinctive reaction . 
here of many was almost 
unanimous: "Someone in gov-
ernment must surely hate

But, after a few days, second I

about the motive inspiring this I

Under examination, the "get-

lose substance. A higher target

the President in national secu-
rity affairs, was initially 
thought to be the intended vic-

President Nixon 
sessed, it became evident that 
Kissinger was always Presi-
dent Nixon's spokesman, relay-
ing his impatience and his de- . 
m ands for an anti-Indian! 
"tilt." ' 
The President, Kissinger re-

sumably in a voice dripping.

Anderson, it was suggested, 
has a good chance of beating 
this charge in the District-of 
Columbia ferliral courts where, 
it is well known in the legal 
world, "liberal" jurists domi-
nate the judicial philosophy. 
Thus, a precedent could be set 
by similar leniency in Ells-
berg's later trial. 
There is this much to sup-
port such an admitted venture 
into surmise: Powerful groups 
in government and the journal-
istic world are determined to 
protect Ellsberg from the con-
sequences of his confessed vio-

tions, he may not yet be quite one with Nineveh and Tyre, 
but he's getting there. Today he seems so quaintly , and 
dimly World War II-ish that he takes his place with the 
intrepid commando, the gung-ho 'Marine, and Rosie the 
Riveter?all cherishable dements of our folklore in their 
time but now grown a touch fusty, somewhat stale around 
the edges. The fictional 007 having long since become a 
ividesereen joke, it is a little hard to take US/7-362, his 
honest-to-god counterpart, very seriously. 
, ,Ladislas Farago does, though, and in no less than 696 
pages of unrelenting prose. Your average writer can lead 
It long, productive life without once using the word "spy-
master," but Farago uses it four times on one page, and 
three of the four times in the same sentence. his book is 
trumpeted on the cover as "more exciting than any spy 
thriller,"-' which is a little puzzling, since the book in-
Richard Hauser is the author of Putsch! How Hitler Made 
Revolution.  
dubitably is a spy' thriller. Its area is German espionage 
in America and Britain- during WW II, a field in which 
Farago is thoroughly grounded. This is his sixth or sev-
enth book on spying? and helms had some rather special 
experience at first hand in that curious endeavor. Though 
a naturalized citizen, and a native of a country with which 
we were at war, he rose high in U.S. Naval Intelligence, 
an exploit that not just every immigrant who comes 
through customs could duplicate. (It is perhaps not nec-
essary to explain that Farago comes from Hungary. Hun-
garians, as we know, have a knack.) 
The Game of Foxes tells how agents of the Abwehr, 
the German Intelligence Service, pulled off such dazzling 
feats of cloaking and daggering as swiping the Norden 
bomb sight, trickling spivs into sensitive spots in Wash-
ington and Lo don, ta hihe osevelt-Cht

(Well, perhaps not. eVerything. We are never told the

stolen by the. CIA from the laboratory 'cif "a noted Vien-
nese Urologist.") 
. - 
At the end, though, one wonders whether the game of 
foxes has been worth the candle. Despite the successes, of 
Nazi eSpionage--semetimes detailed here with what can 
only be called misplaced enthusiasm?nothing really de-
cisive was accomplished. The theft of the Norden bomb-
sight did not win the air war for Germany. Stealing secrets 
of Allied shipping and troop mpveinents did not prevent 
our troops and supplies from getting there, and in over-. 
whelming quantities. Eavesdropping on Roosevelt and 
Churchill, if it actually occurred, did not save Hitler and 
Goering and Goebbels from dying like dogs in utter de.-: 
feat. As the Bible itself 'says', the little foxes spoil the vines'. 
They do not brinc, down the house. -

dark loft of the National Archives in Washington, D.C." 
The find was a forgotten footlocker Which :turned out to.". 
contain microfilm documents on the inteimal 'workings of 
the Abwehr under its enigmatic chief, Admiral Canaris. 
Farago has based his story on what he calls "the incon-
trovertible evidence of the {Abwehr's] own' papers.: 
An agency's :Pim papers are seldom incontrovertible 
evidence. of :anything but the agency's natural desire 'to. 
make itself look good. From other sources it 'IS pb86ble to

run by CanariS (who may have been pouring Sand in his 
own gas tank) and caut,lit in an insane tangle of rivalries.

a mushroom-like proliferation in the Third Reich. 
There is, to be sure, a certain fascination in getting this 
unexpected peek into all those Strettg .Geheinil papers 
from that forgotten footlocker, but the fun is a good deal 
diminished by the circumstance that the Abwehr, like Ger-1;' 
many itself, was 'a loSer. How Mitch thrill can there .be in

5iautrShe Rad Kremlin Pied 
Washington, Jan. 14 '(Special)----Columnist Jack Anderson released today the text 
of a summary of another White House meeting on the India-Pakistan war. In it, a 
senior administration official was quoted as attributing to Prime Minister Indira Gan-
dhi a statement that the Soviet Union had promised to take "appropriate counterac-
tion" if China intervened in 
the war. 
The summary of the Dec. 8 
meeting of key administration of-
ficials includes the widely quoted 
remarks by presidential adviser 
Henry A. Kissinger that Presi-
dent Nixon "does not want to be 
even-handed' in his position on 
the war because he "believes that 
India is the attacker." 
Stamped "Secret" 
The summary was one of four 
that Anderson obtained and used 
as a basis for his columns earlier 
this month detailing the adminis-
tration's attempt to cope with the 
India-Pakistan crisis. 
The documents received by 
Anderson were stamped "secret 
sensitive." Anderson published his 
stories on the premise of the 
public's right to know. 
Kissinger charged that Ander-
son quoted him out of context. 
Anderson then made public the 
texts of the summaries of the 
meetings, which were conducted 
by the Washington Special Action

leased the texts of the group's 
meetings Dec. 3, Dec. 4 and Dec. 
6.?  ? 
The Dec. 8 meeting was attend-
ed by 20 representatives of such 
agencies as the CIA, Agency for 
International Development, Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, State Department 
and Defense Department, accord-
ing to the summary. 
Among the main speakers at 
the 70-minute meeting were Kis-
singer; CIA Director Richard M. 
Helms; David Packard, who re-
signed Dec. 14 as deputy secre-
tary of defense; Assistant Secre-
tary of State Joseph J. Sisco; U. 
Alexis Johnson, undersecretary of 
state, and Maurice Williams, dep-
uty administrator of AID. 
Seven-Page Summary 
The India-Pakistan war broke 
out Dec. 3 and ended Dec. 17. 
Packard announced his resigna-
tion Dec. 11, three days after he 
attended the meeting. 
The following are excerpts from 
the seven-page confidential sum-
mary that Anderson made public: 
"Mr. Helms then stated that 
earlier he had omitted mention-
ing that Mme. Gandhi, when re-
ferring to China, expressed the 
hope that there would be no Chi-
nese intervention in the West. 
"Dr. Kissinger said that We 
cannot afford to ease India's 
state of mind. 'The lady' is cold-
blooded and toughu and will not 
turn into a Soviet satellite mere-
ly because of pique. We should 
not ease her mind. He invited 
anyone who objected to this ap-
proach to take his case to the 
President. Ambassador Ken-
neth) Keating, he suggested, is 
offering enough reassurance on 
his own." 
"Next Turn of Screw" 
The summary also shows Kis-
singer's deep interest in U.S. aid 
to India and Pakistan. Pakistan's 
aid was cut off before the war; 
most of India's after it began. 
Having been assured that very 
little aid was getting through to 
India, "Dr. Kissinger inquired 
what the next turn of the screw 
might be." 
At another point, when dis-
cussing the 1972 AID budget, 
'Dr. Kissinger stated that cur-
rent orders are not to put any-
cautioned her that the Chinese thing into the budget for aid to 
might rattle the sword in Lad- India. It was not to be leaded 
dakh but that the Soviets have 1 that AID had put money in the 
promise dto take appropriate 
budget for India only to have the 
counteraction if this should oc- 'wicked' White House take it 
cur. 
Mr. Helms indicate dthat there 
was no Chinese buildup at this 
time, but, nevertheless, even with-
out a buildup, they could make 
'motions and rattle the sword.'" 
(Ladakh, a remote part of 
Kashmir n India, juts between 
China's Sinkiang province and 
Tibet. The Chinese overran the 
area in 1951 and, without the 
Indians finding out about it for 
a year, built a road from Sink-
iang to Tibet across Ladakh's 
Aksai Chin Plateau in an effort 
to protect its Tibetan supply line. 
The Chinese last made a show of 
force in Ladakh in November 
1965.) 
On the Kissinger remark, the 
text reads as follows: 
"Dr. Kissinger said that we are 
not trying to be even-handed. 
There can be no doubt what the 
President wants. The President 
does not want to be even-handed. 
"The President believes that 
India is the attacker. We are 
trying to get across the idea that 
India has jeopardized relations 
with the United States. 
out." 
The document recorded Kissin-
ger's interest in a suggestion 
that the U.S. might get military 
supplies to Pakistan by routing 
them through , Jordan. 
Question of F-104s 
"Mr. Packard explained that 
we could not authorize the Jor-
danians to do anything that the 
USG (United States government) 
could not do," the document read. 
"If the USG could not give the 
F-104s (American F-104 jets) to 
Pakistan, we .could not allow 
Jordan to do so. 
"If a third country had ma-
terial that the USG did not have, 
that was one thing, but we could 
not allow Jordan to transfer the 
104s unless we make a finding 
that the Paks, themselves, were 
eligible to purchase them from 
us directly. 
"Dr. Kissinger suggested that 
perhaps we never really ana-
lyzed what the real danger was 
when we were turning off the 
arms of Pakistan." 
Pressures on Aides 
The pressures on Nixon's ad-
visers to come up with some basis 
for Nixon's apparent sueport for 
Pakistan was seen in the follow-
ing exchange: 
"Ambassador Johnson said 
that we must examine the possi-
ble effects that additional sup-
plies for Pakistan might have. It 
could be that eight F-104s might 
not make any difference once the 
real war in the West starts. They 
could be considered cnly as a 
token. If, in' fact, we were to 
move in West Pakistan we would 
be in a new ballgaine. 
"Ambassador Johnson said that 
one possibility would be our re-
nly to Foreign Minister (Indian 
Foreign Minister Swaran) Singh, 
in which we could acknowledge 
the Indian pledge that they do not 
have territorial designs. He also 
stated we must also consider the 
fact that the Paks may them-
selves by trying to take Kashmir. 
"After discussing various pos-
sible commitments to both Pawis-
tan and India, Mr: Packard stated 
that tre. overriding consideration 
is the practical problem of either 
doing something effective or do-
ing nothing. 
"If you don't win, don't get in-
volved. 
"If we were to attempt some-
thing it would have to be with a 
certainty that it would affect the 
outcome. Let's not get in if we 
are going to lose. Find out some 
way to stay out."

Hill Committees Met Secretly One-Third 
Congressional QuarterlY 
met in secret one-third of the . of Time in 1971- 
. Congressional -committee 
time last year. 
Congressional Quarterly's 
annual tabulation of commit-
tee sessions showed 36 per 
. cent were held behind closed 
doors in 1971, the year a new 
law?aimed at opening meet-
ings to the public?went into 
effect. 
This marked a decrease 
from the 41 per cent closed 
committee sessions recorded in 
1970, but matched the 36 per 
cent secrecy score for 1969. 
. Since 1953, when Congres-
sional 'Quarterly began its an-
nual tally, the highest secrecy 
score was 43 per cent in 1968. 
The record low was 30 per 
cent closed sessions in 1959. 
The House, as usual, topped 
the Senate in the number of 
executive sessions. The public, 
was barred from 41 per cent-
1,131 out of 27,858 of its com-
mittee sessions. This was a de-, 
crease from the 48 per cent of 
1970 but comparable to the 42 
per cent recorded in 1969. 
Senate committees had a se-
crecy score of 30 per cent?
down from the 33 per cent of 
1970 tut up from the 28 per 
cent in 1969. It closed 580 of 
Its 1,905 meetings. 
Most noteworthy in 1971 
was the opening of selected 
House Appropriations Com.-
mittee hearings. 
Although only eight per 
cent of its sessions-36 out of 
a total of 455?were open, this 
was in contrast to the zero per 
cent recorded in the past. 
The Legislative Reorganiza-
tion Act of 1970?the first re-
form act in 24 years?was de-
signed, in part, to open up 
committee proceedings to pub-
lic scrutiny. 
It stipulated that Senate 
committee business meetings 
are to be open, except for 
'markup (when a committee re-
*vises and decides on the final 
language of a bill) and voting 
sessions, or when the commit-
tee closes them by majority 
vote. 
Ninety-seven per cent of 
those Senate committee meet-
ings specifically designated in 
the Congressional Record as 
business sessions?organizing, 
markup, voting, briefing ses-
sions?were closed to the pub-
lic in 1971. 
According to the reorganza; 
lion act, House committee 
business meetings, are to be 
open, except when the com-
mittee closes them by major-
ity vote. 
Excluding the House Appro-
priations Committee, 79 per' 
cent of the sessions listed as 
business were held behind 
closed doors. (House Appropri-
ations subcommittee markup 
sessions are not reported to 
the Record.)

NW RULES URGED 
ON SECRET PAPERS, 
SeCurity Agency Proposes a 
Presidential Order on Law 
Special to The Stew York Times 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10?The 
National Security Council has 
proposed an Executive order 
tightening regulations govern-' 
ing_ the, hen, ng of classified 
information i Suggested the 
possibility that the President 
might seek legislation to make 
it a crime for unauthorized per-
sons to receive secret docu-
ments, a White House officiial 
said Thursday night. 
Tbe legislative suggestion, if 
accepted, would result in a pro-
posal by the President of a 
tough new law similar to the 
British Official Secrets Act, 
which imposes stiff penalties 
on those who receive as well 
as on those who disclose classi-
fied information. 
? This was one of three alter-
natives suggested for the Presi-
dent in a draft proposal now 
being circulated among the De-
partments of State, Defense and 
Justice, the Central Intelligence 
Agency, and other governmen-
tal bodies, the White House of-
ficial said. 
Of the two others, the draft 
suggested that the President 
might seek revision of a sec-
tion of the Federal Esrionage 
Act to make it a crime to give 
classified information to any 
unauthorized person. The law 
noW provides penalties for dis-
closure to "a foreign agent." 
Other Passibility 
The other possibility suggest-
ed .was merely that present 
laws be left unchanged. 
These were the only legis-
lative suggestions in the draft 
proposals, which were offered 
in response to the President's 
demand for a study of the 
handling of classifed material, 
made shortly after the publica-
tion of the Pentagon Papers, 
the . Defense Department's se-
cret study of the United States 
drift into the Vietnam War. ? 
The other suggestions in the 
draft proposal applied primarily 
to the classification of Govern-
ment documents, setting up 
regulations over how materials 
should be classified, the length 
of time certain documents 
could remain classified, and 
who would be allowed to re-
ceive them. 
These, the draft proposal 
said, could be effected in a re-
vision of the Ekecutive order 
that now controls the handling 
of classified information. 
The draft Was being circulat-
ed to the various agencies for 
their comments.

The Secrecy ilemma 
? You can't run the 
Government if every 
important secret is 
going to be handed 
over to the press 
ARTHUR SCHLESINGER Ir. 
A popular Government, without 
-popular information, or the means of 
acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a 
Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. 
?JAMES MADISON (to W. T. Barry, 
Aug. 4, 1822). 
IT .says in the 29th chapter of 
Deuteronomy, "The secret things 
belong unto the Lord our God." 
This has not been a view; however, 
wholly accepted by the American 
press. Last month, when Jack Ander-
son published classified documents 
showing how the Nixon Administra-
tion really felt about the Indo-Paki-
stani war, he observed an established 
tradition of journalism. At the same 
time he transgressed an established 
tradition of government. Here were 
the two solemn principles, disclosure 
and confidentiality, equally porten-
tous and equally-venerated, in sharp 
collision. The conflict of principles 
left many Americans, I would think, 
considerably baffled. 
- OD You can't run a 
free press if it is 
a crime to publish 
everything the Govern. 
ment stamps secret 
membered their intense displeasure 
over equivalent journalistic audacity 
when they were in power. Still, both 
Republicans and Democrats probably 
agree that you cannot run a govern-
ment if every internal memorandum 
is promptly handed to the press. And 
ARTHUR SCHLESINGER Jr. is Albert 
Schweitzer Professor of the Humanities 
at the City University of New York. 
both probably agree that you cannot 
run much of a press if it is a crime 
to publish anything stamped secret 
by the Government. The question is 
whether between these extremes it is 
possible to discern further guiding 
principles. 
One principle surely is that the 
Government's case for a measure of 
secrecy is not altogether frivolous or 
self-serving. "The Federalist" is gen-
erally worth consulting on these mat-
ters; and its authors clearly specified 
. The recent publication of secret , 
documents has produced a collision 
between two equally venerated prin-
ciples?disclosure and confidentiality 
It should have given some too a 
sense of intellectual discomfiture. Re-
publicans who denounced Anderson 
might have remembered their own

DAV/101TMt r 'a a 
two fields where secrecy seemed to 
them essential. The first was diplo-
matic negotiation: "It seldom hap-
pens in the negotiation of treaties, of 
whatever nature, but that perfect 
that "diplomacy shall proceed always' 
frankly and in the public view" and 
called for "open covenants of peace, 
openly arrived at." Before World War 
I the French Assembly did not know 
the secret clauses of the Franco-Rus-
sian alliance; nor did the British For-
eign Secretary inform even his own 
Cabinet of the military understand-
ings between the British and French 
General Staffs. This is what Wilson 
hoped to abolish. 
But, as he himself made clear at 
Versailles, he really meant by "diplo-
macy" not the processes but the re-
sults of negotiation. In practice he 
favored plenty of talk out of "the 
public view" but no concealment of 
results?i.e., open covenants secretly 
arrived at. As for the negotiating 
process, Jules Cambon, who was 
French Ambassador to Berlin before 
World War I and whom that acute 
student of diplomacy Harold Nicolson 
regarded as perhaps the best profes-
sional of the century, was only mildly 
exaggerating when he wrote, "The 
day secrecy is abolished, negotiation 
97 
of any kind will become impossible. 
His recent trans-Atlantic shuttling 
suggests that Henry Kissinger would 
agree. Whether blowing the secrecy 
destroys his capability for future pri-
vate negotiations is a problem that 
one hopes Mr. Kissinger has pondered. 
A second field noted in The Fed-
eralist" as requiring secrecy was that? 
of intelligence: "There are cases where 
the most useful intelligence may be 
obtained, if the persons possessing it 
can be relieved from apprehensions 
of discovery." Contemplation of these 
two fields led "The Federalist" to 
conclude: "So often and so essen-. 
dpcttriro. tia1.416 have we heretofore suffered 
id 
4 0 9R001t0

applauded Anderson might have re- pudiate this doctrine when he said patch, that the Constitution would 
00n t LIMO d 
Approved For Relel 
have been in cusably defective, if 
no attention had been paid to those 
objects." In such terms "The Federal-
ist" vindicated the right of the exec-
utive branch to conduct negotiations 
and, by inference, intelligence opera-
tions, without any immediate obliga-
tion to supply Congress or the people 
the detail of what it was doing. 
So from the start the American 
Government has been into secrecy. 
War, of course, provided a third cate-
gory of legitimate restriction. The 
? National Archives tells us that such 
classifications as "secret," "confiden-
tial" and "private" can be traced back 
to the War of 1812. Military plans, 
movements and weaponry remain 
items that can be plausibly withheld 
from immediate publication. A fourth 
category includes information that 
might compromise foreign govern-
ments or leaders or American friends 
or agents in foreign lands. The case 
for withholding such information is 
obviously strong; as too is the case, 
in a fifth category, for withholding 
personal data given to the Govern-
ment on the presumption that it will 
be kept confidential ? tax returns, 
? personnel investigations and the like. 
A sixth category includes official plans 
and decisions which, if prematurely 
disclosed, would lead to speculation 
in lands or commodities, preemptive 
buying, private enrichment and high-
er governmental costs. One doubts 
whether the most .righteous opponent 
of official secrecy would seriously 
argue that Government must at once 
throw open its files in these six 
categories. 
Yet no one can doubt either that 
a legitimate system of restriction has 
long since escalated into an extrava-
gant and indefensible system of de-
nial. The means by which this has 
been done is primarily the device of 
"security classification"?i.e., restrict-
ing access to public information on 
the grounds of national security. In 
1962 the House Committee on Gov-
ernment Operations found there were 
"more than a million Government 
employes [permitted] to stamp per-
manent security designations on all 
kinds of documents," adding that few 
of them seemed to heed Secretary of 
Defense Robert McNamara's sensible 
injunction, "When in doubt, under-
classify." The General Accounting 
Office estimates that the security 
system costs taxpayers. from $60- to 
$80-million a year.

r? 
no 
e entagon's top security secret' is the specific invention of 
bureaucracy." If secrecy in some 
cases remains a necessity, it also 
can easily become the ? means by 
which Government dissembles its 
purposes, buries its mistakes, safe-
guards its reputation, manipulates 
its citizens, maximizes its power and 
corrupts itself. 
The secrecy system, once out of 
control, offers temptations few gov-
ernments have the fortitude to resist. 
I suppose there may be situations 
of dire emergency when gov-
ernments have no alternative 
but to deceive the people. But 
uncontrolled secrecy makes it 
easy for lying to become rou-
tine. And, even short of lying, 
governments can hardly resist, 
exploiting secrecy to their own 
advantage. There have been 
few greater frauds, for exam-
ple, than the idea put over by 
the executive on Congress and 
public opinion that only those 
with access to classified infor-
mation know enough to have 
a judgment on questions of 
foreign policy. Actually 99 per 
?cent of the information neces-
sary for intelligent political 
judgment is available to any 
careful reader of The New 
York Times. We would have 
been far better off in Vietnam 
during the Kennedy years had 
our Government confined it-
self to reading newspaper dis-
patches and never opened a 
Top Secret cable signed Har-
kins or Nolting. The myth of 
inside information ? "if you 
only knew what we knew"? 
is essentially a trick to ob-
struct democratic control of 
foreign policy and defend the 
monopoly of the national se-
curity bureaucracy. 
As Justice Potter Stewart 
has observed, a secrecy sys-
tem constructed on present 
lines will inevitably be "ma-
nipulated by those intent on 
self-protection and self-pro-
motion." It will also inevita-
bly invite defiance. Indeed, 
given Congressional apathy, 
defiance remains about the. 
only recourse when legitimate 
secrecy balloons into illegiti-
mate secrecy and an adminis-
tration runs the system in the 
interest not of the nation but 
of itself. So, as a corrective, 
aggrieved citizens through our 
history have felt themselves 
morally warranted in violat-
ing what they have seen as a 
system of secrecy laid down 
,unilaterally by the executive

officer, he said, believed that the 
classification system should even ex-
tend to information in the public 
domain; and zealous security-stamp-
ers, particularly in the Navy, had 
been discovered classifying newspaper 
clippings. Florence estimated that the 
Pentagon files contained about 20 
million classified documents and that 
"the disclosure of information in at 
least 99.5 per cent of those classified 
documents could not be prejudicial to 
the defense interests of the nation." 
He later changed this estimate to 
read that 1 to 5 per cent "must legit-
imately be guarded in the national 
interest," but this hardly affects the 
point. The classification system has 
plainly got hopelessly out of control. 
And the reason for this is evident 
enough?it is that the only control 
over the system has been exercised 
by the executive branch itself. The 
legal basis for security classification 
was first provided by general orders 
of the War and Navy Departments; 
then by a 1940 executive order of 
President Roosevelt's, still confined 
to military intelligence; then by a 
1951 executive order of President 
Truman's, extending the system to 
nonmilitary agencies and authorizing 
any executive department or agency 
to withhold information it con-
sidered "necessary in the interest of 
national security"; then in 1953 by 
President Eisenhower's executive 
order 10501?"The bible of security-
stamping," Florence calls it. It was 
as a result of this order that the 
system got completely out of hand, 
for it provides no effective control 
over the classification of documents 
and no feasible method for their 
declassification once the sacred 
stamp has been placed on them. 
Neither the Truman nor Eisen-
hower executive orders were based 
n specific statutory authority; but, 
S Eisenhower's Commission on Gov-
ernment Security argued in 1957: 
'In the absence of any law to the 
ontrary, there is an adequate con-
titutional and statutory basis upon 
hich to prediCate the Presidential 
uthority to issue Executive Order 
0501." This very formulation im-
lies, however, that Congress has 
he power to control the classifica-
ion system should it wish to do so. 
Since Congress has not wished to 
o so, the executive branch has had 
free hand in dealing with classified 
formation. Naturally.this has made 
vulnerable to its own worst 
stincts. "Every bureaucracy," Max

stratagem was defeated. Were 
the Tappans, Gallatin and 
Bryant to be condemned? Or, 
did Tyler's abuse of secrecy 
justify their action? 
The aniwer might well be 
that the functioning of democ-
racy requires some rough but 
rational balance between se-
crecy and disclosure, between 
official control of information 
and public need for it. When 
the Government upsets that 
balance by deceiving the pub-
lic, lying to it or withholding 
information essential for in-
formed debate and decision, a 
healthy democracy is likely 
to move, in one way or an-
other, to re-establish the bal-
ance, whether through the 
agency of dissenting officials, 
indignant legislators or re-
sourceful newspapermen. "Se-
crecy can be preserved," Jus-
tice Stewart has reminded us, 
"only when credibility is truly 
maintained." 
THIS principle of re-estab-
lishing the balance is con-
fessedly elusive. Anyone who 
acts on it is taking a chance. 
Only the aftermath can prove 
him right or wrong in decid-
ing that government has vio-
lated its part of the contract. 
"The line of discrimination be-
tween cases may be difficult," 
as Jefferson wrote in a dis-
cussion of the question wheth-
er the violation of written taw 
was ever justified; "but the 
good officer is bound to draw 
it at his own peril and throw 
himself on the justice of his 
country and the rectitude of 
his motives." 
The Anderson case suggests 
the 'problem. Has the Nixon 
Administration really fulfilled 
Its part of the contract? Has 
it maintained the credibility 
that Justice Stewart tells us is 
necessary tojustify the pres-
tive branch which old Wash-
ington hands regard as the 
least open the country has 
seen for years. Then came the 
Indo-Pakistani war?with the 
President in an evident pet; 
with a valuable Assistant to 
the President for National Se-
curity Affairs saying in private 
"the President does not 
want to be even-handed," 
demanding in private that his 
colleagues "tilt" American 
power in favor of Pakistan, 
while telling the press, "There 
have been some comments 
that the Administration is 
anti-Indian. This is totally in-
accurate" (and while the State 
Department, if that body mat-
ters any longer, was proclaim-
ing in public a stance of "ab-
solute neutrality"); and with 
a proven military dunderhead, 
still inexplicably blessed with 
great responsibility, wrong 
once again in his military fore-
casts. Here, above all, was an 
Administration dead against 
internal or external debate in 
the face of highly controver-
sial decision. 
Given this situation, what 
recourse was there? If the An 
derson columns display the 
kind of Government we have, 
it is surely appropriate in a 
democracy that we know it; 
it is definitely not the func-
tion of a secrecy system to 
shield public officials from ac-
countability for their tantrums, 
folly or mindlessness. Nor did 
the disclosure jeopardize on-
going negotiations or intelli-
gence operations or military 
plans. Worst of all, by out-
lining the "tilt" policy only 
behind locked doors, the Nixon 
Administration deprived Con-
gress and the electorate of the 
opportunity ? one might -say 
the right?to discuss President 
Nixon's pro-Pakistan program 
on its merits. This was the 
unpardonable sin; and some 
anonymous, disgusted and 
courageous bureaucrat, with 
the help of Jack Anderson, 
was trying to rectify the situ-
ation and to re-establish the 
balance.

right to preserve for a period 
both the confidentiality of its 
internal processes and the se-
curity of information in those 
categories where security is 
vital. It has manifestly abused 
that right. Writing in 1953, 
Harold Nicolson said, "I am 
confident that, ? in the Free 
World at least, the age of 
secret treaties is behind us." 
He was wildly optimistic; and 
it is ironic that secret cove-
nants should have enjoyed so 
rich and rank a revival in 
Woodrow Wilson's native land. 
The contents of the so-called 
Hyde Park Aide-Memoire con-
cerning the uses ? of atomic 
energy, signed by Roosevelt 
and Churchill at Hyde Park 
on Sept. 18, 1944, were not 
known in this country until 
published by the State Depart-
ment in 1960. The Symington 
subcommittee in the Senate 
has unearthed a parade of se-
cret agreements withheld from 
Congress and the people ? 
Ethiopia hi 1960, Laos in 1963, 
Thailand in 1964, South Korea 
In 1966, Thailand again in 
1967, not to mention secret 
annexes to the Spanish Bases 
Agreement of 1953. Senator 
Clifford Case has now intro-
duced a bill?or rather revived 
a bill the Senate passed in 
1955?that would require the 
President to transmit all exec-
utive agreements to the for-
eign affairs committees of both 
houses. If the President deems 
an agreement too sensitive for 
publication, he can hand it 
over under the seal of secre-
cy; but he can no longer lock 
it up in his own office and 
tell no one. 
N addition to the control 
of secret agreements, we 
urgently need a rational and 
orderly system for the classi-
fication and declassification 
of official documents and for 
the withholding and release 
of nonclassified documents. 
The Nixon Administration has 
recently shown itself aware 
of the need for reform. In the 
wake of the Pentagon Papers, 
President Nixon asked Con-
gress for .$636,000 to begin 
the declassification of World 
War II papers?a vast moun-
tain of material, 160 million 
'pages in 49,000 cubic feet of 
storage space. This was to 
have launched a declassifica-
tion program that would have 
employed 110 persons for 
five years at a cost now set 
CI n:1459084scoy499frooain616hclintrosniei,-D2avid Kahn, 
continued 
The legislative hesitation 
may well be justified. The Na-
tional Archives estimates that 
at least 95 per cent of the 
classified documents of World 
War II would be declassified 
as a result of this program. 
Thus we would be spending 
at least $6-million (in all like-
lihood the ultimate cost would 
be much greater) to identify 
that 5 per cent of World War 
II documents that must, it is 
supposed, be kept secret for 
a few years longer. 
? "Systematic declassifica-
tion," William L. Langer has 
written, "is patently impos-
sible: The records are so vo-
luminous that it would take 
large teams of highly quali-
fied personnel years to com-
plete the assignment." Profes-
sor Langer is not only the 
leading American historian of 
European diplomacy; he also 
served as chief of the Re-
search and Analysis Branch of 
the Office of Strategic Serv-
ices, in an equivalent post 
in the Central Intelligence 
Agency and as a member of 
the President's Foreign Intel-
ligence Advisory Board. His 
testimony cannot be dismissed 
as that of a naive scholar who 
has spent his life in the stacks 
and doesn't understand the 
realities of public affairs. 
Document-by-document de-
classification will not do. An 
automatic declassification pro-
cedure was nominally insti-
tuted in 1961; but this sys-
tem, however praiseworthy in 
intent, left so many excep-
tions as to become substan-
tially meaningless. What we 
must have is a system which 
after a stated period (of 
which more later) automati-
cally declassifies practically 
everything, including infor-
mation on diplomatic nego-
tiations and military plan-
ning. A longer period?prob-
ably a very much longer 
period?should apply to doc-
uments that describe intelli-
gence operations, compromise 
foreign citizens or invade the 
privacy of American citizens, 
that is, the materials in cate-
gories two, four and five of 
legitimate restriction. (The al-

THE problem is that the se-
crecy- system has been uni-
laterally determined and con-
trolled by a major party at 
linterest?the executive branch 
of the Government. The result 
is that Government has been 
able to move rather easily 
from legitimate to illegitimate 
uses of secrecy. Harold Nicol-
son, we have seen, lost no 
opportunity to emphasize the 
essentiality of secrecy in 
negotiations. But he distin-
guished sharply between ne-
gotiation and policy and 
always added, with equal ern-
.phasis, that policy "should 
never be secret, in the sense 1T. 
that in no circumstances BE.LOKT 
should the citizens of a free ON HSI 
country be committed by their Qi-IAN 
Government to treaties, en- 
gagements, promises or corn-
mitments, of which they have A - 
not had full knowledge," Ask 
which the press has not had 
full opportunity to publish and 
the legislature to .debate and 
approve. "I feel it to be the 
duty of every citizen in a free 
country," Nicolson declared, 
"to proclaim that he will not 
consider himself bound by any 
treaty entered into by the Ad-
ministration behind his back." 
This was President Nixon's 
particular offense in the Indo-
Pakistani affair?keeping his 
policy secret from the Ameri-
can people. But he was far 
froth the first offender. Every 
President since the war has 
done much the same thing at 
one point or another. If gov-
ernments were always wiser 
than citizens, such a course 
might be justified. But the 
theory of democracy is that 
they are not; and the practice 
of recent years generally veri-
fies the theory. Illegitimate 
secrecy has corrupted our 
conduct of foreign affairs and 
deprived I he people of the in-
formation necessary .for the 
democratic control of foreign 
policy. So long as the execu-
tive branch persists in these 
abuses and so long as Con-
gress remains unwilling to as-
sert itself, the courage of the 
Andersons,-Sheehans and Ells-

New Light on the Cuban Missile Crisis 01 19 
By Chalmers M. Roberts 
TIIE CUBAN missile crisis of 1962 never 
ceases to intrigue those who lived through it 
or had anything to do with it. And so two 
e On Occ. 18 Radvanyi attended the first 
edge are well worth reporting. One is a 
new works that add to the general knowl-
of three meetings with Soviet Ambassador 
unique look at the crisis by a Communist  
Anatolyi F. Dobrynin and the heads of all 
diplomat then in Washington. The other is the Communist embassies in Washington. 
an analytical study by an associate professor Dobrvnin discussed the meeting the previous 
at the Kennedy School of Government at day between President Kennedy and Soviet 
Harvard. Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. After 
Janos Radvanyi was the Hungarian charg?inner at the Czech embassy Dobrynin "as-
in Washington at the time (there was no am- sured his audience that recent reports of So-
bassador), an affable fellow with whom I had viet ground-to-ground missiles in Cuba were 
much contact. On May 17, 1967, he defected, completely without foundation." As to the 
turning up later at Stanford where he wrote Kennedy-Gromyko meeting, "nothing ex-
"Hungary and the Super Powers" to be pub- traordinary had happened"; the German sit-
lished in May by the Hoover institution. The nation had been discussed at length along

was overreacting to reports of Soviet activity 
in Cuba. He did so in part because Soviet dip-
lomats here had told him the uproar was 
part of the American pre-election campaign. 
But one day he received a copy of a cable to 
Budapest from Hungarian Ambassador 
Janos Beck in Havana. Beck "made it a 
point to discount information he had re-
ceived from the Chinese embassy in Havana 
as being provocatively anti-Soviet," Radvanyi 
writes. But "the Chinese ambassador had ap-
parently told him that according to informa-
tion he had received from private sources 
the Soviet Union was delivering surface-to-
surface ballistic missiles to Cuba and that 
Soviet military advisers had come to Cuba 
not as instructors but as members of Soviet 
special rocket' force units to operate these 
missiles." 
Radvanyi goes on: "Ambassador Beck re-
marked that his Chinese friends had com-
plained of Soviet unwillingness to disclose 
any details and had asked Beck whether he 
knew anything more about the whole affair. 
Beck argued that the story of the deploy-
ment of ground-to-ground missiles had been 
launched by 'American warmongers' and ob-
served that neither the Soviet ambassador 
in Havana nor high-ranking Cuban officials 
had mentioned anything to him about the 
missile build-up." 
This message apparently was sent in late 
July or early August. Soviet arms shipments 
were arriving at that time, though the first 
medium range missiles did not come until 
Sept. 6. On Aug. 22 CIA Director John Mc-
Cone voiced to President Kennedy his suspi-
cions that the Soviets were preparing to in-
troduce offensive missiles, perhaps on the 
basis of Information gathered in Cuba that 
month by French intelligence agent Philippe 
De liesjoll. However, on Sept. 19 the United 
States Intelligence Board's estimate was 
that the Soviets would n t introduce offen-

article a trial balloon, launched by the U.S. 
administration to seek out a suitable solu-
tion. Dobrynin sought their (Commu-
nist diplomats') opinion as to whether they 
thought the Lippmann article should be re-
garded as an indirect suggestion on the part 
of the White House." Only the Romanian 
ambassador indicated he had some reason to 
think that it was just that; Lippmann, as far 
as I know, has never said whether the idea 
was simply his own. According to RFK's ac-
count, Adlai Stevenson on the 20th had sug-

war. 
"Within two hours I received a troubled 
Inquiry from Budapest asking whether I 
could possibly be aware of the implications 
of my words. I insisted that I would take 
full responsibility for every word in my re-
port." 
On the 27th Soviet Premier Khrushchey 
offered to swap missiles in Cuba for missiles 
in Turkey but the next day he accepted the 
Kennedy demand for outright removal of both 
missiles and planes from Cuba. 
Fidel Castro was outraged and Moscow 
sent Anastas Mikoyan to Cuba to reason 
with him. After three weeks there Mikoyan 
stopped in Washington en route home and 
Dobrynin invited the Communist diplomats to 
dinner with him on Nov. 30. Mikoyan ex-
plained how he had tried to win Castro's ap-
proval to the United Nations inspection of 
the missile dismantling process in Cuba, one 
of the President's terms to which Khru-
shchev had agreed, but which Castro rejected. 
According to Mikoyan's account, he was the 
one who "proposed to Moscow instead that 
the Americans observe the evacuation of the 
missiles from the air and, if necessary, 
might inspect Soviet ships on the high seas." 
They were inspected from the air, the tarpu-
Iins covering them pulled back by the Soviet 
Alors on ships taking them home. 
"After dinner," recounts Radvanyi, "Mi-
koyan continued his briefing by explaining 
that the Cuban situation had been compli-
cated by the continual advice which Castro 
had received from the Chinese. Peking, ac-
cording to Mikoyan, had sent tons of propa-
ganda material, and Mao Tse-tung had 
transmitted to Havana one message after 
another assuring the Cubans that the eight 
hundred million Chinese stood firmly be 
hind them and that the Americans were 
paper tigers. Mikoyan reported that while 
the Chinese had done nothing to help de-
fend Castro, they had refrained from shell-
ing Quemoy and Matsu during the days of 
the crisis. Mikoyan noted ironically that 
they might easily have stepped up pressure 
against Taiwan which?with the Americans 
involved in the Caribbean?could have 
changed the whole situation ? . " 
In defense against the Peking charges, 
hurled by now at Moscow, of "adventurism" 
in deploying the missiles and "capitula-
tionism" for taking them out, "Mikoyan of-
fered two explanations for the Soviet action. 
The missile deployment in the Caribbean, he 
said, was aimed at defending Castro on the 
one hand and, on the other, at achieving a 
definite shift in the power relationship be-
tween the socialist and the capitalist worlds. 
After evaluating the strong American reac-
tion during the crisis, however, the Presid-
ium had decided against risking the security 
of the Soviet Union and its allies for the 
sake of Cuba." 
This account squares With Khrushchev's 
in, "Khrushchev Remembers." There the So-
viet leader contended that while the "main 
thing" was to defend Cuba, "in addition" 
"our missiles would have equalized what the 
West likes to call the 'balance of power.' " 
6-4,4 
IN THE second book, "Essence of Decision" 
by Graham T. Allison, published. by Little-
Brown, a 
thor accepts as "the most satisfactory ex-
planation" of the Soviet move the effort to 
end the Soviet "missile gap" then existing. 
The missiles in Cuba "amounted to a dou-
bling of Soviet first-strike capabilities." 
Two other points made by Allison struck 
me. He concludes that the American warnings 
against 'installation of the missiles may not 
have seemed all that strong to Moscow and 
hence the Soviets went on. Ile notes that on 
Oct. 14 McGeorge Bundy, Mr Kennedy's as-
sistant for national security, said publicly 
that he knew there was "no present evi-
dence, and I think there is. no present likeli-
hood" of "a major offensive capability" be-
ing installed in Cuba. Yet on Sept. 28 the 
United States had taken pictures that Bundy 
knew about of crates on the decks of. Soviet 
ships in route to Cuba crates similar to 
those used to send IL-28 light bombers to 
Egypt and Indonesia. So Allison says that 
"the conclusion that the administration had 
discovered a way to tolerate one type of 
offensive weapon in Cuba is unavoidable." 
Second, Allison concludes from Robert 
Kennedy's account, published hi'. 1069, that 
what he told Dobrynin just before Kruslichev 
agreed to pull out the missiles amounted to 
offering a private deal: to oo secretly what 
the President refused to do publicly, pull 
American missiles out of Turkey in exchange 
for Soviet missiles out of Cuba. In, REK's 
account he said he told Dobrynin- that "there 
could be no quid pro quo or any arrangement 
made under this kind of threat or pressure" 
but that he also told Dobrynin that "President 
Kennedy had been anxious to remove those 
missiles from Turkey and Italy for a long per-
iod of time. He had ordered their removal 
some time ago, and it was our judgment 
that, within a short time after the crisis was 
over, those missiles would be gone." After 
the crisis abated they were withdrawn.

B-6 THE EVENING STAR 
Washington, D. C., Friday, January 7, 1972 
Disclosures Reported Pleasing Keating 
By SYDNEY H. SCHANBERG 
New York Times Neys Service 
NEW DELHI ? Sources 
else to Ambassador Kenneth 
B. Keating indicate that he 
was not unhappy about the dis-
closure of his secret cable-
gram to Washington taking is-
sue with American policy on 
the Indian-Pakistani war. 
Asked yesterday to com-
ment on his policy views and 
on last month's cablegram, 
which was divulged in Wash-
ington by columnist Jack An-
derson, Keating would say 
only: "This is a matter I can-
not discuss." 
It is known in New Delhi, 
however, that from the time 
Pakistani troops in East Paki-
stan moved to crush the Ben-
gali secession movement there 
last March, Keating cam-
paigned privately against the 
Nixon administration's pro-
Pakistani stand. He even did 
so publicly until he was si-
lenced by Washington in April. 
Posture Correct 
In recent months, Keating's 
official posture has been rigid-
ly correct. He has refused to 
discuss his views with report-
ers, even in private. hi his 
regular columns in a U.S. In-
formation Service fortnightly 
newspaper that is widely dis-
tributed in India, he has con-
sistently defended the admin-
istration policy. He has been 
criticized for doing so in the 
Indian press and elsewhere. 
From the beginning of the 
India - Pakistan crisis, which 
culminated in India's victo-
rious support of the East Paki-
stan separatists, the American 
ambassador's cables to Wash-
ington ,have argued strongly 
for a different American poli-
cy. He pressed for a policy 
that would be based on what 
he views as the moral and 
political "realities" on the 
subcontinent. 
Only a few days after the 
Pakistani crackdown in East 
Pakistan began, he sent a ca-
ble containing more than a 
hint of outrage. In it he re-
ferred to the killings of Ben-
galis as "selective genocide" 
and urged Washington to come 
down hard on the Pakistani 
military regime. The word 
"massacre" was also used. 
Reportedly Rebuked 
After an April 15 news con-
ference in Bombay at which 
he differed with the adminis-
tration's contention that the 
events in East Pakistan were 
an "internal affair," he was 
reported to have been rebuked 
by Washington and told to con-
fine his public remarks to sup-
port the administration posi-
tion. 
"The phrase 'internal affair' 
should not be overdone," he 
said at the news conference. 
He added that the meaning of 
the phrase was "limited to the 
geographical fact that all of 
this is taking place in what is 
now Pakistan. 
The Pakistan government is 
understood to have filed a pro-
test with Washington about his 
remarks. 
Keating continued to press 
his argument in his cable-
Approved For R 
A? - - _ _ 1 
grams to Washington. His 
view all along, according to 
confidants, was that Pakistan 
was an unstable, crumbling 
military dictatorship; that In-
dia was not only an increas-
ingly stable democracy but 
also the dominant power on 
the subcontinent; and that 
East Pakistan seemed certain 
to emerge as an independent 
state. The Bengali separatists 
have proclaimed the establish-
ment of Bangladesh. 
The ambassador argued that 
the morality of the situation, a 
reference to "genocide," as 
well as the political realities 
should lead the United States 
to lean toward India rather 
than Pakistan. 
By his determined dissent, 
Keating, a former Republican 
senator from New York who is 
a political appointee of Presi-
dent Nixon and a former law 
partner of Secretary of State 
William P. Rogers, may have 
caused these two men consid-
erable anguish and irritation 
over the last 10 months, but 
his arguments have had little 
Obvious effect. 
There have been periodic 
press reports that Keating has 
threatened to resign.

AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER 
MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1971 PAGE A.22 
The White House Brief on South Asia 
The White House, with an assist from Senator 
Goldwater, has now revealed publicly what the 
United States did privately over the last eight 
months to ease the South Asia crisis. A "back. 
ground" news conference with Dr. Henry Kissinger 
on Tuesday, which the senator was good enough 
to put into the Congressional Record on Thursday, 
establishes that in fact Amoebas officials did work 
to induce political compromise in Pakistan and mili-
tary restraint in India. The record is at once so 
important and judgmental that it needs to be in-
spected in detail 
That Rs duress, Including pressure from Wash-
ington, was affecting Pakistan is plain. As the 
White House noted, Islamabad replaced the cruel 
military governor in the East, allowed relief there 
to be internationalized, offered formal amnesty to 
refugees who might choose to return, and had 
agreed to restore a facade of civilian rule this 
month. President Yahya Khan had agreed to talk 
to Calcutta representatives of Bangle Deck (the 
Bengali nation proclaimed hi former East Paki-
stan/ though not to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman or 
his nominees?"Mujib," the acknowledged and 
elected Bengali leader, is the Pakistanit' prisoner 
trial tar Giessen. Islamabad was reportedly ready 
to grant the East autonomy in everything but for-
. eign policy, defense and currency. Further Paki-
stani concessions were expected in the week of 
Nov. 22. 
The Indians, according to the White House, knew 
all this. They also knew Islansabad had offered to 
let Americans communicate with Mujib through 
his lawyer. On Nov. 19 they were told the U.S. was 
prepared to discuss with Islamabad a timetable for 
establishing autonomy in East Bengal But with. 
out waiting, without giving word of Its own mili-
tary timetable, India struck on Nov. 22. The White 
House conclusion: peaceful mans had not been 
exhausted; recourse to arms was accordingly 
unjustified. 
The question, of course, Is whether Delhi moved 
because It was sure American diplomacy would 
fall to produce a Bangle Desh state independent 
of Pakistan, India's goal; or whether Delhi moved 
nut of fear that the Americans would succeed and 
thus deprive it of a long-sought chance to bash 
the Poke. 
The answer, we submit, must take into account 
the constantly reiterated Indian position that ne-
gotiations had to begin with Mujib. Whether India 
figured realistically that otherwise negotiations 
would be meaningless, or whether It calculated 
cynically that President Yahya could not stomach 
that course, does not alter the uncontested fact 
that the Americans knew from the start this was 
the Delhi position. By Nov. 19, or by Nov. 22, Pres-
ident Yahya had talked with no Bengalis. He had 
ruled out Mujib and Mujib's choices. Ile had Said 
the autonomy he would grant would not cover 
foreign affairs, defense and currency?dominant 
heights of any country's public life. Eight months 
had passed. Refuge. were continuing to pour in. 
Press reports of India's grooving impatience were 
rampant. And presumably Washington was not 
altogether dependent on India's formal statements 
to learn the status of its preparations for open war. 
Knowing now what the administration kept secret 
before, we are not an inclined to criticize the ad. 
ministration for its attitude as for Its judgment. 
Through eight months of gathering misery and 
tension it stuck in a public posture of support for 
Pakistan on the ostensible grounds that it could 
apply more effective leverage. At the end, it had 
only persuaded Pakistan to promise talks?not yet 
In begin them?for a limited purpose with Bengalis 
whom the Wiens regarded as stooges. And on this 
basis it expected India to hold still. 
The Indians have Non rough anti irceilicruiliim 
they have encouraged and directly taken part in 
the dismemberment of a sovereign state. But could 
the war have been avoided It, early on, Washington 
Dad openly and entirely withdrawn support from 
Pakistan and demanded that it honor the free elec-
tions which Mujib was and Yahya nullified in 
March? Was not the appearance of American favor 
crucial in allowing Yahya to sustain his misrule to 
the point where the Indians jumped him? 
We note that, contrary to some accounts. evidencs 
Is lacking that the White House and State Depart. 
went have different views on the crisis. The Depart. 
ment on Dec. 4 had cited India as the aggressor. 
But the White House did not really shy away from 
this indictment as sharply as some reports made it 
seem; rather, it reinforced the indictment by offer-
ing a diplomatic record intended to show what 
peaceful possibilities the Indians had preempted. In 
noting that the first charge of aggression came 
from State, the White House?the briefing tran-
script makes clear?was trying to rebut other 
charges that American favor for Pakistan had 
flown from the personal preferences of the Presi. 
dent. In short, there are other places?and aspects 
other than Internecine conflict between the White 
House and State?at which to look for the flaws 
and failure of American policy. 
Around 
Teachers College at 120 
With a fascinating past and great promise for 
Ike future, the District of Columbia Teachers Col-
lege has had much to celebrate on the occasion of 
(is 120th anniversary this month. To begin with, 
ec this chm'ished community institution 
go back to the roots of racial segregation in the na-
tion's capital, when the education of Negroes was 
anything but a priority item. 
It was in this setting that Myrtilla Miner, awhile 
woman from Madison County, N.Y., dedded to 
opens school at 11th Street and New York Avenue 
NW, to -prepare "colored girls to teach." By the 
1870s, it had become the Miner Normal School, 
which, along with the Wilson Normal School, had 
developed from one-year institutions into schools 
offering three-year .eourses. 
Racially separated normal schools continued 
here uMil 1929, when Congress authorized the es. 
tablishment of two teachers colleges? still segre-
gated. It wasn't until 1955 that the two colleges 
merged into the Integrated D.C. Teachers College. 
Today, the college has an enrollment of more 
than 4,500 students and, under the presidency of 
Dr. Paul P. Cooke, is exploring new roles In the 
life of the community, as well as in the field of 
public higher education here. One current com-
munity activity, for example, is the Adult Courtesy 
Patrol, an organization of men and women who 
patrol 14th Street NW to provide better security 
for citizens; there is also a children and youth 
community recreation program, under which the 
college is providing its basketball courts, playroom 
and gym for neighborhood activities; there Is a 
pilot District police project, to work on police-con, 
malty relations between some 900 police officers 
and the neighborhood they serve, as well as dozens 
of other student and faculty projects. 
Above all, D.C. Teachers is on Its way to becom-
ing a general community college, with hopes of 
some day functioning as a vital part of a Federal 
City University concept. This plan envisions a net-
work of breach colleges for junior college educe-
tine, to supplement and feed the city's four-year 
liberal arts omits:on aad the Washington Technical 
Institute. 
The college, which has been accredited for the 
next 10 years by the Middle States Association of 
College and Secondary Schools, has been a keystone 
of public higher etlacation here, and merits re-
newed cong,resslonal and community support as It 
moves toward a greater role in the years ahead. 
Fare Smudging 
Man Is born to trouble; hut Attorney Philip 
Hirschkop who has rendered much service to civil 
liberty and public order in this community, seems 
Os have had more than his fair share of it. Trouble 
began for him when he was appointed to defend

log the Dow Chemical Co. Washington office in 
what they conceived of as a protest against the use 
of napalm in the Vietnam war. The trial before 
Federal District Court Judge John Pratt was a 
tumultuous one in which the judge and Mr. Hirsch-
hop collided constantly. At its conclusion Judge 
) Pratt summarily found the defense attorney guilty 
of Contempt; and on top of that filed charges 
against him before the court's committee on admis-
sions and grievanceS. 
The contempt conviction is still pending before 
the Court of Appeals. The Ethics Committee of the 
local bar association found no occasion for dis-
clplinary action against Mr. Hir.hkop. But the 
court's committee on admissions and grievances 
recommended his disbarment. About six weeks ago

5.1r. Hirschkop hailed the news of this finding 
by saying that he did not believe the panel would 
have censured him at all except as "a face.saving 
device for Pratt." Whereupon, the members of the 
panel filed new charg. against Mr. Ilirschkop with 
Ike grievance committee, accusing him of "know. 
ingly making false accusations." Since when is a 
defendant foreclosed from commenting on a ver-
dict? Otis an absurdity to characterize this offhand 
remark made to a reporter as "false accusation" 
against a court. The action does nothing to save 
face for Judge Pratt, It serves only to smudge the 
face of the District Court.

We are enchanted by the new abstract sculptures 
that flank Rock Creek Parkway and frame the Lb. 
coin Memorial as you approach Memorial Bridge. 
For all the monuments and statuary in this city, 
there isn't much modern art In public places. The

Connecticut Avenue and the Alexander Calder, Jose

the Lincoln Memorial, at any rate, seem truly in-

translucent, they also blend quietly into the en.

Kissinffer's tackgroundei on the War in South Asia 
FInsT OF All, lot no get a number of 
things straight. There have been some com-
ments that the administration is antdIndian. 
Thin is totally inaccurate. India is a great 
country. It is the most populous free coon 
try. It is governed by democratic prom-
dues. 
Americans through all administrations in 
the postwar period have felt a commitinent 
In the progress and development of India, 
and the American people have contributed 
to this to the extent of $10 billion. Last year, 
in this administration, India received from 
all sources $1.2 billion for development as. 
sistance, economic assistance, of which $700 
million came from the IfMted States in var. 
Ions forms. Therefore, we have a commit-
nient to the progress and to the future of 
India, and we have always recognized that 
the success of India, and the Indian demo-
cratic experiment, would be of profound 
significanee to many of the countries in the 
undertleveloped world. 
Therefore, oh en we have differed with 
India, as we have in recent weeks, we do 
NO with great sadness and with crest dig. 
appointment. 
Now let me describe the situation as we 
saw it going hark to March 25, Mardi 25 
is, of course, the day when the central gov-
ernment of Pakistan decided to establish 
military rule in East Bengal and started the 
process which has led to the present situa-
tion. 
The United Stales has never supported 
HE RI' ISSINGER 
the particular action that led to this tragic 
series of events, and the United States has 
always recognized that this action had con-
sequences which had a considerable impact 
on India. We have always recognized that 
the influx of refugees into India produced 
the danger of communal strife in a country 
always precariously Poised on the edge of 
communal strife. We have known that it is a 
strain on the already scarce economic re-
sources of 0 country in the process of de-
vetopment. 
Therefore, from the beginning, the United 
States has played a very active role in at-
tempting to ease the suffering of the refu-
gees and the impact on India of this large 
Intim of unexpected people. The United 
States position has been to attempt two ef-
forts simultaneously: One, to ease the 
human suffering and to bring about the re. 
turn of the refugees; and secondly, we have 
attempted to bring about a political resolu. 
tion of the conflict which generated the ref-
ugees in the first place. 
Now, the United States did not condone 
what happened in March 1971; on the con. 
trary, the United States has made no new 
development loans to Pakistan since March, 
1971. 
Secondly, there has been a great deal of) 
talk about military supplies to Pakistan. The 
fact of the matter is that Immediately after 
the actions M East Pakistan at the end of 
larch of this past year, the United States 
mtspended any new licenses. It stopped the 
shipment of al1 military supplies out of 
ARICH.CAO depots or that were under Amen. 
'no governmental centred. The only arms 
that were continued to be shipped to Paki. 
stan were arms on oLd licenses in commer. 
Oat channels, and those were spare parts. 
There were no lethal enditems involved. 
To give you a sense of magnitude. the 
hinted Slates cut off $35 million worth of 
arms at the end of March of this year, or 
eat.V. April of this year, immediatrty after 
the actions in East Bengal, and continued to 
ship something less than $5 million worth; 
whereupon, all the remainder of the pipe-
line was Out off. 
ereeR 
Ir is true the United States did not make 
any pudic declarations on its views of the 
evolution, because the United States wanted 
to use its influence with both Delhi and Isla. 
mailed to bring about a political settlement 
that would enable the refugees to return. At 
Ohs request of the President, this was ex. 
plained by me to the Indian Foreign Minis-
ter and to the Indian Prime Minister when I 
was in New Delhi In early July, and both In-
dicated that they understood our-decision in 
this respect and made no criticism stone de. 
cision. 
They did make a criticism of the arms 
shipments. Secondly, we consistently used 
our influence that we gained in this manner 
to urge the Government of Pakistan in the 
direction of a political evolution. We urged 
the Government of Pakistan and they 
agreed that relief supplies be distributed by 
Intemational agencies, in order to take away 
the critidam In East Pakistan that they 
might be used to strengthen the central au-
thority, and the government agreed that a

everybody but the reader wins: the newsmen get a story and 
government officials can speak candidly, or self-servingly, 
without taking official responsibility for what they say. 
Last week, however, the reader won one when Senator 
Goldwater put into the Congressional Record the transcript 
of a White House "backgrounder" with the press and 
thereby gave away the identity of the source: Dr. Henry 
Kissinger. The result, excerpts of which are printed here, 
,offers a revealing glimpse of what the White House thinks 
?or wants everybody to believe it thinks?about the origins 
and causes of the India?Pakistan war. 
timetable be established for returning Pain 
stan to civilian rule. That was supposed to 
be done by the and of December. 
We urged a mutual withdrawal of troops 
from the border, and when India rejected 
this, we urged a unilateral withdrawal of 
.Pakistan troops from the border, and that 
wasi accepted by Pakistan and never replied 
On by India. 
We urged an amnesty for all refugees, and 
that wan accepted. 
We went further. We established contact 
with the Bangle Desk people in Calcutta. 
and during August, September and October 
of this year no fewer than eight such con' 
lane took place. 
We approached President Yahya Khan 
three times In order to begin negotiations 
with the Bangle Desh people in Calcutta. 
The Government of Pakistan neeeated 
were tald by our contacts in Calcutta that 
the Indian Government discouraged such net-
gotiations. In other words, we attempted to 
promote a political settlement, and if I can 
sum up the difference that may have existed 
between as and the Government of India, it 
was this: 
We told the Government of India on many 
occasions?the Secretary of State saw the 
Indian Ambassador 18 times; I saw him 
seven times since the end of August on be. 
half of the President We all said that po-
litical autonomy for East Bengal was the 
inevitable outcome of a political evolution, 
and that we favored it. The differences may 
have been that the Government of India 
wanted things so rapidly that it was no 
longer talking about, political evolution, but 
about political collapse. 
Without attempting to speculate on the 
motives of the Indian Government, the fact 
of the matter, as they presented themselves 
to us, was as follows: We told the Indian 
Prime Minister when aloe was here of the 
Pakistan offer to withdraw their troops uni? 
laterally from the border. There was no 
response. 
We told the Indian Prime Minister when 
she was here that we would try to arrange 
negotiations between the Pakistanis and 
members of the Amami League, spedfically 
approved by Mujibur, who is in prison. We 
Sold the Indian Ambassador shortly before 
his return to Indian that we were prepared 
even to discuss with them a political time
a precise timetable for the establish. 
ment of political autonomy in East Bengal. 
The conversation was held on November 
lath. On November 22nd, military action 
started in East Bengal. 
We told the Pakistan Foreign Secretary 
when he was here that it was desirable on 
November 15th; that we thought It was time 
for Pakistan to develop a maximum pro-
gram. lie said he could not give us an an-
ewer until the week of .November 22nd when 
he would return to his country. He also 
pointed out to us that there would be a re-
turn to civilian rule at the end of December, 
at which time it might be easier to bring 
about such matters as the release of Mull. 
bur, whose imprisonment had occurred 
under military rule. 
This information Was transmitted, and 
military action, nevertheless, started during 
the week of November 22nd. On when we say 
Ileal there was no need for military action, 
we do not say that India did not suffer. We 
do not say that we are unsympathetic to In-
dia's problems or that we do not 0510,0 India. 
This country, which in many respects has 
had a love affair with India, can only, with 
enormous pain, accept the fact that military 
action was taken in our view without ade-
quate muse, and if we express this opinion 
In the United Nations, we do not do so be. 
Douse we want to aupport one particular

tries in the world; but because we believe 
that if, as some of the phrases go, the right 
of military attack is determined by arith. 
metie, if political wisdom consists of saying 
the attacker has 500 million and the de. 
Sender has 100 million, and, therefore, the 
United States must always be on the side of 
Ohm numerically stronger, then we are crest-
ing a situation where, in the foresecalote fu-
ture, we will have international amrchy, 
and where the period of peace, which is the 
greatest desire for the President to estab-
lish, will be jeopardized; not at first for 
Americans, necessarily, but for peoples all 
over the world. 
The unilateral withdrawal, that was with-
out any qualifications. The willingness to 
talk to the Bangle Desh people involved a 
disagreement between the Indians and the 
Bangle Desh on the one side, and the Pakis-
tanis on the other. The Indians took the 
view that the negotiations had to begin with 
Mujibur, who was in prison. 
What we attempted to promote was a as. 
collation with Banda Dego people who were 
000 10 prison, and who were in Calcutta. The 
Pakistanis Said they would talk only to these 
Bangle Dash people who were not charged 
with any particular crime in Pakistan, and I 
don't know whom that would have excluded. 
There is no personal preference on my 
part for Pakistan, and the IRDWN that I. ex.

Indians Say China May Aid 
Evacuailar8rNartalgas 
DELHI, From Al 
Indian alarm at this new 
development was reflected 
today in new rounds of 
urgent talks between top 
officials in both New Delhi 
and Moscow. 
According to the Infor-
mation gathered by Indian 
Intelligence sources, the 
Chinese-Pakistan plan is for 
the boats, believed to he a 
motley assembly of met, 
chant ships, barges and 
other craft, to sail out un. 
der the Chinese flag when 
they are fully loaded with 
escaping soldiers. 
The Indian eastern naval 
rommand, which is in the 
Ray of Bengal not for off 
lite coast, has given a warn-
ing that all ships in the 
area will be subject to in-
MI-option. India hag also 
warned repeatedly that 
boats attempting to take es-
taping troops back to West 
Pakistan will be attacked 
and sunk. 
Indian nava( and aW units 
have already attacked sev-
',rat small. Galt taking rot 
dier out of East Pakistan 
toward Burma. They were 
spotted hugging the coast In 
a bid to escape. 
India's chief spokesman 
tonight would not disclose 
any details of discussions 
believed already to have 
taken place with the Ran-
goon government about any 
Pakistan soldiers who man-
age to make their way to 
Burma, 
If the Indians carry out 
their threat and attack me 
lensibly Chinese vessels, 
this would clearly raise the 
risk that China would re-
gard India as having made 
a direct attack on her. 
The Indian concern has 
been made apparent by 
the frequent radio messages 
teemed to Pakistan soldieta 
in East Pakistan by Gen. 
Sam Manekshaw, Indian 
commander-in.chlef, urging 
them to surrender. These

CIA Policy Shifts Urged 
B,y Cooper, McGovern 
By JAMES DOYLE 
Star Staff Writer 
Republican Sen. John Sher-
man Cooper of Kentucky, senior 
member of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, submitted leg-
islation today which would make 
available to Congress all the 
intelligence information and 
analyses developed by the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency and 
similar government agencies. 
Cooper proposed an amend-
ment to the National Security 
Act of 1947 which would require 
that the CIA make its intelli-
gence discoveries and conclu-
sions available to the commit-
tees on Armed Services 9 od For-
eign Relations In both branches. 
He said that as the law now 
says the information is only 
a vaila ble to the executive 
branch. 
In a related move, Sen. 
George McGovern, D-S.D., pro-
posed that the CIA expenditures 
each year be listed as an over-
all total in the national budget. 
McGovern's Amendment also 
would prohibit use of CIA funds 
by other departments and agen-
cies. 
The South Dakota Senator said 
he recognized that security limi-
tations would prevent a full dis-
closure of all CIA funding, but 
said a single line item in the 
budget would "put the Congress 
in a position to judge if we want-
ed to spend more on intelligence 
operations and clandestine wars 
than on improvement of the en-
vironment ,or on education or 
even on other aspects of national 
defense." 
Cooper said his bill "would 
not, in any way, affect the activ-
ities of the CIA, its sources or 
methods." 
But he said it would put Con-
gress "in a much better position 
to make judgments, much more 
informed and broader perspec-
tive than is now possible." 
CIA expenditures are overseen 
by a select subcommittee of the 
Armed Services Committee. All 
of its deliberations and decisions 
are kept secret. 
Funds for the CIA are Oen 
hidden away in other money 
bills. 
Cooper said his bill would not 
affect the method of congres-
sional oversight.

Secret U.S. Papers Barcd 
By Sanford J. Ungar 
Washington Post Stait writer 
Syndicated columnist Jack Anderson, in a 
major challenge to the secrecy surrounding 
U.S. policy in the Indo-Pakistani war, last night 
gave The Washington Post the full texts of 
three secret documents describing meetings 
Of the National Security Council's Washington 
Special Action Group (WSAG). 
The documents indicate that Henry A. Kis-
singer, President Nixon's national security ad-
viser, instructed government agencies to take 
a hard line with India in public statements and 
private actions during last month's war on the 
Indian subcontinent, 
Anderson released the documents after Kis-
singer told reporters Monday during an air-
borne conversation en route to the Western 
White House in San Clemente that the col-
umnist, in stories based on the materials, had 
taken "out of context"AtnyrimideittaFortRt 
the administration was kgtinst 
Among the significant statements bearing 
on U.S. policy 
following: 
? "KISSINGER: I am getting hell every half 
hour from the President that we are not being 
,tough enough on India. He has just called me 
again. He does not believe we are carrying out 
his wishes. He wants to tilt in favor of Pakis-
tan. He feels everything we do cornea out 
otherwise." 
? "Dr. Kissinger said that whoever was put-
ting out background information relative to the 
current situation is provoking presidential 
wrath. The President is under the 'illusion' 
that he is giving instructions; not that he is 
merely being kept apprised of affairs as they 
progress. Dr. Kissinger asked that this be kept 
in mind." 
? "Dr. Kissinger also directed that hence-
forth we show a certain coolness to the In-
dians; the Indian Ambassador is not to be 
in the documents were the. Arabia to transfer military equipment to Pak-
istan. Mr. (Christopher) Van Hollen (deputy 
assistant secretary of state for South Asian 
affairs) stated the United States cannot permit 
a third country to transfer arms which we 
have provided them when we, ourselves, do 
not authorize sale direct to the ultimate re-
cipient, such as Pakistan." 
? "Mr. (Joseph) Sisco (assistant secretary of 
state for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs) 
suggested that what we are really interested in 
are what supplies and equipment could .be 
made available, and the modes of delivery of 
this equipment. He stated from a political 
point of view our efforts would have to be 
directed at keeping the Indians from 'extin-
guishing' West Pakistan." 
? "Mr. Sisco went on to say that as the 
Paks increasingly feel the heat we will be 
getting emergency requests from them . . . 
Dr. Kissinger said that the President may

want to honor those requests 
The matter has not been 
brought to Presidential atten-
tion but it is quite obvious that 
the President is not inclined to 
let the Paks be defeated." 
After getting the documents 
from Anderson, The Post de-
cided to print the full texts in 
today's editions. 
Anderson said he would 
make the documents 
able to other members of the 
press today, and he invited 
Sen. J. W. Fulbright, chair-
man of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, ?to use 
them as the basis for an in-
vestigation of U.S policy in 
South Asia, 
Fulbright, out of Washing-
ton during the congressional 
recess, could not be reached 
for comment. 
The columnist also suggested 
that other members of Con-
gress might wish to investi-
gate government security clas-
sification policy. 
Most of the significant state-
ments in the three documents 
released last night had al-
ready appeared in Anderson's 
column, which is distributed to 
700 newspapers, including The 
Washington Post. 
The Justice Department ac-
knowledged yesterday that the 
FBI is investigating the nature 
of the security leak that led 
to the disclosures. 
But Anderson, who said he 
will write several more col-
umns based on the documents, 
pointed out that no govern-
ment agent had visited him 
and that he had received no 
request to halt publication. 
The Post has not received any 
such request either. 
Pentagon Sources said an-
other investigatiOn is under-
way by military security 
agents. They said the scope of 
their investigation would be 
narrow because "very few peo-
ple" have access to minutes of 
the meetings. 
Anderson, in an interview 
with The Post, said he also 
had copies of cables to Wash-
ington from the U.S. ambassa-
dors to India and Pakistan, as 
well as numerous other docu-
ments bearing on American 
policy. 
He showed this reporter a 
briefcase with about 20 file ' 
folders, each containing some 
of the documents. 
Anderson declined to name 
his sources, but suggested that 
they occupy high positions in ' 
the Nixon administration. 
"TC the sources were identi-
fied," he said "it wAtninyn 
hart-ass the admiliaTEtroli 
more than it would me. It 
HENRY A. KISSINGER, 
... coolness to India 
would make a very funny 
story." 
Since the controversy last 
year over release of the Penta-
gon Papers, a top-secret his-
tory Of U.S. policy in Vietnam, 
Anderson said, his sources had 
become more, rather than less, 
willing to disclose classified 
material. 
The texts obtained by The 
Post provide 'substantial de-
tails of the back-and-forth 
at Special Action Group meet-
ings among representatives 
of the White House, State 
and Defense departments, Con-
ti-al intelligence Agency, Na-
tional Security Coulicil, Joint 
Chiefs of Staff and the Agency 
for International Development. 
The three texts are: 
? A "memorandum for FCC-
Ord" about a WSAG meeting in 
the Situation Room of the 
White House on Dec. 3, by 
James H. Noes,  deputy as-
sistant secretary' of defense tot-
Near Eastern. African and ' 
South Asian affairs. lt Was ap-, 
Proved by G. Warren Nutter, as-
sistant Secretary of defense for

and was printed on his station-
cry. 
? A memorandum for the

stationery, concerning a Meet-
ing an Dee. 4, by Navy Capt. 
Howard N. Kay, a JCS staffer. 
? Another memorandum by 
Kay on JCS stationery about 
a meeting on Dec. 0. 
The first of the three meet-
ings was held on the opening 
day of full-scale hostilities be-
tween India and Pakistan. 
That was he day Pakistani 
aircraft launched a series of 
strikes against Indian air-
fields on the western border. 
Indian Prime Minister Indira

JACK ANDERSON 
... releases documents 
By the time of the second 
meeting, the war had spread 
through East and ? West Paki-
stan; by the third meeting, 
Mrs. Gandhi had announced 
India's recognition of Bangla-
desh, formerly East Pakistan, 
as a sovereign country. 
The Post obtained type-
written copies of photocopies 
of the documents in Ander-
son's possession. 
Acopies,nderson's  which 
were inspected by a represent-
ative of The Post, showed that 
the original documents were, 
stamped "SECRET SENSIT-! 
IVE" at the top and bottom! 
of each page. 
Anderson said he hoped his-
columns on the Indo-Pakistani! 
situation, and now the release! 
of the documents, would pro-
voke a "showdown" on the 
government classification sys-
tem. 
lie said he had been 
"timid" originally about quot-
ing from the documents, but, 
later quoted more extensi',7ely 
when he became convincea of 
the "colossal blunders" of U.S. 
policy. 
Invoking his own view of . 
what might harm national sec-
urity, he said he would not; 
release the exact texts of;; 
cables, "just in case they 
would be useful to crypto-
graphers." 
Anderson said the doe- , 
uments should not have been I 
classified in the first place. 
He said they showed that 
"Kissinger is surrounded, by 
secrecy. tie is treated I Ike a 
new weapons system." 
T h e Anderson documents 
differ from the Pentagon Pa-
pers in that his disclosures 
cover current diplomatic ac-
tivities, rather than history. 
/03i060t C1AaRDP8440499 R001000100012-2 
printed articles based on the 
47-volume Pentagon Papers 
ever had possession of the four 
volumes deserfbed by the gov-
ernment as the most sensitive. 
Those volumes dealt with U.S. 
diplomatic contacts t hip ough 
other nations, for a negotiated 
settlement of the Vietnam war. 
After government suits 
against The New York Times, 
The Washington Post arid 
other newspaper had worked 
their way through the federal 
courts, the Supreme Court de-
clared on June 30 that the gov-
ernment had not proved its 
contention that publication 
would endanger national se-
curity. 
? in releasing the documents 
last night, Anderson said "I 
don't think the public should 
have to take either my word 
or Dr. 'Kissinger's" about 
whether his columns had 
quoted the documents "out of 
context!' 
"I invite reporters to com-
pare Dr. Kissinger's state-
ments at the secret strategy 
sessions with the transcript of 
Di. Kissinger's background 
briefing to reporters on Dec. 
7." 
That "background" talk be 
came public when Sen. Barry 
Goldwater (R-Ariz.) placed i 
in the Congressional Record, 
to the surprise of the White 
House. 
In the meeting with news 
men on Dec. 7, Kissinger said, 
"First of all, let us get a num-
ber ef things straight. There 
have cen sonic comments 
that the ad min is trtio n is 
anti-Indian. This is totally in-
accurate 
Kissinger said, howeve r, 
that the United States, "which 
in many respects has had a 
love affair with India, can only! 
with enormous pain accept the I 
fact that military action was! 
taken in our view without ade-
quate cause . . ." 
State Department officials 
denied yesterday that any in-
vestigation of the leak was Un-
derway there. Other sources. 
at State said no one there 
had been required to under-
go lie 'detector tests, as in 
some previous security invest-. 
Igattons. 
Anderson said, however, that 
his sources told him investiga-
tions were being conducted at 
State. Defense and the White 
!House,, reportedly under the 
!coordination of Robert C. 
Mardian, assistant attorney 
general in charge of the Jus-
tice Department's Internal Se-
curity Division. 
A .Justice Department 
spokesman said last4 night, 
howe,V,M -that "assistant at-
torney generals don't coordi-
nate investigations." if any 
Prosecution were initiated, he 
added, that might fall into 
1"Mardian's bailiwick." 
! "If Mardian's investigating, 
,Inc." said Anderson, who took 
over the "WashingtonMerry-
(in-Round" column from the 
late Drew Pearson, "I'm go-1 
ittgl to investigate him." 
"I have an idea I'll know 
more about him than he'll' 
know about me," Anderson; 
;,...rided. "He can take his to a! 
grand jtuy, and I'll take mine 
to the public."

MUSKIE, From Al 
panion and Muskie neighbor 
at Kennebunk Beach, and 
long-time Muskie aides and 
advisers Berl Bernhard, Ge-
orge Mitchell, Don Nicoll 
and Milton Semer. 
As always, Muskie did lit 
tie talking, but went around 
the room asking each man's 
views. Harriman was first, 
and he declared the Presi. 
dent Nixon's methods would 
backfire, that Muskie should 
pick a few issues and stick 
In those but make a deter-
mined, nearly Open run 100 
We top office. By all means, 
he should run. 
"I'm an old man, and I 
don't want to die with 
Richard Nixon in the While 
linage," said the 78-year-old 
patriarch of the party. 
There was general agree. 
mcnt Mr. Nixon was valuer. 
able and that Mashie was 
the one Democrat with the 
stature and credibility to 
snake the liberal position 
make sense in opposition. 
But prior to the 1972 race, 
Muskie was faced with seek-
ing re-election to the Senate 
in November, 1970. There 
was much discussion of the 
proper blend of the presi-
dential buildup with the si-
multaneous Senate race in 
hinter. 
Characteristically cau-
tious, Muskie was reluctant 
toga very for down the trail 
leading to the White House. 
After nearly three hours of 
talk, Clark Clifford, who 
likes to speak last, summed 
up the consensus. Some brat 
steps toward staffing the 
presidential drive should 
now begin, but quietly and 
slowly at first. 
"You don't have to decide 
everything today. 'there is 
lots of time," Clifford de-
clared. 
Muskie made no commit-
ment at the close of the 
meeting. but it was clear to 
everyone that a bridge was 
being crossed. It was agreed 
that Muskie would institu-
tionalize his effort to ex-
plore the presidential bid, 
opening the first small 
downtown office as a staff 
renter for this purpose and 
raising funds to support a 
growing exploration.

Gen. Robert E. Cushman Jr., 
YesterdaS

when asked if he believe thel 
Vietnam War had been "worth I

"I do believe that the policy

'T do believe that.' Cush-

said. 
, Asked how Vietnam was im-

ests and what the war "bought 
us," Cushman replied, "I be-
lieve it may be important eco-
nomically as well as strategi-
catty in a geographic sense to 
have friends In that area." 
As to whether this was 
worth the billions the war 
cost, Cushman said "I don't 
really feel qualified to an-
swer." 
Turning to his coming four

'Corps, Cushman said he will

lean and tough. He said the

left over from the 1968 vice 
presidential drive was trans-
ferred to a new account am-
biguously labeled "Muskie 
Election Committee" (which 
might refer to Maine or to 
the nation at large.) From 
this day forward, the Mus-
kie presidential campaign 
was scarcely ever in doubt. 
Whatever his disclaimers 
(usually accompanied by a 
grin), he was off and run-
ning. 
it was a long and often 
rocky trail that brought the 
shy son of a Polish immi-
a,rant tailor from Rumford, 
Maine, to a starting gate po-
sition as the tallyho for the 
Democratic presidential 
nomination in 1972. Like the 
political path of many 
American leaders, the M.-
kie trail includes many acci-
dental turns, some detours 
and a considerable number 
of lucky breaks. ' 
A mere glance at the sur. 
lace facts demonstrate that 
this is an extraordinary can-
didaey in many respects. 
According to the trash. 
tonal wisdom of American 
politics, the Democratic 
Party would be most 
unlikely to choose as its 1972 
standard-bearer a Roman 
Catholic from a prcdomi 
nanny Republican state ion 
far corner of the nation, a 
state with only four elec. 
total votes and 00 010 over 
15.000 population. 
Moreover, Muskie is nei-
ther HO nor the favorite of 
the rich; unthl. four years 
ago he was virtually un-
known to most Americans, 
he has no interest group 
(such as organized labor) en-
thusiastically behind him. 
He has little experience in 
foreign affairs ond except 
for some. reputation as a pol-
lution n widely 
fighter, is not  
known for any particuLar ac-

Mashie's chief assets now

Muskies first national 
fling Was in 1064, and it was 
both modest and synthetic. 
He was fatting a reelection 
campaign in Maine that fall, 
and staff aides thought d 
would do him some good at 
home to be mentioned as a 
possible vice presidential 
running mate for President 
Johnson. The aides spread 
the. word that Muskie was 
the logical choice, because 
of his ethnic background 
and New England regional 
appeal. Johnson never seri-
ously considered him. but 
Muskie's name was often 
mentioned in press specula-

"I went for the quiet

"I know I talk too much..,

During the fall campaign, 
Mashie's ecool" approach 
won him much acclaim as a 
welcome contrast to all 
three men sharing the na-
tional tickets? Humphrey, 
Nixon and Spiro Agnew. 
Demoeratic Party planners 
and the press gave aluskie 
unusual attention as a coun-
terpoint to Agnew, who was 
considered the weak link in

a fatalistic streak in nim, an 
inner voice that reminds 
him that nobody can predict

will be, will be. 
"You work hard and you
