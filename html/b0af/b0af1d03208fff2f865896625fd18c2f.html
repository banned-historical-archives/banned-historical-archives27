Richard Lowenthal 
? Tito's Adventure 
In which love's labour was lost 
DO not think the new conflict with the 
Soviet Communists has been ti disappoint-
ment to our Party or to our people?only to 
some of our leaders." The words were said with 
a smile, but the underlying bitterness was un-
mistakable. The speaker, a Yugoslav Commun-
ist with considerable international experience, 
clearly belonged to those who were relieved 
rather than surprised when the new break came. 
I met many of them during my latest visit to 
Yugoslavia in July, and one of my most striking 
impressions was the frankness with which they 
voiced their criticism of some of the policies 
pursued by President Tito during the period of 
the abortive reconciliation with the Soviet 
Union, or at least during its later part?roughly 
from September, 1956, to October, 1957. 
Lest this be misunderstood, let roe hasten to 
explain that my informants were loyal Corn-
munist Party members and firm believers in a 
posture of "non-alignment" in the cold war. 
(Indeed, I doubt whether even a non-Commun-
ist government in Yugoslavia, provided it cared 
to maintain the unity and independence of the 
country, could adopt a different posture.) None 
of them had ever feared that President Tito 
could be moved to join the Soviet military bloc, 
or submit once again to the discipline of a re-
surrected Cominform under Soviet or Sovief 
EXECli 
Chinese leadership. None of them was in th 
least worried that there could be any serious 
opposition within the Party to its renewed stand 
for political and ideological autonomy. What 
they -did convey, one by one, r,,af, a tnsc et 
having emerged from a dangerous adventui._ 
which had needlessly damaged the international 
position of their country, one that had exposed 
both the Party in general and each of them per-
sonally to intense strain. And, openly or by 
implication, they put the blame for this adven-
ture on Tito himself. 
Their criticism was not, of course, directed _ 
against reconciliation with the Soviet Union in 
the sense of a "normalisatibn" of relations, as 
originally begun after Stalin's death. That, on 
the contrary, they recognised as a precondition 
for securing the advantages of a non-aligned 
position in world affairs. The adventure, in their 
view, was the later attempt to influence the trend 
of overall Soviet policy?domestic as well as 
external?during its post-Stalin period of flux by 
"keeping in" with Khrushchev, backing him 
in his internal struggle far-power. It was this 
gamble for high stakes that for more than a 
year seriously divided the Yugoslav Communist 
leaders behind their facade of outward unani-
mity, and it is its final failure that has brought 
the hidden tension to the surface. For nobody in 
Belgrade doubts that the failure is final, or that 
the whole policy was based on a miscalculation 
of the mainsprings of Khrushchev's policy where 
questions of- Soviet bloc discipline and inter-
Communist relations are concerned. 
Nobody in Belgrade any longer believes that 
Khrushchev has been forced against his will to 
adout this policy--either by a mysterious "Stalin-
ist" opposition in the party presidium, or even 
by Mao Tse-tung. Of course, the Yugoslays are 
well aware that Peking has in recent months 
exerted its influence to increase the violence and 
viciousness of the new Soviet 'campaign against 
them, just as it seem's to 'use its influence to try 
and push Soviet foreign policy in general in the 
direction of bomb-rattling threats. But the Yugo-
slays do not jump to, the, silly conclusion that 
because China, the ;econofnically and militarily 
dependent partner, i5 throwing its weight about 
and causing some wobbles in Soviet diplomacy, 
it has assumed the political and ideological 
leadership of the Communist world; nor can 
they believe that China suddenly, in the spring 
of 1958, forced a Soviet-Yugoslav break which 
Khrushchev himself had announced to them as 
impending in November, 1,957, 'during the 4oth 
anniversary celebrations of the.BbIstievik seizure 
of power! 
The "problem" of why Khrushchev excom 
municated the Yugoslays, which has caused so 
much speculation in the West, does not exercise 
the minds of the Yugoslav Communists. They 
realised the failure of their courtship of Khrush-
chev last October, when he sent them the draft 
of the declaration that was" to be signed in 
Moscow, and that later was signed by all ruling 
Communist parties except the Yugoslays. The 
essence of that declaration, with its attribution 
of all the troubles of the world to the "imperial-
ist warmongers," its 'emphasis on the need to 
strengthen the Warsaw Pact, and its elcclara, 
of war on ideological "revisionism," was that 
nobody coulcl be a good Communist who did 
not join the Soviet military bloc and accept the 
Soviet concept of ideological orthodoxy. It was, 
in fact, at the very moment when Khrushchev, 
with the elimination of Marshal Zhukov from 
the army leadership and the party presidium, 
finally achieved complete and undisputed dicta-
torial power at home that the Yugoslays had to 
abandon the illusion of their influence on him. 
Just when the horse they had backed all along 
had won the race, they discovered that it would 
not be paid off after all! 
Or perhaps I should say that Tito, Rankovk, 
and a few other leaders discovered it, for many 
other Yugoslav Communists had suspected it 
long before. Because of that, the final failure of 
the gamble has for the first time seriously im-
paired?though not, of course, destroyed?Tito's 
personal authority within his party. This has 
had a number of curious consequences. One has 
been the extremely unpleasant tendency of the 
political police to increase the harassment of 
critics and suspected critics after the break with 
Russia?and I am not talking of pro-Soviet 
critics. Another has been the extreme official 
reticence about the secret history of the period 
of rapprochement, even though Khrushchev has 
deliberately taunted the Yugoslays by "disclos-
ing" selected half-truths in his speeches. But 
thirdly, and partly nullifying that official reti 
cence, there has been the willingness of respon-
sible critics to hint at vital, hitherto undisclosed 
facts?facts which allow,. I believe, a tentative' 
reconstruction of that secret history, .,nal in par-
ticular of the rOle which the Yugoslav attitude 
to Hungary?before, during and after the revo-
lution?played in it.

Tito's Adventure?Galley 2 Encounter 
TN one of his recent speeches, Khrushchev 
I claimed that he had at no time placed all the 
blame for Stalin's 1948 break with Yugoslavia 
on Russia's account: he had always told the 
Yugoslav leaders that, in his view, both sides had 
made mistakes, but they had not dared to pass 
this on to their Party. The facts behind this 
claim are intriguing. It appears that Khrush-
chev's 1955 visit to Belgrade was preceded by a 
preparatory correspondence between the Soviet 
and Yugoslav Central Committees, extending 
over several months, and that in the course of 
these exchanges Khrushchev indeed proposed 
that each side should accept part of the respon-
sibility for the past conflict: the Soviets would 
blame their share on Beria, and the Yugoslays 
should blame theirs on Djilas (who by then had 
already been expelled from the party). This 
brilliant suggestion was not, of course, kept 
secret by Tito; it was put before a meeting of 
the Yugoslav Central Committee late in 1954, 
and was turned down at his own suggestion. (As 
one critic put it, "Tito would not be such a fool 
as to give Djilas all the credit for the struggle 
for national independence.") Tito's famous 
scowl when Khrushchev publicly dished out the 
Beria story on arrival at Belgrade airport was 
thus due to a realisation that Khrushchev in-
tended to stick to a formula which Tito had 
already rejected. No agreement seems to have 
been reached on this point during the Belgrade 
discussions, which was one of the reasons why 
the joint declaration that finally emerged was 
signed on behalf of the governments rather than 
the Parties; and when Khrushchev defended his 
action against Molotov's criticism before the 
Soviet Central Committee on his return, he still 
maintained internally?as he has since stated 
publicly?that the first Cominform resolution of 
1948 which excommunicated the Yugoslav party 
was "basically correct." 
Nevertheless, the Yugoslays were highly satis-
fied with the result of the visit. By confirming 
the first stage of the public rapprochement to the 
sphere of state relations, they had succeeded in 
establishing their right to sovereign equality and 
independence before accepting Party ties. The 
fact of the visit and of their treatment as brother-
Marxists had the moral effect of a unilateral 
admission of Stalin's fault, whatever the for-
mula; and the Soviet acceptance of the right of 
each country to determine its own road to social-
ism, though it might mean less in Khrushchev's 
mind than in Tito's, was bound to encourage 
all those Communists in the satellite countries 
who wished to get out of the Stalinist mire and 
to learn from the Yugoslav example, whether 
the Russians liked it or not. Yet the very extent 
of the new possibilities opened by their success 
faced them with a new problem. 
Even before Khrushchev's visit to Belgrade, 
the beginning evaluation of Stalin had com-
bined with the loosening of Soviet police super-
vision in the satellites, and with the first moves 
towards a normalisation of Soviet-Yugoslav rela-
tions, to cause new hopeful stirrings among the 
surviving victims of Stalin's "anti-Titoist" purges 
in the satellites. Watching these developments 
with keen interest, the Yugoslays had come to 
the conclusion that nowhere were they more 
promising than in neighbouring Hungary. 
There, a surviving advocate of a policy of inter-
nal autonomy and popular reform, Imre Nagy, 
had actually come with Soviet consent to hold 
office as Prime Minister?though not power as 
Party leader?since the summer of 1953, and had 
followed the Yugoslav example in permitting 
the peasants to leave the collective farms. And 
when by the winter of 1954-5 the counter-offen-
sive of the old Stalinist leadership around Rakosi 
led to bitter disputes in the Hungarian Central 
Committee, the Yugoslays were optimistic about 
the outcome and about Nagy's eventual chances 
by further reforms to win a broader mass basis 
for an independent Communist regime. Even 
when Nagy was overthrown by the "old guard" 
in March 1955, apparently as a by-procuct of 
Malenkov's fall and the campaign for the pri-
macy of heavy industry in Russia, the Yugoslays 
were inclined to regard this as a mere temporary 
setback to the forces of progress, just as Nagy 
himself continued to prepare memoranda ce-
fending his policy for the Hungarian Central 
Committee and the Soviet leaders. 
Nor was Yugoslav interest in developments 
among the Hungarian Communists purely ideo-
logical. For years, their own hardly-won inde-
pendence had been perilously similar to isolation; 
and while Russia's new emphasis on peaceful 
coexistence encouraged them to proclaim the 
ambitious goal of an ultimate dissolution of the 
two hostile military blocs in world affairs, their 
practical diplomacy patiently pursued the more 
modest aim of extending the area of bloc-free 
nations, and preferably to create a belt of neutral 
territory in their neighbourhood. For that 
reason, Khrushchev's agreement to sign at last 
the "State Treaty" which guaranteed the with-
drawal of both Russia and the Western powers 
from a neutral Austria was to the Yugoslays a 
vital proof of his good will, far outweighing any 
awkward remnants of doctrinaire rigidity he 
might show. It owed its special importance in 
their minds to the hope that eventually an inde-
pendent Con2,munist Hungary might also become 
neutral with Russian consentfl We know today, 
from Imre Nagy's papers, that by the beginning 
of 1956 he, too, had committed himself to the 
vision of close Yugoslav-Hungaro-Austrian co-
operation on the basis of neutrality; and though 
by that time he had been expelled from Rakosi's 
party (and the fact that he held these views and 
communicated them to the Yugoslays has since 
figured in its indictment for treason), the Rakosi 
regime was so obviously unstable that the Yugo-
slays could well count on his eventual comeback. 
Not for nothing had the rehabilitation of Laszlo 
Raj k?executedin 5949 for alleged treasonable 
co-operation with Yugoslavia?and the dropping 
of Rakosi been the only specific changes in 
satellite policy which Tito urged on Khrushchev 
from the start; and he obtained the former in 
April 1956?after the disavowal of Stalin at the 
Soviet party congress?and the latter in July of 
the same year, after his own triumphant journey 
through Russia.

Tito's Adventure ? Galley 3 
Encounter 
YE T Khrushchev, in fact, never intended to 
permit Hungarian neutrality, or ven full 
political autonomy in internal .affairs. When he 
finally sacrificed Rakosi because the pressure 
had become too strong and the discredit brought 
on the regime by Rakosi's known share in 
Stalin's crimes too intolerable, he appointed as 
successor not Nagy but Enloe Geroe, who had 
been Rakosi's closest associate throughout. More-
cover, warned by the Poznan rising and by the 
(outburst of free discussion in both Poland and 
Hungary that "destalinisation" might easily go 
f ar beyond his intentions, and worried about 
Yugoslav moral backing for "anto-Stalinists" in 
;the satellite countries, Khrushchev now faced 
'Tito with a demand that he should switch his 
support to Geroe in the interests of stability: 
Otherwise, his own new course in Russia might 
be in danger from "Stalinist reaction:' At that 
time, such a danger was not wholly fictitions: 
the pro-Stalin riots in Georgia which followed 
circulation of the "secret speech" in the spring 
had not been confined to Tiflis, and some of the 
demonstrators had called for Molotov, then still 
a member of the party presidium and a first 
deputy premier of the Soviet Union. 
This, then, was the decision confronting Tito: 
whether to continue backing his anti-Stalinist 
friends in the satellites and above all in Hun-
gary, at the risk of incurring Khrushchev's dis-
pleasure and possibly weakening the "progres-
sive" elements in the Soviet party presidium?or 
whether to abandon his real friends in order to 
keep Khrushchev's confidence and perhaps help 
keep him in power. Some might have viewed it 
as a decision between ideological and moral 
principle and cautious opportunism; from 
another angle, it implied a choice between the 
regional interests of an independent Yugoslavia, 
which had inspired the backing of Nagy, and 
the dream of influencing Soviet policy from 
outside. In fact, Tito chose Khrushchev, and 
invited Geroe to Yugoslavia; though he gained 
for Nagy readmission to the Party as a con-
solation prize. The choice was made against the' 
advice of many of his closest colleagues, and of 
all the Yugoslays most intimately concerned 
with Hungarian affairs. That was the moment 
when the adventure began. 
A r this point, and before going on to the Yugo-
-06. slay attitude during the crucial days of the. 
Hungarian rising, a word must be said about 
the alignment within the Yugoslav leadership, 
The one group that wholeheartedly backed 
Tito's bid ,for Khrushchev's friendship were 
those conservative party bureaucrats who had 
long been uneasy about Yugoslavia's own 
orthodox" reforms, especially since Djilae evolu-
tion had shown how easily these reforms, if 
pursued consistently, might become a threat to 
the Party's power. These people were as good 
Yugoslav patriots, as determined to defend their 
country's independence against all corners, as 
Tito himself; but because they hoped that better 
relations with Russia would stop the dangerous 
drift towards "liberalisation" at home, they were 
only too willing to believe that these better rela-
tions could be secured without danger to their 
independence, simply by talking less about ideo-
logical matters. This group was dominant in 
the Serbian Central Committee; it also included 
the only Serb (the only one from Serbia, at any 
rate) among Tito's deputies?Aleksandar Ran-
kovic, creator of the political police and con-
troller of the Party's organisation and personnel. 
It was, in_fact, from about Ithis time that Ran-
kovic came forward as Tito's effective deputy 
In all Party matters, 4nd began to be discreetly 
boosted as his design?ted successor. 
Conversely, the leaders opposed to conces-
sions to Khrushchev, and particularly to dealings 
with Geroe, were the same who had shown most 
zeal in promoting Yugoslavia's interal reforms, 
from the workers' councils to the dissolution of 
Soviet-style kolkhozes. These people did not 
belittle the importance of the process of social 
`chalige that had started in post-Stalinist Russia, 
but they refused to regard it as dependent pri-
marily on KhrushcheOs influence, or to believe 
? that Yugoslav efforts to support hin-i could have 
a decisive effect on the broad trend of Russian 
development. In their view, Yugoslavia could 
contribute most to that trend by continuing her 
, 'own experiment and seeking to win increased 
diplomatic elbow room by support for like-
minded elements in neighbouring countries. 
Not surprisingly, this group had its main 
strength among the Slovenian and Croat* 
leadership?i.e. in the most advanced parts of 
the country. To him, the vision of closer co-
operation with a neutral Hungary and Austria 
was both historically plausible and politically 
welcome as a recipe for diluting the retrograde 
"Balkanic" influences within Yugoslavia, while 
preserving the unity of the Yugoslav nation. 
They also enjoyed the warm support of all those 
, younger elements in the party who feared from 
closer relations with Russia the very thing which 
the orthodox disciplinarians hoped for?an end 
- to reform and experiment, a tightening of con-
, :trol from above, an attempt to shut the windows 
and to restore the stuffy climate of an orthodoxy 
they had outgrown during the years when Yugo-
slavia first discovered the non-Communist world. 
Between these groups, the ageing leader was 
apparently swayed, by motives all his own. There 
is no reason to assume that he shared the pre-
occupations of the petty bureaucrats, their fear 
of further reforms and dangerous ideas, but 
neither was he much concerned to spread the 
ideology of "Titoism" within a limited regional 
framework. For years, he had become accus-
tomed to bestride the world stage; now the 
evolution of post-Stalinist Russia seemed to 
present him with the chance of a new "historic 
role." Perhaps we in the West have during the 
past decade come to take Marshal Tito too much 
for granted as a national leader, and to under-
estimate the emotional importance of his long 
years as a professional international revolution-
ary. However genuinely and successfully he 
filled his national rOle, the separation from the 
comrades of his youth must have been a severe 
psychological strain?and the chance to return 
into that brotherhood, not defeated and contrite 
but proudly triumphant, an immense tempta-
tion. During his Russian journey in the summer 
, of 1956, when enthusiastic crowds hailed him at 
every station as the symbol of their own new 
hopes, that temptation assumed flesh and blood. 
. Russia, and with Russia the whole Communist 
world, seemed to lie at his feet, willing to follow 
his road if only he was patient. So when Khrush-
chev, having failed to obtain Tito's return to the 
Soviet bloc, sent to the satellite parties a circular 
warning them against Yugoslav heretical influ-
ences, and then offered reconciliation if Tito 
would shake hands with Geroe, how could lie 
refuse?

Tito's Adventure?Galley 4 Encounter 
BEFORE the Hungarian ?Party delegation 
under Geroe came to Yugoslavia, Vlajko 
Begovic, a member of the Yugoslav Central 
Committee, had warned in a long report from 
Budapest that Geroe enjoyed no authority and 
that events were moving towards a revolution. 
While the visit was in progress, Gumulka 
assumed power in Poland and defied Khrush-
chev's attempt to intervene; the news was en-
thusiastically received in Hungary. The dele-
gation itself turned out to be divided: Kadar was 
clearly in favour of further changes but Geroe 
continued to defend his record; and the Yugo-
slays, faithful to their agreement with Khrush-
chev, "did not intervene in Hungarian Party 
affairs." Directly on his return from Yugoslavia, 
Geroe made the provocative broadcast which 
,turned a peaceful students' demonstration into 
a revolt, and during the following night asked 
for the intervention of Soviet troops which 
.turned the revolt into a rising supported by 
?the bulk of the Hungarian armed forces. 
The Yugoslav leaders were naturally shocked 
.by this "Stalinist" behaviour of their supposed 
protege, Geroe, and extremely worried about the 
consequences. When, after a few days, the suc-
cess of the rising led to the replacement of Geroe 
by Kadar with Soviet consent, and the pretence 
of Nagy's appointment to head the government 
became a reality, they hoped?as did the Soviet 
representatives on the spot?that Kadar and 
Nagy would succeed in stabilising the situation 
under a reformed Communist regime. But it 
quickly became clear that the revolutionary 
movement had gone beyond that stage, that the 
people and the armed forces were calling for a 
revival of democratic political parties, a with-
drawal of all Soviet troops, and immediate 
neutrality and that Nagy was willing to meet 
these demands. At that point the Soviets lost-
confidence in Nagy?and so, did Tito,

Tito's Adventure?Galley 5 ? Encounter 
The motives of that decision have been ob-
scured by a flood of lies about the alleged danger 
of "fascists" and "counter-revolutionaries" get-
ting control of the movement?lies which Tito 
later repeated in his Pula speech. The more 
honest Yugoslav spokesmen have always said 
that the crucial argument for the second Soviet 
intervention was one of power politics rather 
than ideology. The Soviet leaders had, in fact, 
never intended to allow a Communist Hungary 
to leave the Warsaw Pact; they could not pos-
sibly permit a non-Communist Hungary to do 
so in an atmosphere of violent rebellion against 
Soviet control, and at the moment of the inter-
national crisis produced by the Suez expedition. 
in Soviet language, which the Yugoslays under-
stood only too well, the term "counter-revolu-
tionary" simply expressed the fact that the move-
ment was no longer in Communist hands, and 
the fear that a new democratic government 
would in fact assume a pro-Western orientation 
whatever its formal neutrality. What was at 
stake, from the Soviet point of view, was the 
loss of an important territory to their potential 
enemies, without compensation and with incal-
culable repercussions on other members of their 
bloc, at a moment of high international tension. 
To prevent that, they were prepared to use force. 
The Yugoslav leaders were thrown into a 
panic. They seriously feared an East-West clash 
,on their borders; most of them also feared that 
anti-Communist revolution might spread to en-
gulf their own regime. For a day or two, some 
of them considered the idea of marching in 
-before the Soviets did, to ensure both the .sur-
vival of Communism and "real" neutrality; at 
any rate, Yugoslav diplomats sounded Nagy's 
Advisers on how they would react to such a 
move, but nothing came of jt. Instead, there 
is now evidence that before their decisive second 
intervention, the Soviet leaders informed and 
consulted the Yugoslays, and that Tito, while 
disagreeing on some points with the Soviet 
analysis, gave his advance consent to the crush-
ing of the Hungarian revolution. 
Tti I s advance consultation is the background 
. to the charge, made in the Kadar govern-
ment's reply to the Yugoslav protest against 
Imre Nagy's execution, that "during the night of 
November 3rd-4th, when the responsible Yugo-
slav authorities, on the basis of confidential infor-
mation received by them, had learned that at 
dawn on November 4th the revolutionary 
worker-peasant government and the Soviet 
troops would, with joint forces, launch a counter-
attack to crush the counter-revolution, Minister 
Soldatic telephoned the leaders of the Imre Nagy 
group and, with reference to the expressed 
request of Belgrade, appealed to them to avail 
themselves at once to the right of asylum," [my 
italics]. The reference to confidential informa-
tion clearly implies something more official than 
the reports about the approach of returning 
Soviet forces which were generally known in the 
Hungarian capital during its last days of free-
dom. 
I was first told about this consultation?by a 
critical Yugoslav Communist?two weeks before 
the above hint was published by the Hungarians. 
According to my informant, it took the form of 
a flying visit by Khrushchev (straight from 
Moscow) and Mikoyan (coming from Hungary 
where he had just got Kadar to abandon Nagy) 
to Tito at Brioni island on one of the first days 
of November; the Soviet leaders had by then 
made up their minds, but were anxious to obtain 
Yugoslav political support for their action in 
order to ease Kadar's future work in rebuilding 
the regime, and to contain anticipated reactions 
in Poland and other satellites. I am not certain 
that the details about the flying visit can easily 
be reconciled with what is otherwise known 
about Khrushchev's and Mikoyan's timetable in 
those crowded days, but I am satisfied that 
Yugoslav advance agreement was solicited in 
some form, and was obtained. Apart from the 
hint in the Hungarian note, this is confirmed 
by the immediate Yugoslav reaction to the 
second Soviet intervention: it was one of com-
plete approval. This was shown in a circular 
sent out by the Yugoslav Central Committee on 
November 5th; in the attitude taken, clearly on 
instruction from home, by the Yugoslav observer 
at the Asian Socialist conference then meeting 
at Rangoon; in the behaviour of the Yugoslav 
chief delegate to the United Nations, who turned 
his back when Anna Kethly, the Hungarian 
Socialist leader, was introduced to him; and not 
least in the grossly misleading confidential infor-
mation sent by Tito at the time to Pandit Nehru, 
which was the principal cause of the unsym-
pathetic attitude initially taken by the Indian 
leader towards the revolt of the Hungarian 
people. 
It would be unjust to accuse Tito and his 
team of having betrayed the cause of Hungarian 
democracy. They are Communists, not demo-
crats, and they cannot betray principles which 
they have never professed. But they did betray 
their own dream of a neutral, progressive 
Hungary when it could no longer be reconciled 
with the preservation of Communist party rule, 
?and thejf sided with Kadar against Nagy who 
clung to the dream. As a last service, they tried 
to save them by granting them temporary 
asylum in the Yugoslav Embassy, but they were 
not strong enough. If they were ever deceived 
by the Kadar government's promise of safe-
conduct for those who would leave the building, 
their Minister at least must have learnt the truth 
at the last minute. For the Hungarian officer 
who headed the escort for Nagy--he is now a 
refugee abroad?reported to him with the words: 
"Mr. Prime Minister, it's not home we are 
going"; and that was still inside the building 
and before Nagy's final leave-taking from his 
Yugoslav friends.

Tito's Adventure?Galley 6   Encounter 
r-r1-I a critical reaction of the Yugoslav Com-
l. munist rank and file to thc Soviet interven-
tion in Hurtgary proved unexpectedly strong. For 
the first time, Tito had publicly to admit a mis-
take. Within a week of the final crushing of the 
revolution by Soviet tanks, he admittec in his 
Pula speech that he had been unwise to receive 
Geroe who had proved himself an unrepentant 
Stalinist and had brought about the Hungarian 
tragedy by his incompetent and provocative be-
haviour. In a further circular he sought to explain 
the nature of the pressure from Khrushchev to 
which he had yielded in September. Moreover, 
he publicly emphasized the issue on which he 
now disagreed with the official Soviet view?
that the rising had started as a genuine working 
class movement with the active participation of 
many good Communists, and had only come 
under the leadership of the "reactionary 
elements" ,later on. A motith later, Edward 
Kardelj, the leading ideologist of the party and 
the architect of many of its anti-Stalinist reforms, 
who had been silent since the September agree-
ment to support Geroe, went even farther in a 
speech to the Federal Assembly, and argued that 
the Hungarian revolution had shown how 
utterly a monopolistic party, by merging with 
the state machine and relying on its power, 
could become estranged from the working class 
?regardless of whether or not it called itself 
Communist and claimed to be the vanguard of 
that class; and he explicitly drew the conclusion 
that the Yugoslav Communists should show 
more boldness than hitherto in detaching them-
selves from the state machine and relying chiefly 
on their influence in the organs of self-govern-
ment. But neither Tito nor Kardelj could even 
now condemn the second and decisive Soviet 
intervention; the formula adopted by them was 
that it might prove historically justified if it led 
to a better new start of the Communist regime. 
Meanwhile, Khrushchev had really suffered a 
temporary weakening of his domestic position, 
owing not to Tito's action, but to the actions of 
the Polish and Hungarian peoples who were 
subject to no such subtle tactical calculations. 
Even though the Soviet leaders now shared 
Tito's contempt for Geroe's incompetence, they 
could not swallow his view of the total bank-
ruptcy of the Hungarian Stalinist regime and 
the revolutionary character of the rising; the 
speeches of Tito and particularly Kardelj gave 
rise to bitter polemics in the Soviet and inter-
national Communist press. The Yugoslays 
answered back for a time, most outspoken when 
Bulganin hinted?at the beginning of April, 
1957?at a possible trial of Imre Nagy in which 
they would be compromised. But the knowledge 
of the leaders that they had approved the second 
and decisive Soviet intervention in advance 
caused them to pull their punches?as it does to 
this day. Indeed, even this summer, when I 
asked whether they still considered the second 
intervention as "hi'stoirically justified" in the 
light of subsequent developments including the 
execution of Nagy, I could not get a single 
Yugoslav spokesman, whether government offi-
cial or Central Committee member, to answer 
on the record with a clear No. 
Indeed, while the first after effect of the Hun-
garian tragedy within the Yugoslav Party had 
Deen to make Tito yield somewhat to the indig-
nation of the rank and file, second thoughts soon 
made him veer in a different direction. Clearly, 
the elan of the forces of reform within the 
satellite countries had been broken by the 
frightful object lesson of Hungary, and Yugo-
slavia's own independent ideological influence 
would henceforth be limited by the ambiguity 
of her position at the critical moment. In Russia 
herself, Stalinist reaction seemed once again in 
the ascendant, and if it finally triumphed all 
the gains of the post-Stalin thaw might be lost. 
Two, the one overriding task, after Hungary 
even more than before, seemed to be to support 
Khrushchev against the Stalinists. At the end 
of April, 1957, Tito sent him /personal message 
offering a renewal of the ideological truce, which 
was gladly accepted; the press polemics stopped 
abruptly, and the reformers within the Yugoslav 
leadership fell silent once again. 
Khrushchev, however, did not fail to spot the 
weakness underlying the move. Shortly after his 
triumph over Malenkov, Molotov, and Kagano-
vich, in a speech in a Prague factory he talked 
of the Yugoslays in a tone of condescension 
verging on friendly contempt: he felt sure that 
the remaining differences would be overcome 
by ?frank talk, as he had no objection to the 
Yugoslays retaining their own peculiar institu-
tions such as workers' councils?but he would 
no longer tolerate that they set themselves up as 
a rival international model. The frank talking 
subsequently took place in Bucharest at the 
beginning of August?and it marked the closest 
point of the rapprochment. 
BY that time, Khrushchev was fully embarked 
on plans for some new form of organised 
co-operation among at least the ruling Commun-
ist Parties, which was to consolidate once again 
the unity of the Soviet bloc and to help restore 
the international authority of its leading power; 
and he wanted to make sure that the Yugoslays, 
despite their bitter memories of the Cominform, 
would help rather than hinder the new project. 
The Bucharest meeting took place in great 
secrecy, and the final communique was ambig-
uous, talking on one side of obstacles to complete 
agreement which would still have to be over-
come, but on the other of the particular impor-
tance both sides attached to "the strengthening, 
in all its aspects, of the unity and fraternal co-
operation of the Communist and Workers' 
Parties of the peoples of all socialist countries." 
Since the break, Khrushchev has claimed that 
at this meeting Tito agreed to come to the 4oth 
anniversary celebrations in Moscow in Novem-
ber and to sign a joint declaration of principles 
of the ruling Communist Parties; while the 
Yugoslays say that they left under the impres-
sion of having convinced Khrushchev that they 
could be more useful to the cause of peace by 
staying, contrary to his original wish, outside 
the Soviet bloc. The two versions are not really 
in conflict, and each of them contains some truth 
?but hardly the whole truth.

Tito's Adventure Galley 7   Encounter 
The question of Yugoslavia's joining the 
Soviet camp in the military sense, by becoming 
a, member of the Warsaw Pact, was not a major 
subject of discussion at the meeting. Yugoslavia's 
unwillingness to do so was, of course, a per-
manent sore point with Khrushchev, and he 
probably raised it again. But when they declined, 
he had no need to insist in the light of two 
considerations: their growing willingness to be 
"useful to the cause of peace" by supporting 
Soviet foreign policy all along the line?inclu-
ding, presumably, the promise of an early recog-
nition of the East German government; and 
their agreement to accept much closer Party ties 
than before. 
In fact, the talks were held strictly on a Party 
level, with the international secretaries of both 
Parties present and without any government 
ministers or officials; and the principal subject 
was the forthcoming Moscow conference of all 
the Communist Parties of the world, and the 
need to issue a joint declaration of principles. 
If the Yugoslays agreed to that, they would 
automatically have to abandon the attitude, first 
defined by Kardelj in his Oslo speech in 1954, 
that Eastern Communist and Western "reform-
ist" parties were both making valuable contri-
butions to the cause of socialism, with its corol-
lary that the Soviet bloc had no monopoly of 
Socialist progress; and they would contribute to 
rebuilding an international Communist authority 
whose influence would eventually compel them 
to rejoin the military bloc as well. Thas was at 
least how Khrushchev saw it. Yet Tito did not 
see it that way; and he agreed to attend the 
Moscow celebrations and to help prepare a joint 
declaration of principles without fully realising 
the inevitable consequences of such a move. 
For the Yugoslav leader was now back in the 
same mood as a year previously, before the 
?Hungarian revolution; and he envisaged the 
forthcoming Moscow celebrations as the second 
act to his triumphant tour of Russia?again with 
Khrushchev as his guide, but this time with 
the whole elite of international Communism, 
including Mao Tse-tung, welcoming him back 
to the fold and listening to his words. The brilli-
ance of the prospect somehow blinded the 65-
year-old man to the change in the situation 
brought about by the Hungarian tragedy. Once 
again, as at the time of his visit to Yalta and 
his agreement to back Geroe, he was willing to 
stake the future of Yugoslavia on the chance of 
influencing Khrushchev; and once again he over-
ruled the voices of caution, of which there were 
many. 
DURING the weeks that followed, Yugoslav 
non-alignment rapidly disappeared in all 
but the formal sense. In September, during 
Gomulka's visit, Tito publicly subscribed to the 
Soviet formula of "proletarian internationalism" 
as a guide to foreign policy, and even gave his 
own interpretation of the "leading r'Ole of the 
Soviet Union"?in a sense which would recog-
nise its special responsibility for the common 
cause without impairing the right of each Com-
munist state to its sovereign equality and inde-
pendence. Soon afterwards, recognition of the 
East German government followed?a unique 
act among "non-aligned" states. There remained 
only one meaning to the refusal to join the 
Soviet "camp," but that an important one: so 
long as Yugoslavia was not tied by a higher 
discipline, its support of Soviet foreign policy, 
however complete, remained conditional?it 
could still be withdrawn if Khrushchev tried to 
interfere with Yugoslav independence or re-
lapsed into a policy of aggressive threats. 
It was the Russian attempt to eliminate that 
last but vital reservation which brought about 
the recent crisis. As Yugoslavia's new policy 
increasingly isolated her from the West, as her 
recognition of Eastern Germany led to a break 
in relations with Bonn and to public attacks in 
the United States, while the new heavy sentence 
on Djilas and the trial of pre-war trade union 
leaders alienated the sympathy of Western demo-
cratic socialists, Khrushchev clearly believed that 
the time had come to increase the pressure. 
Suggestions for military arrangements, made 
through diplomatic channels and through Mar-
shal Zhukov during his visit, became fore impor-
tunate. There were attempts to interfere in Party 
matters as well: the new Yugoslav programme 
promised for the next Party congress, which 
was to codify the specific outlook of Yugoslav 
Communism?including, inevitably, its differ-
ences to the Soviet variety?had been all but 
shelved after the Bucharest meeting so as to 
avoid new disagreements; but now the Soviets 
asked to sec the draft so that they might suggest 
amendments even before it reached the Yugoslav 
Party members! The decisive moment came 
when the Soviet draft for the declaration of prin-
ciples to be signed by the ruling Communist 
Parties in Moscow arrived in Belgrade. For 
though Khrushchev has told the truth in that 
this draft did not yet contain the formula recog-
nising Soviet leadership (that was only put in 
later on Mao's suggestion), it was a harsh and 
uncompromising Cold War document, and 
clearly faced the Yugoslays with the implicit 
Ghoice of either unconditionally joining the 
Warsaw Pact, or being attacked as "revisionists" 
and expelled from the Communist family. 
When -Tito saw that draft, he knew at last 
that the gamble on his influence with Khruschev 
had been lost. The dream of his triumphant 
return to the Communist World General Staff 
was ended, and his own visit to the Moscow 
celebrations had to be called off. His deputies, 
Kardelj and Rankovic, had to make it clear from 
the start that they would not sign the declaration 
and were promptly treated in Moscow as out-
casts, despite their readiness to sign the almost 
equally absurd "Peace Manifesto" as a gesture 
. of good will; and when Khrushchev saw them 
at last, he clearly warned them that they would 
be attacked. Since then, the Yugoslays have had 
to prepare for the new break?and the first 
measure of preparation consisted precisely in 
getting the programmatic codification of their 
own theories ready for their Party congress

Tito's Adventure?Galley 8   Encounter 
But then, Tito still seems to have entertained 
the hope that the inevitable disagreement could 
be contained in the forms of a fraternal dis-
cussion among comrades. After the draft had 
been published and circulated to all Communist 
parties in February of this year, and the opening 
blasts of Soviet criticism had been received by 
correspondence between the Central Committees, 
he had some amendments adopted so as to miti-
gate those criticisms of Soviet "hegemonism" 
and of the Warsaw Pact at which the Russians 
seemed to take particular offence. 
Given these concessions, Tito clearly expected 
that those East European leaders who wished to 
preserve some degree of internal independence, 
from Moscow?and among them he included 
not only Gomulka but Kadar?might, in the 
interest of their own autonomy, prevail on 
Khruschcv to avoid an outright break. At the 
end of March, Kadar's wish for an invitation to 
Yugoslavia?uttered long ago in a very different 
situation?was suddenly fulfilled, and the need 
for a joint stand for the autonomous rights of all 
Communist parties, whatever their theoretical 
differences, was broached to him. Kadar's 
reaction seemed friendly enough; but when 
? Khrushchev came to Hungary immediately after 
Kadar's return he concluded from Kadar's 
report that Tito was trying to form an "autono-
mist" bloc with Hungary and Poland, and 
reacted not only by sanctioning the public attack 
on the Yugoslav programme, but by demanding 
from all the satellites what amounted to an im-
mediate break of Party relations with the Yugo-
slays: this was the decision not to send fraternal 
delegates to the Yugoslav congress. It was 
Kadar's immediate compliance and Gomulka's 
hesitation which accounted for the lavish praise 
of the former and the thinly veiled insults 
against the latter (as well as against Tito) in the 
somewhat high-spirited speech Khrushchev made 
on his return to Moscow. 
But even apart from these last-minute 
incidents, it was only logical that Khrushchev, 
viewing the Yugoslav programme as a counter-
document to his own twelve-Party declaration, 
took it as the occasion for an all-out attack and 
final excommunication. For that document justi-
fied in a programmatic form the right of an 
independent Communist state to remain neutral 
between the military blocs, by denying, in an 
elaborate analysis of the contemporary social 
scene, the Soviet bloc's claim to a monopoly of 
Socialist Progress. But if these arguments were 
valid for Yugoslavia, they were equally valid 
for any and every satellite; if a good Communist 
could hold these views, it followed that a good 
Communist was entitled to take any member 
country out of the Warsaw Pact and declare 
itself neutral. For their own sake, the Yugoslav 
Communists had finally had to proclaim in a 
general form the right to neutrality which they 
had failed to support at the critical moment in 
Hungary. The Soviets showed their understand-
ing of what was at stake by demonstrating that 
the right to neutrality did not exist in the Com-
munist world: they excommunicated the Yugo-
slays?and they executed Imre Nagy. 
Ts end of the adventure has not solved 
1 the long-standing disagreements among the 
Yugoslav leaders, but has made it more difficult 
to hide them. The critics arc naturally inclined 
to say "I told you so." The conservative bureau-
crats, equally naturally, seek to defend their 
positions by tightening up discipline within the 
party and by police measures against those critics 
who were expelled from it in 1954 because they 
refused to support the wholesale condemnation 
of Djlas. The resulting atmosphere can be 
smelt in the off-the-record outburst of one mem-
ber of the top Party leadership when asked by a 
Western journalist whether he regarded the 
execution of Nagy as a sign of strength or of 
weakness on the part of the Soviet government. 
"It was a sign of fear" he replied "just as our 
treatment of Djlas was a sign of fear." 
The speaker was very far indeed from sharing 
Djilas' views about the need for an opposition 
party; he was merely utterly fed up with the 
harm done to his country and party by the 
stupid meddling of the political police with 
Party affairs. On no previous visit have I heard 
Party members complain about the activities of 
the police; this time it happened again and 
again. The reason is not, so far as I can judge, 
that the police have become more powerful, but 
that they are trying to become more active in 
many petty ways because they feel threatened. 
I know of no arbitrary arrests; the nearest thing-
is the case of Zhivko Vnuk, expelled former 
editor of the Zagreb Party weekly, who at the 
end of May was hauled in for three or four days 
of bullying "interrogation." But there have been 
quite a number of cases of more polite prolonged 
interrogations of loyal Party members, ranging 
from their personal relations with expelled critics 
to questions concerning their reservations during 
the height of the Tito-Khrushchev flirtation; 
there has been systematic police interference with 
the attempts of Party leaders in good standing to 
bring some of the expelled critics back into the 
Party; ad there has been a real orgy of petty 
harassment against the expelled men themselves. 
Not only has Vladimir Dedijer, Tito's biogra-
pher, been again and again refused permission 
to travel abroad since his Stockholm lecture in 
the spring of last year, when he committed the 
crime of criticising not his own country, but 
the Soviet Union?in terms almost identical with 
those now used in the new Yugoslav party pro-
gramme, but considered harmful to the ideo-
logical truce with Moscow at the time; but the 
Catholic partisan leader and one-time vice-
president of post-war Slovenia, Edward Kocbek, 
was recently prevented from giving a lecture to 
a left-wing Catholic group in Trieste, on the 
ground that he had kept on friendly terms with 
Dedijer Equally stupid are the efforts of the 
police to prevent the publication abroad of a 
critical, political-philosophical play by the Serb 
writer Bora Drenovac, another expelled former 
Partisan, by buying up the French translation 
of the manuscript. Most serious of all was the 
recent deterioration?again after the break?of 
the prison regime for Djilas, which led him in-
June to threaten a hunger strike; fortunately the 
latest information is that conditions improved 
again before such a desperate step was necessary.,

Tito's Adventure?Galley 9 ? ?Encounter 
The political importance of all this pettiness 
is that the blame for it is widely attributed, not 
indeed to Tito who is believed to get very little 
information on these matters, but to Rankovic. 
Though he has abandoned direct control of the 
political police years ago he is generally re-

tector; and while even critics who know him

and do not believe that he would personally

comrades, they claim that his outlook is essen-
tially rigid and narrow and that he covers the 
stupidities of his subordinates in the belief that 
he is shielding the regime from the spreading of 
"hostile influences." But Rankovic's power 
within the Party has steadily grown in recent 
years; and while there is no formal basis for 
the general assumption that he is Tito's desig-
nated successor, it finds indirect confirmation 
not only in the unofficial talk of official spokes-
men, but in the changes made in the Party 
secretariat after the recent congress, when its 
work was subdivided into a number of com-
missions: Rankovic was put in charge of the 
political commission and thus made effective 
head of the secretariat in Tito's absence, while 
Kardelj, though formally still a member of the 
secretariat, got no commission and is concen-
trating more and more on running the adminis-
tration and developing the organs of self-
government. 
Clearly, the intended division of labour is that 
while Kardelj, the ideologue, decentralises the 
administration, Rankovic, the disciplinarian, 
will re-centralise the Party whose power remains 
ultimately decisive. In practice however, things 
do not seem to work out wholly in accordance 
with this classical Leninist recipe. On one side, 
the tasks of the various self-government organs, 
from workers' councils through local communes 
and producers' councils to the parliaments of 
the national republics, are now so varied that it 
is practically impossible for the Party leadership 
to give its members in these various organs con-
crete directives on more than the broadest issues; 
on the other hand, decisions must be taken in 
the lightofthe local situation, and that means?
even with  Party members?in the light of local 
and regional interests. The Party regime does 
not remain untouched by the growth of a decen-
tralised society. 
A L L this limits the authority of the top leader-
ship, and that limitation may also prove 
effective in the question of Tito's succession. 
It is not a question of personal rivalry: Kardelj, 
the obvious alternative to Rankovic within the 
present inner ring, would from all accounts be 
perfectly content to continue as No. 2 man after 
Tito's death?which may anyhow still be a long 
way off. The trouble comes from below: the 
idea of Rankovic as policy-making leader does 
not seem to catch on with the party cadres, at 
any rate not outside Serbia. He rarely speaks in 
other parts of the country and is not regarded 
as a unifying national figure. He has not lost 
the odour of the police, and he represents a 
conservative outlook whose supporters by now 
are probably in a minority in the Central Com-
mittee, and certainly in a minority lower down. 
And while formerly the fact of Tito's personal 
confidence could easily have silenced all these 
doubts, Tito's own authority within the Party 
is, after the unhappy adventure with Khruschev, 
no longer as absolute as it used to be: it is still 
amply sufficient for the "old man" to carry on, 
but he will have to pay some heed to trends of 
opinion within the Party, and he may no longer 
be strong enough to commit its future by pick-
ing his own successor. 
For the future belongs to the new post-war 
generation, which for the first time appeared in 
numbers at the recent Party congress; and that 
generation seems in Communist Yugoslavia as 
much less ideologically-minded than their elders 
as in Western Europe. Having grown up during 
the years of conflict with Russia and gradual 
relaxation at home, most of them seem to have 
felt as uncomfortable during the pro-Soviet 
episode as the older reformers, but?at least 
partly?for different reasons: their criticism 
attacks the whole illusion of "Yugocentrism," of 
trying to influence world history from their 
small and still comparatively poor country; and 
while they strongly disapprove of a policy which 
risked the loss of Western confidence and aid 
in an attempt to wrestle for the soul of Khrush-
chev, they do not see much sense either in losing 
Soviet aid because of an ideological programme 
'outlining alternative roads to socialism. They 
would like to concentrate on cultivating their 
?own garden, without permitting anybody to in-
terfere but also without pursuing a grandiose 
dream of Yugoslavia's international mission. 
They believe that a cautious and modest neutral-
ity which does not unfold any flags but seeks 
friends wherever possible is what best befits a 
small Balkan nation, and that a slow but steady 
expansion of internal freedom will be best for 
a snulti-national country with a bitter history of 
civil war and revolution. And eventually they 
will have their way.
