Rural Control in an 
Insurgency: An Analytic 
Framework Applied to 
Guatemala and the Philippines 
The ability of national governments to gain or maintain control of rural 
communities is a key factor in dealing with Third World insurgencies. On 
the basis of comparative research on insurgency and counterinsurgency 
throughout the Third World, we conclude that rural control by government 
or insurgents hinges on three basic factors: 
� Attitudinal. The capability to promote favorable attitudes among the 
local population and elicit support. 
� Organizational. The capability to establish and direct local organiza-
tions�such as village administrative and governing structures, agricul-
tural cooperatives, political parties and propaganda theater groups�for 
mobilizing people politically and economically. 
� Military. The capability to protect cadre and supporters from attacks 
and provide the local population with security. 
Insurgency movements typically place more weight on attitudinal and 
organizational factors than do governments involved in counterinsurgency. 
Moreover, governments frequently choose inappropriate programs to fight 
rural insurgencies. To identify the range of programs used by governments, 
we examined some 90 insurgency and counterinsurgency efforts since 
World War II. From these cases, we have identified approximately nine 
that governments may occasionally use. This record also shows which 
programs were most successful and the conditions that contributed to their 
success or failure. We have also formulated a system of indicators to 
evaluate the effectiveness of an insurgency or counterinsurgency program. 
We believe that the programs and the indicators we have identified 
constitute a useful framework for analyzing rural insurgencies and coun-
terinsurgency. This framework and the record from which it was drawn are 
described in section one of this paper. Section two applies the framework to 
the insurgencies in the Western Highlands of Guatemala and in the 
Philippines. On the basis of these case studies, we reached the following 
judgments: 
� Guatemalan Counterinsurgency Is Working. During the past 18 months 
the government has regained or maintained control over much of the 
Western Highlands. Although the insurgents continue hit-and-run am-
bushes, they have been routed in many localities and have suffered a 
major loss of popular support. The government's control programs�most 
notably the Civil Defense Forces, which involve the Indian communities 
in armed self-defense of their villages�have successfully promoted

favorable attitudes at the local level, in organizing local people, and in 
providing them and government cadres with military security, despite 
inadequate financing, personnel, and equipment. Some of the gains 
achieved by the deposed Rios Montt, however, are being jeopardized by 
the resurgence of death squads and Mejia's neglect of propaganda and 
political measures to gain popular support. 
� Government Control Is Gradually Deteriorating in the Philippines. The 
Marcos government has failed to counter the growing Communist 
insurgency despite its military campaigns and well-publicized develop-
ment programs. The Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's 
Army controls 18 percent of the rural villages in the Philippines, a 
substantial increase over the past 18 months. Manila's political, econom-
ic, and military programs look good on paper but are poorly implemented 
in the countryside and receive insufficient political and material support. 
Local officials are unable or unwilling to effect the changes necessary to 
offset insurgent gains. Military abuses continue to alienate the rural 
population. In addition, military officers�using tactics ill suited for 
counterguerrilla operations�are unable to achieve a military victory.

Preface This study is one of a number of assessments done in the Directorate of 
Intelligence on the issue of Third World insurgencies. Each of these reports 
focuses on a key aspect in determining the success or failure of insurgent or 
counterinsurgent efforts. This study on rural control draws on classified material, 
unclassified external contracts commissioned by the Directorate of Intelligence, as 
well as fieldwork by Agency analysts.

Rural Control in an 
Insurgency: An Analytic 
Framework Applied to 
Guatemala and the Philippines 
Framework for Analysis 
Counterinsurgency specialists agree that insurgencies 
are won or lost in the countryside. Even the strongest 
urban guerrilla movements�from the Hungarian pa-
triots of 1956 to the Uruguayan Tupamaros of the 
1970s�ultimately fail if they do'not spread effective-
ly to rural areas. Similarly, as Mao, Castro, and 
others have shown, an insurgency can be won while all 
major cities remain in government hands. Govern-
ments recognize this, and over the years they have 
devised a number of surprisingly similar programs to 
defeat rural insurgency. What proves successful under 
one set of circumstances, however, may fail miserably 
at another time and place. This paper attempts to 
describe why this happens and to establish some 
guidelines for effective rural control in an insurgency. 
We also set up criteria for measuring the control 
exercised by governments or insurgents, and we apply 
both the guidelines and the measurement criteria to 
ongoing insurgencies in Guatemala and the Philip-
pines 
Programs for Rural Control 
An examination of some 90 examples sinee World 
War II reveals that insurgencies in rural areas inev-
itably aim at undermining the perceived legitimacy of 
the government through: 
� Reduction or elimination of government administra-
tion, security, and economic control. 
� Establishment of insurgent administration, security, 
and economic control alongside or in place of that of 
the government. 
� Competition with the government in providing or 
promising services to the rural population. 
Government counterinsurgency programs succeed or 
fail to the extent that they thwart the guerrilla 
strategy. 
We have identified nine categories of programs that 
governments consistently use in dealing with rural 
insurgency. These include political and administrative 
1 
programs, local security programs, and population 
and resources control programs aimed at maintaining 
government presence in the countryside; intelligence, 
military, and terror programs aimed at the insurgent's 
shadow government and military organization; and 
public welfare, economic, and propaganda programs 
aimed at winning the "hearts  and minds" of the rural 
population 
Political and Administrative 
Political and administrative programs that contribute 
to rural control can be divided into two types: those 
aimed at the entire nation, such as national elections 
and timetables for independence, and those aimed at 
specific rural areas such as the appointment of popu-
lar and honest local officials. Both types of pr 
have had their share of successes and failures 
(b)(3) 
(b)(3) 
(b)(3) 
Nationwide Measures. The key to success with regard 
to national measures is the perceived fairness and (b)(3) 
effectiveness of the measures. National elections, for 
example, are useful only if the population believes 
that the range of choice represents its interests and 
that its votes will be properly counted. Successful 
counterinsurgencies have stressed the importance of 
meeting popular calls for political reform. In Malaya, 
for example, the British increased Chinese and Malay 
participation in the colonial government and set a 
timetable for independence, which undercut insurgent 
demands for a war of national liberation. In the 
Philippines, Defense Minister Magsaysay turned pub-
lic opinion against the Huk insurgents by moving 
decisively to ensure honest presidential elections in 
1951 and to punish corrupt government officials and 
abusive military personnel. He stationed teachers as 
polling clerks, used ROTC cadets to guard polling 
places, and directed soldiers to protect voters and 
ballot boxes.

The failure of government to meet local demands for 
political reform fuels rural support for insurgent 
movements. The French in Indochina were aware of 
social tensions, inequalities, and a rising tide of 
nationalism but reacted to demonstrations and upris-
ings with repression. Although Paris apparently rec-
ognized the need for reforms, it confined its actions to 
the economic and social spheres and neglected the 
political area. The outbreak of World War II further 
curtailed political freedom, exacerbating all attempts 
at reform. Algerian nationalist aspirations and de-
mands for political reform were stifled in a manner 
similar to that in Indochina. Under the Vichy regime, 
which came to power after the fall of France in 1940, 
the Muslim community lost many of the small bene-
fits acquired over the years. French settlers, by com-
parison, were given a free hand 
Local Measures. Government administrative and po-
litical programs aimed directly at individual rural 
populations face a number of difficulties. One of the 
ironies is that the insurgents and the government 
frequently start on almost equal footing, at least in 
some rural areas. In some instances, the central 
government has never exercised firm control in these 
areas, leaving a vacuum for the guerrillas to fill. Such 
control as exists may be in the hands of tribal leaders, 
local landlords, or underpaid and largely forgotten 
public officials. These "administrators"�whether ap-
pointed or elected�often have little regard for the 
interests of the local population and few resources to 
deal with its problems even if they were so inclined. 
They are easy targets for elimination or co-optation, 
by insurgents. In countries where the central govern-
ment's bureaucracy is well established in rural ar-
eas�even if it is not popular�no vacuum exists and 
it is difficult for guerrillas to get started. 
In the early 1970s, guerrillas in the Western High-
lands of Guatemala were able to begin organizing the 
Indian population because the national government 
never had an effective permanent presence in most of 
the region. A similar situation has occurred in rural 
Columbia where many areas are isolated from Bogota 
and effectively ruled by local landlords. In El Salva-
dor the insurgents at first concentrated their efforts in 
areas weakly controlled by San Salvador, such as 
Chalatenango and Morazan, but soon expanded their 
areas of operation with appeals to the rural population 
to call for distribution of land to the peasants and 
removal of corrupt and abusive local officials. In 
contrast, no such power vacuums existed in rural 
Argentina and Uruguay, and consequently insurgent 
groups were never able to  gain a permanent foothold 
in rural areas 
Local Security 
Local security programs�those designed to protect 
government supporters in a rural area without major 
use of the central government's armed forces�gener-
ally rely either on the creation of civilian self-defense 
forces or on relocation of rural populations to more 
secure areas. Fortified villages can be an important 
adjunct to either type of program. The first type has 
generally been more effective than the second, if only 
because it is attempted only by governments relativel 
sure of the basic loyalty of their rural population. 
Civilian Self-Defense. Civilian self-defense programs 
have been most effective when they have been: super-
vised by on-the-scene military officers, adequately 
equipped, representative of the entire able-bodied 
male population of the village on a part-time basis, 
free of local political or economic influences unrelated 
to counterinsurgency, and instrumental in bringing 
some nonsecuritv as well as security advantages to the 
village. 
Numerous counterinsurgencies have effectively used 
local irregular self-defense forces for security. Such 
forces provide a first line of defense against guerrilla 
attacks, freeing regular military forces for offensive 
operations. More importantly, they commit village 
families conspicuously to the side of the government. 
In Malaya, the British and Malayans recruited ap-
proximately 150,000 Home Guards to protect reset-
tled villages, thus forcing a commitment from their 
Chinese inhabitants. Initially, unarmed and untrusted 
by the police, the Home Guard evolved into the 
primary government security force, protecting the 
rural Chinese population from the guerrillas. Home 
Guard units attached to neighboring Army units 
greatly aided the latter through their familiarity with 
the local terrain and society.

The British also effectively used local defense forces 
in Kenya to isolate the Mau Mau from its rural 
Kikuyu supporters. In South Vietnam, self-defense 
forces were effective only when adequately supported 
by local Army commanders and when formed by the 
villagers themselves. At times, the regular military 
was unwilling to provide adequate weapons, training, 
and backup forces to villagers it viewed as having 
questionable loyalty to the government. This resulted 
in morale-damaging losses by village defense forces in 
encounters with better equipped local guerrillas, or 
when they were overrun by regular insurgent forces 
because of a lack of government force backup. In 
Thailand, a successful village self-defense program 
has been an important element in controlling the 
Communist insurgency. Volunteer Defense Compa-
nies provide full-time auxiliaries, who patrol with the 
provincial police, act as part-time militia in areas of 
significant insurgent activity, and generally obtain the 
commitment of local farmers to the government. 
In contrast to these successes, the Burmese experience 
shows that the government must closely supervise 
village defense forces to maintain control. During the 
1960s and early 1970s, the Burmese Government gave 
militia status to several ethnic groups and to a few 
warlords operating in the Shan states, a region always 
weakly controlled by the Rangoon government. The 
militia was to provide local security against the 
Burmese Communist Party. Instead, these groups 
used Rangoon's arms to fight for control of narcotics 
smuggling routes and territory. 
Village Relocation. The success of relocation pro-
grams depends almost entirely on cooperation on the 
part of the villagers being relocated. This, in turn, 
depends upon: the perceived danger of staying where 
they are, the adequacy of the new location, the 
sensitivity to particular village concerns, and the 
adequacy of logistic support. In general, programs of 
village relocation to fortified villages or areas remote 
from insurgent influence have seldom enhanced local 
security. In Malaya, one of the few successful cases, 
the British effort to relocate rural Chinese into several 
hundred New Villages probably worked only because 
they were superior to the squalid, squatter camps 
where the Chinese had been living 
3 
Most other relocation programs failed. British reset-
tlement and village housing programs in Kenya were 
inadequately supported, caused much suffering and 
bitterness, and produced a substantial number of 
recruits for the Mau Mau. During their occupation of 
Malaya in World War II, Japanese troops forced one-
fourth of the Chinese population out of the towns and 
cities and "settled" them along roads on the fringes of 
the jungle. These "squatters" became the principal 
supporters of the Malayan Communist Party in resist-
ance against the Japanese, and, later, against the 
British colonial government. In Manchuria such Japa-
nese tactics also failed to stem the insurgency. To 
break up the close relationship between the Chinese 
population and the Communist guerrillas, the Japa-
nese relocated the population into newly constructed 
"collective hamlets." By 1937 there were more than 
10,000 of these hamlets, accommodating 5.5 million 
persons. The program succeeded in isolating the guer-
rillas, but the brutality with which the Japanese 
troops executed the program increased popular sup-
port for the guerrillas.

In those rural parts of Algeria strongly influenced by 
insurgents, the French resorted to resettlement. The 
French Army forcibly uprooted and resettled hun-
dreds of thousands of Algerians in the Constantine 
and Blida regions into more than 1,000 new villages. 
The French Section Administrative Specialisee ad-
ministered these villages and provided security, edu-
cation, and training in self-defense. The French plan 
called for the Algerians ultimately to form their own (b)(3) 
administrations. In practice, however, many of the 
villages were little better than concentration camps 
imprisoning sullen and uncooperative Algerians and, 
thus, on balance detracted from the French effort. In 
South Vietnam the government relocated thousands 
from areas under strong Vietcong influence, hoping to 
deprive the enemy of its population base. The reloca-
tion camps were often on marginal land that provided 
little chance for cultivation or other forms of employ-
ment. Embittered farmers frequently migrated back 
to their ancestral lands and accepted Vietcong protec-
tion. Those who remained in the camps were a major 
resource drain on the 7overnment and provided many 
recruits to the enemy. (b)(3)

Population and Resource Control 
Closely related to the local security programs are 
programs designed specifically to deny insurgents any 
' cooperation�voluntary or forced�from the rural 
population. These programs, although inconvenient 
for the local population, are among the most success-
ful in combating insurgency. They include: 
� Strict screening and documentation procedures. 
� Cordon and search operations. 
� Roadblocks and checkpoints. 
� Curfews. 
� Control of movement of both people and materiel. 
� Rationing. 
� Protection of the rural production from seizure or 
taxation by insurgents. 
These programs tend to fail when they are loosely and 
haphazardly enforced and therefore easily avoided, 
when they are exploited by soldiers or policemen, or 
when they are so harshly enforced that loyal citizens 
perceive them as unnecessary hardships. 
The British perfected these control techniques in 
Malaya and Kenya. Applied later in Cyprus and 
Aden, such programs again succeeded in their narrow 
objectives but could not compensate for widespread 
popular support for the insurgents. The Indian Gov-
ernment has also succeeded in isolating guerrillas 
from their base of support in its counterinsurgency 
effort against the Mizo National Front (MNF), a 
tribal separatist group. Villages in Mizo areas are 
fortified and under Army control. Villagers are issued 
identity cards and are counted twice a day by an 
Army representative in each village; no one is allowed 
to enter or leave the villages by night. Unable to 
operate or hide in the villages, the MNF has been 
forced to turn to towns and regional cities where it is 
possible to avoid arrest by mixing with the generally 
sympathetic local population. At times, MNF troops 
have also sought sanctuary in adjoining areas of 
Bangladesh 
Vietnam is a good example of improperly implement-
ed population control. For example, checkpoints were 
often used by Vietnamese Army and Regional Forces 
units to extort goods from merchants carrying food or 
other commodities to or between markets. In many 
instances, the checkpoints were permanently located 
and thus routinely avoided by Vietcong smugglers. 
Even when checkpoints were mobile, they were often 
poorly implemented; outlying security being insuffi-
cient could not prevent their being avoided by insur-
gent smugglers who could see them from a distance. 
In some provinces, the government had better execut-
ed control programs, such as screening and document-
ing of the population. These too suffered, however, 
because their effectiveness�for example, identifica-
tion of undocumented individuals�depended on the 
quality of implementation of related programs, such 
as checkpoints and intelligence recordkeeping, that 
were not as effective. 
Indigenous police organizations, if adequately staffed, 
trained, equipped, and motivated, are best suited to 
enforce population- and resource-control programs. 
Police, unlike regular military units, whose members 
are drawn from diverse parts of the country, are 
frequently locals. They are more likely to understand 
local conditions and be regarded by the population as 
a government organization with enforcement powers. 
They are often better trained than military forces in 
the investigative skills required for these operations 
because the procedures resemble anticrime proce-
dures. 
Intelligence and Counterintelligence 
To root out the insurgent cadre network and destroy 
their shadow government, the central government 
must develop effective local intelligence collection, 
analysis, and exploitation programs. At the same 
time, the government must uncover the often effective 
intelligence systems of the guerrillas. Governments 
often ignore this necessary task because they lack 
adequate resources for the job or because they believe 
such intelligence is trivial. Successful programs are 
usually characterized by an effective village-level 
intelligence collection effort against the insurgent 
organization that provides security for government 
supporters in villages and support for timely villa e-
level military operations against the insurgents 
 �and, as a consequence, one step 
ahead of the insurgents militarily�during the deter-
minative years of the Huk rebellion. In Rhodesia, the 
4

Approved for Release: 2020/01/21 C05462027 
Selous Scouts�trained to live undetected for extend-
ed periods in known areas of enemy activity and to 
radio back intelligence�provided tactical military 
intelligence on insurgency that was used successfully 
to ambush and attack numerous insurgent bands. 
They also used pseudoguerrilla tactics�scouts imper-
sonated guerrillas for extended periods�to gather 
political intelligence in the villages. Such units dem-
onstrate an effective alternative to placing agents or 
informers in villages when the local population is 
unwilling to cooperate with the government. 
Unsuccessful programs, in contrast, are characterized 
by poor coordination and cooperation between govern-
ment intelligence collection agencies, overreliance on 
single-source reporting, and often unfounded opti-
mism. For example, the French in Indochina had a 
total force of about 500,000 troops, the security of 
operating from firm bases, and complete mastery of 
air operations. Yet their failure to match Vietminh 
capabilities to develop or exploit intelligence in the 
villages puts them at a fatal disadvantage. During 
World War lithe Vietminh organization had gradu-
ally supplanted the colonial government in many parts 
of Vietnam, and the French were never able to 
reestablish their internal security apparatus. Intelli-
gence estimates of Vietminh capabilities were poor 
and frequently ignored by overconfident commanders. 
While they were able to develop an effective infor-
mant network in Algiers, the French failed to develop 
adequate intelligence in rural Algeria, impeding mili-
tary operations there. In the case of insurgencies 
against British control, widespread popular support 
for or fear of the insurgents obviated good political or 
tactical intelligence in Cyprus, Aden, and Palestine. 
The victorious National Organization of Cypriot 
Fighters (EOKA) guerrillas in Cyprus were far more 
effective than the British in collecting and exploiting 
intelligence in remote villages; the insurgents usually 
knew in advance the exact nature of British military 
operations. 
Military Operations 
Military operations remain at the center of any 
counterinsurgency effort not only to seek and destroy 
insurgent military forces but also�and more impor-
tantly�to protect government supporters and the 
general population. The secret of successful military 
operations appears to be properly tailoring capabilities 
to the particular threat. In the early stages of most 
insurgencies, this means using small units deployed in 
villages and aggressively seeking contact with the 
enemy by day and by night. Small units that are 
properly trained, highly motivated, supported by vil-
lagers, and familiar with local terrain generally have 
not needed and have not sought artillery or airstrikes 
that could injure the local population. Large-scale 
operations are appropriate only in the later stages of 
an insurgency when large insurgent units operate 
conventionally to attack government-held areas or to 
defend their own bases. 
Small units stationed in rural areas and backed by 
quick-reaction battalions are the best means for pro-
viding security for government supporters and pro-
grams and impeding the insurgent political and mili-
tary organizing efforts. It was clear in almost every 
insurgency studied that this is best accomplished by 
an emphasis on mobile rather than a static defense�
patrolling the surrounding areas day and night, set-
ting ambushes, and reacting offensively to insurgent 
sightings. In South Vietnam, the US Marine Corps 
used small, well-trained platoons of volunteers from 
regular Marine infantry units called "CAP Teams" 
(combined action platoons) who lived in Vietnamese 
villages and worked with local self-defense forces to 
provide security. Stationed for months in the same 
village, the members of these units knew the people 
and the terrain well and were able to obtain detailed 
and timely intelligence on the local insurgent organi-
zation. They were thus able to deny the insurgents 
freedom to operate. 
Village-level forces must be supported by large unit 
reaction forces, particularly if the insurgents can mass 
local forces or move larger forces from other areas to 
attack villages. In the absence of such reaction forces, 
villagers will be reluctant to take the risks inherent in 
joining in village defense and in supporting forces 
stationed in the village. In South Vietnam, hamlets 
defended by small, government units were often locat-
ed in contested areas where reaction forces had 
Approved for Release: 2020/01/21 C05462027 
Approved for Release: 2020/01/21 C05462027 
difficulty supporting them. This made these hamlets 
especially vulnerable to insurgent attacks. The insur-
gents were quick to exploit this lack of adequate 
security by overrunning the settlements, thereby dem-
onstrating to peasants the futility of supporting gov-
ernment forces. 
Defensive military tactics are seldom effective against 
insurgencies in rural areas during the guerrilla-war-
fare stage. Initial Portuguese reaction to guerrilla 
activity in their African colonies, for example, was 
defensive�aimed at protecting key installations and 
lines of communication with garrisons�and ceded 
control of many rural areas to the insurgents. Troops 
withdrew into defended outposts, relying upon air 
attacks and only occasional patrolling. All initiative 
lay with the insurgents. This tactic led to years of 
virtually unimpeded insurgent political and military 
organizing in rural villages. In Indochina, French 
military efforts against the Vietminh for years relied 
primarily on the defense of key positions 
Highly mobile regular units operating against insur-
gent strongholds are a necessary adjunct to village 
defense measures, particularly if insurgents maintain 
military base areas. Constant, aggressive strikes by 
small, specially trained units can also be a partial 
solution to the problem of insurgent-base areas. In 
rural Algeria, the French sent carefully chosen units 
of 60 to 80 men, known as commandos de chasse, into 
the mountains moving on foot and at night, carrying 
out surprise attacks, and unexpectedly arriving in 
villages to run to earth the FLN guerrillas. During the 
late 1960s, the US military in South Vietnam effec-
tively used similar strike teams�independent units of 
from five to 18 men sent into enemy-controlled terri-
tory for several days at a time to harass and trail the 
enemy. According to Vietcong who surrendered, guer-
rilla units greatly feared such tactics because�with 
their ability to lay successful ambushes and call 
airstrikes without warning�strike teams inflicted 
heavy casualties and greatly impeded guerrilla opera-
tions 
Public Welfare 
Public welfare programs are successful in combating 
insurgency only when they are well designed, well 
funded, maintained over an extended period, and 
desired by the people they are to benefit. It is in this 
last area that they most often fail. Programs to 
improve living conditions in rural villages�for exam-
ple, providing schools, health clinics, clean water, and 
electricity�have been important adjuncts to most 
successful counterinsurgency campaigns. These ef-
forts demonstrate government concern over local con-
ditions and a capability to improve them. Such pro-
grams can effectively counter insurgent claims that 
the government benefits only the rich by involving the 
rural population in public works and self-help projects 
that directly benefit them: 
� During the 1960s, the Guatemalan Army, with US 
backing, undertook a large-scale welfare program�
including the building of wells�in rural areas 
affected by guerrilla activity. Even one of the 
Army's leading critics admitted that this program 
played an important role in the government's ability 
to maintain rural control. 
� In contrast, President Somoza's diversion of relief 
funds to Somoza-controlled businesses following the 
1972 earthquake in Nicaragua and his government's 
failure to address the population's needs for housing 
heightened resentment among the population for his 
government and increased supoort for the Sandinis-
ta insurgents 
Typically, insurgents initially organize and operate in 
rural areas neglected by the central government. Here 
they can exploit longstanding government apathy, and 
the weak government presence gives them free rein. 
Public welfare projects that the villagers want, and in 
which they voluntarily participate, emphasize govern-
ment concern and provide a means by which people 
can be enticed into visibly committing themselves to 
support the government. Such programs have been 
effective in countering insurgencies in Cambodia, 
Guatemala, Venezuela, and Thailand. In Thailand, 
the government improved the administration of public 
welfare projects by using local people to manage 
them 
When public welfare programs flounder, they do so 
because of a lack of extended commitment, because 
they are ill conceived, or because they are not wanted.

For example, the Vietnamese countryside was dotted 
with poorly situated and unused marketplaces and the 
remnants of other projects built by US and Vietnam-
ese military and civilian programs without sufficient 
study or local inquiry about the need for such projects. 
Many projects stood unfinished because of insuffi-
cient funds and diverted resources�a frequent corre-
late of Third World public works programs. Still other 
projects, such as many schools and dispensaries, al-
though finished, lacked funding for routine mainte-
nance. Many of these shortcomings were avoided in 
successful public works programs by involving local 
residents in the planning, creation, maintenance, and 
management of the project. 
Economic 
Government economic programs, such as land reform, 
can encourage villagers to maintain the status quo. 
They must, however, be established early and imple-
mented vigorously. Any redistributive economic re-
forms can create enemies as well as friends for the 
government. The redistribution of church lands by the 
Shah of Iran, for example, was a major factor in 
alienating the powerful Shiite clergy. Other govern-
ments have found that measures taken to benefit the 
rural economy, such as crop support prices, may 
alienate the urban poor. 
Despite the potential benefits, government economic 
development programs are frequently underempha-
sized�or ignored�as a counterinsurgency strategy 
until it is too late. By the time the Portuguese 
initiated a massive effort to enhance Mozambique's 
agrarian economy through farm improvements and 
roadbuilding, the insurgents had already gained the 
upper hand. In contrast, the British in Kenya elimi-
nated popular support for the Mau Mau by coupling 
the introduction of black majority rule with agrarian 
reform and the establishment of a minimum wage. All 
these programs encouraged villagers to maintain the 
status quo 
As with public-welfare programs, effective security 
must precede economic programs, which generally 
lead to improvements in physical infrastructure. 
Without adequate security, improved facilities would 
be destroyed or used by the insurgents. Economic 
7 
programs were effective in Venezuela and Malaya in 
increasing popular support for the counterinsurgency: 
� The Venezuelan Government defeated rural insur-
gents in the 1960s partially with progressive eco-
nomic programs begun in 1958�land reform and 
crop subsidies�financed by revenues from petro-
leum. These programs, even though predating the 
insurgency, played a key role in undercutting the 
propaganda of the extreme left that claimed govern-
ment indifference and a lack of rural benefits from 
oil. 
� In Malaya government prestige rose as a variety of (b)(3) 
measures improved the standard of living: farm 
loans and other agricultural-support measures; reg-
ulation of poor working conditions, work hours, and 
moneylending practices; the encouragement of con-
sumer and producer cooperatives; and the growth of 
labor unions. 
The Cubans in Ethiopia have used a limited economic 
program to gain popular support for the status quo. 
According to a Western Somali Liberation Front 
guerrilla, they have allowed the local population to 
use the Djibouti�Addis Ababa railroad which they 
protect without charge. This has given the local 
residents a stake in its operation, making attacking it 
more difficult 
Propaganda 
Government propaganda is most successful when it is 
based on truth and addresses real concerns of the 
rural population. It can be as vital as armed action in 
determining who wins: 
(b)(3) 
(b)(3) 
� The Thai Government has had considerable success 
depicting the Communist insurgents as outsiders, 
foreign to Thai customs and culture. This image, 
coupled with publicity concerning the foreign sup-
port the insurgents receive, has diminished their (b)(3) 
appeal to the Thai population. 
Approved for Release: 2020/01/21 C05462027 
Approved for Release: 2020/01/21 C05462027 
� In contrast, the isolated and repressive Somoza 
government in the latter stages of the insurgency 
was easy prey for the highly effective Sandinista 
propagandists who successfully exploited domestic 
and international antipathy for the Somoza dicta-
torship. The Sandinistas were especially adept in 
associating, in the popular mind, their guerrilla 
movement with Cesar Agusto Sandino's original 
guerrilla war against the US Marines 
At the local level, propaganda programs may be 
directed at the insurgents, at the civilian population, 
or at government employees. Propaganda directed at 
the insurgents is intended to create dissension, dis-
organization, low morale, subversion, and defection. 
Directed at the civilian population, it attempts to gain, 
preserve, and strengthen civilian support for the gov-
ernment. Propaganda directed at government cadre 
and supporters is designed to build and maintain 
morale. Although effective propaganda programs 
must be tailored to local conditions, and because these 
conditions may vary widely, they are most effective 
when coordinated at the national level. Coordination 
at this level helps avoid conflicting themes and pro-
grams in different areas and maintains consistency 
with internationally targeted propaganda 
Government propaganda efforts aimed at encouraging 
civilian support for the government have played an 
important role in most successful rural counterinsur-
gencies. The most successful programs address local 
grievances while avoiding themes that conflict with 
programs elsewhere: 
� Magsaysay convincingly addressed the longstanding 
grievances of the peasants of Central Luzon in the 
Philippines through propaganda that promised more 
than was ever delivered. His well-coordinated pro-
paganda program stressed the need for agrarian 
reform, an end to military abuses of peasants, and 
the evils of Communist rule in Asian agrarian 
societies. 
� In the late 1950s the Cameroon Government�with 
French assistance�undermined the popular base of 
support for the Cameroon People's Union (UPC) 
insurgency through a well-focused psychological 
and propaganda effort that was more effective than 
military operations. Progovernment literature was 
widely distributed in insurgent areas, and both 
important government officials and former rebel 
leaders, who had turned to the government, made 
tours addressing village groups and promising par-
dons to insurgents and their supporters. 
� In South Vietnam, however, the size of the Ameri-
can-run propaganda effort, the constant turnover in 
American personnel, and the lack of time for sys-
tematic planning led to numerous "psychological" 
operations programs with overlapping and some-
times contradictory objectives and responsibilities. 
The plethora of such programs�often hastily 
planned by Vietnamese and Americans unfamiliar 
with local grievances�limited the effectiveness of 
the propaganda. 
Where propaganda themes are not at least partially 
based in truth, the rural population is unlikely to rally 
to the side of the government. In Cuba and later in 
Nicaragua, government propaganda programs were 
no match for those of the insurgents because the 
realities or perceptions of government behavior, as 
compared with government promises, were too con-
trary to governMent.wpmises to be believable. The 
brutality of the Batista government and economic 
inequities within the society offset government propa-
ganda promising the Cuban peasants relief. Sandinis-
ta propaganda�particularly that accusing President 
Somoza of stealing from the poor of Managua and 
from foreign relief funds intended for the victims of 
the 1972 earthquake�was believed by most Nicara-
guans, despite much government propaganda to the 
contrary. 
Terror 
Terror is most effective when used selectively. Al-
though both governments and insurgents have used 
terror successfully, insurgents have often done so 
more effectively. Government-sponsored terror has 
most often failed to coerce popular rural support for 
counterinsurgent forces because it has been indis-
criminate�killing the innocents as well as the insur-
gent supporters�excessive, too public, and poorly 
planned and executed. In contrast, insurgents have

Approved for Release: 2020/01/21 C05462027 
"--S'receL, 
been successful more often in using terror because 
they have been selective and publicized it only to the 
extent necessary to affect a target population. They 
usually use it only against clear allies of the govern-
ment to attain specific political and military psycho-
logical objectives such as  demoralization of a particu-
lar sector of government. 
Successful insurgents clearly attenuate and control 
terror so as not to drive the general population or 
international community to support the government. 
The Vietcong used terror selectively to undermine the 
morale of government organizations and to force 
people to support the National Liberation Front. To 
do this, the Vietcong carefully compiled blacklists of 
government personnel and supporters who were tar-
geted for assassination or, after the Communists 
gained control of an area, for punishment. In Commu-
nist-controlled and in contested areas, public execu-
tions were preceded by trials in "People's Courts" 
that demonstrated the "justice" and the power of the 
Vietcong. In all of these cases, the Communists were 
discriminate and maintained an appearance of justice. 
Government-sponsored terror has failed, or even dam-
aged counterinsurgent efforts in Algeria, Afghani-
stan, Cuba, Nicaragua, East Pakistan, and Rhodesia: 
� In Algeria, the scorched earth policy of French 
paratroopers was well publicized and skillfully ex-
ploited by insurgent propaganda. 
� The harsh treatment of Miskito Indians in Nicara-
gua�including forced evacuation and possible air-
strikes against remote villages suspected of aiding 
insurgents�has recently driven many previously 
indifferent Indians to join anti-Sandinista insurgent 
groups. 
� In Zimbabwe government-sanctioned killings 
among the rural civilian population in Matabeleland 
have strengthened resentment among the Ndebele 
minority and have persuaded former ZAPU guerril-
las incorporated into the national  Army to join the 
insurgents. 
Of the various examples of successful government-
sponsored terror, Guatemala and Argentina are nota-
ble for their thoroughness in killing most insurgents 
and their supporters. In the late 1960s, the Guatema-
lan Army established, or at least tacitly supported, 
several terrorist death squads that engaged in relative-
ly indiscriminate killing. These irregular forces exter-
minated anyone they suspected of supporting the 
guerrillas. Similarly, the Argentine paramilitary tor-
tured and killed anyone remotely suspected of sup-
porting the Montoneros and the People's Revolution-
ary Army (ERP), thereby decimating the 
insurgent-support network. In both cases, the govern-
ment maintained some distance from the terrorism by 
using death squads or by operating covertly and 
suppressing press reports. Also, in both cases much of 
the population was indifferent  to the olieht of tlifse 
victimized by the government.  
� The brutal actions of shortsighted Pakistani military 
men in East Pakistan during 1971 drove even pro-
Pakistani Bengalis to the Mukti Bihani guerrillas. 
� In Cuba, the middle and upper classes eventually 
abandoned Batista's regime and reluctantly sup-
ported Castro as the wave of murder and repression 
spread to their families. 
� In Afghanistan, Soviet scorched earth tactics have 
still proved counterproductive. An Afghan 
officer reported in early 1983 that Soviet and 
government efforts to win the allegiance of rural 
civilians continue to be undermined by indiscrimi-
nate attacks on villages.

Measuring Rural Control 
The ability to measure or assess change in govern-
ment or insurgent control of rural areas is an impor-
tant element in counterinsurgency efforts. Without 
reliable assessments the appropriate counterinsurgent 
strategy or tactics may not be adopted in time. 
Beyond this, it is important for analysts following an 
individual insurgency to be able to monitor insurgent 
or counterinsurgent progress. 
Quantitative indicators such as the number of govern-
ment public works projects or the number of guerrillas 
killed in action are frequently proposed for measuring 
rural control. Such quantitative indicators, however, 
can signify very different things and, when considered 
by themselves, may be very misleading. To some 
analysts, increasing numbers of insurgent combat 
casualties may reflect growing guerrilla strength and 
greater willingness to engage in sustained battles 
using larger units; to others it may reflect insurgent 
weakness and greater vulnerability to government 
military operations. 
Nonquantitative data have been used and criticized 
for being overly subjective and anecdotal. For in-
stance, the friendly greeting of soldiers to a rural 
village may be motivated by genuine support for the 
government, or by fear of Army reprisals and the 
desire to appear cooperative to avoid repression. Only 
an observer who understands the local community 
well could accurately determine which of these moti-
vations predominates 
Weaknesses in intelligence collection further compli-
cate the analytic problem. In general, the Third 
World nations�as well as Western nations observing 
them�do not have an apparatus for systematically 
gathering data at the local level in countries experi-
encing rural insurgencies. This is particularly true 
with the attitudes of peasants toward governments 
and guerrillas and the status of insurgent organization 
in specific areas. The lack of analytic understanding 
or suitable data to assess insurgent and government 
control has led to numerous errors in tracking past 
insurgencies (figure 1). 
11 
We have identified seven basic indicators to deter-
mine who controls a rural area in an insurgency�the 
government or the insurgents. The accompanying 
sample questions help measure the strength and direc-
tion of the indicator. Which questions should be asked 
to measure each indicator will depend on local condi-
tions and available data. These indicators focus exclu-
sively on the local rural level, that is, on villages, or, in 
the case of a dispersed settlement pattern, on group-
ings of peasants who consider themselves residents of 
a specific rural locality. The indicators exclude factors 
at the national level that may have a major influence 
on government or insurgent capability to acquire rural 
control. Such factors include foreign assistance to the 
government or the insurgents, the strength of nation-
al-level leadership, national economic trends, and 
unrest in the capital city. In keeping with our view of 
the interrelated determinants of control, we attempt 
no ordering of indicators by relative importance. The 
relationship of these indicators and determinants to 
the government programs discussed above is shown in 
figure 2. (b)(3)

Indicators of Rural Control 
Attitudinal 
Favorable attitudes among the local populace: 
� Is the rural population highly receptive to govern-
ment/insurgent propaganda? 
� Are acts of government repression/guerrilla terror-
ism perceived locally as indiscriminate or 
discriminate? 
� Do government/guerrilla combat operations have 
exclusively military goals? Or, do combat opera-
tions consider the psychological and political im-
pact on the local population? 
� Are there government/insurgent policies that the 
peasants feel are particularly unfair? 
Ability to motivate individuals to take high risks: 
� Are local government officials/guerrilla leaders 
drawn mainly from the local population?

Guatemala Case Study 
Guatemala's national government�both under Gen-
eral Rios Montt and his successor General Mejia 
Victores�has maintained or regained control over 
much of the Western Highlands. For several years 
before the intensified and innovative government 
counterinsurgency campaign was initiated in 1982, 
the predominantly Indian Western Highlands had 
been the scene of a growing guerrilla movement, 
stepped-up attacks on the Army, and expanding insur-
gent control over population and territory (figure 3). 
Since the summer of 1982, however, the insurgents 
have been routed in many localities and have suffered 
a major loss of popular support; they retain only a few 
isolated strongholds. Some of the gains achieved by 
the deposed Rios Montt, however, are being jeopard-
ized by Mejia's reluctance to crack down on the 
resurgence of death squads and by his neglect of 
propaganda and political measures to gain popular 
support. The effectiveness of the government's coun-
terinsurgency programs is summarized in figure 4.

Political and Administrative 
When Guatemala City began to systematically rees-
tablish control over extensive, contested areas in the 
Western Highlands, it set out not only to reestablish 
security but also to forge new political links with rural 
communities. Rios Montt's reformist officers believed 
that the historically low level of Indian participation 
in national political institutions had created a political 
vacuum filled by insurgent organizations. National-
government neglect also was considered a major 
factor. Guerrilla assassinations or intimidation of 
local authorities complicated the control task, but the 
reformist officers were perceptive enough not to 
blame the abandonment of local governments solely 
on guerrilla violence 
As the first step in creating new political institutions 
and modifying old ones, the Rios Montt regime 
created local subcoordinadora councils in contested 
areas, incorporating some of the personnel and func-
tions of traditional municipal councils. Chaired by the 
local military commander, the subcoordinadoras con-
sisted of appointed or elected representatives of all 
15 
301382 1-84 
important interest groups in the community, ranging 
from agricultural cooperatives to religious associa-
tions. Local CDF leaders were included, as were 
representatives of government agencies active in the 
community. The councils dealt with diverse issues 
concerning the community and with requests for 
outside assistance. The latter were ultimately chan-
neled to a national council that was also  chaired by 
the military. 
On the basis of interviews we conducted in Quiche 
Department, we believe this new network successfully 
bypassed the redtape and delays of the traditional 
bureaucracy. It appeared that technical, financial, 
and material aid from Guatemala City to rural 
communities was disbursed with relative speed and 
efficiency. We do not know, however, whether the 
subcoordinadoras functioned throughout the Western 
Highlands. Moreover, it is unclear whether or not the

Mejia regime intends to maintain this administrative 
innovation or return to the traditional municipal 
system. The creation of Army civic-action companies 
suggests that the new government intends to uphold 
the previous commitment to public-welfare improve-
ments in the Highlands, but the government's deterio-
rating financial capabilities�worsened by the recent 
US aid suspension�constitute major obstacles 
In addition, Rios Montt created a National Council of 
State partly to further the impression that the local 
population had a voice in the capital city and partici-
pated in the national decisionmaking process. This 30-
member consultative body included representatives�
approved by the national government�of the agricul-
tural, industrial, academic, and labor sectors, as well 
as of the Western Highlands Indians. Ten members 
were Indians elected primarily because of their high 
standing within their communities. Their presence in 
Guatemala City and statements to the media gave 
greater visibility to Indians in the national govern-
ment than ever before. Indian council members pub-
licly expressed concern when the newly installed 
Mejia regime began to consider abolishing the council 
in response to rightist political party pressure 
When Mejia did abolish the council, however, there 
were no widespread Indian protests. Nonetheless, we 
believe that this measure was a major blow to the 
national government's efforts to establish political 
links with Indian communities. Indian leaders them-
selves have stated repeatedly that the political party 
system that Mejia intends to reinstate has never 
served as an adequate vehicle for Indian aspirations. 
Given Rios Montt's extensive propaganda efforts 
highlighting Indian participation in the National 
Council of State, it is reasonable to assume that 
Mejia's elimination of that body will result in less 
credibility for future national-government initiatives 
of this type. 
Some Indian activists are attempting to accommodate 
themselves to these recent political changes by allying 
themselves with the Social Christian Party�and cer-
tain other newly formed parties. In terms of rural 
control, however, this development is far less favor-
able to the government than the previous situation 
where the government-sponsored Council of State 
served as the principal forum for the expression of 
17 
Indian grievances. Should assassinations against So-
cial Christians and other opposition parties resume�
as under Lucas�the result most probably will be 
heightened polarization. 
Local Security 
Village Self-Defense. During the latter part of the 
Lucas administration (1978-82), the Army concluded 
that it lacked the manpower and logistic support 
necessary to continuously protect the dispersed popu-
lation of the Western Highlands. Turning to the 
historic tradition of civilian militias, the Army began 
to arm and train progovernment civilians in certain 
communities. However, this remained a small-scale 
undertaking, limited by the mutual distrust of the 
authorities and the rural population in contested areas 
and the Army's fear that guns distributed in isolated  
communities could fall into guerrilla hands 
(b)(3) 
Rios Montt succeeded in overcoming much mutual 
distrust by curbing Army abuses of civilians, provid-
ing benefits to rural communities and incorporating 
local men into the counterinsurgency campaign. In 
contrast to the situation under the Lucas regime, the 
civilian militias�the CDF�became a key aspect of (b)(3) 
the counterinsurgency program, expanding rapidly 
throughout the Western Highlands, to include about 
350,000 local men. The new regime of General Mejia 
has announced that it will strengthen the program, 
now estimated to include about 500,000 men. Guerril-
la reprisals against communities collaborating with 
the Army in organizing the CDF have not deterred 
the growth of this local self-defense program. On the 
contrary, guerrilla attacks against CDF men and their 
families apparently have fostered popular antipathy 
for the insurgents.  
The organization and activities of local CDF units 
vary greatly depending on their isolation, the guerrilla 
threat, and the degree of popular support for the 
national government in their communities. In the Ixil 
towns, for example, these units are relatively well 
armed and have fought periodically with guerrilla 
units

certain areas involves the CDF, not regular Army 
troops. In contrast, the CDF in many other towns 
patrol with machetes and have never fought the 
guerrillas 
CDF functions include: 
o Protecting rural communities and towns through 
patrols day and night. 
o Deterring infiltration of insurgents into 
communities. 
o Gathering intelligence for the Army on guerrilla 
activities. 
o Controlling movement of civilians by identifying 
and questioning strangers. 
o Participating in joint military operations with regu-
lar Army units pursuing guerrillas in the 
countryside. 
o Accompanying civilians to fields and other work-
places outside towns to protect them from guerrilla 
reprisals and proselytizing. 
The CDF program has been so successful that some 
military officers state that the Army is merely sup-
porting these groups in winning the counterinsur-
gency. They argue that the CDF advantage lies in the 
militiamen's knowledge of the local terrain, trails and 
populace, and in their personal stake in protecting 
their own communities. 
Despite the success of the past year, various problems 
threaten CDF effectiveness. US Embassy reporting 
indicates that the CDF has become involved in a few 
local disputes between communities or individuals 
over land boundaries or other issues unrelated to 
counterinsurgency. Abuses of power by some CDF 
members have also been reported, and it is evident 
that in some areas local men are coerced into joining 
the CDF. Certain leaders of peasant and labor unions 
have complained to the US Embassy of CDF persecu-
tion, raising the possibility, that the CDF may become 
simply another government-sponsored paramilitary 
group to suppress agitators. Recently, members of a 
CDF unit admitted to a US diplomat that they killed 
a number of suspected subversives 
These problems could jeopardize CDF effectiveness 
should they become widespread. Given Guatemala's 
experience with civilian militias, the CDF command-
ers could become local strongmen. This possibility, as 
well as. potential CDF participation in political party 
struggles, could create antipathy in the local popula-
tion toward the government, as occurred under the 
corrupt administration of General Lucas. The Rios

Montt government recognized these problems and 
intended, through the reorganization of the armed 
forces, to exert greater control over the military and 
political activities of the local CDF. We have no 
evidence, however, that this has been accomplished, 
and it appears that Army control over the CDF is no 
greater now than it was under Rios Montt. 
Relocation. The government faces another security 
problem�the displacement of people in the High-
lands because of guerrilla warfare and military efforts 
to suppress it. In the Ixil territory and certain other 
areas, the Army during the Rios Montt regime relo-
cated people to government-controlled towns as a 
partial solution to the problem of guerrilla control 
over isolated areas. The Army preferred voluntary 
resettlement but, during the height of the fighting in 
the summer of 1982, reportedly used coercion includ-
ing the burning of villages. At the same time, the 
guerrillas coerced villagers to abandon their villages 
and relocate in more remote insurgent strongholds. 
Most Indian refugees interviewed indicated that they 
preferred to seek government protection because the 
insurgents could not adequately feed and shelter 
masses of people in their strongholds. As a result, 
large refugee camps developed in Nebaj, Choatalum, 
and Chisec, with smaller concentrations of refugees 
19 
(b)(3) 
scattered throughout the rest of the Highlands. Dur-
ing 1983, estimates of the total number of displaced 
persons in the Western Highlands ranged from 50,000 
to 300,000 (b)(3) 
Although the government achieved its short-term goal 
of removing people from insurgent control, it incurred 
a heavy financial burden and, because of the steady (b)(3) 
deterioration of the national economy, had increasing 
difficulty sustaining the relocated people. Moreover, 
the influx of families to progovernment communities 
placed a serious economic and demographic strain on 
those localities. In Choatalum, for example, an esti-
mated 5,000 Indians threatened by starvation de-
scended on that small village from the surrounding 
mountains; only rapid Army relief efforts averted a 
crisis. Because of the financial and logistic problems 
in feeding and sheltering masses of refugees, Guate-
mala City's strategy has been to return them to their 
homes as soon as possible after the area has been 
cleared of guerrillas. According to the US Ambassa-
dor, resettlement has been accomplished in Choata-
lum and Chisec. Although the national government 
sielyckL 
Approved for Release: 2020/01/21 C05462027 
Approved for Release: 2020/01/21 C05462027 
apparently has avoided a potentially major crisis, if 
fighting escalates, masses of Indians will again de-
scend on Highland towns and Guatemala City will not 
have the resources to care for them 
Population and Resource Control 
The CDF is one of the national government's princi-
pal instruments for controlling local population and 
resources. CDF patrols and checkpoints monitor the 
movements of community residents and strangers, and 
the registration for CDF duty is a check on the 
whereabouts of the militiamen. Moreover, giving 
prominence to local men in policing the community�
thus downplaying the role of the regular Army�helps 
reduce local resentment against the authorities. The 
CDF also plays a key role in keeping the roads open 
and discouraging guerrilla roadblocks or attacks on 
traffic. Journalists and State Department personnel 
traveling through the Western Highlands have been 
impressed by the frequency of CDF checkpoints. 
Before the expansion of the CDF program, the guer-
rillas had closed some roads and had made travel 
unsafe in the Western Highlands. These breaks in the 
transportation system disrupted local commerce and 
aroused considerable popular antagonism toward the 
insurgents. Although insurgents can still close traffic 
in certain areas, government efforts in keeping the 
roads open are gaining local good will. The few men 
at each checkpoint cannot stop a determined guerrilla 
assault, but they can provide surveillance and, if 
nothing else, give an impression of government pres-
ence in isolated rural areas. 
Intelligence and Counterintelligence 
Increased intelligence from the local population of the 
Western Highlands paralleled Rios Montt's improve-
ments in military relations with local Indians and 
government efforts to curb abuses of the civilian 
population. In general, the Rios Montt regime created 
a trust between the military and the civilian popula-
tion that was absent during the Lucas regime. This 
was possible partly because of Guatemala City's 
demonstrated determination to maintain a permanent 
political and military presence in Highland communi-
ties and its integration of local men into its security 
apparatus through the CDF. These actions led many  
Indians to the government side 
The amnesty program led to many insurgent defec-
tions, and these defectors greatly increased the mili-
tary's pool of information on the enemy. Amnesty was 
part of a broad government effort to reduce repression 
and use voluntary inducements to support the govern-
ment. The government also improved intelligence by 
emphasizing more humane interrogation of captured 
guerrillas and by other efforts to gain their long-term 
cooperation. The situation under Mejia is similar, but 
the resurgence of death squads may jeopardize the 
trust established by Rios Montt between the authori-
ties and the people. 
 institutional rivalry will 
probably continue to hamper coordination at both the 
national and local level. 
Military Operations 
In the last year of the Lucas regime, the Army 
responded to increasing insurgent strength in the 
Western Highlands byliighly mobile, large sweeps in 
areas where guerrillas were believed to be concentrat-
ed. However, the guerrillas generally did not stand 
and fight. These tactics resulted in death for large 
numbers of civilians, and their effectiveness is diffi-
cult to judge. Rios Montt made important modifica-
tions in tactics by focusing on the following main 
points: 
� Military units were stationed in the principal popu-
lation centers to end guerrilla occupations, execu-
tions of government supporters, and propaganda 
rallies. 
� Small-unit tactics were emphasized using patrol 
bases in the mountains and aggressive patrolling by 
soldiers. 
� Large-scale sweeps were undertaken in areas where 
there were reports of guerrilla camps or concentra-
tions of guerrillas. 
Defense of towns when the garrison was out operat-
ing, or standing down, was increasingly left to the 
local residents through the CDF, thus freeing the 
regular units to pursue guerrillas in the mountains.

Figure 7. Guatemala: Army of 
ficer reassures an isolated Indi-
an community that the govern-

security 
We believe this strategy was successful in protecting 
government supporters, while destroying or harassing 
guerrilla bands. Once bold enough to attack and 
overrun departmental capitals and military garrisons, 
the guerrillas scaled down their operations significant-
ly and largely confined themselves to hit-and-run 
ambushes of military vehicles and to attacks on 
isolated communities protected only by the smaller 
CDF forces. After the August coup against Rios 
Montt, counterinsurgency operations initially slowed 
down, but Mejia seems to be following the basic 
strategy of his predecessor. The military advantage 
clearly remains in the hands of the government, but 
the guerrillas are gradually increasing their attacks. 
The success of the Rios Montt military strategy was 
facilitated in part by the mobilization of 5,000 addi-
tional soldiers on short notice for an emergency six-
month tour of duty. The government intended to 
restrict this group to veteran reservists, but, in prac-
tice, it also accepted new volunteers, who often proved 
to be unexpectedly effective. In each of the three 
major Ixil towns, for example, a full company of local 
Indians was recruited, trained, and armed. These 
companies proved to be very capable because, like the 
CDF, the local men knew the local terrain and people 
much better than regular troops brought in from other 
21 
regions. The salaries paid and the Army's trust shown 
by providing them with weapons normally used only 
by regulars apparently greatly increased Ixil good will 
for the government. 
To preserve the gains of the Rios Montt counterinsur-
gency campaign, the armed forces are undergoing a 
fundamental reorganization geared toward increasing 
effectiveness in local military operations. For exam-
ple, the government has divided eight military zones 
into 22 zones. Although we believe that the reorgani-
zation ultimately will benefit counterinsurgency at the 
local level, it probably will seriously strain military 
manpower and logistic resources over the short term. 
Public Welfare 
The government has focused its public-welfare pro-
grams in the Western Highlands on two sectors of the 
population: the residents of the major population 
centers and the refugees or defectors from insurgent-
controlled areas. Following Rios Montt's admonition 
that victory in counterinsurgency consists not in kill-
ing guerrillas but in killing the hunger of the peasants, 
the subcoordinadora councils accelerated public 
---SvefeL,

works and facilitated outside help to rural communi-
ties. By building and staffing health clinics, construct-
ing roads and wells, and completing other types of 
public works projects, the national government sought 
to demonstrate that it could effectively provide bene-
fits at the local level 
In dealing with the refugee population, we believe 
that the Rios Montt regime demonstrated willingness 
and effectiveness in meeting the food, housing, health, 
and employment needs of the refugees. General Mejia 
apparently intends to maintain the effort. We see such 
government actions as a key in the loss of popular 
support for the insurgency and in the Indian migra-
tion to government towns. The present national eco-
nomic deterioration, however, threatens the govern-
ment's financial capability to sustain relief efforts, 
and some observers conclude that public-welfare pro-
grams�both under Rios Montt and Mejia�have 
been effective only in some localities, not throughout 
the Highlands. Moreover, the recent suspension of US 
assistance�to protest the murders of Guatemalan 
AID employees�further hampers the ability of the 
Mejia regime to implement public-welfare programs. 
Economic 
Compared with programs having a more immediate 
and direct impact on counterinsurgency, the Mejia 
regime has assigned a low priority to economic devel-
opment. The national economic downturn in Guate-
mala necessitates defining strict priorities in allocat-
ing scarce resources. Although counterinsurgency 
planners recognize the potential link between econom-
ic development and support for government, Guate-
mala City does not have the resources to systematical-
ly implement an economic development program in 
the Western Highlands. However, by organizing and 
financing diverse public works projects, the govern-
ment itself has become a major employer in some 
Highland communities and a major source of income. 
Propaganda 
Guatemala City's domestic propaganda efforts be-
came more effective after the military coup that 
brought Rios Montt to power. Rios Montt himself was 
a boon to government propaganda because he project-
ed an image of honesty, reform, and nationalism. His 
image contrasted greatly with the brutal and corrupt 
reputation of Lucas and his clique. The major themes 
in the new propaganda campaigns were: 
� The national government and the Army express 
solidarity with the Maya Indian heritage. 
� The Army protects the Guatemalan people and 
plays a positive, key role in local and national 
development. 
� Guatemalan guerrillas commit atrocities and do not 
represent popular aspirations. 
� The government is fighting alone and thus is more 
genuinely nationalistic than the Guatemalan guer-
rillas who are supported and manipulated by 
foreigners. 
� The best way to further local economic and political 
aspirations is to support the national government. 
In contrast to Rios Montt, Mejia has not given a high 
priority to public relations. Mejia does not enjoy the 
popular image Rios Montt enjoyed, nor is Mejia likely 
to emulate his predecessor's personal involvement in 
propaganda. Although we expect official propaganda 
to follow nationalistic lines similar to those of the 
previous regime, we believe that the various measures 
by the present administration will seriously undercut 
the potential appeal of populist propaganda. The 
elimination of the National Council of State�with its 
highly publicized Indian participation�has not been 
followed by any credible countermeasures conveying 
government desire to forge links with Indian commu-
nities. In their public statements, the top authorities 
of the new government are not employing the populist 
rhetoric that enhanced Rios Montt's propaganda pro-
grams. 
Government propaganda efforts, moreover, are seri-
ously hampered by the lack of trained personnel, 
financing, organization, and planning for systematic 
dissemination of propaganda in the countryside. Fre-
quently, Indians living in isolated villages hear the 
progovernment message only when a periodic patrol 
arrives and the commanding officer gives a speech 
translated into the local dialect. The government does 
not have a permanent cadre of propagandists living or 
traveling in the countryside; the CDF fulfills that role 
only in certain areas.

"t.ece 
Terror 
We believe that the Rios Montt regime's use of terror 
at the local level discouraged support for the insurgen-
cy without alienating masses of people. Indiscriminate 
terror by the Lucas regime was one of the main 
reasons for the 1982 coup, as well as for the growing 
antipathy for the authorities in the Western High-
lands civilian population. Although Rios Montt re-
nounced the blatant human rights abuses characteris-
tic of his predecessor, terror was a successful�albeit 
decreasing�element of his counterinsurgency cam-
paign, particularly during the summer of 1982. Terror 
clearly hurt Guatemala City's international relations 
and seriously complicated its efforts to obtain foreign 
aid. Nonetheless, our judgment is that local people in 
the Western Highlands came to view the wrath of the 
security forces as being directed primarily at the 
guerrillas themselves or those guilty of supporting the 
guerrillas. The key to this change in popular percep-
tion apparently was the regime's concern to sharply 
focus terrorist repression. The use of terror, moreover, 
was counterbalanced with blandishments and induce-
ments to voluntarily support the government. During 
1982, for example, the same Army that burned 
villages to convey to the local population the high cost 
of supporting the insurgency also offered protection 
and a guarantee of livelihood to those who relocated 
to a government-held town. This carrot and stick 
strategy effectively countered the guerrillas' own use 
of terror 
Because the guerrillas and soldiers both used terror, 
terror was not a distinguishing factor between the two 
adversaries in the eyes of the local populace. What 
distinguished them were other behavior and pro-
grams; these differences were the central failure of 
the insurgency. The peasants perceived the Army as 
increasingly willing and able to provide security and 
material benefits; the guerrillas provided neither. 
Immediately after the military coup against Rios 
Montt, the military's use of terror remained low. 
However, recent US Embassy and press reporting 
indicates that terrorism controlled or tolerated by the 
Mejia regime is on the upswing. Rural and urban 
victims are "disappearing" again, including US AID 
bilingual program employees. Press reports indicate 
that the monthly death toll is gradually rising since 
Mejia took power. Embassy reports of conversations 
with rural inhabitants reveal a growing fear that a 
23 
major escalation of indiscriminate repression is in the

occur, but the fear itself will not  help the government 
cause 
Indicators of Government and Insurgent Rural Control 
Guatemala's rural control programs generally have 
furthered the goals of the government's counterinsur-
gency campaign. Although the guerrillas continue 
successful hit-and-run ambushes, our attitudinal, or-
ganizational, and military indicators suggest that the 
national government has far greater capabilities for 
exerting local control than the insurgents. The rela-
tively enlightened reforms and goals of the counterin-
surgency campaign initiated by Rios Montt could be 
undermined, however, if current budgetary pressures 
force Guatemala City to draw back from projecting a 
strong presence, particularly in the remote areas of 
the Western Highlands. 
Attitudinal 
Favorable Attitudes Among the Local Population. We 
believe that most Western Highlands Indians feel 
they were badly treated and deceived by the guerrillas 
and that they are being better treated by the govern-
ment. Our conclusions are based on interviews with 
Indians who had formerly supported the insurgents or 
had lived under insurgent control�accounts con-
firmed by more recent interviews by journalists as 
well as by US Embassy reporting. Having fruitlessly 
suffered for supporting the insurgency, many Indians 
have developed a strong antipathy for the insurgents 
and their propaganda�a striking change from the 
situation in 1981-82 when the insurgent cause seemed 
to enjoy greater popularity than the government's. 
The population's attitude changed rapidly because the 
insurgents failed to deliver promised security and 
material benefits to followers. Moreover, as govern-
ment pressure intensified, the insurgents increased 
demands for food and services from the local popula-
tion, thus promoting the perception that the insur-
gents' program was unfair and unreasonable.

The Rios Montt government increased good will by 
putting emphasis on avoiding indiscriminate repres-
sion and on local psychological and political consider-
ations in planning combat operations. Although iso-
lated repression continued, press and US Embassy 
reports suggested that most Indians came to view the 
Army as more discriminative in its use of force. We 
do not know of any government program that is 
viewed by the Highlands Indians today as particularly 
unfair to them. Our judgments on the attitudes of 
Highlands Indians, however, are based on fragmen-
tary evidence; we lack systematic attitudinal surveys 
or regular reports from informed local observers. 
Furthermore, the recent increase in political violence 
may jeopardize the generally favorable attitudes to-
ward the government. 
Ability To Motivate Individuals To Take High Risks. 
Active, highly motivated insurgents are much less in 
evidence today in the Western Highlands than during 
the height of the insurgency in 1981-82. During that 
period they made themselves felt not only in the 
greater effectiveness of military operations against 
government forces but also in gains in recruiting and 
organizing local people. Their activity and effective-
ness against the government has significantly de-
clined. We do not know, however, the number of 
cadre that existed then or how many were subsequent-
ly killed, fled, or simply ceased revolutionary activity. 
We assume decreased activity reflects decreased num-
bers, but there is a chance that the insurgents could 
be still strong and lying low awaiting a change in the 
political climate 
According to a variety of sources, the Guerrilla Army 
of the Poor (EGP) made a major effort in past years to 
recruit and train local leaders and combatants; conse-
quently, we assume that surviving EGP bands include 
a majority of local people. By contrast, the other two 
guerrilla organizations, the Revolutionary Organiza-
tion of the People in Arms (ORPA) and the Rebel 
Armed Forces (FAR), do not seem to be following a 
strategy of community-based guerrilla bands. 
out Guatemala City's directives, and, with the excep-
tion of regular Army officers, most of the authorities 
in a locality are men from that same locality or 
region. This reliance on local leadership has enhanced 
efforts to mobilize and organize people. The unprece-
dented expansion of the locally based Civilian Defense 
Forces�now encompassing an estimated 500,000 
men�signifies that a relatively high percentage of the 
male population of the Western Highlands is openly 
committed to the government. Notwithstanding re-
ported CDF frustration over lack of significant Army 
tactical or logistic support in certain areas, various 
CDF units have repeatedly shown their commitment 
to the government by aggressively pursuing and at-
tacking guerrillas 
Organizational 
Ability To Mobilize and Organize People at the 
Local Level. Although scattered EGP guerrilla bands 
remain active in the Western Highlands, the govern-
ment's counterinsurgency campaign has destroyed the 
greater part of EGP capacity to mobilize and organize  
the rural population. 
In contrast to the insurgents' declining ability to 
motivate people, the government has made rapid and 
extensive gains in developing committed local cadre 
and supporters. The government is deliberately seek-
ing to develop a core of reliable local leaders to carry 
 in 
certain areas the EGP had earlier succeeded in mobi-
lizing and organizing people through the establish-
ment of Local Clandestine Committees (CCL). These 
committees generally functioned in the numerous, 
isolated communities where there was no government 
presence or where government representatives lacked 
effective administrative or coercive power. The insur-
gents often used coercion to organize local people, and 
many Indians mobilized by the CCL were forced into 
the cause. When the government counterinsurgency 
campaign weakened the insurgents' coercive power, 
this involuntary organization of the Indian peasantry 
unraveled in most localities. Now the EGP is severely 
limited in its ability to mobilize and organize people. 
(ORPA and FAR are not as affected because tradi-
tionally their reliance on a local support  base has been 
far less than the EGP.) 
Through the CDF and enhancement of local govern-
ment effectiveness, Guatemala City has successfully 
mobilized Indians in communities formerly dominat-
ed by the EGP. The Mejia regime is attempting to

replicate this success throughout the Western High-
lands; however, we do not know how much hidden 
resentment remains among Indians who have experi-
enced government coercion, or the threat of it. None-
theless, we believe, on the basis of observations, as 
well as US Embassy reporting, that the majority of 
the Indians participating in government programs see 
benefits in doing so and that, overall in the Western 
Highlands, far greater willingness exists to participate 
voluntarily in government programs than in those of 
the insurgents. 
Ability To Provide Material Benefits to Supporters. 
Membership in insurgent organizations, whether as 
an armed militant or a supporter, seems to provide 
little or no benefits; nonetheless, some militants may 
continue to believe that time is on their side and that 
the insurgency will regain momentum. We have re-
ports that some guerrilla units receive salaries, but 
this information has not been corroborated. Given the 
low fortunes of the guerrilla bands at present, we 
doubt that they have the resources to offer regular 
salaries. The insurgents clearly failed to fulfill their 
promises of material benefits to local communities; 
rather, the guerrillas disrupted the transportation and 
commerce that the Highland Indians depend on for 
their livelihood. The guerrillas also proved unable to 
fulfill their promises to protect their Indian follow rs 
from violent government reprisals. 
Although Guatemala City also is strapped for finan-
cial resources, it has implemented public works and 
the CDF programs that benefit the Indians. The 
public works programs directly benefit local workers 
by providing them with salaries or food. These pro-
grams have evidently gained good will for the govern-
ment in the Ixil Triangle and probably in other areas. 
The CDF program that encompasses most of the 
Western Highlands does not include the payment of 
salaries. However, by keeping roads open and protect-
ing residents and visitors in Highland communities, 
the CDF militiamen have played a key role in reviving 
local and regional commerce. The economic impact of 
the CDF is even more direct in those communities 
where the CDF has allowed workers to return to the 
fields safe from guerrilla kidnapings or assaults. In 
interviews with CDF members, some dissatisfaction 
was displayed over certain delays in Guatemala City's 
response to community requests for assistance. The 
25 
majority of Indians, however, believe Guatemala City 
is better able than the insurgents to provide benefits to 
its supporters. 
(b)(3) 
Ability To Exploit Local Resources. In early 1982, 
the EGP controlled manpower, agriculture, and other 
resources in several large areas, but now the EGP only 
controls the resources of a few, remote strongholds. 
ORPA and FAR have acquired large but undeter-
mined sums of money through extortion, but they 
exert little control over resources in the countryside. (b)(3) 
Guatemala City, on the other hand, has undisputed 
control over resources in most of the Western High-
lands�a capability it has reinforced by the large-
scale mobilization of local manpower through the 
CDF, administrative reforms, and a greater military 
presence in previously isolated communities. Both 
local, military, and civil authorities seem flexible in 
implementing the directives of the national govern-
ment and are adapting them to local conditions. The 
guerrillas, however, also  are flexible in implementing 
orders at the local areas (b)(3) 
Military 
Ability To Protect Supporters and Local Organiza-
tions. The failure of the guerrillas to protect their own 
supporters�admitted in captured documents and cor-
roborated by interviews with former supporters�is a 
key factor in the widespread loss of support for the (b)(3) 
insurgency in the Western Highlands. The guerrillas' 
campaign of increasing ambushes of Army troops was 
premature because they overestimated their political 
and military abilities. As a result, we believe that 
active insurgent cadre now live primarily in a few 
insurgent strongholds in the mountains where they 
can better protect supporters. We have virtually no 
reliable information on the number of insurgent cadre 
residing or operating in local communities outside 
these strongholds, but we assume that it is small. 
Guerrilla bands now appear to be viewed in most   
Indian communities as unwelcome troublemakers. (b)(3) 
The government has generally protected its support-
ers. An important indicator of security is that local 
officials usually sleep in their own communities or in 
those communities where they are assigned. The 
population in general views the CDF as an effective 
Approved for Release: 2020/01/21 C05462027

source of protection from insurgents, a perception 
fostered partly by the fact that CDF duty usually is a 
rotational assignment served by all able-bodied men 
of the locality. However, the guerrillas have killed 
CDF members and their families. While these massa-
cres certainly have not promoted support for the 
insurgency, they have impressed upon the rural popu-
lation that the insurgents remain a force to be reck-
oned with, notwithstanding government successes. 
Regular Army forces, in contrast, are overcoming 
their reputation for indiscriminate repression. A lack 
of helicopters and the transportation and communica-
tions problems caused by the rugged mountains and 
equipment shortages sometimes prevent national 
Army "reaction forces" from responding quickly to 
guerrilla attacks on local CDF or progovernment 
communities 
Military and Intelligence Effectiveness. The insur-
gents' military and intelligence capabilities have de-
clined considerably, compared with the government 
security forces. At the height of their power, the 
guerrillas had an extensive and effective intelligence 
network at the local level. In light of the drastic loss of 
support among the populace and the government's 
success in establishing control over Highland commu-
nities, we believe that this intelligence network has 
been seriously damaged 
Government intelligence, on the other hand, has 
improved considerably, owing to the emphasis placed 
on improving relations between the Army and civil-
ians and on incorporating local people into the strug-
gle against the guerrillas. Militarily, both the regular 
Army and the CDF stress small-unit tactics and are 
aggressive in day and night patrolling. The level of 
military training received by the CDF typically is 
rudimentary, and consequently we would not expect 
them to perform proficiently in combat. We have no 
reports of major problems with CDF performance, 
however; the forces have only abandoned their weap-
ons or casualties when overwhelmed by vastly superior 
enemy forces. Some CDF units occasionally join 
regular Army forces in coordinated attacks on insur-
gent strongpoints. Army officers praise CDF partici-
pation in these operations because of their superior 
knowledge of local terrain. In contrast, insurgent 
forces have lost the ability to overrun provincial 
capitals, although small units continue successful 
ambushes and usually withdraw in good order with 
equipment and casualties.

Philippines Case Study' 
Philippine military officers have repeatedly warned 
US Embassy officials that, unless the civilian govern-
ment combats social problems and eliminates 'graft 
and corruption, the armed forces will never be able to 
eliminate the Communist Party of the Philippines/ 
New People's Army (CPP/NPA). Manila's widely 
publicized political, economic, and military programs 
have been ineffective, and local officials�beneficia-
ries of a well-entrenched system of political patronage 
based in Manila�are either unable or unwilling to 
effect any real change (see figure 8). Consequently, 
the government's civil and military rural control 
programs have failed to arrest, let alone reverse, the 
growth of the Communist insurgency, and the 
CPP/NPA now controls 18 percent of the rural 
villages in the Philippines. In addition, the Commu-
nists have increased by about 60 percent the number 
of rural barangays�the lowest level in the adminis-
trative hierarchy of government�fully under their 
influence (see figures 9 and 10). 
Counterinsurgency Programs 
Political and Administrative 
During its 18-year tenure, the Marcos regime has 
become excessively bureaucratic, inefficient, and 
largely incapable of exerting political and administra-
tive influence in many areas of the Philippines, partic-
ularly those where it is seriously challenged by the 
CPP/NPA. Although political change is needed, the 
regime seems intent on preventing any important 
sharing of either its political or economic monopoly. 
Despite his rhetoric, Marcos is relying principally on a 
military approach for defeating the Communists.

officials often will not visit villages under their juris-
diction. The legal system does not work. A regional 
judge from northern Mindanao told a US Embassy 
officer that few murder cases ever reach his court; 
most are blamed on the NPA, even though the NPA 
is responsible for only a fraction. Even where the 
government functions, it is often corrupt and ineffec-
tive. The Philippine Constabulary is strongly disliked 
because of its abusive behavior, public works officials 
are renowned for diverting funds from local projects, 
nd postal workers steal money orders and food 
mailed to rural residents. 
According to a reliable US Embassy source, in many 
of the most active insurgent areas�parts of Samar, 
Northern Luzon, the Bicol region, and Mindanao�
civil government administration has ceased. Local

clears the insurgent-affected areas of enemy armed 
groups through combined combat and civil-military 
operations. Next, the civil government agencies enter 
the area and deliver essential services. Then, the 
courts work toward redressing popular grievances. 
Finally, the civilian agencies establish a permanent 
sense of security and implement self-sufficient eco-
nomic projects to improve living standards. According 
to the US defense attache, this plan has failed because 
of the inability and unwillingness of civilian govern-
ment agencies to support a strategy designed by the 
military 
Local Security 
Village Self-Defense. Village self-defense forces have 
played an important role in Philippine counterinsur-
gency efforts ever since the 1950 campaign against 
the Huks, and they have evolved into an integral part 
of the government's current counterinsurgency cam-
paign. In the early 1970s the Constabulary armed 
these units and assigned them locally to work with 
five-man Constabulary detachments permanently sta-
tioned in villages. The self-defense units protected the 
village against insurgent attacks and, more important-
ly, detected and prevented attempts by insurgents to 
contact the village population. In 1974 the govern-
ment amalgamated these local defense forces into a  
national Civilian Home Defense Force (CHDF). 
The CHDF now comprises at least 47,000 men�
lightly armed civilians organized along military 
lines�who often operate jointly with regular Army or 
Constabulary units and serve as a buffer between 
local villagers and members of the armed forces 
drawn from other regions. The force, which sustained 
nearly as many combat casualties in 1982 as the 
regular armed forces, has allowed the Army in the 
south to redeploy battalions that have been fighting 
guerrillas for many years. 
Training and utilization of CHDF personnel varies 
markedly from region to region, and thus it is difficult 
to assess the overall effectiveness of the program. In 
Mindanao and Leyte, for example, the government 
has systematically developed local CHDF units, and 
they have increasingly assumed responsibility for 
counterinsurgency operations against both Muslim 
and Communist guerrillas. In these areas, CHDF 
groups are under special counterinsurgency unified 
29 
commands and are trained by Special Warfare Bri-
gade Teams. This frees regular Army and police units 
for rapid-reaction and civic-action roles. Elsewhere in 
the Philippines, however, many CHDF units led by 
the Army Reserve Command suffer from a lack of 
support from local Army commanders and have repu-
tations for poor discipline and abuse of their author-
ity. Some CHDF personnel sell their guns to the 
highest bidder, reportedly often the NPA 
Relocation. For several years Philippine security 
forces have attempted to protect the population of 
strongly contested areas from the insurgents by pres-
suring villagers to relocate in heavily guarded settle-
ments.' Military commanders inform residents in 
targeted villages suspected of supporting the NPA 
that they will be considered NPA sympathizers if they 
refuse to move into garrisoned and fortified areas. 
The garrison imposes curfews at night and treats the 
surrounding countryside as a free-fire zone. It fre-
quently requires relocated families to contribute "vol-
unteer guards" and to provide food for military 
detachments posted in the village. Catholic human 
rights investigators�linked by reliable US Embassy 
sources to the CPP/NPA but probably accurate in 
their assessment�report that by 1979 the govern-
ment had forcibly relocated more than 50,000 persons 
in Samar, and by 1982 more than 200,000 had been 
relocated in seven Mindanao provinces

(b)(3) 
The current relocation policy has, in our judgment, 
failed primarily because the military has not been 
able to provide these transplanted Filipinos with many 
of the basic necessities of life. Because of poor 
conditions in relocation sites and the lack of adequate 
logistic support, malnutrition, disease, and inadequate 
housing are common complaints. These difficulties 
provide ready-made propaganda for the insurgents.

Population and Resource Control 
In our estimation, the Philippine security forces have 
the apparatus to effectively control the population and 
to protect and control resources, but are thwarted in 
these endeavors by poor implementation and wide-
spread corruption. Military checkpoints, for example, 
are common throughout the Philippines but are badly 
administered, easily avoided, and frequently serve as 
extortion points for the military and police. The 
Constabulary and Integrated National Police, who 
should implement population- and resource-control 
programs, have a poor reputation and can elicit little 
cooperation in tracking insurgency. Local military 
units have imposed a protective curfew in many areas, 
particularly where they have relocated villagers, but 
the restriction irritates farmers who complain that 
there is not enough time to reach distant fields and 
markets. Should the insurgents alter their present 
avoidance strategy and begin to attack elements of the 
Philippine economy, the government's already defi-
cient security apparatus will be severely taxed. 
The government is moving on several fronts to deal 
with these village-level problems, but two of their 
major initiatives suffer from serious flaws. A plan 
calling for a minimum of two paid intelligence officers 
in each of the 43,000 barangays using the Ministry of 
Human Settlements as cover is overly ambitious and 
may never occur because of a lack of funding. The 
1984 intelligence operations budget for the Constabu-
lary�the principal collectors of intelligence on the 
insurgency�has been cut by 30 percent. The Army is 
organizing Regional Intelligence Coordinating Cen-
ters (RICC) intended to facilitate the collection, coor-
dination, and integration of intelligence in support of 
tactical operations, but military intelligence units 
consider themselves in competition, and commanders  
fear being upstaged by rival units.  
(b)(1) 
(b)(3). 
Intelligence and Counterintelligence 
Given the success of Philippine intelligence in captur-
ing high-level insurgent leaders, the government prob-
ably has an accurate view of the growth of the 
CPP/NPA organization. The government has identi-
fied most of the CPP/NPA's national and regional 
leadership, and well-placed agents provide a continu-
ing flow of information concerning its key decisions 
and strategic thinking. In 1982, 16 regional and 
national CPP/NPA leaders were captured or killed, 
and two surrendered. This record compares favor bl 
with that of past insurgencies worldwide 
The government has a serious problem, however, 
obtaining timely intelligence information at the vil-
lage level. According to US Embassy reporting from 
Northern Luzon and Mindanao, the NPA quickly 
finds and executes government informers, causing 
village populations to refrain from. passing tactical 
intelligence to local security forces. The military 
believes that in many rural areas the insurgents have 
established an efficient intelligence network to moni-
tor the movements of government forces 
President Marcos has 
criticized his intelligence chiefs for their failures at 
the grass-roots level and has complained that 60 to 70 
percent of the intelligence budget has been going into 
the pockets of military commanders instead of those 
of village-level agents and informers 
31 
Military Operations 
The Philippine Army and the Constabulary are inef-
fective in their approach to counterinsurgency mili-
tary tactics: 
(b)(3) 
 Constab- (b)(1) 
ulary units often establish fixed positions rather 
than conduct patrols and travel only on safe routes 
to avoid contact with the insurgents. Although they 
are expected to live off the land while searching for 
the guerrillas, members of the Constabulary fre-
quently steal what they need. This confiscation of 
supplies alienates the populace. 
� The Army conducts large unit sweeps using block-
ing forces to prevent guerrilla escape. Because such 
operations are difficult to organize secretly, the 
insurgents often have warning of the Army's activi-
ties, which allows them to avoid contact during the 
sweep and to return to swept areas after the Army 
has withdrawn to garrison. Most military units also 
avoid night operations thereby granting the insur-
gents a free hand for activities after dark.

In April 1983 the armed forces began a major 
reorganization designed to improve military opera-
tions against the insurgents, but subsequent attache 
reporting shows that only superficial bureaucratic 
changes are being made. The 13 Regional Com-
mands�formerly commanded by Constabulary offi-
cers�are reorganizing into Regional Unified Com-
mands (RUCs), ostensibly to improve command and 
control in each region. A new, highly trained elite 
reaction force�composed of approximately 21,000 
Army scout rangers, Navy seals, Marine quick reac-
tion forces, Air Force special warfare troops, and 
Constabulary forces retrained as scout rangers�is to 
provide support for the Unified Commands. In fact, 
however, both the Army and the Constabulary are 
only redesignating existing units as elite forces with 
minimal retraining. This eliminates one of the most 
important characteristics of such units�the selection 
of highly trained, motivated, and disciplined person-
nel 
Public Welfare 
The government has achieved few successes in its 
efforts to improve rural public welfare. In many areas 
government presence is lacking and only NPA person-
nel and missionaries serve the local residents. Projects 
aided by foreign governments, such as the Australian 
Government's roadbuilding program in Samar and 
the US-aided Bicol River Basin Project, may eventu-
ally improve the lot of some villagers, but they will 
have only a slight impact given the massive needs. 
Military civic-action units have made limited at-
tempts to fill the void created by the lack of welfare 
services in many remote villages 
an unarmed military medical team 
operating from 1979 to 1982 in NPA-controlled areas 
in the mountains of Northern Luzon, Samar, Leyte, 
and Northern Mindanao was successful in gaining the 
respect and gratitude of much of the population. Press 
reporting indicates that during 1982, Army medical 
and dental teams treated nearly 6,000 villagers in the

Economic 
The National Livelihood and Development (KKK) 
Program�announced with much fanfare in mid-1981 
as Manila's answer to poverty and Communist sub-
version�holds almost no promise of addressing the 
economic needs of the rural Philippines. Although the 
program is intended to spur economic and social 
development nationwide and help every village, town, 
and city attain economic self-sufficiency, the US 
Embassy feels that it is too modest in design to create 
sufficient change. Furthermore, the program is 
plagued by an overly centralized administration better 
known for politically attractive ideas than for results. 
The program operates through subsidized loans for 
small, labor-intensive agricultural, manufacturing, 
and service projects. The central government assists 
further by finding domestic and international markets 
for goods produced. Priority beneficiaries are sup-
posed to be those considered most susceptible to 
CPP/NPA propaganda�landless workers, upland 
farmers, ethnic minorities, and urban slumdwellers�
but they have received little benefit 
Propaganda 
For years the Philippine armed forces have singled out 
the large number of insurgents and their supporters 
who have supposedly surrendered as evidence of prog-
ress in defeating the insurgency. 
high-ranking Constabulary officers often arrange for 
large numbers of villagers to "surrender" to impress 
their superiors in Manila. Many of those who surren-
der are farmers merely suspected of being sympathet-
ic with the NPA, who receive a monetary reward for 
participating in the ploy. The officers who arrange the 
mass surrenders often receive commendations and, 
according to newspaper reports, may receive kick-
backs from the villagers. Such shams are part of the 
reason the Marcos government is losing the psycho-
logical war to the CPP/NPA in many rural areas of 
the Philippines. Cardinal Sin, leading spokesman for 
the Philippine Catholic Church, believes the govern-
ment has no credibility with the people, and 62

percent of Manila's top business leaders surveyed in a 
recent opinion poll rated the national government's 
credibility as poor 
The government's credibility is further weakened by 
the fact that development of the rural countryside�
frequently touted as a cornerstone of the Marcos 
government's policy�remains an unfulfilled promise 
nearly everywhere. The Communists are quick to 
exploit this failure for its propaganda value; coconut 
farmers are shown Manila newspapers with the latest 
commodity market quotations and asked to judge for 
themselves who benefits from the wide disparity 
between what they earn and the prices shown in the 
paper. A Philippine officer assigned to the Davao area 
recently told our Ambassador that many local offi-
cials in Mindanao believe Communist propaganda 
that accuses Marcos's cronies of exploiting local 
farmers in their foreign-financed agribusiness ven-
tures. In other areas, NPA-armed propaganda teams 
visit villages and turn the government's public rela-
tions efforts to their advantage; a government-distrib-
uted picture showing a newly built road is displayed to 
make the point that only the rich and middle class can 
afford the luxury of riding in the cars shown on the 
road 
Terror 
There is no systematic program to employ terror as a 
counterinsurgent tactic at the local level, but govern-
ment military and paramilitary units frequently resort 
to arbitrary and indiscriminate intimidation of the 
rural population. Arbitrary arrests, disappearances, 
torture, and summary executions attributable to the 
government are common.' Senior officers recognize 
that such terrorism is counterproductive and plays 
into the hands of insurgent propagandists but are 
either unable or unwilling to stop it. Government 
claims that military wrongdoers are increasingly be-
ing punished are contradicted by the light punishment 
' Task Force Detainees�a Catholic human rights group that is 
ontrolieo by c.ommunist cadre�
reports that curing a I -month period ending March 1983 there 
were 1,516 arbitrary arrests, 146 summary executions, and 42 
disappearances attributable to government forces. Such reports, 
whether true or inflated, are widely read and given much credence 
throughout the Philippines 
33 
given offenders�reassignment or dismissal. A prison 
sentence for military offenders is rare. We believe the 
government's counterproductive use of terror is one of 
the principal reasons for the growth of the Communist 
insurgency 
(b)(3) 
(b)(3) 
The government's reputation has been further tar-
nished by rumors and international press reports 
linking senior government officials with the deliberate 
creation of paramilitary terror groups. Reliable US 
Embassy sources state that senior Constabulary offi-
cials recruited armed forces officers and enlisted 
personnel for such a group�The Lost Command�in 
February 1973. The original concept was a small, 
hard-hitting commando group that could operate se-
cretly and with minimal command and control to 
neutralize Muslim and Communist insurgent groups 
in Northern Mindanao and Samar. However, these 
commandos soon became accustomed to the absence 
of constraints. In September 1981, 35 civilians, in-
cluding women and children, were massacred by The 
Lost Command operating jointly with local CHDF 
forces in Barrio Sag-od in Northern Samar in retalia-
tion for an NPA attack on a logging company owned 
by Defense Minister Enrile. Today, The Lost Com-
mand has several subordinate units, with estimates of (b)(3) 
overall strength ranging from 50 to 500 men. The 
units are augmented occasionally by CHDF and 
armed forces personnel. The command operates in an 
area from Samar and Leyte to Agusan and Surigao 
Provinces and has entered the Davao and Cotabato 
areas of Mindanao 
Indicators of Government and Insurgent Rural Control 
Attitudinal, organizational, and military indicators all 
suggest to us that the Philippine Government is 
making little progress with a seriously escalating 
insurgency. The CPP/NPA is gradually expanding its

because of poor leadership and inadequate implemen-
tation. In those villages they control, the insurgents' 
political organizations are functioning effectively. 
Most of the people are sympathetic toward the insur-
gents, provide them with material support, and can be 
mobilized against the government for mass actions. In 
many of these villages, a guerrilla 'militia has been 
organized to support the NPA and protect cadre and 
supporters. 
Attitudinal 
Favorable Attitudes Among the Local Population. 
The Philippine public is skeptical of Manila's efforts 
to improve local standards of living. Years of highly 
publicized development programs have yielded few 
concrete results. An opinion poll taken in 1983 shows 
that nearly one-third of the population feels living 
standards are deteriorating, a significant increase 
compared with the number of Filipinos who shared 
this feeling when the same question was asked in 
1981. In addition, the 1983 poll shows a majority of 
Filipinos have no confidence that the government will 
find solutions to their problems. 
The military�particularly the Philippine Constabu-
lary�has acquired a well-deserved reputation for 
abusing the rural civilian population, which discounts 
any claim by the military leadership that abuse is no 
longer tolerated. Local military and paramilitary 
forces confiscate farmers' food supplies, arbitrarily 
arrest and detain suspected subversives, physically 
abuse people, and summarily execute suspects. Com-
munist Party propaganda exa!gerates and publicizes  
the military's poor reputation. 
In contrast with their attitudes toward the govern-
ment, a significant number of rural Filipinos are 
favorably disposed toward both the Communist Party 
of the Philippines and the New People's Army. A 
captured member of the Central Committee of the 
CPP claims�and his military interrogators agree�
that 35 to 45 percent of the population of Northern 
Luzon can be relied upon to support the CPP/NPA. 
A recent opinion poll�confined to areas not under 
CPP/NPA control�disclosed that of those willing to 
express an opinion concerning the Communist Party, 
83 percent in Mindanao, 50 percent in the Visayas, 
and 18 percent in Luzon expressed a positive opinion.' 
The CPP/NPA generally uses persuasion to promote 
and maintain favorable attitudes among the people; 
cadre resort to intimidation and coercion sparingly. 
The NPA does not tax excessively and uses force only 
after repeated warnings. The insurgents work hard to 
demonstrate that their victims are guilty of a serious 
crime against the people and indeed, in most cases, 
those chosen for punishment are already notorious for 
corruption or abuse. 
Ability To Motivate Individuals To Take High Risks. 
The Philippine Government�for nearly two decades 
firmly controlled by Marcos's ruling KBL Party�has 
little ability to motivate people in rural areas. The 
government demands little from most of the popula-
tion and, in turn, provides few benefits. Rural barrio 
residents generally view the government as distant 
and avoid interacting with officials because such 
occasions yield abuse, frustration, or�even when 
some benefit is derived�humiliation. The Civilian 
Home Defense Forces�increasingly responsible for 
counterinsurgent operations against Muslim and 
Communist guerrillas�apparently vary widely in 
their capability and willingness to fight. In some areas 
they are effective while in others they sell their guns  
to the highest bidder 
 even many local KBL 
officials�fearful of the Communists�could not be 
motivated to run for office in 1982 
In contrast, although its numbers represent less than 1 
percent of the total national population, the 
CPP/NPA has steadily grown in committed support-
ers since its founding in 1969. Morale within the party 
and the NPA appears to be high: there are few 
defectors�most of those who defect are villagers who 
receive a monetary reward for "surrendering"�and 
the CPP/NPA continues to attract adherents despite 
the increased risk they will be involved in combat. 
Philippine intelligence estimates CPP/NPA support-
ers at 7,500 NPA regulars, more than 13,000 militia 
and self-defense forces, and 150,000 civilians in its 
village organizations. At a recent party meeting, the 
CPP Central Committee claimed to have 15,000 NPA 
regulars and an additional 10,000 militia. We esti-
mate the party to have about 8,000 political organiz-
ers and other types of cadre, many of whom  are 
probably not included in the numbers above 
4 In all three areas, however, only four out of 10 individuals polled 
were willing to express an opinion concerning the Communists.

Figure 11. Philippines: Man CPP NP leaders are university-
educated local youth. 
Captured party leaders say that they have had their 
most success in organizing the religious sector 
through united front activities. Priests, nuns, and lay 
leaders are highly respected by peasants and motivate 
many to join the revolution. Additionally, other NPA 
leaders, many of whom are locally born middle class 
youth who were radicalized while university students, 
gain the respect of poor farmers by their willingness to 
forgo seemingly lucrative careers and endure the 
hardships of life in the hills. 
Organizational 
Ability To Mobilize and Organize People at the 
Local Level. The Philippine Government has been 
ineffective in organizing and mobilizing people at the 
local level. Eighteen years of KBL Party control of 
government have resulted in local political systems 
frequently characterized by favoritism and en-
trenched sinecures more responsive to the demands of 
Manila than to those of the local population. Loyalty 
to the president and the KBL is repaid by opportuni-
ties to gain money and power, but these benefits do 
not trickle down to the rural poor, most of whom are  
untouched by their government  
 in many cases only local officials 
benefit from economic development funds allocated 
for private-sector projects. 
The insurgents, by comparison, have steadily im-
proved their ability to organize cadre and the local 
population in most rural areas 
approximately 18 percent 
ofIF�iiarangays are now effectively 
controlled by the CPP/NPA. The CPP/NPA is ac-
tively organizing barrio populations in 39 guerrilla 
� fronts nationwide. The CPP/NPA has gained 
strength and support, even in those provinces where 
the government's military presence is the strongest. 
The government's military campaign to rid the Bicol 
of NPA in 1982 was not only unsuccessful, but, 
according to US Embassy reports, the region has a 
much reater NPA presence today than it did a year 
ago. 
(b)(1) 
(b)(3) 
As CPP/NPA control is consolidated in one area, 
military and organizing activities are transferred to 
contiguous areas. Party strategy dictates�in line with (b)(3) 
the Chinese and Vietnamese model�that political 
organizations of the rural population is the key to 
political victory. Military action is considered less 
important at this time and attempts to permanently 
control territory are considered counterproductive 
(figure 12). (b)(3) 
Ability To Provide Material Benefits To Supporters. 
The Communists provide their cadre and supporters 
with only limited material benefits. The CPP/NPA 
platform rests on promises of advantages to the poor 
in a new Philippines "where the rich and the foreign 
exploiters won't take all the wealth of the people." 
Captured guerrilla leaders reveal that CPP/NPA 
cadre and guerrillas receive no regular compensa-
tion�although their families receive a small sti-
pend�and that the guerrillas lead a spartan exist-
ence, often lacking food. Party cadre emphasize to 
their followers that those who join the struggle are 
part of a long Filipino tradition of revolutionary 
heroes. 
For rural villagers who support the CPP/NPA, cadre

that their ability to achieve land reform should be

The Communist Strategy for Organizing a Village 
The CPPINPA uses a classic strategy�modeled on 
the teachings of Mao Zedong and Ho Chi Minh�to 
win control of rural barrios. Armed propaganda 
teams visit barrios in areas targeted for expansion 
and may spend more than a year slowly weaning the 
villagers away from the government. The strategy, 
spelled out in captured documents, consists of four 
stages: 
Infiltration. Cadre and party sympathizers, often 
nuns and lay Catholic Church workers, visit the 
barrio, frequently using the cover of legitimate activi-
ties. Their tasks are to evaluate the local security 
and political situation and to identify both sympa-
thetic and hostile residents. A barrio liaison group is 
formed among sympathetic residents. This stage may 
last from a week to a month. 
Preparatory. Armed propaganda teams visit the bar-
rio, showing residents that the NPA has the military 
muscle to come and go at will without government 
interference. They provide the residents with their 
view of the political situation and may reinforce their 
message by publicly threatening locally unpopular 
individuals with 'People's justice" if they fail to 
reform. Although public executions are infrequent�
most individuals comply by the third and final 
warning�it is generally understood that NPA justice 
is swift and uncompromising. During this phase, 
which may last three to four months, village associa-
tions representing peasants, women, and youth are 
formed. 
Consolidation. Cadre consolidate the party's hold on 
the barrio by setting up an organizing committee as 
the lawmaking body of the already established peas-
ant's association. A self-defense force, the first step in 
organizing armed groups, is also formed. By the end ' 
of this stage�which may last from six months to a 
year�a barrio branch of the Communist Party has 
been organized. 
Mass Organization. CPPINPA usually takes at least 
a year to complete its control of the barrio. During 
this final phase, representatives of the various barrios 
form a barrio association. The insurgents have by 
then effectively neutralized government presence in 
the village�probably never very strong�and are in 
control. 
The government generally does nothing until reports 
are received that a barangay is fully politicized. A 
typical response includes the preparation of a report 
and a one-day visit to the village by a team of civilian 
and military officials. During this visit a caucus is 
held with the people to determine their problems, 
needs, and grievances�probably the same ones pre-
sented to a similar group that visited them two years 
ago. Free medical and dental care is also adminis-
tpred and nrocrovernment Drovaganda distributed. 
 the rural folk are skeptical of the empty 
promises of officials and frequently react with disbe-
lief and passivity. In contrast with the CPPINPA who 
visit for months and befriend the villagers, govern-
ment and military officials rarely visit the villages 
and are considered strangers, neither to be trusted 
nor believed. 
local organizing efforts. In the CPP Central Commit-
tee newsletter, Ang Bayan, the party claims some 
success in forcing landlords to reduce rents and in 
stopping absentee landlords from collecting rents in 
the Cagayan Valley, Samar, the Bicol, and Minda-
nao. In some areas the party has helped limit local 
banditry, land grabbing, corruption, and brutality by 
local officials. Party members also give villagers 
practical advice about farming matters and health.

Manila's ability to provide material benefits to gov-
ernment supporters in a nation of 53 million is 
limited. The National Livelihood and Development 
(KKK) Program is the government's primary local 
economic program and is directly controlled by 
Imelda Marcos. It is aimed at benefiting the rural 
population and thereby countering insurgent claims 
that the government serves only the rich. In the two 
years since it was proclaimed as the economic center-
piece of a "New Society," however, the program has 
directly aided less than 1 percent of the Philippine 
population. According to US Embassy sources, critics 
contend that the KKK is another of the First Lady's 
public relations gimmicks, which, although politically 
attractive, lacks substance. Local intelligence officials 
frequently report graft and misappropriation of KKK 
funds by local officials, but there is no evidence that 
Manila dissuades such action or punishes guilty offi-
cials. 
Ability To Exploit Local Resources. The survival and 
growth of the CPP/NPA nationwide suggest its abili-
ty to exploit local resour-ces. Each of the 16 regional 
37 
Party Committees in the country is responsible for 
financing its own revolutionary activities with no 
known dependence on foreign sources for funds. Re-
cently captured NPA tax collectors in Davao del 
Norte�one of 39 active rural guerrilla fronts�have 
estimated monthly Communist collections in that 
province alone at $100,000. In areas under some 
degree of Communist influence, the CPP/NPA levies 
taxes on a progressive basis. Poor families pay little, 
but more prosperous families, including those of 
schoolteachers and owners of small shops, are expect-
ed to pay more. Business taxes are assessed according 
to the size of the company's operations and its ability 
to pay. Although the CPP/NPA has exhibited flexi-
bility in  collecting taxes, the threat of force is ever 
present. 
The insurgency has not diminished the government's 
ability to exploit resources in rural areas. The Com-
munist guerrillas have not targeted agriculture, agri-
business, forest products, or mining operations for

destruction because these resources provide needed 
funds for the CPP/NPA through taxation as well as 
incomes to otherwise unemployed families. In addi-
tion, many of these corporations have reputations for 
treating their employees fairly. 
We do not know the effect of the insurgency on the 
government's ability to collect local taxes nationwide. 
The Philippine Bureau of Internal Revenue is notori-
ously inefficient and corrupt, and few people have 
ever met their tax obligation. US Embassy travelers in 
the Bicol report that wealthy landlords who have 
stopped collecting rents from their tenants under 
NPA pressure have also stopped paying taxes to the 
government 
Military 
Ability To Protect Supporters and Local Organiza-
tions. The government is increasingly unable to pro-
tect its supporters from NPA reprisals in areas where 
the NPA is active. In most of these areas government 
security forces may appear in control by day, but the 
NPA rules at night. More government workers-96 
local officials and development program specialists�
and civilians were assassinated last year than ever 
before; two NPA defectors were assassinated in a 
well-guarded Constabulary mess hall. In Central Lu-
zon, Negros, and the Bicol, many fearful landlords 
have opted to avoid rural areas, and, in Negros, 
according to the US Consulate, 12 of the 33 munici-
pal mayors now reside in Bacolod, the capital city. A 
very reliable US Embassy source describes the Caga-
yan populace as demoralized and afraid and believes 
it supports the NPA, primarily as a means of survival. 
Mistreatment and abuse of the local population by 
government soldiers is random, NPA contact is more 
predictable. NPA violence is more focused and specif-
ic, leaving little doubt in people's minds which behav-
ior will bring retribution and which is needed to earn 
a degree of protection. 
Military Effectiveness. Low morale, a disillusioned 
officer corps, inadequate training, and poor disci-
pline�a major reason for abusive behavior toward 
the rural populace�are growing problems for the 
counterinsurgency efforts of the Philippine armed 
forces. In June a senior officer in Northern Luzon 
admitted that the campaign there is foundering under 
the weight of these problems, growing CPP/NPA 
strength, and a population that distrusts the govern-
ment and is sympathetic to the Communists. Most

In spite of the military's shortcomings, the govern-
ment continues to recruit enough soldiers. A military 
career provides opportunities for young men who 
would not otherwise find employment in the stagnant 
Philippine economy. Many of these recruits are not, 
however, of high caliber and are cashiered at the end 
of their two-year training period. 
39 
The aggressive advantage belongs to the NPA, which, 
according to Philippine intelligence, now initiates 60 
percent of all armed encounters. Consistent with Mao 
Zedong's emphasis on controlling the population, not 
the land, the NPA does not attempt to permanently 
control rural territory and immediately disengages to 
minimize losses when faced with superior government  
forces 
the NPA frequently succeeds in obtain-
ing weapons from government troops through well-
executed ambushes. Because of a lack of external 
� material support, the weapons procurement tactic has 
become a key objective of current NPA military 
strategy.
