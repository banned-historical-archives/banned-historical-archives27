 BRIEFING NOTES FOR DCI
 THAILAND
 I.  The Communists in Thailand are determined to
 step up the pace of their subversion, although
 it is clear that their capabilities are still
 limited.
 A.  The Communist insurgents have been increas-
 ing propaganda activities in the northeast,
 They have not, however, been able to
 follow up a series of well planned
 and executed attacks which they made
 in the northeast in June.
 2.   Although the rainy season is partially
 responsible, it is clear that the in-
 surgents are still on the defensive
 -and have the capability of mounting only
 occasional attacks,
 B.  we are beginning to develop a better under-
 standing of the Thai insurgent movement, par-
 ticu~:arly its weaknesses,

 the Communists seem to
 be laboring under some severe handicaps.  One
 of the most important is that they have not
 been notably successful in winning signifi-
 cant support among the villagers, although
 they have tried to capitalize on latent eco-
 nomic discontent and local grievances.  As
 a consequence, they have been forced to rely
 heavily on strong-arm methods which in turn
 further exacerbate  relations with villag-
 ers.
 2?    A dearth of dedicated cadres has limited
 the movement's  ability to go into new
 areas and to expand activities in areas
 already:,under  loose  Communist. controlm
 3.  North Vietnam may be supplying cadres to
 help out with such things as weapons train-
 ing, but thus far there is no firm evidence
 on this.

 II.  Meanwhile, the military leadership in Bangkok is

 LAOS
 2.  A new crisis has arisen in Premier
 Souvanna's perennially troubled rela-
 tions with his National Assembly.
 A.  This crisis was triggered by Sou-
 vanna's refusal in mid-summer to
 grant the assembly's request for
 additional appointments to the
 cabinet.
 B.   On September 16 the assembly re-
 jected the government's proposed bud-
 get.
 C.   Souvanna wants to use the present im-
 passe as an excuse for dissglving the
 assembly.
 1.  The King has reluctantly given
 Souvanna approval to dismiss the
 assembly if necessary.
 2.   The King's council is pressing for
 a compromise solution which would

 allow the assembly to sit until
 recess--October 11--and remain re-
 cessed until the spring elections.
 2.   Another proposal being considered
 would have a special assembly com-
 mittee session called to pass the
 budget.
 D.   Although Souvanna on September 27
 reaffirmed his intention to dissolve
 the assembly, a compromise solution is
 likely.
 II.    Souvanna's firm stand against the assembly
 pressure has been backed by the army, which
 plays a major role in Laotian politics.
 III.   The military situation has remained basically
 stable since the beginning of the rainy sea-
 son in May.
 A.  Friendly guerrilla forces made some
 limited advances in northern Laos during
 the rainy season and regained a small
 number of hilltop positions lost earlier
 to the Communists.

 1.  This see-sawing of positions has been a fea-
 ture of the Laos scene for years--the Commu-
 nists advancing during the dry season and
 then losing ground during the rains.
 2.   In large part, the poor Communist performance
 during the monsoon is due to the difficulty
 in resupply from North Vietnam over washed-
 out roads.
 3.   Because of the difficulty in resupply, large
 numbers of North Vietnamese troops which form
 the major portion of the effective Communist
 combat force in Laos, are annually withdrawn
 into North Vietnam during the rainy season.
 B.   There is no evidence that the Communists contem-
 plate a substantially higher level of military
 action in the upcoming dry season (October-April)
 than in past years but
 already beginning to come in about the return of
 North Vietnamese troops to northern Laos,

 of North Vietnamese troop strength in north-

 BRIEFING NOTES
 FOR THE DCI
 SOUTH VIETNAM
 [M~lPy QUANG TRI, DMZ and Operation PRAIRIE]
 QUANG TRI PROVINCE - DMZ BUILD-UP
 I.  There have been a number of indications in the
 last month that North Vietnamese forces have
 been engaged in an intensive logistics and troop
 build-up for offensive operations in the northernmost
 part of South Vietnam--Quang Tri Province,
 A.  This build-up has apparently been somewhat
 slowed down and disrupted by US air and ground
 operations.
 For example, the US Marine operation--code-
 named PRAIRIE--which has been under way in
 Quang Tri Province since early August has re-
 rnore tha-~ ~~---?"
 ported killing        enemy troops.  US
 air operations in this area have also slowed
 down the logistic effort by causing numerous
 secondary explosions and fires.

 B.  Nevertheless:;-the enemy buildup is continu-
 ing despite the relative success of US ef-
 forts at spoiling any Communist plans for
 an offensive.

 II.  Enemy forces in the Quang Tri Province - Demili-
 tarized Zone area include the estimated 9,000-

 several other recently infiltrated, as yet uni-
 dentified regiments.
 A.  In addition, there are other forces on the
 North Vietnamese side of the border which
 could be committed to an offensive.  These

 include the-341st Division
 Moreover, there apparently is an extensive
 logistics force supporting these troops in the
 DMZ area.
 The build-up is following classic. Communist
 patterns also
 II.   In assessing the Communist build-up in northern
 South Vietnam, it is unlikely that they intend
 to launch a large offensive before the rainy sea-
 son sets in around the end of October.  Until
 that time, US air and firepower superiority
 should be able to successfully stave off any large
 scale push.

 for just such a needed victory in the I Corps
 area--preferably to come before the US elec-
 tions in early November.
 1.  Moreover, past Communist practice has
 shown that they are not adverse to throw-
 ing large numbers of troops into a battle
 if they believe they can achieve a signifi-
 cent objective.  In the present circum-
 stances, the buildup that has already
 taken place--clearly the most significant
 current event in the war--gives rise to
 the possibility that they may "go for
 broke" in northern South Vietnam to gain
 that elusive victory so necessary to their
 morale.
 B.  In any case, it is estimated that Communist
 forces in Quang Tri Province still retain the
 capability to launch a multi-regimental of-
 fensive in the coming weeks.  Such a push
 could be aimed at the series of towns along
 Route 9 in central Quang Tri Province.

 BRIEFING NOTES FOR THE DCI
 Buddhist Leadership Remains in Disarray
 I.  Despite South Vietnam's progress tpward
 representative government, the continued
 split among the leaders of the Buddhist
 Institute is obscu.ri~ng that organization's
 future role in the political process.
 A.  Although their boycott of the recent
 constituent assembly election was
 largely ineffectual, the militant
 Buddhists are remaining-firm in their
 opposition to the present government and
 its policies, including the constitution
 drafting process which is just getting
 under way.
 1.  Thich Tri Quang, the leader of the
 more radical and active Buddhists,
 ended his three-month hunger fast
 shortly after the election, but at the
 same time, announced his continued
 opposition to the government.
 Approve
 Approved For Release 2004/06/24: CIA-RDP79T00827~000400130003-7
 2.  Quang's opposition stems specifically
 from the government's quelling of the
 "struggle" movement which he inspired
 in central Vietnam last spring, and
 from his general aspiration for a
 dominant political voice in the
 country's affairs.
 3.   Although Quang has lost much of the
 real political power he previously
 enjoyed and is now no real threat to
 the government, he and his activist
 followers still have the potential
 for future political strength.
 B.  Thich Tam Chau, a moderate Buddhist
 leader and still formally head of the
 Buddhist Institute, recently began efforts
 to override the attitude of the militants
 by rallying the more moderate Buddhists,
 and then arriving at a settlement with the
 government.
 1.  Chau is receiving the cooperation of
 government leaders, who are willing to
 make some concessions to the Buddhists
 under his leadershipo  In fact, many

 if not all of the Buddhist "struggle"
 prisoners arrested during the spring
 and early summer may soon be released
 by the GVN to boost Chau's prestige.
 2.   However, Chau is having no success in
 dealing with most of the other members
 of the Buddhist Institute, some of
 whom may question Chau's loyalties.
 C,   An extraordina~-congress
 Unified Buddhist Associatsion--for which
 the Institute acts as an executive arm--
 is scheduled to be held in October, in
 an effort to settle on a Buddhist policy
 toward  the government and to sort out the
 leadership problems.
 1.  At present, Chau is working hard to
 line up support for his position, but
 it remains questionable whether he
 would be able to prevail over Tri Quang
 and his followers at such a congress.
 D.   Should the congress not be called or should
 it fail to settle the Buddhists' leadership
 and policy problems, a formal organiza=
 tional split would seem to be quite possible.

 COMMUNIST CHINA
 Domestic Developments--Red Guards and Leadership
 T.  The internal political scene in Communist China
 has been marked by turmoil and disarray for
 many months now.  All of the indications are
 that the situation is still unstable, and there
 may be further upheavals.
 A.  For the past six weeks, mobs of rampaging
 teen-agers of the so-called Red Guard have
 kept the country in a state of disorder.
 1.  They have been roaming the streets of
 all major Chinese cities, harassing
 suspected enemies of the regime and
 occasionally beating them up.

 3.  There have been a few reports of vio-
 lence and bloodshed, but for the most
 part-the Red Guards appear to be a
 disciplined and well controlled organi-
 zation.
 4.   In the past week or so, their harass-
 ment has turned from the populace to
 high officials within the regular party
 machinery who oppose the current lead-
 ership.  The Red Guards have conducted
 violent demonstrations against many city
 and provincial party headquarters, and
 have displayed  wall posters attacking
 many high officials by name.
 B.  These destructive antics have tended to
 divert public attention #rom far more impor-
 tant developments within the Peking leader-
 ship.  It appears to us that the top struc-
 ture of the regime is undergoing a massive
 shake-up, and that the Red Guards are being
 used by the current leadership to consolidate
 its power.

 II.  Massive demonstrations in Peking on August 18
 and 31, and on September 15 Featured what ap-
 pears to be a-new line-up of the party's top
 policy=making .body, the Politburo.
 p,,  Mao Tse-tung still dominates the l~ader-
 ship, but Defense Minister Lin Piao has
 taken the place of Mao's long-time dep-
 uty, Liu Shao-chi.
 1,  Liu has been the titular chief of
 state.  There has been na announcement
 that he has lost that position, and he
 is:.still a member of the politburo,
 but he has been dropped ignominiously
 from second to eighth place.
 B.  As for Mao himself, we are not sure just
 how much control he still exercises over
 day-to-daY events, or how long he will
 last. He is 72 years bld,has a long
 history of cardio-vascular trouble, and
 was probably seriously ill last winter.
 III.  Mao's new deputy, Lin Piao, is not in much
 better health.

 A.  Lin is one of the youngest men in the
 politburo at 59, but he has been ill for
 much of the past 30 years,
 TV.  Mao, however, appears to have chosen Lin to
 be his successor in spite of Lin's frailty.
 We think this must reflect Mao's growing
 mistrust of other elements of the leadership.
 A.  Perhaps the most significant aspect of
 the recent changes has been the break-up
 of the group of leaders which had been
 running the party machinery for the past
 decade.
 1.  Liu Shao-chi was the leading member
 of that group.

 2.  The general secretary of the party,
 Teng Hsiao-ping, is another leading
 member of that group.  He his been
 weakened, but not as much as Li~?.
 3.   A couple of months ago, in fact,
 Teng appeared to have gained in the
 shake-up.  All that has changed.
 Teng is still in the inner circle
 of Mao?s advisers, but he has slipped
 from third or fourth place to sixth
 place in the power structure.
 I}~ place of the party leaders, military
 leaders close to Lin, and government fig-
 ures like Chou En=tai, have risen in
 importance.
 U.  For many years now, it had appeared to us
 -that the leaders of the party machinery--men
 like Liu Shao-chi--enjoyed Mao's full trust.

 A.  They not only had a long record of personal
 loyalty to Mao; their .radical approach was
 also in accord with his.
 B.   This situation presents us with a puzzling
 contradiction, especially in regard to
 its policy implications:
 1.  Mao is apparently intent on pushing
 through a radical program to reshape
 Chinese society.  Tt appears to be so
 radical that the party rank and file
 could not be trusted to carry it out.
 The Red Guard had to be created.
 2.   There is, therefore, no satisfactory
 explanation for Mao's willingness to
 turn against his old comrades who
 appeared to share his radical views.
 3.   The government administrators and
 economic specialists who have been
 retained or even promoted--men like
 Chou En-lai, Chen Yun, and Li Fu-Chun--
 are the relatively moderate members of
 the politburo.

 4.  Yet these moderates are now the men who
 presumably will be helping Mao and Lin
 Piao to implement the radical program.
 VI.  As I have said, the situation appears to be
 highly unstable. The events of the past ten
 months must have intensified the antagonisms
 and mistrust among those leaders who have sur-
 vived the purge.
 A.  The possibility has increased that when
 Mao finally does go, the succession will
 be disorderly, and marked by factional
 struggles and bloody purges.
 B.   It is also far from clear whether or not
 the new leaders are going to institute
 any major changes in domestic or foreign
 policy.
 C.   There has, however, been no change in the
 basic hard-line nature of the men at the
 top.  As a result, we foresee no abrupt
 change in Peking's policy of implacable
 hostility toward the United States.

 COMMUNIST CHINA
 Communist China's Advanced Weapons ProgxamS
 I.  Communist ~hina'is putting a high prgportion
 of its scarce technical and industrial resources
 into a major effort to develop an advanced
 weapons program.          At present ~  the  Ch~.}~ese

 with a range of 700 to 1,000 miles.  This
 would let them hit almost all the important
 targets in the Far East--including many US
 bases--as well as some important targets
 in the i1SSR.  We now estimate-. that they
 could begin deploying a few MRBMs in 1967
 or 1968.  By then they could have a low-
 yield nuclear warhead for the missile.

 C.  An ICBM would be attractive to the Chinese to
 threaten the US or the USSR.  Most of their
 other potential targets could be reached with
 the MRBM.
 V.  The Chinese have also built one missile-carrying
 submarine, a copy of the Soviet G-class.  The
 Soviet version carries three ballistic missiles
 with a range of 350 miles.  The Chinese submarine
 is now operating, but we don't have any evidence
 that they have developed a missile
 The G-class is diesel-powered, must surface  o
 launch its missiles, and has a very limited capa-
 bility to threaten the US because of the short
 time it could remain off the West Coast.
 VI.   The Chinese are also preparing to produce jet
 medium bombers, copies of the Soviet TU-16.
 The first one won't roll out until 1968, and it
 will take several years to deploy more than a
 few of these aircraft.  China's present bomber
 force is limited to two TU-16s, a dozen aging
 B-29 type aircraft, and about 270 IL-28 jet
 light bombers.  They could now have a few nuclear
 weapons stockpiled for delivery  by the medium
 bombers.

 Advanced Defensive Systems
 I.  The continuing Soviet emphasis on defense is
 seen in their vigorous program during the past
 decade to develop an anti-ballistic-missile
 system.
 A.  Along with the ABM development, they have
 produced new air defense systems to
 counter advanced aerodynamic vehicles.
 Both types of systems are now being
 deployed.
 B.   The Soviets have been working on an anti-
 ballistic missile defense for Moscow for
 several years.  The system could achieve
 initial operational capability within the
 next year or two and full operation within
 three or four years from now.

 BRIEFING  NOTES  F?R '1'TTE  DCI
 SYRIA
 I.  The radical Baathist military junta which seized
 control of the Syrian Government last February
 is still clinging to power.
 A.  The regime's radically leftist complexion and
 violent anti-Western propaganda stance are
 favorable to the interests of both the So-
 viet Union and the domestic Syrian Communists.
 Nevertheless, the Communist Party of Syria
 has not achieved the freedom of action that
 it apparently expected when the new regime
 came to power.
 B.   The USSR has given the Syrians extensive
 propaganda support.  A major agreement was
 signed in April to finance Syria's long-
 standing Euphrates Dam ~.evelopment project.
 The Soviets will exercise some caution, how-
 ever, in becoming too deeply committed to
 support of the uncertain regime.

 proved For Release 2004/06/24: CIA-RDP79T00827A00040q
 II.  Serious personal,: ideological, and religious rival-
 ries divide the present government.
 A.  The military leaders who dominate the scene
 at the moment are members of the minority
 Alawite sect.  They have successfully purged
 large numbers of Sunni Muslims, the majority
 of the Syrian population, from influential
 positions within the military establishment.
 B.   The Druze, another minority group, also played
 a disproportionate role within the army until
 the unsuccessful coup attempt in early Sep-
 tember by Druze officers.  Many of these of-
 ficers have now fled to Jordan.
 C.   Another source of contention is whether or
 not the Syrians will seek a renewal of close
 rel~.tions with Nasir's Egypt.
 IMAP, ISRAELI-SYRIAN BORDER]
 III.  Meanwhile, tension along the Israeli-Syrian border
 remains high.  The belligerent postures adopted
 by both countries make future incidents, includ-
 ing retaliatory raids by Israel, almost a cer-
 tainty.

 A.  Following a serious border clash on 15 Au-
 gust, Syria stated that it would answer
 Israeli retaliation by striking directly
 into Israel rather than complaining to the
 UN.
 B.   The Syrians resumed work on their Jordan
 River diversion projects in August, and have
 cleared some 45 kilometers of the 75-kilo-
 meter diversion canal.  The Israelis, how-
 ever, are said to be relaxed about the pres-
 ent  work which is being carried out well
 inside Syrian territory.
