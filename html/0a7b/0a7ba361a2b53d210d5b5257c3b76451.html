 Socialist realism is an artistically creative method whose guiding principle is the truthful,
 historically concrete presentation of reality in its revolutionary development, and whose
 most important task is the communist education of the masses.
 The Great Soviet Encyclopedia,
 (second edition, 1957; Vol. 40, p. 180)
 The lie can pit itself against much in this world, but not against art.
 Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn
 Summary
 the Soviet leadership is faced with a long-standing problem that is
 entering a new and more difficult phase-how to gain the advantages of
 better relations with the West without eroding its control over Soviet
 society. It appreciates the tangible, material benefits and a greater sense of
 legitimacy and prestige derived from detente, but recognizes that any moves
 to increase personal and cultural freedom would cause strains in the closed
 Soviet society. All levels of the Soviet body politic are aware of this conflict,
 and a variety of groups outside the power structure-intellectuals, minorities,
 active dissidents, and political prisoners-sense a new opportunity in the
 recently announced link between an easing of Soviet emigration procedures
 and US trade policy toward Moscow to press for a more general relaxation of
 domestic policies.

 Civil Rights Focus on Emigration
 Some Soviet  dissidents,  certainly   over-
 optimistically, read the price the regime has paid
 for US trade concessions as the "opening of the
 floodgates." Despite the lack of reporting on the
 subject by Soviet media, the public is becoming
 aware of the substance of the letters dated Octo-
 ber 18, exchanged between Secretary Kissinger
 and Senator Jackson, and the White House clar-
 ifying statement, tying the emigration issue to
 passage of the trade reform bill, which would
 grant most favored nation status to Moscow. Only
 three days before the US announcement, Brezh-
 nev publicly reiterated for the record the line that
 it is impermissible to set conditions for detente.
 Despite this disclaimer, the negotiations on em-
 igration are certainly seen by all Soviet citizens,
 not just Jews, as an unprecedented concession in
 an area of hitherto sacrosanct domestic policy.
 The right to freedom of movement within
 the USSR and, above all, the right to emigrate,
 have been goals shared by all, not just Jewish,
 dissidents. Some, at least, go further and consider
 the core of a general civil rights guarantee for all
 Soviet citizens.
 It is this view and its consequences that the
 regime is apparently intent on curbing and cor-
 recting, although at what cost is still unclear. The
 problem must still be a matter of debate within
 the leadership. This would explain some of the
 recent signs of contradictory policies in domestic
 cultural affairs and the seesaw Soviet posture on
 freedom of movement issues at the European
 Security Conference.
 Signs of Conservative Retrenchment
 The leadership's concern over the potentially
 corrosive effect of detente-generated  popular
 expectations on its domestic controls is perhaps
 most readily apparent in the nationwide ideolog-
 ical vigilance campaign that got under way late
 this summer. Heralded by the Central Commit-
 tee's generally critical assessment in late August
 of party  ideological  work  in the Belorussian
 Republic,  the  pervasive  campaign  has  been
 striking out mainly at "consumerism," nation-
 Special Report                                                   - 3 -
 alism, religion, and other bourgeois "ills." The
 drive is designed to improve the technical and
 ideological expertise of party workers, to rein-
 vigorate the propaganda apparatus at all levels,
 and to restore popular faith  in the curative
 powers of Marxism-Leninism. It is thus the most
 conspicuous sign that a significant relaxation of
 domestic policy is not imminent. Party conserva-
 tives probably see the campaign as a major tool
 for promoting their views; when articles of faith
 are at issue, moderation can be labeled a vice.
 Heaping praise on a period characterized by
 cultural repression is another way open to con-
 servatives  intent on frustrating any change in
 domestic policy. An editorial in Pravda on the
 10th anniversary of Khrushchev's ouster, for
 example, praised Brezhnev's stewardship over a
 period  of  "collective"  rule  and  denigrated
 Khrushchev's more freewheeling style. In the
 symbol-studded world of Soviet internal politics,
 Pravda was also criticizing the relatively liberal
 cultural policy of the Khrushchev era.
 More significantly, the sensitive issue of
 Soviet historical interpretation of Stalin and his
 rule has again reappeared after a hiatus of many
 years.  Under  Khrushchev,  censuring  Stalin
 became a symbolic advocacy of a change in the
 status quo; now even limited praise of Stalin has
 become a symbol of retrenchment. This weather
 vane is closely watched by both establishment
 and dissident cultural elements. The recently
 announced publication of a revised version of
 Marshal Zhukov's memoirs is thus another signif-
 icant negative sign. The book, which as yet is
 unavailable in the West, modifies a chapter in the
 original version that questioned Stalin's wartime
 leadership.
 Stemming directly from the ideological cam-
 paign are several recent appointments of veteran
 ideologists to important and long-vacant posts in
 the party's central propaganda apparatus. Con-
 servatives and cultural  hard  liners have been
 recently appointed to the chief editorship of the
 Central Committee's journal Kommunist and of
 the embattled, but hitherto still relatively liberal,
 literary journal Novy Mir.

 Water truck disrupts Moscow art show on September 15
 The most dramatic sign of bold conservative
 action occurred on September 15, when bull-
 dozers and water cannon were used to disrupt an
 attempt by Moscow's unconventional artists to
 stage an open air exhibit. Although the artists
 received permission to hold a public show two
 weeks later-and did so-many of them have sub-
 sequently reported that they have been subjected
 to increased official harassment. Some have been
 charged with "parasitism," i.e., failure to hold
 gainful employment, and one was pressed to sign
 an affidavit renouncing any intention to organize
 or participate in similar future exhibits. Moreover,
 an article in the Moscow party organization's
 daily on October 17 indirectly praised the ideo-
 logical work of the district in which the disrup-
 tion of the initial show occurred. The message
 seemed to be that the original decision to prevent
 the exhibit was correct, even if the methods used
 were excessive, and that the subsequent permis-
 sion to hold the show should not be regarded as
 precedent setting.
 The only statement on this issue so far by a
 member of the leadership came on November 10
 Special Report                                  -4-
 4 -
 when President Podgorny said that "the slightest
 when
 departure from our principles is inadmissible in
 any kind of art." Speaking on the 150th anniver-
 sary of Moscow's Maly theater, Podgorny tied his
 warning  against  any  deviation  from  socialist
 realism to the ideological campaign by adding
 that art must be used to combat "apolitical, con-
 sumer psychology."
 The conservatives' jealous defense of domes-
 tic controls and stonewalling on cultural issues are
 inevitably reflected in their opposition to eased
 emigration procedures. There are sporadic but
 continuing  reports  of  harassment  of  Jewish
 activists and of Jews who have declared their
 intention to emigrate. Since the US Congress has
 not yet passed the trade bill, the Soviet regime
 probably does not regard these actions as a breach
 of the US-Soviet understanding. A number of
 Soviet Jews, however, have already made that
 charge in public statements.
 Moreover,  isolated  reports  of  continued
 harassment of non-Jewish would-be emigrants by
 Soviet  officials  are  intensifying fears among

 non-Jewish dissidents in Moscow that the regime
 is determined to restrict any easing of emigration
 to Jews, despite the non-exclusive wording of the
 Kissinger-Jackson letters.
 The Other Side of the Ledger
 Along with these signs of intent to preserve
 the status quo are others suggesting something
 less than total inflexibility in the Kremlin.
 One such sign came on September 2, when a
 monument for Khrushchev's grave-a bust of the
 former leader by maverick sculptor Ernst Neiz-
 vestny-was unveiled at Moscow's Novodevichy
 Cemetery. The sculptor, a Jew, began work on
 the monument at the request of the Khrushchev
 family soon after the leader's death in 1971.
 Permission to install it was withheld, however,
 until mid-April of this year; Neizvestny claimed
 that the decision was conveyed to him by a
 person close to Brezhnev.
 The unveiling of the monument was prob-
 ably seen by Moscow's unconventional artists as
 evidence of a partial rehabilitation of Khrushchev
 and of official acceptance of Neizvestny's own
 unconventional work. They may have been en-
 couraged by this to try to stage the open air art
 show, hoping the move also signaled a shift in the
 direction of the more relaxed cultural policies of
 the Khrushchev era. Although the attempt itself
 was a fiasco, the dissidents were no doubt
 heartened by the confusion in the Moscow city
 bureaucracy following the disruption of the show,
 signs of high-level intervention, and the successful
 staging of the second exhibit. Moreover, in early
 October the party chief of the Moscow district in
 which  the  initial  disruption  occurred  was
 ousted-evidently as a scapegoat-and sent into
 diplomatic exile as ambassador to Hanoi. On Oc-
 tober 4, a deputy editor of Pravda privately
 apologized to a US embassy officer for the
 manhandling of US correspondents during the
 aborted art show.
 In the midst of these events the daily paper
 of the Communist Youth League on September
 17 published what could only have been viewed
 as an implicit defense of Khrushchev's rewriting

 of  Stalinist history.  The  reviewer  of Ivan
 Stadnyuk's War, a novel glorifying Stalin's war-
 time leadership, rebuked the author for glossing
 over Stalin's errors and failing to take into ac-
 count "the clear assessments of our historical
 science." This was the first positive endorsement
 of Khrushchev's rewriting of Stalinist history to
 appear  in  years.  Whether  the  review was a
 stimulus or a response to the apparently pro-
 Stalin revision of the Zhukov memoirs is a moot
 point; it is the re-emergence of the symbolic
 debate between advocates and opponents of the
 status quo that is significant.
 Another series of positive signs, contrasting
 with the  continued  harassment of individual
 Jewish would-be-emigrants, has been the selective
 but markedly more lenient posture toward the
 Jewish community in Moscow. For example, the
 public religious observances of the holiday of
 Sirnchas Torah in October proceeded without the
 customary harassment in front of the Moscow
 synagogue by the police.
 Another case in point is the unusual course
 of the trial of Viktor Polsky, a prominent Jewish
 activist. Polsky was charged with having struck a
 girl  with  his  automobile.  The victim  is the
 daughter of a man identified in 1972 as a ranking
 official of the USSR Procuracy. Polsky contended
 that the girl had leaped in front of his car in a
 suicide attempt. Polsky, a physicist, lost his job
 soon after he applied for emigration and claimed
 he had been "hounded" because of his desire to
 emigrate. At the trial, however, a physician who
 treated  the  girl  after  the  accident appeared
 "unexpectedly" to testify in Polsky's defense, an
 ambulance driver corroborated Polsky's account
 of the incident, and the defense attorney-a
 Jew---successfully  undercut    the  testimony  of
 prosecution witnesses, including that of the girl's
 father. Moreover, prominent Moscow dissidents,
 among them the wife of Andrey Sakharov, and
 several Western correspondents were admitted to
 the courtroom. Polsky was found guilty only of
 negligence, was sentenced to pay a nominal fine,
 and was released.
 These examples of leniency suggest that at
 least some elements of Soviet officialdom have
 been instructed to try to avoid adverse Western
 publicity, especially while the trade legislation is
 still pending in the US Congress. This interpreta-
 tion is reinforced by the failure of Moscow police

 to arrest three young Jews who on October 29
 demonstrated in the streets for the right to
 emigrate to Israel. It was the first such demonstra-
 tion since the announcement of the US-Soviet
 emigration understanding.
 An Uncertain Prognosis
 The conflicting signs in Soviet policy in the
 area of human rights suggest that the leadership is
 still debating the issue of greater flexibility,
 Podgorny's remarks on November 11 notwith-
 standing. Podgorny, generally identified with cul-
 tural conservatives, clearly does not have the last
 word on cultural policy.
 The leadership's discussion almost certainly
 hinges on the price, i.e., the benefits accruing
 from detente, being right. Recent events also
 show how vulnerable the regime's domestic
 practices are to Western publicity, and both the
 leadership and the dissidents are well aware of
 this.
 Kremlin advocates of detente may believe
 that some relaxation of domestic controls will
 deflect adverse publicity and help the Soviets in
 other areas of East-West negotiations. They may
 fear that if incidents like the art show are handled
 piecemeal, the energies of the leadership as a
 whole will be sapped, and latent divisions on
 other policy issues could rise to the surface.
 The  leadership will  be concerned that
 evidence that it was not adhering to its bargain
 with the US on emigration would be viewed by
 influential segments of Western political opinion
 as casting doubt on Soviet good faith in other
 detente-related negotiations. The leaders are prob-
 ably not of one mind in their assessment of what
 the West would regard as non-adherence, but they
 are almost certainly agreed that they must try to
 limit the domestic  impact of the emigration
 accord as much as possible. In the short term,
 they will probably test US determination to insist
 on the terms of the agreement. The longer trend

 SCUHL I
 Religious services conducted in Moscow's central synagogue
 could be toward some easing of internal condi-
 tions, providing the relaxation appears to the
 public as the regime's own decision and not-as in
 the case of the art show-an embarrassed response
 to internal and external pressure.
 This will not be an easy task. So far, the
 generally fragmented nature of Soviet dissidence
 has been an asset to the regime. The dissidents,
 though often vocal, are numerically insignificant,
 and the Soviet masses are generally apathetic and
 unsympathetic.  Although  the  dissidents  are
 spread  thin  over the political spectrum, and
 frequently divided on both goals and methods,
 they are united-as were their historical predeces-
 sors---in their desire to gain the right to voice
 unorthodox views. They are united in viewing the
 foreign press as a pulpit without which their
 voices would now be ignored. And they all sup-
 port the right to emigration-despite the ambigu-
 ous feelings arising from the traditional Russian
 attachment to the motherland. Some dissidents,
 like the  democratic  group  clustered  around
 Andrey Sakharov, support emigration as a matter
 of principle; others, such as the authoritarian
 Russian nationalists, frequently favor it for anti-
 Semitic reasons.
 The  emigration  issue  is  also  likely to
 embolden Soviet dissidents to test the limits of
 the  regime's  flexibility   on  other  matters.
 Sakharov has announced that the hunger strike he
 claims occurred in several Soviet labor camps on
 October 30 will become an annual event. Mos-
 cow's  unconventional  artists  have                                                                         announced
 plans to stage a second, indoor, public exhibit of
 their work in  December. Their colleagues in
 Leningrad are pressing authorities there to permit
 a similar public show. All concerned probably
 view the coming months as a test of both Soviet
 and Western attitudes, and the dissidents may
 anticipate a period in which they have a new
 weapon--Western  attention  to  the emigration
 agreement--to advance their cause

 The Middle East: Options Narrow
 Arab and Israeli reaction to Secretary Kis-
 singer's visit last week, as reflected in their respec-
 tive media, has been muted, and neither side has
 struck any notes of optimism on the prospects for
 further peace negotiations. The circumspect press
 commentary is partly due to the fact that so little
 information on the visit has been made public.
 Even more, it probably reflects recognition on all
 sides that the options for restoring negotiating
 momentum have narrowed considerably since the
 Arab summit last month.
 Both Egypt and Israel still appear to be
 focusing on a further disengagement in the Sinai
 as the only means of breaking the present dead-
 lock. The Israeli press has speculated that Secre-
 tary Kissinger may pursue this subject in another
 visit to the Middle East next month or else invite
 Egyptian and Israeli representatives to begin talks
 then  in Washington.  Israeli  Foreign  Minister
 Allon, however, has stated publicly that "a great
 deal of clarification is needed before negotiations
 can be revived." The US embassy in Tel Aviv adds
 that the Israelis are not optimistic because, as one
 leading daily noted, there is an "abysmal gap"
 between Israel's demands for a political settle-
 ment with Egypt and the more narrow military
 agreement Egyptian President Sadat is prepared
 to concede.
 During the Secretary's visit, Sadat publicly
 affirmed his belief that a step-by-step approach
 remains viable, and he clearly would prefer to
 pursue unilaterally a further disengagement in the
 Sinai. Nevertheless, there were indications during
 the Arab summit that he was heavily pressured by
 other Arab leaders not to proceed before extract-
 ing a commitment from the US and Israel that
 Syria would also be included in any future phase
 of negotiations. Syria thus continues to play the
 pivotal role. Prospects for breaking the deadlock
 on the Arab side appear to hinge on whether or
 not President Asad believes that Sadat is ready to
 insist on linking another Israeli withdrawal in the
 Sinai with one on the Golan Heights.
 Sadat has continued to hedge his bets on this
 subject in public. He has claimed both that the
 Arab summit decisions have not impaired Egypt's
 freedom to negotiate and that future negotiations
 must be "on all fronts."
 Despite  the  persistent  Syrian  misgivings
 about a step-by-step approach and about Egypt's
 attitude, it seems most likely that Sadat has had
 to give Asad some private assurances that Egypt
 will demand simultaneous progress in negotiations
 and, perhaps, even that Egypt will support Syria
 if it is attacked. The crucial question at the
 moment appears to be whether or not Syria can
 be sufficiently mollified to allow some form of
 preliminary Egyptian-Israeli talks to take place
 that could be billed as the first step in a "simul-
 taneous" negotiating process.
 Syria's principal concern is that the opening
 of any new Egyptian-Israeli discussions would
 reduce its leverage on Israel and give Tel Aviv an
 excuse for postponing further any consideration
 of concessions on the Golan Heights. Earlier this
 month, Prime Minister Rabin reiterated that Israel
 is ready to resume negotiations with Syria, but
 there have been no indications that the Israelis are
 preparing to make new proposals. If Israel con-
 tinues to balk, Asad could attempt to force the
 issue by pressing for reconvening the Geneva con-
 ference.
 What Syria does about the renewal of the
 mandate of the UN observer force on the Golan
 front, which expires at the end of this month, has
 been       regarded as a key indicator of Asad's
 attitudes and intentions. Speculation continues
 that he may refuse to extend the mandate to
 demonstrate at home and abroad his dissatisfac-
 tion with Israel's failure to offer concessions. This
 week there were some signs that military con-
 siderations could prevent Asad from playing this
 card.

 Asad's  military  advisers  presumably  rec-
 ognize that hostilities, once begun, could not be
 confined to a repetition of the artillery duels and
 patrol actions that Syria employed to reinforce its
 bargaining points in the disengagement talks last
 spring. If Asad should decide that ending the
 mandate involves too much risk of a destructive
 Israeli attack, he might justify a limited extension
 of a few months as necessary to allow time both
 for more vigorous diplomatic efforts and for the
 completion of military training and defense con-
 struction programs.
 When Asad makes his play on the mandate
 issue, it will be based as much on political as on
 military factors. He probably believes that the25X1
 negotiating options have not yet been completely
 exhausted. As usual, however, he has his cards
 Palestinians at the UN
 Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasir
 Arafat  asked  the  UN  General  Assembly  on
 November 13 to back the Palestinians' right to
 return to their homeland, to determine their own
 future, and to establish a national authority on
 any   Palestinian  territory "from which Israeli
 occupation is removed."
 These  points  were drawn  from a com-
 prehensive policy statement approved  by the
 PLO's parliamentary body in Cairo last June.
 Arafat, in his address at the UN, did not repeat
 the more radical planks of that platform, notably
 the standard PLO threats directed at Israel. In
 June, Arafat approved a statement that the PLO
 would use all means, "foremost of which is armed
 struggle," to liberate Palestinian land; at the UN,
 he asked that there be no more bloodshed.
 Arafat did not repeat either the Palestinians'
 usual rejection of UN Security Council Resolu-
 tion 242, which provides the legal basis for the
 Geneva peace talks, or their frequent denuncia-
 tions of Jordan's King Husayn. These omissions
 almost certainly reflect the PLO leaders' current
 inclination to hint at compromises with Israel and
 Jordan in the hope of gaining a meaningful role in
 peace negotiations and eventually winning control
 of a truncated Palestinian state.
 Arafat's  resort  to  intangible appeals for
 justice for the Palestinians and his tactic of avoid-
 ing threats to Israel were designed to gain wide
 support for the Palestinians and to avoid giving
 offense to Israel's backers, particularly the US.
 The PLO chief decried US support for Israel,
 which he charged is not in the interest of the
 "American masses." He appealed to the American
 people for friendship and for more fruitful rela-
 tions with the Arab world.
 Because the Palestinians have no official
 status at the UN, Arafat did not offer a specific
 proposal  for  a  resolution  on  the  Palestine
 question. Such a proposal will be introduced later
 in the debate, probably by Egypt.
 Debate on the Palestine question is expected
 to last until November 21. In order to ensure that
 its views are heard, Israel has reserved the right to
 address each session. The Arabs responded by
 claiming the same prerogative for Syria, their
 spokesman.
 In an initial reaction to Arafat's UN speech,
 Israeli Prime Minister Rabin said it challenged
 Israel's very existence and was made on the
 assumption that Jews have no right to a state.
 Rabin emphasized, however, that Israel would
 continue the search for peace with the Arabs in
 every way-directly or indirectly.
 Arab residents in the Israeli-occupied West
 Bank staged several demonstrations in support of
 the PLO this week. A general strike called for on
 the  West Bank by PLO broadcasts to mark
 Arafat's UN debut met with only limited success,
 however, in the face of intensive Israeli pressure.
 The major exception came in Nablus-long a
 hotbed of anti-Israeli activity-where the strikes
 was almost totally effective.

 The cabinet announced a number of new
 economic measures this week, highlighted by a
 43-percent devaluation of the pound. The new
 measures  are  the  latest in  a series of steps
 designed to correct the country's economic ills
 caused by the burden Israel's military program
 places on the country's resources. Last July the
 government implemented a number of measures
 aimed  at  slowing  the  rate  of  inflation and
 trimming nonessential budget outlays. A third
 economic package that will concentrate on wage,
 income, and tax reforms has yet to be announced.
 The latest measures deal almost exclusively
 with slowing Israel's foreign currency drain. In
 addition to the devaluation of the pound from
 4.2 to 6 per US dollar, the government has moved
 to:
 ? Freeze imports of certain luxury goods,
 including autos, for six months.
 ? Raise the foreign travel tax.
 ? Increase utility taxes and the prices of
 petroleum products.
 ? Reduce subsidies on many basic com-
 modities.
 ? Extend the national wage agreement for
 one year.
 Finance Ministry officials said the new eco-
 nomic program was made imperative by the large
 decline in foreign exchange reserves. At the end
 of September official reserves stood at $1 billion,
 a drop of $800 million since the beginning of the
 year.  According  to  Israeli  officials, the new
 measures will save an estimated $700 million in
 foreign exchange.
 Israel's current account deficit has soared to
 $3.5 billion this year from a deficit of only $1
 billion  before  the war. Arms purchases from
 abroad have accelerated and put added pressures
 on reserve holdings. Defense imports this year will
 probably  total  $2.4  billion,  compared  with
 $500-600 million a year before the war. Although
 the US is covering the bulk of Israel's arms
 imports with official aid, Israel apparently has
 purchased up to $400 million in arms under
 commercial contracts. The sharp rise in world
 food prices also has contributed to Israel's trade
 woes.
 The new measures will surely aggravate infla-
 tion, which has increased 40 percent since the
 war. The reduction in basic foodstuff subsidies
 alone has caused the consumer price index to rise
 17 percent-some officials are speculating that
 prices could rise as much as 50 percent within a
 year.
 Much will depend on whether the Histadrut
 labor federation, whose support is vital to the
 program's success, agrees to go along with the
 government's desire to hold the line on wages.
 Prime Minister Rabin's bargaining position was
 strengthened when the Knesset voted 59 to 41 on
 November 12 to approve the economic package.
 Nevertheless, Rabin will probably have to make
 some concessions to the Histadrut. The govern-
 ment has already promised to work with the
 union to ameliorate the effects of price increases
 on low income groups, large families, poor elderly
 people, and welfare recipients.
 Although the Israeli public anticipated many
 of the government's actions, their severity when
 officially unveiled came as a shock and led to a
 series of demonstrations, brief strikes, and rioting
 in parts of Tel Aviv. Arabs in the Israeli-occupied
 West Bank-which is closely linked to the Israeli
 economy-also demonstrated against the rise in
 price of basic commodities. Violent protests such
 as occurred in Tel Aviv were the exception, how-
 ever. Press commentary on the new program was
 generally favorable, conceding the necessity for
 harsh measures, but cautioning the government to
 ensure that their impact is distributed equitably.

 Austerity Measures in Israel
 Approved For Release 2008/07/15: CIA-RDP79-00927A010900160001-6
 The conservative New Democracy Party led
 by Prime Minister Karamanlis is favored to win
 the elections this Sunday. Much is riding on voter
 confidence in  Karamanlis, who has made his
 experience and proven ability to govern one of
 the main issues in the campaign. The size of his
 victory will determine how flexible he can be on
 Cyprus, NATO, and in relations with the United
 States. It will also influence Greece's future politi-
 cal  structures, as the new  parliament  is em-
 powered to revise the constitution.
 Should Karamanlis fail to gain an outright
 majority in parliament, he will form a coalition
 government with the centrist Center Union - New
 Forces led by George Mavros, which is expected
 to come in second. Such a coalition would be
 much like that which took over this summer
 when the military stepped down. Mavros is less
 flexible than Karamanlis on Cyprus and NATO
 and less favorably disposed toward the US. A
 coalition dependent on Center Union support
 might therefore prove unwieldy at times, but can
 be expected to keep Greece on a basically pro-
 Western course and act responsibly on the Cyprus
 and Aegean issues.
 Issues  in the campaign  have  been  over-
 shadowed by the leading personalities, most of
 whom were active in politics before the 1967
 military  coup.  The parties have  been  recon-
 stituted, however. Karamanlis has dropped con-
 servatives who collaborated with the junta and
 has tried to broaden the base of his support by
 bringing in a large number of new faces. Mavros
 has picked up several colorful candidates who had
 been associated with resistance to the junta, such
 as the would-be assassin of ex-President Papa-
 dopoulos. Mavros' leadership and party organiza-
 tion is weak, however. More important, as Kara-
 manlis' former foreign minister, he has found it
 difficult to establish a separate identity for him-
 self and  his party, which  is, in many ways,
 ideologically similar to that of Karamanlis.
 Popular discontent with the past seven years
 of military rule plus anti-American sentiment over
 Cyprus provide the left wing with promising ter-
 rain                                                                  to exploit, but the left is split between
 Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Move-
 ment and the United Left. Papandreou has been
 exploiting themes of betrayal in Cyprus, hostility
 to NATO, neutralism, a vague socialism, and anti-
 Americanism to obtain considerable popularity
 among  intellectuals,  radicalized  students, and
 youth.. He is mistrusted by the farmers and the
 middle class, as well as by the establishment,
 however.  In addition, complicated registration
 procedures and the requirement that voters must
 cast their ballots in their place of origin may limit
 the turnout of student voters. Papandreou is also
 running more political unknowns than any other
 party and is fielding candidates in only 38 out of
 56 electoral districts. He and the Center Union -

 New Forces are expected to split about 40 per-
 cent of the vote, with the Center Union getting
 the larger share.
 The United Left, a grouping of two Commu-
 nist parties and a former communist-front group,
 is the only major group in the election that has
 been ruled a coalition by the Supreme Court. This
 means that the United Left must obtain 30 per-
 cent of the vote in order to be eligible to partici-
 pate in more than the first "distribution" of seats
 under Greece's complicated proportional repre-
 sentation law. Most observers do not give the
 United Left more than 15 percent of the vote.
 With perhaps as much as 30 percent of the vote
 the leftist groups-the United Left plus Papan-
 dreou-could  be  a  vocal  factor  in  the new
 parliament.
 Except for Papandreou, the parties have
 treated the Cyprus issue gingerly. They all sup-
 port a solution "safeguarding the rights" of their
 ethnic brothers on the island. The Panhellenic
 Socialist Movement and the United Left have
 urged the return of Archbishop Makarios. The
 Center  Union  urges a solution through inter-
 communal talks, while Karamanlis has been re-
 minding voters that a strong Greek government
 with a decisive policy is in the best position to
 handle the Turks.
 Punishment of those who supported the
 junta has been a key issue. Karamanlis has de-
 fused it somewhat by exiling the five key mem-
 bers of the junta that overthrew the civilian gov-
 ernment  in  1967 and  promising legal  action
 against them. He has avoided taking harsher
 measures in order not to alarm the army and the
 extreme right.
 Right-wing forces, represented by the Na-
 tional Democratic Union led by Petros Garou-
 falias, are unlikely to win more than 5 percent of
 the vote. They are apprehensive about the legal-
 ization of the Communist Party and other mea-
 sures they interpret as a leftward drift, but appear
 to be willing to give Karamanlis time to work
 things out. Although pro-junta forces cannot be
 completely discounted as potential perpetrators
 of a coup against Karamanlis, they probably lack
 sufficient support in the army to bring Kara-
 Sweden, Austria, and Switzerland have
 decided to join the US-backed International
 Energy Program but with certain conditions
 attached that relate to their neutrality. The
 decisions represent  an  important political
 milestone, given the fact that the neutrals
 have  heretofore consistently avoided align-
 ment with any politically committed group.
 Joining the program will mean a break with
 that tradition, even though it does not por-
 tend moves toward closer cooperation with
 Western   Europe on  political  and  security
 matters.
 The realities of the oil shortage and the
 memory of last winter's oil embargo com-
 pelled the three to give serious consideration
 to joining. Each is concerned, however, that
 its neutral status not be compromised. In or-
 der to soften the impact of an affirmative
 decision and to justify it domestically, the
 three are insisting that a neutrality statement
 be attached to final acceptance of member-
 ship. The neutrality declaration is not in-
 tended to act as an escape mechanism, and
 the three have promised to adhere strictly to
 the obligations of membership.
 The International Energy Program was
 developed by the Energy Coordinating Group
 established last February in Washington. Un-
 der the emergency plan, the US, Canada, Ja-
 pan, and  all  of the EC countries except
 France would share oil reserves and reduce
 energy consumption in the event of a future
 oil embargo or cutback in production. Eu-
 rope's other neutral, Finland, reportedly is
 studying the possibility of some sort of affilia-
 tion with the IEP, but will have to consider
 the likely Soviet reaction before making a
 manlis down. Nonetheless, the unofficial cam-
 paign slogan of New Democracy-"Karamanlis or
 the tanks"-is probably an effective reminder for
 the voter of the past seven years of military
 dictatorship.

 TURKEY: NEW PRIME MINISTER NAMED
 With the naming of Sadi Irmak as Prime
 Minister-designate, President Koruturk appears to
 have found a formula for breaking the eight-week-
 old political stalemate. Irmak, a political neutral,
 has begun a series of talks with leaders of Tur-
 key's major political parties in an effort to put
 together a broad coalition that will move the
 nation toward early elections next spring or sum-
 mer.
 The  breakthrough  apparently came after
 President Koruturk threatened to resign unless
 the party loaders reached agreement on forming a
 government. Democratic Party leader Bozbeyli
 then proposed a broad coalition government that
 would be headed by an independent and would
 exclude the participation of party leaders. Most
 of the party chiefs had rejected former Prime
 Minister Ecevit's call for early elections as a con-
 dition for a new government, but Koruturk re-
 portedly has persuaded them to accept that idea
 as well.
 tion" composed of all the major parties except
 the National Salvation Party, Ecevit's former
 coalition partner whose disruptive tactics brought
 about the current government crisis.
 The 70-year-old Irmak, who was inactive in
 politics for 24 years before he was named to the
 senate as a presidential appointee this year, will
 have difficulty molding this disparate group into a
 working government. His primary role will be to
 act as caretaker until new elections can be held
 that  will give one party or another a clear
 mandate to govern.
 Despite the preliminary approval the party
 leaders have given to this formula, Irmak still has
 several hurdles to clear. The formal process of
 organizing a government requires Irmak to:
 ? Name a full cabinet, which with presi-
 dential approval will become the acting gov-
 ernment of Turkey.
 ? Prepare a government program for sub-
 mission to parliament.
 ? Present this program for debate and a
 vote of confidence.
 There are a number of pitfalls along the way,
 particularly the distribution of cabinet portfolios.
 Although the agreement arranged by Koruturk
 reportedly calls for the coalition parties to share
 the posts on a basis proportional to their repre-
 sentation in parliament, disputes could arise over
 which parties will get the more prestigious assign-
 ments.  Irmak  could  also  run  into difficulty
 persuading parliament to go along with early elec-
 tions, inasmuch as many of the deputies will fear
 that Ecevit's national popularity-as a result of
 Cyprus-will carry his Republican People's Party
 to victory.
 Except for the right-wing National Salvation
 Party, there appears to be general agreement
 among Turkey's political leaders on policy toward  25X1

 policy is also seen as a way to induce France to
 join the international agency and to assure a role
 for the EC as an entity in the conference between
 producers, consumers, and developing countries
 that France has proposed.
 French President Giscard's bid for a confer-
 ence early next year to discuss oil prices caused
 embarrassment among Paris' EC partners. They
 have not wanted to rebuff a French initiative, and
 they share to some extent the French desire to
 avoid an atmosphere of "confrontation" with the
 Arab producers. Nevertheless, they know that the
 French plan would not adequately allow for the
 prior development of a consumer position, one of
 the principal aims of the US-backed international
 agency.
 France also wants a common EC policy that
 would, among other things, lay down guidelines
 for  restrictions  on  consumption  and for
 developing alternative energy sources. Most of
 France's partners may now be taking a friendlier
 look at EC Commission proposals along these
 lines, not  least  because agreement on  EC
 measures-even in a watered down form-could be
 hailed a success of the December summit of the
 Nine.
 French Foreign Minister Sauvagnargues him-
 self made an attempt at this week's ministerial EC
 political cooperation meeting to marry Paris' own
 earlier proposals with Commission proposals and
 to take account of responses to the conference
 idea. While calling for agreement by the summit
 on elements of an internal EC policy-deliberately
 left vague as to targets and dates in order to
 minimize possible opposition-the new proposal is
 more positive about the contribution the inter-
 national agency could make toward cooperation
 among consumer countries. In return, the French
 want the EC leaders to "note with satisfaction"
 France's proposal for the consumer-producer con-
 ference and to agree that the EC intends to
 participate in it as a single entity.

 By aiming at positive decisions at the December

 SPAIN: NEW' DEFENSE TIES WITH US
 Spanish negotiators formally advised a visit-
 ing US delegation last week that Madrid intends
 to seek a new defense relationship with the US.
 For some time the Spanish press has been citing
 the   inadequacy of the present agreement of
 friendship and cooperation that covers US use of
 base facilities in Spain. Suggested solutions have
 ranged from calls for a mutual defense treaty all
 the way to demands that the US get out.
 During the initial round of negotiations on
 renewing the present agreement that expires next
 September, the Spaniards stopped short of asking
 for a mutual defense treaty. Nevertheless, by em-
 phasizing  the  desirability  of joint  military
 planning and coordination of the Spanish defense
 role with that of the US and NATO, the Span-
 iards made it clear that a treaty is what they
 want.
 The Spaniards are trying to use the bilateral
 Declaration of Principles governing relations be-
 tween Spain and the US, which was signed in July
 to parallel the NATO declaration, as a lever to get
 a firmer defense tie. They argue that the declara-
 tion went beyond the provisions in the present
 agreement governing the use of defense facilities
 in Spain and signaled a stronger US commitment
 to grant the Spaniards the same treatment in the
 defense field as that accorded the NATO allies.
 Consequently they want the new agreement to
 incorporate the spirit of the declaration. The
 Spaniards argued that they could no longer justify
 to their people the increased threat to Spain
 brought on by the presence of US bases without
 being able to cite closer Spanish defense ties to
 the West.
 The principal US negotiator has asserted the
 willingness of the US to continue and strengthen
 defense . cooperation,  but argued that the US
 believes this could be accomplished within the
 framework of the current agreement.
 The next plenary session will be held early
 next month in Washington. The agenda will cover
 the nature of the defense relationship and closer
 coordination of Spain's defense planning with
 that of the West. The chief Spanish negotiator
 Page  8
 stated that these two items constituted the main
 concern of his government and would have to be
 agreed upon before Spain would consider two
 other items proposed for future meetings: renego-
 tiation of terms governing use of facilities pro-
 vided to the US as well as conditions governing
 their utilization, and renegotiation of the military
 quid pro quo.
 Two additional items were also proposed:
 economic,  technical,  and  cultural  coopera-
 tion-which will  be considered  by specialized
 study groups-and the composition and function-
 ing                                                                of  joint  institutions  to  administer    the
 agreement.
 At the December session the Spanish nego-
 tiators can be expected to make a strong pitch for
 a treaty in spite of US warnings of the difficulty
 of getting congressional ratification. This will re-
 flect sentiment expressed with growing frequency
 in the Spanish press that Madrid is negotiating
 from a position of strength. The installation of a
 leftist government in Portugal and the threat to
 the eastern flank of NATO created by the Cyprus
 crisis may have convinced Madrid that base rights
 in Spain are all the more vital to US interests and
 will enable Spain at long last to insist on the
 security treaty that many Spanish officials have

 ? Hawker-Siddeley decided to halt devel-
 opment work on the new four engine HS-146,
 a 70-100 passenger short-haul  feeder-line
 aircraft.
 These events are part of the general eco-
 nomic  uncertainty facing the civil aircraft in-
 dustry in Western Europe. Rising fuel costs and
 lagging traffic demand are cutting into the opera-
 tions of many international airlines, and the car-
 riers are reluctant to make commitments for addi-
 tional aircraft, either in Europe or elsewhere.
 Consequently, Europe's consortium and national
 aircraft programs have suffered, and the industry
 has kept going only because there are still back-
 logs of unfilled orders.
 Both  of Europe's major consortium air-
 craft- the Anglo-French Concorde and the Air-
 bus-are in trouble. Despite technological suc-
 cesses, mounting costs for the Concorde are se-
 verely limiting sales. French support-which in
 the past was unwavering-now appears in doubt.
 Some government officials have mentioned that
 any aircraft produced after the initial production
 run of 16 might cost $90 million. At the current
 $45-million price, which is triple the original esti-
 mate, only 9 Corcordes have been sold to the
 captive markets of Air France (4) and British
 Airways (5). Iran, which may buy 2 by the end of
 1974, is the only other country expected to pur-
 chase the aircraft in the near future.
 Orders for the A-300 Airbus-a joint effort
 of five European countries-have been poor. Sales
 were hurt by delays in early production schedules
 in 1969-70, allowing US manufacturers to get at
 least a two-year jump on deliveries of the similar
 widebodied McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lock-
 heed L-1011. These delays, coupled with lagging
 traffic, have limited sales over the past several
 years to 23 aircraft-less than one tenth of the
 estimated break-even point of 250. Despite this
 slow pace, however, many Europeans remain opti-
 mistic about the aircraft's long-term prospects.
 The  failure  of consortium  programs has
 undermined many of Europe's national civil air-
 craft activities. In France, problems have been
 compounded by a host of difficulties with new
 aircraft, including the 150-passenger Mercure, the
 feeder-liner Falcon 30, and the Corvette Exec jet.
 In the UK heavy costs involving the Concorde
 have  undermined  development  of  new  com-
 mercial aircraft and forced the industry to rely on
 existing orders for aircraft currently in produc-
 tion. West Germany and the Netherlands have
 benefited from lesser involvement in the major
 consortiums and met with some success in the    25X1
 jointly manufactured F-28 and the new VFW
 Fokker 614, both shorter range aircraft of a type
 not currently being produced elsewhere.

 ITALY: CRITICAL CROSSROADS
 The search for a new Italian government
 entered a decisive phase this week. Although
 there is no hope for reviving the center-left coali-
 tion in the immediate future, Foreign Minister
 Moro may secure agreement on a formula for a
 caretaker government that would keep the cen-
 ter-left alive in principle. His negotiations, how-
 ever, have left the dominant Christian Democrats
 in a difficult position.
 Moro, who leads the Christian Democratic
 left, is trying! to set up an all-Christian Democratic
 cabinet supported in parliament by the other
 coalition  parties.  During the postwar period,
 Italian  politicians frequently  resorted to this
 arrangement--the so-called "monocolore" govern-
 ment-to let the dust settle after a major political
 blowup. Such an administration would preserve a
 semblance of partnership among the parties and
 could pave the way for a later attempt to resusci-
 tate the center-left coalition, still the only work-
 able non-Communist government that can be
 drawn from the present parliament.
 Among the former coalition partners, only
 the Social Democrats refuse to support such a
 solution. The Social Democrats have maintained
 throughout the six-week-old crisis that any gov-
 ernment relying on Socialist support would be
 "open to the Communists"; they now insist that
 the loose structure of a "monocolore" administra-
 tion would make it doubly vulnerable to Commu-
 nist influence.
 The Socialists and the other parties are play-
 ing down the Communist issue, and Moro would
 like to put the matter on ice for the time being.
 He wants to first nail down an agreement on
 economic policy; the parties are close to a com-
 promise on bread-and-butter issues.
 Moro would just as soon dump the Social
 Democrats if they remain adamant in the face of
 agreement among the other parties on economic
 policy. The key question  is whether he can
 persuade the rest of his party to take such a step.
 Although  Social  Democratic  support  is  not
 needed for a majority, the Christian Democrats
 have kept them in the cabinet to dilute Socialist
 influence.
 Dropping the Social Democrats from the
 parliamentary majority of a caretaker government
 could establish a precedent for excluding them
 from the next center-left coalition-a move that
 would inevitably strengthen the influence of the
 Socialists and give the coalition a more leftist
 complexion.
 Moro appears to have qualified support from
 Christian Democratic boss Fanfani, and this could
 tip the balance against the Social Democrats.
 There is still resistance to the idea, however, in
 the party's key center faction and among right-
 wing Christian Democrats.
 All of this means that the Christian Dem-
 ocrats may have to choose the lesser of two evils.
 If they jettison  the  Social  Democrats, they
 eventually  will have  to  yield  more  of  the
 perquisites of power to the Socialists. If, instead,
 they side with the Social Democrats against the
 Socialists, they will not be able to muster a
 center-left majority. At that point, the only thing
 standing between the Christian Democrats and
 new elections-in which they would probably lose
 votes-would be a right-leaning coalition including
 the small, conservative Liberal Party. Although it
 is a numerical possibility, such a coalition could
 not govern effectively or for long against the
 opposition of the Socialists, Communists, and
 labor unions.
 The Communists are lying low. They have
 little to  lose  no  matter  what the Christian
 Democrats decide. The Communists prefer to
 avoid an electoral battle now, but if it came they
 would probably do well. On the other hand, if the
 Social Democrats end up in the opposition, the
 number of anti-Communist voices in the  iov-

 The 57th anniversary of the Bolshevik Rev-
 olution last week brought forth the traditional
 speeches and ceremonies, and few surprises. For-
 eign Minister Gromyko-representing the Polit-
 buro-delivered the major address on November
 6. He concentrated on a routine cataloguing of
 Soviet foreign policy accomplishments and posi-
 tions, replete with flattering references to Brezh-
 nev. His moderately optimistic remarks included a
 statement that the USSR favors agreement with
 the US on halting the quantitative and qualitative
 arms races. He said the Soviets will strive to make
 the Vladivostok summit a meeting of great impor-
 tance to the continued improvement of US-Soviet
 relations.
 Gromyko called again for an early conclu-
 sion to the European Security Conference, imply-
 ing that a successful outcome in Geneva is a
 prerequisite to progress at the Vienna force reduc-
 tion                 negotiations.  He was particularly pleased
 with the state of Soviet relations with France,
 West Germany, Finland, and India among the
 non-Communist nations and exhorted Japan to
 match Soviet overtures of good will.
 Turning to the Middle East, he reaffirmed
 Soviet support for Palestinian statehood and pre-
 dicted that Brezhnev's visit to Egypt in January
 would be of "tremendous significance."
 Gromyko reiterated earlier Soviet accusa-
 tions that China's leaders have aligned themselves
 with the enemies of detente and against the So-
 viet                                                                      Union  and the socialist community. His
 tough statement provoked a walkout by the Chi-
 nese ambassador, a ritual occurrence in recent
 years. Gromyko's speech preceded by four hours
 a Chinese broadcast of greetings to the Soviet
 government, a message containing an unexpected
 proposal for dealing with the Sino-Soviet border
 dispute.
 On November 7, Defense Minister Grechko
 made a brief speech in Red Square prior to the
 traditional parade. He acknowledged the reduced
 threat of nuclear war, but pledged to defend the
 gains of socialism against the "forces of interna-
 tional reaction" which, he said, have not laid
 down their arms. He expressed satisfaction with
 the Soviet armed forces and assured his listeners
 that the Soviet party and government are paying
 urgent attention to strengthening the country's
 defenses.

 The military parade included no new weap-
 ons systems. The civilian portion was canceled,
 apparently at the last moment, with inclement
 weather given as the reason. This unusual step
 may have been taken to guard the health of aging
 Politburo members, most of whom were review-
 ing the proceedings from atop Lenin's tomb.
 Early this week the Soviets suffered another
 failure in their program for obtaining soil samples
 from   the  moon.  The  Luna  23  spacecraft-
 launched  from Tyuratam on October 28-was
 damaged nine days later while landing on the
 moon in rough terrain, according to a Tass state-
 ment. As a result, the drilling device designed to
 collect the samples failed to operate. The drill, a
 modification of earlier designs, was intended to
 collect lunar rock from a depth of as much as
 nine feet-considerably deeper than past missions.
 The Soviets continue to have difficulty land-
 ing spacecraft of this sort on the moon. Of the
 five soil-sampling spacecraft that have reached the
 moon, only two-Luna 16 in September 1970 and
 Luna 20 in February 1972-landed intact  col-
 lected samples, and returned to earth.
 The failure of Luna 23 is but one of many in
 the Soviet lunar space program. Of the 51 moon-
 related space probes launched since the fall of
 1958, only 19 have been successful. Soviet per-
 formance has been improving in recent years,
 however.  Seven  of the  nine lunar spacecraft
 launched since October 1970 have performed
 well. These successes include the two soil col-
 lection missions, one circumlunar and two orbit-
 ing missions, and exploration by two Lunokhod
 rover vehicles. The Soviets appear to be ex-
 panding the scope of their Lunar program, which
 is expected to continue at least through the end
 of the decade. A manned lunar landing by the
 Soviets may still be planned. but is unlikely be-
 fore 1980.
 The government personnel shifts announced
 on October 31 reflect Sofia's continued concern
 over ideology and the economy. The changes
 seem to have been designed to give the Bulgarian
 Council of State new responsibilities in these two
 areas.
 Two deputy premiers-Ivan Popov and Petur
 Tanchev-were transferred  to vice presidential
 slots on the State Council. Popov, a noted scien-
 tist who advocates greater use of Western tech-
 nology to modernize the economy, is a trusted
 adviser of Zhivkov, who is also the council's chair-
 man.
 Tanchev was deputy premier for agriculture,
 and he may retain this responsibility on the coun-
 cil. He is also the working head of the Agrarian
 Union, the so-called opposition party, and his
 transfer may be intended to give substance to the
 contention that the council is, in fact, the "cor-
 porate head of state" it was designed to be when
 created in 1971.
 Among the other changes, Mitko Grigorov,
 the party's former ultraconservative ideologue,
 was promoted from member to vice president of
 the council, and Evgeni Mateev, a talented econo-
 mist, was made a member. Neither man has been
 among Zhivkov's friends, and their promotions
 will probably lead to speculation that the move
 was a concession to a faction within the party
 leadership. It is more likely, however, that their
 assignments were part of the effort to strengthen
 the council rather than the result of political
 infighting. In any case, none of the changes af-
 fects the balance in the top party leadership.
 The new appointments also preserve the
 balance of the Council of State's membership,
 which from the outset has embraced representa-
 tives of all sectors of Bulgarian society. In addi-
 tion to its protocol and ceremonial duties, the
 council will probably now become more deeply
 involved in the day-to-day running of the coun-
 try. It may take some of the burden off the
 Council of Ministers for supervising local and    25X1
 district administrations. Up until now, the Coun-
 cil of State and Council of Ministers have shared
 this responsibility.

 WHITHER THE OAS?
 The practical and political consequences of
 this week's OAS vote on the proposal to rescind
 the sanctions against Cuba, which fell two short
 of the needed  two-thirds majority, will be a
 mixed bag. The final tally-12 for, 3 against, and
 6 abstentions--provides certain domestic satisfac-
 tions for all the delegates. The 12, which either
 already have diplomatic relations with Havana or
 want that option open, now feel that their obliga-
 tion to respect the sanctions has been wiped out
 by the recorded opposition of a clear majority of
 the OAS members. The three voting against the
 proposal  took home a major and unexpected
 diplomatic  coup,  since  it  had  been  widely
 assumed that the sanctions would be rescinded.
 The six have offended no particular portion of
 their constituencies.
 The outcome, however, deals a hard blow to
 the OAS, which was already considered by many
 a weak and unresponsive organization. It is too
 early to measure the damage to the dialogue
 established this year between the US and Latin
 America, but many governments are making no
 Page  13
 secret of their unhappiness with the neutral posi-
 tion of the US throughout the Quito conference.
 Various delegates left with a particular sense
 of defeat or concern. Costa Rica's foreign minis-
 ter, one of the sponsors of the aborted resolution,
 suffers the special embarrassment of having given
 personal assurances that he had the required two-
 thirds majority wrapped up. The Ecuadoreans, as
 hosts, will be chagrined that "Quito" stands, in
 many minds in the hemisphere, for an inter-
 American debacle. The Argentines, who are set to
 host the next scheduled foreign ministers' meet-
 ing  next  March,  are  probably  particularly
 unnerved. They were given the task of polling the
 Latin and Caribbean governments on whether
 Cuba should  be invited to the Buenos Aires
 meeting.
 Fidel Castro was sitting pretty no matter
 what the result of Quito. He could have played a
 vote to lift the sanctions as a vindication of Cuba.
 But he is probably even more pleased to have the
 sanctions juridically  in  effect but flouted  in

 BOLIVIA: ELECTIONS CANCELED
 President Banzer has temporarily strength-
 ened his position by using last week's abortive
 coup attempt as justification for banning political
 activities and canceling the national elections set
 for next June. Even before the small insurrection
 occurred  in  an  outlying  province,  however,
 Banzer reportedly had the consent of his military
 commanders to call off the elections.
 Last Thursday, Banzer quickly put down a
 rebellion by a few dissident politicians and an
 army infantry unit in the provincial capital of
 Santa Cruz,  located approximately 350 miles
 southeast of La Paz. The fact that Banzer per-
 sonally commanded reinforcements in restoring
 order indicated that he had full confidence in his
 senior military advisers who  remained in the
 capital.
 SOVIET SHIPS LEAVE CUBA
 The small Soviet naval group that had
 been in the Caribbean during the past eight
 weeks left Cuba on November 10. The ships-
 two Kresta-class guided-missile cruisers and an
 oiler---are now southeast of Bermuda and will
 probably cruise the western Mediterranean for
 a short time before returning home to North-
 ern Fleet waters.
 During the Cuban stay-the 12th such
 visit since 1969-the Soviet ships made visits
 to Havana and Cienfuegos. Unlike other re-
 cent visits, there was only a minimum of joint
 activity with  the Cuban  navy, probably
 because no Soviet submarines were included
 Banzer then announced that elections would
 be postponed until at least 1980. In his speech he
 sought to emulate other military strong men in
 South America by stating that the government
 intends to fulfill its mission of national recon-
 struction. Although development policies have
 consisted largely of empty promises and rhetor-
 ical flourishes, this stance makes Banzer look
 good when compared with his disorganized and
 inept opponents.
 Banzer has taken other measures to stabilize
 his government. Official charges of subversion
 against two cabinet ministers, who had been in-
 volved in previous moves against the President,
 have resulted in a minor cabinet reshuffle.
 Military support has rallied behind the gov-
 ernment for the time being, but Banzer now de-
 pends solely upon the good will of his generals for
 his political survival. They have previously told
 him that he must soon step down in favor of an
 acceptable  military  replacement.  The  current
 front-runner is General Juan Lechin, the second
 highest official in the government. If Banzer balks
 at stepping down, the members of the high com-   25X1
 mand will probably abandon their current efforts
 at achieving an orderly transfer of power and
 in the latest group. In the past, the surface
 ships usually were accompanied by a sub-
 marine, which acted as a target for Cuban
 patrol  boat  training.  Although  two  sub-
 marines were observed trailing the Krestas
 across the Atlantic en route to Cuba, the
 Soviets apparently changed sailing orders as
 the submarines neared the Caribbean, and the
 two units returned to home waters. No fur-
 ther information has become available regard-
 ing this change in plan.
 If the Soviets follow the pattern of the
 past two years, another naval task group will
 visit Cuba next spring.

 China-USSR
 PEKING PROPOSES NONAGGRESSION PACT
 Last week Peking surfaced a proposal for
 dealing with the Sino-Soviet border dispute. The
 proposal, contained in a message to the Soviets on
 the occasion of the anniversary of their October
 Revolution, called for a pact renouncing aggres-
 sion and the use of force, a mutual troop pullback
 from disputed border areas, measures to avert
 conflicts, and maintenance of the status quo of
 the border itself.
 The Chinese had made a similar proposal in
 private during the early rounds of border talks in
 1969, but had never before publicly urged a non-
 aggression pact. Peking had greeted earlier and
 well-publicized Soviet calls for such a pact with
 public silence and private contempt. The Chinese
 have consistently argued that any nonaggression
 and nonuse-of-force pact would have to be ac-
 companied by a withdrawal of Soviet forces from
 the frontier, a position that the Soviets have
 categorically  rejected. Because this linkage re-
 mains in the new Chinese proposal, Peking almost
 certainly expected that Moscow would find the
 package unacceptable.
 There were other indications that the pro-
 posal was a tactical maneuver. Chinese diplomats
 were quick to scotch speculation that the package
 signaled an upturn in Sino-Soviet relations, point-
 ing out to American and Japanese diplomats that
 the proposal contained nothing new. The message
 still has not been replayed by the New China
 News Agency nor has it been broadcast inside
 China, something Peking would almost certainly
 do in case of a major new development in Sino-
 Soviet relations. The substance and tone of
 Chinese and Soviet propaganda directed at one
 another, moreover, have not changed in any way
 since the proposal was made.
 Moscow maintained official silence on the
 substance of the package and has withheld publi-
 cation of Chinese terms for agreement. Soviet
 spokesmen have privately claimed that Peking has
 not offered anything new and that border talks
 can resume whenever Peking presents a fresh
 proposal. The Soviets are probably reluctant to
 make any authoritative response until they can
 determine  whether  Peking  intended  anything
 Soviet border guards along the Ussuri River
 more in publicizing its proposal than to gain some
 propaganda advantage.
 In their message to the Chinese on PRC
 National Day, the Soviets included references to
 their own proposals for lowering Sino-Soviet ten-
 sions. The Chinese, not to be outdone in this
 display of flexibility, have replied in kind. In a
 clear  public  relations  gesture,  moreover,  the
 Chinese embassy in Moscow took special pains to
 distribute the full text of the proposal to foreign
 embassies  and  news  services  there   after the
 Soviets had published it only in censored form.
 The Chinese may hope to enhance their
 leverage both with the US and USSR by con-
 veying an impression of a more forthcoming
 attitude regarding the Sino-Soviet dispute and by
 implying that China is less concerned about the
 Soviet threat than it was a few years ago. By
 appearing accommodating, Peking also probably
 hopes to create a favorable impression among
 foreign Communist parties and complicate Soviet
 efforts to organize an international Communist

 out preconditions. The South Vietnamese initia-
 tive was, in effect, the government's response to a
 Viet Cong statement on October 8 that called for
 the removal of President Thieu as a precondition
 for resuming negotiations and implementing the
 Paris Agreement. The Communists quickly re-
 jected Saigon's initiative, characterizing it as a
 "deceptive move"  designed to confuse public
 opinion. Viet Cong officials in Saigon and Paris
 repeated their demands of October 8 and main-
 tained that there would be no new talks as long as
 Thieu remains in office. Hanoi's party journals
 quickly publicized the Viet Cong rejection.
 Political talks between the two sides were
 suspended by the South Vietnamese in April fol-
 lowing the North Vietnamese capture of a ranger
 outpost north of Saigon. At that time, the govern-
 ment sharply curtailed the privileges of the Viet
 Cong and North Vietnamese military delegations
 in Saigon, which in turn led to a Communist
 walkout from the Saigon military talks. These
 discussions were resumed by the two sides in
 June, following the government's restoration of
 privileges to the Communist delegations, but they
 were quickly broken off again  by the Com-
 munists.
 erally moderate to low level of action continues
 throughout most of the rest of the country. The
 usual  Communist midmonth mini-highpoint in
 the delta went off, but the action was spotty and
 concentrated in several areas. In Vinh Long Prov-
 ince--one of the hardest hit areas--at least ten
 government outposts were lost and several roads
 interdicted, necessitating the movement of troops
 of the 7th Division into the province for the first
 time in several months.
 Deteriorating weather conditions and heavy
 casualties on both sides have somewhat slowed
 the ongoing battles for a number of strategic
 high-ground positions in the northern provinces.
 Several of these positions have been retaken by
 government forces, but the South Vietnamese 1st
 Division has been  unable to make significant
 progress against Communist forces dug in just
 south of Hue. The regional commander is con-
 templating moving in fresh combat units to help
 out, because he considers these positions  vital to
 the defense of the lowlands south of the city.
 The current lull in fighting in the central
 provinces can best be described as an intermission
 for the opposing forces while the monsoon moves
 to the coast and the highlands begin to dry out.
 The latest South Vietnamese move meshes
 neatly with  other recent actions of President
 Thieu designed to answer the charges of his polit-
 ical opposition. By placing the onus for the pres-
 ent lack of movement on negotiations squarely on
 Hanoi, Thieu no doubt hopes to undermine the
 efforts of Buddhist dissidents to exploit public
 frustration over the continuing hostilities and the
 ineffectiveness of the Paris Agreement. Neither
 Buddhist nor Catholic opposition leaders have as
 yet reacted to Saigon's  call for the resumption
 of negotiations. Opposition activity continued at
 a low level during the week with protests con-
 fined to rallies  and meetings in pagodas and
 churches.
 Communist: military activity picked up early
 ~n  the week in the delta provinces, but the gen-
 The South Vietnamese thus far have been
 successful  in  blunting  Communist   efforts  to
 establish  a  commanding  high-ground position
 overlooking the North Vietnamese supply route
 in the An Lao Valley of Binh Dinh Province.
 There    has  been  an  increase  in  Communist
 harassment      and interdiction  of  key  roads,
 especially the lateral routes from the lowlands to
 the highlands and north-south Route 1.
 The military scene also remains reasonably
 quiet in the provinces around Saigon with the
 Communists continuing their terrorist and sapper
 attacks.  Most  of  the  Communist  main-force
 combat units are being refurbished for dry-season
 action while COSVN is restructuring and stream-
 lining its command and control structure.          I 25X1

 1*0010,
 A statement by Chairman Mao Tse-tung-in
 a recently issued central directive-that the Cul-
 tural Revolution has gone on long enough under-
 scores the focus on political unity that typifies
 Peking's current propaganda line. Mao adds that
 the time  is ripe for convening the National
 People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parlia-
 ment; in fact, preparations for the congress are
 well under way. A corollary to the damping down
 of political struggle has been an emphasis on
 production, and both themes have been forcefully
 expressed in a series of central directives going
 back to July. As a whole, these developments
 show that moderate elements retain the upper
 hand in Peking.
 The political and policy trend since last sum-
 mer has been displeasing to Mao's left-leaning
 wife, Chiang Ching. Arrangements for the suc-
 cession to the party chairmanship have apparently
 been  completed. Despite Chiang Ching's most
 recent attempts to portray herself as Mao's suc-
 cessor--expressed in the form of media articles on
 an historical empress who ruled China after the
 death  of  her  husband-youthful  party  vice-
 chairman Wang Hung-wen appears to be the one
 designated. Moreover, two of Chiang Ching's Cul-
 tural Revolution opponents seem to have the suc-
 cession to the premiership locked up between
 them. The madame has not made much headway
 with her ambitions.
 In fact, she may have slipped a little. A
 Chiang Ching was  e in
 a move to put    inese women in skirts, but
 surprisingly went on to criticize the idea as not
 necessary and not good for China. But most sig-
 nificant has been Madame Mao's obvious inability
 to take advantage of Chou En-lai's serious health
 problems. Chiang can still hurl propaganda barbs
 and make her weight felt in the cultural sphere,
 but she and her ultraleftist supporters appear to
 have  been  outmaneuvered,  at  least  for  the
 present.
 The rehabilitation of officials purged during
 the Cultural Revolution continues, and a reported
 central directive ordering the abolition of revolu-
 tionary committees, if carried out, seems sure to
 offend leftist sensitivities. Established in 1967,
 the committees still symbolize leftist Cultural
 Revolution ideals and have been the object of a
 political tug of war for some time. An earlier move
 to replace these committees with people's coun-
 cils, the pre - Cultural Revolution organs of gov-
 ernment control, was allowed to lapse after the
 campaign to criticize Lin and Confucius began in
 August 1973.
 While the anti-Lin, anti-Confucius campaign
 is now apparently being phased out, factional
 differences, although they may be muted, will not
 disappear. A period of relative calm will probably
 ensue and improvements in production and social
 order in several provinces may well result, but the
 political contestants will keep their hatchets close
 at hand. In particular, Chiang Ching and her left-
 ist allies will remain vigilant for an opening, and   25X1
 current succession arrangements, no matter how
 clearly defined, will be tested when the time
 comes for them to be put into effect.

 President Ford will be visiting Japan next
 week at a rather turbulent time. A controversy
 over the alleged presence of US nuclear weapons
 in Japan has generated some opposition to the
 President's visit. Moreover, Prime Minister Tanaka
 is in the midst of a political crisis stemming from
 charges of financial corruption.
 These issues, along with continuing high in-
 flation, will be the subject of demonstrations and
 strikes while the President is in Japan. But there
 are mitigating factors:
 scheduled for days when the President will not be
 in the city. Socialist leaders are now saying that
 they do not intend to harm good relations be-
 tween the US and Japan, but are opposing the
 visit solely out of fear that it will lead to a
 stronger military alliance between the two coun-
 tries. Opinion polls, meanwhile, show a majority
 favoring the visit, and Japan's major news dailies
 weighed in late last week with supporting editori-
 als. In short, a consensus is developing that a
 courteous reception is in order, and a massive
 security effort by the Japanese police should con-
 tain any attempts by radical youth groups to
 cause problems.
 ? Protest activities will be orderly and will
 cause a minimum of disruption.
 ?  Most  Japanese  political  groups,  the
 press, and a large majority of the public wel-
 come the President's visit.
 A Besieged Tanaka
 ? Although Tanaka may well resign before
 the end of the year, he and his rivals within
 the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have de-
 clared a truce until the President's visit is
 over.
 The Current Atmosphere
 During November, a more favorable atmo-
 sphere for the President's visit has been develop-
 ing, and opposition groups have trimmed their
 scheduled activities accordingly. Last week, one
 opposition party withdrew from further demon-
 strations against the President, and others have
 yet to agree on a unified effort.
 The major groups still opposing the visit-the
 Communists, Socialists, and the largest labor fed-
 eration-are committed to holding demonstra-
 tions, but they are emphasizing their nonviolent
 character. The themes they will stress, moreover,
 focus more on inflation and Tanaka rather than
 on the US and the President's visit.
 In an effort to avoid a sense of confronta-
 tion over the trip, the major rallies in Tokyo are

 South Korea's economy is in its first pro-
 nounced slump in over a decade. Although real
 growth in 1974 will amount to 8 to 10 percent,
 most of the gain came during the first six months.
 The growth will continue slow well into 1975.
 Although the long-term outlook remains bright,
 near-term prospects have dimmed because of the
 continued  economic  downturn  projected  for
 major Western  industrial  nations  that take the
 bulk of Korean exports. In the past, brisk foreign
 sales have been the basis of Korea's rapid eco-
 nomic growth.
 Industrial output through June was more
 than 25 percent above last year's average, but has
 dropped since then.  The downturn  has been
 limited so far to a few consumer-oriented export
 industries. Hardest hit are the  labor-intensive
 textile, clothing, plywood, and electronics in-
 dustries. Heavy industry, in contrast, continues to
 do relatively well.
 Unemployment, although not yet serious, is
 rising. Some 100,000 workers have been laid off
 so far this year, a cut of some 6 percent of the
 manufacturing work force. The unemployment
 burden has thus far been borne mainly by young
 women rather than male heads of households.
 Korea Exchange Bank in Seoul
 Nevertheless, labor unrest in the cities is growing
 as inflation cuts deeper into real income, and
 unemployment threatens to increase. In response,
 the government is encouraging businesses to re-
 duce work hours rather than cut payrolls, and will
 back generous pay hikes even at the risk of aggra-
 vating inflationary pressures next year. Labor is
 pushing for hefty wage increases as pay boosts
 this year have generally not kept pace with the
 rising cost of living-consumer prices have already
 risen 25 percent this year despite subsidized food
 prices.
 Seoul has also shifted from curbing inflation
 to bolstering output and employment. This year's
 budget, which showed a surplus through Septem-
 ber, is now in deficit, and next year's budget
 provides for substantially greater spending on de-
 fense, industrial projects, public works, and wel-
 fare. Seoul is also extending loans to financially
 pressed small- and medium-sized firms to help
 avoid a rash of bankruptcies and is offering loans
 to hard-hit larger firms in labor-intensive indus-
 tries to help them maintain employment levels.
 Sluggish export growth and soaring import
 costs-the oil import bill has tripled this year to
 around $1 billion-has sharply increased the trade
 deficit. As a result, the current payments deficit
 will reach some $1.5 billion, or five times last
 year's deficit. With direct foreign investments
 sharply off last year's pace, Korea has stepped up
 its foreign borrowing, especially short-term cred-
 its. Korea's good international credit rating and
 relatively low debt service burden have enabled it
 to meet its financing needs.
 For next year, Seoul hopes to reduce short-
 term borrowing by obtaining more long-term cap-
 ital, although this may prove difficult. As a pre-
 caution, besides borrowing from its usual lenders,
 Seoul is seeking increased credits from the Inter-
 national Monetary Fund and Middle East oil pro-
 ducers. Seoul has attracted a $20-million loan
 from Abu Dhabi thus far. Direct foreign invest-
 ments are likely to pick up next year, however, as
 several leading US and Japanese firms are going
 ahead with investment clans involving over $800

 OPEC countries will earn more than $105
 billion and actually receive about $94 billion
 from oil exports in 1974. The difference results
 from an average two-month lag in payments by
 oil companies to the producing countries. The
 bulk of 1974 OPEC oil receipts will be concen-
 trated in the last half of this year-$60 billion,
 compared with  $34 billion  in  the first half.
 Second half receipts will reflect all of the January
 and most of the July price increases and are
 inflated by an additional $10 billion in retroactive
 payments resulting from nationalization moves.
 The bulk of OPEC oil receipts in 1974 will
 go to relatively few countries. The two largest
 producers, Saudi Arabia and Iran, will receive
 about $43 billion, over two thirds in the second
 half of the year. Together, the five largest pro-
 ducers-Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nigeria, Venezuela,
 and Kuwait-will account for over 70 percent of
 total OPEC revenue this year.
 OPEC oil receipts should decline when the
 retroactive payments are completed early next
 year. Any further price increases will be partly
 offset by decreased  demand.  If present pro-
 duction and prices are maintained, oil payments
 in the first quarter of 1975 would total $26.9
 billion-almost  $4 billion below the level  of
 receipts in the third and fourth quarters of 1974.
 Even if currently anticipated price hikes are in-
 stituted, payments will still drop by about $2
 billion for the first quarter of 1975.
