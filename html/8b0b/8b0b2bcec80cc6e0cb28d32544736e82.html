 SUMMARY
 The general campaign to increase production and effect greater economies in the use
 of labor and materials has been further intensified, but with the major stress
 'upon the elimination of waste and corruption from all phases of the national economy.
 Widely publicized country-wide meetings and rallies of workers and of all echelons
 of Party and cadre personnel emphasize the need for reforms in labor techniques
 and in ideological orientation.  There was continuing attention to the ideological
 failings of teachers, religious groups, and intellectuals in general.  Certain
 indications were noted of the abandonment of further widespread land redistribution
 and of steps toward the collectivization of agriculture.  The end of the arms-
 donation drive keyed to the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Campaign was officially
 announced with the admission that there were some failures to fulfill pre-established
 quotas.

 INCREASED PRODUCTION AND AUSTERITY
 Development of Drive:  During the period under review the Chinese Communist radio
 increased the number of its references to increased production and austerity.  Every
 domestic transmission from Peking or one of the regional stations had something to
 say about the drive, and numerous times an entire broadcast was devoted to the
 subject.  The general impression was that the ponderous Chinese machine powered by
 the Communist Party and the Central People's Government was straining every muscle
 to crush the last vestiges of "waste, corruption and bureaucracy."  A detailed
 examination of the content of this huge volume of radio ballyhoo revealed however,
 that perhaps the drive was enjoying very little success.  The chief activity in
 connection with the drive seems to be the holding of meetings.  They ranged from a
 cadre meeting in the Yencheng Power Plant, Kiangsu, reported by Yangchow (7 Jan.),
 at which the cadres "studied documents relating to waste, corruption and bureaucracy,"
 to meetings of Party and Government officials on the provincial level, with provincial
 governors present and making speeches.  Provincial meetings were reported from
 Shantung, Kiangsu, Chekiang, Kwangsi, Kwangtung, Hunan, Yunnan, Anhwei and Fukien.
 Dairen (7 Jan.) reported a "businessmen's rally" attended by 1,900.  Shanghai (2 Jan.)
 said that cadres of the 3d Field Army of the East China Military Control Commission
 held a rally.  Most of these meetings were held to "map plans" for the campaign,
 and the main idea seemed to be to inspire the cadres and impress them with the
 necessity of ridding themselves and "the masses" of "erroneous thoughts," so that
 the drive to eliminate waste and corruption would have a chance for success.
 A few instances of more positive action were reported.  Foochow (8 Jan.) announced
 that at a meeting of the Fukien Department of Trade cadres 4 January, with 140
 present, six inspection committees were organized "to make a check-up of the province's
 trading organizations."  Wuhan (6 Jan.) reported that Canton had organized 40
 government cadres into inspection teams to "check on activities of various government
 offices."  Dairen (7 Jan.) announced inauguration of the People's Inspection
 Committee. Hankow (6 Jan.) said that the Wuhan Tax Bureau had begun the "democratic
 check-up movement" to wipe out bureaucracy in its offices.  Hangchow (2 Jan.)
 announced that after two months of preparation an Enterprises Bureau had been set
 up in the city government to "head all public-operated enterprises in Hangchow and
 others concerned with production."  Chungking (6 Jan.) reported that the .Szechwan
 Government had issued a directive calling upon all chu and hsien governments to
 set up special committees, and carefully outlining the duties and responsibilities
 of the groups.
 The Peking Home Service (28 Dec.) announced that the Trade Ministry had directed
 all department stores and retail shops to reduce prices during New Year and Chinese
 New Year celebrations,  Chungking (30 Dec.) said directives had been issued in
 Szechwan to "prevent the usual upsurge of prices" during the holidays.  Foochow
 (6 Jan,) reported that the Fuan Trading Company was buying up surplus rice to
 maintain the price, which last fall tumbled from 80,000 to 50,000 yuan a tan, and
 thus prevent waste.
 Llaims of Succeasg  The Chinese Communist radio has related innumerable- success stories
 in connection with the drive to increase production and eliminate waste.  In some of
 these the claims are weak, and In others elaboration on the successes has revealed
 parallel failures.  For instance, Peking in numeral code (3 Jan.) announced that in the
 Northeast the total value of all industrial and agricultural production in 1951
 increased 13.5 percent over 1950, while the increase in State-operated industries
 under the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government was 31 percent.
 Obviously the increase in production in plants not controlled by the Northeast
 Industrial Department could not have been large.  Agricultural production increased
 only 3.3 percent, and reached only 98.1 percent of the production plan for the year.
 Mukden (7 Jan.) reported that the Northeast Industrial Department had urged power
 plants to make use of the lower grades of coal produced locally and to "continue
 experiments for producing power with such coal." Mukden also announced (6 Jan.)
 that the Northeast Industrial Department had ordered industry to conserve on the use
 pf cement, "a war material."  The broadcast added that the Construction Materials
 3ureau had tested 23 substitutes for cement, found five suitable, and is now
 pushing the use of a new substitute that has been "proved by Soviet experience."

 Hangchow (8 Jan.) claimed an increase in business in the Kashing branch of the China
 Merchandise Company and accredited the gain to the fact the cadres had "changed
 their conservative ideas."  Hangchow also said (28 Dec.) that in the post offices
 efficiency had greatly increased because workers had adopted the "Koralev method."
 Another Hangchow broadcast (29 Dec.) reported that the Chekiang General Merchandise
 Company had increased sales to 5 million yuan daily in many villages  and had done
 this by organizing 55 traveling stores to bring goods to rural areas. Still another
 Hangchow broadcast (6 Jan.) announced that workers in the Liming Textile Mills,
 Chiangtung, Yin Hsien, Chekiang, had organized a committee to test all cloth pro-
 cessed for Government orders, and out of the 2,300 bolts of cloth taken by the
 Government since the committee was set up, only 4 have been refused.  Hanchow also
 reported (4 Jan.) that the deputy manager of a silk factory had saved a large amount
 of money by adoption of a new method for drying silkworms.
 Shanghai (27 Dec.) reported remarkable cuts in expenses by Shantung Provincial
 offices during November.  For the month the office expenses totaled 1,339,090,000
 yuan, as compared with an average of 8,896,200,000 for the first 10 months of the
 year.  This huge saving came about through a reduction in the use of gasoline, which
 was cut 30 to 37 percent, and cuts in expenses for meetings, repairs, new equipment,
 and in such miscellaneous expenses as postal telegraph.
 Canton (8 Jan.) claimed that production in city factories had increased greatly
 because of "democratic reforms" and "elimination of reactionary elements."   Hankow
 (8 Jan.) reported a workers' rally in the Changkiang Cigarette Factory "in support
 of democratic reforms," and claimed that the traditional rivalry between Hupeh and
 Hunan workmen had been eliminated.  Dairen (4 Jan.) reported that workers at the
 20th Plant in that city had come forward with 677 "rational proposals" during the
 fourth quarter of 1951.
 Kaifeng (5 Jan.) reported that in Wei Hsien, Honan, cadres had organized a "democratic
 inspection committee" and planned to cut costs by reducin  the use of electricity,
 stationery, oil and printing.  Another Kaifeng broadcast (7 Jan.) said that cadres
 in Loshan Hsien, Honan, would launch a campaign against superstitions during the
 Spring F-_:stival (Lunar New Year) holidays by getting people to make patriotic
 donations of the money usually spent on "superstitious offerings."  Chungking
 reported that the Yunnan People's Government, following a meeting 25 Deceber,(hadan.)
 ordered all offices to stop immediately the purchase or construction of buildings,
 the holding of meetings, the making of gifts or contributions, and "other wasteful
 practices."
 Wuhan (3 Jan.) asserted that in the smelting plant of the Hunan Construction
 Company new workers have increased their operations from 28 to 90 crucibles a?month.
 This was made possible because "feudalistic elements" have been driven from the
 mines and industries of Hunan.  At the Hsinhsiang Coal Mines 272 workers have been
 given     responsible positions; in the Hunan steel mills and tin mines workers have
 been made supervisors after a period of training; and in the entire province 1,734
 workers have been placed in responsible positions.  Wuhan said (31 Dec.)' that the
 Property Control Bureau of the Finance Department of the Kwangtung People's Govern-
 ment has collected 35 million yuan worth of scrap and enemy-abandoned several thousand tons more of scrap can be collected.  Much ofathenscrap chasebeennd
 turned over to factories as raw material, and some of the machines have been put
 to work following reconditioning.  Wuhan (30 Dec.) announced that the Central.and
 South China Joint Transportation Company was organized 1 November with various
 branch offices, with resulting economies in transportation.  Most private trans-
 portation concerns have been pooled at Changsha as a result of the proper leader-
 ship exerted by the Hunan Joint Transportation Company.
 Peking in numeral code (4 Jan.) made an example of the Chiaotso Colliery, a State-
 operated concern.  In drawing up a higher production plan for 1952, the management
 had set a quota 13.4 billion yuan above the production figure for 1951, the leading
 cadres feeling that production had been good, but that this increase could be
 obtained with little trouble.  The "wrong thoughts of the cadres" changed with the

 arrival of Fuel Industries Minister Chen Yu. Director Chien Chu-chang and Security
 Section Chief Pi Hsin-hui "admitted their wrong thinking."  A reexamination of the
 potential of the colliery showed that last fall only 50 percent of its equipment was
 utilized.  Educational measures within the colliery produced 532 proposals for improve-
 ment from the workers.  As a result the new quota called for a 60-billion-yuan
 increase in production rather than a mere 13.5.
 Sian (9 Jan.) quoted Hsi Chung-hsun, Deputy Director of the Nc:_rthwest Military and
 Administrative Committee, as saying that since the beginning of the campaign against
 waste, corruption and bureaucracy in the Northwest, "excellent results have been
 achieved."  During the first week 350 letters of accusation were received, corrupt
 officials in the Northwest Army Service of S1unplies Corms confessed their misdeeds,
 while workers in the bristle factory of the Northwest Trading Company gave reports
 on mismanagement there.
 Weaknesses and Failures:  During the period reviewed admissions of failures and
 weaknesses were monitored from 11 regional broadcasting stations from all sections of
 China except the Northwest.  While Chungking reported more admissions than did any
 other transmitter the preponderance of failures in the Southwest was less marked
 than during some earlier periods.  Several stations in Central and South China and
 in East China vied with Chungking; in the number of such references.  In the Northeast
 there were few admissions, and none from the major regional station at Mukden.
 Quoting from a dl--ctive of the All-China Committee of State Enterprises, Pekin,
 declared in numeral  code (4 Jan. that in inventory-taking and capital-assessment
 work a number of State enterprises had achieved very little "due to neglect of the
 leading cadres and failure to mobilize the people." Peking said in numeral code
 (5 Jan.) that basic-level cooperatives, despite their 88.99 percent increase in
 membership and 140.75 percent increase in capital since 1950, had obvious weaknesses,
 including poor organization and planning, tied-up capital, and transportation
 defects.  The Tsinan radio (4 Jan.) reported an anti-waste exhibition held at the
 Tsingtao?No. 4 Textile Mill.  One chart showed 9 billion yuan tied up in dead
 inventories, "enough to purchase six planes to fight America."  According to Hofei
 (7 Jan.) cadres at the Government granary in Kehlo Hsiang, Su Hsien, Anhwei, were
 charged with a loss of 3,000 catties of wheat through careless management and
 failure to cooperate with the farmers.  Canton (28 Dec.) reported that at the
 Chienkung Rubber Works "gross mismanagement," including curtailed wages and
 accelerated work norms, had caused a decrease in production during the past few
 months.  Dairen (9 Jan.) said that the Dairen Bureau of Educational and Cultural
 Affairs had been charged with laxity in enforcing the anti-waste campaign.  Another
 Dairen broadcast (8 Jan.) said that the Northeast Salt Administration was still
 not ready on 5 January to launch its campaign.  Some cadres insisted that the
 work would be a waste of time, and had adopted the motto:  "To say little is better
 than much; to say nothing is better than a little."  Some leading cadres, because
 of their failure, were charged with "ignorance of the campaign" and with refusing
 to accept suggestions.
 On 13 December the East China A,riculture and Forestry Section called a meeting of
 managers of nine large State farms, Shanghai reported (30 Dec.), and it was revealed
 that the managers lacked experience and were guilty of poor planning and poor
 administration.  In some instances the managers had operated with a complete dis-
 regard of practical farming principles.  Another Shanghai broadcast (5 Jan.) said
 that Youth Corps members were\being urged to take the lead in the anti-waste
 campaign, as many units were lax in making check-ups of their own operations.
 In pointing out the waste in "superstitious observances," Foochow (9 Jan,) used
 as an example Putao village, Santao Hsiang, Changpu Hsien, Fukien, where the
 farmers' association was able to buy 30 head of oxen, 30 axes, 100 tons of
 fertilizer and 8,000 catties of grain with money saved by eliminating superstitious
 observances.  Foochow.(4 Jan.) reported that Kao Chung, Communist Party Secretary
 of Changlo Hsien, Fukien, called a meeting 22 December to charge local cadres with
 laxity and demand that they change their attitude.

 A Yangchow broadcast (2 Jan.) charged cadres of Chitung Hsien, Kiangsu, with setting
 a bad example.  For instance, Militia Captain Wang Te-hsiang spent 1.36 million yuan
 in setting 249 tables for his wedding in Hsinchung Hsiang.  Another Yangchow broad-
 cast (7 Jan.) said that corruption, extravagance and bureaucratic management were
 rampant in Liuho Hsien, Kiangsu. Yangchow (4 Jan.) pointed out that through failure
 of the Seed Section of the North Kiangsu Civil Affairs Division properly to instruct
 farmers, 260,000 catties of purebred wheat seed was lost through improper seeding,
 and 50 pieces of machinery damaged through improper use.  Still another Yangchow
 broadcast (B Jan.) reported that the Huaiyin Cooperative, northern Kiangsu, had
 been charged with a loss of 140 million yuan in the sale of 7,100 bolts of Nantung
 native cloth because of inaccurate measurements.  The Nantung Cooperative was
 charged with a loss of 150 million yuan through delay in marketing its cotton yarn.
 Kaifeng (7 Jan.) charged that in Chengchow, Honan, the wastage last year amounted to
 120 million Yuan.  The People's Bank wasted the equivalent of 1,000 catties of grain,
 monthly through excessive use of coal,' and the Chengchow Grain Bureau squandered
 2.77 million yuan in the past three months on unnecessary cartage.  At the Chienhua
 Cotton Mills, Lingpao Hsien, Honan, a fire broke out 19 December.  Because the
 cadres had no plan for fighting fire, 9,700 catties of cotton and two machines
 valued at 140 million Yuan were lost.  When the fire started in No. 17 Workshop the
 workmen tried to smother it with straw, adding to the flames, and when the firemen
 arrived they set about removing property rather than fighting the fire.
 Kaifeng reported (9 Jan.) that at Nanyang, Honan, the Government lost 21,200,000
 Yuan last year because of poor warehousing and the unnecessary restriction of
 capital by the State Trading Company.  Another Kaifeng broadcast (7 Jan.) reported
 that checks by the Honan Postal Telegraph office showed the Taikang telegraph office
 possessed 1,000 catties of wire rather than the 400 reported; the Chengchow
 telegraph office had 20 bolts of cloth which were not on the records; and the Loyang
 telegraph office had 510 items in its records, only 200 of which agreed with the
 actual inventory.  At the Hsinyang Railway Station 200 telegraph poles were left
 unguarded; now only 90 remain, a loss of 38 million yuan.  Postal telegraph offices
 in Honan last year spent 200 million yuan on "flower vases" (Hua Ping),  Since
 "hua ping" is also slang for women office workers, there is some doubt here as to
 exactly how the 200 million yuan was dissipated.
 The Wuhan radio (29 Dec.) charged that the Pinghsiang Colliery had 20 billion Yuan
 tied up in dead inventories.  An investigation disclosed 40 items which never had
 been used, 20 others seldom used, and some stocks sufficient to last for 14 years.
 Another Wuhan broadcast (4 Jan.) claimed that the management of the Hunan branch,
 China State Industries, spent between 40 and 50 million yuan on a warehouse which
 remained empty most of the time, 70 to 80 millions on an elaborate administration
 building, allowed 400 tons of farm produce to spoil, and had 18 billion Yuan tied.
 up in unproductive capital. Hsu, the farm manager, kept 10 personal servants, jeeps

 and spent 250 million yuan on the 10-day conference.  In addition the manager
 personally bore the cost of a dinner dance given as part of the entertainment.
 The conference personnel consumed 40 catties of tea and 1,651 catties of watermelon
 seed, dried fruit and candy.  Engineers of the 4th Field Army stationed in the

 committee has been formed to check on irregularities here.
 Hangchow (3 Jan.) reported a meeting of 121 persons in the city to "attack traditional
 business methods" obstructing trade between the city and country.  Special classes
 organized in Chekiang to train workers in advanced techniques and supervision have
 been handicapped because some factories have refused to cooperate.   They refuse to
 allow workmen to attend the classes for fear the result will be "bad workmen."
 Hangchow said (2 Jan.) that winter production on the farms of Chentung Hsiang, Chinhua

 harvests, and the neglect of rural cadres, some of whom had gone on vacation and
 some of whom had resigned, saying two years of service was enough.  Hangchow
 (29 Dec.) denounced the "gross mismanagement" at the Chekiang Printing and Dyeing
 Works, where walls had to be torn out for the installation of machinery because no
 preliminary measurements of machinery dimensions had been made; where starching
 tubs proved useless because they were improperly equipped; where cutting machines
 of improper size were installed; and where motors, not inspected,   later proved to
 be defective.
 Hangchow (4 Jan.) reported that in the Neihsinchiao District a fire at the Hangli
 Photo Shop resulted from the owner's burning birthday candles because he was
 "extravagant and blindly followed old customs."  Hangchow (5 Jan.) said that care-
 lessness of the workers and management caused a fire 17 December at the Chainiu
 Cotton Plant, Lungyu branch, China Merchandise Company, which destroyed 1.20 catties
 of cotton and one machine.
 Hangchow (8 Jan.) charged that the Chekiang branch, China Native Products Company,
 wasted 8,4 billions Yuan last year because of bureaucratic methods.  It lost 4
 billions through paying high prices for low-quality goods; lost 360 millions in
 extra freight charges by routing a shipment of 120 tons of lime from Wenchow to
 Canton through Hangchow rather than Chinhua; lost 140 millions through refusal to
 check on delivery shortages and warehouse losses; and lost a huge amount in interest
 through maintaining a daily idle capital of 400 millions and a dead stock of 50
 billion yuan,
 Hangchow (6 Jan.) reported a 21 December meeting of all secretarial personnel of the
 Hangchow municipal government to discuss red tape in the handling of documents.
 Reports disclosed that the average city government document required 18 actions in
 8 hours; an ordinary police department document requires 16 actions over one week;
 a police station must petition the chief of police to buy even a vacuum bottle; and
 the simple removal of guards at the Chekiang University Farm at Huachiatse took
 141 days while 37 documents made the rounds at 13 offices.
 Chungking (6 Jan.) charged cadres in charge of the Government warehouse at Yaan,
 Sikang, with mismanagement, as only two-thirds of the required amount of grain had
 been received, and three weeks had been required rather than the estimated two.
 Chungking (8 Jan.) announced that Tsai Ken, a worker in the No. 2 Textile Mill,
 Yunnan Province, made rational suggestions for improvement which were rejected by
 the cadres.  Such action is allegedly common in Yunnan, and some factories have
 refused even to set up committees to handle such suggestions.
 In south Szechwan, Chungking said (6 Jan.), anti-waste committees in some trading
 companies held no meetings for three months, "and in many cases cadres did not
 even know what the campaign was about."  According to the same radio (30 Dec.) the
 Liangchung Food Bureau, Szechwan, allowed grain to rot by mixing damp grain with
 dry in the warehouse.  Also, 92,000 catties of grain were found to be wormy and
 1,000 tan badly mildewed.  Chungking said (29 Dec.) that the Suining Food Bureau,
 north Szechwan, and the Pengshan Food Bureau, west Szechwan, both wasted food and
 money through lack of planning.  In Chiangpei Hsien, east Szechwan, Chungking said
 (28 Dec.), Liao Cheng-chi of Tapu Hsiang squandered the family fortune of 20 million
 Yuan in one month, while Ho Chi-chun, magistrate of Village 43, Liangho Hsiang, spent
 1.2 million yuan in September alone on festivities.
 Chungking reported (4 Jan.) that at the Southwest Chemical Works 92 percent of the
 equipment is idle; the Huayeh Match Factory could produce in a month and a half as
 much as it now does in a year if its equipment were fully utilized; equipment is idle
 at the Lihua Rubber Works and the Chentan Machine Works; at the Sanwei Leather
 Works morale is bad because of low pay; and miners at the Chiuchiang Coal Mine
 drowned because the management refused to accept suggestions of workers.  All of
 these Szechwan concerns are operated by private owners.  Chungking (6 Jan.) accused
 Shan Pan-wu, manager of the Plow Ox Company, Lu Hsien, Szechwan, of buying all the
 sick, immature and over-age animals in the area, many of them toothless and one 18
 years old.  Sick oxen have been intermingled with the healthy ones, but only 333
 head out of 1,000 held by the company have been resold.  Farmers have begun to call
 it an "abattoir company instead of an ox supply company."  During two months in the
 employ of the company Liu Sze-ling, Tien-tse Hsiang, misappropriated 1.07 million
 yuan.

 Propaganda Apparatus:  During the two weeks starting 27 December and ending 9
 January the Chinese Communist radio continued to stress the necessity for thought
 reform and the thorough indoctrination of all circles, from writers and teachers
 to workers and peasants, with Marxism-Leninism and the theories of Mao Tse-tung.
 However, a new element was added--discussion of the Communist Party propaganda
 network itself.
 Peking reported in numeral code (2 Jan.) that in the entire country the network
 now includes 1.92 million publicity personnel and 50,000 reporters.  In addition
 this nucleus has made full use of "active elements" to such an extent that in
 some communities the publicity forces make up 15 percent of the population.  Yet
 20 percent of the Communist Party organizations and subheadquarters have not yet
 set up publicity organizations.  In 1952, it is reiterated, they must do so, and
 steadily develop the network until it includes one percenL of the population.  Chu
 committees, under the direction of hsien committees, must inaugurate training
 classes for publicity personnel, but in 1952 trainees must not give up their
 regular work while attending the classes.  All Party committees above the chu
 level must set up reporting units without delay if they have not done so.
 In a numeral code transmission (5 Tan.) Peking further illustrated how the network
 must function on the lower levels, taking the Penchi Machine Company, Penchi
 municipality, Liaotung Province, as an example.  This concern has eight reporters,
 who now have a well-organized work system. Each reporter must make reports to
 "the broad masses of the people" twice a month, and must attend classes.  In turn
 the Communist Party committee in the factory must make reports on the reporters
 once a month, and must call a reporters' conference every month.  The eight
 reporters in the Penchi factory have made 84 reports concerning increased pro-
 duction and austerity.
 The regional broadcasting stations followed the lead of Peking in publicizing the
 propaganda network.  Wuhan announced (2 Jan.) that incomplete statistics for
 Central and South China show 236,000 propagandists and 14,000 reporters.  Wuhan
 (31 Dec.) gave the number of publicity personnel for Honan Province as 76,135.
 In Wuhan city, according to another broadcast (29 Dec.), the network consists
 of 2,947 personnel, with 9 training courses and 43 meetings held during the year.
 Tsinan said (4 Jan.) that Shantung has 366,927 publicity personnel and 5,587 reporters.
 Yangchow (2 Jan.) reported 637 propagandists in that city, with five branch
 sections of the network being set up.
 Mukden announced (4 Jan.) that in the Dairen-Port Arthur area there are 11,092
 publicity personnel and 884 reporters, constituting more than one percent of the
 population, with 90 percent of the reporters and 50 percent of the publicity
 personnel "regularly publicizing and explaining the Party's policies and opinions."
 Liaotung Province has 49,507 propagandists and 1,242 reporters, and the work will
 be still further expanded in 1952.  Dairen said (29 Dec.) that in the Dairen-Port
 Arthur area publicity personnel, in 1951 have 9,538 reports to 2,664,850 listeners.
 Sian (5 Jan.) announced that Tihua now has 170 wire broadcasting stations, 37
 hsien now have receiving posts, and by spring all hsion will be so provided.
 Peking in numeral code (7 Jan.) transmitted the report on the China Youth Corps
 delivered by Feng Wen-pin 20 November 1951 at the Socond Plenary Session of the
 Central Committee of the Youth Corps.  In 30 months the organization's membership
 has increased 27 times, from 190,000 to 5.18 million organized in 242,000 units.
 The Youth Corps plays an important role as an auxiliary. of the Communist Party and
 as the chief source of Party recruitment.  Yet, according to the report,
 "thought leadership in the Corps is comparatively weak.  Though active and
 passionate, the political and cultural level of many members of the Corps is not
 high."  Though the incidence of such groups is declining, the number of units not
 soundly organized or which have failed to play their roles still constitutes a
 rather large proportion of the total.  Association between Corps members and
 "the large masses of the youth" has not been close enough.  The Corps has been
 unable to adopt effective measures for an intensification of the education of
 all youths.

 Schools and Teachers: Peking in numeral code (29 Dec.) reported that the Ministry
 of Education decided at a meeting 21 December that teachers should concentrate on
 a study of Communist documents during the winter vacation, as a result of which
 they now are devoting 12 to 15 hours a week to such study. Teachers in higher
 institutions of Peking and Tientsin now have reached the second stage in thought
 reform, the main aims of which are to "distinguish between ourselves and the
 enemy," both internationally and nationally, and to "stamp out reactionary remnants
 of thought inherited from imperialism and feudalism."
 Peking also reported in numeral code (29 Dec.) that 320 scientific research workers
 in Peking started a thought-reform study program early in December, the aim of
 which is to "reform the thinking of the scientific workers so as to make it
 possible for them to recognize clearly the era, to distinguish the enemy from
 themselves, and to criticize the wrong thinking of the bourgeoisie or petite
 bourgeoisie."  Kuo Mo-jo decried the fact that there are some scientists "whose
 thinking is too muddled to distinguish the enemy from themselves, and who still
 think it an honorable thing to send their scientific theses to imperialist
 countries for publication."
 Hankow announced (28 Dec.) that the thought-reform drive was making progress among
 primary school teachers of Wuhan.  Wuhan said (29 Dec.) that middle and primary
 school teachers of Hupeh had made substantial progress in thought refora. Wuhan
 announced (9 Jan,) that the University of Honan had called a meeting 16 December
 to discuss thought reform among the educators.  The Central and South China
 branch, All-China Education Federation, is planning a conference to discuss ways
 to implement thought reform among the nation's educators, and Propaganda Bureau
 Director Yao Shu-i is quoted as saying that in 1952 "revolutionary methods must
 be used to reform the thinking of educational workers."
 In the Northwest, Sian reported (27 Dec.) that students in the Northwest College
 of Engineering had issued a statement supporting the thought-reform movement and
 calling on all teachers and professors to reform their thinking and "change
 their attitude" so they can train the younger generation to serve the masses.  The
 Northwest Committee of the China Education Association sent a similar demand to
 teachers in all higher institutions in the region.  Sian announced (29 Dec.)
 that elementary and secondary school teachers are meeting for study,  Another
 announcement (3 Jan.) said that the entire teaching staff of the First Central
 Grammar School, Fifth Chu, (Lu) Hsien, Shensi, had made plans for thought reform.
 In the Southwest, Chungking reported (30 Dec.) that study committees had been
 setup in the Chungking area "after a call by the Southwest Government."  Another
 Chungking broadcast (31 Dec,) said that following an east Szechwan conference
 on thought reform 200 teachers returned to their schools to implement the plans.
 Chungking announced (5 Jan.) that thought-reform study committees in eight
 higher institutions now include 1,361 teachers and administrators, with 98
 percent of the staff of Chungking University enrolled.  Chungking announced
 (7 Jan.) that in the Nanchung Special District 390 grammar school teachers now
 are receiving indoctrination from Party cadres, and in February 2,000 will
 start this training.  However, according to Chungking (28 Dec.), teachers in,
 Langehung Hsien, north Szechwan, still are neglecting political indoctrination
 in their teaching.
 Special Programs:  Mukden announced (7 Jane) that the'HEILUNGKIANG JIH PAO carried
 an article on the need for thought reform among businessmen, and said that 300
 businessmen in Anta of that province are "studying the role of businessmen in the
 nation's new economy."  Dairen (28 Dec.) said that thought reform is being
 strengthened among industrial and commercial circles.
 Mukden reported (28 Dec,) that the Liaotung subcommittee of the Chinese Communist
 Party had held a conference for discussion of Mao Tse-tung's "Selected Works."
 Yangchow (2 Jan.) said that the Huaian Hsien, Kiangsu, branch of the Communist
 Party was planning studies to "change the attitude of the cadres," some of whom
 believe workmen to be "basically unchangeable," and do not believe in criticism
 and self-criticism.  Shanghai announced (4 Jan.) that Party cadres in Tsinan
 were planning to change the attitude of local cadres, "some of whom do not believe
 in democracy and are trying to suppress public opinion."

 Mukden announced (5 Jan.) that three model workers of Dairen were to study in the
 Dairen Workers and Peasants Short Course School.  Mukden further said (9 Jan.) that
 up to last August 122,955 workers in the Dairen-Port Arthur area had attended
 "beginners' classes," and another 40,000 had been enrolled in "refresher courses."
 Shanghai (27 Dec.) reported a "thought-mobilization meeting" 26 December of the
 East CHina Industrial Department to plan steps for elimination of "landlord,
 compradore and bureaucratic" thoughts still prevalent among many workers.  Shanghai
 (5 Jan.) announced that committees for the study of Mao Tse-tung's ideas had been
 organized in all circles of Fukien.  Wuhsi (6 Jan.) reported that the Wuhsien
 Department of Education, reviewing workers' education during 1951, announced that
 130 cadres attended classes., and enrollment of workers increased from 6,475 to 13,708.
 Shanghai announced (9 Jan.) that the East China Study Committee, formerly called
 the East China Study Committee of Mao Tse-tung's Ideology, had called a rally for
 16 January to "develop the thought-reform movement in a planned and orderly way."
 Concerning tlie:,winter-school program, Mukden announced (9 Jan.) that in Liaosi
 Province 260 000 farmers are enrolled in the 3,724 schools in 16 hsien, where the
 "students 'are given indoctrination courses in patriotism."  Wuhsi said (7 Jan.)
 that fY?re organizations in south Kiangsu had issued a joint statement calling on
 rurpl cadres to organize for the winter-school program, indicating that enrollment
 ri this area might not be satisfactory, as the schools were supposed to have
 started some time ago.  Chungking reported (27 Dec.) that teachers had been trained
 for the opening of schools in Ipin 10 December, and in Nanchi, Changning and Kusung
 Hsien.  Another broadcast (9 Jan.) said that 20,000 were enrolled in schools in the
 21 hsiang of Lu Hsien, and in preparation for these schools 120.cadres had learned
 the story of the "Long March" and the "Eight Years of Japanese Resistance."  In
 southern Szechwan winter schools had opened in seven hsien, where most of the
 teachers, drawn from the ranks of high school students, had been taught subjects
 "centered on the patriotic theme."
 Religious Reform:  Several new attacks on Catholic institutions in China were
 reported.  Shanghai announced (9 Jan.) that "at the demand of patriotic Catholics,"
 the Hsuchow Military Control Committee had arrested for trial American imperialist
 element Chai Yu-ou (Chinese transliteration) charged with dealing in silver dollars
 and "teaching the American way of life after the liberation."  Also arrested were
 Chaff's "running dogs," Chen Li--shen, Li Chuan-li and Fan Chun-ou.
 Wuhsi (7 Jan.) announced that after three months of study a Three-self's Reform
 Committee finally had been set up at the Pu Tzu Asylum in Shanghai Hsien
 5 January, with 85 patriotic Catholic members and 56 representative workers of
 the asylum.  Representatives of the People's Government attended the ceremony in
 connection with the formation of the committee.  After hearing of this development
 in Shanghai Hsien, patriotic Catholics of Wuhsien held a symposium, "accused
 imperialist elements" at the Putien Sanitarium, and expressed a determination
 to strengthen the Catholic reform movement in Wuhsien.  Earlier a Wuhsi broadcast
 (6 Jan.) quoted a Wuhsien Catholic, Hu Chung-ya, as saying that the Putien
 Sanitarium in Wuhsien was the property of Chinese Catholics, but that it had been
 taken over by imperialist elements.
 Chungking announced.(28 Dec.), that the Chungking Catholic Reform Committee had
 called a meeting to denounce members of the Legion of Mary for opposing the
 People's Government.  Many members of the Legion were suspected of being counter-
 revolutionaries, and 20 members had registered with the Chungking Police.  Peking
 disclosed in numeral code (29 Dec.) that Tang Hsueh-po, Chen Kuang-pu, and Su
 Tzu-mei, all members of the Legion in Chungking, had been arrested 24 December.
 Tang, formerly connected with the Ming Cheng High School, a Catholic school, was
 accused of having planned on the eve of the "liberation" to organize a "San San
 Society" to carry out guerrilla activity "on the pretext of protecting
 Catholicism," and of secretly shipping pistols and weapons to the Southwest
 Revolutionary University for use in destroying it at the proper time.

 Hangchowr reported (8 Jan.) that Catholics in that city had made accusations against
 "imperialist element" Mei Tsang-kaei by signing a petition requesting his trial.
 Up to 6 January 260 patriotic Catholics, 60 percent of the local lay membership, had
 signed the petition.
 Art and Literature:  Peking reported in numeral code (28 Dec.) that the North China
 Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party called a meeting 20 December to "study the
 remolding of working style among literary and art circles of North China," with 200
 persons present from Peking and Tientsin, and from Hopei, Chahar, and Inner Mongolia.
 Director Chang Pan-ship of the North China Propaganda Department declared that
 leaders in literary and art work of the area had neglected the ideological aspects
 of their work and had shown an inclination to deviate from the politics of the
 masses and the workers.  Some of Chang's statements follow:
 Certain signs of lack of discipline also have appeared among literary
 and art cadres of the Party... Literary and art work is part of the
 revolutionary undertaking.  Art must serve the cause of the revolution,
 and. obey the interests of the State and of the people...  Literary and
 art workers must constantly study Marxism and Leninism, as well as
 Mao Tse-tung's ideas, as expressed in the actual Chinese Revolution....
 The literary and art workers of North China should aim to become fighters
 armed with the ideas of Mao Tse-tung, as well as active participants
 in various kinds of struggle.... They should not be a group of liberal
 individuals lacking organization arid discipline.   (Peking, numeral code,
 28 Dec.)
 Marriage Law:  Considerable radio time still is devoted to propagandizing the marriage
 law.  Hangchow (1 Jan.) announced that as part of their patriotic pacts farmers in
 Kingtang Hsiang, Hsiaofeng Hsien, Chekiang, were called upon to implement the
 marriage law by dissolving incompatible couples, "as family quarrels interfere with
 patriotic production."  Another broadcast (5 Jan.) reported the establishment of a
 Chekiang Marriage Law Propaganda Committee having as its primary goal the indoctri-
 nation of rural cadres so as to "change their attitude toward the marriage law."
 It is hoped that by International Women's Day, 8 March, the propaganda campaign
 will have reached its peak.  Another Hangchow broadcast (7 Jan.) said that through-
 out all the chu of Chiangshan Hsien, Chekiang, there were 208 mass weddings New
 Year's Day.  Yangchow reported (4 Jan.) that Party cadres held a meeting 29 December
 to discuss propaganda for the marriage law.  On New Year's Day six couples were
 married at a mass wedding attended by 800 persons, at a saving of 150 million yuan.
 Dairen (8 Jan.) reported 5,677 couples registered during the first 10 months of
 1951 to "show their free will marriage."  However, there were numerous errors.  Some
 who were not married registered, and other couples who should have registered did
 not.  Cadres were charged with carelessness.  Foochow (8 Jan.) reported mass
 marriages through all the rural areas of Fukien.  According to Chungking (27 Dec.),
 women in Tsungtung Hsiang, Chiangan Hsien, Szechwan, trained students to help in
 propagandizing.  Also in the Sixth Central Grammar School, Tzuchung Hsien,
 exhibitions were prepared on the marriage law.  After seeing this exhibition, Mme.
 Li Hsiang-ling, Chuangchien village, Pahsien Hsiang, Hsingwen Hsien, said:  "This
 has taught me a lesson.  After this I shall never arrange a marriage for any girl."
 Peking announced in numeral code (4 Jan.) that four units of the Marriage Law
 Implementation Scrutiny Team of the Central Government returned to Peking in
 December after inspections  in the East, Central and South Northwest and North
 China regions.  Yangchow (28 Dec.) announced that the local Marriage Law Inspection
 Committee called a meeting for husbands and mothers-in-law in Huaian Hsien, north
 Kiangsu, where cadres lectured.  Mothers-in-law made public admissions that of 10
 arranged marriages, 9 were failures.  Husbands agreed to let their wives go to
 school, and not to sell them as concubines.  Dairen complained (4 Jan.) that the
 city Marriage Law Inspection Team discovered that some cadres still are feudalistic
 and refuse to take the marriage law seriously; that most girls do not realize that
 marriages arranged by their parents are illegal; and that some teachers still
 teach feudalistic marriage ideas.  Chungking (29 D -c.) reported that the
 feudalistic thinking on the marriage law is especially bad among village magistrates
 and Militiamen in Yunnan Province.  The authorities have refused to publicize the
 marriage law for fear of having the court dockets cluttered with marriage cases,
 and suicides and murders are reported continually from Lufeng, Chennan, and Yacan
 Hsien.

 Land Reform;  De-emphasis on land reform is indicated by the reduced amount of time
 accorded the subject by the radio during the period under study.  In the Southwest,
 where resistance to the redistribution of land has been most noticeable in the past,
 only one broadcast mentioned the subject.  Chungking (27 Dec.) said that rich
 landlord Ho En-ling, Chihpei Hsiang, (Peiling) Hsien, Szechwan, was guilty of hoarding
 a large amount of goods; Liu Huei, landlord of Nanlung Hsiang, (Peiling) Hsien, was
 found to have a cache of 300 rounds of ammunition; landlord Chen Kuaig-mao,Hochien
 Hsiang, Fengtu Hsien, was charged with posing as a doctor and with poisoning the son
 of farmer Yu Kung-chai; landlord Chang Lung-chien, Fenglai Hsiang, Fengtu Hsien,
 assaulted farmer Wang Keh-shih when he demanded that Chang give up his house to the
 farmers association; and landlords in Changshou, Chung, and Wulung Hsien were
 charged with appropriating land that had been given to farmers.
 Wuhan (9 Jan.) reported that Mayor Teng Fai of Nanchang, Kiangsi Province, had urged
 villages undergoing land reform to complete the-work quickly, and urged areas where
 land reform had not yet been started to initiate action at once.  After receiving
 indoctrination from Party cadres, professors and students of Hunan University are
 pushing land reform in Hunan Province. Canton (3 Jan.) reported a land-reform meeting
 on Hainan Island, where land reform is the most urgent current task, and an attempt
 is being made to complete it this year.  The Peking Home Service announced (29 Dec.)
 that in East China land redistribution had been completed in 39,000 villages
 constituting 90 percent of the area.
 The reason for the radio de-emphasis, and the apparent urgency in completing land
 reform at once, may be indicated in some new broadcasts.  The Peking Home Service
 (31 Dec.) broadcast an article from the PEOPLES DAILY, "Mechanized Farming Is
 Developing in the Northeast," which described the development of 40 large State farms.
 Mukden announced (28 Dec.) that the Northeast People's Government in 1952 will start
 issuing new postage stamps commemorating land reform.  The stamps will bear photo-
 graphs of tractors and other heavy farm machinery "showing mechanized production after
 land reform."  As the individual peasant farmer who has been.given land has small
 chance of using tractors and other heavy farm machinery, it appears that the new
 emphasis will be on collective farming.
 Farm Cooreratives;  An increased radio stress on farm organizations--cooperatives and
 associations--also is noted.  Chungking announced (29 Dec.) that 78 rural supply
 and distribution cooperatives were operating in Kweichow at the end of November, a
 more than fourfold increase in two months.  The membership jumped 350 percent, to
 219,000.  Chungking reported (7 Jan.) that in Yunnan 40 percent of the farmers have
 been organized into unions following "substantial completion" of land reapportion-
 ment.  Hangchow (27 Dec.) reported that in Yinhsien 133 farmers cooperatives had
 been reorganized, with incompetent and corrupt cadres expelled.  As a result the
 membership had jumped 1,300, and the unit fees had been increased from 10,000 to
 20,000 yuan.  The Peking Home Service (30 Dec.) announced that agrarian reform
 "gradually was taking hold" in Suiyuan, with peasant associations' membership now
 at 600,000,
 Farmin,a Methods;  An effort to expand farm income through part-time work, live-
 stock improvement, and other changes in methods is reflected in some radio broad-
 casts.  Foochow (4 Jan.) asserted that in Yungching Hsien, Fukien, the leadership.
 of the local cadres has eradicated the farmerst resistance to winter work.  In
 ..the hsien rice roots have been dug up on 25,000 mou of land to eliminate insects.
 Chinchow (5 Jan.) announced that model workers have taught farmers to make mattresses.
 In one village three oxen have been bought with the mattress income.  Farmers also
 have added to their regular income by making cotton quilts, which at the same time
 helps to utilize waste cotton.  In Liaosi Province farmers who suffered crop
 failures are now engaged in handicraft work to provide living incomes.  Chinchow
 said (3 Jan,) that animals "suffered greatly" from a lack of fodder as a result of
 the heavy floods in Char.gkou village, Fifth Chu, Hsinmin Hsien, Liaosi.  Other
 villages are lending animals so that the villagers may engage in hauling grain
 for delivery at warehouses as part-time production.

 Mukden announced (29 Dec.) that the Northeast Department of Agriculture called a
 meeting at Harbin 18 December to plan for eradication of hoof-and-mouth disease,
 which has spread to 17 hsien of three provinces.  Hofei (2 Jan.) reported that the
 Government Livestock-Insurance Company had insured 133 oxen in the First Chu,
 I Hsien  Anhwei, 95 percent of the animals of the district.  Yangchow reported
 (8 Jana that a veterinarians' association had been formed in nine hsien of the
 Huaiyin Special District, Kiangsu, with 800 members.  A meeting was held 19
 December to discuss vaccination of cattle.  Chungking (6 Jan.) said that the East
 Szechwan Administrative Office had issued a directive calling on farmers to
 utilize the 70,000 head of oxen in the area for spring farming, and to make this
 possible cadres have been instructed to organize plow-oxen stations for joint
 use and to prohibit trading in ozen.  Chungking reported (7 Jan.) that there has been
 a great improvement in the hog industry in the Southwest, especially in north
 Szechwan, because of new bank loans to hog growers.  There are now 10.57 million
 hogs in the Southwest, and 290 hog farms in north Szechwan.  The ho
 which used to reach 30 percent, also has been lowered, and in east Szechwan 1266rate,
 animal protection societies have been organized. Neichiang Hsien has three hog-breeding
 stations, while in Mienyang Hsien, west Szechwan, farmers have succeeded in pro-
 ducing 24 pigs to the litter, twice the usual number.             The methods used by farmers
 in producing such large litters are not disclosed.
 WAR AND THE MILITARY
 Troops and Militiamen:  Canton reported (8 Jan.) that a meeting of the People's
 Militia was held 24 December at Haikou, Hainan Island, to review the work for the
 past year.  Similar meetings were held in the West River Military District, and
 here also awards were given to model militiamen.  Yangchow (5 Jan.) announced that
 the North Kiangsu Administrative Office had issued a directive calling on the People's
 Militia to strengthen the winter vigilance work by posting sentries, conducting
 patrols and organizing fishermen along coasts and rivers.  In Luho a. meeting of
 militiamen was held to "increase the political consciousness" of the men and prepare
 them for winter patrol activities.  Chungking reported (6 Jan.) that signs of com-
 placency had been noted among militiamen in numerous hsien              of Sikang.  As a result
 training schools have been set up for Militia captains and chu and hsien working
 cadres so their politics and discipline may be strengthened.
 Peking announced in numeral code (5 Jan.) that the Political Department of the
 Military Affairs Commission has issued a directive on the implementation of a "quick
 method for learning words."  The system was invented by Chi Chien-hua, an Army station
 instructor in the Southwest Military District.  By use of the system an illiterate
 soldier can learn 1,500 to 2,000 characters or words in 150 hours:  first learning the
 phonetics (20-30 hours), then learning to identify the words (100 hours), and then
 learning to read the basic 2,000 words or characters.  The success of the system was
 demonstrated in the 20th Class of the Southwest Military District's intensive course
 in elementary education, and also in the Kweichow Military District, where 144 men
 of minority groups learned to read an average of about 1,500 words in 15 days.
 Chungking announced (3 Jan.) that classes in basic Chinese, using 200 characters
 in the first period of instruction, had been organized in the Sikang Military District.
 ~'esist America  did-Korea Donations:  The Peking Home Service announced (28 Dec.)
 that in the donation campaign to provide fighting in Korea, enough money was collected toepaypfort3,152tffightereplanes.
 The quota was overfulfilled by 19 percent, but it was admitted that in the North-
 west region only 88 percent of the quota was reached.  This Peking announcement
 apparently marked official closing of the campaign.  Hangchow announced (7 Jan.) that
 the local Resist America, Aid-Korea Committee met 5 January to wind up the donation
 drive and start its anti-waste campaign.  The Peking Home Service radio announced
 (29 DPc.) that a new propaganda movie to raise money to buy military equipment was
 to be shown in Chungking, where 190,000 reserved seat tickets had bensold.
 Preferential Teament:  All units of the Chinese Communist Government selected New
 Year's Day, and Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year, as occasions for pushing the
 preferential treatment for soldiers and dependents of soldiers.   Most regional

 that the move had been successful, and broadcast numerous detail-concerning calls and
 contributions.  During the period under study such broadcasts were monitored from
 Mukden, Chinchow, Dairen, Shanghai, Foochow, Hangchow, Wuhsi, Wuhan, Canton, Hankow
 and Chungking.
 Mukden announced (29 Dec.) that the Mukden Youth  Corps would be in charge of the work
 in that area.  It would call on dependents, help them to write letters, and give
 indoctrination talks to the masses so that the movement would spread.  A later
 broadcast (6 Jan,) said that the Northeast Civil Affairs Department had declared the
 movement a success, and special praise was broadcast for the response of people in
 Harbin and Dairen.  Chinchow reported (4 Jan.) that 300 youth in the area pushed the
 work after being organized into seven teams.  The Chinchow city government con-
 tributed soap and towels to present to dependents, and several factories contributed
 3 million Yuan each,  Wuhan announced (27 Dec.) that preferential treatment was to be
 considered the most important phase of the New Year activities.  A later broadcast
 (3 Jan.) said that school children and people of all circles aided in the campaign.
 Funds were collected to present to dependents, 2,000 letters were written for families
 of Chinese Volunteers, and propaganda programs were held.  Comfort teams called on
 4,150 families and left gifts.  Wuh.si said (5 Jan.) that in addition to the present-
 ation of gifts, women and children assisted dependents with.their washing and house-
 work on New Year's Day.  Hangchow (4 Jan.) reported that school children had been
 mobilized to aid in the work.  Foochow reported (3 Jan.) that 70 students made calls
 and assisted with the house work in Anchiaomin Hsiang, Chianglo Hsien, Fukien.
 Mme. Wang Yeh-cheng told the students she was honored, and was "glad her son had gone
 to war."  Canton announced (4 Jana) that 10 public offices in the city had helped to
 organize school children to make calls on dependents.  Another broadcast (9 Jan.)
 reported the project was a great success on Hainan Island.  Chungking reported
 (2 Jan.) that servicemen and dependents held a meeting to express their appreciation
 for the New Year's preferential treatment among the 300,000 dependent families in
 north Szechwano  Another broadcast (9 Jan.) said calls were madeon 1,200 families
 in the Fourth Chu, Meishan Hsien, Szechwan, alone.
 Peking announced in numeral code (30 Dec.) that families of soldiers in the Taiyuan
 area increased their farm yields as a result of preferential treatment.  Wuhsi said
 (3 Jan.) that preferential treatment had been a great successes in Changchow, with
 228 persons given jobs, 309 children given schooling, and 1.86 million yuan in
 relief aid given to 11,423 dependents.  Hangchow reported (4 Jan,) that at Yinhsien
 148 delegates attended the first conference of servicemenss dependents.  Two
 productive enterprises have been set up here to aid dependents.  Mukden said (9 Jan.)
 that in Sungkiang Province during 1951, 162,693 families of dependents were aided
 with their farm work and some were given factory jobs.  In addition, 616 servicemen
 were chosen as hsien delegates and 1,180 as city delegates.  Dairen (2 Jan.) reported
 that the Dairen Trade Bureau was aiding dependents by sending them out to collect
 scrap.  Chinchow (5 Jan.) said that model worker Chang Wen-fa had organized teams
 to carry water for dependents, and had established a cotton quilt factory to give
 them jobs.
 COUNTERREVOLUTIONARIES

 ounterrevolutio
 any activity and the need for suppressing counterrevolutionaries,but the subject is
 not neglected by any means.  Peking announced in numeral code (6 Jan.) that in the
 various hsiang and chu of Neichiang Hsien a movement was being launched to honor
 model workers in the suppression of counterrevolutionaries.  Shanghai
 said the city government had called for an intensification of tcampaign Dagainst
 counterrevolutionaries, and suggested that those who denounce such elements or
 confess themselves should be rewarded.  Mukden reported (3 Jan.) that the city
 had issued a commendation and one million Yuan to Liu Pao-feng, Fourth Street tram
 conductor, who was responsible for the arrest of a suspicious looking man later
 found to be carrying a gun, 28 cartridges and 28 million yuan.
 (5 Jan.) that a city security officer was killed when he ate ted tondisarmtadman
 carrying a hand grenade.  However, Chungking reported (30 Dec.) that there still were
 shortcomings in surveillance of counterrevolutionaries in Kweiyang because some
 cadres thought surveillance too troublesome, and therefore made it a mere gesture
 to restrict the actions of counterrevolutionaries.

 P .sect Action: Dairen announced (31 Dec.) that a number of counterrevolutionaries
 had been rounded up 25-26 December through the aid of peasants.  Hangehow said
 (9 Jan.) that the Coastal Defense Corps killed and captured 118 pirates during
 December. Shanghai reported (7 Jan.) that the Militia forces in East China fought
 18,924 battles during the year; killed, wounded or captured 22,322 "bandits, including
 two major generals"; induced 5,400 bandits to surrender; and captured 16,169 small
 guns, 72 light and heavy machine guns, 13 artillery pieces, much ammunition, 2,725
 hand grenades, 15 radio receivers, 14 telephone sets, and much other military equip-
 ment.  Hankow said (8 Jan.) that workers in the Hsinhua Printing plant overthrew
 counterrevolutionary Chou Te-hsin.  Chungking reported (29 Dec.) that in 1951 there
 were 100,000 public trials of counterrevolutionaries in south Szechwan.  Forty percent
 of the convicts are en aged in productive labor while serving their sentences.
 Chungking said (7 Jan.) that 60 percent of the people in 11 chu of Neichiang Hsien,
 Szechwan, took part in the recent campaign, in which 82 counterrevolutionaries were
 captured, 1,040 accusations made, and 244 peasants given the title of model informer..
 Foochow reported (8 Jan.) that Liu Mo-ying, Chen Tao-kuang, and Liu Han-Chang,
 members of "a reactionary sect" active in the five chu of Chduning Hsien, Fukien,
 were given amass trial 23 December and turned over to the People's Court for
 sentencing. Hangchow announced (27 Dec.) that the city Military Control Commission
 recently took action against 810 counterrevolutionaries "following the righteous request
 among the broad masses of the people."  (Chang Chi-min), who undermined Communist
 Party work, was sentenced to death after two years.  Of the rest, 51 were sentenced
 to life imprisonment, 738 to terms up to 25 years, 17 were given milder punishment and
 3 released. The property of these counterrevolutionaries is to be handled by the
 Hangehow Municipal Committee to manage properties of counterrevolutionary elements.
 Hangchow announced (6 Jan.) that Feng Yin, King Kang-kuei, and 23 others "belonging
 to the Yang gang" were captured at Yuyao 14 December.  They had infiltrated schools
 and military units for sabotage and had spread rumors to sabotage grain deliveries.
 Landlord Tang I-pan and "loafer" Pan Yung-sen, who sabotaged grain deliveries,'were
 captured in Tzuchi Hsien 21 December.  Another counterrevolutionary, Yu Ya-wei, was
 accused of killing two farmers and eating their hearts.  Hangchow reported (28 Dec.)
 that Government worker Lu Tzu-an was sentenced to five years in prison for working
 with counterrevolutionary Wang Pei-seng.  Canton said (9 Jan.) that Liang Teng,
 employee of the Huangsha Transportation Company, had been arrested as a counter-
 revolutionary, special agent.and gangster.                        He was apprehended when he tried to.
 persuade fellow workers to become "ruzining dogs for the imperialists."  It is note-
 worthy that not one case of immediate execution following a public trial was
 monitored.
 A decline in comment concerning the national minorities is noted for the period
 27 December-9 January.  Only one regional broadcasting station   Chungking, made any
 mention of these groups.  Peking said in numeral code (29 Dec.) that in Hsin-pa-
 erh-hu-yu-i Banner, Inner Mongolia, 70 percent of the cattle were killed by the
 Japanese.  Yet, under the guidance of the Communist regime, the Banner now has 31-
 times as many cattle as it had before the war.  A middle-class named now can have
 white noodles at least 10 times a month.  At a fair in Na-ta-mu in September the
 nomads showed their purchasing power by buying 6,000 bolts of satin at 50,000
 jen min piao per foot in five days.  Man-ta-hu-tun village, Ko-erh-chin-yu-i-Chien
 Banner, Hsinan League, has increased its oxen from 83 to 114, its horses from 4 to

 Chungking said (28 Dec.) that the Miao and I groups in Kweichow have "shown their
 patriotism" by making grain deliveries ahead of schedule.  Another broadcast
 (29 Dec.) reported that the Sikang Provincial Government is training 260 cadres from
 among the national minorities, 170 of them Tibetans and others from among the I,

 work in the tea-growing areas of Tibet.  Chungking announced (2 Jan.) that Miao,
 Tibetan, and Han delegates attended the first People's Assembly at Moukung to
 discuss plans for organizing a united democratic government of all nationalities.

 Army in the Yunnan border area aided minority groups with their handicraft work.
 Now the minorities are comforting Army dependents during the New Year holidays.

 CN                      17 -
 111ver Problems: Wuhan announced (4 Jan.) that the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau,
 has set up steamship assignment commit-bees at Hankow, Shashih, Ichang, Wanhsien,
 and Chungking to "unify ship assignments so as to fully develop the ships' trans-
 portation capacities."                  In other words, the centralized control of shipping on the
 Yangtze is being strengthened.
 Yangchow said. (2 Jan.) that on the Huai River project Youth Corps workers have made
 a pledge to extend their term of service on the project and to improve their work.
 "'Various work teams are competing for the best showing."
 Welfare Activities: Hangchow said (27 Dec.) that nine public and Government organiza-
 ions now have sponsored the establishment of 32 day nurseries--mostly in connection
 with trade associations or factories--which care for 1,100 children.  Mukden reported
 (9 Jan.) that Communist Party cadres in Anshan had been commended for'their leader-
 ship in educating illiterate workers, 21,400 of whom, or 72.9 percent, have attended
 beginners' classes. Dairen reported (9 Jan..) that cadres in the local oil paper
 factories are demanding improved workers' welfare facilities.  A demand was made for
 a nursery last July, but nothing has been done about it.  Some workers were issued
 winter coats, while others were not, and the education of the workers has been
 neglected with the result that many "still hold feudalistic thoughts."
 Dairen announced (3 Jan.) that in 1951 the Department of Public Welfare rehabilitated
 3,003 beggars in the city, cured 139 opium addicts and arrested 9 opium peddlers.
 Wuhsi said (4 Jan.) that the People's Consultative Council of Sungkiang had alloted
 half of the hsien health budget of 1.8 million Yuan to combat schistosorniasis.
 Canton reported ($' Jan.) that additional public water stations had been installed in
 Canton to supply areas deficient in water.  Peking announced in numeral code (4 Jan.)
 that the Central Government had appropriated 3 billion yuan to relieve people of
 Lichiang, west Yunnan, where a severe earthquake was recorded 21 December.  Chungking
 said (7 Jan.) that the People's Assemblies in Lichiang had issued a statement of
 appreciation for assistance rendered earthquake victims by People's Liberation Army
 and civilian organizations.
 Physical Eer?cises:  Wuhan announced (9 Jan.) that a physical check-up of all high
 school students in Canton is in progress; from now on all students will be required
 to take physical training and attend health lectures.  Wuhsi announced (7 Jan.)
 that 10 organizations in Wuhsien had organized a committee to support the .morning
 exercise program.  (Nation-wide morning exercise broadcasts were inaugurated 1
 December, but very little interest has been reflected in regional broadcasts.)
 Burial Grounds:  A Hangchow broadcast (5 Jan.) said that the Hangchow Construction
 Department had issued a directive ordering construction of a central burial ground
 under its direction.  "Burial plots and markers must be uniform."
 Soviet Friendship:  The Peking Home Service announced (4 Jan.) that the PEOPLE'S
 DAILY was inaugurating a'news column on relations between China, and the USSR
 and other democracies "to give readers more information on these friendly relations."
 Overseas Chinese:  Canton announced (28 Dec,) that the South China Seamen's Union
 staged a welcome rally honoring, the 12 seamen expelled from America. Speakers reviewed
 the mistreatment of Chinese in America by secret agents, and extortions from
 arrested Chinese.
 Labor Problems:  Hankow reported (6 Jan,) that workers in the Wuhan Match Factory
 had organized a committee to "review activities of their union, thus increasing
 democracy in the ranks of the union."  Hankow said (8 Jan.) that the People's
 Court had given its approval to democratic reforms in the factories by setting up
 special courts for workers' problems.  Last year 2?0 cases were heard by these courts
 and 100 remain to be heard.  On 12 November gang bosses among the workmen were
 publicly tried and sentenced, "thus greatly increasing the people's respect for the
 courts."
