 U,S,-SOVIET RELATIONS
 MOSCOW JUS1"IFIES TRADE RUPTURES MINIMIZES EFFECT ON DETENTE
 Moscow,  in extensive comment: over the past week,  has  sought to  just' :fy
 its renunciation of the 1972 trade: agreement with the United Statec3
 as an appropriate response to the U.S. trade. legislation.  At the
 same time,Sovlet media have denl.ed tl?~at the action Implies any
 cha.zge in the Soviet commitment to detente.  't'hree themes have
 dominated this comment:  (1) the contention that the blame for the.
 episode rests with  tl~e  opponents of  detente  in  tl~e LI.S.  Congress,
 and that the Soviet act_;on was a justl.fiable response to an
 intolerable affront to national dignity; (2) a denial that the
 action implies a Soviet retreat from the goals of detente; and ~;3) an
 implied warning  tl~iat  a U.S.  fai].ur.e  to revise  tl~ie  trade legislation
 will result is a sh~.ft of Soviet trade to such U.S, competitors
 as West Germany, Great Britain, France, and Japan.
 TRADE CONDITIONS         The basis of the Soviet Union's self-justifying
 propaganda is the contention that the conditions
 that would have been imposed by the U.S. trade legislation amounted
 to an interference in soviet internal affairs.  The charac*_erizations
 of the conditions clearly imply that the complaints are directed
 at the provisions affecting Jewish emigration; specific refer?Ences
 to  tYie  credit  limitations have  been few.     Alelcsandr  Bovin,  ii.i an
 article in IZVESTIYA on 19 January, which appears to have been a
 keynote piece in this propaganda, described the conditions pis
 "economically discriminating," "politically Impermissible," and
 "insulting."  The U.S. Congressional action was the more indefensible,
 other commentators have asserted, in that the Sovie;: Union gave
 repeated warnings that it would not accept such conditions, and
 these warnings were reinforced by the U.S. Administration.
 Vitaliy Kobysh, in a New Yorlc-datelined TASS dispatch in IZVESTIYA
 on 18 January, observed sarcastically in this regard that only the
 American people were surprised by the Soviet action.  "The papers
 kept telling their readers that the Russians would agree to any
 concessions."  Commentators have also quoted extensively from U.S.
 public figures to support their contention that the Soviet action
 was justified.  President Furd, Secretary Kissinger, and two members
 of the U.S.-Soviet Tradt and Economic Council, John Connor and
 David KFUdall, have been  cited  as having expressed varying degress
 of crir_icism of the U.S. Congressio~.al action.

 TBI5 TRENDS
 22 JANUARY 1975
 DETENTE        Moscow has sought to limit the impact of its action by
 insisting that the overal], conditions favoring detente
 still prevail and that its own policy remains committed to the
 encouragement of mutually beneficial relations with the United
 States.  Nevertheless, it i~as introduced a tentative note into its
 assurances on this score by stressing the activities of detente
 opponents in the West, and by noting that future progress depends
 on the degree of cooperation shown by the United States,  Bovin,
 for example, noted that the U.S. Congressional action poses again
 the question of the "19.mits of confidence," of the "minimum of
 mutual understanding" without Wlilcll progress is impossible.
 Both Bovin and oilier commentators, however, have insisted that the
 Soviet commitment to detente remains unqualified.  Anatoliy Krasikov,
 in a TASS "International Revieeu" on 16 January  ridiculing Western
 speculation about a "sensational change" in Soviet foreign policy,
 asserted that "no change has taken place. and none could take
 place."  The Soviet Union is still committed to detente, he said,
 and is still committed to making it "irreversible."  Aleksandr
 Dr?uzhinin, in a Moscow domestic service broadcast on 20 January,
 affirmed that the cancellation of the trade agreement carried no
 broader implications, even in the sphere of trade itself.  "The
 Soviet Union is ready to cooperate with the United States in all
 spheres," he said, providing only that it be on the basis of
 equality.
 OTHER PARTNERS      A recurrent theme in Moscow's comment has been
 the implied warning that a failure of the United
 States to remove the restrictive conditions in its trade legislation
 would result in a shifting of Soviet trade to U.S. competitors in
 Europe and .Japan.  This point was driven home by an article in the
 London daily THE EVl;NIP1G HEWS on 15 January contributed by Victor
 Louis, the reported agent for many of Moscow's more sensitive
 foreign policy maneuvers.  Louis, purportedly reporting opinion held
 in Dioscow,wrote that anything the Soviet Union was going to get
 from the United States could be obtained elsewhere.  Noting that
 Japan, France, and West Germany already were doing good business
 with the USSR, including "the supply of America  equipment produced
 under license in their own countries," Louis a  ,rted that it was
 pointed cut in Moscow that Britain could suppl?     ie USSR with
 sophisticated equipment.  Referring to the upcu,. ~g visit of
 British Prime Minister Wilson to Moscow, Louis said it would be
 possible to negotiate increased British trade with the USSR.  He
 added that Soviet trade organizations would have time "t~ reassess
 the situation and draw up a list of orders that would have gone to

 the United States" which, lie observed, could set off a "trade
 boom" with Britain.  1-linting access to high Soviet officials,
 Louie claimed that "it was stressed" to him that the USSR's
 "technical dependence on Amer:Lca has been 'greatly overestimated'
 in the United States."  This very point that West Europe should
 now take advantage or the "propitious moment" to play its card and
 intensify its economic cooperation with the Soviet Union has been
 the thrust of much of-  the Soviet  comment on the  cancellation of
 the U.S. trade agreement, including the TZVESTIYA article by
 A. Bovin.
 EAST EUROPE ECHOES SOVIET THEMES ON TRADE-DETENTE ISSUE
 Moscow's orthodox East European allies and Yugoslavia, in the
 wake of Secretary Kissinger's 14 January press conference,
 have defended with varying degrees of vigor Moscow's renunciation
 of the 1972 U.S.-Soviet trade agreement.  At the same time, there is
 a tendency, particularly on the part of Budapest and Belgrade, to
 downplay the seriousness of the impasse and to keep the door open
 for possible reinstatement of the agreement on mutually acceptable
 terms.  There has been no comment so far from Poland--which, with
 Yugoslavia, already enjoys most-favored-nation-treatment in trade
 with the United states--or from Romania.
 Emphasizing tl-at it was not the USSR which was hardening its stance
 or acting contrary to the spirit of detente, a Raabe commentary in
 the East Berlin domestic service on the 17th declared that Congress had
 violated the Soviet-U.S. summit agreements by attempting to interfere
 in the USSR's internal affairs.  He cited the TASS commentary by
 Krasilcov on the 16th which had pointed out that the Soviet side would
 never consider posing preconditions regarding U.S, internal affairs.
 Raabe stressed teat it was in America's own national and commercial
 interest to have a workable trade agreement with the Soviet Union,
 citing Jolin Connor, head of the Moscow office of the U.S.-USSR Trade
 and Economic Council for the view that "the final word" on the trade
 issue had not yet been spoken in the United States.
 Similarly, an authoritative Dolezal article in the Prague party daily
 RUDE PRAVO on the 16th took a hard line in denouncing "unacceptable"
 features of the U.S. trade bill while predicting at the samr. rime that
 "realism" would ultimately prevail in U.S, trade policy toward t;te USS R
 and other socialist countries.  The article mentioned only in passing
 the "special discriminatory amendment" in the U.S. trade bill which made
 implementation of the 5 July 1974 Prague-Washington agreement on return

 of Czechoslovak gold conditional upon Prague's payment of 100 cents
 on the dollar to settle U.S, citizens' property claims against
 Czechoslovakia.          The  same  issue of.  itUUE PRAVO a:Lso reported  tl;e
 foreign committees of the two chambers of the Federal Assembly
 as merely "regretting" the terms of tl~e amendment affecting
 Czechoslovakia.
 Budapest media's notably voluminous comment on Secretary Kissinger's
 press conference showed characteristic concern both to support
 Moscow and to keep East-West channels of communication open.  Thus,
 while llungarian Deputy Premier liuszar declared in a Budapest radio
 interview on the 16th that the U.S. trade bill "does not suit our
 conceptions ei~her," a Moscow correspondent's comment carried by
 Budapest radio on the 19th was predominantly optimistic:
 Discounting any "permanent" damage to detente, the correspondent
 saw no signs of any change in plans for Brezhnev to visit the
 United States this year and sign there a nuclear arms limitation
 agreement.  lie added that Soviet-U.S. trade could still develop to
 some extent "even in the present conditions."  The same correspondent.
 in a 15 January broadcast, had concluded that the fact that the
 Soviet stand was made public through an announcement by Secretary
 Kissinger meant that the Soviet Union "does not wish to dramatize
 the situation."  On the 21st, MTI featured President Ford's state-
 ment at his press  conference that day to the effect that he expected
 detente to continue and expand despite Poscow's cancellation of the
 trade agreement.
 Yugoslav comment similarly combined stern denunciation of alleged
 "interference" features of the U.S. trade bill with assessments
 that the overall progress of detente had not suffered any decisive
 setback,  Uniquely, the Ljubljana DELO on the 16th foresaw ar_ the
 same time possible "serious internal political consequences" in the
 USSR if the trade deadlock should be construed as a failure of the
 peace policy spelled out by Brezhnev at the 24th CPSU Congress.
 Tirana,  in an  18 .1a^.:~ary ATA commentary,  attributed Moscow's
 cancellation of the 1172 trade agreement to chagrin over the public
 exposure of an alleged U.S.-Soviet secret deal to exchange most-
 favored-nation. status for the emigration of Soviet Jews.

 PRC CONGRESS NORMALIZES STATE APPARATUS, ELECTS OFFICIALS
 'L'he T'RC's 4th National People's Congress (NPC), held from 13-17
 January, has formalized state reforms produced by the cultural
 revolution and generally confirmed as state leaders men who have
 had much experience in the PRC bureaucracy.  The leadership of
 the State Council has been greatly strengthened by the naming of
 12 vice premiers, including eight active Politburo members and
 alternates.  The new organs make only a token bow to youthful
 activists, though the new constitution reiterates the principle
 of leadership by "the old, the middle-aged, and the young."
 Mao appeared neither at the Congress nor at the preceding party
 plenum, held from 8-10 January.  While actions taken by these
 sessions formally enhance Mao's power:., they seem clearly
 designed to insure an orderly succession when he ceases to be
 politically active.  As with the revised party constitution
 adopted in August 1973, all references to Mao in the new state
 constitution have beet dropped other than references to Mao
 Tse-tung Thought.
 The action of the party plenum in promoting Teng Hsiao-ping to
 party vice chairman and of the NPC in naming Chang Chun-Chian
 a vice premier seers designed to insure orderly civilian succession
 to Mao and Chou.  While neither man is necessarily in line for
 the top spot himself, the party and state power wielded by the
 two clearly overshadows that held by any other leaders under Mao
 and Chou except for Vice Chairman Yeh Chien-ying, who as a military
 leader is not thought to be eligible for the top party post.  Yeh
 was named defense minister by the NPC but was not made a vice
 premier, presumably to signal the limits of his state control.
 Like the 10th Party Congress in August 1973, the NPC was brief
 and held in secret.  Following completely the recommendations
 made by the party plenum, tl:P NPC unanimously adopted all resolu-
 tions on 17 January.  On its first day, the session Beard a
 report on the work of the government by Premier Chou ~n-laj, a
 report on the constitution by Chang Chun-chiao (delivered on
 behalf of the party), and received copies of the draft constitution.
 None of the reports or documents indicated any changes from current,
 moderate policy lines.  Chang's..report was closely tied to constitu-
 tional provisions.  Chows report hailed the victory of the cultural

 revolu!-1on and economic production.  lle referred repeatedly to
 P1ao's role in formulating poltcy and noted that the "primary
 task" is to deepen the anti-Lin Pi.ao and Coni'ucius novement;
 however, he did not indicate that mass movements would be
 revived,  rather  stressing  the  need  for sturdy and  cat?re  labor
 on a regular basis as the tools for insuring proletariar, rule.
 He noted that the masses must "deal steady, accurate and Bard
 blows at the handful of class enemi.es," c~~refully reiterating
 that "the emphasis" must be on "accuracy" in a clear attempt
 to reduce indiscriminate attacks on :Leaders.
 Cllou indicated that the 1974 grain Harvest was in the neighbor-
 hood of 2G0 million tons, but he did not supply any hard figures
 in enumerating PRC economic achievements.  Chou stated that the
 economic plan would proceed on lines ordered by I~1ao prior to
 the 3d NPC 10 years ago:  the economy will be developed in two
 stages with the first stage due for completion by ].980 and the
 second stage--putting China among the front ranks of developed
 countries--completed by the end of the century.  Chou claimed
 that the current five-year plan would be successfully completed
 this year and stated that the State Council would draw up a
 10-year plan, five-year plans and annual plans to promote ful-
 filling Iiao's  goal.
 STATE LEADERSHIP       P..11 members of the Politburo except for
 Mao, his chief bodyguard Wang 'lung-hsing,
 and Chi Teng-hues appeared at the NPC session.  Chi has made
 no public appearances since early December and may also be with
 Itao; he was once of the eight Politburo members made vice premiers.
 NCNA's 18 January list of state leaders listed the vice premiers
 in apparent party rank, with Teng first and Chang second, followed
 by Li i-Isien-nien, who has alternated with Teng in performing Chou's
 protocol duties while Chou has been in the hospital.  Peking PLA
 commander Chen Hsi-lien, the only active military leader among the
 vice premiers, was listed next above Chi.  Hua Kuo-?feng, ~vho was
 also named minister of public security, was ma~'e a vice premier,
 as was Chen 'Lung-kuei, the model peasant who led the Tachai
 production brigade.  Alternate Politburo member Wu iruei-hhien, a
 former model worker from Shensi, was named China's first woman
 vice premier.  Non-Politburo members named as vice premiers were
 two ministers,  Yu Clriu-li and  Ku I4u,  former minister [fang Chen,
 and Sun Chien, probably named as a bow to youth, who rose from
 u.nlcnowr_ origins to become an alternate member of the Central Com-
 mittee in 1973.

 PIINISTERS:  Of the 29 ministers appointed by the P1PC, over half
 were already serving in their positions and three held the
 identical positions prior to the cultural revolution.  At least
 seven were vice ministers of the same ministry or a predecessor
 ministry before the cultural revolution and one Beaded anothe1~
 ministry at that t:i.me.  Three ministers identified since the
 cultural revolution were replaced by the NPC.  Une, Minister of
 Sports Wang Meng, had not been identified by title since last
 February, though he appeared as a -~:esponsible person of the
 ministry in. September.  Former Dlinister of Communications Yang
 Chien, who was replaced by cultural revolution casualty Yeh Fei,
 appeared as minister in December.  Former Watar Conservancy and
 Power Minister Chang Wen-pi was last identified in his post in
 November.  All had military baclcgrounds, though Yang Chien had
 served in a civilian post in Kwangtung before coming to Peking,
 and their departures may reflect continuing moves to reduce PLA
 power in civil affairs.  Not all of- the military men brought
 into ministries during the cultural revolution tJere removed,
 however.  It is possible that they have chosen to resibn from
 the PLA rather than leave their posts.
 In areas which have been especially contentious since the
 cultural revolution--culture and education--a Chiang Ching
 supporter Yu Hui-yung was named minister of culture and an old
 Chou En-lai subordinate Chou Jung-hsin was given the ministry
 of education.  Yu leas been on the cultural croup under the state
 council and was named a deputy chief of the group, headed by
 Wu Te, last year.  Yu is the composer of two model operas and
 has frequently praised Chiang Ching.  In a speech reprinted in
 RED FLAG in aay 1967, he noted Chiang's personal l~zder~hip over
 culture and stated that in the model works, "Every word and sentence,
 every tune and beat, is permeated with heart blood of Comrade
 Chiang Ching."  Chou served as secretary-;eneral of the State
 Council prior to the cultural revolution and also held other party
 and state posts.
 Only two critical mi.nistries.are headed by Politburo members.  Yeh
 Chien-ying formally assumed control of the defense ministry, which
 he has headed in fact since Lin's demise, and Hua Kuo-feng was
 named minister of public security.  Hua came up through the
 bureaucracy~in Iiur_an and became the top official there in 1970.  He
 has spent most of his time in Peking in recent years and was elected
 to the Politburo at the 10th Party Congress in 1973.  Hua was
 concurrently elected a vice premier by tre NPC, but Yeh was not--
 apparently another sign of Peking's sensitivity about giving civil
 power to military leaders.

 NPC LZ;All);RSIiIP,  LOCAL IL:PIt);SLNTn'"TVLS :   Most of  the NPC  leadership
 consists of aging, semi-retired Politburo members and former
 members plus a sprinkling of minority nationality and women
 representatives.  NPC Chairman Chu Te and six of the vice chairman
 are Politburo members or altcrnatest  four of these leaders are
 known to be in very poor health; two are members o:E minority
 nationalities;  the other  is Peking chief  1.7u Te wllo is  frequently
 called upon to entertain foreign guests and may have been named
 to the post to ease p1?otocol problems.  Wu was also secretary-
 general of the session, but follo~?aing the congress the NPC
 Standing Committee named Cliff Peng-fee, former Chinese minister
 of L-oreign affairs until last November, to the post.  fix
 former members of the Politburo were also made NPC vice chairman
 as were other perennials, including Sure Yat-sen's widow Soong
 Ching-ling, Li ru-chun's widow Tsai Chang, and Lu Hsun's brother
 Chou Chien-j en.  The only possible concession to the principle
 ~~
 of  old, middle-aged and young  may leave been the naming of a
 Shensi trade union official as a new vice chairman.  Among the
 members of the standing committee, youth was represented by
 Chang Tieh-sheng from Liaoning, noted for "going against the
 tide" on educational policy in the summer of 1973 and Lu Yu-?lan.
 from I-lopeh, a young woman noted as a revolutionary rural leader.
 There was some increase in the number of women named to the
 standing committee, including the wife of purged Politburo
 member Tao Clue, who did not himself reappear for the occasion.
 Leery military region leader was elected a member of the presidium
 of the NPC, as were most provincial first secretaries.  Not
 reported at  the session were Ileilunglci.ang first secretary ldang
 Chia-tao and Shansi first secretary Hsieh Chen-hua, c~ho have
 apparently beets under attack in their provinces and have made no
 pubJ.ic appearances since early last year other than in Pekiiib on
 National Day.  Tlie only other first secretary not elected to the
 presidium, Tsingliai chief Liu IIsien-chuan, has been occupied with
 other duties in Peking for years and may leave previously lost his
 post; he made relatively few public appearances last year and
 was identified only as a Central Committee member or as a PLA
 official.  Tsing~,ai second secretary and military district commander
 Chang Chiang-lin was also not elected to the presidium.
 CONSTITUTIONAL   Although the new constitution conta=.ns no direct
 CHANGES          reference to "Chairman i~iao," it formalizes his
 control over the military by placing the office
 of the chairman of the CCP in command of the armed Forces, a power
 which the previot~.s constitution, adopted in 1954, had given to the
 now abolished post of head of state.  By focusing on the institutional

 role of  the office of  the chairman of:  the  pa;:~y,  rather  than on
 Iiao himself, the constitution appears aimed at providing the
 frame;vorlc necessary for a smooth organi.zationaJ transition whin
 I1ao eventually leaves the political scene.
 '1'he new constitution drops all of the personal references to
 Iiao which were contained in the 1970 draft constitution, a
 document presumably bearing the imprint of Lin Piao, who has
 been charged with building a cult of personality around 1-tao
 in order to advance his own standing within tl~~e party and army.
 Placing more stress  on the  ptt. ty's  role in  guiding state affairs,
 the new constitution omits the draft's reference to I1ao as "head
 of the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat" as well as
 the draft's characterization of Iiao as L-l~e "supreme commander"
 of the PLA.  The constitution also fails to include the draft's
 statement that it is one of the duties of PRC citizens tc "support
 Chairman I~lao," substituting  instead the need  to  "support  the
 leadership of the CCP."  The conetitution~iiowever, officiaJ.ly
 enshrines Iiao's Thought,  noting  that  the party  is  tiie core  of
 leadership of  the whole  Chinese  people and  that  ""?Tarxism-L~eninism-
 Ilao Tse-tung Tlwught is the theoretical basis guiding the thinking
 of our nation."
 llISSENT:  Aside from the low-keyed treatment given to 'tao personally,
 the only other major difference in tine new constitution compared
 with the 1970 ciraft version is a passage noting that citizens have
 the right to lodge written or oral complaints to organs of state at
 any level regarding "transgressions of law or neglect of duty on
 the part of any person working in an organ of. state" and that no
 one will be allowed to "Binder or obstruct the making of such com-
 plaints or retaliate."  The righr_ to file complaints without fear
 of retaliation with hither level authorities was written into
 the party constitution at the 10th party congress in August 1973
 and a  similar statement was also included in the list of rights
 given PRC citizens in the 1954 constitution.  Like the 1970 draft
 version, the new constitution contains 30 articles compared with
 the 106 articles of the 1954 constitution.
 NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS:  The section in the 1954 constitution
 devoted to the office of the chief of state has been eliminated
 in the new constitution.  The former duties of Liu Shao-cliff, the
 P1tC's las*_ chief  of  staE.e,  remain within  the  NPC and  presumably
 will be exercised by  Cliu 'I'e  as  IQPC chairman.      By making  the

 continue as organs of self-government for minority rationalities
 and to "exer_ise autonomy within the limits of their authnr.ity

 vi.e.ws lie had presented in his  report at  t11e  10th party congress
 i.ri August 1973--iris last comprehensive discussion of foreign
 affairs.  His NPC report was particularly notable for its image
 of a world situation markedly favorable to China.  Chou did
 give more credence to the possibility that contention between the
 superpowers could lead to world war, but leis remarks were couched
 3.n a theoretical framework and did not picture China as threatened.
 He assessed Sino-U.S. relations in positive terms, but lie bluntly
 characterized Sino-Soviet relations as at a standstill.

 WORLD VIEW        Chou departed in two respects from the PRC line
 on world war ,.incl  revolution  that has been  standard
 1'or almost five years.  ile said that the "fierce contention"
 between the Un:l.tecl States and the Soviet Union "i.s bound to lead
 to world war some clay," and he was equ].voenl as to whether war or
 revolution was more likely, saying th;.tt "the factors for both
 revolut].on and war ar..~ increasing."  lly contrast, C1-ou at the
 1Otlt party congress  had quoted  the passage in Mao 'Tse-lung's
 20 May 197(1 statement that while "the danger of new world war
 still exists," revolution a~inst .imperialism is the "main trend"
 in tite world today.  '1.'he Mao formulation has been f.reyuently
 quoted in authoritative Chinese comment up Lo the present.
 Reflecting his balrtnced view of war and revol.utj.on, Chou appeared
 sanguine about the strength of the 7.'hird World, and he declared
 that "whether war paves rise to revolution or revolution prevents
 war, in either case the int-e.inational. situation will develop in a
 direction favorrtble to the people ."  This assertion is
 similar to Lin Piuo's remark at the 9th CCP Congress in April
 1969 when he cited a Ma.; quotation to the effect that either
 world war wi.11 give rise ro revolution or r.evolul?lon will prevent
 war.
 Chov's remark on the inevitability at some future time of a
 military confrontation between the two superpowers seemed aimed
 primarily at disparaging the notion of possible U.S.-Soviet
 relaxation of tensions under the cover of detente.  At the
 same time, he voiced continued support for Peking's flexible
 foreign policy appru~ch under the banner of Mao's "revolutionary
 line in foreign affairs," and he gave hei.gh~ened attention to
 improving ties with the developed countries of the so-called
 Second World.  Thus, he offered Peking's highest level
 endorsement for West European unity against superpower threats
 and bullying;, and voiced Chinese readiness to p-omote friendly
 relations with Japan on the basis of the 1p72 Sino-Japanese
 statements.  Chou reaffirmed China's intention never to he a
 superpower, its solidarity with the Third World, and its intention
 to uphold proletarian internationalism.  He also promised to
 enltanr_e ties with "socialise- ccuntries."
 SINO-U.S. RELATIONS       Chou echoed Iris assessment at the party
 congress that Sino-U.S. relations "Dave
 improved to some extent" over the past three years.  However, he
 added a phrase giving credit to the United States as well as to
 ~e  ror recent background on this subject, see the TRENDS of

 the PRC, stat?ing L?hat improvement had been achieved through

 exist fundaments]. differences between C1-ina and the United
 States,"  he expressed confidence +~~~at  bilateral  relations Drill
 continue to improve so long as the two countries carry out
 ":In earnest" the principles of the Shanghai communi~;ue.
 Chows assurance stands in contrast to his def:ensJVe 1973
 assessment of PRC ties with Washington, when he had gone to
 great lengths to rationalize the need for "necessary compromises
 between revolutionary countries and imperialist countries."
 SuggestinE that at that time he was having some difficulty
 ;justifying Sino-U.S. detente to more rigid ideologies at home
 or abroad, Chou at the party congress had cited Leninist
 scripture to distinguish Peking's new policy from Soviet
 collaboration with Washington.  Observing that "there are
 compromises and compromises," Chou had hammered leis point home
 by invoking Lenin's conclusion of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty
 and contrasted it with the "doings of Khrushchev and Brez`anev"
 as "betrayers of Lenin."
 Chou in his much shorter NPC report did not repeat his 1973
 references to U.S, "defeats" in Korea and Vietnam and to the
 "decline" of U.S. power over the past generation.  And,
 although he continued to list the United States ahead of the
 Soviet Union in commenting on the ~uperl~owers, he dropped x:11
 reference to "U.S. imperialism," which lead been cited frequently
 in leis 1973 report.  The premier gave only routine atter.t.ion to
 Taiwan, reaffirming determination to "liberate" the island while
 calling on "fellow countrymen" on Taiwan to join in the liberation
 struggle.
 SING-SOVIET REiATIONS     Though his discussion of the USSR was
 shorter and less polemical than his
 anti-Soviet diatribe at the 1973 party congress, Chou characterized
 Sino-Soviet relations as at a standstill, openly attacked Soviet
 "deception" on the border issue, and challenged Moscow to meet
 Chinese demands concerning the frontier.  Chou accused the "Soviet
 leading clique" or ha-~ing betrayed Marxism-Leninism and of having
 taken a series of actions--including subversion and provoking of
 armed clashes along the frontier--to worsen state relations with
 China.  In his first public dis~ussior~ of the Sino-Soviet border
 talks since they began in October 1969, Chou repeated charges

 which were contained in the Chinese message to tl;e USSR on the
 6 November October Revolution anniversary and in an article: in
 the December issue of the Chinese journal HISTORICAL 5TUDIL.S.*
 Chou claimed that Moscow is totally responsible for the lack of
 progress because it has refused to adhere to the PRC-USSR
 underst:,~nding reached during the September 1q~9 Peking meeting
 between Chou and Kosygin that led to the start of the formal
 border talks.  He said that the understanding included an accord
 on mutual non-aggression and non-use of force, as well as
 agreement to withdraw forces from disputed border areas.**
 Chou said that Moscow has refused to do anything about with-
 drawing from disputed areas, and has even denied the existence
 of disputed border areas.  He accused the Russ:.ans of talking
 profusely about "empty treaties" on non-use of force and non-
 aggression in order to deceive Soviet and world opinion, and
 advised Moscow to stop its "deceitful tricks," negotiate honestly
 and. "do something" to solve "a bit" of the border problem.
 *  The charges in these pronouncements are discussed in the TRENDS
 SUPPLEMENT of 10 January 1975 "Peking Ends Silence on Border Talks,
 Assails Moscow's Stance."
 i  This marks the first time Chinese willingness to consider a non-use
 of force and non-aggression pact with the USSR under terms of the
 alleged Chou-Kosygin understanding has been reported to the Chinese
 people.  It had been publicized earlier by Peking in the 6 November
 1974 PRi; message to the USSR, but that message was never publicized
 for tl-e Chinese domestic audience.

 M'JSCUVJ ASSAILS Al_LON VISIT, U,S~-ISRAELI "PRESSURE" ON ARABS
 Sovl.et  COlmllellt  on  Tsraell foreign Minister.  A].:1on's :lS-17  January
 talks in Washington has disiaissecl any idea that- the discussions
 might contribute to improved prospects for new Israeli-Egyptian
 and/or Israeli-Jordanian negotial-ions.  Rather, hl~scow typically
 has viewed the All.on talks as the latest- ~a a tong series of
 Israeli requests for increased financial and military assistance.
 In this context, Soviet- media have denounced an alleged U.~.-Israeli
 joint strategy of "comprehensive intimidation" designed to impose
 disadvantageous bilateral arran;aments on individual Arab states
 by exertinb a var.icty of psychological and military pressures on
 them.  As in other comment i.n past months, Moscow has also continu..~d
 to convey resentment at being left on the diplomatic sidelines,
 accusing Washington and "1'el Aviv of seeking through "partial solutions"
 to postpone, if nut prevent altogether, a comprehensive Mideast
 settlement at a reconvened Geneva conference.
 PARTIAL AGREEMENTS          Soviet comment on the Allon. visit has
 continued to expound on t-ht dangers to Arab
 unity posed by ill-intentionc~i proposals for "interim" solutions,
 indicating that Egypt was the primary--and perhaps receptiv~a--target
 of such approaches.  I'LVL'STIYA's Koryavin, in a Beirut dispatch
 on the 14th, pointed out that Arab press coverage of A11on's visit
 emphasized the danger to the pan-Arab c~~tuse presented by "a so-called
 'stage-by-stage' or 'interim settlement."'  And a Moscow domestic
 servic^_ commentary on the 17th, dismissing as "publicity fuss"
 various Western media reports of new Israeli negotiating flexibility,
 cited file Syrian AL-BA'Tll as charging that Tel Aviv's po?icy aimed
 at creating "the appearance of movement toward peace" by means of
 partial withdrawal, a plan the paper assessed as "unacceptable in
 principle."
 PRAVDA's i~tternational review on the 19th, reported that day by
 Moscow radio's Arabic service, noted "comers swirling around" that
 Allows visit might be followed soon by a U.S. announcement along
 the lines that "Israel  has agreed to withdraw a few kilometers
 further from the Sinai and Jordan River in exchange for political
 concesr,ions from Cairo and Amman."  PRAVDA deno~inced this idea for
 its om~~.ssion of Syrian and Palestinian interests and f.or its aim of
 dividing t-he Arab confrontation states by offering them "individual
 deals."    A hiayevskiy article  in PRAVDA on  tl~e 18th,  along  the same
 lines, charged that *_he United #tates was striving to "neutralize"

 Egypt by offering it certain concessions from Israel and isolating
 it from united acr_ion witl- Syria and ether. Arab countries.
 SADAT INTERVIEW        Moscow's handling of a recent interview by
 President as-Sadat served to reinforce Soviet
 criticism of the "U.S.-Israeli step-by-step approach," citing the
 president as rejecting unilateral agreements, but p7.aying down his
 indication of- willingness to consider a new set of negotiations
 on Sinai.  I;1tAVDA's Cairo correspondent Glukhov, in a dispatch
 in the paper on the 18th, asserted that as-Sadat had "reiterated
 that Egypt rejects a unilateral agreement. with Israel on the Sinai
 peninsula" and that Cairo insists on such a withdrawal taking place
 in the next three months "accompanied by simultaneous withdrawal
 from occupied Syrian and Jordanian territories."  liowever, in the
 interview, published In the 16 January Beirut AN-NAIlAI2, as-Sadat
 was quoted as saying that although the next withdrawal must be on
 all three fronts within three months, "Egypt considers it tre~ison
 to refuse, for any reason, any occupied Arab land which the enemy
 returns to us."
 While seemingly disinclined to acknowledge this statement, Glukhov
 did cite an 18 January Cairo AL-AHRAM editorial which, he said,
 "explained the Egyptian position."  Glukhov reported AL-AHRAM as
 saying that Egypt did not reject the principle of a phased solution
 or "any opportunity for getting back the Arab territories."  liowever,
 according to Glukhov, the editorial declared that Cairo "categorically
 opposes a partial or. separate settlement with just one of the Arab
 states" and firnily asserted that Egypt "will not tolerate maneuvers
 that undermine the main objective."
 KISSINGCR VISIT,      1`Ioscow has given bare,;t acknowledgment of the
 FORD STATEMENTS       possibility of anew Kissinger visit to the
 rli.ddle East.  A TASS dispatch on the 18th,
 reporting the conclusion of Allon's Washington talks, noted that
 the Israeli foreign minister had said that Secretary Kissinger
 "accepted 'in principle' an invitation to visit Israel after he
 manages to coordinate a new 'interim' agreement with ~:gypt."
 TASS added that Allon had emphasized that there had beEn no U.S.
 pressure "whatsoever with the aim of persuading Israel into
 starting earnest negotiations or taking some def;.nite attitude"
 on them.
 Reporting President Ford's interview j.n the 20 January issue of
 TIP~E magazine, a TASS English dispatch on ~'~e 13th noted that in
 answering a question on the t`lideast situation and the U.~. and
 Soviet roles, the President responded t?:at the USSR wants "to refer

 these matters to the consideration" of the Geneva conference (the
 President actually said the USSR "wants t o throw all of these issues
 into Geneva").  TASS quoted the President  as saying that "we do
 not rule out Geneva at a point, but we feel that in the interim
 before we go to Geneva we ought to try and malts some other additional
 progress on a step-by-step basis."
 A TASS English report on President Ford's 21 January press conference
 cited hits as saying that the danger of war in the area was "very
 serious" and in order to avoid that "we are maximizing our diplomatic
 efforts."  TASS summarized part of the President's remarks on U.S.
 arms deliveries to Mideast countries, observing that he "upheld the
 pc~'.icy of intensifying deliveries of U.S.  armament to the Middle
 )vast," primarily to Israel, "justifying" that by the need to maintain
 the internal security of the various countries as well as to
 "maintain military equilibrium."*
 *  TASS on the 21st reported a New York TIMES item on the Allon aid
 discussions, highlighting the reportedly three-fold increase in the
 military-economic aid request ar.d noting that the new two-billion-dollar
 total had been exceeded only once before in  the history of U.S.-Israeli
 relations.
