 THE SOVIET WORLD
 The Soviet Orbit is continuing its attempts to lure the
 Western European nations away from their alliance with the
 United States.
 Several Eastern European Satellites have invited British
 Labor Party, trade union, or business delegations to make
 visits, and the British Parliament has accepted an invitation
 for a delegation to visit Moscow in the fall.   In Moscow and
 Peiping, the Communists have received the current British Labor
 Party delegations in courtly fashion, attempting to prove that
 the red carpet has replaced the iron curtain.
 Peiping used the occasion to develop the propaganda themes
 of China's great-power status and its interest in peaceful co-
 existence with all countries.  Peiping emphasized the prospects
 for increased Sino-British trade, which it claims is now limited
 only by the American-sponsored embargo and the American-directed
 seizure of British ships by the "Chiang Kai-shek pirates."
 Moscow's trade program continues to support its strategy
 of courting Western European countries.  The USSR is still ex-
 porting precious metals on a large scale in order to finance
 its expanding imports from the West.  These exports, together
 with increased deliveries of such commodities as petroleum
 products, manganese ore, and chrome ore, more than offset the
 sharp curtailment in traditional Soviet grain exports.
 Soviet gold sales, which were accelerated to a level
 exceeding $100,000,000 in the last quarter of 1953, have con-
 tinued high in 1954.  The value of shipments to the West in
 the first four months of this year'is estimated at from
 $60,000,000 to $100,000,000.   In addition, negotiations have
 been reported for the sale of a further $150,000,000 worth of
 gold.  As in the past, the major sales are being made in the
 London market, with lesser quantities being sold in France.
 Recently, the USSR also delivered $5,000,000 worth of gold to
 Finland as a partial payment on its trade deficit with that
 country.
 As for the Soviet economic program aimed at the under-
 developed countries, a Soviet invitation issued at last Feb-
 ruary's meeting of the UN Economic Commission for Asia and the
 Far East for delegates from Asian countries to visit the USSR
 to observe industrial and economic developments was accepted
 by India, Pakistan, Burma, Afghanistan, Indonesia, and Japan.

 PROSPECTS DIM FOR DEVELOPING STRONG
 GOVERNMENT IN FREE VIETNAM
 Prospects for developing a strong non-Communist government
 in south Vietnam are not favorable.   In addition to Communist
 subversive activity, the present Vietnamese government must
 contend with unfriendly French authorities who regard its out-
 spoken nationalism as inimical to their interests.
 Premier Ngo Dinh Diem's government,  like its predecessors,
 is weak and inexperienced and Bao Dai's public announcement that
 he intends to return soon to Vietnam and to lend Diem his "full
 support" is at best a dubious asset for non-Communist Vietnam.
 Diem's government would almost certainly lose to the Viet Minh
 in any nationwide election in the near future.  Diem is rigid
 in his thinking and ill-informed on many matters of practical
 administration.   Presumably on moral grounds,  he has not yet
 taken into his government representatives of the Cao Dai and
 other war lord sects in southern Vietnam.
 Since Geneva,  the Viet Minh has sought to undercut Vietnam-
 ese authority in the south by circulating "election registers"
 which virtually force the inhabitants to declare themselves
 publicly for Ho Chi Minh.   The Viet Minh has also organized
 demonstrations which have proved politically embarrassing to
 the Vietnamese authorities.   A major form of Viet Minh political
 action has been to discourage northern Vietnamese from seeking
 refuge in the south.   The Viet Minh seems to have a genuine
 fear that such an exodus would cast some reflection on its
 popularity.
 Despite the weakness of Diem's government, American offi-
 cials in Vietnam believe it has a greater potential for winning
 wide popular support than any available successor.   Its leader-
 ship is irreproachably nationalist and unprecedentedly honest.
 Its anti-Communism is genuine,  not opportunistic,  and Premier
 Diem enjoys wide personal respect for his integrity.
 Whether this government can cope with the enormous prob-
 lems thrust on it by the Geneva settlement, however, remains
 uncertain.   Its task has been considerably complicated by the
 strenuous efforts of the French to discredit Diem with a view
 to installing a more pliable government built around a group
 of Cochinchinese opportunists.   The heavy emphasis French
 officials,  both in Paris and Saigon,  have placed during the
 past few weeks on the present government's ineptitude   suggests
 they want to convince American officials of Diem's incapacity
 before attempting any overt move against him.

 More recently, French opposition to Diem appears to have
 taken a subtler form, perhaps as a result of Bao Dai's intention
 to return to Vietnam.  The legality of any change in the Vietnam
 government is at least nominally subject to Bao Dai's approval,
 and the current French policy is to prevent his return to
 Vietnam, where he may be less subject to French control.
 The French have taken steps to warn Diem that his most
 dangerous enemy is the Bao Dai-controlled police force, and to
 persuade him to "broaden" his government.  The French aim
 appears to be to embroil Diem with Bao Dai while bringing into
 cabinet positions, and perhaps the premiership, representatives
 of the Cochinchina separatist faction.
 The French clearly fear that Diem's uncompromising nation-
 alism may lead him to take measures harmful to French economic
 and bureaucratic interests.  Any authentic nationalist govern-
 ment is certain sooner or later to levy heavy if not confisca-
 tory taxes on French businesses and greatly to diminish the role
 of the French Indochina bureaucracy.
 The French may also fear that Diem's belligerent attitude
 toward the Viet Minh and his avowed irredentism with respect to
 northern Vietnam might at some time embroil their expeditionary
 corps in further hostilities with the Viet Minh.
 Finally, in the absence of a clear-cut policy to the con-
 trary, there is a strong inclination on the part of many French
 officials and private citizens to pursue a policy of business as
 usual with the Viet Minh--a policy which could hardly be recon-
 ciled with a strong nationalist government in the south.
 The French policy of resisting nationalism and encouraging
 the seizure of power by an unpopular, Francophile clique in
 Cochinchina will greatly enhance the power of the Viet Minh to
 develop political strength in the south.  The French apparently
 hope to maintain some sort of special status in.Vietnam over the
 long run, notwithstanding a Viet Minh takeover of the entire
 country.   This French status might take the form of permission
 to continue to operate French cultural, scientific, and economic
 establishments and to maintain at least nominally Vietnam's
 association with the French Union.

 THE FRENCH COMMUNIST PARTY AND MENDES-FRANCE
 The French Communists, who at their national congress
 in June publicly admitted some weakening of party strength,
 consistently supported Mendes-France for the first two months
 of his premiership in the evident belief that he offered the
 best chance of reorienting French foreign policy.   The "hard
 line" that had led to the anti-Ridgway riots in 1952 was re-
 adopted at the congress, however, and will probably be empha-
 sized as the premier's public tactic favoring German rearma-
 ment forces the party to recognize the ineffectiveness of its
 conciliatory tactics for blocking EDCS
 At the June congress, the first in four years, acting
 party chief Duclos openly admitted a drop in membership and
 expressed particular alarm over the decline in members from
 the working class.  Membership is now estimated at 400,000,
 or only about half that claimed in 1950; but the party con-
 tinues to attract about a quarter of the French electorate.
 By again emphasizing the "hard line" of violent polit-
 ical  demonstrations, the congress tacitly admitted that
 appeals for unity of action with other parties had not
 succeeded in blocking EDCO   The surprise investiture of
 Mendes-France ten days after the congress ended, however,
 apparently encouraged new efforts at parliamentary co-opera-
 tione  Following Mendes-France's abortive investiture bid in
 June 1953, Communist spokesmen had indicated that they would
 have backed him had he proposed an immediate end to the Indo-
 china war, and in October 1953 acting party chief Jacques
 Duclos pledged support for any government opposing the EDC
 treaty.
 The Communists' general line on Mendes-France has been
 that he represents a complete break with previous French
 "subordination" to American foreign policy.  Although he has
 rejected their support and strongly denounced the party, their
 press eschewed direct criticism of the premier until mid-
 August even on his decision to seek authority to send con-
 scripts to Indochina if the Geneva negotiations had failed.
 Moreover, despite the national congress dictum, the
 party has continued to avoid mass action and other demonstra-
 tions which might provoke government interference.   It quietly
 accepted the government's refusal to renew the passport of
 Benoit Frachon, secretary general of the Communist-dominated

 General Labor Confederation, and it raised only mild objec-
 tions to the ban on the traditional party-sponsored Bastille
 Day parade.
 Although the Communist bloc in the National Assembly
 abstained in the 10 August vote granting the premier special
 powers to carry out his economic program, Communist propa-
 ganda and action since the Geneva conference point up the
 apparent desire to back Mendes-France at least until the
 French government takes positive steps to permit German re-
 armament.
 The Communists have soft-pedaled demands for economic
 reform, playing down nationalization, and stressing only the
 need for an improved standard of living.  Parliamentary leader
 Duclos explained their abstention from the 10 August vote on
 the ground that it represented an expression of confidence in
 the whole policy of the government, which might include steps
 toward EDC ratification.   On the same day, the Communists did
 vote confidence in the premier's Tunisian reform program,
 presumably interpreting this as a further step toward a re-
 orientation of French foreign policy.  However, Mendes-France's
 public statement on 14 August that France must accept German
 rearmament provoked a direct attack on him, with the charge
 that he is pushing EDC through in an essentially unchanged
 form.
 Even if the assembly rejects EDC, the Communists will
 now probably continue their attacks on Mendes,-France,
 particularly since they evidently have no intention of aid-
 ing him to put through a program leading to a rehabilitation
 of the French economy.

 DISRUPTION TO SHIPPING IN THE CHINA TRADE
 MAJOR PROBLEM TO PEIPING
 The disruption to shipping in the China trade caused by the
 Nationalist blockade has been financially costly to the Orbit
 and may force Peiping to take positive action.  Since the
 seizure of the Russian tanker Tuapse on 23 June, all ships with
 industrial cargo from Eastern Europe have offloaded in South
 China for shipment north by rail, due to fear of the Chinese
 Nationalist navy around Formosa.
 The recent floods have washed out portions of both north-
 south rail lines with the result that the part of this route
 inside China is now closed.   In effect, the Nationalists have
 deprived North China of industrial goods from Eastern Europe,
 which are usually seaborne.   The extra shipping costs which
 accrued to China, the USSR and Poland during the past two months
 are probably equivalent to over $2,000,000.
 Besides these major and growing economic considerations,
 Peiping and the USSR have lost face as a result of the detention
 of the Tuapse and the aircraft incidents near Hainan Island
 which stemmed from Communist efforts to provide air-sea escorts
 in the South China Sea.   Moscow apparently has withdrawn its
 ships from the Europe-China run, at least temporarily.   No
 Russian ship has begun to load in Europe for China since the
 Tuapse seizure, whereas during the first seven months of 1954,
 Soviet ships carried 30 percent of Chinese seaborne imports
 from Eastern Europe.
 These factors may soon .compel the Communists to attempt to
 provide escort. around Formosa,.or to route shipping far enough
 east of Formosa to be safe, or else to start.carrying a`large
 part of Sino-Satellite trade on the trans-Siberian railroad, a
 costly alternative.
 The continued.failure to route ships bound for North China
 east of the Philippines and outside the estimated 500-mile range
 of the Nationalist   navy may reflect uncertainty as to the real
 strength of the Nationalists.   It may, however, have more
 ominous implications--namely, that Peiping and Moscow are
 unwilling to have commercial shipping in an area where military
 operations may be contemplated.

 Chou En-lai,in his report on foreign affairs made at the
 33rd session of the Central People's Government Council held on
 11 August, admitted the existence of a blockade of the East China
 coast  when he stated that the United States had given support
 "to the blockade of our coast by the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek
 group."   Prior to this time the disruption of shipping was
 referred to merely as piracy and harassment.
 Since 23 June, delays and rerouting of Soviet.vessels alone
 are estimated to have cost the USSR $500,000.  Polish ships are
 also subject to these delays.   In addition to the extra costs
 of shipping goods overland, export cargoes have not always been
 available for ships in South China, forcing them to return to
 Europe empty.   Total shipping costs to the bloc have clearly
 amounted to millions of dollars.
 Whampoa, South China's only port, which has dock facilities
 for no more than two ocean-going vessels at one time, has been
 jammed for weeks.  Two Russian tankers which were in the South
 China Sea in June were subsequently diverted to Whampoa, and
 one is still there.   Another tanker,  the Polish Wspolpraca,
 recently arrived at Whampoa.  Due to limited fuel storage
 capacity there,  it is doubtful that tankers can be handled at
 a faster rate than one every three or four weeks.
 In addition to these three tankers, ten cargo ships with
 59,000 tons of dry cargo have arrived at Whampoa since 10 July,
 and four more Soviet bloc ships are now in Far East waters
 heading for the port.

 END OF OVERT SOVIET CONTROLS IN EAST GERMANY MAY BE NEAR
 The abolition on 6 August of all Soviet occupation legis-
 lation on political, economic and cultural matters in East .
 Germany is the most dramatic step by the USSR to enhance'the
 prestige and ostensible freedom of the East German government
 since the granting of sovereignty on 26 March.   The principal
 Soviet motives are to promote East Germany as a partner in
 international negotiations, to stimulate French-West German
 differences, and thus to delay EDC.
 Major features of the grant of sovereignty to the German
 Democratic Republic are the actual reduction of the authority
 of the Soviet high commission provided in the 26 March protocol
 and the withdrawal of its branch offices in the districts of
 East Germany and in Berlin announced on 19 June.   On 7 August
 the high commission vacated its quarters in the Berlin suburb
 of Karlshorst and moved to the Soviet embassy, apparently in
 order to give a diplomatic facade to its future activities.
 The East German regime has been permitted to take the
 initiative in a trade offensive in the West and is attempting
 to establish official trade delegations in Western countries
 as a first step toward recognition.   It has also been given
 authority over the movements in East Germany of members of the
 Western military missions accredited to the Allied Control
 Authority in Berlin.   This does not offset the United States,
 Britain, and France.  In addition,  the control of the East
 German borders, including customs, has been transferred from
 Soviet authorities to the East German government.
 These measures have not reduced the real controls by
 which the USSR ensures the obedience of a puppet regime.   The
 Socialist Unity Party (SED) has succeeded to much of the overt
 authority formerly exercised by the Soviet occupation adminis-
 tration.   Additional control measures are provided by sub-
 stantial Soviet secret police elements and the 400,000-man
 occupation army, whose 22 divisions are more than enough to
 quell a popular uprising.   The Soviet high commissioner still
 has sweeping powers under four-power legislation which
 authorizes  him to assume supreme control of the country at
 any time.  Some economic activities are subject to the broad
 control of the Moscow-dominated Council of Mutual Economic
 Assistance,   Moreover, the Soviet Union will continue to
 exercise close direction over East German exports, particularly
 those that go to the USSR on preferential terms.

 In strengthening the German Democratic Republic's claim
 to sovereignty, the USSR is attempting to promote the regime
 as a worthy participant in all-German and international con-
 ferences and in the Molotov security pact.   The Soviet Union
 appears to be relying increasingly on its campaign for East-
 West German unity talks as a means of postponing four-power
 debate on a peace treaty and free elections, questions on
 which the Kremlin suffers from an embarrassing lack of flex-
 ibility.
 A principal feature of the program to bring East and West
 Germans together is the easing of restrictions on travel and
 communications between the two parts of Germany.   In addition,
 the East German government has urged Germans from East and
 West to meet for discussions of many political, economic and
 cultural subjects.   A singular success was realized when the
 regime permitted the Evangelical Church congress to be held
 in Leipzig in July in an atmosphere of freedom not usually
 associated with Communist countries.
 Another purpose of making ostensible grants of sovereignty
 at this time is to engender increasing friction between France
 and West Germany over the limitations on Bonn's sovereignty
 and any further delays or changes proposed by France in EDC.
 Without surrendering any of its physical control, the
 Soviet Union will probably continue to make seemingly generous
 gestures by giving ostensibly greater freedom and authority
 to the East German regime.   Such steps might include the aboli-
 tion of the Soviet high commission, already reduced in scope,
 and the establishment of an East German national airline or
 merchant marine.
 In spite of Soviet steps to make the East German regime
 appear to be a sovereign government, there will be little in-
 clination in the West to grant recognition.  Some countries,
 however, may want to deal with the regime on an official level
 in order to resolve problems of trade and transportation.   In
 West Germany there has been much skepticism about these Soviet
 moves, and there is at the moment  little enthusiasm for
 negotiations with the East German regime.

 SATELLITE REACTION TO WESTE NrFLOOD RELIEF OFFERS
 The Eastern European Satellites appear to be accepting
 Western flood relief offers primarily for political reasons,
 with economic considerations of secondary importance (see map,
 p.15),   In their propaganda, East Germany and Hungary are uti-
 lizing their acceptance as evidence of their "sincere" desire
 to reduce international tensions.  Furthermore, the Communists
 probably feel they can portray acceptance as a manifestation of
 their interest in the welfare of the people.
 In the past, the Satellites have consistently refused vari-
 ous offers of Western aid, and the initial reaction to the 31
 July approach was unfavorable.   Satellite reversal of this po-
 sition was probably prompted by Moscow, which considered a favor-
 able response more in line with current Orbit tactics.  East
 Germany, where destruction of crops and damage to industrial
 property was severe, had characterized the "sinister" American
 offer as a cover for rehabilitating the "badly torn network of
 agents,"  On 5 August, however, it reversed its attitude and
 accepted "President Eisenhower's  generous offer," portraying
 its action as an expression of its "policy of furthering ...
 international understanding,,"
 Hungary, with damage to grain production estimated at less
 than 2 percent, had initially refused a Dutch offer of 50,000
 guilders ($14,000), and had indicated it would not accept
 American assistance.  On 7 August, it accepted the Dutch offer
 and on 10 August acqu.4esced to American aid.   In both cases, it
 specified that it would rather receive currency than goods.
 After almost three weeks of silence, Czechoslovakia an-
 nounced on 16 August its willingness to accept the proffered
 aid.   Seventy percent of the crops in Czechoslovakia's flooded
 regions were saved, but damage to industrial establishments is
 estimated at $14,000,000.   Rumania, which suffered little flood
 damage, declined the American offer politely.   Aid was not of-
 fered to Albania, Bulgaria, and Poland.
 In addition to the Western aid, East Germany, Czecho-
 slovakia, and Hungary have received flood relief donations from
 the USSR amounting, at the official rate of exchange, to ap-
 proximately $90,000, $27,000, and $25,000 respectively,  Hungary
 has also received some $12,500 from Rumania, $9,000 from Bulgaria,
 and an unknown amount from Poland.  All these grants have been
 well publicized in the Orbit press.
 The flood damage was probably not sufficient to cause seri-
 ous setbacks to the Orbit's economic program.   In most cases
 there was enough warning to permit the governments to mobilize
 military and paramilitary forces and vehicles for harvesting crops
 and building dikes and levees in threatened areas.

 COMMUNIST CHINA'S LEADERS UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION
 Under Communist China's new draft constitution, it is
 probable that Mao Tse-tung and Chu Teh will receive the posts
 of Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Republic while Liu Shao-
 chi will head the powerful Standing Committee.of the People's
 Congress and Chou En-lai the cabinet-like State Council.
 The draft constitution,  to be approved by the All-China
 People's Congress in September,  appears to take into account
 the problems connected with the transfer of authority after the
 death of Mao Tse-tung.   The semiretirement of Mao from active
 control of the government to a position of prestige with limited
 constitutional authority      would permit the development of a
 successor in the position of real governmental power.
 Power in Communist China, as in other Communist states,
 will continue to depend primarily on standing-in the party
 rather than position-in the government.   The forthcoming assign-
 ment of leaders to certain government jobs, under the party-
 designed constitution, should serve as an indicator of party
 standing.
 The draft constitution follows its Soviet model closely in
 many respects,  but differs from it in creating the offices of
 Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Republic,  for which elections
 will be held by the All-China People's Congress.  Terms for the
 offices will run for four years (see chart, p.  20).   The Vice
 Chairman assists the Chairman, assumes the Chairman's duties
 should he become incapacitated "for reasons of health," and
 succeeds to that office if it "falls vacant."
 Judging from current propaganda in China, the post of
 Chairman of the Republic is apparently intended for Mao Tse-tung,
 whose ill health may compel him to reduce his role in the govern-
 ment.   It will be a position of great prestige but will derive
 its real authority from the personal leadership and party stand-
 ing of its holder.   The major constitutional restriction on the
 powers of the Chairman of the Republic is the provision that his
 principal functions are to be carried out "in accordance with
 the decisions of the People's Congress or its Standing
 Committee."
 The Standing Committee will probably be in effective control
 of the congress'  functions as "highest organ of state power,"
 since the congress,  consisting of about 1,200 delegates,  is

 likely to follow the Soviet example and do little more than
 approve measures submitted to its annual meetings.  The present
 counterpart of the Standing Committee,  the Central People's
 Government Council, is under Mao's chairmanship.   Chairmanship
 of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress will probably
 therefore become the dominant position in the government,  and
 its holder will probably be a man second only to Mao in
 importance.
 The most likely candidate for Chairman of the Standing
 Committee seems to be Liu Shao-chi.  Liu, currently rated
 second in the Chinese Communist hierarchy, would thus be in a
 position to inherit Mao's power.  Another possibility is the
 present premier and foreign minister--Chou En-lai.
 The best choice for Vice Chairman of the Republic would
 appear to be a popular party veteran.   Since the Chairman of
 the Republic is commander in chief of the armed forces and
 chairman of the National Defense Council, he should also have a
 sound military background.   Chu Teh, who is 68 years old and
 commander in chief of the armed forces, may be selected for this
 position in spite of his age.   Choice of Chu as Vice Chairman
 would strengthen the supposition that the posts of Chairman and
 Vice Chairman of the Republic will be largely honorary.
 Another locus of power under the new constitution will be
 the State Council, a cabinet-like body with functions similar
 to the present Government Administration Council.  The State
 Council will include the premier, vice premier, ministers, and
 commission chairmen who are to be formally appointed by the
 Chairman of the Republic, subject to the decision of the People's
 Congress or its Standing Committee.   The Chairman of the Republic,
 however, nominates only the premier, who in turn, nominates the
 other State Council members.
 The State Council is under the supervision of the Standing
 Committee,but,through its control of day-to-day government
 operations, will occupy a strategic place in the administrative
 hierarchy.   If Chou En-lai continues as premier, his increased
 stature in the party as a result of his recent diplomatic
 successes would lend authority to that office.

 COMMUNIST CHINA'S GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT MAY BE $33 BILLION*
 Peiping has recently released data which form the basis
 for a new estimate of $33 billion for China's gross national
 product (GNP) in 1952.   This finding exceeds a recent tentative
 American estimate of $27 billion,  Until recent years it was
 widely accepted that China's GNP was less than $15 billion.
 For the first time an absolute rather than a percentage
 figure for the output of a major segment of the economy has
 appeared in the Chinese Communist press.   This key figure in
 the new analysis was an estimate of the output of the handi-
 craft industries in 1952 and was reported in the Tientsin Ta
 Kung Pao on 7 May 1954 as 100 trillion yuan, or $5 billion at
 the 1952 exchange rate.   The article just received further
 stated that this figure was 13 percent of the total industrial
 and agricultural output, and 31 percent of the industrial out-
 put alone.
 With these data it is possible to derive an absolute figure-
 of $38 billion for the gross agricultural and industrial output,
 From this total an estimate can be made of the available consum-
 ers'  goods  by subtracting the proportion of output used as in-
 dustrial raw materials, investment goods, and export.   As private
 investment in China is negligible, a GNP estimate can then be
 derived by adding estimated consumers' services and state ex-
 penditures from the budget for investment, military, and ad-
 ministration purposes.   The resulting GNP estimate for 1952 is
 $33 billion.
 While this new tentative estimate is 22 percent higher than
 the one previously accepted, per capita GNP has risen only
 slightly because the recently accepted estimate of China's
 population increased the number of Chinese by 16 percent.
 China's estimated gross national product of $33 billion is
 about one fourth the Soviet and one eleventh the American GNP.
 China's per capita GNP of roughly $57 is about equal to that of
 India but only about one quarter that of Japan.   It is estimated
 that China by 1957 will have attained a GNP that is about 20
 percent over the 1952 figure.   Agricultural output can at most
 increase ten percent in the period, but industrial output may
 double.

 and Reports.
