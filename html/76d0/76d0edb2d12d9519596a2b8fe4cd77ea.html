 Malenkov?s 8 August speech outlines policies of new regime
 Soviet premier Georgi Malenkov utilized the meeting of
 the Supreme Soviet on 8 August to make the most important and
 realistic statement of current Soviet policy since Stalin?s
 death, particularly with regard to internal affairs.   In Am-
 bassador Bohlen?s opinion, the proceedings at the Supreme
 Soviet and the attitude of the other Soviet leaders indicated
 that Malenkov, an extremely able orator, is unquestionably the
 dominant figure in present Soviet leadership.  Malenkov partic-
 ularly stressed the need for raising the living standard of the
 Russian people.  He described the material welfare of the popu-
 lation as "the main task" of the current Five-Year Plan, and
 announced that production of consumer goods would be increased
 "at the expense of other sectors" of the economy.
 In the field. of agriculture, Malibnkov announced important
 concessions to the Soviet peasantry, apparently in order to com-
 bat their traditional indifference to the expansion of agricul-
 tural production.  With regard to the international situation,
 Malenkov appeared to be arguing that a, detente in the cold war
 was feasible but only if the present power position of the USSR
 in Europe and Asia was not challenged.   He devoted particular
 attention to the menace of revived German militarism in an
 evident attempt to convince the French that a bilateral agree-
 ment with Moscow might provide a security alternative to EDC.

 Approved For Release 2008/05/22 : CIA-RDP80RO1443R000100320010-6
 Mentioning Beria's arrest only in passing, he pointedly warned
 that the new Soviet policies do not spring from weakness and
 supported this with an implication of Moscow's possession of
 the hydrogen bomb.
 USSR likely to make new disarmament proposal
 Soviet press comment following the USSR's thermonuclear
 explosion suggests that a new Soviet disarmament proposal may
 be presented in the forthcoming UN General Assembly.  The So-
 viet government's announcement of its tests on 20 August included
 a statement that it had "more than once" proposed disarmament
 action under the supervision of the United Nations, and later
 comment emphasized selected quotations from the foreign press
 to the effect that Soviet possession of the H-bomb will give
 "new impetus" for outlawing such weapons.
 A new Soviet proposal on disarmament may be similar to
 the Russian proposal in the UN in November 1951 for a "world
 conference" of all states, which followed Stalin's announce-
 ment in October 1951 that the USSR had carried out an A-bomb
 test.
 Malenkov sets tempo for more positive policy toward Japan
 Malenkov's statement on 8 August, attaching special
 significance to the normalization of relations with Japan and
 welcoming any steps the Japanese might take to throw off Ameri-
 can "domination," appeared to mark a turn toward a more posi-
 tive Soviet policy regarding Japan.  Neither the Soviet Union

 Approved For Release 2008/05/22 : CIA-RDP80RO1443R000100320010-6
 nor Communist China, however, has yet offered Japan any political,
 or economic concession which the Japanese might logically accept
 as a quid pro quo for negotiations with the bloc.  Present indi-
 cations suggest therefore that Soviet policy will be designed
 to encourage the Japanese to take the initiative toward an over-
 all peace settlement.
 Soviet attitude toward new Iranian government
 Moscow's attitude toward the new pro-Western regime in
 Iran has apparently been guarded, but is still conciliatory. So-
 viet ambassador Lavrentiev protested to the new Iranian govern-
 ment about anti-Soviet demonstrations on 19 August.  Zahedi told
 Ambassador Henderson on 1 September that the "Soviet embassy"
 had recently inquired about the policy of the new Iranian govern-
 ment toward the USSR.
 Unconfirmed press reports, however, claim that "well-
 informed Iranian sources" state that the Soviet ambassador also
 offered Zahedi aid to ease Iran's financial crisis.  These re-
 ports allege that following several meetings between the Soviet
 trade representative and the Iranian minister of national econ-
 omy, a trade agreement was signed on 3 September.
 While it is doubtful that the Kremlin will give Iran
 any extensive aid without a quid pro quo, the USSR may have
 made attractive trade offers during the recent Soviet-Iranian
 talks in Tehran.  Such offers would probably be similar to

 Approved For Release 2008/05/22 : CIA-RDP80RO1443R000100320010-6
 those included in the 10 June agreement which reportedly doubled
 the value of goods to be exchanged over that of previous years.
 Moscow may have offered Iran a large trade-credit agreement,
 such as the one recently concluded with Argentina.   Iran has
 commodities for which the USSR may make cash payment --'an
 arrangement Tehran would welcome.
 Big-four exchanges on Germany
 The 15 August Soviet note on Germany again suggests that
 the Kremlin continues to bolster the East German regime and
 has no interest in meeting Western terms for unifying Germany.
 The timing of the note, which resubmits a Russian peace treaty.,
 draft of March 1952, points instead to an attempt to upset
 Chancellor Adenauer's chance for re-election in September.
 However, the Soviet failure to propose more favorable terms
 appears to have helped Adenauer's campaign.  The USSR's orig-
 inal 4 August answer to the West's invitation to talks on
 Germany apparently was designed to record Soviet advocacy of
 a conference covering a broad agenda for. easing international
 tension and including Communist China.
 The USSR again serves notice that it intends to main-
 tain the East German regime by refusing to compromise on the
 crucial. issue of holding free all-German elections prior to
 peace treaty discussions and under international supervision.
 It proposes to call a peace conference with the participation
 Approved For Release 2008/05/22 : CIA-RDP80RO1443R000100320010-6
 Approved For Release 2008/05/22 : CIA-RDP80R01443R000100320010-6
 of representatives of East and West Germany.   It calls for a
 provisional government which would eventually hold elections
 free of outside interference.
 The note's emphasis on the provisional government's
 role in establishing East-West German contacts indicates So-,
 viet anticipation of a divided Germany for an indefinite time.
 By proposing elimination of reparations payments and limitation
 of occupation costs, the USSR is taking two steps to liberalize
 its occupation, probably attempting to decrease German resent-
 ment and opposition.
 On 2 September the Western powers replied to the Soviet
 notes of 4 and 15 August.  The West rejected both Soviet sug-
 gestions for a general conference with Communist China par-
 ticipating and for an East-West German meeting. Instead, the
 Western powers proposed that the four foreign ministers meet
 in Lugano on 15 October to. consider only the German and Austrian
 questions.   On the German side, first attention would be given
 to free elections and the status of an all-German government.
 Big-four exchanges on Austria
 The Soviet government's 28 August reply to the Western
 invitation to a meeting of the Austrian treaty deputies again
 underlines the Soviet desire to discuss the Austrian question
 only in connection with the German problem.  Moscow repeated
 its charge of 25 May that the state treaty discussions are
 not within the competence of the deputy foreign ministers,

 Approved For Release 2008/05/22 : CIA-RDP80RO1443R000100320010-6
 but added that a solution of the German problem could contrib-
 ute to an Austrian settlement.
 The Kremlin's renewed demand for a complete and uncon-
 ditional withdrawal of the abbreviated draft treaty is probably
 designed to generate British, French, and Austrian pressure on
 the United States for a firm advance commitment of the earlier
 long draft treaty, in order to head off any Western move toward
 its revision.
 Soviet maneuvers in the UN related to Korean Political Conference
 Soviet moves during the UN assembly session on Korea
 appear aimed primarily at exploiting the divergence of views
 between the US and other leading UN members regarding the
 character and scope of the political conference.  The two
 resolutions introduced by Vyshinsky were mainly devices for
 undermining support for the US position.
 Vyshinsky's affirmative vote on 27 August on the reso-
 lution inviting the USSR to participate in the conference, after
 his failure in a move to delete the proviso "provided the other
 side desires it," reflected Moscow's insistence on a round-table
 conference with broad membership.  Vyshinsky consistently  op-
 posed the US concept of a conference limited to the "two sides."
 There have been no indications that the Communists will abandon
 this position, endorsed by both Communist China and North Korea.
 Approved For Release 2008/05/22 : CIA-RDP80RO1443R000100320010-6
 Approved For Release 2008/05/22 : CIA-RDP80RO1443R000100320010-6
 This attitude toward the UN recommendations probably
 foreshadows counterproposals designed to circumvent the UN
 endorsement of the US plan for the conference and to reopen
 the question during this Fall?s General Assembly session. It
 is possible that the Communists will suggest the participation
 in the political conference of some or all of the "neutral"
 and "neighboring" states mentioned by the two Soviet resolu-
 tions rejected by the UN assembly.
 The Soviet representatives will probably attempt to
 link the question of the admission of Communist China to the
 UN, which Vyshinsky has promised to raise in the eighth General
 Assembly, with an effort to revive the controversy between
 the US and other UN members on Korean issues.
 Chou En last?s views on political conference issues
 expressed to the Indian and Swedish ambassadors on 17 August
 were identical with Vyshinsky's proposal in the UN on 18 August,
 suggesting that Moscow and Peiping have reached prior agree-
 ment on all important conference issues.
 Zhukov and Vasilevsky absent from official Soviet functions
 Soviet press reports have failed to mention either Mar-
 shal Zhukov or Vasilevsky in connection with several recent
 functions attended by the other members of the Soviet hierarchy.
 Both apparently were absent from the Supreme Soviet session,
 the air show, and recent Moscow receptions in honor of the East
 German delegation.  The continued absence of these two first

 deputy ministers of defense may reflect further maneuvering
 among the top leadership.
 Post-Stalin Soviet economic trends continue
 Through curtailment of long-range or uneconomic con-
 struction projects and streamlining of other economic opera-
 tions and administrative machinery, the USSR apparently is
 attempting simultaneously to continue its over-all military
 expenditures at approximately the same level as in 1952, to
 maintain a high level of heavy industrial output, and to
 fulfill its promises for increased output of consumer goods.
 The Soviet government has in the past two months given
 special emphasis to its announced policy of increasing the
 availability to the population, of consumer goods.  There are
 several indications. that the Kremlin is beginning to carry
 out these promisese

 Approved For Release 2008/05/22 : CIA-RDP80R01443R000100320010-6
 The Eastern European governments are continuing to ini-
 tiate measures designed to improve living conditions. and allay
 unrest.  All the Satellites except Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia
 have issued decrees reducing the agricultural debts of both the
 private and collective farmers.  Hungary and Rumania have also
 announced intentions to curtail their heavy industrialization
 plans in order to increase investments in agricultural and
 consumer good industries.  Two major construction projects in
 Rumania and one in Hungary have been suspended, apparently
 for this purpose.
 The only confirmed instance of serious resistance in
 Eastern Europe since the East German riots appeared in Czecho-
 slovakia in early August.                     On 11 August the Czech minister
 of national supply ordered extensive special measures to
 suppress local uprisings which had broken out against local
 party and government officials in eastern Slovakia.
 Yugoslav-Satellite border negotiations
 Variations in the. approach and attitudes of the neigh-
 boring Satellites in their frontier negotiations with Yugo-
 slavia suggest the absence of a coordinated policy on the
 details of the discussions.  Yugoslav-Hungarian talks have
 progressed "in a not unpleasant atmosphere," according to
 a Yugoslav official, and the negotiators concluded an initial
 agreement on 28 August.  Rumania and Albania, on the other

 hand, are delaying and obstructing the course of negotiations.
 Although Bulgaria, agreed to negotiate early in July, the talks
 have not yet begun.   Bulgarian-Greek frontier negotiations
 are progressing with no major obstacles.
 East Germany
 The equilibrium of the East German Communist position
 has been seriously threatened by the widespread response of
 the populace to the Western food program.   In addition, the
 unrest and popular discontent germinated during the 17 June
 riots have continued as a latently explosive force.  As a
 result, the primary concern of the government has been to
 keep order and to restore some measure of stability.
 Internal party reorganizations and purges designed to
 strengthen the hard core of the Socialist Unity Party have
 continued.    The government has reacted to the food program
 by imposing intermittent police controls, organizing an
 energetic propaganda campaign against food distribution, and
 threatening reprisals against individuals receiving packages.
 The East German regime has not been able, however, to impose
 the controls required to defeat the food program because it
 fears a popular uprising and is reluctant to present the West
 with a picture of oppression.,.

 Approved For Release 2008/05/22 : CIA-RDP80RO1443R000100320010-6
 Attempts are being made to improve the consumer goods
 situation in the hope of placating the sullen populace.  East
 German propaganda media have continually announced generous
 food shipments from the Soviet Union, and the granting of
 ruble and free currency credits to East Germany on 23 August
 will probably bring about an eventual improvement in the
 consumer goods supply.  At the moment, however, there is
 little evidence that the food supply has been substantially
 increased,.and it is- possible that continued maladministration
 and inefficiency in distribution is negating much of the effort
 to improve the consumer goods situation.
 The Soviet effort to enhance the prestige of the East
 German regime and strengthenthe,position of Ulbricht indicates
 that no change in rule is contemplated that would improve the
 prospects for talks on unity.  Nevertheless, the East Germans
 have. continued to call on their Western brethren to engage in
 unity discussions and have made several gestures, e. g., liberal-
 ization  of their policies on interzonal travel and on the transit
 through the Soviet zone of West Berlin manufactured goods, moves
 which appear to be intended to improve the climate for negotia-
 tions between the two Germanys. At the same time, however, the
 strengthening of the East German regime in spite of the well-
 known West German refusal to deal with this government indicates
 the lack of sincerity behind the East German position on unity.

 Soviet-East German negotiations
 The 22 August statements concluding the Soviet-East
 German negotiations in Moscow appear designed immediately to
 influence the West German elections and in the longer run to
 lessen discontent and build-up the prestige of the regime in
 East Germany.
 The promised release of some German prisoners being
 held for "war crimes" is the only concession affecting more
 than East Germany.  The promise of economic assistance, the
 end-'of reparations, and other economic concessions indicate
 recognition of the economic sources of East German discon-
 tent highlighted by the 17 June riots.  A serious intention
 to carry out an assistance program would lessen these eco-
 nomic causes but not the political reasons for dissatisfaction.
 Ambassador Bohlen believes that the announcements proved
 beyond reasonable doubt that the USSR has decided to throw
 its full support behind the East German regime for the imme-
 diate future.                    He thinks the unrest since 17 June has forced
 a Soviet decision not to negotiate on Germany out of,fear of
 leading from weakness.

 Sighting of B-47 type plane at Moscow
 There have been two separate sightings recently of "large"
 Soviet aircraft at Ramenskoye airfield near Moscow.  On 6 July.
 Canadian and British air attache personnel sighted and photo-

 those of surrounding TU-4's.  The attaches believed them to be
 type-31 heavy bombers.  On 30 July a US air attache sighted
 and photographed a "large" airplane with a US B-47 type tail,
 in addition to the previously sighted "large" aircraft.
 Despite the credibility of the observers and the photo-
 graphs,,it'                         is impossible to do more than speculate on the
 identity of either of the types of "large" aircraft.  The

 heightened tails similar to the tail of the US B-50; unmodified
 TU-4's, erroneously identified as type-31's
 port aircraft having high vertical tails (although no windows
 were observed).
 In order of likelihood, the aircraft with the US B-47
 type tail may  be?either a, turbo-prop powered type-31 in
 which the increased power necessitated installation of a much
 enlarged tail with fin  sweepback as a substitute for a longer
 fuselage; or a new aircraft, possibly utilizing a fuselage
 similar to that of the type-31 but having jet engines and
 probably swept-back wings.
 Comment on the Moscow air show
 The display of a considerable number of new fighter air-
 craft in the recent Moscow air. show, coupled with the fact that
 no new bomber was displayed, may be of possible. significance
 with respect to estimates on the status of Soviet medium and
 heavy bomber development.  A review of air show history reveals
 that, while the Soviets have displayed many prototype aircraft
 which were never placed into production, those which have reached
 production have been publicly exhibited prior to or coincident
 with entry into operational use.  Thus, while it remains, likely
 that new prototype Soviet bombers,exist, the chances are good
 that new medium or heavy bombers were not available, at least
 in numbers commensurate with the rest of the 1953 show.

 The armistice and political conference
 President Rhee has taken no further steps to obstruct the
 armistice,    and it is believed that he will continue to cooperate
 at least until after 90 days of political discussions.  He is

 holding firm in his expressed determination to take unilateral
 action to unify Korea by force if the conference fails.
 At the UN, the United States had the support of only three
 nations outside of Latin America (Greece, Nationalist China,
 Pakistan) in defeating the resolution for India's participation
 in the political conference.  On the resolution inviting the USSR,
 the United States was successful in retaining the phrase "provid-
 ing the other side desires it" in a 55-2-2 vote.
 So far, the US, UK, Belgium, Philippines, South Korea,
 France, Canada, Thailand, Australia, Colombia and Turkey have
 indicated a desire to participate in the conference.  The US
 has notified Peiping, through the Swedish embassy, that the UN
 proposes San Francisco, Honolulu or Geneva as the site for a
 conference to be convened on 15 October.

 calling for a withdrawal of all foreign forces, with unification
 to be settled "by the Koreans themselves."  This repeats the
 standard Communist theme used at the time of the 1946-47 US-USSR
 J9int Commission meetings and suggests the Communists may again
 put forth their plan for an interim government composed of the
 joint North-South legislatures which they would subsequently
 hope to dominate.

 North Korean purges
 The recent purges in North Korea were directed at the
 "domestic" faction of Communist leaders, most of whom were
 influential in the prewar South Korean Communist movement, and
 who were prominent in the unsuccessful subversion program.
 Although charged with a plot to overthrow the North Korean
 regime, it is more likely that they were eliminated because of
 their "nationalistic" views on the armistice or on the question
 of unification.  The purges and a concurrent reshuffling of
 party posts has strengthened the Soviet faction's control at
 the expense of "domestic" elements, while the Chinese faction
 has remained generally in posts of secondary importance.

 The Chinese Communist campaign against Nationalist-held
 offshore islands has abated temporarily,. with no significant
 developments in the past month.  Chiang Kai-shek is still
 interested in obtaining further moral and material support from
 the United States as a deterrent to Communist attacks on the
 islands.  The Generalissimo is reported to be depressed by the
 failure of the Nationalist raid on Tungshan Island in mid-July.

 Possible attempt to improve foreign relations
 Certain lines in Peiping's recent propaganda suggest.that
 Communist China, in the hope of gaining China's seat in the UN
 and inducing a reduction in Western trade restrictions, may
 follow the Soviet lead in attempting to improve relations with
 certain non-Communist countries without altering its basic
 hostility to the non-Communist world.  Peiping may encourage
 the establishment of full diplomatic relations with seven
 countries which have recognized it but with which the Chinese
 Communists have not exchanged envoys, and it may make new over-
 tures for recognition by certain other governments.  However, the
 new British charge in Peiping has been there since 23 August
 without being received by Premier Chou En-lai or otherwise
 encouraged.
 Status of Mao Tse-tung
 In the two months since the Soviet announcement of Beria's
 fall, there has been a marked increase in Chinese Communist
 attention to the concept of "collective leadership" and a
 marked decline in Peiping's praise of Mao Tse-tung.  Although
 Mao's position as leader of the Chinese Communist Party and

 The French have deduced from these negative indications
 regarding Laos that the Tonkin delta area will be the main

 this possibility is heightened, moreover, by the marked

 from the necessity during the last campaign season of diverting
 mobile reserve elements to northwestern Tonkin and Laos.
 Status of negotiations for evacuation of Chinese Nationalists
 from Burma
 Negotiations for the evacuation of Chinese Nationalist
 troops from Burma still have not progressed beyond the stage
 of discussion.  Although the four-power committee in Bangkok

 Approved For Release 2008/05/22 : CIA-RDP80RO1443R000100320010-6
 has succeeded in drawing up a new evacuation plan, its
 proceedings continue to be marked by the stalling tactics of
 the Nationalist representative,
 The most recent of his maneuvers involved a
 proposal for deleting from the evacuation plan the names of
 places in Burma to be turned over to the Burmese army.  This
 development appears to contradict the Nationalist position that
 Li Mi alone is obstructing the evacuation effort, since it
 followed closely after the revelation that Li intended to
 retain his Mong Hsat headquarters even after the "evacuation."
 In addition, indications are accumulating that the Nationalists
 are still being supplied by both land and air.  These develop-
 ments suggest that Taipei at best is contemplating only a token
 withdrawal, despite                         statements by Nationalist
 officials to the contrary.
 The Burmese have all but given up hope that the Bangkok
 talks will result in positive achievement and are considering
 at least three courses of action.  They plan to raise the issue
 again in the UN
 The American embassy
 in Rangoon, however, recently reported that Burma's presenta-
 tion may not be as bitter as had been anticipated.  The Burmese
 are meanwhile proceeding with preparations for renewed large-
 scale operations against the Nationalists if the UN debate

 should prove fruitless.  Finally, if both the UN appeal and
 military action fail to obtain satisfactory results, there is
 evidence that the Burmese may feel compelled to seek Chinese
 Communist assistance in eliminating the Nationalists.
 Political developments in Indonesia
 The chief political development in Indonesia since the
 installation of the new Communist-influenced cabinet on 1
 August has been the presentation of the cabinet's policy
 statement to parliament.  Although individual members of the
 cabinet have indulged in highly nationalistic remarks, the
 government's policy statement presented by Premier Ali Sastroa-
 midjojo on 25 August, was relatively moderate and differed
 little from statements of former governments.   This approach
 indicates that the leftists will try to avoid antagonizing
 conservative elements in the cabinet in order to preserve the.
 government and thus gain time for infiltration into the govern-
 ment, the army, and the police.
 So far anti-Communist elements in the army and parliament
 appear to have adopted a policy of watchful waiting.
 Presidential campaign may endanger Philippine security

 acting on behalf of the Liberal Party, and Huk leader Luis

 Taruc.  The American embassy believes that if these negotiations
 result in a Huk "surrender," Philippine security will be endan-
 gered.                      The Huks would be provided an opportunity to further
 their current infiltration tactics.  The chief objective of
 the negotiations is to achieve a political coup before the
 'November elections.
 An important recent development in the presendential
 campaign was Carlos Romulo's withdrawal, of his candidacy on
 .21 August and the formation of 'a coalition of his Democratic
 Party with the Nacionalistas in support of Magsaysay.  Of
 almost equal importance is the precariousness of Quirino's
 health and the possibility that Vice President Lopez, now
 running for the senate on the coalition ticket, may succeed to
 the presidency before November.   Should he become president,
 Lopez might be in a position to reach a compromise with the
 Liberals, but it is possible that Liberal stalwarts may resort
 to extreme methods to prevent him from controlling the execu-
 tive apparatus.

 The situation in Kashmir
 Despite official denials from New Delhi of involvement,
 the replacement on 9 August of Sheikh Abdullah as prime minis-
 ter of Indian-held Kashmir by pro-Indian Ghulam Mohammad Bakshi
 represents a successful Indian attempt to regain control of a
 political situation that had been rapidly getting out of hand
 because of Abdullah's search for personal power through advo-
 cacy of independence of semiautonomy for the state.
 Pakistani reaction to the coup was unusually intense, and
 Prime Minister Mohammad All requested an.imm.ediate meeting
 with Prime Minister Nehru.   Talks between the two took place
 in New Delhi from 16 to 20 August, but none of the reported
 decisions differs materially from those which the two coun-
 tries accepted as early as 1948.   The minor changes announced
 on 19 and 20 August, one of which called for the appointment
 of a plebiscite administrator by the end of April 1954, were
 presumably made to permit Mohammad All to return to Karachi
 with a  statement that progress had been achieved.
 The Karachi press on 27 August, countering Indian press
 implications that the two prime ministers had agreed on ap-
 pointing a new plebiscite administrator from a small neutral
 nation, announced that Pakistan would insist on the retention
 of Admiral Nimitz, who was accepted by both countries in 1950.

 By 4 September, however, both India and Pakistan had learned
 that Admiral Nimitz had tendered his resignation, thereby cre-
 ating a difficult situation for the Pakistani government and
 further complicating Indo-Pakistani relations.
 The American embassy in Karachi believes that Mohammad
 Ali?s prestige has been considerably lowered by the outcome of
 the New Delhi talks.   The Indian position seems to have been
 strengthened.   There is very little Pakistan can do to change
 the status quo.
 Indian participation in Korean conference
 During the week of 17 August a resolution proposing that
 India be seated at the postarmistice Korean 'political conference
 was introduced in the Political Committee at the special ses-
 sion of the seventh UN General Assembly.   The ensuing debate
 found the United States, which opposed Indian participation,
 in opposition with its major European allies, primarily because
 of differing concepts as to the most effective size of the con-
 ference and whether it should be a "cross-" or "round-" table
 meeting.   The resolution was passed in Committee I on 27 August
 by a vote of 27 for, 21 against, and 11 abstentions.   Since it
 was obvious that in a succeeding General Assembly plenary ses-
 sion India could not gain the required two-thirds majority,
 India withdrew'its candidacy on 28 August.

 Leftist-inspired unrest in Ceylon
 During the week of 12 August, serious leftist-inspired
 rioting developed in Ceylon in connection with a protest strike
 against the government's reduction of food subsidies.   It was
 the most successful demonstration to date of cooperation among
 the three Ceylonese leftist parties.   The government was pre-
 pared for the strike and quickly controlled the situation.  On
 17 August parliament provided the government with more power
 than seemed necessary to cope with the situation, passing a bill
 enabling the government to enforce emergency regulations in
 anticipation of public disorders.
 Oppsoition parties indicated that they intended to continue
 embarrassing the government on the rice subsidy issue by intro-
 ducing a no-confidence motion in parliament on 1 September.
 The government's majority defeated this motion easily by a vote
 of 59 to 26.

 The situation in Iran
 The strong upsurge of popular and military reactions to
 Prime Minister Mossadeq's efforts toward limiting, if not
 removing, the monarchy in Iran enabled the shah's supporters
 on 19 August to take over the government and to place in power
 a regime which is moderately nationalist, pro-shah and firmly
 pro-US.   On 23 August Zahedi announced the appointment of a
 slightly right-of-center cabinet, composed in part of old
 guard conservatives.
 Prime Minister Zahedi moved immediately to consolidate
 his control of the country by instituting a, rigorous campaign
 against the Communists, starting an extensive purge of Mossadeq's
 supporters from the army and the government, and by issuing a
 warning to restive tribesmen that the army would tolerate no
 attempt to achieve  greater autonomy.
 Apparently neither the prime minister nor the shah has
 made a serious attempt to solve the status of parliament, al-
 most two-thirds of whose members had resigned before the coup.
 Without plenary powers or a, functioning Majlis, Zahedi cannot
 settle the oil dispute or move ahead with a constructive legis-
 lative program.  The prime minister lacks organized political
 support, and there have already been indications of dis-
 sension among his varied adherents.

 Recognizing that Iran's most pressing problem is its
 empty treasury, both the shah and Zahedi have appealed to
 the United States for extensive financial aid.
 formed on 3 September of the amount of aid, Zahedi showed
 disappointment.   Serious Attention is also being given to the
 oil problem.  There is, however, no indication that the prime
 minister is either able or willing to move contrary to the
 strong nationalist sentiment which still prevails in Iran on
 this issue.
 On 3 September Iran negotiated a supplementary trade agree-
 ment with the USSR, presently Iran's largest customer.   Rumors
 arose in Tehran on 1 September that Soviet ambassador Lavrentiev
 had attempted to commit suicide, but Ambassador Henderson has
 been unable to ascertain the truth.
 American bases in Greece
 The Greek government on 14 August "accepted unreservedly"-
 the United States proposal for establishing military bases in
 Greece.
 Orbit interest in reopening relations with Greece
 Indications since early August that Albania and Bulgaria
 wish to resume normal relations with Greece follow Russia's
 decision in July to send an ambassador to Athens and may be
 part of a new orbit effort to weaken the Yugoslav-Greek-
 Turkish defense organizations.

 Greek-Yugoslav relations
 Greek reaction to recent Yugoslav press complaints over
 new Greek efforts to resettle the Slav-speaking minority in
 northern Greece has been firm but essentially friendly.  The
 protests seem unlikely to jeopardize the newly initiated Greek-
 Yugoslav-Turkish defense cooperation.
 Greek economic situation
 The tight Greek economic situation has been further
 strained by the serious earthquakes which struck the Ionian
 Islands in late July and early August.  Greek pressure for more
 American aid or for the transfer of funds now allotted to
 military aid to the economic field may be forthcoming.
 Change of government in Morocco
 The forcible French removal of the sultan of Morocco on
 20 August, contrary to information from official French sources,
 was the culmination of pressures from French officials and
 vested interests unwilling to accept any self-government for
 Moroccans.  Paris seems to have surrendered to a defiant bureau-
 cracy in Morocco rather than to a threat of civil war between
 rival Moroccan factions.
 Ostensible American approval of this change has dimin-
 ished the popularity of the United States among Moroccan natives.
 Having looked to the United States for encouragement, Moroccan
 nationalists are now embittered and are more likely to accept
 Communist assistance.   Strict French security measures have

 thus far maintained order, but have not wiped out the will to
 resist.   If serious disorders occur, American bases and per-
 sonnel will probably be attacked.
 French suspicions regarding American intentions in Morocco
 have probably increased, because of expressions of American
 concern about the effects of dethroning the sultan, as well as
 the amendment to the current Foreign Operations Administration
 appropriation designed to cut off aid to France unless American
 treaty rights in Morocco are strictly observed.  The French are
 likely to hamper American military and commercial activities
 in the area.  They will also increase pressure for the renun-
 ciation of US extraterritorial rights under which Americans in
 Morocco are exempt from local jurisdiction.   Since 1912 France
 has repeatedly sought to annul these rights, but the World Court
 ruled in August 1952 that they were valid.
 Despite French declarations that their policy envisages
 eventual Moroccan independence, the administrative reforms
 now under consideration in Paris represent virtually no change
 from direct French control.  The only new step is the proposed
 creation of seven provincial advisory bodies, a quasi-decentral-
 ization of administration.  The position of French colonists
 and vested interests, however, is for the time being considerably
 more secure, because they can exert effective pressure at all
 governmental levels.

 Unrest in central Africa
 Nyasaland riots demonstrate the basic African hostility
 to the federation plan for British central Africa, scheduled
 to take effect on 6 September.
 South African politics
 Prime Minister Malan of South Africa has been temporarily
 stymied in the furtherance of his racial segregation program
 by his inability to secure the necessary two-thirds majority
 to amend the constitution.

 Anglo-Egyptian talks
 British and Egyptian representatives engaged in a series
 of informal talks in Cairo between 28 July and 3 September in
 an effort to establish a sufficient area of agreement for re-
 sumption of formal negotiations on the Suez base.
 little progress was made on
 the questions of the duration of the agreement and the sched-
 ule for the withdrawal of  British troops.

 The failure
 of the Pakistan and Indian prime ministers to support the
 Egyptian position on the Suez case during their visits to
 Cairo in June is also considered to have contributed to the
 regime's desire to reopen negotiations with the British.
 As  a  result of the informal talks, general agreement
 was reached on a formula for future availability of the Suez
 .base in the event of an attack against any Arab state. Egypt
 refuse, however, to accept the British suggestion that an.
 attack on  Turkey also be considered cause for a return to
 the base.
 Colonel Nasr has indicated that the political situation
 in Egypt makes it impossible for the military regime to
 accept more than a five-year agreement, with technicians to
 remian for three years only.
 the Egyptians maintain that the duration date must start from
 the date of signing the agreement.

 Despite narrowing of disagreement on many important issues,
 there is a real danger of a break over the "duration" question,
 No breakdown in the talks, however, is expected until after
 General Robertson, British military delegate, returns to Cairo
 about 14 September after holding consultations in London.
 Ratification of Anglo-Libyan treaty
 The Anglo-Libyan treaty, already previously approved both
 by the cabinet in Tripoli and the House of Deputies, en-
 countered unexpected difficulties on 31 August when the Senate
 indefinitely postponed further consideration of the agreement.
 This delay was made ostensibly to await British assurances
 than London's annual payment of 1,000,000 pounds for Libyan
 economic development as provided by the treaty would be re-
 garded as Libya's contribution to the international Libyan
 Development Agency, thus assuring Libya rather than Britain
 control over the use of the money.   There is a danger that,
 as a result, Prime Minister Muntasser might resign and the
 treaty die.
 Rumors of forthcoming change in Iraqi premiership
 Reports continue that Prime Minister Midfai will soon
 resign, and that his most likely successor is elder statesman
 Nuri Said,  for many years premier and now defense minister.
 Such a cabinet change would again bring into the public eye
 the pro-Western rightist group which has long dominated Iraqi
 political affairs. Nuri Said has played a prominent role in

 the Midfai cabinet since it was formed last January following
 an election which installed a pro-Nuri parliament.   Rumors
 last.spring that Midfai would yield the premiership to Nuri
 or a Nuri-approved candidate increased after King Faisal II
 acceded to the throne on 2 May.
 Jordanian-Israeli tension in Jerusalem area
 The American embassy in Amman reported on 4, 12, and 17
 August that the Arab Legion expected an early attack by Israeli
 military forces against Mt. Scopus in the Jerusalem region.
 While American observers believed the Jordanian fears were
 exaggerated, the reports considerably increased tension in
 the area.

 Guatemala
 Communist influence in the Guatemalan government has
 continued to rise as opposition anti-Communist groups remain
 ineffective.  Concurrently, the pressure against the three
 major private US corporations in Guatemala is being increased.
 On 12 August the government initiated expropriation pro-
 ceedings against about 70 percent of the United Fruit Company
 Atlantic coast lands.   A strike by the workers of the US-
 owned International Railways of Central America is imminent.
 The government representatives currently in control of the
 Guatemalan Electric Company, a subsidiary of the Electric
 Bond and Share Company of New York, have declared that their
 review of that firm's records indicates that the wage demands
 of its employees are justified.
 Panama
 The elaborate send-off given Panama's delegation to the
 talks on Canal Zone treaty revision beginning in Washington
 on 10 September illustrates the great popular attention
 focused on this issue.  While President Remon's 28 to 30
 September visit to Washington will reinforce his domestic
 prestige at least temporarily, a failure to obtain some con-
 cessions from the US could seriously weaken his regime in
 favor of the ultranationalist opposition.

 Cuba
 Since 6 August, when a "public. order law" providing
 penalties for defamation of the government went into effect
 in Cuba, President Batista has instituted the most severe
 repressive moves against opposition elements sincehe
 came to power in March 1952.  Enforcement  of the law has
 been directed pointedly against Communists, although per-
 sons of all political affiliations have been arrested and
 the Communist Party as such has still not been outlawed.
 The law is-to be effective until 4 November unless Batista
 13uspendS it earlier by further decree, as he has promised.
 Its enforcement has undoubtedly increased popular resent-
 ment against the regime.   In view of their present state
 of disorganization, however,, revolutionary groups mayAe
 unable to exploit this resentment, at least for.some months
 to come.
 Chile
 Chile's financial crisis has continued to worsen as un-
 sold copper stocks continue to accumulate.  The 21 August
 announcement that Chile had resolved to amplify its political
 and commercial relations with the rest of the world, that is,

 influence the copper talks in Washington.

 low price of tin, the sale of which must pay for three
 fourths of Bolivia's imports,. has accentuated the financial
 crisis and even made questionable the country's ability to
 go on importing sufficient food.  The government's political
 stability is increasingly threatened both by growing Commu-
 nist influence, now concentrated on the new agrarian reform
 program, and by possible landowner defections from the
 party to support a rightist coup.

 The stability of the Laniel government
 The Laniel government was endangered during August
 when the spontaneous strikes in various government services
 over prospective economy'decrees developed into a wide-
 spread drive for satisfaction of labor's long-standing
 grievances.
 The actual decrees were less severe than labor had ex-
 pected, and Laniel succeeded in gaining a back-to-work call
 from the non-Communist union representatives by.promising a,
 review of minimum wages.   The Communist-led General Labor
 Confederation unexpectedly gave in and dropped a general
 strike appeal.
 The government was then able to forestall a special
 session of the National Assembly, where debate would have
 threatened Laniel's continued tenure.  A new demand for a
 special session received almost no non-Communist backing.
 At the end of August the government announced 10 percent
 reductions in retail prices of meat and an intensified cam-
 paign against tax evaders.  Early in September the government
 announced a four-step program calling for further food price
 reductions through elimination of food taxes, additional
 budgetary cuts, industrial production expansion through re-
 laxation of credit controls, and a reconsideration of wage

 scales.  Working class discontent remains high, however, and
 a new and more violent labor outburst is likely unless con-
 crete concessions are offered by 12 October, when the National
 Assembly reconvenes.
 The formation of the Pella provisional government in Italy
 Giuseppe Pella, a conservative Christian Democrat noted
 for his controversial "defense of the lira" policy while
 finance and later budget and treasury minister, was apparently
 willing to make greater concessions to the now dominant left
 wing of his party than was either De Gasperi or Piccioni.
 Pella's cabinet excludes those rightist Christian Democrats
 most obnoxious to the two most important of the other center
 parties, the Liberals and Social Democrats; it includes three
 prominent "left-wing" or reformist Christian Democrats in the
 key Ministries of Defense, Interior and Education.  Left-wing
 control of the latter post is particularly significant, since
 it represents a setback for Catholic Action forces whose
 prominence in earlier cabinets had irritated the anti-
 clericals.
 Pella's program as presented to the Italian parliament
 appeals to a wider range of political groups.   It praised
 the Atlantic Pact, demanded a conservative approach to the
 budget, and a reform of the bureaucracy, but also advocated
