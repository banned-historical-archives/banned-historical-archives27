 ISRAEL:  Rabin's Resignation
 Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's resignation, following
 press disclosures that he had maintained illegal bank accounts
 in the US,  seems certain to hurt the ruling Labor Alignment's
 prospects at the polls next month.  Because of its reformist
 image,  the new moderate Democratic Movement for Change Led by
 YigaZ Yadin seems Likely to gain the most from Labor's Latest
 misfortune.
 Ironically, the Alignment, which has been rocked by
 corruption scandals and torn by dissension for months, was
 just beginning to rebound from its earlier poor standing in
 public opinion polls. The most recent surveys showed the Labor
 Party and its left-wing ally, Mapam, moving ahead of both the
 hard-line Likud opposition bloc and Yadin's new group.
 At this point, it is unclear who will succeed Rabin
 as head of the present caretaker government or whether in fact
 he can legally step down.  Israeli law in this situation is not
 clear, but Minister of Justice Zadok and other key Labor cabi-
 net members and party leaders may decide the matter.
 More important is the question of who will replace
 Rabin as head of the Labor Party list for the election.  Under
 Israeli law, the party apparently must decide by next Tuesday
 at the latest.
 The top spot would seem to fall by default to De-
 fense Minister Peres, who Rabin defeated by a very narrow
 margin in the election held at the Labor Party convention in
 late February. Although the party may fall into line quickly
 behind Peres to avoid disruptive wrangling that would further
 damage Labor's prospects, there is a possibility that some of
 Peres long-standing enemies could make some effort to promote
 a compromise candidate.  Such a move,  especially if successful,
 would almost certainly seriously split Labor.
 If Peres does succeed Rabin, on the other hand,
 Mapam mig t decide to reverse its decision to pursue its elec-
 toral alliance with Labor. Mapam had threatened earlier to
 run its own list if Peres were chosen over Rabin at the Labor
 Party convention. Party leaders have called an urgent meeting
 for tomorrow to consider what actions Mapam must now take.

 e
 p Presi-
 dent Mobutu ddeaZ with the invasion by Katangans,  and the Chi-
 nese have decided to provide materiel assistance to Zaire.  In
 Shaba,  the military situation has changed very little in the
 past several days.
 The Katangans apparently remain in the area of K
 -
 ay
 b em e; Zairian military units nearby report scattered fighting.
 The invaders probably are still preparing for an attack  o Kol-
 The Zairian command in Shaba has organized the de-
 ense o   Kolwezi around nearly 1,200 troops augmented by ar-
 mored cars and a few combat aircraft. Most Zairian troops are
 near Kolwezi, but some have been positioned at outlying points
 along roads leading into the town and at major junctions to the
 east.  General Singha, who was appointed commander of the troops
 in Kolwezi last week, has moved the forward command post out
 of Kolwezi to the west.
 Although he has not been significantly tested in com-
 ba             General Singha appears to be performing more effectively
 than his predecessor. According to the US embassy in Kinshasa,
 Singha apparently has now established communications links with
 his outlying commands which may solve one of the problems that
 have hampered Zairian commanders over the past month.  He also
 reportedly is visiting his troops daily and is having stragglers
 and deserters rounded up and interned outside Kolwezi.  :Both
 measures are likely to improve morale.
 The situation in Kolwezi itself is tense
 according
 ,
 to the US consul in Lubumbashi, who visited the town early this
 week.  The French ordered their citizens to evacuate and then
 reversed themselves, probably because their departure would
 have triggered a mass evacuation. Mining operations are be-
 coming increasingly difficult because the Zairian army has
 commandeered many of the mining company's trucks and is using
 the company's fuel supplies.

 Most of the non-Zairian employees seem prepared to
 remain, although arrangements are being made to evacuate de-
 pendents if necessary.   Mining company officials are skeptical
 that they can continue production after Kolwezi falls, which
 they view as probable.
 The French are gradually increasing their role in the
 con   ict; advisers dispatched to Zaire last weekend are to ar-
 rive in Shaba today and will be attached to General Singha's
 staff.  Some French advisers are to begin training Zairian per-
 sonnel in the use of armored cars and mortars in the next few
 days.
 China is backing up its support of the Mobutu govern-
 ment wit                             materiel assistance. Yesterday Kinshasa announced
 that 30 tons of Chinese equipment--probably arms, ammunition,
 other military goods and medical supplies--would soon arrive
 by air. More equipment is to arrive on a ship already sailing
 for Zaire.
 Peking continues to accuse the USSR of engineering
 the invasion of Shaba with Cuban help. Chinese criticism reached
 a high point on Wednesday, when Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien at
 a banquet for the visiting President of Mauritania accused Mos- 25X1
 cow of initiating a new round of political and military aggres-
 sion in Africa. Soviet and East European diplomats walked out
 of the affair.
 LEBANON: Situation Report
 Fighting yesterday in southern Lebanon was
 reported to be zn ense, as PaZestian and Zeftist forces con-
 tinued their counterattack against the Christians.   The Pales-
 tinians captured the town of Khiyam, which had fallen to the
 Christians in December, and continued to press the Christians
 in Marj U un.
 Christian setbacks promted leaders of the Christian
 Front yesterday to issue a collective appeal for leaders of the
 Arab countries to intervene in the fighting.   The statement
 hinted that if the Arab states failed to act, the Christians
 would seek other aid, possibly from Israel, to avert further
 losses.

 Approved For Release 2008/02/14: CIA-RDP79T00975AO30000010014-2
 generated a great deal of anger and apprehension--particularly
 among Q        's detractors in the military and in the middle
 class.
 //Emotion over reports of the executions is
 running -especially high among certain elements in Benghazi,  the
 center of the 7 naica     ion  where opposition to the regime
 is strongest.
 Tripoli radio announced yesterday that five civilians,
 at least one of whom was Egyptian, were publicly executed in
 Benghazi yesterday following their conviction and sentencing by
 the "Peoples Court" for sabotage and burning a church. These
 executions may have been intended to defuse tension in the area.
 Egyptians are almost as unpopular in Cyrenaica as Qadhafi's re-
 gime; moreover, the "Peoples Court" is made up of popularly
 elected, local citizens who presumably have significant sway
 over public opinion.
 /Qadhafi has had a reputation for leniency to-
 ward his opponents; until now, there have been no executions
 and very little officially sanctioned violence under his rule.
 There has been growing concern, however, that Qadhafi's latest
 steps to legitimize his one-man rule and reduce the power of
 his colleagues on the recently abolished Revolutionary Command
 Council would lead to greater repression.//

 //The officers were part of a conspiracy led by
 Umar Mu aysh , one of Qadhafi's oldest friends. Muhayshi escaped
 after the abortive coup first to Tunisia and then to Egypt and
 has been collaborating with the Egyptians in a propaganda cam-
 paign against Qadhafi ever since. Qadhafi has been badly stung
 by many of Muhayshi's allegations and frustrated by his inabil-
 ity to silence him. In addition, the executions may serve as a
 warning to Muhayshi, who recently resumed radio broadcasts de-
 nouncing Qadhafi, that his relatives and followers in Libya
 could be in jeopardy if such broadcasts continue.//
 //It is too early to judge whether Qadhafi's re-
 ported resort to violence will better serve him or his oppo-
 nents. Having narrowly escaped several assassination attempts
 over the past year, the Libyan leader probably believes the
 need to intimidate his opponents at home and in Egypt outweighs
 the adverse popular reaction to unaccustomed violence. Most
 Libyan military officers, already badly shaken by Qadhafi's
 moves, are likely to be more concerned--at least initially--
 about their own survival than about taking action against the
 regime.//
 I//Qadhafi may be in no immediate danger, but his
 image as a relatively benign leader dedicated to Libya's in-
 terests before his own is rapidly dissipating. His turn toward
 the USSR, his disregard for local religious leaders, and his
 resort to tribal politics have offended.even some of his
 staunchest supporters and may have begun to undermine his pop-
 ularity among Libya's largely rural population.//

 be escorted from Gibraltar to the Cape by a South African na-
 val replenishment ship.  The voyage should take about three
 weeks.//
 //A second Israeli-built Reshef reportedly is due
 to be launched this summer. South Africa is building at least
 three of the six under license in Durban, but they probably
 will not be ready for launching until next year.//
 //The six boats are part of South Africa's effort
 to modernize and improve its badly outdated navy. The program
 includes two destroyer escorts and two submarines still on or-
 der from France. As these new ships are made operational, many
 of the country's older, British-built ships will be phased out.
 EAST GERMANY: Air Traffic Regulations
 A new East German regulation governing aircraft fly-
 ing over the country's territory could be designed to apply to
 Allied military flights to West Berlin,  but the East Germans
 appear unlikely to attempt to enforce the regulation at this
 time.
 The East German Foreign Ministry recently sent the
 text of the new regulation, which became effective in February,
 to a number of Western embassies in East Berlin.  The covering
 note asked the embassies to inform their governments of provi-
 sions regulating official and civilian aircraft with "militar-
 ily important freight" flying over the "sovereign territory"
 of East Germany.
 Users of East German airspace must now request 10
 working days in advance a permit to fly over the country, ex-
 cept when the flight is authorized by "an international treaty."
 This vague reference, however, may be intended to avoid raising
 the issue of Allied use of the three air corridors to West Ber-
 lin. Alternatively,  this wording may refer to agreements be-
 tween East Germany and its allies.

 they have not interfered with Allied air traffic since the

 Communists. The Christian Democrats have repeatedly rebuffed
 Berlinguer, but they have cushioned the blow with public ex-
 pressions of appreciation for the Communists'  "responsible"
 attitude toward the government. Berlinguer has always stopped
 short of forcing the issue.

 Now the Communist leader is taking a more insistent
 tone. His tougher line doubtless results from a concern that
 cooperation with Andreotti is beginning to damage the party's
 reputation with the key components of its constituency--the
 working class and young voters.
 Writing in the party daily last weekend, Berlinguer
 asserted-that the Andreotti formula had served a positive func-
 tion but is now "worn out." While reiterating the party's desire
 to avoid bringing down the government, he argued that a compre-
 hensive accord among the parties that keep Andreotti in office
 is necessary to solve the country's problems.
 That theme had been spelled out in greater detail by
 the Communist directorate in a communique issued last week.  The
 leadership called for an agreement on a wide range of topics,
 including foreign and economic policies, the maintenance of
 public order, and university reform. Through such an accord,
 the Communists hope to be able to move from abstention in par-
 liament to participation in a majority supporting the govern-
 ment.
 Such a step would be widely viewed as taking the Com-
 munists closer toward cabinet status. For just that reason, the
 Christian Democrats--whose election campaign last summer centered
 on a pledge to keep the Communists out of government--continue
 to resist the idea of including the Communists in a parliamen-
 tary majority.
 Given the pressures in each party against closer col-
 laboration, any compromise will have to be sufficiently ambig-
 uous to permit the Christian Democrats and Communists to inter-
 pret it publicly according to their respective political needs.
 The Christian Democrats must be able to claim that the Com-
 munists have not gotten a toe hold in the national government;
 the Communists must be able to argue that the party's continued
 cooperation with the government is, at the minimum, producing
 tangible rewards for Communist supporters.
 Despite the obvious difficulties,  such a compromise
 does seem within reach. The Christian Democrats--even as they
 reiterate their refusal to include the Communists in a parlia-
 mentary majority--are showing a greater willingness to broaden
