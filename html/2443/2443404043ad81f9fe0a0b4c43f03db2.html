 KULDJA REVOLT
 From the interior of Sinkiang comes news of many drastic changes of
 a military and political nature which are reported to have taken glace
 since April 1951.
 First, the Chinese Communists, outer orders from the Soviet Union,
 sentenced many prominent Sinkiang Communists to capital punishment in con-
 nection with the Kuldja Revolt
 Second, the Fifth Army, reorganized from the former Kuldja People's
 Army, including a complement If two Cava;r; divisions and 11 cavalry regi-
 ments from the Liei-shn Ho region, was assigned .uty in Korea   The sub-
 sequent decimation of this army left the nationalistic Sinkiang Communists
 militarily at the mercy of the USSR
 Third, the ranking Nationalist field officers who surrendered to T'ao's
 Twenty-Second Army Group, were e-tri-r imprisoned or executed.
 soldiers were sent to Sha-war. to                                      Nationalist
 reorganized, retrained, or liquidated.
 Fourth, a detachment of Wan ? C^

 southern Sinki?^g,                                                                                                .rode routes which straddle
 the               Pakistan, and India, entered Tibet and set up air bases
 for      USSR,  Soviet Army unit,- subsequerrt:t penetrated northern Sinkiang
 through the Dzungarian doorways c,f Kuidja and Chuguchak and liquidated the
 Nationalist.   Chinese Communist officials did not escape through investi-
 gation by these troops                                                             The Soviet gasp on the tungsten, petroleum, and
 gold-producing regions of Pc-lo, Wv-su, Kuc,ra? and Altai was tightened.
 Fifth, at Srinagar, Kashm::,  ;ca, termer sec
 Sinkiang government, preclairnrd a M;s_-rc TurkestaneLeagaeewhich is anti-
 Soviet in orientation.
 These events point to an important -?eange in the Soviet Union s Cen-
 tral Asian policy,   At the end of World War !I. the Soviet Union,, faced
 with what it considered. an unfavorable statue quo, found it expedient to
 stir up toe nationalist Moslem repnb_,,:s c,f Central Asia and use their com-
 bined economic an(i military might to boater the precarious Soviet military
 positi,n?  To this end, agent,, were Bent t
 off
 Moslem nationalists in Irkutsk Oalast, an'i             a shkh tUzbe,  ad  ikzh,   nd the
 Turlvuen SSR?                                      Uni. Uzbek, Tto, and
 At the same time, the Soviet Union oraantzed the he so-called
 Eastern Turkestan Peoples Retuhii-- with centers at Kuldjn, Chuguchak, and
 A-k'o-su, indoctrinated the native t:pu;ace with ant;.-Kuomintang propa-
 ganda, and completed the f,,rmaticr?, :.f a tuifer zorie by thus exploiting Tar-
 kle nationalism.
 From 1943 to 1948, the USSR head     tni; line in Central Asia, smash-
 ing the China-India policy of tl:e Ut and Britain, with th?. hammer of the reli-
 gious and racial antiforeignism of Sir,i,;sng Moslems.   With the advent of Tito-
 ism in 1948, however, there was a marked shift in Soviet Far Eastern strategy.
 In the first place, the Chinese Communist conquest of North China wrecked the
 eastern defense barriers being built by the Soviet Union, and the three buffers
 of Kuldja, Chuguchak, and A-k'o-su were renlered useless.  In the second place,
 the newly won independence of Pakistan (15 August 1947) and the spread to Cen-
 tral Asia of Pan-Islamism presented the danger of serious defection among the
 republics in that area.  The Kremlin line was therefore altered:   the Chinese
 Communist advance into Northwest China was supported and many Central Asian
 Moslem nationalists were liquidated.

 Finally, the Eastern Turkestan People's Republic was set up in January 1945
 at Kuldja, and the Akhmedjan faction, which quickly deposed Ali Khan Ture, an-
 nounced its aim to liberate ail of Sinkiang by force of arms.  By 21 February
 1945, at the time of the Yalta Agreement, the Soviet Union had already established
 "by pr.,xy" a land base in Chinese Sinkiang and an all-Communist government which
 guarded the gangway to v-rthwest China. Akhmedjan Kasimi became head of the Mili-
 tary Government, Rakhimjan Klujaev, Minister of Internal Affairs, an,. Abulkhair
 Ture, Minister of Education.  The White Russian Balinov was mats field commander
 of the People's Army of the Eastern Turkestan People's Republic and secretly re-
 ceived aid from the USSR.
 In July 1945, when the Chinese Nationalist government was forced to sign the
 Yalta Agreement and when the Sino-Soviet Treaty was concluded, the Red Army marched
 on Sinkiang and attacked Urumchi from the Kuld,ja and Chuguchak corridors.  Red
 motorized units and the Red Air Force sped aid to the People's. Army of the Eastern
 Turkestan Republic.  The battle in the Wu-su--Ching-ho area cost the Sinkiang Se-
 cond Army of the Chinese Rationalist government the valuable Wu-su oil-fields;
 the 25th Division was routed and its commander, General Kuo 'h'i, was taken pris-
 oner.  The Turkestan People's Army then drove toward Urumchi along the Ma-nn-ssu Ho
 and won the trade center in August 1945.
 Stage 2, September 1945 - December 1947
 The period from September 1945 to August 1947 was important for the diploma-
 tic victory won by Foreign Minister Molotov over the US State Department.  In Sin-
 kiang, Chang Chih-chung was looked upon by the Soviets as a Chinese Kerenaky; conse-
 quently, they made preparations for a Sinkiang October Revolution in keeping with
 the pattern used in the Balkan  "changes in government."
 After General Marshall's visit to China, in 1946, `.he atmosphere was charged with
 talk of vast military aid to the Kuomintang government.  Chang Chih-chung, with paci-
 fism za his watchword, promptly asked Soviet Consul General Savilov to act as mediator
 between the Sinkiang insurgents and the Chinese Nationalist authorities   An agree-
 ment was reached and signed by both sides in January 1946.
 Chang showed alarming indifference to the reckless pacifism of George C. Marshall
 and Jaw..cs F. Dyrnes.  His behavior enabled the Soviets to restrain the onslaught
 of the Soviet. Army and the Turkestan People's Army, and to concentrate on the poli-
 tical arena, Akhmedjan Kasimi was directed to set up a coalition government together
 with Chang Chih-chung.  Communist sympathizers were planted in this government and
 awaited the word to carry out a "chang& in government."  the Northweet China pattern
 of democratic "freedou" and the Soviet pattern of democratic "organization," the
 Chinese legal system and the illegal Communists movements, clashed and rent law and
 order in Sinkiang to pieces.
 At this phase of the political struggle, Chang had a choice of three courses tofol-
 low in fencing with Soviet Consul General Savilov:
 1.  Mobilize Nationalist economic and military might (there were only 50,000
 Kuomintang troops in Sinkiang at that time); quickly stabilize internal political condi-
 tions in the province; and open a "cold war "
 2   Use such true nationalists and advocates of self-government as Masud Sabri,
 Isa, and EmIn in organizing the people and embarrassing the opposition.
 3.  Take advantage of international political conditions -- the Sino-Soviet
 Treaty and the desire for peace -- to bring the opposition to terms.
 Unfortunately, Chang decided upon the third course and was subsequently de-
 feated by Savilov at the same time that Secrrltary of State Byrnes was defeated by
 Foreign Minister Molotov,

 In the spring of 1947, the Chinese Nationalists severed relations with the
 Chinese Communists, an act which intensified the cold war '!tween the US and the
 Soviet Union,  Marshall's attitude became more intransigent, the Truman Docfriae
 and thr- Marshall plan 'fastened the production of arms, and a new opportunity
 arose -,or Sinkiang.  The Chinese Nationalist government sent Masud Sabri, advo-
 cate of self-government, to be chairman of Sinkiang Province (May 1947).  They
 were thus taking the second course outlined above.
 General Sung Hsi-lien, commander of the Sinkiang Guard General Headquarters,
 expanded hie force to 80,000 troops, many of whom were American-equipped. ?!e
 conferred with the Kazakhs and the Ulghurs, rallied the Chinese, Manchu, Mongol,
 Moslem, and Kazakh peoples around Masud Sabri, and op=ned a legal war on th : Com_
 monists of Sinkiang.  But Chang Chin-chung, still adamant in his demands for com-
 promise, refused to support the plane of Sung and Maeud.  Hopes for an anti-Soviet
 united front in Sinkiang were dashed
 It was not long before the Kremlin went over on the offensive.  The Soviet
 Union sent recruits from Pei-t'a Shan and unite  f the Mongolian
 the border areas of eastern Sinkiang (5 June 1947,                 Arran     n eredst

 However, the adamant support of a cold-war policy by both Masud and Sung and
 their work to unite the Uighurs and the Kazakhs with advocates of self-government
 was continued.  When the P'u-t'ao-kou Revolt collapsed, the prestige of Akhmed an
 went with it  for his military maneuver was bridled.  At this impasse, the Krem-i+n
 decided to ser.d Akhmedjan and more than ten funous Communists to Kuldja to ring
 and isolate the advocates of self-government led by Masud
 At the same time that this was talking place, the Chinese Nationalist govern-
 ment decided to discontinue its policy of directing the flames of the nationalism
 of minority peoples toward the cold-war powder keg.  In this, the second stage of
 the Kuldja Revolt, Sung Hsi-lien won the fret victory for the democratic forces
 of the free world.

 1951
 During this phase of the international struggle, one that began in 1948 and
 runs to the present (June 1951), although the Chinese Communists took the main-
 land, the USSR suffered a series of crucial setbacks and was forced again to change
 its policy toward nationalists in Eastern Europe, Greece, and Central Asia.
 In the spring of 1948, when Titoism began to evolve and when serious defections
 appeased among Communists in Southern Europe, the situation in the Balkans under-
 went a drastic transformation.  Then, too, on 15 August !947, Pakistan was declared
 an independent dominion.   As the slogans of Mohanmea.:Ali Jinnah stirred many former
 pro-Soviet Moslems in the Central Asian frontier regions, the USSR launched a
 purge of C^:aaunists in the area who showed inclinations toward independence and
 deviationie~.  The Eastern Turkestan People's Republic (1944 - 1948), therefore,
 was overthrown and quickly replaced by the Sinkiang People's League for the De-
 fense of Peace and Democracy Chere.4n after referred to as Sinkiang People's Lea-

 e Kuldjs insurgents,Akhmed,jan and Ishka, as well as others, had committed
 the he,tcr of "adventurism" in their futile attack on P'u-t'ao-kou and were li-
 gaidaied after the Soviet Communists took Kuldja.   The internationalist, Saffudin,
 arrirtn'- f.rcm the USSR to head the Sinkiang People's League, established diploma-
 tic it   with Peiping.   In November 1949, when the Wang Chen units of the Chinese
 CcmTunist Army entered Sinkiang and took over the Kuldja People's Army, the lead-
 cri of the :.^w Sinkiang People's League announced that Akhmedjan and his compa-
 triots, vhll~ on their way to Peiping earl; in September, had been ambushed and
 killed by brigands loyal to Outer Mongolia.  Saffudin lost no time in appealing
 dir.'rtly to Mao for aid.  At the Stalin-Mao conference in February 1950, there-
 fore,  th= Sinkiang People's League was placed under Chinese Communist direction
 and guarantees "self-government" status.
 The vans,n left after  .he r?irge of the Kuldja insurgents we.s promptly filled
 by troop: of the Soviet Army.  The Kremlin sent MVD details to mop up remnants
 of th:= -urki  Akhmedjan;action, despite the fact that they had been comrades in
 arms       3t.alir.istc caring the bitter anti -Gei_.an campaigns.  This is the great
 trogedv of the Sinkiang Communists.  It is the ultimate example of the aphorism,
 "Who:. the fox has been caught, the hounds are killed and boiled."
 Present conditions (end o: June 1951) find the former secretary-general of
 Sinkiang, lea, at Srinagar, Kashmir.   The Chinese Communists, continuing in their
 role or High Executioner, have arrested the famous Kuldja insurrectionist, Kani-
 patult, s giant both in physical strength and nationalistic fervor.  After  aving
 es:aped from former Governor Sheng Shih-ts'a1. he organized the Kuldja rebels
 and later was commander in chief of the Kuldja People's Army and concurrently re-
 gional tcipervi3or of that city during the period of martial law.  Later, he was
 p-cr6"d by the Communist Party cadres ai ng with Kulbahnbatlu, Moslem leader in
 southern Sinkiang, and several hundred others   Furthermore, about 3,000 followers
 of N_3tud Sabri and over 800 disciples of the Kazakh historian Niwad were either
 kill'I or cent to the Soviet Union for adm:nist.rative trials.

 Kuldja People Z Army Becomes Korean. Cannon Fodder
 In Sinkiang, during recent months,  he Kuldja People's Army has been reor-
 ganized and sent to the Korean front.   Formerly the Nationalist Revolutionary Army
 of the Eastern Tuu?keatan People's iepublic, it was renamed the People's Army of
 the Sinkiang People's League for the Defense of Peace and, after subsequent reor-
 ganization by the Chinese Communists, became the Fifth Army of the First Army Group
 in General P'eng Teh hum 's First Field Army.  It is made up of the 13th, 14th, and
 15th Div s!ers and has an over-all strength cf 14 regiments, most of which are ca-

 their way out only after a bitter struggle. It was a cavalry unit of the Kuldja
 People's Army, moreover, which struck the rear guard of the Chinese Nationalist
 45th Division in the Tien Shan.
 In Tanuary 1945, the Kuldja People's Army split into three attacking col-
 umns,  Abasufu, leading one column through the bitter marched on Kuldja from A-k'o-su; I.'Lhshihjan led a bitter cold

 from
 the Drungarian gateway into Chuguchak; and Kanipatulu, skirting the precipitous
 T'ien S'an passes in the west, lunged directly at Urumchi itself,  During these
 marches and the ensuing battles, the Sinkiang nationalists fought alone and un-
 supported.
 In August 1945, during the Ching-ho--Wu-su campaign, this insurgent army
 commanded by General Balinov, a White Russian, met the Chinese Nationalist Sin-
 kian.q Se.ori Army under Hsieh I-feng in a battle of maneuver on the Ma-na-ssu
 plain.   The column under Ltehshihjan was joined by a mechanized brigade of the
 Soviet Army which had secretly entered Sinkiang at Chuguchak; together they
 pushed scuth'a-; on Wu-su under the protection of an air umbrella and cut the
 escare. roue cf the Sinkiang Second Army.  Commander Hsieh I-feng withdrew from
 Wu-s:,, his forces under heavy Red Air Force bombardment (incendiaries were used
 Jr. these bomber attacks) and the Tu-shah-tzu oil field, located 20 kilometers
 6,:'1thea_t of Wu-su, fell to the Red Army. The 45th Division under Kuo Ch'i was
 trrappp'v l''veen of Ching-ho and Wu-su by the composite force of Soviet armor ani
 the Kuldja People's Army.       The entire division was routed and
 K0O       was t.aren prisoner.   ills was a Soviet breach of faith, coming as tt did
 at t..- ,am- lime when the Silo-Soviet Treat; was signed and just after the Japa-
 nese surrenjer,                                                However, since the red Army operated under a protective Kuldja
 People's Army shield and since the Chinese Nationalist forces were decisively de-
 feated in the field, no Soviet personnel 'r military equipment were captured.
 Consequent;y, tht charge of military intervention could not be verified and
 15,003 aold:srs of the Republic of China died without their countrymen knowing
 of their sacrifi_e.

 KuldJaic'   t:,e forces dispatched to Sinkiang were made up cf many recr,:its from
 Central Aster nationality, groups, and. although Chinese Nationalist soldiers cap-
 tured many of t'tem, these Asiatics could not readily be distinguished from the
 real Fuidja ire'rrgents.  Nevertheless, Kuomintang commanders were able to tell
 the K,,13tsicis from regular Red Army troops by observing the firepower and battle
 tactics of tnn forces Opposing them.
 In 'he a?,t.'ymn of 1946, when this writer reached Kuldja, Chinese at the scene
 of the  uiege  (November 1944 to Tanuary 1945) reported that the insurgents fight-

 so weak that they could scarcely maintain a sustained attack for one day.  When
 night fell, however, martial law was declared; Soviet artillery could be heard
 rumbling through the city streets to take up firing positions within range of the
 park,   The barrages which usually followed set part of the park afire and Just
 before dawn, the guns could again be heard rolling out of the city.  This hap-
 pened every night during the last week of the siege until the park was finally
 taken.

 Also, tc::ording to information received by this reporter, when General Kuo
 Ch'i, commander of the 45th Division, was captured and brought Lefore the smartly
 drec_ed rebel ccmmander in chief, General Balinov, Kuo believed that the White
 RussiF  would be his prosecutor and judge.  He soon discovered, however, that it
 was rrs..ly Balinov's aide-de-camp, a man whose insolent behavior bespoke unlimited
 authority, who was his inquisitor.  General Balinov, unschooled and awkward in
 speech, feared saying the wrong thing and took his cues from this aide.  This
 pattern of impromptu coaching is not a new Communist device.
 The emal.l remnant of the Kuld,ja People's Army today is actually the same
 Cody that fought under the banner of nationalism and is made up of recruits from
 the adm,nsatrative districts of Kuldja, Chuguchak, and A-k'o-su.  The Soviet union,
 however, is depleting an excellent military reserve by sending the unit to fight
 with the Ch,,nese Communists in Korea.  According to considered opinion based on
 dispa--:;e, from the front, the troops of the Communist Fifth Army, a force which
 reacneu .i,e central front in Korea during the last week of April and which was
 throvr. tsck in the May "Spring Offensive," may include most of the Kuldjaists.  It
 is iron:-al that the Eastern Turkestan people's revolt should have finally peri-
 shed in a sea of US fire at the 38t1- F' ;-'.*cl.
