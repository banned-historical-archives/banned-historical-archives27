September 29, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE 23533 
freedom. At a time in history when we 
are in competition with totalitarianism 
for the minds of men, I think it is more 
important than ever that we encourage 
and applaud the establishment of edu-
cational institutions which encourage 
freedom of inquiry, thought, and dis-
covery. 
I think the objectives of Mackinac 
College are well reflected in the follow-
ing article which appeared in the Bay 
City Times on September 13, 1966: 
(By Margaret Allison) 
MACK/NAC IsLArin.?Mackinac College sees 
itself headed toward a unique educational 
breakthrough suited to the times. 
Its island campus is permeated with the 
spirit of high adventure as administrators 
and faculty talk about how they believe 
Mackinac will become a new force in edu-
cation. 
The new school opens Wednesday with 150 
charter freshmen and some 20 faculty mem-
bers, 
Dr. Morris Martin, dean of faculty, wants 
to keep this new liberal arts college relevant. 
"This is the factor for which today's col-
leges are looking; but too many are high 
and dry in the backwaters of history." 
"I am enthusiastic about learning, but I 
want to see knowledge used to redirect to-
day's world. Mackinac College will gear its 
courses to answering the problems of the 
world in which we live. 
David Blair, English department co-ordi-
nator, believes problems of today's world are 
compounded because much modern litera-
ture presents society as meaningless. "A 
generation which is hungry for relevance is 
being given a diet of husks," he contends. 
In teaching literature at Mackinac, Blair 
explains, "books will be evaluated in terms 
of human values, not just structure and 
form. 
He fully expects a new crop of young writ-
ers to emerge at Mackinac, who will point 
man to triumph, not to defeat." 
"What happens in a nation's classrooms 
will have as great a bearing on the future as 
what happens in its research laboratories," 
is the conviction of Martin Dounda, member 
of the English faculty and former speech-
writer for the Air Force Systems Command 
in Washington, D.C. 
"The thing that attracted me to Macki-
nac," he says, "is its avowed aim to educate 
students for responsible leadership in a tech-
nological age." 
Prof. E. Harold Tull, physics and introduc-
tory science teacher, believes "Anyone who 
wants to take responsibility for the world 
needs some knowledge of science." He has 
been conducting investigations of the iono-
sphere by means of radio transmitters sent 
aloft in sounding rockets from Fort Church-
ill in northern Canada. 
Dr. Franklin S. Chance, until recently in 
charge of research and production at Pfizer 
International Pharmaceutical Co., wants "to 
stress math as a way of thinking, rather than 
just a technique for problem-solving. This 
is not unique," he added. "Educators have 
felt this was the main reason for teaching. 
But at Mackinac I will try to bring it out 
from under cover so the students them-
selves realize its importance and achieve 
mental discipline." 
W. Timothy Gallwey, director of admis-
sions, from San Francisco, said "This is the 
first college to start from scratch with the 
Idea in mind to teach leadership in per-
spective to world opportunity." 
Gallwey, a 1960 graduate of Harvard Uni-
versity, explained before Mackinac was 
formed teams visited 125 universities and 
colleges in 20 states, interviewing countless 
students, teachers and parents. Confer-
No. 165-20 
ences also were held to explore the concerns 
and needs of youth for a type of education 
most suited to the demands of today's world:-
"This combination of visits, interviews and 
conferences revealed the widespread demand 
for the kind of education that Mackinac 
College will provide." he said. 
Gallwey said the 150-member charter stu-
dent body hal a wide range of academic 
ability. "Thirty per cent are in the top 10 
per cent of their class and could get into 
any college in the country; 55 per cent in 
upper one-half and could get into most 
colleges; the other 15 per cent have leader-
ship potential although their scores are 
lower. We'll offer a remedial program for 
them, and if they need more extra help we'll 
start a special program." 
More than 50 per cent of the students "re-
ceive some sort of financial assistance," 
Gallwey said "We made it possible for all 
13 
students accepted to meet college penses." 
'Si 
OUR, INVOLVEMENT IN VIETNAM 
(Mr. FARNUM asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute; to revise and extend his remarks 
and to include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. FARNUM. Mr. Speaker, during 
my frequent returns to my district in 
Michigan, it has become apparent, from 
discussions with constituents about our 
involvement in Vietnam, that the basic 
position of the United States is not clear-
ly understood. I have attended every 
possible briefing, I have studied every 
possible source of informed opinion, and 
I have talked to many persons who have 
seen first hand the situation in Viet-
nam?my objective being to understand 
why we are there, what we are doing, and 
how do we intend to ultimately find 
Peaceful solution to this conflict. I have 
brought together what I consider the 
essentials of our commitment in Vietnam 
in the form of a careful review of our 
basic position, our efforts for negotia-
tions, the political situation in light of 
the recent elections, the history of our 
economic aid, and an honest hard-facts 
statement on the military situation there. 
Yet my emphasis is on our desire for 
peace, for I believe that, more than any-
thing else, the people of my district and 
of the country as a whole, earnestly de-
sire world peace consistent with our na-
tional honor. I have tried to make this 
review as up to date as possible, realiz-
ing that the history of events in that 
troubled country has been that of con-
stant change, and that we ourselves have 
had to look again and again for wise al-
ternatives amidst a sea of changing cir-
cumstances. 
To summarize our position in the 
world on the question of peace, and how 
we propose to bring about a just peace, 
we have no finer projection of our ob-
jectives than that enunciated by Am-
bassador Arthur J. Goldberg, the U.S. 
representative to the United Nations, in 
the plenary session in general debate, 
on September 22, 1966. Rather than 
paraphrase or excerpt, I am asking 
unanimous consent that Ambassador 
Goldberg's address be printed in the 
RECORD following my review of our basic 
position, as his statement marks a signif-
icant initiative for peace which must be 
considered as an integral part of our 
basic U.S. policy in Vietnam. 
The United States is ready to order 
a cessation of all bombing of North Viet-
nam, when assured?privately or other-
wise?that this step will be answered 
promptly by a corresponding and appro-
priate de-escalation of aggression against 
the South. 
The United States is also ready to with-
draw its forces as others withdraw theirs 
so that peace can be restored in South 
Vietnam, and favors international ma-
chinery to insure effective supervision of 
the withdrawal. 
In stating these U.S. proposals to the 
United Nations General Assembly, Amer-
ican Ambassador Arthur Goldberg made 
clear September 22 that the United 
States desires a political, not a military, 
solution to the conflict in Vietnam. And 
he stressed that Vietcong representation 
in unconditional discussions or negotia-
tions of a political solution would be no 
insurmountable problem. 
In his address Ambassador Goldberg 
posed these questions: 
First. Would the government in Hanoi, 
In the interest of peace, and in response 
to a prior cessation by the United States 
of the bombing in North Vietnam, take 
corresponding and timely steps to reduce 
or bring to an end its military activities 
against South Vietnam? 
Second. Would North Vietnam be will-
ing to agree to a time schedule for super-
vised, phased withdrawal from South 
Vietnam of all external forces?those of 
North Vietnam as well as those of the 
United States and other countries aiding 
South Vietnam? 
All who are devoted to peace will wel-
come the U.S. initiatives which Mr. Gold-
berg outlined. As I speak to you today, 
we are waiting. We are waiting for a 
positive response from North Vietnam. 
As a result of my exhaustive and end-
less search for the course of reason in 
this most important national question, I 
can only conclude that we must support 
the patience and perseverance of our 
President. 
THE BASIC UNITED STATES POSITION 
A commitment against aggression 
The people of the United States are assist-
ing the people of South Viet-Nam for the 
same reason that we assisted the people of 
Greece and of South Korea?to support a 
free people in the face of Communist aggres-
sion. Our goal is to preserve the freedom of 
the South Vietnamese people to determine 
their future as they see fit. Tens of thou-
sands of armed, trained men including tons 
of armaments and North Vietnamese regular 
army units have been infiltrated into South 
Viet-Nam to impress Hanoi's will by force. 
Three American presidents?Dwight Eisen-
hower, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon John-
son?have pledged us to assist South Viet 
Nam. Many nations whose future may hinge 
on American support are anxiously watching 
our actions in South-Vietnam to determine 
the value of solemn American commitments. 
Their future conduct, as well as that of hos-
tile nations, will be influenced by the con-
clusions that are drawn from our support of 
South Viet-Nam. They are watching to see if 
America will persevere. Our example will 
sustain their desire for freedom, independ-
ence, and peace.

? Countering "wars of national liberation" 
Vo the Chinese Communists, South Viet-
Nam is the model of ea-celled wars Of na-
tional liberation. If South Viet-Nam ie con-
quered, we can expect future conflicts in 
Asian nations?Thailand has already been 
designated as the next target--in Africa and 
In Latin America. If South Viet-Nam suc-
cessfully resists; it will show the Communist 
pOwers that cheap victories are no longer 
possible and that the price of aggression is 
too costly. In time, the Communist powers 
Will hopefully choose to focus their energies 
on. their own vast internal problems. 
The goal of self-determination 
Our goals in South Viet-Nam are neither 
military bases, economic domination, nor 
political alliances. We support the right of 
the people of South Viet-Nam to elect their 
government freely and to decide for them-
eelves without outside force and coercion 
Such questions as reunification and neutral-
ity. The United States does not seek the 
destruction of North Viet-Nam pr its regime. 
President Johnson stated the American 
preference for using our resources for the 
ecOnornic reconstruction of Sontheast Asia. 
We are prepared to contribute our share to 
help these people help themselves. But 
despite our desire for peace we are determined 
to honor our commitments and to take all 
necessary measures until we and the 34 other 
nations aiding in the struggle successfully 
assist the people of South Viet-Narn in pre-
serving their right to determine their own 
destiny. We must not forget that despite 
our assistance it is the' South Vietnamese 
people who are still suffering the bulk of the 
oasualties in what remains their struggle for 
01,f-4etermination. 
Shove me the timetable for the withdrawal 
Of North Vietnamese forces and I will show 
you the timetable for American withdrawal, 
the President said on Labor Day. 
Unconditional discussions 
The Presidents actions and statements 
over the past year have clearly shown that we 
are fully prepared to transfer the struggle for 
South Viet-Nam's freedom from the battle-
field to the conference table. We continue 
to be ready to discuss a peaceful solution 
Without preconditions. When, either as a 
result of the gradual lessening of hostilities 
or of a formal settlement, the people of South 
Viet-Nam are relieved from outside coercion, 
our forces will be withdrawn. 
U.S. EFFORTS FOR NEGOTIATIONS 
Here are some examples of the continuing 
;search for a peaceful settlement by the V.S. 
_Government during 1965 and 1966: 
In February, April, June, July, and Decem-
ber, 1965, the Administration warmly en-
dorsed the repeated efforts by the United 
Kingdom to find such a solution through its 
individual efforts and through the collective 
efforts of the Commonwealth. 
In April, 1965, the Administration wel-
comed the appeal by seventeen non-aligned 
nations for a settlement through negotia-
tions Without preconditions. 
In May, 1965, the Administration sus-
pended our bombing of North Viet-Nam and 
sought some indication of a North Viet-
namese willingness to respond. 
In June, 1965, the Administration encour-
aged the attempt by the Canadian repre-
Sentative on the International Control Com-
mission for Viet-Nam to discuss the possibili-
ties of peace with representatives of the 
North Vietnamese Government in Hanoi, 
In July, 1965, the Administration sent a 
message to the Security Council expressing 
the hope that UN members would use their 
influence to bring all governments to the 
negotiating table to halt aggression and 
evolve a peaceful solution. 
'Prom December 24, 1965 to January 30, 
-1986, a period of 37 days, the President halted 
our bombing of military and communica-
tions targets in North Viet-Nam. He pur-
sued this course as part of a continuing 
effort to uncover any signs of North Vietna-
mese willingness to respond in some con-
,. 
structive way which might signify an interest 
in a peaceful solution. The purpose and 
sincerity of OUT action was conveyed on be-
half of the President across the globe by 
Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, Gover-
nor Averell Harriman, former Under Secre-
tary Thomas Mann, Governor G. Mennen 
Williams and Ambassador Arthur Goldberg. 
In addition, U.S. Ambassadors abroad brought 
the intent of our actions directly to the 
attention of the leaders of over 100 coun-
tries. Our message was conveyed both di-
rectly and indirectly to Hanoi. 
In June, 1966, the Administration followed 
Closely the peace-seeking mission of Cana-
dian Ambassador Chester Ronning to Hanoi. 
The Administration welcomes Prime Min-
ister Gandhi's proposal of July 7, 1966 for a 
peace conference on Viet-Nam. 
.In August, 1966, we expressed our great 
interest in the constructive suggestion of 
the Government of Thailand for the conven-
ing of an Asian Conference to deal with the 
problem of achieving peace in Viet-Nam. 
The Administration encouraged initiatives 
from world leaders such as President Rad-
hakrislinan of India, former President Nkru-
mah of Ghana, President Tito of Yugoslavia, 
President Nasser of the United Arab Repub-
lic, Foreign Minister Fanfani of Italy, and 
the Pope, among others, in seeking means of 
working toward a peaceful settlement. 
No meaningful response 
What has been the response from Hanoi? 
There has been no favorable response from 
Hanoi to any United states or other peace 
initiative. The North Vietnamese continue 
to insist that their agents, the Viet Cong, 
be accepted in advance of any discussions 
as "the sole genuine representative" of the 
South Vietnamese people. In other words, 
North Viet-Nam still insists that it be al-
lowed to contol the South before it will even 
discuss peace. 
THE FoLITICAL SITUATION 
General situation 
The present Government of South Viet-
Nam, composed of a Directorate as the ruling 
authority over a combined military-civilian 
cabinet, has served more than one year with-
out major alteration, However, the Govern-
ment was subjected to internal pressures 
following the dismissal of one of the Direc-
torate members, General Thi, in mid-March, 
1966. On June 6, as a result of these pres-
sures, the Directorate of ten generals was 
enlarged to include ten civilians. The Gov-
ernment also announced on June 1 its in-
tentions to establish an armed forces-civilian 
council to serve in an advisory capacity to 
the Government. This council met for the 
first time on July 5. 
Development of political institutions 
On April 12, 1966 the Government con-
vened a National Political Congress, mem-
bers of which were broadly representative 
of all non-communist Civilian political and 
religious groupings, to discuss steps to be 
taken for a return to constitutional govern-
ment. Prior to the Congress, the Govern-
ment had announced on January 15 its in-
tentions to establish a National Advisory 
Council to draft a constitution which would 
have been, submitted to a national ref-
erendurn in October and followed by elec-
tions in late 1967. However, acception the 
consensus of the Congress, Chief of State 
General Thietfissned a decree April 14 pro-
viding for elections for a constituent as-
sembly within 'three to five months. 
After additional consultations with re-
presentative groups, the Government on May 
5 convoked a 32-man Election Law Draft-
ing Committee, consisting again of Repres-
entatives of Viet-Nam's major non-commu-
September 29, 1966 
nist groups, to draw up draft laws pertain-
ing to the conduct of constituent assembly 
elections, the composition and functions of 
the constituent assembly, and the rejuvena-
tion of political activity. In early June the 
Committee forwarded its recommended 
draft laws to the Government. 
Constituent assembly elections 
Procedures 
On June 19, 1966, the Government of Viet-
Nam Issued two decree laws pertaining to the 
organization and functions of a Constituent 
Assembly and on election procedures for the 
creation of such an Assembly. The decree 
laws were the translation into law of a con-
sensus arrived at by the Vietnamese Gov-
ernment and the Election Law Drafting 
Committee. 
They provided for a Constituent Assembly 
to be convened with the sole purpose of 
drawing up a constitution. The Vietnamese 
Election Law allowed for one seat in the Con-
stituent Assembly for each 50,000 voters who 
were,registered for the May, 1965 provincial 
and municipal elections. Using this for-
mula, there were 108 seats open for elec-
tions, including four "seat which were re-
served for the ethnic Cambodian minority. 
Nine additional seats were reserved for the 
Montagnard (hill tribe) minority. 
Election would be by the direct method 
and by a system of proportional representa-
tion. In constituencies where there was one 
seat up for election, individual candidates 
would run, and the candidate with the most 
votes would win. In constituencies where 
more than one seat was at stake, lists of 
candidates would be submitted for election. 
A certain percentage of votes would have to 
be won in order for a list to win a seat for 
one, or more, of its members. Special pro-
visions were applied to the elections for the 
Montagnard seats. 
Voters in the elections had to be 1.8 years 
old as of December 31, 1965, be inscribed on 
an electoral list, have a valid voter registra-
tion card, and have not been deprived of his 
rights as a citizen. There were no political 
restrictions placed on voter eligibility. There 
were aproximately 5.600 polling places or 
one polling place for about every 1,000 regis-
tered voters. 
Candidates for elections could be male or 
female, had to be at least 25 years of age, 
and have .held Vietnamese citizenship for at 
least five years. Some 540 candidates com-
peted for the 108 directly elected assembly 
seats. Persons who directly or indirectly 
worked for the Communists, and pro-Com-
munist neutralists as well as neutralists 
whose actions were advantageous to the 
Communists were disqualified as candidates. 
Within fifteen days after the election, the 
elected deputies convened the first meeting 
of the National Constituent Assembly. Un-
der the Constituent Assembly Law the As-
sembly is allotted six months to draft a 
constitution. The draft constitution is then 
to be passed to the Chief of State for con-
sideration by the Directorate and promulga-
tion or return to the Constituent Assembly 
in revised form. The latter may override 
the Directorate's revisions by a two-thirds 
majority vote of all members. 
Results 
On September 11, 1966 approximately 4,-
200,000 voters, or 80 percent of the country's 
5;288,000 registered voters, went to the polls 
and elected the Constituent Assembly.. They 
braved a determined effort by the Viet Cong 
to prevent their voting, which by terror, as-
sassination, threats and violence directed 
against candidates and ordinary citizens re-
sulted in more than 500 casualties in the pe-
riod immediately preceding the election. 
The Viet Cong did prevent those under 
their control from reaching the polls, but 80 
percent of those eligible in the total popula-
tion, were registered,, and, as. noted, 80 per-

cent of these acTually voted. By comparison, 
the average voter, turnout in an American 
presidential election approximates 55 percent 
of eligible voters; in non-presidential elec-
tions, the average is closer to 39 percent. 
This was a vitally important step in Viet-
Nam's evolution toward representative and 
constitutional government, to be followed in 
1967 by the election of a president and na-
tional assembly. Successful candidates in-
cludes some of Viet-Nam's most prominent 
nationalists and political figures as well as 
a representative cross-section of religious, 
regional, ethnic minority and political fac-
tion leaders. Impartial observers confirmed 
that the election was free of irregularities, 
and that no public support for the Viet Cong 
was apparent. 
17.8. ECONOM/C AID 
Since its formation in 1954 the Republic 
of Viet-Nam has received substantial United 
States economic as,sistance including Food 
for Peace. During fiscal 1968, the economic 
aid imports totaled about $505 million and 
U.S. assistance for economic and social pro-
grams about $160 million. AD) plans to con-
tinue at about this same level in FY 1967. 
This economic assistance has made it pos-
sible to greatly expand programs that meet 
new and enlarged needs for refugee relief, 
health education and hospital construction. 
For example, more than one Million South 
Vietnamese refugees have fled to govern-
ment-controlled territory since January 1965, 
and about half have been resettled while the 
others are in temporary shelters. The United 
States has provided food, construction mate-
rials, blankets and other supplies in refugee 
relief. Major efforts are underway and ex-
panding in the field of health. We are as-
sisting the Vietnamese to enlarge teaching 
facilities in medical and dental education. 
A surgical or medical team is planned for 
each of the provinces by the end of FY 1967. 
An accelerated program of hospital renova-
tion, begun in FY 1965, will continue. 
Revolutionary development progranis 
Economic and social welfare programs sup-
ported by the United States play a crucial 
role in the over-all effort to improve the wel-
fare of the rural population and develop 
their loyalty to the Government of Viet-Nam. 
As was clearly, stated in the Honolulu Decla-
ration, these programs must be closely tied 
to military and police actions to protect the 
villagers and political programs to develop 
local governmental institutions. They cov-
er a broad range from the training of ad-
ministrators, teachers, doctors, agricultur-
alists and other technical personnel to the 
provision of classrooms and textbooks, wells, 
medicines, seeds and fertilizers. A number 
of activities are aimed specifically at in-
creasing the participation of rural Vietnam-
ese in local development projects which 
will give added incentives to village self-
defense. These self-help projects include 
road building, well-digging and school con-
struction, and combine local labor and ma-
terials with AID-financed imports of con-
struction commodities. These are the kinds 
of programs which I strongly support be-
cause they help people help themselves. 
To foster the revolutionary development 
program, members of the 'U.S. AID Mission 
are working with Vietnamese in every one of 
the country's 43 provinces. American ad-
visors are also assisting the Vietnamese in 
measures to deny economic resources to the 
Viet Cong, the "Open Arms" defector pro-
gram, and the vital task of training cadres 
to carry out the entire rural construction 
program. 
Since the success of the entire revolution-
ary development effort also depends upon 
the ability of the government to supply and 
transport personnel( and materials to the 
areas concerned, the U.S. is vigorously sup-
porting programs to improve transport and 
logistics, electrification, telecottununications, 
water and urban development. This serves 
both to identify the government with the 
people and to build the structure necessary 
for long-term development under peaceful 
conditions. 
The problem of inflation 
To cope with the inflationary threat, the 
U.S. and the Government of Viet-Nam have 
expanded financing of commercial imports 
and are developing other financial and fiscal 
measures; this process has been assisted by 
the work of an IMF mission which visited 
Viet-Nam in April and May 1966. On June 
18 the Government of Viet-Nam announced 
a major program to achieve economic stabi-
lization. At the same time wage and salary 
Increases for civil and military employees 
were granted as partial compensation for 
the erosion of purchasing power which had 
already occurred and which was anticipated 
after devaluation. After an initial post-
devaluation rise in prices, recent indicators 
show an encouraging leveling off. Viet-
namese and American officials are consulting 
on additional anti-inflationary measures, 
Including the improvement of port facilities 
to increase the flow of goods into Viet-
Nam. 
Free world shipping to North Vietnam 
The U.S. Government has been making 
a serious effort during the past year to 
eliminate Free World shipping to North 
Viet-Nam. This effort is underway through 
a series of high level diplomatic approaches 
to all the nations involved. In these ap-
proaches I point out the recent amendments 
to the Foreign Assistance Act which would 
end aid to countries whose ships remain in 
the North Viet-Nam trade. 
As a result we have met with considerable 
success. During the first seven months of 
1966 the average number of calls dropped to 
5 a month from 21 a month in 1965 and 34 
per month in 1964. In July 1966 only one 
Free World ship called in North Viet-Nam. 
Nearly all of the remaining shipping in-
volves small, coastal vessels under charter to 
Communist countries, most of which are 
registered in Hong Kong. Their cargoes are 
nonstrategic. We know of no shipments 
of arms on Free World vessels. Neverthe-
less, U.S. efforts to achieve a complete ces-
sation of this trade will continue. 
THE MILITARY SITUATION 
Chronological review 
In late 1961, in response to an appeal by 
President Diem and following a high-level 
U.S. study mission which cofirraed the seri-
ous effects of the Hanoi-directed campaign 
of terror and subversion, President Kennedy 
agreed to increase significantly the U.S. ad-
visory and logistic effort in South Viet-Nam. 
The Hanoi regime had begun in 1959 to in-
filtrate into South Viet-Nam former Viet 
Minh cadres who had regrouped in the 
North after the 1954 Geneva Agreements and 
and who had received special training in 
subversion and sabotage. 
By the end of 1962 there was evidence 
that the South Vietnamese had made some 
military progress against the Viet Cong. The 
Viet Cong, however, achieved a strength in-
crease and a noticeable increase in use of 
mortars and recoilless rifles. 
By the end of 1963 the Viet Cong appeared 
optimistic. They improved their military 
and political situation throughout the coun-
try from the Ap Bac battle in January 1983 
to increased terrorism following the over-
throw of the Diem regime. 
_ 
Into 1964, the Viet Cong objectives ap-
peared to be to destroy or prevent the estab-
lishment of New Life Hamlets, to consolidate 
"liberated" areas, to destroy South Viet-Nam 
forces and to counter efforts to obtain Hoa 
Hao and Cao Dai support. The Viet Cong 
carried out large-seals operations with rela-
tive impunity and achieved some success in 
their terrorism and propaganda efforts. The 
continuing infiltration of former Southern 
guerrillas was augmented by the infiltration 
of native Northerners and, late in the year, 
of regular troop units of the North Viet-
namese Army. 
During the first half of 1965 the Viet Cong 
continued to maintain initiative and momen-
tum. South Vietnamese lines of communi-
cation were completaly disrupted and the 
Central Highlands isolated for extended pe-
riods. In response to the request of Prime 
Minister Quat, 'U.S. ground combat units 
were sent to Viet-Nam, beginning in March, 
to augment the Republic of Viet-Nam's 
Armed Forces and thus correct the military 
imbalance created by the previous introduc-
tion of North Vietnamese Army units. 
They were later joined by units from Korea, 
Australia, the Philippines, and New Zealand. 
Combined South Vietnamese, United States 
and Free World forces blunted this "mon-
soon offensive." The number of Communist 
successes declined and there were some im-
portant victories over the Viet Cong. The 
tempo of Viet Cong activity declined in July 
but, in October the number of Viet Cong in-
cidents began to increase rapidly through the 
remainder of the year. In October there 
were over 3,300 incidents, in November it sur-
passed 3,600, and in December it reached 
over 4,000. Each of these was the highest 
encountered to date in the war. Despite over 
40,000 killed or captured and over, 9,000 de-
fections, the Viet Cong continued to main-
tain an offensive capability. Their year-end 
order of battle more than doubled that at 
the beginning of 1965. 
Combined Viet Cong and North Vietna-
mese military activity continues in 1966 to 
follow the familiar pattern of terrorism, 
harassment, sabotage and small-scale attacks 
with occasional large-scale operations against 
isolated Government positions. Recent 
South Vietnamese, United States and Free 
World forces operations and air strikes in 
critical areas are believed to have generally 
discouraged large-scale enemy activity and 
disrupted their plans. The Viet Cong and 
North Vietnamese Army will probably con-
tinue their pattern of terrorism, harassment 
and sabotage and possibly increase the num-
ber of small "hit-and-run" attacks. When-
ever they can achieve terms of their own 
choosing and when and where it suits their 
purpose, as against the Ashau Special Forces 
Camp in March, they are likely to attack in 
force. 
Enemy tactics 
Enemy tactics have not changed since the 
war began, despite the intensity of their at-
tacks and an increase in terrorism, propa-
ganda and sabotage. Their operations are 
still essentially "hit-and-run," emphasizing 
ambushing and destroying friendly reaction 
forces. 
Order of battle?Current strengths 
Government of South Viet-Nam: Despite 
combat and other losses, the South Vietna-
mese Armed Forces achieved a modest in-
crease. Their present strengths are: Approx-
mately 316,000; 280,000 Regional and Popular 
Forces. 
United States: Approximately 300,000. 
Third National Forces (major contribu-
tions) : 
Korea, 24,500 (soon to be increased to ap-
proximately 43,000). 
Australia, 4,700. 
New Zealand, Philippines and Thailand 
(see Section on Free World Assistance to 
South Viet-Nam). 
Viet Cong: Approximately 64,000 Main 
Force, 120,000 irregulars or guerrillas, 40,000 
political cadre, 19,000 support. 
North Vietnamese Army: Approximately 
47,000. There are now 19 North Vietnamese 
Army regiments in South Viet-Nam opposed 
to 9 in 1965. 
Infiltration 
Men and supplies continue to enter South 
Viet-Nam over established infiltration routes.

Capability of infiltrating approximately five 
thousand men per month with enough sup-
plies to sustain them until the Viet Cone sys-
tem can provide for them or until integrated 
into Viet Cong units. For 1958 to 1964 over 
40,000 were infiltrated from North to South 
Viet-Nam. During 1965, the estimate ex-
ceeded 26,000. It is estimated that the 1966 
Infiltration exceeded 35,000 by the end of 
July. 
Casualties 
Combat deaths since 1961, as of August 20, 
1956, (With U.S. military deaths until 1965 
sitatained by advisors only) were: Enemy 
troops, over 141,000; GVN Military, over 
39,000; US Military, 4,832. 
B-52 operations 
Since they started in June 1965, over 350 
B-52 etriices have been conducted against 
enemy bases in South Viet-Nam. These 
strikes have provided continual disruption 
and harassment in hitherto impregnable 
areas. Prisoners-of-war report that :the B-52 
operations have been a significant factor in 
lowering Viet Cong and North Vietnamese 
Army morale. 
Air strikes against North Vietnam 
Bombing of the North began in February 
1965, with a strike on the Dong Hoi Barracks 
arid gradually expanded to military targets 
along the infiltration route. A 'pause in the 
bombing occurred during the period May 13-
17, and a second pause of 37 days, began 
I>ecember 24. Our air strikes have these 
Objectives: to make it as difilcult and as 
wetly as possible for North Viet-Nam to con-
tinue effective direction and support of the 
Viet Cone to convince the North Vietnamese 
Goyernment that its Control, direction and 
support of the Communist insurgency in 
South Viet-Nam ia not worthwhile; to bolster 
nidrale in 8outli Viet-Nam. 
Our recent bombings of oil facilities in 
North Viet-Nam are in line with this general 
FREE WORtD ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH VIETNAM 
In the foreseeable future, the main bur-
den of outside support for the Government 
of South Viet-Nam has been and will con-
tinue to be borne by the United States. But 
substantial contributions of military and ci-
vilian assistance are provided by a large num-
ber of other countries. 
At the present time, thirty-four free world 
Countries are providing?and several more 
have agreed to provide?assistance to South 
Viet-Nam., Negotiations are underway be-
tween the Government of Viet-Nam and 
many of these nations for additional aid. 
The countries now contributing help to 
South Viet-Nam are: 
Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Can-
' ada, China, Denmark, Ecuador, Prance, Ger-
many, Greece, Guatemala, India, Iran, Ire-
land, Isra61, Italy, 
Japan, Korea, Laos, Luxembourg, Malaysia, 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philip-
pines, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, 
United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, 
Venezuela, 
-Significant contributions of armed forces 
? have been made in the past year. A Korean 
coinbat division has been in Viet-Nam since 
October, 1965 and a second division is now 
being deployed. The Australian Government 
has increased its military forces in Viet-Nam 
from 3,900 men to 4,500, and New Zealand 
has raised its artillery battery from, four to 
six howitzers. The Philippine congress has 
approved President Marcos' request for a 
2,000-man engineering force with support-
ing settirity personnel to be sent to Viet-
Nam; the advance party of this contingent 
recently arrived in Viet-Nam. 
The Thai Government has announced that 
It Will furnish a landing ship, patrol vessel 
and two transport aircraft with crews, there-
by adding to a previous small military con-
tribution. 
Free world personnel, other than American, 
in Viet-Nam under governmental arrange-
ments now number over 38,000, the large 
Majority of which are military personnel. 
However, some of these military personnel 
are engaged in civic action programs, such 
as revolutionary development and medical 
care, Among these are personnel from 
Korea, the Philippines, New Zealand and 
Australia. 
Significant economic contributions have 
been made by the United kingdom, Japan, 
West Germany, France. Australia. Canada, 
and New Zealand in the form of loans, 
grants, and commercial credits. For ex-
ample, Germany has made available in loans 
and grants about $27 million. Australia has 
provided technical and economic assistance 
totalling nearly $8 million. Assistance since 
1955 from France has totalled more than $111 
million, while Japan has provided about $55 
million chiefly in the form of reparations. 
Many nations are giving social and hu-
manitarian assistance to South Viet-Nam. 
More than ten nations are sending medical 
teams which provide for the medical needs 
of entire provinces. Others have contributed 
medicines and supplies for the half million 
refugees in South Viet-Nam. Educators and 
engineers from friendly nations are assisting 
Viet-Nam to rebuild. 
U.S. INITIATIVES FOR PEACE?THE FOURTEEN 
POINTS 
The following statements are on the public 
record about elements which the U.S. be-
lieves can go into peace in Southeast Asia: 
1. The Geneva Agreement of 1954 and 1962 
are an adequate basis for peace in Southeast 
Asia; 
2. We would welcome a conference on 
Southeast Asia or on any part thereof; 
3. We would welcome "negotiations with-
out preconditions" as the 17 nations put it; 
4. We would welcome unconditional dis-
cussions as President Johnson put it; 
5. A. cessation of hostilities could be the 
first- order of 'business at a conference or 
could be the subject of preliminary dis-
cilssions; 
6. Hanoi's four points could be discussed 
along with other points which others might 
wish to propose; 
7. 'We want no U.S. bases in Southeast 
Asia; 
8. We do not desire to retain U.S. troops in 
South Viet-Nam after peace is assured; 
9. We support free elections in South Viet-
Nam to give the South Vietnamese a govern-
ment of their own choice; 
10. The question of reunification of Viet-
Nam should be determined by the Vietnam-
ese through their own free decision; 
-11. The countries of Southeast Asia can 
be non-aligned or neutral if that be their 
option; 
12. We would much prefer to use our re-
sources for the economic reconstruction of 
Southeast Asia than in war. If there is 
peace, North Viet-Nam could participate in 
a regional effort to which we would be pre-
pared to contribute a substantial share. 
13. The President has said "The Viet Cong 
wOuld not have difficulty being represented 
and having their views represented if for a 
monlent Hanoi decided she wanted to cease 
aggression. I don't think that would be an 
insurmountable problem." 
14. We have said publicly and privately 
that we could stop the bombing of North 
Viet-Nam as a step toward peace although 
there has not been the slighest hint or sug-
gestion from the other side as to what they 
would do if the bombing stopped. 
HANOI'S REJECTION OF PEACE?THE POUR POINTS 
WS are not aware of any initiative which 
has been taken by Hanoi during the past 
five years to seek peace in Southeast Asia. 
In fact, Hanoi has denied that It has ever 
made any "Peace feelers." During 1965 Hanoi 
has ecnisiatentii, insiSted that its four points 
must be accepted as the sole basis for peace 
in Viet-Nam. 
Hanoi's four points are: 
1. Recognition of the basic national rights 
of the Vietnamese people?peace, independ-
ence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial in-
tegrity. According to the Geneva agree-
ments, the U.S. Government must withdraw 
from South Viet-Nara U.S. troops, military 
personnel, and weapons of all kinds, dis-
mantle all U.S. military bases there, and 
cancel its "military alliance" with South 
Viet-Nam. It must end its policy of inter-
vention and aggression in South Viet-Nam. 
According to the Geneva agreements, the 
U.S. Government must stop its acts of war 
against North Viet-Nam, completely cease 
all encroachments on the territory and sov-
ereignty of the DRV. 
2. Pending the peaceful reunification of 
Viet-Nam, while Viet-Nam is still temporarily 
divided into two zones, the military pro-
visions of the 1954 Geneva agreements on 
Viet-Nam must be strictly respected?the 
two zones must refrain from joining any 
military alliance with foreign countries, 
there must be no foreign military bases, or 
military personnel in their respective ter-
ritory. 
3. The internal affairs of South Viet-Nam 
must be settled by the South Vietnamese 
people themselves in accordance with the 
program of the National Liberation Front 
without foreign interference. 
(This point as interpreted by Hanoi would 
require that the Viet Cong be accepted as 
"the sole genuine representative" of the peo-
ple of South Viet-Nam, whether the South 
Vietnamese want it or not). 
4. The peaceful reunification of Viet-Nam 
is to be settled by the Vietnamese people in 
both zones, without any foreign interference. 
STATEMENT BY AMBASSADOR ARTHUR J. GOLD-
BERG, U.S. REPRESENTATIVE TO THE UNITED 
NAT/ONS, IN THE PLENARY SESSION IN GEN-
ERAL DEBATE, SEPTEMBER 22, 1968 
As the General Assembly convenes in this 
twenty-first year of the United Nations, we 
of the United States are aware, as indeed 
every delegation must be, of the great re-
sponsibilities which all of us Share who work 
in this world organization for peace. 
No one, I am sure, feels these responsibili-
ties more keenly than our Secretary General. 
U Thant. In the past five years he has filled 
with distinction and effectiveness what is 
perhaps the most difficult office in the world. 
We know how much selfless dedication and 
energy have been exacted from him on be-
half of the world community. We can well 
understand how the burdens of his office led 
him to his decision not to offer himself for 
a second term as Secretary General. 
The United Nations needs him. It needs 
him as a person. It needs him as a Secretary 
General who conceives his office in the full 
spirit of the Charter as an important organ 
of the United. Nations, endowed with the 
authority to act with initiative and effective-
ness. The members, in all their diversity 
and even discord, are united in their con-
fidence in him. His departure at this crucial 
time in world affairs, and in the life of the 
United Nations, would be a serious loss both 
to the Organization itself and to the cause of 
peace among nations. We reiterate our ear-
nest hope that he will heed the unanimous 
wishes of the membership and permit his 
tenure of office to be extended. His affirma-
tive decision on this question would give us 
all new courage to deal with the many great 
problems on our agenda. 
The peoples of the world, Mr. President, 
expect the United Nations to resolve these 
problems. With all their troubles and as-
pirations they Put great faith in this Orga-
nization. They look to us not for pious words 
but for solid results?agreements reached, 
wars ended or prevented, treaties teritten,

cooperative programs launched?results that 
will bring humanity a few steps?but giant 
steps?closer to the purposes of the Charter 
which are our common commitment. 
Realizing this, the United States has con-
sidered what it could say in this general 
debate which would improve the prospects for 
such fruitful results in the present session. 
We concluded that, rather than attempt to 
review the many questions to which we at-
tach importance, we could make a more use-
ful contribution by concentrating on the 
serious dangers to peace now existing in 
Asia?particularly the war in Vietnam; and 
by treating this subject in a constructive 
and positive way. 
The conflict in Viet-Nam is first of all an 
Asian issue, whose tragedy and suffering fall 
most heavily on the peoples directly involved. 
But its repercussions are world-wide. It 
diverts much of the energies of many na-
tions, my own included, from urgent and 
constructive endeavors. It is, as the Secre-
tary General said in his statement on Sep-
tember 1, "a source of grave concern and is 
bound to be a source of even greater anxiety, 
not only to the parties directly involved and 
to the major powers but also to other mem-
bers of the Organization." My Government 
remains determined to exercise every re-
straint to limit the war and to exert every 
effort to bring the conflict to the earliest pos-
sible end. 
The essential facts of the Viet-Nam con-
flict can be stated briefly?Viet-Nam today 
remains divided along the demarcation line 
agreed upon in Geneva in 1954. To the 
north and south of that line are North Viet-
Nam and South Viet-Nam. Provisional 
though they may be, pending a decision on 
the peaceful reunification of Viet-Nam by 
the process of self-determination, they are 
nonetheless political realities in the inter-
national community. 
The Geneva Accord which established the 
demarcation line is so thorough in its pro-
hibition of the use of force that it forbids 
military interference of any sort by one side 
in the affairs of the other; it even forbids 
civilians to cross the demilitarized zone. In 
1962 military infiltration through Laos was 
also forbidden. Yet, despite these provi-
sions, South Viet-Ram is under an attack, 
already several years old, by forces directed 
and supplied from the north, and reinforced 
by regular units?currently some 17 identi-
fied regiments?of the North Vietnamese 
Army. The manifest purpose of this attack 
is to force upon the people of South Viet-
Nam a system which they have not chosen 
by any peaceful process. 
Let it be noted that this action by North 
Viet Nam Contravenes not only the United 
Nations Charter, but also the terms of Gen-
eral Assembly resolution 2131(XX), adopted 
unanimously only last December and en-
titled "Declaration -on the Inadmissibility 
in Vie Domestic Affairs of States and the 
Protection of their Independence and 
Sovereignty." That resolution declares, 
among other things, that "no State has the 
right to intervene, directly, or indirectly, 
for any reason whatever, in the internal or 
external affairs of any other State." It fur-
ther declares that "no State shall organize, 
assist, foment, finance, incite or tolerate sub-
versive, terrorist or armed activities directed 
toward the violent overthrow of another 
State, or interfere in civil strife in another 
State." It would be hard to write a more 
concise description of what North Viet-Nam 
is doing, and has been doing for years, in 
South Viet-Nam. 
Certainly the prohibition of the use of 
force and subversion?both by this resolu-
tion and by the Charter itself?Must apply 
with full vigor to international demarcation 
lines that have been established by solemn 
international agreements. This is true not 
only in Viet-Nam but in all the divided 
States, where the recourse to force between 
the divided parts can have far-reaching con-
sequences. Furthermore, solemn interna-
tional agreements, specifically the Geneva 
Accords, explicity prohibit recourse to force 
as a means of reunifying that country. 
Mr. President, it is because of the attempt 
to upset by violence the situation in Viet-
Nam, and its far-reaching implications else-
where, that the United States and other 
'countries have responded to appeals from 
South Viet-Nam for military assistance. 
Our aims in giving this assistance are 
strictly limited. We are not engaged in a 
"holy war" against communism. We do not 
seek to establish an American empire or a 
"sphere of influence" in Asia. We seek no 
permanent military bases, no permanent 
establishment of troops, no permanent alli-
ances, no permanent American "presence" of 
any kind in South Viet-Nam. We do not 
seek to impose a policy of alignment on South 
Viet-Nam. We do not seek the overthrow of 
the Government of North Viet-Nam. We do 
not seek to do any injury to mainland China 
nor to threaten any of its legitimate interests. 
We do not ask of North Viet-Nam an uncon-
ditional surrender or indeed the surrender of 
anything that belongs to it; nor do we seek 
to exclude any segment of the South Viet-
namese people from peaceful participation in 
their country's future. 
Let me say affirmatively and succinctly 
what our aims are. 
We want a political solution, not a military 
solution, to this conflict. By the same 
token, we reject the idea that North Viet-
Nam has a right to impose a military solu-
tion. 
We seek to assure for the people of South 
Viet-Nam the same right of self-determina-
tion?to decide their own political destiny, 
free of force?that the United Nations Char-
ter affirms for all. 
And we believe that reunification of Viet-
Nam should be decided upon through a free 
choice by the peoples of both the North and 
South without outside interference, the re-
sults of which choice we are fully prepared 
to support. 
These, then, are our affirmative aims. We 
are well aware of the stated position of Hanoi 
on these issues. But no differences can be 
resolved without contact, discussions or ne-
gotiations. For our part, we have long been 
and remain today ready to negotiate with-
out any prior conditions. We are prepared 
to discuss Hanoi's four points together with 
any points which other parties may wish to 
raise. We are ready to negotiate a settle-
ment based on a strict observance of the 
1954 and 1962 Geneva Agreements, which 
observance was called for in the communique 
of the recent meeting of the Warsaw Pact 
countries in Bucharest. And we will sup-
port a reconvening of the Geneva Confer-
ence, or an Asian conference, or any other 
generally acceptable forum. 
At the same time we have also considered 
whether the lack of agreement on peace aims 
has been the sole barrier to the beginning of 
negotiations. We are aware that some per-
ceive other obstacles, and I wish to make 
three proposals with respect to them: 
First, it is said that one obstacle is the 
United States bombing of North Viet-Nam. 
Let it be recalled that there was no bombing 
of North Viet-Nam for five years during 
which there was steadily increasing infiltra-
tion from North Viet-Nam; during which 
there were no United States combat forces 
In Viet-Nam; and during which strenuous 
efforts were being made to achieve a peace-
ful settlement. And let it further be re-
called that twice before we have suspended 
our bombing, once for thirty-seven days, 
without any reciprooal act of de-escalation 
from the other side, and without any sign 
from them of a willingness to negotiate. 
Nevertheless, let me say that, in this mat-
ter, the United States is willing once again 
to take the first step. We are prepared to 
order a cessation of all bombing of North 
Viet-Nam?the moment we are assured, pri-
vately or otherwise, that this step will be 
answered promptly by a corresponding and 
appropriate de-escalation on the other side. 
We therefore urge that the Government in 
Hanoi be asked the following question, to 
which we would be prepared to receive either 
a private or a public response: 
Would it, in the interest of peace, and in 
response to a prior cessation by the United 
States of the bombing in North Viet-Nam, 
take corresponding and timely steps to reduce 
or bring to an end its own military activities 
against South Viet-Nam? 
Another obstacle is said to be North Viet-
Name conviction or fear that the United 
States intends to establish a permanent mili-
tary presence in Viet-Nam. There is no basis 
for such a fear. The United States stands 
ready to withdraw its forces as others with-
draw theirs so that peace can be restored in 
South Viet-Nam, and favors international 
machinery?either of the United Nations or 
other machinery? to ensure effective super-
vision of the withdrawal. We therefore urge 
that Hanoi be asked the following question 
also: 
Would North Viet-Nam be willing to agree 
to a time schedule for supervised phased 
withdrawal from South Viet-Nam of all ex-
ternal forces?those of North Viet-Nam as 
well as those from the United States and 
other countries aiding South Viet-Nam? 
A further obstacle is said to be disagree-
ment over the place of the Viet Cong in the 
negotiations. Some argue that, regardless 
of different views on who controls the Viet 
Cong, it is a combatant force and, as such, 
should take part in the negotiations. 
Our view on this matter was stated by 
President Johnson, who made clear that, as 
far as we are concerned, this question would 
not be "an insurmountable problem". We 
invite the authorities in Hanoi to consider 
whether this obstacle to negotiation may not 
be more imaginary than real. 
Mr. President, we offer these proposals in 
the interest of peace in Southeast Asia. 
There may be other proposals. We have not 
been and are not now inflexible in our po-
sition. But we do believe that, whatever 
approach finally succeeds, it will not be one 
which simply decries what is happening in 
Viet-Nam and appeals to one side to stop 
while encouraging the other. Such a po-
sition can only further delay the peace we all 
desire. The only workable formula for a 
settlement will be one which is just to the 
basic interests of all those involved. 
In this spirit we welcome discussion of this 
question either in the Security Council where 
the United States itself has raised the matter, 
or here in the General Assembly, and we are 
fully prepared to take part in any such dis-
cussion. We earnestly solicit the further 
Initiative of any organ or any Member of 
the United Nations whose influence can help 
in this cause. Every Member has a respon-
sibility to exert its power and influence for 
peace; and the greater its power and in-
fluence, the greater is this responsibility. 
Now I turn to another problem, related 
In part to the first: the problem of how to 
foster a constructive relationship between 
the mainland of China, with its 700 million 
people, and the outside world. The misdi-
rection of so much of the energies of this 
vast, industrious and gifted people into xeno-
phobic displays, such as the extraordinary 
and alarming activities of the Red Guards; 
and the official policy and doctrine of pro-
moting revolution and subversion through-
out the world?these are among the most 
disturbing phoenomena of our age. Surely, 
among the essentials of peace in Asia are 
"reconciliation between nations that now call 
themselves enemies" and, specifically, "a 
peaceful mainland China." 
Let me say categorically that it is not the 
policy of the United States to isolate Corn-

munist China from the world. On the con-
trary, we have sought to limit the areas of 
hostility and to pave the way for the restora-
tion of our historically friendly relations 
with the great people of China. 
Our efforts to this end have taken many 
forms. Since 1955, United States representa-
tives have held 131 bilateral diplomatic meet-
ings in Geneva, and later in Warsaw, with 
emissaries from Peking. 
We have sought without success to open 
numerous unofficial channels of communi-
cation with mainland China. 
We have made it clear that we do not 
intend to attack, invade, or attempt to over-
throw the existing regime in Peking. 
And we have expressed our hope to see 
representatives of Peking join us and others 
in mantngful negotiations on disarmament, a 
nuclear test ban, and a ban on the further 
spread of nuclear weapons. 
But the international community cannot 
countenance Peking's doctrine and policy of 
intervening by violence and subversion in 
other nations, whether under the guise of so-
called wars of national liberation against 
independent countries or under any other 
guise. Such intervention finds no place in 
the United Nations Charter, nor in the resolu-
tions of the General Assembly. Yet dozens 
of nations represented in this hall have had 
direct experience of these illegal activities. 
It is in the light of these facts, and of 
our desire for a better atmosphere, that the ' 
United States has carefully considered the 
? issues arising from the absence of representa-
tives of Peking from the United Nations. 
Two facts bear on this issue and on the 
attitude of my country toward any attempted 
solution. 
First, the Republic of China on Taiwan is a 
founding member of the United Nations and 
its rights are clear. The United States will 
vigorously oppose any effort to exclude the 
representative of the Republic of China from 
the United Nations in order to put repre-
sentatives of Communist China in their place. 
The second fact is that Communist China, 
unlike anyone else in the history of this 
Organization, has put forward special and 
extraordinary terms for consenting to enter 
the -United Nations. In addition to the ex-
pulsion of the Republic of China, there are 
also demands to transform and pervert this 
Orgnaization from its Charter purposes--
some of them put forward as recently as 
yesterday. 
What can be the cause of this attitude? 
We cannot be sure, but we do know that it 
comes from a leadership whose stated pro-
gram is tei transform the world by violence. 
It comes from a leadership which is opposed 
to any discussion of a peaceful settlement in 
Viet-Nam. It would almost seem that these 
leaders wish to isolate their country from a 
world?and from a United Nations?that 
they cannot transform and control. Indeed, 
they have already brought their country to 
a degree of isolation that is unique in the 
world today?an isolation not only from the 
United States and its allies, but from most 
of the non-aligned world and even from most 
of the Communist nations. Many, not only 
the United States, have sought improved 
relations and have been rebuffed. 
At this moment in history, therefore, Mr. 
President, the basic question about the rela-
tion between Communist China and the 
United Nations is a question to which only 
the leaders in Peking can give the answer. 
Will they refrain from putting forward 
clearly unacceptable terms; and are they 
prepared to assume the obligations of the 
United Nations Charter, in particular the 
basic Charter obligation to refrain from the 
threat or use of force against the territorial 
integrity or political independence of any 
state? 
' The world?and my Government?will lis-
ten most attentively for a helpful response 
to these questions. We hope it will come 
soon?the sooner the better. Like many 
other members here, the United States has 
the friendliest historic feelings toward the 
great Chinese people, and 'looks forward to 
the occassion when they will once again 
enrich, rather than endanger, the fabric of 
the world community. and, in the spirit of 
the Charter, "practice tolerance and live to-
gether in peace with one another as good 
neighbors." 
Mr. President, I have dwelt on these great 
and thorny issues of Asia because they are of 
? 
far more than regional importance. Progress 
toward their solution would visibly brighten 
the atmosphere of international relations all 
over the world. It would enable the United 
Nations to turn a new corner--to apply it-
self with new energy to the great tasks of 
reconciliation and peaceful construction 
which lie before us in every part of the 
globe. 
Such peaceful construction is needed above 
an in the less developed areas. It is needed 
in Southeast Asia, today a region of con-
flict but also a region of vast undeveloped 
resources?where my country is prepared to 
make a most substantial contribution to the 
development of the whole region including 
North Viet-Nam. It is needed in the West-
ern Hemisphere, where, under the bold ideals 
of the Alliance for Progress, the states of 
Latin America are already carrying out a 
far-reaching, peaceful process of economic 
and social development. 
In no area are the tasks of economic de-
velopment more important than on the con-
tinent of Africa?represented in this hall by 
the delegates of thirty-seven nations. Last 
May, in commemorating the anniversary of 
the Organization of African Unity, the Presi-
dent suggested ways in which the United 
States, as a friend of Africa, might help with 
some of that continent's major economic 
problems. Our efforts in this entire field are 
now entering a new stage as we begin to 
carry out the recommendations of a special 
committee appointed to review United States 
participation in African development pro-
grams, both bilateral and multilateral. 
But the economic side of peace cannot 
stand alone. The time is past when either 
peace or material progress could be founded 
on the domination of one.people, or one race 
or one group, by another. Yet attempts to 
do just that still continue in southern Africa 
today. As a result, the danger to peace in 
that area is real. 
My Government holds strong views on 
these problems. We are not, and never will 
be, content with a minority government in 
Southern Rhodesia. The objective we sup-
port for that country remains as it was stated 
last May: "to 'open the full power and re-
sponsibility of nationhood to all the people 
of Rhodesia?not just 6 percent of them." 
Nor can we ever be content with a situa-
tion such as that in Southwest Africa, where 
one race holds another in intolerable sub-
jection under the false name of apartheid. 
The decision of the International Court, 
in refusing to touch the merits of the ques-
tion of Southwest Africa, was most disap-
pointing. But the application of law to this 
question does not hang on that decision 
alone. South Africa's conduct remains sub-
ject to obligations reaffirmed by earlier ad-
visory opinions of the Court whose authority 
is undiminished. Under these opinions, 
South Africa cannot alter the international 
status of the territory without the consent 
of the United Nations; and South Africa 
remains bound to accept United Nations 
supervision, submit annual reports to the 
General Assembly, and "promote to the ut-
most the material and moral well-being and 
the social progress of the inhabitants." 
This is no time for South Africa to take 
refuge in a technical finding of the Interna-
tional Court, which did not deal with the 
substantive merits of the case. The time is 
overdue for South Africa to accept its obli-
gations to the international community in 
regard to Southwest Africa. Continued vio-
lation by South Africa of its plain obliga-
tions to the international community would 
necessarily require all members to take such 
an attitude into account in their relation-
ships with South Africa. 
Mr. President, many other questions of sig-
nificance will engage our attention during 
this session of the General Assembly.: Fore-
most among them are questions of disarma-
ment and arms control, of which the most 
urgent are the completion of a treaty to pre-
vent the further proliferation of nuclear 
weapons and the extension of the limited 
test ban treaty. Remaining differences on 
these issues can and must be resolved on a 
basis of mutual compromise. 
Finally, I wish to speak of one further , 
matter of great concern both to the United 
Nations and to ray country: the draft treaty 
to govern activities in outer space including 
the moon and other celestial bodies. 
Major progress has been made in the nego-
tiation of this important treaty, but several 
Issues remain. One of these concerns the 
question of reporting by space powers on 
their activities on celestial bodies. A second 
issue concerns access by space powers to one 
another's installations on celestial bodies. 
On both of these points the United States, 
at the most recent meeting of the Legal Sub-
committee of the Committee on Outer Space, 
made significant compromise proposals in. 
the interest otearly agreement. 
Unfortunately, the USSR has not re-
sponded constructively to these proposals. 
Instead, it has insisted on still another mat-
ter: a provision requiring states whic.h grant 
tracking facilities to one country to make 
the same facilities available to all others?
without reciprocity and without regard to 
the wishes of the granting state. The obli-
gation proposed by the USSR was unaccept-
able to many countries participating in the 
outer-space discussions, and was supported 
only by a very small number of East Euro-
pean states. 
Tracking facilities are a matter for bi-
lateral negotiation and agreement. The 
United States has held such discussions and 
reached such agreements with a nu:mber of 
countries on a basis of mutual commitment 
and common advantage. France and the 
European Space Research Organization have 
also established widespread tracking net-
works on a similar basis. It is, of course, 
open to the USSR and any other space power 
to proceed in exactly the same way. 
I should like to state today my Govern-
ment's interest in bilateral cooperation in 
tracking of space vehicles on the basis cf 
mutual benefits, and I should like to make 
an offer to help resolve this impasse: If the 
USSR desires to provide for tracking cover-
age from United States territory, we for our 
part, are prepared to discuss with Soviet 
representatives the technical and other re-
quirements involved with a view to reaching 
some mutually beneficial agreement. Our 
scientists and technical representatives can 
meet without delay to explore the possi-
bilities. 
The outer space treaty is too important 
and too urgent to be delayed. This treaty 
offers us the opportunity to establish, in the 
unlimited realm of space beyond this planet, 
a rule of peace and law?before the arms 
race has been extended into that realm. it 
Is all the more urgent because of man's 
rapid strides toward landing on the moon. 
By far the greater part of the work on the 
treaty is now behind us. We have agreed on 
important provisions, including major ob-
ligations in the area of arms control. We 
should proceed to settle the remaining sub-
sidiary issues in a spirit of understanding 
so that this General Assembly may give its 
approval to a completed treaty before the 
Assembly adjourns.

Mr. President, it is our earnest hope that 
the words of the United States today on all 
these issues may contribute to concrete steps 
toward peace and a better world. 
We know the difficulties but we are not 
discouraged. In the twenty-one turbulent 
years since the Charter went into effect, we 
of the United Nations have faced conflicts 
at least as great and as difficult as any that 
confront us today. The failure of this Or-
ganization has been prophesied many times. 
But all these prophesies have been disproved. 
Even the most formidable issues have not 
killed our Organization?and none will. In-
deed, it has grown great and respected by fac-
ing the hardest issues and dealing forth-
rightly with them. 
There is no magic in the United Nations 
save what we its members, bring to it. And 
that magic is a simple thing; our irreducible 
awareness of our common humanity and 
our consequent will to peace. Without the 
awareness and that will, these buildings 
would be an empty shell. With them, we 
have here the greatest instrument ever de-
vised by man for the reconciliation of con-
flicts and the building of the better future 
for which all mankind yearns. 
A BILL TO ENCOURAGE THE INCLU-
SION OF LOSS RAIL CARRIERS IN 
RAILROAD MERGERS 
(Mr. WIDNALL (at the request of Mr. 
Comunz) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. WIDNALL. Mr. Speaker, I am 
today introducing a bill which would 
provide an income tax incentive to the 
possible merger partners of small, debt-
ridden rail carriers through the means 
of a full carryover of net operating' 
losses of the smaller carrier to the new 
railroad corporation formed by a merger. 
This bill, I believe would assist such 
railroads as the debt-ridden Erie-Lack-
awanna Railroad in their efforts to be 
Included as a part of a major rail sys-
tem in the East through merger proceed-
ings. 
With a long-term debt of $345 million, 
and operating losses in 9 out of the last 
10 years amounting to $117 million for 
tax purposes, it is no wonder that the 
Erie-Lackawanna is so unattractive as a 
merger candidate. In addition, any 
merger partner would have to be pre-
pared to either take over the Erie-Lack-
awanna payroll of more than $9 million 
per month by employing that railroad's 
workers, or assume an obligation in line 
with the standard Washington condi-
tions imposed by the Interstate Com-
merce Commission of providing each 
worker laid off with 60 percent of his pay 
for the next 5 years. 
Under the present law, loss carryovers 
can be used in a merger of railroads of 
not too unequal sze. This is not the case 
with a merger between the smaller debt-
ridden carriers such as the Erie-Lack-
awanna with any of the three major 
Eastern giants, the C. & 0.-B. & 0., the 
Norfolk and Western, or the proposed 
Pennsylvania-New York Central. Nor 
Is there any carryover of net operating 
losses where the assets of an insolvent 
railroad, such as the New Haven, are 
transferred to another railroad. My bill, 
if enacted, would eliminate these in-
equities. 
The continuing losses from commuter 
service plaguing the Erie-Lackawanna 
and other small carriers has created re-
sistence to merger on the part of the 
larger rail systems and even the ICC. 
The ICC could require the inclusion of 
the smaller systems, commuter service 
and all, as a condiiton to approval of 
any merger proposals invloving the large 
rail networks. But the Agency is un-
doubtedly aware of the fact that such a 
requirement could be challenged in court 
on the grounds that it would not con-
form to the best interests of promoting 
a sound rail transportation policy. My 
bill, if enacted, would both assist the 
larger carriers in meeting the impact 
of merger with loss rail lines, and would 
provide the ICC with suffiicent reason for 
the Agency to require the continuation of 
the necessary commuter service by the 
merged lines. 
My bill would allow a 10-year period 
to be used, rather than the standard 
'7-year period, for calculating carryover 
losses. It would apply only in the case 
of regulated rail carriers, defined by law 
as a corporation with 80 percent or more 
of its gross income originating through 
the furnishing or sale of transportation. 
The merged corporations, as a new cor-
porate entity, would have to continue as 
a regulated rail carrier to benefit from 
the tax carryover provisions. I would 
estimate that in the case of the Erie-
Lackawanna, the Treasury might lose 
up to $42 million in taxes following a 
merger. 
The potential loss of 16,000 jobs, and 
of rights-of-way that might later have 
to be repurchased for a mass transporta-
tion system, as well as the need for main-
taining important freight and commuter 
service, clearly outweighs any temporary 
revenue loss. 
The legislation I have introduced to-
day is similar in nature to H.R. 10542, 
introd-Iced by my colleague from New 
York, Mr. KEOGH, whose experience in 
these matters as a member of the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means is highly 
valued. I would hope that early hearings 
could be held on this measure, given the 
fact that the question of the inclusion 
of the small rail carriers in mergers of 
the large eastern railroads and the con-
tinuation of commuter service is still be-
ing determined before the ICC and the 
courts. Action on the part of the Con-
gress on this proposal would be of great 
benefit in the development of a national 
rail merger policy at the national level, 
particularly here in the Northeast. 
(Mr. WIDNALL (at the request of Mr. 
CONABLE) was granted permission to ex-

[Mr. WIDNALL'S remarks will appear 
hereafter in the Appendix.] 
NEW BATTLE CRY FOR FARMERS 
(Mr. FINDLEY (at the request of Mr. 
CONABLE) waS granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Speaker, after 
years of congressional effort aimed at 
strengthening farm income in the face 
of adverse market conditions, Congress 
must now give its attention to protect-
ing the farmer from selective price fix-
ing by the executive branch of the Fed-
eral Government. 
The farmer is entitled to full parity 
income in the marketplace, but he is 
being denied it because the President and 
his aids arbitrarily use a variety of de-
vices to drive down farm prices. 
This is a reversal of the historic role 
of government in farm problems. 
For the first time in American history 
the power of government is being used 
to beat farm prices down below parity. 
The Congress has been slow to recog-
nize this change, and action to curb 
arbitrary control over farm prices must 
be given top priority when the next ses-
sion convenes in January. 
Singling out farmers for punishment?
through dumping grains, curbing hides 
exports, urging consumer boycotts and 
the like?is patently unfair in times of 
inflation. Farmers today are in a wor-
sening cost-price squeeze. 
The parity ratio?which measures the 
prices they get with what they must pay 
for goods and services?is 20 percent 
below the fair level. The new legisla-
tive battle cry of farmers must be: "Full 
parity in the marketplace." 
Farm operating expenses are running 
about 4 percent higher than a year ago 
and still climbing. Across-the-board 
price controls are one thing. Selective 
punishment of farmers is quite another. 
A logical first step toward protecting 
the farmer in his right to full parity in 
the marketplace is to insulate Govern-
ment grain holdings from normal market 
channels. With that in mind I have 
proposed that Government wheat stocks 
cannot be sold for less than $2 a bushel. 
Similar limits should be placed on Gov-
ernment sales of other grains. 
PROVIDING FOR COST-OF-LIVING 
INCREASES IN THE BENEFITS 
PAYABLE UNDER SOCIAL SECU-
RITY 
(Mr. BROCK (at the request of Mr. 
CONABLE) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
ter.) 
Mr. BROCK. Mr. Speaker, today I am 
introducing a bill to amend title II of the 
Social Security Act to provide for cost-
of-living increases in the benefits pay-
able thereunder. 
Inflation steals from everyone, young 
and old alike, but hurts especially those 
elderly Americans who live on pensions 
or other fixed incomes. 
During the period from 1958 to 1965, 
the consumer price index increased over 
8 percentage points. The cost of serv-
ices, which our older citizens are more 
likely to need than our younger citizens, 
increased over 16 percentage points. 
When services, exclusive of rent, are con-
sidered, the increase was 18 percentage 
points. Yet during this 7-year period, 
social security beneficiaries received no 
inctease in social security benefits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? HOUSE September 
Inflation is now a fact of life. Prices 
continue to soar upward. There is an 
urgent need for such a change in the law 
as this bill proposes. Our older people 
and others who live on fixed incomes 
simply cannot stand the pace of this ad-
ministration's inflation. 
There is a precedent for such a, provi-
sion as I am introducing. Congress, in 
the Federal Employees Salary Act of 
1962, section 1102, provided for an auto-
matic increase in civil service retirement 
pensions when there has been an in-
crease of 3 percent or more in the con-
sumer price index. 
Why should our elderly people and 
others continue to suffer while runaway 
Inflation further destroys the purchasing 
power of their dollar? I urge immediate 
passage of the bill.

(Mr. WALKER of Mississippi (at the 
request of Mr. Comuu,E) was granted 
Permission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. WALKER of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to 
the so-called war on poverty and any 
measure that would extend this pro-
gram in any degree. 
I have seen, in my own congressional 
district many examples of how these 
funds are "misused" for strictly political 
purposes. I have seen examples on how 
"poverty" money has been used in my 
State to promote racial unrest. I have 
seen how the taxpayer's money has been 
taken by Great Society bureaucrats in 
high salaried positions in the name of 
helping the poor. And, I have seen tax 
money used in my State to pay rent on 
toilets, drinking fountains, refrigerators, 
and so forth, when in fact the property 
was claimed to be rent free. 
The questionable activities of the war 
on poverty by no means ends with the 
State of Mississippi. The entire nation-
wide program has proven ineffective, and 
a burden on the American taxpayer. 
At the present time we have committed 
approximately 300,000 servicemen?and 
no telling how many dollars?to fight 
the spread of communism in the Far 
East. There is no question in my mind 
that we should be there, but I do strong-
ly question the wisdom of conducting a 
so-called wax on poverty at home with 
funds we should be using to provide 
equipment and supplies to our military 
men. 
We in the Congress over the past sev-
eral months have heard much about var-
ious shortages in equipment and supplies 
in Vietnam, trucks, medical equipment, 
and ammunition. There has also been 
considerable talk on the subject of a pos-
sible tax increase to cover the added 
cost of the war in Vietnam. In my judg-
ment, there is no excuse whatsoever for 
our country to experience either military 
shortages?or monetary shortages. 
Our taxes are quite high enough if 
we would cut this political shackel from 
the taxpayer. In the President's budget 
message this year, he proposed sharp 
cutbacks in our school lunch program 
and the school milk program?these Pro-
grams have proven effective for years 
now, yet Great Society officials say they 
are interested in helping the poor. I 
am afraid that the only help the Great 
Society wants to give to the poor is that 
which binds them to the Great Society's 
political machine. The administration 
claims that it is exercising prudence in 
Its spending. Yet, it asks the Congress 
to provide this poverty bill calling for 
even greater expenditures than last year's 
program. This increase must be covered 
by the taxpayer when threats of a tax 
increase is at hand. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my Colleagues to 
weigh carefully the many pitfalls of 
this bill, the enormous responsibility we 
in Congress have to our servicemen in 
Vietnam, as well as our responsibility to 
the American taxpayer during this time 
of inflation, to set the example toward 
curbing domestic spending.

CONADLE) was granted permission to ex-

FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMPLICATIONS 
(Mr. DERWINSKI (at the request of 
Mr. CONABLE) was granted permission to 
extend his remarks at this point in 
the RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. DERWINSKI. Mr. Speaker, the 
complications in foreign affairs are a 
growing concern to the public, and I am 
very pleased to note the leadership 
struggle against communism that is de-
veloping at the grassroots level. 
Typical of this leadership are speakers 
who are discussing this subject with 
their fellow Americans in a most effective 
fashion. I insert in the RECORD as a 
continuation of my remarks, a speech by 
Mr. Walter V. Chopyk, of Buffalo, N.Y., 
the public relations director of the Anti-
Communist Committee of Western New 
York, who, in addition, is secretary of the 
Erie County Planning Department. 
His remarks were delivered at a meet-
ing of the Kiwanis Club in Wilkes-Barre, 
Pa., on July 21. His topic, "Berlin West; 
Berlin, East," was delivered in line with 
Captive Nations Week, July 17-23: 
REMARKS OF MR. WALTER V. CHOPYK TO THE 
WILKES-BARRE KIWANIS CLUB IN WILKES-
BARRE, PA., ON JULY 21, 1966, AFTER SLIDES 
AND BRIEF TALK ON "BERLIN, WEST; BERLIN, 
EAST," IN LINE WITH CAPTIVE NATIONS 
WEEK COMMEMORATION 
Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, you have heard 
my comments on Berlin, West; Berlin, East. 
You have seen the pictures I secured while 
in West Germany and directly on the site of 
that infamous and ominous construction 
dividing illegally?a formerly free nation. I 
have expressed my opinions clearly after 
interviewing many there and seeing (with 
my own eyes) this terrible wall of the 
enslaved--for that is exactly the term we 
can also apply to East Germany in this 
critical hour in this ominous year of 1966. 
No one likes to hear this, Iknow,, and few 
care to discuss this dividing line?cutting 
in half the jewel-like city of Berlin, proper. 
For it really is this (in appearance, and 
especially at night when millions of vari-
colored lights illuminate the free side which 
we call west Benin. 
29 1966 
Before I speak on the Captive Nations 
Week, I ask you sincerely to remember that 
we can no longer go on making mistakes 
such as permitting (as we did and our other 
allies can be so indicted) words to be given?
lines to be written in so-called agreements 
and then?weakly submit when these are 
broken suddenly and a nation or a city thus 
becomes enslaved overnight. 
This is (as you and the world knows) the 
Important week of the year?(so proclaimed 
by our President and many Presidents before 
him)?Captive Nations Week. 
Here?in every major city?we gather to 
commemorate and to honor the nations and 
their brave people?now absorbed into that?
prison of nations erroneously called the 
Soviet Union. There are 28 (and I repeat 
sharply) 28 formerly free, autonomous East 
European nations (East Germany definitely 
Included) all of which are enslaved, ex-
ploited, under dictation from the Muscovites 
daily and we so easily tend to forget this 
factual and appalling reality. 
In passing, may I say, that ere long we 
will be sharply called upon to do something 
more than honor and commemorate these?
the enslaved nations. Humans can endure 
just so much after having lived in freedom, 
masters of their own ventures, governments 
and destiny. The cracking point comes sud-
denly and then, regardless, slaves arise to 
throw off their shackles. East Europe could 
be called a tinder-box today?wating for a 
flare to ignite those feelings (inherent in 
those, all of whom love freedom) and then, 
who can predict the outcome. 
West Berlin (living in freedom, yet liter-
ally rubbing shoulders with slavery) is a 
beacon to those in eastern slavery in Europe 
and may be a pivot, a key territory for West-
ern diplomatic moves in Europe as time 
shows the way and hour for decisions. 
We must never overlook such important 
key facts (nor forget the east Europeans 
fate?their faithful people living here, never 
forget and still wage battle for liberation of 
their old homelands as this Captive Nations 
Week is full evidence). We must remember 
East Europe's fate even though crafty, so-
called friendly Muscovites try now to direct 
our minds towards such places as Vietnam, 
etc. The Soviet would like to consolidate 
their ill-gotten gains in Europe yet always?
free, West Berlin emanates the promise that 
freedom can be held if once obtained again. 
It is the fear and I repeat?the fear (the 
Soviet leaders live with hourly) that inner 
strength in many satellite nations in east 
Europe will suddenly gain .in power and mo-
mentum?then?those in the western alli-
ance would have to act also?and this?the 
Soviets fear and roundly so, as many of their 
recent moves will indicate. Such as, for 
instance (like a carrot to a donkey) re-
laxing tension?policies?permitting more 
western tourists to enter red-dominated sat-
ellites?encouring mail to flow East-West 
more freely?sending Red athletes and art-
ists out of dominated countries, etc. 
Time does not permit further discourse 
regarding East Europe and the Soviet en-
slaved there. But I leave this comment?any 
failure by the western allies to honor their 
guarantees (now remaining) to West Ger-
many will have serious repercussions and 
even the fate of the free world could hang 
In balance for our allies are becoming hard 
to locate?when the need arises?have you 
noticed? 
Again, in passing and as a service to the 
Soviet-enslaved nations at this time of the 
spotlight on Captive Nations Week, I bring 
up again, the idea that the implementation 
of the United Nations Charter regarding "self 
determination of nations" and free elections 
be tabled again and openly discussed and 
considered at the U.N. (and this because 
the time is opportune when so many new 
nations are emerging and being openly rec-
ognized?especially by the Soviet Govern-

is done in the bureaucracy to influence Con-
gressional action is illegal. The law (Title 
18, Section 1913, of the U.S. Code) flatly 
forbids both officers and employes of the 
Executive Branch to use appropriated funds 
for the purpose of lobbying." 
CONFORIVIITY?OR ELSE 
Increasingly, the Administration operates 
a highly developed system of political re-
wards and punishments which politicians 
call "arm twisting." For example, White 
House emissaries offered Democratic Sen. 
E. I. BARTLETT of Alaska decisive backing for 
a $10-million program to upgrade housing 
for Eskimos (which he had hitherto unsuc-
cessfully proposed) if he would switch his 
vote to support this year's controversial rent-
subsidy program. BARTLETT agreed, and the 
Senate approved the potential $6-billion 
measure, 46 to 45. BARTLETT later said, "I'm 
not proud of myself." 
There has been special obedience training 
for the 66 freshman House Democrats. So 
they would parrot only approval, the Demo-
cratic National Committee has drafted their 
speeches and press blurbs. Also, as a fol-
low-up to a Presidential message, "Mike N. 
Manatos, the White House liaison man for 
the Senate, personally handed out ghosted 
reaction" for their use, the Washington Star 
reported. "Sheets were neatly typed, suit-
able for immediate insertion in the records 
of any day's CongreSsional debate. Uni-
formly, the White House speechwriters 
tended toward expansive praise of the Presi-
dent's leadership." 
Meanwhile, the White House arranged for 
them to rendezvous regularly with bosses of 
the government's heftiest spending programs. 
"The purpose," the Washington Post re-
ported, "is to mobilize the resources of the 
federal government to help re-elect" these 
Johnson supporters. Each freshman was 
asked what federal handouts he wanted 
poured into his district. "Administration 
officials have been coached to go along with 
any reasonable requests," the Washington 
Star disclosed. 
Thirty-two senior officials stopped work to 
perform for Representative RICHARD C. 
WHITE of Texas. Before 45 constituents in-
vited to Washington, they wasted two days 
adding up federal money suddenly available 
for WHrrE's district?grants for everything 
from football fields to health centers. Ex-
tolling a, White bill to extend a Texas canal, 
Richard Shunick of the Bureau of Reclama-
tion exclaimed, "The U.S. would pick up the 
whole tab and not charge those who benefit." 
The Democratic National Committee 
meanwhile leased a nationwide communica-
tions network so the freshmen could phone 
announcements of their prizes to newspapers 
and radio stations back home. Representa-
tive JOHN R. HANSEN breathlessly announced 
a new post office for Glenwood, Iowa. 
"Why?" exclaimed the dumbfounded mayor, 
noting that the local post office had just been 
remodeled. 
In return, the Administration demands 
conformity. Freshman Representative JOHN 
C. CULVER of Iowa once mustered enough in-
dependence to oppose a White House-spon-
sored bill. When he sought to explain to 
constituents via the communications net-
work, the National Committee curtly re-
fused him the services it had so eagerly 
offered in the past. 
Representative OTIS PIKE, a liberal Demo-
crat from Long Island, once had his post-
office patronage abruptly cut off for failing 
to support Executive Branch legislation. 
Last spring, because he concluded that the 
tent-subsidy bill was bad for the country, 
he got a warning call from the White House, 
followed by a barrage of others from Ad-
ministration men. Finally, a messenger let 
him know that a vote against rent subsidies 
might cost his district an important research 
project. 
? "There are so many Ways the Executive 
Branch can exert pressure," PIKE explains. 
"There are post offices to be built, inlets to 
be dredged; there is money available for 
poverty and school programs, for agricul-
ture programs and defense programs. There 
are decisions to be made on locating veterans 
hospitals and nuclear reactors. The ac-
cumulation of powers in the Executive 
Branch, at the expense of Congress, is so 
huge that our system of checks and balances 
has largely broken down." 
The threats, bribes, payoffs and persecu-
tions all add up to what liberal commentator 
Eric Sevareid calls "a curious kind of intimi-
dation." So many members of Congress have 
been brought to heel by it that Sevareid 
finds "the once exalted title of Senator or 
Representative has last much of its prestige." 
THE BRAVE ONES' 
Yet there do remain strong men, liberals 
and conservatives, Republicans and Demo-
crats, who fight to make Congress the insti-
tution it was meant to be. They often dis-
agree, but they share the common qualities 
of courage, integrity and independence. 
Republican Rep, To Gnarls studies late 
at night, analyzing and originating legisla-
tion. Then each week or so he flies home to 
St. Louis to explain issues at people's semi-
nars. "A Congressman's job," Cuirris says, 
"should be to give his people independent 
representation." 
Rep. Enrrit GREEN (Dem.) from Oregon 
cries out for creative debate. Though a lib-
eral supporter of Great Society 
she dares to question its sloppy drafting and 
the steamralling. "We have in the House a 
determined effort to silence those in dis-
agreement," she says. 
Just last spring, labor leaders warned 
Democrat Sen. FRANK Lauscuz of Ohio that 
they. would unseat him if he voted to uphold 
right-to-work laws. "The people elected me 
to use my own reasoning and conscience," 
LAUSCHE replied. "I will not be a political 
slave to any special group." And Republican 
Sen. JoHN 3. WILLIAMS of Delaware' cast the 
decisive vote which cost stockholders of his 
state's most influential corporations, Du Pont 
and Christiana, a half-billion dollars in tax 
exemptions. "I'm bound by my oath to seek 
answers that are best for all the people, not 
just a few," he declared. 
As you get ready to go to the polls this 
November, ask yourself how your Representa-
tive and Senators measure up against such 
men and women. Scrutinize their voting 
recoros and find out whether they are legis-
lators or puppets. Judge whether their first 
concern is themselves or the nation. Con-
sider whether they will help wipe out the 
moral and intellectual corruption besetting 
Washington or whether they're content to 
"go along." Find out whether they will join 
the battle to make Congress an independent 
branch of the government which takes orders 
only from the electorate. Whether you vote 
for a Democrat or a Republican is not nearly 
as important as whether you vote for 
integrity. 
A $90-A-DAY 0E0 CONSULTANT 
GETS POVERTY CONTRACT 
(Mr. QUIE (at the request of Mr. 
CONABLE) was granted permission to ex-
tend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. QUIE. Mn Speaker, early this 
year, a $105,247 poverty contract was 
signed to train community action, work 
experience, and adult basic education 
officials in Iowa. The organization de-
signated to train these officials was 
Social, Educational Research & Develop-
ment, Inc.?SERD?whose incorporator, 
president, treasurer, and apparent one-
man corporation was Mr. John W. 
McCollum, a $90-a-day 0E0 consultant. 
We made a mistake by going to SERD?
Said Mr. C. J. Johnson, Iowa State 
Department of Public Instruction?
we could have done as well without SERD. 
Mr. Speaker, the SERD contract has 
been widely criticized in the Des Moines, 
Iowa, area. It not only failed miserably 
in its assigned task of training poverty 
officials, but it is reported that guest 
speakers who receive their regular pay in 
Federal tax dollars were paid honorar-
iums of $75 a day plus expenses. 
? This fiasco raises serious questions of 
conflict of interest, duplication of pro-
grams and wasteful expenditures. What 
justification does 0E0 have in negoti-
ating a contract for this kind of service 
with an individual who is a high-paid 
consultant to 0E0 and whose "firm" is 
obviously unqualified to do the job? 
How many other consultants does 0E0 
have at $90 a day who are receiving 
lucrative poverty contracts from 0E0? 
Local and Regional officials say this con-
tract was negotiated at the Washington 
level of 0E0. It is obvious that this 
incident illustrates yet another example 
of taxpayers money poured down a drain 
Instead of being used effectively to help 
the poor. 
We would like some direct and sensible 
answers as to how this wasteful contract 
came about and what provision has been 
made to avoid future fiascos of this 
natur4i. 
VIETNAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
previous order of the House, the gentle-
man from Michigan [Mr. CHAMBERLAIN] 
Is recognized for 30 minutes. 
(Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. Mr. Speaker, 
because of my concern over the course 
of the war in Vietnam and the real and 
urgent need to cut off supplies to the 
enemy in order to shorten this tragic con-
flict, I have, from time to time, under-
taken to share with my colleagues un-
classified information made available to 
me by the Department of Defense detail-
ing the nature and extent of free world 
shipping into North Vietnam as well as 
the "backdoor" aid the Vietcong derives 
from Cambodia. I know most Members 
share my concern over this trading with 
the enemy by our so-called friends and 
allies, and I am grateful for the support 
that has been given my efforts to pro-
hibit United States aid to any foreign 
country involved in this traffic. I know 
also that most Members have been 
equally concerned over the administra-
tion's apparent willingness to tolerate 
this flow of supplies to the enemy and 
its reluctance to take full and effective 
action against it. 
NO TRADE OR NO AID 
Just last week, in fact, the Administra-
tion in its foreign aid appropriations bill 
requested authority to continue aid to

war goods?to North Vietnam if the

cause the farmer is better organized. 
When it comes to choosing sides, maybe 
Mr. Freeman, and now Mr. Schnittker, 
had better make sure the side they 
choose wants them. Some 80 percent of 
the farmers in the area where I am from 
might have different ideas. 
These farmers, large or small, are 
going to remember that this same De-
partment is the one which lifts cheese 
import restrictions, to the detriment of 
the American dairy farmer; and uses 
Defense Department cutbacks on pork 
buying to control the hog prices, and 
promotes beef imports in competition 
with American farmers; and whose Com-
modity Credit Corporation dumped mil-
lions of bushels of wheat and corn on 
markets which were then bringing the 
farmer only 80 percent of parity; and 
finally the Department which conven-
iently brushes aside the fact that the 
farmer is also faced with inflation. 
WHAT YOUR VOTE CAN DO FOR 
CONGRESS 
(Mr. ASHBROOK (at the request of 
Mr. CormstE) was granted permission to 
.extend his remarks at this point in the 
RECORD and to include extranous matter.) 
Mr. ASHBROOK. Mr. Speaker, I do 
not believe that I have ever read a more 
timely article than the one written by 
Charles Stevenson in the October 1066 
Reader's Digest. Entitled "What Your 
Vote Can Do for Congress," it surely hits 
the nail right on the head. 
The late Senator Jim Reed, constitu-
tional Democrat from Missouri, once said 
that about the most contemptuous per-
son he knew was a "congressional White 
House cat who for a little cream would 
sell the interests of his constituents 
down the river." Modern day rubber-
stamps are no better than that. 
The great article should be read by 
every interested American: 
WHAT YOUR VOTE CAN Do FOR CONGRESS?THE 
URGENT NEED THIS NOVEMBER IS THE ELEC-
TION, NOT JUST OF REPUBLICANS OR DEMO-
CRATS, BUT OF COURAGEOUS MEN WHO WILL 
BE TRUE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE 
(By Charles Stevenson) 
This year's national elections on November 
8 are as important as any in history. The 
future of constitutional government could 
depend upon how you vote; not Republican, 
Demacratic, liberal or conservative, but 
whether you elect Senators and Representa-
tives who will fight to save Congress from the 
forces now destroying it. 
If this statement seems incredible, consider, 
as one example, the role of Congress in the 
S.S. Yarmouth. Castle tragedy. 
Certain money-hungry operators have been 
putting ricketry old ships into the Caribbean-
cruise business under foreign flags, a practice 
which enables them to evade U.S. safety 
regulations. Thousands of unsuspecting 
Americans assume the ships must be safe 
because they are permitted to operate out of 
American ports. Alarmed, legitimate Ameri-
can shipping men and concerned legislators 
of both parties joined to seek a law com-
pelling the dilapidated vessels to meet U.S. 
standards. 
"Floating firetraps . . . could result in 
Unspeakable horror and, death," exploded 
Hoyt Haddock of the AFL-CIO Maritime 
Committee. "Risking the lives of cur 
citizens . .," warned Rear Adm. W. J. McNeil 
Of the Committee of American Steamship 
Lines. The leaky, 38-year-old S.S. Yarmouth. 
Castle was branded especially dangerous. 
"A shining example" of an unfit ship, 
summed up Rep. WILLIAM S. MAILLIARD Of 
California. 
But then the Executive Branch jumped in, 
claiming the urgently needed safety meas-
ures would represent "unreasonable discrim-
ination agilnst foreign-flag vessels." "After 
the word came down from on high," says 
MAILLIARD, "apparently Congress was afraid 
to act am}, it just let the proposals die." 
Two and a half months later the Yarmouth 
Castle caught fire as it wallowed through the 
sea. The general alarm wasn't rung. The 
sprinkler system was ineffective. Fire hoses 
lacked pressure. So flames raged through 
the tinderbox wooden walls. And,, amid 
screams and terror, 90 men and 'women 
perished. 
This incident is shockingly typical of the 
way Congress is surrendering its constitu-
tional legislative role to the Executive 
Branch. Thus it is helping to bring about a 
perilous change in our form of government. 
Our founding fathers deeply feared concen-
tration Of governmental power, so they 
clearly divided authority: the Congress to 
make our laws, the Courts to interpret them, 
the Executive to administer them. And Con-
gress was to be the national forum where the 
voices of all the people could be heard 
through elected representatives directly re-
sponsible to them. 
PELL-MELL LEGISLATION 
Now, however, as stressed by Prof. Samuel 
P. Huntington of Harvard, "Congress has 
conceded not only the initiative in originat-
ing legislation . . . It has also lost the dom-
inant influence it once had in shaping the 
content of legislation." Scarcely ever does 
Congress attempt to refine complicated, 
often revolutionary legislation written by 
Administration bureaucrats-unanswerable to 
the public, and merely dispatched to Con-
gress to be rubber-stamped. 
The result is a crumbling of traditional 
checks and balances that frightens liberal 
and conservative alike. "For heaven's sake," 
Rep. E. J. GURNEY of Florida cried out in dis-
gust on the floor of the House, "let us retain 
a little self-respect and independence as a 
legislative body and have the courage to do 
some of the things on our own once in a 
while." 
Last April, for instance, President Johnson 
called on Congress to compel the taxpayers 
to contribute at least $381 million in supple-
mentary interest so that bankers would find 
it profitable to buy up low-interest loans 
made by the government under its various 
subsidy programs. The receipts from this 
Inflated sale of government assets could then 
be represented as normal income that would 
reduce the Administration's spending deficit. 
Critics of all stripes denounced this gimmick. 
"Just a government subsidy to the banking 
Interests," declared the liberal Americans for 
Democratic Action, ". , . will increase in-
terest rates for all borrowers. . . . accelerate 
the tightening of the money market." Here 
was a measure which cried out. for Congress 
to solicit expert views, to deliberate, to take 
into account the interests of all Americans. 
But what happened? House Banking and 
Currency Committee Democrats in caucus 
agreed that the measure "stank," to quote 
one of them. Yet when they began hearings, 
these men were summoned outside one by 
one to take orders phoned from the White 
House. The committee permitted only two 
witnesses to testify?both sent by the Presi-
dent. In three hours the . committee 
obediently approved the bill, involving nearly 
$11 billion. The House obligingly followed 
suit. Since, interest rates have shot up to 
a 40-year high, making it hard for families to 
buy or sell homes and far industry to finance 
job-creating expansion. 
23543 
"A good bill can stand debate, deliberation 
and full inquiry," warns Rep. Burr TALCOTT, 
a California Republican. "Suppression of - 
debate and of the free expression of opinion 
will inexorably undermine the majority, Con-
gress and the nation." But it goes on all 
the time. 
The President's bill to subsidize the arts 
compels every taxpayer to finance whatever 
painter, musician, woodcarver, wire bender or 
dancer our federal administrators want to 
help support. Many artists themselves op-
posed the measure as restricting rather than 
nourishing art. 
Yet up to the very moment the House 
Labor and Education Committee met to con-
sider the final bill, Republician members 
were denied even a look at it. Rep. ROBERT 
P. GRIFFIN of Michigan, now a Senator, asked 
that it at least be read aloud. Instead, the 
committee hurriedly put through previously 
undiscussed amendments, then approved the 
revolutionary legislation?all in less than 15 
minutes. 
In this pell-mell fashion, Congress has 
been passing even more momentous laws 
without being aware of what the legislation 
would do. It voted Medicare with most of 
the membership thinking it was providing 
only for the elderly. But an unnoticed sec-
tion of the measure enables any state to fur-
nish medical care for anyone regardless of 
age?with taxpayers all over the country re-
quired to pick up the bills. Now the Ad-
ministration quietly has admitted that 
Medicare may cost one billion dollars more 
a year than expected! 
LEFT TO DISCRETION 
Today the Executive Branch is making the 
law. It forces enactment of bills so vaguely 
written that it can make them mean just 
above anything it wants. 
In the $2.3-billion poverty-program legisla-
tion, for example, 87 phrases such as "in his 
discretion" and "as he shall deem necessary 
or appropriate" give bureaucrats an incredi-
bly free hand. 
Thus $256,720 that was voted to help the 
pcor in Appalachia is going instead to a 
branch library in well-off Pittsburgh. Arid 
thus the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development is enabled to make an outright 
gift of $81,351 for tennis courts and a 1.6-acre 
park in Somerset, a swank Washington 
suburb whose 400 families, most of them up-
percrust government employes, boast a 
median income of $17,273, the highest in the 
entire Washington area. Meanwhile, as the 
outraged Washington Post pointed out, the 
adjacent District of Columbia is left without 
funds to light playgrounds "needed by tens 
of thousands" of poor children. 
Further reaching for power inevitably lies 
In prospect. Even as the Executive Branch 
Ignores the clearly written law by refusing to 
submit five-year estimates of what new fed-
eral programs will cost, Budget Director 
Charles L. Schultze tells Congress it no 
longer should bother about costs. Instead, 
he insists, Congress should merely approve 
."goals" dreamed up by the bureaucrats. 
"We're not sure that it is always wise to ex-
press the authorizations in dollar terms," 
Schultze testified. 
The bureaucracy and the White House 
are as one in these seizures of power. Ever 
since New Deal days the bureaucracy has 
been evolving its own elite?career adminis-
trators, top technicians, specialists?who op-
erate the programs and plan what they want 
to enact next. The President often buys 
their ideas; then departmental agents known 
as "legislative liaison" men fan out over 
Capitol Hill, cultivating Congress and, in the 
name of supplying information, actively lob-
bying for the agreed-upon legislation.

President determined it to be in the 
national interest. As I could not possibly 
umceive how it would be in our national 
interest to continue aid to those supply-
ing our enemy I urged that the requested 
authority be denied and was gratified 
that the House agreed with my position. 
As it is, South Vietnam has been getting 
little help from our so-called friends. 
There is no valid reason why we should 
reward those aiding the enemies of free-
dom in southeast Asia. 
HANOI TRADE: THE OTHER HALF 
Particularly disturbing, as well, has 
been the administration's policy, up to 
only a few months ago, of hiding under a 
cloak of unnecessary secrecy, full infor-
mation about this trade. Until April of 
this year the administration was telling 
the American people only half of the 
story about the number of free world 
ships arriving in North Vietnam. Mis-
information and distortion on this sub-
ject still continue to appear. 
The September 19 issue of Newsweek 
magazine contains the following "Peri-
scope" sighting: 
SHIPS TO HAIPHONG 
Only a few "Free World" vessels still carry 
supplies to Haiphong and other North Viet-
nam ports. Maritime Administration watch-
dogs report seven British, four Cypriot, two 
Greek and one Maltese ships between Janu-
ary 26th and July 14th. 
Newsweek bases its information ob-
viously on the list issued by the U.S. 
Maritime AdMinistration of ships pro-
hibited from carrying U.S. Government-
financed cargoes out of U.S. ports be-
cause they had sailed to North Vietnam. 
This so-called blacklist, which I urged 
the President to establish but which the 
Administration inexplicably waited un-
til February 11 of this year to an-
nounce?retroactive to January 25?is 
not an accurate measure of free world 
trade with the Hanoi regime. It records 
only the names of ships, not how many 
times they have gone to North Vietnam. 
The following free-world-flag ships 
appeared on Report No. 7, list of foreign-
flag vessels arriving in North Vietnam 
on or after January 26, 1966, issued Sep-
tember 8 by the Maritime Administra-

Information provided me by the De-
partment of Defense reveals that during 
the period referred to by Newsweek, there 
were actually 22 free-world-flag vessels 
trading with North Vietnam rather than 
14 which they reported. Furthermore, 
since January 1, 1966, there have been 
some 30 different free-world vessels call-
ing at the ports of Haiphong, Hon Gay 
and Campha. What is even more mis-
leading about Newsweek's report is that 
it completely overlooks the fact that 
these 22 ships have made a total of 41 
trips to North Vietnam between January 
25 and July 31. A -look through News-
week's "Periscope" is like looking

It makes reality appear smaller than it is. 
In assessing the full impact of this

Speaker, I insert a chart indicating by

FREE WORLD SHIPPING STILL IMPORTANT 
As compared with the traffic of last 
year, this is a decided improvement. 
This shows something could be done. 
This also shows clearly that more must 
be done. That this traffic exists at all 
is appalling and I will not be satisfied 
so long as there is one free world ship 
helping to supply the enemy. Certainly 
this is not a time to be minimizing this 
deplorable trade and its impact on the 
war effort. In fact, information I have 
received within the past few days con-
cerning the free world ships arriving 
in Haiphong during August of this year 
Included cargo reports which strongly 
suggest the presence of goods of strategic 
value to keep Communist military sup-
plies Moving south. The nature and ex-
tent of this shipping must continue to 
have the closest scrutiny and the Amer-
ican people should be told the facts. 
A BELATED "BLACKLIST" WITH LOOPHOLES 
While it has its weaknesses, the es-
tablishment of the "blacklist" is signifi-
cant in that it put the U.S. Government 
on public record for the first time as 
doing something positive to stop this 
trading with the enemy. In retrospect 
it is clearly incredible that during 1964 
when there were 401 free world ship ar-
rivals in North Vietnam and during 1965 
when there were 256, there was no such 
"blacklist," with some of these same 
ships actually coming to U.S. ports and, 
at least in one instance, picking up U.S. 
Government cargoes. This is even more 
shocking because during 1964 and 1965 
there were more free world ship arrivals 
In North Vietnam than there were Com-
munist-flag ship arrivals. 
Mr. Speaker, I have joined a score of 
other Members in sponsoring legislation 
to close our ports for private as well as 
Government business to all ships of any 
foreign shipping interest which permits 
any of the vessels under its control to 
trade with the Hanoi regime. The ad-
ministration has recommended against 
this legislation, even though for a time 
it was given "de facto" enforcement 
through the extra legal boycott initiated 
by patriotic longshoremen. Why, I ask, 
Mr. President does your administration 
oppose closing our ports to all shipping 
interests that are helping to supply the 
enemy? 
RED-FLAG SIIIPPING UP 
While there has been an apparent de-
cline in free world trade to North Viet-
nam in 1966 it is to be especially noted 
that there has been at the same time an 
Increase in Communist-flag shipping. 
Although I cannot be specific because of 
the nature of the information, I can 
say?based upon general knowledge?
that the increase in Communist-flag 
shipping is most alarming and shows 
clearly the vital importance of outside 
supplies to North Vietnam's war effort. 
It is generally known that these ships 
carry not only oil but military hardware 
as well. It is equally evident that without 
this source of supply, Ho Chi Minh would 
be unable to maintain the present level 
of aggression against us and our allies 
in South Vietnam. Yet we continue to 
just watch this trade and collect statis-
tics, while at the same time sending more 
and more boys into South Vietnam to be 
wounded and killed as they do their best 
to resist an enemy who has been well 
armed with supplies delivered by sea. 
I say we cannot just sit by and watch 
the war being continually escalated in 
South Vietnam by supplies delivered to 
North Vietnam in either Communist or 
free world ships. Our "hands off" policy 
with regard to the procession of ships 
into North Vietnam is but another ex-
ample of the way in which we are fight-
ing this war on terms dictated by the 
Communists. The Vietcong, to be sure, 
give our ships no safe conduct passes up 
the river to Saigon. They have, in fact, 
this past month successfully mined a 
U.S. merchant ship, the Baton Rouge 
Victory, killing seven American crewmen. 
Yet we, with the full might of the U.S. 
Navy controlling the South China Sea, 
just seem to drift about, taking no effec-
tive steps. 
When it became apparent that the So-
viets were shipping missiles into Cuba?
where no U.S. men were fighting?Presi-
dent Kennedy risked a nuclear confron-
tation in stopping those ships. Every-
one applauded his resolve and courage 
in so doing. There is no question as to 
how the SAM missiles entered North 
Vietnam and how they are being con-

tinually resupplied. Such heavy ton-
nages of missiles, antiaircraft guns and 
ammunition can only Come by sea. Yet, 
we are still not doing much about A even 
though these weapons have been shoot-
ing down American fliers. 
CAMBODIA'S "BACKDOOR" AID 
Mr. Speaker, there is another aspect of 
the problem of cutting off the enemy's 
sources of supply which is equally im-
portant, but with which the administra-
tion bas also failed to come to grips. I 
speak of the Vietcong's "backdoor" 
source of supply through Cambodia. 
Following an Armed Services Commit-
tee mission to South Vietnam last April, 
which confirmed numerous reports, I had 
received for several months, I began 
urging that shipping up the Mekong 
River, passing right through South Viet-
nam, to Cambodia be halted for two prin-
ciple reasons: First, to stop the suspected 
flow of contraband over which I found 
there is no effective control; and second, 
to apply economic pressure on Cambodia 
to encourage it to live up to its alleged 
policy of "strict neutrality." 
I have yet to talk to any knowledgeable 
military people who have any doubt that 
Cambodia is used as a Vietcong sanctu-
ary and source of supply. In fact, when 
our subcommittee was only a few miles 
from the border, we were told by a Spe-
cial Forces officer of the existence of 
three airstrips and a training ground 
on Cambodian soil being used by the 
Vietcong. While Cambodian officials 
may not have full information Of these, 
activities, there is no dispute that they 
have openly aided the enemies of South 
Vietnam, 
The Cambodian delegate to the United 
Nations has said his country "continues 
to support morally and politically the 
struggle of the brave Vietnam people 
against American aggression. We have 
never concealed the fact that in token 
of Our solidarity with the Vietnam peo-
ple we have offered medical supplies and 
dried fish to the National Liberation 
Front." 
This is not neutrality. 
In the past, prince Sihanouk, the 
Cambodian Chief of State, has often 
called for better border surveillance by 
the International Control Commission?
composed of Canada, India, and Po-
land?but he always knew that Poland, 
in deference to North Vietnam, would 
not permit it. While indistinct bound-
ary lines present real inspection prob-
lems it would be comparatively easy to 
insure the "neutrality" of goods entering 
Cambodian ports through a meaningful 
examination of ship cargoes as they ar-
rive and I have challenged the Cambo-
dian Government to do just that. 
Mr. Speaker, at this point I insert, a 
chart detailing the extent of free world 
shipping, by country, up the Mekong 
River through South Vietnam en route to 
Cambodia during 1966.

No One wants the war to be enlarged, 
whether into Cambodia or elsewhere, but 
the point is that the war has been carried 
into Cambodia by the Communists with 
at least the tacit permission of Prince 
Sihanouk. This fact cannot be ignored 
If a much longer, costlier, bloodier strug-
gle is to be averted. 
I have advocated economic, not mili-
tary, pressure to be applied to Combodia 
to spike this escalation before it reaches 
even greater proportions. A truly neu-
tral Cambodia has nothing to fear. 
Mr. Speaker, the situation with re-
spect to the "front door" of Haiphong 
and the "back door" of Cambodia can-
not be permitted to continue if we are to 
resolve this conflict. In neither World 
War I nor World War LI were vital sup-
plies permitted to reach our enemies 
without challenge. More recently, in 
the 1962 missile crisis President Kennedy 
did not permit the delivery of strategic 
weapons to Cuba and at, a time when 
there were no American forces in combat 
in that country. Why, I ask, Mr. Presi-
dent, if this is war, as? you have told us, 
has your administration not done more 
to cut off the enemy's source of supply? 
TAX REFORM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
previous order of the House, the gentle-
man from New York [Mr. HALPERN] is 
recognized for 10 minutes. 
(Mr. HALPERN asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HALPERN. Mr. Speaker, last 
June 1, I introduced H.R. 15405, to elimi-
nate the oil depletion allowance. The 
purpose of the bill is to rectify a situa-
tion of special tax advantage which is 
no longer justified. 
When the 90th Congress convenes, as 
soon as possible, Congress should ex-
amine the structure and undertake major 
reform. Most recommendations in this 
field were rejected when the 1964 Reve-
nue Act was enacted into law. 
In remarks I made on the floor of the 
House on June 1, I pointed to the allow-
ances granted oil and other natural re-
sources as a particular inequity which 
should be dealt with at an early date. 
The repeal or substantial reduction 
of this deduction is hut one step in the 
direction of ending tax favoritism. 
September 29 1966 
Local and State taxation is steadily 
rising. In this situation Congress must 
insure that Federal income taxes are 
levied as equitably as possible, and an 
end to privileged treatment is a first 
prerequisite. 
In essence, the combination of local, 
State, and Federal levies, along with ris-
ing prices, is putting lower middle- and 
middle-income groups, as well as retired 
persons, into an intolerable squeeze, 
while other taxable categories are 
granted unjustifiable advantages. 
Tax reform can substantially increase 
Government revenue, at a time when 
deficit spending is feeding the fires of 
inflation. Moreover, when this infla-
tionary period is effectively halted, 
through various methods, then we can 
ease the brunt now unequally borne by 
certain taxable groups and individuals. 
In order to make the Federal tax bur-
den more equitable, Congress should 
undertake major tax reform. And I 
once again urge that the depletion allow-
ance be made a priority item in the re-
drafting of tax treatment. 
GERMAN ADMIRAL SEES NEED FOR 
CLOSER UNION IN NATO 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
previous order of the House, the gentle-
man from Illinois [Mr. FINDLEY ] is rec-
ognized for 30 minutes. 
(Mr. FINDLEY asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FINDLEY. Mr. Speaker, among 
the topics discussed with Chancellor Er-
hard during his recent visit to this coun-
try was cooperation in space exploration. 
This makes timely the conclusion and 
recommendations of German Vice Adm. 
Friedrich Ruge concerning general tech-
nological cooperation among the nations 
of NATO. 
Admiral Ruge, who has participated 
in foreign policy symposia in this coun-
try and written extensively on NATO 
problems, is a member of the panel of 26 
eminent scientists, scholars, and military 
experts established by the House Re,pub-
lican Committee on NATO and the At-
lantic Community to assist in its Atlantic 
studies program. 
Here is Admiral Ruge's statement:: 
NATURE OF THE ALLIANCE 
NATO is a coordinated alliance, its mem-
bers are partners with equal rights though 
of greatly differing size and importance. In 
the Atlantic Council, decisions can be reached 
only by unanimous vote, and the Council has 
no powers to enforce them because it is not 
supranational. As a consequence, problems 
are far more difficult to handle than in a 
subordinated alliance where all the smaller 
partners (satellites) have to obey the orders 
of one hegemonial power as it is the case in 
the Warsaw Pact. 
NATO is an alliance concluded for an in-
definite period, with the proviso that single 
members can leave after twenty years, and 
in the hope that they may not do so. The 
best way to prevent their leaving will be to 
develop the alliance to closer cooperation. 
There is ample historical evidence that coali-
tions of nations have no great life expectancy 
unless they succeed in evolving a closer union 
with a common governing authority responsi-
ble at least for foreign policy and defense.

Vietnam in the Balance 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. DONALD M. FRASER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 28, 1966 
Mr. FRASER. Mr. Speaker, the citi-
zens of the United States are being asked 
to support policies in Vietnam which do 
not rest easily with our traditions. Most 
Americans resist involvement in foreign 
wars, but when involved, want to win. 
Probably the most effective means open 
to the administration to maintain public 
support for the nature and style of our 
pperations in Vietnam is through a 
deepening of understanding of the dy-
namics of this struggle, including a care-
ful identification of the political 
component. 
The relationship between the Hanoi 
regime and the Vietcong in the south has 
not been discussed with the care and 
specificity it deserves. Both in public 
discussion and in private conversation 
with policymakers in the executive 
branch, I have been struck with the in-
sistence on the total identity between 
the forces in the south and the north. 
The dogmatic position of the administra-
tion on this point does not engender con-
fidence, but rather doubt. When policy-
makers are so certain about a matter 
Inherently uncertain, larger doubts are 
raised about our perception with respect 
to other aspects of this struggle. 
Earlier this year I commented on the 
relationship between the north and the 
south in the following words?page 4407 
of the March 2 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD: 
The relationship between Hanoi and the 
National Liberation Front has been much 
discussed. Many officials of the U.S. Govern-
ment have repeatedly stressed the role of 
Hanoi in stimulating, organizing, supplying, 
and directing the Vietcong and the National 
Liberation Front. But this does not give 
a complete picture of the relationship be-
tween Hanoi and the forces in the south. 
The strong political motivation of the Com-
munist forces must be studied carefully. 
If a political movement in one country 
decides to extend its influence into another 
country, the usual procedure is to send in 
people to proselytize and to organize on be-
half of the ideas which the political move-
ment seeks to promote. If the organizational 
effort is successful, a group in the second 
country comes into being. Its ideology, per-
haps some of its leadership, and its tactics 
' may continue to be guided by the forces in 
the first country. But the group in the sec-
ond cOnntry still has an independent, viable 
existence. The relationship between the two 
groups is relatively stable so long as the 
tactics are agreed upon. But if the first 
group takes a new course, then the viable 
nature of the group in the second country 
suddenly becomes clear. 
According to the figures of the Defense 
Department, approximately 200,000 of the 
Vietcong are from South Vietnam. These 
Vietcong and the National Liberation Front 
believe they are fighting for certain ideas. 
It would seem doubtful that they regard 
themselves simply as soldiers whose com-
mand loyalties run to Hanoi. Their per-
sistence and their sacrifices could not be 
explained on this basis. 
Thus there is the strong probability that 
as Hanoi has sought to organize in the 
South, it has at the same time created forces 
which, if not independent today, are po-
tentially independent if Hanoi shifts 'o 
courses which are incompatible with the 
primary thrust of those fighting in the 
South. 
Thus, if Hanoi were to pursue a course of 
action which would seem to the National 
Liberation Front to thwart and make use-
less the years of sacrifice, there is doubt 
that Hanoi could compel acceptance of this 
course. But even more devastating, Hanoi 
would be regarded as abandoning an ally in 
the South to which it not only owed an 
ideological allegiance but which it had 
spawned. 
The United States looks at its commitment 
to South Vietnam as binding. Then con-
sider how much more deeply Hanoi must 
feel bound to the fortunes of those whom it 
sponsored in the South. Because this has 
been my rough analysis of this relationship. 
I have always believed that the hope that 
bombing in the North would drive Hanoi 
out of this conflict was doomed to failure. I 
believe furthermore that the bombing would 
force Hanoi into an even more active role 
in the belief that events in the South would 
have to be speeded up as the only way for 
Hanoi to obtain an end to the bombing. 
On the other hand, pressure against the 
National Liberation Front and the Vietcong 
forces could bring about a settlement some 
day. It may be that regardless of what the 
United States does, the fabric of the South 
Vietnamese society is so torn and weakened 
that a successful effort against the Commun-
ist forces cannot be sustained. Whatever 
the settlement possibilities, however, com-
munication directly with the National Lib-
eration Front would seem to make more sense 
than to force Hanoi to act as broker with its 
interests not necessarily paralleling those of 
the Liberation Front. 
In any event, these matters must be looked 
at with care and objectivity. The great stress 
which the Milted States places on the role 
of the North Vietnamese must not obscure 
the fact that our national interests require 
that we make our understanding conform to 
reality. 
My views have been reinforced by an 
excellent article by Bernard Fall appear-
ing in the October 1966 issue of the For-
eign Affairs Quarterly. Because of the 
importance of this question I insert a 
portion of his article in the RECORD: 
VIETNAM IN THE BALANCE 
IV - 
A major part of the whole Viet Nam argu-
ment revolves around a clear identification 
of the character of the enemy?for it is that 
identification which pins the label of "ag-
gressor" on North Viet Nam (and thus justi-
fies military action against it) or, conversely, 
makes the conflict largely a civil war, with 
the United States as the major foreign 
"interventionist." 
A recent issue of Foreign Affairs presented 
an unusually well-argued and sophisticated 
case for the first view? But precisely be-
1 George A. Carver, Jr., "The Faceless Viet 
Cong," Foreign Affairs, April 1965. 
cause it is so well argued, it unconscionsly 
presents some of the arguments for the op-
posite viewpoint as well. And since it is 
almost impossible to discuss the possible ra-
tional outcomes of the Viet Nam situation 
as long as the true character of the ad-
versary is in doubt?it is this writer's own 
belief that it lies somewhere between the two 
extremes presented above?the nature of 
the Viet Cong must be explored further be-
fore it can be definitively dismissed as "face-
less." 
It can be conceded in advance that any 
Communist member of the National Libera-
tion Front in South Viet Nam is likewise a 
momber of the Lao Dong, the Vietnamese 
Communist Party, and that North Viet Nam, 
which had without a shred of doubt won the 
war against France in 1954, fully expected 
to gain control of South Viet Nam as well 
either by the elections slated for July 1956 
or at a later date. I am, however, inclined 
to doubt that Hanoi's decision to intervene 
In South Vietnamese affairs was prompted by 
any "increasing disparity between political 
life north and south." For it became ob-
vious even to the blindest of optimists th-t, 
unfortunately, the political lives of both Viet 
Nams, far from becoming "disparate," be-
gan to resemble each other as only two ex-
tremes can, with their gradual falsification 
of representative processes and, finally, with 
their concentration camps and persecution of 
religious groups. The existence of a "Cen-
tral Reunification Department" in Hanoi of 
which much is made is surely revelatory of 
something?until one becomes aware that 
West Germany, for example, has a Ministry 
for All-German Affairs to which, of course, 
East Germany and the Soviets ascribe equal-
ly sinister motives, even thought it can be 
safely assumed that the Minister tam fiir 
Gesamtdeutsche Fragen is more innocuous 
than any Hanoi committee with the same 
purpose. 
It is likewise very much open to ques-
tion that the intervention of Hanoi was first 
evidenced by a terror campaign directed 
against small South Vietnamese officials. 
In actual fact, Diem began to become op-
pressive as early as January 1956, when a 
concentration camp ordinance (No. 6 of Jan-
uary 11, 1956) gave the regime almost un-
checked power to deal with the opposition?
and the non-Communist opposition, least 
inured to clandestine operations, was hit 
hardest. It took until May 1966 for a U.S. 
Government agency, the Public Affairs Office 
in Saigon, to state candidly what was a well-
known fact all along?to wit, that some of 
the so-called "political-religious" sects pro-
vided the hard core of the early opposi-
tion: 
. . . Ten of the eleven Mao-Dail sub-sects 
had opposed Diem, and their leadership fled 
to Cambodia or went into hiding. . . . The 
members of the other ten sects made up the 
bulk of the early NLF support, although the 
alliance was at all times an uneasy one . . . 
. . . The [Hoa-Hao] sect in 1952 formed 
the Social Democratic Party as its political 
arm. It too challenged Diem, and its armies 
were smashed by .ARVN in 1956. Like the 
Cao Dal, it was an early and major partici-
pant in the NLF, . . . 
. . The third of the esoteric sects of Viet 
Nam, the Binh Xuyen, which was also 
smashed by Diem, also worked with the NLF 
In its early days.2 ' 
The decision by Diem?probably his most 
pregnant in terms of its future consequen-
ces?to abolish elected village government in 
June 1956 (again before the July 1956 elec-
tion deadline, at a time when the Commu-
nists were on their best behavior) did the 
rest. The hated appointees became a prime 
target for local resentment and by March

most of whom have special engineering, sci-
entific or medical qualifications. 
The board has are administrative and en-
gineering staff of 16 and an annual budget 
of $485,000. Near its Los Angeles headquar-
ters, it operate ? one of the world's most com-
plete laboratories in the field of vehicular air 
pollution. 
The newly created board promptly joined 
in a battle that the Los Angeles County 
agency had been waging for years with the 
automobile industry over fume controls. 
DETROIT IS CRITICIZED. 
In a current Federal grand jury inquiry 
in Los Angeles, local officials have charged 
that the auto companies collusively dragged 
their feet for years on producing these con-
trols. Detroit says it was engrossed in re-
search. 
When accessory manufacturers were on 
the verge of preempting the fume control 
business with exhaust attachments. Detroit 
announced in July, 1965, that it was pre-
' pared to turn out oars with built-in equip-
ment. 
This equipment is of two types. One is a 
pump that injects extra air into the ex-
haust manifold so that fumes are burned 
there. Chrysler accomplished the same fume 
reduction by special carburetor and ignition 
rigging. 
The other is a "blow-by" tube. Since 
1963, California has required that new cars 
have these tubes to carry troublesome crank-
case gases back' into the combustion 
chambers. 
Starting last fall, with 1966 models, the 
exhaust controls were made mandatory on 
all new cars. 
The two items, blow-by tubes and exhaust 
Controls, are supposed to eliminate 70 per 
cent of the two worst automebile contam-
inants, hydrocarbon gases and carbon mon-
teXide. Last March the Public Health Serv-
ice felt confident enough of them to promul-
gate the California requirements national-
ly for next year. 
The California beard is considering tight-
ening its restrictions by nearly 50 per cent 
before 1970. The new restrictions would re-
duce permissible hydrocarbon emissions from 
275 parts per million to 180, and carbon mom-
oxide frcun 1,5 percent to I per cent. 
The board is also moving toward control 
of another important pollutant family, 
oxides of nitrogen. Federal officials plan 
to follow close in applying such restrictions 
nationally. 
California had hopes of developing exhaust 
Controls for older care, which make up 90 
per cent of those on the road. This has been 
thwarted by both technical and legislative 
difficulties. The only requirement for pre-
196a models is that crankcase blow-by tubes 
must be put on cars when they change own-
ers. There is no corresponding Federal re-
quirement. 
The achievement of control equipment is 
an oblique process. The state starts out by 
promulgating desired emission standards. 
The standards remain theoretical until in-
dustry comes up with the equipment to 
match the standards. This is the situation 
with oxides of nitrogen, for which controls 
have not yet been devised. 
Another problem that will present itself 
In all 50 states is making sure fume control 
equipment operates effectively, something 
the Federal Government can't police. 
Even California has only cursory random 
inspection by state highway patrolmen. Com-
prehensive checks on fume equipment can 
be incorporated in regular safety inspec-
tions?New York and New Jersey have laws 
calling for them?but there is a problem of 
providing inspection stations with adequate 
testing devices. 
California may also provide lessons for 
Other states in the way it works out its ad-
ministrative structure for pollution control. 
There is now a three-way division of re-
sponsibility among the motor vehicle board, 
the county districts that deal with stationary, 
pollution sources and the State Department 
of Health, which must work closely with the 
others. 
Assuming that each contingent does its 
job perfectly, critics observes, there is no 
unified, statewide determination of prior-
ities in expenditures and effort, However, 
Gov. Edmund G. Brown has just designated 
Eric Grant, the director of the motor vehicle 
board, as an inter-agency coordinator in a 
step toward unification. , 
Vernon MacKenzie, the recent director of 
the Air Pollution Division of the Public 
Health Service, is a soft-speaking man, in-
clined to understatement. But he recently 
remarked ominously: 
"For the next decade or so every urban 
area is going to have to control pollution in 
terms that might be considered radical even 
in Los Angeles."

Noteworthy Editorial 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON., JOHN BELL WILLIAMS 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 28, 1966 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, under 
leave to extend my remarks in the REC-
ORD, I include -the following editorial 
from the September 25, 1966, edition of 
the Vicksburg, Miss., Sunday Post. I 
commend the reading of the editorial to 
my colleagues because of the timely mes-
sage it presents: 
INVESTIGATING THE FAMOUS "GUIDELINES" 
The House of Representatives will seek, 
through investigation, to ascertain if the De-
partment of Health. Education and Welfare, 
through the 'guidelines" it has imposed in 
the field, of education, has overstepped both 
the letter and the spirit of the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act. In true bureaucratic form,. the 
Department of Education, has formulated its 
own pet formulas, has withheld federal 
money from those areas which did not 
knuckle down to its arbitrary regulations, 
and has, in general, assumed a highly dicta-
torial attitude. 
Under the actions of the Department, the 
stress has been put, not on education, but on 
integration. Freedom of choice is not pos-
sible, with the inference that intimidation 
nullifies that freedom. The spectacle of 
busing pupils from one area to another, is 
both ridiculous and tragic, for it is mailing 
pawns out of children who should have no 
interference with their studies. In every 
way, the arrogant and inflexible attitude of 
the Department has done more to down-
grade educaticn in the nation than anything 
else. 
It is timely that- a congressional investi-
gation be undertaken. The Congress passed 
the law, and the law has certain limitations, 
which should be studiously followed. There 
has been a completely biased conception of 
the Civil Rights Act. Under it, discrimina-
tion was banned if based on race or color. 
But it did not spell out literally, or in spirit, 
that it should be used as a vehicle to com-
pletely integrate or to achieve "racial bal-
ance." The absence of discrimination would 
have the effect of bringing the educational 
picture into real perspective, something that 
forced integration and a headlong -dash into 
racial balance would never achieve. 
, As has been so eloquently stated on many 
occasions by spokesmen for the South, the 
- 
A5017 
Civil Rights Act was conceived in politics 
and aimed directly and exclusively at the 
South. In spite of the warnings of our 
Southern representatives, the people of 
other areas swallowed the plea for support 
on the punitive measure. But Northern 
and Eastern and Western citizens have come 
face to face with the "guidelines" and are 
finding out that the South is not the only 
area involved. Transporting pupils from 
one school to another, entirely out of their 
natural environment, has caused the peo-
ple of newer areas to begin to understand 
the warnings which were not heeded during 
the debate on the measures. The opposi-
tion to the dictatorial administration of the 
Department of Education has become both 
spirited and vocal and the representatives 
in the Congress have begun to feel its effect. 
So, let us get down to the business of con-
ducting a searching investigation to ascer-
tain where the power to rule has been given 
by the Act, or has been assumed by the bu-
reaucrats. After all, the cause of public 
education is at stake, and public education 
means just that in every city and county in 
every state in the Union, and the arbitrary 
withholding of funds because arbitrary 
guidelines have not been accepted, is con-
trary to the American concept of govern-
Ment. 
Economic Opportunity Amendments of 
1966 
SPEECH 
OF 
HON. ALBERT H. QUIE 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 28, 1966 
The House in Committee of the Whole 
House on the State of the Union had under 
consideration the bill (H.R. 15111) to provide 
for continued progress in the Nation's war 
on poverty. 
(Mr. QUIE asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. QUIE. Mr. Chairman, I just 
wanted to use this procedure to make 
sure that we will have an opportunity to 
vote on this, because as the gentlewoman 
from Oregon [Mrs. GREEN] suggested, we 
ought to try the $7,000 figure. This is 
very close to what the administration 
says they will eventually be able to run 
these programs, but which is way above. 
any other similar effort training, educa-
tional, and residential which is now 
being carried on. 
Mr. Chairman, as I indicated before, 
this is certainly true with reference to 
the residential vocational schools which 
are training some drop-outs from the Job 
Corps, dropouts who could not be 
trained in the Job Corps at that extra 
cost, but who are now being trained in 
the residential vocational education 
schools for an average of $2,600 per year. 
Mr. Chairman, if they can do it there, 
the Job Corps ought to be able to do it for 
$7,000. 
Surely, Mr. Chairman, this cannot be 
an unreasonable figure and, perhaps, this 
will in and of itself take care of some of 
the high salaries that are being paid to 
staff people and prevent the Job Corps 
from pirating and taking away teachers 
from our other school systems.

Amor-eyed F zrocKelitgsiM/H/2/19ERABp_12W153191*M10040011 0002-4 A5019 
September 29, 
1958 over 400 had been murdered by guer-
rillas who indeed, as Carver points out, 
"harped on local issues and avoided preach-
ing Marxist doctrine." When it is remem-
bered that there were enough "local issues" 
around to cause the South Vietnamese Army 
itself to try at least three -times to murder 
Diem, it becomes understandable why South 
Viet Nam appeared to Hanoi ripe for pluck-
ing. In other words, there can be no doubt 
but that Hanoi, or even South Vietnamese 
stay-behind Communist elements, took ad-
vantage of Saigon's glaring weaknesses after 
1959. But the Communists can hardly be 
held responsible for the incredible stupidity 
of the Diem regime and the somewhat sur-
prising blindness to its faults of its Ameri-
can advisers. And it is equally hard to deny 
that there was plenty of motivation inside 
South Viet Nam, on the left as well as on 
? the right, for a revolutionary explosion. 
The next point which requires clarification 
is not whether the insurgency in South Viet 
Nam is abetted, directed and aided from 
North Viet Nam (it is to a large extent), but 
whether such outside controls preclude the 
existence of real objectives which are spe-
cifically those of the insurgents rather than 
of their external sponsors. Here, the recent 
British revelations as to the truly enormous 
extent of the control of the French Resist-
ance in France by the Special Operations Ex-
ecutive (S.O.E.) ?the 1940-46 British 
equivalent of the Central Intelligence 
Agency?shows what is meant. According to 
the now-published official history of S.O.E. 
in France, "till 1941 the British had a virtual 
monopoly over all of de Gaulle's means of 
communications with France," and the 
French "could not introduce a single agent 
or a single store" without Allied permission 
and help, and "anything [they] planned with 
marked political implications was liable to be 
vetoed by any of the three major Western 
allies." Yet, having substantiated exactly 
what both the Vichy French and the Nazis 
had said all along, i.e. that the French Re-
sistance was nothing but an "Anglo-Saxon 
conspiracy" and the resisters (this writer in-
cluded) nothing but foreign agents, the offi-
cial history makes the key point: "All these 
victories by and through resistance forces in 
France had a common basis: overwhelming 
popular support." 
The hard historical facts which emerge 
from the French Resistance and which ap-
pear to apply to the Viet Cong are (a) that 
in spite of overwhelming technical control by 
the Allies, de Gaulle succeeded in winning 
political and military loyalty among the di-
verse guerrilla forces in France, and (b) 
that even de Gaulle's own views anti desires 
had to accommodate themselves to those de-
veloped by the internal resistance in its four-
year fight, in which it bore the brunt of the 
struggle and suffered the bulk of the losses. 
The differences of view between Viet Cong 
leaders who have now been in the fight for 
six years (and some of them for twenty!) 
and the Hanoi theoreticians and conven-
tional military commanders go in many cases 
far beyond normal internecine party strug-
gles or mere tactical disagreements. 
A glance at factual examples is interesting: 
there have been three changes of N.L.F. sec-
retaries-general at times when Hanoi was in 
? the throes of no purge whatsoever. There 
vyas the N.L.F. five-point manifesto of March 
23, 1965, whose "jungle version" was rebroad-
- cast later by Hanoi with 39 extensive amend-
ments or text changes, softening some of the 
N.L.V. statements. There were the spontane-
ous reactions of N.L.F. leaders when faced 
with respected Western observers on neutral 
ground"' openly explaining why ,they dis-
agreed with the "narrow-minded commissars 
in Hanoi...! And there is the fact that while 
KRA?, root, "sox 
Tier Majesty's StatioM 
33, and 442-443, passim. 
the United States and Hanoi are now offi-
cially wedded to a return to a Geneva-type 
conference (and, presumably, its two-year 
election clause), the N.L.F. has thus far left 
Geneva out of its program, preferring a flex-
ible formula of eventual reunification in ne-
gotiated stages. 
- It is easy to dismiss those differences as be-
ing mere camouflage (after all, some people 
believe that the Sino-Soviet split is nothing 
but a grand deception foisted on the easily-
fooled West) and to believe the N.L.F. is in-
deed nothing but "a contrived political 
mechanism with no indigenuous roots," as 
Carver avers. But in that case, the 220,000 
Viet Cong who fight side-by-side with 50,-
000 PAVN regulars, and who over the past 
three years are said to have suffered almost 
100,000 dead and 182,000 wounded, fight 
rather well for what must be a vast mass of 
remote-controlled and force-drafted recruits. 
Otherwise, desertion would be just as easy 
on the Viet Cong side as it is on the ARVN 
side, but thus far the V.C. desertion rate 
simply seems to keep pace with the increase 
of manpower on the Communist side. ? 
That leaves, lastly, the argument of "face-
lessness": the N.L.F. leaders are men of little 
stature in their own society; they are un-
knowns. But four years ago only a few Viet-
namese military men knew who General Ky 
was, and no one thought of him even two 
years ago as being of presidential timber. 
Clandestineness is not attractive to the sort 
of men who are national figures: aside from 
Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito, it takes real ex-
pertise to recall the names of European 
resistance leaders. In any case, N.L.F. propa-
ganda has seen to it that its leaders should 
not remain anonymous: at least forty senior 
leaders' biographies have been published, 
along with their photos.4 Their background 
shows the normal social background of Viet-
namese leadership in general, from medical 
doctors and pharmacists, to lawyers and even 
army officers (though the sprinkling of Mon-
tagnards and women is more typical of the 
likewise classic "united front" picture). And 
they have one remarkable common charac-
teristic which thus far no Saigon government 
has been able to match: they are all from 
south of the seventeenth parallel. 
None of the foregoing justifies Hanoi's 
claim that the N.L.F. should be the "sole 
legitimate voice of the South Vietnamese peo-
ple." But nothing justifies the opposite 
claim either, to the effect that without 
Hanoi's full support, the N.L.F. would dis-
appear into thin air like a desert mirage. 
There can indeed be no quarrel with Carver's 
statement that "the Viet Cong organization 
is unquestionably a major factor in the 
South Vietnamese political scene." In that 
case, however, it must be treated as what it 
is?a political force in South Viet Nam which 
cannot be simply blasted off the surface of 
the earth with B-52 saturation raids, or 
told to pack up and go into exile to North 
Viet Nam. 
There is one further consideration which 
argues against the likelihood of Hanoi being 
able (assuming it were willing, and it does 
not seem to be) to turn off the southern 
guerrilla movement like a water tap: Hanoi 
has, since March 1946, made four separate 
deals with the West at the expense of the 
South Vietnamese. The French-Vietnamese 
accords of March 6, 1946, provided for a Viet-
namese "free state with its own government, 
armed forces and foreign relations" but left 
South Viet Nam proper (i.e., Cochin China) 
under French control and, as it turned out, 
severe anti-Viet Minh repression. The 
French-Vietnamese modus vivendi signed by 
Ho Chi Minh in Paris, September 14, 1948, 
further confirmed this seeming "abandon-
ment" of the South. In the Geneva Accords 
of July 1954, it was South Viet Nam which 
was left to the tender mercies of the Diem 
regime for at least two years, and we have 
Nguyen Huu Tho's own word in an inter-
view with Wilfred Burohett to the effect 
that "there were mixed feelings about the 
two-years' delay over reunification." And 
when neither Hanoi nor Peking (nor the So-
viet Union) made strong representations 
against dropping elections in 1956, it must 
have become obvious to even the most ob-
tuse pro-Hanoi elments south of the seven-
teenth parallel that the North Vietnamese 
Communists are somewhat unreliable allies. 
The Inner City School 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. MARTHA W. GRIFFITHS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 29, 1966 
Mrs. GRIFFITHS. Mr. Speaker, in 
four different places in today's RECORD 
I am inserting an account of a Detroit 
Free Press reporter's experiences, as an 
English teacher, in a Detroit inner city 
school, along with his recommendations. 
In my judgment, Mr. Jim Treloar brings 
sensitive insight to bear on one of Amer-
ica's great problems. 
One of the articles follows: 
THE INNER CITY CLASSROOM?A REPORTER'S 
EDUCATION 
(By Jim Treloar) 
Miss Kenneth Schaal, the head of the 
English department, led the way downstairs 
to Room 127, the click of her heels running 
two steps ahead in the pre-school quiet. 
The room I was to teach in at Jefferson 
Intermediate School is on the first floor, next 
to the stairwell. She opened the door and 
turned on the lights. 
There was a wad of gum stuck on -the 
blackboard. In one corner, paint flaked off 
the ceiling. Later, students would sit very 
still and watch the pieces drift down and 
land on their shoulders and in their hair, 
artificial dandruff. 
Last year's paper and chalk scented the air. 
The only splash of color came from sheets 
of yellow paper stapled across the top of the 
blackboard, the edges curling with age. 
I don't know how old the desks were, but 
there must have been two generations of 
initials etched into the unvarnished tops. 
Each desk had a hole for an inkwell, and 
those were going out of date when I was in 
school. 
There's a dark little courtyard just outside 
the window, with iron gratings everywhere. 
In the middle sat a cement something where 
trash was thrown. 
Miss Schaal saw me looking out the 
window. "We had lovely curtains to cover 
the window, but the last teacher in this room 
took them. She only lasted five months." 
It had been one of those pencil-sharp, 
eraser-clean fall days when I entered the De-
troit Public Schools' placement office on 
Woodward Avenue-and met Mrs. Julie Strawn. 
I asked her for a job teaching American 
History in high school, because that's where 
my interest and competence lay. History is 
my graduate major, and my teaching experi-
ence had been in a country high school. 
What I got was a job teaching English and 
social studies in junior high school. I told 
Mrs. Strawn that I had only the most mini-
- mum class time for an undergraduate minor

A5020 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? APPENDIX September 29 1966 
Briskly, Mrs. Strawn explained: "We re-
quire our high school teachers to have a 
master's degree." I was two or three classes 
short of my master's, so I settled for a job in 
which I didn't feel competent. 
(The fact is that only 66.28 percent of 
Detroit's high school teachers have master's 
degrees.) 
In college, you study to be either a "second-
err' or an "elementary" teacher. Junior 
- high schools are lumped with high schools 
' and called "secondary." 
But in a school like Jefferson, elementary 
teaching skills are needed. You don't toss 
American literature at children who still 
don't know how to read. I'd never taken a 
course in elenaentary education and had no 
idea how to teach a child to read, 
The same sort of thing happens to other 
teachers. One, who earned a Phi Beta Kappa 
key while majoring in biology, applied for a 
junior high science position. 
"No," she was told. "You haven't had 
physics." 
She was offered a job teaching mathe-
matics instead. 
"But I haven't had a math course since 
high school!" she protested. The placement 
office explained that they badly needed math 
teachers. A science opening was "discovered" 
only when the teacher refused to take any 
other job. 
Early next morning, I arrived at Jefferson 
School, built in 1922 at the corner of Selden 
and Fourth on Detroit's near West Side, and 
preSented myself to Miss Schaal, my depart-
ment head. 
I found her in a cramped little office, blow-
ing dust off an armful of books. She sized 
me up in one quick glance and found me 
wanting. 
Miss Schaal is pushing retirement. Her 
hair which looks like bleached straw, was 
already disheveled by work, and it wasn't 
8:30 yet. 
Her face is dried by years of chalk dust, 
but those blue eyes crackled. I thought: 
"Here's a gal who knows how to teach." My 
first impression was just as accurate as hers. 
After she introduced me to Room 127, I 
asked her if the students already had their 
textbooks. 
"The seventh and eighth graders don't 
get textbooks," she said. 
"When I get them to you, the books are 
to be kept in the room. You pass them out 
when you need them, and you collect them 
at the end of the hour. If the children took 
books home, we'd never get them back. 
"The ninth graders will get English texts, 
but they'll have to sign out for them. We 
try to push homework on the ninth:graders, 
but don't bank on it ever getting done. 
"And watch that they don't write in the 
books!" She grabbed a book at random, 
opened the cover and triumphantly displayed 
the most common two-word obscenity in the 
English language. 
"If the children start complaining about 
the condition of the books, just take them 
away," she said. "One cla.ss complained 
about how badly marked up their spellers 
were last year, so we just took them away. 
"You've got to be careful. These kids 
can demonstrate. You probably heard what 
happened at Northern High school last year. 
Who dp these kids think mark the books up 
anyhow, huh?" 
The textbooks?for classroom use only?
kept dribbing in all the time I was at Jef-
ferson. 
It was a week before the ninth graders got 
their English texts. When I left at the 
end of seven days, there were still no litera-
ture books. 
I found that I'd have to share the seventh 
grade geography and eighth grade history 
books with the teaclApepyreVed? F 
? But the children at jerferson la 
'even more basic than textbooks. 
When I inspected the boys' lavatory, there 
was no soap, no towels?not ,eve oilt paper-
Billy Stanhouse, the teacher across the 
hall, told me: "If we supplied the lavatories, 
they'd rip the fixtures oft the walls and 
throw the paper all around." 
I didn't see any teacher's copies of the 
text books I'd be using and asked Mrs. Schaal 
where they were. 
"We expect our teachers to be able to 
handle the children for two or. three days 
without having to use texts," she said. 
When I persisted, she told Me: "If we 
gave them out right away, some teachers 
would take them home and never come back, 
Some of our teachers don't last very long. 
Besides, I have a full schedule of classes 
myself, and I don't have time to cart books 
around!" - 
She careened out the door muttering some-
thing over her shoulder. 
But, she was back in five minutes with 
my copies of the texts. She's just as tough 
with her teachers as she is with her stu-
dents; but she always came through for me. 
I suspect she never disappointed her students 
either. 
When that was straightened out, Miss 
Schaal began ticking off the things I'd be 
responsible for. 
"Each teacher is allowed only $5 for class-
room supplies each year," she said. "But 
If you're not here in May to fill out the forms 
for the next year, you're just out of luck. 
"Keep your blackboards clean. The jani-
tors don't have time to wash them. We'll 
give you a basin, but you'll have to buy 
your own sponge. Don't get a plastic one. 
"If you need mimeograph paper, there's 
sone in the office. We're not supposed to 
give you any, but you can use what's there. 
After that's gone, you'll have to buy your 
own. 
"You'll need a lesson-plan book. You can 
buy one at the book store." 
The $27.50 a day I was getting for this job 
began to shrink. The two years I'd taught at 
Powlerville Community Schools, everything 
had been supplied; the janitors kept the 
rooms spotless; and if you wanted something 
mimeographed you whistled for an office girl. 
Teachers were supposed to concentrate on 
teaching. 
But within a week a sponge appeared, and 
a day later I found a lesson-plan book in my 
locker. I don't know where she rustled up 
the sponge, but I knew Miss Schaal had paid 
for the book herself. 
I also found out about those curtains that 
had been swiped from my room. Miss Schaal 
made them last year from material she 
bought. Jefferson School has no money for 
such niceties. 
Jefferson's teachers object to many of the 
textbooks they use. 
The books speak in terms the inner city 
child doesn't understand. The street scenes 
described in their English books aren't what 
they see. The problems they hear about in 
social studies aren't the social problems that 
are important to' them. 
Sally Johnson, who teaches history and has 
a way of putting things, announced at lunch 
one day: "The stuff I have to give these kids 
is just so much garp!" 
Miss Schaal told me there were special ma-
terials written for the inner city youngsters, 
but that she hadn't the money to buy them. 
"I was .supposed to have $1,000 for extra 
materials this year," she said, "but the social 
studies people overspent their budget. 
Progress in the Other War 
EXTENSION OF REMARXS 
OF 
HON. DANTE B. FASCELL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 29, 1966 
Mr. FASCELL. Mr. Speaker, our pre-
odcupation with the military effort 
should not divert our interest from what 
we know as "the other war" in South 
Vietnam.. 
President Johnson has made public a 
report ori what is being done to improve 
the life of the people in the villages and 
hamlets of that testing ground of free-
dom. 
I believe it warrants study by all of us 
who recognize the importance to man-
kind of the conflict in South Vietnam. 
Parts of the report by Robert W. 
Komer of the President's staff are sum-
med up by the Washington Post in an 
editorial which discusses the progress 
made in education, transportation, hous-
ing, health and everyday living for the 
- South Vietnamese. 
The Post comments that the con-
structive task of pacification is an es-
sential counterpart of our military en-
deavor. It states that these civil pro-
grams go nicely with the new hopes jus-
tified by the South Vietnamese elections. 
The record to date, declares the Post, 
is one in which the United States can 
take satisfaction before the world. 
The complete editorial is as follows,: 
"When the school board auditors caught it, 
they took away my $1,000 to help balance the 
books, and that was the end of that." 
I took another look at the first letter the 
school board wrote me when I applied for 
this job. 
e Inhiadakig63? t":slockAituitM04 
ars have developed a deep loyalty to the 
who support us so well." 
THE OTHEit WAR 
Since 1957 more than 18,000 South Viet-
namese civilian officials?village headmen, 
schoolteachers, technicians?have been mur-
dered or kidnaped by the Communists. In 
the week of Sept. 4-10 this year, more than 
four times as many South Vietnamese as 
Americans were killed by enemy action. 
These figures ought to be understood more 
widely in Europe. At a time when our pre-
occupations are understandably with Amer-
ican casualties and military efforts, they give 
extra emphasis to a report just submitted 
to the President on "the other war" in Viet-
nam?the efforts to assist the South Viet-
namese civilian society that has been so 
cruelly ravaged. 
In this report Special Assistant Robert W. 
Korner relates an impressive chronicle of 
what is being done to build schoolrooms, dis-
pensaries and roads, to house refugees, to 
improve and expand agricultural production, 
to broaden the industrial base and provide 
more electric power, to increase port facil-
ities, to check inflation, through monetary 
reform and American imports. Some 6900 
hamlet school classrooms have been built, 
for example, 1600 of them in 1966 alone. 
Some 280,000 refugees were resettled and 
460,000 given temporary shelter within the 
last year. 
No less significant are the accomplish-
ments in internal security, although the fig-
ures are less dramatic. It often has been 
assumed, erroneously, that most of the peo-
ple of South Vietnam are under Vietcong 
domination. In point of fact, by August 31 
of this year some 55 per cent of the popula-
tion was in "secure" areas. Another 21 per 
cent lived in areas that fluctuated between 
South Vietnamese and Vietcong control, 
aidow4ibbilittlycv were in parts of the 
tile Vietcong. In the 
year ending June 30 nearly 1000 additional 
hamlets had been made secure and In 1906

two-and-a-half hours instead of the present 
six. A Monte Carlo gambler could fly to 
Las Vegas to try his luck in a different set-
ting in three hours instead of seven. 
Along the way the sonic boom would leave 
a trail of broken windows, awakened and 
crying babies and falling plaster that Wis-
consin "survivors" of the B-68 supersonic 
bomber runs of a few years ago can vividly 
recall. 
At that time my office was deluged with 
complaints. Wisconsinites put up with this 
resounding nuisance out of patriotism. But 
you could hardly be expected to do the same 
for the pleasure-loving jet-set. 
STIVIINGTON JOINS FIGHT 
The unsolved technical problems are so 
great and so expensive to solve that Senator 
STUART SYMINGTON (D.-Mo.), a former Sec-
retary of the Air Force and a leading cham-
pion of American aviation, helped me lead 
the fight for my amendment before the 
Senate. 
The supersonic transport not only would 
have no military value but would be used 
strictly for private commercial purposes. 
For the federal government to provide this 
kind of massive subsidy to a private indus-
try is virtually unprecedented. 
WHY FORCE ADDITIONAL HALF BILLION ON 
DEFENSE? 
I also fought and voted to cut defense 
appropriations back by half a billion dollars 
to the level requested by the President and 
the Defense Department. 
Y017R COST OF LIVING AT STAKE 
Every one of these amendments was zeroed 
in to cut back government spending in the 
most inflationary part of the economy. 
American business has sharply increased 
Its spending for plant and equipment, break-
ing all records. Competitive government 
spending in this area where manpoWer and 
materials are especially in short supply is 
sure to drive prices up. 
And because the government with its defi-
cit has to borrow money to pay for these 
additional expenditures, spending also drives 
interest rates up as government demand for 
money bids up the price of money; i.e., 
interest. 
Our fight helped to make Senators more 
conscious of the fact that government spend-
ing drives up your cost of living. 
We aren't giving up. We intend to carry 
on this fight! 
SELECTION OF STEPHEN N. SHUL-
MAN LAUDED 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, a few days 
ago the Senate confirmed the President's 
nomination of Stephen N. Shulman as 
Chairman of the Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission. 
In my judgment, the President selected 
one of the Government's most capable 
young executives to serve in this key po-
sition. It will be my pleasure to work 
closely with him, as the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Employment, Man-
power, and Poverty, before which sub-
committee come legislative matters deal-
ing with equal employment opportunity. 
I ask unanimous consent that Mr. 
Shulman's extensive scholastic, business, 
legal, and Government service accom-
plishments?which in my judgment in-
? dicate that the Commission, under his 
direction, should have a bright future?
may be printed in the RECORD, in the 
form of a biographical sketch. 
There being no objection, the bio-
graphical sketch was ordered to be print-
ed in the RECORD, as follows:

MAN, EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY 
COMMISSION 
Shulman received an A.B. degree from Har-
vard University in 1954. He then did indus-
trial and labor relations work for Bendix 
Aviation Corporation, first at the Fries In-
strument Division in Towson, Maryland, and 
later at the Utica Division in Utica, New 
York. 
He received an LL. B. degree, cum lauds, 
from Yale University in 1958. At Yale, he 
was Editor-in-Chief of the Yale Law Jour-
nal and a member of the Order of the Coif 
honorary society. 
Shulman was Law Clerk to Mr. Justice Har-
lan, Supreme Court of the United States, for 
the October Term, 1958. 
He was associated with the law firm of 
Covington & Burling in the District of Co-
lumbia until May 1960, when he became As-
sistant United States Attorney for the Dis-
trict. 
In February 1961, Shulman was appointed 
Executive Assistant to the Secretary of Labor 
by then Secretary Arthur J. Goldberg. While 
In that post, he served for a time as Acting 
Executive Vice Chairman of the President's 
Committee on Equal Employment Opportu-
nity. In November 1962, he was appointed 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense in 
charge of Civilian Personnel and Industrial 
Relations by Defense Secretary Robert S. 
McNamara. In August 1964, Secretary Mc-
Namara added Civil Rights to Shulman's re-
sponsibilities. 
On September 1, 1965, Shulman took office 
as General Counsel of the Air Force. He has 
served, in 1959, as Visiting Assistant Pro-
fessor of Law at the University of Michigan 
and, in 1965, as Visiting Professor of Man-
agement at the University of Oklahoma. In 
May 1966, Shulman was awarded the William 
A. Jump Memorial Foundation Award for 
exemplary service in public administration 
in the Departments of Labor and Defense. 
He subsequently became a member of the 
Board of Trustees of the Foundation. 
On August 30, 1966, President Johnson 
nominated Shulman as Chairman of the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

THE ELECTION IN VIETNAM 
Mr. CLARK, Mr. President, there has 
been a great deal of undue optimism, in 
my judgment, over the long-range results 
of the recent election in Vietnam. 
I do not deny that the turnout at the 
election was highly gratifying, nor do I 
deny that a group of quite able Viet-
namese citizens appear to have been 
selected to draft a new constitution for 
that unhappy country. But I suspect 
that many of the paeans of praise and 
joy and optimism which have been 
forthcoming from commentators and 
others are quite unjustified, in that they 
go much too far in their interpretation 
of what this election means. 
Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent 
that a column written by Clayton 
Fritchey entitled "Why the Joy Over Viet 
Election?" may be printed in the RECORD 
at this point in my remarks. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
From the Washington (D.C.), Evening Star,, 
Sept. 19, 19661 
WYLY THE JOT OVER VIET ELECTION? 
(By Clayton Fritchey) 
The post-election jag in South Viet Nam 
goes on unabated, and the intoxication of 
Washington offici4iclom almost equals that 
of the Saigon generals, who are described as 
'almost delirious with joy." 
Premier Kg and the other leaders of the 
military dictatorship are hailing the elec-
tion as a "triumph for democracy," a 
-smash'ng victory" for the government, and 
testimonial to the ruling junta. 
The President Of the U.S. has added his 
own beaming benediction: "The large turn-
out," he said, "is to me a vote of confidence." 
Confidence in what? 
If the America people swallow the new 
fCy-Johnson line, they will again end up dis-
appointed and disillusioned, lust as they 
have in the past when the truth ultimately 
deflated previous propaganda fantasies. 
It is Isetter to face up to the truth at once, 
and the truth is that the Viet Nam election 
(if it can honestly be called that) is by no 
stretch of the imagination a testimonial to 
Gen. Ky's Military government.' 
No one yet knows what the election results 
really mean, or even portend, so Ky and his 
U.S. supporters simply proclaim that the 
mere size of the turnout (also in dispute) 
is einn self an endorsement of the govern-
mt. 
Yet the one, indisputable fact seems to be 
that if the-irate is a testimonial to anything 
at all, it is to the people's deep desire to have 
an elected, civilian government, and not a 
self-imposerl military one, such as Ky pres-
ently heads up. 
Just hove Ithat constitutes a ringing af-
firmation of the_Ky junta is something that 
baffles disinterested observers, most of whom 
see the election as a strong expression of 
popular will for replacing the generals with 
a constitutional, representative government. 
If that is so, why are the generals so elated? 
They are jubilant because they think they 
have succeeded (temporarily at least) in ac-
quiring the protective coloring of a demo-
cratic eleCtion, without running any risks 
to their own future. They think they have 
fixed it so that they are safe no matter what 
happens. And they are probably right in this 
estimate. --
As everyone knows, the only reason the 
elections were held iii the first place is that 
the Buddhists forced Ky to call them. Last 
spring, it twit_ Weeks of demonstrations, 
violence, and fiery immolations to exact an 
electoral promise from the junta. The Bud-
dhists have never been pro-Communist or 
pro-Viet Gong. They simply fought for elec-
tions and representative government until 
the militarists grudgingly gave in. 
No doubt the hopes of many unsophis-
ticated Vietnamese, especially in the prov-
inces, have been momentarily raised by the 
joy of just casting a ballot; and no doubt 
many Americans would like to believe Pre-
mier Ky's statement that the election means 
"a brighter, snore beautiful future" for his 
nation. - 
The only fly in this unctuous ointment, is 
that in the little more than 10 years of South 
Viet Nasn's history there have been a dozen 
military governments, and none of these re-
gimes, including Ky's, has yet been able to 
find a place for the people in the country's 
"beautiful _future,"

If they are going to permit the kind of 
international expansion they need and 
the liquidity that they must have, they 
will see the need to get together and 
negotiate. 
None of us likes the kind of painful 
Policies that are necessary in the judg-
ment of many people to get our pay-
ments in balance. 
Mr. CLARK. The Senator is correct. 
Mr. PROXMIRE. That is the reason 
why Secretary Fowler has not been mak-
ing the kind of progress that he wants 
to make. 
Mr. CLARK. The Senator is correct. 
I point out that, in my judgment, the 
balance-of-payments situation is getting 
worse and not better. 
The annual rate of the deficit during 
the second quarter was around $1.6 bil-
lion. All early indications are that the 
third quarter will be much worse. 
We have no feasible method left by 
which to bring our balance of payments 
in balance except two, one of which I 
would strenuously object to. One in-
volves cutting back on our domestic 
prosperity by rigorous methods of aus-
terity accompanied by restrictions on in-
ternational trade. The other involves 
stopping the war in Vietnam and bring-
ing the troops home from Europe. If we 
could eliminate those costs, we would go 
two-thirds of the way toward eliminat-
ing our balance-of-payments difficulty. 
Mr. PROXMIRE. I am afraid that I 
left the situation dangling when I im-
plied that the only answer is to correct 
our balance-of-payments difficulty. 
I do think that the Senator from New 
York brings in a very wholesome thought 
when he implies that we should not be so 
Paralyzed and overwhelmingly concerned 
about the loss of gold. 
The fact is that if we did refuse to buy 
gold at $35 an ounce, the value of gold, 
In my Judgment, would diminish quite 
rapidly. That is very controversial and 
the economists do not all agree on the 
matter. We need much greater discus-
sion on this. 
We do not have to make a 
Judgment that we would otherwise not 
make with regard to military policy, 
foreign policy, and so forth in order to 
solve this very difficult world monetary 
situation. 
Mr. JAV1TS. The essential difference 
between the Senator and myself is not a 
critical matter. It is not a matter of 
criticizing Secretary Fowler. He is prob-
ably following the instructions of the 
administration. 
Mr. CLARK. Reluctantly. 
Mr. JAV1TS. The Senator is correct, 
and he is doing so, in my Judgment, to 
the best of his ability. I never criticize 
any President or Cabinet officer for doing 
his best. 
In the famous Tiox investigation, al-
though I disagreed with the administra-
tion, I was its best defender. 
I do not want to be in a position of 
criticizing Secretary Fowler, for whom I 
have a wholesome affection. 
We must take this matter out of the 
Private room in which it is being consid-
ered. We must expose it to the light of

inforination which indicated that in his

In the Washington Post, on Septem-

THE COST Or WAR AND THE ECONOMY 
(By Marquis Childs) 
The war in Vietnam is now costing $2.7 
billion a month. Rather than a random fig-
ure picked out of the air, this is a careful 
calculation accepted at the highest level of 
Government concerned with taxes and debt 
and the storm cloud of threatened inflation 
hovering over the economy. 
What is more, It is believed that President 
Johnson is now convinced he cannot wait 
until January to ask Congress for an increase 
in personal and corporate income taxes. Nor 
will Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNa-
mara delay until after the first of the year his 
long-anticipated, request for the added money 
to finance the war. This will be in the range 
of $11 to $14 billion. 
These stark facts of life cannot be con-
cealed by rhetoric. For the past six months 
the President, as so many of his predecessors 
before him in troubled times, has been im-
prisoned on the rack between the pulls- of 
policy and politics. He has felt he had to 
postpone the bitter medicine, and one conse-
quence is an aura of mistrust obscuring that 
brief passage on Pennsylvania Avenue be-
tween the Capitol and the White House. 
Chairman Wri,sna. D. Mrr.r.s of the tax-
writing Ways and Means Committee in the 
House called some time ago for a forthright 
statement of what the war was costing, how 
much economy could be expected in domestic 
programs and where this came out in rela-
tion to inflation and a tax increase, He found 
the reply sent by the Treasury vague and 
ambiguous. 
With Mrf.r..s feeling he had been given a 
runaround, this did not Improve the at-
mosphere. 
McNarnara's tactic in muffling the mount-
ing cost of the war is also the source of wide-
spread grumbling. In the current budget 
Vietnam spending is based on the assump-
tion the war will begin to phase out in June 
and the American commitment curtailed. 
The reaSon; the Secretary explains, is to pre-
vent the services from overspending. He 
cites the waste of some $20 billion in materiel 
at the end of the Korean War as a horrible 
exaMple of what he means to avoid. 
But the rapid escalation in the cost of the 
war has created' a growing sehse of the un-
reality of the Administration's fiscal stance. 
During 1968 the cost has gone from an esti-
mated $1.5 billion to $2 billion to the cur-
rent $2.7 billion a month. With virtually 
none of this contained in the budget the 
result is a never-never land in which in-
calculable forces threaten stability. 
For most of -us the money supply and in-
terest rates are arcane matters as remote as 
the question of whether there is life on Mars. 
But what has been happening in recent 
months bring it down to the pinch of daily 
life, as anyone discovers traveling around the 
country. A loan for a year in college is hard 
to come by. The interest rate has sky-
rocketed on mortgages on old and new dwell-
ings and the money is not there. The real 
estate market is slowing to a jog trot. 
Whether this is the way to cure inflation 
is, to say the least, questionable, as the 
President has been told by those arguing for 
the simple method of a -tax increase. The 
debate has been going on since last Decem-
ber when the Federal Reserve Board raised 
the re-discount rate despite the fervent plea 
of the President. Don't apply the brake on 
the money supply, the President argued, un-
til you see our budget for next year. 
As a sop to the chorus demanding action 
to damp down the rise in prices and interest 
rates, the President called for canceling the 
'7 percent investment credit. That undoubt-
edly fed the boom. The effect of cancella-
tion will, however, hardly be felt before six 
months or more have passed. With the 
crucial date of Nov. 8 in the offing it was a 
gesture calculated to offend the minimum 
number of voters who could in any event 
be counted as already alienated from the 
Great Society. 
When he signed the interest rate bill the 
President did not disclose what his aides 
describe as a kind of pact of peace with the 
Federal Reserve Board. The Fed, using the 
authority under the measure, will impose 
a ceiling on long-term certificates of deposit, 
dropping the interest rate perhaps half of 
one percent from its present level. 
Effective as this will be, in a limited sense, 
it is not, in the view of those profoundly 
concerned with the direction of the economy, 
a substitute for a tax increase to soak up 
surplus money. Nor, sad as it must seem to 
the President, are his appeals for voluntary 
cooperation from the bankers, trade unions, 
Industry any more effective in throttling 
down the racing engine of prosperity. 
INFORMATION SERVICES CEN 
OPENED BY SMITH KLINE 84 
FRENCH LABORATORIES 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I was 
happy, indeed, to receive a copy of a 
release issued by' Smith Kline 8.5 French 
Laboratories, a respected and very pros-
perous drug company, which has its main 
office at 1500 Spring Garden Street in 
Philadelphia. 
This release indicates that the com-
pany, at its own expense, is setting up an 
office where people in the Spring Garden 
area, which is part of our north central 
Philadelphia poverty area, can find out 
where they can get help when they need 
It. This office has already been officially 
opened, and I believe it to be the first 
service of its kind to be operated by a 
business concern. 
I want to congratulate the company 
and all its executives, particularly F. 
Markoe Rivinus, its president, for this 
splendid action in the public service. 
I ask unanimous consent that a copy 
of the press release may be printed in 
the RECORD at this point in my remarks. 
There being no objection, the press re-
23391 
lease was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
An office where people in the Spring Gar-
den area can find out where they can get 
help when they need it will be opened offi-
cially today (September 23) at 1'720 Mount 
Vernon Street. 
It will be known as the Information Serv-
ices Center and will be managed and sup-
ported by Smith Kline & French Labora-
tories, the pharmaceutical firm located near-
by at 1500 Spring Garden Street. 
It will be the first service of its kind to be 
operated by a business firm. 
F. Markoe Rivinus, Smith Kline & French 
President, said the center was established to 
meet a serious need in the area, 
"The center will be a bridge between the 
people of the Spring Garden neighborhood 
and government and social services. Our 
experience in this neighborhood has shown 
that the people do not know what services 
are available and do not know how to avail 
themselves of the services. Our purpose is to 
help fill this gap." 
The center principally will serve the area 
bounded by Spring Garden Street, Broad 
Street, Fairmount Avenue and Twenty-first 
Street. The company estimates the area has 
a population of about 24,000. 
The center has a staff of two and a secre-
tary-receptionist. It will be open from 8:30 
a.m. until 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
Staff members are Carver A. Portlock and 
Tom Perry. Portlock formerly was Alumni 
Director of Bethune-Cookman College in 
Daytona Beach, Florida. Perry, who speaks 
Spanish, formerly was with the Human Re-
lations Commission here. Ana Vazquez is 
the secretary-receptionist. 
The center has been operating unofficially 
since April at the Mount Vernon Street ad-
dress, which formerly was a church building. 
Portlock joined Smith Kline & French short-
ly afterward. Through the assistance of 
Mayor James H. J. Tate's office he received 
an orientation to the services available in 
the city government. 
Among the problems handled by the center 
since April were finding jobs for adults and 
teen-agers; sending people to agencies which 
can supply food and clothing; trying to rem-
edy housing problems, including a large 
number of requests for better housing; 
mediating debt problems; finding interpre-
ters; giving advice on how to apply for such 
jobs as police officer and practical nurse; 
helping to get children enrolled in day camps, 
and so on. 
Mr. CLARK. I hope that this action 
by this fine, public-spirited firm, Smith 
Kline Sr French, may be emulated by 
many others of our great industrial cor-
poratio s, not only in Pennsylvania, but 
also ac toss the Nation.

Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, I turn

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 7? SENATE September 29, 1966 
States are aware, as indeed every delegation 
must be, of the great responsibilities which 
all of us share who work in this world organi-
zation for peace. 
No one, fain sure, feels these responsibili-
ties more keenly than our Secretary General, 
U Thant. In the past five years he has filled 
with distinction and effectiveness what is 
perhaps the most difficult office in the world. 
We know how much selfless dedication and 
energy have been exacted from him on behalf 
of the world community. We can well un-
derstand how the burdens of his office led 
him to hi a decision not to offer himself for 
a second term as Secretary General. 
But the United Nations needs him. It 
needs him as a person. It needs him as a 
Secretary General who conceives his office in 
the full spirit of the Charter as an impor-
tant organ of the United Nations, endowed 
with the authority to act with initiative and 
effectiveness. The members, in all their di-
vereity and even discord, are united in their 
confidence in him. His departure at this 
Crucial time in world affairs, and in the life 
of the United Nations, would be a serious loss 
both to the organization itself and to the 
cause of peace among nations. We reiterate 
our earnest hope that he will heed the unan-
imous wishes of the membership and permit 
his tenure of office to be extended. His af-
firmative decision on this question would 
give us all new courage to deal with the many 
great problems on our agenda. 
The peoples of the world, Mr. President, 
expect the United Nations to resolve these 
problems. With all their troubles and as-
pirations they put great faith in this orga-
nization. They look to us not for pious 
words but for solid results?agreements 
reached, wars ended or prevented, treaties 
written, cooperative programs launched?re-
sults that will bring humanity a few steps, 
but giant steps, closer to the purposes of the 
Charter which are our common commitment. 
"secant USEFUL corrrarauTios" 
Realizing this, the United States has con-
sidered what it could say in this general de-
bate which would improve the prospects for 
such fruitful results in the present session. 
We concluded that, rather than attempt to 
review the many questions to which we at-
tach importance, we could make a more use-
ful contribution by concentrating on the 
serious dangers to peace now existing in 
Asia?particularly the war in Vietnam?and 
by treating this subject in a constructive and 
positive way. 
The conflict in Vietnam is first of all an 
Asian issue, whose tragedy and suffering fall 
most heavily on the peoples directly involved. 
But its repercussions are worldwide. It di-
verts much of the energies of many nations, 
my own included, from urgent and construc-
tive endeavors. It is, as the Secretary Gen-
eral said in his statement on September 1, "a 
source of grave concern and is bound to be 
a source of even greater anxiety, not only 
to the parties directly involved and to the 
major powers but also to other members of 
the organization." My Government remains 
determined to exercise every restraint to limit 
the war and to exert every effort to bring the 
conflict to the earliest possible end. 
The essential facts of the Vietnam conflict 
can be stated briefly. Vietnam today remains 
divided along the demarcation line agreed 
upon in Geneva in 1954. To the north and 
south of that line are North Vietnam and 
South Vietnam. Provisional though they 
may be, pending a decision on the peaceful 
reunification of Vietnam by the process of 
self-determination, they are nonetheless poli-
tical realities in the international community. 
The Geneva accord which established the 
demarcation line is so thorough in its pro-
hibition of the use of force that it forbids 
military interference of any sort by one side 
In the affairs of the other; it even forbids 
civilians to cross the demilitarized zone. In 
1962 military infiltration through Laos was 
also forbidden. Yet despite these provisions, 
South Vietnam is Under an attack, already 
several years old, by forces directed and sup-
plied from the North, and reinforced by regu-
lar units?currently some 17 identified regi-
ments?of the North Vietnamese Army. The 
manifest purpose of this attack is to force 
upon the people of South Vietnam a system 
which they have not chosen by any peaceful 
process. 
Let it be noted that this action by North 
Vietnam contravenes not only the United 
Nations Charter but also the terms of Gen-
eral Assembly resolution 2131 (XX), adopted 
unanimously only last December and entitled 
"Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Inter-
vention in the Domestic Affairs of States and 
the Protection of their Independence and 
Sovereignty." 
That resolution declares, among other 
things, that "no state has the right to inter-
vene, directly or indirectly, for any reason 
whatever, in the internal or external affairs 
of any other state." It further declares that 
"no state shall organize, assist, foment, fin-
ance, incite or tolerate subversive, terrorist or 
armed activities directed toward the violent 
overthrow of another state, or interfere in 
civil strife in another state." It would be 
hard to write a more concise description of 
what North Vietnam is doing, and has been 
doing for years, in South Vietnam. 
Certainly the prohibition of the use of 
force and subversion?both by this resolu-
tion and by the Charter itself?must apply 
with full vigor to international demarcation 
lines that have been established by solemn 
international agreements. This is true not 
only in Vietnam but in all the divided States, 
where the recourse to force between the di-
vided parts can have far-reaching conse-
quences. Furthermore solemn international 
agreements, specifically the Geneva accords, 
explicitly prohibit recourse to force as a 
means of reunifying that country. 
Mr. President, it is because of the attempt 
to upset by violence the situation in Viet-
nam, and its far-reaching implications else-
where, that the United States and other 
countries have responded to appeals from 
South Vietnam for military assistance. 
Our aims in giving this assistance are 
strictly limited. 
We are not engaged in a "holy war" 
against Communism. 
We do not seek to establish an American 
empire or a "sphere of influence" in Asia. 
We seek no permanent military bases, no 
permanent establishment of troops, no per-
manent alliances, no permanent American 
"presence" of any kind in South Vietnam. 
We do not seek to impose a policy of align-
ment on South Vietnam. 
We do not seek the overthrow of the Gov-
ernment of North Vietnam. 
We do not seek to do any injury to main-
land China nor to threaten any of its legiti-
mate interests. 
POLITICAL SOLUTION SOUGHT 
We do not ask of North Vietnam an un-
conditional surrender or indeed the surren-
der of anything that belongs to it; nor do we 
seek to exclude any segment of the South 
Vietnamese people from peaceful participa-
tion in their country's future. 
Let me say affirmatively and succinctly 
what our aims are. 
We want a political solution, not a mili-
tary solution, to this conflict. By the same 
token, we reject the idea that North Viet-
nam has a right to impose a military solu-
tion. 
We seek to assure for the people of South 
Vietnam the same right of self-determina-
tion?to decide their own political destiny, 
free of force--that the United Nations Char-
ter affirms for all. 
And we believe that reunification of Viet-
nam should be decided upon through a free 
choice by the peoples of both the North and 
South without outside interference, the re-
sults of which choice we are fully prepared 
to support. 
These, then, are our affirmative aims. We 
are well aware of the stated position of Hanoi 
on these issues. But no differences can be 
resolved without contact, discussions or ne-
gotiations. For our part, we have long been 
and remain today ready to negotiate without 
any prior conditions. 
We are prepared to discuss Hanoi's four 
points together with any points which other 
parties may wish to raise. We are ready to 
negotiate a settlement based on a strict ob-
servance of the 1954 and 1962 Geneva agree-
ments, which observance was called for in 
the communiqu?f the recent meeting of the 
Warsaw Pact countries in Bucharest. And 
we will support a reconvening of the Geneva 
conference, or an Asian conference, or any 
other generally acceptable forum. 
At the same time we have also soberly 
considered whether the lack of agreement an 
peace aims has been the sole barrier to the 
beginning of negotiations. We are aware 
that some perceive other obstacles, and I wish 
to make three proposals with respect to 
them: 
First, it is said that one obstacle is the 
United States bombing of North Vietnam. 
Let it be recalled that there was DA bombing 
of North Vietnam for five years during which 
there was steadily increasing infiltration 
from North Vietnam; during which there 
were no United States combat forces in Viet-
nam; and during which strenous efforts were 
being made to achieve a peaceful settlement. 
And let it further be recalled that tWice be-
fore wes have suspended our bombing, once 
for 37 days, without any reciprocal act of de-
escalation from the other side, and without 
any sign from them of a willingness to nego-
tiate. 
U.S. OFFERS "FIRST STEP" 
Nevertheless, let me say that, in this mat-
ter, the United States is wining once again to 
take the first sttep. We are prepared to order 
a cessation of all bombing of North Viet-
nam?the moment we are assured, privately 
or otherwise, that this step will be answered 
promptly by a corresponding and appropriate 
de-escalation on the other side. We there-
fore urge before this Assembly that the Gov-
ernment in Hanoi be asked the following 
question, to which we would be prepared to 
receive either a private or a public response: 
Would it in the interest of peace, and 
in response to a prior cessation by the United 
States of the bombing in North Vietnam, 
take corresponding and timely steps to re-
duce or bring to an end its own military 
activities against South Vietnam? 
Another obstacle is said to be North Viet-
nam's conviction or fear that the United 
States intends to establish a permanent mil-
itary presence in Vietnam. There is no basis 
for such a fear. The United States stands 
ready to withdraw its forces as others with-
draw theirs so that peace can be restored 
In South Vietnam, and favors international 
machinery?either of the United Nations or 
other machinery?to insure effective super-
vision of the withdrawal. We therefore urge 
that Hanoi be asked the following question 
also: 
Would North Vietnam be willing to agree 
to a time schedule for supervised, phased 
withdrawal from South Vietnam of all ex-
ternal forces?those of North Vietnam as 
well as those from the United States and 
other countries aiding South Vietnam? 
A further obstacle is said to be disagree-
ment over the place of the Vietcong in the 
negotiations. Some argue that, regardless 
of different views on who controls the Viet-
cong, it is a combatant force and, as such, 
should take part in the negotiations. 
Some time ago our view on this matter was 
stated by President Johnson, who made clear 
that, as far as we are concerned, this ques-
tion would not be "an insurmountable prob-
lem." We therefore invite the authorities in

September 29, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ?SENATE 
Hanoi to consider whether this obstacle to 
negotiation may not be more imaginary than 
real. 
Mr. President, we offer these proposals in 
the interest of peace in Southeast Asia. 
There may be other proposals. We have not 
been and are not now inflexible in our posi-
tion. But we do believe that, whatever ap-
proach finally succeeds, it will not be one 
which simply decries what Is happening in 
Vietnam and appeals to one side to stop 
while encouraging the other. Such a posi-
tion can only further delay the peace we 
all desire and fervently hope for. The only 
workable formula for a settlement will be 
one which is just to the basic interests of all 
who are involved. 
In this spirit we welcome discussion of this 
question either in the Security Council, 
where the United States itself has raised the 
matter, or here in the General Assembly, and 
we are fully prepared to take part in any 
such discussion. We earnestly solicit the 
further initative of any organ, including the 
Secretary General, or any member of the 
United Nations whose influence can help in 
this cause. Every member has a responsibil-
ity to exert its power and influence for peace; 
and the greater its power and influence, the 
greater is this responsibility. 
Now I turn to another problem, related 
In part to the first; the problem of how to 
foster a constructive relationship between the 
mainland of China, with its 700 million peo-
ple, and the outside world. The misdirection 
of so much of the energies of this vast, in-
dustrious and gifted people into xenophobic 
displays, such as the extraordinary, difficult 
to understand and alarming activities of the 
Red Guards; and the official policy and doc-
trine of promoting revolution and subversion 
throughout the world?these are among the 
most disturbing phenomena of our age. 
Surely, among the essentials of peace in 
Asia are "reconciliation between nations that 
now call themselves enemies" and, specifical-
ly, "a peaceful mainland China." 
Let me say categorically to this assembly 
that it is not the policy of the United States 
to isolate Communist China from the world. 
On the contrary, we have sought to limit 
the areas of hostility and to pave the way for 
the restoration of our historically friendly 
relations with the great people of China. 
Our efforts to this end have taken many 
forms. Since 1955, United States representa-
tives have held 131 bilateral diplomatic meet-
ings in Geneva, and later in Warsaw, with 
emissaries from Peking. 
We have sought without success to open 
numerous unofficial channels of communica-
tion with mainland China. 
We have made it crystal clear that we do 
not intend to attack, invade or attempt to 
overthrow the existing regime in Peking. 
And we have expressed our hope to see rep-
resentatives of Peking join us and others in 
meaningful negotiations on disarmament, a 
nuclear test ban and a ban on the further 
spread of nuclear weapons. 
But the international community cannot 
countenance Peking's doctrine and policy of 
Intervening by violence and subversion in 
other nations, whether under the guise of 
so-called wars of national liberation against 
independent countries or under any other 
guise. Such intervention can find no place 
in the United Nations Charter, nor in the 
resolutions of the General Assembly. Yet 
dozens of nations represented in this hall 
have had direct experience of these 1/legal 
activities. 
ISSUE OE RED CHINA 
It is in the light of these facts, and of our 
ardent desire for a better atmosphere, that 
the United States has 'carefully considered 
the issues arising from the absence of rep-
re,sentatives of Peking from the United Na-
tions. 
Two facts bear on this issue and on the 
attitude of my country toward any attempted 
solution. 
First, the Republic of China on Taiwan is 
a founding member of the United Nations 
and its rights are clear. The United States 
will vigorously oppose any effort to exclude 
the representative of the Republic of China 
from the United Nations in order to put rep-
resentatives of Communist China in their 
place. 
The second fact is that Communist China, 
unlike anyone else in the history of this 
organization, has put forward special and 
extraordinary terms for consenting to enter 
the United Nations. In addition to the ex-
pulsion of the Republic of China, there are 
also demands to transform and pervert this 
organization from its Charter purposes?
some of them put forward as recently as yes-
terday. 
What can be the cause of this attitude? 
We cannot be sure, but we do know that it 
comes from a leadership whose stated pro-
gram is to transform the world by violence. 
It comes from a leadership which openly 
proclaims it is opposed to any discussion of 
a peaceful settlement in Vietnam. 
It would almost seem that these leaders 
wish to isolate their country from a world?
and from a United Nations?that they can-
not transform and control. Indeed, they 
have already brought their country to a 
degree of isolation that is unique in the 
world today?an isolation not only from the 
United States and its allies, but from most 
of the nonaligned world and even from most 
of the Communist nations. Many, not only 
the United States, have sought improved re-
lations and have been rebuffed. 
At this moment in history, therefore, Mr. 
President, the basic question about the rela-
tion between Communist China and the 
United Nations is a question to which only 
the leaders in Peking can give the answer. 
And I put the question. Will they refrain 
from putting forward clearly unacceptable 
terms; and are they prepared to assume the 
obligations of the United Nations Charter, 
in particular the basic Charter obligation 
to refrain from the threat or use of force 
against the territorial integrity or political 
independence of any state? 
The world? . . . my Government?will 
listen most attentively for a helpful re-
sponse to these questions. We hope it will 
come soon?the sooner the better. Like 
many other members here, the United States 
has the friendliset historic feelings toward 
the great Chinese people, and looks forward 
to the occasion when they will once again 
enrich, rather than endanger, the fabric of 
the world community, and, in the spirit of 
the Charter, "practice tolerance, and live 
together in peace with one another as good 
neighbors." 
"GREAT AND THORNY ISSUES" 
Mr. President, I have dwelt on these great 
and thorny issues of Asia because they are 
of far more than regional importance. 
Progress toward their solution would visibly 
brighten the atmosphere of international 
relations all over the world. It would en-
able the United Nations to turn a new 
corner?to apply itself with renewed energy 
to the great tasks of reconciliation and peace-
ful construtcion which lies before us in every 
part of the globe. 
Surely peaceful construction is needed 
above all in the less developed areas. It is 
needed in Southeast Asia, today a region of 
conflict but also a region of vast undevel-
oped resources?where my country is pre-
pared to make a most substantial contribu-
tion to the development of the whole region, 
including North Vietnam, It is needed in 
the Western Hemisphere, where, under the 
bold ideals of the Alliance for Progress the 
states of Latin America are already carrying 
out a far-reaching, peaceful process of eco-
nomic and social development. 
And indeed, in no area are the tasks of 
economic development more important than 
on the continent of Africa?represented hi 
this hall by the delegates of 37 nations. Last 
23393 
May, in commemorating the anniversary of 
the Organization of African Unity, the Pres-
ident suggested ways in which the United 
States, as a friend of Africa, might help with 
some of that continent's major economic 
problems. Our efforts in this entire field are 
now entering a new stage as we begin to 
carry out the recommendations of a special 
committee appointed to review United States 
participation in African development pro-
grams, both bilateral and multilateral. 
But the economic side of this picture can-
not stand alone. The time is past when 
either peace or material progress could be 
founded on the domination of one people, 
or one race or one group, by another. Yet 
attempts to do this still continue in south-
ern Africa today. As a result, the danger 
to peace in that area is real. 
My Government holds strong views on 
these problems. We are not, and never will 
be, content with a minority government in 
Southern Rhodesia. The objective we sup-
port for that country remains as it was stated 
last May: "to open the full power and re-
sponsibility of nationhood to all the people 
of Rhodesia?not just 6 percent of them." 
Nor can we ever be content with a situa-
tion such as that in South-West Africa, 
where one race holds another in intolerable 
subjection under the false name of apart-
heid. 
DECISION IS REGRETTED 
The decision of the International Court, in 
refusing to touch the merits of the question 
of South-West Africa, was most disappoint-
ing. But the application of law to this 
question does not hang on that decision 
alone. South Africa's conduct remains sub-
ject to obligations reaffirmed by earlier ad-
visory opinions of the Court whose author-
ity is undiminished. Under these opinions, 
South Africa cannot alter the international 
status of the territory without the consent 
of the United Nations; and South Africa re-
mains bound to accept United Nations super-
vision, submit annual reports to the Gen-
eral Assembly and "promote to the utmost 
the material and moral well-being and the 
social progress of the inhabitants." 
This is no time for South Africa to take 
refuge in an overly technical finding of the 
International Court, which did not deal with 
the substantive merits of the case. The time 
is overdue?long overdue?for South Africa 
to accept its obligations to the international 
community in regard to South-West Africa. 
Continued violation by South Africa of its 
plain obligations to the international com-
munity would necessarily require all mem-
bers to take such an attitude into account 
in their relationships with South Africa. 
Mr. President, many other questions of 
significance will engage our attention dur-
ing this session of the General Assembly. 
Foremost among them are questions of dis-
armament and arms control, of which the 
most urgent are the completion of a treaty 
to prevent the further proliferation of nu-
clear weapons and the extension a the lim-
ited test ban treaty. Remaining differences 
on these issues can and must be resolved on 
a basis of mutual compromise. 
Finally, I wish to speak of one further 
matter of great concern both to the United 
Nations and to my country; the draft treaty 
to govern activities in outer space, including 
the moon and other celestial bodies. 
Major progress has been made in the nego-
tiation of this important treaty, but several 
issues remain. One of these concerns the 
question of reporting by space powers on 
their activities on celestial bodies. A second 
Issue concerns access by space powers to one 
another's installations on celestial bodies. 
On both of the points the United States, at 
the most recent meeting of the Legal Sub-
committee of the Committee on Outer Space, 
made significant compromise proposals in 
the interest of early agreement. 
Unfortunately and regretfully, the U.S.S.R. 
has not responded constructively to these

proposals. Instead, it has insisted on still 
another matter: a provision requiring states 
Which grant tracking facilities to one coun-
try to make the same facilities available to 
all others?without reciprocity and without 
regard to the wishes of the granting state. 
The obligation proposed by the U.S.S.R., as 
was apparent in the Outer Space Committee, 
was unacceptable to many countries par-
ticipating in the outer-space discussions, and 
Was supported only by a very small number 
'of East European states. 
Tracking facilities are a matter for bilat-
eral negotiation and agreement. The United 
States has held such discussions and reached 
such agreements with a number of .countries 
Ian a basis of mutual commitment and corn-
/non advantage. France and the European 
Space Research Organization have also es-
tablished widespread tracking networks on a 
similar basis. It is, of course, open to the 
U.S.S.R. and any other space power, without 
objection from my country, to proceed in ex-
actly the same way. 
I should like to state today my Govern-
Trient's interest in bilateral cooperation in. 
tracking of space vehicles on the basis of 
'mutual benefits, and I shpuld like to make an 
Offer to help resolve this impasse: If the 
U.S.S.R. desires to provide for tracking cover-
age from United States territory, we for our 
part, are prepared to discuss with Soviet 
representatives the technical and other re-
4uirements involved with a view to reach-
ing some mutually beneficial agreement. Our 
seleotists and technical representatives and 
Inset without delay to explore the pos-
sibilities. 
The outer space treaty is too important 
and too urgent to be delayed. This treaty 
offers us the opportunity to establish, in the 
'Unlimited realm of space beyond this planet, 
rule of peace and law?before the arms 
race has been extended into that realm. It 
Is all the more urgent because of man's 
rapid strides toward landing on the moon. 
' By far the greater part of the work on the 
treaty is now behind us. We have agreed on 
important provisions, including major ob-
ligations in the area of arms control. We 
Should proceed to settle the remaining sub-
sidiary issues in a spirit of understanding so 
that this General Assembly may give its ap-
proval to a completed treaty before the As-
sembly adjourns. 
lir. President, it is our earnest hope that 
the words of the United States today on all 
these issues may contribute to concrete steps 
toward peace and a better world. 
We 'know the difficulties but we are not dis-
couraged. In the 21 turbulent years since 
the Charter went into effect, we of the United 
Nations have faced conflicts at least as great 
and as difficult as any that confront us to-
day. The failure of this organization has 
been prophesized many times. But all these 
prophesies have been disproved. Even the 
Most formidable issues have not killed our 
organization?and none will. Indeed, it has 
grown great and respected by facing the 
hardest issues and dealing forthrightly with 
them. 
There is no magic in the United Nations 
save what we, its members, bring to it. And 
that magic is a simple thing: our irreducible 
awareness of our common humanity and our 
consequent will to peace. Without the 
awareness and that will, these buildings 
wolild be an empty shell. With them, we 
have here the greatest instrument ever de-
vised by man for the reconciliation of con-
flicts and the building of the better future 
for Which all mankind yearns. 
Mr. CLARK. I believe that we in the 
S.enate have been slow to appreciate the 
very constructive nature of this splendid 
address, which was, I understand, cleared 
by both the Secretary of State and the 
President before it was delivered. I want 
to congratulate both the Secretary of 
State and the President for having per-
mitted Mr. Goldberg to start this strong 
peace offensive. 
I think that several points in the ad-
dress are worthy of special comment. 
In the first place, Ambasador Goldberg 
speaks of the necesity for concentrating 
on the serious dangers to peace now ex-
isting in Asia, particularly the war in 
Vietnam, and indicates that our Govern-
ment remains determined to exercise 
every restraint to limit the war and to 
exert every effort to bring the conflict to 
the earliest possible end. 
My deep regret is that while Mr. Gold-
berg speaks in the United Nations for the 
policy of our Government?and sup-
posedly of the President and the Secre-
tary of State?I note in the Morning 
paper that we are sending American 
troops into the Mekong Delta for the 
first time. I also noted on a television 
broadcast this morning that American 
deaths last week reached a new high since 
May; that they again exceeded, as they 
have several weeks in the past, the total 
South Vietnamese casualties; that the 
number of wounded is drastically up. 
I am gravely concerned that while we 
talk peace at the United Nations, not 
only are we accelerating the war in Viet-
nam, but also, our military commanders 
are sending American boys unnecessarily 
to their deaths. 
I believe the President should be called 
upon, in no uncertain terms, to stop this 
unnecessary slaughter and wounding of 
American boys, while the peace offensive 
Initiated by Ambassador Goldberg can 
be given an opportunity to move for-
ward?hopefully to result, at long last, 
in negotiations. 
I point out that Mr. Goldberg, for the 
first time, makes this fine statement: 
We are not engaged in a "holy war" against 
communism. 
This is the first time that any responsi-
ble officer of our Government, so far as 
I know, has made any such statement. 
Mr. Goldberg reiterates, and I am 
happy to hear him reiterate, what has 
been said before, but which I fear far too 
many people around the globe do not 
believe. He says: 
We do not seek to establish an American 
empire or a "sphere of influence" in Asia. 
That is good news. 
We seek no permanent military bases, no 
permanent establishment of troops, no per-
manent alliances, no permanent American 
"presence" of any kind in South Vietnam. 
That is good news. 
We do not seek to impose a policy of 
alignment on South Vietnam. 
That is extraordinarily good news. 
We do not seek the overthrow of the gov-
ernment of North Vietnam. 
That, too, is encouraging. 
We do not seek to do any injury to main-
land China or to threaten any of its legiti-
mate interats. 
This is, indeed, constructive comment. 
I would hope that others in the executive 
branch of the Government have taken 
careful note of what Mr. Goldberg has 
said. In particular, I refer to some of 
the hawks in the Department of 8tate, in 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in the Central 
Intelligence Agency, and in all the other 
agencies in the executive branch of the 
Government, who have been taking so 
belligerent an attitude with respect to 
our policy in southeast Asia. 
Mr. Goldberg says: 
We want a political solution, not a mili-
tary solution, to this conflict. 
Let us stop the search and destroy 
policy; let us stop the bombing of North 
Vietnam; let us stop the unnecessary 
killing of American boys far purposes 
which do not serve our National interest. 
Mr. Goldberg continues: 
The United States is willing once again to 
take the first step. We are prepared to order 
a cessation of all bombing of North Viet-
nam?the moment we are assured, privately 
or otherwise, that this step will he answered 
promptly by corresponding and appropriate 
de-escalation on the other side. 
This, indeed, is good news; but while 
he is saying that, we are stepping up the 
bombing of North Vietnam; we are 
moving into the Mekong Delta for the 
first time; American casualties are at a 
new high. 
Why is it not possible for once, since 
this unhappy war began, for us to act 
the way we talk? Why, when we go 
with this initiative to the United Na-
tions, do we reinstate the bombing of 
North Vietnam at the same time? 
Why can we not coordinate our policy 
behind the wise statement of Ambassa-
dor Goldberg? 
Mr. President, in conclusion, although 
the entire speech deserves careful read-
ing by every Member of the Senate?and 
I see in the Chamber the chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Disarmament of 
the Committee on Foreign Relations?
I note with great pleasure that Ambas-
sador Goldberg concludes by saying: 
Mr. President, many other questions of 
significance will engage our attention during 
this session of the General Assembly. Fore-
most among them are questions of disarma-
ment and arms control, of which the most 
urgent are the completion of a treaty to 
prevent the further proliferation of nuclear 
weapons and the extension of the limited 
test ban treaty. Remaining differences on 
these issues can and must be resolved on a 
basis of mutual compromise. 
Mr. President, I wait for the day when 
the Secretary of State will permit Am-
bassador Goldberg, and will permit Mr. 
William Foster and his associates to 
make that reasonable compromise which 
within 24 hours could get us within strik-
ing distance of a nonproliferation treaty, 
by abandoning the outmoded and obso-
lete concept of a joint nuclear force in 
which the West German Government 
would retain an option to get its finger 
on the nuclear trigger. 
I express admiration for Ambassador 
Goldberg, and I hope that the lead he 
has taken will be followed by others in 
the administration.

reporters and scholars, some of whom have 
figured prominently in the current purge, to 
escape to freedom. If Peiping should some 
day permit their people to visit the United 
States, it will only mean that the Chinese 
Communists have decided to send disguised 
secret agents and agitators to subvert the 
Americans. 
7. Finally, if the medicine prescribed by 
these "experts" is administered, will the hun-
gry tiger turn into a "humanistic bureau-
crat"? We find the "experts" arriving at dif-
ferent conclusions from their shared prem-
ises. Some say that a change in Peiping's 
policy will be possible when Mao Tse-tung 
dies, citing Peiping's recent frustrations in 
Indonesia, Cuba, Ghana, and elsewhere. 
Others tell us that frustrations will only pro-
voke the hungry tiger into more violence. 
Ironically, the truth of the matter lies in 
what Marx said of Czarist Russia?aggression 
Is sure to follow aggression and expansion to 
follow expansion. History and common sense 
tell us that a hungry tiger's appetite is 
whetted everytime it gets a good meal. 
To sum up, we submit that in their pro-
posals for far-reaching changes in the United 
States policy, the "experts" have no solid 
ground to support either their premises or 
their conclusions. Witingly or unwittingly, 
they have helped the Communists, and 
harmed the cause for free Chinese every-
where in the world. They have rendered a 
disservice to the United States by undermin-
ing American efforts and credibility in the 
Far East. 
We solemnly declare that we have no de-
sire of seeing the United States go to war 
with the Chinese Communists for, in the 
event of armed hostilities, both the American 
people 'anti our own people will suffer. How-
ever, should the proposals of the "experts" be 
adopted, thus fostering the growth of Cham-
berlainism in the United States, the Chinese 
Communists may be encouraged to risk a war 
with the United States as soon as they feel 
strong enough to do so. It is precisely be-
cause we desire to prevent such a war that 
we feel duty-bound to state our views. 
The only things we Chinese people ask of 
the United States are: 
(I) that she, pursuant to the 'traditional 
friendship between the two countries, stand 
firm on her present policy of recognizing the 
government of the Republic of China as the 
only legal and true representative of the Chi-
nese people and not the Communist regime 
in Peiping which does not represent the peo-
ple On the Chinese mainland; and 
(2) that she distinguish friend from foe 
and refuse to be a party to the Chinese Com-
munists' crime of persecuting the people. 
May the United States keep close to her 
heart the following memorable words of Pres-
ident Abraham Lincoln; "Let us have faith 
that right makes might, and in that faith let 
us to the end dare to do our duty as we un-
derstand it."

STILL TIME TO ACT ON STRIKE 
LEGISLATION 
Mr. SMATHERS. Mr. President, once 
again the Nation's industrial peace has 
been shaken by labor-management 
stalemates that threaten to erupt into 
serious strikes. 
Only hasty last-minute maneuvering 
averted a walkout at American Airlines 
that was scheduled to begin this morn-
ing. But, there is every indication that 
a threatened strike at General Electric 
will become a reality next Monday. It 
appears that members of the Interna-
tional Union of Electrical Workers are 
overwhelmingly rejecting a General 
Electric contract offer, and the prospects 
that agreement can be reached before 
the Monday deadline are dim. 
Should General Electric and the IUE 
somehow arrive at a settlement before 
Monday, there is still the possibility that 
Westinghouse, where the IUE's contract 
expires soon, could be struck. 
In addition, compacts in the automo-
bile, trucking, construction, and machin-
ery industries are up for renewal in the 
near future. 
For the moment, we have escaped the 
hardships and economic losses that ac-
company major deadlocks. There is 
little likelihood, however, that we will be 
able to avoid at least one crippling 
strike in the next year. 
As usual, it will be the public?aver-
age citizens with no interest whatever in 
the issues that divide these particular 
employers and employees?that will suf-
fer the most from the upcoming walk-
outs. 
Merchants, housewives, students, 
Americans of every occupation will 
hit by the economic fallout from labo 
management explosions over which the 
have no control. 
Mr. President, there may be some ques-
tion as to whether a strike at either Gen-
eral Electric or Westinghouse would have 
the impact of this summer's airline strike 
or last winter's New York subway walk-
out. But there can be no questioning 
the fact that our machinery to deal with 
such impasses, when they imperil the 
public interest, is woefully inadequate. 
The Railway Labor Act has proven 
completely ineffectual. It was powerless 
to protect the American people in 1963, 
during the railroad work rules dispute. 
It was powerless to do so last July. It 
will be just as impotent in the future. 
Similarly, the emergency strike pro-
visions of the Taft-Hartley Act offer no 
final solution to management-union con-
flicts that pummel the public while they 
go unresolved. 
I am convinced that Congress cannot 
much longer fail in its obligation to guard 
the interests of the citizens of this Na-
tion. The precedents for action are 
clear. 
In the airline and other transportation 
and communication industries, we have 
already recognized the public stake by 
providing subsidies and regulating rates 
and routes. We have in effect declared 
that these industries perform vital public 
services and must be operated to benefit 
the public. 
In other types of enterprises, Con-
gress has the responsibility to act under 
its Constitutional authority to regulate 
interstate commerce. 
On February 8 of this year, I intro-
duced S. 2891, a bill to create a five-
man U.S. Court of Labor-Manage-
ment Relations. This court would have 
jurisdiction in labor-management stale-
mates adversely affecting the national 
interest and would provide the machin-
ery through which binding settlements 
could be achieved in the most intransi-
gent deadlocks. 
The labor court idea is hardly a new 
one. Labor columnist Victor Riesel 
points out that Sweden, which has long 
had such an institution, has not had a 
major strike in 21 years. Although the 
Swedish Court differs in some respects 
from what I have proposed, its purpose 
is the same: Labor peace. The results 
have been spectacularly successful. 
In addition, labor courts in Austrailia 
and New Zealand have helped cushion 
those nations against the harsh blows 
of industrial strife. 
Mr. President, the American people 
should not have to wait for a repetition 
of this year's 41-day airline strike be-
fore Congress moves to tighten our na-
tional labor. laws. 
A first step in that direction should 
be taken now, before a crisis situation 
Inflames emotions and clouds reason. 
That first step should be hearings before 
the Subcommittee on Improvements in 
Judicial Machinery, where S. 2891 is now 
pending. 
Although the 89th Congress is nearing 
adjournment, there is still time to act 
on this measure, and I am hopeful that 
we can begin now.

And they have made a great claim at

debate. 
The open letter, to which I have al-
luded, comes as an effective answer to 
the utterances of those who would dis-
tort, sincerely or otherwise, the issue and 
history of the China debate. 
The letter, which is signed by more 
than 1,600 university faculty members 
and scholars in the Republic of China, 
asserts that "the experts have no solid 
ground to support either their premises 
or their conclusions, Wittingly or unwit-
tingly, they have helped the Communists, 
and harmed the cause for free Chinese 
everywhere in the world. They have 
rendered a disservice to the United States 
by undermining American efforts and 
credibility in the Par East," 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
'Open Letter to the American People 
on the 'China Debate'" be printed in 
the body of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
with my remarks. 
There being no objection, the letter 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
AN OPEN LETTER TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
ON THE "CHINA DEBATE" 
In recent months there have been proposals 
by certain persons in the United States that 
concessions be made to the Peiping regime in 
Order to induce it to widen its participa-
ton In international affars. Many so-called 
"China experts" in the United States have fig-
ured prominently in an oganized propaganda 
campaign urging for a change of the United 
States China policy. They have lent their 
stature in the academic community to the in-
spired Campaign to attain the desired ends. 
In their efforts to support their contentions 
they have displayed a knowledge of things 
Chinese, which is quite superficial even if 
sincere. 
Capitalizing on what they allege as the au-
thoritarian tradition of dynastic China dur-
ing the last three milleniums, they argue 
that the Communist regime in Peiping is but 
the latest manifestation of the mainstream 
of Chinese cultural heritage. They claim 
that the existence of the regime is a "real-
ity" which one must face, and that the only 
way to face up to the "reality" is to work 
toward a gradual shift from trying to iso-
late Peiping to admitting ft to the United 
Nations and other international organize-
tion, A few of them have even recom-
mended that the United States policy should 
aim at eventual establishment of normal dip-
lomatic relations with that regime. Con-
veniently, they ignore the fact that the re-
gime oppresses the Chinese people and that 
the Chinese people hate the regime and con-
tinue to resist It. Furthermore, the present 
propaganda campaign is carried out at a time 
when Americans are dying in southeast Asia 
to check the expansionism of that very re-
gime which they call Chinese. We, the un-
dersigned, feel obliged to refute the assertions 
of these "China experts." 
These "China experts" have made many as-
sertions at variance with facts, the most ap-
parent of which are as follows: 
1. They have distorted Maoism into some-
thing representative of a modernized exten-
sion of the venerable tradition of China. The 
true Chinese tradition has,, since time im-
memorial, consisted of love of one's kith 
and kin; charity for man; the virtues of pro-
priety, humility, loyalty and sympathy, and 
the pursuit of universal peace and worldwide 
commonwealth. None of these virtues is 
compatible with the contrivances of the 
Chinese Communists to destroy family love 
and Instigate mutual hate and class struggle. 
There i.s really no shortage of Sinologues 
in the United States. Can any of them find 
In real ,Cliineae tradition even a shred of 
Stalinism or such Communist-made mani-
festations as: brain-washing, liquidation of 
a father by the son, betrayal of one's friends, 
slave-labor camps or the "people's com-
munes"? 
2. It is alleged that Chinese Communism 
is an expression of nationalism, a reaction 
against the humiliations and reverses China 
had suffered in the 19th century. Dr. Sun 
Yat-sen, who tutored modern China in na-
tionalism, said that Chinese nationalism 
should aim only at righting past wrongs, and 
that China, when she achieves power, should 
not imitate decadent imperialist behavior. 
Early in this century, Chinese nationalism 
rose in self-defense against Japanese and 
Russian expansionism. Quite naturally, 
China was drawn closer to the West and 
Dr. Sun clearly advocated economic coopera-
tion between China and the Western nations 
as the goal of China's national reconstruc-
tion. On the other hand, the United States 
has never encroached upon any Chinese ter-
ritory and the Chinese have always regarded 
the United States as a special friend. All 
the anti-American views one hears_ now are 
invented by the Communists and dissemi-
nated by their propaganda mills. They do 
not reflect the true sentiment of the Chinese 
people on the mainland. 
3. The so-called experts strive to extol the 
supposed Chinese Communist economic and 
military strength. Of course China is a 
vast country with an immense population. 
But the Chinese Communists do not repre-
sent the Chinese people.. The 600 million 
Chinese people, to use Peiping's figure, are 
not an. asset but a liability to the Chinese 
Communists. Furthermore, in talking about 
economic development under the Chinese 
Communists, one should always beware of 
over-stated claims. In 1959, for example, the 
Chinese Communists themselves openly ad-
mitted that all production figures fOr 1958 
had been exaggerated by from 50 to 58 per 
cent. Yet this is conveniently overlooked by 
the so-called experts. It is true that the 
Chinese Communists have test exploded 
three nuclear devices. These blasts are cer-
tainly storm. signals. But as Hitler's V.-1.s 
and V-2s :failed to bring him victory or to 
frighten the free world into submission, we 
need not tremble and cower before Mao's 
mushroom clouds. 
4. These experts like to refer to what they 
call "fact" and "reality." Oh, fact and 
reality, what foolish acts and evil have been 
committed in thy name! When Hitler's 
armies began their march in Europe, Neville 
Chamberlain and Charles A. Lindbergh ar-
gued that this fact and reality must be 
acknowledged. Winston Churchill and 
Franklin D. Roosevelt refused to accept them. 
When Japan invaded China in 1937, certain 
American columnists also saw the invasion 
as an inevitable although unpleasant fact. 
But we Chinese refused to accept it. The 
"realists" of today see only what they regard 
as facts, but decline to take into considera-
tion the actual forts contrary to their thesis, 
such as: the numerous anti-Communist in-
cidents on the Chinese mainland (249,012 in 
1061 versus 56,000 in 1965, according to the 
Chinese Communist "Ministry of Public 
Security"), the open rebellion of the intel-
lectuals against the Communists (and in 
the name of Chinese tradition too), the 
escape. to freedom of thousands upon thou-
sands of youths, and the defection of many 
officers of Peiping's armed forces and its 
diplomatic and civil functionaries. 
5. The "peace mongers" try to influence 
the thinking of the peace-loving Americans 
with the specter of war. Some say a new 
policy of accommodation and gradual yield-
ing is the only alternative. Since war is dan-
gerous, recognition of the Peipins?b regime be-
comes a panacea. But what inherent right 
have the Chinese Communists to present the 
United States with the choice between sub-
mission and war? Has not the United States 
the same right to insist that the Chinese 
Communists give up the use of force and 
their announced goal of world revolution 
through subversion and "people's liberation 
wars"? Some say Peiping is a "hungry tiger" 
which loses its temper when frustrated or 
irritated by the United States. If this "pet" 
is lovingly patted and well fed, so the theory 
goes, it will regain its Confucian virtues. 
Such views of the "China-experts" dumb-
found us. They are defending the tiger's 
right to devour others in the hope that it 
will never be hungry again. 
6. These experts prescribe "containment 
without isolation" under which five steps are 
urged: 
General softening of the United States pol-
icy toward Peiping to achieve "containment; 
without isolation". This, however, is self-
contradiction. Unless the regime is effec-
tively isolated it will continue to resort to 
subversive activities as It has been doing all 
along. Containment then becomes impossi-
ble. In that event, not only the free world 
position in Southeast Asia will become un-
tenable, but the retreat will not be confined 
to Vietnam. Furthermore, these same ex-
perts say that this formula of "containment 
without isolation" has proved effective in 
dealing with Soviet Russia, but they forget 
that whatever compromise Moscow has made 
should be attributed only to United States 
firmness, not concessions. 
Admission of Peiping into the United Na-
tions. For a variety of reasons some Ameri-
can experts advocate a seat in the United 
Nations for the Chinese Communists, "even 
though they said they would dynamite the 
place." Peiping's admission would violate 
both the letter and the spirit of the United 
Nations Charter. -Furthermore the Chinese 
Communists will certainly engage in large-
scale subversive activities in the United 
States. These experts, at the same time, sug-
gest half-heartedly that the United Nations 
seat of the Republic of China should be pre-
served. In reality, however, they are dealing 
a severe blow to the cause of a free China. 
and denying the people on the Chinese main-
land any hope of deliverance. 
Lifting of the trade embargo on the Chi-
nese Communists, and acceptance of their 
participation in nuclear controls. If isola-
tion of the Chinese Communists is to end. 
the embargo on trade with the Chinese main-
land would have to be lifted, these experts 
contend. This is tantamount to helping the 
enemy by replenishing his stocks and ar-
senals. The Chinese Communists are al-
ready employing to great advantage their 
crude bombs for blackmail. They have arro-
gantly refused to join the nuclear test ban 
treaty. Why should they accept Interna-
tional controls unless, as they, have pro-
posed, the United States would scrap al/ 
nuclear weapons along with them? And 
even then, who can guarantee that they will 
not continue to develop their atomic arsenal 
in secret, and will not in time brandish their 
bombs to threaten the world? 
Progression from appeasing flexibility to 
eventual recognition. These American ex-
perts are in fact asking the United States 
to yield to their pressure and accord diplo-
matic recognition to a -U.N.-condemned ag-
gressor, who is directly and vicariously re-
sponsible for the murder of Americans in 
Korea and Vietnam. Such a proposal makes 
a mockery of righteousness and justice, and 
constitutes a breach of faith with thousands 
upon thousands of Americans who gave their 
lives unhesitatingly for freedom. 
Permitting Chinese Communist reporters 
and scholars to visit the United States. As 
-expected, Peiping has already rejected con-
temptuously recent American offers to ex-
change visits, for it has no intention of lift-
ing up the Bamboo Curtain to allow its own

tions last week, it seems to me that the 
tone of compromise is greater than it 
has ever been before. 
To my knowledge, for example, we 
have never stated with such clarity that 
we do not ask North Vietnam to sur-
render anything "which belongs to it,4 
nor do we seek to exclude "any seg-
ment" of South Vietnam from partici-
pating in peace discussions or in the 
peaceful future of their country. 
Ambassador Goldberg also restated, 
with eloquence and firmness, the limited 
purposes for which the United States is 
giving assistance to South Vietnam, and 
exactly what our aims there are. 
Because I feel we cannot repeat too 
often our aims in southeast Asia and our 
moderate and judicious proposals for 
ending the Vietnam conflict, I should 
like to read them again here, as ex-
pressed by Ambassador Goldberg: 
First, this is what we are not doing in 
Vietnam. 
We are not engaged in a "holy war" against 
communism. 
We do not seek to establish an American 
empire or a "sphere of influence" in Asia. 
We seek no permanent military bases, no 
permanent establishment of troops, no per-
manent alliances, no permanent American 
"presence" of any kind in South Viet Nam. 
We do not seek to impose a policy of 
alignment on South Viet Na,m. 
We do not seek the overthrow of the Gov-
ernment of North Viet Nam. 
We do not seek to do any injury to main-
land China nor to threaten any of its legiti-
mate interests. 
We do not ask of North Viet Nam an un-
conditional surrender or indeed the surrender 
of anything that belongs to it; nor do we seek 
to exclude any segment of the South Viet-
namese people from peaceful participation in 
their country's future. 
And, now this is briefly what we seek: 
We want a political solution, not a military 
solution, to this conflict. By the same token, 
we reject the idea that North Viet Nam has 
a right to impose a military solution. 
We seek to assure for the people of South 
Viet Nam the same right of self-determina-
tion?to decide their own political destiny, 
free of force?that the United Nations 
Charter affirms for all, 
And we believe that reunification of Viet 
Ham should be decided through a free choice 
by the peoples of both the North and South 
without outside interference, the results of 
which choice we are fully prepared to sup-
port. 
It /seems to me this puts the problem 
prety directly in the lap of the govern-
ment at Hanoi. The next move is up to 
them. We reiterate our good faith offer 
to negotiate unconditionally for a politi-
cal settlement without loss of honor by 
those involved. 
OMBUDSMAN 
Mr. LONG of Missouri. Mr. President, 
the concept of ombudsman has started 
to interest many people across the Na-
tion. An article appeared in Focus/ 
Midwest, 1965, suggesting that?
As the Ombudsman program is more 
readily transferable to state rather than to 
the Federal Government in our country, Mis-
souri and Illinois could take the lead in 
bringing this concept to the U.S.A. 
Mr. President, I think it is important 
for the States to consider the merits of 
an ombudsman system. I ask unani-
mous consent to insert, at this point in 
the RECORD, the article referred to. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
WE NEED AN OMBUDSMAN 
(Thomas E. Eichhorst) 
What can you do if a bureaucrat irritates 
YOU, or delays too long, or requires too much 
red tape, or petulantly denies what you 
want? 
This problem is of increasing importance 
as governmental agencies proliferate and 
their activities become even more encom-
passing. The answer, like many other re-
forms, is the result of the political experi-
mentation in that great practical laboratory 
of social progress?Scandinavian govern-
ment; it is the Ombudsman. 
Nordic peoples have long provided a re-
view for the actions of the leadership of the 
tribe or nation. The fierce and rapacious 
Vikings have left a deep and lasting impres-
sion on our concepts of fair play and justice 
that more than compensates for their vio-
lent visitations a millenium ago. These 
warriors established lovsigemands (law 
speakers) who would proclaim the law and 
regulate the primitive processes of govern-
ment. The first truly representative na-
tional assembly is another of the govern-
mental gifts of the Norseman; the Iceland 
Athing, established in 930, is the world's 
oldest parliamentary body. 
The office of Ombudsman inaugurated in 
1809, is but another part of Sweden's devel-
opment of a bureaucracy bound by the rule 
of law. The Swedish Parliament must 
choose a person of known legal ability and 
of outstanding integrity for Ombudsman. 
Though a lawyer, he is not bound by legalis-
tic rules, but instead is encouraged to be an 
ingenious pragmatist in order to find an ac-
ceptable remedy for every administrative 
error. The powers and jurisdiction of that 
Swedish Ombudsman have been continually 
extended so that his area of review now in-
cludes almost all of the national bureauc-
racy. 
The other Scandinavian nations have also 
established such an office: Finland in 1919, 
Denmark in 1955, and Norway in 1962. ' 
In recent years the value of this Office has 
become more widely known and the practice 
has now jumped half-a-world to New Zea-
land, where an Ombudsman was recently ap-
pointed. At present, England, Australia, and 
several of the western provinces of Canada 
are considering setting up a similar program. 
As the Ombudsman program is more readily 
transferable to state rather than to the fed-
eral government in our country, Missouri 
and Illinois could take the leading in bring-
ing this concept to the U.S.A. 
The Ombudsman, which in Swedish means 
agent, is an official appointed, usually by the 
legislature, to see that the people are treated 
properly by their government. The Ombuds-
man is not unlike the man who hears com-
plaints in a large department store. Ile is 
the man who hears every grievance, no mat-
ter how fanciful or far-fetched. Indeed, he 
concerns himself with the pettifogging com-
plaints no one else in the impersonal gov-
ernment seems to bother about. 
Under the present Ombudsman systems, 
his activity is usually triggered by a letter 
of complaint from a citizen. The Ombuds-
man then investigates the action (or in-
action) in an attempt to obtain satisfaction 
for the citizens. Sometimes, as a result of 
investigating such a complaint, or on his 
own motion, he may decide to make a major 
study of a large problem involving many 
individual cases. The Ombudsman inquires 
into substance, procedure, legality, delay, 
convenience, and even politeness. While he 
has no power to change administrative deci-
sions, he can investigate, criticize, recom-
mend, and publicize. 
The theory and practice of Ombudsman-
ship is grounded on the cardinal principle 
of checks and balances. This principle, as it 
relates to the Ombudsman system, prescribes 
that the action of a government official 
should be reviewed by another official who 
can challenge the action, but cannot sub-
stitute judgment. Because the Ombudsman 
Is not involved in making the substantive 
decisions, he can focus his attention on the 
administrative procedures. The essential 
idea behind this system is the view that con-
tinuing constructive criticsm can signficantly 
improve the governmental processes. 
The success of the program depends on the 
personality of the man chosen for the office. 
To properly perform his duties, the Ombuds-
man should combine an intimate knowledge 
of state government and the leading political 
and administrative personalities with a pro-
found belief in freedom and democracy; be 
shrewd, tolerant, good humored, and be im-
bued with a sense of the value and the limits 
of his office, and be without vanity or self-
importance. Every country which has estab-
lished the office, has been blessed with an 
able and very human administrator with a 
penchant for anonymity?just what the posi-
tion requires. 
If, as a result of his investigations, the 
Ombudsman finds that the bureaucrat's ac-
tions were wrong, he can publicly or pri-
vately reprimand him. This power has been 
helpful in restoring a sense of purpose to 
an errant government worker, particularly 
when the complaint has involved an imper-
sonal or condescending attitude held by 
some administrative employees. In other 
cases, the Ombudsman might refuse to crit-
icize a past decision of a government worker, 
but probably would suggest guidelines for 
future actions. When the basic procedures 
are faulty, he can recommend far reaching 
changes and improvements. It is up to the 
administrative officials or the legislature to 
Implement these suggestions. It has been 
the experience of the Scandinavian coun-
tries having the Ombudsman, that the pres-
tige of the office and the publicity given to 
his pronouncements by the popular press 
are powerful weapons. The threat of possi-
ble criticism by the Ombudsman has had a 
desirable effect upon public officials and civil 
servants. 
The rectification of individual wrongs, and 
the continuing improvement of the admin-
istrative system are the readily recognizable 
results of the Ombudsman's efforts. Even 
more important, however, is the spark of 
creativity which it gives to and requires of 
the entire corps of government workers. 
This on-going interest in the monotonous 
minutiae assists each worker to see every 
dull dreary task as a challenge and, no less 
real, as a possible cause for a complaint to 
the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman's criti-
cisms apply to all areas of administrative 
activity: his imaginative study of these 
problems and his creative suggestions are 
the prods needed to perfect the controls 
policing governmental work. This broad ar-
senal of remonstrative devices has been ex-
tremely helpful in preserving human values 
In governmental bureaucracies. 
This Scandinavian concept of reformative 
internal action and initiative could well pro-
vide us with a practical model which we 
could adapt to help solve our own adminis-
trative problems. Having an agent for the 
citizenry, inside the bureaucracy itself, would 
have a salutary effect on all state workers?
the merit system employee as well as the 
patronage jobholder. Such a vibrant cata-
ylst in, say, Jefferson City, Missouri and 
Springfield, Illinois could be recommended 
by the newly inaugurated governors who 
would thus initiate a novel service for their 
citizens,

CONdRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENAT 
VFASeptember 29, 1966 
OUR ASIAN ALLIES  
Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, the lively 
interests which Asian nations are show-
ing in taking the initiative for peace and 
for backing up South Vietnam's fight 
for independence and sovereignty, and 
their escalating interest in siding with 
the United States and South Vietnam, 
is encouraging. 
Also encouraging is the forthcoming 
Manila conference. Although it is met 
with varying degrees of hope, it is in-
disputably hopeful. Two editorials from 
yesterday's Washington newspapers, re-
flect this hope. 
That we have Asian allies increas-
ingly willing to step forward and be 
counted, and to work toward a solution 
of the problems in the Pacific, is made 
clearer, too, by the words of Thailand's 
Foreign Minister, Mr. Thanat :Khoman, 
to the United Nations on Tuesday. 
I ask unanimous consent that the two 
editorials, one published in the Wash-
ington Post and the other in the Wash-
ington Evening Star of yesterday, and a 
report from the New York Times on the 
speech of Thanat Khoman be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
and editorials were ordered to be printed 
in the RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Post, 
Sept. 28, 19651 
MANILA CONFERENCE 
The seven-nation conference at Manila, 
which President Johnson has promptly 
agreed to attend, is welcome for any con-
tributions that the group can make to peace 
and stability in South Vietnam. It is wel-
come, besides, as a product of Asian initia-
tive. And It is to be hoped that it may 
mark the beginning of a post-war era in 
which the United States will play a different 
role than the one which has been imposed 
upon it during a period of readjustment In 
Asia. 
It is not possible for the United States, as 
the major power touching on the Pacific, let 
alone the most powerful country in the 
world, to avoid entanglement in the prob-
lems of the region. It is, by reason of geog-
raphy, national interest and World War II 
obligations, a Pacific power. It should not 
think of itself nor be thought of by other 
Asian countries as "the" Pacific power. The 
rising strength and stability of Asian allies 
can diminish the disproportionate contribu-
tions of the United States to the forces mak-
ing for peace and stability in the region. The 
Manila meeting is a good sign that Asian 
friends are ready to rise to a role appro-
priate to their power and resources in the 
region. The American contribution, for the 
foreseeable future, will have to be great. 
But it ought to be a diminishing one. 
President Marcos has given a great impetus 
to the political impulses of our Pacific 
friends throughout the region. It is evident 
that he found Washington receptive to his 
notions on his recent visit here. No doubt 
it would be naive to suppose and overly 
sanguine to expect that Manila will usher 
in at once a revolutionary transfer of power 
and responsibility to the collective Pacific 
countries. This transition can proceed only 
in conformity with the realities of power in 
the region. But it is not too much to hope 
that in this decade we may see the founda-
tions laid for a redistribution of responsi-
bility under which the United States ulti-
Mately will not need to act anywhere in the 
DEDICATION OF BIG BEND RESER-
VOIR IN SOUTH DAKOTA 
Mr. MUNDT. Mr. Presisient, on Sep-
tember 15, well-attended and highly ap-
propriate ceremonies were held in South 
Dakota to dedicate the completion of the 
Big Bend Reservoir, one of the great 
Missouri River reservoirs which now 
comprise what we call "The Great Lakes 
of South Dakota." These lakes are sec-
ond only in size in this country to the 
natural Great Lakes stretching from 
Chicago to Buffalo. 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk deliv-
ered a highly effective address at the 
dedication, reviewing the foreign policy 
pattern of the United States and all per-
tinent factors relating to our part in the 
war in Vietnam. His address was 
warmly received by the more than 4,000 
South Dakotans attending the dedica-
tion ceremonies. 
One of the highlights of the speaking 
program was an address by an enrolled 
member of the Sioux Indian Tribe, Mr. 
Philip S. Byrnes, now holding an off-
reservation job in our State Capital 
Pierre. Mr. Byrnes Yield the audience 
spellbound as he delivered a thrilling and 
most impressive address reviewing early 
history and how the great Sioux nation 
had once lived their lives, fought their 
wars, shot their buffalo, and made their 
homes in the attractive Missouri River 
Valley. Many of them were, in fact, 
displaced and moved elsewhere as the 
result of the impounded waters of Big 
Bend Reservoir. 
Mr. President, for the information of 
Congress and the country, I ask unani-
mous consent to have printed in the 
Rump the complete text of the fine ad-
dress by Mr. Byrnes. 
There being no objection, the address 
was ordered to be 'printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
ADDRE.ss ra pi-map S. Evrams 
Secretary, honored guests, fellow citi-
zens of America. It is my privilege and 
honor to represent the Sioux Nation at this 
historic occasion. 
What's better than a scene of togetherness 
in our great country today, as we meet here 
to officially dedicate the completion of the 
Big Bend Dam. 
Four of these large dams cover valuable 
home land areas of the Sioux country across 
the State of South Dakota. 
In behalf of the Lower Brule and the Crow 
Creek Sioux, I wish to state that we are proud 
to have made our contribution in the con-
struction of these Important projects that 
were started by men of vision, for the 
strength and progress of our country. From 
where we stand and as we look across this 
beautiful lake you can see the banks of the 
Crow Creek Reservation, and the location 
where we are now, is the Lower Brule Reser-
vation. The Missouri River is the dividing 
line of these two important Sioux reserva-
tions. 
In order to understand the existence of 
the Sioux Indians and the great plains area 
Which constitute their home, an awareness of 
history must be maintained. 
This great river flowed through the heart 
of the Sioux home for many centuries. The 
Sioux lived along this river and within its 
watersheds. From this river, the Sioux In-
dians received their strength. 
On the great plains from which flows the 
Waters that feed the Missouri River there 
were large herds of buffalo, the life-blood of 
our forefathers, Within this area the Sioux 
developed a self-supporting way of life and 
were in control of the area, and for many cen-
turies enjoyed the abundant life, but prog-
ress was not to be denied. 
Foreseeable changes were inevitable in this 
world if progress was to be made. The Sioux 
defended its way of life as honorably and as 
bravely as their resources would allow, but 
their strength was not enough to stop the 
encroachment of civilization on its march to 
the West. 
With the passing of the buffalo, our 
strength and way of life was forever changed. 
The Sioux found it necessary to make treaties 
and become part of the Nation of America. 
We cherish this civilization and, as in the 
past, will in the future defend with all our 
strength this country.,a.gainst nations who try 
to defeat our country and rob us of our free-
dom and way of life. 
It has not been "easy for many of the 
Sioux to change sufficiently to cope with 
the standards of living which modern civil-
ization demands. However, many have be-
come outstanding personalities in various 
professions and leaders in the destiny of 
this Nation. 
The values which were lost by the Lower 
Ernie and the Crow Creek Sioux for the 
flood water of the Big Bend Dam were the 
rich level fiat lands along the Missouri River, 
the choice and highest priced of all lands in 
this area. This water front carried also 
great values to our people in the form of 
valuable timber. It furnished cover for wild 
animal life and wild fruit a:nd vegetables 
were plentiful. From these things our peo-
ple have been accustomed for generations to 
get fuel, food and shelter. 
The spirit of the Lower Brule and the Crow 
Creek Sioux is for progress. 
The money received for the payment of 
their losses is being used to develop a cattle 
economy as a substitute for the native econ-
omy that vanished with the buffalo. Small 
industry has been installed, and with the 
development of their natural resources, the 
building of better homes on both reserva-
tions. 
The most important program is scholar-
ship grants for higher education for the 
young people. Some of our Indian students 
have already graduated from college with 
degrees and are holding responsible jobs in 
this highly competitive country in which we 
live. By evaluating the historical back-
ground of the Sioux Indians who once 
roamed and hunted on the Great Plains, en-
joying nature's bounty and their own un-
disputed might, it becomes evident that the 
Sioux Nation went through a great change 
and it is a most fitting tribute to them that 
by treaty agreements we have become one 
great nation. 
M7. Secretary, it is our hope as you and 
leaders of our country gather around the 
council tables of the world, that our mes-
sage at this time will in some measure be 
an inspiration to you and will give you a 
feeling of support from the Sioux people of 
the Great Plains area. 
In behalf of the Sioux Indla:ns, our proper 
business is improvement. Let our age be 
the age of improvement. In a day of peace, 
let us advance the arts of peace and the 
works of peace. Let our conceptions be en-
larged to the circle of our duties. Let us 
extend our ideas over the whole of the vast 
field in which we are called to act. Let our 
object be our country, our whole country, 
and nothing but our country. And, by the 
blessing of God, may our country itself be-
come a v4st'anti splendid monument, not of 
oppression and terror, but of wisdom, of 
peace, and of liberty, upon which the world 
nay gaze with admiration.

[From the Washington (D.C.) Star, Sept. 
28, 1966] 
MEETING IN MANILA 
On the face of things, it is difficult to see 
how the meeting which has been scheduled 
for next month in Manila can make much 
of a contribution toward settling the war in 
Viet Nam. The same thing is true of the 
announcement that Pope Paul VI is sending 
a special mission from the Vatican to Saigon. 
And for that matter much the same may be 
said of the peace initiatives which have come 
from Ambassador Goldberg at the United 
Nations and from Secretary General U Thant. 
Wars are not ended by assembling digni-
taries in Manila or in any other place. The 
first and overriding requirement is a genuine 
desire to arrive at a settlement. This applies 
of course to Washington. And it also applies, 
with particular emphasis in this case, to 
Saigon, Hanoi, Peking and Moscow. To say 
the least, the reactions from the last three 
capitals have not been encouraging. 
Nevertheless, since surface appearances can 
be misleading, it is right, we think, that 
President Johnson should go to Manila. The 
inspiration for that meeting apparently came 
from President Marcos of the Philippines. 
Other nations which will be represented are 
South Viet Nam, South Korea, Thailand, 
Australia and New Zealand. They have a 
direct and compelling interest in finding a 
peaceful solution for the troubles in South-
east Asia, for they will be directly under the 
guns if, for lack of a peaceful settlement, 
a general war should erupt in the area. Nor 
can Hanoi and Peking really be entirely in-
different to this prospect, despite their seem-
? ing indifference now. For President Marcos 
was unquestionably right when he said to 
the United Nations that Asian people are 
under an "inescapable obligation to devise 
Asian solutions to Asian problems." This 
principle, he added, "is at once so just 
and so indisputably right that Hanoi and 
Peking will be under a strong moral obliga-
tion to relax their hostile attitdue." 
Wishful thinking? Perhaps so. But hav-
ing in mind all the straws that have been 
flying in the wind, especially the lively inter-
est that the Vatican is displaying in the 
search for a peaceful settlement, it is difficult 
to believe that the other side is as deter-
mined to pursue what for them is now a los-
ing war as the words coming out of Hanoi 
would indicate. Today's new Viet Cong 
statement of the conditions which might lead 
to peace talks is a further hopeful develop-
ment. 
Disappointment may await this hope. If 
SO, there will be no choice for us except to 
stay in the fight. In this connection, it was 
right for Defense Secretary McNamara to 
announce plans for the acquisition of 280 
new combat aircraft in the next fiscal year 
and for the White House to make it known 
that the next budget will provide added bil-
lions for the coming months of conflict. 
Hanoi should be put on plain notice that 
an adamant refusal to discuss peace will

THAI, IN U.N., BACKS THE UNITED STATES AND 
CRITICIZES THANT'S POSITION?THANAT SAYS 
COMMUNISTS ARE AGGRESSORS IN VIETNAM 
AND OPPOSES APPEASEMENT 
(By Drew Middleton) 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., September 27.?
Thanat Khoman, Thailand's Foreign Min-
ister declared today that the United Nations 
and its officials did not have the right to 
barter South Vietnam's freedom and sov-
ereignty for dubious promises of peace. 
That passage and others in Mr. Thanat's 
address to the General Assembly were widely 
interpreted as attacking Secretary General 
Thant's three-step program for peace. The 
Foreign Minister asserted that events had 
shown that neither the United Nations nor 
Mr. Thant could do much, if anything, to 
achieve a peaceful solution in Southeast 
Asia. 
Nor did the Thai leader join the almost 
universal chorus demanding that Mr. Thant 
remain in office, a chorus in which both the 
United States and the Soviet Union have 
joined. The Secretary General, he noted 
had been forced to adopt "a totally despond-
ent posture" as a result of the failure of his 
peace efforts. 
DEMANDS CONCESSIONS 
Mr. Thanat's was an Asian voice that 
forcefully rejected any peace proposals that 
rewarded what he termed aggression and 
failed to extract concessions from North 
Vietnam and Communist doctrines "born in 
the dark and sordid recesses of European 
ghettos." 
The speech marked, in the words of one 
distinguished West European delegate, the 
first time in this session that a pro-Western 
Asian "has spoken clearly against any at-
tempt at appeasement" of the Communists. 
Mr. Thanat's comments troubled many 
delegates from the smaller powers. His 
frank intransigence worried those who be-
lieved that something was stirring among 
the Asian Communist powers and that the 
smallest changes in the United States posi-
tion would lead to the start of peace nego-
tiations. 
Mr. Thanat's denunciation of any appease-
ment of the Communists shocked what has 
been called by Western diplomats the "peace 
at any price" group among the delegations 
and senior members of the United Nations 
Secretariat. 
That group has accepted the Secretary 
General's three-step program and his own 
authority as the keys to peace. It also 
strongly favors Communist China's entry 
into the United Nations as one means toward 
peace in Asia. 
CHALLENGE TO PEE/NG 
Paul Hasluck, Australia's Minister for Ex-
ternal Affairs, took an aggressive line on that 
question in his speech to the General Assem-
bly. He challenged Peking to give at least 
a sign that it would obey the Charter of the 
United Nations if entry were granted. 
"China asks the United Nations to change," 
he said. "Is China not to make any change 
itself to fit into the United Nations?" 
Recognition of Communist China and its 
admission to the United Nations will not 
solve the larger problems of relations with 
that country, Mr. Hasluck warned. He told 
advocates of admission not to oversimplify 
the China issue by "seeing it simply in terms 
of recognition or of admissiOn to the United 
Nations." 
Mr. Thanat was highly critical of Mr. 
Thant's three steps for a settlement in Viet-
nam. The first calls for cessation of Ameri-
can bombing of North Vietnam. 
Everyone seems to have forgotten, the Thai 
Minister said, that bombing has been halted 
twice in the past without worthwhile results, 
On the contrary, he declared, it gave the 
Communists the opportunity to gather 
strength for an intensification of the war. 
SEES ONE-SIDED APPROACH 
Perhaps alluding to President de Gaulle, 
Mr. Thant said that others had advocated 
the withdrawal of American forces from 
South Vietnam without mentioning North 
Vietnamese forces. The French President 
proposed American withdrawal in a speech 
at Pnompenh, Cambodia, early this month. 
"As any impartial observer may notice," 
Mr. Thanat said, "many if not all the solu-
tions so far advanced by one party or another 
tend to favor the side which instigated the 
war for the purpose of placing South Viet-
nam under its control." 
Apparently with Cambodia in mind, Mr. 
Thanat warned that short-sighted views on 
the term for peace might pave the way for 
the destruction of those who hold them. 
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Cambodian 
chief of state, has generally supported Presi-
dent de Gaulle's position on the war. 
Mr. Thant conceded that the proposal for 
an Asian peace conference, backed by his 
own country, the Philippines and Malaysia, 
had failed to evoke a positive response from 
North Vietnam or Communist China. 
That, he said, shows that one side favors 
a peaceful settlement, while "the other has 
so far rejected every move towards a peaceful 
settlement." 
It is the aggressors, the Thai leader de-
clared, who cling to the idea of a military 
solution in Vietnam while the United States 
and its allies seek a negotiated peace. It is 
the Communists, he said, who proclaim that 
the wax is "a holy war of national libera-
tion." 
GOOD NEWS ABOUT PROJECT HEAD-
START 
-Mr. RIBICOFF. Mr. President, Proj-
ect Headstart, the Federal preschool pro-
gram for needy children, has gotten off 
to a running start. 
We have long known that the children 
of the poor need help in many ways. All 
over the country concerned people have 
eagerly awaited an analysis of the first 
results of Headstart to see if the program 
can help young children acquire the basis 
they need for the years of education to 
follow. 
Now, it Hartford, Conn., the first series 
of tests has been completed. Many 
aspects of the tests scores are encourag-
ing?some are even spectacular?and all 
are of interest in planning for our young 
people's education in the world of tomor-
row. 
Mr. President, I .ask unanimous con-
sent that an article entitled "Headstart 
Youngsters Show Remarkable IQ Im-
provement," which appeared in the Hart-
ford Courant on September 14, 1966, be 
inserted in the RECORD at this point. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
HEADSTART YOUNGSTERS SHOW REMARKABLE 
IQ IMPROVEMENT 
(By John Lacy) 
The first test results in Hartford's pre-
school child development program reveal 
"a remarkable increase" in the performance 
of many children. 
A year ago, seven of the four-year-olds 
tested had intelligence quotient (IQ) scores 
above 110 and the highest was 118. After 
nine months in the program, 21 children 
scored over 110 and five of them were above 
130. 
Also, many language difficulties were 
erased. 
"I'm really delighted," said Mrs. Jeraldine 
Withycombe, director of the federally spon-
sored "Head Start" program designed to help 
children in the city's poverty areas. "It's 
beyond what we thought we could do." 
"We're encouraged," said Dr. John Caw-
ley, head of the University of Connecticut 
Department of Special Education, who di-
rected the testing and who reported the 
preliminary results to Mrs. Withycombe,

23404 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE September 29, 1966 
"COME THROUGH" 
"This does not mean," Cawley said, "that 
the children 'got smarter,' but it is more 
likely that the pre-school program provided 
them with the experimental background 
and sophistication which enabled them to 
`come through.'" 
He found improvement also in children's 
ability with language. 
"It seems we have intervened with a re-
gression tendency?that is, a tendency for 
the children to fall further behind?while, 
at the same time, the language deficit of 
many children has been overcome," Cawley 
Said. 
After nine months in the program, three 
times as many pre-schoolers showed a level 
of intellectual ability that could lead them 
to education beyond high school. 
Last September 30 of those tested had IQ 
Scores below '75. But in May only 10 fell 
below the mark. 
"In spite of the fact that many children 
showed a remarkable increase in their per-
formance," Cawley said, "there are some who 
did not derive as much benefit." 
Three kinds of tests were used with 140 
to 150 children from five pre-school centers 
in all corners of the city. The tests meas-
tired general intellectual ability, language 
development and motor perception and mo-
tor behavior as well as social awareness. 
RESULTS nlicomisLvirr 
The results are incomplete, Cawley said, 
but he added: "I'm sure that we've gotten 
real good stuff." 
He said he knows of nowhere else in the 
country that children received such "a mas-
sive battery of tests." 
"There are some tremendous individual 
differences," he said. 
For example, he said, one child whose 
performance last September was "average" 
would be called "gifted" today. 
"In some instances, the scares of kids 
almost doubled," and still these children 
were below normal, said Cawley. "This gives 
you some idea of the deficit they have." 
On a task-performance test, some of the 
pre-schoolers scored "well above the seven-
year level," he said. "That's quite a be-
havior level for these kids." 
The child development program financed 
,mostly by federal funds through the Com-
munity Renewal Team, schooled '700 chil-
dren last year under the direction of Mrs. 
Withycombe and the Hartford Board of 
Education. 
MILWAUKEE JOURNAL CITES NEED 
FOR COMPETITIVE BIDDING 
Mr. PROXMTRE. Mr. President, a bill 
which would undermine a recent Defense 
Department decision to seek competitive 
bids for its overseas shipping is pending 
before the Senate. As I have said before, 
if this bill is called up for a vote, I in-
tend to debate it thoroughly and in ex-
treme detail because of the mischief it 
would do to sound, economic shipping 
policy. 
The Milwaukee Journal recognizes this 
proposal for what it is, "blatant special 
Interest legislation with the very purpose 
to discriminate against lake ports." 
The Journal is absolutely right. Since 
the St. Lawrence Seaway opened, the 
Great Lakes ports have had to face the 
power of coastal shipping conferences in 
attempting to get a rightful share of Gov-
ernment shipping. This discrimination 
has cost the Government and taxpayer 
millions of dollars because negotiated 
freight charges are designed to keep even 
the most inefficient ship companies sol-
vent at the expense of more progressive 
and economical Great Lakes shipping 
facilities. 
I ask unanimous consent that the edi-
torial from the September 27 issue of the 
Milwaukee Journal be inserted in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
LAKE PORTS PENALIZED 
The port of Milwaukee has had to struggle 
ever since the seaway opened to procure the 
share of government shipments that would 
most economically and efficiently move 
abroad through lake ports instead of coastal 
ones. 
One hope of progress lies in the recent de-
cision. of the defense department to avoid its 
overseas shipments by competitive bidding, 
insitead of negotiating rates with conferences 
of American flag lines as in the past. These 
conferences are dominated by coastal ship-
pers who have pretty well seen to it that the 
lakes don't get the business. 
The department is strongly supported in 
this new policy by congress' joint economic 
subcommittee on procurement, with a sizable 
cut in the department's annual $400 million 
shipping bill as reason enough. But now 
Sen. PROXMIRE (D-Wis.) sounds the alert 
again at a sly move to rule out this use of 
competitive bidding by law. 
A bill has been quickly introduced and 
quickly maneuvered onto the senate floor for 
action, he reports, that would direct the de-
partment to resume and perpetuate the old 
conference negotiation method of placing its 
shipments. This can make no pretense of 
being anything except blatant special inter-
est legislation, with the very purpose to dis-
criminate against lake ports. 
PROXMIRE has warned the majority leader 
that if the bill should be called up for pas-
sage it would "require extensive and ex-
haustive debate" to make sure of killing it?
translate filibuster?and that he will have 
some cohorts if needed. Not only lake ports 
but all taxpayers should hope he succeeds. 
TLINGIT AND HAIDA CASE MOVES 
ANOTHER STEP 
Mr. BARTLETT. Mr. President, on 
September 12, Commissioner Saul Rich-
and Gamer, of the Court of Claims, filed 
a report on the proceedings before him as 
to the amount of recovery to which the 
Tlingit and Haida Indians of Alaska are 
entitled for lands taken from them in 
southeast Alaska by the United States. 
The record for these proceedings is 
more than 50,000 pages long. The briefs 
of counsel covered more than a thousand 
pages. Mr. Gamer's findings, number-
ing 327, cover 192 pages. 
Commissioner Gamer has had a dif-
ficult task. It was his job to determine 
the value of virtually all of southeastern 
Alaska, including timber, minerals, fish-
eries and other resources, to which the 
Tlingit and Haida Indians have claimed 
aboriginal or original Indian title. Al-
though the original Court of Claims deci-
sion, that the Tlingit and Haida Indians 
are entitled to recovery, was handed 
down in October of 1959, it is under-
standable it has taken until now to make 
the evaluation which was reserved for 
further proceedings when the initial de-
cision was made. 
But this is not the end of this case. 
Commissioner Gamer's report is only a 
series of factual findings. There will 
now be exceptions and answers filed by 
counsel on both sides. This will be fol-
lowed by the filing of legal briefs. 
Finally, there will be oral argument by 
the Government and Indian attorneys 
before the five-meinber Court of Claims 
sitting en bane. 
It will not surprise anyone familiar 
with Court of Claims procedure if an-
other year goes by before a final deci-
sion is reached by the court. 
Commissioner Gamer made several 
findings of particular interest to those 
who have been following this case. The 
first of these is finding No. 315 which 
is a summary of the fair market value 
for the lands claimed by the Tlingits and 
Haidas and damages for the minerals, 
fisheries, and timber removed from the 
lands and waters prior to the taking: 
In summary, the" fair market value of plain-
tiffs' lands and waters, and their resources, 
taken by defendant, comprising all the areas 
the parties have designated as areas 1-6, 
was, as of the several taking dates, $14,034,-
953.80. Damages for the value of the min-
erals, timber and fisheries taken from plain-
tiffs' lands and waters prior to such several 
taking dates of areas 1-5, and which would 
represent compensation to plaintiffs for the 
exploitation of such lands and waters dur-
ing such pretaking periods, totaled $1,547,205. 
As to area 6, such damages resulting from 
such exploitation prior to June 19, 1935, of 
unpatented lands (or lands prior to their 
having been patented), and from, the ex-
ploitation of the fisheries of the area, totaled 
$352,210. 
The total of such amounts is $15,934,368.80. 
The second is finding 327 which is a 
summary of the value to the Indians 
reads as follows: 
In summary, on the basis of the evidence, 
the exploitable value to plaintiffs of their 
lands, waters, and resources, i.e., the amount 
the Tlingit and Haida Indians could rea-
sonably have realized had they continued 
to exercise full and complete possession and 
control of those lands and waters of south-
west Alaska which were taken from them as 
delineated in the previous proceedings, was 
$1,287,200, as follows: 
Placer gold fields  $100, 000 
Salmon fisheries  1, 000, 000 
Halibut and herring fisheries  187, 200 
Total   1, 287, 200 
The claimants, the Tlingit and Haida 
Indians of Alaska, argue that they should 
be compensated in the amount of the 
fair market value of the land at the time 
of the taking. 
The Government on the other hand 
argues that the Tlingits and Haidas 
should be compensated only on the 
"value to the Indians" basis. This is 
commonly known as the value of nuts 
and berries. 
It will be up to the court to determine 
which basis applies to the Tlingit and 
Haida case. 
Mr. President we all look forward to 
the conclusion of this case. It has been 
more than 30 years since the Congress 
enacted the first Tlingit and Haida Juris-
dictional Act. All Alaskans, especially 
the Tlingits and Haidas will welcome the 
final decision of the court.
