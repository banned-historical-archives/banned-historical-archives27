 the United Nations Charter. If it were
 riot so tragic, it would be amusing, when
 one considers the answer he has given to
 the proposal to go to a 14-nation con-
 ference, as recommended by the Presi-
 dent of France, Mr. de Gaulle. What are
 we afraid of? No one Is suggesting that
 while we are at that 14-nation Confer-
 ence we should abandon southeast Asia.
 No one is suggesting that while the Se-
 curity Council and, if necessary, the
 General Assembly consider the United
 Nations jurisdiction, we remove ourselves
 from southeast Asia, although I wish we
 would desist from our warmaking in
 southeast Asia and start a policy of
 peacekeeping.
 I would, as I have said so many times,
 while the matter is before a 14-nation
 Conference, as recommended by De
 Gaulle, or before the Security Council or
 before the General Assembly, call upon
 our alleged-and I underline the word
 "alleged"-SEATO allies to join us with
 a sufficient body of men to patrol the
 area, to keep the adversaries separate,
 and to stop the killing and warmaking
 until the procedures of the United Na-
 tions can be brought to work upon the
 threat to the peace of Asia and, poten-
 tially, the peace of the world.
 The position taken by Henry Cabot
 Lodge cannot be reconciled to any de-
 gree with the clear international obliga-
 tions of the United States under the
 United Nations Charter.
 I did not expect that the stature of the
 President of France for peacekeeping
 would rise above the stature of the Pres-
 ident of the United States; but at this
 hour, that is exactly what is happening.
 The President of France is becoming
 recognized in many areas of the world as
 more determined and dedicated to the
 cause of peace than the President of the
 United States, because the President of
 France is' calling for negotiation.  The
 President of France is calling for the
 conference table.  The President      of
 I close by saying, for the benefit of
 those who do not like my speeches and
 for the benefit of such journalists as
 Mr. Freedman, "You had better check
 it with the American people."
 I am satisfied that millions of fellow
 Americans, as they begin to understand
 the issue at stake in southeast Asia, will
 support my position.
 I can now say. along with the Senator
 from Alaska, that my mail Is running
 better than 100 to 1 in support of my
 position.  My mail is coming In from
 coast to coast. as Senators will see some
 samples  placed  in  the  CONGRESSIONAL
 RECORD from time to time.  I placed a
 large quantity in the RECORD today.  It
 is coming from the leaders of many com-
 munities in this country.
 I wish to state to President Johnson
 that I am satisfied that the American
 people do not approve of America's war-
 making policy in Asia, and that the
 American people wish the President of
 the United States to join with the Presi-
 dent of France and other advocates of
 negotiation, that we go to the conference
 table and seek to apply the rule of law
 to the crisis which exists in Asia.
 I say most respectfully to my Presi-
 dent, whom I shall continue to support
 on most issues, that I oppose him on this
 issue only because I owe a greater trust
 to my country than I owe to him.
 Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 A message from the House of Repre-

 ADDITIONAL BILL INTRODUCED
 Mr. HART by unanimous consent, in-
 troduced a bill (S. 2972) for the relief
 of Dr. David J. Sencer, U.S. Public Health
 Service, which was read twice by its title
 and referred to the Comimttee on the

 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Mc-

 behalf of the President pro tempore, an-

 the part of the Senate of the National
 Commission on Food Marketing, created
 by Senate Joint Resolution 71, the fol-

 [Mr. HRUsKA1.
 France is calling for the application of
 the rule of law to the threat of peace in
 Asia.
 The President of the United States is
 rattling the saber and telling the world
 that we are willing to risk war with Red
 China unless Asia accepts American
 policy in southeast Asia.
 I cannot understand why my Govern-
 ment cannot see, before it is too late.
 that that kind of warmaking policy on
 the part of the 'United States spells
 trouble.   Let me make It clear, as I
 close, that there is no question that we
 are joined in our outlawry by South
 Vietnam, by North Vietnam, by the
 Pathet Lao Communists in Laos, and by
 Red China.
 Does that justify our outlawry? Does
 that justify the policy of expediency ap-
 plied to international affairs which best
 describes American policy tonight in
 Asia? Does the end-justifies-the-means
 principle square with American precepts
 of foreign policy?
