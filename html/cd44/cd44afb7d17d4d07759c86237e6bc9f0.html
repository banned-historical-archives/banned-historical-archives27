				  	Ministry  Qarly  this  wQek  ~o  make  aure  of  the  real  intention  of  thQ  Chineso  aover:?me7t
				  	with  regard  to  thQ  ",~oint  development"  of  oil  resouraes  on  tho  seabed  around  Senkaku
				  	Islands  in  the  East  China  Sea.
				  	The  ministry  has  decided  to  take  this  action  as  Ambassador  H'u  reportedly  mndo  tho  remarkc		  	-
				  	la~t  week  in  Okinawa  that  Japan  and  China  should  discuss  ~oint  petroleiun  oxploitntion
				  	atvund  the  islands.    	The  Chinese  Bmbassy  in  Tokyo  Friday  disalosed  that  Ambassador  FU
				  	stated  in  Okinawa  that  it  is  high  tine  that  China  and  Japan  started  ~oint  development
				  	oi'  seabed  oi.l  reso~mces  in  the  area  around  3enkaku  Islands  without  touchinp,  on  tho  terri-
				  	torial  question,    	The  islands,  lying  in  the  East  China  Sea,  arQ  claimQd  by  both  Japan
				  	and  China.  At  the  moment  Japan  is  holding  the  islands  under  its  control.
				  	The  Foreign  Ministzy  has  decided  to  get  in  touch  with  Ambassador  HU  on  the  ",~aint  develop-
				  	ment"  on  the  basis  of  its  official  atittude,    	Since  Japan  has  concluded  an  agreement
				  	with  South  Korea  on  ~oint  development  of  the  continental  shelf  in  the  East  China  Sea,
				 	~Japan  indicated  that  it  was  ready  to  talk  about  the  demarcation  between  Japan  and  China
				  	on  the  continental  shelf.    	Although  the  Japanese  Government  had  clarified  this  attitude,
				  	there  had  been  no  response  from  China  until  Ambassador  FU  made  the  remarks  in  Okinawa
				  	last  week.    	According  to  Forei~  Ministry  sources~  it  is  believed  that  China  will  not
				  	raise  the  territorial  question  in  connection  with  the  ~oint  development  of  oil  res~urces
				  	around  Senkaku  Islands  althou~  China  has  not  recognized  Japan~s  sovereignty  over  the
				  	islands.    	China~s  official  attitude  is  that  the  solution  to  the  territorial  question  of
				  	Senkaku  Islands  should  be  left  to  future  generations.    	The  Foreign  Ministry  is  intending
				  	t o  ascertain  whether  Ambassador  Fu~s  reported  statement  really  reflected  the  decision  of
				  	Chinese  top  leaders  and  what  the  Chinese  specific  plan  is  for  the  ~oint  development.

		    	[Excerpts~   	~o~lowing  Foreign  Minister  Sonoda~s  disclosure  of  his  design  for  Japan  and
		   	China  to  ~ointly  develop  resouraes  in  the  waters  around  the  8enkaku  I3lands  as  part  of
		   	Japan~s  long-term  oil  procurement  polioies~  the  Foreign  Min~i,stry~s  business-level  workers
		   	have  begun  a  full-soale  study  of  the  possible  pro~ect.   	As  6:  basic  atep~  the  ministry  has
		    	temporarily  decided  to  set  the  zone  of  the  development  pro~eot  in  the  open  saa  outsido  of
		    	the  12-mile  territorial  waters  of  the  3enkaku  Islands  and  to  exclude  any  Taiwan-related  sea
		    	areas  from  the  2one.   	The  ministry  is  now  hastily  contactin~  ministries,  agencies,  and
		    	business  circles  concerned  to  ad~ust  their  opinions  and  consolidate  Japan~s  own  position
		    	before  making  a  proposal  to  China  for  a  ~oint  survey  prugram.   	The  ministry  has  already
		    	sounded  out  China  on  the  development  pro~ect  through  unaff icial  channels  and  received  the
		    	impression  that  it  basically  favors  the  pro~ect.   	Thus,  the  ministry  now  believes  rhat  a
		    	fundamental  agreoment  can  be  reached  with  China  with  regard  to  the  development  plan.    	How-
		    	ever,  some  officials  in  the  ministry  hold  the  view  that  it  will  take  quite  a  while  ta  im-
		    	plement  the  plan  due  to  many  uncertain  factors,  such  as  Taiwan~s  claim  to  territorial
		    	~~igt?ts  in  the  Senkaku  Islands  and  China~s  funding  capabilities.
		    	In  this  context,  to  keep  the  selection  of  the  development  zone  from  becoming  a  crucial  point
		    	and  to  avoid  a  dispute  over  territoria2  rights,  the  ministry  has  this  time  deci~~fed  to  set
		    	ur,  the  development  zone  in  the  open  sea.    	Sy  excluding  territorial  waters  from  the  develop-
		    	ment  aone,  Japan  believes  that  it  can  retain  its  "the-Senkakus-are-Japan~s-inherent-terri-
		    	tcry"  pos�~ion  and  at  the  same  time  avoid  the  revival  of  arguments  over  territorial  rights
		    	betwee~.  Japan  and  China.    	The  two  countries  had  virtually  agreed  to  shelve  the  territorial
		    	issue  at  the  time  of  negotiations  last  year  on  their  treaty  of  peace  and  friendship.
		    	However,  China  has  shown  no  oP~'icial  respcnse  yet  to  this  Japanese  plan.    	At  a  meeting  with
		    	vi;iting  Japan  Socialist  Party  Vice  Chairm&n Shimohira  last  month~  Chinese  Vice  Premier  Li
		    	Xiannian  expressed  his  support  for  the  ~uint  development  pro~ect,  saying  that  the  dispute
		    	o~er  territorial  rights  should  be  ahelved.   	Through  Mr  Seigo  Hamano  of  the  Liberal  Democratic
		    	F..~ty  and  several  other  nonofficial  channels,  China  has  indicated  its  active  response.
		    	Therefore,  the  Foreign  Ministry  now  believes  that  the  two  countries  will  be  able  to  reach
		     	a  finai  agreement  on  the  development  pian.
