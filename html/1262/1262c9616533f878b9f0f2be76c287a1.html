 General Torrijos received the support he
 wanted during his three-day conference with the
 presidents of Colombia, Costa Rica, and Vene-
 zuela. At the close of the meeting on Monday,
 the chief e' jcutives signed a "Declaration of
 Panama" p',edging support for Panama's aspira-
 tions in the canal treaty negotiations with the
 US and calling on other Latin American govern-
 ments to make the same commitment.
 Colombia promised to give up its claim to
 special canal privileges, once Panama signs a new
 treaty with the US. In return, Torrijos offered
 to grant citizens and products of both Colombia
 and Costa Rica that transit the canal exemption
 from any taxes and duties not levied on Pana-
 manians. Panama will also permit navy ships and
 war materiel of the two countries to pass
 through the canal withou. paying tolls.
 The declaration also favorably noted Latin
 American efforts to solve the region's maritime
 transportation problems, and Colombia, Costa
 Rica, and Panama agreed to give special priority
 to the economic deveiopment of their common
 border areas.
 A second joint communique, issued on
 Tuesday, covered the other topics the four lead-
 ers discussed. The document was largely an
 endorsement of positions taken by Venezuelan
 President Perez and Mexican President Eche-
 verria in their declaration in Mexico City on
 March 23. It criticized the US Trade Act, called
 for reforms of the inter-American system, and
 urged greater cooperation among Latin Ameri-
 can countries.
 The three  visiting presidents drafted a
 letter to President Ford containing the text of
 their declaration and urging the US to do every-
 thing possible to reach an early conclusion of a
 new canal agreement. Another letter wiil solicit
 expressions of support for Panama from all
 Latin American chiefs of state who were not at
 the meeting.
 Panama's campaign for backing is being
 directed at international bodies as well as at
 individual states. Torrijos believes that the UN
 Security Council meeting in Panama in March
 1973 was a key step in getting Panama's case
 before a worldwide audience, and he very much
 wants the Security Council seat that Costa Rica
 will vacate later this year. He has claimed that
 his three guests promised their countries' votes
 to Panama. Arrentina remains the leading candi-
 date for the seat, however.

 South Vietnam: A Bleak Picture
 The government's remaining positions in
 the northern two thirds of South Vietnam are
 collapsing rapidly following President Thieu's
 decision to shift abruptly to a strategy of mili-
 tary retrenchment.
 Thieu had concluded that h:s forces in the
 highlands were not only overextended and un-
 dersupplied but were facing a greatly superior
 Nrrth Vietnamese force. He decided two weeks
 ago to concentrate his troops along the northern
 and central coasts and around Saigon, where
 th.-y could protect the bulk of the population.
 Thieu clearly wanted to take the communists by
 surprise, extracting his forces before the com-
 munists could tie them dowr or block their way
 out. He appears to have given no thought to
 preparing the ground with h's own generals,
 however, and he caught them completely by
 surprise, too.  In any event, the enemy has
 moved quickly to disrupt the South Vietnamese
 withdrawals, while the government's senior mili-
 tary leaders have reacted with dismay. Their
 lack of confidence has been reflected down
 through the ranks. With no prior planning or
 preparation, the withdrawals have not been or-
 derly. Most of the governmert forces have been
 cut off from each other and have been seized by
 an evacuation  mentality, moving in disarray
 along routes choked with civilian refugee traffic.
 The South  Vietnamese have not stood and
 fought, and most casualties have been suffered
 by units fleeing heavy contact on the coast or
 trying to escape past communist blocking posi-
 tions on the edge of the highlands.
 The situation in Military Region 1 is partic-
 ularly bleak for Saigon. Government forces have
 evacuated virtually the whole region, attempting
 to hold only an enclave around Da Nang. Per-
 haps over a million refugees have poured into
 the city during the last week, however, and law
 and order and essential services are breaking
 down.  Stragglers  from  retreating  units  are
 staging shootouts with police am?.i panicky ~m,ob

 city, while remnants of two others are coming in
 from nearby, but it is questionable whether even
 the Marines and the still intact 3rd Division will
 fight well when they learn of the extent of the
 collapse of all the forces around them. Two
 fresh communist divisions west of the city are
 preparing to attack, and a third appears to be
 coming south to join them.
 The picture in Military Region 2 is only
 slightly less bleak. The forces attempting to

 Refugees near Nha Trang flee southward
 escape the highlands have been badly mauled,
 and the communists have an enormous local
 advantage, with five divisions facing just over
 one effective division on the government side.
 Nha prang and the other enclaves will probably
 fall soon unless reinforcements are sent, and this
 seems unlikely in view of the high priority the
 government gives to the defense of Saigon.
 The government enjoys an overall advan-
 tage in forces around Saigon and in the delta, at
 least for the moment, and it is possible that
 some of the forces currently in Da Nang will be
 extracted and regrouped to help defend the
 southern heartland. The government, however,
 must soon make a decision whether to allow the
 25th Division to remain around Tay Ninh City
 to defend that symbolically important town or
 to pull it back to strengthen a somewhat con-
 tracted defensive arc closer to Saigon.
 The collapse of South Vietnam's armies in
 the northern two thirds of the country has
 occurred with such speed that the full magni-
 tude of the disa;ter has not yet registered in
 Saigon. Thieu has proposed a cabinet reshuffle
 of a kind that might have served to broaden the
 base of his government in more normal times,
 but such measures fall far shot of the mark in
 the light of present realities. Immediately fol-
 lowing an announcement by former vice presi-
 dent Ky that he was coming out of retirement
 to engage in political activity again, a number of
 political figures were arrested amid charges in
 the press of coup plotting. It seems unlikely that
 any of the individuals involved would have the
 clout to mount a serious coup plot, and the
 arrests may have been intended by Thieu as a
 warning to others. There is presently no evi-
 dence of coup plotting among those who do
 have the power-the senior military leaders-and
 indeed there seems to be some recognition of
 the dangers that a coup attempt would entail.
 Thieu is undoubtedly already discredited
 with many of his senior commanders, however,
 and the mood in Saigon is likely to turn ugly as
 news from the north continues to spread. The
 communists are beginning to try to sow add-
 itional seeds of discord, with the Provisional
 Revolutionary Government offering amnesty to
 those who take even limited steps of accommo-
 dation with them-for example, by supporting
 third-force  movements.

 The ~!ital US airlift came under new attack
 from an unexpected quarter. Leadh  officials in
 the new Thai government told newsmen in
 Bangkok of their reservations over the use of
 Thai soil for the transshipment of military
 equipment to Phnom Penh. So far, Bangkok has
 taken  no official  action against the airlift,
 indicating that the press statements may have
 been meant only for public consumption while
 Thai officials continue to look the other way as
 the ammunition flights go on. This strategy
 could  unravel, however, if Bangkok's free-
 wheeli. y press nr the new government's politi-
 cal opponents chrse to make the airlift an issue.
 A more direct threat to the airlift material-
 ized at midweek as Cambodian army units aban-
 doned the town of Tuol Leap, allowing the
 Khmer Communists once more to move within
 artillery range of Pochentong airport. Rocket
 attacks halted the airlift last w'ekend, but the
 resumption of more accurate artillery fire poses
 a serious possibility that the communists may be

 Government forces also gave ground on
 other battlefronts around Phnom Penh this
 week. Along the Mekong River, two government
 battalions withdrew from positions opposite the
 main navy headquarters, following several weeks
 of steady insurgent attacks, and the navy evac-
 uated ground units from two garrison towns
 farther upstream. Communist units on the east
 bank continue to hit downtown Phnom Penh
 with daily rocket attacks.
 Along  the  lower  Mekong,  communist
 gunners are continuing to pound the govern-
 ment enclave stretching between the towns of
 Banam and Ne.k Luong. So far, the 4,000
 government defenders have repulsed insurgent
 efforts to cut the enclave in half.
 On the -political front, the government has
 announced the completion of the cabinet re-
 shuffle. The major change was the naming of
 aimed forces chief of staff Sak Sutsakhan as
 defense minister, Sutsakhan was also named
 deputy  prime minister,  a  move apparently
 designed to emphasize his civilian role and the
 government's increased control over the military
 establishment. The only other changes of signifi-
 cance were the appointment of Socio-Repub-
 lican strong man Hang Thun Hak as a second
 deputy prime minister and the removal of the
 notoriously  corrupt  interior  minister,  Ek
 Proeung. The new ministerial announcements
 went largely unnoticed amid the increasing spec-
 LAOS: JITTERY RIGHTISTS
 The deteriorating military  situation  in
 South Vietnam and Cambodia is giving Lao
 rightist politicians and generals the jitters. Coali-
 tion Defense Minister Sisouk na Champassak
 and northern region commander General Vang
 Pao are despondent. They are bitterly critical of
 the lack of congressional support for the Thieu
 and Lon Nol regimes and are. seriously worried
 about continuing US support to the non-com-
 munist side in Laos.
 Sisouk, Vano Pao, and probably many
 other non-communists apparently fear that, at a
 minimum, communist battlefield successes else-
 where in Indochina will embolden Pathet Lao
 members of the coalition government to adopt a
 more aggressive political posture in pursuit of
 their major policy objectives.
 Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, how-
 ever, is viewing recent developments in South
 Vietnam and Cambodia with equanimity. He
 probably believes that the rapidly declining mili-
 tary fortunes of the Saigon and Phnom Penh
 governments vindicates his two-year-old policy
 of national reconciliation and political accom-

 Laos cannot rely on continued US support and

 CHINA: EARTHQUAKE
 The major earthquake that rocked part of
 northeast China on February 4 caused wide-
 years, it registered 7.3 on the Richter scale and
 was sharp enough to be felt in Peking, Seoul,
 and eastern Siberia. Unlike the other two
 quakes, which occurred in the remote west and
 southwest, it jolted a densely populated and
 highly industrialized area in southern Liaoning
 Province.
 Characteristically Peking has maintained
 silence on the amount of damage, but otherwise
 the quake has been accorded the highest level of
 attention given any natural disaster in recent
 years, suggesting that the impact of the quake
 was much greater than has been acknowledged
 publicly. A Politburo member and ranking vice
 premier, Teng Hsiao-ping, reportedly visited the
 site and assigned a fellow Politburo member and
 vice premier, Hua Kuo-feng, to deal with the
 problem.

 PORTUGAL: LEADERSHIP CHANGES
 Coi.imunist  representation  in  the
 Portuguese government increased this week with
 the naming of a new cabinet, although moder-
 ates had some qualified success in retainhrg
 influence in both the cabinet and the more
 important and powerful Armed Forces Revolu-
 tionary Council.
 The new cabinet chosen by Prime Minister
 Goncalves comprises 13 civilians and 3 military
 officers. A breakdown of the cabinet according
 to party affiliation of the 13 civilian ministers
 shows that the posts were allotted equally to the
 four members of the coalition-the Communist
 Party, the Portuguese Democratic Movement,
 the Popular Democratic Party, and the Socialist
 Party. Each received one ministry wit;iout port-
 folio and one other post. Of the remaining five
 civilian ministers, three are moderate-technical
 experts-and two are Communist sympathizers.
 The latter two are in positions important to the
 Communists-- the economic coordination and
 agriculture posts.
 The announcement of the new cabinet was
 delayed because the Social;sts threatened to
 withdraw from the government coalition if their
 demands for representation were not met. The
 Popular  Dernocraiic  Party threaten d to follow
 suit.
 A leading moderate in the Armed Forces
 Movement, Major Ernesto Melo Antunes, re-
 places Socialist Party leader Mario Soares as
 foreign minister. Scares wrd now be a minister
 without portfolio. Another prominent Move-
 ment moderate, Major Vitor Alves, will report-
 edly  be  namod  ambassador  to  the  United
 Nations.
 Altiiough the Revolutionary Council has
 virtual dictatorial powers, the cabinet is still
 important in terms of day-to-day administra-
 tion. President Costa Gomes said this week that
 the Coi'ncil's role might be reduced if the cabi-
 net proves it can take decisive action to imple-
 ment reforms.
 The  Revolutionary Council  as  initially
 constituted, was made up of Prim.. Minister
 Goncalves, Continental Operations Command
 Chief Brigadier General Carvalho, seven mem-
 bers each from the former Junta of National
 Salvation  and  the  Movement  Coordinating
 Committee, and eight lesser ranking officers.
 The concern of military moderates over the radi-
 cal posture of the new Council brought pressure
 that resulted last Saturday in the inclusion of
 four additional officers-three of them consid-
 ered moderates, among them majors Antunes
 and Vitor Alves. Participation of the three new
 moderate members in Council decisions may be
 limited, however, because of their other duties.
 None of the members of the Revolutionary
 Council is known to be a communist, although
 Goncalves  and Carvalho are believed to be
 strongly influenced by them. Five of the seven
 members from the junta are known to favor
 socialism but to oppose the Movement radicals.
 The  remaining  two  are reputed  to have a

 pro communist Was. Members from the Coordi-
 nating Committee range from extreme leftists to
 strong  anti-communists,  with  a  reasonably
 balanced representation that reflects the narrow
 Portuguese political spectrum.
 Little  is known  about the eight lower
 ranking officers in the new Council although
 one has been a secretary to Prime Minister
 Goncalves    and  another  an aide to General
 Carvalho.  ,^,  third is believed to be a member of
 a communist labor group and a fourth to have
 anti-uJS views.
 At the swearing-in ceremony for the new
 cabinet   this week, Gonca!ves announced that
 efforts to nationalize "basic sectors" of the
 economy would continue. Although he did not
 specify the sectors affected, he said the areas in
 which private enterprise would be allowed to
 expand would be delineated. The Portuguese
 leadership, including the Socialists and other
 moderates, appears unified in its determination
 to eradicate special privilege among the mem-
 bers of the oligarchy.
 Goncalves  also warned  that Portugal is
 living beyond its means and that it faces "a
 regime of total austerity." He said the govern-
 ment would present a program to deal with
 unemployment and devise a price and incomes
 policy.
 The resumption of intercommunal negoti-
 ations between Greek and Turkish Cypriots,
 which was called for by the UN Security Coun-
 cil resolution of March 12, has been delayed
 following disagreement over the venue and level
 of the talks.
 The Greek Cypriots, who are anxious to
 have the, t'N play as large a role as possible, at
 first insisted on New York as a negotiating site,
 but they are now willing to settle for Geneva.
 The Turkish Cypriots, however, are trying to
 minimize the role of the UN--and particularly
 that of Secretary General Waldheim-and have
 proposed Rome, Vienna, or even Tehran. They
 have also threatened to replace Rauf Denktash
 as negotiator whir someone of lesser stature.
 Such a move would be aimed at supporting
 Denktash's contention that as president of the
 recently proclaimed Federated Turkish State of
 Cyprus he is equal to President Makarios and
 can no longer negotiate with Glafkos Clerides,
 who holds a lower rank. If Denktash is replaced,
 the Greek Cypriots are likely to retaliate by
 appointing a new negotiator.
 The replacement of Clerides and Denktash
 with individuals of lesser stature would deal a
 serious setback to the talks and increase the
 likelihood  that  Athens  and  Ankara  would
 become more directly involved. The UN special
 envoy to Cyprus, Luis Weckmann, is consulting
 with the two sides in an effort to get the talks
 esumed.
 In the meantime, relations between Athens
 and Ankara remain strained as both sides con-
 tinue to trade charges. Athens this week pro-
 tested what it termed provocative actions by
 Turkey in Thrace and the Aegean, while Ankara
 claimed the Greeks were illegally building up
 their military forces in the Aegean.

 ITALY: COMMUNIST CONGRESS
 Enrico Ikrliuguer (r) wit h Communist leaders Lanai (I) arid Torforclia
 Ihe  Italian Communist  Party's national
 congress, which ended on March 23, was clearly
 intended to calm fears that Curnrnunisl partici-
 pation in the governn'ent would threaten Italian
 democracy and jeopardize Rome's ties with the
 West. I he Communists had trouble getting their
 point across, however, because of ti,_: growing
 controversy over the implications for Italy of
 recent events in Portugal.
 Communist  chief  l_3erlinguer's  speeches
 were conciliatory in tone arid emphasized his
 gradualist approach to achieving it direct voice in
 the government. He called again for an "historic
 compromise" that would bring  Italy's three
 largest parties Christian Democrat, Conurru-
 nists,               and Socialists---together in a governing
 coalition. Berhnguer made it clear, however,
 that he is in ' no hurry" a point reflected in the
 final congress (Iocument, which called merely
 for a "more structured" relationship between
 the Communists and the governing parties. This
 is the Communists' 'Nay of saying that they
 would be satisfied for the time being win a
 limited concession such as formalized c.-)nsulta-
 tions on legislative maters.
 Differences between the Communists and
 the governing parties have narrowed in recent
 years on some domestic issues, such as economic
 policy, and this has left disagreements on for-
 eign policy the major substantive obstacle to
 broader  participation  by  the Communists.
 Berlinguer  therefore  highlighted  the recent
 change in the party line on NA-10, claiming, for
 example, that Italy's defense ties would not
 become all issue if the Cotntnunisls are idnritted
 to the gover rurrent. ;-Ie stressed, however, the
 party's expectation  that detente would  load
 eventually to the dissoltrtic,n of both NATO and
 the Warsaw Pact and reiterated the Co.111nunists'
 support for it unified Europe independent of
 both the US all(] the USSR.
 To the Cornrnunists' chagrin, discussion of
 these issues was largely obscured by the dispute
 that developed over their initial failure to criti-
 cize the Lisbon regime for banning Portugal's
 Christian  Democratic Party. When Heilinguer
 sidestepped the issue in his opening speech, the
 Italian Cli istian Democrats pulled their observ-
 ers out of the congress, charging that ''commu-
 nism has riot changed."
 The timing of the Lisbon events could not
 have been worse for h erlinguer grid the Comrntr-
 nists. They had hoped that their conciliatory
 posture would make it more difficult for the
 Christian Democrats to argue effectively against
 Communist participation in a future government
 in  Rome.  Instead,  the Christian Dennocrats
 pointed to the Portuguese situation as evidence
 of what happens when Communists gain sub-
 stantial influence in a government. The Christian
 Democrats seemed ready to make the matter a
 major issue in their campaign for the crucial
 local elections set for June.
