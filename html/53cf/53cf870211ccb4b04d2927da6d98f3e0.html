 UGANDA:  Situation Report
 I        I According to Radio Uganda, President Amin asserted
 to ay    at the Americans are free to go anywhere they like,
 inside or outside Uganda.
 25X1           II The Ugandan charge in Washington, who has taken a
 re axe   position throughout the affair, also has asserted that
 US citizens in Uganda were free to leave the country whenever
 they wished.
 Amin's second postponement of his meeting with the
 Americans may be the result of problems in organizing the meet-
 ing, a further effort by Amin to garner more international at-
 tention for the session, or Amin's growing preoccupation with
 his own internal troubles.

 Amin, who repeatedly   inks the     and Israel in his
 bombastic speeches, has publicly drawn a connection between
 the invasion he alleges the US is planning and the Israeli
 rescue operation.
 On the other hand, Amin, citing similar meetings he
 has   a     with other expatriate communities, has publicly reiter-
 ated assurances that the US citizens are in no danger and that
 he only wants to express his gratitude for their service in
 Uganda. Amin met with several US employees of Ugandan airlines
 yesterday and praised them for their contribution to Uganda.
 Amin has also acknowledged receipt of messages from several
 African and Arab heads of state by assuring them of the safety
 of the US citizens.
 I            A Tass broadcast criticizing the US naval presence
 in the   n ian ocean alleges that the US fleet is threatening
 East African countries,  including Uganda. This is the first
 public Soviet comment on the current situation in Uganda, but
 it appears to have been added to the article as an after-
 thought.  The brief comment stops short of defending ;min's
 action against Americans in Uganda but it does imply that
 they are not being detained.
 More authoritative Soviet comment may not be forth-
 coming until either the OA U or the African states being courted
 by the USSR take a public stand. The Soviets themselves have
 been the victim of Amin's erratic behavior and almost certainly
 do not want to take the lead in defending Amin's latest adven-
 ture.

 CUBA-UGANDA:  Cubans Allegedly in Uganda
 25X6
 //If Cuban military personnel are in Kampala,  their
 L
 u?ies are likely to include flying and maintaining Soviet-sup-
 plied fighter aircraft and setting up and manning an air defense
 system. Setting up an air defense system was also one of the
 first activities the Cubans undertook in Angola. The Ugandans
 already have some antiaircraft artillery.//
 Since opening an embassy in Kampala a little over a
 year ago, Cuba has demonstrated mounting interest in Uganda.
 The Cubans probably hope to establish a broad range of contacts
 in the Ugandan military, which would leave them in a good posi-
 tion regardless of Amin's tenure in office.
 //The first sign of possible military coopera-
 tion between the two countries came in late January--before the
 current ferment in Uganda. The Cubans sent an unusually high-
 ranking military officer--Deputy Armed Forces Minister Francisco  25X1
 Cabrera--to head the delegation to the sixth anniversary of the
 Uganda military government.
 According to a press report, another Cuban military
 e egation visited Uganda early last week. We cannot confirm
 this visit, but a Cuban delegation led by Division General Ar-
 naldo Ochoa--who heads Cuba's Western Army--arrived in Ethiopia
 on February 23 and may have been proceeding from Uganda. Ochoa
 has been used by the Cubans in the past to arrange military aid
 to several African countries.

 I     I The chief Soviet negotiator at the Sino-Soviet border
 talks, Deputy Foreign Minister Leonid Ilichev,  left China for
 home yesterday following three months of apparently fruitless
 talks. He was seen off by his Chinese counterpart,  Vice Foreign
 Minister Yu Chan.
 I     I There had been speculation in Peking for several
 weeks that Ilichev would leave soon because of the lack of pro-
 gress in the talks.  He is scheduled to accompany Soviet Pres-
 ident Podgorny on a visit to Africa in mid-March.
 I     I Ilichev arrived in Peking last November after an ab-
 sence o   18 months, the longest since the talks began in Octo-
 ber 1969.  The Soviets seemed pleased with widespread press
 speculation that his return to Peking signaled imminent prog-
 ress in the long-stalemated border issue.  The speculation was
 based largely on the fact that Ilichev's return came soon after
 Mao Tse-tung's death and the purge of China's leadinq leftists.
 I IThe Chinese, on the other hand, were quick to point
 out that they expected little from Ilichev's return. They fre-
 quently reiterated their major foreign policy objectives, one
 of which is firm opposition to what they see as Soviet "expan-
 sionism." Privately,  the Chinese told foreign officials in Pe-
 king that the Soviet negotiator brought no meaningful new pro-
 posals to the table and that Chinese attitudes on the border
 issue remained as firm as ever. China also asserted that the
 USSR's positive characterizations of the talks were intended
 for Washington's benefit.

 Leaders of three "Eurocommunist" parties--Berlinguer
 of Italy, Marchais of France, and Carrillo of Spain--are plan-
 ning a two-day summit meeting in Madrid beginning Wednesday.
 Their intention apparently is to meet privately and then hold
 a press conference.  They have not asked the Spanish government's
 permission, and Madrid may still try to prevent the meeting.
 The main purpose of the meeting is to highlight the
 position of the Spanish party, which is waiting for the supreme
 court to rule on its legal status before the legislative elec-
 tion this spring. In addition, the three leaders almost cer-
 tainly will discuss dissidence and political repression in the
 USSR and Eastern Europe. They may not take a public stand on
 this issue.  If they do, none seems likely to diverge much from
 the positions he has taken in the past.

 I                 /The Soviet and Czechoslovak regimes are already
 annoye    y persistent criticism from the West European communist
 parties. The Soviets may fear that the summit will strengthen
 the concept of Eurocommunism and that it will give dissidents
 the idea that their struggle is backed by a regional center of
 Western communists.                                         the Soviets
 are trying hard to prevent the Western parties from adopting
 stronger positions against political repression by the Soviet
 and East European regimes.//
 Each of the three parties has some compelling domes-
 tic reasons for repeating their past criticisms of the USSR.
 The Spanish party wants to remind the supreme court both that
 it has no formal ties to the USSR and that it has long been the
 most outspoken Western party in criticizing the Soviets. The
 French party,  facing a crucial election next year, is trying
 hard to erase its reputation as the most pro-Soviet party in
 the West. The Italian party is under constant challenge from
 Christian Democrats and Socialists to prove that it has also
 broken its ties with Moscow.
 //At the same time, the Italians have no intention
 of courting trouble either with Moscow or with the minority of
 Italian Communists who are still uncritically pro-Soviet. Top
 party leaders draw a careful distinction between individual in-
 stances of repression and the Eastern brand of communism, re-
 fusing to admit that repression is a product of the system.
 Gianni Cervetti,  a Berlinguer lieutenant, recently promised So-
 viet leaders that Italian party handling of the civil liberties
 question would be restrained.//
 I                  IAlthough Marchais has been making headlines by criti-
 cizing   rague's handling of the Charter 77 human rights advo-
 cates, the French party leadership has also clearly underlined
 the distinction between single cases of repression and the sys-
 tem.
 I I Both Italian and French communists admit that they
 cannot give up the idea that the establishment of the Soviet
 state and system was a landmark in history.  They are likely to
 hold to this line, whatever problems it may cause.  Indeed, de-
 spite their immediate problems with Soviet policy,                     they consider
 that Soviet power is a long-range factor working in their favor.
 It is not certain that Carrillo shares this view.

 Carrillo,  in fact,  is under intense domestic pressure
 to demonstrate his party's independence from the Soviets with
 a strong condemnation of Soviet and East European repression.
 arrillo has admitted that he
 cannot pre ict     what Marchais and Berlinguer will agree to put
 into the communique, but by making his own views clear in ad-
 vance he probably hopes to gain credit even if the other
 leaders soft-pedal the issue. Other Spanish communists have
 also reportedly been making it a point to speak harshly of the
 USSR and even to question whether the Soviet system can be de-
 scribed as socialist.
 Thus the Madrid summit can be expected to produce a
 restatement of views already set down at bilateral meetings of
 party leaders.  It will exploit the symbolism of Eurocommunism,
 an appelation that the Western parties evidently find useful
 and that disturbs the Soviets.  Beyond this, no challenge to
 Moscow is likely.
 For their part, the Soviets clearly would prefer not     25X1
 to aggravate their quarrel with the Western parties and are
 unlikely to pick a fight so long as the latter avoid direct
 criticism of Moscow.
 SOUTH KOREA:  Anticipating Dissidence

 this month the university students return to the campuses after
 a long winter vacation.  In the past, the return of the students

 //In an apparent effort to head off any sig-
 nificant resumption of protest activity,  the Pak government is
 now backing off from the selective relaxation of political con-
 trols it began late last year. Pak's tougher stance recently
 appears to be a warning to dissidents that turmoil will not be
 tolerated during the spring months.//
 //Actions the government has taken to warn po-
 tential demonstrators include a series of tough law-and-order
 statements by top officials, some by Pak himself;  several
 fairly harsh court sentences for violators of Emergency Meas-
 ure 9, the 1975 law that includes bans against the ;spreading

 JAPAN - SOUTH KOREA:  Relations
 I               The South Korean government seems convinced that the
 high officials it sent to Japan in February helped to shore up
 Japanese support for South Korea.
 South Korea's major objective in sending the foreign
 minister,       the speaker of the National Assembly, and former
 prime minister Kim Chong-pil to Japan apparently was to obtain
 more forthright assurances from the Japanese that Tokyo is op-
 posed to early US troop withdrawals from Korea. The South Kore-
 ans were dissatisfied with diffident Japanese public statements
 on the issue during Vice President Mondale's visit to Tokyo.

 ANGOLA-ZAIRE:  Relations
 President Neto of Angola appears to have no intention
 of improving relations with Zaire as long as he is faced with
 a serious insurgency.
 I     I Despite President Mobutu's announcement in early Jan-
 uary    a                        he was recognizing Neto's government, and despite
 Zairian steps to reduce support. sharply for Angolan dissident
 groups, both Neto and his foreign minister have in the past two
 weeks criticized Zaire for permitting Angola's enemies to oper-
 ate from bases inside Zaire. Neto recently accused the US of
 sending soldiers to Zaire to prepare for a military attack on
 Angola.
 While Mobutu says he is not worried, Neto's strong
 antipathy for him,  stemming from the Angolan civil war, remains
 a barrier to better relations.  In addition, relations will be
 strained by the insurgency in Angola, which will continue for
 some time, no matter what Mobutu does to prevent help from
 reaching the insurgents from Zaire.
 All three insurgent groups,  the Cabindan guerrillas,
 Holden Roberto's National  Front,  and Jonas Savimbi's National
 Union, could probably continue their present levels of activity.

 Morocco's decision to suspend participation: in all
 the activities of the Organization of African Unity will hamper
 its efforts to prevent OAU consideration of the Western Sahara
 problem.
 Moroccan Foreign Minister Laraki declared on Friday
 that Rabat's action was a protest against the dissemination by
 the OAU of a report charging Morocco and Gabon with complicity
 in the abortive coup in Benin on January 16. Morocco was also
 protesting the attendance at a recent OAU ministerial meeting
 of representatives of the Polisario Front,  the group that is
 carrying on insurgency against Moroccan and Mauritanian control
 in Western Sahara.
 The Benin report was the principal reason for the Mo-
 roccan--action. A senior Foreign Ministry official privately told
 US diplomats that Morocco had been prepared to limit its protest
 of Polisario presence at the meeting to boycotting the opening
 session. He emphasized that the Moroccan action does not consti-
 tute withdrawal from the OAU.
 The Moroccans apparently believe that neither their
 action nor the Benin report will have much effect on Algeria's
 effort to win sympathy on the Western Sahara issue.  The official
 noted that Mauritania would defend Moroccan interests with re-
 gard to Western Sahara in the OAU.
 The Moroccans probably are over-optimistic. Algeria
 will certainly exploit the Benin report in its efforts to press
 its case on the Western Sahara and to portray Morocco as linked
 to "imperialism." While Algeria has been unable to promote much
 enthusiasm for the Polisario cause among the Black African
 states, sensitivity to outside interference in African affairs
 could lead some states to reassess their positions on the West-
 ern Sahara.
