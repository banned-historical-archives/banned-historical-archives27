 S 7588                   CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 policy, and introduce others to the
 American way of life. It permits them
 to serve the cause of freedom by pre-
 senting the truth. But it does so
 within our fiscal limits.
 For USIA, we added to the freeze
 level a small amount for an enhanced
 book program and a portion of the
 money necessary for Voice of America
 modernization. These are essentially
 capital expenditures, necessary if our
 country's voice is to be heard at all. In
 addition, following Senator PELL's 1982
 amendment,  we  increased  the  ex-
 change program-but, with his gener-
 ous support, by only half of what
 would have been required. The overall
 result for USIA is a figure of $835 mil-
 lion, 14-percent below the administra-
 tion request of $973 million, and 9-per-
 cent below the House figure. For 1987
 we again froze at 1986 levels, with only
 one exception-a $10 million increase
 to meet the Pell requirement. the $845
 million in our bill is 27-percent below
 the administration's request.
 For Radio Free Europe and Radio
 Liberty we authorized $137 million, $5
 million below the administration re-
 quest. Again, we froze salaries and ex-
 penses, adding to this the funding re-
 quired this year and next for modern-
 ization. of transmitters. Without mod-
 ernization the radios cannot be heard
 clearly, and if they cannot be heard
 clearly other expenses on them are un-
 justified.
 Mr. President, S. 1003 also contains
 several other sections that are worth
 mentioning. It authorizes continued
 funding for the Asia Foundation and
 for the National Endowment for De-
 mocracy. It makes improvements in
 international narcotics control, in our
 refugee program, and in the training
 of our diplomats. It creates a frame-
 work for an undergraduate scholar-
 ship program. It is, I' believe, a bill
 which authorizes a sound structure for
 the conduct of foreign affairs, in a fis-
 cally prudent manner. It has the bi-
 partisan support of our committee,
 and we urge its adoption by the full
 Senate.
 Mr. President, the foreign relations
 authorization bill is an occasion to
 consider not only the management but
 also the direction of our foreign af-
 fairs. Before we begin.the detailed dis-
 cussion of other amendments to the
 bill we will turn to the various amend-
 ments on Nicaragua outlined, along
 with time limits, in the unanimous-
 consent agreement.
 Mr. President, as Members know a
 unanimous-consent  agreement  has
 been entered into in order that full
 debate might occur on Nicaragua, and
 many Senators will - want to address
 our foreign policy considerations with
 regard to that country.
 Following those amendments, I un-
 derstand that it is the intent of the
 leadership to proceed to discuss all
 other relevant amendments to the
 measure before us and to complete
 action today. I believe that all of us
 welcome that challenge and that op-
 portunity.
 There are provisions for specific
 time  allotted  to  the  sponsors  of
 amendments under the unanimous-
 consent agreement. I know that each
 sponsor of an amendment will want a
 full hearing, and each is entitled to a
 full hearing. This is important busi-
 ness, and the arguments should be
 made part of the RECORD.
 For my part, I will attempt to limit
 debate on our side substantially, so
 that the time now allotted to the Nica-
 raguan debate might be curtailed. This
 will not be meant to demean anyone's
 amendment, but simply to push us
 toward completion of the entire au-
 thorization bill today.
 Mr. President, I suggest that Mem-
 bers might wish to listen in their of-
 fices, if they are not on the. floor, to
 the initial debate on the amendment
 that is to be offered by the distin-
 guished Senator from Connecticut. He
 has been a careful student of the
 issues involved, as have Mr. KENNEDY,
 Mr. HART, and Mr. BIDEN.
 In  the  event  that  any  Senator
 should not wish to offer an amend-
 ment already provided for, I would
 like to have some notice-and .I am
 certain that Senator PELL would join
 in this-of what we might expect, in
 order that we can schedule the affairs
 of the day and expedite business for
 all Members.
 Mr.  President,  I  ask my. distin-
 guished colleague, Senator PELL, if he
 has any opening thoughts, preliminary
 to the amendment to be- offered by
 Senator DODD.
 Mr. PELL. I thank the chairman.
 Mr. President, today the Senate will
 begin its consideration of S. 1003, a bill
 authorizing appropriations for the De-
 partment of State, the U.S. Informa-
 tion Agency and the Board for Inter-
 national Broadcasting for fiscal years
 1986 and 1987.
 The total amounts authorized by
 this. legislation are $3.76 billion for
 fiscal year 1986 and $3.77 billion for
 fiscal year 1987. These figures are over
 $251 million below the administra-
 tion's fiscal year 1986 request and $311
 million below the fiscal year 1987 re-
 quest. Despite these substantial reduc-
 tions, it is the belief of the committee
 that this bill will provide the U.S. for-
 eign policy and information agencies
 with the resources necessary to carry
 out their diverse and important man-
 dates.
 The bulk of the funding authorized
 by this legislation-over .$2.7 billion in
 fiscal year 1986 and fiscal year 1987-
 is contained'in title I. This money will
 be used to fund the operations of the
 State Department,'pay the U.S. share
 of the assessed contributions to the
 United Nations and 43 other interna-
 tional organizations, finance the U.S.
 participation  in   16  international
 boundary and fishery commissions,
 and pay for the U.S. Migration and
 Refugee Assistance Program.
 June 6, 1 985
 S. 1003 also contains in titles II, III,
 and IV the funding for the U.S. Infor-
 mation Agency, the Board for Interna-
 tional Broadcasting, and the National
 Endowment for Democracy. The com-
 mittee mark for USIA in fiscal year
 1986 is $835.6 million, an increase of
 $39.7 million over the fiscal year 1985
 appropriation level but a decrease of
 $138 million below the administra-
 tion's fiscal year 1986 request. The
 committee approved most of the ad-
 ministration's request to modernize
 the badly outdated Voice of America
 facilities.
 Earmarked in the bill for fiscal year
 1986 is the USIA's Fulbright, Hum-
 phrey and International Visitor Pro-
 grams. This earmark represents an in-
 crease of. $15. million over the fiscal
 year 1985 levels but falls short of the
 congressional mandate embodied in
 the 1983 Pell amendment, that these
 programs be doubled over the fiscal
 year 1982 levels by fiscal year 1986.
 However, the fiscal year 1987 request
 will meet the  requirement of my
 amendment.
 The Board for International Broad-
 casting authorization of $137 million
 for fiscal year 1986 will fund the ongo-
 ing operations of Radio' Free Europe
 and Radio Liberty as well as provide
 needed resources for modernization of
 the radios' facilities. This bill also in-
 cludes an amendment I authored, to
 include the Secretary of State as a
 nonvoting ex-officio member of the
 B.I.B. This will ensure that U.S. for-
 eign policy interests are a factor in the
 oversight of the radios as is envisioned
 by the Board for International Broad-
 casting Act.
 Mr. President, in conclusion, I wish
 to join the, chairman in pointing out
 that the committee has made a good
 faith bipartisan effort to reduce the.
 budgets  of  these  various  agencies
 while providing them with the funding
 necessary to carry out their essential
 functions. Any further cuts could en-
 danger programs considered essential
 to carry out U.S. foreign policy goals
 and to promote U.S. interests abroad. I
 hope my colleagues 'will keep this in
 mind in considering this legislation
 and support the bill as reported by the
 committee. .
 Mr. President, it is my understand-
 ing that we will now turn to the vari-
 ous amendments on Nicaragua.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask
 unamous consent that Chip Andreae
 of my staff, and Mark Blitz, Bill Perry,
 Dave Keaney, Rick Messick, Barry
 Sklar, Bill Triplett, Peter Galbraith of
 the committee have the privilege of
 the floor throughout the duration of
 consideration of S. 1003.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 AMENDMENT NO. 271
 .Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send to
 the desk an amendment and ask for its
 immediate consideration.

 June 6,.1985                CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 There. being no; objection, the edito-
 rial was ordered to be printed in .the
 RECORD, as=follows
 THE HENRY Liu MURDER
 Here we go again. Following the murder in
 California of Henry Liu,. a Chinese-Ameri-
 can writer hostile to the government in
 Taipei, the wheels- of Chinese justice began
 to turn-began to turn, it must be conceded,
 somewhat more speedily than is generally
 the case in this country.
 Mr. Liu was shot dead in his home last
 Oct. 15. By April of this year two- Chinese
 thugs, members of the infamous Chulien
 gang,. had been convicted in Taiwan and, sen-
 tenced to life imprisonment. Two weeks
 later, Vice Admiral Wang Hsi-ling,. 58-year-
 old.head of Taiwan. government's Military
 Intelligence Bureau was convicted of insti-
 gating the crime. He likewise was sentenced
 to life imprisonment. Two of his- deputies,
 accessories to the crime; were, sentenced to
 21/2 years in prison.
 But that is not the. end of the story. The
 U.S. House of Representatives is now asking
 that these criminals be extradited to this
 country, and. a similarly dumb resolution is
 expected to pass the Senate. All. this. despite
 the fact that (a) due process already has
 been exhausted and (b) the United States
 has no extradition treaty with the Republic
 of China.
 It makes no sense. The State Department
 from the beginning has discounted the. pos-
 sibility that higher-ups in the Taiwan gov-
 eminent were involved in the Liu killing. It
 also acknowledges that Taiwan authorities
 cooperated fully in the murder investiga-
 tion. Most significant of all, the criminals.
 have been brought to trial publicly, prompt-
 ly, and in accordance with the law, and have
 been sentenced-three of thern to terms of
 life behind bars. So why all the fuss?
 In the People's Republic of China thou-
 sands perhaps hundreds of thousands, are
 imprisoned' without due process. One entire
 province,. Qinghai, is a virtual slave labor
 camp. The total number of deaths arising
 out of the political orgies to which Commu-
 nist governments' are so susceptible ap-
 proaches 100 million- And not a peep out of
 Congress. If you get the feeling, that all the
 hoopla over the Liu. killing. is largely--ideo-
 logical, move to the head of the. class..
 CONCLUSION OF MORNING
 BUSINESS
 The PRESIDING OFFICER- Morn-
 ing business is closed.
 FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORI-
 ZATION                       ACT,  FISCAL  YEARS
 1986 AND 1987
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senate wilt now proceed to the consid-
 eration of S. 1003, which will-be stated
 by title.
 The legislative clerk. read as follows:
 A bill (S.. 1003) to authorize appropria-
 tions for the Department of State. the
 United, States  Information  Agency,  the
 Board for International Broadcasting, and
 the National Endowment for Democracy,
 and for other purposes,. for fiscal years 1986
 and 1987.
 The Senate proceeded to consider
 the bill.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under
 the previous order,. the Senator from
 Connecticut [Mr. DODD]. is now recog-
 nized.
 Mr. DODD.: Mr. President, I suggest
 the absence of a quorum.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 clerk will call the roll..
 The legislative: clerk proceeded to
 call the roll.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the quorum
 call be rescinded..
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out objection, It. is so ordered.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that I may deliver
 a short introductory statement prior
 to, commencement of the debate on
 the: Dodd amendment:
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Is
 there objection?  The  Chair hears
 none, and it is so ordered.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, we begin
 today our consideration of the Foreign
 Relations Authorization Act for fiscal.
 years 1986 and 1987. The bill author-
 izes appropriations for the State De-
 partment,   the   U.S.   Information
 Agency; Radio Free Europe, Radio
 Liberty, and the National Endown-
 ment for Democracy.
 We bring this bill to the floor in the
 same spirit with which we brought the
 foreign  assistance  bill  before  the
 .Senate. It is, first, a spirit of biparti-
 sanship: both the majority and the Irii-
 nority made compromises in order to
 bring to the floor a bill we jointly sup-
 port. We may sometimes have differ-
 ent judgments about what our nation-
 al security requires. But national secu-
 rity must not. become an object of par-
 tisan.passion.
 It is, second, a spirit of fiscal re-
 straint. Government must continue to
 eliminate. the unnecessary and the ex-
 travagant. Agencies- and departments
 must learn to do more with what they
 already  have..  They  must  become
 leaner,. trimmer, and less bureaucrati-
 cally cumbersome-they will be better
 for it.
 It is, finally, a spirit of defense of
 national security. The agencies au-
 thorized in this bill do not procure
 weapons or train. forces.. But they for-
 mulate policy and explain. it,. gather
 information,. promote. democratic. insti-
 tutions, and secure American interests.
 It is naive to think that diplomacy- is
 'sufficient and that force  and the
 threat of force are unnecessary. But
 the quiet and thoughtful management
 of our everyday affairs helps us to
 keep a peaceful world. Essentially, the
 bill before us authorizes appropria-
 tions for the conduct of our basic dip-
 lomatic relations.
 Mr. President,. S.. 1003 was reported
 by the committee in. the spirit. I have
 discussed.. Section 1 authorizes appro-
 priations for the State Department. It
 does so in four categories:. $1,874 mil-
 lion in 198& for the administration. of
 Foreign Affairs; $534 million for inter-
 national organizations; $26.2 million
 for  international commissions; and
 $355 million for several other activi-
 ties, the chief of which. is, migration
 and refugee assistance.
 S 7587
 In arriving- at these figures the com-
 mittee began from a. simple premise: to
 start from 1985's original appropria-
 tion with the intention of freezing at
 this level unless there was strong justi-
 fication for exceeding it.
 The result of our deliberations is a
 budget for State Department activities
 that is $108 million below the total
 1985 appropriations, including supple-
 mentals. This total is also $120 million
 below the level authorized by House
 bill  2068-including  permanent au-
 thorities, even though the House, total
 is described as a freeze by its manag-
 ers.,
 The total we are recommending is,
 however, above 1985's original appro-
 priations. The reason is simply that
 much of the supplemental appropria-
 tion voted after the tragedy in Leba-
 non to help secure our Embassies and
 the lives within them in fact involves
 recurring costs. These costs are now
 part of the base. We have identified
 these security costs and earmarked
 them in the bill. We thus- have a total
 that provides the means for adequate
 'security; at the same time that it
 allows our foreign relations to be con-
 ducted and our work in international
 organizations and refugee assistance
 to continue. Again-it is a total well
 below what the administration re-
 quested and what the House voted.
 But it is an amount adequate to our
 needs.
 This bill contains a 2-year authoriza-
 tion. For the State Department for
 1987, we authorized the same amount
 as in 1986. This results in a $198 mil-
 lion cut from the administration's re-
 quest and a figure $209 million below
 the House's recommendation. We will
 consider a supplemental. if it is neces-
 sary-but we will require clear and
 convincing evidence. By - authorizing
 no 1987 increase the committee hopes
 to. make clear that fiscal restraint
 Cannot end in 1986, but must become a
 habit of good Government. A freeze in
 1987 will send a clear signal that this
 Senate means what it says about long-
 term fiscal restraint.
 It is particularly useful to point out
 that for the international organiza-
 tions account, our 1987 figure is $534
 million, 11.5 percent below the admin-
 istration's request and just $14,million
 above the figure the House attained
 after an amendment mandating a 15
 percent cut.
 S. 1003 also authorizes-in sections 2
 and 3-appropriations for the U.S. In-
 formation Agency and for the Board
 for  International  Broadcasting-the
 parent body for Radio Free Europe
 and Radio Liberty. We approached
 these budgets also in the spirit of
 economy: let us start with the 1985 ap-
 propriation and see if there is any
 reason to add to it. The result once
 more is a substantial cut from both
 they administration's request and the
 House's freeze level. The amount we

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                     S 7589
 The legislative clerk read as follows:
 The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. DODD]
 for himself, Mr. PELL, Mr. HARKIN, and Mr.
 KERRY. proposes an amendment numbered
 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I as
 k
 unanimous consent that reading of the
 amendment be dispensed with.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 The amendment is as follows:
 At the appropriate place in the bill, insert
 the following new section:
 PROTECTION OF UNITED STATES SECURITY
 INTERESTS IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN REGION
 SEC. -. (a) The Congress finds and de-
 clares that a direct threat to the security in-
 terests of the United States in the Central
 American region would arise from several
 developments including, but not limited to,
 the following:
 (1) The stationing, installation, or'other
 deployment of nuclear weapons or the deliv-
 ery systems for such weapons in the Central
 American region.
 (2) The establishment of a foreign mili-
 tary base in the Central American region by
 the government of a-Communist country.
 (3) The introduction into the Central
 American region of any advanced offensive
 weapons system by the government of a
 Communist country if such system is more
 sophisticated than such systems currently
 in the region.
 (b) If any development. described in para-
 graphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a)
 arises, the Congress intends to act promptly,
 in accordance with the constitutional proc-
 esses and treaty commitments of the United
 States, to protect and defend United States
 security interests in the Central American
 region and to approve the use of military
 force, if necessary, for that purpose.
 (c) Notwithstanding any other provision
 of law, the prohibition contained in section
 8066(a) of the Department of Defense Ap-
 propriation Act, 1985, as enacted by the Act
 of October 12, 1984 (Public Law 98-473),
 which applies to funds available during the.
 fiscal year 1985 to the Central Intelligence
 Agency, the Department of Defense, or any
 other agency or entity of the United States
 involved in intelligence activities shall apply
 to the same extent and in the same manner
 with respect to any such funds available
 during any fiscal year beginning on or after
 October 1, 1985. For purposes of the appli-
 cation of this subsection, the reference in
 such section .8066(a) to the fiscal year 1985
 shall be deemed to be a reference to the
 fiscal year -in which such funds are avail-
 able.
 (d) There are authorized to be appropri-
 ated to the President. $14,000,000 for the
 fiscal year 1985 to be available only to
 achieve-
 (1) the safe and orderly withdrawal from
 Nicaragua of all military and paramilitary
 forces which were supported by the United
 States before October 12, 1984; and
 (2) the relocation of such forces, including
 members of the immediate families of indi-
 viduals serving in such forces.
 (e)(1) There are authorized to be appro-
 priated to the Secretary of State $10,000,000
 which shall be used only as may be neces-
 sary to assist the negotiations sponsored by
 the  Contadora  group  and  to  support
 through peacekeeping and verification ac-
 tivities the implementation of any agree-
 ment reached pursuant to such negotia-
 tions.
 (2) For purposes of -paragraph (1), the
 term "Contadora group" refers to the gov-
 ernments of Colombia. Mexico, Panama,
 and Venezuela.
 (f) Nothing in this Act shall be construed
 as granting any authority to the President
 with respect to the introduction of United
 States Armed Forces into hostilities or into
 situations wherein involvement in hostilities
 is clearly indicated by the circumstances
 which authority he would not have had in
 the absence of this Act.
 (g) For purposes of this Act-
 (1) the term "Central American region"
 refers to the geographic region containing
 Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Hondu-
 ras, and Nicaragua; and
 (2) the term "Communist country" has
 the same meaning as is given to it by section
 620(f) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.
 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, at the
 outset, let me explain briefly to my
 colleagues  the  substance  of  this
 amendment.
 This is an amendment I sent to all
 my colleagues a week or more ago; but,
 for the purpose of debate this morn-
 ing, let the reiterate the five central
 features of this amendment.
 The first section of the amendment
 is a finding by the U.S. Congress as to
 what would constitute a direct threat
 to the security interests of the United
 States  and  the  Central  American
 region. It is not all inclusive, as the
 amendment clearly points out, but
 serves as an illustrative example of the
 The third part of this legislation
 prohibits any additional funding for
 military  or  paramilitary  'activities
 ,within the region.
 My colleagues will recognize this sec-
 tion as being a continuation of the so-
 called Boland provisions and this part
 of the legislation continues the Boland
 language in force.
 Thg fourth part of the legislation
 provides an appropriation of $14 mil-
 lion for fiscal year 1985 to be made
 available solely for the safe and order-
 ly withdrawal of all U.S.-supported
 military and paramilitary forces from
 Nicaragua and the relocation of those
 forces, including members of their im-
 mediate families.
 This is the funding that would pro-
 vide for the assistance to the Contras
 and to their families to disengage.
 These are not funds to be provided to
 continue the activities of the Contra
 operation, but to disengage entirely
 from that policy.
 The fifth provision of the amend-
 ment authorizes to be appropriated a
 sum of $10 million to assist thc'Conta-
 dora  negotiations  and  to  support
 through peacekeeping and verification
 the implementation of any agreement
 States would find to be directly con-  those negotiations.
 trary to our national security interests There is an additional section of
 within this hemisphere.
 I identify three examples of such
 things that could occur which would
 jeopardize those interests: The sta-
 tioning or installation of nuclear weap-
 ons or nuclear weapon delivery sys-
 tems within the Central American
 region; the establishment of a foreign
 Communist military base within the
 Central, American region; the intro-
 duction by any Communist nation of
 any advanced weapons system which
 exceeds the level of sophistication of
 those weapons already in the region.
 The second part of the amendment
 .does not say specifically what the
 United States would do. It does not re-
 quire that we take a specific.action if
 any of those three or other such ac-
 tions were to be taken by any country,
 including, of course, Nicaragua. But it
 does make quite clear that the United.
 States, should those security interests
 be jeopardized, is prepared to use mili-
 tary force to deal with those very le-
 gitimate national security interests.
 I emphasize again I am not saying
 specifically exactly what all of the sit-
 . uations are that would provoke mili-
 tary response or even in fact that a
 military response would be the only
 response. I am merely trying to lay out
 as clearly as possible what those.secu-
 rity interests are in the region and
 then also, of course to state unequivo-
 cally what the United States would be
 prepared to do, including - the use of
 military force to protect its very legiti-
 mate interests within the region.
 The third part of the bill gets to the
 matter at hand and that is, of course,
 the issue of continued funding for the
 Contra operation.
 which I should make note to my col-
 leagues because I am sure they are apt
 to raise the question, and that is a war
 powers provision. There are some who
 are uneasy about the fact that I said I
 am willing to use military force in
 terms of national security interests
 emerging in the region, but to those
 who may be uneasy about that kind of
 language, I included a provision which
 would  cover  the  language  of  war
 power provisions.
 Mr. President, that is the surd and
 substance of the amendment. It is a
 departure  from  what  will  be  the
 debate throughout the rest of this
 day. It will be a departure from what
 was debated in the other body where
 basically we are going to have an argu-
 ment or a debate, if you will, over a
 funding level to be continued over this
 fiscal year and into the next to contin-
 ue to support the Contra operation.  '
 I believe, Mr. President, that policy
 is fundamentally flawed and that the
 issue is not whether or not we are will-
 ing to provide an additional $14 mil-
 lion or $35 million or $36 million or
 $27 million, to the Contras. The issue
 is not who is going to deliver this as-
 sistance, whether it is the CIA or AID
 or the United Nations or the Red
 Cross. The issue is not who is going to
 receive that aid, whether it is the Con-
 tras, or'some independent third party
 in the region. The issue is not where
 those  resources  will  be  deliv3red,
 whether it is in Honduras or in Nicara-
 gua, and that is basically what the
 debate will be.
 The issue is' not going to be, in my
 mind, whether it should be humanitar
 ian or lethal or nonlethal.

 S 7590      -             CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE.
 Those are all questions which we
 will spend the greater part of today,
 possibly tomorrow, debating here.
 Frankly, that is not the issue. And
 we make a mistake if we assume that
 is the debate.
 The debate ought to be whether or
 not this particular decision, this deci-
 sion         to  support  the  Contras,  the
 Contra policy, is that in the interests
 of the United States? Is a continuation
 of support of that counterrevolution-
 ary effort in the interest of the for-
 eign policy concerns of this country?
 That is the fundamental question and,
 unfortunately, we are not going to
 debate the fundamental question.
 Instead, we are going to do what I
 think President Reagan has accurately
 described and that is. micromanage-
 ment of foreign policy. We are going
 to spend the next 8 or 10 hours argu-
 ing over the nuts and the bolts of a
 particular policy rather than the fun-
 damental question of whether or not
 over the last 4 or 5 years our interests
 have been advanced or harmed by this
 policy, whether or not there is any
 likelihood of the- next several years
 this policy is likely to bear the kind of
 fruit that those who support it sug-
 gest.
 We will have discussions and debates
 today over whether or not nonlethal
 aid means jeeps, or trucks, what consti-
 tutes clothing: are fatigues clothing or
 not clothing? We will argue over what
 shelter is. Is a shelter a field tent or is
 it a permanent tent? That is the kind
 of debate we are going to have, unfor-
 tunately.
 We are missing the fundamental
 issue, and the fundamental issue is
 whether or not this policy is working,
 whether or-not it is in our interests:
 For the last several years, Mr. Presi-
 dent, we have heard people on the so-
 called right call the Contras, the polit-
 ical equivalent of Jeffersonian Demo-
 crats,  political  equivalent  of  our
 Founding Fathers, all sorts of similar
 language to describe them. And on the
 so-called left, we have heard people de-
 scribe the Sandinistas as the reincar-
 nation of the Franciscan Order, who
 say that these are pure highly moral,
 ethical individuals who are only con-
 cerned about the welfare of their
 people.  And  the  debate  has  been
 whether or not you support the Con-
 tras or the Sandinistas.
 We have spent precious little time, it
 seems to me, talking about what is in
 the interests of our country.
 I am concerned as I know my col-
 leagues are about what happens in
 Nicaragua. I am concerned, as I know
 my colleagues are, about what hap-
 pens in El Salvador, Guatemala, Hon-
 duras, Costa Rica, and every other
 country throughout Latin America.
 But my interests in those particular
 countries are superseded by my inter-
 ests in what is important to this coun-
 try, what is in the interests of the
 United States.
 And it seems to me at some point in
 this debate we ought to .get back on
 June 6, 1985
 track and start talking about what is    Instead of talking about humanitari-
 in our interests, not in the Contras' in.  an, nonlethal aid to be delivered. by
 terests, not in the Sandinistas' inter- some nonthreatening body to some
 or anyone else's interests but what is
 in our interests. I do not believe we
 have done that.
 So today, Mr. President, I offered
 this amendment. I should have said at
 the outset I have no illusions about it.
 I do not expect there will be a great
 many votes in support of this amend-
 ment. I am tremendously grateful to
 my colleague from. Rhode Island, the
 ranking minority Member of the For-
 eign Relations  Committee,  Senator
 PELL,  Senator HARKIN,  and Senator
 KERRY for cospsonsoring this amend-
 ment. But I think all of us recognize
 that we are taking a position that is
 somewhat different from what our col-
 leagues will be engaged in debating
 over the remainder of today.
 Mr. President, I hope in the next
 few minutes to be able to demonstrate
 why I think this policy is ill-founded,
 why I think it is dangerous, why I
 think it is harmful, not only to our-
 selves and to our allies, but also that it
 is a cruel hoax on the Contras them-
 selves.
 I believe continued support of this
 policy will be a mistake. I think the
 sooner we say this to ourselves and to
 our allies, the better off we will be.
 I know there are those who have al-
 ready suggested that it is too late, that
 over the past 4 years, we have expend-
 ed some $100 million to $150 million of
 U.S. taxpayer money, we . have seerr
 people lose their lives in this policy,
 and that we cannot now go back.
 I realize that that is a compelling ar-
 gument to some. But I would certainly
 hope that people would recognize that
 as difficult a choice as that may be, in
 June 1985, it does not get any easier.
 Tomorrow it will be tougher. In 6
 months, it will be tougher. A year
 from now, it gets tougher. And I am
 sure as I stand here before you today,
 we will hear that argument.
 We are committed. We spent the money..
 We are involved. We cannot change that
 policy. We cannot pull back.
 No matter how well-founded that         natives. It is regrettable that the Con---,-, "

 neutral place,' why do we not talk
 about giving the Contras real assist-
 ance? I regret there is not an amend-
 ment going to be offered today that
 says, "Look, if the Contras need $114
 million a day, they ought to get it.
 And if they need military assistance,
 they ought to get it."
 I disagree with that viewpoint, but, I
 would say to my colleagues this morn-
 ing, I have a great deal of respect for
 those who argue that position. That is
 a credible policy. That policy at least
 suggests that they might succeed at
 some point in bringing about the kind
 of change that is suggested by Presi-
 dent Reagan and others.
 But to talk about nonlethal humani-
 tarian Band-Aids and Jeeps to be deliv-
 ered in some place no one knows about
 by some third party over the next 2 or
 3 years, that is nothing. All that does
 guarantee us that we can go back
 home in the next couple of days and
 say to that constituency in one part of
 our State that is opposed to the
 Contra  aid,  "We  only  gave  them
 nonthreatening assistance." And to
 that part of the constituency that
 thinks supporting the Contras is a
 great idea, we can say, "We provided
 assistance to the Contras."
 What we are going to be doing here
 today is satisfying a domestic political
 problem. We are not advancing foreign
 policy interests of the United States at
 all. It will be argued that we are
 buying time by supporting this ap-
 proach. I would argue that we are
 losing time; that if we continue to
 pursue a policy that is not working, as
 I said a mpment ago, we jeopardize not
 only our own interests and our allies'
 interests, but the interest of peace and
 stability in this part of the world.
 So this is one of the options, the
 viable options, to decide that what we
 are doing has not worked, to admit it
 to ourselves, and to start traveling on
 a different road as soon as possible.
 I have tried to offer in this amend-       (

 ans, Venezuealans, and Panamanians
 think-people in strong democracies,
 not mirror images of our our democra-
 cy but people struggling to improve
 the  quality of life for their own
 people, not perfect governments but,
 God knows, far better than what we
 have seen in the Cubas and the Chiles
 and the juntas of Argentina. And they
 think that we do not think they un-
 derstand. They think that we think
 that they do not really care.. And, un-
 fortunately, that policy is being rel-
 egated to a trash heap by the failure
 of this Government, our country, both
 the Congress and the administration-
 I do not lay all the blame at the door-
 step of the White House-but unfortu-
 nately it is being relegated to the
 trash heap because we fail to appreci-
 ate the historical significance of this
 effort.
 For those who have bothered to read
 any history of Central America prior
 to 1979-and, unfortunately, there are
 very few who have, but for those who
 have-this is an historic opportunity,
 the Contadora process. Never before
 in this hemisphere have four countries
 been willing to step out and to offer to
 take the leadership role in trying to
 resolve Latin problems-Latins grap-
 pling with Latin problems. For the
 first time, they.tried to do this. And,
 as I said a moment ago, we have rel-
 egated it to certain failure.
 Third, Mr. President, I hope that we
 might spend some time trying to lend
 our support to those people inside
 Nicaragua who are not fighting but
 who oppose the Sandinista Govern-
 ment. They have been virtually forgot-
 ten over the last several years, people
 like  William  Baez,  in  the  private
 sector, ? people within  the  Catholic
 Church, people within the opposition
 political parties, people within the
 media, who are not in the mountains,
 who are not fighting in the hills with
 military hardware, but are trying to
 bring about some change within that
 country. It seems to me we ought to be
 doing more for them.
 And, fourth, we ought to provide
 some real meaningful assistance in
 terms of economic development in the
 region. I am pleased to have supported
 an amendment that was offered a few
 weeks ago that provided for some
 long-term assistance; economic assist-
 ance, to the region. I think that kind
 of signal is extremely important.
 So, Mr. President, what I am offer-
 ing here, as I said at the outset, is
 what I would consider at least an
 honest alternative to pursuing the
 present policy, recognizing that what
 we' have been engaged in over the past
 4 years has failed economically, politi-
 cally, as well as militarily.
 I might also add that it is kind of a
 cruel hoax, as I said earlier, on the
 Contras  themselves.  Some  people
 within  that  operation are former
 Somoza national guard figures. Not all
 of them are. A lot of them are very
 well-intentioned people who feel as
 though their rights have been signifi-
 cantly harmed by the Sandinistas.
 They are good people. And we are
 going  to  turn  them  into  cannon
 fodder. We are going to march them
 into that valley because they believe
 that we are going to stand behind
 them and come in with U.S. forces to
 back them up when the Nicaraguans
 chew them up. And there is not a
 person in this Chamber who believes
 we are going to do that. Yet that is
 what we are telling the Contras that
 we are going to do. That is a cruel
 hoax to play on those people, yet we
 are engaged in it.
 It has been hard to identify exactly
 what  this  administration's  foreign
 policy is with regard to Nicaragua and
 Central America. There have been dif-
 ferent messages over the last 4 years.
 But, in fairness to them-and I will
 wait and see if anyone would funda-
 mentally contradict what I am about
 to say, because, I tried to synthesize it
 as I understand it over the last several
 days-it seems to me, with regard to
 Nicaragua,  the' Reagan  administra-
 tion's foreign policy objectives have
 been: To encourage the Nicaraguans
 to reduce the military buildup in their
 country, to discourage them from ex-
 panding their revolution beyond the
 borders of their own country, to dis-
 credit them internationally within the
 region and, last, to encourage them to
 institute some democratic reforms and
 live up to the ideals that they es-'
 poured prior to their success in 1979 in
 the overthrow of the Somozan govern-
 ment. That was, at least it seems to
 me, to be the broad framework of this
 administration's foreign policy objec-
 tives when we started the Contra oper-
 ation some 4 years ago.
 We have expended as I mentioned-
 which is public information now-
 some $100 million to $150 million on
 .this operation, and yet as I look at
 Nicaragua today, more than 4 years
 after this operation has begun, we find
 the Nicaraguan military machine a lot
 stronger in May of 1985 than it ever
 was in January of 1981 and getting
 stronger. We find democratic reforms
 inside Nicaragua in worse shape today
 than they were in January of 1981,
 and we see people like Daniel Ortega
 being received as a conquering hero-in
 the capitals of Western Europe and
 throughout this hemisphere;
 It seems to me that the goals, if Jam
 at least close in approximating what
 the goals were of this administration,
 have not only not been achieved nor
 have we come close to achieving them,
 but in fact it is the goals, it would
 appear, of the Sandinistas that have
 .been advanced. They are better off
 militarily. They are doing what they
 want inside their own country, and
 they are now perceived as heroes
 throughout this hemisphere. If that
 has been our goal, if that is what our
 foreign policy interests have been over
 the last 3 or 4 years, and if we are not
 succeeding-in fact losing that battle-
 why do we insist upon pursuing a
 policy that would seem to have the ab-
 solute opposite effect on what we are
 trying to achieve? If it is not working.
 why do we not have the courage and
 the honesty to try something else?
 Why do we insist upon pursuing a
 policy that is hurting us and dividing
 us from our allies?
 The President imposed an embargo a
 few weeks ago. We had to break a
 Honduran arm to find one country to
 support us, and in a nothing gesture
 with an embargo that meant nothing.
 We had to use all of the diplomatic in-
 fluence of the President of the United
 States to bring the President of Hon-
 duras up to this country, and to get on
 a bended knee to beg him to support
 our embargo-one country.
 We are losing the war with our
 allies. Do we really want to be isolated
 with our Western European allies, and
 with our Latin American allies? If we
 are isolated today, does it get better or
 worse if we pursue this policy? I sug-
 gest of course the latter.
 So while I recogiize this is not an
 amendment that is going to enjoy
 broad-based support I hope it will be
 perceived at least as a choice we will
 ultimately have to make. I tell you
 that as certainly as I stand here today.
 I promise you that within a matter of
 weeks or months we will be back here
 making this choice. We will have to
 make the choice of whether to really
 go in and do something, including the
 use of military force, or make the
 choice that will not only be a tough
 one but also a harmful one when it
 comes later-the choice of saying it is
 not working, and we are going to pull
 back. It is hard enough to do that now.
 There is a certain amount of credibil-
 ity lost as a result of doing it. I will be
 the first one to admit that. But it gets
 tougher, and the loss of credibility
 grows larger with time, not less. So if
 we are'honest with ourselves, honest
 with our constitutuents, and honest
 with our allies, it seems to me we
 would have the courage to make that
 choice today. Let us either go in and
 give these Contras the kind of support
 that they are going to need to have if
 they are going to prevail, or- let us
 travel down a different road.
 I suggest by the way that there is
 little or no likelihood that the Sandi-
 nistas are going to change fundamen-
 tally. There may be some cosmetic
 changes. In fact, I was surprised that
 some Democrats were surprised that
 Daniel Ortega went to Moscow. Where
 do my colleages think he was going to
 go? Disney World?
 This man is a Marxist. We should
 not argue aobut that. He is a Marxist.
 We know that. But it is disingenuous,
 I believe, for those who argue that
 there is no way that this government
 is going to fundamentally change, and
 yet argue that, if we provide a little
 more money to the Contras, maybe we
 can,get them to change or come to a

 will be satisfied is if the Sandinistas
 are overthrown.  That is  the only
 change that is going to achieve the
 satisfaction of those who believe that
 the Sandinistas are a fundamental
 threat to the U.S. security interests
 and security interests of allies in the
 region. That is the only option. We are
 not going to get them to change other-
 wise. We are naive if you believe so.
 So I say once again the options are
 either to go in and get rid of them and
 support actions that are likely to
 achieve that goal, or to seek a differ-
 ent path that at least may identify the
 real interests of the United States, to
 make it clear that we are prepared to
 defend those interests and to try to
 build some consensus in our allies
 among the regions in Western Europe
 so the actions we do take down the
 road with regard to Nicaragua may
 enjoy some broad-based support, and
 to try if we can through this Contra-
 dora process, as troublesome as it is, to
 come up with some answer for this
 part of the world that will bring long-
 term stability and hope for these
 people. We ought to get about the
 business of trying to do that.
 What I said does not fit on a bumper
 sticker unfortunately. It seems to me
 that is the kind of foreign policy that
 works today. If it does not fit on a
 bumper sticker and you cannot say it
 in one sentence, do not bother bring-
 ing it up.
 But I -hope at least at some point
 before it is too late, and before we find
 ourselves drawn into this situation
 even deeper than we already are that
 we would listen to good friends. We
 should not see this as an issue of sup-
 port for Marxism or nonsupport for
 Marxism, but as intelligent choices for
 the United States. I commend the
 President because he has made them
 in other places. I know it was not easy
 for him because of his deep-felt views
 about Marxism. I know he did not like
 raising a glass with Deng Xiaoping. I
 know how President Reagan. has felt
 about him. But he did it. I know when
 he lifted the sanctions on Poland it
 was not because he thought General
 Jaruzelski was a great advocate of
 human rights or that Solidarity was
 no,longer a problem. He made a prag-
 matic decision and choice. He is sitting
 down today with our negotiators in
 Geneva trying to work out a SALT or
 START agreement, a reduction in the
 proliferation of nuclear weapons.
 That is not because he likes the Rus-
 sians, or he likes the People's Republic
 of China, or that he likes the Polish
 Government. But he understands that
 you have to live in this world, you
 have to grapple with the problems,
 and you try to do it intelligently to ad-
 vance our interests.
 All I am suggesting today is we do
 here what we try to do elsewhere, that
 we try to look at this situation with
 the same kind of cold eye, the objec-
 tive eye of reducing the kind of ten-
 sions and troubles that we face if we
 proceed in this policy.
 One last point I meant to make, Mr.
 President, and then I will yield the
 floor on this. I tell my colleagues
 today that I am deeply concerned and
 worried about the immediate expan-
 sion of this conflict. By the way, the
 news this morning that the Nicara-
 guans have shot down two additional
 helicopters is tremendously disturbing.
 Those helicopters went down appar-
 ently in Honduras. I can see the situa-
 tion occurring very shortly where the
 Nicaraguans will cross that Honduran
 border, or they will cross that Costa
 Rican border and they will use the
 very same argument that Israel used
 in June of 1982 when it went into
 southern  Lebanon-that no self-re-
 specting nation would tolerate the ex-
 istence of terrorist groups, terrorizing
 its people, and that they will go across
 that border to ferret out those pockets
 of terrorism. They will not stay there
 forever, they will tell us, but they will
 cross that border, and we will get that
 kind of provocative action. I guarantee
 you that the Hondurans will then call
 upon the United States to come in to
 defend their interests. Then we. will
 have a kind of catch-22 situation. I
 hope that does not happen but I can
 see that coming. We seem to be get-
 ting closer and closer- to it.
 I suggest to you that despite all of
 the treaties that we have signed that
 would call upon the United States to
 go in to defend Hondurans or Costa
 Rica in that situation, that in the
 world court of public opinion Nicara-
 gua would probably look like they -
 were doing the right thing. I suspect
 in this country there would be a
 strong feeling that for us to go down
 to engage in a conflict with Nicaragua
 in that kind of a situation would not
 be the "right thing to do."
 I see that happening. I suggest to
 you that if it happens it will be be-
 cause we pursued a contra policy that
 is not getting us anywhere and that is
 drawing us into that kind of decision,
 which I suspect would do serious
 damage to the credibility of this coun-
 try, not only in this hemisphere but
 throughout the globe.
 Mr: President, I reserve the balance
 of my time at this point.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would
 like to begin our side of the debate
 that we will have today on Nicaragua
 and the Contras, with an opening
 statement and then to address specific
 points which have been raised by the.
 Senator from Connecticut.
 We find ourselves, again today, de-
 bating the question of providing assist-
 ance to the armed opposition in Nica-
 ragua. The Congress has been doing
 this at frequent intervals for some
 years now-with little to show for it in
 terms of contributing to the forging of
 effective policy. The reason for this in-
 terminable,  inconclusive. exercise  is
 that  we  have  lacked-up  to the
 present time-bipartisan consensus in
 support of a coherent administration
 policy. We have not been able to agree
 on the nature of the threat to Central
 Jun.:e 6, 1 98.5
 America presented by the Managua
 regime nor on the means by which it
 should be confronted. Thus, we have
 been unable to decide what, if any,
 role our support of the opposition in
 Nicaragua ought to play in a compre-
 hensive strategy to address the prob-
 lem.
 Only a strategic consensus of this
 nature will allow us to make the firm
 and binding commitments necessary
 for effective policy. The American
 body-politic is now, finally, coming to
 such a consensus. The amendment
 that will later be introduced by Sena-
 tor NuNN and myself expresses this
 agreement and prescribes a responsi-
 ble and effective way in which our
 support of those elements resisting
 the Marxist authorities in Managua
 can contribute to resolving both the
 Nicaraguan question and the chal-
 lenge that it poses to our Central
 American policy as a whole. And I am
 afraid that the amendment offered by
 the distinguished Senator from Con-
 necticut does not meet these criteria.
 Over the past 4 years, our Central
 American policy has come a long way
 toward producing the positive results
 for which we all hoped. These objec-
 tives, simply stated, are stable develop-
 ment, peace and democracy in this
 troubled region. At present, the evolv-
 ing situation in Nicaragua presents the
 single greatest remaining obstacle to
 achievement of these goals.
 At this point it behooves us to
 review the record. There were clear ef-
 forts to treat normally, and even gen-
 erously, with the authorities in Mana-
 gua during. 1979 and 1980. And the
 current administration, although in-
 creasingly suspicious of the ominous
 trends already clearly evident in San-
 dinista policy, attempted to come to a
 purely diplomatic modus vivendi with
 the Nicaraguan Government through
 most of 1981. The members of the rev-
 olutionary directorate proved obdu-
 rate, however, in their pursuit of poli-
 cies aimed at institutionalizing Marx-
 ist dictatorship, subverting its neigh-
 bors, building up excessive military ca-
 pabilities and forging close ties with
 Cuba, the Soviet bloc and the whole
 spectrum of terrorist organizations.
 As a result, the United States began
 channeling assistance to armed opposi-
 tion elements as a means to blunt San-
 dinista subversion of its neighbors,
 impede consolidation  of a Marxist
 regime and provide an incentive to
 meaningful negotiations.  This  ap-
 proach became increasingly controver-
 sial in a Congress that was slow to rec-
 ognize the basic nature of the Nicara-
 gua Government or to accept the need
 for dealing with it in these terms.
 Such assistance has thus been held in
 abeyance for more than a year now as
 the Congress and the administration
 wrestled over policy.
 And what have been the results?
 The Managua authorities have contin-
 ued along their clear course toward
 the institutionalization of a Marxist-

 totalitarian state. They have persisted
 in subverting and threatening their
 neighbors. They have escalated their
 arms buildup. And they have woven
 their ties ever tighter with the Com-
 munist powers and the international
 terrorist network. At the same time,
 the conduct of the commandantes has
 produced steadily growing disenchant-
 ment among the population. The op-
 position to the regime-both armed
 and unarmed-has assumed  an  in-
 creasingly broad-based character and
 now evidences the clear intention of
 compelling the Sandinista leadership
 to honor the public commitments of
 the revolution to democracy, peace
 with its neighbors, and an autonomous
 foreign policy.
 I, for one, have seen enough of the
 Sandinistas to understand the nature
 of this regime today and the objectives
 which it entertains for the. future. I
 have also come to the firm conclusion
 that only a change in its fundamental.
 structure will secure the modification
 of its domestic and foreign policies
 necessary to preserve U.S. interests
 and those of our regional allies as well.
 This, in turn, will require the partici-
 pation of the Nicaraguan opposition in
 the future political life of that nation.
 The resistance has already put forth
 a reasonable plan for their incorpora-
 tion into the political structure of
 Nicaragua. And the Sandinista govern-
 ment has thus far refused even to con-
 sider discussion of such a process-a
 process which I believe to be indispen-
 sable to the achievement of peace
 within Nicaragua and good relations
 between that nation and its neighbors.
 But to entertain any hopes for a de-
 velopment of this kind we must forth-
 rightly support the opposition. We
 should not be embarrassed to support
 forces struggling against Marxism and
 for the establishment of democracy in
 Central America. Indeed, brave indi-
 viduals of this nature deserve our sup-
 port. Assistance to these groups also
 serves U.S. interests-another consid-
 eration for which we have no reason
 to apologize. The armed opposition
 has impeded full consolidation of a
 Marxist government in the area and
 obstructed its efforts to subvert its
 neighbors.  The  existence  of  these
 groups provides the Managua authori-
 ties with their only realistic incentive
 to negotiate. And finally, aid to the
 Nicaraguan opposition sends a power-
 ful signal of U.S. resolve to this coun-
 try's allies in the region and to those
 in Nicaragua who are inclined to resist
 the consolidation of Marxist tyranny.
 Prudent U.S. assistance to the demo-
 cratic forces of Nicaragua and negotia-
 tions are not mutually exclusive-as
 some contend-but rather indispensa-
 bly  complementary.  In  the  real
 world-and particularly with Marx-
 ists-negotiations take place only be-
 tween elements with real resources
 behind them. The Nunn-Lugar amend-
 ment that will later be introduced sup-
 ports the Contadora process and any
 bilateral  negotiations  between  the
 United  States  and  Nicaragua that
 could have productive results. But the
 basic negotiations that matter are be-
 tween Nicaraguans themselves. There
 will not be peace in Nicaragua if we
 continue to deny even humanitarian
 assistance to the Contras. And there
 will not be stability in Central Amer-
 ica until there is real representation of
 democratic elements in the political
 structure of Nicaragua.
 This amendment of Senator NUNN
 and I can resolve the impasse that has
 afflicted our Nicaraguan policy and
 forge a realistic consensus that both
 Houses of Congress, the administra-
 tion and the American people can sup-
 port. It is not enough to desire or ad-
 vocate democracy, negotiations, and
 peace in Central America. Given the
 importance of the region and the
 other forces at work there, we must be
 involved if our ideals are ultimately to
 prevail. We must demonstrate a way to
 construct a framework of incentives
 which, while encouraging negotiations,
 does not simply acquiesce to the ag-
 gressive and antidemocratic instincts
 of the Marxists.
 We must have a reasonable policy-
 but one with substance behind it. And
 we must have the resolve to stand
 firmly behind this policy over time.
 The amendment before us does not
 meet these criteria. Our amendment,
 which will be offered at a later stage
 in the debate, does so and will suceed
 in forging effective policy from the
 consensus which I now believe finally
 exists with respect to Nicaragua. The
 amendment of Senator NUNN and I
 can mark a significant step toward re-
 alization of the hopes for the future of
 Central America that I believe all
 Americans share. And I earnestly urge
 my colleagues in this body to give it
 the commanding majority that will
 clearly  demonstrate  the  bipartisan
 consensus that we have finally come
 to on this vitally important issue.
 Let me say in respect to the amend-
 ment offered by my distinguished col-
 league from Connecticut, that he has
 presented,  a  departure  from most
 analyses of the situation in Nicaragua
 and, for that matter, most solutions to
 the problems that -we face with that
 nation.  Indeed,  Senator  DODD  has
 called for withdrawal of our support
 for the Contras and withdrawal, for
 that matter, of the Contras from Nica-
 ragua-a separation, in essence.
 I think in fairnes to the distin-
 guished  Senator  from  Connecticut
 that his amendment needs to be recog-
 nized as one which suggests that, as
 opposed to support of a military char-
 acter, humanitarian character, or any
 other kind of character, he sees the
 issue of one as to whether we ought to
 be involved with the Contras-opposi-
 tion forces, the freedom fighters-at
 all.
 He has suggested that an honest op-
 posing policy would be one that asks
 the Contras what they need and then
 the administration ought to provide
 those resources. In my judgment, the
 amendment had a second major aspect
 that is intriguing and certainly argu-
 able, because it suggests that the only
 real  problem  is  the  possibility  of
 Soviet presence there. Senator DODD
 has been forthright in his opposition
 to the landing of high-powered or
 high-tech Soviet aircraft or other mu-
 nitions there and suggests that that is
 the real threat and one that ought to
 be met overtly. I suspect that a large
 number of Senators share his anxiety
 and suspicion that, in the event that
 such a thing occurred, we would be
 united in opposing it.
 I think that the dilemma that many
 of us will find in the Senator's amend-
 ment is that it really offers us no way,
 in my judgment, to move toward nego-
 tiations. The incentives that are im-
 plied in Contra pressure upon the San-
 dinista government are removed. In a
 way-in  a  humanitarian  way-the
 Contras are withdrawn. The money is
 used to try to take care of their needs
 as that situation is wound down. But
 for anybody looking for a reason why
 the Government of Nicaragua would
 negotiate, it would. be hard to find at
 this. point.
 One of the intriguing things about
 the Dodd amendment is that he sug-
 gests that the only way the Sandinis-
 tas might change is if they are over-
 thrown. I gather he is arguing that
 this Marxist regime, which he has
 characterized as Marxist-and suggest-
 ed that those who had not seen that
 really should have. Mr. Ortega is a
 Marxist and has been, and is. espous-
 ing Marxism. But Senator DODD is sug-
 gesting also that Marxists do not
 change and that they do not negoti-
 ate. If we are even looking at the Con-
 tadora process for some possibility of
 ameliorating   that   rather   harsh
 regime, bringing in political parties,
 freedom of the press, democratic insti-
 tutions, we are likely to find that a
 forlorn hope, suggesting that those
 who really value democracy in Nicara-
 gua-and I characterize myself as one
 of these-had better be prepared to
 overthrow that government.
 Senator DODD suggests that it is a
 Marxist  government,  is  going  to
 remain a Marxist government, and
 that the only way you change it is to
 supplant it. Senator DODD is suggest-
 ing as a point of analysis that honest-
 ly, you really ought to give those who
 would supplant it the tools to do that.
 really have a civil war of sorts, and fi-
 nally hope that your side prevails.
 That, I think, is a breathtaking con-
 clusion. Senator DODD's analysis of the
 regime may ultimately prove to be cor-
 rect. There may be many people on
 the right and the left of the political
 spectrum who would agree that Marx-
 jsts never change. They would hold
 that the regime of the 'Sandinistas is
 beyond negotiation, that despite all
 the protestations that they have had
 elections,, that La Prensa still prints
 even with heavy censorship, it really is
 not  a  collectivized,  thoroughgoing

 totalitarian   Marxist  system, but
 rather a Nicaraguan variety of that
 that is less thoroughgoing. And if, in
 fact, the Ortega regime will never ne-
 gotiate with anyone, we have a very
 bleak prospect ahead of us in Nicara-
 gua.
 Even if that were the case, I would
 not favor the Dodd approach of simply
 pulling out all the, support behind the
 freedom  fighters.  Nicaraguans  who
 were part of the Sandinista revolution
 have every right and claim to political
 participation as the result of its suc-
 cess. I think when we talk about the
 Contras-and persons may come to
 many different characterizations of
 the various groups and strains that
 comprise them-there is in this opposi-
 tion, in the freedom fighter group, 'a
 good bit of the original. revolution"that
 overthrew Somoza. In my judgment,
 the  better  elements  remain-those
 who favor plurality political parties,
 freedom of speech, democratic institu-
 tions. As I indicated in my opening
 statement, we ought `to have no apol-
 ogy for being in favor of those who'
 want to bring about democratic insti-
 tutions. We ought to be opposed, it
 seems to me, to a policy that would
 clearly say Nicaragua is Marxist and
 let us leave it alone, let us withdraw
 any irritants to their position. If the
 Marxists bring in the Soviet Union, let
 us strike hard and fast, but barring
 that, leave the Marxists to do their
 will.
 The dilemma of this, I' think, is
 clear. And this is the idea of "a revolu-
 tion without borders" has meant just
 that-subversion of the neighbors-a
 very unhappy relationship, at least,
 with everybody in Central America
 who genuinely wants economic reform
 and lives in threat that bridges are
 going to be blown _up and roads dam-
 aged and all the rest as subversive
 groups throughout the area are aided
 by the Sandinista government in Nica-
 ragua and by the flow of goods and
 services through Cuba. and from. the
 Soviet Union, Eastern Europe; North
 Korea, and the almost, United Nations
 group that has formed in Nicaragua to
 be a part of this experience.
 I am hopeful that the Senate will
 reject the Dodd amendment because it
 appears to me to offer no momentum
 for the change that needs to happen.
 It clearly offers no bipartisan consen-
 sus for a policy that will stir Ameri-
 cans, might explain the situation to
 Americans or, indeed, offer us any real
 point of departure.
 Ultimately, it is literally an appro-
 priation or an authorization, at least
 at this stage, of money for withdrawal.
 It is literally money down the drain. I
 hope that this is clear to Members.
 I add just one more thought because
 I suspect this strain will come through
 some of the rest of our debate. I noted
 yesterday  as  rhetoric  moved  into
 higher and higher levels in the House
 of  Representatives  that    Speaker
 O'NEILL commented that down deep,
 the reason he opposes assistance of
 any kind to the Contras is that he be-
 lieves literally that we are headed
 toward  a  war  involving  American
 troops. He sees that absolutely clearly
 down the trail: Therefore, he opposes
 assistance to the Contras because he
 believes in his heart that that is likely
 to bring that about. I respect the
 Speaker's analysis of this, but I re-
 spectfully suggest to him and likewise
 to the distinguished Senator from
 Connecticut that, in the event that we
 have nothing going for democracy in
 Nicaragua, we do. not have people who
 are Nicaraguans working to obtain
 their freedom, working to try to keep
 the neighborhood from being subvert-
 ed  by  the  Sandinista government,
 working to keep pressure on so that
 the Soviets and other unwelcome in-
 fluences know that they are not wel-
 come.
 If in fact we wash our hands of the
 Contras, offer no aid or, as in the case
 of the Dodd amendment; aid only for
 withdrawal, then we really do face a
 situation in which the Sandinista gov-
 ernment will not go away and in which
 the problems that are  a part of
 present circumstances remain and in
 which, in my judgment, the dangers to
 our country remain. That is not to
 imply that we will want to act upon
 that for any foreseeable time in the
 future. Perhaps we.will simply tell our
 friends in Central America that we are
 sorry that their governments are being
 subverted and as revolutions occur and
 as emigration occurs and as many,
 .many refugees, almost like a Vietnam
 boat people scenario, come to the
 United States, we will indicate that we
 are sorry all this is occurring.
 But anyone who believes that simply
 by withdrawal, sort of an antispetic
 move at this point, and with the
 threat to the Soviets that if they land,
 we will do something, I think is an in-
 correct analysis, and that is what the
 debate on the Dodd.amendment boils
 down to in my judgment.
 Mr. President, I yield to the majori-
 ty leader.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 majority leader is recognized.
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am not
 going to debate the amendment, but I
 did-want to indicate that I have had
 inquiries from a number of my col-
 leagues about the schedule for the re-
 mainder of the day and week. As I in-
 dicated last evening, much depends on
 what happens to the bill before us
 today. If we can complete action on
 this bill today, we could turn to some
 matters tomorrow that are not contro-
 versial and probably would not require
 rollcall votes.
 I would suggest that if Members
 have any desire to leave tomorrow,
 they can demonstrate that by speak-
 ing briefly today. We cannot have it
 both ways, but we will try to accom-
 modate those-and there are a number
 of them-Members on each side who
 have official commitments tomorrow.
 So we hope we can complete action
 on this bill and accommodate as many
 June 6, 1985
 Members as we can by not having roll-
 call votes tomorrow, even though we
 will be in session and we will have leg-
 islation.
 Mr.. HART. Mr. President, I wonder
 if the Senator from Indiana will yield
 for a question.
 Mr. LUGAR. Yes, I am happy to
 yield for a question.
 Mr. HART. I thank the Senator. My
 question, Mr. President, is asked in ul-
 timate good faith and not knowing the
 answer. It is not a rhetorical question.
 What does the distinguished chair-
 man of the Foreign Relations Commit-
 tee think is the long-term. purpose of
 continued nonmilitary or humanitari-
 an assistance to the Contras? In other
 words, where does it lead? Where do
 the supporters of that position hope
 this situation would be in 5 years as a
 result of this continued nonmilitary
 support?
 Mr. LUGAR. This Senator would
 hope that the assistance which may be
 authorized today by the Senate would
 lead toward negotiations-specifically
 negotiations   among   Nicaraguans,
 which are the most preferable kinds.
 Also, it would encourage the ' Conta-
 dora process, and even a recognition
 that direct negotiation between the
 U.S. Government and Nicaragua will
 .be preferable to no 'negotiations and
 no progress. .       .
 .. It seems to me that through the hu-
 manitarianassistance route, but also
 the sharing of intelligence, sharing of
 political ' information-various  sup-
 ports that are provided in the Nunn-
 Lugar amendment-there is at least a
 holding in place of the strength of the
 Contra forces. Their presence is obvi-
 ous, and with assistance we would
 hope from others in the region, from
 European countries, from others that
 might be brought into the process, a
 movement toward negotiations would
 lead to a change in the government-
 plurality of parties, freedom of the
 press, some .movement of reassurance
 to the neighbors, some pledge of an
 autonomous foreign policy 'so that
 there would not be, the threat of
 Soviet incursion in there. That, I
 think, is a fair statement of where we
 hope this would lead.  -
 Now, the Nunn-Lugar amendment
 would also, however, leave open the
 opportunity for the President, after
 we have tried this process of negota-
 tion-bilateral, multilateral, or region-
 al-if this simply is not bearing fruit,
 to come back to the Senate and to ask,
 quite frankly, for military resources
 for the Contras so that they might
 move ahead in a different way. But
 the contemplation at least in the near
 term would be to give negotiations a
 full opportunity while keeping the
 Contras in place. And, in the longer
 term, if this does not work, to move
 toward military assistance.
 Mr. HART. If the Senator will yield
 further, it 'is difficult to quarrel with
 that hope, and certainly that policy,
 which I believe the vast majority of

 the Members of the Senate and the
 American  public  would  support.  I
 guess it is in fact the word "hope" that
 concerns the Senator from Colorado.
 What concrete evidence does the
 Senator from Indiana have that in
 fact the administration has policies to
 bring those negotiations about, to the
 degree that it- is within our power to
 do so? In other words, beyond "hope,"
 how does this aid.link to a leadership
 position of this administration, not
 waiting for things to happen but caus-
 ing those negotiations to happen?
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I think
 the answer to the distinguished Sena-
 tor from Colorado is that the Secre-
 tary of State has at every opportunity
 tried to make things happen in terms
 of negotiation bilaterally, in the Man-
 zanillo conferences that we have had
 with -the Sandinista government, and
 also through any number of other oc-
 casions in which we have tried to
 shore up the Contadora process and
 tried to get other of our allies interest-
 ed in the situation. I think we have
 pressed very hard. As the Secretary of
 State has pointed out, at some point
 when there does not appear to be any
 movement in negotiations-and our
 sense is that the Sandinistas have no
 incentive to be forthcoming-then a
 predicament occurs and the question is
 how to get things off dead center. How
 do you change the real politik of the
 situation in a way in which the Sandi-
 nistas might want to negotiate more
 seriously with anyone.
 Mr. HART. What incentive do the
 Sandinistas have to negotiate under
 our guidance or direction when we are,
 in fact providing the military assist-
 ance to try to overthrow them?
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it seems
 to me that they would have every
 reason to want to negotiate because
 the fact is that a cease-fire and peace
 would be preferable in Nicaragua to a
 civil war. It clearly would be prefera-
 ble for the trade embargo to be re-
 moved or other obstructions to be
 eliminated. In other words, there are a
 number of ways in which life in Nica-
 ragua might improve, as well as the re-
 lationship of the Nicaraguan people to
 its Government. These pressures, it
 seems to me, are felt. One can argue to
 what extent. Some can say they are
 felt very much. A core Marxist group
 never changes. But I suppose the pro-
 ponents of administration policy are
 more optimistic about the regime-
 hopeful even at this late stage that
 there might be some admission of an
 opposition  and  the  beginnings  of
 democratic institutions in Nicaragua.
 Mr. HART. But is not the argument
 a little like a man in an alley who is
 being, assaulted by another man with a
 club, and the man with the club as-
 saulting him says, "I want to talk to
 you," as he is banging him on the
 head-"I want to negotiate with you,
 and I am going to keep hitting you
 until you agree to negotiate with me?"
 The  formulation  of  the Senator
 from Indiana and the administration
 seems to me to ignore a basic fact of
 human nature, which is something
 called national pride.
 . If a nation is under attack indirectly
 by the people who are saying "We
 want to negotiate," the first thing that
 nation does is defend itself and say,
 "Well, we are not going to negotiate
 under the barrel of a gun. You with-
 draw the gun and then you come and
 talk to us about negotiations." Is that
 not the way human nature works?
 Mr. LUGAR. The Senator from Col-
 orado is an experienced student of his-
 tory. Various countries have negotiat-
 ed for all sorts of reasons. I am not
 privy to what the Sandinistas may
 have determined about their future in
 this respect. Clearly a sense of nation-
 al pride is there with that government.
 But I think other students of Nicara-
 gua have noted that essentially a
 Marxist government is incompatible
 with the nature of the Nicaraguan
 people and that there is a friction, by
 definition, between the government
 and the populace of present. This is
 not as yet a totalitarian regime that
 has been so thoroughgoing as to have
 squeezed out, cell by cell and neigh-
 borhood by neighborhood, all opposi-
 tion. I think it is a reasonable assump-
 tion that negotiations are still possible
 and, furthermore, a reasonable as-
 sumption that so long as there are
 Nicaraguans who have an equal claim
 upon the political process of Nicara-
 gua, we ought to support them. The
 gist of what we are debating today is
 whether that is a reasonable thing to
 do. I believe that it is, without being
 able to predict the success of future
 negotiations.
 Mr. President, let me say at this
 point that there are other Senators
 who are asking me for time. If the
 Senator from Colorado will withhold
 for the moment, I would appreciate it.
 Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Rhode Island.
 Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I ask Sena-
 tor Donn if he will let me have 8 or 10
 minutes.
 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may
 inquire first, how much time remains
 on the side of the proponents?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each
 side has 15 minutes.
 Mr. DODD. I will be glad to yield to
 the distinguished ranking member. 7
 minutes of those 15.
 Mr. PELL. Eight.
 Mr. DODD. Eight minutes.
 Mr.  PELL.  Mr.  President,  the
 Senate, today, has an opportunity to
 make a positive contribution to United
 States policy toward Nicaragua, an
 issue we have been dealing with for
 some time now. Needless to say, we
 have a formidable task and challenge.
 We are being challenged to consider
 a policy which is much more than pro-
 viding a relatively small amount of
 money to an insurgent force bent on
 overthrowing the Nicaraguan Govern-
 ment. We are being challenged to con-
 sider a policy dealing with the much
 larger and graver issue of war:,and
 peace, with stark implications for this
 country because of the prospect that
 U.S. military. forces must become di-
 rectly involved. Our response to this
 challenge ought to be to end the spi-
 raling cycle of fighting, violence, and
 terror that has placed our Nation in a
 difficult  international  position.  In-
 stead of voting to continue the war, we
 should be constructing a policy that
 will contribute to peace and justice in
 Central America.
 The key to peace in the area is held
 by the nations of the region them-
 selves.  The  Contadora  nations  of
 Mexico, Panama, Venezuela, and Co-
 lombia have worked hard against tre-
 mendous odds to formulate a treaty
 that would bring lasting peace to the
 region by gaining commitments re-
 garding the arms race, the presence of
 foreign troops, arms traffic, verifica-
 tion and control mechanisms, national
 reconciliation, and political reform.
 We all know by now, however, that in
 order for a Contadora treaty to be re-
 alized and effective, it must have the
 full and unfettered support of the
 United States. It will take more than
 lip service and generalized calls for
 peace in the region. The administra-
 tion must use all possible means to
 convince our friends in the area that
 the United States is percent behind
 the Contadora process as the best
 hope for peace in Central America.
 A parallel vehicle for peace in the
 region is the mechanism of bilaterial
 talks between the United States and
 Nicaragua, which were suspended by
 the United States. These talks, which
 the Nicaraguan Government believed
 were moving toward the improvement
 of relations, would have provided the
 direct contact necessary to resolve the
 very difficult issues that have devel-
 oped between our two countries. These
 talks would be an important comple-
 ment to the Contadora process.
 In dealing with the amendments
 that are before the Senate today, I ask
 my colleagues to seriously consider
 what their votes mean in terms of war
 and peace in the region, the implica-
 tions for direct U.S. military involve-
 ment, and the standing of the United
 States in the* world community of na-
 tions.
 Mr. President, I congratulate Sena-
 tor Donn on his amendment and I am
 glad to be a cosponsor. It is an excel-
 lent amendment and provides strong
 American support for the Contadora
 process, authorizing $10 million to
 assist in bringing about a negotiated
 political settlement.
 I think the fundamentally important'
 point here, a basic question in consid-
 ering whether or not we support the
 Contras, is what their role in life is.
 I should like to revert for a moment
 to the definition of terrorism. I read
 the following definition:
 International terrorism means activities
 that-

 S 7596                     CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 (1) involve viclent acts or acts dangerous
 to human life that are a violation of the
 criminal laws of the United States or of any
 State, or that would be a criminal violation
 if committed within the jurisdiction of the
 United States or any State;
 (2) appear to be intended-
 .(A) to intimidate or coerce a civilian popu-
 lation',
 (B) to influence. the policy of a govern-
 ment by intimidation or coercion; or
 (C) to affect the conduct of a government
 by assassination or kidnapping; and
 (3) occur totally outside the United States,
 or transcend national boundaries in terms
 of -the .means by which they are accom-
 plished ...
 Under that definition, it seems to me
 that the Contras fulfill the definition
 of being terrorists. They are our ter-
 rorists, and we should not be shy
 about calling them terrorists.
 The difference 'between a terrorist
 and a freedom fighter is very simple.
 Terrorists are indiscriminate in their
 targets. They kill men, women, and
 children and cause damage to civilian
 infrastructure. A freedom fighter, gen-
 erally speaking, aims for military ob-
 jectives.
 If we look down through history,
 there is a .difference between freedom
 fighters and terrorists. Obviously, very
 often, from the subjective, viewpoint,
 one country's terrorists will be an-
 other country's freedom fighter, but
 there is- a difference between the two
 that can generally be held.
 ' I think that if we look at our own
 early- history, we realize that our ~fore-
 bearers were not terrorists; they were
 freedom  fighters.  Throughout  the
 years, as countries have achieved inde-
 pendence and have had their revolu-
 tions, there has been this difference-
 whether the people who have been at-
 tacked in an indiscriminate form have
 been civilians. or whether they have
 been military objectives.
 - If something- looks like a duck, wad-
 dles like a duck, and quacks like a
 duck, then it probably is a duck. In my
 view, the Contras, by this definition of
 terrorists, are terrorists.
 We have inveighed against terror-
 ism. Some believe it is to our advan-
 tage that our terrorists should - be
 helped and supported. But if we truly
 disagree with terrorism as a means of
 affecting the policy of a nation's gov-
 ernment-and that is really the pur-
 pose of terrorism-then, in my mind,
 we should oppose terrorism in any
 form, anywhere, on any continent, no
 matter under whose auspices, whether
 under our auspices or anyone else's.
 For these reasons, I am glad to be a
 cosponsor of this amendment.
 I believe. we should not do anything
 to encourage the support for our ter-
 rorists, the Contras. In that regard,
 the civilian casualties of the Contras
 in Nicaragua as of dune a year' ago-
 the total civilian victims-were esti-
 mated to be 4,038. That is a good
 many. These do not include military
 people who have been killed.
 So, for all these reasons, I think this
 is an excellent amendment. From the
 viewpoint of public opinion at home-
 and while we should not always be the
 patsy of public opinion, we should be
 guided by it as well as what is in our
 country's best interests-the American
 people are against U.S. support of the
 Contras.
 According to a recent Harris survey,
 58 percent of the public is opposed to
 sending $14 million in nonmilitary aid
 to the rebels.
 On the trip that Daniel Ortega took,
 when he tried to get help from seven
 Communist countries-countries under
 Soviet domination-he also visited six
 countries not dominated by the Soviet
 Union: Sweden, Finland, Italy, France,
 Spain, and Yugoslavia.
 In addition, Vice President Sergio
 Ramirez, on earlier trips to Europe vis-
 ited  Western  European  countries:
 Spain, Great Britain,  Ireland, and
 France.
 So we can see that Ortega was look-
 ing for help throughout Europe. I will'
 agree that he got more help from the
 Soviet Union than anywhere else, and
 that is most deplorable and unfortu-
 nate-certainly from our viewpoint.
 Mr. WILSON. Mr. President, will the.
 Senator yield for a question?
 Mr. PELL. I yield.
 Mr. WILSON. It is a simple question
 and can be answered yes or no.
 I am wondering whether or not the
 Senator from Rhode Island considers
 that the guerrillas who were under-
 mining and subverting and, I would
 say, conducting terrorism against the
 Government and the civilian populace
 of El Salvador would be characterized
 by the Senator as the same guerrillas
 who are being armed and directed
 from Managua as terrorists.
 Mr. PELL. When they are attacking
 civilian targets, they are, to my mind,
 terrorists. If they are attacking mili-
 tary targets, some people might say
 they are freedom fighters. That is the
 difference between the two.
 Mr. WILSON. I thank the Senator
 from Rhode Island.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 5
 minutes to the Senator from Califor-
 nia (Mr. WILSON].
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from California.
 Mr. WILSON. I thank the distin-
 guished manager of the bill.
 Mr. President, in listening to my
 friend from Rhode Island, I was struck
 by what seems tome the inconsistency
 of a position that says that those who
 are freedom fighters in Nicaragua are
 terrorists, while those whom others
 would characterize as freedom fighters
 in El Salvador-who are indeed terror-
 ists, armed and directed from Mana-
 gua-are freedom fighters when they
 attack government positions.
 I would not make the distinction be-
 tween terrorists and freedom fighters
 in the same fashion. Indeed, I do not
 think it is very consistent to find the
 same person a terrorist and a freedom
 fighter, depending upon the target.
 I will agree that innocent civilians
 should not be the target of military
 action or of terrorism. There is no jus-
 June 6, 1985
 tifying that, in any instance. But when
 the government that is being attacked,
 even when it is through its army that
 it is being attacked, is that of a freely
 elected democracy-that being the sit-
 uation in El Salvador-you have a situ-
 ation that is enormously different
 from that in Nicaragua, where the
 Government, whether Marxist or not,
 is a Government that seized by power
 or force and has governed by force.
 I hope no 'one is persuaded that the
 charade that occurred there last fall
 was in fact the same kind of legitimate
 election  which  elected  President
 Duarte in El Salvador. It was, instead,
 the kind of sham we see 'take place in
 the Soviet Union.
 Mr. President, earlier today I heard
 my friend the Senator from Coruiecti-
 cut suggest that we should disassociate
 ourselves from freedom fighters' in
 Nicaragua because one day the Sandi-
 nista regime in Nicaragua will use
 them as an excuse to cross the borders
 into Honduras or Costa Rica, calling
 them terrorists, in much the same
 fashion that Israel sought to protect
 its northern borders and its popula-
 tion from the terrorists attacks of the
 PLO, who achieved free rein of south-
 ern Lebanon.
 Mr. President, what is wrong with
 that analysis is that it defies the truth
 of the difference in the situations.
 The people of Israel were in fact en-
 tirely justified in going after terrorists
 who were marauding, who were send-
 ing rocket rounds in Israel from their
 base in southern Lebanon.
 To equate that kind of terrorism
 with the sort of thing that has been
 going on either in Afghanistan or in'
 Nicaragua, as freedom fighters have
 attempted to fight back, is to simply
 say that all who attack a government
 whether it is a freely elected govern-
 ment or one that is despotic and in
 place by force are in fact terrorists
 and we must equate them and, there-
 fore, we must simply wash our hands.
 That simply makes no sense.
 Mr. President, the people of Central
 America know that they cannot stand
 up to a Soviet-Cuban financed regime
 of terrorism and subversion, one that
 somehow does not quite transcend the
 bounds of the Rio Treaty because it is
 not open aggression, not overt aggres-
 sion. But they know that ultimately
 their fate can be sealed unless they
 have some support. They are disposed
 to resist this revolution santeros that
 the Sandinista regime seeks to export
 beyond its own borders, violence, sub-
 version, and terrorism.
 But I think perhaps the clearest ex-
 ample of the kind of help they need
 has been made clear in a letter of
 April 4, 1985, from President -Duarte
 to President Reagan, and I know my
 friend from Connecticut, the sponsor
 of this amendment has a great admira-
 tion for President Duarte, one which I
 share, one that is deserved by history.
 He has hardly been an oligarch; rather
 he has been the victim of oligarchy.

 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator's 5 minutes have expired.
 Mr. WILSON. I ask for an additional
 2 minutes.
 Mr. LUGAR. Two minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator may proceed.
 Mr. WILSON. I thank the Chair.
 In his letter, President Duarte wrote
 to President Reagan:
 We remain concerned as we have been for
 some time by the continuing flow of sup-
 plies and munitions from Nicaragua to guer-
 rilla forces here in El Salvador which are
 fighting against my government and our
 programs of reformed democracy, reconcili-
 ation, and peace. This continuing interven-
 tion in our internal affairs is of great con-
 cern to us and we deeply appreciate any ef-
 forts which your government can take to
 build a broad barrier to such activities, ef-
 forts which a small country like El Salvador
 cannot take on its own behalf.
 Mr..President, what the President of
 El Salvador is saying is that he needs
 help against the kind of subversion
 and guerrilla activity that is being con-
 ducted against his Government. It is
 directed from Managua, it is supplied,
 it is financed with money from the
 Soviet Union and Cuban bloc.
 To try to equate these guerrillas at-
 tacking the Duarte government with
 the activities of the Contras is to
 simply ignore the very differences in
 their situation. The Sandinista regime
 that seeks to subvert other govern-
 ments through just guerrilla activity
 in El Salvador is the target of the Con-
 tras. If, in fact, we wash our hands, if
 we take the money that the Dodd
 measure would appropriate to get out
 of an association with freedom fight-
 ers, then.why do we not do the same
 thing with the Afghans who are resist-
 ing the Red Army in Afghanistan? Be-
 cause. Mr. President, there is a funda-
 mental difference. The truth is the Af-
 ghans are resisting an invader who has
 taken their land by force, and the
 same  thing  is  true  in  Nicaragua,
 though the invader happens to be not
 the Red army but the Sandinistas.
 I thank the Chair.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Indiana,
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 5
 minutes to the distingushed Senator
 from Minnesota. ?               -
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Minnesota is recognized.
 Mr. DURENBERGER. I thank the
 Chair. Mr. President, I am going to try
 to stay within the 5 minutes and make
 four or five points.
 First, at the heart of each of these
 amendments is the issue of who is at
 fault for what is going on. The Sena-
 tor from Connecticut referred to the
 two helicopters that were shot down
 and that will lead us into an endless
 debate about who started it, who is
 perpetuating it, and who is at fault.
 The reality is that you cannot blame
 the U.S. involvement except indirectly
 in the specific acts of violence that are
 taking place because we have not had
 a presence in Nicaragua since we stood
 on this floor a year ago debating
 whether or not to continue support for
 an alleged covert action.
 I think the reality is, and I was in
 Costa Rica on Friday at 2:20 in the
 afternoon when two of the civil guards
 were killed on the border, is now that
 the Nicaraguan issue is Nicaraguan
 and Nicaragua. And the role that we
 play here is in danger of becoming su-
 perficial to that issue.
 The Sandinistas have been killing E1
 Savadorans indirectly for at least 5
 years. They are now in the process of
 killing Hondurans and Costa Ricans in
 a very direct kind of a sense. Yes,
 mixed into the reality of why they are
 doing the killing, in the case of the
 Salvadorans it has something to do
 with popular. revolution in El Salvador
 which 'I think is successful but they
 are still feeding the killing and I think
 it has something to do with El Salva-
 doran people in FDN need to be at-
 tacked from Honduran or Costa Rican
 territory so you can indirectly find
 some play somewhere else.
 But the reality is it is Nicaraguan'
 against Nicaraguan today and it is in a'
 setting of Central American setting
 much more than it is an east-west or
 north-south kind of a setting.
 I would reply, in elaboration of the
 question of the Senator from Colorado
 about the long range. The long range
 in Nicaragua is democracy. That is the
 issue that we ought to be debating
 here today. The difficult question is
 who are the democrats? I do not mean
 in the sense of the folks across the
 aisle. But who are the democrats in
 Nicaragua?
 I originally opposed any involvement
 down there because I know there
 ,would be a day when we would be
 wrestling with who the true democrats
 are.
 The reality is today, and I-met with
 some of these people while I was
 there, the leadership on the democrat-
 ic side in Nicaragua will come from a
 large and enlarging group headed up
 by the tripe-A. The triple-A include
 Arturo  Cruz,  Alfonso  Robelo,  and
 S 7597
 ty problem. It is a national security
 problem for Central America.
 The reality is.that six Central Amer-
 ican countries cannot exist with a dic-
 tatorship in its heart. The heart of
 Central America has always been a de-
 mocracy. It has been stifled for years
 and years with the help of the United
 States. .
 Today democracy is alive and well in
 those countries and in every country
 except Nicaragua.
 There is a.grafitti all over San Jose,
 Costa Rica which is in Spanish "Co-
 mandantes to mismo que Somocistas"
 and that says the commandantes are
 all Somocistas.
 It is common consensus in Central
 America that  all  we  have  accom-
 plished, all the Costa Ricans accom-
 plished, with all of that support that
 they gave to the anti-Somoza forces,
 all they did was trade a military dicta-
 torship of one for a military dictator-
 ship of nine. That is the heart of the
 issue. It is not the U.S. policy as much
 as it is the future of Central America.

 which, in my judgment, offers a better
 foreign policy for our country.
 I yield back any remaining time that
 we have.  .
 Mr.  DODD.  Mr.  President, how
 much time do I have remaining?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Connecticut has 9 min-
 utes remaining.
 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for
 the yeas and nays on my amendment.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Is
 there a sufficient second? There is a
 sufficient second.
 The yeas and nays were ordered.
 Mr: DODD. Mr. President, I do not
 anticipate using the entire 8 or 9 min-
 utes remaining to me at all. I do not
 have any additional requests for time
 on this side so I will try to respond, if I
 can, to some of the comments that
 have been made since I proposed the
 amendment in my opening remarks.
 First of all, with regard to the likeli-
 hood of the Sandinistas changing any
 of their policies at all, my good friend
 and chairman from the State of Indi-
 ana, Senator LUGAR, indicated what I
 was suggesting was that there is no
 hope at all.
 What I was trying to point out is
 that if your stated goals have been to
 reduce the size of the Nicaraguan mili-
 tary, to improve democratic institu-
 tions from within, and to at least
 lessen the credibility of the Sandinis-
 tas internationally, that, over the past
 4 years, with the expenditure of a
 large amount of money in support of
 the Contra operation, we have not
 reached those goals.
 We are not talking about hopes and
 wishes and what our feelings are
 about, as I mentioned earlier, mem-
 bers of the Contras who are tremens
 dously sympathetic because of what
 they are trying to do. I am asking my
 colleagues here to make a choice about
 what makes sense for us. This is not
 just a question of wishing or hoping is
 it going to work. My response is it is
 not. Is it in our interest to continue a
 policy that is doing more harm than
 good? If one can stand up here and tell
 me how, as a result 'of what we have
 done in the last 4 years, Nicaragua is
 reducing its military buildup, it is
 moving to institute some of the demo-
 cratic reforms and promises it prom-
 ised prior to the overthrow of Somoza,
 I would be willing to listen to why we
 ought to continue to support the Con-
 tras.
 But, if you get the opposite effect, it
 seems to me we ought to have enough
 common sense to say, "Let's try some-
 thing else." Either that or give the
 Contras the type of aid they need to
 do their job. I hear my colleagues say
 they deserve our support. If they de-
 serve our support, why not give them
 support? We are going to argue about
 jeeps and band-aids and the United
 Nations and the Red Cross. If they
 qualify, give them help. If it is not
 working, we should try something else
 and we ought to have enough honesty
 and integrity to say that, as well.
 On the question of comparing this,
 my good friend from California sug-
 gested that there were some differ-
 ences between the Nicaraguans and
 the Israelis. Of course, there are. I was
 not drawing the comparison to the
 extent of two governments that are re-
 flective of each other in their policy.
 The comparison I was drawing was the
 reaction of the Israelis to the prob-
 lems as they -perceived them and we
 perceived them in their northern bor-
 ders and the southern part of. Leba-
 non. What the. Nicaraguans can point
 to is their problems on their northern
 border and the southern part of Hon-
 duras. And in that court of interna-
 tional public opinion, I would suspect
 today that the Nicaraguans would
 enjoy far more support in crossing
 that border to deal with that problem
 than they would have 2 years ago, 3
 years ago, or 4 years ago; that today
 they would appear to be operating
 under the color of right, protecting
 their sovereignty. .
 That is where the comparison begins
 and ends, not over the legitimacies of
 the two governments or whether or
 not you like the two governments or
 not, but whether or not they are going
 to appear as doing that which was in
 their self-interest to protect their sov-
 ereignty. That is the extent of the
 comparison.
 The Gallup and other polls and so
 forth that people talk about, I wish
 the work word "polls" never enter the
 debates around here, and they do too
 often. If we are deciding that we are
 going to set our foreign policies based
 on polling data, God help us. It is bad
 enough as it is. We start talking about
 whether or not 51 percent of the
 people like this policy or 49 percent do
 not. It is hard enough to try and fash-
 ion something, but if we start doing it
 based on polls every day to determine
 where a popular opinion is then we are
 in far more trouble than I imagined.
 So I hope we would keep polling
 data as far removed from the debates
 as possible. If it is the right thing to
 do, then we ought to do it. If it is the
 wrong thing to do, then, regardless of
 the amount of public support it would
 apear to have, we ought to try some-
 thing else.               -
 Again, Mr. President, let me just
 conclude by saying that I realize what
 I am offering here is a position that is
 quite different from what else we will
 debate today. But it seems to me it is
 the central question. Does this policy
 make sense for us? Is it working for us
 or is it not?
 Unfortunately, we will spend the
 rest of the day, and I suspect what we
 will adopt here will be adopted in the
 House, on some very nice little pack-
 age that will be very appealing to all
 of our constituencies back home: "We
 are giving aid to the Contras, but I
 promise you we are not going to give
 them anything to fight the fight with.
 We are going to give them band-aids.
 and trucks and jeeps and we are going
 June 6, 1985
 United Nations, AID, or the CIA, or
 delivered in some neutral' way by
 someone who will never be seen. Don't
 worry about it."
 That is what we are going to argue,
 not whether or not this policy makes
 sense. If it does, give it the kind of
 support it deserves. If it does not, then
 try something else.
 Mr. President, I thank my colleague
 from Indiana for his gracious com-
 ments about this, effort. I would' just
 say, in conclusion, that we will be back
 at this choice. I hope that will not be
 the case, but I will tell you at some
 point we are going to come back here
 to this choice, whether it is' in 5
 months, 4 months, or a year. We will
 be back here on this point. I hope we
 would make it sooner rather than
 later.
 Mr. President, I yield back whatever
 time I have remaining.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
 GOLDWATER). All time has been yielded
 back. The question is on agreeing to
 the amendment of the Senator from

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I move
 to reconsider the vote by which the
 amendment was rejected.
 Mr. DECONCINI. I move to lay that
 motion on the table.
 The motion to lay on the table was
 agreed to.
 AMENDMENT NO. 272
 (Purpose: To urge the United States to
 resume bilateral relations with the gov-
 ernment of Nicaragua. and to prohibit the
 introduction  of  Armed  Forecs  of  the
 United States into or over Nicaragua)   '
 Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Massachusetts.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I
 send an amendment to the desk and
 ask for its immediate consideration.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 amendment will be stated.
 The legislative clerk read as follows:
 The Senator from Massachusetts  [Mr.
 KENNEDY] proposes an amendment for him-
 self and Mr. HATFIELD numbered 272.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that further read-
 ing be dispensed with.
 . The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 The amendment is as follows:
 At the appropriate place in the bill, insert
 the following sections: `
 BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED
 STATES AND THE GOVERNMENT OF NICARAGUA
 SEC.  . It is the sense of Congress that the
 United States should resume bilateral nego-
 tiations with the government of Nicaragua.
 LIMITATIONS ON INTRODUCTION OF ARMED
 FORCES INTO NICARAGUA FOR COMBAT
 SEC.   .  (a) . Notwithstanding  any  other
 provision of law, none of the funds appro-
 priated pursuant to an authorization in this
 or any other- Act may be obligated or ex-
 pended                               for  the  purpose  of  introducing
 Armed Forces of the United States into or
 over the territory or waters of Nicaragua for
 combat.                            -
 (b) As used in this section, the term
 "combat" means the introduction of Armed
 Forces of the United States for the purpose
 of delivering weapons fire upon an enemy.
 (c) This section does not apply with re-
 spect to an introduction of the Armed
 Forces of the United States into or over
 Nicaragua for combat if-
 (1) the Congress has declared war; or
 (2) the Congress has enacted specific au-
 thorization for such introduction,. which au-
 thorization may be expedited in accordance
 with those expedited procedures set forth in
 Section 8066 of the Department of Defense
 Authorizations Act (1985), Public Law 98-
 473: or
 (3) such introduction is necessary-
 (A) to meet a clear and present danger of
 hostile attack upon the United States, its
 territories or possessions; or
 (B) to meet a clear and present danger to,
 provide necessary protection for, the United
 States Embassy; or
 (C) to meet a clear and present danger to,
 and to provide necessary protection for and
 to evacuate, United States Government per-'
 sonnel or United States citizens.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask
 for the yeas and nays on the amend-
 ment.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Is
 there a sufficient second? There is a
 sufficient second.
 The yeas and nays were ordered.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I
 asked for a division of the amendment
 as indicated on the amendment. The
 first division is on the section on bilat-
 eral talks between the United States
 and Nicaragua. The second division is
 on the introduction of U.S. combat
 troops in Nicaragua.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator has  a right to divide the
 amendment. The amendment is so di-
 vided.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary in-
 quiry, Mr. President. Do we have the
 yeas and nays on both?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 yeas and nays having been authorized
 for the division, it applies to both.
 Mr.  KENNEDY.  Mr.  President,
 there are two parts of this amend-
 ment, 'one dealing with the bilateral
 negotiations  and  the -second with
 regard to combat troops.
 The  distinguished Senator from
 Oregon is a 'cosponsor of the provi-
 sions dealing with the combat troops,
 and I will be glad to yield to the Sena-
 tor to address that particular issue if
 he would so like at this time. And then
 I will make the presentation with
 regard to both sections of the amend-
 ment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Oregon is recognized.
 Mr. HATFIELD. I. thank the Sena-
 tor from Massachusetts.
 Mr. President, I rise to support the
 entire amendment as offered by the
 Senator  from  Massachusetts  and
 myself, but I would like to make a few
 remarks at this time relating to that
 section that addresses the question of
 the introduction of American troops.
 Frequently, we hear the Members of
 this body and others say that there
 are no parallels between the American
 involvement in Central America and
 the American involvement in the war
 in Vietnam. .
 Obviously, there are definite dissimi-
 larities between those two actions and
 policies, but there are also some irref-
 utable similarities. One of them, I
 fear, is one that can happen in such a
 subtle way that we are caught un-
 aware. It was in this fashion that we
 found ourselves in the longest war in
 American history, a war that  was
 never declared, a Presidential war that
 was supported by the Congress. Why
 that occurred was, of course, subject
 to many interpretations, but I think
 one of them was because the Congress
 ducked its responsibility. It was a con-
 gressional responsibility from the very
 beginning. We failed to draw a distinc-
 tion between a Presidential military
 response that has always been consid-
 ered valid, which is to introduce mili-
 S 7599
 tary force to defend an immediate
 threat to the United States or its citi-
 zens and the introduction of U.S
 troops to conduct war without ac-
 knowledging that it actually is a war.
 Thomas  Jefferson 'established  the
 precedent for the former option very
 clearly under the African pirate case.
 But certainly the war we fought in
 Vietnam was not such a case, and the
 Congress never did stand up to its re-
 sponsibility to officially make a decla-
 ration of war.
 What this amendment proposes to
 do is simply require that there be a
 congressional authorization or a decla-
 ration of war before American troops
 are sent to Nicaragua.
 Mr. President, 2 or 3 years ago I ad-
 dressed this Chamber in terms of my
 concern about that possibility. I did
 not want to see the nightmare of Viet-
 nam repeated in the case of Central
 America. No one thought that it was a
 very serious concern to be expressed at
 that time. I think it is very interesting
 that the New, York Times carried a
 front-page story in which they con-
 ducted almost 50 interviews with offi-
 cials fiom various sources indicating
 that discussion of the invasion of Nica-
 ragua has been commonplace. in this
 administration-discussions of the in-
 vasion of Nicaragua. I think there are
 some people who would like the dis-
 cussion to become a bit more common-
 place. I think we have to be aware
 that this possibility is not way out. We
 are not engaging in some kind of theo-
 retical accusation. Nor was there one
 being made 3 years ago.,
 When we create the image of a
 threat to America by this little Cen-
 tral America republic today, we are
 also creating a responsibility that will
 ultimately be ours to destroy it. And if
 the forces that are operating there
 today cannot demonstrate capability
 to destroy it, then we have no other
 option but to introduce our own forces
 to "destroy this great threat to the
 American Republic."
 Now, in the debate in April we had a
 hate-in-everybody said, "I hate the
 Sandinistas more than you do. I just
 hate them differently." It was very in-
 teresting to watch the debate at that
 time on the floor. We had all kinds of
 suggestions: "We want to exhaust all
 the economic and diplomatic 'hate' op-
 tions before we go with the military
 option."
 Virtually everybody was willing to
 create a monster which we could de-
 stroy later, and the administration
 helped us along with trade sanctions.
 Then Ortega helped us along a great
 deal with his trip to Moscow-one of
 the dumbest things I ever saw pulled
 on any political stage. If stupidity
 were sufficient reason to set the stage
 for war, then Mr. Ortega deserves war,
 one might say, but the problem is that
 it will not be Mr. Ortega who will pay
 the price; it will be the peasants in the
 countryside, and the 14-year-old chil-
 dren the Sandinistas parade around in

 uniforms carrying guns, as reprehensi-
 ble a regime that it may be. But before
 we try to destroy the monster we are
 urgently creating, let us make sure
 that the American people agree.
 I do not want to get into one of
 those situations again where Members
 of Congress ran. around the country-
 side after it wasttoo late trying to say,
 "Well,  this  is  President Johnson's
 war." Of course it was President John-
 son's war, because. you had a gutless
 Congress that did not stand up to its
 congressional responsibility. But that
 in no way justifies it nor did that sanc-
 tify the war. It merely made it more
 reprehensible because it was such an
 unwinnable one. Mr. President, when
 we debated this issue in late April I
 said that what we do or do not do
 today affects the unfolding caricature
 of the Nicaraguan regime. I said that
 our responsibility is immense, because
 the mark we make on that caricature
 through our actions will go far in de-
 termining whether it will be necessary
 to send American troops to war tomor-
 row. To the extent that the caricature
 of that society is still unfolding; I be-
 lieve, Mr. President, we virtually guar-
 antee that our most sinister suspicions
 will be validated every time we fail to
 embrace opportunities to change it. I
 also said that everyone here who talks
 of  a  totalitarian,  Leninist-Marxist,
 Soviet beachhead in Nicaragua better
 know exactly what he or she is talking
 about because, if a majority of us are
 convinced of that now and act accord-
 ingly, we are going to have it. We are
 going to have it as sure as we are going
 to have to stop it one day in order to
 save face. We better be careful about
 that before we cross that xenophobic
 threshold.
 I still feel that these perceptions are
 not only valid, but that they have
 taken on certain new authenticity as a
 result of these reports-of discussion
 about invasion going on within the of-
 ficialdom of our Government.
 I think we also have to realize, Mr.
 President, that as we ask for this
 amendment to be adopted, we are not
 in any way blazing the trail for any
 new policy or any new proposal or any
 strange doctrine. I am merely asking
 along with my colleague from Massa-
 chusetts that we underscore and reem-
 phasize the congressional constitution-
 al responsibility. All we are suggesting
 in this amendment is that we reaffirm
 our basic commitment to the Constitu-
 tion. That Constitution states very
 clearly that, it shall be the responsibil-
 ity of the Congress of the United
 States to make a declaration of war
 before American troops are introduced
 into military action. We must realize
 that once those troops are introduced,
 with or without our authority, the
 President of the United States is still
 the Commander in Chief and he pros-
 ecutes the war.
 I am not suggesting that we take on
 the Commander in Chief's responsibil-
 ity. We are simply reaffirming our
 constitutional responsibility to take a
 specific action, prior to the introduc-
 tion of American troops into Nicara-
 gua. We do not say El Salvador. We do
 not say Honduras. We do not say
 Costa Rica. We do not say Guatemala.
 We say Nicaragua. That is the essen-
 tial purpose of this amendment. It is a
 simple reaffirmation of our constitu-
 tional responsibility.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this
 amendment is in two parts; the first
 part expresses the sense of Congresss
 that the United States should resume
 bilateral negotiations with the Gov-
 ernment of Nicaragua; the second part
 sets forth language similar to that
 which appears in the foreign aid pack-
 age that was passed by the House For-
 eign Affairs Committee prohibiting
 the introduction of U.S. combat troops
 in or over Nicaragua without prior ap-
 proval of Congress.
 I will deal with the first part of this
 amendment first.
 Last June, Secretary of State Shultz
 met with Daniel Ortega in Managua.
 At that time, the American people
 were told that the United States would
 begin to conduct discussions directly
 with the Government of Nicaragua.
 Many critics of the administration
 suggested that this initiative was po-
 litically  motivated,  that  President
 Reagan had only agreed to bilateral
 discussions with the Sandinistas as
 part of his campaign for reelection,
 and that as soon as the American elec-
 tion was over, the talks would be
 halted.
 But there were those of us who ap-
 plauded the President's decison. We
 had argued that military force should
 be a policy of last resort. We had con-
 tended that the United States should
 explore and exhaust diplomatic and
 political avenues for resolving our dif-
 ferences with the Sandinistas, and
 that we should do this before resorting
 to direct military pressure. There were
 those  of  us  who  saw  Secretary
 Schultz's trip to Managua and the
 talks that grew out of that trip as a
 promising step forward, a hopeful sign
 that, once the two parties began talk-
 ing together directly, progress might
 be made-not only in resolving differ-
 ences  between  Nicaragua  and  the
 United States but also in dealing with
 some of the obstacles that still'stood
 in the path of a Contadora agreement.
 And so we supported the talks that
 ensued at Manzanillo. Those discus-
 sions seemed promising. Both parties
 sent experienced and high-level diplo-
 mats to conduct the negotiations, and
 both parties were careful to keep the
 contents of their discussions out of the
 newspapers. The meetings went for-
 ward over the summer, into the fall,
 and on into the winter. After the June
 2, 1984, meeting between Shultz and
 Ortega at the airport in Managua, the
 parties sent their respective delega-
 tions to Manzanillo, Mexico for the
 first set of discussions on June 25-26.
 Thereafter, the delegations met on
 July 16 in Atlanta and then again on
 six other occasions in Manzanillo be-
 June 6, 1985
 tween the end of July and November
 20. The last set of meetings occurred
 on December 10-11, 1984. Thereafter
 the American delegation announced
 that it would not return to Manzanillo
 for the January meetings and that the
 talks would be suspended.
 There were those who expressed a
 certain cynicism about the decision to
 withdraw from the Manzanillo talks,
 pointing to the fact that the talks
 were initiated 4 months before the
 Presidential election in the United
 States and were then halted just 1
 month after 'resident Reagan was re-
 elected. The decision to halt these ne-
 gotiations was all the more disappoint-
 ing when we learned that the adminis-
 tration also wanted Congress to send
 $14 million in additional military as-
 sistance to the Contras. It appeared to
 many of us that we had returned to
 the mistaken policies -of the past and.
 that what should have been the course
 of last resort-the military option-
 was actually this administration's pre-
 ferred policy. We then learned, direct-
 ly from President Reagan himself,
 that it was the policy of the United
 States of America to make the Sandi-
 nistas "cry uncle" and to "replace" the
 Sandinistas with a "new structure." It
 is understandable that this adminis-
 tration might be reluctant to negotiate
 directly with a government that it is
 seeking to overthrow, and-in the con-
 text of the administration's decision
 openly to announce its intention of
 overthowing the Sandinistas-I can
 understand why the President would
 decide to call off the Manzanillo talks.
 But there are those of us who still
 believe  that the United States of
 America should not be in the business
 of overthrowing governments that we
 do not like. There are those of us who
 think it is wrong under international
 law and wrong morally for the United
 States to interfere in the internal af-
 fairs of another country the way we
 have been interfering in the internal
 affairs of Nicaragua. We still believe
 that the United States.should turn to
 the military option only as a last
 resort, when our own national security
 interests are clearly at stake, when our
 citizens are in danger or when our
 treaty obligations require us to do so.
 In the absence of those circumstances,
 we believe that diplomatic and politi-
 cal and other avenues of influence
 should be used before resorting to
 armed force.
 This amendment is very simple. It
 states clearly and unequivocally that it
 is the sense of Congress that President
 Reagan should direct Secretary of
 State Shultz to return to the negotiat-
 ing table with Nicaragua, to explore
 ways in which our differences might
 be, worked out peacefully, and to- ex-
 haust diplomatic and political avenues.
 Recently there was a hopeful sign
 that the- United States might be con-
 templating a return to the Manzanillo
 talks. On May 11, 2, weeks before Con-
 gress went into recess, the Security

 June 6, 1985
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD  :SENATE                   S 7601
 Council introduced a resolution con-
 demning the U.S. trade embargo of
 Nicaragua and calling on the United
 States to resume talks with the Nica-
 raguan Government. Of the 16 para-
 graphs contained in that resolution,
 the United States vetoed those 3 that
 dealt with the trade embargo but ab-
 stained on the' paragraph that called
 on the United States and Nicaragua to
 resume the suspended talks that had
 begun in Manzanillo. After the debate,
 U.S. Ambassador Jose S. Sorzano said
 that  the  United  States  was  "not
 against a dialog" with Nicaragua. I be-
 lieve                   that Congress should go on
 record in support of such a dialog.
 At a time when Secretary of State
 Shultz meets and talks with Foreign
 Minister Gromyko, at a time when
 President Reagan has expressed his
 desire to meet and talk with Mr. Gor-
 bachev, at a time when an American
 delegation is meeting and talking with
 a Soviet delegation in Geneva, at a
 time when the nations of the Conta-
 dora group are meeting and talking in
 a persistent and determined effort to
 resolve the conflicts in Central Amer-
 ica by way of a comprehensive region-
 al agreement, at a time when the
 United States has even negotiated
 with Mr. Castro about the return of
 some of those who had entered the
 United States from Marcel Bay, to get
 them returned to Cuba, surely it is not
 too much to ask the U.S. Government
 to open direct discussions with the
 Government of Nicaragua.
 Mr. President, all we are asking, is
 for this administration to "give peace
 a chance" and to return to the negoti-
 ating table. I urge my fellow Senators
 to support this part of the amend-
 ment.
 Mr. President, I say to the chairman
 of the Foreign Relations Committee
 that I would be glad to discuss the
 second part of the amendment if he
 would prefer, and then we could have
 a discussion on either part following
 that, or we could talk about the first
 part.
 Mr. LUGAR. If the Senator will pro-
 ceed with-the discussion of the second
 part, that is my preference, and I will
 attempt to discuss both parts.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President. as
 the Senator from Oregon has pointed
 out, the second section of my amend-
 ment, if enacted, will prohibit-the in-
 troduction of U.S. combat troops into
 Nicaragua without advance approval
 of Congress, except in a situation
 where the President determines that
 U.S. combat troops must be sent to
 meet a clear and present danger of
 attack upon the United States, its ter-
 ritories or possessions, to provide pro-
 tection for U.S. Government personnel
 or citizens, or where Congress has de-
 clared war.
 This is not the first time that the
 Senate has debated this question, but
 I hope it will be the last. At long last,
 we should respond to the concerns of
 the American people and send a clear
 message to this administration: We do
 -not want to :slip=slide 4rrto ;a :war in
 Central America without full consulta-
 tion with Congress, and we should not
 send American boys to fight and die in
 the jungles of Central America unless
 and until Congress and the American
 people have had 'a chance to be heard.
 I am offering this amendment today
 because of the mounting evidence that
 this administration is preparing to
 send U.S. combat troops to Nicaragua
 to finish what the Contras have start-
 ed. On May 23, in a speech before the
 American Bar Association in Washing-
 ton, DC., Secretary of State Shultz
 warned Members of Congress that if
 they did not approve renewed aid for
 the   American-backed   Nicaraguan
 rebels, "They are hastening the day
 when the threat will grow, and we will
 be faced with an agonizing choice
 about the use of U.S. combat troops."
 On April 17, the New York Times
 cited a classified report from the
 White House to Congress in which the
 administration stated that it has, for
 the time being, ruled out "direct appli-
 cation of U.S. military force" in Nica-
 ragua but warned that this course
 "must realistically be recognized as an
 eventual option given our stakes in the
 region, if other policy alternatives
 fail."
 According to the Times:
 The document contended that only direct
 pressure brought by expanded rebel forces
 fighting on Nicaragua's northern and south-
 ern borders could force the Sandinistas to
 accept United States demands.
 The document went on to state that,
 in order to "create real pressure on
 the Government of Nicaragua,"  it
 would be necessary for Congress to ap-
 propriate funds for a 20,000- to 25,000-
 man force in the north and a 5,000- to
 10,000-man force in the south.
 Thus, we see that it is the best as-
 sessment of the White House that it
 will take no less than 25,000 to 30,000
 men to create real pressure on Nicara-
 gua" and, says the White House, if
 this policy option fails, sending U.S.
 troops "must realistically be recog-
 nized as an option given our stakes in
 the region."
 I ask unanimous consent to print the
 April 17 New York Times article in the
 RECORD.                                          -
 There being no objection, the article

 A LARGER FORCE OF LATIN REBELS SOUGHT BY
 (By Hedrick Smith)
 WASHINGTON, April 18.-The White House,
 pressing for $14 million in aid for Nicara-
 guan rebels, has told Congress that it wants
 to expand the size of the insurgent forces to
 put more pressure on the Nicaraguan Gov-
 ernment.
 A document sent to two Congressional
 committees said the Administration had for
 now ruled out "direct application of U.S.
 military force" but warned that this course
 "must realistically be recognized as an even-
 tual option, given our stakes in the region, if'
 other policy alternatives fail."
 Publicly, President Reagan has given no
 indication of any plan to expand guerrilla
 forces. Talking to trade association lobbyists
 at a White House gathering today, he ac-
 cused Congress. of being "paralyzed over a
 mere $14 million in humanitarian aid."
 REPERSENTATIVE MICHEL URGES COMPROMISE
 Previously, Mr. Reagan had said that if
 the money were approved, humanitarian aid
 would be provided to the rebels during a 80-
 day cease-fire. He said it would then be
 shifted to military aid if the Sandinista
 Government did not reach a peace settle-
 ment with the rebels in that period.
 Reflecting the tough battle expected over
 the  President's  request,  the  Republican
 leader in the House, Robert H. Michel of Il-
 linois, urged Mr. Reagan today to be ready
 to compromise. His,advice came as propo-
 nents of the aid argued on Capitol Hill that
 it was needed for national security.
 DIRECT PRESSURE ON SANDINISTAS
 The  Administration  objective  was  de-
 scribed in the 22-page document marked
 "top secret" that was delivered by the
 White House to Congressional appropria-
 tions committees and later made available
 to The New York Times.
 The document indicated that the Adminis-
 tration was moving on two levels. Publicly,
 negotiations are being cast as the first prior-
 ity. But the document contended that only
 the direct pressure brought by expanded
 rebel forces fighting on Nicaragua's north-
 ern and southern borders could force the
 Sandinistas to accept United States de-
 mands.
 "Assistance provided to the Nicaraguan
 democratic opposition will be structured so
 as to. increase the size and effectiveness of
 its insurgent forces to a point where their
 pressure convinces the Sandinista leader-
 ship that it has no alternative but to pursue
 a course of moderation," Including major
 political  concessions,  the  White  House
 report to Congress said.
 The President's "determination," or offi-
 cial request and justification to Congress for
 funds, set out the objective of resuming aid
 "at levels sufficient to create real pressure
 on the Government of Nicaragua (20,000- to
 25,000-man insurgent force in the north and
 5,000- to 10,000-man force in the south)."
 Administration officials now estimate that
 the  Nicaraguan  Democratic  Force  has
 15,000 guerrillas fighting from bases in Hon-
 duras on Nicaragua's northern border and
 that the Revolutionary Democratic Alliance
 has 5,000 guerrillas fighting along Nicara-
 gua's southern border with Costa Rica.
 Presenting the rationale for the Adminis-?
 tration strategy of aiding Nicaraguan rebels,
 the White House document contended that
 the alternative would be an expensive and
 doubtful strategy of "containment" against
 Nicaragua. The containment strategy, it
 contended, could raise the cost of American
 economic and military aid programs in Cen-
 tral America from a current level of $1.2 bil-
 lion a year to as much as $4 billion to $5 bil-
 lion a year "for the immediate future."
 "The containment approach is obviously
 deficient in that it is passive and does not
 contemplate changes in Sandinista behav-
 ior," the White House contended. "Only
 major direct pressure can Induce change."
 Government sources said the document
 was delivered to Congress by the White
 House Congressional liaison office late on
 April 3, the day before President Reagan
 publicly unveiled his cease-fire proposal but
 after Mr. Michel had been informed of that
 plan. Its delivery formally set off Congres-
 sional consideration of the aid request.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE              June 6, 1985
 DECLASSIFIED VERSION OF DOCUMENT
 The White House put out a 16-page de-
 classified version of the document today. It
 contained some of the same general materi-
 al but excised any references to expanding
 the guerrilla forces, the Central Intelligence
 Agency operations or the role of third coun-
 tries.
 Roughly $80 million in formerly covert aid
 to the rebels, channeled through the C.I.A.,
 was cut off by the House last May. A later
 effort to revive it was delayed by Congress
 last fall, setting up votes this spring.
 The first Congressional action will come
 Thursday at hearings of the defense appro-
 priations subcommittees of both houses.
 The chairman of the House subcommittee is
 Representative  Joseph  P.  Addabbo  of
 Queens, a foe of aid to the rebels. The chair-
 man of the Senate subcommittee will be
 James A. McClure of Idaho, a leading sup-
 porter of the Administration on this issue.
 The Administration's official report to.
 Congress,  titled  "U.S.  Support  for  the
 Democratic Resistance Movement in Nicara-
 gua," enumerated guidelines for the "man-
 agement of the program,"  including "a
 small  U.S.  advisory  team"  that    would
 "maintain direct contact" with Nicaraguan
 rebel leaders.
 ROLE OF THE C.I.A.
 Although Congressional sources have said
 that in the past some American C.I.A.
 agents had entered Nicaragua with rebel
 groups, the latest White House document
 pledged that C.I.A. staff members and con-
 tract personnel would not enter Nicaragua
 or "participate in military or paramilitary
 operations of any kind."
 "U.S. presence will be limited to a small
 group of C.I.A. advisers outside Nicaragua
 whose function will be to provide intelli-
 gence, limited tactical advice based on that.
 intelligence and logistical  guidance," the
 document said.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Most recently, in a
 lengthy report in the June 4 edition of
 the New York Times, Government of-
 ficials are quoted as saying that a U.S.
 invasion of Nicaragua is now militarily
 feasible. In the words of one official,
 an  invasion  of  Nicaragua  by  the
 United States would be "like falling
 off a log ' ' * (T)hey'd never know
 what hit them." According to this
 Times report, Col. William C. Comee,
 Jr.,  the  director  of  operations at
 Southern Command, has estimated
 that it would take the United States 2
 weeks to gain control of 60 percent of
 the Nicaraguan population. Another
 U.S. official predicted that, in the
 event of intervention by the United
 States, "the Nicaraguan people would
 rise up in support of an American in-
 vasion and that neighboring armies
 would assist the United States eager-
 ly"

 [From the New York Times, June 4, 1985]
 U.S. MILITARY Is TERMED PREPARED FOR ANY
 MOVE AGAINST NICARAGUA
 (The following article is based on report-
 ing by Bill Keller and Joel Brinkley and was
 written by Mr. Keller.)
 PANAMA.-In the last.two years, the United
 States Southern Command, from its tropical
 hilltop headquarters here, has presided over
 the establishment of a sophisticated mili-
 tary apparatus in Central America.
 While President Reagan and his top advis-
 ers say the use of American military force in
 the region is an unlikely and undersirable
 last resort, the military is prepared for con-
 tingencies, according to military officers and
 diplomats in Washington and Central Amer-
 ica. Authorities say this has been accom-
 plished with a vigorous tempo of war games,
 construction of staging areas and listening
 posts, the creation of an elaborate intelli-
 gence network and a major effort to fortify
 allied armies.
 The United States military presence, once
 devoted almost exclusively to defending the
 Panama Canal, was expanded in the name
 of protecting stability throughout Latin
 America. More recently, the officials say, its
 focus has narrowed on Nicaragua, which the
 Reagan Administration believes is the main
 threat to peace in Central America.
 The military officers and diplomats said in
 interviews that the buildup of the Southern
 Command, one of six global subdivisions of
 the American military, is now largely com
 plete and that It is adequate to carry out
 any likely emergency in the region.
 These officials also challenged what they
 called the apparently popular belief that if
 the United States was drawn into direct
 military involvement in central America, it
 would inevitably lead to a Vietnam-style
 quagmire.
 "LIKE FALLING OFF A LOG"
 According to American military and intel-
 ligence assessments presented at the high-
 est levels of the Government, the United
 States could quickly and easily rout the
 Sandinistas who govern Nicaragua.
 An intelligence official whose opinions
 have been solicited by members of the Na-
 tional Security Council said that an invasion
 of Nicaragua was undesirable "from a prop-
 aganda point of view," but that if it became
 necessary it would be "like falling off a log."
 As  Congress begins another round of
 debate over how to deal with Nicaragua,
 both supporters and opponents of Adminis-
 tration policies are examining the military
 options embodied In the Southern Com-
 mand with renewed interest.
 One reason is that the Administration has
 begun talking more openly about the risk of
 American military involvement if Congress
 continues to foreclose less drastic measures,
 such as renewed military aid to the United
 States-backed Nicaraguan rebels seeking the
 overthrow of the Sandinista Government.
 Moreover,  United  States  and  Central
 American officials say, the unpredictable
 behavior of the Nicaraguan Government
 could increase the likelihood of American
 involvement at any time.
 PRUDENT, OFFICIALS SAY
 American military officials say the activi-
 ties at the Southern Command is prudent
 preparation for such dangers.
 "I can say with some confidence that the
 exercises have provided us with a signifi-
 cantly improved capability to operate in the
 region,"  said  Col.  Charles  Pearcy,  who
 heads the command's task force in Hondu-
 ras.
 Some critics, on the other hand, have long
 seen the muscle-flexing at the Southern
 Command in a more ominous light.
 Eugene J. Carroll Jr., a retired admiral
 who is director of the Center for Defense
 Information, a group often critical of the
 Pentagon, wrote last year that "accelerating
 U.S.  military  preparations"  in  Central
 America "suggest that the decision has al-
 ready been made by President Reagan to
 send U.S. troops into Nicaragua."
 House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.,
 brushing aside the . President's consistent
 statements that he is determined to avoid
 sending combat troops to Central America,
 said in April, "I've said all along that?I don't
 think the President of the United States
 will be happy until American troops are
 down there."
 THE COMMAND'S MISSION
 The decision to use military force would
 be made in Washington, but the preparation
 and execution are the responsibility of the
 Southern Command, known as Southcom.
 The headquarters, a cluster of neat frame
 buildings under coconut trees, has changed
 little in size or appearance since a few years
 ago when the command, in the words of its
 spokesman, Col. William C. Hansen, was
 "one of those final assignments" on the way
 to retirement.
 But in 1983 the Southern Commands' im-
 portance began growing in earnest. That
 year the Administration, fighting one anti-
 Government  insurgency  in  El  Salvador
 while underwriting another in Nicaragua,
 without fanfare rewrote the command's mis-
 sion statement.
 Once assigned primarily to defending the
 Panama Canal, the command was commit-
 ted,   among  other  responsibilities,   to
 "counter Soviet and Cuban militarization
 and other, destabilization undertakings."
 "There would not even be a United States
 Southern Command today, I am convinced,
 had it not been for the propensity of these
 Marxist-Leninists to pursue their own goals,
 ignoring the aspirations and needs of their
 own peoples" in Central America, Gen. Paul
 F. Gorman, the head of Southern Com-
 mand, told the Senate Armed Services Com-
 mittee in February, a few days before he re-
 tired.
 THE CHANGES ARE MADE
 General Gorman is widely considered re-
 sponsible for changing the command to suit
 its new mission.
 "When I came to Panama two years ago, I
 found an Army component very well de-
 signed to defend the Panama Canal against
 brawlers and rioters, but ill suited for sup-
 porting allies in the region," he told the
 Senate committee. He promptly disbanded
 the Army's canal-oriented mechanized in-
 fantry unit and sent to Washington for ex-
 perts in intelligence, communications avia-
 tion, medicine and construction.
 Within a year of General Gorman's arriv-
 al, Southern Command had begun to build
 or enlarge eight airfields in Honduras, using
 engineering battalions brought in for.mili-
 tary exercises. A member of the Senate In-
 telligence Committee who has toured the in-
 stallations recently described them as "a
 pretty sophisticated staging area."
 At' Palmerola, in the central highlands
 west of Tegucigalpa, the largest airstrip was
 dedicated last February.  The  8,000-foot,
 lighted, all-weather runway shimmers like a
 mirage in the midst of a sprawling military
 town of wood huts, camouflaged antiaircraft
 emplacements  and  repair shops.  It  can
 handle any plane the United States military
 owns, including jumbo C-5 and C-141 trans-
 ports and high performance fighter planes.
 VERSATILE PLANE SOUGHT
 Palmerola is home for Joint Task Force
 Bravo, the American operating arm in Hon-
 duras, established in 1983 to train Hondur-
 ans, build and maintain shared facilities, or-
 ganize war games and assist American mili-
 tary missions in the area.
 In the last year the buildup has contin-
 ued. The fiscal 1986 budget, for example,
 calls for moving to Southern Command a
 detachment of C-7 Caribou planes, a plane
 of.1960's vintage that can land on tiny, un-
 developed airstrips. General Gorman told
 the Senate that, whereas 30 airfields in Cen-
 tral America can handle C-130 cargo planes,

 the little Caribou can deliver troops or ma-
 teriel to some 900 locations.
 Much  of  the more recent activity  at
 Southern Command is not visible at all, in-
 volving intelligence-gathering.
 In his testimony, General Gorman said
 that he had built "a very close working rela-
 tionship with the entire intelligence com-
 munity" and that he met constantly with
 Central Intelligence Agency station chiefs
 in his region.
 A Congressional source said that within
 the last several months the National Securi-
 ty Agency had installed "the best technolo-
 gy we've got" at electronic eavesdropping
 posts ' on Tiger Island, in the Gulf of Pon?
 -
 seca near Nicaragua, and other locations.
 SUPPLIES OF FUEL IN PLACE
 The military has been thwarted by Con-
 gress in some of its more ambitious propos-
 als, including a plan for storing bombs and
 rockets at Palmerola and San  Lorenzo,
 about 40 miles from the Nicaraguan border.
 The Southern Command has, however,
 stored fuel. According to a classified Penta-
 gon report, the Southern Command on Jan.
 1 was the only one of the six regional com-
 mands that divide responsibility for Ameri-
 can military commitments around the globe
 that had stored 100 percent of its estimated
 oil requirements.
 In manpower, the Southern Command is
 the smallest of the six commands, with
 about 9,600 people stationed at various in-
 stallations in Panama and an average of
 1,200 troops in Honduras.
 But General Gorman noted that this was
 deceptive. Southern Command is designed
 to have a small permanent staff, but to
 draw troops, in event of conflict, from the
 United States Readiness Command, based at
 MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, and the
 United States Atlantic Command, based in
 Norfolk, Va., which patrols the Caribbean
 and the Atlantic.
 BEHIND THE WAR GAMES
 Getting those forces to Central America
 has been a central point of exercises con-
 ducted over the past two years.
 Until 1983, Colonel Hansen, the Southern
 Command's spokesman, said, the command
 staged only one sizable exercise a year, an
 annual drill called Kindle Liberty that prac-
 ticed defense of the Canal.
 Since 1983, the Pentagon has added sever-
 al major war games a year, testing on the
 playing field of Honduras virtually every
 wartime contingency that might arise in the
 region.
 In an exercise called Big Pine III, complet-
 ed May 3, the Americans staged Nicaraguan-
 style tank attacks near the Choleteca gap
 on the Honduras-Nicaragua border, while
 Honduran troops practiced defensive tactics.
 Universal Trek, which ended May 5, prac-
 ticed landings by Marines and paratroop-
 ers-and for the first time tested how the
 Pentagon would handle reporters covering
 an unannounced military operation.
 TROOPS WILL BUILD ROAD
 This year's third major Honduras exer-
 cise, beginning June 7, will send 1,800 Amer-
 ican troops to build a 15-mile road to the
 airfield at San Lorenzo and practice para-
 trooper attacks against guerrillas.
 Colonel Pearcy, the Joint Task Force com-
 mandei', said these war games served multi-
 ple purposes, including realistic training of
 American and allied troops, and served to
 remind the Nicaraguans of American re-
 solve.
 Most of the lessons could be applied to
 other regions. But the exercises, American
 officials said, have worked extensively on
 two abilities that would be essential in a
 Central American conflict: moving men and
 equipment to the region in a hurry and
 working in  tandem with  the Honduran
 Army, which American officals say would be
 a likely partner in any American military
 enterprise.'    -
 "What you do on the ground is often less
 important than the preparation for going,
 getting there an existing," Colonel Pearcy
 said.
 MILITARY ADVICE PROVIDED
 In addition to being host for.exercises and
 training, Southern Command has helped
 run a gradually increasing program of mili-
 tary aid and advice for Nicaragua's neigh-
 bors, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica.
 In May, the United States sent 20 Green
 Berets from the Army' Seventh Special
 Forces in Panama to train the Costa Rican
 civil guard in basic military skills at a new
 camp near the Nicaraguan border.
 The Defense Department siad it was the
 largest American military training team
 ever dispatched to Costa Rica, a neutral
 country that does not maintain an army,
 and the move prompted' protests from some
 Costa Ricans that the United States was
 pressing their country to militarize.
 THE DEBATE ON INVASION
 Whether these preparations are enough
 to assure American success in any military
 operation that might arise is still a matter
 of lively debate.
 No one in Government is suggesting that
 an invasion of Nicaragua Is imminent or de-
 sirable. Still, in recent weeks senior Reagan
 Administration officials have for the first
 time begun openly discussing this as a possi-
 bility.
 For example, in a 'speech to the American
 Bar Association on May 23, Secretary of
 State George P. Shultz warned members of
 Congress that if they did not approve re-
 newed aid for the American-backed Nicara-
 guan rebels, "they are hastening the day
 when the threat will grow, and we will be
 faced with an agonizing choice about the
 use of U.S. combat troops."
 Interviews with numerous American and
 foreign government officials in Washington
 and in Central America indicate that the
 possibility of United States military involve-
 ment in Nicaragua has become a matter of
 open discussion.
 THE FEARFUL ANALOGY
 One factor that has caused many Ameri-
 cans to recoil from the idea of direct mili-
 tary involvement in Nicaragua is the Viet-
 nam analogy.              '
 In a conflict with the United States, the
 argument goes, the Sandinistas would quick-
 ly retreat- to the 'hills like the Vietcong-
 jungle-wise          guerrillas-and  would  draw
 American troops into a bloody quagmire.
 "I think most people think it would be a
 very messy business, and don't want to do it
 for that reason," said Mark Falcoff, a Latin
 American scholar at the American Enter-
 prise Institute who was a consultant to the
 commission on Central America headed by
 former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissin-
 ger.
 In Nicaragua, where an American invasion
 is a topic of constant speculation, Cmdr.
 Julio Ramos Arguello, the army Chief of
 Staff, also said "this would be a kind of
 Vietnam war."
 But a contrary view seems to have gained
 wide acceptance within the Administration.
 The view is that an invasion of Nicaragua,
 however undersirable for political reasons,
 would not be such a difficult task in mili-
 tary terms.
 SANDINISTA DEFICIENCIES NOTED
 In interviews, American military officers
 and other Government officials familiar
 with the region argued that the Sandinistas
 S 7603
 lacked the military skills, the popular base
 and the supply lines to prolong a guerrilla
 war in the face of an American invasion.
 United States intelligence sources In the
 region have told their superiors in Washing-
 ton that major Nicaraguan installations are
 lightly _defended. In the Managua area, for
 example, an intelligence official said the
 Sandinistas had 13 potential targets that
 were protected by antiaircraft artillery, pri-
 marily 57-millimeter and 37-millimeter anti-
 aircraft guns.
 "If proper tactics and proper ordnance
 were applied to those sites, they'd never
 know what hit them," an intelligence officer
 said.
 This officer and others said that with
 minimal risk, American pilots could destroy
 the small Nicaraguan Air Force, radar, artil-
 lery, tanks, supply depots and command
 centers.
 According to a source who has discussed
 the subject with him, Col. William C. Comee
 Jr., the director of operations at Southern
 Command, has estimated that it would take
 the United States two weeks to gain control
 of 60 percent of the Nicaraguan population.
 Colonel Comee, who has overseen war
 games  and  other operations In  Central
 America since  1982, declined through a
 spokesman to be interviewed. In June he
 will replace Colonel Pearcy as commander
 of the Joint Task Force in Honduras.
 Another United States political-military
 officer in the region said the most plausible
 scenario in the event of a full-scale conflict
 would be this: "The U.S. would come in
 heavily for a month or so, mostly with air
 strikes against major facilities. Then a new
 government would be put into place, and it
 would come, with its own army."
 It would be up to the new government,
 presumably organized from  the existing
 democratic opposition, to pursue the Sandi-
 nistas, several military analysts said.
 "The Sandinistas would be up in the hills,
 but that would be a problem for the new
 Nicaraguan government," an American offi-
 cer said. "It wouldn't be our problem. We'd
 probably have a program like El Salvador,
 advisers and assistants, but no Americans in-
 volved in the fighting."
 One United States military officer who
 has briefed members of the National Securi-
 ty Council asserted that the Nicaraguan
 people would rise up in support of an Ameri-
 can invasion and the neighboring armies
 would assist the United States eagerly.
 In addition, the officer has told senior of-
 ficials in Washington that the Sandinistas
 would find the hills inhospitable because
 their presumed sanctuaries are now inhabit-
 ed by the rebels and by largely conservative
 farmers who consider the Sandinistas a
 threat to their private property rights.
 The officer said, "They've lost the support
 of people in the mountains," the officer
 said. "They'll get their heads chopped off
 up there."
 Commander Ramos, whose responsibilities
 include the defense of Managua, said in an
 interview that this was a dangerous assump-
 tion. The initial American assault, he said,
 would kill thousands of Nicaraguans. unit-
 ing the citizenry in their outrage.
 Another problem for the Sandinistas, ac-
 cording to several Amnerican military ana-
 lysts, is that Nicaragua has no counterpart
 of Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh Trail which was
 used to deliver the Vietcong ammunition
 and Other supplies from the North. In Nica-
 ragua, land supply routes would be through
 mountainous jungle, while air  and sea
 routes would be policed by American forces.
 "We .could seal that place tighter than a
 drum," an American military officer said.

 States had been unable to cut off arms traf-
 fic between Nicaragua and El Salvador, were
 not as confident that blocking arms to Nica-
 ragua would be easy.
 American intelligence reports show no evi-
 dence the Sandinistas have prepared large
 caches of ammunition or fuel in the hills,
 according to one knowledgeable official.
 Commander Ramos said: "We do have some
 things. Not many. Some fuel."
 Colonel Pearcy, commander of the United
 States task force in Honduras, and other an-
 alysts noted that for the United States, the
 logistics would be much more favorable
 than they were in Vietnam. In addition to
 shared facilities in Honduras, the United
 States has bases in Panama and Puerto
 Rico, and Nicaragua is a five-hour transport
 plane flight from the American mainland.
 Colonel Pearcy added a cautionary note.
 "I've been in the Army 24 years, and I've
 never seen anything neat."
 Other American officials noted that even
 the 1983 invasion of Grenada, in which
 Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine units
 swarmed onto a tiny island, left 18 Ameri-
 can servicemen dead and 116 wounded.
 Invading Nicaragua, said Senator Sam
 Nunn of Georgia, who is the senior Demo-
 crat on the Armed Services Committee,
 "would be a much tougher military situa-
 tion than that."
 THE POLITICAL PITFALLS
 Many experts say the worst difficulties of
 a United States invasion would be political
 rather than military.
 One would.be assembling a stable govern-
 ment in Managua from the contentious mili-
 tary and political rebel groups. Another
 would be a possible torrent of refugees into
 neighboring countries.
 A senior Costa Rican official said that in
 the event of an invasion, his Government
 would probably issue a statement blaming
 the Sandinistas for provoking it. But he
 "added: "We will suffer the consequences.
 We will have the Sandinista leaders in Costa
 Rica. We will have hundreds upon thou-
 sands or refugees. We will have instability."
 An a third consequence, some experts say,
 would be a deep and lasting resentment in
 Latin America.
 "You have to understand the emotional
 scar tissue left there by our historical in-
 volvement in the region," said a former Ad-
 ministration  official,  who  supports  the
 present White House policy. "The political,
 emotional,  psychological  cost would be
 high."

 NICARAGUA AND THE U.S. OPTIONS: AN
 INVASION IS OPENLY DISCUSSED
 (The following article is based on report-
 ing by Joel Brinkley and Bill Keller and was
 written by Mr. Brinkley.)
 WASHINGTON,  June 4.-Reagan Adminis-
 tration officials have begun openly discuss-'
 ing a subject they had previously refused
 even to speculate about: the possibility that
 American combat forces might one day be
 sent into Nicaragua.
 No one in Government is saying that an
 invasion is imminent or desirable. But in the
 'last few weeks, President Reagan, Secretary
 of State George P. Shultz and other senior
 officials have for the first time begun warn-
 ing that if other policies fail, the United
 States may be left with little choice in the
 years ahead:   w
 Interviews with almost 50 military, diplo-
 matic and foreign government experts in
 Washington, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicara-
 gua and Honduras indicate that discussion
 of the issue has become commonplace in of-
 ficial circles.
 The interviews and other inquiries also
 brought to light these points:
 Although no one in Congress has publicly
 called for United States military involve-
 ment in Nicaragua, the mood in Capitol Hill
 in the last few weeks appears to have shift-
 ed sharply against the Sandinista Govern-
 ment. Many members say there is growing
 doubt that any of the policy options still
 available, including renewed aid to the in-
 surgents, is likely to bring fundamental
 changes in the Sandinistas' behavior.
 The Administration has agreed that a
 number of possible situations would leave
 the United States little choice but to use
 military force. They include Nicaragua ac-
 quisition   of   high-performance   fighter
 planes and the granting to the Soviet Union
 of the right to establish a military base in
 the country.                       -
 Both critics and sympathizers of the San-
 dinistas say they would not be surprised if
 Nicaragua committed an act that provoked
 American intervention.
 In Central America, American officials
 and others assert that Nicaragua's neigh-
 bors are growing more concerned by the day
 about the Sandinistas' policies. In Nicara-
 gua, an American official said, business
 groups and others are asking, "When are
 you coming?"
 In public and in private, the Joint Chiefs
 of  Staff,  Defense  Secretary  Caspar  W.
 Weinberger, the White House national secu-
 rity  adviser,  Robert  C.  McFarlane,                                                                  Mr.
 Shultz and, most importantly, President
 Reagan, all have said they hope the United
 States is never called upon- to send Ameri-
 can forces to Nicaragua. Still, every official
 interviewed said that events beyond United
 States control could change that almost
 overnight.
 CONGRESS IS OPPOSED TO MILITARY ROLE    -
 Without support from Congress, Adminis-
 tration officials agree, military involvement
 in Nicaragua is most unlikely. Today, Con-
 gress remains implacably opposed.
 Many members reacted with alarm last
 month when President Reagan, in a classi-
 fied report to Congress, said the use of
 American military force in Nicaragua "must
 realistically be recognized as an eventual
 option in the region, if other policy alterna-
 tives fail."
 In a speech to the American Bar Associa-
 tion on May 23, Mr. Shultz warned members
 of Congress that if they did not approve re-
 newed aid for the American-backed Nicara-
 guan rebels, "they are hastening the day
 when the.,threat will grow, and we will be
 faced with an agonizing choice about the
 use of American combat troops."
 And in an interview on May 22, Fred C.
 Ikle, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy,
 warned that if Congress persisted in what
 he called "a policy of pinpricks," it raised
 the risk of "some variant of the Cuban mis-
 sile crisis."
 "What are you going to do two or three
 years from now, when Nicaragua is fully
 armed?" he asked. "Are you going to pro-
 voke another Cuban missile crisis? Are you
 going to send in the Marines?"
 At the same time, the Nicaraguan Govern-
 ment's  reputation  on  Capitol  Hill  has
 soured in the last few weeks.
 "The Sandinistas don't have any friends
 up here any more," an aide to the House
 Democratic leadership said. "The change
 has been almost palpable."
 SANDINISTA'S TRIP COSTS HIM SUPPORT
 A key event behind the change was the
 trip to Moscow by Nicaragua's President,
 Daniel  Ortega Saavedra. The announce-
 ment came on the day "the House was voting
 on renewed aid to the rebels, and many
 members  of  Congress  said  they  were
 stunned by the, timing.
 Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the senior
 Democrat on the Armed Services Commit-
 June 6, 1985
 tee, said: "What he did was rather stupid,
 from the Sandinistas' own point of view. It'
 certainly cost them support up here."
 The  clearest  demonstration   of  the
 changed view is that both houses are now
 considering renewed aid to the Nicaraguan
 rebels, even though the House refused to
 approve aid in any form just a few weeks
 ago.
 So far, however, Congress has shown little
 interest in granting the type of aid the Ad-
 ministration says is most needed* military
 aid. And Gen. Paul F. Gorman told Con-
 gress in February that, even with renewed
 military aid, the rebels could not be expect-
 ed to change the Sandinista Government
 "in the foreseeable future."
 The next most likely step, several officials
 said, is the ending of diplomatic relations
 with Managua.
 "I think that is going to happen," said
 Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Re-
 publican who is chairman of the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee. "But I don't
 know how soon."
 If relations were ended, "then we might
 recognize a government in exile," Mr. Lugar
 said, referring to an idea that has been dis-
 cussed among Administration officials.
 A senior official in the region said "we
 could permanently station U.S. forces" in
 Honduras. If that fails, the official added, "I
 guess the strategy would be a policy of con-
 tainment," meaning heavily arming Nicara-
 gua's neighbors. But Mr. Ikle said, "We
 know from experience that that doesn't
 work."
 THE CHANGES DEMANDED BY THE
 ADMINISTRATION
 In general, the Reagan Administration
 has demanded that Nicaragua demilitarize,
 cut its ties with the Soviet Union and Cuba
 and change its form of government to a plu-
 ralistic democracy.
 But many officials in both the Nicaraguan
 and United States Governments believe the
 prospects are remote that the Sandinistas
 will adopt policy changes that would be sat-
 isfactory to the United States.
 "They are hellbent on pursuing their
 policy," Mr. Ikle said. "The idea that you
 can strike a deal with them seems unrealis-
 tic."
 In a speech in April, Nicaragua's Presi-
 dent, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, said: "The
 United States still doesn't understand that
 this is an irreversible revolutionary process.
 Here, there can be no backward steps."
 Senator Lugar said some members of Con-
 gress already believed that "the time for re-
 demption is past" and that "a Marxist gov-
 ernment can't reform."
 In the months and years ahead, a Senate
 aide said, if further diplomatic sanctions are
 tried and fail, the military option may seem
 more tempting. "If you try everything and
 none of it works," he said, "then eventually
 you have everyone nibbling at the same
 bait."
 WHERE THE U.S. DRAWS THE LINE
 Asked  under  what  circumstances  the
 United States might attack  Nicaragua,
 American and Nicaraguan officials say the
 line is most clearly drawn against the acqui-
 sition by Nicaragua of high-performance
 warplanes.
 Last November, American officials said
 that they suspected Soviet-made MIG-21 jet
 fighters were aboard a cargo ship bound for
 Nicaragua and that they would probably
 order what they called a "surgical" air
 strike to destroy the planes.
 If the planes were aboard the ship, they
 were never unloaded. But when asked this
 month if the Nicaraguan Government had
 given tip the idea of acquiring MIG's, Cmdr.

 June 6, 1985                CONGRESSIONAL .RECORD - SENATE
 Julio Ramos Arguello, chief of intelligence
 for the Nicaraguan Army, said simply, "No."
 At the same time, American officials say
 they have not dropped the threat to destroy
 any such planes and in fact they have
 broadened it to include Czech-built L-39 jet
 training planes and similar aircraft.
 The  idea is  that American warplanes
 would destroy the new planes and try not to
 hit anything else. Then in theory the attack
 would end. But it senior Administration offi-
 cial said: "I've never been able to see how
 that kind of phased operation stops because
 it sets off an action-reaction. If we hit the
 airport and maybe kill 80 or 90 people, they
 could come at the embassy."
 In Managua, Commander Ramos said, "If
 the airplanes arrive, and if they bomb us,
 obviously we will be doing something about
 it.,,
 Another circumstance would be the estab-
 lishment of a Soviet-bloc military base in
 Nicaragua.
 A  senior  Administration  official  said:
 "Access for Soviet Backfire or Bear bomb-
 ers, port rights-any kind of Soviet military
 access, even without the presence of weap-
 ons systems. That would be a threshold."
 Nicaraguan and Soviet officials say they
 have no such plans.
 ADMINISTRATION FEARS "A SECOND CUBA"
 Still another circumstance, Administra-
 tion officials say, would be the consolidation
 of Nicaragua's Government into what Ad-
 ministration officials often call "a second
 Cuba," meaning a heavily controlled, Soviet-
 bloc dictatorship  that actively promotes
 Marxist revolution elsewhere.
 A senior American diplomat in the region
 said, "Above all, Ronald Reagan is a con-
 summately pragmatic man" who would not
 use force if the circumstances did not war-
 rant it.
 But Mr. Ikle said, "Even members of Con-
 gress say they are not going to permit a
 second Cuba."
 With "a second Cuba," Senator Lugar
 said, "we might be invited" by Nicaragua's
 neighbors to invade "as we were invited in
 the East Caribbean." Before the invasion of
 Grenada in October 1983, the leaders of sev-
 eral Caribbean island-nations formally re-
 quested American military intervention.
 HOW ITS NEIGHBORS VIEW NICARAGUA
 "In public and private," Senator Nunn
 said, the other countries of Central America
 "would be strongly opposed" to an Ameri-
 can invasion of Nicaragua.
 But many American military and diplo-
 matic officials and others in the region have
 reported a different view to their superiors
 in Washington.
 A senior diplomat in San Jose asserted
 that "an awful lot of Costa Ricans" would
 in fact welcome an invasion.
 A Costa Rican official who opposes the
 idea acknowledged that his Government
 probably would not condemn it.  If the
 United States invaded, he said, his Govern-
 ment would issue a statement "saying some-
 thing like it is unfortunate that the Cuban
 and Soviet advisers were invited in, and that
 the Sandinistas provoked it."'
 Costa Rica's Public Security  Minister,
 Benjamin Piza Caranza, said, "There,? no
 way we can live with a Marxist-Leninist
 state on our border that is open to export-
 ing revolution." But he declined to specu-
 late about how his country would react to
 an American invasion.
 In Honduras, President Roberto Suazo
 Cordova has been quoted as saying that
 Nicaragua is "like a cancer: the only cure is
 to cut it out."
 There is also a large and growing body of
 opinion within the Administration that the
 majority of Nicaraguans would welcome an
 American invasion,, several American offi-
 cials said.
 An American intelligence officer who has
 interviewed dozens of people in Nicaragua
 said: "What the people tell me is 'we'd get
 out of your way and let you take care of the
 Sandinistas'" if American troops landed.
 The biggest problem United States forces
 would face, he added, would be preventing
 "severe retribution" against Sandinista offi-
 cers.
 POLLING THE PEOPLE ON MANAGUA STREETS
 This officer has been called upon to brief
 numerous senior Administration officials on
 his views, including Mr. Weinberger, Mr.
 McFarlane and Gen. John W. Vessey Jr.,
 the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
 Representative Glenn English, an Oklaho-
 ma Democrat who opposes some elements of
 the Reagan Administration's policy in Nica-
 ragua, said the officer had briefed him too,
 but Mr. English was skeptical. So while in
 Managua this month, he and Senator David
 L.  Boren,  another Oklahoma Democrat,
 interviewed about 15 Nicaraguan citizens
 they chose at random on the streets.
 "They were pretty strong on condemna-
 tion of the Government," Mr. English said.
 "Virtually all of them said they wanted a
 change in Government, and one lady said
 flat out, without being asked, that she
 wanted the U.S. to invade."
 A spokeman for the Sandinista Govern-
 ment, Maria Christina Arguello, said: "They
 may criticize the Government now because
 of the economy and the shortages" of food
 and other items. "But when there is an
 emergency, you can be sure they will take
 up arms."                  -
 WILL THE NICARAGUANS PROVOKE AN ATTACK?
 It is difficult to find anyone, friend or foe
 of the Nicaraguan Government, who is con-
 fident the Sandinistas will not make a mis-
 calculation that could lead to a military con-
 frontation with the United States.
 Sandinista officials have said they are
 being careful not to give the United States a
 pretex to attack.
 But Edward L. King, a retired Army lieu-
 tenant colonel who opposes Reagan Admin-
 istration policy in Nicaragua and has spent
 months there talking to numerous Sandi-
 nista officers, says he believes "the chances
 are pretty good" that Nicaragua will err in a
 manner that could lead to an American mili-
 tary response.
 The view of Mr. King, who has wide mili-
 tary and civilian experience in Latin Amer-
 ica, is noteworthy because he knows the
 Sandinistas well and because they say.they,
 trust him. After observing them, Mr. King
 said, he has concluded that "some of them
 hate us so much they almost have a death
 wish."
 Some members of the Sandinista leader-
 ship, he added, "almost want a confronta-
 tion with us." "The hotheads say, 'Yeah,
 bring the gringos in here' just so they can
 kill a few of them."
 "I make no case for the Sandinistas," Mr.
 King said. "They are real blunderers."
 An American official with wide experience
 in Nicaragua said it was "martyrdom," not
 blundering, that might cause the Sandinis-
 tas to prompt the United States to invade.
 "I think it is their sense that the revolu-
 tion is bogged down anyway, and maybe it
 wouldn't be such a bad thing if they could
 survive" an invasion "and be a legend."
 In Managua, Sandinista officials say all
 such speculation is nonsense. Commander
 Ramos and others said the Nicaraguan Gov-
 ernment was interested in negotiation with
 the United States, not military confronta-
 tion.
 Mr.  KENNEDY.  Mr.  President,
 these are the words and deeds of a
 S7605
 government preparing to do what is
 necessary to achieve its objectives in
 Nicaragua-including  sending U.S.
 combat troops to war.
 Now the administration has repeat-
 edly stated it has no intention of send-
 ing U.S. combat troops into Central
 America. The Secretary of Defense
 has told us that the Defense Depart-
 ment has no plan, no strategy, no
 thought of putting U.S. combat troops
 in Central America. We are all encour-
 aged by such statements and would
 like to believe them.
 But the facts give us cause for con-
 cern.
 First, U.S. military assistance to the
 countries in the region has grown by
 leaps and bounds over the past 5
 years.
 Second, the United States has built
 an immense military infrastructure in
 Central America that is clearly intend-
 ed to support the deployment of thou-
 sands  of  American  troops  in  the
 region.
 Third, the United States has con-
 ducted perpertual military maneuvers
 in Central America, involving as many
 as 5,000 military personnel in the Big
 Pine exercises.
 Fourth, the United States has ac-
 tively intervened in the internal af-
 fairs of Nicaragua not only through
 our support of the Contra operations
 but also with direct action by Ameri-
 cans. We learned, for example, that
 the Defense Department consciously
 sought to intimidate the Nicaraguans,
 to make the Nicaraguans think that
 the United States was on the verge of
 invasion. A senior State Department
 official confirmed that there was a
 perception management program at
 work and said, "Every time there's an
 invasion scare, they make some con-
 cessions. We -learned that American
 surveillance aircraft flew over Mana-
 gua with the specific purpose of caus-
 ing sonic booms to scare the Nicara-
 guans.
 Another official stated that one of
 the central purposes of the military
 exercises was to create the fear of an
 invasion.  He said  that  the  troops
 "push very close to the border, deliber-
 ately, to set off all the alarms."
 We also learned from a report that
 appeared in the Wall Street Journal
 last March that CIA personnel were
 directly  involved  in  attacking  and
 mining Nicaragua's harbors, that, in
 air and sea raids, Americans flew and
 fired directly on Nicaraguan positions,
 and that a CIA plane provided sophis-
 ticated reconnaissance guidance for at-
 tacks by Contra helicopters.
 The  conclusion  is  unmistakable:
 This administration is preparing for
 war in Nicaragua. We are systematical-
 ly placing U.S. ships, planes and per-
 sonnel in harm's way, by injecting
 them into situations where, directly or
 indirectly, they are increasingly in-
 volved in the hostilities. The trend is
 clear, and the Reagan administration's
 aims are similarly clear, I do not think

 that the United States should send its
 soldiers into Central-America for'the
 purpose of fighting a war unless Con-
 gress and the American people have
 been consulted and given their approv-
 al in advance.
 I offer an amendment that will cor-
 rect this situation by prohibiting the
 introduction of U.S. Armed Forces
 into or over Nicaragua for the purpose
 of combat without advance approval
 of Congress.
 This amendment reflects the deep
 and growing concern of the American
 people  that  this  administration' is
 taking us to war in Central America.
 As stated in the amendment, the
 word "combat" means "the introduc-
 tion of U.S. Armed Forces for the pur-
 pose of delivering weapons fire upon
 an enemy." U.S. Armed Forces are not
 precluded from conducting military
 training in El Salvador. Nor does the
 amendment limit flights by American
 military aircraft in the region carrying
 out reconnaissance activities. Only the
 introduction of U.S. Armed Forces for
 the purpose of delivering weapons fire
 upon an enemy is prohibited.
 The amendment does not apply in
 all circumstances. The exceptions are
 clearly stated:
 This prohibition does not apply if
 Congress has declared war or enacted
 specific authorization for such intro-
 duction.
 The prohibition does not apply when
 such introduction is necessary to meet
 a clear and present danger of hostile
 attack upon the United States, its ter-
 ritories or possessions.
 The prohibition does not apply when
 such introduction is necessary to meet
 a clear and present danger to, and to
 provide necessary protection for and
 to evacuate, U.S. Government person-
 nel or U.S. citizens.
 The amendment .leaves to the Presi-.
 dent the determination of when force
 As necessary under the circumstances I
 have  just  listed.  The  amendment
 thereby preserves the President's au-
 thority to respond to threats to the
 United States, its embassies, person-
 nel, and citizens.
 A number of my colleagues have ex-
 pressed  concern  about  how  this
 amendment affects the War Powers
 Resolution. We know at the current
 time that if -the President of the
 United States decides to send Ameri-
 can troops into combat in Nicaragua,
 he is free to do so and would only nave
 to notify the Congress under the pro
 cedures of the War Powers Act. He
 would then be able to maintain those
 troops for a period of 60 days. What
 this particular amendment provides is
 that,  prior to the  involvement of
 American combat troops in' combat, as
 defined in the amendment, the Presi-
 dent must obtain positive approval, by
 the Congress before sending those
 troops. We are simply asking that the
 Congress be permitted to act prospec-
 tively, not after the fact.
 . I believe, Mr. President, that given
 the factual situation-the escalation of
 American involvement in. the region
 with more and more U.S. military per-
 sonnel in that area and with the kind
 of activities that I mentioned earlier in
 my statement, that it is important
 that we, the Congress, play some role
 in  the  decision  before  American
 combat troops are sent to Nicaragua
 for the purpose of delivering weapons
 fire upon an enemy.
 President Reagan has stated that he
 has no intention of introducing U.S.
 Armed Forces in Central America for
 combat. And he has promised to con-
 sult with Congress before taking any
 such action if such action is needed.
 This amendment simply takes the
 President at his word and puts into
 law what has been -stated as the ad-
 ministration's official position.
 This amendment will not affect the
 activities of the current military advis-
 ers assigned to El Salvador, nor their
 role in assisting in the training of the
 Salvadoran military. It will not limit
 the current reconnaissance flights by
 U.S. military aircraft in the region. It
 will not limit the ability of the U.S.
 Naval or Air Forces in the high seas or
 in the air to monitor Soviet or other
 naval activities of concern to our
 Armed Forces.     -
 It will not inhibit any duly author-
 ized  military  operations  currently
 under way in Central America or else-
 where in the Caribbean. It will in no
 way limit our treaty. obligations in the
 region, or in the hemisphere and it
 will allow the President to use U.S'.
 combat forces to eliminate any threat
 he deems is a clear and present danger
 to the United States, and under this
 legislation, it will not in any way limit
 the President's power to defend our
 vital security interests, to use U.S.
 combat forces for example in a pre-
 emptive strike against any missiles
 that might be introduced in Central
 America by the Soviet Union.
 It will not inhibit the President in
 his power to use U.S. combat forces to
 protect American lives. Under this leg-
 islation, for example, the President
 would have been justified in using the
 U.S. combat forces to intervene in
 Grenada.
 Mr. President, a similar amendment
 carried overwhelmingly,in the House
 last year. While it was defeated last
 year in the Senate, I think the situa-
 tion in Central America has become
 dramatically worse. I think Congress
 should be involved in the takeoff, and
 not just in the landing, when Ameri-
 can troops are to be sent into combat.
 I urge my colleagues to support this
 amendment.
 I reserve the balance of my time.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appre-
 ciate, the arguments of the distin-
 guished .Senators from Oregon and
 Massachusetts. I take as a point of de-
 parture the final comment of the Sen-
 ator from Massachusetts that, with af-
 fairs in Central America moving ad-
 versely, the amendment that he and
 Senator   HATFIELD  ' have   suggested
 ought to be adopted. I would argue
 June 6, 1985
 and have' argued earlier that in fact
 the trend of affairs in Central America
 has gone well for this country. It is a
 remarkable to consider the progress-
 found in El Salvador, when so many
 persons on the floor of this Senate
 and elsewhere argued that our involve-
 ment simply. would come to know
 good, that human rights would be vio-
 lated, that democracy was impossible,
 that we were in danger of involvement
 of American troops and forces. In fact
 a constituent election has been held, a
 President has been elected, and de-
 mocracy is infinitely stronger today.
 It can be argued, I suspect, with less
 force that democracy in Honduras and
 even the beginning of democratic insti-
 tutions in Guatemala, have proceeded
 and that the policies we have adopted
 as an administration and a Congress
 have helped. Others would argue that
 the people in El Salvador, Guatemala
 and Honduras have helped themselves;
 that perhaps the great heroes are per-
 sons in those countries who value free-
 dom and value democratic institutions.
 I respectfully would suggest that it
 is that this amendment-in the con-
 text of all that has happened and all
 that is being called for-should not
 simply  draw  out  of  context  the
 thought of, a demand that we proceed
 to the negotiating table in bilateral ne-
 gotiations with Nicaragua or that in a
 unilateral fashion we declare that this
 body must act before the President
 has the power to use American mili-
 tary forces in Nicaragua. Given all the
 exceptions. I would grant, that are
 part of the amendment, these are
 steps that are unwise in the unfolding
 of our foreign policy and the unfold-
 ing of any potential success of negotia-
 tions.
 Let. me point out that, in the earlier
 comments that I made with regard to
 Dodd amendment, I pointed out that
 negotiations and support of the demo-
 cratic forces in Nicaragua are not in-
 compatible. As a matter of fact, they
 move together. I would suggest that
 negotiations without support of the
 Contras, of the forces that are at-
 tempting  as  Nicaraguans  to  bring
 about  democracy  in that country,
 those negotiations are not likely to be
 very productive.
 The Senator from Colorado asked
 the Senator from Indiana about nego-
 tiations, their possibilities of success,
 and we went back and forth as to the
 probable results of those negotiations.
 None -of us know. But I would say
 that, in the Nunn-Lugar amendment
 we will be considering later on this
 afternoon, we encourage the President
 to enter into negotiations.
 I will state the exact language. We
 encourage simultaneous negotiations
 to implement the Contadora document
 objective, to develop close consultation
 and cooperation with other nations
 within the region and outside the
 region. We ask the President to pursue
 vigorously the use of diplomatic and
 economic measures to resolving the

 conflict, including simultaneous nego-
 tiations.
 In short, .I think we will find a larger
 majority of Members of this body are
 in favor of negotiations within con-
 text. But let us try to find the source
 of negotiations that must happen. I
 suppose we are all concerned with the
 peace process in the Middle East pres-
 ently, and thinking through how that
 might, move to a settlement. And I
 pick that particular analogy because, it
 is topical and it is useful. Negotiations
 are a complex business. To throw out
 a cliche, "Let peace have a chance, let
 negotiations have a chance," is mean-
 ingless without the context of why
 anybody wants to talk.
 To suggest unilaterally  that the
 President ought to get right to it, send
 the Secretary of State and others
 down-there to negotiate, without any
 reasonable assurance that there is
 anyone in Nicaragua that wants to ne-
 gotiate, that wants to move off the
 dime, is an exercise in futility. It is fat-
 uous on the face of it. There is a good'
 sound to it. None of us want war. Ev-
 erybody wants peace. The suggestion
 is go negotiate. Now negotiations occur
 successfully, at least as opposed to
 simply parties meeting without having
 a whole lot to say, if there is some
 reason for movement.
 The point the Senator from Indiana
 will make today is that, as the Senator
 from Massachusetts has described it so
 well, six meetings have occurred in
 Manzanillo without movement. The
 Secretary of State has testified public-
 ly and privately that the Sandinistas
 do not have the slightest reason to
 move in any direction and indeed they
 do not. To send the Secretary of State
 to Manzanillo again and to have done
 nothing to have assisted the freedom
 fighters to have put pressure upon
 that situation is not only to invite fu-
 tility in the negotiations but I think
 incredulity as to why we are involved
 in the action at all, aside from the
 cliched thoughts of giving peace a
 chance and' talk is better than war and
 what have you. ,
 The negotiations that must occur
 are  within  Nicaragua-Nicaraguans
 with Nicaraguans. For us to believe for
 an instant that the significant negotia-
 tions are bilateral ones between the
 United States and Nicaragua is to be-
 lieve the Nicaraguan argument which
 is an invalid one. The Sandinistas do
 not want to talk to freedom fighters.
 Marxists do not want to talk to people
 who want liberty. That is what it boils
 down to.
 Those  are  the  negotiations  we
 should be urging, if the Senator from
 Massachusetts and the Senator from
 Oregon were saying:
 Let's mandate that the Sandinistas meet
 with the freedom fighters. Let's mandate a
 truce and a cease-fire. Let's mandate that
 people stop shooting each other and that
 they provide for at least two parties for free
 elections, for freedom of the press, for some
 kind of a country that does not threaten ev-
 erybody around.
 The argument I have heard thus far
 from the Senator from Massachusetts
 would imply that the United States is
 the aggressor, that the Sandinistas are
 hapless persons upon whom we are
 preying, and the gist of the amend-
 ment is to ask us to cease and desist, to
 let these persons proceed with what-
 ever they want to do in consolidating
 Marxism in a totalitarian sense in
 their country, in threatening El Salva-
 dor, Honduras, or Costa Rica, without
 an army or anybody around, to pro-
 ceed if they wish to, for that matter,
 deal with-any and all countries of the
 world in terms of the buildup of mili-
 tary. assistance.  The Senator from
 Massachusetts says that in the event
 you see Migs there, Soviet Migs, might
 be a time to act, that might be an ex-
 ception. That would be a terrible time
 to have to act, having failed to put the
 pressure that ought to be placed upon
 that regime. now so there is not doubt
 on the part of the Soviet Union.
 If the whole gist of the Senate is to
 micromanage our foreign policy to in-
 dicate to the Secretary of State that
 regardless of his judgment as to how
 negotiations might prove successful or
 which ones might prove successful and
 in what context, that he is to go
 anyway, that is our mandate, that is
 not a very good way to handle foreign
 policy and, as a'matter of fact, in this
 case is bound to be unsuccessful.
 What the Senator from Indiana is'
 suggesting is that negotiations might
 be successful if, in fact, the Sandinista
 government has some reason and real-
 politik to want to talk. And I think
 they might have some reason.
 The reasons are basically that their
 economy is shot. The standard of
 living is,. declining very rapidly. Our
 Ambassador  to Nicaragua  testified
 before the Foreign Relations Commit-
 tee that what was already an $800 per
 capita income in Nicaragua-on an
 annual basis-has fallen to $500 in the
 last 2 years. That does not approach
 Bangladesh at this point but it is
 moving rapidly in that direction. The
 Sandinista economy has been a disas-
 trous failure. The Sandinista govern-
 ment says, well, we are at war. We are
 devoting our resources to fighting off
 the Contras, and indeed they need not
 fight off persons who were involved in
 their own revolution. The Marxists
 have no more claim to that revolution
 than does Arturo Cruz or various
 other persons who are in favor of de-
 mocracy and not of Marxism. There is
 every reason if we are to put pressure
 on this body for negotiations that we
 say loudly and clearly to the Sandinis-
 tas it is time for you to cease fire and
 talk to your own people to try to re-
 cover the pledges you made to all the
 neighbors around, the OAS, and to the
 rest of the world. Why we apologize
 for our activities which try to bring
 about  democracy  and  freedom  I
 cannot imagine. There is no reason to
 do so.
 Let me suggest that to unilaterally
 call upon the United States to negoti-
 ate out of the context of the Conta-
 dora process, of internal talks in Nica-
 ragua, is simply to ensure once again
 an impasse which leads I suspect to
 two courses of action, and neither is
 desirable. One was suggested by Sena-
 tor Donn this morning, and that is we
 just withdraw. The Senate has spoken
 on that 79 to 17. The other, of course,
 if you have futility of negotiations,
 then the Senator is correct. People
 then get onto more vigorous measures,
 and more difficult measures. That is
 not the policy of the President of the
 United States. The Senator of Massa-
 chusetts   characterized   President
 Reagan correctly in his statement that
 we do not want American forces in
 Nicaragua, and we do not want them
 'in Central America at all in a combat
 status. We do want to help people who
 want to help themselves. That is what
 we are about.
 Let me suggest with the second half
 of the  amendment,  namely,  that
 which suggests that the United States
 could not proceed  to  have    armed
 forces in that area without specific
 action of the Congress that the War
 Powers Act which the Senator from
 Massachusetts has cited does cover a
 number  of  possibilities.  The War
 Powers Act was adopted by the Con-
 gress because chief executives in a
 dangerous world sometimes must act
 rapidly for the security of all of us.
 Persons who are preoccupied with this
 question must still admit that the
 President must be our major foreign
 policy spokesman. This is an adminis-
 tration function, with the advise and
 consent  of  the  Senate.  The  War
 Powers Act tightened that up a good
 bit. It said notwithstanding any emer-
 gencies, any of the ways in which our
 President must act, within 60 days
 there has to be an accounting for this.
 If you have not declared war within 60
 days you will have to do so. There is
 some latitude given in a dangerous
 world to the President of the United
 States, and that is the way it ought to
 be.
 This amendment changes the War
 Powers Act rather significantly. As a
 matter of fact, it obliterates the War
 Powers Act and says before the Presi-
 dent in the case of Nicaragua can
 move there has to be affirmative activ-
 ity except with'the exceptions noted
 in the amendment. '
 I have noted the exceptions, and
 they are important ones. Among this
 list I would have thought would have
 been our obligations under the Rio
 Treaty of 1947-if for example, Nicara-
 gua attacks Costa Rica, or if Nicara-
 gua is involved with war with Hondu-
 ras. These are not far-fetched situa-
 tions. In recent days there is evidence
 that Nicaragua has in,fact been found
 attacking persons in neighboring coun-
 tries. The Sandinistas would claim it
 was in hot pursuit of Contras or for
 various other reasons. Be that as it
 may, the dangerous situation present-
 ed by an aggressive force, a revolution

 without borders, a, group of people
 who have never been able to settle
 down within their own territory but
 have  constantly  been  meddling in
 trying to subvert their neighbors and
 felt that was simply their own form of
 democracy in action-it seems to me
 that the Senator from Massachusetts
 would need to contemplate other ac-
 tivities in which clearly the have an ob-
 ligation and the Rio Treaty would be
 one of these.
 But I suggest beyond that, to begin
 once again micromanaging American
 foreign policy before the U.S. Senate,
 there could be no movement in what is
 a vital security interest of the United
 States as perceived by the President,
 or by the Contadora group, or the
 OAS, or any number of people that
 might meet. It is not a good idea. The
 surface  appeal-the  thought  that
 giving peace a chance, negotiate now,
 no troops in Nicaragua, the cliches of
 this amendment are all over it-is evi-
 dent. But in terms of sound foreign
 policy, it is simply lifted out of the
 context of what is occurring, and
 stands history, in Central America on
 its head.
 The malfactors in this case are a
 group of Marxists who have seized a
 revolution from persons who believe in
 freedom. That is fundamental, and
 that is where the negotiation ought to
 be occurring. To try to turn this on its
 head, see the United States as the mal-
 factor, to be encouraging from the
 floor of the Senate at a time that the
 Sandinistas are involved in what they
 are doing that we ought to rush to the
 table, and that we ought to tie the
 hands of the President is simply in my
 judgment unsound policy. And I hope
 the Senate will reject both parts of
 the amendment.
 Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Massachusetts.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I
 welcome the view of the chairman of
 the Foreign Relations Committee. I
 have a great deal of respect for his un-
 derstanding of world history, for his
 knowledge of the Constitution of the
 United States, but also for our respon-
 sibilities to stand up to our constitu-
 tional responsibilities.
 But, Mr. President, I read the Con-
 stitution of the United States some-
 what differently from the chairman of
 the Foreign Relations Committee. I
 read the Constitution of the United
 States to say that the power to make
 war resides in the people's elected offi-
 cials in the Congress, in the House and
 in the Senate of the. United States. I
 only suggest to the chairman of the
 Foreign Relations Committee that the
 American people ought to have a
 voice, ought to be able to express their
 views before sending their sons to the
 jungles of Central America, and that
 this should not be a unilateral decision
 made by the President of the United
 States. I think the American people
 ought to be able to have a voice, ought
 to be able to express their views in the.
 June 6, 1985
 Congress of the United:States. And, I am sure the chairman of the Foreign
 cannot believe that the chairman of  Relations Committee had briefings as
 the Foreign Relations Committee is   welt.
 willing to give all of that authority to But I can give the assurance to the
 the President, to allow him without  Members of this body that Manzanillo
 consulting Congress to send the sons talks were not as empty and valueless
 from his own State of Indiana to fight as the Senator from Indiana has sug-
 in the jungles of Nicaragua. I want to                                                  gested.
 make it very clear that this Senator
 from Massachusetts is not prepared to
 give up that authority and that re-
 sponsibility to this President of the
 United States nor to any President of
 the United States.
 I failed to speak on the same issue
 some years ago on the Gulf of Tonkin
 resolution, and I am not going to
 commit that mistake twice, Mr. Presi-
 dent. We heard almost similar argu-
 ments on the floor of the Senate at
 the time of the Gulf of Tonkin resolu-
 tion-such as "Let the President of the
 United States decide these matters."
 "How are we going to have the kind of
 information  in the Senate of the
 United States that the President will
 have?" "Let the President make those
 decisions; he is going to have the
 knowledge, the information, and he is
 going to have the briefings from the
 NSC and the Joint Chiefs of Staff."
 But Congress made a mistake when
 it accepted those arguments. Fifty-five
 thousand  deaths  and  hundreds  of
 thousands of wounded Americans paid
 a fearsome price for the failure of the
 Senate to, as you call it, "microman-
 age" that particular incident.
 Mr. President, this amendment is
 not about all of Central America. This
 amendment is targeted on Nicaragua.
 We have had a whole series of events
 during the last 3  years-many  of
 which this body has authorized-with
 regard to Nicaragua-not Costa Rica,
 not Honduras, not Guatemala, but
 with regard to Nicaragua.
 We have heard statements, including
 statements  from  the  Secretary  of
 State, talking about the possibility of
 the introduction of American troops in
 Nicaragua-not in Costa Rica, not in
 Mexico, but in Nicaragua.
 So  this    amendment.  is  directed
 toward  Nicaragua.  That   certainly
 ought to be understood on its face.
 We see that people are dying in
 Nicaragua, and we see increasing in-
 volvement, increasing American par-
 ticipation in that conflict. I hold no
 brief for the Sandinista government. I
 recognize that the Sandinistas share
 responsibility for the ' conflict within
 the area and within the region.
 But the question comes back once
 more. Mr. President: Before we resort
 to the use of force, before we send
 American  military  combat  troops,
 should we not at least make one addi-
 The Senator from Indiana has in-
 cluded in his own resolution a section
 urging the President to go back for
 further negotiation with the Sandinis-
 tas and wisely so. I gather that the
 principal difference he makes between
 his urging and our urging .involves the
 other  different  provisions  of  his
 amendment.
 But    whatever   the  circumstances,
 whatever the framework, I hope the
 Secretary of State will resume those
 negotiations. We have a President of
 the United States who says he is pre-
 pared to meet with Gorbachev. Per-
 haps Senator LUGAR can tell us what
 greater sense of hope he has about
 that conversation, based upon our
 President's statements about Gorba-
 chev  and  Gorbachev's  statements
 about the President of the United
 States, as opposed to his lack of hope
 about talking with the Sandinistas.
 We have had negotiations with all
 the Eastern European countries on
 MBFR. We have also had negotiations
 with Fidel Castro about Cuban fami-
 lies in the United States and the re-
 entry of certain Cubans back to Cuba
 following the Mariel boatlift. Why not
 talk to the Sandinistas?
 We have people dying in Nicaragua
 every day, and there. is a real danger
 of American involvement in the .form
 of American combat troops in the
 future-not according to this Senator
 from Massachusetts but according to
 this  administration's  Secretary  of
 State.
 So there is a sense of urgency, Mr.
 President, that propels some' of us in
 this body to offer what constructive
 suggestions we might have to try and
 see if additional steps can be taken to
 make sure that if direct U.S. involve-
 ment is to occur, Congress will be con-
 sulted.
 Mr. President, I would hope that the
 Senators will be able to support this
 amendment. It simply urges a resump-
 tion of talks-that is not microman-
 agement-and it makes it possbile for
 Congress to speak and to vote before
 we send our sons to the jungles of
 Nicaragua, and I do not believe that is
 micromanagement.
 I would hope this amendment will be
 agreed to.

 read from the Constitution the powers'
 of Congress.
 We have the power to declare war.
 What does that mean? Just what it
 says. The President has called the
 troops out, I think, 202 times in the
 history of our country and there have
 been five declarations of war, two of
 those in the same war. We could de-
 clare war here all day long. But only
 the President of the United States,
 under his power as Commander in
 Chief, can send troops into war. If we
 want to declare war, then, it is a nice
 .thing to do and one that the Presi-
 dent, I think, would always, enjoy
 having done.
 We can grant Letters of Marque and
 Reprisals and make rules concerning
 captures on land and water.
 We raise and support armies but no
 appropriation of money to that use
 shall be for a longer* term than 2
 years.
 To provide and maintain a navy.
 Here is one we have sadly overlooked
 our responsibilities in: It has been
 since 1922 since we exercised this
 power, to make rules for the govern-
 ment and regulation of the land and
 naval forces.
 I can promise my colleagues that the
 Committee on Armed Services is work-
 ing on that right now.
 Now let us look very quickly at the
 power of the President. I have to
 admit that this has never been really
 clearly defined in the Constitution.
 The Supreme Court has always re-
 fused to make a determination of this
 because, as they rightly say, in my
 opinion, if we have a situation where
 the executive branch and the legisla-
 tive branch can make a decision, there
 is no need for the Court to get into it.
 Section 2:
 The President shall be Commander in
 Chief of the Army and Navy of the United
 States, and of the militia of the several
 States, when called into the actual service
 of the United States. He may require the
 opinion ...
 And so forth and so on.
 But only the President, Mr. Presi-
 dent, can send our troops to war. If it
 is the feeling of Members of this body,
 in the Senate or in the House, that
 only the Congress should have that
 power, then I suggest, Mr. President,
 that  we  prepare  a  constitutional
 amendment and put it up to a vote of
 the people. I do not think the Ameri-
 can people want 535 people guided by
 535  different  sources  of  strength
 making  the        decisions concerning
 power in  this country. The great
 strength of this country, up until
 recent times, has been the fact that
 the President has the right to formu-
 late foreign policy, with the advice and
 consent of this body, and has the
 power of the troops to back that up.
 I think we are treading on very dan-
 gerous ground when we keep bringing
 up amendments and talking about the
 power of this body or the other body
 to send troops into war. There is no
 constitutional authority for it at all.
 I thank my friend from Indiana for
 yielding.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish
 to yield time to the Senator from Min-
 nesota. How much time does the Sena-
 tor want?
 Mr. DURENBERGER. I shall take
 only 30 seconds.
 Mr. LUGAR. I yield 1 minute.
 Mr. DURENBERGER. I thank the
 Senator from Indiana.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator may proceed.
 . Mr. DURENBERGER.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, I rise in opposition to the amend-
 ment of the Senator from Massachu-
 setts.
 I do so because it is my belief that
 the amendment begs the issue of the
 real and present danger that the San-
 dinista regime poses to its Central
 American neighbors, not to the United
 States. No one would reasonably claim
 that the United States is in immediate
 danger of a Sandinista invasion from
 the south. Yet, this amendment de-
 mands an immediate response on' our
 part to any hostile attack upon the
 United States, its Embassy in Mana-
 gua, or its citizens in Nicaragua.
 Simply stated, I do not feel that this
 amendment addresses the real ques-
 tion. The threat of the Sandinista
 regime to the United States is not the
 immediate security problem involved
 here. Rather, the issue is whether the
 emerging  democracies  in  Central
 America are immediately threatened
 by the aggressive and hostile actions
 of the Sandinistas. I would respond
 strongly in the affirmative.
 In the past week, we have seen at
 least three clear indications of the
 Sandinistas' plans for their neighbors.
 During this time, the Sandinistas have
 launched cross-border incursions using
 substantial forces against their neigh-
 bors, the Costa Ricans and the Hon-
 durans. Yet, the Sandinistas immedi-
 ately. rushed before the international
 media to claim that they, amazingly
 enough, were the aggrieved party.
 Their obvious hope is that few people
 outside Nicaragua will care to look
 into the facts of these examples of
 Sandinista aggression.
 By shifting the focus of the Sandi-
 nista threat away from the Central
 American nations and onto the United
 States, Senator KENNEDY has missed
 the real issue. This debate should in-
 stead be one which states this coun-
 try's willingness to do whatever is nec-
 essary to restore democracy to Nicara-
 gua and to recapture the democratic
 spirit and the broad popular support
 which characterized the 1979 Nicara-
 guan revolution. I believe that Senator
 LUGAR has made a critical point-the
 Sandinistas will negotiate only when
 they believe that it is to their advan-
 tage or when sufficient pressure has
 been exerted upon them. Last week,
 during my visit to Central America,
 this point was hammered home to me
 by nearly all of the Central Americans
 with whom I met. Conservatives, liber-
 als, socialists, businessmen, religious,
 S 7609
 and campesinos all stressed that only
 the United States possessed the suffi-
 cient capability to bring the Sandinis-
 tas to the negotiating table with the
 Nicaraguan  democratic  opposition.
 Not the, Sandinistas' neighbors. Not
 the Contadora group. Not the Organi-
 zation of American States.
 Clearly the only effective negotia-
 tions will be those which consider all
 of the factions currently embroiled in
 the Nicaraguan civil war. Still, the
 Sandinistas have steadfastly refused
 to negotiate in good faith with any ele-
 ment of the opposition. Just last week,
 for example, the Sandinistas inexplica-
 bly broke off negotiations with Brook-'
 lyn Rivera's Misurasata group. This
 week, the Sandinistas showed their
 complete disinterest in a democratic
 and peaceful resolution of the conflict
 with the Miskito peoples by turning
 their guns on Rivera's Miskito war-
 riors.
 How can we let the Nicaraguan
 democratic  opposition  stand  alone
 when we know that the Sandinistas
 will negotiate only in bad faith? We
 have seen this demonstrated at the bi-
 lateral Manzanillo talks and at the
 multilateral Contadora negotiations.
 In my view, talks are useful when the
 negotiating parties are serious about
 negotiations. I have seen no firm evi-
 dence that the Sandinistas have acted
 with any seriousness in any of these
 processes. I therfore see no reason
 why we should enter into bilateral ne-
 gotiations with a regime which has no
 intention of negotiating with the real
 aggrieved party in this dispute, the
 Nicaraguan people.
 The Senator  from Massachusetts
 talked about sending our sons to Nica-
 ragua. Three Members of the body
 have sons graduating from high school
 in 15 minutes. I am more than a little
 upset, I suppose, as one who has spent
 more time, or at least as much time as
 anybody in the body, dealing with this
 issue at the fact that a lot of rhetoric
 ,kept us from dealing with this issue
 .yesterday. Now, somehow, this process
 has chosen this particular moment in
 my life to make me make a decision
 about being with my son or being with
 an issue I care a lot about. I intend to
 take the option of being with my son.
 I hope that, somewhere in this insti-
 tutional process, someone would have
 the consideration to postpone any fur-
 ther votes on this amendment until
 after approximately 4 o'clock.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who
 yields time?
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I believe
 it would be appropriate to move to the
 vote for a number of reasons. I shall
 yield back all the time on my side
 unless others are prepared to debate. I
 think the issues have been well stated.
 I say this in conclusion: Obviously.
 the Senator from Indiana does not
 want to send young men from Indiana
 or Massachusetts or Minnesota to war.
 As a matter of fact, the whole process
 tocay is one in which we try to divine

 S 7610                   CONGRESSIONAL, RECORD - SENATE
 how to make certain we will have
 peace in our hemisphere and safety
 for our people. I think that is clear.
 The question is the matter of the con-
 text and the tactics of how negotia-
 tions, might work and what the proper
 powers of the President and the Con-
 gress are.
 I think we have had a good debate. I
 hope that both parts of the amend-
 ment will be defeated.
 I yield back all the time on our side.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if
 the Senator would withhold on that, I
 want to yield 3 minutes to the Senator
 from Colorado [Mr. HART].
 At this point I wish to . indicate to
 the Senator from Minnesota that con-
 trol over the timing of this measure
 today was not in the hands of those of
 us who are calling up this amendment.
 I am happy to give the Senator from
 Minnesota a live pair on this amend-
 ment if he wants to be with his son
 this afternoon.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, does the
 Senator from Massachusetts have time
 remaining?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Massachusetts has 4
 minutes and 30 seconds remaining.
 Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from
 Massachusetts yields to the. Senator
 from Colorado.
 Mr. HART. I shall not even take
 that time if the Senator from Minne-
 sota is trying to vote and go some
 place else. Is that the case?
 Mr.  DURENBERGER.  Yes,  Mr.
 President.
 Mr. President, I yield back my time.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER. All
 time has been yielded back. The ques-
 tion is on agreeing to division 1 of the
 amendment of the Senator from Mas-
 sachusetts. The yeas and nays have
 been ordered. The clerk will call the
 roll.
 The bill clerk called the roll.
 Mr. SIMPSON. I announce that the
 Senator from  Colorado  [Mr.  ARM-
 STRONG], the Senator from Alabama
 [Mr. DENTON], and the Senator from
 Wyoming [Mr. WALLOP], are necessari-
 ly absent.
 I also' announce that the Senator
 from North Carolina [Mr. EAST], is
 absent due to illness.,
 I further announce that, if present
 and voting the Senator from Alabama
 [Mr. DENTON], and the Senator from
 Wyoming [Mr. WALLOP], would each
 vote nay.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
 GORTON). Are there any other Sena-,
 tors in the Chamber desiring to vote?

 (A) the Congress has authorized the p-

 (2) In either case described in clause (B)
 of paragraph  (1),  the  President should
 advise and, to the extent possible, consult in

 Mr. HART. Mr. President, Senator
 KERRY  and    I  are     introducing  an
 amendment which will increase con-
 gressional oversight over the introduc-
 tion-of U.S. combat forces in Central
 America.
 The amendment would require con-
 ? gressional approval-in the form of a
 joint resolution-prior to the introduc-
 tion of American combat troops in
 Central America for training exercises
 or other purposes. It would, however,
 allow  the  President  to  introduce
 troops immediately in the event that
 the United States was threatened with
 attack or American lives were in jeop-
 ardy. Our amendment is intended as a
 crisis-prevention measure  to  place
 limits on the increasing numbers of
 U.S. forces on maneuver and to reduce
 the likelihood that those troops will
 become entangled in a conflict in Cen-
 tral America.
 Mr.  President,  since  the  United
 States increased the scope and intensi-
 ty of military maneuvers in Honduras
 in 1983, we have witnessed the nearly
 constant presence of American combat
 troops on the border of Nicaragua. At
 the end of April, that presence num-
 bered nearly 11,000.
 During these latest maneuvers U.S.
 tanks  and  heavy  equipment  came
 within 3 miles of the Nicaraguan
 border.
 There is little to suggest that such
 displays . of  might  have advanced
 American foreign policy objectives in
 the region since they began on an ex-
 panded basis in 1983. But the contin-
 ued presence of these large numbers
 of U.S. troops in close proximity to on-
 going fighting between the Contras
 and the Sandinistas is a case where a
 display of American military power for
 symbolic purposes is tangibly increas-
 ing the prospects that the United
 States will become directly involved in
 hostilities.
 All too often in the past we have
 seen nations start down the path to
 war on the basis of miscalculations,
 unintentional clashes, and unforeseen
 crisis. Promoting the continued pres-
 ence of thousands of American troops
 so close to forces that are fighting in
 earnest-so close to a nation with
 which we have such severe disagree-
 ments-is like placing a match in a tin-
 derbox.                         -
 This amendment would not have the
 effect of banning troop maneuvers,
 nor would it interfere with U.S. intelli-
 gence gathering capabilities nor pre-
 vent U.S. military advisers from aiding
 friendly nations in the region. We are
 not suggesting that the United States
 should not conduct any training exer-
 cises in Central America.
 This  amendment  would  simply
 ensure that Congress subjected plans
 for the introduction of troops into
 Central America to careful and delib-
 erate review, to ensure. that such ac-
 tions are dictated by U.S. security re-
 quirements, are commensurate with
 the need to train allied forces in the
 region, and are not a form of danger-
 ous gun boat diplomacy carried out on
 land.
 Mr. President, our amendment is es-
 pecially important now, in light of the
 Reagan administration's decision to
 impose an economic embargo on the
 Sandinistas and the increasing likeli-
 hood that this Congress will provide
 some sort of aid to the anti-Sandinista
 Contra forces through third parties or
 other indirect means.
 I oppose these policies. But regard-
 less of where one stands on the embar-
 go or Contra aid-it is clear that to-
 gether they reflect an escalation in
 tensions between the United States
 and the Sandinistas; tensions which
 are already running extremely high.
 Now is the time to mandate a thor-
 ough congressional debate prior to ad-
 ditional massive introduction of U.S.
 troops in the region-not after events
 have gotten out of hand, and our only
 option is to become embroiled in con-
 flict.
 Our proposal will not in any way
 limit the President's prerogative to
 protect American lives or respond to
 the threat of attack. We are not at-
 tempting to interfere with the author-
 ity of the Executive. Rather with this"
 amendment we have attempted to
 strike a reasonable balance between
 the President's need for flexibility in
 conducting foreign affairs and the
 Congress' responsibility for passing
 upon policies that could lead this
 Nation into war.
 Mr. President, the purpose of this
 amendment is somewhat similar to the
 previous amendment proposed by the
 Senator from. Massachusetts, but it is
 also somewhat different. Its differ-
 ences are these: The purpose of my
 amendment is to proscribe the level of
 S 7611.
 combat forces the United States may
 introduce into the region of Central
 America, as defined by specific terms,
 to those listed countries-unless the
 President of the United States has re-
 ceived prior congressional authority.
 The purpose of this amendment, Mr.
 President, and the reason for bringing
 it forward on this bill are quite obvi-
 ous.  There  is  deepening  concern
 among the people  of  the United
 States, in this Chamber and through-
 out the Congress about whether the
 administration may be planning for or
 intent upon some sort of military
 action against Nicaragua. That con-
 cern has. been deepened by published
 reports and quotations of anonymous
 administration officials and sources in
 the Defense Department, 'the State
 Department, and the White House
 that suggest that those plans have
 indeed been made, and that there is a
 body of thought within the adminis-
 tration which strongly advises that we
 be prepared on fairly short notice to
 undertake that kind of military oper-
 ation.
 Mr. President, I will not take the
 time of the Senate to parade the po-
 tential loss of American lives posed by
 American involvement in a Central
 American conflict; or to suggest to
 each Member of the Senate what this
 might mean to their own families or to
 the constituents they represent. I will
 not take the Senate's time to analyze
 and compare this potential to that of
 our recent and tragic experience in
 Southeast Asia. There are differences.
 I realize those differences of geogra-
 phy, differences of American interests,
 and all the rest. I do not by this
 amendment, Mr. President., intend to
 draw a one-to-one analogy between
 the sad experience we had in Vietnam,
 and the potential for an even sadder
 experience in Central America.
 Suffice it to say, Mr. President, it is
 the conclusion of the Senator from
 Colorado-and I think reflective of the
 view of a large majority of the Ameri-
 can people-that to seek to solve the
 thorney and complex problems of Cen-
 tral America, and our relations with
 Nicaragua through an invasion force
 or through direct military interven-
 tion                                                                                             by  the. United States-absent
 some more immediate threat to our
 own security and our own vital inter-
 ests-would be an act of folly of the
 deepest dimension.
 I, as the Senator from Colorado,
 have no particular inside information
 about what the administration may
 plan or may intend, or what have
 those who favor some greater military
 presence may have over the thinking
 of the President of the United States
 or of this administration. But I do
 know, Mr. President, that all of the in-
 gredients are there for that act of
 folly-a willingness on the part of
 some 'of the key policymakers in our
 Government and a willingness on the
 part of some military officials, to re-
 solve an increasingly complex problem

 S 7612                   CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 for U.S. diplomacy by a swift and
 hopefully decisive military action.
 I think any of us who have studied
 the situation in Central America for
 even one moment, or who have read.
 even  10 pages of military history,
 know that action would not be swift,
 and it is far from certain that it would
 be decisive. In this respect, I think
 there is a certain question whether
 people have learned any lessons in
 Vietnam  or not.  Nevertheless, Mr.
 President, I think any person with
 commonsense  and  reasonable  judg-
 ment would have to quarrel with the
 unnamed' official in  the  Pentagon
 quoted in the New York Times article
 saying that we could occupy Nicaragua
 and it would be as easy "as falling off
 a log."
 Mr. President, we are all reluctant to
 personalize these judgments and these
 decisions. The Senator from Colorado
 just happens to be the father of a 19-
 year-old son, presumably a son who
 would be subject to any involvement
 this country might undertake in the
 short or long term in Central America
 or elsewhere. It is the belief of the
 Senator from Colorado that his son,
 being as patriotic as any other young
 American, would be more than willing
 to engage himself in the defense of
 this country and its vital interests
 whenever called' upon by his Govern-
 ment in any kind of legitimate cause. I
 think the issue before this Chamber
 today is whether a military invasion of
 Nicaragua is a justifiable cause, calling
 upon the potential loss of many 19-
 year-olds similar to this Senator's son.
 Mr. President, it has been discussed
 here today, and in the highest tradi-
 tions of the debates of the U.S. Senate
 throughout . history-to debate who
 does or should have the authority to
 commit this Nation to acts of war or
 military enterprises. It was suggested
 earlier in a previous debate, a previous
 amendment ? by the senior Senator
 from Arizona (Mr.  GOLDWATER]  that
 the Congress has gone too far in
 making foreign policy or involving
 itself in fundamental decisions about
 deployment  of  American   military
 forces; that what we ought to. do is
 just give the President whatever au-
 thority he needs and trust his judg-
 ment to do whatever he thinks is best
 for this Nation. If any of us are stu-
 dents of American history, and try to
 sort our way through the history of
 ideology in this country, we find argu-
 ments of that sort ironic.
 For, after all, it was the more con-
 servative  elements  of  those  who
 founded this country, our Founding
 Fathers, who insisted-who insisted-
 that          the Congress of the United
 States, and particularly the Senate of
 the United States, have considerable
 authority in issues relating to foreign
 aid ventures by this Nation, interna-
 tional relations, or relationships with
 other countries.
 It was the concern on the part of
 those conservatives, those conservative
 Founding Fathers, that an all-power-
 ful Executive might in fact abuse that
 power and unnecessarily involve this
 Nation in unwise activities and adven-
 tures abroad, military, diplomatic, and
 otherwise.
 Let me, for example, if I may, Mr.
 President, cite Thomas Jefferson on
 the question of congressional involve-
 ment with respect to declaring and
 waging war, or being involved in mili-
 tary ventures abroad.
 In a letter in 1807 to then-Vice Presi-
 dent Clinton, Mr. Jefferson had this to
 say:
 The power of declaring war being with the
 legislature, the executive should do nothing
 necessarily committing them to declare war.
 In -other words, President Jefferson
 in 1807 was saying that the Congress
 should not permit itself to get into the
 position where Presidents can so pre-
 commit this Nation, so expose its in-
 terests ' unnecessarily, that the Con-
 gress then has no other choice but to
 intervene to carry out that commit-
 ment.
 Thomas  Jefferson  is  saying  the
 President should not have that power
 because the power of declaring war is
 with the legislature.
 He said earlier to James Madison in
 1793:
 As the executive cannot decide the ques-
 tion of war on the affirmative side-
 Let me repeat that.
 As the executive cannot-
 He does not say "should not"-
 cannot decide the question of war on the af-
 firmative side, neither can he do so on the
 negative side by preventing the competent
 body from deliberating on the question.
 Once again, anticipating his state-
 ment to Vice President Clinton some
 14 years later, he is saying that it is ac-
 cepted doctrine,  constitutional doc-
 trine, that the Executive cannot-he is
 not saying should not, but cannot-
 commit this Nation to war on the af-
 firmative side by an affirmative decla-
 ration. Therefore, logically the execu-
 tive should not have the power to pre-
 vent the Congress, which he calls "the
 competent body," from deliberating on
 that question.
 The President cannot, by any nega-
 tive means,  preclude the Congress
 from exercising its constitutional man-
 date to determine when this Nation
 goes to war.
 Then finally,  in an 'even earlier
 letter to Madison, Jefferson said:
 We have already given one effective check
 to the.dog of war by transferring the power
 to declare war from the executive to the leg-
 islative body; from those who are to spend
 to those who are to pay.
 The "we" he is' referring to is not
 only himself and Mr. Madison but the
 other framers of the  Constitution
 who, in their wisdom, were concerned
 about a too powerful Executive,. par-
 ticularly in the area of committing
 this Nation to war. He says:
 We have taken that power away. We have
 already given one effective check to the dog
 of war by .transferring the power to declare
 war from the executive to the legislative
 body.
 June 6, 1985
 Namely,  those  who can  spend
 money, the President, to those who
 pay the bills, the Congress.
 Finally, Mr. President, on this same
 subject, in the question of constitu-
 tional sharing of power in foreign
 policy, Alexander Hamilton himself,
 known throughout history as a propo-
 nent of the strong executive theory,
 wrote this in the Federalist Papers on
 this subject:
 The history of human conduct does not
 warrant that exalted opinion of human
 virtue which would make it wise for the
 nation to commit interests of so delicate and
 momentous a kind as those which concern
 its intercourse with the rest of the world to
 the sole disposal of a magistrate, created in
 circumstance as would be a President of the
 United States.
 Mr. President, I do not think it is
 the inclination of the Senate, for
 better or worse at the present time, to
 debate the history of who, under our
 Constitution, does or does not have, or
 should or should not have, the power
 to commit this Nation to war. I wish it
 were, because I think, Mr. President, if
 I read what is happening in this coun-
 try-in its highest circles of power-
 that is exactly the kind of debate we
 ought to be having on the floor of the
 Senate today, and there ought to be a
 goodly number of Senators here.
 It is tragic, it is unfortunate, that
 crises occur, that decisions are made,
 and then the hue and cry arises and
 elected officials summon themselves to
 the respective. Chambers of the Con-
 gress and start debating about how we
 got into this mess.
 Better, it seems to me, if we were to
 spend a tenth of the time today debat-
 ing about who should or should not
 have the power to commit this Nation
 to war. That is what this amendment
 is all about.
 Mr. President, it is the purpose of
 this  amendment  to  limit  to  the
 present levels in Central America ex-
 isting numbers of combat forces, and
 those are considerable. There are at
 least 2,000 forces, as the Senator from
 Colorado understands it, in Honduras,
 and other military personnel, depend-
 ing on how one counts the occasional
 naval and maritime presence of the
 United States in the region-possibly
 several thousand more.
 One can ask, what is the concern?
 Why offer this' amendment at all?
 What are the potentials?
 The potentials, Mr. President, are
 for  ever-increasing  and  escalating
 American military presence in the
 region, particularly in Honduras, and
 that presence getting itself closer and
 closer to what is a less and less defined
 combat zone and, therefore, exposing
 American military personnel to poten-
 tial ' harm; certainly putting them in
 harm's way, and therefore necessarily
 risking their lives.
 It seems to me we are only really the
 beneficiaries of fortune that more
 Americans  have  not  already  been

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.- SENATE
 sonnel, largely in exercises and acci-
 dents. But, it seems to me, given the
 deployment of American forces, it is
 almost miraculous that more Ameri-
 cans have not been killed in or near
 what has been an expanding combat
 zone.
 We have been through three so-
 called Big Pine exercises, each one of
 which has been larger than the last.
 Big Pine is not a classified code name
 but a military code name for combat
 exercises conducted by this Nation
 with Honduran and regional military
 forces. That is not in and of itself any-
 thing we should necessarily concern
 ourselves about, were it not for the in-
 dications that, as the Senator from
 Colorado has already mentioned, there
 are predisposition on the part of some
 policymakers in and out of uniform to
 preemptorily try to solve this problem
 by increased direct military action.
 The chances of that policy prevail-
 ing are exacerbated and heightened by
 the increasing possibility of Americans
 losing their lives in or near that
 combat zone, and then some tit for tat
 reaction being taken in which we raid
 across the border to protect our forces
 and they kill more Americans and
 then, before you know it, we are in the
 soup.
 The Big Pine 3 maneuvers have
 ended, as has a companion exercise
 called Universal Trek '85. Big Pine 3
 involved over 4,500 American forces.
 Universal  '85  Trek  involved  6,600
 United States troops, including am-
 phibious landings. These two exer-
 cises, by the way, overlapped by a
 period of a week or two, and during
 that period, by the calculation of the
 Senator from Colorado, there were
 over 11,000 combat forces in Honduras
 or nearby.
 . Mr. President, the disposition of the
 administration in this regard or in the
 near- or long-term future is beyond
 the Senator from Colorado-even in
 his capacity as a member of the
 Armed Services Committee. We are
 not necessarily brought into those
 plans. The Senator from Colorado is
 informed that later this month, a new
 U.S. maneuver involving potentially a
 couple thousand or more Americans
 who  might  be  involved  in  rather
 benign activities such as road-building,
 but also perhaps within 40 miles of the
 Nicaraguan border, practicing attacks
 and repelling attacks by and against
 guerrilla forces.
 So, Mr. President, the beat goes on.
 It is clearly an instrument of this ad-
 ministration's foreign policy in the
 region to not only beef up Honduran
 capabilities but to show a big stick to
 the  Nicaraguan  Government. That
 may or may not be a productive policy.
 All this amendment does is say: If
 the President of the United States in-
 tends to put more combat forces into
 the  region-Honduras  or  the  sur-
 rounding  nations-then  he                        should
 come to Congress and seek your ap-
 proval. Congress, under this amend-
 ment, can authorize that presence of
 .
 whatever units the President wants to
 commit in advance, by a joint resolu-
 tion enacted into law. The amendment
 does not  require  the  removal  of
 present levels of combat forces, so that
 argument cannot and should not be
 used in opposition. It specifically is de-
 signed not to interfere with the Presi-
 dent's ability either to take whatever
 actions are necessary to immediately
 evacuate U.S. citizens in Nicaragua or
 surrounding nations, or to respond to
 a clear and present danger of military
 attack on the United States.
 The amendment does encourage the
 President, under those circumstances,
 to consult closely with Congress.
 So, Mr. President, this amendment is
 not designed to intefere with our intel-
 ligence capabilities or the presence of
 our advisers in the region. It would not
 in any way impede our ability to pro-
 tect and promote our own interests in
 the region. It merely would bring Con-
 gress into the process of, deciding
 whether we should increase  merican
 military presence in the region and,
 hopefully, if it works properly and is
 enacted, prevent any kind of unilateral
 action by the President of the United
 States which might precommit this
 Nation to war in opposition to the
 intent of -the Founding Fathers and
 the clear intent of the Constitution of
 the United States.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who
 yields time?
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield
 to myself such time as I may require.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Indiana is recognized.
 Mr.  LUGAR.  Mr.  President,  the
 amendment presented by our distin-
 guished Senator from Colorado, as he
 has mentioned, has many characteris-
 tics which are similar to the amend-
 ment just offered by the distinguished
 Senators  from  Massachusetts  [Mr.
 KENNEDY] and Oregon [Mr. HATFIELD],
 except for the fact that the Hart
 amendment goes beyond the Kennedy-
 Hatfield - amendment, beyond' in the
 sense that in addition to the introduc-
 tion of forces into combat, the Hart
 amendment  would  preclude  forces
 coming into additional exercises with-
 out the advance consent of Congress.
 I submit, Mr. President, that Mem-
 bers who have already voted, by 31 to
 64,  against the  first amendment,
 would be disinclined to vote for the
 current amendment because it clearly
 goes well beyond it with, regard to the
 scope of congressional management of
 military policy and the use of force.
 The Senator from Colorado has sug-
 gested that the. very presence of a crit-
 ical mass of forces in Honduras may
 lead Americans into some measure of
 jeopardy. Indeed, he has suggested
 that it is miraculous that more inju-
 ries or deaths have not occurred, given
 the number of persons in Honduras.
 But I think it is important to indicate
 that, in fact, these deaths have not oc-
 curred nor have combat situations oc-
 curred.
 57613
 In truth, our forces are in Honduras
 because they are training for fitness in
 military capability. They are assisting
 our friends in Honduras who are heav-
 ily reliant upon the support they give.
 I suggest, Mr. President, that the
 War Powers Act, which at least per-
 tained to the previous amendment we
 discussed, conceivably pertains to this
 one, although I understand that the
 thrust of the Hart amendment is to
 give an additional dimension to that.
 It seems to me that this type of
 amendment would clearly be a signal
 of weakened U.S. commitment to Hon-
 duras and other Central American
 friends. It would encourage, in my
 judgment, if not intensified military
 pressure by Nicaragua, certainly a
 temptation to attempt those activities
 which Nicaragua might  feel  disin-
 clined to attempt given the exercises
 proceeding in Honduras.
 It seems to me it is indeed another
 unwise and rather severe restriction
 upon the President's constitutional au-
 thority as Commander in Chief. It ap-
 pears to me that it would at least.pre-
 clude the possibility of the use of U.S..
 forces in providing emergency assist-
 ance to friendly countries to defend
 against sudden attack which currently
 we are in a position to give, given the
 sure presence of our forces in Hondu-
 ras or, as might be the case, exercises
 in other areas.
 For these reasons, Mr. President, I
 ask the Senate to reject the Hart
 amendment. It seems to me it would
 be an unwise deviation in our foreign
 policy. Clearly, it will not be helpful,
 in my judgment, in providing for the
 stability in Central America which we
 all seek.
 We have not attempted today, and
 will not go far afield, in treating the
 positive things that the United States
 has attempted to do in promoting
 strong  democratic  institutions,  a
 stronger economy, stronger humani-
 tarian aid. Clearly, our presence in
 Central America in a military capacity
 and the close ties that the military ex- .
 ercises give help to our friends in Cen-
 tral America. It seems to me this is an
 area in which a degree of Presidential
 discretion and congressional oversight
 are important. I would think the con-
 gressional oversight is exercised in a
 number of ways presently and to go so
 far as the Senator from Colorado has
 suggested would be unwise.
 Mr. HART. Mr. President, I yield 10
 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Illinois is recognized.
 Mr. SIMON. I thank the Chair and I
 thank Senator HART for the time.
 Mr. President, I rise in support of
 the Hart amendment. I do so because I
 have the uneasy feeling-more than
 just an uneasy feeling, a belief-that
 we are moving in the wrong direction.
 As I read the Hart amendment, it is a
 balanced amendment.  It  recognizes
 that the Government of Nicaragua
 has not lived up to some of its commit-

 ments, but it also places priority on
 diplomatic initiatives, without taking
 away the power of the President in a
 genuine emergency. But. it sends a
 clear signal, "Do not use U.S. troops
 unnecessarily."
 My own feeling is that many of the
 people who are making decisions for
 Central America simply are not sensi-
 tive to what is going on. The chairman
 of the Senate Committee on Foreign
 Relations is on the floor, and I ap-
 plaud the fact that he is reviewing the
 whole panoply of relations of the
 United States with the other nations
 of the world. My own impresssion,
 from some years of travel in Latin
 America, is that uncle Sam is viewed
 in much of Latin America, as a bully
 and exploiter. Sometimes we have
 earned that image, sometimes we have
 not. But what we ought to be doing is
 moving low key in whatever we do,
 and we are doing precisely the oppo-
 site. i think that is counterproductive.
 I remember some years ago before I
 was a Member of the House of Repre-
 sentatives and certainly before I came
 over to the Senate, our family drove
 down the Pan American Highway to
 San Jose. Costa Rica, a trip I would
 not recommendge dm.l:aOSjn6.196 In
 San Jose we visited with Jose Figueres,
 who was then the President of Costa
 Rica, whom I had the opportunity to
 know slightly. We visited in his living
 room. This is right after Richard
 Nixon had become President of the
 United States.
 On the coffee table in his living
 room was an autographed picture of
 Hubert Humphrey. I said, "I am curi-
 ous, Mr. President, why you have that
 autographed picture of Hubert Hum-
 phrey." And he responded, "We sensed
 that Hubert Humphrey really cares
 about us."
 Mr.  President,  what , we  in  the
 United States have to convey is that
 we care about the people of Central
 America and that we are not just using
 them as some kind of a tool' in the
 East-West struggle, and we are not
 conveying that-tight now.
 One of the areas where we ought to
 be doing more-and I am pleased to
 see this bill, and I commend my col-
 league from Indiana, as well as the
 ranking  Democratic  member,  Mr.
 PELL,  and  Senator  MATHIAS  who
 worked on this-is in scholarships.
 One of the largely ignored points
 made, by the Kissenger Commission
 was that the United States in all of
 Central America provides 391 scholar-
 ships, while the Soviets provide about
 7,500. And you do not need great
 imagination to understand that we can
 win a battle and lose a war.
 I do not suggest that every, student
 who comes back from the University
 of Moscow or Partice Lumumba Uni-
 versity comes back a dedicated Com-
 munist, but there is an ideological tilt, '
 just as there is for a student who goes
 to the University of Illinois, or South-
 ern Illinois University, or Indiana Uni-
 versity. or the University of Colorado.
 That is the kind of thing, w6 I ought to
 be doing.
 Our troop involvement in Honduras.
 What we are doing there, in my opin-
 ion, is destabilizing what is probably,.
 the best government that Honduras
 has ever. had. I would suggest we seem
 to learn the lessons of history slowly.
 Libya had a government that was
 not, unfortunately, a good govern-
 ment, but we had a U.S. base there
 and some military leaders and others
 were able to say, "This.government is
 a puppet of the United States." And a
 young colonel by the name of Qadhafi
 and some others overthrew the gov-
 ernment. It is probable that Colonel
 Qadhafi would not be in charge in
 Libya today had there not been a U.S.
 military base there. I think our pres-
 ence in Honduras, rather than stabiliz-
 ing Central America, is a destabilizing
 factor.
 Finally, Mr. President, I am for this
 amendment because I hear not a domi-
 nant voice around here but an occa-
 sional voice-I have heard this from
 someone in the administration. I have
 heard it from a Member of Congress-
 saying, "You know, what we ought to
 do is invade Nicaragua."
 I want to quiet that kind of talk
 quickly, firmly, and without any ques-
 tion whatsoever. If there is anyone in
 responsible position in this administa-
 tion who wants to seriously consider
 that, I am going to do everything I
 possibily can to help prevent it. It is
 not the direction that we ought to go.
 The Hart amendment-and I urge
 my colleagues, those 'who hear my
 voice on their radios in the office as
 well as those who are on the floor, to
 read the Hart amendment, not the
 synopsis of it-is a balanced amend-
 ment that I think represents the view
 of the majority of the Members of the
 Senate. Now, whether the vote is
 going to reflect that, I do not know,
 but if the Members of the' Senate read
 the Hart amendment I think they are
 going to vote for it. I commend my col-
 league from Colorado for his amend-
 ment. It says what we ought to be
 doing. It suggests that diplomatic ini-
 tiatives ought to be the direction. And
 just in general, to reemphasize, we
 ought to be low-keying it in Central
 America.
 Mr. President, if I may use just one
 other illustration. I remember after
 President Reagan had his first press
 conference on Central America, I was
 on a call-in radio program at WGN in
 Chicago. They also had the Managua
 correspondent for Newsweek on the
 radio. I said, "What does troop in-
 volvement, our aid to the Contras, our
 naval flotilla do as far as the Sandinis-
 tas are concerned? Does it strengthen
 them or weaken them?" And she said,
 "Oh, it strengthens  them because
 Uncle Sam is viewed as a bully who is
 trying to dominate Nicaraguan poli-
 cies." And I said, "That is exactly
 what I thought."
 I am not in love with the Sandinis-
 tas. They are not Boy Scouts. But let
 dune 6, 1985
 us adopt policies that pull Central
 America in a positive direction. Let us.
 not be the big bully. Let us not do
 things that just hand the Soviets and
 Marxists and others the kinds of
 issues that I think, day after day, we
 seem to be handing them.
 I am pleased to support the Senator
 from Colorado. I yield back my time to
 him.
 Mr. HART. Mr. President, I thank
 the Senator from Illinois for his very
 perceptive remarks. They got beyond
 the scope of the amendment to de-
 scribe what our policy in the region
 ought to be, something that the Sena.
 for from Colorado had not attempted
 to do. but I fully agree with the thrust
 of the idea the Senator from Illinois
 has put forward as to what a progres-
 sive policy for the United States ought
 to be in that region.
 If I may respond briefly to com-
 ments made by our friend and col-
 league, the distinguished floor manag-
 er and chairman of the committee, if I
 understand his remarks and criticism,
 they amount to this. First of all, this
 amendment would, in his words, signi-
 fy a weakened U.S. commitment in the
 region.
 Mr. President, I hope the day will
 come, not too far in the future, where
 strength has a broader definition than
 mere military power. I know the Sena-
 tor from Indiana, being a thoughtful
 and perceptive ' person, does believe
 that strength should be defined in
 broader terms. But by arguing the way
 he did, he implies that the strength of
 America is derived simply from mili-
 tary power-and military presence.
 We all know from studying human
 nature and human events that quite
 often the strongest individual or the
 strongest nation is the one that is so
 confident in and of itself in its cause
 and principles and values that it does
 not need to demonstrate that strength
 through constant military presence or
 force.
 I hope we do not let ourselves get
 into this kind of one-dimensional, ideo-
 logical,  polarizing  syllogism  which
 says, "If you are for strength, you are
 for military presence and intervention;
 if you are not for military presence
 and intervention, then you are for
 weakness."
 Now, unfortunately, American poli-
 tics in the 1970's and 1980's fell into
 that trap too often: It certainly does
 not elevate the level of dialog and
 debate or challenge the intelligence of
 the American voter. But the fact is we
 can  be  much stronger  in  Central
 America, a region of vital importance
 to this  Nation.  without increased
 American military presence. Let us
 give some thought to what strength is.
 Let us not let ourselves-and certainly
 not someone as intelligent and multi-
 dimensional as the chairman of the
 committee-get into this business of,
 "Well, if we want to be strong, let's
 put our troops in. And if we take our

 June 6, 1985              CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 troops out, then we are necessarily
 weak."
 That is, I think the chairman of the
 committee would admit, a much too
 oversimplified definition of strength.
 Strength is defined by whether we are
 able and willing to protect and pro-
 mote our vital interests in every possi-
 ble way, not one way but every possi-
 ble way.
 He said, further,. that this amend-
 ment would weaken the ability of Hon-
 duras or a neighboring nation to repel
 an attack. This, of course, presumes
 that an attack is imminent or that it is
 even possible, evidence of which has
 yet to be presented to the Senate of
 the United States or the American
 people.
 However, if the President of the
 United States-or his Cabinet, the Sec-
 retary of State, the Secretary of De-
 fense, or the national security appara-
 tus of this Nation-concludes that an
 attack is possible, is likely, is immi-
 nent, then, of course, it is his duty to
 inform the Members of Congress of
 that possibility and to seek our sup-
 port and our cooperation in preparing
 a neighboring nation to repel that
 attack.
 I suppose that, in theory, the Sandi-
 nistas could prepare an all-out attack
 on Honduras or somewhere else over-
 night-massive tanks, troop carriers,
 artillery, infantry, and everything else
 they have-and, 1o and. behold, the
 President might be awakened in the
 middle of the night by a call:
 "Mr. President, this is Bill Casey
 calling. The Nicaraguans have just
 moved en masse across the Honduran
 border."
 The first thing he should do when
 that happens is fire Bill Casey. We are
 not spending billions of dollars, I
 hope, on an intelligence organization
 that could not find out that those
 plans were underway.
 Nevertheless, this amendment pro-
 vides more than ample opportunity for
 the President and the national securi-
 ty apparatus to consult Congress and
 seek, very quickly, our concurrence in
 increasing our military presence in
 this region-it is not halfway around
 the world; it is within short flight
 time-to help the Hondurans to repel
 an attack.
 Finally, as I understand the Sena-
 tor's arguments, he has said that this
 amendment would not increase stabili-
 ty. Mr. President, I have been to Hon-
 duras-not in the last few months but
 in the last couple of years, as many
 Members of the Senate have-and an
 argument can be made, as the Senator
 from Illinois has made, that increased.
 military presence by the United States
 in that countr:-? is not stabilizing.
 Mr. President, the. Senator from Col-
 orado has met with the political oppo-
 sition in Honduras-they are Demo-
 crats, they are nationalists and patri-
 ots who happen not to agree with the
 government in power-and they have
 said to the Senator from California
 that increased American military pres-
 ence is making their nation less stable
 rather than more stable, for many of
 the reasons the Senator from Illinois
 has just stated.
 So, whether the argument about a
 weakened commitment goes to the
 ability of the United States to help
 the Hondurans repel an attack, or it
 goes to the question of whether it does
 or does not help create stability in the
 region, I hope that our colleagues in
 the Senate will reject those argu-
 ments.
 This amendment is designed, more
 than anything else, to bring Congress,
 in a timely way, into decisions that
 may affect the livelihood, the safety,
 and the survival of young Americans
 who might otherwise be called upon,
 without that involvement, to enter
 into 'an unnecessary and unwise mili-
 tary adventure.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appre-
 ciate the comments of the distin-
 guished Senator from Colorado as he
 has discussed his thoughtful amend-
 ment. I also appreciate the statement
 of the Senator from Illinois.
 Let me respond briefly by saying
 that I suspect that no Senator who
 has been involved in the debate would
 equate strength entirely as military
 strength. In fact, military strength
 might be a very small part of the
 strength of our country, in the image
 we present and the way we conduct
 ourselves.
 Our efforts in Central America have
 been to try to provide democratic insti-
 tutions, stronger economies, a thrust
 toward a concept of civil rights and
 human rights that would grow. Our
 strength clearly lies in the image we
 have and in the activities we have
 fashioned to show the strength-of our
 own  constitutional  principles,  and
 where these can be adopted, to try to
 encourage them to be adopted.-
 I think the other side of the coin,
 however, is that strength does not pre-
 clude military strength. One can argue
 how the balance is perceived. Both the
 Senator from Illinois and the Senator
 from Colorado have argued that our
 presence in Central America, in the
 Western Hemisphere, has been inter-
 preted as a bullying presence in a way
 that not only destabilized situations,
 but also brought enemies for our coun-
 try.
 However, the present amendment, as
 I perceive it, is one in which we are ar-
 guing about who should manage mili-
 tary exercises in Central America. The
 thought of the Senator from Colorado
 is that prior to military exercises,
 which are conducted extensively-the
 three Big Pine operations in Honduras
 have  been  mentioned  specifically-
 Congress should push those along by
 an affirmative gesture.
 It has been argued, further, I be-
 lieve, that the Senators, in proposing
 this amendment and supporting it, be-
 lieve that the sheer numbers of per-
 sons we have had in Honduras may
 have led to dangers to our forces or
 dangers to our friends in Honduras.
 S 7615
 That, I think, is arguable. My own
 general assumption is that the Hon-
 durans wanted our presence. There
 have been negotiations from time to
 time as to how extensive they wanted
 it and what quid pro quo was required
 in addition. Those complexities are im-
 portant; and if we were discussing the
 advisability of any one exercise, it is
 arguable both ways.
 I fail to see that our foreign policy is
 going to be enhanced by taking away
 from the President of the United
 States and his administration the abil-
 ity to train troops in Central America,
 provided that we do so in conjunction
 with friendly countries, and provided,
 of course, that they want us there, and
 in my judgment they do. It has not
 been a situation of bullying or a situa-
 tion  in  which  we  have  prevailed
 through our own strength. As a matter
 of fact, we have lent our strength to
 our Honduran friends and perhaps to
 others.
 Finally, I suggest that one of the dif-
 ficulties, in a practical sense, about
 precluding our exercises-and this is
 the reason I made an argument for
 stability-is that the Nicaraguan Gov-
 ernment currently, with a "revolution-
 without-borders" concept, with the de-
 stabilizing efforts made by that gov-
 ernment toward neighboring nations,
 is, unhappily, the sort of government
 that does have an element of surprise,
 an element of covert activity, an ele-
 ment of subversion.
 I am suggesting that the very pres-
 ence of American troops in Honduras,
 for example, by invitation of the Hon-
 duran Government and in conjunction
 with a training mission with Honduran
 forces, has at least led to a second
 thought on the part of the Sandinista
 government with regard to any activi-
 ties that might be conducted toward
 Honduras.
 I think that is all to the good. I do
 not know what the course of activity
 of Nicaragua would have been other-
 wise. I am simply saying that the
 physical presence of our forces there
 has precluded adventures that would
 have been inadvisable, and I think
 that is all to the good.
 Mr. HART. Mr. President, if the
 Senator will yield-I know that we
 have  some  distinguished  visitors-I
 will respond very briefly.
 It is not the intent of the sponsor of
 this amendment to manage troop exer-
 cises. It is not the intent of the spon-
 sor of this amendment to preclude
 troop exercises. It certainly is not the
 intent of the sponsor of this amend-
 ment to prevent the President from
 taking actions that. are necessary to
 defend and protect this country's in-
 terests or those of our allies.
 All this amendment says is that if
 the President is convinced of the need
 for an increased American military
 presence in Central America and if
 there is no emergency, then he must
 come and convince Congress of that. It
 simply involves Congress in any deci-

 sion to increase our military presence
 in the region, absent an emergency.
 I believe that, given any clear read-
 ing of the history of the Constitution,
 that is what our responsibility and
 role are designed to be.
 If the President cannot convince the
 majority Members of the Congress
 that we ought to.have more troops in
 Central America then we probably
 should not have more troops there.

 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassem-
 bled when call to order by the Presid-
 ing Officer [Mr. CHAFES].
 FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORI-
 ZATION  ACT,  FISCAL  YEARS
 1986 AND 1987
 The Senate continued with the con-
 sideration of the bill (S. 1003).
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Indiana.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I dis-
 cussed the situation with the distin-
 guished Senator from Colorado and we
 both agreed that the debate may draw
 to a close in the next few minutes for
 our side. I would be pleased to yield
 back all the time and I believe the
 Senator from Colorado wishes to be
 recognized for a closing statement.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Colorado.
 Mr. HART. Mr. President, I thank
 the distinguished floor manager.  I'
 shall be brief, lest other Senators in
 support of the amendment wish to be
 heard. Then after 2 or 3 minutes of
 concluding remarks, it will be my in-
 tention to yield back the time of the
 proponents. The Senator from Indiana
 may want to reserve time in case the
 Senator from Colorado turns unneces-
 sarily provocative in the 2 or 3 min-
 utes.
 Mr. President, the intent of this
 amendment is quite simple. It is to re-
 quire the President of the United
 States to seek the support of Members
 of Congress before increasing the
 American military- presence in Central
 America. It does not preclude that in-
 crease and it does not require a de-
 crease. It merely says if it is a central
 part of this Nation's `foreign policy in
 this critical region to have increasing
 permanent or semipermanent military
 presence, then the President of the
 United States should seek the endorse-
 ment and support of Congress before
 increasing  that  American  military
 presence.
 It is an amendment born of concern
 that the United States is increasingly
 seeking only a military solution to a
 complex web of problems in that area
 of the world. It is admittedly born of
 increasing concern by the Senator
 from Colorado that the administration
 or some elements of the administra-
 tion might, in fact, seek the ultimate
 military solution to this problem and
 that is some sort of an invasion, pro-
 voked  or 'otherwise,  by  American
 combat forces, without the consent or
 approval of the Congress.
 Mr. President, I think that policy
 would be folly. It would be a policy the
 Senator from Colorado would be pre-
 pared to strongly oppose without more
 evidence of its necessity to our nation-
 al security.
 But, Mr. President, it is the concern
 of the offerer of this amendment that
 Congress and the Senator from Colo-
 rado would not even have the chance
 to reflect our views before that action
 were taken.
 I hope, Mr. President, Members of
 Congress do not vote against this
 amendment and awaken some morning
 unhappily to be notified that this
 Nation is involved in combat against
 Nicaragua.
 I think that would be a sad day for
 this country in terms of its constitu-
 tional process, in terms of the preoga-
 tives of Congress in declaring war and
 in terms of the unnecessary loss of
 young American lives.
 Mr. 'President. I ask for the yeas and
 nays.
 The'  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Is
 there a sufficient second? There is a
 sufficient second.
 The yeas and nays were ordered.
 Mr. HART, Mr. President,- I yield
 back the remainder of my time.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  All
 time having expired on the amend-
 ment, the question is on agreeing to
 the amendment of the Senator from
 Colorado.
 On this question, the yeas and nays
 have been ordered, and the clerk will
 call the roll.
 The assistant legislative clerk called
 the roll.
 Mr. SIMPSON. I announce that the
 Senator  from  Colorado  [Mr.  ARM-
 STRONG],                                                         the Senator from Alabama
 [Mr. DENTON] and the Senator from
 Wyoming [Mr. WALLOP] are necessari-
 ly absent.
 June 6, 1985
 I further announce that, if present
 and voting, the Senator from Alabama
 [Mr. DENTON] would vote "nay".
 Mr. CRANSTON. I announce that
 the Senator from West Virginia [Mr.
 ROCKEFELLER] is necessarily absent.
 I further announce that, if present
 and voting, the Senator from West
 Virginia   [Mr.   ROCKEFELLER]   would
 vote "nay."
 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.

 tors in the Chamber wishing to vote?

 versations please retire to the cloak-
 rooms?
 The Senate will be in order.
 The majority leader.
 Mr. DOLE. I thank the Chair.
 I would say first of all I have dis-
 cussed with the chairman of the com-
 mittee, Senator LUGAR, that we would
 like to complete action on this bill to-
 night. If we do not, we will complete
 action on the bill tomorrow. That is
 where we will start from. If we do
 finish this evening, we would be in ses-
 sion tomorrow but I can assure Mem-
 bers that there would not be any mat-
 ters requiring rollcall votes.
 I am also advised by. the chairman
 that once we get beyond the so-called
 Contra amendments that it will move
 fairly quickly. A number of amend-
 ments will be accepted. There are
 some that will require some debate,
 and maybe a rollcall, but overall, we
 will move rather quickly.
 I  am  rather  optimistic  at  4:25,
 though I may not be that optimistic at
 6:25.
 I would suggest to Senators who
 have Contra amendments, and I know
 they all have great merit, if we could
 use less time we might be able to
 finish the entire bill by 8:30 or 9
 o'clock this evening, which would ac-
 commodate a number of Senators on
 each side who have official commit-
 ments elsewhere tomorrow.
 On Monday, if we did not finish this
 bill, we would still be on the bill. But it
 is my hope to take up the clean water
 legislation.
 Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank
 the distinguished majority leader. I
 have one further question, that being
 what would be the business on tomor-
 row which would cause the Senate to
 come in but not require rollcall votes?
 Mr. DOLE. A number of bills have
 been reported by the Commerce Com-
 mittee which we understand .have been
 cleared on both sides. Obviously, if
 they have not been cleared, we will not
 try to address them. But there will be
 no rollcall votes. I can assure that. If
 something did develop, we would post-
 pone action until Monday. I believe
 they are allfrom the Commerce Com-
 mittee. I can double check and give
 the distinguished minority leader a list
 of those we have in mind.
 Mr.  BYRD.  I  thank the  distin-
 guished majority leader.
 Mr. President, if the distinguished
 majority leader would accept one final
 suggestion, when the Senate moves on
 beyond the Biden and Nunn amend-
 ments, I wonder if it might be possible
 for Members to indicate their willing-
 ness to limit time on the remaining
 amendments.
 Mr. DOLE. I would hope that would
 be the case. The managers of the bill
 might consult with Senators. I might
 say I have one amendment and I am
 prepared to yield all time back at the
 appropriate time. I want to try to set a
 pattern for others to follow. .1 have the
 last amendment and I do not really be-
 lieve I will need to offer it. Maybe the
 managers between now and the next
 vote can encourage others not to take
 the full 60 minutes or 90 minutes,
 whatever it is.
 Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank
 the majority leader. I thank the Chair
 for getting  order . and  maintaining
 order.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Indiana.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the next
 amendment in order is an amendment
 to be offered by the distinguished Sen-
 ator from Delaware (Mr. BIDEN].
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Delaware.
 AMENDMENT NO. 274
 (Purpose: To establish. terms for TI.S. policy
 toward Nicaragua)
 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an
 amendment to the desk and ask for its
 immediate consideration.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 clerk will report.
 The bill clerk read as follows:
 The Senator from Delaware (Mr. BIDEN7
 proposes an:amendment numbered 274.
 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that further read-

 At the end of the bill, add the following

 NICARAGUA: THE PRESIDENT PRESENTS A
 HOBSON'S CHOICE
 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, late in
 the  17th                                           century,  a  Englishman
 named Thomas  Hobson adopted a
 rigid, rather inhospitable practice in
 the operation of his riding stable near
 Cambridge.                                          To students  from  the
 nearby university who came to rent a
 horse, Mr. Hobson offered a simple
 choice: take the one nearest the stable
 door, or none at all.
 Today, as we renew discussion of
 American policy toward Nicaragua, we
 unfortunately are presented a choice
 no better than that offered by the
 metaphorically famous Mr. Hobson.
 But just as there was only one stable
 near Cambridge, we have only one
 American foreign policy. Consequent-
 ly, we must deal with the choice we
 ? face.
 The  essential  issue  before  us  is
 whether, and on what conditions, to
 aid  the  Nicaraguan  resistance-the
 Contras. I deplore the circumstances
 under which we are forced to deal
 with this issue because I think that
 the administration has failed in an im-
 portant responsibility, which is to ex-,
 haust all avenues of diplomacy before
 shifting to a policy that emphasizes
 military force. By its denigration of
 the Contadora process, by its apparent
 willingness to supply aid to any and all
 elements opposed to the Sandinista
 regime, and by its hastily imposed em-
 bargo, the administration has man-
 aged to generate for Mr. Ortega an
 international sympathy which his gov-
 ernment could never have earned for
 itself.
 We thus find a situation involving
 three flawed players:  a Sandinista
 regime which shows little disposition
 to fullfill the promise. of the Nicara-
 guan revolution, a resistance which in-
 cludes some truly democratic leaders
 but also a number of unsavory figures
 responsible for unjustifiable behavior,
 and   an   ideological  administration
 which appears to be spoiling for a
 fight as the only satisfactory solution:
 To return to the metaphor of Mr.
 Hobson, some would argue that we
 should walk away-that because we
 June 6, 1985
 are offered no attractive choice, we
 should have nothing to do with the
 situation. But as emotionally satisfy-
 ing and politically popular as that
 might be, I cannot judge it to be the
 responsible course. Nor, however, do I
 think we should simply accept the
 horse offered by Mr. Hobson-in this
 case, Mr. Reagan. Instead, I think we
 must impress upon him the need for a
 better horse-a better, more balanced
 approach-and that is the purpose of
 the amendment I wish to offer today.
 A BALANCED APPROACH
 The amendment I offer is a modifi-
 cation of the proposal-concerning so-
 called humanitarian assistance to the
 Contras-made by my, party during ne-
 gotiations with the White House on
 this issue several weeks ago. Those
 terms were embodied in a resolution
 [S.J. Res.  120]  introduced by the
 Democratic  leader.  The  principal
 modifications I have made are to place
 strict conditions on any future U.S. aid
 to the Nicaraguan resistance and to
 add certain elements. of inducement,
 including a possible suspension of the
 U.S. embargo, should the Sandinistas
 wish to adopt a more cooperative atti-
 tude toward negotiation with the Nica-
 raguan opposition. I shall summarize
 briefly the provisions of this amend-
 ment:
 CURRENT AID TO THE NICARAGUAN OPPOSITION
 First, the amendment contains pro-
 visions relating to current aid to the
 Nicaraguan opposition. It does so by
 maintaining in law the Boland amend-
 ment, prohibiting military or paramili-
 tary assistance, while providing $14
 million in so-called humanitarian as-
 sistance. I note, Mr. President, that
 some of my colleagues have expressed
 concern about closing loopholes which
 might allow some of this money to aid
 the Contras militarily. I must say that
 I find any such concern to be misfo-
 cused. The fact is that this aid will
 ipso facto. help the Contras militarily
 because it will help them economical-
 ly; it is as simple as that, so let us
 speak candidly. We are providing this
 aid in the form of so-called humanitar-
 ian assistance because we wish, at this
 time, to confer on the Nicaraguan re-
 sistance some measure of legitimacy
 and practical assistance without af-
 firming the political and moral com-
 mitment entailed by overt military
 support. Accordingly, my amendment
 requires that the aid be distributed by
 the State Department from State De-
 partment funds, in order to minimize
 the dangers arising from the presence
 and involvement of U.S. military or
 CIA personnel in the field.
 BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS
 Second, in addition, the amendment
 seeks to promote negotiations by con-
 ditioning the availability of this aid on
 the demonstrated willingness of the
 administration and of the Contras to
 enter into talks with the Nicaraguan
 Government; and urging full U.S. sup-
 port for the Contadora process, to

 June 6, 1985                CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 which the administration has accorded
 far too little support heretofore, while
 authorizing the expenditure of State
 Department funds to support the im-
 plementation   of   any   agreement
 reached through that process.   -
 INDUCEMENTS TO THE SANDINISTA GOVERNMENT
 Third, and relatedly, the amend-
 ment offers to the Sandinista govern-
 ment certain inducements to negotia-
 tion by providing for a suspension of
 the U.S. economic embargo if the Gov-
 ernment of Nicaragua enters into a
 ceasefire and negotiations with opposi-
 tion forces; declaring, as does the
 Nunn resolution, that the President
 should suspend military maneuvers
 near Nicaragua if the Sandinista gov-,
 ernment agrees to a cease-fire, talks
 with the opposition, and an end to the
 country's declared state of emergency;
 and setting forth, as does the Hamil-
 ton resolution in the House, certain
 conditions  under  which  Congress
 would consider establishing programs
 of assistance to the Nicaraguan nation.
 HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUTURE AID TO THE
 NICARAGUAN OPPOSITION
 Finally, and of central importance,
 the amendment declares that, beyond
 the funds authorized in this bill, Con-
 gress shall consider further aid to the
 Nicaraguan opposition only if the op-
 position  has  acted  effectively  to
 remove from its ranks 'those persons
 who have engaged in serious abuses of
 human rights. An associated and cru-
 cial provision is that the President
 shall be required to submit, in con-
 junction with any future request for
 further economic or military aid for
 the Nicaraguan opposition, a detailed
 certification that such house cleaning
 has in fact occurred. I should under-
 score that any such certification would
 be subject to Congressional secutiny in
 the course of hearings on the Presi-
 dent's request for further aid.
 IMPLICATIONS OF U.S. AID TO THE CONTRAS
 Mr. President, Nicaragua has al-
 ready  been  subject  to .prolonged
 debate in this body. But I do judge
 that certain observations are in order
 concerning the implications of U.S. aid
 to the Contras, which many draw as a
 moral issue in terms of black and
 white, but which I must confess to
 finding a complex foreign policy issue
 suffused only by shades of gray.
 LEGITIMACY OF U.S. AID
 As to whether it is legitimate for us
 to aid a Nicaraguan  opposition,  I
 simply do not find it persuasive to
 argue that such action is intrinsically
 improper. The Sandinistas themselves
 received ample international assist-
 ance in overthrowing Somoza, and few
 observers-no   matter   how   high
 minded-found fault with that. More-
 over, the Sandinistas themselves have
 declared  that their  own ideology
 impels them to provide assistance to
 other revolutions, as they have indeed
 done. So unless one is an advocate of
 the Brezhnev doctrine that all Com-
 munist revolutions must be regarded
 as irreversible, the providing of Ameri-
 can aid to the Nicaraguan opposition
 is hardly a violation of sacrosanct
 international principal. I believe the
 essential criterion-and it is a practical
 one-is  whether  what  we  do  will
 employ reasonable means to produce a
 desirable result.
 IMPLIED COMMITMENT
 As to whether my amendment com-
 mits the United States to further sup-
 port for the Contras, the answer is
 that it does not; it leaves-that question
 fully open for the time being. What it
 does do, however, is express that the
 United States ascribes political legiti-
 macy to the concept of a Nicaraguan
 democratic opposition. Simultaneous-
 ly, however, the amendment estab-
 lishes a framework -which will divorce
 us from the opposition if it does not
 complete its evolution from being a
 symbol of the worst of Nicaragua's
 past to being the repository of the
 best hope for Nicaragua's future. If
 the diplomatic efforts encouraged by
 this amendment fail, Congress will in
 the future face a tough choice on, the
 issue of further economic and/or mili-
 tary aid. But that question is not prej-
 udiced by our action now in providing
 an increment of economic aid while
 putting the military approach, as Sen-
 ator NUNN  has put it, on the back
 burner. The question of future aid
 would be prejudiced only if we failed
 to keep the option open.
 U.S. MILITARY INVOLVEMENT
 Finally, and of fundamental impor-
 tance, we face the question as to
 whether we are paving the way for U.S
 military involvement, a specter repeat-
 edly invoked and, in veiw of this ad-
 ministration's apparent propensities,
 worth considering with great care.
 Some argue that any support at all for
 the Contras is, for the United States, a
 step on the road to war. But it can, I
 believe, be argued with comparable
 force that a hands off policy would be
 equally, if not more, likely to lead to
 war-by inviting Soviet and Nicara-
 guan advanturism and by allowing fur-
 ther polarization and instability in
 Central America. In considering any
 further aid to the Contras-particular-
 ly military aid-we will have to weigh
 carefully the measure of our implied
 or explicit commitment to them. But
 it is a dangerous and perverse oversim-
 plification to argue that the only way
 to avoid war is to dissociate ourselves
 from supporting those who represent
 democratic values. The key test, as my
 amendment emphasizes, is whether
 the Nicaraguan opposition truly repre-
 sents such values. If it does not, it
 cannot represent a sound option for
 American policy.
 CONGRESSIONAL MEDDLING
 The imperative that American for-
 eign policy reflect a real concern for
 human rights brings me to a final
 matter: The recurrent charge that
 Congress, moved by a foolish or timid
 idealism, is meddling in the policymak-
 ing process and thereby tying the
 President's' hands. These are familiar
 S 7619
 themes. But to refute this charge, one
 need look no further than our recent
 policy toward El Salvador.
 At the outset of President Reagan's
 first term, the alarm bells sounded and
 we were told that the Communist in-
 surgency in El Salvador must be com-
 bated at all costs. Those in Congress
 who criticized a policy that would
 have blindly supported the brutalities
 of the Salvadoran right were described
 as victims of the Veitnam syndrome.
 But congressional pressure continued
 nonetheless. The result was a tortuous.
 policymaking process and a hybrid
 policy-a policy that nobody had in-
 tended and few liked. Yet that policy
 appears to have worked-by blending
 the administration's emphasis on mili-
 tary aid with congressional emphasis
 on the practical reality that popular
 support in a civil war cannot be won
 by death squads, which serve only to
 feed guerrilla strength.
 The turning point came in 1983. El
 Salvador's Communist guerrillas had
 hoped  that  congressional  pressure
 would result in a cutoff of U.S. aid to
 the Salvadoran Government. Instead,
 they found themselves confronting a
 balanced American policy that contin-
 ued military and economic aid, while
 placing heavy pressure on the Salva-
 doran Government to clamp down on
 the rightwing death squads, to over-
 haul the armed forces, and to continue
 the process of domestic reform. In
 sum, the administration had finally
 accepted  that  public support-here
 and among the Salvadoran people-de-
 pended upon curbing the abuses of the
 Salvadoran right. The result was a
 constructive policy-shaped by con-
 gressional meddling-that has contrib-
 uted to the encouraging, though obvi-
 ously still tenuous, progress in El Sal-
 vador that we see today:
 CONCLUSION
 While any analogy between El Salva-
 dor and Nicaragua is imperfect, two
 principles clearly apply to both. The
 first is that an American policy which
 supports the use of force must attend
 carefully to the purposes and means
 which govern its use. The second is
 that, in civil conflict, the outcome
 must finally be determined by those
 directly  involved;  for  the  United
 States to seek, or drift into, a central
 role is to ensure failure.
 Mr. President, Mr. Hobson has not
 been easy with us on the subject of
 Nicaragua. Here, as on several other
 issues, he appears to be working hand
 in hand with Mr. Reagan. But I be-
 lieve that through this amendment we
 can obtain something better than the
 choice between no horse at all and ad-
 ministration's armored and blindered
 war horse. We can obtain balance-by
 placing due emphasis on negotiations
 and by infusing our policy with an es-
 sential concern for democratic values
 and human rights.
 I urge adoption of the amendment.
 Mr. President, before I yield the
 floor, I ask unanimous consent that

 amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.-
 Mr. COHEN and Mr. SASSER ad-
 dressed the Chair.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senators from Maine.
 Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, I want
 to take this opportunity to commend
 my colleague.  -
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who
 yields  time  to  the  Senator  from
 Maine?
 Mr. LUGAR. I will be pleased to
 yield time.
 Mr. COHEN. Will the Senator from
 Delaware yield?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who
 yields  time  to  the  Senator  from
 Maine?
 Mr. BIDEN. How much time does
 the Senator have?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve
 minutes.
 Mr. BIDEN. I yield 2 minutes to the
 Senator from Maine.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Maine is recognized for 2
 minutes.
 Mr. COHEN. I thank the Senator
 for yielding. I want to commend the
 Senator from Delaware for trying to
 strike a balance between the polar ex-
 tremes, between no aid at all, as some
 have advocated, or unlimited aid as
 some would like. I believe it has been
 apparent that we cannot build a for-
 eign policy on partisan planks or pos-
 turing. I think the Senator from Dela-
 ware has offered at least one option to
 avoiding this partisan wrangling we
 have had for the past several years on
 what to do about Nicaragua.
 I have another question I should like
 to pose to the Senator from Delaware,
 however, One of the attractive fea-
 tures I find in the Lugar-Nunn amend-
 ment is that it seeks to avoid bringing
 this subject to the floor time after
 time but, rather, have some sense of
 continuity and time to develop and
 evolve this policy. I notice that the
 Senator from Delaware, I' believe, has
 offered funding for 1 year only and
 that the Lugar-Nunn proposal is for 2
 years or through 1986. I was wonder-
 ing whether or not the Senator from
 Delaware would consider an amend-
 ment which would extend that time
 frame to grant a little more time for
 continuity and not force it back upon
 the Congress again in a very short
 period of time?
 Mr. BIDEN. I think the case that
 the Senator makes is a valid one. I am
 somewhat ambivalent about it. The
 Senator probably does not have the
 amendment in front of him, but the
 first  section,  section  602(a),  says,
 "During fiscal year 1985 not more
 than 15 million," et cetera.
 I would, depending on the attitude
 of my cosponsors, with whom I would
 like to take time to check, be willing to
 suggest that during the fiscal year
 1985 and again during fiscal year 1986
 not more than-in other words, adding
 1986 because it does not' seem to do vi-
 olence to what my approach is because
 the conditions still must be met in
 each of those years. I would be willing
 to do that, but I ask the Senator if he
 would withhold making a formal re-
 quest and give me an opportunity to
 consult with my cosponsors.
 Mr. COHEN. I will certainly with-
 hold that request and await any judg-
 ment the Senator might have.
 Mr. BIDEN. I yield time to the Sena-
 tor from Tennessee.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Tennessee is recognized.
 Mr. SASSER. Mr. President, I thank
 the distinguished Senator from Dela-
 ware.
 Mr. President, 15 months ago, when
 I  visited  Honduras,  I  found  the
 Reagan administration had been con-
 ducting what amounted to a secret
 military buildup in that region of the
 world.
 Since coming to office, the adminis-
 tration has been engaged in a Central
 American policy that has left open few
 options except military solutions.
 The administration has failed to ag-
 gressively seek diplomatic solutions to
 the Central American crisis. Indeed, in
 the past months we have witnessed
 the erosion of diplomatic alternatives.
 Early last year when I visited the
 region,  it appeared the Sandinista
 Government of Nicaragua was en-
 gaged in what amounted to only a de-
 fensive military buildup to repel the
 Contra invaders. Furthermore, it ap-
 peared the Government of Nicaragua
 could be persuaded to permit free elec-
 tions and engage in talks on the legiti-
 mate security issues of the region.
 In the past months, however, the
 world has witnessed a continual mili-
 tary buildup of men and equipment in
 Nicaragua which some believe exceeds
 the requirements of solely a defensive
 posture. Likewise, those efforts which
 have been made to enter into negotia-
 tions, for whatever reason, have failed
 to produce results.
 Except for brief moments of public
 .relations theater when the Sandinistas
 embraced a draft Contadora treaty
 and the Reagan administration agreed
 to bilateral talks in Manzanillo, the re-
 ality of the situation is that all sides
 have dug in their heels,. hardened
 their positions, and cut away much of
 the middle ground.
 Today, we see a Sandinista govern-
 ment determined to hold and consoli-
 date power at any cost-even if that
 cost is the bankruptcy of its nation,
 the repudiation of its officially- pro-
 claimed nonaligned foreign policy, and
 the  potential  invasion  by  foreign
 armies.
 Today, we also see the Reagan ad-
 ministration determined to prevent
 the consolidation of that Sandinista
 power, even if such a policy weakens
 our standing in the world community,
 divides our country, and leads to a
 direct U.S. military intervention.
 June 6, 1985
 So, that is where we are today, Mr.
 President.  There  is  little  middle
 ground left. Someone-the Sandinis-
 tas,  the                                                                                                  Contras,  or  the  United
 States-has to compromise, or there is
 going to be a war in Central America,
 and the blood of thousands of Ameri-
 cans and Nicaraguans will be spilled.
 Now, we could argue on this floor
 forever about the history of the'con-
 flict in Nicaragua. It is clear the
 United States has a dismal history in
 Central America. And our recent his-
 tory is completely in character with
 our past.
 It is also clear that administration
 policy toward Nicaragua has failed.
 Indeed, it has not achieved any of the
 President's stated goals: The Sandinis-
 tas today are stronger, more pro-
 Soviet, and more determined to hold
 power than ever.
 But, the failure of administration
 policy to date, unfortunately, cannot
 be changed. Who is at fault for the
 crisis in the region is no longer the
 central question.
 The simple fact of life is: There is a
 crisis. The Sandinistas, for whatever
 reason-either in response to adminis-
 tration  pressure  or  by  their  own
 design-have   turned   increasingly
 toward the Soviet bloc for military aid
 and assistance.
 And as the Sandinistas grow deeper
 in debt to the Soviet Union, United
 States security interests in the region
 begin to take on a new context.
 Mr. President, I have consistently
 opposed funding for the covert Contra
 war, directed by the Central Intelli-
 gence Agency.  That approach  has
 been demonstrated to be, not only in-
 effective, but also -morally deficient
 for a great country such as the United
 States. Furthermore, it is abundantly
 clear that the Contras cannot, alone,
 bring about change inside Nicaragua.
 The best hope for change and recon-
 ciliation remains the Contadora peace
 process. The United States cannot dic-
 tate a lasting settlement to the region-
 al conflict. That can only be achieved
 by the nations most' affected, the
 Latin American countries themselves.
 Yet, the United States must be seen
 as promoting that process if Contadors
 still has a chance to succeed.
 Some amendments being offered to
 this bill appear to achieve that goal.
 But the time has come when we must
 do more than merely endorse the Con-
 tadora peace process. We cannot pro-
 vide a carrot without a stick. History
 has taught us that neither the stick
 nor the carrot, alone, is sufficient to
 achieve progress toward a negotiated
 settlement in the region.
 Other amendments appear to pro-
 vide substantially only a stick. And if
 we repeal the Boiand amendment pro-
 vision, it is likely to result in an even
 deeper involvement of the Central In-
 telligence Agency in the prosecution
 of the Contra war. So, I cannot sup-
 port amendments. which could return
 this Nation to a policy which was

 found deficient over a year ago. Such
 amendments risk an every growing
 military involvement of the United
 States.
 But, Mr. President, it has become
 clear that this Nation must adopt a
 new policy toward Nicaragua. We must
 adopt a policy which includes both a
 .carrot and a stick.
 Mr. President, last year it appeared
 the Sandinistas were being persuaded
 to begin to enter negotiations in good
 faith. That no longer appears to be
 the case, at least for now. For after
 the Congress turned down further
 military assistance to the Contras,
 President Ortega immediately went to
 Moscow  to  negotiate  instead  with
 Soviet leaders.
 Certainly, a case can be made that it
 is the policies of the Reagan adminis-
 tration which have pushed the Sandi-
 nistas toward the Soviets. That may
 be true. But, President Ortega had a
 choice. Instead of immediately going
 to. Moscow, he could have seized the
 moment to probe opportunities for
 reinstituting a dialog with the United
 States and the opposition within his
 own country.
 Mr. President, I will vote for the
 Biden amendment today. And my vote
 should be interpreted as more than just
 a protest vote against the Ortega trip.
 I am voting for this amendment be-
 cause it offers a new- approach to
 American policy in Nicaragua. The
 Biden amendment provides an oppor-
 tunity to promote a, new nonmilitary
 solution to ending the crisis. First, it
 endorses the Contadora peace process.
 But it takes even more concrete steps
 which can reduce the tension in the
 region. Most importantly, it offers the
 opportunity for the United States to
 pull back from the military abyss in
 Central America. Yet, by providing
 nonmilitary aid to the Contras, it
 maintains the option to renew military
 pressure should efforts to achieve a
 cease-fire and new negotiations fail.
 Therefore, the Biden amendment,. in
 my judgment, provides substantial in-
 centives to all sides to attempt, at least
 one more time, to achieve a peaceful
 solution without resorting to military
 action.
 Mr. President, I also support the
 Biden amendment because the Sandi-
 nistas need to know. that there are
 limits to their activities in the region.
 They need to understand that the le-
 gitimate interest of the United States
 cannot tolerate enhanced Soviet influ-
 ence in this vital region of the world.
 Mr. President, the Biden amend-
 ment represents a new opportunity
 which must be embraced by those who
 seek peace in Central America. With-
 out it, we will be able to exert no lever-
 age over either the Sandinistas or the
 Contras.  Without it,  the  Congress
 leaves the development of Central
 American policy solely to the tender
 mercies of the Reagan administration.
 Without this new approach, the Nica-
 raguan crisis will be merely left to de-
 teriorate.
 Mr. President, we cannot sit idly by
 and permit the Nicaraguan crisis, to
 embroil our Nation in another costly
 and  unnecessary  foreign war.  The
 Biden amendment gives all sides an
 opportunity to take stock of their posi-
 tion. It provides an incentive for a
 cease-fire, a cooling-off period to allow
 moderation and peaceful purpose to
 replace belligerence and armed con-
 flict.
 Mr. President, the remaining middle
 ground is growing soft. There is little
 time left to halt the drift toward a
 Central American war.
 This Congress must enact a legisla-
 tive framework which attempts to
 strengthen the middle ground and
 gives us another chance to achieve a
 peaceful settlement to the crisis.
 The Biden amendment, I believe,
 offers us that opportunity.
 Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.
 Mr. President, I reserve the remain-
 der of my time.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who
 yields time?
 Mr. LUGAR. I yield myself such
 time as I may require.
 Mr.  President,  I  appreciate  the
 thoughtful amendment by the Sena-
 tor from Delaware and the cosponsors.
 The Senator from Delaware and
 those with whom he is associated in
 this amendment have taken seriously
 the fact that the carrot and the stick
 must be involved, and have worked to
 try to apply a measure of both. My op-
 position to their amendment will come
 on certain particulars that I want to
 enumerate, but I suppose more gener-
 ally from the standpoint that I believe
 that the Nunn-Lugar amendment is a
 better  alternative.  Essentially, ' to
 adopt both, in a parliamentary situa-
 tion,  would render the conference
 committee's task very difficult.
 Both amendments track along cer-
 tain points. Perhaps both arise from
 negotiations  that  occurred  at  the
 White House a few weeks ago and sub-
 sequently, in an attempt to find a bi-
 partisan foreign policy that could help
 our Secretary of State work for better
 success in Central America. So I ac-
 knowledge the origins of a number of
 the activities described in both the
 Biden . amendment  and   the  Nunn-
 Lugar amendment.
 It, appears to me, however, that the
 Biden amendment attempts to have
 more restrictions on the Contras, the
 freedom  fighters, than  the  Nunn-
 Lugar amendment provides for. It has
 some  problems  in  bringing  about
 changes in the situation that we would
 deem desirable.
 Let me say quickly, as a matter of
 overall philosophy, that it seems to me
 that the purpose of our activity today
 is to provide a context in which negoti-
 ations ultimately between the forces
 in Nicaragua itself may come to pass.
 Those are negotiations that are mean-
 ingful, ones that open up a govern-
 ment that needs political freedom, po-
 litical opportunities, freedom of. the
 press, and, other desirable safeguards
 S 7621
 with regard to surrounding nations
 and safeguards to our Nation from a
 surprise visit by the Soviets or others
 who might implant weapons and mate-
 rial in Nicaragua.
 We have come to some differences of
 opinion as to how these negotiations
 within Nicaragua are best to be fos-
 tered. I think there is a growing con-
 sensus in Congress that we should do
 all we can to support the Contadora
 process and the activities of neighbors.
 It seems to me that in both instances
 we have come to the conclusion that
 there may be desirability for negotia-
 tions between the United States and
 Nicaragua under some situations. This
 may advance the process, although
 clearly it will not end the process. It is
 one facet of it, in the context of nego-
 tiations that finally must proceed to
 the Sandinistas, themselves, taking a
 look  at  democratic  elements  that
 should be part of the Government and
 working out a settlement at that stage.
 It seems to me that the Biden
 amendment is less forceful in bringing
 about those circumstances,   because
 the amendment, first of all, does not
 repeal the Boland amendment. This, I
 suppose, is a matter of some judgment;
 but,, clearly, the Nunn-Lugar amend-
 ment does repeal Boland. It does try to
 take away all of the restrictions that
 the Boland language has brought to
 bear on the situation.
 There are perhaps some Senators
 and some Members of the House who
 are deeply mistrustful of the adminis-
 tration and, to put it another way,
 much more trustful of the ability of
 Congress  to  micromanage  foreign
 policy. The Boland amendment is that
 type of situation. I suppose it is a
 fielder's choice.
 The  distinguished  Senator   from
 .Tennessee said that if we do not go
 the route of the Biden amendment, we
 might leave Nicaragua and Central
 American.policy at the tender mercies
 of the Reagan administration, as if
 this were a hideous type of alterna-
 tive. There are many people who like
 the President of the United States,
 who feel essentially that it would not
 be at all bad if the President of the
 United States had a lot more to say
 with regard to a Central American
 policy than Congress collectively. I am
 not certain, given that alternative,
 that I would have selected the Biden
 amendment.
 On the other hand, I suggest that
 there is in the Biden amendment in-
 herently an attempt, in a mechanistic
 fashion, as the Senator from Delaware
 has pointed out, to set up an analogy
 to what Congress attempted in El Sal-
 vador.
 I suppose, once again, we might have
 a difference of opinion historically as
 to why the American policy in El Sal-
 vador has had some success. In part, of
 course, as we mentioned this morning,
 it has been because there were some
 very good El Salvadoran leaders. We
 were fortunate that that was so. To

 the extent that our micromanagement
 of El  Salvador was  helpful, more
 power to Congress.
 My own judgment is that it is argu-
 able to the extent to which that
 worked out that way.
 This leads me to the same sort of a
 problem, I suppose, with the Biden
 amendment.  Even  given  the  good
 things that I admit are similar to the
 Nunn-Lugar effort and the best inten-
 tions of the authors. I do not see it as
 sufficiently strong.
 I simply suggest that the Biden
 amendment is an effort that is con-
 structive, but I would hope that it
 would not be adopted-simply because
 I believe that it does not have the
 thrust of Nunn-Lugar and that that
 thrust is essentially one in which sub-
 stantially more funds will be available
 under  less  restrictive  terms.  Thus
 there is an extra degree of pressure
 imposed through the new resources
 transferred  to  the  Contra   forces,
 albeit in the area of humanitarian as-
 sistance. This will lead, I believe, to
 the proper degree of pressure that will
 make negotiations more probable in
 terms of their potential success.
 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield on one point?
 Mr. LUGAR. I am happy to yield.
 Mr. BIDEN. The Senator indicated
 concern about the Boland amendment.
 We all have different reasons why we
 did not want the Boland amendment
 in. If I could take a moment to explain
 to the -Senator my rationale, I want to
 get something passed. Quite frankly if
 the Boland amendment is in what the
 Senate passes, it is not going to get
 anywhere in the House of Representa-
 tives. No. 2, whether or not it gives the
 President a free hand, leave that aside
 a moment whether he should or not
 have that, what the repeal of Boland
 does by implication by what went
 before it is to say the CIA is back in
 the game, it is a red flag that went up.
 I do not think it does any violence, in
 my opinion, to Nunn-Lugar to not
 have Boland.
 The rationale  for Senator  NUNN
 originally, and I assume the Senator
 from Indiana for having the amend-
 ment the way it was, is that we would
 not be able to allow it to be shared in-
 telligence data. That was the rationale
 offered to me.
 I argue you can do that even under
 Boland. Without belaboring the point,
 that was the Senator's rationale for
 excluding  Boland  from  the  Biden
 amendment.
 Mr. LUGAR. I appreciate that point.
 -The Senator's judgment may be sound
 in terms of the conference procedures,
 the  strong  position  taken  by the
 House of Representatives. I think all
 of us are looking toward a policy that
 has a good chance of getting a two-
 House bipartisan proposition. I would
 still indicate it appears to me that the
 Boland language at least in this con-
 text is not a good idea in terms of pro-
 cedure.
 I know the President feels strongly
 about this because I have heard it
 from him and talked to him about it as
 recently as 2 days ago. So I take that
 into consideration, too, even with my
 great respect for our colleague, Mr.
 BoLAND and the Speaker, who have
 very strong feelings, also.
 Let me conclude this particular part
 of the argument by saying once again
 that I appreciate the general thrust of
 what is occurring here, but it seems to
 me it is a micromanagement, and that
 word is being overused, but it is still
 descriptive in which a group of well-
 meaning persons such as ourselves and
 the 435 Members of the House of Rep-
 resentatives are attempting to set up a
 number of conditions and the net
 effect, at least as I read the amend-
 ment, is one in which it is unlikely
 that the Sandinista government of
 Nicaragua will be willing to negotiate
 seriously, that the pressures of the
 Biden amendment are insufficient to
 make that likely.
 Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield
 for a question?
 Mr. LUGAR. Yes.
 Mr. BIDEN. What pressures? I am
 not being facetious. What pressures
 within the Nunn-Lugar amendment
 would in fact encourage that, that are
 not in the Biden amendment?
 Mr. LUGAR. First of all, and per-
 haps the Senator is in the process of
 amending his amendment, but the
 Nunn-Lugar amendment provides for,
 in addition to the $14 million and the
 repeal of the Boland amendment in
 the first year, $24 million in a second
 year which is a sustained effort. The
 Sandinistas really have to know that
 there is some staying power involved
 in that situation.
 I would say beyond that that it ap-
 pears to me that the constrict of the
 Biden amendment, and I would refer
 to section 602 in which the $14 million
 comes only if the United States re-
 sumes bilateral negotiations with the
 Government of Nicaragua.
 That. fits in a little different way
 than the Nunn-Lugar language. We
 encourage the President as part of a
 number of things that might be help-
 ful.
 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield for a question on this
 point?.
 Mr. LUGAR. Yes.
 Mr. BIDEN. Has he had an opportu-
 nity to read section (b) of 602 which
 indicates that if in fact the Nicara-
 guans refuse, then there no longer has
 to be a condition of bilateral negotia-
 tion?
 Mr. LUGAR. Yes, I have read that,
 and I appreciate that that does obviate
 No. 2 and No. 3 to the extent that the
 Sandinistas, do not want to go that
 route.
 I think a part of. our debate in the
 earlier amendments today was the pre-
 occupation of Senators in demanding
 that we get together with the Sandi-
 nistas, that this is the essential set of
 negotiations. But for this to be the
 June 6, 1985
 central focus seems to me to be unfor-
 tunate.
 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield for another question?
 Mr. LUGAR. Yes.
 Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator believes,
 and I am inclined to think he is cor-
 rect, that the Sandinistas have no in-
 dication and no desire to bargain in
 good faith, then I ask the Senator
 what have we lost by including this in
 an amendment to satisfy my friends
 who believe, that in fact they would
 negotiate? Is it not better to make
 that a condition, be assured the Presi-
 dent attempted it under amendment,
 demonstrate that they would not and
 then move forward? Does that not aid
 the Senator's objective of having to
 sustain policy in the region which rec-
 ognizes the threat with respect to the
 Sandinista presence?
 Mr. LUGAR. I suggest that, as the
 Senator has presented the idea, it is
 helpful in terms of gaining broader
 support in the Senate because it is ob-
 vious, given the offering of this type
 of negotiation at least twice before,
 but people feel very deeply about it.
 Mr. BIDEN. I was moved by the Sen-
 ator's speech. at the National Press
 Club where he called about the need
 of a broad based, bipartisan long-range
 policy.
 Mr. LUGAR. This is reaching for
 that, probably gathering a few more in
 the fold.
 Mr. BIDEN. I am not being face-
 tious.
 Mr. LUGAR: Of course not. It seems
 to me and the Senator cannot have
 the thing in focus that the thrust of
 the negotiating procedure misses. In
 other words, we have the situation in
 which granted to include people who
 believe that really we are mainly the
 ones that are at fault and it is our lack
 of willingness to talk and engage in
 these activities, that is really the fault.
 There is nothing in this procedure
 that I can see that leads to the type of
 internal negotiation within Nicaragua
 or at least'indicates that those are the
 sort of most important ones and that
 anything beyond that are in a support-
 ing role.
 The nuances of the amendment may,
 have escaped me, but it just seems the
 thrust of it is once again one in which
 we are sort of pounding ourselves over
 the head for our inability to do a cer-
 tain  number  of  things  with  the
 thought that really down deep we are
 at fault.
 Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield
 for a question again--
 Mr. DIXON. Mr. President, I wonder
 if my colleague will permit me to ask a
 question of the distinguished manager.
 Mr. BIDEN. The Senator from Dela-
 ware really has no time and I was
 asking the Senator a question. It is
 fine by me if the Senator will allow
 the Senator from Illinois to ask him a,
 question on his time. I will be willing
 to yield my time.

 June 6, 1985              CONGRESSIONAL RECORD'- SENATE
 Mr. DIXON. Mr. President, will the
 distinguished manager permit me to
 ask a question of him?
 Mr. LUGAR. I am happy to do that.
 Mr. DIXON. May I say to the distin-
 guished manager I think he knows my
 record on this issue. I am one on this
 side  who  has  regularly  supported
 Contra assistance, as recently as the
 last time a rollcall took place, and I
 want  my distinguished friend,   the
 chairman of the Foreign Relations
 Committee and the distinguished man-
 ager of this bill, to know that I am
 prepared once again to support the
 proposition that will be offered short-
 ly by the distinguished manager and
 the distinguished Senator from Geor-
 gia, so that he understands the-mean-
 ing in which the question is asked.
 But I am prepared to support this
 proposition by my distinguished friend
 from Delaware as well, and I wonder
 whether the manager has thought in
 terms and whether others on his side
 have thought in terms of the accept-
 ability of this whole question in the
 other Chamber.
 (Mr. RUDMAN assumed the chair.)
 After all, this proposition has to pass
 two Houses to have any meaningful
 result. I would point out to the Sena-
 tor that- my friend, the distinguished
 Senator from Delaware, maintains the
 prohibition against support of military
 or paramilitary operations while my
 distinguished friend, the manager of
 this bill, strikes that provision. My dis-
 tinguished  friend  from  Delaware
 would funnel the aid through the
 State Department, while the other
 proposition would provide for the CIA
 to distribute the funds and the Nation-
 al Security Council to exercise over-
 sight.
 I wonder whether my friend sees
 that there is some broader appeal, if
 we really want to do something in this
 area, as this Senator does, in the other
 Chamber for what my distinguished
 friend from Delaware is trying to do.
 That must be readily apparent to my
 friend.
 Mr. LUGAR. I appreciate the ques-
 tion, as well as the observation by my
 friend from Illinois.
 I think these aspects of Senator
 BIDEN's amendment would be more ap-
 pealing in the House of Representa-
 tives to the extent that this is the au-
 dience that we are looking for and con-
 ceivably might find it. I am not certain
 that is so, but it might be.
 I would say- the National Security
 Council oversight of whatever agency
 is involved-and the Senator from Illi-
 nois assumes it would be the CIA in
 our bill, and we assume that it would
 be, too-would continue as it is and I
 would also assume that we-would not
 rule out paramilitary, as the Senator
 from Illinois has suggested. He may
 not want to do that and many Mem-
 bers of the House may not want to do
 that.
 I think it is foolish on our part to ar-.
 bitrarily rule out those options, even if
 we are trying to appeal to the Mem-
 bers of the House of Representatives.
 But I think those are two distinctions
 between the bills.
 I have not tried to nitpick and find
 each and every one of these situations.
 But the Senator from Illinois has per-
 formed a useful service by pointing
 out two small ways, albeit very small
 ones, in which the bills differ, which
 leads me back to my point that what-
 ever merit the Biden legislation has, in
 my judgment it is less at prospect than
 the Nunn-Lugar amendment that will
 be heard next. Therefore, it ought to
 be rejected so that the way is still
 clear for a statement that will come on
 the fifth amendment to be considered
 today.
 Mr. DIXON. Will my friends yield
 just one more time?
 Mr. LUGAR. I am happy to do so.
 Mr. DIXON. I am prepared to go
 through this with my friend from In-
 diana and, as I say, I am prepared to
 support the proposition that will be
 offered shortly by the distinguished
 manager of the bill. But I wonder how
 many times we have to march up the
 mountain and back down before we ul-
 timately realize that the perception of
 this issue is different in the Senate
 than in the House.
 I wonder whether there would be
 more appeal if we realistically tried to
 recognize that there are some sharp
 differences that probably cannot be
 reconciled and that there is more
 probability of reasonable acceptance
 by the House of slightly more moder-
 ate Senate proposition-I? am prepared
 to vote for the Senator's proposition-
 but a more moderate proposition than
 my distinguished friend from Indiana
 wants to offer right now might help to
 bridge the gap.
 Mr. LUGAR. Let me respond that in
 the pleasant event we get to a confer-
 ence with our colleagues in the House
 and the Nunn-Lugar amendment, at
 least, is part of that conference on the
 State   Department   authorization,
 whatever else is in the context. I will
 keep firmly in mind the footnote that
 my distinguished friend'was prepared
 to vote for both propositions and gave
 some good advice as to how we might
 find comity with our colleagues. But I
 think there is another factor that even
 as we are seeking comity with our col-
 leagues in the House, at least this Sen-
 ator-and perhaps most of us, I would
 hope-is also trying to retain some ties
 with the administration. The adminis-
 tration is a major factor in our foreign
 policy, some would argue the major
 factor with the proper oversight con-
 trol of this body. So there are several
 layers in the drama. Some are congres-
 sional and some are outside, but also
 important to it.
 I would plead with the Senator that
 many of us have been trying to work
 with the White House, with the De-
 partment of State, and, in addition,
 working with our colleagues on both
 sides of the Capitol. We may or may
 not be successful in the exercise, but it
 will not be for the lack of trying.
 S 7623
 These are some of the conditions that
 have brought me to, at least, the con-
 clusions I have in the next amend-
 ment.
 Mr. DIXON. May I say to my friend
 that I thank him for his response. I
 will not take any more time. I know
 the time is precious for my distin-
 guished friend from Delaware.
 I say to my friend from Indiana that
 I hope when I support his amendment
 later today that that is not the propo-
 sition that once again closes the door
 and that we are not passing up a
 chance to adopt a proposition that
 might open it. That is the only point
 this Senator wanted to make to his
 friend and colleague, from Indiana.
 Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator.
 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous  consent  to  amend  my
 amendment  as  follows: In section
 602(a), after "1985" add "and again
 during fiscal year 1986."
 The      PRESIDING  OFFICER.   Is
 there objection? Without objection,
 the amendment is so modified.
 Mr. BIDEN. Very briefly, Mr. Presi-
 dent, this will have an effect of leaving
 approximately 1 year during which
 the Contras will have to evolve to a
 point where they can meet the higher
 standards set by the -amendment and
 for the other parties to, in fact, fulfill
 their portion of the responsibilities in
 the amendment.
 In response to the comment made by
 the. Senator from Indiana, our only
 difference in dollars is $28 million as
 opposed to $38 million.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will
 the Senator from Delaware please
 send the modification to the desk?
 Mr. BIDEN. Yes.
 The modification reads as follows:
 At the end of the.bill, add the following
 new title:

 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who
 yields time?
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President. I yield 5
 minutes to the distinguished Senator
 from Minnesota.
 Mr. DURENBERGER. Mr. Presi-
 dent, I will be brief and I may not take
 the 5 minutes. I regret that I was not
 here to listen to all of what I am sure
 was a most able argument on behalf of
 the amendment by our colleague from
 Delaware.
 My sense, however, is that the pro-
 posal by the Senator from Delaware
 appears on the surface to come much
 closer to the reality of a peaceful ne-
 gotiation through dialog, dialog on 'the
 part of the United States with the na-
 tional directorate in Nicaragua and a
 dialog among or between Nicaraguans.
 The problem that I see with it-and
 I wish to say to my. friend from Dela-
 ware that I do not pretend to have any
 greater expertise or any greater in-
 sight into the, solution of this issue
 than he has, but I come perhaps just a
 little bit fresher from having discussed
 all of these amendments with a lot of
 our friends in Central America. The
 point that I made this morning in the
 debate, and I think the Senator from
 Delaware recognizes this in his amend-
 ment, is that we sometimes make the
 mistake of seeing this problem vis-a-vis
 the national directorate, the Sandi-
 nista dictatorship in Nicaragua, as a
 U.S. national security issue. We have
 been deluged with the fact that this is
 the Soviets marching up from Nicara-,
 gua. We have been deluged with the
 fact that it is the start of refugees and
 the launch of,Soviet missiles into San
 Antonio and St. Paul and places like
 that. So we tend to look at it that way.

 June 6, 1985              CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.---SENATE
 The reality, however, is much closer
 to the fact that this is a Central Amer-
 ican problem. It is a Central American
 security problem. And the observa-
 tions of our friends, if you will, the
 other democracies or fledgling democ-
 racies in Central America is that they,
 in effect, have facilitated the replace-
 ment of one dictatorship in Nicaragua
 with another. It just happened to be
 nine more people in this one than in
 the other. But this dictatorship, being
 a dictatorship, having been launched
 from  the  ship  of  democracy  but
 having been captured by the pirates of
 the dictatorship, lives in fear of the
 democracies around it.
 But they cannot do anything about
 it. They have a 100,000-person army.
 They have their refugees spilling all
 over Central America. As I said this
 morning, they have been killing Salva-
 dorans for 5 years. Now they are start-
 ing to kill the Hondurans and Costa
 Ricans. There is not anything the
 Central Americans can do about it.
 They are participating in the Conta-
 dora process. They have some faith in
 that process but not a lot because at
 the last meeting of the Contadora the
 Sandinistas came to the meeting and
 they changed their minds about some
 of the rulings of the game. They came
 in with a couple of brand new. amend-
 ments that had not been on the table
 before. They did that same thing in
 the nine meetings with Shlaudeman
 and Tinoco. Every time they got close
 to some kind of a negotiation, Tinoco
 would show up on behalf of the na-
 tional directorate, and he had a new
 proposition to lay on the table. The
 bottom line, seen from the eyes of the
 Costa Ricans, the Salvadorans, Guate-
 malans, Hondurans, Panamanians, and
 others is that the United States must
 supply them with some additional
 pressure to be defined in some magic
 way I guess in this amendment that
 comes up next. There are a series of
 urgings in there that speak to that.
 But without that kind of pressure
 they know the Sandinistas will not ne-
 gotiate in good faith. As I read your
 amendment, as I listened to the argu-
 ment on behalf of the amendment of
 the Senator from Delaware--
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator's 5 minutes have expired.
 Mr. DURENBERGER. I ask unani-
 mous consent for another 1 minute.
 The problem with it is there is no in-
 centive for the Sandinistas to dialog.
 There is a presumption underlying the
 amendment that somehow they want
 to negotiate an end to this process.
 But I do not see in it any particular in-
 centive for them to concede. They may
 go dialog. They are very good at that.
 They will talk, talk, talk but there is
 no reason for them after a cease fire
 to  forever concede  anything in  a
 dialog. It is that our friends find objec-
 tionable.
 Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield
 for a question?
 Mr. DURENBERGER. Yes.
 Mr. BIDEN.Is the Senator aware
 that in fact it does not require dialog,
 that it requires there to be negotia-
 tions, and if the Sandinistas do not ne-
 gotiate, then section 2 and section 3
 are not operative? Then the same
 pressure that exists in the amendment
 of the Senator from Indiana. becomes
 operative. I know from working with
 the Senator in the Intelligence Com-
 mittee that he is aware that we need
 public support for a plan which is per-
 ceived by the public now to be over-
 whelmed, and in fact not accurately
 protrayed by the President.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 time allotted to the Senator from Min-
 nesota has expired.
 Mr. BIDEN. I guess I used up your
 time with a question. I, appreciate your
 courtesy. [Laughter.]
 Mr. DURENBERGER. I thank my
 colleague. I find him incorrect. But I
 thank him.
 Mr. LUGAR. I yield 1 minute to the
 Senator from Kansas.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Kansas.
 Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President,
 the  Senator  from  Minnesota  was
 touching on the question I had. It was
 the fact that this aid, the $14 million,
 would not be forthcoming. unless the
 President resumed bilateral negotia-
 tions with the Government of Nicara-
 gua. I think it is a mistake to insist
 that the President resume these nego-
 tiations. I think this does not really
 portray an accurate picture of the sit-
 uation. It reflects on a concern, I
 think, that the Senator from Delware
 has about focusing on bilateral negoti-
 ations, and second, my own concern
 about directing from here the Presi-
 dent to enter into bilateral negotia-
 tions. Otherwise, I find much attrac-
 tive in this, but I think this is a flaw
 that is troubling to me as it is present-
 ly drafted.
 Mr. BIDEN. If I may answer--
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 time allotted to the Senator from
 Kansas has expired.
 .Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, how
 much time remains?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each
 side has 2 minutes remaining.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will
 speak for 1 minute and yield 1 minute
 to the distinguished Senator from
 Tennessee.
 Mr. President, I ask that the Biden
 amendment be carefully considered
 but rejected by the Senate on the
 basis that the amendment that is to
 follow is a superior course for the rea-
 sons that I have suggested, and that
 others have suggested on our side. I
 say this with full appreciation for the
 intent of the amendment, with full ap-
 preciation that there are many paral-
 lel thoughts, and with full apprecia-
 tion of the thoughts of my friend from
 Illinois who has suggested there are
 many factors in the amendment that
 may be appealing to the House, and
 that which we will have to deal with in
 a practical way. But I am hopeful that
 S 7625
 the track will still be clear by the time
 we get to the Nunn- Lugar offering. I
 ask Senators to take that into consid-
 eration, and to vote against the cur-
 rent amendment.
 Mr. GORE. Mr. President,. despite
 the small sum of money involved, we
 all know that we are voting on a
 matter of great consequence. What we
 are really dealing with here is the
 question of the future course of Amer-
 ican policy in Central America.
 The President's policy objectives in
 respect to Nicaragua have continuous-
 ly shifted, but his preference as to
 means has inclined steadily toward the
 use of violence. In rejecting military
 aid to the  Contras,  Congress  has
 wisely chosen to block at least one
 such approach: continued and escalat-
 ing violence by proxy.
 There remain, however, many other
 gradations beginning with other forms
 of aid to the Contras, and extending
 up to the possibility of a U.S. military
 expedition into Nicaragua: an option
 the administration has never been
 willing to rule out, and which it has
 now begun to speak about in more
 concrete terms.
 The amendments that we are deal-
 ing with today offer us ways to more
 clearly define what parts of that re-
 maining spectrum of possibilities are
 open to the President, and which parts
 are-for the time being-to be closed
 off.
 Of these amendments, the only one
 that deals comprehensively with the
 elements of a U.S. policy for Nicara-
 gua, and the one which, in my opinion,
 comes closest to striking a balance ap-
 propriate to the needs of the moment,
 is the amendment offered by Senator
 BrDEN.
 The Biden amendment, in common
 with those offered by others, proposes
 to dispense humanitarian aid to the
 Contras. It does not, however, seek to
 use this aid as the means to induce the
 disarming and disbanding of the Con-
 tras, nor does it seek to use this aid in
 a manner which does as much as possi-
 ble to keep the Contras in fighting
 trim.
 Under  the  amendment,  any  aid
 would have to be independently moni-
 tored, to assure that the intentions of
 Congress-namely, that it be humani-
 tarian in character and no more-be
 respected.
 What the amendment fundamental-
 ly seeks to do with aid is to use it as a
 means for estabishing the kind of dip-
 lomatic process we should have had
 from the President, but have not.
 The conditions for aid to flow in-
 clude the resumption of bilateral talks
 between the administration and the
 Government. of Nicaragua, and the es-
 tablishment of a cease-fire to which
 the Contras must agree. Should the
 Sandinistas, on the other hand, refuse
 a cease-fire, aid would flow to the Con-
 tras.
 The  embargo  against  Nicaragua,
 which many of us feel the President

 S 7626                     CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 too hastily imposed after suffering
 defeat on military aid to the Contras,
 will clearly not shake the dominance
 of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. But
 under the approach in this amend-
 ment, our offer to suspend the embar-
 go  could  bring' about  Nicaraguan
 agreement to accept the prerequisites
 for serious diplomacy: a cease-fire;
 talks with the Contras; and an end to
 the state of national emergency.
 Mr.  President,  this is a delicate
 moment. The country, by and large,
 does not believe that the Sandinistas
 are prepared, 'if totally relieved of all
 pressures from the United States, to
 turn their energies inward and leave
 their neighbors alone. Neither is the
 country prepared to see a sharp esca-
 lation of military pressure against
 Nicaragua through the Contras, less
 alone by way of direct U.S. interven-
 tion.
 What  the  country  instinctively
 wants is what in fact we should be
 having, what the administration is re-
 fusing to provide, and what the Biden
 amendment is all about: a serious
 resort to statecraft and negotiations-
 with other options , in existence but
 under firm restraint, until we have ex-
 hausted other remedies.
 Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President,
 I rise to support the Biden amend-
 ment. This amendment would provide
 $14 million in humanitarian aid to the
 Contras this year and give incentives
 to both sides of the Nicaraguan con-
 flict to reach a negotiated settlement.
 To my mind, the Biden amendment
 represents the best approach at this
 point, to the situation in Nicaragua,
 one  which  encourages  negotiations
 and diplomacy over military conflict,
 while protecting our interests in the
 region.
 The situation in Central America is
 difficult and potentially dangerous.
 The United States has a real stake in
 what happens in that country. Daniel
 Ortega's visit to the Soviet Union to
 seek $200 million in economic aid only
 underscored the ties the Nicaraguan
 Government has to the Soviet Union.
 The Soviets would like to exploit re-
 gional unrest to increase their influ-
 ence in the area. But, Mr. President,
 the issue before us is not support for
 or opposition to communism in Nicara-
 gua. The issue is how best to protect
 our security interests in the region. I
 believe at this point in the conflict
 that that is best done by encouraging
 nonmilitary, negotiated solutions.
 Certainly we want to prevent Soviet
 or Cuban bases on Nicaraguan soil. We
 want to see all Cuban and Soviet mili-
 tary  advisers  leave  Nicaragua.  We
 want to secure a regional agreement in
 Central America that pledges that all
 of the countries in the region-espe-
 cially Nicaragua-refrain from inter-
 fering in the internal affairs of their
 neighbors and supporting an armed in-
 surrection in the region. And we have
 an interest in pressuring the Nicara-
 guans to make good on the democratic
 promises of their revolution.
 This amendment seeks to safeguard
 those interests by giving the parties to
 the conflict every incentive to seek
 peace.
 The Biden amendment would pro-
 vide $14 million in humanitarian as-
 sistance in fiscal year 1985 for 'the
 Contras to be funneled through the
 State Department. By installing the
 State Department as the agency ad-
 ministering the aid to the Contras, we
 remove the taint of CIA involvement
 in the region. At the same time, by
 continuing  the  Boland  amendment
 prohibition on military or paramili-
 tary aid to the Contras, we avoid, at
 least for now, resort to the military
 option.
 The conditions imposed on that aid
 under the Biden amendment in my
 view provide the impetus for a peace-
 ful solution to the conflict. To the
 Contras, we say, "Lay down your arms
 and negotiate." To the Nicaraguans,
 we say: "Make good on your promises.
 Stop exporting your revolution and es-
 tablish human and civil rights within
 your country."
 In order to receive humanitarian aid,
 the Contras must agree to a cease fire,
 and to negotiations with the Nicara-
 guan Government. And because U.S.
 assistance to the Contras can be justi-
 fied and effective only if such opposi-
 tion truly represents democratic and
 humanitarian values, we will provide
 further aid to the Contras only if they
 first purge from their ranks those re-
 sponsible for the abuse of human
 rights.
 This approach also provides incen-
 tives to the Nicaraguan Government
 to negotiate with the Contras. If that
 Government agrees to a cease fire and
 to negotiations with the Contras, we
 will  lift  the  trade  embargo.  The
 amendment also expresses the sense of
 Congress that the President should
 order a suspension of U.S. military ma-
 neuvers in Honduras and off the Nica-
 ragua coast if Nicaragua agrees to the
 cease fire and negotiations above, and
 suspends the state of emergency.
 Finally,  the  amendment  requires
 that the humanitarian aid can only be
 provided if this country sits down with
 the Nicaraguan Government and nego-
 tiates.
 The approach represented by this
 amendment is one that will keep eco-
 nomic and diplomatic pressure on the
 Sandinista government and on the
 Contras to reach a negotiated solution.
 And by continuing aid to the Contra
 resistance, it keeps the pressure on the
 Nicaraguan Government, and thereby
 decreases 'Nicaragua's ability to inter-
 fere in the affairs of others.
 This amendment only applies until
 the end of this fiscal year, giving us
 needed flexibility in a fluid situation.
 It leaves the door open for a new look
 at the situation in 4 months. If, at
 that time, no progress has been made
 in reaching a settlement, or Nicaragua
 continues going down an undesirable
 path, then we can reconsider our ap-
 proach. In the meantime, we can use
 June 6, 1985
 our aid to pressure the parties to the
 conflict and make clear our dissatisfac-
 tion with the policies of the Sandinista
 government.
 By continuing the Boland amend-
 ment prohibition on military or para-
 military aid to the Contras, we avoid
 at least for now, resort to the military
 option. And by installing the State De-
 partment as the agency administering
 the aid to the Contras, we remove the
 taint  of  CIA  involvement  in  the
 region.
 I believe that the Biden amendment
 represents a balanced and thoughtful
 framework for seeking. peace in the
 region. We provide all of the carrots
 and sticks at our disposal to the chief
 adversaries in the conflict. We give the
 diplomatic process every chance, to
 work in Central America before we are
 faced with a situation in which no
 other option but the military one is
 possible. I urge my colleagues to sup-
 port this amendment.
 Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Delaware.
 Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous con-
 sent that Senator Cohen be added as a
 cosponsor
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out objection, it is so ordered. .
 Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as the
 Senator from Indiana has very forth-
 rightly stated, there are a lot of simi-
 larities between our two amendments.
 There are two big differences. No. 1, in
 his amendment.he urges the adminis-
 tration to negotiate. I ask them to
 demonstrate. they have attempted to
 negotiate, a distinction with a slight
 difference but more political than a
 factual difference. -
 Second, Mr. President, I argue that
 the only real difference here is that
 we attempt in this amendment to, if
 you will, purge the Contras of those
 who are the unsavory elements in it. It
 makes sense to support the Contras if
 they are truly the democratic force. If
 they turn out not to be, it makes no
 sense. There is the real difference be-
 tween the two amendments along with
 the difference in the Boland amend-
 ment. To my friend from Kansas, I say
 that in fact I do not think they should
 worry so much about the section 2. We
 are not demanding the President in
 fact negotiate. We are demanding that
 he attempt to resume bilateral negoti-
 ations, and if. they do not come for-
 ward, that would be the end of it.
 Mr. President, I really think this is a,
 critically-obviously, we all do-impor-
 tant issue. I think it is important to
 acknowledge the legitimacy of sup-
 porting legitimate opposition forces to
 dictatorships   around   the   world,
 whether they be Communist or totali-
 tarian of another stripe. I think this
 does it. I think it does it the best we
 can from this body which is imperfect.
 I urge the adoption of my amendment.

 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would
 like to offer a correction. On page 3,
 item 3 of the Nunn-Lugar amendment,
 we call upon the Nicaraguan demo-
 cratic resistance to remove from their
 ranks any individuals who engage in
 human rights abuses. I would suggest
 there is a purging element in fact in
 our amendment. I want to make that
 clear so that the parallel significance
 is clear. I yield back the remainder of

 NOT VOTING-3
 Pressler         Rockefeller      wallop
 So the amendment (No. 274), as
 modified, was rejected!
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I move
 to reconsider the vote by which the
 amendment was rejected.
 Mr. DOLE.  I move to lay that
 motion on the table.
 The motion to lay on the table was
 agreed to.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 majority leader is recognized.
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, a number
 of Senators have made inquiries about
 the program for the remainder of the
 evening. I do not really see how we are
 going to finish this bill this evening, so
 it would appear at this moment we are
 going to be on it tomorrow. But that
 will depend on what .might develop in
 the next 2 to 3 hours. We are now
 about to take up what I consider the
 principal  amendment,  a  bipartisan
 effort to do something in this area,
 that I hope will pass. Following that,
 there are four other amendments that
 I would just as soon not be brought up
 at all, including one of mine.
 There is still  31/2  or 4 hours on
 amendments on the Contras. We have
 had votes of 70-something to 15, 80-
 something to 15, or whatever. So I
 think there is a fairly clear expression
 on almost every conceivable pattern of
 amendments, and I would hope that,
 after disposition of this amendment,
 the others would just sort of go away,
 if that is possible. If not, we are going
 to sort of go away because I do not
 think we ought to keep people in until
 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning if we
 cannot finish the bill. I know the
 chairman would very much like to
 finish the bill, but in addition to the
 Contra  amendments  there  are  40
 other amendments.. A number of those
 would be accepted, but there would
 still be probably three or four rollcalls,
 plus debate on those amendments. So
 I think it is fairly clear that we are
 looking at midnight or after.
 That is an optimistic assumption. So
 I would guess, after the vote on the
 principal amendment, we might be in
 a position to make an announcement
 so that Members who have obligations
 this evening would know what to do.
 Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Indiana.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will
 argue in favor of an amendment that
 has been proposed and will be intro-
 duced--
 Mr. STENNIS. Mr.. President, may
 we have quiet? We cannot hear back
 here.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Mississippi is correct.
 The Senate is not in order. The Sena:-
 tor  will  please  suspend  until  the
 Senate is in order.
 The Chair will remind the Senator
 from Indiana that under the previous
 order, the Senator from Georgia [Mr.
 NUNN] was supposed to be recognized.
 The Senator did not seek recognition.
 S 7627
 Mr. NUNN. I will yield to my col-
 league from Indiana. We are coauth-
 ors of the amendment. We are working
 for the same purposes.
 How is the time allocated, Mr. Presi-
 dent?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 time is equally divided between the
 Senator from Georgia and the Senator
 from Indiana.
 Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, is the
 time  divided  between  the  Senator
 from Georgia and the Senator from
 Indiana 45 minutes each?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator is correct.
 Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, we are on
 the same side on the amendment, and
 in all fairness I know there are going
 to be opponents of this amendment.
 So I think we are going to have to find
 some way to equitably divide the time.
 Of course, this is in our favor. But I
 know there will be Senators who will
 want to speak on the other side of this
 amendment.
 Mr. LUGAR. If the Senator from
 Georgia  will  yield  for  just  a
 moment-
 Mr. NUNN. I yield.
 Mr. LUGAR. My purpose in seeking
 recognition is to say that in all fair-
 ness, it would be wise if the Chair
 would allocate 45 minutes in opposi-
 tion to my distinguished colleague
 from Rhode Island [Mr. PELL) so that
 he might manage the 45 minutes in
 opposition, and there will remain 45
 minutes for the proponents. At this
 time I yield the floor to my distin-
 guished colleague from Georgia [Mr.
 NUNN].
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does
 the Chair understand the Senator
 from Indiana that the 45 minutes is to
 be under the joint control of the Sena-
 tor from Indiana and the Senator
 from Georgia and 45 minutes under
 the control of the Senator from Rhode
 Island?
 Mr. LUGAR. That is my proposal.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  Is
 there objection?
 Mr. NUNN. There will be no objec-
 tion.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 Will  the  Senator  from  Georgia
 please send the amendment to the
 desk.
 AMENDMENT NO. 275
 Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I sent an
 amendment to the desk and ask for its
 immediate consideration.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 amendment will be stated.
 The bill clerk read as follows:

 Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I do not
 know how we are going to allocate the
 time. We are going to have a number
 of speakers. But I ask that the Chair
 to notify me in 5 minutes. I may have
 to take a few more minutes beyond
 that, but I would like to take 5 min-
 utes, if that is satisfactory to my col-
 league from Indiana.
 Mr. President, this amendment is co-
 ,sponsored by myself as well as Senator
 BENTSEN,   Senator   BOREN,  Senator
 JOHNSTON,  Senator  CHILES,  Senator
 LUGAR,  Senator  DECONCINI,  Senator
 DURENBERGER,  Senator  NICKLES,  and
 Senator DOLE. The amendment would
 provide humanitarian   assistance to
 the democratic resistance in Nicara-
 gua.
 Everyone in this Chamber is well
 aware of the recent debate as to
 whether   humanitarian    assistance
 should be provided to the democratic
 resistance in Nicaragua. The adminis-
 tration proposal, which was very simi-
 lar to this-it was not similar in legis-
 lative form but similar to the Presi-
 dent's later commitment was a strange
 legislative  vote,  but I  think most
 people understood the intent-passed
 the Senate by a narrow vote, 53 to 46,
 but failed in the House.
 Shortly after the Senate vote, Sena-
 tors BENTSEN, JOHNSTON, BOREN, and I
 introduced a resolution; Senate Joint
 Resolution 129, which would have re-
 leased the $14 million fenced last year
 but limited use of those funds only for
 humanitarian assistance.
 Since then, we have revised this
 amendment in some substantive areas,
 but the thrust of it has not changed in
 appreciable ways.
 The amendment we are introducing
 today would unfence the $14 million
 and authorize an additional $24 mil-
 lion of humanitarian assistance for
 fiscal year 1986. It provides that the
 money is to be expended by the Presi-
 dent only for humanitarian assistance
 to the. Nicaraguan democratic resist-
 ance and that the National Security
 Council is to supervise the expenditure
 of the money.
 In listening to the debate on the
 floor, I was struck by the fact that
 most Senators seem to agree on what
 our policy objectives in Central Amer-
 ica should be. Nobody believes that
 the Sandinistas are acting in accord-
 ance with the commitments they made
 to the OAS or commitments they
 made to their own revolution.
 The purpose of this amendment is to
 help develop a sustainable policy that
 can enjoy the support of the Congress
 and the American people. A number of
 other Members of Congress have made
 similar  suggestions.  Regretfully  no
 such compromise was reached during
 the last debate, and, as a result, our
 policy toward Central America re-
 mains in disarray.
 All Senators seemed to agree that we
 should support democracy in Nicara-
 gua and the rest of Central America,
 that Nicaragua cannot become a base

 for the Soviet Union or Cuba or their
 surrogates, that the Sandinistas must
 not threaten or subvert their neigh-
 bors, and that they should live up to
 the promises they made to the OAS in
 1979 to adopt a pluralistic, representa-
 tive government. Those are the goals
 that I believe most people in this body
 would agree with.
 The problem is how we should ac-
 complish  these objectives.  That is
 where the failure has been. The ad-
 ministration has yet to produce a
 policy which enjoys sufficient support
 of the American people and the Con-
 gress to make it sustainable.
 We might adopt something stronger
 than this amendment in this Chamber
 today, but I believe it would be coun-
 terproductive, because it would set in
 motion a counterreaction in the House
 and it would solidify opposition. Even
 if it were to go through the House and
 the Senate, it would not send the in-
 dispensable signal that must be sent if
 our policy has any chance of succeed-
 ing in Central America, and that is a
 signal that we are going to have
 enough support on both sides of the
 aisle to continue a policy, for whatever
 time is necessary, to accomplish our
 goals and objectives.
 That is the heart of what we are
 trying to do here. We can argue about
 the definition of humanitarian aid,
 but we are trying to get enough of a
 consensus on both sides of the aisle so
 that we send that indispensable mes-
 sage, that we are not going to be down
 there for 6 months, 1 year, or. 2 years.
 We do not have Lebanon-type provi-
 sions in this amendment. There are no
 time limits. We are going to continue
 this kind of -policy as long as necessary
 to accomplish our goals. If that mes-
 sage goes out of this Chamber with
 the vote today, then, in my opinion,
 the amendment will have been a suc-
 cess. The policy itself may take a long
 time.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
 ARMSTRONG). The Senator has used 5
 minutes.
 Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask that
 I be notified in 5 minutes, and I will
 try to accelerate my comments.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Chair will notify the Senator.
 Mr. NUNN. Furthermore, in the
 public's eyes U.S. policy has become
 unjustly, and most inaccurately re-
 duced to the issue' of aid to the Con-
 tras. There is plenty of blame to go
 around for this-to the administration
 for inappropriate activities undertak-
 en by the CIA, and the lack of a coher-
 ent Nicaraguan policy framework in
 which to place the Contra program,
 and to Congress for its inadequate
 oversight of the problem as well as its
 repeated, protracted, divisive debates
 which have served little to clarify the
 larger Central American issues in-
 volved.
 This amendment is intended to be
 the first step in rectifying this situa-
 tion. By providing aid we are affirming
 our support of those who stand for
 freedom and democracy in Central
 America. But by providing humanitari-
 an aid we are also signalling our will-
 ingness to support nonmilitary means
 of achieving peace and democracy in
 the region. In El Salvador, we have
 supported President Duarte's efforts
 at dialogue with the rebels; we should
 do no less in Nicaragua, nor should we
 expect less of the Sandinistas than
 that they talk to the armed opposi-
 tion.
 By providing now funding for hu-
 manitarian assistance in 1985 and 1986
 we resolve, for a crucial period of time,
 the issue of what, if any, aid to give
 the Contras. With this basic aspect of
 our policy decided, the administration
 will have time free from legislative
 battles in which to reshape and re-
 structure our complete Nicaraguan
 policy as it fits into our policy frame-
 work for the region. This is vital work.
 It must be done.
 It must be clear to one and all at
 home and abroad that aid to the Con-
 tras is only part of a region wide strat-
 egy to deal with the challenges we
 face.  -
 No one should have any doubt about
 those challenges. We face a struggle
 between brave men and women fight-
 ing for democracy and a better life on
 one side and, on the other side, the en-
 emies of freedom both of the left and
 right. And no one should have any
 doubt about where America stands in
 that conflict. We must stand with the
 forces of democracy.
 We have stood with the democratic
 center in El Salvador, we have sup-
 ported the delicate transition to demo-
 cratic government in Guatemala, Hon-
 duras and Panama, and we must stand
 with the democratic resistance in Nica-
 ragua. There has been much rhetoric
 about the Contras. The President has
 suggested that they are just like our
 Founding  Fathers.  Others  regard
 them as right wing terrorists..I believe
 the President overstates the case, but
 the facts are that genuine democrats,
 men like Arturo Cruz, who were im-
 prisoned by Somoza and were early
 supporters of the Sandinistas, now be-
 lieve that the Contras offer the true
 path of democracy. Because men like
 Cruz are the leaders of the Contras, it
 is our obligation to help them.
 Many believe that we should never
 have begun providing assistance to the
 Contras, that the Sandinistas are a le-
 gitimate  revolution,  and  that  the
 United States should not intervene in
 the internal affairs of another coun-.
 try. Regardless of how one feels about
 the initial decision to support the Con-
 tras, the fact is that we did. Regard-
 less of how one feels about the legiti-
 macy of the Sandinista revolution-
 and, like a lot of other Americans, I
 applauded the overthiow of Somoza-
 the facts are that the Sandinistas have
 betrayed their revolution. Regardless
 of how one feels about U.S. interven-
 tion; the facts are that the Sandinistas
 are actively supporting subversion of
 their neighbors. And, the facts are
 S 7629
 that the Contras began as a small
 group of Nicaraguans and grew as
 other Nicaraguans became increasing-
 ly disenchanted with the Sandinistas.
 I am convinced that they would have
 grown with or without our aid.
 Moreover, it is clear that the Con-
 tras have been able to generate pres-
 sure on the Sandinistas and the Sandi-
 nistas would very much like to termi-
 nate any aid to them. In my judgment,
 we must design a policy that continues
 pressure on the Sandinistas but moves
 American promotion of military action
 to the back burner.
 Our policy must also avoid the "Leb-
 anon syndrome" in which the Presi-
 dent and Congress establish arbitrary
 and unrealistic time limits to complex
 foreign policy, goals.
 The American people must believe
 that all avenues of diplomatic, eco-
 nomic,  and political pressure  have
 been exhausted if there is to be any
 lasting support for military related op-
 tions. That is not the case today.
 Right or wrong, the American people
 perceive  that  the  military option
 through the Contras has been on the
 front burner and is, the President's
 course of first resort.
 The.challenge, I believe, is to move
 forward with political, diplomatic, and
 economic pressure, and continue the
 possibility of military pressure itself.
 The proposal we are offering today
 would achieve these objectives.
 Let me explain the principal ele-
 ments of this amendment.
 First, it authorizes $24 million for
 fiscal year 1986 and unfences the $14
 million from last year, but provides
 that those funds may be only used by
 the President for humanitarian assist-
 ance which is defined as food, cloth-
 ing, medicine, other humanitarian .as-
 sistance, and transportation. It does
 not include any weapons, weapons sys-
 tems, or ammunition. Because we be-
 lieve that it is important that the
 democratic  resistance  be  able    to
 defend itself, the amendment specifi-
 cally does not preclude the provision
 of  intelligence  information  to  the
 democratic resistance or the collection
 of necesary intelligence by the United
 States. In making these funds avail-
 able,  the  amendment                                                                                                      repeals  the
 Boland amendment, but, as I will ex-
 plain more fully below, does so in a
 way that no further assistance may be
 provided to the Contras unless Con-
 gress specifically authorizes.
 The amendment provides that the
 President is to administer the assist-
 ance and that the NSC is to monitor
 the program. I recognize that many
 Senators believe that aid should be ad-
 ministered by the Agency for Interna-
 tional Development or the State De-
 partment. They do not want the CIA
 involved. I understand their concerns,
 particularly as the CIA has not. han-
 dled this project well in the past. How-
 ever, I believe that the United States
 should use our assistance for.the Con-
 tras as a lever to assist in fostering a

 regional solution to: the conflict. Ac-
 cordingly, I believe that the maximum
 flexibility should be given to the Presi-
 dent to administer this assistance. The
 President must make a detailed report
 to the Congress every 90 days and, if
 he chooses to have the CIA involved, I
 can assure him that Congress will be
 watching very closely. I know I cer-
 tainly will be.
 Second. It urges the President to vig-
 orously pursue diplomatic and eco-
 nomic measures,  including negotia-
 tions, to implement the Contadora ob-
 jectives, and to develop, in close coop-
 eration with our allies, trade and eco-
 nomic measures to pressure the Gov-
 ernment of Nicaragua. The President
 is also urged to suspend the economic
 sanctions he imposed on May 1 and to
 suspend military maneuvers in Hondu-
 ras and off Nicaragua's coast if the
 Government of Nicaragua agrees to a
 ceasefire, opens a dialog with the
 democratic resistance, and suspends
 the state of emergency.
 Mr. President, our amendment urges
 the President to suspend the economic
 sanctions if the Sandinistas take the
 steps I mentioned, because we think
 he made a serious error in imposing
 them unilaterally and without any at-
 tempt to use them as a lever in the ne-
 gotiations. When a number of Mem-
 bers of Congress, including Senator
 BENTSEN  and I, called for economic
 and trade sanctions, we urged that
 they be done in concert with our
 allies-not unilaterally. We also ex-
 pected that the President would use
 the prospect of sanctions as a lever to
 persuade the Sandinistas to negotiate
 seriously in the Contadora process.
 But the President did not do that. On
 the eve of departing for Europe, the
 President hastily imposed the sanc-
 tions. There was, so far as I know,
 little or no consultation with our
 allies. It should be no surprise, then,
 that only El Salvador has come out in
 support of the sanctions. What is
 worse, some of our best friends in the
 region and in Europe have condemned
 the sanctions and said that they would
 offset the sanctions by increased trade
 with Nicaragua. The Sandinistas have
 been having a propaganda -field day,
 exploiting the lack of support for the
 sanctions and blaming them as the
 cause of the serious shortages of food
 and other necessities that, in fact,
 have been caused by their own inept-
 ness and adherence to the Marxist/
 Leninist  economic  theories.  Some
 sanctions.
 Third, the President is also urged to
 call upon the democratic resistance to
 remove from its ranks any individuals
 who have engaged in human rights
 abuses, and the President is urged to
 resume the bilateral discussions be-
 tween the United States and the Gov-
 ernment of Nicaragua.
 Fourth, the President is required to
 report to Congress every 90 days and,
 fifth, the amendment prohibits any
 further aid from any U.S. Government
 source unless the President requests
 such assistance' from Congress and
 Congress votes to approve. In order to
 request this additional aid, the Presi-
 dent must determine that negotiations
 based on the Contadora principles or
 the other economic and diplomatic
 steps have failed to resolve 'the con-
 flict. Expedited procedures are set out
 for the consideration of that request.
 As I mentioned, our amendment re-
 peals the Boland .amendment; but I be-
 lieve the approach we are suggesting is
 preferable to that taken by the Boland
 amendment, which prohibited any as-
 sistance,  directly  or  indirectly,  to
 groups engaged in military or para-
 military  operations  in     Nicaragua.
 Those  who wish to preserve the
 Boland amendment have suggested
 that we could enact a provision giving
 humanitarian aid to the Contras "not-
 withstanding any other law." The
 problem with that formulation is that
 it left it up to the administration to
 decide what assistance was humanitar-
 ian and thus could be provided, and
 what aid assisted directly or .indirectly
 military or paramilitary operations in
 Nicaragua and thus could not be pro-
 vided. That approach would have cre-
 ated a vast gray area in which no one
 could be certain what could be provid-
 ed and what could not be. Our ap-
 proach is much more direct. It permits
 humanitarian  aid  to  be  provided,
 strictly defines humanitarian assist-
 ance, and prohibits any further aid
 from any U.S. Government agency
 unless the President specifically re-
 quests it from Congress and we vote
 our approval. Thus, there could be no
 further military assistance, overt or
 covert, by the CIA or State or AID or
 .anyone, unless Congress specifically
 approves. This addresses the concerns
 which led many Senators to support
 the Boland amendment, but permits
 humanitarian aid to be provided with-
 out ambiguity and makes it clear that
 no further assistance can be provided
 without specific approval by Congress.
 Mr. President, this amendment sets
 forth  the  humanitarian  assistance
 that may be- provided to the Nicara,
 guar democratic resistance. By that
 term we mean those Nicaraguans who
 have taken up arms against the Sandi-
 nistas and are engaged in armed resist-
 ance.
 This amendment incorporates ele-
 ments from the major proposals that
 were considered recently,  including
 the resolution favored by the adminis-
 tration, the one advanced by Senator
 BYRD on behalf of several Democrats,
 and the recommended -economic sanc-
 tions suggested by Senator BENTSEN
 and myself. Finally, it does not include
 the language of Senate Joint Resolu-
 tion 106-to which many Senators ob-
 jected-that would have .authorized
 supporting, directly or indirectly, mili-
 tary                                                   or paramilitary  operations In
 Nicaragua. Indeed, it makes it very
 clear that only humanitarian assist-
 ance may be provided unless Congress
 gives further authorization.
 June 6, 198
 I hope, therefore, that this amend-
 ment will enjoy broad bipartisan sup-
 port.
 This approach is . a regional ap-
 proach. All parties are required to do
 certain things. The Sandinistas are re-
 quired to do only what they have al-
 ready promised to do.. The democratic
 resistance is obligated to' insure that it
 is a truly democratic movement by
 purging from its pranks individuals who
 are  responsible  for  human  rights
 abuses.  The  United  States  must
 pursue bilateral negotiations with the
 Sandinistas and be prepared to sus-
 pend maneuvers if the Sandinistas
 take the steps that I have mentioned.
 This approach calls the Sandinistas'
 hand. They say they are democratic. I
 say 'OK, let them prove it. This hu-
 manitarian aid will sustain the demo-
 cratic resistance; it will keep the flame
 of liberty and hope alive.
 Moreover, humanitarian aid instead
 of military aid should facilitate negoti-
 ations both within the  Contadora
 framework and between the United
 States and the Sandinistas. Changing
 the nature of renewed U.S. Govern-
 ment assistance to the Contras will
 also serve to emphasize our new ap-
 proach, characterized by our deter-
 mined interest in a negotiated settle-
 ment. Finally, it permits the aid to be
 used as a lever to pursue our objec-
 tives.
 This amendment puts military aid in
 the background but leaves the military
 option open. If the President con-
 cludes that the economic and diplo-
 matic paths have failed, he may come
 back to Congress and request addition-
 al assistance. If he has made a good
 faith effort to exhaust these courses
 and if the Sandinistas {lo not modify
 their behavior, then the President's
 request for additional assistance will
 meet a very different reception in the
 Congress.  '
 Mr. President, this amendment is de-
 sighed to develop a longterm course,
 one that can enjoy broad bipartisan
 support and provide the President the
 basis to conduct a coherent, sustain-
 able foreign policy. I urge my col-
 leagues to support it.
 Mr. President, for the purpose of
 clarity I shall read the cosponsors

 ? Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am
 disappointed, frankly, with all of the
 proposals offered so far which concern
 U.S. policy toward Nicaragua. Some
 suffer from a tendency to treat the
 Sandinistas and the interests of the
 United States naively while others
 would make ineffective or inappropri-
 ate policy.

 June 6, 1985              CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 Let there be no doubt, the United
 States has reason to be concerned
 about Nicaragua because American in-
 terest`s are involved, but this doesn't
 mean that we must actively seek the
 overthrow of the Sandinista regime or
 support the Contras just enough to
 keep up the killing without a hope of
 success. In my estimation, it is not
 clear at this time that we can't reach
 an acceptable accord with the Sandi-
 nistas that sets the groundwork for
 peace and stability in the region. The
 administration, which has tried fund-
 ing the anti-Sandinista revolutionaries
 and unsuccessfully sought the over-
 throw of the Sandinista regime, has
 not taken the opportunity presented
 by this pressure to strike a bargain for
 peace.
 I urge the administration and my
 colleagues to consider the options that
 are available to us in a sober and ob-
 jective fashion.-These options, which I
 will discuss briefly, include continued
 use of various means to gain intelli-
 gence and show American resolve, eco-
 nomic pressure, aid to the Contras,
 and diplomacy.
 Our understanding of the challenges
 posed for us in Nicaragua derives from
 intelligence gathering-and we must
 have the very best. We need to know if
 and when the Sandinistas ship arms to-
 rebels in neighboring states. We need
 to know what the Soviets and Cubans
 are up to. We need to know all we can
 about Nicaraguan military policies,
 arms acquisitions, base construction,
 and activities that might lead to offer-
 ing the Soviets or Cubans base privi-
 leges. Our efforts in this regard, with
 the exception of some needlessly pro-
 vocative actions on several occasions,
 have been appropriate, indeed, Impera-
 tive.
 In addition, the United States has
 been right to show its resolve-so long
 as there is a serious problem-through
 a military presence in the region. This
 presence serves notice to the Sandinis-
 tas, Soviets, and Cubans that under-
 mining peace in Central America or
 the Caribbean will not be tolerated.
 We need not, as some have suggested
 here today, stipulate in legislation
 what  might  constitute  sufficient
 reason to intervene with those forces.
 I believe existing law which checks
 Presidential war powers is sufficient.
 Carefully defining what would consti-
 tute reason to intervene would simply
 suggest to those who might exploit
 the situation what 'they could get
 away with.
 At the urging of some of my col-
 leagues in the Senate a month and a
 half ago, the President embargoed
 trade with Nicaragua. Instead of being
 a response to particular Nicaraguan
 behavior, it was timed to serve as a
 substitute for aid to the Contras fol-
 lowing the defeat of aid in the House.
 It appeared to be a weak, second-
 choice means to show American re-
 solve. Not only was. the timing poor,
 but my guess is that it will be counter-
 productive The embargo will largely,
 if not entirely, be offset by the trade
 from other countries and will assist
 the Sandinistas in blaming the prob-
 lems in Nicaragua on us. It might very
 well strengthen Ortega's popular sup-
 port. But now that we have taken this
 step, in spite of these shortcomings,
 we should see it as a flexible instru-
 ment to be reconsidered in light of
 Sandinista behavior.
 The effects of the embargo are simi-
 lar to those of funding the Contras.
 That aid backfired in two ways. First,
 it bolstered the Sandinista's fallacious
 assertion that the rebels were nothing
 more than ex-members of the Samo-
 zan national guard funded by the
 United States, and thus it lent support
 to the Sandinista's claim to embody
 Nicaraguan  nationalism.  Second,  it
 gave them an excuse to continue their
 military buildup.
 The difficult conditions in Nicara-
 gua, sharpened by the pressure exert-
 ed by the administration, have not
 been fully exploited in the peace proc-
 ess. The depressed economy, anarchy
 in parts of the countryside, and a gen-
 eral- sense of national insecurity in
 Nicaragua afford us an opportunity, it
 seems to me, to make a serious at-
 tempt to drive an acceptable bargain.
 Unfortunately, I just don't see evi-
 dence of that kind of effort by the ad-
 ministration. We need to take greater
 initiatives  within  the  Contadora
 framework and, at the first instance of
 good faith exhibited by the Sandinis-
 tas, restart bilateral talks. That course
 of action, however, should not be man-
 dated by the Congress because such a
 mandate  will  reduce  to  zero  the
 chance of gaining any change in San-
 dinista policies in return.
 Mr. President, let me summarize and
 conclude briefly. We should maintain
 our presence and surveillance in the
 region. We should use the embargo
 flexibly  in  response  to  Sandinista
 policy. And, above all, we should spare
 no effort in exhausting diplomatic ave-
 nues toward a regional peace agree-
 ment. Before we seek to overthrow a
 foreign government, we should fully
 explore the alternatives. The policy I
 have outlined above-needs a chance to
 prove its viability. If it proves unsuc-?
 cessful, then a reassessment will cer-
 tainly be necessary.?
 Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, will the

 imous consent request?
 Mr. LUGAR. I yield.
 Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that Senator ExoN
 of Nebraska be added as a cosponsor.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask

 GOLDWATER  be . a cosponsor of the
 amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out.objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Rhode Island
 has indicated that he will have an
 opening statement. Notwithstanding
 S 7631
 that, if I may ask the indulgence of
 the Senator, so Senator BENTSEN may
 speak at this point for our side, we will
 appreciate it.
 I yield 7 minutes to the distin-
 guished Senator from Texas.
 Mr.  BENTSEN.  Mr.  President,  I
 thank the distinguished Senator from
 Indiana.
 Mr. President, in a bipartisan 53 to
 46 majority, we voted to release $14
 million in funds for the Contras that
 were included in the continuing reso-
 lution for fiscal year 1985. Unfortu-
 nately, that proposal, did not become
 law, and that is one reason we are dis-
 cussing the issue once again.
 I realize that many Members of this
 body oppose our current policy toward
 Nicaragua, and others who do not
 oppose it are skeptical of the way it
 has been conducted. I. too, wish we
 could go back to the beginning and
 start over. But we do not have that
 luxury; , we  have  to  proceed  from
 where we are now, consider what our
 national foreign policy goals ought to
 be, and decide how? we can go about
 achieving them.
 Now there is a great deal about the
 actions of the Government of Nicara-
 gua that I do not like. I do not like its
 Marxist-Leninist orientation; I do not
 like the way it censors the press or the
 Cardinal Obando y Bravo's homilies: I
 do not like the way it uproots people
 from their land and places them on co-
 operative farms. But having said all
 this, let me say something else: If this
 were all that the Sandinistas were
 doing, then it would be difficult to jus-
 tify  governmental support for the
 Contras. If everything the Sandinistas
 did had only an internal effect, then
 as much as I might oppose them, and
 as much as I would want them to
 change their ways, and as much as I
 might want to apply pressure on them
 because of their violations of human
 rights, then Government support for
 the Contras would not be my choice.
 But the Sandinistas are not just a
 leftist group that is engaging in inter-
 nal repression and experimenting with
 socialism as a possible way of solving
 the problems of a developing country
 in Latin America. Neither the political
 ideology of the Government of Nicara-
 gua nor its particular philosophy of
 property ownership is the issue here.
 The issue is what they are doing that
 threatens the peace and stability of
 Central America and the long-term in-
 terests of the United States in that
 region, and how we can diminish this
 threat.
 The Sandinistas are actively engaged
 in training guerrillas who are trying to
 overthrow by violence the govern-
 ments of El Salvador, Honduras, and
 Costa Rica. We have discussed the
 control and communications facilities
 that the Sandinistas admit they are
 providing for the five guerrilla fac-
 tions in El Salvador. We have dis-
 cussed the arms and ammunition the
 Sandinistas have been providing to

 many of these same guerrillas. And we
 know that much of this has been
 going on almost since the time the
 Sandinistas took over in Nicaragua.
 This is a group that came to power
 promising democracy and respect for
 its neighbors.
 We have discussed on more than one
 occasion recently the size and composi-
 tion of the Sandinista armed forces,
 which have grown so large that they
 are in a position to intimidate their
 neighbors. I do not see any need to
 talk about the specific numbers again;
 we should all understand by now the
 implications of the Sandinista military
 buildup and what it portends for the
 peace of the xegion.
 Let's discuss last April's congression--
 al vote on Contra aid and our policy
 toward  Nicaragua. . Many  Members
 wanted to give the Sandinistas an op-
 portunity to show their good faith,
 and to do so they voted against aid to
 the Contras. Well, we saw immediately
 just what good faith on the part of the
 Sandinistas means. Hardly had the
 last  votes  been  cast  than  Daniel
 Ortega was off for Moscow to greet
 Mikhail Gorbachev and to ask .him for
 additional aid. This action should not
 have been too surprising, and .I believe
 it underscores one of the ultimate dan-
 gers posed :by ,the direction the Sandi-
 nistas are presently heading.
 The same people are saying the
 same  things.  That  somehow  the
 United States drove the Sandinistas
 into the -arms of the Russians. That
 the United States has been hostile to
 he Sandinistas from the beginning.
 Well, that is just not true. While we
 were sending aid, they were establish-
 ing the second Soviet satellite in this
 hemisphere and the first on the .North
 American Continent. Today, an armed
 .Nicaraguan  minority,  advised  and
 backed by 3,000 or so Russian, Cuban,
 East German, Bulgarian, and PLO
 military advisers is busy suppressing
 the Nicaraguan majority.
 From the    beginning,  the  United
 States tried to help Nicaragua's revo-
 lution fulfill its original promises. Im-
 mediately after the ouster of Presi-
 dent 'Somoza in 1979, we airlifted food
 to feed the thousands of people dis-
 placed by the conflict. Over the next 2
 years we gave the new government
 five times as much aid as we had ,given
 its predecessor during its last 2 years.
 This Senator voted for such aid. In
 fact, our $117 million was more than
 Nicaragua received from any other
 nation in the world during those first
 few years.In addition, we helped ar-
 range rescheduling agreements with
 commercial banks and new loans in
 multilateral development banks, and
 we made special efforts to- strengthen
 the private sector of Nicaragua's econ-
 omy.
 But while the United States was
 trying to lend a helping hand, the
 Marxist hardliners among the revolu-
 tionaries  were  consolidating  their
 power,  radicalizing  their :programs,
 driving out those who did not share
 their-ideology, and beginning to pro-
 vide military assistance to guerrilla
 movements in neighboring countries.
 The Sandinistas leave few illusions to
 comfort their supporters in this coun-
 try. Tomas Borge brags of their revol-
 tution without boundaries, and they
 flaunt their increasing ties to the Sovi-
 ets. They spurned our friendship and
 refused to accept even our Peace
 Corps  volunteers.  They abandoned
 their professed commitments to de-
 mocracy, and they embarked on a
 course of   action  that  has. gotten
 them-and us-to the point we have
 reached today.
 Mr..President, I think it is now tune
 for us to acknowledge that the hopes
 which many of us had for the Sandi-
 nista regime have been disappointed;
 that their revolution has turned sour
 and become a threatening presence in
 Central America.
 I believe there is a substantial senti-
 ment in this body in support of actions
 to persuade the .Sandinistas to change
 the direction in which they are so
 clearly headed. What :is being offered
 here today is a comprehensive propos-
 al                                                   for  doing  precisely  this.  This
 amendment endeavors to codify the
 consensus on U.S. policy which I be-
 lieve already exists in the Senate and
 which may well be emerging in the
 othq body as well. It provides a mix-
 ture of pressures and incentives for
 Nicaragua to change course at home
 and in its dealings with .its neighbors.
 I believe this measure is a strong
 signal of U.S. support for the demo=cratic opposition. It provides encour-
 agement and support for the diplomat-
 ic process. It is not draconian; it is not
 one sided. It calls upon our own Gov-
 ernment to reenter .bilaterial negotia-
 tions with the Sandinistas; and it says
 we should refrain from military ma-
 neuvers near Nicaragua and suspend
 the trade embargo if the Sandinistas
 will agree to a cease-fire. to a dialog
 with the democratic resistance forces
 in Nicaragua, and to a suspension of
 the state of emergency.
 It calls upon the Contras to elimi-
 nate from their ranks any individuals
 who have engaged in human rights
 abuses.
 Furthermore, this amendment rec-
 ognizes the legitimate concerns of the
 Congress about the way the Nicaragua
 program has been conducted in the
 past by limiting assistance to the Con-
 tras to the funds released and author-
 ized in this statute. It does not provide
 a backdoor for any other aid to the
 Contras, whether covert or overt.
 No one can be sure what the Sandi-
 nista response to these proposals will
 be. I hope that they will see our deter-
 mination and will turn aside from the
 course they have been pursuing.
 But I am convinced they will do so
 only if there is sufficient pressure on
 them from within. A crucial compo-
 nent of this package, consequently, is
 release of the $14 million in human-.
 tarian assistance for the democratic
 resistance forces in Nicaragua for this
 year, plus the authorization of $24
 million in such assistance for fiscal
 year .1986.
 Today, even wil:hout U.S. assistance,
 the Contra forces have grown to twice
 what they were last year, and they are
 continuing to grow at a rate of '500 a
 month. It is not at all unusual for a
 patrol to go out with 20 commandos,
 as they -call themselves, and return to
 their base camp with twice that many.
 They are raising private funds, but it
 is vital that we give their efforts our
 stamp  of  approval,  both for  the
 morale boost, it offers the Contras and
 for the message it sends both to the
 Sandinistas and to the other govern-
 ments in the regions.
 I want to emphasize, too, that the
 Contras are not mercenaries, despite
 the  Sandinista  propaganda  claims.
 Almost all of them are simple peas-
 ants-Campesinos-who say they are
 fighting because they have had their
 land taken from them, because they
 have  been  placed  on   cooperative
 farms, because they want to be left
 alone to raise their crops and their
 families. They are not receiving any
 pay for their service, only beans and
 rice and bullets. They are willing to
 give their lives for their own interests
 in Nicaragua, but in doing so they .are
 also fighting on behalf of the interests
 of the United Stares.
 In closing, I want to emphasize that
 if the Sandinistas succeed in eliminat-
 ing the Contra,; and consolidating
 their power with Nicaragua, they will
 pose an even greater threat to the
 peace and stability of the region. The
 primary obstacle to this is the pres-
 sure exerted on them by the Contras;
 and if we take the pressure off, if we
 abandon the one force that is current-
 ly engaging their attention, then lain
 confident the Sandinistas will increase
 their active support of insurgencies,
 and their violence, censorship and sup-
 pression will spread to the other coun-
 tries of Latin America. The stream of
 refugees headed toward Mexico and
 the United States will turn into a tor-
 rent, and San Antonio, the 10th larg-
 est city in the United States, will be
 well on its way to becoming the first.
 It is legitimate, necessary, and right
 that the United States be concerned
 about the safety of its neighbors and
 that it exert its influence against
 those who would subjugate a free
 people. We are a leader among the na-
 tions of the free 'world and we should
 measure up to that .responsibility. We
 cannot abdicate  that  responsibility
 with a return to the short-term -cop
 out of isolationism. We should do
 what we can to discourage the Sandi-
 nistas' regional ad.venturism and ?to* en-
 courage the elimination of their mili-
 tary ties with the Soviet bloc, and I
 urge your support of this amendment
 as a reasonable and comprehensive
 way to achieve this objective.
 Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I yield
 myself such time as is necessary.

 June 6, 1985                CONGRESSIONAL RECOR
 Mr. President, I want to commend
 the sponsors of this amendment for
 their real efforts to find a middle-,
 ground position that might attract bi-
 partisan support to achieve peace in
 Central America. In particular, 'their
 effort to define more clearly what con-
 stitutes humanitarian aid .is an im-
 provement over the earlier versions of
 the approach embodied in this amend-
 ment.
 Regrettably, however, I believe it
 still falls short of constituting what I
 would consider an approach that leads
 to peace rather than a continued con-
 flict, because, as I read this amend-
 ment, it would not clearly prohibit the
 provision of trucks, jeeps, communica-
 tions equipment, and other items that,
 whole nonlethal in and of themselves,
 would support the continuation of a
 conflict in violation of our commit-
 ment under the OAS charter and in
 violation of our own national interests.
 But even If the definition of humani-
 tarian aid were further clarified to
 prohibit providing the equipment I
 have just described, giving humanitari-
 an aid would still permit the. Contras
 to divert funds now being used for
 such things as food, medicine, and
 clothing to be used to acquire military
 equipment.
 More importantly, however, para-
 graph (i)(2) of the amendment is dan-
 gerously flawed and, if enacted, would
 come close to constituting the sort of
 Gulf of Tonkin kind of open invitation
 to the President to take whatever
 action he considers necessary to re-
 solve the conflict. As one of the few
 Senators left who made the bad mis-
 take of voting for the Gulf of Tonkin
 resolution some years back,  I am
 always perhaps extra sensitive to any
 analogy in this regard.
 The two bases for the Presidential
 determination contained in this para-
 graph appear, in fact, to be designed
 to encourage the President to escalate
 American support for or direct in-
 volvement in the Contra effort to
 overthrow the Government of Nicara-
 gua.
 Why do I believe this? First of all,
 the determination relating to the Con-
 tadora document of ? objectives does
 not require that Nicaragua be respon-
 sible for any failure to reach an agree-
 ment based upon that document. Only
 a few months ago, Nicaragua and
 other  Central  American  countries
 were prepared to sign a Contradora-
 sponsored treaty, but pressure from
 our own administration caused the
 other Central American Governments
 not to sign. Furthermore, we should
 remember it was the United States
 that unilaterally broke off the bilater-
 al talks with Nicaragua in Manzanillo
 that  might  have  resolved  United
 States-Nicaraguan, differences regard-
 ing the Contadora treaty.
 Nothing has happened since then
 holds out any promises that the ad-
 ministration is really serious about re-
 solving differences with Nicaragua so
 as to achieve a treaty.
 The second determination relating
 to the failure of trade and economic
 measures to resolve the conflict in
 Central America is also destined to be
 a foregone outcome. Most, if not all, of
 our allies in the region and in Europe
 have absolutely refused to cooperate
 in the American sanctions effort, and
 Nicaragua has already taken steps to
 negate the effects of the sanctions.
 These sanctions,  which will affect
 mainly the middle income and the pri-
 vate sector groups in Nicaragua, will
 not, in my view,, prove effective. The
 vacuum will be quickly filled up by
 other willing suppliers.  Frankly,  I
 think the application of ? economic
 sanctions usually is the same as if one
 shoots one's self in the foot.
 So the President will have no prob-
 lem in making either of the determi-
 nations provided for in paragraphs
 (i)(2). I predict that if this provision
 becomes law, the administration will
 be back with requests that will boggle
 the mind. The language in this para-
 graph that states "The President may
 request the Congress to authorize ad-
 ditional assistance for the democratic
 resistance in such amount and of such
 a nature as the President considers ap-
 propriate" could, as I read it, be esca-
 lated to include the sending of U.S.
 military forces to fight in Nicaragua.
 I  think,  in  general,  while  this
 amendment is a true effort at achiev-
 ing a bipartisan approach, it does not
 do the job that I would like to see it
 do.
 Finally, from my own viewpoint, I
 think we should be honest with our-
 selves. To my mind, the Contras really
 are terrorists. The definition of terror-
 ism is the changing of the policy of
 government  through  violence  and
 murder and the like. This is exactly
 what the Contras are seeking to do'
 now in Nicaragua.
 In addition to that, the difference
 between a freedom fighter and a ter-
 rorist is, to' my mind, pretty clear. A
 freedom fighter is.somebody who goes
 after military objectives, military tar-
 gets, and installations of the govern-
 ment that they are trying to overturn.
 A terrorist is far more indiscriminate
 in the damage that he or she does and
 a good many civilians get killed in the
 process.
 About a year ago, the rough esti-
 mate was that some 4,000 civilian casu-
 alties had taken place as a result of
 the action of the Contras. Now, terror-
 ism, I think, should be opposed, and
 we do -inveigh against it. But when it is
 practiced, we should be honest with
 ourselves and recognize that we, too,
 are using terrorism as a weapon.
 So, for all of these reasons, I find
 myself in opposition to this amend-
 ment but in praise of the motives that
 caused it to be written.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will
 the Senator from Rhode Island yield
 me 5 minutes?
 Mr. PELL. I yield 5 minutes to the
 Senator from Massachusetts.
 S 7633
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Massachusetts is recog-
 nized.
 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will
 vote against providing so-called "hu-
 manitarian assistance" to the Contras
 because of one undeniable, irrefutable,
 nondebatable fact: This assistance is
 nothing more than logistical support
 for the Contras war against the Gov-
 ernment of Nicaragua, and I do not be-
 lieve that the United States of Amer-
 ica should be in the business of over-
 throwing governments.
 U.S. support for this war has been a
 mistake from the beginning. It is a
 mistake to continue it today. The
 policy is wrong-legally, morally, and
 practically. It has been a failure to
 date, and it has no hope of success in
 the future. It has also been an embar-
 rassment  to  the  United  States
 throughout the world.
 Within 6 weeks after President
 Reagan took the oath of office in 1981,
 he endorsed the CIA's plan to organize
 and to fund paramilitary activities
 against the Sandinista Government in
 Nicaragua. This decision brought the
 United States into anoallia.nce with an
 army that was, at that time, dominat-
 ed by the leaders of Somoza's notori-
 ous and hated national guard. We
 should not have signed on with the So-
 mocistas then; we should not be sup-
 porting them today.  In  1981, Mr.
 Reagan turned -to the secret use of
 military force as his course of first
 resort, he signed us up to support a
 covert war run by the forces of reac-
 tion and repression, and our policy
 toward Nicaragua has been hostage to
 that decision ever since. It is high time
 that we changed course.
 The issue today is really no different
 from what it was a year ago, or just
 last month, when the Congress reject-
 ed providing military assistance to the
 Contras. That issue is: Should the
 United States - of America help the
 Contras in their efforts to overthrow
 the Government of Nicaragua?
 Changing the label from military as-
 sistance to humanitarian assistance
 does  not  change  the  fundamental
 issue. Clothing given to people fight-
 ing a war is called uniforms; food given
 to armed forces in combat is called ra-
 tions; footwear for soldiers is boots;
 and   medical assistance  to men  in
 battle is used to treat the wounded.
 In fact, the use of the term "human-
 itarian assistance" is totally mislead-
 ing. We are not talking about provid-
 ing "humanitarian assistance" here;
 we are talking about providing logisti-
 cal support for the Contra combatants
 fighting to overthrow the Sandinistas.
 The definition of "humanitarian as-
 sistance" as set forth in the Geneva
 Conventions and Protocols requires
 that humanitarian assistance, be ad-
 ministered by an organization inde-
 pendent from the parties of the con-
 flict, that it be distributed to noncom-
 batants only and then only on the
 basis of need, and that it be available

 impartially to all affected civilians on
 both sides of the conflict. This pro-
 posed assistance flunks the test on all
 counts.  Simply  put,  this  is more
 money for more war.
 If this assistance were really "hu-
 manitarian," the cosponsors would not
 be asking for so much. This amend-
 ment authorizes the appropriation of
 $24 million. This is an arbitrary, in
 fact, an irrational sum that bears no
 relationship whatsoever to the legiti-
 mate humanitarian needs of those
 Nicaraguans who have left Nicaragua
 and now live in Honduras. To see how
 irrational this figure is, one only needs
 to compare it with actual expenditures
 being made today by the United Na-
 tions High Commissioner for Refugees
 [UNHCR] which has a full-blown refu-
 gee. assistance program for Nicara-
 guans living in Honduras.
 According to most recent counts, the
 UNHCR provides assistance for 19,093
 Nicaraguan refugees inside Honduras.
 In 1983, the UNHCR budget for the
 Nicaraguans  was  $4  million;  the.
 budget 1984 was $4.08 million. That
 amounts to an expenditure of $213 per
 Nicaraguan per year.
 Now it is proposed that Congress
 make available $24 million to the Con-
 tras in fiscal year 1986. Assuming that
 -the Contras now number somewhere
 between 15,000 and 20,000 combatants,
 this amendment would produce an ex-
 penditure  of  between  $1,200  and
 $1,600 per Contra per year. This figure
 .should be put in the context of an av-
 erage annual per capita income for
 Nicaraguans living inside their coun-
 try of around $500.
 Make no mistake about this vote: A
 vote for this $24 million in so-called
 humanitarian assistance will put $24.
 million worth of guns and bullets in
 the hands of the Contras just as
 surely as if we were to deliver these
 weapons  directly.  A  vote  for this
 amendment is a vote for more war in.
 Nicaragua and more killing by the
 Contras.
 Although the issue has not changed
 from our earlier debates on this sub-
 ject,. in many -ways, the debate has
 been clarified. No longer are we oper-
 ating under the illusion that, by assist-
 ing the Contras, the United States is
 simply trying to halt the flow of arms
 from Nicaragua to the guerrilla forces
 inside El Salvador. No longer are we
 told that we must support the Contras
 to pressure the Sandinistas into restor-
 ing basic freedoms inside Nicaragua.
 No longer is the purpose of the Presi-
 dent's policy in any doubt: President
 Reagan wants Congress to support the
 Contras because he supports the aim
 of the Contras-to overthrow the Gov-
 ernment of Nicaragua by force. The
 issue  before  the  Senate  today  is
 whether we will authorize the expend-
 iture of $24 million to be used to over-
 throw a government that we do not
 approve of. That is a goal unworthy of
 the United States of America, and we
 should reject it.
 And who are the people who will be
 receiving this assistance? Are they
 worthy of our support? Do they de-
 serve our assistance? Do they repre-
 sent the best ideals of America?
 On this question, there has also been
 some clarification over the past few
 months. No longer is it possible to be-
 lieve that the Contra commanders are
 the moral equivalent to our Founding
 Fathers. In fact, it is a travesty to
 compare   Enrique   Bermudez   to
 Thomas Jefferson or John Adams or
 James  Madison.  On the contrary,
 there have been repeated and reliable
 reports of gross atrocities by the
 Contra combatants, of prisoners being
 executed, of innocent women and chil-
 dren being raped and mutilated, of ci-
 vilians being murdered. How can the
 Congress, in all conscience, provide an
 additional  $24  million  to  support
 people engaged in this kind of outra-
 geous and criminal conduct.
 But one more clarification is needed:
 We are not engaged today in a debate
 about the political shortcomings or
 character defects of the Sandinistas.
 No one here is proposing a resolution
 of support for the Sandinistas, and I
 doubt that there is much disagree-
 ment here about the nature of the
 Sandinista leaders or about their ideo-
 logical proclivities. I am no fan of the
 Sandinistas, and I think we all under-
 stand that the Sandinistas are not
 champions of freedom and democracy.
 The real question is what the United
 States should do about it-consistent
 with our own best values and in con-
 junction with our own best friends and
 allies.
 Daniel Ortega's trip to Moscow was
 shocking, but not for the reasons most
 people give. After all, Ortega has been
 to Moscow on other occasions, and his
 fellow commandantes have also visited
 such bastions of freedom as Libya and
 Bulgaria. The fact that the Sandinis-
 tas are friends of the enemies of free-
 dom is not new.
 Ortega's trip was shocking because
 of its deliberate timing. His decision to
 go to Moscow right after Congress
 voted to withhold further assistance
 from the Contras demonstrated both
 arrogance and insensitivity. But arro-
 gance and insensitivity is nothing new
 from the Sandinistas. Ortega's trip to
 Moscow was troubling to me for an-
 other reason; it showed that the San-
 dinistas care more about the views and
 opinions of the leaders of the Soviet
 Union that they do about the respect
 and good will of the people of the
 United States of America; it showed
 that the Sandinistas are just as unwill-
 ing to live with the reality of Ameri-
 can influence and power in Central
 America as some Americans are to live
 with the reality of the Sandinista rev-
 olution in Nicaragua. If the Sandinis-
 tas want continued confrontation with
 the United States, they should know
 that there are plenty of Americans
 who are happy to oblige them. But
 that kind of collision course, in my
 view, would be a disaster for Nicara-
 guans and Americans alike.
 But Ortega's trip is also evidence of
 the increased influence of the Soviet
 Union inside Nicaragua. I believe that
 this, at least in part, is attributable to
 President Reagan's alliance with the
 Contras and his unequivocal state-
 ments that he seeks, to make the San-
 dinistas cry uncle.
 The President's policy toward Nica-
 ragua has not 'only failed; it has been
 postively counterproductive. We share
 the President's concern about the poli-
 cies of the Sandinista Government.
 We share his concern about the influ-
 ? ence of the Soviets and the Cubans in
 the region,  and, more particularly
 about their presence and influence
 inside Nicaragua. We share his con-
 cern  about                                                                                               Sandinista  efforts  to
 export their revolution and to subvert
 neighboring countries, although the
 evidence is far from clear on this
 point. We share his concern about the
 increased size and strength of the Nic-
 araguan military. And we share his
 concern about human rights abuses
 inside  Nicaragua-particularly   the
 Sandinistas'  inhuman treatment of
 the Miskito Indians and other indige-
 nous populations inside that country.
 But when you examine what has
 happened with respect to each one of
 these  concerns;  the  Reagan  ap-
 proach-continued support of the Con-
 tras war-has made matters worse, not
 better. Rather than reducing Soviet/
 Cuban influence inside Nicaragua, the
 Reagan policies have, over the past 5
 years; resulted in an increase in that
 influence. Rather than reducing .the
 size of the Nicaraguan military estab-
 lishment, the Reagan policies over the
 past 5 years have prompted a growth
 in the size of. the Nicaraguan Army
 that is unprecedented in that nation's
 history. Rather than undermining the
 influence of the Sandinistas in the
 region, the Reagan policies have trans-
 formed Daniel Ortega into a heroic
 David doing battle with a bullying
 American Goliath. Rather than pro-
 ducing greater freedom inside Nicara-
 gua, the Reagan policies have only
 given the Sandinista hardliners a pre-
 text to crack down on dissidents inside
 Nicaragua.
 U.S. support of the Contras has
 failed,  it, cannot  succeed,  and  we
 should terminate it altogether.
 But what about the trade embargo?'
 This amendment calls upon Presi-
 dent-Reagan to "develop, in close con-
 sultation and cooperation with other
 nations, trade and economic measures
 to complement the economic sanctions
 of the United States imposed by the
 'President on May 1, 1985." The Presi-
 dent's decision to declare a national
 emergency and to impose a unilateral,
 comprehensive trade embargo on Nica-
 ragua was a gesture, not a policy, and
 it will only 'compound our problems in
 the region.
 As a matter of principle, I have
 nothing against economic sanctions,

 June 6, 1985              CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 when they make sense. In fact, I have
 introduced legislation with Senator
 WEICKER  that would impose certain
 economic pressures on the Govern-
 ment of South Africa in an effort to
 encourage nonviolent change and the
 dismantling of apartheid in that coun-
 try.
 But I do not believe that a wholesale
 trade embargo against Nicaragua, im-
 posed  unilaterally  by  the  United
 States, in the absence of any consulta-
 tion or support from our friends and
 allies in the region makes any sense.
 First,  this  trade  embargo only
 heightens the perception that the
 United States is no different from the
 Soviet Union in its treatment of its
 smaller and weaker neighbors, that
 the United States is a bully, and that
 Nicaragua is a victim. Daniel Ortega
 will only become an even greater hero
 among the people of his country and
 among the people of the hemisphere,
 particularly among the youth. Outside
 observers perceive Nicaragua to be our
 Poland, our Czechoslovakia and per-
 haps ultimately, our Afghanistan. The
 embargo will only fuel anti-American,
 anti-Yankee feeling in Nicaragua and
 in the region generally.  -
 Second, because of the embargo, all
 the failures of the Sandinista revolu-
 tion can now be laid at the feet of the
 Americans. The Nicaraguan economy
 is failing now because of serious mis-
 takes by the Sandinistas themselves;
 the embargo will only permit the San-
 dinistas to escape responsibility for
 their own errors and to blame the
 United States for all economic prob-
 lems inside their country. Whenever a
 Nicaraguan cannot get a spare part,
 whenever he or she must stand in line
 for 3 hours to buy soap or toothpaste
 or toilet paper, whenever a car breaks
 down and cannot be fixed whenever
 the buses run late, whenever crops
 fail, whatever bad that happens will
 now be blamed on the U.S.-sponsored
 trade embargo. As a result, the stand-
 ing of the Sandinistas inside Nicara-
 gua will only be enhanced.
 Third, a unilateral trade embargo
 will inevitably be counterproductive.
 The trade embargo will not reduce the
 influence of the Soviets inside Nicara-
 gua; it will only increase it. The em-
 bargo will not reduce the strength or
 resolve of the Nicaraguan military; it
 will only increase the garrison state
 mentality inside that country.
 Fourth, this trade embargo will do
 most serious damage to the opposition
 forces inside Nicaragua who depend
 upon trade with the United States for
 their independence and existence. The
 private sector is the backbone of La
 Coordinadora, the most important op-
 position force functioning inside Nica-
 ragua today. The embargo strikes , at
 the lifeblood of, the private sector and
 damages its ability to operate separate
 and apart from the Government. It is
 for this reason, I, presume, that both
 Arturo Cruz and Cardinal Obando y
 Brava-two of the most,eloquent and
 outspoken critics of the Sandinistas
 inside Nicaragua-have been so critical
 of the embargo.
 Finally, this trade embargo damages
 our standing with our friends and
 allies. in the region and undermines
 the Contadora. process. In this hemi-
 sphere, the lack of support for Presi-
 dent Reagan's initiative has been dra-
 matic. Only El Salvador has supported
 the President's action. This kind of
 unilateral initiative by the United
 States can only serve to undermine
 the multilateral efforts of the Conta-
 dora nations to achieve a comprehen-
 sive resolution of the conflict in Cen-
 tral America.
 Opposition to this embargo has not
 been limited to this hemisphere. Right
 after President Reagan declared the
 national emergency and imposed the
 embargo, he traveled to Europe where
 he met with some of our most impor-
 tant allies. Not one of those allies has
 endorsed President Reagan's initiative.
 Many were openly critical, some are
 openly assisting the Sandinistas ef-
 forts to overcome the embargo.
 In addition to providing additional
 funds  for  the  Contras'  war,  this
 amendment   repeals   the      Boland
 amendment and unleashes the Central
 Intelligence Agency to work with the
 Contra forces by sharing intelligence
 information.
 ? These provisions, If enacted, will for
 the first time, permit Americans to
 participate In the conduct of the Con-
 tras' war against the Sandinistas. Con-
 gressman  BOLAND'S  language stated
 that no funds available to the CIA or
 the Defense Department could be ex-
 pended for the purpose or which
 would have the effect of supporting,
 directly or indirectly, military or para-
 military operations in Nicaragua by
 any nation, group, organization, move-
 ment or individual. Now that the
 President has owned up to his real in-
 tentions and made clear what his true'
 objectives are, Congress should not re-
 verse itself and give carte blanche to
 the CIA to assist the Contras in their
 efforts to overthrow the Government
 of Nicaragua. By the same token, Con-
 gress should not liberate the CIA to
 participate in the Contras' military op-
 erations, as is also proposed in this
 amendment. These two provisions-
 the repeal of Boland and the licensing
 of the CIA to share intelligence infor-
 mation with the Contras-can only
 result in the direct involvement of
 U.S. personnel in the conduct of the
 Contras' war against the Sandinistas.
 Make no mistake about the implica-
 tions of these provisions; by enacting
 this amendment, the Senate will be
 giving the CIA and the DOD explicit
 authority to participate in the Con-
 tras' war against the Sandinistas. In
 this respect, this amendment is tanta-
 mount to another Gulf of Tonkin reso-
 lution. In future years, historians will
 look, back and say this was our first
 step onto a slippery slope that will
 lead to massive involvement of Ameri-
 cans in the war in Nicaragua. The
 CIA's participation today will only
 lead to our GI's involvement tomor-
 row.
 Mr. President, I oppose this amend-
 ment because, in so many ways, it
 magnifies and perpetuates the most
 serious flaw in President Reagan's ap-
 proach toward Nicaragua over the past
 5 -years, our pursuit of unilateral meas-
 ures at the expense of ongoing multi-
 lateral efforts to achieve a comprehen-
 sive regional settlement. In our efforts
 to influence the direction of events
 inside Nicaragua, we should under-
 stand, first and foremost, that the his-
 tory of that country has revolved
 around frequent and repeated unilat-
 eral  interventions  by  the  United
 States. We should understand that, by
 ,persisting in our efforts unilaterally to
 influence events inside Nicaragua, we
 are engaged in a self-defeating enter-
 prise. For every action by the Ameri-
 cans, there is an equal if not greater
 anti-American reaction of the Nicara-
 guans. The revolution inside Nicara-
 gua today is being fueled by high-
 octane  anti-Americanism,  and  this
 amendment will rev up the anti-Ameri-
 can engine to a fever pitch.
 We  should  instead  be working
 through multi-lateral channels, work-
 ing with friends in the region, and we
 should support the Contadora process.
 For all these reasons-and for all of
 the reasons I outlined earlier in sup-
 port of other amendments-I urge my
 fellow Senators to oppose this amend-
 ment.' In casting our votes against
 more war in Central America, howev-
 er, let us also send a message to the
 Sandinistas: "You too must change
 course. You too must move towards
 national reconciliation. You too must
 give peace a chance. Time is running
 out."
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield
 10 minutes to the Senator from Okla-
 homa, Senator BOREN.
 The PRESIDING, OFFICER. The
 Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.
 Mr. BOREN. Mr. President, I thank
 the Senator from Indiana.
 Mr. BOREN. Mr. President, I have
 sponsored  and  cosponsored  many
 amendments in the past 6'  years of
 serving in this body. The vast majority
 of them I supported from a firm con-
 viction that their passage was in the
 best interests of the people of my
 State and this Nation. Some others I
 have supported, not just as measures
 representing the best interest of the
 people, but as legislation that was vital
 to the interests of this Nation. I place
 this amendment in the latter category.
 I truly believe the passage of this
 amendment,  at this  time,  in  this
 forum, is vital to the interests of the
 United States.
 A year and a half ago, I was privi-
 leged to serve as an observer of the
 Presidential elections in El Salvador.
 Recently, with Congressman GLENN
 ENGLISH, I returned to the region for
 talks with a wide cross-section of polit-
 ical, religious; and civic leaders in El
 Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua,

 including the Presidents of the first
 two nations and the Vice President of
 the third.
 Certainly, on the basis of two visits
 to the region, I do not claim to be an
 expert on Central America. I ? have,
 however, endeavored to learn as much
 as I possibly could and the two. oppor-
 tunities for a firsthand view certainly
 enhanced  my  understanding  and
 opened my eyes to developments that
 had previously escaped my attention.
 I went to the region inclined to favor
 aiding  the Contras,  but skeptical
 about the chances for changing the in-
 ternal course in Nicaragua away from
 Marxist control. I came back'believing
 that, there is a deep and widespread
 desire of the people there for true de-
 mocracy and that given the right com-
 bination of circumstances there is a re-
 alistic chance to prevent the establish-
 ment of a Communist government in
 Nicaragua without any direct use of
 American military force.
 To achieve success, however, the
 United States must continue to give
 the tools to the local people them-
 selves to bring political, military, and
 diplomatic pressure to bear against
 the Sandinista government..
 I am also convinced that if we fail to
 give support to the local forces in the
 region which are fighting for freedom,
 we will ultimately endanger the securi-
 ty of all of the nations of Central
 America and our own security as well.
 The best way to assure that young
 Americans will not ever have to fight
 and die in Latin America to protect
 our national interests is to give the
 tools to Central Americans to defend
 freedom  themselves,  in  their  own
 homelands.
 As  a    preeminent   power  in  this
 region, there is no way that we can
 avoid taking action. As President Na-
 poleon Duarte of El Salvador said to
 me, "Even a failure to act by the
 United States constitutes an action."
 He meant that if we fail to exert any
 pressure on the Sandinistas, it will
 send a message of nonsupport to our
 friends and it will embolden our en-
 emies.
 The situation in El Salvador whicl1 I
 found in May was markedly improved
 from a year earlier. The Duarte gov-
 ernment won a clear majority for the
 moderate center in the parliament. Po-
 litical violence is a fraction of what it
 was 1 year ago. The strength of Com-
 munist guerrilla forces has declined
 and the number of polling places
 where they disrupted elections was
 down by 500 percent from 1 year ago.
 Important -judicial and land reforms
 are progressing. There are many rea-
 sons for the progress and President
 Duarte himself deserves much credit
 for his moderate and courageous ap-
 proach.
 The pressure placed on the Sandi-,
 nista government by the Contra activi-
 ty and by brave. opposition political
 leaders  inside  Nicaragua  has  also
 .clearly reduced the level of help which
 has been coming from Nicaragua to
 Communist guerrillas in El Salvador.
 The surest way to destabilize El Sal-
 vador and forfeit the gains made is to
 make the, pressure off the Sandinista
 government.
 My recent visit to Nicaragua also
 firmly convinced me that if we with-
 draw                                                 all  support  from  opposition
 forces  in Nicaragua the inevitable
 result will be the consolidation of a
 Communist regime there. We will have
 another Cuba in our own backyard.
 This time it will not be surrounded by
 water, but will be connected by a con-
 tinuous,land mass which joins our own
 borders. Its own boundaries with its
 immediate neighbors are hard to de-
 termine geographically and easy to
 penetrate.
 If anyone is naive enough to believe
 that the present Sandinista govern-
 ment will moderate and allow for a
 pluralistic democracy voluntarily, they
 are closing their eyes to all clear evi-
 dence. They should ask themselves,
 why is the church being oppressed?
 They should ask, why must the ser-
 mons or homilies of former Archbish-
 op and now Cardinal Bando Y Bravo
 be submitted to government censors 24
 hours before they are delivered? They
 should  ask,  why  are  the  church
 schools forced to allow special teach-
 ers to begin Marxist indoctrination at
 age 10? They should demand to know
 why is the free press, including La
 Prensa, which so valiantly opposed the
 Samoza regime, so heavily censored?
 One day after Congress defeated aid to
 the Contras and on the day before
 President Ortega departed to Moscow,
 the paper was so heavily censored that
 it could not even go to press.
 That was one of the photos censored
 from La Prensa, a photo showing the
 special store where only special Sandi-
 nista officials can buy.
 Those who believe that this govern-
 ment will change should ask, why are
 political block captains being used to
 control food ration cards necessary to
 obtain food and sparsely stocked mar-
 kets? They should ask, why are special
 well-stocked stores reserved only for
 shopping by privileged Sandinista offi-
 cials if this is truly a government dedi-
 cated to equality? They should ask,
 why are small farmers in the northern
 areas being forcibly relocated to camps
 after  the  government  burns  their
 small houses, and takes their live-
 stock?
 The pattern is all, too clear. As one
 Nicaraguan said to me,  "I fought
 against Samoza. I was a true Sandi-
 nista and still consider that I am a
 true revolutionary for democracy, but
 the Communists have stolen our revo-
 lution from us. In the earlier broad-
 based junta and government which
 was broadly representative, those with
 democratic philosophies were placed'
 in nonsensitive jobs and the Marxists
 took control of the army, and police
 and instruments of control." The pat-
 tern, Mr. President, is all too tragically
 reminiscent of many other places in
 the globe like Eastern Europe.
 As I : said earlier, I wish that every
 Senator could have shared in my expe-
 riences. I wish that they could have
 joined Congressman, ENGLISH as he vis-
 ited with the people on the streets of
 Managua, away from the ears of gov-
 ernment officials and found them vir-
 tually unanimous in their opposition
 to the current government. I wish that
 the entire Senate could meet Violetta
 Chamarro who, with her brother-in-
 law, publishes "La Prensa." Her hus-
 band was murdered by Samoza and
 the paper was burned. She joined the
 revolution and served in the first San-
 dinista Junta. She resigned after the
 Marxists took over. Now she struggles
 on against censorship and threats to
 continue her fight for freedom against
 the Marxist dictatorship as bravely as
 .she and her husband fought against
 the dictatorship of the right under
 Samoza.
 I wish that every member of Con-
 gress could talk to Cardinal Bando Y
 Bravo who himself has narrowly es-
 caped machinegun attacks twice. How
 can there possibly tie any justification
 in any free country for the continu-
 ation of censorship of his words to his
 flock? Clearly the Pope, in elevating
 this Archbishop to the position of Car-
 dinal, has sent a clear message to the
 world. Even so, the Marxist regime is
 now financing its own created so-called
 peoples church to try to undermine
 the continuation of the free church.
 I wish that they could have met Vir-
 gillio Godoy, who had the courage to
 resign as Minister of Labor when he
 found that the government was creat-
 ing its own state labor union to des-
 tory the free labor movement.
 I wish that all of my colleagues had
 been with me when the Chamarros
 and Virgellio Godoyy asked me, "Are
 you going to abandon us? Are you
 going to walk away and leave us here
 to fight alone?" I, for one, could not
 look them in the eye and answer yes
 to those questions.
 These people know what it is like to
 live under the Sandinistas. They know
 what a block committee is and how
 those committees report on neighbor-
 hood activities. They know 'about in-
 doctrination techniques and the spe-
 cial tours arranged for visiting Ameri-
 cans and others who are given an ef-
 fectively slanted and carefully con-
 trolled view when they come as guests
 of the Sandinistas.
 Mr. President, finally, I wish that
 the American, people could have joined
 me in paying a visit to a group of Con-
 tras inside the battle zone. I talked
 first hand with a small group of about
 50 Contras returning from a patrol.
 With all due respect to the Senator
 from Rhode Island, if he could have
 been there with me and talked to the
 young people, I think he- would have
 joined in calling them freedom fight-
 ers.   -

 Some had been fighting for as long
 as 3 years. Others were recent recruits.
 One was a 16-year-old girl carrying a
 machinegun. After talking with them
 I had a better understanding of why
 the Contra forces are growing so rap-
 idly, perhaps at a rate of increase of
 500 or 600 per month. I had a better
 understanding of why the morale is so
 high and why, if given the tools, I be-
 lieve they have some chance of ulti-
 mate success and can certainly prevent
 total consolidation of the Sandinista
 regime.
 They are all Nicaraguans from the
 grassroots of the country. They are
 mainly very young-not old enough to
 have been in uniform under Samoza.
 They are not mercenaries. They get no
 salary, only about 45 cents per day
 worth  of rations  and second-hand
 clothes. They fight with captured East
 Block weapons.
 One after another told me that he
 joined the Contras after the Sandinis-
 tas took his farm and burned their
 houses or took his parents to what
 they all called concentration camps
 where they also collected the few
 cows, pigs, and chickens which the
 farmers had previously owned. One
 was a young teacher who told me he
 was a Christian and refused to teach
 communism to children so he was
 fired. They are a grassroots force to be
 reckoned with and they are growing.
 While I was in Managua they succeed-
 ed in raiding a major town in the cen-
 tral area 45 miles east of the capital
 and severed road traffic.
 For those who see parallels to Viet-
 nam, they should consider that here it
 is the Communists who must fight
 against a grassroots group using effec-
 tive raiding tactics in very rough ter-
 rain. Here it is the Communists who
 are burning out small farmers and
 hamlets and are turning the people in
 the countryside against the govern-
 ment just as they are alienating the
 religious community and city dwellers
 through food rationing, the military
 draft, and favoritism for high govern-
 ment officials.
 All of these experiences leave me
 with the conviction that we must
 devise a method of assistance that can
 be supported openly by this Congress
 and the American people. I beleive we
 have found it in this amendment.
 One of the best things about this
 amendment is its bipartisan nature. I
 have spoken before on this floor about
 the need for bipartisanship in the Na-
 tion's foreign policy.
 If I may return a moment to my
 recent meeting with President Duarte,
 he emphasized the need for a united
 bipartisan approach. He went on to
 say that in his opinion the battle for
 the Third World is a battle between
 ideologies, not a battle between na-
 tions. If the democracies of the world
 do not have a strategy, the other side
 does.
 A united front, he said, is what the
 resistance to Communist aggression in
 Central  America  needs  most.  The
 Communists exploit the unique Ameri-
 can propensity to speak in many
 voices. They want to negotiate because
 they expect to win through the inac-
 tion of Congress what they cannot win
 in battle.or from the voluntary sup-
 port of their own people.
 This  Congress  and  this  country
 should be exporting democracy, not
 withdrawing from the field.
 This amendment in that sense is an
 export amendment-it seeks to export
 democracy. It provides $24 million in
 carefully defined humanitarian aid to
 the Contras-overtly provides and it
 sets up a mechanism for monitoring
 and reporting to Congress every 90
 days.
 While it unfences the $14 million al-
 ready approved by repealing -the so-
 called Boland amendment, it contains
 language that reinstitutes the intent
 of Boland by prohibiting any further
 assistance without the specific request
 of the President and the approval of
 the full Congress. This is a reasonable
 approach. and in my view virtually the
 least this Senate should do to aid the
 Contras, the region and our own na-
 tional interests.
 Mr. President, I close by returning
 one last time to my conversation with
 President   Duarte.   One   of   the
 strengths of the Communist countries,
 he said, was that they help each other.
 In Nicaragua today are Cubans, Sovi-
 ets, East Germans; Bulgarians, and
 some reports say even. the PLO. One
 of the problems we have'with the San-
 dinistas now is that they aid other rev-
 olutions in neighboring states and
 even in South America, despite their
 own internal difficulties. They help
 each other.
 One of the difficulties with democra-
 cies is that, by and large, they are in-
 wardly focused and pay not enough at-
 tention to what is occurring outside
 their own borders, unless it has a
 direct and immediate effect on them.
 Democracies seem ill equipped to pa-
 tiently pursue a consistent policy over
 a long period of time which helps their
 friends.
 Mr. President, it is time to take a
 small step toward altering that equa-
 tion. This amendment is the instru-
 ment of that step and I urge my col-
 leagues to support it.    -

 Mr. HARKIN. I thank the distin-

 With regard to the amendment of-
 fered by the distinguished Senator
 from Georgia, I' have some questions
 which I would like to propound to the
 Senator from Georgia during the time
 I have been allotted. I have a couple of
 questions which I discussed earlier
 with him which I would like to have
 clarified, if I could, prior to voting on
 the amendment.
 S 7637
 As  I  understand  the Senator's
 amendment, further material assist-
 ance to the Contras above that specifi-
 cally contained in this amendment
 would be prohibited unless the Con-
 gress were to vote to approve such
 funds.
 While I am pleased that the amend-
 ment protects this body's prerogative
 to authorize and appropriate funds for
 the Contras and assures another op-
 portunity to assess the situation fur-
 ther down the road, I am extremely
 concerned that while well intentioned,
 the prohibition for further assistance
 in this measure may in fact not be
 loophole free.
 My colleagues are familiar with the
 Boland amendment which has been in
 effect for 2 years. Before this body,
 takes a new approach to the problem,
 it is my. hope that the distinguished
 .Senator from Georgia would be willing
 to answer some questions about the
 intentoand effect of his amendment.
 As  I  understand  it,  the  Boland
 amendment prohibits all funds avail-
 able to the CIA, the Defense Depart-
 ment, and all other U.S. agencies in-
 volved in intelligence activities from
 being obligated or expended for the
 purpose or which would have the
 effect of supporting, directly or indi-
 rectly, military or paramilitary oper-
 ations in Nicaragua by any national
 group, organization, movement, or in-
 dividual. That is the ? language in the
 Boland amendment.-
 It is clear to the point, that, as best
 this Senator can determine, it does the
 job it must do. It prohibits all funding
 of all activities that would support
 military operations in Nicaragua. That
 law includes, but specifically is not
 limited to, and that is my point, fund-
 ing of the army commonly known as
 the Contras or, as some people call
 them, the freedom fighters.
 My first concern about the pending
 amendment is that while it prohibits
 funds above the amount that it au-
 thorizes from being provided to the
 democratic resistance in Nicaragua, it
 does not prohibit U.S. ? funds from
 being used in other ways to support or
 to conduct military operations in Nica-
 ragua.
 I see only one way to read this
 amendment.   Unlike   the   Boland
 amendment, it would allow the CIA to
 conduct independent paramilitary op-
 erations in Nicaragua. In other words,
 it seems clear that what is not prohib-
 ited is, in effect, authorized. That is-
 the lesson we have learned over the
 past 2 years as we struggled to legis-
 late and limit some of these covert op-
 erations. Nothing in the Senator's
 amendment before us limits U.S. funds
 from being used to conduct covert
 military operations in Nicaragua.
 What I would like to know is, is that
 the intent of the amendment of the
 Senator from Georgia? If not, how
 does this amendment deal with the
 funds. available to the CIA in its con-
 tingency reserve to conduct such oper-

 ations absent a distinct prohibition
 against such operations?
 Mr. NUNN. The question my friend
 raises is one I have struggled with a
 great deal in preparing this amend-
 ment and redrafting it and discussing
 it with others who are my cosponsors
 of this amendment. I know the Sena-
 tor from Indiana has looked very care-
 fully at this. His staff and my staff
 have worked "together. It is a compli-
 cated area.
 Let me see if I can answer it in a way
 that is understood.
 . This amendment deals only with the
 question of providing assistance to the
 Contras.
 The Senator has raised the matter
 of unilateral action by the CIA in Cen-
 tral America that is not related to the
 assistance to the Contras. In my opin-
 ion, that must be dealt with under ex-
 isting law. Under existing law, Nicara-
 ? gua would be like any other country.
 It would be regulated by the laws and
 procedures governing the intelligence
 community. There would be congres-
 sional oversight by the Intelligence
 Committee. It would require a finding
 by the President that would be sent to
 the Intelligence Committee.
 Let me go a little further, and I will
 come back to that.
 With respect to the assistance to the
 Contras, I would say this amendment
 is absolutely clear that whether they
 used the contingency reserve funds or
 not, the CIA could not provide human-
 itarian  beyond  the  scope  of  this
 amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 time of the Senator has expired.
 Mr. PELL. I yield an additional 5
 minutes.
 Mr. NUNN. It is also my feeling, my
 strong feeling., that if the CIA wished
 to provide any further assistance to
 the Contras, the President would have
 to come back to the Senate under the
 provisions of this amendment and re-
 quest the assistance, and we would
 have to approve it in the pertinent
 committees and also on the floor.
 Now, regarding the unilateral action
 by the CIA which is not in support of
 the Contras directly or indirectly-
 which is the Senator's question. I
 think it is a very legitimate question.
 Let me read the Boland amendment
 to the Senator, because his question
 presumes that the Boland amendment
 precludes that kind of assistance. I
 think that is the understanding of a
 lot of people.
 I think the question of whether the
 Boland  amendment  precludes  that
 kind of activity by the CIA is a much
 more difficult question.
 Reading the Boland amendment, it
 says, "No funds available to the Cen-
 tral Intelligence Agency, the Depart-
 ment of Defense, or any other agency
 or entity of the United States involved
 in intelligence activities may be obli-
 gated or expended--I want the Sena-
 tor to listen carefully to these words-
 "for the purpose or which would have
 the effect"-and now the key word 'in
 my opinion legally-"of supporting-
 directly or indirectly, any military or
 paramilitary" operations in Nicaragua
 and so on.
 Mr. President, it is my view that if
 the word "supporting" is interpreted
 broadly, then we could perhaps strain
 the Boland amendment and say that
 CIA activity totally unrelated to the
 Contras but which was adverse to the
 Nicaraguan Government would be pre-
 cluded. I do not read the Boland
 amendment that way, though. I read
 the Boland amendment as being more
 narrow than that. I do not believe the
 present Boland .amendment precludes
 independent CIA activity that is not
 supporting the Contras.
 So, if you read the Boland amend-
 ment narrowly, as I do, then there is
 no diminution of that amendment in
 our amendment. If, on the other hand,
 you  read  the  Boland  amendment
 broadly and believe that the present
 Boland amendment precludes inde-
 pendent CIA activity that has nothing
 whatsoever to do with supporting the
 Contras, then our. amendment would
 change the Boland amendment. It
 would be my intent to change the
 Boland amendment if it is broad.
 Let me give an example. For in-
 stance, let us suppose tomorrow morn-
 ing, before we pass anything, our intel-
 ligence community comes in and in-
 forms the President of the United
 States that there is a terrorist training
 base in Nicaragua and those terrorists
 are funneling all over Central Amer-
 ica. They are coming to the United
 States, they are carrying out bomb-
 ings, they are carrying out assassina-
 tions, and it has nothing whatsoever
 to do with the Contra movement, and
 the CIA or the Defense Department
 recommends that we take some type
 of action against that base. If you read
 the Boland amendment broadly, then
 it would preclude that action unless
 the President came to Congress and
 we had a debate and unless the House
 and the Senate repealed the Boland
 amendment. '
 I do not believe that is what the
 Boland amendment intended. But if it
 is what it intended, I think it ought to
 be repealed. If it is not what it intend-
 ed, then we do not change the intent
 of the Boland amendment.
 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I think
 what the Boland amendment is seek-
 ing to do is stop activities like the
 mining of harbors. Again, this is an in-
 dependent activity, undertaken basi-
 cally without the consent of Congress,
 by the Central Intelligence Agency.
 Under  the  Senator's  amendment;
 would the CIA be able to do that kind
 of activity
 Mr. NUNN. The answer is no, be-
 cause I would interpret the mining of
 harbors as in direct support of the
 Contras.
 Mr. HARKIN. But is was not done in
 support of the Contras; that is the
 point. My position is that it lifts the
 restrictions of the Boland amendment.
 However, I might be opposed to the
 Senator's  amendment  here,  I  am
 greatly opposed to it if, in fact, we do
 not have two things-one, the Boland
 amendment which again, aside from
 the Contras itself, would restrict the
 kind of activities that the Boland
 amendment sought to restrict. I think
 most people here and on the other
 side of the Capitol have interpreted it
 very broadly-I ask for 2 or 3 more
 minutes. I am sorry to take so much
 time.
 Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I yield 2
 more minutes to the Senator.
 Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.
 Mr. President, I have one more ques-
 tion.
 Mr. NUNN. Would the Senator in-
 terpret the Boland amendment as pre-
 cluding a CIA or it Pentagon move
 against the terrorist training camp in
 Nicaragua?
 Mr. HARKIN. That was exporting
 the terrorism outside the borders of
 Nicaragua?
 Mr. NUNN. Yes.
 Mr. HARKIN. No, Mr. President.
 Mr. NUNN. Then the Senator does
 not have to be concerned about this.
 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am
 concerned because obviously, that is a
 very narrow interpretation, but I keep
 saying again in terms of the CIA, what
 we have learned over the past few
 years is that what is not prohibited is
 authorized and if we. do not prohibit
 them from doing certain things, they
 will go off on their own and do mining,
 for instance. If there is a terrorist
 camp there, they have recourse. They
 can come-to the Intelligence Commit-
 tees and ask for authorization.
 Mr. NUNN. They cannot if the
 Boland  amendment,  is  interpreted
 broadly. The Intelligence Committee
 'cannot do or approve anything contra-
 vening the law of the country.
 Mr. HARKIN.. The Boland amend-
 ment speaks only to the purpose of
 overthrowing the Government. If you
 were to go in and take out a terrorist
 camp that was expporting terrorism
 outside of Nicaragua, that would not
 have the purpose of overthrowing the
 Government of Nicaragua. Mining the
 harbors would.
 Mr. NUNN. Nothing in the Boland
 amendment  ever  mentioned  over-
 throwing the Government.
 I know I have taken the Senator's
 time, Mr. President.
 Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have
 one other question. 'Leaving aside this
 question of what the term "humani-
 tarian" assistance encompasses, the
 amendment  would  authorize  funds
 and then prohibit further materiel as-
 sistance but not preclude the sharing
 of intelligence information. My ques-
 tion again concerns what is not includ-
 ed in a prohibition against further ma-
 teriel assistance and what role would
 be created for the CIA in addition to
 the sharing of intelligence informa-
 tion. It is my understanding that if hu-
 manitarian assistance were to be ap-
 proved and the Boland amendment

 were in effect, the Contras could re-
 ceive the funds but the CIA would not
 be back in the business of running the
 Contra  war.  Without  the  Boland
 amendment, the Senator's. amendment
 would allow the CIA to resume its role
 in advising and training the Contras
 for combat operations and would put
 us back in the business of managing
 this war.
 Again, I ask, Is this the Senator's in-
 tention?
 Mr. PELL. I yield time so the Sena-
 tor from Georgia may reply.
 Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I say to
 the Senator that is not this Senator's
 intention. I think the amendment is
 clear. As I interpret the amendment,
 and I think it is clear on that, humani-
 tarian assistance would not include
 training the Contras for military activ-
 ity.
 The Senator has used the word "ad-
 vising." He say "advising and train-
 ing."
 Mr. HARKIN. Advising, training.
 Mr.  NUNN.  I  would  think  the
 amendment presumes somebody in our
 Government is going to advise the
 Contras of certain things. Hopefully,
 they will advise them to negotiate bi-
 laterally with the Sandinistas. Hope-
 fully, they will advise them to purge
 their ranks of human rights abusers,
 but not give military advice.
 . Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, not
 giving military advice or training.
 Mr. NUNN. That would not be in
 keeping with the humanitarian defini-
 tion of the amendment.
 Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend
 from Georgia for clearing that up with
 me.
 Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President; will
 the Senator from Indiana yield me 6
 minutes?
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I agreed
 to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from
 South Carolina first and I shall be
 happy to yield to the Senator from
 Louisiana when he has concluded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from South Carolina.
 Mr. THURMOND. I thank the Sena-
 tor from Indiana.
 Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I
 rise in support ' of the Nunn, Lugar,
 Boren amendment.
 What we are debating here today is
 not a question of right versus left. It
 concerns freedom: freedom from tyr-
 anny and oppression, freedom of reli-
 gion, freedom of the press, and the
 freedom of people to determine what
 form  their  government  shall  take
 gather than have that decision dictat-
 ed by a handful of despots. The
 United States has fought numerous
 times to protect these freedoms, and
 today we are debating whether or not
 to support people who want to fight
 for the same freedoms.
 We have boiled the argument down
 to whether or not-to give these free-
 dom fighters humanitarian aid, or no
 aid at all, when we should be providing
 them with the military assistance that
 they so badly need. I for one am glad
 that Lafayette did not come to Amer-
 ica with only humanitarian aid to pro-
 vide for our Continental Army, or we
 might still be British subjects.
 It is unfortunate that some Mem-
 bers of Congress serve as apologists for
 a Communist dictatorship that offers
 to let the Soviets station missiles in
 their country and which also attempts
 to subvert neighboring states by force
 of arms.
 Mr. President, the United States
 stood by as the Sandinistas came to
 power with their promises of free elec-
 tions, freedom of religion, and free-
 dom of the press. They have instead
 formed a dictatorship that makes a
 mockery of these freedoms. Because of
 their repressive practices, people have
 again taken up arms against the gov-
 ernment, and now more men are fight-
 ing the Sandinista government than
 ever bore arms against the previous
 regime.          -
 There are those who would have us
 believe that the Contras are the cre-
 ,ation  of  the                                                             Central  Intelligence
 Agency, and that everything would be
 fine in Nicaragua if we would halt our
 support for the Contras. This asser-
 tion is totally false; 15,000 people do
 not risk their lives and the lives of
 their families fighting a dictatorship
 just to help out the CIA. The last time
 I checked, the CIA was not that popu-
 lar in developing areas of the world.
 Also, there are no retirement benefits
 for the Contras, and there is little or
 no pay; so other than the hope of a
 better way of life, there is not any
 reason for these men and women to
 take the risks that they do.
 Mr. President, when we strip away
 all the arguments, we come to one
 simple decision. We can support forces
 who oppose Communist dictatorships,
 or we can vouchsafe the spread of
 communism by our inaction. Twenty-
 four years ago, in his inaugural ad-
 dress, President John F.  Kennedy
 stated:
 Let every nation know, whether it wishes
 us well or ill, that we shall pay any price,
 bear any burden, meet any hardship, sup-
 port any friend, oppose any foe to assure
 the survival and the success of liberty.
 Mr.  President,  unfortunately  for
 some, the price has grown too high,
 the burden too heavy, and the hard-
 ship too great for our Nation to sup-
 port the survival of liberty. For some,
 the continued enslavement of people is
 somehow preferable to our becoming
 involved. Not only this, the failure to
 provide  assistance  to  the  freedom
 fighters would constitute a threat to
 our own freedom.
 Mr. President, I urge .all of my col-
 leagues to support continued assist-
 ance to the Nicaraguan freedom fight-
 ers.
 Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield to me 6 minutes?
 Mr. LUGAR. Yes; I yield 6 minutes
 to the Senator from Louisiana.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr.
 GRAMM). The Senator from Louisiana
 is recognized.
 Mr.  JOHNSTON.  Mr.  President,
 when Fidel Castro was in the moun-
 tains of Cuba, he called himself an
 agrarian reformer pursuing democracy
 and a friend of the United States. It
 took us a few months after he took
 over to find out that was not to be.
 Mr. President, there are those who,
 in spite of the evidence, indelible evi-
 dence since 1979 of the nature of the
 Sandinista revolution, would want to
 tell us that they also are agrarian re-
 formers pursuing the rights of the
 people, trying to improve the lot of
 the people.
 Mr. President, if there is not enough
 evidence now, I do not know when
 there will ever be as to the essential
 nature of the Sandinista revolution.
 They are bent upon revolution with-
 out borders. They are bent upon ex-
 porting that revolution to El Salvador,
 as they are doing at the very moment.
 The command and control of the
 FMLN  in  El  Salvador  is  at  this
 moment in Nicaragua, and so is the di-
 rection of other revolutionary activity
 which has been stopped, if at all, only
 by the pressure of the Contras.
 Now, Mr. President, lest we think
 that a poor country of about 4 million
 people in Central America can do no
 harm, I would like for the Senate to
 stop for a moment and consider the
 harm that Cuba does throughout the
 world with only a population of 10 mil-
 lion. Even though Cuba is a very poor
 nation, with a gross domestic product
 of $16 billion, at the very bottom of
 the list in terms of wealth of nations-
 and in 1950 before the revolution it
 had the 3d highest per capita income
 in Latin America, now it is 15th-Mr.
 President, what that small country is
 able to do in terms of harm through-
 out the world is amazing. They have
 an armed force of 153,000, 250 aircraft,
 850 heavy tanks, with defense expendi-
 tures of $1.3 billion.
 Even though Canada has two and
 one-half times the population, they
 have five times the armed force of
 Canada. With their militia, they have
 12 percent of their population armed
 and trained and under arms. There are
 74,000 Cuban troops in 24 foreign
 countries. Consider what they do in
 Angola alone-16 motorized infantry
 regiments, an artillery regiment, an
 antiaircraft defense brigade, 500 air
 force personnel, 500 support troops,
 and 1,000 advisers. In Angola alone, a
 total of 31,000 men. They have suf-
 fered 6,200 casualties in Angola.
 Mr. President, the list of countries
 where they have troops includes:
 Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Benin, Cape
 Verdes,     Congo-Brazzaville,     Ethiopia,
 Guinea,     Guinea-Bissau,   Iraq, Lesotho,
 Libya, Malagasi, Mozambique, Nicaragua,
 Nigeria, Sao Tome/Principe, Sierra Leone,
 Suriname, Syria, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen,
 and Zambia.
 Mr. President, this is the reality of
 Cuba today. They continue to grow in
 terms of arms expenditure and in

 terms of exporting revolution around
 the world.
 There was a time when we had an
 opportunity,  Mr.  President,  to do
 something about the Cuban infection.
 Many will say that we should have
 done something about it in the time of
 Batista. and I agree. We made serious
 and terrible mistakes at that time.
 Those  mistakes  we  cannot  recall.
 There were other times when we had
 an opportunity to do something about
 Cuba, and we failed to do it-too little,
 too late, too ineffectively.
 Mr. President, that time in Nicara-
 gua is upon us today. We have an op-
 portunity to do something about Nica-
 ragua, something other than to put
 our head in the sand, something other
 than involving American troops. It is
 to put a sure and steady pressure on
 the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, using
 their own people who have formed
 their own opposition force.
 Make no mistake about it, the. CIA
 did not create and did not form the
 Contra organizations. They are en-
 demic. They are native. They are run
 by their own people. Indeed, we are
 not at this time giving aid.
 Mr. President, we have an opportu-
 nity to strike a middle ground in this
 amendment, a middle ground between
 giving arms and sending American.
 troops, on the one hand, and inviting
 the Nicaraguan-Sandinista revolution
 to  become  another  Cuba-another
 Cuba, perhaps smaller in terms of
 numbers of people but, a Cuba con-
 nected by a land bridge to Mexico and
 the United States.
 Mr. President, the middle ground as
 indicated in this amendment is the
 proper course for. this Senate at this
 time. There may be a time when we
 will need to take a second step and
 send the arms themselves, but for now
 this compromise is the right action.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who
 yields time?
 Mr. PELL. I yield 3 minutes to the
 Senator from Maryland.
 Mr. MATHIAS. Mr. President, sever-
 al Senators this afternoon have re-
 ferred to a national consensus in favor
 of this or that policy. They have re-
 ferred to this or that poll. They have
 referred to the state of public opinion
 on American policy toward the critical
 problems of Nicaragua and Central
 'America.
 It is clear to me, however, that there
 is no national consensus on what
 might be the most effective policy. In
 fact, if anything, the polls underline a
 deep and enduring confusion about
 our policies and purposes. So clear is
 this that I feel confident in saying
 that we lack the depth of public sup-
 port to sustain the kind, of dramatic
 shift in our foreign policy that seems
 to be taking place.
 It is also clear to me that a sea-
 change in our policy toward Nicaragua
 is taking place. Though the adminis-
 tration's appeal for more funds is
 couched. in terms of "humanitarian"
 aid. I see no guarantee that these
 money would not continue to be used
 directly to support, or replace other
 funds to support, military and para-
 military  activities  by  the  Contras.
 There is virtually no way that you
 could impose such a guarantee.
 Originally, the Senate approved
 funds for the Contras on the grounds
 that they would be used to block the
 flow of arms to rebels trying to over-
 throw the Government of El Salva-
 doran objective that has in large
 measure been attained. Now we are
 coming close to open support for the
 .overthrow of the Government of Nica-
 ragua-a policy that I do not believe
 shares the support of the American
 people, nor one that is warranted by
 the limited diplomatic efforts under-
 taken to reach a peaceful solution to
 these problems, nor one that has won
 the backing of many of our most im-
 portant allies in the region and the
 rest of the world. By-region, I do not
 mean just the immediate region of
 Central America.
 Several of the governments in the
 immediate area generally support the
 administration's overall efforts, but
 they also are disturbed by lack of dip-
 lomatic progress. But there are many
 other countries in the broader region
 of  Latin  America  with  whom  we
 should consult more closely as we try
 to devise a prudent and positive policy.
 I have consulted with a wide range
 of representatives of the leading coun-
 tries of Latin America. And these in-
 quiries - reveal  considerable  doubt
 about the shift in American policy in
 recent weeks and months.
 For example, our friends in the Con-
 tadora countries, Colombia, Venezuela,
 Mexico, and Panama,. do not appear to
 favor this kind of aid to the Contras,
 which they regard as direct interven-
 tion in the affairs of Nicaragua. Ar-
 gentina, Brazil and other vital neigh-
 bors of ours, countries destined to
 become ever more important to us,
 also remain deeply concerned about
 the thrust of these policies.
 With their domestic political and
 economic problems, all these countries
 are likely to be more deeply affected
 by what may happen in Central Amer-
 ica than we are. And yet I see no sign
 that we have consulted closely with
 them in devising an effective strategy.
 I see no sign, furthermore, that we
 have consulted closely with our Euro-
 pean allies on the best course of
 action.
 There are, Mr. President, several at-
 tractive provisions of this amendment:
 the call for a church-mediated dialog
 between the Government of Nicaragua
 and the resistance forces; continued
 support for the Contadora process. I
 am still confident that a genuine com-
 promise can be worked out. But I do
 not believe we have reached the point
 where we should take an irrevocable
 step that would discourage such initia-
 tives and lead to a widening of hosti-
 lites.
 For  these  reasons,  I  shall  vote
 against the amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who
 yields time?
 ' Mr. LUGAR. I yield 2 minutes to the
 Senator from, Minnesota.
 Mr.  DURENBERGER.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, , I compliment the original co-
 sponsors of this amendment, on the
 amendment itself and the work they,
 have put into it. I believe I am a co-
 sponsor as well.
 I compliment the cosponsors on the
 special effort they have made in in-
 forming themselves in particular with
 regard to the special problems of Cen-
 tral America and the way in which
 those problems have changed over the
 4 years or so in which we have been
 deeply involved in those problems and
 in discussing them on the floor.
 I particularly compliment the Mem-
 bers of the minority party on the floor
 for their efforts.'
 I urge all Members to support this
 amendment. It is not great policy. It is
 mainly implementation of a policy
 which remains vague.
 Mr. President, I have just returned
 from a 6-day trip to Central America. I
 went because I am convinced that this
 is a critical moment in relations with
 Central America. I wanted to under-
 stand the perspective of the leaders of
 the region on the major issues.
 In the course of the trip, I met with
 a wide variety of people. I talked with.
 our own Embassy staffs. I met with
 political  leaders  and  shared  their
 hopes for a democratic future. I talked
 to military leaders. l[ exchanged ideas
 with business leaders. I talked to pub-
 lishers, churchmen, and people work-
 ing for international organizations in
 these countries.
 In all of these conversations, I found
 a common theme-an absolute com-
 mitment to the development of democ-
 racy throughout the region, and a
 common demonstration of courage to
 take risks necessary to achieve that
 goal.
 In Guatemala, Chief of State Gener-
 al Mejia has put the reputation of the
 military on the line in avowing public-
 ly, without reservation, that he will
 step down from office and remove the
 Army  from  the  political  process-
 whatever the results of the election in
 October.
 In El Salvador, President Duarte has
 assumed not only personal risks, but
 risk to the democratic ideals of his
 party by taking firm steps in curbing
 human rights violations, returning the

 Mr. President, there is a common
 concern expressed by these political,
 religious, military and business lead-
 ers. It is a concern that. there are root
 causes of instability in the region
 which are threats to achievement of
 democracy. One root cause is the eco-
 nomic difficulty each country faces
 from an ever widening gap between
 revenues and expenditures-a balance-
 of-payments crisis' that stands in the
 way of social programs and reestab-
 lishment of a healthy business sector
 which can create jobs andrelieve the
 burden of an over-extended govern-
 ment.
 There is instability' caused by the in-
 security of the governments faced
 with active attempts at subversion=
 subversion supported directly from or
 through Nicaragua.
 There is instability caused. by the.
 added burden of refugees created by
 the current political upheaval-refu-
 gees who exacerbate the economic
 problem and increase, the threat of
 subversion.  There  are  now  over
 100,000 Nicaraguans' in Costa. Rica-
 about 10 percent of the population as
 estimated by the U.N. Refugee Com-
 mission. In the last. 3 months, 10,000
 Nicaraguans have turned up in Guate-
 mala. This is the first time. Guatemala
 has had a refugee influx from Nicara-
 gua.
 These are regional problems-prob-
 lems that cannot be resolved individ-
 ually by each nation. The leadership
 of  Central America is  expectant-
 hopeful that the United States will
 join with them In working toward so-
 lutions. The United States has already
 done a great deal. The Jackson plan is
 a clear signal that the United States
 recognizes that the region is of vital
 interest and that we alone have the
 means which if applied in concert with
 the Central American countries. can
 tip the balance in favor of democracy.
 But the solutions are not regional
 alone. They depend as well on keeping,
 alive the hope for democracy in Nica-
 ragua. Mr. President, the money being
 discussed here today, $38 million for
 humanitarian aid to the democratic re-
 sistance, is not in, and of itself suffi-
 cient to tip the balance. It is not, di-
 rected. at balancing the books economi-
 cally-nor is it sufficient to stop. sub-
 version in the. region or to restore to
 Nicaragua the democracy stolen by,
 the military dictatorship which the
 Sandinistas have imposed' in exact. du-
 plication of the old Somoza dictator-
 ship..
 But. our vote is. of great significance
 as a sign of Central America that the
 U.S. Government, both executive and
 legislative,  recognizes the role our
 country should play, and' are willing to
 assume that role. The democrats who
 recognize that the Sandinista govern-
 ment has as its fundamental objective
 imposition of 'a dictatorship which, is a
 threat to the hopes for democracy are
 pursuing those principles' throughout
 Central America at. great. personal
 'risk. We share that risk in a positive
 vote on. this assistance because we, are.
 not sure who the real democrats are
 and how this funding, is really contrib-
 uting to achieving a democracy with
 Nicaragua. Though this vote is neces-
 sary to show our resolve. and' commit-
 ment,, it is. not enough. We cannot
 close the subject with a symbol-a.
 symbol the ultimate effect, of which is
 unknown.
 Mr. President,. we must move on to
 the bigger issue of peace and' stability
 in the region and work at the. highest
 levels in conjunction with the demo-
 cratic nations to forge a common. for-
 mula-a  policy  of  commitment  of
 American means, American knowledge
 and resources in support of mutually
 shared. objectives. Only then will we
 resolve  the  root  cause  of. trouble
 within the region.
 The narrow issue we face today is
 short-term humanitarian assistance to
 people from one country. The stakes
 are high, but they are high as much
 for reasons of symbolism as for mate-
 rial progress. We must move beyond
 debating whether to symbolically ful-
 fill our commitments' to democracy,
 and instead undertake a, debate on ae-
 tally  fulfilling  those  commitments
 themselves. In other words,, the debate
 today will not end our, attention to
 Central America. It will only set the
 stage for a larger debate on a larger'
 policy question-whether this country
 will play a positive role in the region.
 We cannot go it. alone. We must
 work with the nations of Central
 America, and must listen to them and
 learn from them. As a first step
 toward bringing about, the -reconcilia-
 tion which must precede significant,
 progress on economic and political
 questions, I think it is time for the
 President to convene a meeting: of the
 heads of state of all the countries in
 the region, including Nicaragua. A.
 major conference could' bolster, the
 Contadora process. President. Duarte
 has. shown, us the way, and, we should
 S7641
 seek to do on a regional scale what he
 has undertaken in his own, country.
 But talk is not. enough'. The history
 of Central America is a history of talk
 and broken promises from the United
 States. We must demonstrate that our
 long.-term. commitment to the region is
 backed. by the public and its Congress.
 A tangible sign 'would be immediate
 consideration and passage of the Jack-
 son plan in a multiyear package. It. is
 time to go beyond debating, economi-
 cally  marginal  programs,  whether
 they involve humanitarian assistance
 or other items, and do what we all
 know must be done.
 Beyond these immediate programs,
 'however, we must learn to live with di-
 versity in the 'region. A commitment to
 democracy does not mean that every
 nation must look like ours. So long as
 a nation's core values involve a com.-
 mitment to the democratic process, we
 should welcome it as a. friend, not
 shun it because of some kind of ideo-
 logical litmus test. Policy disagree-
 ments among democracies . are ulti-
 mately far less' important than their
 adherence to common.. values.
 Finally, we must recognize that it is
 in Central America Itself that the
 greatest wisdom resides about the
 future of that region. We can, help;
 but we cannot lead, except by exam-
 ple. We must look to Central Ameri-
 can unity and leadership to set the,
 course. This means on one, hand' that
 we must ask leaders in the region to
 say publicly what they say privately.
 But it means on the other hand that
 we must give them the confidence' to
 say it, in part by assuring them that
 we. will assist them over the long haul.
 Mr. President, as I have said so
 many times before, the real issue
 which we too often avoid Is Central
 America  and  its'  future-a  future
 which will be shaped by far more than
 the narrow item we, debate today. I
 strongly believe that we must vote to
 provide the humanitarian ? assistance
 requested. But I also believe that we
 must break the habit of reducing a
 vital and complex issue to a simple yes
 or no vote on a few million dollars
 aimed at an immediate issue. We must
 begin to craft a larger policy, and then
 to debate It. If we fail in this, we will
 condemn ourselves to- years of debates
 over issues of this kind.
 Mr. PELL.. Mr. President, I yiel'd' 5
 minutes to the Senator from Michi-
 gan.
 Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator
 from Rhode Island.
 Mr. President, I wonder if the Sena-
 tor from Georgia might. help me in my
 effort to understand.this language..
 I have been one who has been will-
 ing to support the Contras with non-
 lethal assistance under certain condi-
 tions. In the past, I' have worked' on
 various forms of resolutions which
 would provide nonlethal assistance to
 the Contras and set forth the condi-
 tions. I do commend all the people

 S 7642                     CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 who have been involved in drafting
 this amendment for their efforts.
 I am troubled, however, by section
 (i)(1), and I ask the Senator from
 Georgia  about  that  section. The
 amendment repeals the Boland lan-
 guage. The Boland language prohibits
 assistance to the Contras, directly or
 indirectly, by the CIA, the DOD, or
 any other agency. So that this amend-
 ment wipes out the Boland language.
 In its place is section (i)(1), which
 says that "No other materiel assist-
 ance may be provided to, the Nicara-
 guan democratic resistance, directly or
 indirectly," other than what has al-
 ready been set forth in this amend-
 ment, and that is the humanitarian as-
 sistance as defined.
 The word "materiel" is a very trou-
 bling word to me, because it could
 mean that nonmateriel military assist-
 ance could be provided: for example,
 support activities; for example, train-
 ing-which is not materiel but which is
 directly in support of a military oper-
 ation.
 I did hear the answers. of the Sena-
 tor from Georgia to the questions of
 Senator HARKIN, and I thought they
 were helpful; but I am afraid that the
 language in the amendment is differ-
 ent from the assurances which were
 given., I wish that the assurances
 which my friend gave were put forth
 so clearly in the amendment.
 I suppose my question is this: It says
 "No other materiel assistance." Train-
 ing of a military operation is nonma-
 teriel assistance. Is it intended that
 training would be prohibited? If so, is
 there a way of making that clear in
 the amendment-that training in mili-
 tary support activities is intended to
 be prohibited?
 Mr. NUNN. I say to the Senator
 from Michigan that the reason why
 the word "materiel" was added-and it
 was added; it was not part of the origi-
 nal amendment-was that if we do not
 have that word, there is a strong possi-
 bility that other legitimate actions by
 the United States would be precluded
 that might be considered indirect as-
 sistance to the democratic resistance,
 and thus barred. Let me give the Sena-
 tor an example.
 'If we insist in the context of the
 Contadora negotiation that. Sandinis-
 tas should talk to the Contras, as I
 think all of us believe they should, it
 could be argued if the word "materiel"
 was not in there, that we were assist-
 ing the Contras because one of their
 objects is to force talks directly with
 the Sandinistas.
 So the word "materiel" was added to
 ,prevent that interpretation.
 The Senator has raised the other
 question, the other side of the coin.
 Every word you add is a coin that has
 two sides. I think the Senator has a le-
 gitimate question.The Senator's ques-
 tion is, Does that word "materiel"
 mean only substance, something tangi-
 ble, or would it include things like
 military assistance?
 My view of it is that as the author of
 the amendment, and I think the Sena-
 tor from Indiana ought to listen to
 this, too, I would like for him to re-
 spond. My view is that materiel assist-
 ance would include any kind of mili-
 tary training, even though 'that would
 not necessarily be tangible. I consider
 that military training is tangible in
 the sense that this amendment has
 been offered. I think that if this
 passes we need to find a better word in
 conference to make it clearer that we
 are allowing certain types of activities
 on behalf of the Contras, political
 speeches, that kind of thing, petitions
 to OAS, petitions to the Contadora
 process, to include them in the talks
 with Sandinistas, but we are not by
 that word in any way implying that we
 intend to have military training or
 other intangible things. I would like
 the Senator from Indiana to respond.
 Mr. LUGAR. That is my understand-
 ing.
 Mr. LEVIN. Could I ask about mili-
 tary support activities, for instance,
 driving the boat for which Contras
 leave to set mines?
 Mr. NUNN. I believe that. would be
 violative of the amendment. It is not
 humanitarian. It is support of military
 activities. I think it would be preclud-
 ed under the amendment. Would the
 Senator from Indiana answer?
 Mr. LUGAR. I concur.
 Mr. LEVIN. I am glad to get these
 interpretations and I think they are
 important.
 Mr. NUNN. But I would not want to
 have the words "military support"
 written in because then you have to
 ask what the definition is and the Sen-
 ator asks with an example. If you in-
 clude "military support" as food, and
 clothing which is in the nature of mili-
 tary support under some interpreta-
 tions then clearly we permit that.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 time yielded to the Senator from
 Michigan has expired.
 Mr. LEVIN. If there is an additional
 time I wish 1 minute.
 Mr.  PELL.  I  yield  1  additional
 minute.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Michigan may proceed.
 Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.
 I think it would be extremely useful
 if this amendment passes, which I
 expect it would, that this, interpreta-
 tion which is critical if we are going to
 eliminate  the  Boland  language  be
 taken to conference. I frankly do not
 know how I am going to vote on this
 amendment in light of the interpreta-
 tion of the sponsor.
 The words "materiel assistance" to
 me means what it says, which is provi-
 sion of materiels. Support services are
 not materiels. Training is not materi-
 els.
 Mr. NUNN. But you know the word.
 "materiel" can be taken in two con-
 texts. The Senator I think is using the
 narrow definition of materiel, meaning
 substance or meaning something tan-
 gible. Materiel can also mean some--
 thing of significance, important, and I
 would interpret the word "materiel"
 here in a broader context, not in the
 narrow context.
 Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.
 Mr. NUNN. I assure the Senator
 that word will be looked at carefully if
 this amendment passes. I am not going
 to be in conference but I know the
 Senator from Indiana will give his
 pledge on that.
 Mr. LEVIN. I thank you both Sena-
 tors very much.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 1
 minute to the Senator from Califor-
 nia.
 Mr. WILSON. Mr. President, I rise
 only to say that '[ will support this
 measure and would ask that I be
 added as a cosponsor.
 Mr. President, I will be offering an-
 other other amendment later on. I do not
 find what I will be offering in any way
 incompatible with the present amend-
 ment. In fact, whether it is in it or not
 they will achieve some of the same
 purposes.
 Mr. President, I urge support and
 passage of the amendment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out objection, the Senator is added as
 a cosponsor.
 Who yields time?
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 1
 minute to the Senator from Kansas.
 Mrs. KASSEBAUM Mr. President,
 the key problem facing us in our
 policy toward Nicaragua is how we can
 help produce a political solution for
 the- present confrontation between
 Nicaraguans and between the Govern-
 ment of Nicaragua and the United
 States.
 I do not believe that this confronta-
 tion                                                                                         can  be  resolved  by  military
 means-whether by the actions of the
 Contras or by direct intervention of
 the United States.
 Neither do I believe that we can
 simply turn our back and hope it all
 works out for the best. Clearly, the
 Government of Nicaragua has goals
 and policies that have produced both
 internal turmoil and external tensions
 with their neighbors. Left free to act
 as they wish, the Sandinistas very
 probably would sharply increase this
 turmoil and tension-with very serious
 consequences for Nicaragua and for
 us.
 Given all of that,'it is essential that
 we remain involved in seeking a settle-
 ment for this problem. The present
 amendment offers one course for us to
 follow, and I support it.
 However, I would like our policy and
 our intentions to be clear to every-
 one-most of all to the Sandinistas
 and the Contras.
 For our policy to have any hope of
 success, I believe it is essential for the
 Sandinistas  to  be  confronted  not
 merely with a military resistance but
 with an effective political alternative
 for the people of Nicaragua. My con-
 cern is how the present amendment

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD   SENATE.                     S 7643'
 would bring us closer to that possibili-
 ty.
 To be effective, any opposition force
 must have a claim to legitimacy in the
 eyes of Nicaraguans.. It must not. be
 seen as a throwback to the days of
 Somoza or as a puppet of American
 policy.
 This point was made very effectively
 by the Senator from Delaware during
 debate on the previous amendment..
 The point is less clear in the present
 amendment.
 This amendment calls, for but does
 not require the Contras to remove
 from their ranks those who have en-
 gaged in human. rights abuses. I hope
 that the intent. of the sponsors is that
 such action must be carried out, by the
 Contras and that a. failure to move ef-
 fectively would jeopardize any existing
 or future funding.
 Second. Mr. President,, I hope that
 the political leaders. of the Nicaraguan, opposition will have a role or voice in
 the distribution of the assistance we
 provide rather than leaving the distri-
 bution solely to military leaders.
 AID TO THE RESISTANCE. FORCES IN NICARAGUA
 Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise.
 in full support of the amendment by
 my distinguished colleagues, Senators
 NuNN, LuaAR, BoREN, BENTssN, CHILES,
 JOHNSTON,  and   KASSEBAUM.   I   am
 wholly supportive of the fine biparti-
 san manner in which this proposal has
 been drafted. This' issue is much too
 important to be reduced to partisan in-
 fighting and, pettiness.
 This amendment will accomplish a
 number of important objectives. First,.
 by resuming aid to the Nicaraguan
 democratic resistance, we continue our
 support for those individuals. who are
 pressing the Sandinistas to live up to.
 the revolutionary promises they made
 when they overthrew Somoza and his
 excesses. We cannon allow the Sandi-
 nistas  to conveniently forget their
 basic pledges to promote political', plu-
 ralism, civil liberties'. human rights,
 and a nonaligned foreign policy.
 Second,. by designating the aid to be
 used only for food, medicine, clothing,
 and other assistance for the survival
 and  well-being  of  the  opposition
 forces, we encourage steps that are
 taken for a peaceful settlement of the
 conflict.
 Third, this amendment encourages a:
 change in the behavior of the Sandi-
 nistas. We offer to. suspend the eco-
 nomic sanctions imposed upon Nicara-
 gua and to, suspend U.S. military ma-
 nuevers in Honduras and off the coast
 of Nicaragua if the Sandinistas agree
 to a cease fire, to open negotiations:
 with the opposition forces, and to sus-
 pend the state of emergency in Nicara-
 gua. By that offer we. can attempt to
 press the Sandinistas into a resolution.
 of the destructive conflict.
 Fourth, by resuming bilateral nego-
 tiations with the Sandinstas we can
 encourage church-mediated dialog be-
 tween the Sandinistas. and the demo-
 cratic resistance and  we can work
 toward a, comprehensive and verifiable
 agreement among the nations of Cen-
 tral America based upon the Conta-
 dora objectives.
 The United States must continue to
 pursue those four main objectives-ob-
 jectives which have not changed a
 whit. during the massive disinforma-
 tion campaigns of the past, several
 years. They are:
 First,. to end Nicaraguan support for
 guerrilla groups in neighboring coun
 tries and retract their stated. goal of a.
 "revolution without. borders";
 Second, to sever Nicaraguan military
 and security ties to Cuba, and the
 Soviet Union;.
 Third, tp' reduce Nicaragua's mili-
 tary forces to levels, that would restore
 military equilibrium to the region; and.
 Fourth, to fulfill the original Sandi-
 nista promises. to support democratic
 pluralism and respect. for human and
 civil rights.
 I believe that this amendment. will
 assist in setting us on the path toward
 achieving these objectives. The United
 States is in a unique position in the
 free Western World'-by virtue: of our
 continuing  efforts,  to  bring  peace
 throughout the international commu-
 nity, and our geographic proximity to
 the region-to play a. key role in at-
 tempting to restore stability through-
 out Central, America..
 Our own tradition of democracy im-
 poses upon us a duty to do all that. we.
 are able in order to break the. endless
 cycle of poverty, political instability,
 and revolution, and to attempt to re-
 store                                                     some  measure.  of  economic,
 health and real political freedom.
 We cannon simply ignore the si,tua
 tion and' hope that: it will', improve
 without our help-even if we could
 assume that Cuba and the. Soviet
 Union would take a similar "hands-
 off" posture. We must decide not
 whether-but how best-to exercise.
 most responsibly and fairly the duty
 that our position and stature in the.
 world has thrust upon us..
 I would urge my colleagues to sup-
 port this amendment. I believe it. is, a.
 balanced compromise which allows us
 to pursue peaceful negotiations with
 the Sandinistan government, while, at
 the 'same moment, it allows us to lend
 our tangible support, to those who
 fight for freedom, democracy,. civil lib-
 erties, and a lasting peace.
 Mr. CHILES. Mr. President, I rise to
 support the amendment of the Sena-
 tor from Georgia.. At this point, there
 are few more critical, tasks for Ameri-
 can foreign policy than creating a
 more secure Central America and deg
 fuzing the explosive militarization of
 the region.. I believe that this amend-
 ment offers a bridge between the un-
 certain policies of the present. and,,
 what I hope will be a more cohesive
 set of policies in the future.
 The Nicaraguan military buildup is,
 seen by its neighbors as, the single
 greatest threat. to their stability. The.
 Sandinistas claim they need this mili-
 tary force to combat the Contras. But
 we know better. The Nicaraguan milii-
 tary buildup started before the politi-
 cal opposition to, increasing. Sandinista
 dominance became a. fighting force.
 Unfortunately, this buildup, and the
 resulting responses  by  neighboring
 states, continues a dangerous: pattern
 of escalation and counterescalation.
 This pattern must be broken. But, I do
 not believe it can be broken by the
 United States simply walking away
 from the Nicaraguan resistance move-
 ment.
 The complete and' continuing with-
 drawal of U.S. support for the Nicara-
 guan resistance would not only dra-
 matically weaken our negotiating le-
 verage with Nicaragua, but it would
 also break faith with our allies and
 create potentially disastrous problems
 for neighboring states. I also believe
 that a U.S. withdrawal can only lead
 other countries in Central America to
 question our reliability as an ally.
 But  even  with  passage  of  this
 amendment, I continue to be con-
 cerned that up here, on Capitol Hill,
 and down in the executive branch, at-
 tention remains focused on the appro-
 priation of money-whether for the
 Contras or for our economic and mili-
 tary assistance programs. I have this
 feeling that the administration be-
 lieves that when the money is appro-
 priated, the job is done.
 Well, the job is not done when the
 money is. appropriated-the job only
 begins.
 There have been, and continue to be,
 critical problems in implementing our
 programs in Central America. Over
 the past year,. reports of waste and
 mismanagement in the Central Ameri-
 can aid effort have been called to our
 attention. But  we  have taken no
 action.
 We authorize billions, of dollars-2
 weeks ago we authorized $5 billion. in
 economic aid to Central America be-
 tween 1986 and 1989. But, we still do
 not seem to have a handle on the eco-
 nomic situation and needs of the coun-
 tries in the region. For example, even
 though all countries, in the region face
 severe debt crises,, only one, Costa
 Rica,. has a stabilization program, with
 the international monetary fund. Are
 we maintaining a balance between the
 actions we are taking in, order to
 secure military commitments and the,
 tougher steps needed to ensure that
 the countries in the region undertake
 the economic reforms which are essen-
 tial to their future economic stability
 and growth? I think not..
 It is' critical that this Nation shift
 the debate away from: "How much
 and under what conditions," to: "Are
 our efforts well coordinated and doing
 the things we, want them to do in the
 region." If our efforts aren't doing the
 things we want them to do, then how
 do we improve them.
 What Central America needs. is. an
 economic rebirth.. Such a rebirth will
 require economic assistance from the
 United States, and much, much more.
 Such a rebirth requires: more than.

 imagination, energy, and, most of all, a
 commitment to excellence. This kind
 of excellence  was  seen when this
 Nation committed itself to helping re-

 .grams. We need an organization that
 can integrate all of our economic and
 military  assistance  activities within
 the region-and bring more Central
 Americans into the process as well.
 We need an organization that can
 focus all of its attention on Central
 America-like the Economic Coopera-
 tion Administration did for our Euro-
 pean Aid Program under the Marshall
 plan.
 I believe this was the true intention
 of the National Bipartisan Commis-
 sion on Central America.
 I had hoped that the administration
 would review the management of its
 Central American Program over the
 past year. Unfortunately, it chose not
 to do so.
 Delay, however, may serve us well.
 Last year, my good friend, the chair-
 man of the Budget Committee [Mr.
 DOMENICI],  and I, with help from
 members and staff from the Kissinger
 Commission, drafted legislation in this
 area. But such an effort should not be
 undertaken unilaterally by the Con-
 gress. It should be worked- out jointly,
 with the executive, as was the case in
 the Marshall plan, when the White
 House,  working  closely  with  the
 Senate, accepted congressional sugges-
 tions for a single cohesive manage-
 ment structure to implement the Eu-
 ropean development effort.
 Our proposal called for the develop-
 ment of a new.mechanism to imple-
 ment the Central American effort fol-
 lowing, the same management princi-
 ples used for the Marshall plan. And I
 cannot think of another regional aid
 program as successful as the Marshall
 plan. Specifically, .this proposal would
 include:
 First, a multiyear authorization, as
 approved by the Senate in the 1986
 Foreign Assistance Act. As I said earli-
 er, the magnitude of the effort re-
 quired and the importance for the
 United States to demonstrate its re-
 solve and commitment to aiding the
 nations of Central America,  clearly-
 calls for a multiyear response.
 Second, appropriation of $6 billion
 in financial and economic aid and
 guarantees for the period between
 1986 and 1989. This would be in keep-
 ing with the National Bipartisan Com-
 mission's  recommendations,  but at
 somewhat reduced levels. I understand
 that some members of the Commission
 believe that properly managed, a $6
 billion program-some $2 billion less
 than the President's request-would
 be adequate to support the 'region's
 needs. This is below authorized levels,
 but I believe this would greatly reduce
 the likelihood of providing resources
 in excess of what can be effectively
 managed or usefully absorbed by the
 local economies. It would also reflect
 the need for restraint in Federal
 spending.
 Third, creation of a new organiza-
 tion, in the Executive Office or possi-
 bly as an independent office, which
 would be charged with overseeing and
 carrying out or Central American Aid
 Program. This Office would not dupli-
 cate existing aid mechanisms. Instead,
 it would integrate their efforts by pro-
 viding a central focal point for all gov-
 ernment   tivities in the region. The
 director othis Office would be a Pres-
 idential appointee, -subject to confir-
 mation by this body. This individual
 would be responsible 'for overseeing
 the development, justification, and
 execution of the Central American Aid
 Program. The Director of this New
 Central American Development Office
 would have the clout to effectively
 manage all our activities in the region
 and also serve as a much needed
 spokesperson before Congress on our
 activities in the region. The confirma-
 tion process would allow continued
 congressional oversight and account-
 ability for the success or failure of the
 program.
 This new organization would be sup-
 ported by an advisory board made up
 and chaired by Central Americans and
 other donor countries. The role of this
 board would be similar to the role en-
 visioned by the Kissinger Commission:
 it would advise the Director to our. Aid
 Program and issue public reports. It
 would not, however, have direct con-
 trol of U.S. aid dollars.
 This Office would not become a per-
 manent fixture. Our proposal calls for
 the Office to dissolve in 1990. This
 would help energize the organization
 and give a clear sense of timeliness to
 our aid efforts in the region. This
 again was the formula used so success-
 fully under the Marshall plan.
 Now, I've mentioned the Marshall
 plan several times-and I would like to
 say  that  this  approach ' hopefully-
 would repeat the success of the Mar-
 shall plan.
 Indeed, there are similarities in the
 two approaches.
 The nature of the response, the in-
 tensity of commitment and the man-
 agement mechanism we would pro-
 pose, all parallel that of the Marshall
 plan.
 Nonetheless, the challenges in Cen-
 tral America are quite different. The
 Marshall plan was a temporary effort
 to fill gaps caused by the wartime dis-
 ruption of an already industrial econo-
 my.In Central America, our aid effort
 will require U.S. support for political
 and social change as well.
 Let me conclude by saying that
 much work remains to be done. We
 have authorized and are likely to ap-
 propriate over $1 billion in aid to Cen-
 tral America for fiscal year 1986. But
 unless swift action is taken to improve
 the management of -this program, I
 fear this money will do little to change
 the nature of the conflict in the
 region.
 Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I
 have listened with interest to the re-
 marks of my friend, the distinguished
 ranking  minority  member  of  the
 Budget Committee. Last year, on Oc-
 tober 4, he and I had a similar discus-
 sion about the problems of implement-
 ing an effective program of economic
 aid to Central America, and some of
 the problems discussed at that time
 Those of us interested in the welfare
 of our Central American neighbors
 have had several notable achievements
 since  then.  Congress  provided  in-
 creases in economic assistance close to
 what the National Bipartisan Commis-
 sion on Central America and President
 Reagan   had  requested.  The   trade
 credit insurance program has been es-
 tablished, and links established with
 the Central. American Bank for Re-
 gional Integration. I am particularly
 proud that a program to support indig-
 enous energy development in Central
 America is now mobilized under the di-
 rection of Los Alamos National Labo-
 ratory.
 A few weeks ago the Senate author-
 ized funding for economic assistance
 to Central America on a multiyear
 basis. This was a very important rec-
 ommendation of the bipartisan com-
 mission, and I agree with Senator
 CHILES that this action demonstrates
 the 'resolve of the United States as
 well as its commitment to help the
 people of Central America.
 Despite the progress I have cited,
 implementation of the Central Ameri-
 can program continues to suffer from
 lack of unified, firm, and clear direc-
 tion. It is clear that the President and
 much of Congress support a bold and
 innovative longer term. program of
 economic and humanitarian assistance
 to Central America. It is far less clear
 that most of the civil servants who are
 charged with carrying out the pro-
 gram share the- innovation and bold-
 ness of vision that are essential. Too
 much of the program continues to be
 poured into the same old molds, and
 almost every project suffers from an
 imbalance between caution and the ur-
 gency that is needed.
 With the help of American tax dol-
 lars, the economic decline in most of
 Central America ? has been stemmed.
 That is a genuine achievement. It is
 less clear that the Central American
 nations and our aid officials have set
 in place the economic policies that will
 result in self-sustaining growth and
 development. Here too, imagination
 and leadership is needed to get these
 economies back on track.
 I would encourage senior officials in
 the executive branch to look behind
 the rhetoric to find out what is really
 going on with our economic aid pro-

 grams. If they are not satisfied, and
 there are reasons to believe they won't
 be;' then I would encourage them to
 consider establishing an office or an
 individual responsible to the President
 for overall implementation of our Cen-
 tral American economic assistance pro-
 gram. In consultation with Congress
 and subject to Senate confirmation,
 such a structure could help Americans
 account for our aid, and help Central
 Americans renew their economic de-
 velopment in an equitable manner.
 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the
 Senate has spent a great deal of timg
 debating what to do and how much to
 spend on Central America. We have
 talked about all of these great new
 programs and all the benefits we are
 going to bring to the people of the
 region. But, my good friend from Flor-
 ida is right. All we have done is au-
 thorize a great deal of money for more
 of the same.
 It's time to get on with the job of re-
 building  Central  America.  We've
 talked about the Kissinger Commis-
 sion; we've made many statements
 about bringing peace and prosperity to
 the region; but, I do not believe the
 current organizations of the executive
 branch can effectively manage all of
 our efforts in the region. We need to
 do more.
 It's time to move away from all of
 the empty sense of the Senate resolu-
 tions we are so proud of passing and
 get on with some real legislation. Sen-
 ators CHII.zs and DOMENICI have of-
 fered some new ideas in this area and.I
 hope we will have a chance to debate
 the merits of their proposal before the
 end of the year.
 The current approach of our aid
 agencies toward developing the econo-
 mies of our friends in Central America
 is too slow, too cumbersome, and, I be-
 lieve, will end in failure. Instead, we
 need to implement a new kind of aid
 program, one which will provide cap-
 ital to the entrepreneurs of the region.
 It is these entrepreneurs, developing
 new industries and new markets, that
 will help revitalize the region's econo-
 my. There is a vast market in the
 United States for goods that could be
 produced in that region that has re-
 mained untapped. If the United States
 was so willing to aid in developing and
 in providing the market, for the vari-
 ous industries in Southeast Asia over
 the past three decades, so should we
 be willing to assist in developing simi-
 lar capabilities in Central America. I
 have long felt that success toward
 righting the various wrongs existing in
 Central America will only come from
 an economic revitalization. The cur-
 rent approach won't work but empha-
 sis on the economic order could.
 Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, again
 today we find ourselves debating the
 proper direction of. U.S. policy toward
 the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.
 Again, we will have to decide-despite
 both moral objections and internation-
 al obligations, and despite the fact
 that our commitment of substantial
 resources to date has not worked-
 whether we will continue to support a -
 band of rebels whose intention is to
 overthrow a government with whom
 we maintain diplomatic relations.
 Polls show that the American people
 are understandably confused and un-
 certain about the proper direction of
 U.S. policy in Central America. But
 there is one point on which they are
 not confused: they know that despite
 what the President may say, the Nica-
 raguan Contras are not the moral
 equivalent of our Founding Fathers.
 The American people know-and we
 know-that George Washington and
 Thomas Jefferson did not cape, tor-
 ture, and terrorize-and I think Presi-
 dent Reagan should be mortified by
 mentioning  the  Contras  and  our
 Founding Fathers in the same breath.
 Mr. President, I am no apologist for
 the Sandinistas. Our differences with
 them are well known. We oppose their
 denial of basic rights and democratic
 freedoms at home and their support
 for revolution abroad. As we should
 with totalitarian regimes of both the
 right and the left, we must maintain
 pressure for change-for respect for
 human liberty and for the right of the
 people to freely choose their govern-
 ment. But the pressure we bring to
 bear in this instance should stop short
 of pushing for the military overthrow
 of a government by rebels whose com-
 mitment to human rights and demo-
 cratic principles is' questionable at
 best. That does not mean, however,
 that we need not be concerned about
 the potential threat Nicaragua poses
 of its neighbors or about the repres-
 sion of democratic liberties that the
 Sandinista regime is pursuing at home.
 To deal with the external threat, I
 'believe we should be willing to provide
 Nicaragua's neighbors with appropri-
 ate economic and military assistance
 to enable them to resist revolution and
 to address the economic deprivation
 which enhances Marxist revolutionary
 appeal. In particular we should give
 our full support to the efforts of the
 Contadora nations to negotiate a re-
 gionwide agreement to protect the
 peace and stability of the region. In
 'fact, this should be the centerpiece of
 our policy, not just a sideshow. I
 submit that the Contadora process
 offers the best available forum for a
 negotiated resolution because it is at
 least partially insulated from the acri-
 mony of the United States-Nicaraguan
 bilateral relationship.
 As for the repression of democratic
 liberties  inside  Nicaragua  itself,  I
 agree that we should be willing to use
 both economic and diplomatic leverage
 to help bring about reforms. But the
 Reagan administration's total embar-
 go went too far too fast. and destroyed
 whatever leverage we might otherwise
 have had. Once' you impose a total em-
 bargo, you have expended all of your
 ammunition and you have no other
 economic pressure left to bring to
 bear. I prefer the use of calibrated
 sanctions which can be tightened or
 eased depending on actions of the Nic-
 araguan Government,.
 Last, we should apply in conjunction
 with our regional friends, strong and
 constant diplomatic pressure on Nica-
 ragua to end internal repression, to
 pursue democratic reforms, and to end
 support for revolution abroad.
 By doing these things, I believe we
 would send a strong and clear mes-
 sage-both to the Sandinistas and to
 our allies in this hemisphere-that we
 will do all we must to protect both
 ourselves and our friends and to pro-
 mote democratic liberties-and that
 we will firmly adhere to our own prin-
 ciples in the process. It is my fervent
 hope that the Sandinistas will respond
 .to the actions I have outlined so that
 more stringent and far-reaching steps
 do not become necessary.
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am
 pleased to cosponsor this amendment,
 which will provide $38 million in hu-
 manitarian aid during fiscal year 1985
 and fiscal year 1986 to the democratic
 resistance in Nicaragua.
 This amendment is a carefully craft-
 ed compromise. As others have already
 noted, it provides a reasonable level of
 assistance, consistent ?with the real
 need for nonlethal aid. It meets the es-
 sential needs of the President and is
 supported by ? the administration, but
 it also takes into account the legiti-
 mate concerns expressed on both sides
 of the aisle about aspects of our in-
 volvement in Central America.
 The amendment puts our support
 for the democratic resistance in a clear
 and compelling policy context. It un-
 derscores that we want a negotiated,
 not a military, solution to the Nicara-
 guan situation, while recognizing that
 there is no prospect of serious negotia-
 tions unless the Sandinistas have some
 incentives to negotiate. It maintains
 the Contras as one important point of
 leverage on Managua, but it also urges
 the use of other political and economic
 measures as part of our overall strate-
 gy.
 This amendment insures that our
 'support for the democratic resistance
 forces will be closely and properly
 monitored,  both  by  the  executive
 branch and by the Congress. It reiter-
 ates basic congressional oversight au-
 thority and directs that the NSC mon-
 itor the use of funds. It mandates fre-
 quent Presidential reports to the Con-
 gress on the status of any negotia-
 tions, the use of provided funds and
 the efforts undertaken to remove any
 undesirable  personalities  from  the
 ranks of the Contras. In sum, it will
 insure that our activities will continue
 to be consistent with our goals and
 policy, as affirmed by the Congress.
 At the same time, the amendment
 restores to the President the policy
 flexibility he needs to conduct an ef-
 fective policy. It rescinds some earlier
 and unwise restrictions on the Presi-
 dent's freedom of movement and pro-
 vides expedited procedures to consider
 future Presidential requests for action,

 should hope for negotiations break
 down or political and economic sanc-
 tions prove ineffective in pursuing our
 legitimate and limited goals vis-a-vis
 Nicaragua.
 Mr. President, this issue has been
 with us for many months. The fits and
 starts of our consideration of this
 matter have served the interests of no
 one, except perhaps the Sandinistas
 and their Communist allies-
 The case for continued support to
 the Contras, meanwhile, has become
 even more compelling. As we all know,
 following the earlier, misguided House
 effort to extend a kind of olive branch
 to Managua,  Commandante Ortega
 ran off to Moscow, to solidify his alli-
 ance with the Soviets and to get new
 bankrolling for the dangerous activi-
 ties of his regime. More recently, the
 Sandinista Army has undertaken new
 aggression against both Costa Rica
 and Honduras, despite the conscien-
 tious efforts of both those govern-
 ments to diffuse their border situation
 with Nicaragua. It is hard to see how
 there could be much doubt in anyone's
 mind about the true nature of the
 Sandinista regime and its real aims in
 Central. America.
 It is time to act, clearly and decisive-
 ly, on this issue. We can do that by
 voting for this amendment and sus-
 taining strong support for it through
 the conference process ahead.

 Mr. 'STENNIS, Mr. DoMENicr, and Mr.
 MATTINGLY were added as cosponsors.)
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who
 yields time?
 Mr. MATHIAS. Vote.
 Mr. EVANS.. Mr. President, I rise to
 vote against the amendment before us,
 as I have voted' against all the propos-
 als concerning military operations in
 Central America offered here today. I
 do so with reluctance, as many of
 these amendments contained thought-
 ful, constructive proposals of consider-
 able merit. Unfortunately, the unani-
 mous-consent order we are under does
 not allow for further amendment of
 the proposals. In fact, the amendment
 before us now, the so-called' Lugar-
 Nunn proposal, requires some very ap-
 pealing actions on the part of the
 President.. Actions such as: reiterating
 our support for the Contadora process
 by implementing the 1983. Contadora
 Document of Objectives: resuming bi-
 lateral discussions with Nicaragua to
 encourage both a dialogue between
 the Government. of Nicaragua and all
 elements of the opposition and a com-
 prehensive,   verifiable   agreement
 among the nations of'Central America
 based on the Contadora Document of
 Objectives; pursuing multilateral trade
 and economic measures to complement
 the U.S. economic sanctions; and, sus-
 pending the sanctions:. and U.S. mili-
 tary maneuvers in. Honduras and off
 the coast of Nicaragua if the Govern-
 ment of Nicaragua takes certain. ac-
 tions.
 These proposals recognize the diplo-
 matic means that exist to help bring
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 stability to this troubled region. Were
 we to pursue such positive actions, we
 would likely find support both within
 and outside the region for our efforts.
 Our efforts thus far have brought us
 little outside support and yet a sus-
 tainable policy for this region around
 which'a consensus can be built. is pre-
 cisely what we need.
 As wholeheartedly as I support the
 positive proposals, in this amendment,
 I cannot support it. The amendment
 calls for humanitarian aid to be given
 to the Contras operating in Nicaragua.
 But what is this humanitarian aid? Its
 practical effect will be anything but
 humanitarian-by providing the Con-
 tras food, clothing, and .other non-
 lethal items, they will be able to spend
 more of their other moneys' on guns
 and bullets. To think. otherwise is to
 be less than honest with ourselves.
 Therefore, we are faced with the
 same nagging questions that have fol-
 lowed us for some time: what are our
 long-term objectives and policies for
 Central America? This question must
 be answered' before we proceed with
 the dangerous investment now, pro-
 posed.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President,. I would
 like to note that Senator ORRIN HATCH
 is giving a commencement address for
 his daughter's graduating class and
 that obligation prevents him from
 being here to vote for this amend-
 ment.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who
 yields time?
 Mr. PELL. Mr. President.' I yield 5
 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator from Vermont.
 Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
 dent.
 I thank the distinguished Senator
 from Rhode Island.
 Mr. President, as I understand this
 amendment,  subsection  (a)  of  the
 amendment   would  appropriate   $24
 million for humanitarian assistance to
 the Nicaraguan democratic resistance.
 My question I had is under the
 amendment, would any funds other
 than the $24 million. be available for
 obligations in fiscal year 1986? Or is
 the $24 million in effect a cap on ex-
 penditure for the activities authorized
 by the amendment during fiscal year
 1986?'
 Mr. LUGAR. It is a cap on the total
 amount for that year.
 Mr. LEAHY. For 1986.
 Mr. LUGAR. For 1986..
 Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distin-
 guished chairman.
 Subsection (b) of. the amendment re-
 peals subsections (a) and (b) of section
 8066 of the continuing resolution, the
 so-called Boland restriction. Subsec-
 tion (d) of section 8066, which would
 remain in force, provides during fiscal-
 year 1985 funds approved by the reso-
 lution for the purpose of supporting
 directly or indirectly military or para-
 military operation in Nicaragua should
 not exceed $14 million.         -
 If any of the $14 million is not ex-
 pended in fiscal year 1985, would that
 be available for expenditures in 1986
 as well? I ask the distinguished chair-
 man.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask my
 distinguished colleague from Georgia
 to affirm my interpretation. It appears
 to me that there are two distinctly
 separate funds. One is the $14 million
 that is being unfenced in 1985. The.
 second is the $24 million authorization
 for 1986. But the funds from. 1985.
 would not spill over into 1986. That is
 at least my interpretation.
 Mr. NUNN. The Senator is correct.
 That is also my interpretation. It is
 not by reason of a provision in this
 amendment but by reason of the
 standard   appropriation   language
 which is incorporated every year relat-
 ing to intelligence activities, which ba-
 sically says the funds that are not ex-
 pended do, not carry over.
 Mr. LEAHY. If any of the $14 mil-
 lion is not expended in 1985 it does not
 become available in :1986.    '
 Mr. NUNN. That is my interpreta-
 tion. I concur with the Senator from
 Michigan.
 Mr. LEAHY. That is the distin-
 guished chairman's interpretation.
 I thank the Senator.
 The term "humanitarian assistance"
 is defined in subsection (g) to include
 the provision of food, clothing, medi-
 cine, other humanitarian assistance,
 and transportation 'costs associated
 with the delivery of such assistance. It
 is defined to exclude weapons, weap-
 ons systems, ammunition, or any other
 equipment or materiel which is de-
 signed or has as its purpose to inflict
 serious bodily injury or death. Obvi-
 ously there is a gray area here of
 items that are nonhumanitarian but
 also nonlethal. That would include
 military related supplies ' or equipment
 which could but are not themselves
 lethal.
 I wonder would the following items
 be included within the scope of hu-
 manitarian  assistance.  Military-type
 uniforms?
 Mr. NUNN. I say to the Senator
 from Vermont I prefer not to go down
 a list here. I think he can go on and
 on. I understand the Senator's point. I
 have done some of that with the Sena-
 tor's concurrence in the Intelligence
 Committee.. We had considerable dis-
 cussion on this. I think what I like to
 say is it is our intent to have humani-
 tarian taken literally by the CIA. I
 think we have defined it as food, medi-
 cine, clothing. For instance, military-
 type uniforms, without binding myself.
 to continue this point by point, I
 'would say if you gave a multiple
 choice question and said, would the
 CIA be permitted to provide military-
 type uniforms or would they be re-
 quired to give them three-piece suits
 or tuxedos?
 Mr. LEAHY. How about radars?
 Mr. NUNN. Or bathing suits or Ber-
 muda shorts. I would say military-type

 uniforms are permitted by this amend-
 ment.
 Mr. LEAHY. It was a question the
 distinguished Senator from Georgia
 asked in another form that gave me
 the idea for this. I am wondering
 about things like radar, for example.
 Would radar be included?
 Mr. NUNN. I would say if radar is in-
 cluded to be used in battle manage-
 ment it would not be in keeping with
 the definition of humanitarian.
 On the other hand, if it was set up
 in a camp outside of Nicaragua for
 their protection against air raids, I
 would say that would be a different
 answer.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 time  of  the  Senator from  Rhode
 Island has expired.  .
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, how
 much time do I have remaining?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The
 Senator has 1 minute and 33 seconds.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today's

 addressing the  threat which inter-
 national communism presents in Nica-

 John Lenczowski of the National Secu-

 Soviet affairs. I commend this article
 to the attention of my colleagues and I
 ask unanimous consent that the arti-
 cle entitled "International Commu-
 nism and Nicaragua-An Administra-

 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the

 INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM AND NICARAGUA-
 AN ADMINISTRATION VIEW
 BY JOHN LENCZOWSKI)
 It is often unpleasant to resurrect what
 many think are the unpleasant ghosts of
 the past. Unfortunately, that is what we do
 when we talk frankly about the forces of
 "international communism" at work in our
 hemisphere. It has long been politically the
 safe thing to do to ridicule any mention of
 this alleged phenomenon. Professors and
 pundits have assured us for years that
 "international  communism"  as  such  no
 longer really exists-which is why it is redi-
 culed as a "phantom," the object of irration-
 al phobias of extremists, know-nothings, or
 people living in the past. It has been ex-
 plained to us that we can no longer clinical-
 ly and accurately use this loaded expression
 because of the Sino-Soviet split, the Yugo-
 slav-Soviet split, the Albanian-Soviet split,
 and other manifestations of polycentrism.
 Perhaps communism is no longer a mono-
 lithic force subsuming all Marxist-Leninist
 states under the Soviet banner. Neverthe-
 less, how can one label the presence today
 in Nicaragua of Cubans, Bulgarians, Liby-
 ans, Czechs, North Koreans, East Germans,
 Vietnamese, Soviets, and communist ele-
 ments of the Palestine Liberation Organiza-
 tion? If this is not some facsimile of interna-
 tional communism, then we are at a loss at
 how to explain the common thread that
 binds these forces together. If we must pay
 our dues to the gods of polycentrism, then
 perhaps we might refine our terminology by
 calling this phenomenon "Soviet interna-
 tional communism," since neither Maoist,
 Titoist, or Albanian brands of communism
 are at work.
 Since we so rarely discuss the facts about
 international communism, here are a few
 that should be remembered in the context
 of the debate on Nicaragua:
 The people do not want communism.
 Never in history has a majority of a free
 electorate democratically chosema commu-
 nist form of government. (There is only one
 exception:  the  minuscule  state  of  San
 Marino.)
 Communists have always come to power
 through violent takeovers. These takeovers
 have always involved the seizure of power
 by a well-organized and externally assisted
 minority over an unorganized and unwitting
 majority. Such takeovers consistently entail
 the use of a "popular front" of communist
 and noncommunist elements; the establish-
 ment of a communist party that uses an ide-
 ological party line to enforce internal con-
 formity and identify and eliminate devi-
 ationists; the use of camouflage to disguise
 the party's true intentions and full political
 program; the use of propaganda and disin-
 formation to manipulate the international
 news media; the use of violent and ruthless
 methods to eliminate all organized opposi-
 tion; and finally, the use of gradualism in
 the process of eliminating opposition and
 applying  internal  security-so  that  the
 people do not realize what is happening to
 them until it is too late.
 No communist regime that has consolidat-
 ed its power has ever been overthrown and
 replaced by a noncommunist order. (The
 only exception is Grenada.) Every other
 form  of  government  offers  people  the
 chance to retain a system of trial and error.
 It is easy to overthrow a Shah or a Somoza
 after trial has been granted and error per-
 ceived. But once communism is firmly in
 place, the possibility of trial and error is no
 more. A vote against aid to. the "freedom
 fighters" is a vote to consign Nicaragua to
 an indefinite period of no freedom of choice.
 The human cost of communism exceeds
 most Americans' expectations. The number
 of people murdered by communist regimes
 is estimated at between 60 million and 150
 million, with the higher figure probably
 more accurate in light of recent scholarship.
 The greatest tide of refugees in world histo-
 ry flows from communist states to noncom-
 munist ones: Today it comes from Ethiopia,
 'Afghanistan, Indochina, East Europe, and
 Nicaragua. (During the entire Vietnam war
 there was nary a refugee fleeing from Indo-
 china. It was not until communism tri-
 umphed that life became so unbearable that
 people who could withstand decades of war
 fled to the seas.) Communism invented the
 concentration camp. Millions have been im-
 prisoned and executed, have worked and
 starved to death, in these camps. Commu-.
 nisi regimes will not permit enterprising
 Western reporters near these camps, so you
 don't hear about them on the news. Com-
 munist regimes recognize no restraint on
 their absolute power. From this they estab-
 lish ideological falsehoods as the standards
 of right and wrong and the standards by
 which deviationism is measured; from this
 stems the systematic denial of all individual
 human rights. The quality of life always de-
 teriorates under communism: the militariza-
 tion of society; the destruction of the con-
 sumer economy; the rationing of food; the
 deterioration of housing and insufficient
 new  construction  to  meet  population
 growth; the destruction of medical care
 through lack of medicine and medical sup-
 plies; the destruction of religion; the de-
 struction and political control of education
 and culture; the rewriting of history and de-
 struction of monuments to the national her-
 S 7647
 itage; and the assault on family life and pa-
 rental jurisdiction over children.
 Soviet-style communism invariably means
 .the export of terrorism, violence, and revo-
 lution. Soviet proxy states participate in an
 efficient division of labor: Cubans as troops,
 Bulgarians and Vietnamese as arms suppli-
 ers, East Germans as secret-police trainers
 and military advisers. Since Soviet proxies
 are present on our continent today, it is no
 accident that  the communist Sandinista
 regime is an active collaborator in this divi-
 sion of labor.
 The Sandinistas are communists. Nicara-
 guan President Daniel  Ortega has said:
 "Marxism-Leninism is the scientific doctrine
 that guides our revolution .... [W]ithout
 Sandinismo we cannot be Marxist-Leninist,
 and Sandinismo without Marxism-Leninism
 cannot be revolutionary." The identical pat-
 tern of communist takeover, internal poli-
 cies,  and external behavior is repeating
 itself in Nicaragua. There can be no doubt.
 given the vast evidence we have accumulat-
 ed, that Nicaragua is becoming another
 Cuba.
 Communist regimes, including the Nicara-
 guan regime, spend vast resources on disin-
 formation-to  deceive  the  international
 news media and foreign political decision-
 makers. A principal goal is to disseminate
 false information about the nature of their
 own system: The principal disinformation
 theme of all communist regimes is to con-
 vince others that they are not really com-
 munist. This is done in many ways by the
 Sandinistas, but most prominently by the
 "guided tour." Countless American visitors
 are taken on this guided tour and see nice
 things and talk to "average citizens" who
 tell them what the regime wants them to.
 Nobody wants to believe that he has been
 fooled. But if Congress is to believe the tes-
 timony of constituents and reporters who
 base their information on the "guide tour,"
 Congress may as well believe everything it is
 told on identical guided tours in Moscow,
 Havana, East Germany and North Korea.
 Congress must decide whether  it  will
 resist international communism on our con-
 tinent or let it prosper. Isolationists in Con-
 gress may base their opposition to the ad-
 ministration on the principle that other
 countries should be allowed self-determina-
 tion.  Unfortunately,  in  Nicaragua  today
 there can be no self-determination, because
 of the reality of "foreign-force determina-
 tion." The foreign force is the USSR and its
 proxies, otherwise known as the forces of
 'international communism. Will the Nicara-
 guans be given enough assistance so that
 they will be able to determine their future
 on the basis of a balance of foreign forces,
 or will Congress permit an imbalance, an im-
 balance  against  democracy,  against  any
 system of trial and error? If Congress choos-
 es to deny the Nicaraguan friends of democ-
 racy a chance for self-determination, it will
 be voting in favor of the first victory of the
 Soviet strategic offensive on our own conti-
 nent.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask for
 the support of all Senators on this
 amendment. It is an amendment that
 has come from the work of Senators
 on both sides of the aisle in a genuine
 bipartisan  attempt to  give  a very
 strong supporting gloss about our for-
 eign policy in Central America.
 When President Napoleon Duarte
 visited our country recently, he made
 the point again and again that our
 voice is seen as divided in Central
 America-divided by party, divided by

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE   '.          June 6, 1985
 House and Senate, divided by Congress
 and the administration.
 I appreciate very much the work of
 the distinguished Senators: from Geor-
 gia, Oklahoma,. Florida, and so many
 other Senators on the Democratic side
 of the aisle. Likewise, I appreciate the
 work from my majority leader, Sena-
 for DOLE, from Senator WILSON, and
 from the chairman of the Intelligence
 Committee, Senator DURENBERCER, in
 particular, who has been so thought-
 ful in drafting this amendment.
 We have forged, a statement for
 /America that is very important. I hope
 we will have a very strong vote this
 evening in support of it.
 Mr.. NUNN. Mr. President, may I say
 I thank the Senators from. Indiana
 and  Minnesota  and  the  majority
 leader, who cosponsored this amend-
 ment. I hope we have a general con-
 sensus here.
 Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield
 back our time.
 The  PRESIDING OFFICER.. All
 time is yielded back. The question is

 there a sufficient second? There is a
 sufficient second.
 The yeas and nays were ordered.

 ment. The yeas and nays have been or-
 dered and the clerk will call the roll:

 NOT VOTING-3.
 Goldwater
 Rockefeller     Wallop
 So the
 agreed to.
 . Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I move
 to reconsider the vote by which the
 amendment was agreed to..
 Mr. DOLE. Mr.'President, I move to
 lay that motion on the table.
 The motion to lay on the table was
 agreed to.
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me in-
 dicate to my colleagues who are here,
 and to those who may be listening on
 their squawkboxes? that we will con-
 vene at 8:30 in the morning and be'.
 back. on the bill 'at 9 o'clock. There are
 still five Contra amendments'. I will
 still make the offer that I will with-
 draw my amendment if the other four
 will withdraw theirs. That may not
 sell..
 I encourage my colleagues to help us
 by perhaps shortening the time. Each
 of the remaining amendments has 60
 minutes each. If there is some real
 need' to offer the amendment, maybe
 we could help on the time side.
 The  distinguished  Senator  from
 Massachusetts [Mr. KERRY] has indi-
 cated he is prepared to yield back a
 sizable portion of his time. I hope that
 a couple of the amendments would not
 be offered.
 I know a number of my colleagues
 have official engagements elsewhere
 tomorrow afternoon and evening. We
 want to try to accommodate everyone
 we can. But. it seemed to me that we
 were going to be at least until mid-
 night. on the Contra amendments to-
 night and there are still about 40
 other amendments,  is  that  right?
 About 40 is right. That looked like to
 much to do in one evening.
 Many of those amendments can be
 accepted, with maybe three or four
 rollcall votes. We shall try to aceom,
 modate  those Senators  who  must
 depart by 3 o'clock tomorrow. Some
 may have to leave a bit earlier. So if
 we. come in and show a willingness to
 help work it out, because we would
 like to complete action on his bill so
 we can take up the clean water bill' on
 Monday. And we have a full calendar
 again next week.
 There are only 2 weeks after next
 week before we are back in recess.
 I might add, Mr. President, since I
 understand there will be a division
 asked for on the first amendment, the
 amendment by the distinguished Sena-
 tor from Iowa [Mr.  HARKIN),  that
 votes could occur as early as 9 or 10
 a.m.  tomorrow.  I  think  Senators
 should be on notice that it may not be
 as late as noon.
 Mr.. DIXON. Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. DOLE.. Mr. President, I yield to
 the Senator from Illinois'.
 Mr. DIXON. I wonder if the majori-
 ty leader would indicate what time he
 anticipates rollcalls on Monday after-
 noon?
 Mr. DOLE. Very candidly, Mr. Presi-
 dent, I think that may depend on how
 we. get along tomorrow afternoon.
 Mr. DIXON. Will he indicate tomor-
 row afternoon?
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, there will
 not be votes on Monday until Monday
 afternoon. If we are back on this on
 Monday, then votes could occur early
 Monday afternoon but not in the
 morning.
 REDUCTION OF TIME FOIL KERRY AMENDMENT'
 Mr. DOLE.. Mr. President, I under-
 stand that the distinguished Senator
 from Massachusetts [Mr. KERRY] will
 be willing to reduce his time, the total
 time, from 1 hour to 40 minutes equal-
 ly divided. I therefore ask unanimous
 consent that, when the Kerry amend-
 ment. is offered, the total time be 40
 minutes equally divided.. That is 20 for
 certain for the Senator from Massa-
 chusetts.
 The PRESIDING  OFFICER (.Mr.
 WARNER). Without objection, it is so
 ordered.
 Mr. KERRY. Mr.:President, I thank
 the majority leader very much.
 ROUTINE MORNING BUSINESS
 Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that there be a
 period for the transaction of routine
 morning  business  not  to  extend
 beyond 8:30 p.m.,  with statements
 therein limited to 5 minutes each.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
 out objection,. it is so ordered.
 LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS DEAL-
 ING WITH AMERICAN POLICY
 TOWARD NICARAGUA
 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as
 the Senate embarks upon yet another
 debate  regarding  American  policy
 toward. the Sandinista Government of
 Nicaragua, each offered in the form of
 an amendment to the pending State
 Department authorization bill, I think
 it appropriate to state at the outset
 that I expect to be recorded in opposi-
 tion to each of the :proposals likely to
 be brought to a vote today.
 While there are elements in each
 that I could support, and in fact would
 like to see pursued by the President, it.
 seems to  me  that none of these
 amendments, or any combination of
 these amendments, provides a reasona-
 bl'e? or responsible basis on which to
 formulate and puruse a foreign policy
 in Central America. For, the problem
 here is not one amenable to solution
 by legislative action alone. What is
