expected to write nothing if I "lost thOargu-
ment." 
Well, I have lost the big one now, and so 
I am leaving. But the grief is purely profes-
sional. I leave with regret for my lack of 
persuasiveness, and with my high regard and 
liking for my editorial colleagues intact. 
That goes especially for Molly Clowes (edi-
torial page editor)?no difference of opinion 
could ever diminish the professional admira-
tion and the deep affection I have for her?
and for Barry Bingham, a comrade-in-arms 
in Europe and the Pacific, a close friend 
since 1942, whose example of 1941 I am now 
following. 
NOTE FROM THE EDITOR OF THE COURIER-
JOURNAL 
Weldon James, in the statement which ap-
pears on this page, is clearly acting on prin-
ciple in a cause which commands his deep 
conviction. 
He is one of the fortunate people who can 
see the issue of Vietnam in clear, sharp out-
lines of black and white. I share with mil-
lions of Americans the unhappy necessity of 
viewing it in infinitely varying shades of 
gray. 
I cannot in good conscience support every 
aspect of the official American position. I 
cannot, on the other hand, find the release 
of condemning our whole policy and de-
manding American withdrawal. 
The man who is owner and editor of a 
newspaper must shoulder the burden of 
editorial policy decisions. I listen to my 
valued associates, such as Weldon James, 
with respect as well as affection. But the 
final responsibility for the editorial page 
cannot be divided. I can only act on my 
conscience, as Weldon James is acting on his. 
?BARRY. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will 
the Senator from Wisconsin yield? 
Mr. PROXMIRE. I am happy to yield 
to the Senator from Montana. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I am delighted 
that the Senator from Wisconsin is put-
ting into the RECORD the statement made 
by Mr. Barry Bingham, the publisher of 
the Louisville Courier-Journal, because 
I believe that statement?as the Senator 
has pointed out?is indicative of the stat-
ure of Mr. Bingham, as well as of Asso-
ciate Editor Weldon James. 
Mr. PROXMIRE. I thank the distin-
guished majority leader. ' Of course, I 
agree with him wholeheartedly. Mr. 
Bingham is, really, one of the great news-
paper publishers in this ,country. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
time of the Senator from Wisconsin has 
expired. 
Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to proceed for 2 addi-
tional minutes. 
The PRESIDING OriviCER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SPORTING NEWS LINES UP IN MIL-
WAUKEE'S CORNER ON BRAVES' 
WALK OUT 
Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, the 
decision of Circuit Judge Elmer W. 
Roller, ordering baseball to prepare a 
1967 expansion plan including Milwaukee 
unless the Braves are ordered back to 
Wisconsin forthwith, has brought com-
ment from across the country, most of 
it highly critical of baseball's abandon-
ments of Milwaukee. The Sporting 
News, the so-called bible - of baseball, 
expressed its views in its most recent 
issue, and it could find no approval of 
baseball's position, either. 
That editorial concludes as follows: 
By following its present course, we do not 
believe baseball will regain public esteem 
in the courts. It can do so only by comply-
ing with Judge Roller's order to submit an 
expansion plan for 1967 which would include 
Milwaukee. Failure to do so means baseball 
is playing with fire. The defeat in the Wis-
consin circuit court can bring renewed vigor 
to baseball if it expands as ordered, But 
defeat in the U.S. Supreme Court could de-
stroy every privilege the majors insist they 
need for survival. The choice should not be 
difficult. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the editorial from the April 
30 issue of Sporting News be printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
under our free enterprise system. But, hav-
ing moved into a county built arena, the 
club became a quasi-public institution, with 
an obligation to every citizen in the Milwau-
kee area. 
The Braves departure also left economic 
wounds not easily healed. Testimony during 
the trial suggested that a major league club 
meant $18 million per year to Milwaukee's 
economy. One witness estimated that in 
the period 1953-63, more than $50 million in 
out-of-town revenue poured into the city as 
the result of major league baseball. 
UNCONVINCING PROOF 
A quasi-public enterprise packing that 
much financial wallop can hardly expect a 
hearty farewell handshake from the city 
suddenly deprived of this income. 
These factors put a heavy burden of proof 
on the Braves' attempt to pull out of the 
city and leave it without major league base-
ball. Approval of the transfer to Atlanta 
would appear justified only if there is over-
whelming evidence that baseball interest is 
dead in Milwaukee, that the club is blameless 
and that the guilt lies at the community's 
door. We are not convinced. 
By the same token, the Braves' case for 
abandoning Milwaukee did not convince 
Judge Roller. Testimony he cited in his 
176 page decision casts considerable doubt 
on the validity of numerous defense claims. 
Was it Milwaukee's fault that the purchaers 
of the Braves hi 1962 borrowed at least $5 
million in short- and long-term notes to 
swing a $6.2-million deal? Was Milwaukee's 
1964 attendance of 910,000 evidence of fan 
apathy? If it was, might not the 10 other 
major league clubs which failed to match 
that figure in 1964 have grounds for moving? 
By following its present course, we do 
not believe baseball will regain public esteem 
In the courts. It can do so only by complying 
with Judge Roller's order to submit an ex-
pansion plan for 1967 which would include 
Milwaukee. Failure to do so means baseball 
is playing with fire. The defeat in the Wis-
consin circuit court can bring renewed vigor 
to baseball if it expands as ordered. But 
defeat in the 'U.S. Supreme Court could de-
stroy every privilege the majors insist they 
need for survival. The choice should not be 
oult. 
SPORTING NEWS LINES UP IN MILWAUKEE'S 
CORNER 
Regarding the future welfare of baseball, 
perhaps the most important bit of testimony 
in the State of Wisconsin's case against the 
Braves came from former Commissioner Ford 
Frick. Disputing the oft heard claim by 
many officials that early expansion is "pre-
posterous," Frick said, on the contrary, that 
it would be simple to add more clubs to the 
two major leagues. 
Then, getting to the heart of the issue, 
Frick expressed the opinion that "if we re-
fuse to consider the interest of' the public 
in the development of our game, if we in-
sist on being completely monopolistic in our 
organization, we will lose all the public es-
teem which presently exists. We will pave 
the way for the breakdown of our structure." 
The Sporting News agrees completely with 
Frick's views. The monopolistic privileges 
which baseball enjoys carry with them cer-
tain obligations, which regrettably have not 
been fulfilled in Milwaukee. As a result, 
baseball is headed for a U.S. Supreme Court 
test that may well destroy "the umbrella" 
of antitrust exemption under which it has 
been operating since Justice Oliver Wen 'ell 
Holmes' famous decision in 1922. 
RESPONSIBILITIES, TOO 
While many outsiders dispute the p 
baseball undoubtedly has prospered becau 
it is a monopoly. But, long ago, other legs 
ized monopolies?and there are still many 
them in this country?recognized or we 
forced to recognize that exclusive rights an 
public responsibilities go hand in hand. 
Baseball may be fighting for what it be-
lieves to be its rights in the Milwaukee case, 
but we think it is ignoring its accountability. 
Organized ball operates with reserve clause 
contracts, unchallenged territorial rights and 
a free agent draft. Baseball officials consider 
them vital to the game's health. So do we. 
And we also maintain that an enterprise 
which finds it necessary 'to accept a privi-
leged status cannot shirk its allegiance to 
the community in which it operates. 
Compounding the obligation baseball owes 
to its fans?and taxpayers in general?is the 
game's increasing tendency to rely on public 
funds for new park construction. Today's 
high costs virtually prohibit private financ-
ing of stadiums. Even where it can be done, 
there must be municipal, county or State 
cooperation through site allocations, tax con-
cessions, road building, and other assistance. 
And when a club accepts outside aid, either 
In full or in part, it increases its sphere of 
responsibility. 
If the Braves, let us assume, had built their 
own stadium in Milwaukee with private 
funds, then their decision to move to At-
lanta, leaving a "white elephant" park be-
hind them, possibly could not be challenged 
IETNAM?A MISERABLE CIVIL WAR 
Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that I may pro-
ceed for 8 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President, 
historically, there are no such countries 
as North Vietnam and South Vietnam. 
For thousands of years, the Vietnamese 
have lived in the land area which, since 
1954, has been termed North Vietnam 
and South Vietnam. Historically, the 
Vietnamese people are great warriors. 
They have a noble tradition and a very 
great history of having hurled back in-
vaders from the Chinese Empire 
throughout many, many years. Monu-
ments within Vietnam commemorate 
these victories and stand as memorials 
to warlord rulers of Vietnam. 
Defense Secretary Robert S. 1VIeNa-
mara is said to have made a tough state-
ment before the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee in which he said: 
The war in Vietnam was not and is not a 
civil war. It is a direct and flagrant aggres-
sion by North Vietnam. 
This was a blatant misstatement of 
fact. The Geneva Accords of 1954 pro-
vided neutrality; self-determination, and

LOUISVILLE COURIER-JOURNAL: A 
GREAT PAPER SAYS GOODBY TO 
A REMARKABLE EDITOR 
Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, the 
Louisville Courier-Journal has long been 
recognized as one of the handful of truly 
great newspapers in America. 
Recently, its editor and publisher ac-
cepted the resignation of its very re-
markable associate editor, Weldon James. 
Mr. James vigorously disagreed with 
Barry Bingham and the Courier-journal 
on the paper's Vietnam policy. James 
forthrightly told the paper so and quit 
to go on active duty with the U.S. Ma-
rines. 
In resigning, Mr. James wrote one of 
the most impressive statements on edi-
torial dissent within a great newspaper 
that I have ever read. Barry Bingham, 
the paper's publisher, replied with equal 
grace. 
The editorial and the report speak 
well for the integrity of both Weldon 
James and the Courier-Journal. 
Sonic years ago, after I had completed 
my requirements for my doctorate at 
Itarvard, I began writing a dissertation 
an "'Developing Standards for Evaluat-
ing the Political Content of the American 
Newspaper." I never completed the dis-
sertation. So of course I have never 
aimed my doctorate. But, in the course 
of my study, I have had occasion to 
study American newspapers in some 
depth. 
in my judgment, this editorial shows 
ta, remarkable and rare maturity as well 
an deep conviction, on the part of all 
those involved in what must have been 
Sic toughest kind of difference of opinion. 
it shows how an editor in support of 
his deepest convictions can resign in 
iriod grace, and how a great newspaper 
iian accept that resignation, It provides 
a lesson for all of us in our often heated 
disagreements over Vietnam policy. 
ask unanimous consent that the edi-
torial by Weldon James explaining his 
resignation from the Courier-Journal 
and the reply by Barry Bing,-ham be 
Printed in the REcoap. 
There being no objection, the article 
and reply were ordered to be printed in 
Lhe RECORD, as follows: 
IlFrem the Washington (D.C.) Daily News, 
Apr. 21, 196131 
A MATTER OF BELIED': IT'S PAST TIME To SAY 
1.0 HELL WITH HO 
(By Weldon James) 
(Barron's NOTE .?The Washington Daily 
Stews reprints from the Louisville, Ky., 
Courier-Journal an article by its associate 
editor, Weldon James, announcing the rea-
sons for his resignation?and the reply from 
the paper's editor and publisher, Barry Bing-
ham. Weldon James, incidentally, gained 
laitry into area of Far East affairs by being 
present, as United Press correspondent when 
Japanese Shells sank the U.S. gunboat Panay 
in the Yangtze River in 1937.) 
This is one editorial only a great newspaper 
could invite anyone- to write and to sign. 
I quit. I resign as an associate editor of the 
Courier-Journal. I am going on active duty 
in the Marine Corps to testify to my belief 
that U.S. policy in Vietnam is right?and 
that the quicker more newspapers and more 
people give the President solid support, the 
shorter and less dangerously complicated the 
war there will be. 
The Courier-Journal, as its readers know. 
is no appeaser on Vietnam, no advocate of 
U.S. withdrawal. But it does not speak with 
the sharpness I believe the continuing crisis 
demands. 
I believe that the 'United States was right 
about Vietnam in 1954, right when President 
Kennedy increased our involvement, right 
when President Johnson did likewise, and 
right to commit, in the President's words, 
"whatever it takes" to deny the Communist 
a military triumph -there. 
I believe Lyndon?Johnson is as right as 
Roosevelt, as timely as Truman. as cautiously 
correct as Kennedy, and as entitled to Eisen-
hower's and the Nation's support as the 
Courier-Journal used to say In editorials I 
wrote. 
But the Courier-Journal, like some other 
great news:papers, no longer Liaises a forth-
right stand on this paramount issue. I re-
spect the conscientiousness of its reasoning, 
but I am not covinced. 
TIM, is no time for the press of a great 
Nation to p1a3r Hamlet?or Lippmann. Wal-
ter Lippmann's glocm about the Truman 
doctrine was 100 percent wrong*. That doc-
trine played a decisive role in converting the 
Soviet Union to a belief in peaceful coexis-
tence. Its great dividend is the historic rift 
between Peking and Moscow today. 
Mr. liippmann's China doorstep arguments 
about southeast Asia today are identical with 
hie Russia-doorstep :arguments about Greece 
and Turkey in 1947?and I believe identically 
fallacious about what the United States 
ahould do and can do. 
The Courier-Journal has no indorsed the 
Lippmann line, nor has it been guilty of the 
vacillation or the silence or the yes-buts of a 
good part of the American press that have 
misled both Hanoi and Peking. But in re-
cent months it has been something less than 
decisive. And all this across the Nation has 
nurtured honest contusion of the minority 
in this country?anti uninte rationally en. 
couraged the sit-ins, the draft card burners, 
the neoisolationiet belief the I. if only the 
United States were to withdraw from south-
east Asia (or any other trouble spot), the 
world would have instant peace. 
No one can delay that the issues in south-
east Asia are terribly complex, or contend 
that we have not made mistakes there. It 
would be a miracle :if we had not. And I 
fully respect the honest doubts and anxieties 
of some of my colleagues and of other 
thoughtful Americans who differ with my 
views. But I beieve tt, is past time they re-
aa lived them and invoked positive support for 
the President. This could, in my emphatic 
belief, keep the war limited, and help to 
shorten It. 
Diversity of criticat opinion is not only a 
right but the great strength of a democracy, 
and no American I know would limit it. But 
there is enough evidence at hand for the 
American .tary to reach a verdict on Vietnam. 
The evidence is not just two decades of his-
tory bat the exposition of that history and 
of the facts today by the President, the Vice 
President, the Secretaries of State and De-
fense, Averell Harriman, McGeorge Bundy, 
and a host of others. 
At moments in history when their declara-
tions had a powerful and useful impact on 
public opinion, the Courier-Journal's Henry 
Watterson said "to hell with the Hohenzol-
lerns" and Mark Etheridge ( former pub-
lisher) and Barry Bingham said in effect "to 
hell with Hiter"?and Mr. Bingham went into 
the Navy before Pearl Harbor to show where 
he stood. I hold it is past time to say to hell 
with Ho?and to speed him toward that 
destination until he sees the virtues of the 
conference table. 
That solution manifestly is impossible as 
long as Ho believes that the American people 
will indeed, as he long ago boasted, weary, 
waver, and withdraw. 
If we don't get the message to Ho now, the 
need to get it to Mao Tse-tung will be upon 
us in time. He's told us what he plans. It 
is as foolish to laugh at his boasts and Red 
China's "weakness" now as it was to laugh 
at "that clown Hitler" and Mali Germany's 
"weakness" in the 1930's. 
Some of my good but regrettably misin-
formed friends have attributed the positive-
ness of my views to my long ties with the 
Marine Corps, instead of to reason, logic, and 
a lifelong study of history. 
This is nonsense, of course, The Marine 
Corps has no foreign policy. It has no pol-
itics. Sound out six Marine sergeants?or 
six Marine generals, for that matter?and 
you'll find as many differing "experts" on 
foreign affairs and politics as you'll find in 
the corner tavern. 
The Marine Corps, as a long succession of 
its Commandants have made plain, has but 
one job. That is to obey the orders of the 
civilian Commander in Chief, the President. 
The Marine Corps does teach the uses of 
disciplined rage and the application of 
"measured strength"?exactly what the 
United States is employing in Vietnam today. 
And it has been asking for reserves to volun-
teer. I am proud it believes I can be of some 
use to it now, thanks in great part to the 
generosity with which the Courier-Journal 
over the years has enabled me to advance my 
training in Marine Corps schools, the Na-
tional War College, and with N tvy and Ma-
rine Forces on the job in Europe and the 
Orient. 
A few comments on the national scene: 
It is well nigh incredible to me that some 
self-styled liberal Democrats should be ig-
noring the posthumous revelation of Adlai 
Stevenson's true position on Vietnam (the 
Courier-Journal, of course, took sensible edi-
torial notice of this). It is even more shock-
ing that they should be seeking to explain 
away Vice President HUBERT HUMPHREY'S vig-
orous and persuasive ,support of the Presi-
dent's policies as the calculated insincerity 
of "a White House captive." They owe it to 
their label--and to the country - - to go back 
and ponder what John F. Kennedy said and 
did about Vietnam. 
I believe that the worst bit of mischief-
making about southeast Asia has been per-
petrated by the President of France. NATO 
aside, it is appalling that De Gaulle can in-
duce anyone anywhere to accept his absurd 
equation of U.S. aid to South Vietnam with 
France's vain attempt, against Anglo-Amer-
ican advice and warning, to hold on to her 
colonial empire in Indochina after World 
War II. But when I discussed Vietnam with 
some hundreds of the Nation's college stu-
dent editors in New York recently, I dis-
covered that some--a thin minority, fortu-
nately--have indeed accepted this absurdity 
as "fact." 
The Courier-Journal, to its credit, has not 
encouraged the absurdities of the super-
liberal Democrats or the French equationists. 
But it has not yet attacked them with the 
vigor I think they demand. 
To longtime readers of the Courier-
Journal I must observe that I carne to Louis-
ville some 17 years ago on handsome prom-
ises, handsomely kept?that I would have 
time for foreign travel and lecturing and 
other writing, and would wear no man's col-
lar, and be paid to argue and to criticize the 
newspaper from front page to back, and be

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 8455 
free elections for Vietnam. At that time 
the United States, through its repre-
sentatives, agreed to the Geneva Accords. 
It is specifically stated in the Geneva 
agreement, and I quote: 
The military demarcation line at the 17th 
parallel is provisional and should not in any 
way be considered as constituting a political 
or territorial boundary. 
Since that time all land area north of 
the 17th parallel is termed North Viet-
nam and the area south of this provi-
sional demarcation line is referred to as 
South Vietnam. 
Very definitely, this administration 
has invloved more than 300,000 men of 
our Armed Forces in a miserable civil 
war in Vietnam. While on a study mis-
sion in Vietnam early last October, 
General Westmoreland stated to the 
junior Senator from Ohio, "The bulk 
of the Vietcong fighting us in South 
Vietnam were born and reared in South 
Vietnam." He made this statement to 
me one evening in Saigon. He will not 
deny it. Furthermore, no one can deny 
that Prime Minister Ky, the flamboyant 
air marshal, so-called, of the South 
Vietnamese Air Force who was installed 
by 10 generals last June as Prime Min-
ister of the Saigon government when 
those general overthrew the civilian 
government of Saigon, was born and 
reared in Hanoi. It may be startling to 
Defense Secretary McNamara to learn 
that Ky and other officials in the Saigon 
government and generals of the army 
of Saigon forces fighting the Vietcong 
were themselves born and reared in 
North Vietnam. General Richard Stil-
well informed the junior Senator from 
Ohio that 80 percent of the armed forces 
of South Vietnam fighting in the Mekong 
Delta were born and reared in the 
Mekong Delta which is south and west 
of Saigon. The civilian head of the 
National Liberation Front, which is the 
political organization directing the Viet-
cong, is a Saigon lawyer. It is stated 
that he is not a Communist. 
When the Vietnamese were fighting 
for their freedom against French colo-
nialism their official organization was 
termed the National Liberation Front 
and their fighting forces were termed 
Vietminh. Many of those freedom 
fighters against French colonalism are 
fighting now as Vietcong to establish, 
they hope, a South Vietnam free from 
the presence of foreign soldiers. Of 
course, this is a civil war. In fact, in 
recent weeks the violence and rioting in 
Danang, Saigon, Hue and elsewhere in 
South Vietnam have indicated a revolt 
within a civil war. Defense Secretary 
McNamara is just as wrong now in 
denying that a miserable civil war is 
raging in Vietnam as he was in May 
1962 in a briefing at Saigon, when he 
said, "The war is being won." Still 
dressed in khaki and hiking shoes that 
he wore during his field tour, with his 
notebooks filled with information and 
opinions, he answered a skeptical re-
porter, "Every quantitative measurement 
we have shows we are winning the war." 
Also, at that time 4 years ago, in the 
luxurious air-conditioned headquarters 
In Saigon, Gen. Paul D. Harkins, the 
American commander, waxed optimistic 
with impressive statistics of Vietcong 
killed and of our winning the war. This 
was precisely how the French staff offi-
cers comforted themselves during the 
Indo-China war early in 1954 shortly 
before Dienbienphu was overrun by the 
Vietnamese. Bad news was derided as 
spurious pessimism. 
The forces of the National Liberation 
Front fought for freedom against the 
French attempt to reestablish their op-
pression and colonialism at the end of 
World War II, and despite massive mil-
itary aid given by our Government to the 
French in 1953 and 1954, including air-
planes, tanks, munitions, artillery, ma-
chineguns. The French were besieged 
and defeated at Dienbienphu which Gen-
eral Navarre had established and gar-
risoned as an offensive base. Following 
this surrender on May 8, 1954, of the 
French, Moroccan, and Vietnamese 
alined with them against the Vietminh, 
and about 12,000 survivors of the French 
Foreign Legion, and the withdrawal of 
the French colonial forces, Ho Chi Minh 
was elected president in the only election 
held in Vietnam. 
We Americans, supplanting French 
colonialism, established by the opera-
tions of our CIA a puppet government in 
Saigon and President Diem called off the 
elections stipulated in the Geneva Ac-
cords to be held in 1956. President Ei-
senhower in his reminiscences wrote that 
had the election been held Ho Chi Minh, 
the George Washington of Vietnam, 
would have received 80 percent of the 
vote of the Vietnamese people living to 
the south and north of the 17th parallel 
demarcation line. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 8 
minutes of the Senator from Ohio have 
expired. 
Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. I ask unanimous 
consent to proceed for 3 additional min-
utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Mr. President, 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk said 
again last week?and he has repeated the 
statement since, in fact he has made this 
statement so many times that one feels 
like saying put on a new record?"Amer-
lean soldiers are fighting in Vietnam be-
cause of commitments made by three 
Presidents." 
This Thursday marks the birthdate of 
Adolf Hitler, born in Austria, April 28, 
1889. Hitler was the author of the "big 
lie." He and his Nazis boasted, if you 
state a lie repeatedly many, many times, 
it will come to be believed. This seems 
to be the technique of Secretary Rusk 
and other apologists for our involvement 
in a miserable civil war in Vietnam with 
hundreds of thousands of American GI's. 
To speak charitably of Secretary Rusk 
and other "war hawks" who repeatedly 
claim that American boys are fighting 
and dying in Vietnam because of com-
mitments made by three Presidents, let 
me say if they are not resorting to the big 
lie technique, my comment, generous to 
them, is that they are reckless and care-
less with the truth. 
Our late great President John F. Ken-
nedy stated: 
Transforming Vietnam into a Western 
redoubt is ridiculous. 
Also, on September 3, 1963, shortly be-
fore he was assassinated, he said: 
I don't think that unless a greater effort 
is made by the Government to win popular 
support that the war can be won out there. 
In the final analysis, it is their war. They 
are the ones who have to win it or lose it. 
We can help them, we can give them equip-
ment, we can send our men out there as ad-
visers, but they have to win it?the people 
of Vietnam?against the Communists. We 
are prepared to continue to assist them, but 
I don't think that the war can be won unless 
the people support the effort, and, in my 
opinion, in the last 2 months the Govern-
ment has gotten out of touch with the 
people. 
On the day that General Eisenhower 
left the White House, January 20, 1961, 
the total of 'U.S. military advisory per-
sonnel had been increased during his ad-
ministration from 327 in 1953 to 685 in 
1961. He made our initial commitment 
to South Vietnam in a letter to President 
Diem of South Vietnam stating: 
I am instructing the American Ambassa-
dor * * to examine with you * * * how 
an intelligent program of American aid 
* * * can serve to assist Vietnam In its 
present hour of trial. 
He added: 
The purpose of this offer is to assist 
the Government of Vietnam in developing 
and maintaining a strong, viable state capa-
ble of resisting attempted subversion or ag-
gression through military means. * * 
The U.S. Government hopes that such aid, 
combined with your own continuing efforts, 
will contribute effectively toward an inde-
pendent Vietnam endowed with a strong gov-
ernment. 
It is evident therefore, that Secretary 
Dean Rusk and other administration 
apologists for waging an American war 
in Vietnam are reckless and careless with 
the truth. There was no commitment 
by three Presidents. Regretably, there 
is a commitment by one President, the 
present Commanding Officer of our 
Armed Forces, President Johnson. 
Vietnam wits never, and is not now, of 
strategic or economic importance to the 
defense of the United States. 
WISCONSIN FARMERS POUR HARD 
WORK, INVESTMENT, GREAT EF-
FICIENCY INTO PRODUCTION 
Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, too 
few Americans appreciate the amazing 
technological revolution that has taken 
place on our dairy farms. The American 
dairy farmer has made a huge contribu-
tion to the remarkable standard of liv-
ing in this country. 
At this time when farmers are being so 
unfairly blamed for inflation, more 
Americans should realize that it is pri-
marily because of the remarkable in-
crease in farm efficiency, the hard work 
of farmers, and the very heavy invest-
ment they have made that America has 
in fact enjoyed the most stable prices 
since World War II of any country in the 
world. 
The farmer and his family have re-
ceived little benefit from this. In gen-
eral he has been left out of the affluent 
society.

him, to milk is fast. I visited a farmer north 
of Madison who lixe3 the ultimate in milking

MILE ING IN THE BLOB 
Mr. Beane is preparing to estall a milking 
parlor setup in June. The iond around his 
barns is only temperary?pD.einced by heavy 
construction equip. aent. 
At present, each of the cow has a separate 
stall. The milker must go to a. cow, milk 
her, carry the milk to the teritrally placed 
strainer, return to another cow, milk her, 
and so on. This amounts t t about 2 miles 
of legwork a day, figures Mr Beane. 
With the parlor, the milker remains in one 
plane. The cows file past on both sides on 
-radiant platforms; the farmer doesn't have to 
stoop. Eight cows ere milko I at a time. 
Milk is automatically carrt d to the tank, 
Feed is automatically measured to each cow 
according to her needs. Washing the milkers 
and tank is done by pushbutttan. The parlor 
is sprayed out wich pressurf,,ed hot water. 
Few farmers are using the. parlor setup. 
It cost.s up to $40,00 I to build But for large

READING AND WRITIL 
"We started after the war w Mi a model A 
:Ford, the shirts on our hacks and $100 
in: our pockets," recalls Mrs. ileane in her 
kitchen. Dressed in blue jee its, her hair 
rolled up, she often takes her , urn at milk-
ing. 
April 21;, 1966 
She adds: "But how mane people after 20 
years can boast a $200,000 investinent?" 
Mrs. Beane keeps busy with constant 
chores, which currently include caning a 
chair and refinishing some century-old 
antiques. 
The kitchen, study, and living room are 
full of farm journals and every conceivable 
dairy magazine. Mrs. Beane is taking a 'aria-
log course at a nearby college and helps her 
husband with his letters and articles. 
After the war, Mr. Beane went to work for 
his father-in-law on a wage basis. Later, lei 
Went on a 60-40 basis, with Mr. Beane paying 
part of the costs and receiving part of the 
earnings. Eventually, he bought tlie farm 
and ever since has built up oplity.. 
Situated at the base of 'several smell hills, 
the Beane farm is ideal for dairying. Land 
around here once grew wheal. But LI ,e earth 
was worn and rolling and wheat by the 1860s 
was moving West. In the years before 1900, 
dairying slowly took hold as Winconsin's 
major farm income. 
DAIRYING A MIS]: N ESS 
"Today," says Mr. Beane, "land taxes aro 
high. The soil is not as deep as in Illinois 
and other Midwestern States. It is too hilly. 
"Because of this it is not profitable to raise 
cattle or cash crops. The Mod is ideal for 
milk herds. We buy our feed but raise most 
silage and roughage." 
Making a dairy farm pay today is no sim-
ple matter. No longer is dairying a way of 
life. The farmers who don't maize dairying a 
business are the ones forced to quit. 
Running a paying business means keeping 
records of costs, income, and efficiency. To 
the dairyman, this means keeping close tabs 
on each cow. More specificsJy, how much 
butter fat does she produce? 
The farmer gets paid for the butter fat in 
his milk. Mr. Beane averages ii00 pounds per 
cow per year. This is good, though many 
farmers get 600 pounds or more. 
COMPUTERIZED COWS 
To keep accurate records or 120 cows, Mr. 
Beane uses a computer. He is a firm sup-
porter of computer farming. As head of the 
DHIA, he travels over the country spreading 
interest in it. 
To date, about 20 percent of the country's 
dairy cows are analyzed by computers. This 
is how it works for Mr. Beane: 
Once a month, a sample of milk from each 
cow is tested for butterfat. Tae records are 
sent to the Madison ARC offices. Using a 
computer, cow production records, Mr. 
I3eane's income, feed costs, and so on, are 
compared. 
The result is a couple of sheets of tabula-
tions. They rate the individua performance 
of each cow in the herd. A letter is assigned 
to each cow. An "A" cow is I'; ruingwell in 
relation to costs. A "D" cow is doing poorly. 
Thus very quickly, Mr. Beane can deter-
mine which cows he must replace. There is 
no guessing. Before, the cow !fiat was sold 
generally was the one which eat dirtient or 
kicked the most. 
Without such individual records, the 
dairyman has only one. Thin is the total 
herd's milk production and bidterfal. con-
tent. 
Thus DMA records allow Mr. Beane to cull 
least profitable cows, feed the rest according 
to production needs, and sele,it the most 
suitable for breeding. 
It is dark outside when event ;g millsing in 
over, Mr. Beane turns out the e'ht'; in Ins 
milk room, walks through his barn?the cows 
bedded down around him?and steps out 
into his yard. 
Dairying is not the business IL ,r the farmer 
who minds lacing tied down. Always the 
cows must be milked twice a day. 
When Mr. Beane returns to his barn, it will 
be 4:30 a.m. tomorrow. The cows will va 
be milked and fed again.

responsibility for controlling prices and the 
economic impact especially in the case of 
hides, was unjustly placed on the one part 
of that industry least capable of absorbing 
the enormous loss. 
The final solution to the problem of infla-
tion certainly is to have as many consumer 
goods available as the public demands. We 
recognize that the control of inflation is a 
serious responsibility of the administration, 
but that it has two prongs. One of them is 
obviously the removal of surplus purchasing 
capacity. This, can be clone by tax increases 
or by slowing up the construction program 
in those industries already superheated, or, 
it can be done by increasing interest rates, 
which is about the harshest method that can 
be used. 
On the other hand, inflation can be con-
trolled by increasing the amount of con-
sumer goods available. In the case of farm 
products, the major method used in our 
society to increase productivity, and thereby 
lower prices, is to give sufficient price incen-
tives to indicate to the producers that there 
is a possibility of a profit for the expanded 
production necessary to control the price 
Increases. In the case of pork, beef, and 
beef products, the price which must be con-
sidered is the average of the cyclical fluctua-
tions. An attack on the high point of the 
cyclical fluctuations Can SDI'VD to increase the 
pressure of prices, not to reduce them. 
The Grange appreciates the opportunity 
to cooperate with the administration for the 
improvement of the agricultural section of 
our economy. We recognize the tremendous 
responsibility placed upon it to maintain a 
stable economy. We are well aware that in-
flation frequently and usually strikes hard-
est at farmers. 
Our concern at the present is twofold. 
We believe the responsibility for controlling 
inflation should be more widely shared than 
it would be if the primary object of con-
trolling consumer prices is to roll back farm 
prices. 
We also believe that the distinguished 
public servant who has served so well as the 
Secretary of Agriculture for the past 5 years 
has been one of, if not, the greatest, of all 
the Secretaries of Agriculture. 
We would be extremely agitated if the 
action of the administration during this pres-
ent financial difficulty, would continue to be 
such that the effectiveness of this great ad-
ministrator and public servant, would be 
either temporarily reduced, or permanently 
destroyed.

FORT WAYNE AIDS VIETNAM 
REFUGEES 
Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it is with a 
strong sense of pride that I call atten-
tion to an unique people-to-people pro-
ject being conducted by the people of 
Fort Wayne, Ind., in cooperation with 
the International Union of Electrical, 
Radio, and Machine Workers. Virtually 
all sections of the community are raising 
funds for the IUE refugee resettlement 
village, to help the innocent victims of 
the Vietnamese conflict rebuild their 
lives. 
During the last week of April, civic and 
religious groups, industrial and labor or-
ganizations, high school and college stu-
dent governments, Boy Scouts and other 
local Fart Wayne groups will join the 
IUE in soliciting funds for the refugee 
village. A rally will be held on May 1, 
Law Day, sponsored by the IUE with the 
Fort Wayne Bar Association. The 15,000 
seats of the Allen County Memorial 
Coliseum are expected to be filled with 
Hoosier men, women, and children inter-
ested in helping Vietnamese refugees 
reconstruct their lives. 
Under the slogan "Win the peace by 
winning the people," the IUE will set up 
a town in Vietnam for the use of refugees 
from the war. Working closely with the 
Agency for International Development, 
the IUE has consulted with the Con-
federation of Vietnamese Labor?CVT?
who recommended that the refugee vil-
lage be started. This refugee resettle-
ment village will be a community in 
which the displaced persons can begin a 
new life, in a neighborhood of homes, 
farms, jobs, schools, and health clinics. 
For the more than 1 million Viet-
namese refugees these villages are a 
desperate need. Such villages, as the 
one planned by the IUE, mean five im-
portant things in the world to men, wo-
men, and children who are exiles in their 
own country: first, a refuge of peace 
from the ravages and horrors of war; 
second, shelter and food; third, medical 
attention; fourth, the chance of reunit-
ing dispersed and broken families; and, 
fifth, the opportunity to earn a living. 
Already the movement of 300 selected 
families is anticipated to the village site. 
These, persons will provide a new source 
for agricultural produce for the Cam 
Ranh area as well as furnish skilled 
workers for the city's industry. Com-
munitywide fund raising endeavors 
across the United States, in other towns 
as generous as Fort Wayne, will provide 
the necessary money for these 300 Viet-
namese families to move in, clear the 
land, and put in crops before the rainy 
season starts in September.

ton Evening Star on April 18, 1966, be 
printed in the RECORD. I was pleased to 
see that the Evening Star has endorsed 
the need for Federal regulation in the 
auto safety field and commend this 
article to the attention of my colleagues. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
NADER AND THE INDUSTRY 
It, is not very often in this era of big gov-
ernment, big business and mass-produced 
public response that one man, acting alone, 
can make the Nation sit up and take notice. 
Ralph Nader has done just that. 
Nader, a 31-year-old Washington attorney, 
has for the past several years staged a one-
man campaign against the world's biggest 
business, the automobile industry. What 
his charge boils down to is that the auto-
makers are more interested in making money 
than in safe design. And he has made a 
convincing case. 
No one will dispute the industry's right 
to make a healthy profit. But Nader's ac-
cusation is that the automakers have pur-
posefully prevented the public from hearing 
about potentially fatal flaws in their cars for 
fear of losing customers to the competition. 
The only answer, Nader believes, is in en-
forced public disclosure of detected defects 
and in Federal laws governing car safety 
standards. 
Since Nader began making his charges?
first in the book "Unsafe At Any Speed" and 
currently in testimony before Senate com-
mittees?some startling facts have come to 
light. For the first time the general public 
has learned that hundreds of thousands of 
cars have been quietly called back over the 
past 5 years because of unsafe design fea-
tures?flaws that include sticking throttles, 
faulty door catches, fenders that cut into 
tires and bottoms unable to clear low ob-
structions in the road. 
The industry, as might be expected, re-
acted sharply. First there was the episode 
of the sub rosa investigation of Nader's per-
sonal life by a small army of private investi-
gators. When that failed to quiet their 
critic, there were outraged protests from the 
several companies named and cries that the 
charges were unfair and unfounded. 
The latest to cry foul was Henry Ford II, 
who charged that Nader is not qualified to 
express an opinion. "If he's that good an 
engineer, we have some good jobs here and 
I'll be glad to give him one," Ford said, "but 
I don't think he knows what he's talking 
about." 
That doesn't quite answer Nader. It 
hardly takes an engineer to know that some-
thing is amiss when the throttle sticks open 
at a high speed, or the door flies open, or a 
car hangs up in the middle of a railroad 
crossing. 
The auto companies have asked the Sen-
ate for the chance to draw up and enforce 
their safety regulations before Congress im-
poses mandatory Federal standards. But 
judging from the remarks of several com-
mittee members, the pervading congressional 
sentiment seems to be that Federal regula-
tion is overdue. 
That is our view, too. 
COLLABORATION BETWEEN DE-
PARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND DE-
FENSE-ORIENTED INDUSTRIES 
Mr. BREWSTER. Mr. President, in 
these days of sustained military crisis, 
the need for fruitful collaboration be-
tween the Department of Defense and 
defense-oriented industries is absolutely 
essential. 
Recently, I had the pleasure of reading 
a speech on this subject by my good 
friend, Thomas S. Nichols. Mr. Nichols 
is a distinguished and respected resident 
of Maryland. He is also chairman of the 
executive committee of the Olin Mathie-
son Chemical Corp., and as such, he pos-
sesses a firsthand knowledge of the rela-
tionship between defense industry and 
the Defense Department. 
On the basis of his expertise, Mr. 
Nichols has been chosen to sit for two 
terms on the Defense Industry Advisory 
Council, a body created in 1962 by Secre-
tary McNamara to act as a catalyst be-
tween Government and industry. 
Thomas Nichols' very pertinent re-
marks demonstrate how important it is 
for defense industry and the Defense 
Department to be able to explain them-
selves to one another directly and per-
sistently. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the speech of Thomas S. 
Nichols at the National Security Indus-
trial Association advance planning brief-
ing in St. Louis in March be printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the speech 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

alitiz NEED To KNOW AND THE DUTY To TELL 
The,o) are strenuous days. The budget for 
the Department of Defense this coming fiscal 
year involves expenditures of about $66 bil-
lion- more than one-half of the total Fed-
eral outlay. At the same moment?next fall 
to be strictly accurate?W, million young; 
Americans will enter college * * twice the 
total enrollment in our colleges and univer-
sities just 20 years ago. I have linked these 
two figures side by side advisedly. For to-
gether they illustrate once more, and dra-
matically so, the eternal effervesence of the 
American spirit, even under the threat of 
00111101 is challenge. 
To me it is reassuring to know that in 
race sat great strains on our fiscal resources 
because of Peiping aggression, we are still 
movie il boldly ahead on the domestic front 
to perform miracles like making next fall's 
freshman class larger than the total college 
enrollment 20 years ago. Such unshakable 
confidence has always been an indomitable 
feature of the American tradition. When, 
no more than 2 to 5 percent of those between. 
18 end 21 in England or the Continent were 
cm:Mica in higher education during the first 
half of this century, the United States had 
10 percent by 1930 even during the depres-
shin. Today it is 30 percent and by 1980 it 
will reach 50 percent. But each such ad-
Vance, as we well know, can only be won if 
the courageous, adventurous, inventive-
genius, and management of American indus-
try is; not muzzled. 
'Civil years ago we spent close to $2 billion 
roe expanding the facilities of higher edu-
eation. By 1975 it will take $33 billion. 
Meanwhile our defense expenditures must 
go on, 
;0 fir we have elected to undertake two 
major task without skipping a beat: First, 
to protect our national security and redeem 
tior commitments to people who have been 
the victims of aggression; second, to raise 
the oia terial and cultural facets of American 
life to even higher summits. We have 
;elected to do both at once. But since not 
ino many listen, we must ask toe question 
over and again: "Can the economy generate 
such sums to do both'?" I lean to the opti-
mejje view. But sometimes when I become 
ocesimeitic, I think of the bullock in India 
wilu-Nes chased by a tiger across a clearing to 
the edge of a forest. As he lumbered awk-
warely ahead he saw a monkey high up in 
a trim and shouted: "Do you think I can 
climb this tree?" "Brother," snapped the 
Monkey quickly, "It's no longer a matter of 
op moo. You've got to climb this tree." 
And_ so it is. And so it is in our long 
adventure with free government that at this 
conjunction of war and, revolution and 
doniestiC disorders, the private sector of our 
economy is put to the supreme test. More 
lien af any other time in the Nation's life-
line we need to perfect the proper meshing 
of ties Notion's huge industrial capability 
with mu. military machinery of defense. It 
ie 1,)w; :rd the refinement of such relation-
ships idea we meet today. 
its ['resident Eisenhower perceptively 
stated in his farewell address early in 1961. 
until World War II the United States had no 
armaments industry, and the coming to-
gether of an immense Military Establish-
:timid, oml a large arms industry is new in 
the American experience. Today--20 years 
away from World War ti--the Congruence of 
our iminstrial and military components in a 
standing partnership has become an accepted 
tact ed national life. A most important 
breakthrough in relating indthetry to defense 
occurred 4 years ago with the establishment 
of Lie iiefense Industry Advisory Council. 
This body was created in 1962 by Secre-
tary McNamara and was directed for the 
first 2 years by the skillful hands of Secre-
tary McNamara and Mr. Roswell Gilpatric. 
Starting in February 1964, Cyrus Vance has 
served, as its energetic and imaginative 
ciaarirnan. 
The function .ief the Council, in a word, is 
that of catalyst in the intricate relations be-
tween government and industry. In this 
sense, both the Defense Industry Advisory 
Council with its working groups composed 
of specialists in their fields and the Na-
tional Security industrial Association assist 
in presenting industry experience and judg-
ment in the formulation of procurement 
policy practices within iebe Defense Depart-
ment. The objectives of the Council are 
threefold: 
1. To provide the Secretary of Defense and 
his principal managemeni assistants with a 
forum for the mesentatimi of logistics man-
agement ob3ectives to a representative cross 
section of the defense industry; 
2. To provide representatives of the de-
fense industry a forum for discussing directly 
with Defense Departmeni; executives their 
suggestions and criticisms, 
3. To provide a focal point for a topside re-
view and discussion of industry study group 
findings that ought to be brought to the 
direct attention of the Se. retary of Defense. 
Essentially the Council aspires to engineer 
a continuous dialog between our indus-
trial and defense machinery. The Council 
has met a dozen times for 2-day sessions 
since its creation, representing among its 22 
members from business :lad industry?tex-
tiles, automotive vehicles, shipbuilding, air-
craft, ordnance, space missides, instrumenta-
tion, chemicals, communnations, and com-
puters, to name but a few. All Council 
members are; seeleted by he Secretary and 
Deputy Secretary of Defense from several 
hundred nominees subme tied by a variety 
of organizations. Membela speak only for 
themselves, not for their companies or an 
industry segment. One-t n(rd to one-half 
the membership is rotated every 2 years. I 
am now in nay second term. 
One final word about thss operation of the 
Defense Industry Advisorly Council: it is a 
sounding board, not a voting body. It 
werks tirelessly to identify inconsistencies in 
current regulations or to htisk into the policy 
of allowance on incl.:mend:int research and 
Government cost and a vast catalog of 
other problems affecting the defense 
industry. 
nehind the curtain of confusion that too 
often surrounds the relations between the 
private and public sectors of our Nation, the 
Council is breaking new ground and opening 
new windows of communication. There is 
no more supreme mission so which Govern-
ment and, industry can esign itself in a 
vigorous effort to assure the survival of our 
system of government and free enterprise. 
For unfortunately today we too often seem 
to communicate with each other in a manner 
which may produce peeVLAI rejoinders and 
coiinter-rejoindera which 8 a not clarify Mis-
understandings or honest disagreement. 
1VP need to explain ourseives more directly 
end more persistently. Wc need more face-
to- esice encounters for vent i latin.g viewpoints, 
and the Defense Industry Advisory Council 
provides just such an iiistrument. Even 
more, it offers the kind of a vehicle for trans-
mitting the creative limo ;uses of private 
enterprise to the topside policymakers of 
government. We need to build in more 
enclaves in the private FR ittor to perform 
the same function. For in a test of wills we 
TTI132t live up to our convietion that only in 
socieiiies where the economies are free does 
real freedom survive. Tolay, of the 115 
members in the Uinted Nal ions, 80 are non-
democratic societies. Indeed, the peril 
points for American policy nox the compass, 
but; we need not despair. The stars will not 
fall from the heavens if 'We will keep our 
heads, not zigzag our policies by reacting or 
overreacting to what others do, and if we 
will seek new forms to strenitthen freedom in 
April 25, 1966 
the economy. We ha,ve just begun to grow; 
to acquire our second wind. And let no one 
try to flog us into being ashamed of it. 
All around us we know the world is more 
expulsively stacked?a quarrelsome world 
confounded by the surging force of people, 
politics, and power. In this setting, the 
United States still sways the destiny of people 
and nations, but we can cOntinue to do so 
only so long as we sustain our growth and 
the doctrines of freeclona that have always 
animated our course. We dare not fail. 
COMMUNITY RELATIONS 
SERVICE TRANSFER 
Mr. ERVIN. Mr. President, on De-
cember 9, 1965, I wrote to President 
Johnson concerning his proposed trans-
fer of the Community Relations Service 
from the Department of Commerce to 
the. Department of Justice. In that let-
ter, I explained why I felt that a police-
man could never become an effective 
conciliator. While we look upon the 
Commerce Department as neutral in its 
approach to human problems as well as 
economic problems, we know that the 
Justice Department is charged with an-
other responsibility?that of enforce-
ment and prosecution. Although the 
Justice Department can no doubt per-
form its prosecution function better with 
access to the heretofore confidential files 
of the Community Relations Service, the 
conciliation function of CRS is bound to 
be impaired. 
A copy of my letter was sent to the 
Justice Department. Although I never 
received from it what I considered to be 
an adequate reply, the administration's 
proposal became Reorganization Plan 
No. 1 of 1966. I then submitted a copy 
of my letter of Docember 9 to the mem-
bers of the Reorganization Subcommittee 
of the Senate Government Operations 
Committee. I do not believe that the 
points raised in my letter were answered 
either by a majority on the committee, 
or on the Senate floor during debate on 
the transfer, and I was deeply distressed 
that the Members of this body chose to 
follow meekly the mistaken suggestion of 
the administration. 
The full consequences Of this reorgani-
zation are treated by Da v id Lawrence in 
his article, "Unprecedented Step by Con-
gress," which appeared in the Evening 
Star of April 22, 1966. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that Mr. Lawrence's article be 
printed in the REcoso. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

Vermont Royster. 
The announcement of this year's 
award was carried in papers across the 
. country; but I ask unanimous consent 
that the article in his own Wilmington 
Morning Star of Friday, April 15, 1966, 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
AL G, DICKSON WINS JOURNALISM AWARD 
Al G. Dickson, executive editor of the Star-
News newspapers, won the Sigma Delta Chi 
Distinguished Service award for 1965 in the 
field of editorial writing. 
Notification of the national honor was re-
ceived Thursday from Russell E. Hurst, ex-
ecutive officer of the professional journalistic 
society. 
The citation read: 
"Dickson is cited for his single editorial, 
published November 11, 1965, in which he 
forcefully expresses the view that the new 
Hanover County sheriff is not strong enough 
to face the serious threat the Ku Klux Klan 
could make to his community. The editorial 
shows extensive investigation and careful 
consideration in reaching its conclusions. 
"Dickson's stand on an issue where emo-
tions were running high exemplifies civic 
responsibility, leadership and courage of 
wlkich American journalism can be proud." 
He is the second North Carolina editor to 
win the Sigma Delta Chi editorial award in 
the 26-year history of the editorial competi-
tion. The other was the late Cecil Prince, of 
the Charlotte News, in 1959. David Brinkley, 
NBC news commentator and formely of Wil-
mington, won the SDX award for radio or TV 
newswriting in 1960. 
Dickson writes approximately 150 to 200 
editorials annually. Most of them are on 
local subjects. During the last several years 
he has won six awards in the editorial com-
petition sponsored by the North Carolina 
Press Association. These include two firsts, 
two seconds, a third and a fourth place. 
He began his career on the Wilmington 
News on June 15, 1929, after attending North 
Carolina State University at Raleigh and 
Wofford College in Spartanburg, S.C. 
Through a series of promotions, he served as 
managing editor of the Wilmignton Morning 
Star, the Wilmington News and editor of both 
newspapers. He was appointed executive edi-
tor in 1955. He is a former president of the 
North Carolina Association of Afternoon 
Dailies and the United Press International 
Editors Association of North Carolina. He is 
now serving as vice president of the Asso-
ciated Dailies of the North Carolina Press 
Association. 
His late father, John G. Dickson, was a 
veteran North Carolina newspaperman, hav-
ing served in editorial capacities on the 
Greensboro Daily News and Record, Charlotte 
Observer, the Gastonia Gazette, and Rock 
Hill (S.C.) Herald. His mother lives in Char-
lotte. 
Among promient American editors who 
have won the SDX editorial award are Allen 
Drury, Felix R. McKnight, Alan Barth, Vir-
&mins Debney, Robert M. White, H, Robert 
Estabrook, James J. Kilpatrick, Vermont 
Royster and Hodding Carter III. 
Sigma Delta Chi is a professional society 
for men engaged in journalism. It is dedi-
cated to the highest ideals of the profession 
and is comparable to those professional org-
anizations serving the fields of medicine and 
In this role, it constantly endeavors to 
raise the standards of competence of its mem-
bers, to recognize outstanding achievement 
by journalists, to recruit and hold able 
young talent for journalism, to advance the 
cause of freedom of information, and to ele-
vate the prestige of journalism to every re-
spect. 
Founded as a fraternity at DePauw Uni-
versity, Greencastle, Ind., in 1909, Sigma 
Delta Chi changed its designation in 1960 
to that of a professional society of journal-
ists. It is a nonprofit, voluntary association, 
with a worldwide membership of men en-
gaged in every field of journalism. Its mem-
bership extends horizontally to include men 
engaged in the communication of fact and 
opinion by all media, and it extends vertically 
to include in its purposes and fellowship all 
rangs of journalists. 
Jurors for the 1965 SDX awards contest 
included Dean Wayne A. Danielson, of the 
University of North Carolina Scho 1 
Journalism. 
"We aren't just going to dump the whole 
amount in the villages in one big splash," 
said Maj. Gen. Fred C. Weyand, 25th Division 
commander. 
Instead, the goods will be doled out strictly 
on the basis of need, with a full accounting 
and control system to make sure none of the 
goods find their way into the black market 
or the hands of the Vietcong. 
Donations by individual communities in 
Hawaii won't be going to specific villages 
here and at the 3d Brigade's operating site 
near Pleiku. 
This is how it will work: 
A guarded warehouse is going up at Chu 
Chi where all the goods (worth about $800,-
000) are being categorized and stored. 
Each unit within the 25th Division has 
been given a hamlet to build up. 
As an item is shown to be needed in the 
hamlet (paint, clothes, shoes, etc.), the unit 
will draw the goods from the central storage 
place and allow Vietnamese authorities to 
distribute it to the people. 
They don't just hand out clothes whole-
e. It must be on a basis of need. 
For example, one of the contributions here 
recently was to 10 families of Vietnamese 
Army soldiers killed along with 2 Ameri-
can advisers near Phumoc My in a Vietcong 
ambush. 
Clothes have been distributed in the 
Catholic refugee village of Bac Ha here, and 
to Montagnards in the 3d Brigade's area in 
the central Vietnam highlands. 
There was $5,500 in cash donated by people 
in Hawaii, and that has gone into a special 
fund for village projects. 
"For instance, the 3d Brigade builds a 
spillway for people to utilize a stream to 
wash and, get their water," Colonel Hicks 
explained. "We authorize use of funds for 
that type of project." 
Hawaii's contribution probably will be 
spilled out throughout Vietnam for the com-
ing year wherever units of the 25th Division 
operate, 
An operating table and anesthesia machine 
donated by the Wahiawa General Hospital 
will be the nucleus of the planned Medical 
Center at Chu Chi. 
All the rubber sandals collected are find-
ing their way to villagers' feet. 
Above all, the division is trying to avoid 
the kind of wholesale distribution of gifts 
which all too often has only a brief effect 
in the village or is mistaken as a case of 
Americans showing off their wealth. 
The 21 sewing machines the division got 
before leaving will be used for that dress-
making class here as soon as an instructor 
can be found. 
AID TO VIETNAMESE VILLAGERS?
OPERATION HELPING HAND 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, when 
Hawaii's famed 25th Division was sent 
to Vietnam, the people of Hawaii dipped 
deep into their pockets?and their 
hearts?for Operation Helping Hand, to 
help Vietnamese villagers in the areas 
where the division was ordered into 
action. 
Some 270 tons of goods worth an esti-
mated $800,000 have arrived in Vietnam 
and are now being stored and categor-
ized in a warehouse for distribution by 
25th Division personnel. 
I ask unanimous consent that the lat-
est report on Operation Helping Hand, 
written by Bob Jones, of the Honolulu 
Advertiser's Saigon bureau, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
CHU CIII GETS HAWAII AID 
(By Bob Jones) 
CHU CHI, VIETNAM,--HaWall'S Operation 
Helping Hand is reaching out to this needy 
village 30 miles northwest of Saigon. 
Already some 270 tons of goods donated in 
the late February campaign have arrived in 
Vietnam. Four hundred boxes weighing 450 
pounds apiece have reached the 25th Divi-
sion headquarters, and another 800 boxes are 
on the docks at this writing. 
About 300 boxes are underway by ship. 
Far from the riots and anti-American dem-
onstrations of Saigon, Chu Chi is more con-
cerned about building a complete medical 
center for the district, finding an instructor 
to give dressmaking classes to villagers and 
virtually building Chu Chi into a model vil-
lage. 
It will all be done, villagers hope, with 
what Hawaii citizens and civic groups do-
nated under Operation Helping Hand when 
the 25th Division left the islands. 
"It's been the greatest exhibit of help to 
anyone I've ever witnessed," said Lt. Col. 
Robert R. Hicks, the man in charge of seeing 
that the goods are distributed where they 
will do the most good. 
"The folks in Hawaii really took this to 
their hearts, right down to the little kid with 
17 cents who said, 'This is all I have to 
offer.'" 
Operation Helping Hand won't be as spec-
tacular as some people may expect. 
PRESENT STATE OF AMERICAN 
FARM INCOME 
Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President, this 
morning I received a long and very well-
written letter from Harry L. Graham, 
legislative representative of the National 
Grange.. I think it is significant, and 
should be brought to the attention of 
the Senate. It presents a balanced plc: 
ture of the present state of American 
agriculture, and shows that farm in-
come has turned the corner. 
The, national picture is well illustrated 
in Mr. Graham's letter. I would add 
that in Minnesota, as well, the progress 
has been encouraging. Net farm income 
in Minnesota was $433 million in 1960, 
and preliminary estimates for 1965 in-
dicate it was up 23 or 24 percent?about 
$100 million. Net income per farm is 
estimated to have risen 35 percent from 
the $2,776 in 1960?an increase of roughly 
$1,000 per farm.

fl1;;S CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
But farm income is not as high as it 
should be. Recent reports show it at 
roughly 82 or 83 per cent of parity--
without including Government pay-
ments?and I am old fashioned enough 
to think that it should be 100 percent. 
'rho American consumer does in fact 
receive the best food in the world at the 
lowest prices?and the American farmer 
still receives an income too low for his 
input of capital, labor, and productive 
know-how. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that Mr. Graham's letter be printed 
in the RECORD. 
Tiiire being no objection, the letter 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
NATION-AL GRANGE, 
Washington, D.C., April 22, 1966. 
lion, WALTER IVIONDALE, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, D .c 
SENATOR MONDALE: The Grange has 
been deeply disturbed by the recent harsh 
criticisms of the Secretary of Agriculture, 
Orville L. Freeman, and the public demands 
for his resignation. The Grange also regrets 
the circumstances compelling the Secretary 
to appear in opposition to further increases 
in farm prices due to the pressure to control 
inflation. We do not believe that th.e difficul-
ties are sufficient to warrant a complete dis-
regard of over 5 years of devoted and dis-
tinguished service to domestic and interna-
timid agriculture. 
tit 
in. 1961, Secretary Freeman has fought 
valiantly for programs to reduce our sur-
pluses, improve domestic farm income, ex-
pand our international trade, reduce farm 
program costs, and improve the image of the 
American farmer at home and abroad. The 
Grange gladly joined in that fight, and 
together we have rejoiced at the substantial 
victories. 
'In' Secretary has led the fight against 
those whose vested interests are best served 
by low farm prices and huge reserves. 
II, should be pointed out that much of the 
opposition to the programs of the Secretary 
has come from the storage and warehouse 
owners and the grain trade. At the time 
Mr. Freeman became Secretary, every ware-
;moan in this country was bulging with 
grp,in, and we had stored excess surpluses in 
mar, y kinds of inadequate auxiliary build-
ings. Vigures indicate that the Department 
Oi Agriculture is presently using only 17 per-
cent, of available private storage space for 
the storage or CCC stocks. The situation 
has changed from surpluses of commodities 
0, surpluses of warehouse space. This was 
a priinary objective of the program. 
1ff had to fight those who consider their 
political interests best served by snaking it 
impossible for him to be a successful Secre-
tary. Some of the voices today raised in the 
chorus against Mr. Freeman are the same 
voices we have heard for the past 51/, years. 
'they do not want a solution; they want a 
sacrifice. Nothing reasonable could be said 
in defense of the Secretary which would be 
acceptable to these people. Unfortunately, 
he aini had to defend himself from those 
within agriculture who prefer policy to price 
when price is involved, and price to policy 
When policy is involved. Those whose blind 
inilierence to an oversimplified and out-
dated concept of agricultural marketing led 
them to prefer the disastrous cyclical fluctu-
ations of the market to programs which per-
mit an orderly development and maintenance 
of a stable and fair market price. 
however, there are those concerned farm-
ern and farm leaders who now pounce upon 
him in the dilemma imposed upon him by 
his responsibility to the total society. They 
are trying to prove he is antifarmer and 
therefore should retire as Secretary. To all 
of them, we would suggest a careful and obs 
pective look at the record. 
1. Net farm :income has increased from 
$11.7 billion in 1960 to $14.1 billion in 1965, 
with predictions for a not income of $15.1 
billion in 1966. This is an increase of 29 
percent. Cash receipts from pork increased 
from $2.9 billion in 1960 to $3.7 billion in 
1965 with predictions of a4.1 billion in 1966, 
an increase of 31 percent Cash receipts for 
beef have increased from $7.6 billion in 1960 
to $8.85 billion in 1965, ?with predictions of 
cash receipts of $10 billion in 1966, an in-
crease of 45 percent. Income from crops 
totalled $15.8 billion in 1.960; $19.6 billion 
in 1935; with estimates of $20.2 billion in 
1966, an increase of 28 percent. 
2. The Secretary has foeight for the enact-
ment of legislation enabling the agricultural 
situation to move from one of surplus to 
one of balance. Stocks if both feed grains 
and wheat are down about a billion bushels 
each; stocks of dairy products have disap-
peared; and the preserL strength of our 
markets for agrtcultural products indicates 
the degree of success welch has been at-
tained. 
3. These increases in rarm income have 
been attained at very ingclest costs to the 
consumer. The price of wheat for flour for 
bread for the millers has remained practically 
unchanged for the past 5 years. Any in-
creases in the price of bread have been due 
to costs lather than the increase in the price 
or wheat. 
In general, there has teen no substantial 
increase in the price of perk and beef, except 
atir those choice items ir high demand. It 
is smyptomatic of our r resent affluent so-
ciety that the loudest cries about the cost 
of meat have been the cut of choice steaks 
and bacon. The increased spendable con-
sumer income has been ofsponsible for the 
demand of those high-pried meats, and has 
enabled speculators to push the price of 
ba.COn far beyond any reasonable relation-
ship to the price of the rest of the hog. 
Fortunately the present liacon price has as-
sured more reasonable levels. 
The price of lettuce an .1 some other vege-
tables and fruits have been directly in-
fluenced by the shortages. created by either 
'adverse weather conditions, or by the intensi-
fied labor situation caused by the termina-
tion of the braeero program. The farmer 
can hardly he he-id reepon 
Wffn the exceiption of about the last 4 
months, the steady trend in the price of 
food has been downward for many years, and 
the percentage of income spent for food, de-
spite the many built-in services not pre-
viously a part of the market basket, has 
declined. American consumers still are able 
to buy the widest variety of high quality 
foods for the smallest part of their earnings 
in all recorded history American con-
sumers literally live better today than kings 
and emperors did a hundred years ago. 
4. Secretary Freeman leis been a valiant 
defender of agriculture in our national econ-
omy. Most of the improved posture of 
American agriculture, both in the United 
States and throughout -Oaf world, has been 
the result of his efforie. The American 
farmer is now pictured as; a progressive 
scientist and businessman making substan-
tial, if not critical contributions, to the 
strength of our domesth economy, to the 
balance of payments to w?orld relief, and to 
the security of the free world. On an inter-
national level, he is no ,:anger regarded as 
a protected producer behind a high wall of 
Government subsidies trying to displace all 
the rest of agricultural mi., rivets of the world. 
Today he is thought of as a fair and honor-
able competitor in world cash markets and 
the major, if not the onlia supplier for the 
concessional markets and relief needs of the 
world. 
5. U.S. commercial agricultural exports 
Awil 25, 1966 
have increased substantially front the 1960 
level of $3.3 billion to last year's level of $4.7 
billion. During 1961-65, a continuation of 
U.S. commercial agricultural exports at the 
1960 level would have meant lower U.S. ex-
ports by $3.4 billion with a consequent fur-
ther deterioration in the U.S. balance of 
payments. Of this $3.4 billion, 1965 alone 
accounts for $1.4 billion. 
The 1966 outlook is for a further increase 
of U.S. commercial agricultural exports. 
6. During Secretary Freeman's tenure, 
American farm programs, have for the first 
time recognized the difference between the 
economic problems facing commercial farm-
ers and the more comnlicated social prob-
lems facing the marginal or low-income 
farmers. Programs have been devised to 
meet the specific problem-is of the latter 
group as well as those or the commercial 
farmers. We believe that these programs 
will get the same efficient administration as 
the others under his jurisdiction, and, if 
properly funded, will snake a great contri-
bution to the rural welfare 
7. In our judgment, the image of the 
USDA has improved vastly under Secretary 
Freeman's administration. During the last 
3 months, we have twice heard Mr. Shuman, 
president of the American Farm Bureau Fed-
eration, admit that the Secretary had not 
made any particular grab for power in areas 
where the Farm Bureau bad previously ex-
pressed major concern. Repeatedly, when 
this question of the Secret ary's relationship 
to the total agriculture arises, the critics say 
they do not fear Secretary Freeman but 
rather they fear a different kind of Secre-
tary in the future. 
Despite the added responsibilities of social 
programs given to the Department of Agri-
culture, the Department's budget has held 
relatively steady, and more important, the 
money which has been appropriated for farm 
programs has increasingly gone to the 
farmers. 
a The change in the, whole posture of 
American agriculture during the past 5 years 
has been almost unhelievabin. From a situa-
tion in which many of us were pessimistic 
about the future of agriculture, we now have 
created a situation in whicli we can look into 
this future with consider:1We optimism based 
upon valid factors and cot siderations. The 
enactment of the Agricultural Act of 1965 
gave a permanence and stability to working 
programs which have ruffle a tremendous 
contribution to this optimistic future. 
We are concerned, however, with the un-
justified correlation of farm prices with the 
cause of 'the increase of the cost of living. 
The price increases during the first quarter 
of this year should have been viewed as a 
seasonal adjustment upward as off-season 
fruits and vegetables increased in price. 
Most of our consumers have forgotten that 
it is only during the last few years that both 
fresh fruit and vegetables were obtainable in 
the United States during the winter months. 
It also appears to the Gra age that the price 
depressing techniques used in relation to 
pork, especially in terms el buying for the 
armed services, were premature in the light 
of the predicted increases of marketing and 
the usual seasonal adjustments downward 
during the second quarter of the year. The 
Bureau of Labor Statistics release of April 21 
indicated the seasonable adjustment down-
ward began with a decline of wholesale farm 
prices for last week of 1.7 percentage points 
from the previous week. 
The 'usefulness of selective controls at the 
farm level to prevent price increases has 
always been questionable. The experience 
of the Government in trying to control bread 
by the use of a consumer subsidy and trying 
to control the price of shoes by export quotas 
on hides indicates the futility of this ap-
proach. Despite the fact that all segments 
of any industry contribute to its price the

SMITHVILLE To GET NEW DOUGLAS PLANT 
Siurrnvim,n.?Douglas Aircraft Co. officials, 
who dedicated a new plan Friday at Sparta, 
are planning another new facility here, 
Representative JOE L. EVINS told the Banner. 
Evngs, who participated in the Friday 
ceremonies, said he had been discussing the 
possibilities of a Smithville plant with Doug-
las officials a long, long time and added that 
he has now received assurance that such a 
plant will be built. 
The Sparta plant dedicated last week is 
the first of four Douglas is building in the 
midstate area to begin operation. The oth-
ers, in addition to the Smithville plant, are 
at Carthage, Monterey, and Gainesboro. 
Regarding the Smithville plant announce-
ment, Evims said he had conferred with 
Wellword E. Beall, Long Beach, Calif., execu-
tive vice president for operations of Douglas. 
"I am most pleased and elighted with 
Douglas' decision," the Representative said. 
CAPITOL COMMENTS 
(By Joe L. Evins) 
The announcement of the decision by offi-
cials of the Douglas Aircraft industry of Cal-
ifornia to locate a fifth plant in our area?
the great Fourth Congressional District 
of Tennessee?underscores an encouraging 
trend of economic development in Appala-
chia and in other sections of rural and small-
town America. , 
Col. Wellwood E. Beall, executive vice presi-
dent of operations at Douglas, announced 
recently that Douglas would locate its fifth 
plant in Tennessee at Srnithville. The an-
nouncement was made at Sparta at a ban-
quet following dedication of a Douglas plant 
there. Others are being built and currently 
are in operation at Monterey, Carthage, and 
Gainesboro. 
Douglas is locating these manufacturing 
plants in our area in line with the Presi-
dent's recommendation for a broader based 
economic development which he?and Doug-
las officials?consider essential if this country 
is to make appreciable progress in solution of 
both rural and urban problems. 
As Colonel Bean said during the Sparta 
dedication, "What is needed is a reversal 
of the national trend toward urbanization. 
What is needed is an effort that will halt the 
drain of workers and youth from the Nation's 
small communities to urban areas, an effort 
that instead will take opportunity to these 
small communities and provide them with 
the economic ability upon which they can 
thrive." 
Colonel Beall also said this decentraliza-
tion of industry will "enhance the corner-
stone of our democracy, the American small 
town." This is most gratifying and most 
encouraging. This is a theme that your 
Representative has emphasized over a period 
of years. 
In May of 1965, for example, during hear-
ings of the Public Works Appropriations Sub-
committee, I made this statement: 
"There should be a national effort to en-
courage a buildup of small towns to capture 
tip best of the old?the community spirit 
and pride?and the best of the new. And 
by the new I mean modern industry and 
modern convenience and well-rounded econ-
omies." 
In a letter to President Johnson last July 
this approach was reiterated as I urged ad-
vocacy of programs for development of 
smalltown and rural America. 
Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman 
is preaching this gospel from coast to coast, 
Both Douglas Aircraft, which has located five 
plants in our district, and Lockheed?which 
is locating a plant in Shelbyville?subscribe 
to this theory of industrial decentralization. 
The growing acceptance of this concept 
points to a new era of growth for small 
towns and to new progress in all America. 
Joseph C. Harsch Sees Light Ahead in 
Vietnam 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. VANCE HARTKE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Monday, April 25, 1966 
Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, the dis-
tinguished journalist, Joseph C. Harsch, 
is one of the consistently perceptive 
analysts of public affairs whose voice 
continues to be one of reason and un-
derstanding. 
In his "State of the Nations" column 
appearing in the Christian Science Moni-
tor for April 13, he made some signifi-
cant observations leading to the conclu-
sion that in Vietnam it may now be pos-
sible to see in the future developments 
which could lead to ultimate solution. 
That possible solution, stemming from 
talks among the various elements among 
the Vietnamese as power now "is flowing 
visibly toward the Buddhists," may be 
in "a formula pointed toward a true 
neutralization of Vietnam." 
Mr. Harsch's analysis includes the 
enumeration of five elements in the situ-
ation which have now become altered to 
such an extent that what was impossible 
In the past may now be possible?name-
ly, a formula "pointed toward the true 
neutralization of Vietnam." This in turn 
would make it possible for the United 
States to "phase out," as Mr. Harsch 
puts it, "almost imperceptibly from its 
present position of prominence." 
I ask unanimous consent that the arti-
cle be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL REC-
ORD, and I urge all of my colleagues that 
it may be read with close attention. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
FIRST LIGHT AHEAD 
(By Joseph C. Harsch) 
WASIIINGTON.?For the first time since the 
? Vietnam war was "escalated" into a matter 
? of major concern to all countries of the world 
It now becomes possible to see ahead the 
general outlines of a conceivable compro-
mise settlement. 
The clue is to be found in statements from 
Senator RUSSELL, of Georgia, that if public 
opinion in Vietnam wanted the United 
States to leave, then the United States would 
leave. 
A Senator as well informed and prominent 
in Washington as Senator RUSSELL, and one 
who has been firmly on the "hawk" side of 
the Vietnam issue, Would hardly have ac-
cepted the possibility of an American with-
drawal unless he realized that events might 
be flowing in that direction. 
COMPROMISE SETTLEMENT 
If they are flowing in that direction, it is 
because there is a change in several circum-
stances affecting the attitude of various par-
ties toward a compromise settlement. The 
various elements can be listed roughly as fol-
lows: 
1. The Vietcong have suffered severely in 
recent fighting. They have not accepted a 
major battle since last November. War 
weariness is touching them as well as the 
general civilian population in Vietnam. 
2. Communist China no longer wields de-
cisive influence in Hanoi. Russian influence, 
built on better military aid than came from 
China, has gone up. The evidence is in the 
fact Le Duan, head of the formerly pro-
Chinese faction of the Vietnam Communist 
Party, led the Vietnam delegation to the re-
cent party congress in Moscow. He said 
notably: "Under the leadership of the glo-
rious party of Lenin, the Soviet people * * * 
are making a huge contribution to the libera-
tion of the working class, of all working peo-
ple and oppressed nations." 
3. American Armed Forces have greatly im-
proved their military position. It is a clear 
and established fact that they cannot be 
thrown out of Vietnam by Communist force. 
POLITICAL WEAKNESS 
4. But the local political base under Ameri-
can -military action in Vietnam has grown 
progressively weaker. 
5. Political power in Vietnam is flowing 
visibly toward the Buddhists. Washington is 
still trying to avoid giving them what they 
want and demand. But it is perfectly ob-
vious that it is now unrealistic to think they 
can long be kept away from power. And they 
have already offered to talk with any native 
political elements who want to talk with 
them. 
Now, the Buddhists do not want to be 
taken over by Communists any more than 
do the Catholics, or the soldiers. But they 
do want to see an end to fighting, if possible. 
There is nothing to prevent the Buddhists 
from working out a theoretical compromise 
with other native elements. Those other ele-
ments might now, for the first time, be will-
ing to consider a true compromise. 
The time is past when there would be any 
point in a conference involving the United 
States. It was always difficult to see how the 
United States could itself participate in 
negotiations. 
TRUE NEUTRALIZATION 
What could happen, therefore, is that talks 
among Buddhists, Catholics, Vietcong, and 
North Vietnamese elements?in fact already, 
going on?could conceivably arrive at a for-
mula pointed toward a true neutralization of 
Vietnam. 
It could happen because North Vietnam 
and Vietcong now realize they cannot win a 
decisive military victory; because Russia 
would rather see Vietnam neutralized than 
in Chinese hands; because the United States 
need not leave until or unless it is satisfied 
that true neutralization is involved in the 
formula; and because the United States need 
not be a party to any negotiations. 
Hence it is plausible to think that events 
will slide gradually now toward increasing 
Buddhist initiative making it possible for the 
United States to "phase out" almost inper-
ceptibly from its present position of promi-
nence. 
There is nothing sudden down such a road; 
? not even a moment when the United States 
would leave Vietnam. There might even 
be an American beachhead for quite a time 
as a guarantee of neutralism. It would be the 
slow road of "deesealation."

Douglas Aircraft Expands Its Plant 
Complex in Appalachia 
lilXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OP 
HON. JOE L. EVINS 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 1966 
Mr. EVINS of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, as a part of President Johnson's pro-
gram of economic development in Ap-
palachia, Douglas Aircraft Corp. is lo-
cating a complex of satellite plants in 
Appalachia in the Fourth District of 
Tennessee which f am honored to repre-
sent in the Congress. 
The latest announcement by Douglas 
officials was of the location of an as-
sembly plant in Smithville, Tenn. The 
announcement was made at the dedica-
tion of a plant in Sparta, Tenn., recently, 
and other Douglas plants are being built 
in Monterey, Gainesboro, and Carthage. 
The Honorable Wellwood E. Beall, ex-
ecutive vice president of operations at 
Douglas, emphasized during the dedica-
tion ceremonies that Douglas as a matter 
of policy will do its part in broadening 
the base of economic development in 
Arrierica?a trend which will help in 
solving both rural and urban problems. 
To help achieve this broader develop-
ment, Douglas is locating a number of 
smaller plants in smalltown America to, 
as Mr. Beall said, "protect and enhance 
the cornerstone of our democracy, the 
American small town."

a TWIN plant would be built at Smithville. 
Elders, in Sparta for the opening of a 36,000-
equare-foot airplane parts plant here, told 
the Banner, "I have received assurances from 
representatives of Douglas that a plant will 
be built here," adding that he had been dis-
missing, its possibilities "for a long, long 
time" with them. 
He said be had talked at length with Well-
wood E. Beall, Long Beach, Calif., executive 
vice president of operations for Douglas, 
,'bout the proposed plant in Smithville,

"I mu most. pleased and delighted with 
Douglas' decision to locate another Tennessee 
plant at Smithy ille," EVINS said. The Sparta 
plant is the first of four Douglas is building 
in the upper Cumberland section in middle 
e.ennessee other than the Smithville plant. 
The others are at Carthage, Monterey, and

ties under the direction of Ray W. Rice, 
Sparta manager of Douglas re,stern manu-
facturing locations. 
Beall and Gov. Frank 0. Clement cut the 
ribbon at the dedication. Other participants 
in Friday's ceremonies included Representa-
tives Evens; State industrial de eelopment di-
rector, Ralph W. Emerson; Sparta Mayor 
Harold Sims; and H. L. Thompson, director 
of facilities for Douglas Aircraft Division. 
TOUR PLANT 
Residents of Sparta and neige boring com-
munities toured the new plant at an open 
house following the ribbon cutting. 
At a dinner at the Sparta Country Club 
Friday night, Beall showed a Douglas film 
entitled "A Plan for Appalachia." which tells 
how the four new plants came alto being. 
"The story began a couple ol years ago," 
Bean said, "when the President of the United 
States asked several of the Nal ion's indus-
trial leaders, including Donald W. Douglas, 
Jr. (president of the firm), to contribute 
ideas toward the solution of a no tonal prob-
lem that has become known as Appalachia. 
As we all know, the actual prolaem has no 
simple geographical boundaries. 
"Our initial thought at Douglas was per-
haps typical, We would just go to Appa-
lachia, build a big plant, hire 500 or so peo-
ple, and that would take care 4 our con-
tribution." 
SECOND TH OUGHTS 
"Fortunately, we had second thoughts. 
Closer examination and analysis, with lots of 
help, convinced us that such a move would 
compound the problem rather than help re-
solve it. 
"What iv-as needed was a revtesal of the 
national trend toward urbanizalaon. What 
was needed was an effort that would halt the 
drain of workers and youth from the Na-
tion's small communities to urban areas, an 
effort that instead would take opportunity 
to these small communities and provide them 
with the economic ability upon which they 
would thrive instead of die, grow instead of 
wither away. 
"Douglas, with your help and encourage-
ment, has launched a program that shows 
the way to meet?and defeat--this problem. 
We believe it provides an example for the 
growth of American industry, a geirwth that 
can meet the needs of a dynamic industry 
and at the same time protect and enhance 
the cornerstone of our democracy, the Ameri-
can small town." 
REVOLUTIONARY 
Clement described the plan ae "revolu-
tionary," and predicted that other businesses 
would: follow Douglas' lead. Lamas called the 
opening of the plant a "great ol easion, a 
great leap forward for our section." 
Thompson, Clement, and other speakers at 
the dedication praised the part played by 
Emerson in the planning and development 
of the Douglas project in Tennessee. Clem-
ent said initial contact between the State 
and the aircraft company was merle on a 
State industry-seeking tour to California, led 
by Emerson. Douglas is headquartered in 
that State.

cluded G. R. Arterberry, Long Beach, Calif., 
manager of eastern manufacturing opera-
tions; and W. M. Humphreys, Sparta, pro-
duction coordinator for the four plants.

"Douglas, with your help and encourage-

the way to meet?and defeat?this problem. 
We believe it provides an example for the 
growth of American industry, a grow tit that 
can meet the needs of a dynamic industry 
and at the same time protect and enhance 
the cornerstone of our democracy, the Amer-
ican small town."

the opening of the plant a "great occasion, 
a great leap forward for our section."

able, growers were assured of adequate labor. 
But now there is no certainty that enough 
hands will be available to harvest the crop, 
particularly with the aversion of the domes-
tic workers to do what is known as "stoop 
labor." 
The Labor Secretary continually has 
harped on the theme that California had ade-
quate help last year despite the loss of 
the braceros. But an Associated Farmers of 
California bulletin points out that during 
the first 10 months of 1965 U.S. Government 
figures showed that 52,748 "wetbacks" were 
caught by the border patrol. Add approxi-
mately 35,000 "green card" Mexican workers 
plus the braceros Wirtz permitted to come 
in and it's obvious that it was not a new 
found domestic force of workers who har-
vested the California crops. 
The statements by Brown and Wirtz were 
made before all the facts and figures of 
the 1965 season were in. The crop and 
livestock reporting service's yearend report 
showed a reduction of 42,000 acres of land 
devoted to melons and vegetables. This re-
port also showed a drop of $55 million in 
the value of all crops. 
Taxpayers will be hard hit because addi-
tional funds will be needed to provide school-
ing for chilldren of migrants who will flood 
school districts already unable to keep pace 
with local growth needs. Migrants will be 
taking advantage of the educational facili-
ties offered in the districts without present-
ing anything in return. They will pay no 
property taxes, which means they will con-
tribute nothing from this district level to 
the schools. Almost amusing were the first 
hurt bleats that came out of Sacramento 
because agriculture was going to dump with-
out notice all those migrant children on the 
school districts. 
If those who complained didn't get the 
word they must be the only people in the 
world who didn't. For many years, agri-
cultural leaders had predicted this would 
happen if the braceros were removed. We 
know for a fact that Congress, the President, 
Governor Brown, and the Secretaries of 
Labor and Agriculture were warned time and 
time again by agriculture. 
Monterey County knows from experience, 
the welfare load already has been heavy and 
will get heavier. The type of domestic 
worker available will have to bring his family 
to the harvest area and is likely to remain 
after there is no work to do, thus becoming 
dependent on the welfare operations of the 
county. This is in contrast to the bracero 
who was imported at harvest time, worked, 
collected his pay and returned to his home-
land during the off season. 
Finally, there is the problem of a shift 
of production from California to Mexico be-
cause of high labor costs. Senator GEORGE 
MURPHY pointed out at a recent hearing 
that in 1964 a total of $4,765,000 worth of 
strawberries, cantaloupes, and oranges came 
Into the United States from Mexico. This 
compares with $232,000 worth in 1956. 
With all these facts available the Federal 
Government has taken no action to correct 
the situation created by Wirtz. 
And even Governor Brown has been re-
luctant. Finally, however, when policies 
(geared to the Delano march on Sacramento) 
dictated, he came out in support of mea-
sures proposed to provide financial aid to 
districts hit by the influx of migrant chil-
dren. However, the funds are not yet avail-
able and will come from a bond issue not 
yet approved by State voters. 
But what can growers expect from Wash-
ington and Sacremento administrations 
"zeroed in" on a course of punitive treatment 
of California agriculture, the State's greatest 
industry?

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. DURWARD G. HALL 
tilL7FORGET THE FERTILIZER 
The air assault on Vietnamese targets is 
averaging 50,000 tons a month, and U.S. 
bomb production will equal that figure by 
June. Of course, production is lagging be-
hind that figure now, but no need to worry; 
we have 331,000 tons throughout the world. 
The Secretary didn't say how many of those 
tons were available for Vietnam, except to 
note that 102,000 tons were now based in the 
United States. He was also compelled 
to admit that Washington has had to buy 
back 5,500 older 750-pound bombs sold as 
surplus to a West German fertilizer company 
for their nitrate content. 
No shortage? 
Mr. FORD replied that he was puzzled, 
especially in light of a previous admission 
that there were some shortages in 500- and 
750-pounders; the 750-pounders are con-
sidered the best size for Vietnam missions. 
Add to this the assertion of Cyrus Vance, 
deputy Defense Secretary, that the unloading 
of military supplies in Vietnam is now nor-
mal, and you have a mixed-up picture indeed. 
If there is an ammunition shortage, Mr. 
McNamara and the country would be better 
off if he would admit it, explain it, and, if 
possible, outline the steps he will take to 
alleviate the shortage. A little honesty may 
show, after all, that the situation is not "al 
most a national scandal," as Mr. FORD con-
tends. But Mr. McNamaxa's hair-trigger 
petulance and statistic-laden evasions make 
us wonder. 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 1966 
Mr. HALL, Mr. Speaker, herewith 
from the National Observer of April 18, 
1966, under editorial "Observations," an 
item of interest to all. For some time 
now the Committee on Armed Services 
has realized the shortcomings of the 
Secretary of Defense, if not his mal-
feasance in office. This editorial indi-
cates the national thinking concerning 
same, including deceit, evasion, if not 
outright distortion of the truth, in the 
interest of self-perpetuation. There is 
ample documentary evidence to support 
Prior allegations, in many different areas 
as well as these "observations." It's time 
he was "turned to pasture," and as he 
erred in following a subordinate's advice 
' who was directly connected with "flying 
Edsels," so he should return to making 
nonsalable?and now allegedly nonsafe---
Edsels of the roads. When our men are 
dying at the rate of over 3,000 since the 
escalation in January of 1965, with a 
total of 19,000 battle casualties, it is no 
time for petulance or evasion. The edi-
torial follows: 
OBSERVATIONS 
Indignation has become Secretary McNa-
mara's weapon against critics?indignation 
laced with bewildering statistics. In the 
bomb-shortage hassle last week, the weapon 
failed, leaving the country justifiably con-
fused. 
BELIEVING THE PENTAGON 
The episode was the latest in a series that 
has left almost every word from the Pen-
tagon suspect. Most recently there was that 
angry denial by Mr. McNamara that, contrary 
to some reports, U.S. military manpower was 
not being spread too thin by the Vietnam 
war. The Defense Secretary reached into his 
drawer of secrets and released an array of 
previously classified figures to "prove" it. 
That was before the Pentagon confessed that 
it was "temporarily" thinning out the ranks 
of U.S. forces in Europe and that the four 
stateside combat divisions weren't combat-
ready after all. 
Last week started with Pentagon officials 
toying with the fiction that the political 
turmoil in South Vietnam had not substan-
tially hampered the anti-Red war. Reports 
from Vietnam didn't square with this. 
So the Pentagon decided to come clean. 
Arthur Sylvester, an assistant Defense Secre-
tary conceded that there was a "temporary 
problem in distribution of bombs" within 
South Vietnam; Vietnamese workers were re-
fusing to unload American ships at the big 
U.S. base at Da Nang. 
This inspired GERALD FORD, House Re-
publican leader, to decry the bomb shortage 
as a piece of "shocking mismanagement" by 
Mr. McNamara. The Ford charge was the 
Secretary's clue to become indignant and 
reach for the drawer of secrets again. 
"It just isn't true" said Mr. McNamara. 
Then came the figures?bewildering at first, 
but not so dazzling. 
A Farmer's Daughter Looks to the Future 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. ODIN LANGEN 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 1966 
Mr. LANGEN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
just finished reading a letter from one of 
my constituents, a 15-year-old farm girl 
by the name of Diane Sellnow, of rural 
Verndale, Minn. Diane is typical of the 
thoughtful young people who are growing 
up on this Nation's farms, faced with the 
decision of whether to remain on the 
land or seek their future elsewhere. 
It would be well for all of us to look at 
the future of American agriculture 
through the eyes of this young lady. 
She puts the plight of the farmer in 
terse, down-to-earth language, and poses 
a number of questions that we in the 
Congress must answer in a satisfactory 
manner if the Diane Sellnows of this 
Nation are to be encouraged to make the 
effort to continue farming. And en-
couraged they must be if this Nation and 
the world are to be guaranteed a contin-
uing abundance of food. 
I submit Diane's letter at this point in 
the RECORD. 
Representative ODIN LANGEN, 
Longworth Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR M. LANGEN: Please, let me introduce 
myself. My name is Diane Sellnow. I am 15 
years old, have four brothers and two sisters,

We said many, many other small farmers in

In ,v oer hist newsletter you said this about 
America's youth: "These are the natural re-

these problems is hunger. Yes, the United

tea has is surplus of food now, but the way 
we're throwing it around. what about 50 
years irons now? 
My point, is this: Why Should T, my 
brothers, or any other young girls and boys 
want to spend their lives farming? What 
do we get besides a lot of hard work, little 
hoe time, hundreds or bills, and darn low 
prices for our products? Why not live in 
Iown and if nothing else have more free 
time? 
Tits people of America, certainly aren't do-
ing mach to encourage farming for the fu-
ture. We farmers get barely enough money 
or our goods to exist. But we don't want 
to lust exist, we want to live. There is a 
difference. The number of U.S. farmers is 
decreeeing steadily and unless our Govern-
ment takes drastic measures to help us, the 
number will continue to decrease. American 
politic-any, executives, laborers, doctors, and 
suburbanites need the farmer and it's about 
InD riley realize it. Nobody wants to live on 
Its.

Federal Aid to Impacted School Districts 
'ENS CON OF REMARKS 
ii 
ION. E. Y. BERRY 
OE SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN TIE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25, 1966 
Mr, BERRY. Mr. Speaker, the matter 
of Federal assistance to federally im-
pacted school districts is still pending 
before Congress. Fortunately, the funds 
for the current school year have been 
wisely reinstated to their previous level, 
hut there is still the threat that the funds 
under Public Laws 874 and 815 will not 
be sustained at the current level, in light 
of pending legislation which would alter 
the program.. 
In my congressional district, the 
Douglas Independent School District is 
one of the finest examples of educational 
quality and progress which has been 
achieved largely .through an excellent 
use of Federal aid to districts where most 
of the children's parent:. live and work 
on Federal property. Without the aid, 
the Douglas School District would col-
lapse financially. 
The superintendent cf the Douglas 
;:':11col system, lilr. Robert R. Spelts, has 
spent countless hours planning to the 
coming fiscal years as well as document-
ing the actual effect in dollars and cents 
that the proposed change would have On 
the Douglas school systeei.

proposed changes in the RECORD at this

Mayor Daley Proclaims Loyalty Day 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
HON. BARRATT O'HARA 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 25. 1966 
Mr. O'HARA of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
one of my favorite columnists is Joe 
Martin, who contributes a feature titled 
"Vets Press" to the 11 fine community 
newspapers of the Southwest Messenger 
Press chain in Chicago. Mr. Martin is 
the tried-and-true friend of the veterans 
of all the wars of our country and he is 
patriotic to the core. By unanimous con-
sent I am extending my remarks to in-
clude his column in the Mount Green-
wood, Ill., Express of April 21, 19(36, and 
other associated newspancrs: 
VETS PRESS 
(By Joe Martini 
Saturday April 30 has been proclaimed 
Loyalty Day by Chicago's mayor, Richard j. 
Daley. This will mark ths 16th annual 
Americanism display of the major war vet-
erans organizations. The theme of the pro-
gram will be "Operation Show Your Colors." 
A gigantic parade will course down State 
Street in Chicago's loop from Wacker Drive 
to Van Buren Street beginning at 12 o'clock, 
noon. 
This will be a significant day for all Amer-
icans in Chicagoland to rededicate their 
loyalty to the United States of Arne:rim. This 
day will also afford a special opportunity to 
show the Communists, leftwingers, beatniks, 
and anti-Vietniks that freedom-loving Amer-
icans are in the majority. 
On this day, our national emblem, the 
American flag should fly on :story available 
staff. Every man, woman, and child specta-
tor along the parade route should wave a flag, 
an American flag. Every store, building and 
home should display Old Glory. 
In this era when subvershess are actively 
engaged in down grading the United States 
using signs, banners, derogatory statements 
and anti-American demonstrations, loyal 
Americans should stand up 10 be counted. 
Loyalty Day is the opportune time to reaffirm 
our patriotism and restore our country's 
prestige. 
All organizations in Chicago and surround-
ing suburbs are invited to pariicipate in this 
Loyalty Day parade. Let's make this the 
largest and greatest demonstration ever wit-
nessed. 
In addition to veterans organizations, the 
military, high school ROTC, church frater-
nal, and captive nations groups, there will 
be a large contingent of sesvicemen who 
have recently returned from Vietnam, many 
of them wounded and showing battle scars 
resulting from their efforts in the light for 
freedom. 
Their morale has been depsessed due to 
news stories about draft card burning, dese-
cration of our flag and, other unpatriotic 
demonstrations. Citizens can rebuild their 
confidence with a big show of national colors 
and personal appearance by getting Into the 
mainstream of America and becoming a part 
of it,
