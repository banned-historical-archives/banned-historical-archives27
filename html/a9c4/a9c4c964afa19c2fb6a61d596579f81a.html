 ARAB-ISRAELI                 ISSUE
 USSR MIDEAST ROLE STRESSED AS GROMYKO SEES KISSINGER, SYRIANS
 Moscow has continued its efforts to increa3e its visibility in
 Mideast diplomacy by timing another Gromyko visit to Damascus to
 coincide with Secretary Kissinger's fifth visit to the area,*
 and by publicizing Gromyko's talks with Kissinger in Geneva on
 28-29 April and in Cyprus on 7 May.  Consistent with its treat-
 ment of Kissinger's last visit to the area in February-March,
 Moscow gave minimal coverage to the Secretary's peregrinations
 in Egypt, Israel, Syria and Jordan.  Some accounts--primarily in
 Arabic--contrived to cast doubt on the possibility of Kissinger
 achieving Israeli-Syrian disengagement.  They cited unidentified
 observers as saying that he probably would not be able to achieve
 disengagement during the pr.:,sent tour, and they noted, in connection
 with his talks in Israel, that Tel Aviv continued to refuse to
 withdraw from the Golan Heights, particularly from al-Qunaytirah.
 GROMYKO-KISSINGER TALKS     There has been little followup comment
 on the Middle East aspect of the
 Kissinger-Gromyko talks in Geneva, but PRAVDA's Kolesnichenko, in
 a review reported in an English-language broadcast on the 6th,
 called for "broad-based cooperation" between the Soviet Union and
 the United States as a precondition for solving the Middle East
 crisis.  Echoing the language of the joint report on the Geneva
 meeting, the review noted that Gromyko and Kissinger had agreed
 to maintain close contacts in coordinating their efforts to achieve
 a settlement.  The review observed that this approach to the
 problem "provides a real chance for peace."
 At the same time, a commentary in Arabic on the 5th underscored the
 "elementary differences" between the Soviet position of seeking
 a just overall settlement and the U.S. position of being the main
 power supporting Israel.  A foreign-language commentary by Rassadin
 on the 5th reiterated previous Soviet assertions that "U.S. imperialist
 circles" and "those circles" in the Arab world trying to disrupt
 Soviet-Arab friendship were playing into the hands of the "Israeli
 aggressors."
 *  During his last visit to the Middle Last, which overlapped Secretary
 Kissinger's fourth tour of the area, Gromyko visited Cairo (1-5 March)
 as well as Damascus (27 February-1 March, 5-7 March).

 Moscow thus far has offered no comment on the Kissinger-Gromyko
 meeting in Nicosia on 7 May other than to publicize the brief
 report on the. meeting, which. said that along with questions per-
 taining to Soviet-U.S. relations, the two sides discussed the
 Middle East situation, including the matter of Syrian-Israeli
 disengagement "as part of the general problem" of a Middle East
 settlement.
 GROMYKO IN SYRIA     Moscow was predictably uninformative in its
 treatment of Gromyko's 5-7 May official visit
 to Syria.  Other than Gromyko's brief, stereotyped arrival, and
 departure remarks--in which he noted that disengagement had been
 discussed and expressed satisfaction with the visit--no speeches
 were. reported.  TASS did say that "brief welcoming speeches"
 were exchanged at. Foreign Minister Khaddam's luncheon on the 6th,
 but gave no indication of any speeches at President a1-Asad's
 dinaei: the previous day.
 The short ;oncludi.ng document an the visit--described by TASS as
 a "report" and by Damascus as a "press statement"--declared that
 peace. in the area must be based on Israeli withdrawal from the
 lands occupied since the. June 1967 war and on a guarantee of the
 Palestinians' lawful national rights.  The same points were made
 in the joint. statement following President al-Asad's Moscow visit
 last month.  Like the earlier statement, the present one again
 affirmed that disengagement must be considered a step tcward a
 comprehensive solution and total Israeli withdrawal.  The report
 on the visit said that Gromyko affirmed the USSR's "resolute?"
 support for Syria's position on disengagement--support earlier
 declared by Brezhnev in his 11 April speech at a dinner for
 al-Asad.
 Gromyko's talks, according to the report on the visit, were held
 in an atmosphere of "friendship and mutual understanding," the
 same characterization used in describing the al-Asad talks in
 Moscow last month.   In addition to his two meetings with al-Asad,
 and talks with the Syrian prime minister and foreign minister,
 Gromyk.o again met with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman
 'Arafat, as he had in both Cairo and Damascus during his last
 visit to the area.  According to TASS on the 6th, Gromyko and
 'Arafat discussed, in a "warm friendly atmosphere," questions of
 a Mideast settlement and of securing the Palestinians' national
 rights.  There was no report that Gromyko met with officials of
 the Syrian Communist Party, as he had done on his previous visit.

 MOSCOW TERSE ON 13.RANDT RESIGNATION; GDR SCOFFS AT SPY CASE
 Reflecting obvious surprise and concern over the sudden resignation
 of FUG Chancellor Brandt on 6 May, Moscow has avoided extensive
 comment on the reasons for the move or its implications, confining
 its coverage mainly to selective replays of Western news reports
 and comment.  Although Moscow reported briefly on the Guillaume
 spy case prior to the resignation, it has not mentioned it since.
 By its silence on this issue and by its selective reporting, Moscow
 has suggested that the true causes for the resignation are internal
 FRG political and economic difficulties.  Stressing this latter
 theme, East Berlin has been quick to assert that the Guillaume case
 was just a pretext for Brandt's resignation.. Other East European
 comment has also played the domestic difficulties theme, along
 with the suggestion that Brandt's domestic political opponents and
 the FRG intelligence services had conspired to force Brandt out of
 office.
 MOSCOW      Moscow's limited reportage thus far has been restricted
 to a few terse, factual TASS reports, the substance of
 which has been publicized by Moscow radio and in the central press.
 The initial TASS report, early on the 7th, noted that Brandt had
 resigned and had asked President Heinemann to appoint Vice Chancellor
 Scheel as acting chancellor.  In the evening hours of the 7th TASS
 carried a brief summary of that day's events which suggested that the
 main lines of Brandt's policies would probably be continued by his
 successors.  TASS noted that Helmut Schmidt's nomination for
 chancellor had been proposed by Brandt.  It cited SPD deputy chair-
 man Heinz Kuehn as saying that the SPD-FDP coalition would continue.
 TASS on the 8th, in a dispatch from Bonn, observed that West German
 commentators had noted that the "basic causes" for Brandt's decision
 were "rooted in difficulties of a domestic political nature" and it
 cited Bonn spokesman von Wechmar as saying that Brandt's resignation
 would not affect FRG foreign policy.
 Although, Moscow has not mentioned the Guillaume spy case since
 Brandt's resignation, an article in IZVESTIYA on the 5th, commenting
 on the controversy in West Germany over the exchange of permanent
 missions between the FRG and the GDR, asserted that the "latest
 pretext for anticommunist hysteria was the recent arrest of an aide
 in the chancellor's office on suspicion of espionage."  The article
 declared that the CDU/CSU leaders were using this spy case "as a
 convenient opportunity for fresh attacks on the GDR."

 8 MAY 1974
 THE GDR     East German comment has charged that Brandt over-
 reacted to the Guillaume case and that the "re:il
 reasons" for his resignation were the internal economic and
 political difficulties of the Federal Republic.  East Berlin
 did not comment directly on the arrest of Guillaume untii
 2 ,day, when NEUES DEUTSCHLAND carried a lengthy editorial which
 charged that the arrest "of a member" of the chancellor's staff
 was the signal for a "witch hunt" by the Bonn opposition, whose
 victims would include the "present government itself."  While
 the editorial did not acknowledge directly that Guillaume was a
 GDR spy, avoiding mention of his name entirely, it repeatedly
 declared that FRG-GDR relations should not, be dependent on such
 "more or less marginal, events" as the activities of the two
 countries' respective intelligence services. It went on to cite
 the West German SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG for the view that the arrest
 of the chancellor's assistant "does not alter the basic premises
 of the relations between the two German states."  The editorial
 concluded by calling for additional steps to be taken toward
 normalizing relations between the GDR and :'^G.
 A GDR Foreign Ministry spokesman on, the 7th, according to ADN and
 TASS, said "the events" in Bonn were an "internal FRG affair."
 Acknowledging that GDR leaders have "repeatedly expressed their
 appreciation for the realistic" aspects of Brandt's foreign policy,
 the spokesman added that the new FRG Government will be expected
 to "make a constructive contribution to implementing the system of
 treaties concluded and to thereby promote peace and security in
 Europe."  GDR President Stoph, in the main speech on the 7th at a
 ceremony honoring the 29th anniversary of the victory over. Hitler,
 made no mention of either the Guillaume case or Brandt's resignation,
 according to ADN's report of his speech.
 GDR comment following Brandt's resignation replayed the themes of
 the NEUES DEUTSCHLAND editorial.  An ADN dispatch from Bonn on the
 7th bluntly stated that there was "no compelling reason" for
 Brandt's resignation, adding that it was "superfluous and resulted
 from a misjudgment of the situation."  Asserting that these
 judgments were shared by Western observers, the ADN correspondent
 declared that the Guillaume "affair" was nothing more than
 "a mere excuse" for Brandt's resignation.
 OTHER EAST EUPOPEAN     Displaying skepticism that the Guillaume
 REACTION                case was the real reason for Brandt's
 resignation, Prague and Budapest have
 commented at length on the domestic economic and political reasons
 for Brandt's decision.  For example, Prague took a slap at East

 Berlin when a Czechoslovak radio official, appearing on
 Prague television on the 7th, labeled the Guillaume case "a
 kind of distasteful espionage affair."
 Zagreb radio commentator Milik.a,Sundic drew the conclusion that
 the harm done to Europe by the spy case would outweigh the use-
 fulness of the information supplied by Guillaume to his
 "protectors", in the CDR and "the socialist camp as a whole."
 Warsaw's German specialist'Ryszard Wojna, in a television
 commentary on the 7th and an-article in the party daily TRYBUNA
 LUDU on the 8th, heaped glowing praise on Brandt for his efforts
 in bringing about the Warsaw-Bonn treaty and noted favorably
 that, with the confirmation that the Bonn coalition government
 would continue, the "possibility" for normalizing relations
 between Poland and the FRG has not changed.  Sofia, Bucharest,
 and Tirana have reported Brandt's resignation without comment.
 MOSCOW SEES BOTH FRENCH CANDIDATES COMMITTED TO DETENTE
 In initial comment on the results of the 5 May first-stage
 balloting in the French presidential elections, Moscow has
 suggested that it finds little difference between the foreign
 policy orientations of the two run-off candidates.  Noting that
 both Mitterrand and Giscard d'Estaing have indicated in recent
 speeches that they would conduct a foreign policy aimed at
 continuing international detente and the development of relations
 with the socialist countries, Moscow has thus continued to show
 the reserved and noncommital attitude it displayed d-,ring the
 period of preliminary electioneering.*
 Despite its presumed stake in the success of a communist-backed
 candidate, Moscow has so far avoided any outright show of
 partisanship on Mitterrand's behalf.  A commentary by political
 observer A. Potapov, for instance, carried over Moscow domestic
 service on 6 May, served merely to throw into sharp relief Moscow's
 lack of enthusiastic endorsement of Mitterrand.  Potapov had no
 particular words of praise for Mitterrand, noting merely that
 his electoral support had been one million votes more than the
 leftist parties had received in the 1973  parliamentary elections.
 Moreover, Potapov seemed to assume the attitude of a mere
 intere ted bystander in observing, on the basis of French press
 reports, that the next.otage would be "a fierce duel" in which
 "anything could still happen."

 Whereas Moscow evidently believes its interests are best served
 by continuing a low-keyed, hands-off  approach to the elections,
 East European comment has been markedly more partisan in supporting
 Mitterrand and in drawing far-reaching inferences from his successes
 to date.  The review of the Warsaw press, carried by PAP on 7 May,
 saw "signs that an important turning point in France's political
 life may be in the offing" and referred to the possibility of a
 "broad democratic majority" to include socialists and communists.
 The East German NATIONAL-ZEITUNG on 7 May interpreted the
 first-round balloting as a reflection of the "regrouping of forces"
 allegedly occurring in recent years in France and reflected in the
 joint political program of the leftist parties.

 MOSCOW STEPS UP PRESSURE OVER HELICOPTER INCIDENT
 The 14 March Chinese capture and detention of a Soviet helicopter
 and crew has received increased attention in Soviet media during
 the last 10 days, with a new protest from the foreign ministry as
 well as comment carried in the central press and by TASS.
 Initially, Moscow played the incident in low key and did not
 acknowledge that there had been a Soviet foreign ministry protest
 on 15 March until the 28th; when a second protest referred to
 the earlier one in passing.  The protest of the 28th--delivered
 to the Chinese both in Moscow and Peking--" insisted" on the return
 of the crew and categorically rejected Peking's charges of
 23 March that the helicopter was on a reconnaissance mission.
 According to TASS, on 2 May Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Leonid
 Ilichev read a statement to the Chinese ambassador which repeated
 the above assertions in the 28 March statement but went on to warn
 that Peking must "assume full responsibility for the inevitable
 consequences" of further detention of the crew.  The warning of
 "consequences" was also voiced in the 21 January 1974 protest
 over Peking's arrest and expulsion of five Soviet diplomats*--the
 first formal protest since a ship collision in 1971.  Such
 warnings were routine fare in protest notes during the late 1960's.
 Four days before the latest note, a lengthy report in the 28 April
 PRAVDA eschewed tendentious commentary while pr(asentirg Moscow's
 version of events.  Following its 2 May note, however, Moscow's
 public reticence showed signs of ending.  On 7 May TASS carried a
 commentary by its observer Yuriy Kornilov, and on the 8th it
 carried a lengthy summary of a LITERARY GAZETTE article berating
 the Chinese over the incident.  Kornilov briefly echoed official
 Soviet statements, adding that Peking's actions are "a crying
 violation of generally accepted norms of international law"
 designed to give "new impetus" to its anti-Soviet campaign.
 Moscow radio began rebroadcasting the Kornilov commentary in Mandarin
 and other languages on 7 May.
 PEKING     Peking ignored the latest Soviet protest, as it had the
 28 March Soviet foreign ministry note.  The Chinese
 responded in low key in the weeks following their 23 March protest

 over the incident, virtually avoiding central media coverage of
 the issue.  This contrasted with the full play Peking had given
 in January to the capture and expulsion of Soviet diplomats on
 spying charges.  The helicopter incident became the focus of
 several Sinkiang local rallies in late March and early April
 which were reported only in provincial broadcasts and which
 seemed designed as much to stir up fervor for the current
 Chinese domestic campaign against Lin Piao as to denounce Moscow's
 spying.  Peking media's sole reference to the incident since the

 C H I N A
 CHOU SAYS THIRD WORLD STRUGGLE HAS REACHED "NEW STAGE"
 Premier Chou En-lai, speaking at a 6 May banquet for visiting
 I
 I
 Senegalese President Senghor, dramatized earlier Chinese
 characterizations of the UNGA special session on raw materials
 when he said that it has shown that the third world struggle
 against the superpowers has reached a "new stage--a stage of
 deep-going development."  Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping in his
 major UN address on 10 April* had hailed the session as showing
 that the developing world is the "main force" opposing the
 superpowers, and PEOPLE'S DAILY editorials marking the conclave
 had observed that the session demonstrated a "new situation."
 Chou's remarks further enhance his public image as Peking's
 leading spokesman directing the recent shift in Chinese foreign
 policy toward a more pronounced identification with third world
 interests against the United States and Soviet Union.  Especially
 since Chinese leadership consultations with visiting Algerian
 President Boumediene in late February, following his call for
 the UNGA special session, Peking leaders headed by Chou have
 been at pains to convince visiting third world leadera of Chinese
 support for their cause.  Chou was the first Chinese leader to
 allude, in a 24 March banquet address for the visiting Tanzanian
 President, to a new Mao instruction testifying to Peking's
 determination not to betray Marxism by failing to assist oppressed
 peoples abroad.
 Chou's remarks also provided evidence that even though Peking
 is presently preoccupied with stressing its anti-Superpower
 credentials, it will not reverse its flexible, differentiated
 approach toward the United States and the USSR.  The premier
 notably softpedaled criticism of the United States while
 lashing out at Soviet behavior at the UN session, behavior
 he described as "especially despicable."  This kind of distinction
 was also drawn in other authoritative Chinese comment on the
 session.  NCNA reportage on Secretary Kissinger's address at
 the meeting was atypically critical, but this criticism was not
 repeated in authoritative media.

 the UN session, see the TRENDS of 17 April 1974, pages 1-4.

 Though Chou was glowingly positive regarding the course of third
 world struggle during the UN session, other authoritative comment
 has been careful to insert a note of caution regarding future
 prospects.  A 5 May PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial marking the end
 of the session noted that developing nations' struggle against
 superpower exploitation will be "protracted and arduous."  PRC
 UN representative Huang Hua also warned in a 1 May address that
 "a long process of arduous struggle" by the developing nations
 would be necessary in order to reverse the existing world
 economic framework.
 4 MAY RALLIES STRESS PARTY LEADERSHIP OF YOUTHFUL ACTIVISM
 Peking used the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the 4 May
 Movement, a massive protest movement by Chinese youth in 1919
 against imperialism and China's traditional culture, to issue
 a. new call for youth to play a larger role as assistants to
 the party in the struggle against Lin Piao and Confucius.  The
 call for youths to widen their role in the anti.-Con:f'uct.us
 campaign was contained in an authoritative PEOPLE'S DA'ILY
 editorial pegged to the anniversary which argued that criticism
 of Lin and Confucius cannot be done by "relying on a few people."
 It specifically called upon educated youth and students throughout
 the country to join with the workers and peasants and "form a
 mighty army" under the party's leadership to criticize Lin.
 Recalling a passage from a speech by Mao, the editorial. asserted
 that it is only with a "force of hundreds of millions of people"
 that the enemy's "last fortress" can be smashed.
 Reports on provincial rallies marking the anniversary serve to
 underscore Peking's resolve, however, to prevent any return to
 the chaotic conditions and the freewheeling attacks of youthful
 Red Guards during the late 1960's.  The rally reports make it
 clear that, unlike the stormy cultural revolution period,
 Chinese youths now are not empowered to roam from province to
 province drt.gging out errant party officials.  Instead, they
 have clear instructions to follow their local unified party
 leadership and avoid getting entagled in factional disputes.
 The proper pattern youths should follow to deepen their role in
 the anti-Lin struggle was outlined in greatest detail in a 4 May
 Shanghai report on a local youth meeting marking the anniversary
 :..t the stadium of Shanghai's No. 17 cotton mill, Wang Hung-wen's
 old base.  The report focused on the need for young activists
 to be "good assistants of the party" and warned that without
 party leadership the youth movement would "lose its bearings,
 suffer setbacks and incur losses."

 L,tmiting the scope of the popular revolutionary slogan calling
 on ;youths to challenge policies deemed incorrect by "going
 against the tide," the Shanghai report stressed that youths must
 unite with the majority and go "against the tide under the
 leade%Ghip of the party committee."  However, some leeway for
 youth to influence party decisions was reflected in the report,
 which drew a line between legitimate and illegitimate authority
 within the party.  Youths were given the mission to obey the
 leadership that implements the "correct line," and to oppose
 the leadership that implements an "incorrect line."  Youth
 groups throughout Shanghai were also advised to assist the party
 by offering,; suggestions to party organizations, and not to wait
 "passively for orders and instructions."
 In an apparent effort to avoid possible overzealous interpretations
 of the role of youth in the anti-Confucius campaign, reports on
 other provincial rallies have revealed further limitations on
 activism,  Chengchow's 4 May report on its local. rally specifically
 noted that youths must remain at their production posts, make
 revolution "locally," and only during their "spare time."  Similarly,
 Nanning radio on 4 May stressed the role of party leadership over
 the youth movement and also noted that revolution should be made
 during "spare time" and "on the spot" to help meet the goals of
 the 1974 national economic plan.
 PRC MEDIA RENEW AT1ENTION TO WORKER PROPAGANDA TEAMS
 Paralleling the 4 May youth day calls stressing party leadership
 and discipline, there has been a recent revival of media attention
 to worker propaganda teams.  The worker teams were sent to schools
 in 1968 to end Red Guard anarchy and carry out educational reforms.
 Following the cultural revolution, however, the teams apparently
 were gradually reduced to figureheads in many schools.
 The revival of worker teams is in keeping with the current stress
 on worker participation in the anti-Lin campaign and with indications
 that trade unions are assuming a major role in the struggle.  At
 the same time it assures that workers under tight party control--
 rather than revolutionary youth--form the backbone of the struggle,
 a move wh!.^h seems calculated to prevent the campaign against Lin
 ciao and Confucius from slipping into the anarchy that arose during
 the cultural revolution.
 A 26 April Honan broadcast revealed that in the spring of 1972,
 when the struggle against Lin was taking the form of a broad attack
 on ultraleftism, worker propaganda teams were relegated to routine

 administrative tasks by those seeking to improve teaching quality,
 and an unsuccessful attempt was even made to expel the teams from
 schools on the grounds that they were "factionalists."  A Hunan
 broadcast on the same day reported a decision to send propaganda
 teams to various units throughout the province, not just educational
 institutions.  The decision, by the provincial revolutionary
 committee's leadership group for worker Mao Tse-tung thought
 propaganda teams, called on teams to enter all culture, education
 and public health units.  The call was echoed by Liaoning province
 the following day, suggesting that a central directive had been
 issued on the topic.
 On 29 April PRC central media picked up the theme, with an NCNA
 domestic service account revealing that additional worker propa-
 ganda team units had been sent to all local institutes of higher
 education and that they had positioned themselves in the leading
 body of each department in every institution.  The teams do not
 replace party lecdersliip, but do have a say in party decisions.
 The NCNA report provided an example in which the party committee
 of a Peking institute attached "great importance" to team opinions
 and consequently adopted new measures.  Similarly, a 7 May NCNA
 account of educational revolution victories in Shenyang revealed
 that the secretaries of two local school party branches also
 head the school's propaganda teams.
 PEKING ARTICLE PRAISES, BUT LIMITS, REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE
 A "recent" PEKING DAILY article--written by the criticism group
 of Peking and Tsinghua universities and excerpted by NCNA on
 7 May--dwelt upon the achievements and problems of the cultural
 revolution period to make clear that the current ideological
 campaign must be carried out under controlled conditions.  The
 article was eff:aive in its praise for cultural revolution
 achievements, the "new things" which must be defended from
 attack, but it clearly differentiated the :Maoist cultural
 revolutionary mainstream from attempts by Lin Piao to "shift
 the direction of the struggle" and "hit the whole party, army
 and proletariat."
 Tice target of the article's attacks is Lin's attempt to struggle
 against institutions,, rather than the relatively few erring
 individuals.  The article specifically criticized Lin for
 fomenting attacks on "the party in power," on "those who made
 revolution," and for trying to "drag out the handful in the army."

 It also accused him of disrupting Mao's principle of promoting
 both revolution and production by splitting the revolutionary
 ranks and lrciting "armed conflicts."  This recital of Lin's
 errors seams desig:ied to warn people that such crimes will not
 be tolerated in the current struggle.
 The PEKING DATT,Y article characterizes those who called Lin's
 crimes "ultraleftist" as "a handful of class enemies, Lin Piao's
 sworn followers included."  In so doing, the article ignores the
 historical record which shows that some of China's current
 leaders, most notably Chiang Ching, were less careful about
 employing ouch designatiinc in the past.  In Chiang Ching's most.
 famous speech, her 5 September 1967 address advising Red Guards
 that they must not resort to violent struggle, she noted that
 opposition tn the Maoist line was then coming from "the left,
 extreme left and right."  Among the types of opposition she then
 enumerated were the calls---now attributed to Lin--to drag out
 the handful in the army and in the party.
 Unlike many of the charges against Lin, the accusation th.t he
 was behind the call to drag out the handful in the army may have
 some validity.  The slogan was, sounded ,.everal times during the
 first half of 1967 in LIBERATION ARMY DAILY editorials, before
 it was given wider currency in RED FLAG articles for a brief
 period following the Wuhan military mutiny in late July ..967.
 According to Red Guard sources, ..in positively assessed the
 results of the mutiny, in a speech he delivered on 9 August 1967.
 He was quoted as saying that the mutiny had "turned into a very
 good thing", and implied that this incident would provide an
 opportunity to move into several military regions about which
 "we have been somewhat uneasy."  He reportedly further noted
 that military units must be taught to treat revolutionaries
 properly and listen to their opinions.

 VIETNAM
 GIAP ADDRESSES DIEN BIEN PHU RALLY, RESUMES ACTIVE PUBLIC ROLE
 Following his reappearance at a 30 April May Day meeting after an
 unexplained absence of nearly seven months, Defense Minister Vo
 Nguyen Giap seems to have resumed his customary active role as
 foremost representative of the DRV military.*  Hanoi reported that
 Giap on 5 May voted in people's council elections, on the 6th
 delivered a public address on the 20th anniversary of Dien Bien
 Phu, and on the 7th reviewed the 1954 battle in a Hanoi television
 talk.
 The Defense Minister's 6 May speech was delivered at a "grand
 meeting" to mark the Dien Bien Phu anniversary, attended by
 Politburo members Truong Chinh, Nguyen Duy Trinh, and Van Tien
 Dung, as well as members of DRV mass organizations, the army, and
 the diplomatic corps.  A similar meeting on the 10th anniversary
 in 1964, also addressed by Giap, prompted a higher-level leadership
 turnout that included Ho Chi Minh, First Secretary Le Duan, and
 Premier Pham Van Dong.  Only twice since 1964 has the anniversary
 been marked with meetings--in 1965 and 1969--and these were not
 addressed by Giap.
 Following perfunctory opening remarks by Foreign Minister Nguyen
 Duy Trinh, Giap expounded on the historic impact of Dien Bien Phu.
 He characterized it as the "do-or-die strategic battle" of
 ?tdecisive significance for the overall military and political
 situation in the Indochina war theater and for the successful
 outcome of the Geneva conference," and as "an epochal turning
 point in the Vietnamese revolution."  The 1972 general offensive,
 by "giving full play to the Dien Bien Phu tradition," according
 to Giap, was "decisive for the great victory of the anti-U.S. war"
 and "forced" the United States to sign the Paris agreement and
 pull its troops out of Vietnam.
 In his brief remarks on the economic situation in the North, Giap
 not unexpectedly emphasized the military aspects of reconstruction.
 He urged a consolidation of national defense potential and a
 combining of economic tasks with related national defense tasks to

 transform the "socialist North into a powerful country both in
 the economic and national defense fields."  In turn, Giap pledged
 that the armed forces will "actively take part in economic
 construction and the building of socialism."
 DRY PEOPLE'S COUNCIL ELECTIONS DRAW LARGE LEADERSHIP TURNOUT
 Hanoi media have prominently featured the appearances of leading
 officials voting in the countrywide elections held on 5 May for
 provincial, municipal, and regional people's councils--the local
 governing bodies directly below the national 'level.*  Of the
 currently active members of the Politburo, only First Secretary
 Le Duan and Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi were unaccounted for in
 reports on the voting.  According to Hanoi radio, President Ton
 Duc Thang, Truong Chinh, Pham Van Dong, Le Duc Tho, Nguyen Duy
 Trinh, Hoang Van Hoan, and the seldom-mentioned Tran Quoc Roan
 all cast their ballots at local polling stations in Hanoi.  The
 two military members of the Politburo, senior generals Vo Nguyen
 Giap and Van Tien Dung, were said to have voted at the "office
 of the Ministry of National Defense."  Neither Giap nor Dung has
 been mentic:rned in similar reports of voting in recent years.
 The recently deposed chairman of the Central Agricultural Commission,
 Hoang Anh, was also reported as having voted and was identified with
 his remaining titles of secretary of the party Central Committee and
 vice premier.**  Tran Huu Duc, one- of three new vice premiers
 announced in a 2 April National Assembly Standing Committee communique
 that also indicated he would be in charge of the "internal affairs
 bloc,'' was reported to hava led a government delegation to inspect
 votin;3 activities "at several polling stations inside and outside
 Hanoi. "***
 *    While DRV National Assembly elections were suspended during the
 war years, until 1971, Hanoi has held elections for people's councils
 on a regular shedule.  According co the )RV constitution, people's
 councils for autonomous zones, provinces, and cities under central
 jurisdiction are elected every three years, and councils at the village
 and district level are elected every two years.

 Le Duan was in Moscow at the time.  In 1968, President Ho Chi

 were cited as having voted; and in 1965, the same four readers
 plus Pham Van Dong were listed.

 NOTE
 PEKING ON CAMBODIAN ANNIVERSAP_i:  Peking's recent downplaying of
 its relations with Cambodian Prince Sihanouk's front and government
 has continued with the failure, for the first time, to mark the
 fourth anniversary of the 5 May formation of the government with
 the release of a congratulatory message.  Peking's only reference
 to the 5 May RGNU anniversary was in an NCNA report of a 5 May
 AKI article.  In 1971 and 1972 messages from Chou En-lai were
 publicized, and last year the media carried a message from PRC
 Acting Chairman Tung Pi-wu and Chou Eu-lai to Sihanouk and his
 prime minister, Penn Nouth--which strove to enhance the vole of
 Sihanouk in the wake of his March 1973 visit to Cambodia.  Peking's
 total silence on any official greeting on the RGNU anniversary
 comes on the heels of limited publicity for congratulatory messages
 on the fourth anniversaries of the Cambodian Front (in March) and
 of the Indochinese summit (in April).  The messages on those
 occasions were not carried in PEOPLE'S DAILY or by NCNA, and
 Peking radio ,tarried them only in broadcasts to Southeast Asia.
