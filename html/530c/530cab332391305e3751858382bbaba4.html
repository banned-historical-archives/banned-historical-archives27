1. HOSTILITIES IN EGYPT 
Israel appears to have won a decisive 
battle for control of the Sinai Penin-
sula after three days of heavy fighting. 
Israeli armored columns, with effec-
tive air support, have advanced into 
western Sinai, bypassing points of 
Egyptian resistance. British and 
French air attacks on Egyptian air-
fields contributed significantly to the 
process of neutralizing the Egyptian 
air force. The Gaza strip has been 
cut off at its base near Rafah, and in 
the vicinity of El Arish. Other Egyp-
tian forces have been cut off or en-
circled. The Israelis claim that an 
Israeli armored force on 1 November 
routed Egyptian armored reinforcements 
south of Bir Gifgafa, 45 miles from the 
canal, capturing T-34 tanks, armored 
cars and other weapons. Israeli mobile 
units may therefore have cut the main 
 road between eastern Sinai and the Suez 
Canal crossing-at Firdan Bridge, west of Bir Gifgafa, seal-
ing the only good escape route from Sinai. 
Although the Egyptians did reinforce 
their forces in Sinai, it is apparent that their main force, 
including most of their armor, has not yet been committed 
and is being held for defense of the delta and the canal zone 
against the Anglo-French landing, whichhas not yet occurred. 
The Egyptian commander in chief's de-
cision on 30 October to attempt to broaden the scope of Arab-
Israeli hostilities was abruptly reversed

Egypt has apparently launched its cam-
paign against Western oil installations. An oil pipeline in 
the British-protected sheikdom of Qatar, and an off-shore 
delivery line furnishing oil to the British military in Tripoli, 
Libya, have been reported sabotaged. A general strike of 
oil wor 
17 in the sheikdom of Bahrein has also been re-
norted. 
British and French naval and amphibious 
forces are moving toward assault positions in Egyptian waters. 
A Paris spokesman announced on 1 November that Anglo-French 
naval forces were approaching Port Said from the north and the 
city of Suez from the south. 
A communiqu�rom the Anglo-French 
headquarters on Cyprus state,s that British and French air 
operations over Egypt are being shifted from bombing mili-
tary airfields to attacks on individual aircraft and airfield in-
stallations. The communiqu�laims that since 31 October 
British and French raids have destroyed 90 Egyptian aircraft. 
French foreign minister Pineau told the 
American embassy in Paris on 1 November that the Anglo-
French move against Egypt has "long" been planned with Israel.

In reply to a question as to whether Egypt 
would turn to the USSR if this request were refused, Nasr 
appeared taken aback, but regained his composure and said 
there had been no discussion of turning to the Soviet Union. 
He asserted that Khrushchev in the past had suggested fur-
nishing volunteers but Egypt had never replied. 
Nasr concluded by saying he would not 
surrender but neither would he run away.

3. THE HUNGARIAN SITUATION (information as of 2400,1 November) 
Comment on: 
Although Soviet troops have withdrawn from 
Budapest, they remain in bivouac areas 
near the Hungarian capital. Soviet tanks 
reportedly have surrounded the Budapest 
airfield, apparently for the purpose of main-
taining control of the field while wounded 
Soviet troops are evacuated. No military 
action has taken place in Budapest between 
Soviet and Hungarian army units, 
At 1800 (local time) on 1 November, Buda-
pest radio announced that Premier Nagy 
had officially protested to Soviet ambassa-
dor Andropov that he had received "author-
itative information about the entry into 
Hungarian territory of new Soviet military 
formations," and had demanded that these forces be withdrawn 
at once. Budapest radio stated at 2300 that all airfields of the 
�Hungarian air force had been surrounded by Soviet armored 
units in order to permit the departure of Soviet wounded. There 
is no firm evidence to confirm these assertions by Nagy, which 
may have been made in an effort to hasten the Soviet departure 
and to shore up his present government. There are indications 
of a small-scale Soviet troop redeployment within Hungary and 
 Soviet supply trans-
ports have been flying into Hungary daily. 
Nagy, acting in a dual role as premier and 
foreign minister, also reportedly informed Andropov that the 
Hungarian government was withdrawing immediately from the 
Warsaw pact. At the same time he declared Hungary's neu-
trality, which, he added, should be guaranteed by the UN and 
the four major powers. Andropov, in response to the accusa-
tion that new troops were coming into Hungary, reportedly 
said that it was merely a regrouping of troops and not a new 
attempt on the part of the Soviet Union to smash the Hungarian 
revolution. During the afternoon of 1 November, Nagy said

in an appeal to the United Nations that "new Soviet troop units 
are entering Hungary:' Secretary General Hammarskjold has 
reportedly added this question to the provisional agenda of the 
11th General Assembly which opens on 12 November. 
Politically, the day was consumed in fever-
ish activity by diverse groups presenting their demands and 
attempting to build up their popular following, but no real po-
litical unity was achieved. 
First Secretary Janos ICadar of the Hun-
garian Workers (Communist) Party announced at 2200 on 
1 November that a new party would be formed which would 
make a complete break with the Stalinist past and serve as 
a rallying point for all workers. The establishment of the 
new party--known as the Socialist Workers Party--is an ob-
vious effort to increase national support for the Communists, 
particularly from left-wing Social Democratic Party members. 
Efforts to enlist Social Democrats in the 
new coalition continue to be fruitless. Ana Kethely, provi-
sional president of the newly re-formed Social Democratic 
Party, who arrived in Vienna for the Socialist International, 
stated that until free elections had taken place there 
cou1d Ino thought of "real" Social Democrats becoming mem-
bers of the government. 
Cardinal Mindszenty in his first public state-
ment since his release said that "all conditions for the continu-
ation of life are lacking' He withheld his support for any po-
litical group and indicated that in two days he would clarify his 
position.

4, EAST GERMAN REGIME DETERMINED TO MAKE 
NO CONCESSIONS NOW 
High East German officials say that 
despite widespread internal demands 
for changes, East German party first 
secretary Walter Ulbricht will not be 
removed from his post nor will any concessions be  made 
until the unrest in the other Satellites calms down,  
  Ulbricht's removal or any other reform now would 
be interpreted by the restive East German populace as an 
indication of weakness, and could lead to revolution. When 
it comes, Ulbricht's ouster will be explained on grounds 
of health and will not be accompanied by significant changes 
in government or party policies. 
East German Communists have been assured of continued 
Soviet support and need not fear they will be sacrificed in 
a reunification deal. 
According to the alert plan now in effect 
� 
in East Germany, the Kampfgruppen�recently reported 
purged of unreliable elements--are to go into action first, 
with the police, the secret police, the army, and Soviet 
troops to be called on successively if a situation threatens 
to get out of hand. 
Students at East German universities 
are protesting the regime's failure to give factual news coy.-
erage to the upheavals in Poland and Hungary. Party func-
tionaries blame student restlessness on the Western press 
and radio, and maintain that the developments were adequately 
explained by Ulbricht and Premier Grotewohl in their 27 Octo-
ber radio and television broadcast. 
East German leaders apparently accept the 
Soviet policy to allow liberalization in the Satellites except 
East Germany. Pressures for change, however, may develop 
to such an extent that they will be forced to adopt a more lib-
eral internal program, particularly in the event that the USSR 
withdraws  its troops from other Satellites.

5. PEIPING'S STATEMENT ON SOVIET-
SATELLITE RELATIONS 
The Peiping regime has endorsed the 
Soviet declaration of 30 October on re-
lations with the Satellites, and at the 
same time has rebuked the USSR for 
its earlier mishandling of Poland and 
Hungary. This first Chinese Communist statement on the 
question supports the view that Peiping wishes to see a 
relationship between the Soviet Union and Eastern Euro-
pean states of approximately the kind Peiping itself enjoys. 
' In terms similar to those of the Soviet 
declaration, the Chinese statement describes as "com-
pletely proper" recent Polish and Hungarian demands for 
"democracy, independence, and equality' as well as for 
economic improvements.� The Chinese went beyond the 
Soviet statement in a sharp criticism of "great-nation 
chauvinism" as the cause of "serious damage" to inter-
national Communist solidarity. At the same time, they 
cautioned the European Satellites against "reactionary 
elements who attempt to undermine the people's democratic 
system and unity among socialist countries."

6- FIRST NATO REACTION TO ANGLO-FRENCH 
INTERVENTION IN EGYPT 
trong opposition to Anglo-French 
intervention in Egypt was expressed 
t a special North Atlantic Council 
meeting called on 31 October to dis-
cuss east situation. There was particular 
concern over the effect the developments might have on 
the NATO alliance. 
Council representatives deplored the 
fact that action had been taken without prior consultation 
with other NATO partners. Most of the representatives 
at the meeting expressed support for the position pre-
sented by the United States. The Canadian representa-
tive regretted the British-French move because the sub-
ject was under consideration in the UN Security Council 
and in view of the current developments in Eastern Europe. 
He was supported by other members. 
Apparently Britain does not envisage 
invocation of the North Atlantic treaty. In answer to an 
Italian question as to the effect from the treaty standpoint 
of an Egyptian attack on British or French naval vessels 
and aircraft in the Mediterranean, the British representa-
tive stated that the treaty was not intended to cover this 
particular case.

7. BRITISH TESTING SAUDI HOLD ON DISPUTED PERSIAN 
GULF ISLAND 
The British ambassador in Tehran in-
formed the American ambassador on 
31 October that an armed British de-, 
tachment was to land temporarily on 
ra 
s an 
m 
the Persian Gulf on 30 or 31 October to 
check on the reported occupation by Saudi Arabia and to 
test the determination of Saudi personnel to remain. The 
detachment had instructions to fire only if necessary to 
cover its withdrawal. 
Comment As recently as 12 October, British offi-
cials. had indicated that Britain could 
probably do no more than protest the Saudi occupation. The 
decision to move onto Arabi may be designed both to dis-
tract Saudi Arabia's attention from the Egyptian situation 
and to demonstrate Britain's determination to maintain all

8. SUKARNO ADMIRES MAO TSE-T IJNG'S LEADERSHIP 
in 
The director of the Indonesian presi-
dent's personal cabinet, Pringgodigdo, 
told the American ambassador in Djakarta 
that Sukarno is "in love with the system 
ma, is ee mg expansive and "braver" since his return 
to Indonesia, and wants to pattern his leadership on that of 
Mao Tse-tung. He said Sukarno has not thought through the 
ramifications of such a role, however. 
Pringgodigdo stated that he himself felt 
the Chinese people were happy and well fed, and that the Chi-
nese leaders were close to the people and popular since they, 
had brought "victory, unity, freedom, and progress:' 
Comment Sukarno reportedly stated in a speech on 
30 October that he had been more im-
pressed by his recent tour to the Soviet Union and Commu-
nist China than by his earlier visit to the United States and 
Western Europe because in the former areas he had seen a 
greater vitality in social and economic progress. Although 
most members of Sukarno's entourage were highly impressed 
with China, Pringgodigdo's opinion is the most enthusiastic 
yet expressed by any anti-Communist who accompanied the 
president. 
Sukarno's favorable impression of the Chi-
nese system probably accounts for his suggestion on 28 Octo-
ber that political parties be abolished--an idea which has been 
denounced by the press and all parties except the Communists.

THE ARAB-ISRAELI SITUATION 
(Information as of 1700, 1 November) 
The Egyptian-dominated Arab confedera-
tion of labor has called on Arab workers to blow up Western 
oil installations if necessary to stop the flow of petroleum. 
The federation also called for destruction of foreign military 
bases in Arab countries which could be used for aggression, 
and for an immediate halt to loading and supplying of ships 
and planes of "aggressive nations:' (Press) 
An announcement from Baghdad states 
that a meeting of all Baghdad pact powers except Britain will 
be held "soon:' The Shah of Iran allegedly will chair the meet-
ing, which may also be attended by the president of Pakistan 
(who is now visiting Tehran), and the Iraqi, Pakistani, Iranian 
and Turkish foreign ministers. (Press) 
Reports from Syria and Jordan indicate the 
governments of these countries, while they feel obliged to sup-
port Egypt, are pessimistic over their capabilities. According 
to one report, the Syrian army staff was reluctant to order mo-
bilization because neither the necessary materiel nor money 
were available. The new Jordanian prime minister told Ambas-
sador Mallory on 31 October that his government was in a "terri-
ble position" and that the only thing which could save Jordan 
Iraq, however, has proclaimed martial law 
and partial mobilization. The Iraqi chief of staff stated on 1 
November that the Iraqi 1st Division began concentrating at pump-
ing station H-3 near the Jordan border on 31 October, prepara-
tory to a move into Jordan as soon as a Jordanian request was 
received. TIEP�ehIP-LaL icsta,ffhe ex ected the request later 
in the day. 
The Libyan government announced on 31 
October that it would use all means in its power to prevent the 
use of British forces in Libya against Egypt. According to the 
press, Libya has declared martial law. British units in Libya 
are reported on a precautionary a1prt: 12 tanks have been moved 
to the vicinity of Benghazi.
