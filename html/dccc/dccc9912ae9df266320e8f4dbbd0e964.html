 Rebel forces continue to harass the Lebanese
 Government in their effort to wear down President
 Chamoun's resistance to opposition demands that he
 abandon any effective political role.                One group
 of opposition leaders has announced it will try to
 discourage Parliament members from meeting on 24
 July to elect a new president, since it fears the
 present Parliament is too favorable to Chamoun.

 SOV IET MOVES IN GENEVA TALKS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  1
 The USSR is continuing its efforts to force
 the West to agree in principle to a cessation of
 nuclear tests or, failing this, to prepare the
 ground for future allegations that Western refus-
 al to cease tests is responsible for any failure
 of the Geneva talks.  The-claim in Moscow's aide-
 memoire of 9 July that it is already clear.-an ef-
 fective control system is "entirely possible."
 suggests the bloc experts will seek to create the
 impression that the Geneva talks are developing
 a wide area of agreement on control measures and
 that only the West's unwillingness to halt tests
 stands in the way of a final agreement.

 Rebel guerrilla activity
 in Sumatra is increasingly effective.                 Although
 President Sukarno is unlikely to support them, army
 leaders in Djakarta are formulating plans to delay
 the scheduled 1959 general elections as a means of
 obstructing the growth of Communist influence.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 STATUS OF PRESIDIUM MEMBER SUSLOV              .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    .  .  .  Page  1
 Although Mikhail Suslov, a member of the Soviet
 party presidium, has not been formally demoted, his
 present standing is equivocal and may not long remain
 publicly unchanged.
 USSR ESTABLISHES PRICES FOR AGRICULTURAL PROCUREMENT .                      .  .  Page  2
 A USSR Council of Ministers resolution, pub-
 lished in the Soviet press on 1 July 1958, lists
 charges which are to be used in establishing region-
 al prices at which the state will purchase agricul-
 tural products from collective farms.  Many fall
 somewhere between the low obligatory delivery prices
 and the higher ones for above-quota produce previous-
 ly in effect.  The total cost to the government will
 remain approximately the same as last year.  The new
 livestock charges are generally higher than the old
 above-quota purchase prices--a move to spur Khrushchev's
 program for "catching-up" with the United States in the
 per capita production of meat.
 EGYPTIAN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY IN LIBYA   .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  3
 The widespread Egyptian campaign of propaganda
 and subversion in Libya is apparently well organized,
 and plans may already be in preparation for over-
 throwing the pro-Western government of King Idriss.

 RELIGIOUS ISSUE DISRUPTS ISRAELI GOVERNMENT   .  .  . .  .  .  .  Page  4
 Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion's government
 is engaged in a dispute with the Orthodox Jewish com-
 munity involving the over-all relationship between
 church and state.  Two cabinet ministers have resigned
 over the problem.  The controversy, which began over
 whether the state or the synagogue is to determine who
 is Jewish, has become a conflict between progressive,
 secular-minded elements and conservative religious
 groups.

 Attempts by Kashmiri refugees to cross the
 cease-fire line into Indian-held Kashmir have pro-
 vided the first occasion since the cease-fire went
 into effect in 1949 to observe Indian and Pakistani
 government reaction to a politically inspired breach
 of the peace.  Their reaction suggests that in the
 event of future unarmed or armed incursions by rela-
 tively small groups, both India and Pakistan would
 try to localize the incidents.

 Phnom Penh's political instability and strained
 relations with South Vietnam and Thailand are creat-
 ing, an atmosphere conducive to greater Communist in-
 fluence in Cambodia.  Convinced of "Western bias"
 against Cambodia, Crown Prince Sihanouk appears to be
 setting the stage for closer ties with the Communist
 bloc, particularly Communist China.  The bloc has
 been quick to express support for Cambodia's position,
 and its propaganda is reiterating Cambodian charges of
 a Vietnamese "invasion."

 India and Japan are becoming increasingly con-
 cerned over Communist China's rapidly expanding ex-
 ports to Southeast Asia.  While Japan's total exports
 to the area have continued to increase in recent
 years, China has displaced Japan as the supplier of
 certain goods in several countries.   India's exports
 to Southeast Asia, formerly considerably larger than
 China's, have been surpassed by Chinese exports in
 the last two years.
 RECALL OF PEIPING'S ENVOYS SUGGESTS NEW F1tEIGN PCUCY LINE .  .  Page  8
 A number of Communist China's senior diplomats,
 including-those in the USSR, Yugoslavia, India,
 Indonesia, and Pakistan, have returned to Peiping
 since April, apparently to participate in the party
 congress from 5-23 May.  None is known to have left,
 and they may be coordinating new foreign policy ap-
 proaches.  Failure since 1955 to win wider interna-
 tional recognition with a conciliatory policy may
 have prompted Peiping to adopt a harsher line.

 Communist China is moving urgently to exploit
 the petroleum deposits recently discovered in cen-
 tral Szechwan Province, and it is apparent that
 Peiping feels development of this field could go
 a long way toward solving its petroleum supply prob-
 lem.  Prospecting and drilling have been greatly ac-

 trans ortation facilities are being improved.

 Premier de Gaulle's appointment of Jacques
 Soustelle to the cabinet is designed partly to ap-
 pease extremists in Algeria but also to utilize
 Soustelle's past experience as minister of informa-
 tion in preparing public opinion for the consti-
 tutional changes which his government is now en-
 gaged in drafting and on which its hopes of stabil-
 ity depend.  After the October referendum on con-
 stitutional reforms, De Gaulle may make public his
 ideas on the Aleerian question.

 PART II (continued)
 THE POLITICAL OUTLOOK IN FINLAND .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  Page  14
 Finland faces a period of political uncertain-
 ty as a result of the 6-7 July parliamentary elec-
 tions.  The Communist-front Finnish People's Demo-
 cratic League, which increased its seats from 43 to
 50 in the 200-member Diet, is certain to demand
 participation in the new cabinet, but the democratic
 parties will almost certainly balk at this.  The
 most likely eventual outcome appears to be a renew-
 al of Social Democratic - Agrarian cooperation,
 which has been the basis for most of Finland's post-
 war governments.  For the past year, however, the
 two parties have been in basic disagreement over
 economic policies.
 THE SITUATION IN CUBA   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 15
 The Cuban Army's renewed all-out offensive
 against the rebels in Oriente Province may elicit
 new charges of US aid to Batista and further rebel
 retaliations against American personnel and prop-
 erty.  Rebel forces of Fidel and Raul Castro are
 evidently effectively separated but will be hard
 to defeat in the mountainous terrain.
 ARGENTINE MILITARY DISCONTENT   .  .  .  . .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 16
 Discontent in Argentine military circles over
 President Frondizi's appointments and policies con-
 cerning Peronism and over his failure to make key
 decisions on economic problems has grown in the last
 week.   Military dissension precipitated cancella-
 tion of the annual armed forces' banquet on 7 July,
 and anti-Peronista feeling has been heightened by
 the dismissal of several judges.  The scale of un-
 rest is not sufficient at the moment to upset the
 administration, but these expanding controversies
 probably increase the opportunities-for a coup b
 disaffected military elements.

 ing energy,       the failure of some of his personal poli-
 cies, and the increasing strength of Liu and his close
 associates.  However, Mao has apparently taken the
 initiative in the past year to correct or conceal his
 earlier mistakes, and Liu and Teng Hsiao-ping have
 played the major roles in helping him do so.  The
 Liu-Teng group is so emphatically associated with
 Mao's present policies, particularly. with the hazard-
 ous campaign for a "giant leap forward," that it will
 not be in a good position to force Mao to retire if
 the program fails.
 BLOC ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN AFRICA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  5
 The bloc economic penetration effort in Afri-
 ca is primarily focused on Egypt and the independent
 nations of North and East Africa, particularly Libya,
 Tunisia, Algeria, Ethiopia, and the Sudan.   Substan-
 tial economic and military aid is being extended to
 Egypt, but elsewhere this activity is restricted to
 attempts at increasing trade relations.  There has,
 been a gradual rise in bloc trade with Africa since
 1955; in 1957 the bloc accounted for about 5 percent
 of the continent's total world trade.
 THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF EURATOM AND THE COMMON MARKET   .     Page  8
 Six months after the EURATOM and Common Market
 treaties came into effect, substantial organization-
 al progress has been made, and the community's in-
 stitutions are increasingly influential in the intern-
 al and external policies of the member states.  How-
 ever, the political and economic problems De Gaulle
 faces in France have cast a shadow on these otherwise
 encouraging developments.
 PANAMA AND THE CANAL ZONE   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 12
 Recurrent agitation among Panamanians for recog-
 nition of their country's sovereignty in the Canal
 Zone and for a larger share in canal income and opera-
 tion has intensified since the seizure of the Suez
 Canal by Egypt in 1956.   Severe domestic economic and
 political difficulties have aggravated this issue.
 Pro-US President de la Guardia's position is not se-
 cure and he may be forced from office before his term
 ends in 1960.  The Soviet press and radio have recent-
 ly given considerable attention to Panamanian com-
 plaints against the United States.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 July 1958
 Lebanese rebel  military
 operations, while not as vigor-
 onsl as in the earlier weeks of
 the disorders, maintained pres-
 sure on government forces                 in
 the Tripoli and Beirut areas
 during the past week.   Army
 commander Shihab, who had   an
 opportunity to  pursue rebel
 Druze forces into the mountains
 southeast of the capital, re-
 frained from doing so and demon-
 strated again his determination
 to remain on the defensive un-
 til some political compromise
 has been reached.   A new rebel
 effort around Balabakk in the
 Biqa Valley may  materialize;
 meetings to plan such a move
 are reported to have been held
 last week.
 The Syrian region of the
 UAR, meanwhile, apparently re-
 mains open to Lebanese rebels
 as a safe haven where wounded
 may be brought and arms  ac-
 quired, although there have
 been no firm reports of  new
 mass infiltrations from Syria.
 Talk of a political com-
 promise has increased consid-
 erably,but there has been lit-
 tle in the way of serious pro-
 posals and no signs that lead-
 ers of either side are getting
 together.   In a manifesto is-
 sued after a meeting on 6 July,
 a group of rebel leaders  an-
 nounced they oppose a meeting
 of Parliament on 24 July  to
 elect a new president, osten-
 sibly on the ground that                                                              the
 present Parliament is controlled
 by Chamoun.
 This group insists that
 Chamoun resign before an  elec-
 tion; they offer as candidates
 to succeed him two individuals,
 neither of whom would be accept-
 able to the pro-Chamoun camp.

 Western experts that the talks
 must "pave the way"  for        an
 agreement on test cessation,
 but has not abandoned its basic
 political objective of forcing
 the West to stop tests.
 Y. K. Fedorov, chairman of
 the bloc delegation, after "re-
 gretting" the-"inability"  'of
 his Western colleagues to give
 a satisfactory definition of
 the purpose of the talks, stated
 that although "positions as to
 the basic aim of the conference
 do differ," there exists "gen-
 eral ground sufficient for out
 work."
 The USSR is attempting to
 give the impression that  the
 talks are progressing satisfac-
 torily by keeping  them  on a
 purely technical level while
 at the same time pressing the
 US through diplomatic channels
 to agree to test  suspension.
 Foreign Minister Gromyko, when
 handing the latest Soviet note
 to Ambassador Thompson, stated
 that the experts were continu-
 ing their "fruitful work."  The
 note contains no implied threat
 to break up the meeting, and
 Moscow apparently feels a facade
 of serious negotiation at Geneva,
 coupled with more indirect pres-
 sures at the official  level,
 is the most effective tactic
 for the present.
 The aide-memoire claims
 that it is already quite clear
 that an effective control system
 is "entirely possible," which
 suggests that the bloc experts
 will seek to create the impres-
 sion that the talks are devel-
 oping a wide area of agreement
 on control measures,   and that
 only the West's unwillingness
 to halt tests stands in the.way
 of a final agreement.
 At Geneva, the Soviet dele-
 gation presented an agenda call-
 ing for discussions concerning
 a control system and final re-
 ports by the delegates to their
 respective governments cover-
 ing "conclusions and sugges-
 tions concerning the control
 system to observe an agreement
 on nuclear test  cessation."
 The fact that this agenda was
 adopted will probably be used
 by Moscow to claim  Western
 acceptance of the Soviet thesis
 linking the conference results
 to a future  agreement on test
 suspension.
 In the discussions,  the
 Soviet experts have concentrated
 on the  exposition  of   known
 theoretical material with lit-
 tle reference to actual recorded
 data on nuclear tests.   After
 each discussion they have pre-
 sented a draft "conclusion con-
 cerning the suitability" of the
 various methods  of   possible
 detection.   This  attempt  to
 reach a final  decision  after
 superficial exploration,   to-
 gether with Fedorov's state-
 ment that he wanted                                                                   the con-
 ference   `o                                                                end as  soon as
 possible,   suggests that the
 USSR will push toward an early
 conclusion urging the govern-
 ments to effect an agreement
 banning nuclear tests.
 The Soviet delegates   are
 also attempting to use the pres-
 ence of experts from other bloc
 nations to reinforce the USSR's
 position on  parity of          repre-
 sentation between  East  and
 West.   They regard their side
 as being composed of four sep-
 arate                                                               national  delegations
 and rotate their chairmanship
 in turn Among the bloc nation-
 alities.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 July 1958
 Although President Sukarno
 is unlikely to support  them,
 army leaders in Djakarta are
 formulating plans to delay-the
 1959 general  elections as A
 means of obstructing the growth
 of Communist influence.  The
 Communists have sent telegrams
 to the prime minister and other
 officials urging that no one be
 allowed "deliberately to sabo-
 tage" election preparations.
 Elections are scheduled
 for 29 September 1959.   The in-
 formation minister announced
 in late May that the govern*ent
 had no intention of postponing
 them if the domestic situation
 "remains unchanged."
 The Communists are already
 planning their campaign and in-
 tend to concentrate on  non-
 Javanese areas.   Non-Communist
 parties do not appear to be mak-
 ing any specific election plans
 and are engaged in little ac-
 tivity to strengthen their posi-
 tion.
 In the 1955 general elec-
 tions, the Communists won 16
 percent of the popular vote and
 24 percent of the vote in Java,
 where 60 percent of Indonesia's
 population is concentrated.   In
 the 1957 local elections in Java,
 they jumped from the third larg-
 est to the largest party, win-
 ning 30 percent of the popular
 vote.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 STATUS OF ' PRESIDIUM MEMBER SUSLOV
 Although Mikhail Suslov,a
 member of the Soviet party pre-
 sidium, has not been formally
 demoted, his present standing
 is highly equivocal and may not
 long remain publicly unchanged.
 Suslov apparently left Moscow
 around 17 May and was not pres-
 ent at the top-level meeting of
 bloc leaders in Moscow toward
 the end of the month.   On  10
 June Aleksei Kirichenko, Otto
 Kuusinen, and Boris Ponomarev
 conferred with a visiting Aus-
 trian Communist party delega-
 tion.  This is the first time
 Kirichenko has participated in
 talks of this nature.   In the
 past year, the Soviet side has
 been represented, almost with-
 out exception, by Suslov and/or
 Pyotr Pospelov, Ponomarev, and
 sometimes Kuusinen.
 On 12 June Premier Khru-
 shchev, in answer to reporters'
 questions, stated that Suslov
 was vacationing on the Black
 Sea and would be back in Mos-
 cow in a few days.   Khrushchev
 added that Suslov had accumu-
 lated considerable annual leave
 and therefore would be in Mos-
 cow only a short time before
 taking off again.
 On 17 June  the central
 committee  convened--for  the
 second time in six weeks--osten-
 sibly to decide on agricultural
 price reforms.   There were no
 collective public appearances
 of top Soviet leaders at  that
 time which would have indicated
 who attended the plenum, but,
 on the basis of Khrushchev's
 earlier remarks about Suslov's
 activities, it was assumed he
 was there.   However
 Suslov
 had not returned to Moscow to
 attend the plenum.
 Suslov was back in Moscow
 in time to attend a central com-
 mittee dinner in honor of visit-
 ing Czech leader Antonin Novotny
 on 2 July.   He attended a lunch
 given by Novotny on the follow-
 ing day, but did not participate
 in the official talks.   The So-
 viet side was represented  by
 Klementi Voroshilov, Anastas
 Mikoyan, Khrushchev, Pospelov,
 losif Kuzmin, and Andrei Gromyko.
 On 8 July Suslov was on hand,
 along with Mikoyan and Nikolai
 Shvernik, at the airport to see
 Khrushchev off to East Germany.
 These factors suggest that Sus-
 lov is gradually being divested
 of some of his responsibilities
 for bloc and foreign Communist
 party affairs.
 Another bit of speculation
 concerning Suslov is the view

 have protested against the de-
 cree's criticism of the earlier
 1948 music decree with which he
 was associated.
 Finally the US Embassy in
 Moscow reports that continued
 opposition to the February cen-
 tral committee plenum decision
 to abolish the machine tractor
 stations is suggested by the
 continued appearance of arti-
 cles arguing against "misguided"
 views of "some economists" and
 occasionally "some comrades"
 as well.   The embassy points out
 that refutation of these "mis-
 guided" views is expressed in
 gentle and honpolemical terms,
 perhaps because of a lack of
 confidence by supporters of the
 reorganization in the strength
 of their theoretical position.
 Suslov has been associated with
 this opposition because of his
 long delay in joining all other
 top Soviet leaders in praising
 the scheme.
 USSR ESTABLISHES PRICES FOR AGRICULTURAL PROCUREMENT
 A USSR Council of Minis-
 ters' resolution, published in
 the Soviet press on 1 July 1958,
 lists charges which are to be
 used in establishing regional
 prices at which the state will
 purchase agricultural products
 from collective farms.  The
 prices actually paid are to
 vary from year to year, depend-
 ing on the size of the harvest.

 published charges indicates
 that many fall between the old
 obligatory delivery prices
 which were very low and the
 higher ones for above-quota
 produce.
 The most notable  excep-
 tions to this rule are those
 for livestock.   As compared
 with prices established in Sep-
 tember 1953, and apparently
 still in effect at least through
 1956, the new livestock charges
 are generally higher than the
 old above-quota purchase prices.
 These new prices are evidently
 intended to provide an incen-
 tive for Khrushchev's program
 for "catching up" with the
 United States in the per capita
 production of meat.
 In commenting on the gener-
 al  level of the new prices,
 N. S. Khrushchev in his speech
 before the June 1958 meeting
 of the Soviet party central com-
 mittee stated that state ex-
 penditures for collective farm
 produce were to remain unchanged
 from 1957 expenditures, or the
 expenditures planned for 1958
 under the old system.   He went
 on to tie in the amounts to be
 paid to the collective farms
 under the new procurement sys-
 tem with funds previously paid
 to collective farms and allo-
 cated by the state to the ma-
 chine tractor stations (MTS's).
 The resolution stipulates
 that lists of standard whole-
 sale prices for agricultural
 machinery and spare parts are
 to be established.   New ma-
 chinery is to be sold at cost

 Gosplan within four weeks.
 Tractor fuel is to be sold to
 the farms at wholesale prices.
 All agricultural enterprises
 are apparently to pay the same
 price for supplies and equip-
 ment.
 The USSR Council of Minis-
 ters has the responsibility for
 determining the procurement
 plans for  most  agricultural
 products and distributing the
 planned quotas to the republics,
 according to the resolution.
 The Councils of Ministers of
 the union republics have re-
 sponsibility for formulating
 procurement  plans for some
 minor agricultural products.
 The resolution recommends
 that the collective farms or-
 ganize the collection and trans-
 portation of surplus produce
 which the individual collective
 farmers have for sale in order
 to avoid the excessive waste of
 time incurred by individuals
 each selling their own produce.
 The prices paid for such prod-
 uce by the state or  cooperative
 organizations are to be the same
 as the new state purchase prices,
 and the procurement organiza-
 tions are obligated to pay the
 collective farms for the trans-
 portation costs.
 The resolution directs
 that proposals be submitted for
 increasing the 1958 plan for
 the procurement of "cereals,
 sugar beets, and other agricul-
 tural produce," in view of the
 present favorable prospects for
 this  ear's harvest.

 RELIGIOUS ISSUE DISRUPTS ISRAELI GOVERNMENT
 Israeli Prime Minister Ben-
 Gurion's government is engaged
 in a dispute with the Orthodox
 Jewish community involving the
 over-all relationship between
 religion and the state.  The
 controversy, which began over
 whether the state or the syna-
 gogue shall determine who is
 Jewish, has become a conflict
 between progressive secular-
 minded elements and conserva-
 tive religious groups.  Ben-
 Gurion is said to believe he
 has reached the limit of con-
 cessions he can make to the
 Orthodox Jewish community with-
 out altering the state's basic
 secular character.  He declared
 publicly on 2 July that Israel.
 is not a theocracy and will not
 be ruled by rabbis.

 identity cards--a question of
 importance because of the juris-
 diction exercised by religious
 courts in Israel over matters
 affecting personal status.   Ac-
 cording to Jewish religious lay,
 to be a Jew a child must be
 born of a Jewish mother.   Last
 week the National Religious
 party (NRP) offered a compro-
 mise solution, suggesting that
 children of non-Jewish mothers
 be required to undergo a con-
 version ceremony after which
 they would be listed as Jews
 on identity cards.   In reply,
 however, the cabinet reaffirmed
 its'. decision  of.' 22 June
 that a person who declares he
 is a Jew, or whose parents de-
 clare he is, even though one
 parent may not be Jewish, will
 be so listed if he does not
 profess another faith.   The NRP
 rejected this decision and has
 withdrawn from the governing
 coalition; its two cabinet
 ministers have resigned.
 The NRP may stand firm
 on the question in hopes of
 exploiting the controversy
 before elections to the Israeli
 Knesset scheduled for 1959.   The
 NRP probably feels it can more
 readily attract support from
 Israel's large proportion of
 strongly Orthodox Jewish immi-
 grants from North Africa and the
 Middle East by emphasizing the
 party's independence.
 Ben-Gurion maintains that
 the government of Israel "does
 not consider itself authorized
 to decide who is a religious
 Jew.    The question it has to
 consider is: Who is a Jew by
 nationality?"  The prime minis-
 ttr'S  adamant position may be
 a tactical maneuver since he
 probably could not win a pro-
 longed dispute against religious
 sentiment.   His recent remarks,
 however, suggest that he, too,
 may have decided to make a de-
 termined stand on the issue.
 As a result of the NRIR's with-
 drawal, the parliamentary major-
 ity controlled by the government
 has been reduced to 64 out of
 120 seats, giving the balance
 of power to the radical left-
 wing Mapam party, which holds
 nine seats.
 Efforts by unarmed Kash-
 miri refugees since 28 June to
 march from the Pakistani to the
 Indian side of the cease-fire
 line in Kashmir have provided
 the first occasion since the
 cease-fire went into effect on
 1 January 1949 to observe the
 reaction of the Indian and Pak
 istani governments to political-
 ly inspired breach of the peace
 in this area.   Their reaction
 suggests that in the event of
 future armed or unarmed incur-
 sions by relatively small
 groups, both India and Pakistan
 would try to localize the inci-
 dent.   Popular reaction to the?
 present ~marchelk? alto indicates
 that the Pakistani public now
 has less interest in Kashmir than
 in the past.
 The refugees under Choudhri
 Ghulam Abbas, leader of the
 "Kashmir Liberation Movement,"
 have made several attempts to
 cross the cease-fire line in
 small groups of 50 or less.   Al-
 though most of them have been
 arrested and subsequently re-
 leased in rear areas,  some 100
 persons are reported to have
 reached Indian-held territory

 against his wishes,. has resumed
 the premiership on a temporary
 basis.   Sihanouk's demagogic
 inclinations and his resent-
 ment at what he considers West-
 ern bias against Cambodia raise
 the danger that he may lead
 Cambodia into closer ties with
 Peiping.
 There are serious obsta-
 cles to an early improvement
 in the strained relations be-
 tween Cambodia and South Viet-
 nam--essential for restoring
 a sense of balance to Cambo-
 dia's international outlook.
 Sihanouk has canceled plans
 to visit Saigon for negotiaj-
 tions, citing "insulting" Viet-
 namese press articles.   In
 Saigon, President Diem seems
 convinced that no effective
 settlement can be reached with
 the "untrustworthy" Sihanouk.
 Sihanouk, capitalizing on
 Phnom Penh's charges of 25 June
 of a Vietnamese  "invasion"
 and    subsequent appeals  for
 foreign  support,   is  pictur-
 ing Cambodia as a friendless
 country in danger of being
 "nibbled to death" by its West-
 ern-supported neighbors.                           In
 recent   public  statements  he
 has cited the necessity for Cam-
 bodia to end its "isolation" by
 establishing "indispensable
 outside contacts,"" although re-
 taining a neutral policy.   His
 references to a forthcoming vis-
 it to Communist China and to
 the possible need for Cambodia
 to find a "new ally" have con-
 tributed to the rise of wide-
 spread rumors in Phnom Penh that
 Cambodia will shortly enter in-
 to diplomatic relations with
 Peiping.
 the Cambodian Government has al-
 ready-'decided to grant at least
 quasi-diplomatic recognition to
 Peiping.  At present Communist,
 China has only an economic mis-
 sion in Phnom Penh.
 Expressions of support for
 Cambodia have been quickly forth-
 coming from the Sino-Soviet bloc,
 which is denouncing South Viet-
 nam as an "aggressive base of
 the imperialists."  The head of
 the Chinese Communist economic
 mission stationed in Phnom Pehh
 is also reported to have ..as-
 sured King Suramarit of Peiping's
 full support in Cambodia's dis-
 pute with Vietnam.
 INDIA, JAPAN WORRIED BY RISING CHINESE EXPORTS TO SOUTHEAST ASIA
 India and Japan are becom-
 ing increasingly concerned over
 Communist China's rapidly ex-
 panding exports to Southeast
 Asia.   While Japan's total ex-
 ports to the area have contin-
 ued to increase in recent years
 --partly because of reparations
 payments--China has displaced
 Japan as the supplier of cer-
 tain goods in several countries

 longed stay in Peiping indicates
 this was not the sole purpose
 for their return.   None is known
 to have left, and the gathering
 suggests strongly that discus-
 sions and coordination of new
 foreign policy lines were
 planned.   All signs point to
 a harsher line in the future.
 Peiping's unequivocal stand
 with the USSR against "revision-
 ism," as exemplified by Tito,
 reflects the hardening Sino-
 Soviet line in bloc affairs,
 and the Chinese Communists are
 turning a sterner face to the
 free world also.   Peiping's
 embargo on commercial and cul-

 continued unabated since May,
 and the regime has recently
 PEIPING EXPLOITING NEW SZECHWAN OIL FIELD
 The Chinese Communists are
 moving with energy and speed to
 exploit the newly discovered oil
 deposits in central Szechwan
 Province, and it is apparent
 that they believe the new field
 could go a long way toward solv-
 ing China's petroleum supply
 problem.   The petroleum indus-
 try registered the only signif-
 icant industrial shortfall dur-
 ing the First Five-Year Plan
 (1953-57).   Development of a
 major source of supply in Szech-
 wan--which is better situated
 with respect to transportation,
 important consuming areas, and
 existing refining facilities
 than other oil fields now un-
 der development--would give a
 large boost to China's chances
 of  reaching  the  goal  of
 5,000,000-6,000,000 tons of crude
 petroleum annually by 1962 set
 up in the original Second Five-
 Year Plan.
 25X1
 Prospecting in central
 Szechwan has been greatly ac-
 celerated since the discovery
 in March of three oil deposits
 in the Nanchung area.   Some 120
 wells are to be drilled this
 year--ten times as many as orig-
 inally planned--and workers have
 been transferred to Szechwan
 from other oil fields.   Con-
 struction is under way on sev-
 eral small refineries in the
 area.   A larger one, capable of
 handling 200,000-300,000 tons a
 year, has been started near Nan-
 chung.   A recent press report from

 issued a peremptory statement
 demanding that the US agree by
 14 July  to the resumption of
 Sino-American talks at the am-
 bassadorial level.
 Peiping's conciliatory
 foreign policy practiced since
 the Bandung conference in 1955
 has done little to win wider
 international recognition.
 Moreover, the Chinese Communists
 have shown increasing concern
 that their moderate policies
 are taken as indications of
 weakness.   They can probably
 be expected to assume a more
 unyielding pose in the conduct
 of their foreign relations. A
 policy of greater firmness
 would fit well with Peiping's
 intense efforts to whip up pop-
 ular fervor for the quick at-
 tainment of economic goals.

 FRENCH GOVERNMENT PROBLEMS
 Premier de Gaulle's ap-
 pointment of Jacques Soustelle
 to the cabinet  is   designed
 partly to appease  extremists
 in Algeria but also to utilize
 Soustelle's past experience as
 minister of information in pre-
 paring public opinion for the
 constitutional changes  which
 his government is now engaged
 in drafting and on which its
 hopes of stability depend.   Af-
 ter the October referendum              on
 constitutional  reforms,   De
 Gaulle may  make  public  his
 ideas on the Algerian question.
 De Gaulle's 1-3 July visit
 to Algeria probably   reduced
 somewhat the influence of set-
 tler extremists over the army,
 and the appointment of Jacques
 Soustelle to the cabinet has
 mollified much settler discon-
 tent.   There is, nevertheless,
 considerable suspicion among
 both settler and army elements
 regarding De Gaulle's ultimate
 aims for Algeria, and he may
 yet be obliged to replace some
 military commanders and clamp
 down on civilian malcontents.
 In the meantime, he can be
 expected to step up military ac-
 tions against the rebels and
 broaden his appeal to the Mos-
 lem population.   He may attempt
 some spectacular move, such as
 (Prepared by       25X1
 adding a Moslem to the French
 cabinet or releasing the five
 rebel chiefs seized in October
 1956.   The adverse effect the re-
 lease of rebel leaders would
 have on the settlers and  army
 elements may, however,   deter
 him from the latter move.
 Although the Soustelle ap-
 pointment was partly
 designed
 to appease extremists
 in  Al-
 geria, De
 Gaulle will
 probably
 depend on
 Soustelle's
 1945 ex-
 perience
 as minister
 of infor-
 mation to help him prepare the
 campaign for constitutional re-
 form.   If a referendum is to be
 held on the revisions on 5 Oc-
 tober, much preparatory  work
 must be telescoped.   The assem-
 bly committee draft is to be com-
 pleted by the end of July.  A
 consultative committee of dep-
 uties, senators,   and jurists
 must then consider it on a "crash"
 basis in order to give the gov-
 ernment time for final changes
 before De Gaulle opens the ref-
 erendum campaign on 4 September.
 Socialist party sources say the
 voters will be given a choice in
 the referendum on whether they
 believe the present constitution
 needs changing.
 The Communists are already

 10 July 1958
 Finland faces a period of
 political uncertainty as a re-
 sult of the sharp Communist
 gains in the 6-7 July parlia-
 mentary elections.   While the
 Communist-front Finnish People's
 Democratic League (SKDL) will
 demand to be included in any
 new government, some kind of
 center coalition,  involving the
 Agrarians and the Social Demo-
 crats, will in the end probably
 form a government.
 Its main task will
 be to formulate an
 effective program
 to deal with Fin-
 land's pressing eco-
 nomic problems.
 Nearly complete
 returns indicate that
 the SKDL increased
 its seats from 43 to
 50 out of 200 and
 became the largest
 party in Parliament.
 The Social Democrats
 and the Agrarians
 lost seats, while the conserva-
 tive National Coalition party
 made gains.   The Communists
 benefited from the small turn-
 out of voters, the apparent
 dissatisfaction of farmers
 with the economic policies of
 the Agrarians, and the two-
 year-long factional struggle--
 largely personality clashes--
 between the Social Democratic
 party organization and the
 Socialist trade union leader-
 ship.  Economic questions such
 as unemployment, prices and
 wages,  and farm subsidies
 were the primary issues, which
 the Communists appear to have
 successfully exploited.   For-
 eign policy questions had lit-
 tle effect on the election.
 President Kekkonen's recent
 visit to the Soviet Union and
 the various last-minute Soviet
 offers of economic assistance

 apparently had little effect
 on the voters.
 Negotiations for the for-
 mation of a new government will
 be protracted, and the nonpolit-
 ical government of Reino Kuusko-
 ski, which took office in April,
 may remain in office until late
 in the summer.   The SKDL, which
 has not had cabinet representa-
 tion since 1948, is certain to
 demand participation on the basis
 of its increased parliamentary
 representation.  These Communist
 efforts are unlikely, however,
 to be successful in view of the

 The most likely outcome is
 a renewal of the Social Demo-

 which has been the basis of most

 parties must reach agreement

 THE SITUATION IN CUBA
 New fighting between Cu-
 ban rebels and the army of
 President Batista in Oriente
 Province may further involve
 US personnel and interests in
 Cuba.    The recent rebel kid-
 naping of 50 Americans and
 Canadians highlighted the in-
 terruption of plantation and
 mining activities that has been
 occurring for some time.   The
 US consul who negotiated with
 the insurgents for the men's
 release fears a renewed Cuban
 army offensive will elicit new
 charges of US aid to Batista
 and result in rebel retalia-
 tions against US citizens.   The
 strong government land and air
 offensive launched in June was
 suspended east,of Santiago at
 US request during the release
 negotiations, but Batista con-
 tinued to reinforce military
 units, installing some of them
 on American-owned properties.
 Batista remains determined
 to wipe out rebel leader Fidel
 Castro and complete his presi-
 dential term--ending in Febru-
 ary 1959.   His inability thus
 far to defeat the rebels, de-
 spite a, year and _a half of

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 July 1958
 ARGENTINE MILITARY DISCONTENT
 Increasing discontent in
 Argentine military circles re-
 garding President Frondizi's
 policies concern mainly the
 generous amnesty for Peronistas,
 official appointments, and slow
 action on economic problems.
 Frondizi has appointed Peron-
 istas to important subcabinet
 positions, and antigovernment
 sources charge that pro-Com-
 munists have also received
 official posts.
 The forced retirement or
 change in posts of a number of
 military commanders appointed
 by the former Aramburu regime
 has also contributed to discon-
 tent.   Unconfirmed rumors that
 "many" former supporters of
 Peron have received key army
 posts were reportedly one cause
 for the cancellation of the
 annual armed forces "comrade-
 ship banquet" scheduled for 7
 July.
 The immediate reason for
 the cancellation was the navy's
 announcement on 4 July of plans
 to purchase the British air-
 craft carrier  Warrior,   which
 would increase the navy's power
 relative to the other services.
 The army and air force secre-
 taries protested to Frondizi
 and refused to attend the ban-
 quet.   Later Frondizi also
 refused to attend after reading
 the draft of a toast to be
 given by Admiral Arturo Rial,
 a principal navy spokesman and
 a powerful opponent of Peron.
 Rial was subsequently put under
 eight days' arrest.
 Both Aramburu and Rial
 believe that Frondizi--in of-
 fice only since 1 May--should
 be given a chance to prove
 himself and that public opinion
 would oppose a coup.   Anti-
 Peronista sentiment, however,
 appears gradually hardening.
 A Supreme Court decision on
 4 July denying an appeal for
 reinstatement by a lower civil
 court judge--who was one of
 several recently dismissed--
 prompted riots and the sympa-
 thetic resignations of numer-
 ous judges throughout the coun-
 try.   Subsequently, the presi-
 dent of the Supreme Court re-
 signed.   These developments
 could help undermine confidence
 in the Frondizi regime and pro-
 vide political issues for
 dissident military elements
 to exploit.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 25X1
 MAO TSE-TUNG,AND HIS
 Reports that Mao Tse-tung
 is being"displaced"by Liu Shao-
 chi as the dominant figure in
 Communist China seem misleading.
 Mao does appear to be more
 vulnerable  than he was two
 years ago, owing to declining
 energy, the failure of some of
 his personal policies, and the
 increasing strength of Liu and
 his close associates.   However,
 Mao has apparently taken the
 initiative in the past year to
 correct or conceal his earlier
 mistakes, and Liu and Teng
 Hsiao-ping have played the major
 roles in helping him do so. The
 Liu-Teng "organizational" group
 is so emphatically associated
 with Mao's present. policies,
 particularly with the hazardous
 campaign for a "giant leap for-
 ward," that it will not be in
 a good position to force Mao
 to retire-if the program fails.
 While the Chinese press
 emphatically insisted during
 Mao's four months of travel fol-
 lowing his return to China that
 he looked and felt fine, photo-
 graphs gave a different impres-  25X1
 sion, and the press itself ad-
 mitted that Mao was still unable
 to walk easily.
 Intervention in Planning
 In July 1955, Mao personal-
 ly imposed the decision to so-
 cialize agriculture as rapidly
 as possible.   In so doing, he
 reversed the line of the party
 central committee and of every
 party leader who had spoken on
 this subject, including Liu
 Shao-chi.   Mao's decision was at
 least temporarily vindicated,
 however, in that the peasants
 were herded into cooperatives
 and then collectives without
 much bloodshed and without seri-
 ous damage to agricultural pro-
 duction.
 In December 1955, after a
 good harvest,  Mao  announced
 that the outstanding problem
 was "rightist conservatism"
 with  respect   to  production
 and construction.   Mao is said
 to have introduced at that time
 the slogan--resurrected in the
 fall of 1957--of achieving
 "greater, faster, better, and
 more economical results" si-
 multaneously.   In the  early
 months of 1956, Mao incited the
 party to drive ahead in all
 spheres of activity as rapidly

 was apparent that the program
 was out of balance.   In August
 and September, the party in ef-
 fect declared that Mao had been
 wrong.   It admitted that its
 construction plans would have
 to be cut back, and it affirmed
 a determination to steer a
 course henceforth  between
 "rightist  conservatism"  and
 "leftist adventurism."
 The party congress of
 September 1956 somewhat reduced
 Mao's supremacy over. his lieu-
 tenants.                        Liu Shao-chi,  rather
 than Mao as at the previous con-
 gress, gave the principal re-
 port.   Mao remained chairman of
 the politburo, but four vice
 chairmen were added.   Mao, those
 four, and Secretary General Teng
 Hsiao-ping became the new stand-
 ing committee of the politburo.
 Teng, who since 1952 had become
 closely associated with Liu in
 party work, was named the senior
 member of the party secretariat,
 and thus became the only person
 concurrently a member of the
 three most important party or-
 gans.
 Mao's "Liberal" Line

 and Chou En-lai reportedly ex-
 nressed sympathy,
 aspirations to greater
 independence from Moscow.   Liu
 Shao-chi, who had led the Chi-
 nese party's attack on Tito in
 1948, apparently took no part
 in these talks.   Throughout the
 autumn of 1956 and winter of
 25X
 1956-57, Peiping was publicly
 critical of certain features of
 Soviet behavior.
 25
 Although Peiping had re-
 peatedly made clear its agree-
 ment with Moscow on the "basic
 laws" of Communist states,  Chi-
 nese reservations about Soviet
 policies were seized on and
 greatly exaggerated by Eastern
 European deviants.   This trend
 was accelerated by Mao in Feb-
 ruary 1957, in a speech in which
 he declared himself in favor
 of a liberal policy for handling
 China's domestic problems and
 made  some  derisive  remarks
 about  Soviet inflexibility.
 Mao  did  not  turn again 'to
 Eastern  European  affairs  un-

 had failed.
 Back in January 1956, Mao
 had taken the first step toward
 domestic "liberalization" by
 proposing, through Chou En-lai,
 better treatment of intellectuals.
 In May 1956, Mao took another

 step with his "hundred flowers"
 concept.   The program began to
 catch hold after February 1957,
 when Mao reaffirmed his line
 and reportedly declared he had
 insisted on it despite opposi-
 tion from most of the party.
 During May and June 1957, after
 another urging by Mao,  many in-
 tellectuals spoke out boldly,
 assailing the Communist party's
 monopoly of power and all of
 its major policies.   Mao had
 clearly miscalculated the extent
 of his regime's popular support.
 By June 1957, Mao's pres-
 tige among at least some of his
 lieutenants had probably de-
 clined.   To them, he had been
 proved wrong in inciting a head-
 long course in construction and
 production, wrong again in en-
 couraging a soft policy in in-
 trabloc relations, and wrong
 again in insisting on "liberali-
 zation" in China.   Of his prin-
 cipal lieutenants, Chou En-lai
 had been the most closely as-
 sociated with him in all three
 policies, but perhaps not alto-
 gether willingly.  Liu Shao-chi
 and Teng  Hsiao-ping  had  not
 been so associated,   had ap-
 parently opposed the                      "hundred
 flowers" policy, and may well
 have opposed Mao's line on in-
 trabloc relations.   After Mao
 took the lead to repair the
 damage, Liu and Teng  played
 the major roles in helping him.
 Mao moved first against
 "liberalization." He published
 in June 1957 a much-revised of-
 ficial version of his February
 speech which strongly reaffirmed
 orthodox positions--for  the
 benefit of his Eastern European
 as well as Chinese audience--
 and cut off all fundamental
 criticism.   In July,  Mao called
 together the central committee
 and laid down lines for a na-
 tionwide "rectification" cam-
 paign.   Teng Hsiao-ping  was
 chosen in September    to state
 publicly  and  in  detail  the
 party's plans for indoctrinat-
 ing the Chinese  populace  in
 dogmas  henceforth   not  to be
 questioned.
 The party leadership turned
 next to economic planning, which
 had been comparatively conserva-
 tive since the summer of 1956.
 With the assurance of a good
 harvest and the rebuilding of in-
 ventories, the party chose to re-
 turn to the anticonservative line
 of late 1955 and early 1956. Al-
 though Mao's initiative is not
 certain, Liu in May 1958 declared
 that Mao in September 1957 person-
 ally issued the call to overtake
 Britain within 15 years.   "Or-
 ganizational" figures made most
 of the major statements in the
 developing anticonservative cam-
 paign during the fall of 1957.
 Teng Hsiao-ping and his deputy
 Tan Chen-lin attacked in particu-
 lar conservative thinking in
 agriculture, and Liu Shao-chi
 attacked conservatism of every
 kind.
 Mao then turned to intra-
 bloc relations.   At the meet-
 ings in Moscow of Communist par-
 ties in November, Mao, who was
 accompanied by Teng Hsiao-ping,
 stated Peiping's hardest line
 on intrabloc relations since
 Liu's denunciation of Tito nine
 years earlier.   He publicly as-
 serted that the "urgent" task was
 to oppose "revisionist deviation,"
 that maintenance df bloc unity
 was the "sacred obligation" of
 all Communist states, and that
 the Soviet party must act as
 the leader of other parties. Mao
 took the same line in private
 talks, particularly with Gomulka.
 After Mao's return and the fail-
 ure of Soviet efforts to revise
 the Yugoslav party program, the
 Chinese in May commenced their
 continuing attack on Tito and,
 indirectly, Gomulka.
 Current Relationships
 The party congress of May
 1958 well illustrated the state
 of relations  between  Mao and
 the most influential  group  of
 his lieutenants.   Mao, as   in

 September 1956,     limited his
 role to a brief speech.   The
 three major reports were given
 by  three  "organizational"
 figures whom Mao regards highly:
 Liu, Teng, and Tan Chen-lin.
 The congress named to the po-
 litburo three party leaders--
 Tan and two regional secretaries
 --who are friends of Mao and al-
 so close to Liu and Teng. Teng's
 secretariat was augmented. These
 various developments did not
 strengthen  Mao's  existing op-
 position,   but  they  did  en-
 hance the the capability of the
 "organizational" group for of-
 fering effective opposition if
 its leaders should so choose.
 Liu Shao-chi's long report
 to the congress illustrates how
 strongly he and his associates
 are committed at this time to
 a policy of supporting  Mao,
 rather  than  exploiting  Mao's
 mistakes and their own growing
 prestige and  strength  in an
 effort to  dislodge him.  For
 example,   Liu  praised Mao's
 role in Moscow, without refer-
 ence to                    Mao's  1956-57 line
 which  made  so  much  trouble
 for Moscow.  Similarly,,  Liu
 hailed  the  results  of  the
 "antirightist" campaign, with-
 out mentioning that the "hundred
 flowers" made it necessary.
 Again ?Liu denied that the eco-
 nomic planning of 1955-56 was
 significantly  in  error, blamed
 the  regime's  troubles  in
 that period on the conservatives
 --a demonstrable falsehood--and
 named  Mao  as the initiator of
 the current "leap forward." Liu
 cited Mao as the source of
 every main point of the present
 "general line" which Liu's re-
 port set forth.
 Prospects
 The prestige of Mao and
 his "organizational" lieutenants
 seems more dependent now  on
 the course  of  the "giant leap
 forward"  than  on  any other
 issue.   Liu Shao-chi  said as
 much in  his  May report,   in
 declaring  that  the  tempo
 of  economic  progress  has all
 along   been the "most important
 question" facing  the party,
 and  in pleading  for  great
 achievements in 1958,  because
 "everybody is watching."  Among
 those watching, as Liu  and
 Tan  said, are certain Chinese
 Communist leaders  who believe
 that Mao  and  those now closest
 to  him  have again  set  them-
 selves  objectives                                                               which in
 important respects  cannot be
 achieved,   and  who are waiting
 for the  autumn  harvest to
 "settle accounts."
 Even if there proves  to
 be a disastrous shortfall in
 the "leap forward,"  Mao himself
 will  probably  be saf e.   The
 strong "organizational" leaders,
 by associating themselves so
 emphatically with Mao's line on
 this  issue,  have  undercut
 any  effort  on  their  own
 part  to  unseat him  for  its
 failure.   There may, however,
 be  action by  Mao  and  Liu
 to dispose   of  their opponents
 by alleging that   they  sabo-
 taged                                                               the  "leap,"  or  an
 effort  by  other  groups to
 induce  Mao  to  make "organi-
 zational"                                                                  leaders   the scape-
 goats                                                               for  failure, or  ac-

 off    such  an. attempt. In
 sum, assuming  that  Mao  is
 not  forced  to  retire  for
 physical  reasons,  Liu  and
 Teng are     expected during 1958
 to  try to  consolidate  their
 position  as  those  most  like-
 ly                                                             to      succeed  Mao,   and
 others  are  expected        also to
 be  bidding for  Mao's  favor.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 July ,1958
 BLOC ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN AFRICA
 The bloc economic penetra-
 tion effort in Africa is pri-
 marily focused on Egypt and the
 independent nations in North
 and East Africa.   Substantial
 economic and military aid is
 being extended to Egypt, but
 elsewhere this activity is re-
 stricted to attempts at increas-
 ing trade relations.   There has
 been a gradual rise in bloc
 trade with Africa since 1955;
 in 1957 the bloc accounted for
 about 5 percent of the conti-
 nent's total world trade.
 Egypt
 Since the be-
 ginning of its eco-
 nomic offensive in
 1955, the bloc has
 concentrated heavily
 on Egypt.   Beginning
 its penetration ef-
 fort with spectacular
 "arms deals," the
 bloc  quickly  ex-
 ploited its advan-
 tage by greatly ex-
 panding trade rela-
 tions with Cairo.  In
 late 1957 and early
 1958,  the bloc con-
 cluded economic aid
 agreements which will
 serve to draw Cairo
 even closer to Mos-
 cow.
 The bloc has
 granted Egypt more
 than $250,000,000 in
 economic aid, in-
 cluding a $175,000,-
 000 line of credit
 from the USSR.   Al-
 though Cairo has not
 yet drawn on its
 count for at least 20 percent
 of the Egyptian Five-Year In-
 dustrialization Plan.  Among
 other things,  the Soviet loan
 provides for extensive voca-
 tional training in Egypt, a pro-
 gram already begun.
 The USSR also is continuing
 to grant Egyptian requests for
 military equipment to supple-
 ment the $250,000,000 worth of
 arms contracted for in 1955 and
 1956.   The amount of the addi-
 tional requests is not known,
 but probably  is  substantial
 since Moscow agreed in January
 30041
 10 JULY 1958
 Czechoslovak or East German
 credits, worth about $75,000,000,
 projects called for under the
 Soviet economic agreement are
 being implemented.   The Soviet
 loan program is heavily con-
 centrated in the fields of min-
 ing, petroleum,and metallurgy.

 military requirements.   Agree-
 ments have been negotiated in
 Moscow for delivery of such
 items as fuel, aircraft spare
 parts, ammunition, and military
 vehicles for the Egyptian Army,
 Navy, and Air Force.   In addi-
 tion,  large numbers of Egyptian
 military personnel continue to
 train in bloc countries.

 The bloc plays a dominant
 role in the Egyptian cotton mar-
 ket, the primary source of in-
 come and foreign exchange for
 Cairo, and about 57 percent of
 Egyptian sales were with the
 bloc in 1957.   About 25 percent
 of the proceeds from these ex-
 ports were used to pay for bloc
 arms purchased since 1955.
 In Libya the bloc is ap
 parently making progress through
 direct economic activities, in-
 cluding`promises of trade on
 favorable terms and the avail-
 ability of Soviet aid.   The USSR
 offered the Libyan Government
 a $28,000,000 low-interest,
 long-term loan early in 1958.
 Khrushchev reiterated this offer
 in a letter to the Libyan prime
 minister early in April, and
 serious consideration is being
 given the offer.
 The Libyan Government al-
 ready appears to have accepted
 a Soviet offer to build, equip,
 and staff two  hospitals and to
 train Libyan personnel in their
 operation.   No official  an-
 nouncement has been made, but
 re-
 cent press reports that agree-
 ment has been reached and sug-
 gests that the delay in  ac-
 ceptance resulted from the gov-
 ernment's  desire  to avoid
 damaging its position in fi-
 nancial discussions which were
 being held with  Britain and
 the United States.
 The USSR appears to have
 achieved initial success in its
 efforts to   trade with  Libya.
 According to a government of-
 ficial,  Libya has agreed  to
 permit imports from the USSR,
 thereby opening the  way for
 trade exchanges between the two
 countries for the first time.
 Cotton goods are being obtained
 at good prices, and the govern-
 ment looks with favor on Soviet
 promises to retail gasoline at
 cut-rate prices.   The govern-
 ment has also permitted the im-
 port of Soviet printing ma-
 chinery at a low price by a pro-
 Soviet Libyan publisher.   These
 moves are aimed at increasing
 Soviet respectability  in the
 eyes of the Libyans and are
 another phase in the long-term
 campaign to induce Libya to
 turn to neutralism.
 Soiiiet bloc economic rela-
 tions with Tunisia  are gradual-
 ly increasing.   Since Tunisia's
 independence in March 1956, the
 Tunisian Government has signed
 trade agreements with the USSR,
 Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria,
 and in 1958 with  Poland  and
 Hungary.   The Polish and Hun-
 garian agreements are expected
 to  increase  bloc trade  with
 Tunisia by more than 100 per-
 cent in                                                               1958  to  a total of
 about $10,000,000.
 Bloc economic activity in
 Algeria  has  been  limited  to
 trade,   which  in 1957  almost
 doubled,   increasing  to about
 $12,000,000.  The bloc has been
 rather cautious in its dealings
 with Algeria, particularly with
 regard to the sale of arms to
 dissident forces.
 In Morocco there has also
 been a gradual increase in bloc
 economic activity in the past
 few years.   Missions from the
 USSR, Poland, and Czechoslovakia
 already have been established in
 Casablanca.   Economic  activity
 has been limited to trade,   de-
 spite reports of a Czechoslovak
 offer of an ammunition factory.
 Morocco's  trade  with the bloc
 probably  will not  account for
 much more than 5 percent  of
 its total trade in 1958.
 Bloc economic activity in
 West Africa is less pronounced
 than that in the African coun-
 tries bordering the Mediterrane-
 an, although several countries

 During the 1956-57 season, the
 Soviet Union purchased almost
 $6,000,000 worth of cacao beans,
 Ghana's major export, more than
 four times its normal annual tm-

 cow was possibly prompted by a
 desire to develop its own choco-

 were also calculated to present
 the USSR to Ghana as a helpful
 friend.   However, there are no
 indications that the USSR will
 enter the cacao market on as
 large a scale this year. Ghana
 has been considering sending a

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10 July, 1958
 is being sent to Southern Rhodesia
 to:negotiate tobacco purchases.
 East Africa
 The bloc is following up
 its successes in Egypt and the
 Middle East with efforts to ex-
 pand its economic relations with
 adjacent East Africa.   It is
 showing the most interest in
 Ethiopia, the Sudan, and most
 recently Somalia, which is to
 attain independent status in
 1960.   Moscow reportedly has in.-
 formally indicated it would be
 willing to entertain applications
 from Somalia for long-term, low-
 interest credits.   At the pres-
 ent time, however, its efforts
 are concentrated on the Sudan
 and Ethiopia.
 Czechoslovakia has offered
 to supply air force equipment
 to Ethiopia, as well as to sell
 other arms at bargain prices.
 Mote recently, Moscow has offered
 to supply Ethiopia with 34 jet
 fighters and to train Ethiopian
 pilots in the USSR.
 The USSR, Czechoslovakia,
 and Bulgaria have also made of-
 fers of economic assistance--
 including expansion of hospital
 facilities and construction of
 a cement factory and a meat-
 packing plant--but practically
 no results beyond the granting
 of concessions have been
 achieved to date.
 1 percent of Ethiopian foreign
 trade.   Coffee sales to the USSR
 are a major export to the bloc.
 In 1956 Ethiopia concluded its
 only bloc trade agreement, with
 Czechoslovakia, which supplies
 the bulk of Ethiopia's imports
 from the bloc, including cotton
 goods, metal products, and other
 consumer goods.   Recently an
 Ethiopian commercial delegation
 was organized for visits to Bel-
 grade, Prague, and Moscow.
 In the summer of 1957, when
 the Sudan encountered difficulty
 in selling its cotton crop at
 prices above the world market,
 the USSR offered a package trade-
 aid deal.   The offer, while not
 spelled out, involved Soviet ac-
 ceptance of Sudanese cotton in
 payment for manufactured goods
 and for long-term loans to aid
 development of the Sudanese econ-
 omy.  The Khalil government re-
 jected the offer; subsequent
 reductions in the price of cotton
 by the government sharply in-
 creased sales to the West and
 eased the economic situation.

 extent on the intentions and
 capabilities of whatever govern-
 ment is in power in Paris.
 Institutional Developments
 Organizationally, the de-
 velopment of the new communities
 has been impressive, and all
 the important institutions have
 been functioning for some time.
 Advisory agencies, such as the
 Economic and Social Committees
 and the Monetary Committee, have
 been named, and the two most
 important operating agencies--
 the European Investment Bank
 and EURATOM's supply agency--
 are being set up.   The European
 Parliamentary Assembly--which
 also functions for the Coal-
 Steel Community (CSC)--has shown
 exceptional vitality, and ob-
 servers are encouraged by its
 organization on party, rather
 than national, lines.   It may
 also be of considerable impor-
 tance to the gradual emergence
 of a "European government" that
 the three communities are shar-
 ing certain service agencies--
 for example, in the information-
 al field.
 The major obstacle to more
 rapid organizational development
 has been the continued lack of
 decision on the site for the
 "European capital."  This inde-
 cision has caused physical incon-
 venience and encouraged national
 rivalries.   Despite agreement
 that all major community institu-
 tions should be concentrated in
 one place, the six governments
 again declined on 1 July to make
 a choice among the leading con-
 tenders--Brussels,  Strasbourg,
 and Milan.  A de facto solution
 to this problem may, however,
 be in  prospect:  many EURATOM

 they will be moved from there

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEFKLY SUMMARY
 10 July,-1958
 Commissions which, to a consid-
 erable extent, embody the supra-
 national features of both com-
 munities.   At a time when it had
 little or no technical staff and
 was further handicapped by the
 illness of President Armand, the
 EURATOM Commission, for example,
 launched the negotiations on the
 US-EURATOM joint program of nu-
 clear power development which now
 awaits approval by the US Congress.
 The advantages  of  this
 agreement to EURATOM and to the
 integration movement as a whole
 are increasingly evident.    It
 has greatly enhanced EURATOM's
 prestige and, according to Pres-
 ident Armand, gained it increased
 support from hitherto unenthusi-
 astic quarters such as the French
 atomic energy commissariat.   It
 should provide  a major stimulus
 to the launching of EURATOM's
 research program, and, in view
 of the responsibilities which
 EURATOM has assumed for the en-
 forcement of safeguards, to the
 rapid development of a security
 system in keeping with American
 standards.
 Other advantages have also
 been evident in the increasingly
 friendly attitude toward EURATOM
 in London, which along with the
 United States has not accred-
 ited its CSC mission to EURATOM
 as well.   Moreover, Britain ap-
 parently intends to  abandon
 pending bilateral agreements
 with West Germany and the Neth-
 erlands in favor of one with
 EURATOM.   Although the negotia-
 tions are. not expected to result
 in a joint program at this time,
 the proposed agreement will fa-
 cilitate commerce in nuclear ma-
 terials and reactors and con-
 stitutes an- important recogni-
 tion of EURATOM's jurisdiction.
 Common Market and GATT
 The rapid evolution of Com-
 mon Market  institutions  has
 likewise been encouraged by prob-
 lems in the  "foreign" field.
 Both the Common Market Council
 .and the commission, as well as
 the member states, were repre-
 sented, for example, at the April
 meeting of the contracting par-
 ties to the General Agreement
 on Tariffs and Trade.   It is an-
 ticipated that future negotia-
 tions of this type will be han-
 dled by the commission, subject
 to subsequent approval by the
 council.
 The importance of this de-
 velopment is evident in the in-
 fluential role  played by the
 Common Market representative at
 the April meeting in gaining
 acceptance of a compromise ar-
 rangement which averted a show-
 down on the compatibility of the
 Common Market treaty with GATT,
 avoided the  establishment  of
 GATT supervisory machinery, and
 made it possible to use existing
 machinery for consulting on fu-
 ture trade problems.   Should
 the commission carry out its in-
 tention to seek separate GATT
 representation, some of  the

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 10` July;. 1958
 difficulties which have charac-
 terized GATT-EEC relations to
 date might be eased.
 EEC and Free ..Trade, Area
 The increasing influence
 of the commission is even more
 apparent in the difficult nego-
 tiations on a mechanism to link
 the Common Market with the other
 member countries of the OEEC.
 Although other agencies and in-
 dividuals have also been work-
 ing toward a compromise, the
 commission has gradually emerged
 as the spokesman `for "the six"
 and the only real hope for a
 reconciliation of British and
 French views.
 At the same time, the com-
 mission's efforts to maintain
 the essential integrity of the
 Common Market are apparent in
 the resolution on the free trade
 area adopted by the European
 Parliamentary Assembly on 27
 June.   Suggesting the formation
 of a "European Economic Associa-
 tion," the assembly proposes
 that the necessary agreements
 be concluded "between the Euro-
 pean Communities and the other
 11 countries of the OEEC."  To
 allow time for negotiations,
 interim tariff and quota adjust-
 ments would be made next January
 by all OEEC countries.
 An arrangement such as this,
 if approved by the Common Market
 Council later this month, would
 tend to invest the commission
 with major responsibility for
 the future conduct of negotia-
 tions on the free trade area
 and, as representative of the
 Common Market "entity," give
 it a leading role in any result-
 ing association.   For negotia-
 tions, such a key role for the
 commission would have distinct
 advantages over the situation
 of the past few months in which
 the increasing isolation of the
 French has threatened the unity
 of "the six" and precluded any
 major progress.   Substantively,
 however, it is unclear whether
 the De Gaulle government is pre-
 pared to make any commitments
 regarding a free trade area,
 and there may also be reserva-
 tions from countries other than
 the six about a proposal which
 would further change the char-
 acter of the free trade area and
 fortify the Common Market as
 its center.
 Internal Problems
 On balance, the EEC's in-
 stitutions can claim less prog-
 ress in facing up to essentially
 internal problems on which the
 future of the project will great-
 ly depend.   The treaty, for ex-
 ample, left purposely vague the
 future organization of the mar-
 ket for agricultural products,
 and a conference to elaborate
 agricultural policy was to have
 been called with the coming into
 effect of the treaty.   This con-
 ference is only now taking place,
 and it is unlikely to reach ma-
 jor decisions on this delicate
 issue.
 There is reason for concern
 as well over the absence of any
 detailed policy toward restric-
 tive business practices.  The
 EEC treaty contains blanket
 prohibitions against restric-
 tive agreements and the abuse
 of monopoly positions, but there
 are important exceptions.   Pend-
 ing the development of imple-
 mentative policy, moreover, the
 member  states are obliged to
 enforce both the treaty and
 their own legislation.   So far
 as is known, the commission has
 made little if any progress to-
 ward devising enforcement machin-
 ery;; ;add,- in the meantime, re-
 ports of business consultations
 across national borders suggest
 an intent to prevent the compe-
 tition which the Common Market-
 was designed to encourage.
 France's Economic Problems
 These urgent problems, how-
 ever, have been more than over-
 shadowed by the accentuation of
 France's economic difficulties
 since last May and by the devel-
 oping prospect that France might
 be unable to afford the 10-per-
 cent tariff reduction and 20-
 percent quota enlargement sched-
 uled  'for next January.   These
 difficulties were first consid-
 ered by the Common Market Com-
 mission and council at a special

 session on 23 May.       At this
 meeting, the exchange restric-
 tions imposed by the Pflimlin
 government were approved, the
 possibility of "mutual assist-
 tance" to France was endorsed,
 and the launching of a study
 of France's longer range prob-
 lems was announced.
 This study is believed now
 in abeyance, and there is evi-
 dent hesitancy both in Paris
 and in Common Market headquar-
 ters to make decisions on meas-
 ures to cope with a crisis which
 everyone hopes will not occur.
 A French default next January
 would-be a serious blow to the
 entire integration movement,
 and, in the meantime, there is
 only small encouragement in the
 recent improvement in France's
 foreign exchange position and
 speculation that, in a crisis,
 Bonn may be willing to provide
 some financial assistance.
 There will be little dis-
 position in any case to face
 these decisions until the polit-
 ical future of France is clearer.
 On balance, the initial pessi-
 PANAMA AND THE
 Recurrent agitation among
 Panamanians for recognition of
 their country's sovereignty in
 the Canal Zone and for a larger
 share in canal income and op-
 eration has intensified since
 the seizure of the Suez Canal
 by Egypt in 1956.   Severe.db-
 mestic economic and political
 difficulties have aggravated
 this issue.   Pro-US President
 de la Guardia's position is
 not secure and he may be forced
 from office before his term
 ends in 1960.   World opinion
 is often critical of the United
 States' role on the isthmus and
 mism over'the accession of De
 Gaulle has given way to increased
 confidence, and officials of the
 three communities tend to take
 at face value De Gaulle's asser-
 tion that he will abide by ex-
 isting treaty commitments.   The
 French bureaucracy is expected
 to be difficult to deal with,
 as it has in the past, and there
 is concern over the impact on
 it of such well-known "anti-
 Europeans" as Minister of Justice
 Michel Debre.
 A frontal assault on the
 European treaties is thus not
 foreseen, but those officials
 who favor the European concept
 are fully aware that the govern-
 ments of France after De Gaulle
 will largely determine the shape
 of the European Community.   The
 Coal-Steel Community, however,
 is well-established, all three
 European treaties are highly
 favorable to France, and, in con-
 trast with the situation which
 prevailed a few years ago, the
 extent to which their procedures
 and principles have been ac-
 cepted in Paris is impressive.

 The 1903 Treaty
 The treaty signed with the
 United States soon after Panama
 declared itself independent of
 Colombia in 1903 made the new
 republic a virtual protectorate

 and control" of a ten-mile-wide
 zone bisecting the republic and
 such other lands and waters as

 were deemed necessary by the
 US for the "construction, main-
 tenance, operation, sanitation,
 and protection" of an inter-
 oceanic canal.   Within these
 areas,  Panama also granted in
 perpetuity to the US "all the
 rights, power, and authority"
 it would possess "if it were
 sovereign..  to' the efltire ex-
 clusion of the exercise by the
 Republic Of Panama of any such
 sovereign rights, power, and
 authority."  Subsequent con-
 tractual agreements on the zone
 have not substantially altered
 the basic grant.   Panama was
 paid $10,000,000 plus an an-
 nuity of $250, 000, and the United
 States guaranteed the repub-
 lic's independence and internal
 stability, reserving the right
 to intervene to maintain either.
 Treaty Revisions
 Differing interpretations
 of the 1903 treaty and frequent
 allegations of US injustices
 led in 1936 to a revised treaty
 in which the US terminated its
 protector status,   renounced
 further land acquisitions,
 agreed to restrict some com-
 mercial activities of the zone
 commissaries which the Panamani-
 ans                                        consider  competitive with

 New misunderstandings arose
 after World War II, however,
 when the United States did not
 immediately return military
 bases leased in the republic
 and asked for long-term lease
 renewals.   The chronic nation-
 alist and anti-US feelings
 aroused by the canal issue were
 exploited, particularly among

 the Panamanian National Assembly
 rejected a base agreement al-
 ready reached between the two-
 governments.   The United States
 abandoned the bases abruptly
 and Panama suffered serious
 economic dislocations.

 recently been or are about to
 be approved by the US Congress.
 Economic Factors
 Population and economic
 activity are disproportionately
 concentrated in the two termi-
 nal cities of the canal--Panama
 City and Colon.   Development
 of agriculture, industry, and
 transportation in the interior
 has been virtually ignored and
 the republic's entire economy
 is geared to the Canal Zone,.
 which provides an estimated
 40 percent of Panama's national
 income.  A small clique repre-
 senting about 5 percent of Pan-
 ama's million people controls
 the sources of economic and
 political power.   This group
 invests its funds in commercial,
 real estate, shipping registry,
 and other nonproductive but
 highly profitable businesses.
 Profits are used speculatively
 and not invested in job-produc-
 ing industries.   Thus Panama
 ranks high in Latin America in
 per capita income while most
 of its people contribute little
 to the economy and live.-in
 poverty.
 Large and potentially
 valuable agricultural areas are
 either inaccessible or left idle
 by large landholders.   About
 half of the country's population
 ekes out a subsistence as squat-
 ters living on inadequate plots
 of land.   Thus Panama is forced
 to import considerable agri-
 cultural produce and is faced
 with a resulting highly un-
 favorable trade balance when
 it could, with effective agri-
 cultural techniques and organi-
 zation, produce enough for its
 own needs and for export as well.
 Chronically high and in-
 creasing urban unemployment has
 become a potentially explosive
 socio-economic problem, posing
 a constant threat to political
 stability.   Inertia, disease,
 and lack of education or skills
 characterize the labor force
 and are used  by  the wealthy
 oligarchy as arguments against
 investment in productive eco-
 nomic development.   About 20 per-
 cent of the population are Ne-
 groes, descendants of West In-
 dians who came to build the ca-
 nal.                                                        Racial antagonisms have
 developed in the cities, where
 competition for the shrinking
 number of jobs in the zone--at
 wages about twice as high as
 for similar jobs in Panama--is
 fierce.
 The corruption pervading
 the government makes reforms
 difficult.   President de la
 Guardia has found it almost im-
 possible to implement the re-
 forms envisaged when he created
 the economic development coun-
 cil and a housing institute and
 tried to reorganize the Labor
 Ministry.   Powerful leaders of
 the oligarchy look on reform as
 a threat to their considerable
 economic interests.
 Panama's present claims
 against the United States include
 demands for 50 percent of gross
 canal revenues, which would make
 -its share about $20,000,000 an-
 nually.   The present annuity is
 about one half of net profits.
 US defense costs of $50,000,-
 000 are figured separately.   In
 1957, Panama received around
 $54,000,000 in wages to nation-
 als, purchases, and other canal-
 related income.   Its 1957 budget
 was $52,000,000.
 There is also strong na-
 tionalistic support for demands
 to fly the Panamanian flag in
 the zone in recognition of Pana-
 ma's alleged "residual" sov-
 ereignty there.   Nationalistic
 students crossed into the zone
 last May and raised numerous
 Panamanian flags to dramatize
 this demand.   Thus far, demands
 for outright nationalization of
 the canal have been infrequent.

 nationalization is desirable,
 their country  is       not  now
 equipped to handle the complex
 management and operation of
 the canal.
 International Aspects
 Student groups have sug-
 gested that Panama present its
 case for greater benefits from
 the canal to the United Nations
 Security Council, of which Pana-
 ma is a member until January
 1960.   Panama could expect
 wide support in the UN from
 both the Arab-Asian and Soviet
 blocs.   During the Suez crisis
 in 1956, the Panamanian Govern-
 ment aggressively promoted at
 home and abroad the view that
 there are important similarities
 in the two cases and that the
 status of the Panama Canal is
 also subject to change.   Panama
 will renew these tactics when-
 ever it wants to launch a cam-
 paign to wrest major concessions
 from the US.
 Sympathy for  Panama's
 claims would also be widespread
 among nationalistic  and anti-
 US groups in the rest of the
 western hemisphere and might
 influence some governments to
 support Panamanian demands. In
 addition,   many  Colombians
 still blame the   US  for  the
 loss of Panama.    Suggestions
 that the canal be internation-
 SECRET
 ized, or "inter-Americanized,"
 which have been made periodical-
 ly in Latin America, would prob-
 ably not be approved by Panama
 unless it were guaranteed a
 predominant role.   If the US
 should make further concessions,
 Panama would not want to share
 the benefits with others.
 The canal issue is an im-
 portant one in Panama's present
 unstable political situation.
 Charges that moderate, pro-US
 President  Ernesto de la Guardia
 has not  defended  Panama ' s
 "rights"   in  dealing  with the
 US  are  part  of  a virulent
 campaign to oust him now being
 waged by his powerful opponents.
 Political tension and student
 unrest are again building up
 following the lifting of the
 state of siege imposed after
 the serious rioting last May.
 Many influential politicians,
 including some cabinet members,
 now feel that De la Guardia
 cannot last out his term, which
 ends in 1960.   Further serious
 outbreaks could occur at any
 time and might involve anti-US
 incidents.   It is unlikely that
 any government resulting from a
 successful coup in the near fu-
 ture would be more friendly to
 the United States than the pres-
 ent one, and a new government
 might well be controlled by ex-
 treme nationalists                     25X1
