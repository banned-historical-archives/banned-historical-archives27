 China:   Improving Economic Performance
 Summary
 ,The Chinese economy clearly is in better shape
 today than it was just a few years ago.   Improve-
 ments are particularly evident in personal
 consumption and in agriculture.   There is a growing
 orderliness and direction in economic policy
 making.   The groundwork has been laid for closer
 economic relations with the West and China is now
 poised to resume its drive to obtain foreign
 technology.
 Reforms over the past five years are altering
 fundamental economic relationships between the
 state, the firm, and the individual.   Rapid economic
 growth, however, has laid bare the need for a
 further reform--restructuring the price system.
 Irrational pricing is mainly responsible for the
 many other difficulties that plague the Chinese
 economy--supply shortages, wasteful use of energy
 and other resources, poor output quality, burgeoning
 capital costs, diffusion of investment funds,
 growing subsidies, and'diminishing profits.
 Irrational prices and an. overvalued exchange rate
 also hamper China's integration into the world
 economy.
 National Income and Output
 China's economy had another good year in 1983, as both        25X1
 agriculture and industry continued to prosper.   Our preliminary
 estimate is that national  income grew by 7 percent (see figure
 1). 7____~
 This memorandum was produced by               of the China     25X1

 The gross value of agricultural output increased almost 5
 percent in real terms, mainly a reflection of three factors.
 First,  higher procurement prices for agricultural products
 provided. increased incentives both to state run farms and
 collectives.   Second, the dismantling of communes and expansion
 in household farming have given peasants a profit motive to
 increase production.   Finally, weather has been very favorable
 for the past three years, permitting.-bumper crops of grain and   25X1
 Industrial growth--at 10 percent--was twice that called for
 in the annual plan, as output from both light and heavy industry
 exceeded, their targets.   The resurgence of heavy industry,
 however, was worrisome to China's planners.   Since 1979, the
 Chinese have attempted to curtail  its growth in order to promote
 light industry and agriculture.   Rapid growth of heavy industry
 full throttle merely to keep pace with domestic demand.   The
 energy sector performed well  last year for the second year in a
 row.    Energy output rose more than 5 percent overall  (see
 tabulation).  But freight carried by the transport sector
 increased only 2 percent, reflecting an overburdened and
 antiquated rail,. highway, and shipping network.   While China has
 been able to obtain some short-term gains, heavy exploitation of
 Beijing attaches highest priority to developing China's
 economic infrastructure, the biggest constraint on future
 growth.   China has  had to run. the energy and transport' sectors at
 sectors and to exacerbate other existing bottlenecks..
 these sectors has resulted in a rapid depletion of capital.

 Last year Beijing had little success reining in  investment
 spending, which we estimate  increased at least 10 percent.
 Nevertheless,  in the five years since Beijing announced its
 readjustment policies,  investment spending has dropped from 35
 percent of national  income to less than 30 percent.    As a result,
 consumption, and the Chinese standard of living, has improved
 remarkably..                                                           25X1
 We estimate that in nominal terms consumer spending
 increased about 6 percent last year, roughly the same growth rate
 as incomes of urban workers.   Rural  incomes  increased 10
 percent,  but a sizable share of the increase has gone into
 savings, not consumption.   We do not know precisely how large
 these gains were in real terms because there are no accurate
 price indexes for the Chinese economy.     Nevertheless,  iflthe
 official Chinese consumer price index is used as.a guide, the
 real  increase in consumption would have amounted to about 4
 State Finance
 Stabilization and retrenchment measures were introduced by
 Beijing in late.1980, when symptoms of overheating had become
 apparent following two years of all-out economic growth.   The
 rapid and simultaneous expansion of consumption and investment
 had led to increasing pressures on resources,  resulting in
 unusually rapid price increases, a substantial budget deficit, an
 Beijing's corrective efforts in 1981 centered on a sharp cut
 in investment,  in part designed to strengthen public finances,
 and a reduction in the rate of economic?growth to a more
 sustainable level.   Initially,  this policy succeeded.   Fixed
 investment financed by the state budget dropped by 10 billion
 yuan in 1981, reducing the deficit substantially.   On the other
 hand, extrabudgetary investment--that undertaken by state            25X1
 fell only slightly.   The economy continued to overheat.
 In. the last two years,..output has grown impressively and,
 consequently, so have state revenues from industrial and
 commercial taxes.   On the other hand, state revenues from
 enterprise profits have declined.   There are two reasons for
 this.   First, with the progressive decentralization of
 decisionmaking in China, Beijing is beginning to replace the
 system of profit remittances with a system of profit taxation.
 Second, enterprise profits have fallen because of rising costs,
 1   The official consumer price  index probably understates-the
 true price increase.

 State expenditures have also crept upward since 1981.   The
 main problem has not been appropriations' for state enterprises:
 the central government's contributions to enterprises have
 declined in direct proportion to the reduction  in profit
 remittances by enterprises to the government.   Instead, most of
 the increase in government expenditures resulted from the
 increased level of subsidies, particularly for essential consumer
 goods.   These subsidies have jumped primarily because the boost
 in procurement prices for agricultural products was not matched
 byconcomittant increases  in retail prices.   Subsidies for
 foreign trade also took a leap forward in 1983, rising from 2.8
 billion yuan  in 1982 to 11 billion last year.   The foreign trade
 subsidy results from overvaluation of the yuan and the massive
 trade surplus.   Even when foreign exchange earnings are converted
 to Renminbi  (RMB) at the relatively devalued "internal
 settlement" rate,  RMB earnings from exports generally are not
 sufficient to cover production costs.   In addition, RMB earnings
 from the sale of imports on the domestic market have
 traditionally offset the subsidy. to exports., but with imports
 scaled back this no longer is..the case.    Controlling the level
 of subsidies will  remain a major problem as long as prices do not
 reflect true scarcity relationships.'                                   25X1
 The cumulative state budget deficit from 1979 to 1982
 amounted to 59 billion yuan.   Most of this was-financed by
 resorting to the printing press:  ,during the same period currency
 in circulation  increased by 58 billion yuan while Ministry of
 Finance borrowings totaled only 24 billion yuan.   Having
 experienced hyperinflation  in the late 1940s, most Chinese
 officials have been seriously alarmed by the rate of growth in
 the money supply.                                                         .  25X1
 The monetary authorities believe the two chief causes of
 this growth have been wage payments and agricultural procurement
 costs.   Wage rates have not increased substantially since 1980,
 however, the total wage bill has risen as a result of             increased
 output, higher employment, and the spread of. worker bonuses.
 harvests have driven up payments to the rural  sector.
 The government has tried to soak up excess currency by
 increasing retail sales of consumer goods.   While the growth of
 retail  sales has been excellent,  it has not kept  individual
 savings deposits from also growing at a rapid rate (see figure
 1).    If the populace should choose to draw down their savings to

 increase-consumption, they could fuel  a major round of
 inflation.
 China's central planners have attempted to prevent domestic
 economic. pressures from causing excess demand for foreign
 goods.   Nevertheless, domestic economic developments are
 transmitted, at least partially,'to the foreign sector after some
 lag.    Hence,  China's balance of payments has reflected Beijing's,
 shifting national economic policies.   Current account surpluses
 during 1976-78 gave way to deficits in 1979 and 1980, as
 deliveries began on the $10 billion worth of-complete plants and
 equipment China had ordered in 1978.   Readjustment policies
 favoring light industry and agriculture--announced in early 1979-
 -did not affect China's current account until 1981, when imports
 of capital equipment and  industrial  supplies began to subside.
 While the domestic economic recovery has been under way since
 1982,  imports began to pick up only in mid-1983.   Continuing
 export expansion and restraints on imports have given the Chinese
 three consecutive years of record trade and current account
 surpluses (see figure 2).                                           25X1
 Although the rate of growth for services has outpaced that
 of merchandise trade, expenditures have generally exceeded
 earnings.   Last year payments for industrial know-how, production
 licenses, technical services, and various forms of consultancy
 increased dramatically..  While data are difficult to obtain, we
 believe payments for such invisibles may have reached $2 billion
 in 1983.   The Chinese, are making a major effort to turn the
 deficit on services  into a surplus by expanding their
 international merchant fleet,  improving tourist facilities,  and
 boosting foreign sales of construction labor services.   In
 addition,  interest earnings on China's foreign exchange holdings
 Proceeds from the current account surplus have been used to
 lift foreign exchange reserves to record levels and to reduce
 forei3gn commercial debt.   Foreign exchange reserves, excluding
 gold   .probably exceeded $16 billion by yearend 1983, while
 China's. total foreign debt stood at $6 billion.   For the past two
 years Beijing has restructured its foreign debt by reducing
 interbank borrowings and taking on long-term low interest loans
 from the World Bank, Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation. Fund
 (OECF), and other official sources (see table 2).   Last year
 China prepaid its first credit tranche drawing from the IMF one
 year ahead of schedule, as well as almost $1 billion in
 commercial debt.   In 1984 debt servicing should amount to less
 than 5 percent of China export earnings.  I                             25X1

 China's change in status from a net debtor to a creditor
 stems both from Beijing's readjustment policy and from stringent
 foreign exchange control measures established in early 1981.   The
 decline in imports of.capital goods mainly reflects reductions  in
 investment in heavy industry..  State budget deficits have
 reinforced the cutbacks  in imports:   in some cases domestic funds
 have not been sufficient to pay for the local costs of imported
 plants.   Domestic buildups  in  inventories of steel, cotton, and
 Central regulations controlling foreign exchange have added
 to the growing trade surplus.   In January 1981 Beijing
 established an "internal  settlement" rate. of 2.8 yuan per dollar
 to be used solely for transactions between the Bank of China and
 domestic enti  ies.   This rate is more favorable than the official
 exchange rate , and hence, encourages exports and discourages
 imports.   In addition, foreign exchange controls require all
 domestic enterprises to deposit their foreign earnings with the-
 Bank of China rather than in foreign banks.   These controls
 further require that'hard currency loans to enterprises be repaid
 in. hard currency.   Imports by Chinese firms are thus  largely
 limited by the value of their own foreign exchange earnings;
 surplus foreign exchange can be sold to other enterprises, but in
 the absence of developed capital or foreign exchange markets the
 regulations help assure a trade surplus.   Although the Chinese

 Foreign Trade
 Deng Xiaoping, Zhao Ziyang, Chen Muhua and other Chinese
 .officials have. repeatedly reaffirmed China's commitment to open-
 door trade policies, despite their support for the "campaign to
 eliminate spiritual  pollution," a'campaigh which on the surface '
 appears to be a direct attack on the. cultural  influences that
 have resulted from increasing contacts with the West.   While
 warning against the potential dangers of capitalist influence,
 the leadership has  indicated it will continue to vigorously
 'expand foreign trade and to empgn investment and the
 import of foreign technology.                                           25X1
 For the second consecutive year, recession and increasing
 protectionism in the developed West have slowed the growth of
 China's exports..  Exports totaled $24 billion'in 1983, up only 2
 percent from the level  of'1982.   This is far below the 25 to 30-
 percent annual growth rates achieved from 1978 to 1981.   To
 compensate for declining exports to the developed West,  Beijing

 has tried to open up new markets in the Middle East,  Eastern
 Europe, and the Soviet Union.   In. each of the last two years,
 China has delivered over $1 billion in arms to Iraq and Iran..
 In
 as ern Europe and the USSR, t o
 Chinese have found trade partners
 that
 are
 eager to
 obtain cheap
 textiles and consumer goods that
 have
 been
 restricted in
 the
 West.   Trade with the Communist bloc  increased at least 50
 percent in 1983 and will             ably increase another 50 percent
 this year.
 Domestic shortages and weak foreign demand have hampered
 Chinese exports to the developed countries.   Exports of
 agricultural commodities, petroleum, and other raw materials have
 stagnated or declined, because of increasing demands  in China and
 decreasing prices abroad.   Petroleum exports dropped to $4.2
 billion last year, reflecting price cuts of almost 15 percent.
 The Chinese have attempted to increase export earnings from their
 manufactures by moving into higher value added lines.   Partly,
 this has been in response to volume quotas and other quantitative
 restrictions on imports from China in the West, which force the
 Chinese to export better quality, higher priced goods than they
 otherwise would.   But the. Chinese are also trying to increase
 their gains from trade by moving into exports that reflect their
 comparative advantage in labor-intensive products.   By branching
 into industries that require intensive use of manual  labor, they
 hope to absorb some of the large number of unemployed  into the
 workforce.   Disguised. unemployment among the urban labor force. of
 113 million people probably is much larger than the official
 unemployment figure of 2.6 percent reported at the end of June
 1983.                                                                25X1
 Last year imports rose almost 11 percent to $18.5 billion,
 after bottoming out in 1982.   In contrast to 1982, when
 foodstuffs--chiefly grain and sugar--were the only major category
 of imports to increase,  last year China significantly stepped up
 imports of industrial  supplies and capital goods.   Grain imports,
 on the other hand, dropped from 15 million tgns to 13 million, in
 part because of increasing supplies at home.    US sales dropped
 from 8.5 million tons in 1982 to 3.8 million last year as China
 stopped purchasing from the United States and switched to other
 Imports of most  industrial  supplies picked up substantially
 in 1983,  reflecting' the increase in domestic economic activity
 and growing domestic shortages.   Steel  imports nearly doubled to
 10 million metric tons as China surpassed the United States as
 Japan's number one customer.   Imports of copper, aluminum, nickel
 and zinc also showed substantial gains.   Record imports of logs

 ton increase over 1982.                                            25X1

 and plywood reflected the speedup in Chinese construction
 activities:  Cotton and synthetic.textile fiber imports continued
 to slump, however, as domestic-Output and inventories climbed.
 The United States was one of the few countries that did not
 benefit from China's increased purchases of industrial sup lies
 perhaps the result of an exceptionally' strong US dollar.
 Recovery of investment in China has. resulted in a resurgence
 of capital equipment imports, which increased to well over $4
 billion last year, up 10.to 20 percent over 1982.   Transportation
 equipment, especially, had a banner year, and this resulted in an
 upturn in US sales of aircraft and truck's.   US exports of
 computers, telecommunications equipment, machine tools,
 electronic medical equipment, and heavy construction equipment
 also benefitted.   Associated with the jump in capital equipment
 purchases has been a Chinese push to obtain pure technology.   In
 the past year the Chinese purchased know-how in.such diverse
 areas as:   tree cultivation,..insecticide chemistry, water
 control, food preservation, coal excavation.and gasification,
 building materials research,  iron ore dressing,  large integrated
 Beijing's past progress in attracting foreign investment has
 been slow,  in part, because. of an uncertain commitment among
 Chinese leaders and planners on the extent of incentives that
 should_be* offered. to foreign companies.   Other obstacles  included
 China"s inexperience,  its-need to' develop credibility in
 relationships' with foreign businessmen,  its lack of adequate
 infrastructure, problems with labor productivity and wages, and
 the lack of detailed regulations on taxes and remittance of
 profits.                                                               25X1
 Last year, however, Beijing made a range of concessions  in a
 bid to gain foreign participation?in modernizing the economy.
 Scores of new laws have been released to' attract or protect the
 foreign investor.   In September, China issued regulations to
 clarify its 1979 Joint Venture law.   The rules offered longer tax
 holidays,  increased opportunities to sell the output of the
 venture in the domestic Chinese market, and more decision-making
 autonomy for the venture.   Early this year China introduced new
 tax rules that exempt joint ventures from import duties and
 abolish certain industrial  taxes on ventures that import advanced
 machinery and technology.   Later this year the.National  People's
 Congress is slated-to pass laws approved by the State Council
 that will clarify the                     totally foreign owned
 companies in China.                                                  25X1

 At the end of 1983 there were approxirgatley 150 "equity" and
 500 "contractual" joint ventures in China.   We estimate that at
 yearend 1983, total paid-in foreign  investment amounted to
 approximately $1.2 billion..  Of that total about $380 million is
 located in the four Special Economic i Zones. with the bulk in      25X1
 Shenzhen, on the Hong Kong border.
 As of this past November, American investors had spent $406
 million on 23 joint project  in China.   There were 16 equity joint
 ventures  involving $91 million, one $10 million cooperative
 management project, and five agreements for joint exploitation of
 offshore oil worth a total of more than $304 million.   The three
 largest non-oil Sino-American joint ventures are the Great Wall
 Hotel with capital assets of $35 million, the Jianguo Hotel with
 assets of $11 million, and American Motors'  Beijing Jeep          25X1
 Corporation with $16 million in assets.
 China's competitive offshore leasing program got under way
 last year with signings of exploration and development contracts
 by 27 foreign oil companies, including 10 US firms.  Drilling
 will begin this year on most of the blocks, which are located in
 the Yellow and South China Seas.   The foreign companies will sink
 at least  500 million into these wells within the next three
 years.                                                                25X1
 Exploration work continued last year in offshore areas
 previously leased to Japanese, French, and US firms.   The
 Japanese have had success exploring in the Bohai  and will
 probably soon begin development of at least one field..  Atlantic
 Richfield may have found a commercially viable., natural gas field
 in its concession south of Haitian, but the discovery was marred
 6  From a Western viewpoint, both forms of joint ventures are
 considered direct foreign  investment.   Other forms of business
 arrangements,  such as processing-and compensation agreements,  are
 not treated as foreign  investment since no foreign clajms on real
 assets located in China exists.   The Chinese., however, use the
 term "foreign  investment" loosely to refer to all  forms of
 foreign participation, even including loans to Chinese
 enterprises.   .The Chinese appear to use the term "cooperative
 production agreement" synonymously with contractual joint
 ,venture.   From a Chinese legal viewpoint there are three chief
 distinctions between contractual  and equity joint ventures.
 Equity joint ventures:
 (1)    fall under the Joint Venture Tax law (a flat 33 percent
 tax), whereas contractual ventures are taxed on a graduated
 basis under the Foreign Enterprise Income Tax;
 (2)    share profits  in proportion to equity participation, whereas
 contractual joint ventures share profits according to a
 ratio agreed to in the contract;
 (3)    form new legal entities with their own boards of directors,
 whereas contractual joint ventures are managed directly by
 their parent corporations.

 The Chinese have also signed preliminary agreements with
 foreign investors for the Guangdong nuclear power plant and for
 development of the Pingsuo open pit coal mine.   Difficult issues
 must be worked out before any final contracts are signed,
 however, and there is no assurance of succesr deal could
 result in large sales to China by.US firms.
 Foreign Debt
 The Chinese have used very little of the $27 billion in
 commercial and government-supported credit lines they arranged  in
 1.979 (see table 2).   Fiscal conservatism and cutbacks in capital
 expenditures, rather than the previous  ideological aversion to
 foreign debt,  have left little need for these loans.                '25X1
 China's current outstanding debt of $6 billion is a mixture
 of commercial and official  loans, with a wide range of
 maturities.   For the past two years commercial borrowing has been
 cut back sharply and it now accounts for less than half of total
 .debt. China now seeks only concessionary loans and: will avoid
 incurring commercial        for all but short-term trade
 financing.                                                     I      25X1
 During 1983 Beijing and'Tokyo concluded an agreement
 extending an additional $2 billion in Overseas Economic
 Cooperation Fund loans to cover seven major development projects
 in China,  including,three ports,-two railroads, a hydroelectric
 power station, and the.-Tianjin-Shanghai-Guangzhou telephone
 network.   The loans can be drawn.'over the next five years, carry
 a 3.5-percent interest. rate, and allow repayments over 20 years,
 following,a 10-year grace period.   The Chinese have also obtained
 commitments for over $1.1 billion from the World Bank, half of
 which is to come from IDA reflows.   Funds have also been received
 from the UN's Development Program and Food and Agricultural
 Organization.   While these funds might appear at first glance to
 "crowd out" commercial  lending, this probably.is not the case,
 since most of the projects covered by them would not be"

 1/      With some significant exceptions, noted below, most of the
 individual  line items  in this presentation are obtained
 from the IMF staff reports on the 1982 an 1983 Article IV
 consultations with China, and:their annexes.  A major
 conceptual difficulty in preparing a balance of payments
 for China is the lack of a clear demarcation between the
 monetary and nonmonetary authorities.   In keeping with
 standard IMF methodology, the Fund has excluded changes  in
 assets and liabilities of foreign branches of the Bank of
 China from its data.   External gold transactions by the
 Bank of Chinaare totally missing,  in part, for this reason
 (see footnote 18 below)..  Similarly, no clear distinction
 is possible between state and private transactions.
 Economic reforms of the.past four years have created both a
 large semi-official  sector and'a small but growing private
 sector for which the central government no longer considers
 2/      The trade data in this presentation ar     tim t d from the  25X1
 statistics of China's trade partners
 There are significant discrepancies between C inesE25X1
 a a, compiled by the Ministry of Foreign Economic
 Relations and Trade (MFERT), and the official statistics of25X1
 China's trade partners., We believe most of these can be
 attributed to differences between Western and Chinese
 accounting practices with regard to the categories, of goods
 excluded or included in the trade statistics,  the boundary
 of the Chinese statistical territory, valuation procedures,
 time periods to which..the statistics relate, and
 definitions of countries to which trade is attributed.
 Data for trade partner. exports to China are recorded at the
 time payments are made or (in lieu of cash payments)
 credits are drawn, and thus coincide with the Bank of
 China's payment data more closely than the MFERT data,
 which are recorded when the goods clear customs in'China.
 Perhaps the major reason for. the difference between the
 BOC's import data and trade partner's export data is the
 inclusion of technology and other invisibles in the
 former:   the BOC probably, cannot distinguish between
 payments for hard capital goods, which show up in. the trade25X1
 partner data, and payments for related services..
 3/     A Chinese deficit on freight and insurance appears
 difficult to reconcile with the Chinese claim that they
 carry over 70 percent of their foreign trade in Chinese
 ships.   Moreover, the 13.5 million deadweight tons worth of
 ships  in the Chinese fleet should be capable of carrying'
 that much cargo.   It is possible that the Chinese claim
 includes 'ships on time charter and th         Chinese fleet.
 is. operated very inefficiently.

 4/      We estimate that at the end of 1982, Chinese investments
 abroad were worth at least $1,050 million, most of which is
 located in Hong Kong.        Return on equity is estimated as 10
 percent.  We believe. virtually all of these earnings are
 re-invested abroad.          (Less than $1 million was repatriated
 in 1980).  A counterpart        appears separately in the
 capital account.             u
 5/     The data reported to the IMF appear to be far too low,
 especially for the period 1979-81, when thousands of
 Chinese trade delegations went abroad in search of Western
 6/
 technology.   No adjustments to the IMF data have been made,
 Chinese tax laws make it difficult for the
 foreign investor
 to repatriate capital  in the early years of
 an
 invest-
 ment.   Hence we believe most o
 f
 for
 1980-82
 have been reinvested in China.
 7/     Estimated as the difference. between BOC's data for imports
 and trade partner data for exports to Chiha.   The levels
 appear to be consistent with the total value of whole
 plants contracted fnr  diirino  this period,  less hard capital
 8/     The division between long-and short-term capital  is only
 approximate; especially for supplier credits.   The IMF made
 estimates for short-term bank borrowings from gross flow
 data provided.by the BOC.   We believe that the stock of
 short-term bank  assets and liabilities at the end of 1981,
 each amounted to perhaps $1-1.5 billion.                      25X1
 9/     This item includes some World Bank bonds and bonds issued
 by foreign countries, purchased by the BOC.   Although
 approval was given for certain Chinese entities to issue
 bonds abroad durin   1981. no bonds were actually floated
 until 1982.                                                       25X1
 10/    Consists of credits from Belgium and Ja  n and credits from
 international financial institutions.                             25X1
 11/    Buyer credits refer to drawings by Chinese entities
 directly from foreign banks.   In contrast, the Chinese use
 the term "deferred payments" to refer to supplier credits--   25X1
 be refinanced by the foreign supplier with his bank.
 12/    Includes estimated credits from the Australian and Canadian
 Wheat Boards for financing of Chinese grain purchases.   In
 1981 the Chinese began paying cash for these purchases for
 the first time since 1961.   Hence,  in that year there      a
 significant net debit for supplier credits.                     25X1

 13/    Refers to credits for imported equipment and working
 capital under processing, assembling, and compensation
 agreements due to be repaid by the export of the product of
 the venture.   This activity only started in 1980, although
 there may have been a ver  small volume of such
 transactions in 1979.                                          25X1
 14/    "Non-BOC borrowings" refers to direct borrowing abroad by
 provinces,  localities  and domestic enterprises--not
 through the BOC.                                               25X1
 15/    Although Chinese law permitted foreigner's to maintain
 accounts with the BOC beginning in 1980, this jump in
 foreign deposits, which the Ministry of Finance reported to
 16/    These loans consist primarily of long-term low interest aid
 to LDCs.   Grants are covered under unrequited transfers.      I

 During 1981 and 1982 China pre-paid $800 million and $1,100 million in loans, respectively, which
 accounts for the abnormally large increase in debt-servicing.     Excluding these prepayments China's debt
 service ratio (to exports) amounted to 8.6% and 5.5%, respectively.
