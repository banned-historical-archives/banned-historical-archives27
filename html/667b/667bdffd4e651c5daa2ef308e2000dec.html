THE UBIQUITOUS KGB  
"At the rate KGB agents are flowing back to the motherland," 
quipped one magazine, "Mbscow's perennial housing shortage may 
soon become critical." In September Oleg Lyalin, member of the 
Soviet Trade Mission in London exposed the espionage activities, 
including plans for sabotage, that sent packing 105 Soviet officials. 
Then, early in October Anatole Chebotarev, a reputed friend of 
Lyalin's and a member of the Soviet Trade Mission in Brussels, 
first disappeared and then five days later surfaced in England to 
give Western intelligence officers a list of KGB and GRU (special 
military espionage) agents operating out of Brussels. By mid-month, 
the Belgian Foreign Ministry announced that, as a result of 
Chebotarev's revelations, Soviet officials would be quietly 
expelled. 
In England, Lyalin exposed and Her Majesty's Government 
expelled, officials in just about every phase of Soviet activity 
in that country: the Embassy, Trade MiSsion, Inturist Travel Agency, 
Moscow Narodny Bank of London, Sovexportfilm, and other commercial 
organizations. In Belgium, NATO circles have confirmed that 
Chebotarev and his former coworkers from the Trade Mission and 
such commercial organizations as Sovflot, Aeroflot, SovexportfiIm, 
the Scaldia-Volga (a Soviet-Belgian "joint venture" enterprise) auto 
plant, Belso, etc., were snooping around NATO in Brussels and the 
headquarters of SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in 
Europe) in Casteau, near Mons. At this writing, it is thought 
that, on the basis of information from Chebotarev, The Hague 
might act to put an end to Soviet espionage activities in 
BrunssuM, The Netherlands, where AFCENT (Allied Forces in 
Central Europe) is based. 
The decisions to go ahead with the recent mass evictions of 
Soviet officials from London with a blast of trumpets instead of 
removing them quietly a few at a time, was undoubtedly taken in 
the hope that this would shock the Soviets into behaving less 
presumptuously. Britain had already announced the expulsion of 
three Soviet spies earlier in the year.* And, according to the 
London Daily Telegraph of 21 April 1971, the year before Britain 
had demanded the witrndrawal of seven Soviet diplomats (one from 
the Embassy and six from the Trade Mission) and had refused to 
*Daily Telegraph, London, of 22 and 23 June carried articles 
describing the expulsion of three Soviet diplomats: 
Dmitriy.Sorokin, Lev SherStnev, and Valeriy Chusovitin.

Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
accept ten others (four for the Embassy and six for the Trade 
Mission). The expelled diplomats were thought to have been 
after industrial rather than military secrets and the ten 
refused admittance were suspected of having similar missions. 
Their exclusion was a clear signal to Moscow that British 
security services were not only alert to the activities of Soviet 
officials already in London, but also that they had dossiers on 
other Soviet officials being groomed for espionage of one kind or 
another. In Moscow, the signal was either ignored or misinterpreted. 
Many Western government officials have expressed the opinion 
that Soviet espionage activity in Western Europe was increasing in 
direct proportion to the USSR's growing economic involvement with 
that area and its stepped-up propaganda and political action pro-
grams in support of the Soviet version of "European Security." 
The September and October revelations cannot help but bolster 
this argument. Nevertheless, based on other instances of ex-
pulsions announced so far this year, Soviet spying and subversion-
fomenting on a world-wide scale has not been curtailed because of 
the KGB's stepped-up activities in Western Europe. 
Signals from Kinshasa's General Mobutu have also been 
misread in Moscow. Soviet meddling in internal Congolese affairs 
has already twice caused the Congo to sever diplomatic 
relations with the USSR. Yet, again this year General Mobutu was 
forced to take action: in mid-July some 20 diplomats and non-
diplomatic staff members of the Soviet, Czechoslovak, Polish and 
other East Bloc foreign missions were expelled because of their 
suspected involvement in the June Kinshasa University disorders 
that eventually resulted in mass arrests and the temporary shut-
down of the university. The existence of a subversive student 
network and the role of European Communist functionaries in 
fomenting trouble within them were revealed by Agence CongOlaise de  
Presse on 5 August, but the names of those expelled were not 
revealed. 
Accra still remembers Soviet Embassy influence over former 
Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah and how the only opposition 
to the coup of February 1966 --- which was staged largely to 
prevent any increase of that influence --- came from the 
Soviet-trained Presidential Guard that had been set up outside of 
army control. Twenty members of the Soviet Embassy were then 
expelled along with nearly 1,000 Soviet technicians and their 
dependents. In 1967, Ghana was forced to expel two Soviet press 
representatives from Novosti and Pravda because they were 
"committing slanderous propaganda�TOariSt the country" and 
working to get Nkrumah back in power.

This year, so far, the Government of Ghana has again been 
driven to the extreme measure of ousting two Soviet diplomats. 
The first deportee was Embassy Counselor Valter Vinogradov who 
was apprehended in Accra with cabinet documents in his pocket. 
After much diplomatic bargaining, the Ghanaian Foreign Ministry 
agreed not to publicize the Vinogradov case in exchange for the 
Soviet Ambassador's pledge that his staff would refrain from 
further subversion in Ghana. However, as the Accra Daily  
da
gger 
episode hicreported on 23 July, "before this cloak and  
episo e:could be buried," another Soviet spy, Trade Mission 
official Gennadiy Potemkin had been caught red-handed with 
secret documents ferreted out of special branch files. 
Although Potemkin was not a diplomat, he was using a diplomatic 
car at the time of his arrest and at first claimed diplomatic 
immunity, giving his name as Butsan. Potemkin had a diplomatic 
identity card in the name of Anatoliy Butsan, who left Ghana in 
1966 and who had been deported from the Congo in 1963. 
In: late July the Sudanese Communist Party, evidently with 
the advice and support of Soviet officials, staged a coup against 
the Numairy regime. After being restored to power, Numairy had 
the chief plotters, including the leaders of the Sudanese 
Communist Party arrested, courtmartialed and executed. Some 
1,500 Communists reportedly were arrested. In the face of 
harsh Criticism of the purge by the Soviet press, the Numairy regime 
charged the Soviets with complicity and expelled the Soviet 
Ambassador, Anatoliy Nikolayev and Embassy Counselor Mikhail 
Orlov. . Nikolayev was reportedly the only foreign envoy to have 
met with the coup plotters during the brief period that they were 
in power and Orlov was charged with contacting the local 
Communists who staged the coup. 
During March the Government of Mexico expelled five Soviet 
diplomats involved in training students in guerrilla warfare. 
They were Minister-Counselor and Charge d'Affaires Dmitriy A. 
Dyakonov, First Secretary Boris Kolomyakov, Second Secretary 
Oleg M. Nechiporenko, and member of the Soviet Commercial Office 
Aleksandr V. Bolshakov. On 15 March just preceding the govern-
ment's:expulsion action, Mexico's Attorney General Sanchez 
Vargas announced that the Mexican police had broken up a Communist 
plot against the government and had arrested 19 terrorists at 
"guerrilla acadepies" and hideouts. The Mexican students had 
been sent to East Germany and the Soviet Union and from there 
to a military base in North Korea for training in sabotage 
and terrorism. Some had received scholarships to Patrice 
Lumumba University under the Mexican-Soviet cultural exchange 
program. Soviet involvement in this case is vividly told by John 
Barron in "The Soviet Plot to Destroy Mexico," Readers Digest, 
November 1971.

In Ecuador it did not take long for the heavy hand of Soviet 
subversion to reveal itself following the establishment of 
Soviet-Ecuadorian diplomatic relations in June 1970. By July of 
the next year, the Government of Ecuador had to expel three Soviets 
"for interference in internal affairs." They were: Embassy 
Counselor Anatoliy M. Shadrin and Embassy First Secretary, 
Robespier N. Filatov, both of whom left Ecuador on, 6 July. The 
Third, Soviet Permanent Trade Mission Chief Economist Valentin 
A. Gbluzin, was on home leave at the time and was not permitted 
to return. Following the announcement of the government's ex-
pulsion action, Guayaquil daily El UniVerso reported that the 
government had proof that the Soviet intelligence officials 
had financed a strike planned by the Confederation of Ecuadorian 
Workers (GTE), with the objective of bringing down the Government 
of President Jose Maria Velasco Ibarra and replacing it with 
a left-wing military dictatorship0 It was revealed that the 
Soviets had passed money to the GTE through Jose Solis, 
correspondent of TASS news agency in Guayaquil. 
In Italy, Milan's Corriere Della Sera of 5 September 1971, 
reported that the Soviet Commercial Attache in Rome, Ilya 
Butakov, had been quietly expelled from Italy three months 
previously. After his departure, security officials had found 
out that Butakov was a missile expert who had been sent to Italy 
to gather data on electronic systems in missiles and tanks. 
Earlier in the year, the 19 February issues of Rome dailies Il 
Tempo and Messaggero carried the announcement that Italian 
security police had uncovered evidence that Valenin P. Kovanov, 
Soviet Embassy First Secretary, was involved in espionage activities. 
Kovanov had been officially expelled two days before. 
Thus, as of the end of October, close to 200 Soviet agents have 
been sent home this year to face the wrath of KGB Chief YUriy 
Andropov, who in turn must face the wrath of his chiefs on the 
Politburo. The London spy purge, of course, has been the most 
devastating for the Kremlin with other West European actions coming 
in a very close second. There will be an element of calculation 
in whatever the Kremlin decides to do in retaliation -- but the 
overriding objective will be to try to sow dissension among 
Western allies. Brezhnev's almost obsessive interest in the 
projected European security conference suggests that reprisals 
against West Europeans will not be on a scale to prejudice this 
pet objective. Reprisals elesewhere would be minimal -- Moscow 
risks losing too much if London's "spy purge" becomes too 
popular a diplomatic gambit. The way, of course, for the Soviets 
to keep expulsions at a minimum is simply to voluntarily trim their 
representations down to acceptable size. Of course, to Yuriy 
Andropov, espionage is an end in itself -- and, in the long run, 
Soviet reaction is going to hinge on how firmly Brezhnev can talk 
to Andropov.

THE RUSSIAN SECRET POLICE, Excerpts 
Ronald. Hingley 
Hutchinson & Company, LTD 
178-202 Great Portland Street, London' 
Late 1964. saw an important change in the public posture of the 
KGB as the organisation embarked on an intensified publicity 
campaign designed to glorify exploits hitherto shrouded in secrecy. 
This involved advertising the deeds of Soviet spies who had so far 
rated as unspies�as when, for instance, the British defectors 
Burgess and Maclean had been paraded (in 1956) to proclaim in 
all solemnity that they had never engaged in espionage.1 Now, 
twenty years after his execution by the Japanese, the Soviet 
master-spy Richard Sorge had his cover blown by the Soviet 
advertising machine and was posthumously created a Hero of the 
Soviet Union for his wartirne and pre-war spying exploits. He also 
had a tanker and a Moscow street named after him, and appeared 
full-face on a new four-copeck stamp specially designed in his 
honour.2 Thus, from having no spies at all, the Soviet Union 
suddenly turned out to have the best spies in the world, no doubt 
as part of a campaign to encourage Soviet agents still in the field 
after their morale had been shattered by the revelation of Pen-
kovsky's revelations, as also by the arrest of their colleagues George 
Blake and Gordon Lonsdale in England, and of Stif Wennerstrom 
in Sweden. Another Soviet hero-spy was acknowledged when 
Chairman Semichastny wrote in honour of Colonel Rudolf Abel 
in Pravda of 7 May 1965�the first occasion on which Abel was 
officially honoured, an exchange having been effected between 
him and the American U2 pilot Gary Powers in 1961. 
Another exchanged Soviet spy, Colonel Konon Molody alias 
Gordon Lonsdalc, published a book in English, Spy, about his 
professional activities after an unsuccessful attempt had allegedly 
been made to trade two British-held Soviet spies, the Krogcrs, for 
_ a promise to withhold these inflammatory memoirs from publica-
tion.2 Lonsdales.crudely propagandistic saga has a certain import-
ance as the first example of such material emanating from an 
avowed Soviet agent. That the entire text has been KGB-vetted 
may be inferred, and it need hardly be said that the material must 
be treated with caution. The same is true of My Silent War, the 
more polished memoirs of the formerly English Soviet intelligence 
agent Kim Philby. These received publication in 1968, five years 
after the author had obtained political asylum in the USSR and 
Soviet citizenship, as announced in Izvestiya on 31 July 1963. On

1 9 December 1067 the same newspaper published an article 
`Hello, Comrade Philby', quoting the veteran master-spy in praise 
of Dzerzhinsky as a 'great humanist'�the formula commonly 
applied in Soviet parlance to successful sponsors of mass killings. 
Philby's views on his own former chiefs MenZhinsky, Yagoda, 
Yczhov and Bcria arc unfortunately not available. They would 
have been particularly valuable in the light of. certain circum-
stalces outlined in earlier chapters, for it was at about the time of 
Philby's original recruitment that his ultimate superior Yagoda 
was, according to official Soviet record, engaged in murdering or 
attempting to murder Menzhinsky and Yezhov, his immediate pre-
cursor and follower as security police, overlords. Meanwhile the 
future police chief Bcria was (again .cording to official doctrine) 
secretly in league with Britain�the very country which his under-
ling, the still youthful Philby, had so blithely congratulated him-
self on betraying. In this context Philby's comment on his reason 
for enlisting as a Soviet intelligence- agent (`One .does not look 
twice at an offer of enrolment in an dlite force') 4 seems to carry a 
certain pungency all of its own. 
13e that as h: may, the main purpose of the new publicity given to 
Philby and to the KGB in general was to demoralise and intimi-
date the non-Communist world by creating the impression of an 
'ubiquitous KGB man. . . dedicated servant of an international 
government', who 'moves like a superior being, irresistible, among 
the ill-guarded, guilty secrets of the divided West'. In this cam-
paign by the KGB various 'capitalist' newspapers showed an 
eagerness to co-operate which appeared to confirm Soviet claims 
of western decadence in an alarming degree. 
The iz-vest/ya interview with Philby formed only a small part of 
elaborate celebrations staged on and about 20 December 1967 in 
honour of the Soviet security machine's fiftieth birthday. Along 
with eminent spies, domestic agents too were honoured, including 
four elderly Chekists�survivors of the anti-Leninist White Terror, 
as also of the Stalinist great terror in which so many of their 
colleagues had fallt!.n. Probably selected for their benevolent facial 
expressions, thes3 former hunters of Bruce Lockhart and Boris 
Savinkov beam down like elderly uncles from the pages of Pravda 
as if in assurance that all is for the best in the best of all possible 
worlds. So much for the small fry. On a more august level the 
crowning point of the KGB's jubilee was a speech by Chairman 
And ropov in the presence of Politburo-members, including 
Shelepin and other notabilities. Shelepin. received no personal 
tribute in Andropov's speech. Nor was any other head of the

security machine so honoured, excepting only the organisation's 
first: two chiefs: Dzerzhinsky and Mcnzhinsky, the saintly and the 
unobtrusive Pole. Thus Yagoda, Yezhov and Beria were passed 
over in silence apart from an oracular reference to political adven-
turers in the NKVD who had once committed unlawful acts, 
attempting to remove the State security agencies from the Party's 
control. In stressing the primacy of Party over police, Andropov's 
statement was especially typical of post-Bcria etiquette for KGB 
Chairmen. Characteristic too was the devotional language in r 
which Andropov referred to the typical Chekist as `a man of pure 
honesty and enormous personal courage, implacable in the 
struggle against enemies, stern in the name of duty, humane and 
prepared to sacrifice himself for the people's cause. Such was the 
post-Stalinist projection of the KGB officer�that of a jovial padre 
with a core of steel, an image reinforced by the numerous hagio-
graphies of the butcher Dzerzhinsky which began to flood the 
presses. � 
In the summer of 1969 the KGB brought off yet another notable 
coup by prevailing on the British government to exchange the 
Krogers (Soviet spies who had received long prison sentences in 
Great Britain in 1961 for their part in the Portland Case) for a 
British lecturer in Russian, Mr Gerald Brooke, who had been 
condemned to five years' imprisonment in 1965 by a Moscow 
court for anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda. Since his release 
from the Soviet Union Mr Brooke has published newspaper 
_ _ 
articles describing how his arrest and trial came about.21 At the 
behest of NTS, the Russian anti-Soviet organisation of which men-
tion has been made above, he had smuggled into the Soviet Union 
certain material concealed in a photographic album and dressing-
case. He was, accordingly, guilty as charged, though the possi-
bility cannot be discounted that the mysterious 'George' (who 
had. recruited him to carry this compromising material to Russia 
in the first place) was an agent provocateur acting on behalf of the 
KGB. Be that as it may, the KGB appears to have set itself from 
the start to usc Brooke as a human lever to extort the release of 
thc Krogcrs. As part of this campaign he was deliberately pro-
duced in emaciated condition during one of his wife's visits, and 
was also prevailed upon by his captors to write to some London 
newspapers urging the Krogers' release in exchange for his own. 
When these tactics failed, the prisoner was threatened with -a new 
trial on the more serious charge of espionage. He was informed 
that this would be backed in court by the evidence of the formerly 
English KGB spy Philby (now resident in Moscow), who would 
testify that the NTS was in the pay of British intelligence. These 
newly concocted espionage activities related to conversations be-

twcen Brooke and certain other prisoners in a concentration camp 
sick-bay at Potma. Here he was surrounded by other patients who 
paraded anti-Soviet views, but who appear from his own descrip-
tion to have been agents provocateurs, even though he himself appar-
ently did not recognise them as such. Had the Soviet authorities 
persisted with the new charge of espionage, Mr Brooke could con-
ceivably have faced a death sentence. In the end, however, the 
British government capitulated to this long sequence of threats 
from the KGB by agreeing to release the Krogcrs. Right or wrong, 
the decision would appear to put all British visitors to the Soviet 
Union at hazard during the foreseeable future. So far as the history 
of the KGB is concerned, the episode is an instructive illustration 
of the extraVagant lengths to which the organisation will go to 
rescue its agents from foreign imprisonment. 
Valuable further confirmation of certain features in KGB 
methodology .is provided by a recent defector to the West, 
Anatoly Kuzrietsov. On 24 July 1969 this well-known Soviet 
novelist happened to travel from Moscow to London in the same 
plane as the released Gerald Brooke. On arrival he eluded the 
personal escort provided by the Soviet authorities, sought refuge 
with a leading British daily newspaper, proclaimed his intention 
of emigrating from the Soviet Union and published articles in the 
British press describing the particularly close surveillance which 
the Soviet political police maintains over all Soviet writers. n his 
own case this had included ostentatious shadowing by agents, the 
bugging of his fiat, the recording of his telephone conversations 
and sundry attempts at 'provocation'. On one occasion a certain 
student had sought him out and delivered a tirade against the 
Soviet Union, describing it as a Fascist country, after which Mr 
Kuznetsov found himself in trouble for failing to report the inci-
dent to the authorities. On another occasion a young woman in-
formed him that she had been instructed to become his mistress, 
and to report all his activities on pain of expulsion from the insti-
tute at which she was studying. Kuznetsov also confirms many 
accounts by previous Soviet defectors when .he speaks of the pro-
longed and elaborate vetting process to which all Soviet citizens 
are subjected before receiving the rare and coveted privilege of 
foreign travel. Out of every fifteen members of one Soviet 'delega-
tion' on which he had travelled, at least five were under KGB in-
structions to report on the other members' behaviour, apart from 
which each member of the party was obliged to supply a political 
report on himself and his fellow-travellers. Kuznetsov also des-
cribes how he had compromised himself in various ways in the 
past by failure to co-operate fully with the KGB,, but had then 
decided to work his passage back by simulating a degree of docility 
sufficient to qualify him for an exit visa. He had therefore pan-

&red to official conspiracy-mania by inventing an imaginary plot 
by Certain fellow-writers to bring out a new clandestine literary 
journal, and had then clinched his return to favour by promising' 
to write a novel about Lenin.23 Such methods finally took him to 
London and put him in a position to start a new career as an 
dmigrd writer. 
The tactics employed by Mr Kuznetsov to effect his escape have 
incurred sporadic criticism from-Western writers not themselves 
subject to comparable pressures�an example of self-righteous 
censoriousness such as is all too easily engendered in societies free 
from totalitarian police control. So far as the present study is con-
cerned, Mr Kuznetsov can only be saluted for his success in extri-
cating himself from the long line of literary victims of the Russian 
political police�the list which also includes such illustrious names 
as Alexander Radishchev, Alexander Pushkin, Nicholas Cherny-
shevsky, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Isaac Babel, Osip 
� Mandelshtam, Boris Pasternak and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. 
As is stressed by Vladimir Nabokov, himself in youth a potential 
victim of Russian police terror, Russian history can be considered 
from two points of view: 'first, as the evolution of the police . . . 
and second, as the development of a marvellous culture.'" That 
these strands arc intimately intertwined, and that the second can-
not be understood without an appreciation of the first, was one 
reason for attempting the study now concluded. Though its pur-
pose has been to record the past, one prediction of the future may 
be risked as a parting word: that between the completion of this 
book and its appearance in print new scandals will have further 
enriched the annals of the developing Russian political police. 
That the final epitaph of this gigantic and historic organisation 
will not be written by anyone now living also seems probable. 
Conclusion 
In the foregoing pages an attempt has been made to describe the 
operations of Russian political security organisations while quot-
ing sources of information in detail, as is particularly desirable in 
a field of study so riddled with obscurities and difficulties of various 
, kinds. An attempt will now be made to sum up certain aspects of 
the material in a manner somewhat more speculative and wide-
ranging. This discussion will take the form of a general comparison 
between the two main historical phases concerned: the Imperial 
and the Soviet. 
One striking difference between the imperial and Soviet secret 
police lies in the size of the organisations concerned, in the num-
ber of personnel involved, and in the extent of resources allotted 
to political security operations. During the centuries the Russian 
secret police has expanded from relatively tiny beginnings until it 
has come to swamp and penetrate every corner of society�
possibly the most impressive example of the working of 'Parkin-
son's Law' on record. Of all the organisations concerned, Peter the 
Grcat's Preobrazhensky Office�perhaps the first true Russian 
political security force�holds pride of place for the economic and 
efficient use of resources. As stated above, it conducted political 
security operations throughout late Muscovy and in the first 
5

_ Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
years of Imperial Russia with a strength of less than a dozen clerks, 
though admittedly military units�the Preobrazhensky and Sern-
yonovsky Guards-could bc co-opted to an unlimited extent to 
effect arrests and act as couriers. Since then a gradual but inexor-
ably sustained expansion in security personnel has been observed. 
In the late eighteenth century perhaps only a few dozen or score 
were so employed, but under Nicholas I the figure soared to some 
ten thousand, including the Corps of Gendarmes. Further expan-
sion occurred after the foundation of the Okhrana and Police . 
Department in 1880. It becomes increasingly difficult, however, 
to estimate the precise number of persons working for the secret 
police at any given Moment, since so many gradations of bribed,. 
bullied, blackmailed or terrorised part-time informants were to be 
found in the middle reaches of police operations�between�tile 
inner ring of full-time salaried police officials or agents, and ordin-
ary citizens liable to be summoned for questioning at any time 
and under an obligation to denounce any manifestation of 
political opposition which might have come to their notice. 
If one asks how many Soviet�not to mention foreign�citizens 
arc in some .sense working for the Russian secret police at the 
beginning of thc 19705, it must be answered that the reservoir of 
potential KGB informants includes practically the entire Soviet 
population, though dotards, infants and rustics are less likely to be 
so employed than town-dwellers in the prime of life. Those who 
encounter Soviet citizens, whether on Soviet or non-Soviet soil, 
would be well advised to regard all their contacts, however 
amiable, smiling and sympathetic, as potential KGB informants�
not necessarily willing ones�owing to the obligation liable to be 
Placed on all Soviet citizens to furnish detailed political reports on 
their conversations with foreigners. On this elementary fact of life 
many western governments now warn businessmen and others 
travelling to the USSR, apart from which diplomats posted to 
Moscow necessarily receive detailed and intense briefing on the 
highly sophisticated and persistent techniques of espionage to 
which they are certain to be exposed. Owing to the growing refine-
ment of 'bugging' devices, many foreign embassies in Moscow and 
other Communist countries maintain elaborately constructed safe 
rooms in which, it is hoped, conversations and transactions of a 
particularly confidential nature may take place without the 
danger of eavesdropping by KGB and Soviet military intelligence 
operatives primed with the latest scientific devices. . 
So far as the ordinary tourist is concerned, he would be wise to 
allow for . the possibility that any Soviet hotel room, restaurant 
table, taxi, train or aeroplane which lie occupies may be 'bugged' 
�though of course even the KGB's huge resources, and seemingly 
unslakcd appetite for trivial information, do not extend to the full, 
recording and processing of all remarks uttered by all visitors to 
the Soviet Union at all times. It is the possibility�not the cer-
tainty�of such surveillance which should be allowed for. 
Now under-employed since the restrictions on terrorism or-
dained after Stalin's death, Soviet intelligence by no means con-
fines the collection of information, whether abroad Or on home 
ground, to political, military and economic matters, though these 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642

endemic feature of the Russian, and perhaps of all political police 
organisations, has been the inability of the authorities to work out 
any , stable chain of command or system of administration. 
Repeated switches and .changes of balance arc, perhaps, an 
essential when one is administering what is, after all, potentially 
the most dangerous institution in the State�dangerous to its own 
masters as well as to its enemies. 
, Fortunately or unfortunately, the KGB seems, at the moment of 
writing, to show greater signs of long-term stability than any 
preceding Russian secret police force. Yet these words could easily 
be 'belied by events through - sudden unforeseen developments 
occurring between the preparation of this study and its appearance 
in print.

naturally receive high priority. The private lives of individuals 
also form an object of scrutiny, particularly as such inVestigation 
may create an opportunity for recruiting agents through black-
mail by threat of exposure. It is also a common KGB practice to 
compromise potential foreign informants by various techniques�
not least by the 'provocation' of individuals earmarked as particu-
larly vulnerable. This has frequently involved the photographing, 
if necessary through one-way mirrors, of the victim in an embar-
rassing posture deliberately engineered and implying or recording 
some combination of drunken, drugged, homosexual or hetero-
sexual misbehaviour. 
By Contrast with the treatment of political prisoners under the 
Third Section and Okhrana, the political police of Soviet times 
has de facto, if not de jure, generally acted as detecting, arresting, 
imprisoning, judging and sentencing authority in political cases. 
These functions arc, moreover, retained to a large extent by the 
present-day KGB, although determined attempts arc now made 
to impart a veneer of legality to political security proceedings by 
creating the simulacrum of trial by independent courts. Thus the 
secret police still occupies, at the beginning of the 197os, a domin-
ant position never held by Third Section or Okhrana�and this 
despite a significant though by no means total retreat from insti-
tutionalised as practiied under Stalin. 
It is above all in the creation of systematic political terror on a 
nationwide scale that the Soviet police system may claim to have 
advanced far beyond its Tsarist prototype. Unless he was extreme-
ly lucky, an ordinary unheroic citizen of Imperial Russia could 
confidently expect to escape persecution on political grounds by 
keeping his mouth shut, by abstaining from officially disapproved 
activities�and perhaps by changing his religion. The essence of 
Stalinism was to destroy such possibilities, leaving no haven of 
- security even for the most timorous and terrorised. In the deliberate 
intimidation of the entire population, in the wholesale saturation 
of society with spies and informers, and in the systematic use of 
pre-emptive arrest to forestall possible trouble by immunising vast 
sections of potential trouble-makers in advance�in all these

VIETNAM PULLOUT  
SOME FACTS ON U:S. DISENGAGEMENI-INYIETNAM 
-- at the peak of U.S. military involvement (mid-1969) there 
were more than 543,000 American servicemen in South Vietnam including 
97 combat battalions and support troops, plus a vast air armada; 
today there are under 200,000 American servicemen in Vietnam. 
-- the present withdrawal plan calls for U.S. troop strength 
to be at or below 184,000 by the 1 December reduction deadline; 
it is anticipated that President Nixon may step-up the present 
14,300 monthly withdrawal rate of U.S. servicemen to 20,000. 
-- only one Navy aircraft ,carrier (the 85,000-ton nuclear-
powered Enterprise) is now on station in the Gulf of Tonkin where 
three carriers were in constant operation at the peak of the fighting; 
the U.S. Navy has already transferred 1,400 other craft to the 
South Vietnamese. 
-- the U.S. Air Forces's peak force of 35 squadrons of attack 
jets (a squadron normally has 18 planes) has been reduced to 12; 
this includes withdrawal of all 16 squadrons of F-100s, formerly 
the backbone of the air war in Vietnam. 
-- the entire Marine air wing, with 10 attack squadrons has 
been withdrawn. 
--- although a few Americanshave stayed on at the DMZ fire bases 
to tend complex optical and radar equipment, the South Vietnamese 
are substantially defending their own northern border for the first 
time since heavy North Vietnamese infiltration across the DMZ began 
in 1966. 
-- the gradual turnover of 16 newly-built U.S. radar Sites to 
the South:Vietnamese has caused Saigon papers to discover that the 
radar sites are under surveillance by a Soviet intelligence-gathering 
ship off the coast of South Vietnam; sometime in June this year, the 
intelligence ship was added to the Russian trawlers monitoring 
American aircraft carriers operating in the Gulf of Tonkin. 
Vietnamization has become tangible - in the communiques, 
the casualty lists, the combat outposts - to the point where it 
is clear that the South Vietnamese are taking back control of their 
country; if some of their reactions are frustrated, even hostile, 
their "withdrawal symptoms" are human and hnderstandable to some 
degree.

-- the U.S. is not pulling out irresponsibly, nor abruptly; 
in addition to the time, political energy, money and lives already 
spent in South Vietnam, it is estimated that American economic 
aid will have to continue for the next 10 years. Necessary 
spending willstart with about $700 million for the first few 
years and end:up costing the American taxpayer about $4 billion 
over the decade. It is easy to shrug this off because America 
is rich but America is also beset with serious domestic problems 
to which monies spent in South Vietnam might have been applied. 
-- U.S. "Operation Retrograde" encompassing the distribution 
and disposal of vast stores of U.S. weapons and other materiel 
now amassed in Vietnam is an instructive reminder of the myriad, 
practical ways in which Asian allies are receiving U.S. assistance.

THE WASHINGTON POST 
20 October 1971 
To End Involvement in Vietnam' 
Last Tuesday, largely unnoticed, Mr. Nixon made 
what may be his most important statement on Viet-
nam. By the time he goes to Moscow next May, he 
said, the United States will have "endEedl American 
involvement in Vietnam. . . or at least have made 
significant progress toward accomplishing that 
goal." 
Three aspects of this statement were distinctive. 
First, he spoke of ending '(American involvement," 
a phrase which surely goes beyond ground combat 
forces into the uncertain but negotiable area of ad-
visers, logistical personnel,. "residual force" and 
"supporting air." Second, he defined the ending of 
involvement as a "goal," which it properly is; pre-
.viously he hadl tended to discuss his war aims in 
terms of bringing about a certain political 'result 
in Vietnam. And third, he inched closer to setting 
a specific date for ending the American involve. 
ment. By May, he said, "we trust that we will have 
accomplished that goal, or at least have made 
significant progress" toward it. 
In short, President Nixon has lent his personal 
authority and prestige to a public pledge to remove 
the United States from the war, perhaps within 
seven months. Though he left himself a large loop-
hole ("substantial progress"), he has gone further 
towards doing what the bulk of, his responsible crit-
ics have long pleaded with him to do: set a reason-
able final limit on American participation in the 
war. This is surely the thrust of his words. 
Now, we realize that Mr. Nixon strongly urged us 
all not to "speculate" about what he will say in his 
long-scheduled Vietnam report on Nov. 15. In the 
'joint interests of communicating with our readers 
and of encouraging the President to proceed along 
the path he now appears to have chosen, however, 
we will press cautiously on. 
Two broad developments permit, if they do not 
require, Mr. Nixon to leave the war. 
Inside Vietnam, events thoroughly justify the 
conclusion that the United States has given South 
:Vietnam that "'reasonable chance" to survive on its 
, own. President Thieu, freshly re-elected by an emi-
nently Vietnamese electoral process, is seated more 
firmly than ever; Saigon has made "great progress" 
towards representative government, Mr. Nixon ob-
served last week. Ambassador Porter recently told 
the Vietcong: "Of the 300 or so district and province ' 
capitals of South Vietnam, you do not hold a single 
one after these many years of war and your best 
military efforts. You are, in fact, further from mili-
tary victory than ever." Politically, he said, the 
Vietcong are similarly disabled. We realize well that 
such judgments as Mr. Nixon's and Mr. Porter's are ' 
not indisputable. But we see no reason to dispute 
them. The important point is that the administra-
tion itself chooses to portray devel' l'Pnts in Viet-
nam in a way indicating that the A- yaission 
there has been successfully accomplished. We could 
not agree more. 
Outside Vietnam, of course, the President's forth-
coming trips to Moscow and Peking have entirely; 
altered the international context of the war. That 
Peking and then Moscow invited him can only mean 
to the Vietcong and Hanoi that their principal allies 
� have other and larger fish to fry, as indeed they 
have. It need not mean a Chinese or Soviet sellout 
of their Vietnamese clients. It unquestionably 
means a judgment in Moscow and Peking that their 
clients are now within striking distance of a deal 
which they, the patrons, believe ought to be 
.grabbed. 
What kind of a deal? Back in August, Mr. Nixon 
said: "The record, when it finally comes out, will: 
answer all the critics as far as the activity of this, 
government in pursuing negotiations in established; 
channels." Now, 'this could merely mean that the 
record will show that the Nixon administration gave' 
it an honest try. Or it could mean that something is 
brewing, perhaps something which is intimately tied 
into Mr. Nixon's larger dealings with Peking and 
Moscow. By the nature of so delicate and difficult 
a diplomatic undertaking, it would he impossible 
at this point for any but a very few insiders to 
know. What is clear is that the President, when he 
talks about "ending American involvement" and 
claims that his negotiating record will "answer all 
the critics," is taking upon himself a tremendous 
responsibility to produce positive and conclusive re-
sults well in advance of his rendezvous with the 
electorate a year from now. He is creating his own 
political imperatives and this is perhaps the strong-
est assurance he could be expected to give at this 
point' in time of his determination to deliver on'' 
his promises.

U.S. Disengagement .

From an address by H. E. Nobuhiko, 
TJshiba, ambassador of Japan to the U.S., 
before the City Club of Portland, Oregon, 
September 24: 
How the American strategy evolves, fol-
lowing the "winding down" of the Indochina 
war, and with the application a the Nixon 
Doctrine, is probably the most Important 
single element In the equation of future 
Asian stability. Indeed, the American stra-
tegic posture will undoubtedly affect 
'China's future outlook. 
It is a foregone conclusion that the United 
States will soon be disengaged from any 
combat responsibility in Vietnam, probably 
by sometime in 1972. The Nixon Doctrine

O r 
has put Asia and the world on notice that 
the United States�while maintaining its 
treaty commitments and the umbrella of its 
nuclear deterrent�will not again commit 
American troops to� the defense of friendly 
states, except in cases of massive aggression 
in which the vital interests of the United 
States are threatened. According to the Doc-
trine, America will provide material assist-
ance, when requested, to threatened nations 
which accept ultimate responsibility for 
their own defense.

ITS "LAST STAN " IN VIETN 
Indo-China war will be over 
for most American soldiers in 
1972. But not for all. Job al-

who will remain. 
SAIGON 
Now becoming clear is the shape of 
U. S. military power that President Nixon 
intends to maintain in South Vietnam�
perhaps for several more years. 
By December, U. S. strength in Viet-
nam will be down to 184,000. According 
to Pentagon projections, this figure will 
drop to about 45,000 toward the end 
of 1972. 
After that, unless the White House 
changes signals, American forces will re-
main at roughly that level until two 
U. S. objectives in Vietnam are achieved: 
� Release of all prisoners of war held 
by the Reds in Southeast Asia. 
� Development of South Vietnam's 
military capability to defend itself 
against a Communist take-over.

Three enclaves. By the time U. S. 
forces are reduced to 45,000 men, most 
GI's will, with virtual certainty, be con-
centrated in three American enclaves: 
Da Nang in the north, Cam Ranh Bay 
in the central sector and Long Binh in 
the south near Saigon. 
Each already is a key base with air-
fields, nearby port facilities and vast 
stockpiles of war materiel. As the U. S.

they will be used to speed 
training of South Vietna-

Other Americans will

South Vietnamese units. 
Some of the 500 Air Force 
and Navy planes and near-
ly 3,000 helicopters that 
are presently stationed in 
Southeast Asia will furnish air support. 
Main responsibility of American infan-
trymen in the future will be defensive�
to guard Da Nang, Cam Ranh Bay and 
Long Binh from Communist attack. 
Still some casualties. U. S. officers 
emphasize, however, that American GI's 
still will fight and suffer casualties. To 
guard the bases, they say, heavily mined 
patrols will have to sweep the areas 
around the enclaves, and they are certain . 
to run into the enemy. 
American military men concede that 
the concentration of GI's into three en-
claves will increase the danger of Red 
assaults. According to ..Col. John 0. En-

The war in Vietnam fell

4,650 men to return home be-

The cutback was the second 
largest to be announced at one

"As the level of combat drops in the 
field, our fixed bases become more at-

expect that the Viet Cong will begin to

If President Thieu wins big, as expected, his opponents 
will certainly charge fraud. If he falters, there could be a 
wholesale upheaval of the entire machinery of provincial 
government and a sweeping military shake-up as. well. 
WAR FRONT: STILL HOPE 
The military picture appears not too grim over all, com-
pared with what is found on the political and economic fronts. 
That is true despite the steady pull-back from combat of re-
maining U. S. forces. 
At the peak of the U. S. involvement, American troops in 
South Vietnam numbered 543,400. That force included 97 
combat battalions plus all their support troops and a vast 
air armada. 
U. S. forces are now down to 27 front-line battalions, and 
these have been pulled out of major combat operations. 
Total American strength is down to 219,000 men. 
The regular armed forces of South Vietnam number ap-
proximately 525,000. 
At one time there were four full U. S. infantry divisions 
and an armored cavalry regiment plus support troops in 
Military Region Two, the Central Highlands area. Strength 
then was about 200,000, half of whom were front-line men. 
Now there are only three U. S. combat battalions of per-
haps 3,000 men in the area. They aren't out looking for the 
enemy. One unit guards convoys that move along Highway 
19 and the two others protect the Tuy Hoa Air Base and 
the big port and air-base complex at Cam Ranh Bay. 
Reds play waiting game. Says an American military 
spokesman: "Obviously, the South Vietnamese have had to 
spread out their forces to cover the territory once occupied 
by U. S. units." So far, neither the North Vietnamese nor the 
Viet Cong have made any major pushes to fully test how 
determined the South Vietnamese are. 
A drive in Military Region One, below the Demilitarized 
Zone in the Northern end of South Vietnam, is seen as 
likely. There U. S. ground troops have turned a string of

fire-support bases over to the South Vietnamese. American 
forces have moved back to three enclaves near the coast. 
The U. S. pullout is also affecting its advisory efforts. 
Formerly, teams of American Army advisers were out 
with every South Vietnamese battalion. No more. 
Advisers now serve only with regimental and division-
level staffs. The number of men in such teams has also 
been trimmed. A division advisory team that formerly had 
40 Americans makes do today with perhaps half that number. 
This is not necessarily bad, in the opinion of some Ameri-
cans. Says one: "There's not much a young American captain 
.or major can tell a South Vietnamese battalion commander 
who has probably been in combat against the Viet Cong 
and North Vietnamese for nearly 10 years." 
Mostly, the U. S. advisers co-ordinate air strikes and help 
with arrangements for helicopter and other supply support. 
Weakness in the air. The South Vietnamese Air Force 
is considerably less advanced than the ground forces, although 
important strides have been made. In three of the country's 
four military regions, South Vietnamese airmen are now in 
charge of the important Direct Air Support Centers which 
control all tactical air strikes in the country. 
Over the past two years, Saigon's Air Force has expanded 
from 23,600 men to 42,000. By mid-1973, the force should 
level off at about 50,000 men. 
There's not much that can be done to speed up the Viet-
namization of the air war. Nearly two years is required to 
train a young Vietnamese high-school graduate to become a 
qualified pilot. 
At Nha Trang Air Base, about 8,000 men will be gradu-
ated this year as tower controllers, aircraft mechanics, com-
munications specialists and fliers. However, only , through 
actual experience can they be trained to do the technical 
jobs required�and that takes time. 
At Pleiku Air Base in the Central Highlands, Lt. Col. 
Robert L. Nicholl, as a U. S. advisory-team chief, has watched 
South Vietnamese take over from the Americans. Since No-
vember of last year, when they started with a bare field, 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
they have built a four-squadron tactical wing into what U. S. 
advisers consider a first-rate outfit. 
While the youngish-looking South Vietnamese pilots are 
rated as "hot shots," often as good as their American fighter-
bomber counterparts, ground support isn't up to standard. 
Vietnamese crews take as long as three hours to ready a 
fighter-bomber for another mission after it has returned from 
a strike. American ground crews do the same job in one hem. 
With the tempo of ground combat now at a record low, 
the South Vietnamese arc able to handle about SO per cent 
of the 3.500 air strikes being flown monthly. 
Should there be a sudden return to large-scale fighting, 
however, Saigon would be hard put to provide even a frac-
tion of the fighter-bombers and helicopters thrown into action 
bv the U. S. at the height of the war, in 1968 and 1969. 
Then the U. S. Air Force had 21 squadrons made up of about 
400 fighter-bombers available for attack. In addition, the 
Marines and Navy threw in hundreds more.

To run the country, feed its population and pay for nec-

220 million of this was . used to buy fertilizer, fishing nets, 
chemicals and electrical, equipment considered vital to the

Many tens of thousands of Vietnamese working for the

Now that the Marines are gone, the Navy has greatly 
re-
cluced its missions over South Vietnam. The Air Force is

By way of comparison, the South Vietnamese have only . 
six jet attack squadrons. They are equipped with the A-37 
Dragonfly jet and the F-5 Freedom Fighter jet. Three other 
)squadrons fly the reliable but 20-year-old A-1. Skvraider 
propeller planes. South Vietnam's other transport, liaison, 
reconnaissance and gunship units add up to 15 squadrons,. 
a total of about 500 fixed-wing planes. 
The South' Vietnamese have 14 squadrons of about 350 
helicopters. At its peak, the U. S. Army's helicopter force 
numbered more than 4,000. Despite the troop pullout, the. 
U. S. still has nearly 3,090 of its copters in South Vietnam. 
Even with a planned build-up to perhaps 500 helicopters 
in two years, the South Vietnamese will have to learn to op-
erate without the luxury of great fleets of helicopters to. air-
lift troops around. -

weather roads link once-isolated districts and modern bridges

The U. S. maintains and operates a network of ports and 
airports used by the civilian economy, but at no cost to the 
Saigon Government. 
When the United States ends its military presence here, 
South Vietnam will find itself responsible for these facilities 
for the first time. 
Says one expert: "As the tempo of the war slows down, 
there is a desperate need for budget planning and attention 
to fiscal problems; there must be a new sense of priorities."... 
Another authority estimates that American aid will have 
to continue for the next 10 years. Necessary spending for the 
first few years is estimated at about 700 million dollars. Af-
ter that, it could taper off to perhaps 400 million a year. 
Projected economic-aid bill for the next decade: 4 billion 
: dollars. 
� Mostly, the mood of Americans from one end of South 
Vietnam to the other reflects a sense of finality. They feel 
the U. S. has done all it can to prepare the South Vietnam-
ese to keep their country afloat. The way most Americans 
sum it up: "What happens from here on out is up to them."

NEI 20 July'U.S. Giving Radar Sites to Vietnamese 
S:lecial to The New York Times 
' VUNGTAU, South Vietnam, 
July 13�The United - tes 
Navy is building 16 radar sites 
for surveillance of ship move-
ments along the coast of South 
Vietnam and plans to give them 
to the South Vietnamese Navy 
by next spring. 
, The first of the sites, on a 
mountain peak here 50 miles 
southeast of Saigon, has re-
cently been turned over to the 
South Vietnamese. 
A Soviet intelligence-gather-
ing ship, meanwhie, has been 
spotted off the coast of South 
Vietnam and is presumably 
watching the new installations. 
Only, a month ago the intel-
ligence ship supplemented a 
Russian trawler that has for 
years kept a close eye on the 
activities of American aircraft 
carriers operating in the Gulf 
of Tonkin, according to United 
States Navy pilots. 
According to high-ranking 
United States naval officers, 
the radar installations will "en-
hance the coastal defense and 
counterinfiltration capability of 
tee Vietnamese Navy." 
Interception Is Planned 
Supplementing the radar 
sites, surface craft are to be 
assigned to identify and inter-
cept any unidentified ships. 
One United States naval ad-
viser, who asked not to be 
named, said here that the radar 
system has a "multitude of pur-
poses." He refused, however,1 
to say what those purposes are.! 
Nine of the 16 sites span 
an area in which United States 
and Japanese petroleum compa-
nies are expected to bid for oil 
rights, perhaps late this year 
or early next year, after the 
presidential elections early in 
October. 
It is understood that foreign 
oil cOmpanies are eager to get 
some assurance from the South 
Vietnamese Government that 
security will be provided before 
they begin drilling. 
A spokesman for Rear Adm. 
Robert S. Selzer, commander cif 
United States naval forces in 
Vietnam, said that he "couldn't 
talk about the cost a the elec-
tronic equipment being installed 
because it would give away to 
the other side a good idea of 
the capability of it." 
me radar sites are being' 
built under contract with the 
United States Government by 
R.M.K.-B.R.J., the American 
construction consortium, and 
by navel construction engil 
neers. 
Running from Hue, below the 
demilitarized zone, to Hondoc 
island, near the Cambodian: 
border, the 16 radar installa-
tions are strung out on high 
hills and mountain peaks near, 
the sea and on islands along 
the southern coast. 
Thre American advisers are 
to be placed at each site as it 
opens to make sure the South, 
Vietnarnese become familiar; 
with the equipment. The Amer-
leans will stay at the radar 
sites "for only a limited period, 
of time,"

VIETNAM PULLOUT 
d ned Arsenals This Time 
. SAIGON 
While Americans debate the pace 
of the U. S. troop withdrawal from South 
Vietnam, a massive pullout of another 
kind is taking place. 
Billions of dollars' worth of American 
military equipment�from shoelaces to 
50-ton tanks�is being hauled out, no 
longer needed in Vietnam by. the dwin-
dling force of GI's. 
One top U. S. official here calls the 
operation "the most elaborate military-
property-disposal drive in history." 
The U. S. already has shipped out of 
Vietnam more than 1.4 million tons of 
surplus supplies, valued at :about 3.5 
billion dollars. Officers estimate that up 
to 2.5 million tons remain, about half of 
which will be given to the South Viet-
panics� Government. 
Basic goal of the program: to save 
the American taxpayer money by avoid-
ing costly mistakes of the past.' 
Walking away from it. After World 
War II�and to some extent after the 
Korean War�the U. S. discarded over-
seas vast stores of weapons and other 
materiel. Much of this abandoned arsenal 
weathered away. Some made rich men of 
the traders�many of them former GI's�
who rehabilitated the castoff gear or sold 
it as junk. 
American commanders are determined 
to avoid a similar situation in Vietnam, 
where U. S. forces are being cut from a 
1969 peak of 543,400 men to about 
45,000 by the end of 1972: According 
to a military-supply expert in Saigon: 
"There aren't going te . be any junk 
islands filled with rusting . equipment 
after this war. We are going to bring 
the stuff back." 
U. S. officials are equally determined 
that no equipment or scrap metal falls 
into the hands of the Communists. "We 
don't want the scrap to be made into 
bullets and fired back at us," says one 
military source. 
Code name given to the disposal pro-
gram is Operation Retrograde, a com-
plicated exercise in supply and .lemand, 
screened by computers to insure That 
surplus equipment goes where it is 
needed most. 
Sliding scale. Under a priority sys-
tem, U. S. troops remaining in Southeast 
Asia get first call on all surplus. Next 
come the South Vietnamese armed 
forces, then other U. S. allies in Asia, 
followed by American 
units in other parts of the 
world and in the U. S. 
After these primary 
needs are filled, equip-
ment goes to such second-
ary "customers" as the 
U. S. Agency for Interna-
tional Development, the 
World Health Organiza-
tion, or South Vietnamese 
Government departrnents. 
Even U. S. federal prisons 
and Indian reservations re-
ceive excess supplies. The 
leftovers are sold to civil-
ian bidders, usually for 
scrap. Since 1967, these 
surplus sales have totaled 
nearly 21 million dollars. 
Vietnam commanders 
emphasize that Operation 
Retrograde saves the U.S. 
military-aid program money by supply-
ing Asian allies with used equipment 
instead of more costly new gear. Cam-
bodia now is an important recipient. 
At Long Binh, near Saigon, U. S. Aril-1)i 
trucks, cleaned and repainted, wait in 
neat rows to be picked up by troops 
from Thailand. Rifles and radio equip-
ment are being shipped to South Korea 
and Taiwan. 
As of June 1, South Vietnam had re-
ceived more than 1,600 surplus artillery 
pieces and tanks, 835,000 small arms 
and other weapons, 45,000 trucks and 
jeeps, 575 airplanes and helicopters, and 
43,000 radios. 
A major U. S. problem is how to 
avoid giving the South Vietnamese ma-
teriel they do not need or do not know 
how to use. Says one American officer: 
"We don't want to hand the Vietnam-
ese maintenance and training nightmares 
by rushing them into using equipment 
that is too sophisticated at this stage."-
About 60 per cent of the 400 instal-
lations built by the U. S.�total cost, 1.8 
billion dollars�have been given to South 
Vietnam or are in the process of being 
turned over. Most of these are small 
camps. All so-called permanent struc-
tures on the bases are in fact tempOraiy. 
' One supply officer observes: "They 
were designed so that, ideally, when the 
.last American gets aboard an airplane, - 
the building collapses." 
Getting Operation Retrograde under 
way was not easy. An officer explains: 
"We had no guidelines, and few if 
, any precedents to go by. We've had to 
play it by ear. But we've learned a lot, 
- and now things are working fairly 
smoothly." 
Volume of materiel moving out of 
Vietnam, officers claim, nearly equals 
that which came in when the big U. S. 
build-up began in 1965. The .79th Main.' 
tenance Battalion stationed at Long 
Binh alone received and processed near-
ly 900,000 items between last November 
and mid-June. 
"At one time," says the battalion com-
mander, Lt. Col. Byard W. Rife, "we 
had literally acres of . guns, trailers, 
trucks, small arms and communications 
gear waiting to be checked in, cleaned 
and shipped out." 
Checking out. As each American 
unit is ordered to "stand down" from 
combat, it immediately returns to the 
nearest .supply depot virtually zdl sup-
plies and equipment, except the clothes 
on the backs of GI's. Tanks, armored 
personnel carriers and other vehicles dam-
aged in combat often have to he drag-
ged in. 
If they can he repaired, they are. 
Otherwise, they are stripped of guns, en-
gines, transmissions and axles and sold 
for scrap. 
To meet American import re,z,dations, 
all pieces of major equipment shipped 
to the U. S. are first cleaned with high-
pressure hoses on sites resembling giant 
ear-washes. Then most equipment is sent 
to Da Nang, Cam Ranh Bay or New-
port, a U. S. Army port outside Saigon, 
to await shipment. Says Sfc. Carl Chris. 
ner at Newport headquarters: 
"Ships used to come out tO South 
Vietnam full and leave empty. You don't

any more." 
Inventory control for surplus goods in 
the Far East is located in Honolulu. 
Various depots in the Pacific region han-
dle different equipment. Tracked ve�
hicies from Vietnam go first to Sagami, 
Japan. Small trucks and jeeps are ship-
ped to Taiwan.. - 
Computer decisions. Heavy-duty 
trucks, generators, electronic and com-

and medicine go to the Second Logis-

ment goes where. 
From July, 1968, through April, 1971, 
the command disposed of 938 million 
dollars' worth of equipment�more than 
2 million different items ranging from 
10-cent cotter pins to $15,000 trucks.

In 1968, the command repaired 463

2,730 and next year, 5,058. 
Realizing the risks' involved in the 
selling or giving away of surplus Govern-
ment property, U. S. officials have set 
up complicated safeguards to prevent 
fraud or profiteering. For example, the 
U. S. has the right to check back for up 
to two Years on property turned over to 
the South Vietnamese Government to 
make certain it has not been sold on the 
civilian market. 
Scrap Metal also is sold on the condi-
tion that it cannot be resold, a regula-
tion designed to keep it away from 
Communist countries. 
Gathering brass. One item the U. S. 
does not sell to anyone is brass shell 
casings. They are so valuable .they are 
gathered after each battle�sometimes 
by villagers who are paid 40 cents for 
each 2.2 pounds of brass they turn in. 
Despite the safeguards against fraud, 
no supply authority here claims the sys-
tem is foolproof. One official says:

About 450 civilians, representing com-
panies in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore 
and New York, are permitted to buy sur-
plus. Agents for or from Communist 
countries are excluded. Most of the bid-

yet one Saigon trader says: "Some �are

Some shady dealers have been barred 
from further bidding after trying to bribe

manning defensive positions described by 
officials as "static." 
This command grew out of U. S. hopes 
in 1964-65 that many nations�particular-
ly Asian�could be mobilized in a show of 
battlefield solidarity against Communist 
aggression in South Vieniam. That is 
what happened in Korea when the South 
was invaded by the Communist North in 
1950. Fifteen countries from Europe and 
the Far East sent combat units into action 
in Korea under a United Nations com-
mand. 
But no such widespread international 
rescue mission was mounted in Vietnam. 
The Philippines, Nationalist China and 
Spain provided small semimilitary units 
�but restricted them to noncombatant 
duties. In the case of Spain it involved 
seven Army doctors.

involvement in Vietnam began with a 
mobile Army hospital in September,

units, plus one Marine brigade. The 
U. S. picked up a major part of the bill 
�more than 1 billion dollars to date. 
The Koreans also insisted on being 
equipped with some of the best U. S. 
arms, including the M-16 rifle, and the 
latest in communications gear. 
How effective have they been? ROK 
officers claim they have expanded their 
area of control from 1,300 square miles 
in early 1965 to 7,500 at present and 
have more than doubled the number of 
South Vietnamese under their protection. 
The Koreans, who are acknowledged 
to be tough fighters, have won a variety 
of battle honors. In a long series of en-
gagements, they claim to have killed 
35,406 of the enemy, with losses tu

This is view Mr. Thieu expressed to

Dr. Kissinger, who just completed a three-

SOUTH VIETNAMESE PLANS FOR FUTURE ARMED FORCES 
South Vietnam is moving toward a military establishment of 1,100,000 
men. The army's field force has now reached 427,500 of its scheduled 
strength of 450,000 men. The field force will be organized into 10 infantry 
divisions and one airborne division. 
The Regional Forces, comparable to the United States National Guard, 
are formed into about 1,000 companies trained and equipped to assist the 
field army within their home regions. 
Strength of Supporting Forces 
The Popular Forces, with a lower scale of equipment, are organized 
into 7,000 platoons and are trained for village security. The total 
strength of the two forces will be about 500,000 men. The Peoples's 
Self Defense Forces, composed of boys and older men, is to be employed 
as a home guard. 
Of the 50 squadrons planned for the air force, 37 are now active. 
and more than 34,000 of a planned total of 45,000 airmen have been trained. 
The air force is scheduled to have 1,200-aircraft. 
Naval strength will be 1,600 vessels and 40,000 men. The United 
States has already transferred more than 1,400 craft to the South Vietnamese. 
The Government, assisted by Americans, has organized a,training 
program that has graduated 108,000 men from a wide variety of service 
schools ranging from the War College to a school for dog handlers.

MOSCOW AND TILE ARAB WORLD: A TURNING POINT? 
The USSR, as the only major power bordering on the Near East, 
believes its national interests require that this area fall within 
the Soviet sphere of influence. (The activist assumptions of Communist 
ideology obviously demand something more.)/ To,- this end, the USSR 
has steadily expanded its influence following the withdrawal of 
Britain and France from the area. The key to Soviet expansion has 
been Egypt When Nasser was seeking financial support to construct 
the Aswan Dam, Moscow proved more than willing to provide the funds. 
More important, the Soviet Union also agreed at that time to arm 
and train Egyptian forces for their confrontation with Israel. The 
Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation which Nasser's successor, 
Anwar Sadat, signed with Moscow in May of this year may have marked 
the apogee of Soviet-Egyptian relations. 
Two months after the treaty was signed, the local Communist 
Party in neighboring Sudan attempted to seize power. Bulgaria, known 
for its role as Moscow's proxy in the Arab world, was implicated in 
the coup attempt. And the Soviets found themselves in the embarrassing 
position of having praised the coup (in the Moscow weekly NOW Times  
and in thepro-Soviet weekly 'Link in New Delhi) during the short 
period before Nimeri was restored to power. The failure of the coup 
was in part a result of Egypt's prompt support of General Nimeri which 
paved the way for government reprisals and the subsequent destruction 
of the Sudanese Communist Party. By coming immediately to Nimeri's 
aid (Thereare conflicting reports of the extent to which 'Ioviet-
equipped Egyptian troops participated.), Sadat made it clear that 
despite Soviet military aid and the 15-year treaty, Egypt would 
continue to play an independent role in Arab politics and would 
not countenance a Communist state on its borders. 
The SOviet Union has probably had few illusions about the short-
range potential of Communism in the Arab World. Moscow has been 
reminded on more than one occasion of the basic incompatibility 
between Islam, with its fatalism and its strong emphasis on the 
family, and Communism. However, the events surrounding the Sudan 
coup have probably also cast doubts on the ultimate rewards of 
supporting Arab nationalist governments. 
Two other developments related to the Sudan incident of July 
probably served to strengthen Soviet doubts. China was quick to 
exploit Moscow's dilemma in the Sudan. The Peking People's Daily  
of 27 July reported that Sudanese armed forces had crushed an 
attempt byia "clique" to overthrow General Nimeri. On 15 August 
the same paper conveyed to Nimeri China's support for Sudan's efforts 
to "preserve her independence and to cope with all forms of pressure." 
The latter message also offered development aid.

On 20 August in Damascus, leaders of Egypt, Syria and Libya 
approved the constitution of a Federation of Arab Republics. The 
constitution emphasizes that Islam is the official religion of 
the Federation and that one-party governments are the order of 
the day. 
Since 1956 Moscow has given clear, if temporary and tactical, 
A 
prevedence to establishing close relations with nationalist Arab 
regimes. In so doing, it has found itself on several occasions 
in the position of helpless witness to the destruction of Communist 
apparatuses and agents in which it had also heavily invested. The 
Communist Party in Egypt has been banned during the entire 15 years 
of Soviet presence. Soviet agents of influence in the Egyptian 
government are currently on :trial for treason. In the Sudan, as 
a result of the abortive coup, the strongest Communist party in 
Africa has been destroyed and its leaders executed, -despite (on 
this occasion) Moscow's protests and threats. In Syria and Iraq, 
where there is a large Soviet military presence, the Communist 
parties are illegal but tolerated. Recognized Communists serve 
in the respective Ba'th Party regimes of both countries; this is 
permitted, largely, to appease the Soviets. 
However, it is not only the local Communist parties that 
understand they can no longer depend on the Soviet Union to support 
them or save them when they get in trouble. The younger generation 
of Arab radicals, who grew up with Nasser's aspirations and Nasser's 
promises ringing in their ears, and who today have risen in the 
ranks of the military and have taken power in certain countries, 
are eager to fulfill their political dreams. The watchword of the 
radicals is Arab unity and revenge against Israel, (Sadat,- whose 
base of power rests in part on Egyptian army support, is not 
immune to the pressures from this group.) Arab radicals, who 
have become disenchanted with Soviet counsels of patience and 
restraint, are increasingly looking eastward to China. 
Thus, the price the Soviet Union is paying for its support 
of "national bourgeois" regimes is the alienation of that very 
group normally most responsive to Soviet blandishments. Particularly 
galling to Moscow is the fact that China is moving to exploit this 
radical group at Soviet expense. 
Fifteen years of expanding Soviet influence in the Arab world 
may have reached a turning point this summer. The 'Sudan affair 
served to increase Arab suspicions and to dampen Moscow's enthusiasm. 
Nimeri's reprisals against local Communists over strong Moscow 
objections resulted in an acrimonious exchange between the two 
countries, the expulsion of the Soviet Counsellor and the Bulgarian 
Ambassador, and almost caused a break in diplomatic relations 
between the two countries. In Egypt, following the ouster of the 
pro-Moscow group from the government and the events in the Sudan, 
the prevalent mood of the government and the military is more anti-

Communist than ever. The Egyptians recently announced that following 
President Sadat's trip to Moscow, he will talk with President Tito. 
The latter' is known to be concerned about the effect of Soviet 
initiatives on Egypt's "non-aligned" posture. 
The delicate relationship between Moscow, Arab nationalism 
and Communism has been upset, although it has not necessarily been 
broken. Moscow is undoubtedly trying to digest and evaluate the 
events of this summer in terms of their meaning for Soviet Near 
East policies. Will Moscow in the future continue to give the same 
priority to support of national Arab regimes at the expense of 
the local Conununist and the radicals? Will it continue its current 
outsized military investment in Egypt? Or will it exert pressure 
on Egypt to arrange a modus vivendi with Israel -- and how much 
pressure is It capable of exerting? What new tactics can Moscow 
devise to protqct its stake in the Arab world from Chinese encroach-
ments? The answers to these questions are not yet apparent. However, 
Sadat's trip to Moscow and Belgrade, as well as UN discussions of 
the Arab-Israeli issuevmay provide some clues as to Soviet inclinations. 
Meanwhile, the recent Visit of sic left-leaning Israelis to the USSR 
as guests Of the Soviet Peace Committee is an indication that Moscow 
intends to open a Channel of communication to the other major party 
in the Arab-Israeli dispute.

The attempted coup' ,in, Morocco, the putsch and

counterputsch in Sudan, the eviction of the fcricoicen 
�from their bases in Jordan and the subsequent 
conflict over the future relations between-the guer-
rillas and Amman, are events v;Phich were not directly 
li`ttked to one another but all served .to substantially 
heighten the tension hi the Arab world 'and had a 
generally radicalizing effect. This is most clearly 
shown by , the .case of. the Libyan leader Colonel 
Gliadhafi, who had k hand in all those bloody 
events, even if only peripherally. In the process he 
drew his chief ally, Egyptian President Sadat, into the 
turmoil and prompted him to take a harder line. v. 
In view of Gliadhafi's premature support for the 
Moroccan rebels, Sadat hoped at first to exert a 
moderating influence on his Libyan colleaglie. But 
after 'a meeting in Marsa Matruh he let himself be 
per'suaded so far by his. junior partner that the three 
heads of the 'planned Libyan-Egyptian-Syrian federa-, 
*11 issued a very �sharp communiquinwhichthcy,: 
expressed their concern at conditions in Morocco 
Gitac.lhafi then played the role of the leading 
opponent of the "leftist,' coup in Khartoum. He even 
went so far as to have ,rivo' leaders of the Sudanese 
"revolution," an-Nur and Hamadallah, taken from a 
British aircraft and arrested. At the same time in 
Tripoli there was a coordination Of the.-iivailable 
Libyan, Egyptian and Sudanese military forcps which 
obviously played an important or Oen decisive role 
in triggering the' ttiuntet-Putsch in Sudan. 'Sadat 
accepted in silence his junior Partner's radical move 
With regard to the British' airliner. Shortly thereafter, 
in his speech to the Egyptian party congress, he 
praised the enthusiasm and energy of the young 
Libyan revolutionaries ;who, as he said, have con-
firmed-his faith' in the "Arab revolution." In the 
question of what the Arab states coUld do to "punish" 
King Hussein for his moves against the Palestinian 
guerrillas and force him to observe the treaties of 
Cairo and Amman, which guarantee the fedayeen 
freedom of movement in Jordan, Ghadhafi once more 
took the initiative in that he called a "summit 
meeting" in Tripoli. After initial hesitation Egypt 
quite suddenly agreed to this step. � , 
In all three' cases a similar sequence may be 
observed: Ghadhafi makes a strong move; Sadat 
seems to hesitate at first, with the intention of urging 
the Libyan leader to moderation, but then chooses 
to go along with his young colleague and more or 
rzib Po

'The
above all else, is 
apparently nearing its end. This, political line, whose 
� chief advocate was Egyptian Premier Fawzi, was 
based on the premise that a � "peaceful solution" 
could be found to the conflict with Israel � a 
Solution embracing a return of all occupied territories 
and a "recognition of the rights of the Palestinians." 
It had been assumed in Cairo that Washington 
could be moved to put pressure on Israel. But the 
belief in this Possibility is dwindling steadily as 
peace efforts drag on lOnger and as the '1972 
election year in the USA approaches, It may be that 
Vawzi and Sadat would prefer to continue pursuing 
the road of. a "peaceful solution" and of promoting 
Egyptian interests, if they did not have to reckon 
with Clhadhafi's age peers in their own country. 
The Libyans have given their military leaders 
the . eloquent generic title of ."the generation' of 
Saut al-Arab.17 This is a new generation of politicians 
who grew. up under the influence of Abdel Nasser's 
famous radiO station, '"Voice of the Arab8;" which 
has now been largely tamed, at a time when its 
commentaries; songs and agitprop speeches were able 
to bring tile entire Arab world to a boil. This made 
many of' them, including Ghadhafi; into "Nasscrites" 
� more radical -than Nasser himself was, at least 
following the Sinai defeat of 1967. The major themes 
of that agitation were 'Arab unity and a campaign 
of revenge against Israel. At that time "Arab social-
ism" 'was still in its infancy, having been worked 
out only after the separation of Syria from Egypt 
� in 1961 pointed to the beginning of the end of the 
� early Nasserite dreams. 
Today, having risen in the ranks of the military 
and taken power in certain countries, the Saut 
� al-Arab generation is trying to fulfil its youthful 
political dreams; This is obvious in the case of 
Ghadhafi. And there must be such "Nasserites" in 
the Egyptian armed forces as well. In their minds 
the deterrent memory of the 'defeat suffered itt the 
Six Day War is dwindling steadily. After all, Egypt 
now has new weapons, newly trained troops and 
stronger Soviet cover than in 1967. Army officers 
know that, without a "victory" against Israel, they

Since the end of the power struggle last spring 
Sadat is dependent on being able to rule his country 
in harmony with the Egyptian army, which supported 
him against the party strongmen and has since been 
his chief source of strength. There are undoubtedly 
various schools of thought in the military, some more 
aggressive and others more cautious, but there are 
ample signs that the sum total of these divergent 
opinions is increasingly that Egypt is now ready to 
take on Israel again. It may be presumed that it is 
largely internal pressure from the army which is 
forcing Sadat to give his support and acquiescence to 
Ghadhafi's policies. 
Iraq and Algeria, the "radical" Arab countries 
which have made it a basic policy goal to outdo 
Egypt, find themselves constrained by the harder 
Egyptian line to be even more "revolutionary," at 
least in their propaganda, and the Syrian regime also 
feels compelled not to appear laggard in this regard 
in the eyes of its subjects.

THE LISTENER, London 
5 August 1971 
Godless Rigmarole 
Going from Western Europe to the Orient, 
a traveller may well feel that after some 
three thousand miles he is midway on his 
journey and entitled to call this strange 
new area the Middle East. But in Russian, 
the term is the Near East. It's not only 
near: it's a neighbour. The Soviet Union 
is the only major power which borders on 
the Near East. Soviet soldiers stand watch 
on the frontier with Turkey and Persia, and 
for a decade after the war the Soviet Union 
could do little but watch the success of the 
-United States in making these countries 
advanee bastions of American defence. But 
since then, the Soviet Union has carried 
out two counter-moVes. The first has been 
a programme of economic aid in Turkey 
and Persia which has led to friendlier rela-
tions. The Shah of Persia has twice been 
received in Russia by the republican com-
rades who ignore the complete ban on the 
Communist Party in Persia and Turkey. 
The second move has been to outflank both 
countries by establishing a Soviet military 
presence in the Arab states of Syria and 
Iraq. A leaf out of the American book. 
The Soviet Union treats Syria and Iraq 
as outposts of her home defence. She uses 
Egypt as a pivot for expansion in the Medi-
terranean, down the Red Sea and in Africa. 
Yet throughout Russia's 15 years in Egypt, 
she has had to accept the ban on the Com-
munist Party there. Even when Khrushchev-
was welcomed triumphantly to the Aswari 
Dam, the most Nasser conceded was the 
release of some hundreds of Communist 
prisoners�who remained under police sur-
veillance. Yemen was even more striking. 
To secure her foothold there, the Soviet 
Union gave small arms lavishly to the old 
Imam, who ruled in medieval tyranny until 
the revolution of 1962. The Russians built 
this tyrant a new port and an airfield, use-
ful then, and now, as Soviet staging-posts to 
the Indian Oco an. Across the Red Sea, 
Sudan came voluntarily into the Soviet 
sphere with the advent of President 
Nilmeiry, and the country is now equipped 
'with Soviet guns and aircraft. But Numeiry 
may be remembering the anxious advice 
given to Nasser by his Chief of Staff during 
one of' his quarrels with Khrushchey:. 
Gamal, Gamal, please remember' the 
spares.' The Arabs know well that the Soviet 
Union does use sanctions against delinquent 
*states. She can withhold spare parts for 
aero-engines, ammunition for guns or 
equipment for economic development. Even 
so, the Communist Party, proscribed 
throughout the area, is from time to time 
ferociously attacked, and the' Soviet re-
action is usually mild. Why is this? Well, 
the pact between Stalin and Hitler should 
have made it clear, once for all, that a mere 
ideological difference would never be 
allowed to stand in the way of Russia's 
national interests. Russia, Communist or 
Czarist, has always felt that her national 
interest and security _demand a powerful 
sphere of influence in what is, to her, the 
Near East. 
The present Russian rulers, continually 
diSputing with Peking, are probably satis-
fied with socialistic regimes in the Arab 
republics, regimes which use Communist 
jargon, nationalise foreign capitalist com-
panies, but do not give doctrinal alle-
giance either to Lenin or to Mao. Moreover; 
the Russians ,realise that the Arab repub-
lics, proud of the independence they have 
achieved from colonial rule, are in no mood 
to accept those limitations. of sovereignty 
which Moscow can impose on East E'uro-
pean states. They will not even forgo, 
national independence to achieve Arab poll-' 
tical unity of which they talk so much. 
The Russians are also well aware that a 
real, more subtle Arab unity already exists 
and presents an innate opposition to Com-
munist ideology. It lies in the whole heri-
tage of Islam. The most obvious opposition 
is between the Muslim's submission to God 
and the Communist's exaltation of man, but 
� there's very much more than that: Arab 
individualism, the strong sense of duty to 
: the family, and also a sense of fatalism. I 
; had a drink recently with an Egyptian 
'engineer at Aswan�he was not an orthodox 
Muslim�and a likable Russian engineer. 
As the Russian left, the Egyptian said: 
Those people, they were barbarians when 
the Arabs were laying the foundations of 
modern learning; and they come to us and 
ask us to believe a godless rigmarole 
elaborated by a renegade German Jew! '

THE WASINGTON POST 
24 October 1971 
Sc 
The writer is director of the Institute 
of Contemporary History in London and 
author of "The Soviet Union and the 
Middle East." This article is adapted 
from his testimony last week before two 
House Foreign Affairs subcommittees. 
r RillE INTEREST of the Soviet 
-a- Union in the Middle East ,is that of 
a superpower (which, unlike the 
United States, is not�or not yet�a 
status quo power) in an adjacent area 
that offers good prospects for extend-
ing its political and military influence, 
Several circumstances have favored 
these designs: The area is militarily 
weak, politically unstable and divided, 
economically, with a few exceptions, 
underdeveloped. Unlike Western Eu-
rope, the Middle East�with the excep-
tion of Turkey�is not part of the 
Western defense system. The risks the 
Soviet Union is likely to incur in its 
forward policy in the area are therefore 
less than in Europe, or indeed in 
many other parts of the world. 
Nevertheless, direct Soviet military 
involvement in the area at present is 
not very likely; at any rate, not sub-
stantially in excess of what there is al-
ready. While the Chinese danger is up-
permost in Soviet minds, Moscow has 
other, more urgent preoccupations: To 
neutralize Western Europe on the 
basis of the status quo, to pursue an 
active role in the Indian subcontinent, 
to bring about the withdrawal of 
American forces from Europe and 
other parts of the world. 
This is not to say that the Middle 
East no longer enjoys high priority in 
Soviet strategy. It simply means that 
at present the Soviet leaders want no 
more than controlled tension in the 
area. Direct Soviet military involve-
ment there, quite apart from the risk 
of a wider conflagration, would defeat 
some of their designs elsewhere, such 
as the European Security Conference 
to which they currently attribute 
ereater importance. The Soviet leaders 
w'siVii 
Tra ve 
ly Walter Laqueur 
seem to have realized that it is impos-
sible to combine a detente even in the 
limited sense (as they interpret it), 
with a war involving Soviet forces in 
the Middle East. 
But two caveats should be added to 
this seemingly reassuring perspective: 
Once the Soviet Union will be under 
less pressure from China, once it has 
made more progress in Europe, once it 
has restored "order" as far as the un-
ruly satellites are concerned, it will no 
doubt pursue a more determined, high-
er-risk policy in the Middle East. The 
second caveat is this: The Soviet 
Union is not in full control in the-
Middle East, not even after having 
concluded a pact with Egypt which 
provides for very close ties indeed be-
tween the two countries. The tension 
may get out of control; one can imag-
ine more than one such scenario. 
The attractions of the Middle East 
as far as the Soviet Union is con-
cerned can be easily defined. Geo-
graphically, proximity is an obvious 
factor. Ten years ago, or even five, one 
would not have mentioned oil in this 
context, for until recently the Soviet 
Union was self-sufficient in this re-
spect. But Soviet (and East European) 
consumption is now outstripping pro-
duction and there is little doubt that 
toward the end of the present decade 
Middle Eastern oil will figure as 
\ ity 
major factor in Soviet strategy. 
But more important than economic 
and even military factors (such as 
bases in Egypt and elsewhere) are po-
litical considerations, even if these 
may appear at first sight somewhat ab-
stract and intangible. Expansion in a 
southward direction has been one of 
the constant factors in Russian foreign 
policy for more than 200 years. Fur-
thermore, and more concretely, if the 
Middle East became an exclusive So-
viet sphere of influence this would 
have far-reaching repercussions on the 
situation in Europe as well as in Africa 
and Asia. It would constitute, in fact, a 
east 
radical change in the global balance of 
power.-

regiTmes on which it can rely_for clos.e

lishe under President Nasser. The 
general assumption behind this policy 
was that power in the Arab countries, 
despite occasional setbacks, is bound 
to pass gradually into the hands of 
people even more closely identified 
with Soviet policies. 
There is no denying that events in 
Egypt, Syria, Algeria and other coun-
tries in the 1960s seemed to bear out 
Soviet expectations, There was a pro-
gressive radicalization in domestic af-
fairs in these countries as weli as 
growing identification with Soviet poll-
'cies: Factories and banks were nation-
alized, important sections of the state 
apparatus were revamped according to 
the Soviet model, etc. But beyond a 
ce :eain point the Soviet Union has so 
far failed to make progress, and there-
fore more sober thoughts have pre-
vailed in Moscow about the rate of po-
litical progress, not only in the Middle 
East but in the Third World in gen-
eral. 
The intrinsic weakness of the area�
political, military, and economic�has 
been mentioned. To this one should 
add the shortsightedness and political 
inexperience of some of its leaders. 
These are no doubt absolutely genuine 
in their frequent professions of un-
swerving devotion to national inde-
pendence. But the result of the policies 
they have pursued has not been to 
strengthen their independence; on the 
contrary, they have become dependent 
upon the Soviet Union to a growing 
degree.

True enough, there have been grow-
ing misgivings in the Arab world�not 
only since the recent events in the 
Sudan. But to assuage these misgivings 
it is usually argued that the Soviet 
Union is a disinterested country which, 
in contrast to the Western imperialists, 
i has no desire to interfere in internal 
Arab affairs. The simple geopolitical 
facts of life have not yet been fully ac-
cepted in the Arab world: The mis-
taken idea still persists that the Soviet 
Union is not only a well meaning but 
also a geographically distant country. 
(The distance between Egypt and the 
Soviet border�not to mention Iraq 
and Syria�is in fact less than that be-
tween Cairo and Khartoum or between 
Cairo and Tripoli.) 
The countries of the Middle East 
have been sidetracked by their inter-
nal quarrels to such an extent that the .1 
.question whether an Egyptian (or Syr-
ian or Iraqi) victory over Israel would 
:he worthwhile if it could be achieved 
:only at the price of Egypt's independ- � 
ence is brushed aside as irrelevant. 
Whatever Arab feelings about Israel, it 
does not constitute a serious threat to 
the independence and sovereignty of 
the Arab countries, for the simple rea-
son that a small country cannot 
threaten their very existence. More-
over there is, for obvious reasons, no 
"Israeli party" in Cairo, Damascus, 
and Baghdad which could seize power 
from within. 
' But there is a "Russian party" 
which, as recent events have shown, is 
a strong contender for leadership. Yet 
in most Arab eyes Israel is. still the 
main, not the lesser, danger: Somehow, 
it is argued, they will get rid of the 
Russians once Israel is defeated and 
the world will then regain its full 
independence and freedom of action. 
A is a striking example of what some 
Marxist philosophers call "false con-
sciousness." 
Getting In Deeper 
I.UT THE MORE DEEPLY the So. 
viet Union has become invo!-.:,-'d in 
tie Middle East, the more comp;icated 
its position. To a certain extent this 
was an inevitable process: While the 
West was "in" and the Soviet Union 
"out" in the Middle East, Moscow did 
not have to take sides�just as it could 
be on .friendly terms with both India 
and Pakistan. The West had the mo-
nopoly of committing mistakes, 
whereas the Soviet Union could do no 
wrong. 
Progressive Involvement in Arab af-
fairs meant that Moscow has had to 
choose sides in the main existing con-
flicts. The existence of communist par-
ties and pro-Russian factions in the 
Arab world is the main bone of conten-
tion but by no means the only one. The 
Soviet Union cannot at one and the 
same time support the Suclaen-
eral Nimert and those who want to 
overtERViiis regime; it can be tried 
�but the attempt is bound to fail. 
- If the Soviet Union were just a big 
power such a dilemma would not exist. 
But since it is also the head of the 
world Communist movement, it cannot 
opt out entirely from its commitments 
to its local followers without causing 
fatal damage to the legitimacy of its 
claims for leadership�and this at a 
time when its authority as the leader 
of the Communist camp is in dispute 
anyway. 
Soviet policy makers have become 
reconciled to the fact that political 
power in the Arab world will remain 
for a long time to come in the hands of 
military juntas, rather than political 
parties supporting Moscow. This, from 
the Soviet point of view, r�_notindtself 
a major disaster. Anyivay, the Soviet 
Uniob -elfin� longer count on the auto-
matic support of other Communist par-
ties, unless it also happens to be in 
physical domination of the country 
concerned. Albania is Communist and 
Fin,land is not, but there is little doubt 
that Soviet policy makers vastly prefer 
the Helsinki over the Tirana govern-
ment. To give another example: Many 
Communist parties dissented from the 
Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 
1968 whereas the military governments 
of Egypt, Syria or Algeria supported it 
without reservation. Unlike purely 
Ideologically motivated supporters, the 
clients can he relied upon to support 
Soviet policy in a critical situation, be-
cause they need Soviet help, 
And yet, there is a basic element of 
uncertainty with regard to the political 
orientation of these military regimes. 
Ten years ago Soviet policy makers 
wc. far more optimistic about the in-
tentions and political prospects of the 
military dictatorships in the Third 
Ifforld than at present. The reasoning 
at the time was briefly this: Military 
leaders such as Nasser were "radical 
democrats in uniform." Even though 
their outlook was as yet beclouded by 
certain "petty bourgeois" prejudices, it 
was assumed that the "objective logic" 
of events would carry them into much 
closer collaboration with the Commu-
nists and the Soviet Union than they 
had originally envisaged and intended. 
For they were not acting in a politi-
cal vacuum; once the means of produc-
tion had been nationalized and capital-
ism was on the way out, the ruling offi-
cers, needing a political mass basis, 
were bound to turn to "scientific so-
cialism"; i.e., to the Communists. For 
only these could provide the doctrine 
and the political know-how needed for 
the mobilization of the masses. 
In recent years it has been realized 
that this appraisal has been overopti-
mistic. Military leaders can turn "left" 
and "right" in rapid succession, with 
equal ease, to apply terms of classifica-
'ton which should be used as sparingly 
as possible with reference to Middle 
Eastern politics. As as result thire is 
now hardly veiled disappointment in 
Moscow about the agonizingly slow 
progress made by communism in parts 
of the Third World, about the fact that 
army officers may be power-hungry, or 
"career motivated" even if they con-
stantly use the anti-imperialist politi-
cal rhetoric of the Communist camp. 
These shortcomings and "inconsist-
encies" of the juntas are more fre-
quently attributed to the "petty bour-
geois background" of the military rul-
ers. But there is nothing "petty bour-
geois" about a man who was born ;n a 
Bedouin tent and now disposes   
= � 
bil-
lions of dollars such as Libya's Colonel 
Khadafi. 
The real explanation for the appar-
ent "inconsistencies" is much easier: 
In the struggle for power between 
rival officers' groups, ideological con-
siderations usually play a secondary 
role. Wonalization of industries and 
banks_ aticri=a- rtan reform -1?y_ no 
means IWd to socialism oi comnrunk:m. 
The decisive issue in the Third World, 
Including the Arab ccuntries, is not 
whether the banks have been national-
ized but in whose hands political power 
has come to rest: who is running the 
state. 
Series of Dilemmas 
IN THIS CONTEXT Soviet po;cy 
in the Middle East has to face 
several dilemmas to which so far it 
has not been able to find a satisfactory 
answer. The first has already been 
hinted at: According to the Soviet 
blueprint the progressive military rul-
ers/ were gradually to "democratize 
political life," i.e., hand over power to 
the avant-garde, the Communists. But 
in fact the colonels and the majors 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
have not shown the slightest inten-
tion to do so. They have been deal-
ing ruthlessly with those challenging 
their power. According to Soviet ex-
pectations the military were to be poli-
ticized, i.e., made to share power with 
civilian leaders, In fact, the opposite 
has happened: Political life has been 
militarized, with Syria as a striking ex-
ample. 
True enough, in view of the weak-
ness of political structures in the Arab 
world a handful of determined people 
stand a good chance to make a success-
ful bid for power, provided, of course, 
they are in control of army units or 
the political police. And, with a little 
luck, they may keep it. But a pro-Com-
munist or pro-Russian coup in one 
country is almost certainly bound to 
provoke suspicion and antagonism in 
others and to give rise to counter-
forces: Victory in one country will 
mean defeat elsewhere. In other 
words: Unless the pro-Russian forces 
make steady and even progress in all 
the key countries of the Arab world, 
the overall balance as far as the Soviet 
Union is concerned may be negative. 
The Arab-Israeli dispute has become 
increasingly problematical from the 
Soviet point of view. Earlier on it un-
doubtedly facilitated the Soviet 'ad-
vance in the Middle East. It was not 
the only, nor the single most impor-
tant factor. The forces supporting the 
Soviet Union have made their greatest 
strides' in those parts of the Middle 
East least affected by the Arab-Israeli 
dispute such as the Sudan. But in re-
cent years the conflict has become a 
major obstacle as far as the further 
progress of communism is concerned. 
While the conflict lasts, the overriding 
aim of defeating the common enemy�
Israel�narrowly circumscribes Com-
munist action or tends altogether to 
prevent it. For the Communists cannot 
afford to ignore the appeals for na-
tional solidarity and for a truce both 
inside the Arab countries and between 
them. Soviet observers assume, not 
perhaps altogether wrongly, that but 
for the continuation of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, power in the Arab capitals 
may well have passed from the "bour-
geois nationalist elements" into the 
hands of the "radical democrats" if not 
the Communists. Ceetainly the  Arab 
world would be in a state of Tar 
greater internal turmoil' but for the 
struggiehich acts as a 
stahlfiTing factor. 
Soviet leaders could have instructed 
their followers according to the basic 
tenets of Leninist strategy to trans-
form the war against Israel into a "rev-
olutionary war." They have not done 
so, partly because the Communists are 
too weak, given the present balanee of 
power in the Arab world, partly be-
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642r 
cause sucn a course ot action, ii mute 
cessful, would result in a state of an-
archy which might well benefit the 
pro-Chinese rather than the pro-Soviet 
elements among the radicals in the 
Arab world. 
Options Are Limited 
rrHESE ARE SOME of the sources 
I. of conflict facing the Soviet Union 
in its policy vis-a-vis the Arab coun-
tries. There is every reason to assume 
that these contradictions will loom 
even larger in the years ahead. 
But what are the options open to .So-
viet policy? Developments in Alggia 
over the last few years have been dis-
appointing from the Soviet point of 
view, Khadafi's regime .in_Libya and 
Nimeri's in the Sudan are at present 
openly anti-Communist, and Sadat's 
rule constitutes a' retreat in compari-
son with Nasser's. Soviet policy mak-
ers cannot possibly be very happy 
about the new Arab federation. For its 
political significance, if any, will be 
that of a reactionary "Holy Alliance" 
preventing revolutionary uprisings in 
its component parts. It is the Arab 
version of the Brezhnev doctrine�
stood on its head. The fact that it 
might be applied against Jordan, for 
Instance, does not offer much comfort. 
Soviet expectations that military dic-
tatorships cannot hold on to power for 
long because they lack political know-
how and a mass basis have not so far 
been borne out by the course of 
events. These assumptions may still be 
correct in the long run; Nasser, toc, 
.had his quarrels with the Communists 
and the Soviet Union , but mended his 
ways towards the end of his rule. But 
It cannot be taken for granted that the 
present rulers will emulate Nasser; 
moreover, there is no certainty at all 
that the military leaders in their 
search for political allies will turn to 
the Communists for help. If the Soviet 
Union should decide to support the op-
position to the military regimes, they 
will be inviting open conflict, risking 
their past gains in the area and even a 
restoration of closer relations between 
these leaders and the West. For de-
spite the vituperation heaped on the 
West, it cannot be excluded that the 
help of the West will be looked for by 
military dictators facing defeat by the 
Communists. 
If, on the other hand, the Soviet 
Union and its supporters in the Arab 
countries should prefer a policy of 
wait-and-see, on the assumption that 
the political constellation will be,more 
auspicious at some future date '(after 
another lost war against Israel., or the 
continuation of the military stalemate 
and the ensuing frustration, or some 
economic setback, or the growth 
of popular discontent for yet other rea-
sons) they will be in danger of being 
outflanked from the left by more ex-
treme factions. 
No Guarantee of Control 
I T CANNOT BE STRESSED too 
often that since the Soviet Union 
is not in full control as far as events in 
the Middle East are concerned, not 
even over the actions of its followers 
and clients, there is always a Very con-
siderable elenient 'of uncertainty. It 
would be foolish for this, as well as for 
other reasons, to assume that the So-
viet,leadership will automatically pur-
sue a cautious policy simply because 
this is at the present moment in its 
. best interest. Moreover, caution in the 
Middle East context means the contin-
uation of "controlled tension"�bta 
there is .no guarantee that tension will 
not go out of control. Nor is the Soviet 
Union condemned to prolonged inac-
tivity. The treaty of friendship be-
tween the Soviet Union and Egypt 
concluded in May, 1971, undoubtedly 
constitutes a step forward from the So-
viet point of view. More recently, Pres-
ident Sadat had to sign a document 
,condemning anti-communism, i.e. the 
policy pursued by his colleagues in 
'Khartoum dnd Tripoli, not to mention 
his own action vis-a-vis the Russian 
party in Cairo. 
At present the main aim of Soviet 
policy in the Middle East remains, to 
summarize, the consolidation of its 
gains, and at the same time the crea-
tion of a political climate In which the 
replacement of the present rulers by 
others more closely identified with So-
viet ambitions in the area will be pos-
sible with a minimum of friction. The 
longer-range aim is the transformation 
of the military regimes into political 
coalitions dominated (or � at least 
guided by) the Communists. But this 
remains; for the time being, a fairly re-
mote prospect inasmuch as the key 
countries in the Arab world are con-
cerned.. 
Soviet policy towards Israel will not 
undergo any basic change, though it is 
quite possible, and indeed likely, that 
there will be occasional friendly ges-
tures towards Jerusalem in order to 
impress the Arabs that they must not 
take Soviet assistance for granted in 
all circumstances. 
Altogether, the Middle East is an 
area in world politics to which Soviet 
commentators apply the term slozhni 
(complicated) more and more fre-
quently. Ten years ago they were more 
confident of having all the answers.

FOR BACKGROUND USE ONLY November 1971 
WHITHER POLAND? THE DECEMBER PARTY CONGRESS 
The Sixth Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party 
(Communist) will open 6 December, one year before scheduled and 
one year after a workers' rebellion toppled the regime of 
Wladyslaw,Gomulka, who had come to power as a reformer 15 years 
earlier. The unusually early data, the Party says, is to get 
new programs underway. It is more likely that the new Party 
Secretary, Edward Gierek, wishes to move quickly to consolidate 
his position, to distract attention from the upcoming anniversary 
of the December rebellion, and to persuade the Polish people, 
by sheer busyness that some progress is being made toward improv-
ing the deplorable economic situation. 
Guidelines for the Congress have been approved by a 
September plenum and made public. The greatest emphasis is on 
the same economic problems which brought Gierek to power in 
January 1071. The guidelines give at least the appearance of 
reform whatever their effectiveness proves to be. Centralized 
economic planning is to be retained while production and 
executive:responsibility are to lie with regional officials and 
industrial associations. The Party's meddling in economic 
operations is to be discouraged- Increased productivity and 
higher living standards are given a top priority. The guidelines 
encouragea "hospitable climate" for the growth of small enter-
prises. There has also been a notable effort to popularize the 
regime: people are urged to participate in pre-Congress 
discussions and to make suggestions; an effort has been made to 
humanize the regime. 
Such promises are almost as old as the Polish Communist 
regime itself. In 1956, Wladyslaw Gomulka was installed as 
Party chief in a wave of anti-Stalinism. He embarked on a 
decentralizing reform program to undo some of the worst effects 
of years of forced industrialization and collectivization 
modeled on the equally brutal Soviet effort of the '30's. The 
reforms were abandoned by 1959 at the expense of the Polish 
consumer. Some familiar Communist jargon in the 1971 guidelines 
points to continuing political restrictions which would nullify 
any intended reforms: "democratic centralism" (or, Party rule 
without popular participation), "strengthening the leading role 
of the Party" (or, continued political domination by the Party 
of all aspects of Polish life), "no free play for alien political 
tendencies" (or, the Soviet Union is to be our model). 
It is precisely the degree to which the Poles adhere to the 
Soviet model of economic development which will determine the 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
success or failure of the program. If Gierek, the clever and 
efficient former Silesian Party leader, who is widely regarded as 
a pragmatist and a technocrat, has examined Gomulka's failures, 
talked with Polish workers, studied production failures and 
alternative organizational procedures, he is well aware of the 
problems and weaknesses of Polish economic institutions. He will 
have found every proof that the Party-dominated economic machinery 
(following the Soviet example) has failed to improve living 
standards or achieve a viable economy. The failure is as evident 
in Poland as it is in the USSR. Yet there is little reason to 
hope that Party domination of the economy is to be scrapped. 
Many factors will influence the Polish decision concerning 
the Soviet model. Reforms worth considering, such as the 
decentralization of planning and essential decision-making, giving 
workers the right to participate in the management of enterprises 
Gas in Yugoslavia), permitting more play to market forces, etc, 
all carry risks, Polish leaders dare not relinquish too much 
Party control br deviate too far from the Soviet model in other 
respects as well, fo fear of Soviet intervention. Soviet 
requirements for integration of the East European economies, as 
outlined in the August meeting of the Council foT Mutual Economic 
Assistance (Comecon) will also hamper the development of the 
Polish economy, no matter what solutions Gierek may wish to 
entertain, 
It may be that the Soviets will permit Gierek some leeway in 
his effort to revitalize the stagnant Polish economy. Last 
December's worker revolt against the workers' Party and State 
was a traumatic experience for the Communist world -- an experience 
which they fear may repeat itself in Poland and elsewhere in the 
Soviet sphere.! 
In the meantime, Gierek has used the past year to rid the 
Party of deadwood.. But in the end, such half-measures, encourag-
ing words, and superficial reforms are not likely to bring about 
the radically needed improvements so long as the Soviet model 
must be followed in its essential forms. 
Publicly Gierek and the new leaders blame all Polish prob-
lems on the Gomulka regime, apparently believing that they will 
thereby relieve themselves somewhat of the need to make solid 
reforms. Gierek has said that the major weakness of the 
Gomulka regime-- and the principal cause of the uprising --
was its isolation and inability to gauge the depth of popular 
discontent. Without facing the fact that despots tend to be told 
what they want to hear, Gierek implies that public discussion of 
Party programsmight improve their content. Yet the man in the 
street is well: aware that it is Party control which throttles 
progress and that no amount of discussion is likely to lessen that 
control.

A Polish Communist economist, Wlodimierz Brus, writing in 
the Italian Communist journal Rinascita of 25 June 1971 described 
the deadening effect of following the Soviet model as Gomulka 
had done for 15 years (may the same words not apply to Gierek 
some years hence): 
". . . it is not enough to denounce and condemn even 
with the greatest good will, the errors and distortions of 
the Stalinist period; neither is it enough to effect certain 
changes, if those changes deal only with the surface and neither 
attack the root of the problems nor create conditions for a 
continual adaptive process." 
"In a certain sense, the whole history of the unsuccess-
ful attempts undertaken during the past 15 years to effect 
economic reform in Poland can serve as an example of the 
negative influence of the existing political mechanism on 
the economic processes." 
The World will be watching the December Congress and subse-
quent actions to see whether Gierek attacks the roots of the 
problem, offers any truly basic and innovative reforms, establishes 
any responsive organizations or takes any non-Soviet initiatives 
in the political and economic areas. Or whether this regime will 
be just another proof of the truth of Polish Marxist philospher 
Leszek Kolakowski's observation that "...when the (Gpmaanist) 
leaders affirm their. wish to ensure technical progress and an 
improvement in the material situation of the population, they 
are generally sincere. But these intentions are in contradiction 
to their desire to reinforce the monopoly of uncontrolled power 
in all fields of social life. (See attachment for other penetrat-
ing observations by Kolakowski on the self-defeating mechanisms 
built into the Soviet system of socialism.)

NEW YORK TIMES 
5 September 1971 
Polish Party Congress 
To Be Held Year Early 
Special 10 the New 'rock Times 
� WARSAW, Sept. 4�The Pol-
ish Communist party has de-
cided to convene its Sixth Con-
zress on Dec. 6, a. year ahead 
.of schedule. 
Edward Gierek, the party 
leader, announced this today in 
Warsaw at a special meeting of 
Ithe Central Committee.He said 
:the Congress, to be attended by 
'leaders of other ComMunist 
parties, ' would focus on the 
:Polish economy. 
Mr. Gierek, who assumed 
power from Wladyslaw,Gomul-
ka last December after a week 
of riot's protesting economic 
conditions, outlined several in-
novations in a major address to 
party leaders. 
He said the traditional system 
of presenting "detailed and 
fixed drafts of the proposed 
economic plan" had been aban-
doned. Instead, the program 
will be open for discussion and 
alteration.. 
The intention, he said, is to 
produce a more realistic pro-
gram --- previous preliminary 
drafts were "hardly readable,' 
he said � and to encourage 
wider participation. 
Experts to Be Consulted 
Non-Communist experts and 
others who have assisted in the 
draft commissions will be en-
couraged .to remain with the 
program as it is given final 
shape, he said. 
The program will be handled 
in its last stages by "problem 
commissions," or groups of ex-
perts, Mr. Gierek said. 
Previously, delegates have 
been obliged to sit through dis-
cussions of the entire economic 
program, a time-consuming prO-
cedure that. produced little in 
the way of constructive com-
ment. 
Mr. Gierek sought to empha-
size that the new Congress 
would be considerably more 
open than any previous one. 
The last was held in 1968. 
In the past, he said, party 
leaders told delegates "what 
would be done." This discour-
aged discussion and action, he 
said. "We are trying to present 
an analysis of the problems 
facing the nation, state and 
party," he said. 
Since taking over, Mr. Gierek 
has altered the economic pro-
gram to aid consumers and the, 
lowest paid workers. 
' Calls for New Members :I 
Today, he stressed the need. 
to draw new members into the 
party, especially from the ranks, 
of workers. He said the Cen-
tral Committee was determined 
. to "strengthen the workers' nu-
cleus at all party levels." 
His pledge follows the near 
completion of a purge of the 
party's middle and lower ranks. 
Officials have been anxious to 
remove indecisive, inactive and 
politically unreliable members 
before delegates and selected 
for the congress. 
Party leaders began the in�
tensive stage of their reform' 
early this summer. The screen-
ing was conducted throurth in-
terviews with party members 
at the factory and village level. 
Many party members and: 
some officials have since been 
removed from the rolls, usually 
for inactivity, or have been ex-
pelled, probably for administra-
tive or ideological errors. 
The process reached the 
county level last month and, 
according to accounts in news-
papers, was completed at the 
province level in the last few 
days. 
Indifference is Reported 
Unofficial reports in recent 
months have indicated that 
party leaders are facing indif-
ference and even hostility in 
their efforts to introduce re-
forms and to secure pledges of 
increased production. 
A leading economist who is 
!working on Mr. Gierek's reform 
.plan said that many middle-
level bureaucrats were reluc-
tant to change their ways. He 
told a Western diplomat that 
they "are still waiting to see 
if Gierek survives." 
Some workers who were un-
happy in their dealings with 
party leaders under Mr. Gamut-
ka are reportedly responding 
'to pleas, for greater productiv-
ity with demands for increased 
pay. They are being told that 
the higher pay can coma only 
.from increased productivity. 
� Trybuna Ludu, the official 
party newspaper, provided 
lengthy accounts of party meet-. 
inks this week in Bydgoszoz, 
Kielce, Lublin, Szczecin and 
Wroclaw. Most of the meetings 
were attended by politburo 
membera.. 
The newspaper spoke of the, 
Meetings as having revealed 
"still existing ineptitude in 
personnel policy, bad organiza-
tion work and many shortcom-
ings in human relations." It 
said that "higher ideological 
criteria" would be required for 
admitting new members. 
In Kielce, it reported, party 
leaders had spoken with every-
third party member or candi-
date. In Opole, where the party 
net on provincial level or. Mon-
day, Trybuna Ludu said " a re-
view of paray ranks" had led 
to "3,864 people being ceossed 
off the. records and 71.9 ex-
pelled from the party." 
"Six Months After the Baltic Crisis," by Wlodimierz Brus, inRinacita 
(theoretical journal of the Italian Communist Party), 25 June 1971. 
Half 4 year has already elapsed. The "December events" 
in Poland disappeared some time ago from front pages in the 
international press. Yet it would be damaging for socialism 
and for the international workers' movement if the great ex-
periences arising out of those events in Poland were to be 
erased or blurred by the passage of time. This concern is 
not imaginary but reel, not only because the law of "pante rei" 
[Everything- is in a state of flux] is universal and inexorable, 
but also because of the very understandable tendency to for-
get what is unpleasant and difficult; and the Polish events 
were unpleasant and difficult for the Pomtunist Party in both 
socialist and nonsocialist countries. Yet it is nevertheless 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15.0O2062642 
necessary to profit by the .,time elapsed to attempt a concrete, 
scientific analysis, which can be the more profound and 
courageous by being free of the emotions reigning at the 
time. 
Significance of the Working Class Demonstrations  
In the long run, the essential significance of last 
December's events in Poland lies in several simple facts:-
1. The demonstrations were authentic workers' demon-
strations; they involved the proletariat of the large indus-
tries. The former government and party leadership's initial 
attempt to present the demonstrations as the work of "hooligans 
and asocial elements" collapsed noisily. Since then, no one 
has ventured to publicly deny the genuine workers' character of 
the demonstrations. Furthermore, no one has _sought to connect 
the demonstrations with activities of. the circles of domestic 
or foreign opposition; in particular, accusations Of revision-
ion have not been made. Leaving aside the problem of the under-
lying origin of the .December events, it can thus be said that 
the spontaneous character of the-movement has been recognized, 
although at the same time it seemed to demonstrate a -really 
surprising capacity, under the circumstances, to organize itself 
rapidly and efficiently, and in such a way as to conform to 
the traditions of the Polish working clasS. 
2. .The immediate effect of the workers'  demonstrations 
and thetragic bloodshed was a change in Poland's political  
leadershin. Wladyslaw Gomulka and his closest collaborators, 
the politicians responsible for governing the country for the 
last 15 years,\who in a certain sense symbolized that period, 
were forced to leave the political scene. 
Following the December demonstrations, and under the 
pressure exerted by the working class in the succeeding months, 
price increaseS were cancelled (although up until the last 
moment justification for the necessity of maintaining them 
was sought); the policy o2 freezilag salaries and stipends was , 
abandoned (introduced under the guise of a so-called new system 
of economic incentives); essential changes in favor of the 
consumer were effected in the economic plan for 1971; and so 
on. . 
These facts taken together testify to the depth and 
range of the social conflict with which Poland was afflicted. 
We are no longer dealing with the theoretical problem of re-
cognizing the existence of conflicts within socialist 
countries in an abstract way; but with a concrete framework, 
a tangible one for these conflicts -- a framework which im-
poses conclusions of a general character. Add to that, 
because of the validity of the Marxist method if it is ef-
fectively adapted to realities .in the socialist countries, 
that the conclusions from the Polish events cannot be lim-
ited strictly to the problem of the particular personalities 
2 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
or the errors committed on this particular occasion. The 
result is that it is not enough to denounce and condemn, 
even. with the greatest good will, the "errors and distor-
tions" of the Stalinist period; neither is it enough to af-
fect certain changes, if those changes deal only with the  
surface and neither attack the root of the problems nor cre-
ate conditions for a continual adaptive process. The 
politicians who were forced to leave the government helm in 
December 1970 part-icipated actively in the communist-resist, 
ance to the Nazi occupation of Poland; three of them --
GomuLlza,'Kliszko, and especially Spychalski -- had been per-
secuted during the Stalinist period. The fact that the 
triumphal return of Wladyslaw Gomulka to the political scene 
in October 1956 took place with the rallying cry, "Never again 
a ',Poznan," takes on symbolic, almost tragic, dimensions if it 
is borne irlmind that his inglorious disappearance from the 
political scene after governing for 15 years took place once 
again u_n.deripressure from the workers, this time even strong-
er pressure, and unfortunately at the cost of an even great-
er number of victims. The inquiry is closed, although there 
would.be.nOreason to doubt that Gomulkaa-really wished to 
avoid repeating the Poznan experience and was deeply con-
vinced he was doing everything to that end. 
,The conclusion is so obvious that it seems quite un-
necessary to formulate it: in the functioning mechanism  
of the existing system in Poland -- and it seems that this  
system does not differ essentially from that existing in  
:other Eastern European socialist counties -- there must have  
been factors which did not favor the overcoming of social  
and economic tonflicts, but on  the contrary concealed them; 
,(:) that after a certain period of time those conflicts emerged  
with greater force, and exploded. As a Marxist, I think that 
this is the only basis for explaining to ourselves and to 
others the causes of the tragic events and the paradox of fate 
which befell several eminent personalities in the Polish 
workers' movement. 
An Attempt To Define the Causes.of the 'Crisis  
_Ari exhaustive answer to the question of what the causes 
were for .the growth of the conflicts-which blossomed in the 
explosion will of course. require a many-faceted analysis. 
The more the climate of research is a free climate of true 
research, the more effective the analysis will be.. It is 
no longer 'useful to cling to defeated schemes. The attempt

The writer holds the principal causes of the trouble  
to be in the political mechanism. This statement should 
not be surprising, inasmuch as in a socialist country --
where the. principal means of production have been national-
ized and the state has shaped the economy as a whole by means 
of a central economic plan �.political power  and the meznoe  
of government become  an inseparable element, and perhaps the 
central element, of the  system of productive relationships. 
Without taking into account the characteristic of the state 
and of the measure of real participation of the popular 
masses in the exercise of power, it is impossible to define 
the essence of the ownership of the means of production which 
is the basis of every system of productive relationships. It 
could therefore be expected that under these conditions the 
classical Marxist theory of development through the manifest-
ing and surmounting of conflicts between the needs of the de-
velopment of productive forces and the character of the pro-
ductive relationships would find its expression in the con-
flicts between the political mechanism and the needs of the 
economy. It does not seem too difficult to prove this 
thesis: we shall limit ourselves to events in recent Polish 
history. 
The modern theory of decision-making, as is well 
.known, attaches great importance to the creation of premises 
for a rapid, free, and -- extremely important -- potentially 
genuine flow of information. This factor increases in im-
portance as the importance of the decision to be made and 
the level Of its consequences increase. From this point of 
view, the narrowness and the degree of distortion of the 
information at the disposal of the former leadership of 
the Polish Unified Workers' Party (PZPR) in making the de-
cision to raise food prices in December 1970 (right before 
Christmas, to make matters :worse) is truly surprising. To 
judge from statements made after the December events, the  
party leadership was not only in the dark about the real: 
economic situation, but  also about the political climate  
prevailing both among broad strata of the population and in  
high party and government circles. It has been learned that 
the centers of decision were not receiving adequate input 
regarding.the:situation. From materials published after the 
December events, it appears .that many members of the central 
committee, of the government, of the trade union leadership, 
and even members of the political office and the, secretariat 
of the PZPR criticized, and perhaps even strongly objected 
to, the proposed decisions. .Yet there is no proof of any 
attempt whatsoever on anyone's part to get these decisions 
reversed; there is no proof that any energetic action was 
taken. against them. The issue here is not to evaluate or 
pass judgment on the politicians for not having done so in 
time; the problem lies in a political 'mechanism in which  
It becomes the rule not  to furnish to higher offices an  
4ta,,, of -tentially true information, but to furnish instead  
information adhering  to the point of view (previously 'ex-
pressed, or anticipated) of the superior.

The total paralysis of the flow of information which 
manifestad itself last December in Poland -- completely in-
comprehensible for anyone who was not present -- was the 
result of an experience of several years' duration. This 
experience inescapably taught that, from a personal point 
of view, political conformism paid off, independently of 
actual social results -- while one suffered personally 
for criticism. As far as the economic sector is concerned, 
one of the most characteristic examples of this phenomenon 
was the unsuccessful attempt to hold discussions on the 
projected economic 5-year plan for 1966-1970, whose imple-
mentation led to, among other things, the tragic finale of 
last December. The projected plan, in particular as it af-
fected agricultural policies and foreign trade of agricul-
tural products, contained concepts which arDused great 
uneasiness and opposition from some economists concerned 
with the negative consequences for meat prodUction and thus 
for the people's standard of living. This took place in 
1964, in the period o-f public discussion officially opened 
prior to the Fourth PZPR Congress. There were attempts to 
express these reservations publicly, especially since the 
reservations did not have to do with the principles of 
socialism but rather with some concrete economic policy 
solutions. One of Poland's most noted and international-
ly famous economists expressed his point of view in writing, 
not limiting himself merely to criticism, but at the same 
time formulating concrete alternative solutions. The 
party summit promptly reacted in a negative and exceptional-
ly violent manner. Every attempt at concrete discussion 
was immediately cut off, and no party group -- including the 
congress-- even considered the possibility of studying 
the indicated alternativee. After this experience, it is 
therefore logical that it would not have been possible to 
expect :a ground of Independent economic appraisal to exist. 
In a 'certain sense, the whole history of the unsuccess-
ful attempts undertaken during% the past 15-years to effect  
economic reform in Poland can serve as an example of the  
negative inl.luence of the existing political mechanism on  
the econom.-17c processes. -1t.goes without saying that economic 
.reform-cannot be considered a panacea for all economic dif-
ficulties'but-even within these limitations the results of 
economic-reform would certainly have a positive importance. 
'This is 'particularly true for a country like Poland, which 
must count first of all upon mobilizing the so-called sources 
-of-intenaive development: increased labor productivity; im-
-proved txpleitation.of.rawHmaterials and resources; improved 
adaptation Of production structure to demand structure; more 
� efficient investment processes; and so on. Poland was among' 
the first socialist countries to develop advanced projects 
for economic reform, since efforts to implement them 'com-
menced immediately after October 1956. These projects were 
.now and again in their program speeches declared their re-
peated willingness to put them.into.effect. But nothing was  
done in practice, primarily because of concern, that reforms  
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
could eventually have c  limiting effect on the autocratic  
and arbitrary nature of the political mechanism. Particularly 
unfavorable was the attitude toward the attempt to link 
changes in the functioning of the economic system with the 
development of self-administration among the workers. The 
role of the workers' councils which spontaneously, arose in 
the factorie:: during the "Polish October" became in practice 
reduced to a purely formal aspect, and the councils com-
pletely lost the characteristics of genuine representation 
of the workers in the economic administrative system. In 
1970 the former Fan leadership sought to exploit the ideas 
of reform in order to conceal a rigid deflationary policy, 
aiming in practice at freezing salaries and stipends for 
a minimum period of 2 years. The so-called new system of 
economic incentives which was sUpposed to have begun func-
tioning at the beginning of 1971 --.cancelled as of 20 
December 1970 -- could thus only have jeopardized the idea 
of economic reform in the eyes of public opinion. 
The cited examples relate to problems connected di-
rectly or indirectly with the economic causes of the events 
of the past few months. Their significance, however, is of 
a more general character, in that they clearly demonstrate 
the role of restraint exercised by a defective political 
mechanism in the process of development of the productive  
forces and their social-implications. It, is worthwhile to 
understand, particularly in this age of the so-called in-
formative revolution, that the formation of an adequate 
information system, in the broad sense of that concept, 
requires not only adequate solutions of a technical nature, 
but also the right political conditions. 
The Workers Demonstrations and the Intellectual Situt:tion 
� The conflict between the needs of economic develop-
ment and the inadequate mechanism is of a dynamic rather . 
than a static nature: if it does not result in an adequate 
adaptation of the political mechanism (and its progressive 
democratization), it becomes exacerbated. From this point 
of view, it is necessary in the light of the events of 
December 1970 to return once more to the events of March 
1968 in Poland.. 
I consider it proper to give the reader a suggestion 
before approaching this problem: Do not look for or make 
analogies between demonstrations in intellectual circles 
(primarily students) in the West and in Poland. The attempt 
at analogy cannot hold up, since the causes of the demon-
strations were due to concrete and thus different reasons 
in the West and in Poland. In Poland in 1968 the protest of 
a good part of the students and intellectuals was an expres-
sion of unrest owing to the growing awareness of an involuted 
process in the political mechanism, inconsistent both with 
socialist ideas about individual freedom and with the purely 
practical needs of social and economic development discussed 
6

above. The demand to restore the fundamental liberties of 
the citizen, and particularly to abandon the practice of 
Partial and even false information, was at the center of 
those demonstrations, which at the same time already showed 
that it was not a question of undermining the foundations of 
the socialist regime, but on the contrary of safeguarding ' 
it from the dangerous upheavals which inevitably result from 
political involution. "There is no bread without freedom," 
the students' rallying crying in March 19�8, expressed in a  
very concise way the idea of the connections between the  
economy and the political system in a socialist country. 
1December 1970 gave very quick confirmation to this idea, 
unfortunately in a very painful way. 
. The response of the Polish political leadership 
orces at that time proved extremely inauspicious in its 
consequences. It was decided to exploit the students' and 
"intellectuals' demonstrations to definitively cut off all of 
the actual and potential sources of independent criticism. 
As often happens in such cases, it was evidently held that 
the trouble itself-did not lie in the conflicts of real 
life, but rather in the attempts, minimal as they might be, 
to call a spade a: spade. 
' A vast range of instruments was used to realize this 
plan, commencing with an exceptionally brutal and repressive 
action, utilizing the monopoly of mass information media to. 
-completely distort the true character and intentions of . 
the students' and intellectuals' demonstrations. This is 
not the place to analyze in depth the methods adopted; it 
must be said, however, that this ideological campaign was 
fought in ways never yet touched upon on such a broad and 
open scale, not even during the darker period of the Stalin-
ist purges. (Here one thinks especially of the so-called 
anti-Zionist campaign which in Poland was generally :inter-
preted as a direct blow aimed conscientiously against the 
few -- but politically relatively active Poles of Jewish 
origin.) A6 a result, they succeeded not only in eliminat-
ing from the public scene those who were directly involved in 
the criticism of existing reality, but they also succeeded in 
intimidating the Whole intellectual Community. To a certain 
degree, and'thanka to the above-mentioned ideological campaign, 
they even succeeded. in separating the working class from the 
protesting students and intellectuals. 
In the light of the ,events which followed, it can be 
said that they succeeded in obtaining results in conformity 
with these :wishes, in the sense that in December 1970 the 
intellectual community, and particularly its official re-
presentatives, did .not raise any protest ,even during the 
most dramatic moments. This fact does not seem destined. 
to become part of the heritage of positive experiences of 
socialism. :Very great importance is attached instead to 
another fact --namely that from March 1968 onward there was 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
heard in Poland no further critical voice against the policy 
(econotic policy in particular) of the leadership of the country 
at that time, although -- as it is today generally and of-
ficially admitted -- various decisions were often bad and 
arbitrary. On the other hand, the connection between lack of 
criticism and the degree of bad and arbitrary decision is 
evident. The success obtained in March 1968 gave its authors 
and beneficiaries a sense of absolute freedom to act in an 
autocratic way, which led in the end to December 1970. Here 
is the true connection between March 1968 and December 1970, 
a connection which can serve as a classic, though negative, 
example of the dialectic functioning of the socialist proces-
ses: The stifling of the external aspects of conflicts with-
out an effective solution of them becomes in itself the  
*source of aggravation of the conflicts and multiplication of 
the force, the level, and the dangerous significance of  the  
retarded explosion. In fact, from the point of view of the 
social and political dangers, what did the demonstrations of 
young students and of a certain number of writers and.sdholars 
in March 1968 amount to, compared with the demonstrations of 
the proletariat of the great Industries in a series of 
important Polish economic centers in December 1970? It is 
truly difficult to overvalue the significance of this con-
crete lesson in dialectical and historical materialism.-
,  Often people try to deny the interdependence of the  
political and economic factors in the development of the  
latter events, limiting themselves to indicating the ap-
parently purely economic character of the workers' demands. 
This reasoning does not seem well founded. First: 'Even ad-
mitting ..that the nature of the demands was purely economic, 
the thesis regarding the Interdependence of economic and 
political factors in creating the situation which was at 
the root of the demonstrations remains absolutely valid. 
Second: The workers demands were directly and indirectly 
related to important political problema, even though perhaps 
they were not sufficiently generalized (in form and not in 
subatance) to do so clearly. (This, I think, is owing to the 
lack of collaboration with the students and intellectuals; on 
the other hand, however, one must ask oneself whether in the 
given concrete situation this fact itself did not have pos-
itive consequences.) The demands were related especially to 
democratization of relationships at the factory level; chang-
ing the character of elections in the various organizations, 
Including party. Organizations;. a true autonomy and a new 
style of work for the trade unions; diffusion of information 
to all of public opinion without distortions; an effective 
struggle against bureaucracy; abolition of ceremonial pri-
vileges, especially when -not public; and so forth.. In the 
economic sector, there were numerous demands to increase 
autonomy of businesses as a condition for a greater and more 
efficient exploitation of productive possibilities, and as a 
basis for a. real rather than fictional workers' self-admin7. 
istration. Therefore, examining the demands more closely, 
8 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
their broader political significance cannot be escaped al-
together. Prom this point of view, the Polish working class  
has given proof of its maturity by correctly understanding  
the connections between economics and politics in a socialist  
country, and also by demonstrating a high sense of realism  
as regards the level and method of putting forth its demands. 
Taward-F of the Experience - 
The fact that the workers' demonstrations brought , 
about a change in Poland's political leadership is in it-
self positive; on the condition, however, that it is inter-
preted correctly. The problem is that the change in-polit-
ical leaders is considered the beginning and not the end of 
a process; as a potential opening for the conflicts which 
have come to maturity, and not as their effective solution. 
A series of measures taken immediately by the present lead-
ership, especially in the economic area, seems to be lead-
ing in the right direction. However, it is obvious that the 
problem consists not in immediate but rather in long-range 
activity. It is necessary to attack not the symptoms, but 
the cause at its source. This is not the place for a de-
tailed analysis of the elements of a vast and courageous 
program of activities which should transform possibilities 
into reality. However, such a program results on the con-
trary from a critical analysis of the causes of the crisis. 
The'elaboration of an adequate program certainly must 
in conclusion take into account the personal characteristics 
of party and government leaders, and the extent to which they 
understand the causes of the trouble, as well as the extent 
to which they are prepared (and have the desire) to effect 
the necessary changes. But let us not delude ourselves. 
Conservative forces will be opposed to their implementation. 
These forces are accustomed to acting with repressive methods 
rather than with methods normal to the reality of political 
activity, such as broader participation of the workers in 
the solution of important problems of. the present and the 
future. This is why it seems so important .to eliminate 
everything Which, in the recent past, made it impossible to 
assume'and to freely express a critical position toward the 
:problems relating to the whole society, and which, in a 
socialist regime, should be the concern of everyone; other-
wise,, the people will continue to have a feeling of im-
potence and to feel that it is impossible to influence. the 
decisions made in their name. 
A particularly important conclusion to be drawn from  
the' experience of December 1970 and the period following is  
that of understanding that even in a socialist regime the  
adaptation of the productive relationships to the needs of  
development of productive torces does.not come about in a  
mechanical way, but rather in the course, of a vital. social 
process. . And its result depends net only on the good will 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
of individuals (although, as we have emphasized, this is an 
element which is anything but negligible) but also on the 
interaction of social forces. From this point of view, it 
is necessary to evaluate the significance of the .social pres-
sure we are witnessing in Poland, a pressure exercised es-
pecially by the working class. We are accustomed to eval-
uating such phenomena in a socialist country as deplorable 
facts, to be eliminated at. whatever post and with whatever 
method; and if it is not possible to eliminate the causes� 
we at least eliminate the effects, burying them as deep as. 
possible. I think that by now we ought to be able to do 
without such unilateral attitudes,..which basically mean�  
nothing more than loss of faith In the force and the wisdom 
of the working class;  these are  nothing more than expressions 
of an attitude which denies  to the working clas in practice  
what is ascribed to it in  the textbooks -- the. political  
-role of vanguard. With the demonstrations of December 1970 
the Polish working class affirmed in a concrete way, through 
strong enough and continuous enough pressure on those who 
govern, the role which holds true and Which should hold true 
not only in exceptional situations but on a day-to-day basis. 
Only in this way will the forces within the party which 
truly zeflect these transformations have a social base, 
Indispensable for the formulation, of and.achievement of a 
program of activities corresponding.to.the needs and po-
tential of socialism. It is unnecessary to emphasize that 
the role of the vanguard of the.. working class not only does 
not exclude active collaboration with other social groups -4-
in particular intellectuals.-- but on the contrary pre-
supposes it. 
In conclusion, permit me to offer some reflectionS 
on the conclusions the Polish events imply for the inter-
national communist movement. Whether we wish it or not, the 
reality is this: Communist. and workers' parties in non-
socialist countries, and in particular in the developed. 
countries of the West, are held responsible for what happens 
In the socialist countries. This implies, indeed imposes 
upon Communist and workers' parties operating outside 
socialist countries, a duty of autonomous analysis of the 
processes taking place in the socialist countries; it 
imposes the political necessity that they assume an active 
position in 'confronting them. This seems all the more in-
dispensable in view of the fact that the many conclusions 
drawn from concrete experiences in socialist countries 
contribute to the elaboration of their own program, their own 
strategy, their ewn vision of socialism. It is neither right 
not proper for the opponents of socialism to have a monopoly' 
on critical analysis of the socialist world, since by the 
nature of the case they interpret reality in the socialist 
countries in a unilateral way. It therefore seems that a  
critical, but communist, analysis of socialist experiences; 
along with a renunciation of the "sweetness and light" type  
of analysis, is indispensable for the international com-
munist movement and for individual Communist parties, as well  
as for the future of socialism on a world scale. .

Hope and Hopelessness 
Leszek Kolakowski* 
T  ET us summarize briefly " the arguments which are most often  
advanced in support of the thesis that the communist social system 
in its present form is thireformable. These arguments hold that the 
main function of this system is to uphold the monopolistic and un-
controlled power of the ruling apparatus; all institutional or actual 
changes which have occurred, or which one could imagine occurring, 
will not undermine this basic principle, to which are subordinated all 
political and economic actions of the rulers. For the monopoly of 
despotic power cannot be partially abolished (this is almost. .a tautology, 
since by definition a monopoly cannot be partial '). ,Thus all past 
and foreseeable changes within the framework of the system are un-
important and can easily be reversed, for they cannot be institutionalized  
without destroying the whole mechanism. The satisfaction of the basic 
exocctations both of the working class and of the intelligentsia is thus 
an impossibility within the limits imposed by the main function OF  
the system. We are dealing here with a totally inflexible mechanism, 
lacking self-regulating devices and capable of change only in the face  
of violent catastrophes, which do occur from time to time, but which do 
not, apart from a number of superficial concessions and reorganizations  
within the ruling cliques, leave any scars on the physiology of the 
whole. Stalinism in the strict sense, i.e. the bloody and unrestrained 
tyranny of an individual, was the most perfect embodiment of the 
practical premises of the system; later changes, in particular the con-
siderable attenuation of terroristic forms of governing, however important 
from the point of view of the security of individuals, have in no way 
altered the despotic nature of the system or limited the characteristically 
socialist forms of oppression and exploitation. Since the basic functions  
of this social system are directed against society, which in turn is 
deprived of any constitutional means of self-defence, the only conceivable 
change must thus take the form of violent revolution. Such a revolution, 
moreover, is possible only on the scale of the whole socialist world 
system, since, as experience has shown, Soviet military predominance 
will always be employed to crush local attempts at revolution. " The 
result of this revolution is to be�according to the hopes of some�a 
socialist society in the sense defined by Marxist tradition (i.e. the 
social organization of the processes of production and distribution and 
the establishment of a representative system) or�according to others�
the introduction of the Western European model of capitalism, which 
in the face of the economic and ideological bankruptcy of sociaiism 
would seem the only trustworthy path of development.-
These are the basic peculiarities of the Soviet model of socialism 
which determine�according to this line of argument�that all hopes 
for its partial, gradual 'humanization' by the introduction of successive 
reforms must be vain (we refer here to 'structural' peculiarities which 
can be detected in all countries building socialism on the Soviet pattern).

and the monopoly of the ruling apparatus in controlling the means of 
production, investment, employment and the division of the national  
income are mutually interdependent. The political monopoly of the  
ruling oligarchy rests on its position as the sole employer and -sole 
controller of the means of production. Thus every movement in the  
direction of political democracy, if genuine, no matter how partial, just  
involve the partial- expropriation of the ruling class, which, though not  
the legal owner of the means of production, has all the rights and privi-
leges of a collective owner. In this fundamental sphere, all departures 
from this principle are illusory: one can, without danger, allow workers' 
discussions about their place of work and one can allow commissions 
of the Seim, a 'parliament' by the grace of the Party apparatus, to 
discuss the details of economic policy. All decisions will still in one 
way or another be made by the same bodies, which are in no way 
controlled by society. Any dissent from the desires of these bodies, 
revealed in discussion, will have no significance since as a result of the 
detailed control of information it will not be able to take the form of 
social pressure. All plans for reform proposed by, economists aim at 
significantly weakening the monopoly over economic decisions possessed 
by the ruling apparatus and threaten its partial expropriation; they have 
thus no chance of success. . 
(2) A natural tendency of the system is the continual reduction of 
the role of experts, in particular in the sphere of economic, social and 
cultural policy. Groups of experts are tolerated, insofar as they do not 
claim for themselves any rights to take decisions, but even in this purely 
advisory capacity, as experience has shown, they are unwillingly tolerated 
and arc done away with or replaced as far as possible by mock bodies 
chosen in advance according to the criterion of political servility. To 
allow experts any truly significant role in taking decisions would involve 
a reduction in the scope of the ruling elite's power. Thus inefficiency, 
the waste of social energies and of material, the rule of incompetents, 
are, as it were, built into the mechanism of government and cannot be 
seen as temporary defects corrigible in the future. The mechanism does 
not allow purely ' technical ' criteria, not subordinated to the function 
of maintaining and strengthening the existing authority, to have any 
influence on its functioning. 
(3) Freedom of information�the indispensable condition for the

s naturally untilitiknble without the ruin or the he it of rovern-
m'cat. which, in conditions of the free exchaT.c ot inlorni;oion, vtijht  
in2vitahlv collapse in a short period. In addition, the idea of limited  
;nfotmaton. made available to the rulers in dose corresponding to their 
pinces in the hierarchy is impossible to introduce. In other words, the  
tcic-i-s, though they might delude themselves in this regard. and even  
actively seek unfalsified information for their own use, will in;2vitably be  
Misinformed and will, from time to time, fall victim to their own lies.' 
The time is indeed past when Stalin dealt with insufficiently optimistic 
statistics by murdering statisticians, and obtained information about 
ko/kHoees from propaganda films about them. Nevertheless. the doing-
away with the most blatantly caricatural misinformation has not changed 
the fact. that the misinformation of the rulers is built into the system.  
This is the result or at least two sets of circumstances. In the first place, 
the providers of hermetic information tire most often the same people 
who, on the lower levels of the ruling apparatus, arc responsible for 
the matters on which they provide information. It is thus a normal 
phenomenon, and not at all exceptional, that unfavourable information 
can prove self-denunciatory, which can hardly be expected to be 
practised by people on a large scale, and also that the bringing of 
desired news is rewarded while that of unfavourable information is 
punished. This system, as one would expect, spreads inevitably and 
affects all categories of information-providers. Examples of ptinish-
ment for bringing bad news are countless and everybody knows them. 
Secondly, the gathering of information about social life, not affected by 
anything apart from the desire to establish the actual state of affairs, 
would require the creation of a considerable apparatus, free from any 
special political obligations and allowed to work in conditions of com-
plete freedom at least to assemble, if not to pass on, information. Such 
an apparatus would not only be an unnatural freak within the system, 
but would also constitute a source of political insecurity, for it would, 
by its very nature, be an organism not subject to ideological' restric-
tions, and free from the necessity to pay ideological tributes and thus 
to-be servile. In addition, a large-amount of the information collected 
in this way would inevitably increase internal tension and conflict at 
the higher levels of the apparatus. For there is practically no informa-
tion which is entirely neutral, and unfalsificd information about social 
life is immediately exploited by all competing groups or cliques aspiring 
to higher positions against those who are the present holders of these 
positions. Thus, although the Universal rule of self-delusion and self-
deceit may seem at first glance to be- senseless, it is, in. fact, one of the 
means employed by the system in self-defence. The ruling groups do, 
it is true, sometimes pay for the lies which they themselves produce, but 
on balance it pays them to bear these costs (the more so since a greater 
part of the cost is borne by society) which seem to increase stability and 
the security of the government.

(4) A further characteristic of socialism in its present Soviet version 
is the inevitable mental and moral degradation of the apparatus taking 
the most vital decisions affecting the life of .society. This is also 
inherent in the functioning of the political mechanism and does not 
result from the bad or good will of the rulers. This mechanism demands 
a strict subordination ,within the hierarchy, which is closely related � 
to the principle of the monopoly of power. In this way, as in all despotic  
systems, the positively effective characteristics in the career pattern of  
an individual (i.e. the characteristics which facilitate his advance up the 
ladder of the hierarchy) are servility, cowardice, the lack of initiative, 
eeadiness.to obey superiors, readiness to inform_ on people. indifference 
el social opinion and public interest. By contrast, capacity to take 
initiative, concern about public good and attachment to truth. efficiency 
and social interest, with no regard to the interests of the apparatus, 
oecome negative characteristics for the individual's promotion. The 
mechanism of power produces thus 'a negative � natural selection  
of the leading cadres in all parts of the ruling apparatus, but, above  
all, in the Party apparatus. The fourteen years of Gomulka's rule in  
Poland are the most striking confirmation of this truth. Their most  
outstanding characteristic was the systematic weeding out of individuals 
with competence and initiative and their replacement by cowardly and  
submissive mediocrities. The process which took place from March  
1968 on�the massive promotion of ignoramuses, informers or simple  
louts (the invasion of the lice' as it was called in Warsaw) was  
merely the acceleration and intensification of phenomena which had  
7:Nen occurring for many years. .As in all matters in this world, one 
can cite exceptions, but they afe few. The reverse process can some-
times be seen at critical. moments, but these do not change the basic 
tendency of the system, which, inevitably, must treat competence and 
the capacity to take initiative as phenomena hostile to itself. Different 
parts of the ruling machinery undergo this process of negative selection 
in different degrees, so that in the economic and industrial administration 
one can always find a significant number of competent and courageous 
people beating their heads stubbornly against the wall of helifference. 
fear and incompetence which encompasses the Party apparatus and 
its political and propaganda branches, where the principle of the 
selection of the worst elements achieves its greatest triumph. 
(5) Despotic forms of government inevitably produce the need for  
permanent, or at least periodically repeated, aggression. That war is  
a grave for democracy has been known for centuries. For this reason it  
is also the ally of tyranny. In the absence of foreign wars, a similar  
function is performed by various forms of internal aggression, whose 
aim is the maintenance of a continuous state of threat and the pre-
servation of the siege psychosis, using the most artificial methods and  
the most imaginary enemies. The renewal of acts of brutal aggression  
against  successive groups of the population, selected by the. most varied  
criteria, are not at all the consequences of folly, but an inherent function  
of the meclianiinn of power, which cannot do viithout mortal enemies.. 
in wait to take advantage of its least w, , . for only in thi,  
can it enstue the necessary readiness for filolOtation. It thus 
invents its own enemies, creating real ones in the process, for the acts 
of renewed aggression inevitably promote 'hostility and resistance in 
the persecuted and lead to a situation where repression can be justified 
� as necessary. The system of repression is thus self-propelled, and acts 
of internal aggression create of themselves the need for further 
repression. 
(6) The same principle of the monopoly of power creates the neces-
sity to encourage the disintegration of . society and, to destroy all forms_ 
of social life not decreed by the ruling apparatus. Since social conflicts 
arc not done away with, but stifled by repression and camouflaged by 
ideological phraseology, they seek the most varied forms of expression, 
which consequently means that even the most innocent forms of social 
organization, if not subject to proper police control, can indeed transform 
themselves into centres of opposition. This fosters the need to 
nationalize' all forms of social life and leads to continuous pressure 
aimed at destroying all spontaneous social ties in favour of compulsory 
pseudo-associations, whose only functions are negative and destructive 
and which do not represent anyone's interests, but those of the ruling 
class. Although the system needs enemies, it mortally fears any form 
of organized opposition; it wants to have only those enemies which it  
selectsitself and which it can tight in conditions of its own. choice. The 
natural need of despotism is to frighten individuals by depriviee them 
of the means of organized resistance. One method which serves this 
function is the creation of a criminal code which is consciously vague 
and ambiguous, so that the largest possible number of citizens can feel 
and be treated as criminals, and so that the scale of actual repression 
is not linked to rigorously laid down legal norms, but is subject to 
arbitrary manipulation and arbitrary decisions of the police and the 
Party. 
(7) The ruling apparatus has, moreover, no freedom in the question 
of citizens' rights: It cannot, under the threat of its own ruin, widen 
those rights even if this were the intention of the rulers. Experience  
has shown that concessions in the face of demands for democracy,  
'rather than causing satisfaction with partial gains, become, on the  
contrary, the reason for increased pressure from below which begins  
,to grow like an avalanche, threatening the whole political order. The  
enslavement of society is so great and the feeling of oppression and  
exploitation so strong that the smallest crack in the system of institu-
tionalized violence or the smallest reform which promises its relaxation  
immediately sets in motion huge reserves of hidden hostility and sup-
pressed demands which threaten to explode and which it then becomes  
impossible to control. It is not surprising that, after so many experien-
ces, the .philanthropy of the rulers, even should it exist, could not relieve  
the political and economic slavery of the population.

fHEsp, are the most important arguments advanced in support of 
the thesis�which is moreover consistent with the spirit of Marxist 
tradition�that the characteristically socialist form of slavery cannot be 
partially done away with or reduced by partial reforms, but requires 
total and simultaneous destruction. 
In my view this thesis is incorrect, and its propagation constitutes 
an ideology of defeatism rather than a revolutionary appeal. I base 
this conviction on four general principles. First, we are never in a 
position to decide in advance on the degree of flexibility of any social 
organization; events so far have not proved at all that the despotic 
model of socialism is in fact completely rigid. Secondly, the rigidity 
of the system depends partly on the degree to which ,the people living 
under it are convinced of its rigidity. Thirdly, the thesis of unreform-
ability is based on the ideology of ' all-or nothing', which is charac-
teristic of people who have been educated in the Marxist tradition, 
but which is not at all confirmed by general historical experience. 
Fourthly, bureaucratic despotic socialism is entangled in contradictory 
internal tendencies, which it is incapable of resolving into any kind of 
synthesis, and which inevitably weaken its cohesion�a development 
which is becoming more acute rather than diminishing in intensity. 
All the mechanisms which have been �mentioncd so far and seem  
to justify the argument that socialist despotism is incapable of reform  
do in fact operate within the system, have been noted on many oCcasions  
and can be personally confirmed by all who live in the socialist countries.  
They all reveal the logic inherent in this system whose basic forms sat 
action are directed against society. , What follows from these observa-
tions is that if the mechanism of the bureaucratic rule functions without 
any resistance on the part of society, it will be inevitably producing, in 
ever more intensive forms, all the phenomena which we have described, 
leading ultimately to a society organized on strictly Orwellian lines. It 
does not, however, follow from these observations that these tendencies 
cannot be countervailed by a movement of resistance capable of limiting 
and weakening their operation, which will not lead to any perfect society, 
but which will create viable forms of socialist organization capable of 
offering its members a reasonable life. The reformist position would be 
absurd if it was dependent on the goodwill of the exploiting class, on 
the philanthropic attitude of the apparatus of coercion or on the auto-
matic mechanisms of the organization. The reformist position is not 
absurd, however, if it is understood as an idea . of active resistance 
exploiting inherent contradictions of the system. All the characteristics  
of bureaucratic socialism described so far emphatically indicate that it 
has built-in tendencies leading to the continuous growth of police  
methods of government, to social disinteeration and demoralization, to  
the persistence of economic ineffeciencies and to the perpetuation of all  
those negative social characteristics which are universally known and 
which make life a torment for working people. ' .:owever, in this general 
respect, it has one feature in common with the capitalist system as ana-
lyzed by Marx. All the productive and social tendencies inherent in 
this economic system which were discussed by Marx, did not come 
arbitrarily out of his imagination, but were based on a detailed observa-
tion of society. There were reasons to believe that a growing class 
polarization was inherent in capitalism, along with the P,I3solute impover-
ishment. of the proletariat, a progressive fall in the rate .of profit, anarchy 
and periodic crises of overproduction, massive uneme4oyment and the 
disappearance of the middle classes; that all reforms which could be 
conceived within the framework of this system could not be lasting, 
since the fundamental laws caused by the wolf-like hunger for surplus 
value' which determined the totality of productive processes could not 
be abolished within this framework; thus the real importance of reforms 
is in their political significance, as means for training in the struggle 
and for the � consolidation of class solidarity before the final conflict. 
Marx, of course, was quite aware of all the counter-trends weakening 
the operation of capitalist laws of accumulation, the most important of 
which, though not the only one, was the resistance of the working class. 
It was not possible, however, to assess quantitatively the tendencies and 
counter-tendencies in the future evolution of the system. Thus, although 
Marx's analyses were well grounded, his belief that ' ultimately ' the laws 
of capitalism will always prove themselves stronger within the system 
than the resistance of the oppressed has proved to be only an expression 
of his ideological position. In fact, the failure of the expected progres-
sive impoverishment of the proletariat and of the growing anarchy of 
production to materialize in the end was the result, not of the philan-
thropic attitude of the bourgeoisie or of its moral transformation. It 
was the result of long years of struggle and confrontations which forced 
bourgeois society to recognize certain principles of social organization 
as its permanent features. Exploitation was not done away with but 
was limited in an important way in industrially developed countries; 
the possessing classes agreed to the limitation of their privileges in order 
to preserve what could .be preseved of them without bringing society to 
ruin. 
NATURALLY analogies of this type are not completely satisfactory. 
It is true that socialist bureaucracy has learnt from the defeats of 
the bourgeoisie, i.e. how dangerous an be the freedom of information 
and assembly. Thus resistance to exploitation and oPprcssion in the  
Soviet system of despotism takes place in worse social conditions than  
ever before; no oppressing class in history has had power of such scope  
at its disposal. But this concentration of power is not only a source  
of strength, but also of weakness, as has been revealed by the whole  
post-Stalin history of communism. 
The very nature of this system demands complete concentration 
of power at the centre of command. That is why it is true that Stalin's 
power (and that of his local miniatures) was the most perfect embodi-

merit of the principles of despotic socialism. However the impossibility 
of re-establishing it stems from the impossibility of reconciiing two 
values, both important for the ruling apparatus; unity and security. 
The conflicts for powci- within the system cannot be institutionalized 
without threatening the ruin of The whole system, for institutionalization 
would mean the legalization of fractional activity within the PartY, 
which would only differ in an insignificant way from the establishment 
of a multi-party system. . Yet groups, cliques and cabals which organize 
themselves in accordance with various criteria of choice and with 
different bonds of interest are an inevitable product of social life. There-
fore for a' system facing a-constant threat of political escalation, the 
ideal is the absolute tyranny of one autocrat with so limited an intel-
ligence and morality that he will not be held back by any 'abstract' 
principles, yet so shrewd that he is able to prevent all crystallization 
of groups within the apparatus by periodic massacres and purges, and 
in this way maintain the instrument of government in a proper state 
of constant fluidity and fear. However this is drastically at odds with 
the need for security of the apparatus, which not surprisingly does not 
want to live in a situation where every one of its functionaries, including 
the members of the Party Secretariat and of the Politburo, can at any 
moment be transferred from his oflice to the dungeons of the police at 
a nod from his chief. Therefore the move away from one-man to 
oligarchic rule, the so-called collective leadership', was in the' highest 
interest of the ruling machine. This is certainly not without significance, 
though it might not seem that it makes much difference to the oppressed 
whether the documents of their oppression are signed by one or ten 
individuals. Oligarchy does not, of course, involve any 'democratiza-
tion' although it does involve a significant limitation of terroristic 
method's of government. Moreover it also involves a serious under-
mining of the stability of the government and its inevitable decentraliza-
tion (still�no democratization), e.g. the consolidation of the positions 
and extension of the rights of the local apparatchiks. This apparatus 
is not able to prevent concealed fractionalism and to avoid creating 
competing bodies which continuously undermine its efficiency. More-
over, from another point of view, resistance is most likely and most 
effective not when oppression is at its worst and terror strongest, but, 
on the contrary, at moments of relative loosening caused by the dis-
aggregation of the ruling apparatus: we have to thank Lenin for this 
perceptive observation. The present-clay apparatus is not subject, it is 
true, to ideological shocks, as was Stalin's apparatus, which lost its 
balance for that very reason after the moral disereditation of the leader, 
but it is demoralized and suffers chronically from the internal conflicts 
of rival groups. It is true that it is in the interests of these groups to 
keep their existence a secret from society, but in this sphere concealment 
cannot be wholly successful and is wholly unsuccessful within the 
political machinery. The partial paralysis of the apparatus is thus 
liccoming incurable and follows a natural coin-se of successive remissions 
and decrioriations; its stability depends on several independent factors, 
v.rilose interaction is difficult to predict. In this sense, one can say that 
the partial ' destalinization ' which has been forced on the system has 
intrcduccd a degradation of power into the mechanism and this makes 
effective resistance possible. In other words: as long as the apparatus is 
stable and immunized against political shocks it can, in general, dis-
regard popular dissatisfaction. But once it has lost this stability and 
no longer fears its leader or its police so much, it pays for this by 
continual fear. of....society,..of.its...competitors..for power,. of .domestic and. 
foreign bosses, of the working class, of the intelligentsia, and even of 
small groups of intellectuals. 
THE next ineradicable internal contradiction of bureaucratic socialism  
is the conflict between the need for a radical change in �ideology 
and the impossibility of getting rid of the Stalinist-Leninist ideology. 
As distinct from democratic political organizations, which can refer 
'back to social consensus as the basis of their legality, despotism lacks 
any representative organs and must inevitably possess some sort of 
ideological system even if of the most paltry kind, in order to estab-
lish the apparent legality of its existence. No state and no system can 
exist without legitimacy�whether it be the inheritance of royal charisma 
or free elections, In the absence of such possibilities, legitimization takes 
on an ideological character�the principle that the Party is the embodi-
ment of the interests of the working class or of the whole nation, that � 
the state is part of the great international working-class movement. 
consolidating its power in one part of the world in expectation of its 
further extension. Obviously ideology plays an entirely different role  
in this system of government than it does in the democratic states, no  
matter how pathetic may seem the clash of principles with reality. At  
the moment ideology in the socialist world is a burdensome hump which 
cannot be dispensed wi in any way. Internationalist phraseology is  
indispensable to the So v authorities, since it offers the only legitimation 
of their rule abroad; it is indispensable to the local rulers who are  
dependent on the Soviets,  as the justification of their dependence and  
of their own power.. It Might seem that the Soviet rulers can completely 
disregard the non-ruling communist parties, whom they hardly wish to 
incite to a real struggle for power,' and that _their splits and deviations 
are of no political. significance. In reality, this is not the case, for an. 
open and complete abandonment of the communist movement in 
countries which are not under Soviet control could only occur if they 
were to abandon the principles which justify this control where it exists. 
The rulers are thus the victims of their own ideology with all its 
nonsensical baggage. . It is a paradox that this ideology, in which 
practically  everybody has ceased to believe�those who  propagateit,-
those who profit from it, and those who must listen to it�is still a  
matter of the most vital importance for the continuing existence of this  
of. 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 002062642 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 002062642 
political system. The dead and by now also grotesque creature called  
Marism-Leninisyn stiil haii:s at the necks of the rulers like a hopeless  
tumour, limiting their freedom of movement. This ideology has no force  
of persuasion in the countries of the Soviet bloc as the rulers well know: 
thus propaganda intended to make an effective appeal to the population, 
or even to the Party itself, uses ideology less and less, confining its6lf 
almost entirely to miuments based on the notions of raison d'etat and 
of national interest. But this development brines forth another contra-
diction within the system. As we know, apart from articulated pro-
paganda, there also exists in these countries an esoteric propaganda,  
which is sometimes more important, and which cannot be formulated in  
speeches and articles, but must somehow be conveyed to the people. In  
the Soviet Union it is the idea of being a great power, the glory emanat-
ing from an empire which rules over large-parts of the globe more or less 
directly. In contrast to the official Marxism-Leninism, the imperial  
ideology can produce a certain real response. But in the countries of  
the People's Democracies this unspoken ideology is an ideology of the 
-
tear of Soviet tanks,, imparted by the use of the most varied forms of 
allusion. Here also the unarticulated ideology, unlike the articulated 
one, can count on a certain success among the population: one does not 
need particularly subtle arguments to convince the people that the. 
Russian leaders are capable of producing massacres in any insufficiently 
obedient protectorate. To some extent the two unarticulated-ideologies 
�that of the centre and that of the periphery�converge in their effects, 
but it would be shortsighted to count on this convergence as a lasting 
basis for ruling: not only because in both cases the unarticulated ideology 
is not complementary but clearly contrary to the official ideology, but 
also because it can achieve its goal�temporary pacification�only at the 
cost of the perpetuation and intensification of national hostilities, which 
though advantageous in times of peace, are extremely dangerous in 
times of crisis. For the time being, there is no other solution, if the 
ruling apparatus is to retain even a minimal contact with society. 
Among the historic quips of Stalin there was the famous question: 
How many divisions has the Pope?' The poverty of this question 
illustrates most clearly the poverty of a political system which has lost 
everything except divisions (no mean thing to be sure), which does not . 
know how to believe in anything apart from divisions, and boasts of 
this as an example of healthy realism, forgetting that it emerged as a 
result of the Russian revolutions of February and October 1917, which 
were successful, not by virture of possessing 'many divisions, but as a 
result of the moral collapse of the Tsar's empire and army. 
THE ideological paralysis of bureaucratic socialism is ever more 
extensive and irreversible; successive campaigns and conferences of  
Party officials on the theme of 'ideological struggle may work out new 
methods of repression and intimidation, but they are not able to offer 
society anything apart from the usual insipid phrases. All attempts to 
reverse this catastrophic trend follow two courses�nationalistic phra-
seeT.-Igy or phraseology of order and efficiency, and around these catch-
words loose factions form themselves. The first is of little value, since 
the central and basic question�real national sovereignty�constitutes 
by its very nature an impassable barrier. The second would be more 
effective, if it could demonstrate that it possessed a programme capable 
of being implemented on technocratic ' principles. But the techno-
cratic ' programme implies the primacy of criteria of productive efficiency  
and of technological progress over political values, and as such could only 
be implemented as a result of the ruling apparatus progressively abandon-
ing its power, or again, at the price of the partial expropriation of the 
ruling class. We touch here upon successive internal contradictions of  
the system of government: contradictions, often : analysed, between  
technological and industrial progress and the system of political power  
which continually hampers that progress. This contradiction falls within 
the scope of Marx's classic definition of capitalist production, but has  
never manifested itself so strikingly as in the regime which, according 
to its principles emerged to end such contradictions. All the charac-
teristics of despotic socialism which we have thus far mentioned arc,  
for obvious reasons, powerful brakes on technical and productive  
progress and perpetuate the stagnation of the system. But technological 
progress (not limited only to military technique) and even the increase 
of consumption (in spite of certain political advantages which poverty 
and an inadequate supply of elementary needs give to the rulers) are in 
the interests of the ruling class for various reasons; the higher the general 
� level of development, the more difficult it is to achieve outstanding 
results in one area of production, such as military production, treated as 
an isolated branch; the expectations of the population depend to a con-
siderable degree on their comparison of their situation with that of 
highly developed countries, a phenomenon impossible to avoid because a 
complete blOckage of information is, for many reasons, already impos-
sible to achieve. Thus in a situation of stagnation or even one in which 
- the level of consumption is increasing slowly, the level of subjective dis-
satisfaction and discontent can grow. One can indeed never foresee 
when it will reach the point of explosion in conjunction with other 
circumstances; in general it is impossible to avoid a situation of inter-
national competition even when this imposes an unfavourable situation, 
and the conditions of this competition are ever more difficult. Thus the 
rulers, when they stress their desire for technological progress and the  
improvement of the material situation of the population, are, in general, 
stating their true intentions. These intentions are, however, in conflict 
with a second group of intentions, related to the perpetuation � of their  
own monopoly of uncontrolled power in all fields of social life., 
But if this contradiction is unavoidable, this does not mean as Isaac 
Deutscher seemed to hope that the socialist system will 'democratize' 
itself as a result of the automatic pressure of technical progress. The 
contradiction between technological development and the system of 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 002062642 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 002062642 
political government and economic organization can only foster 
development where it emerees as social conflict: a conflict between all 
strata interested in maintaining the existing mechanism of exploitation,  
and the working class and intelligentsia, above all though not exclusively 
�the technical and managerial intelligentsia, 
The conflicts which we have mentioned are strengthened by an 
additional contradietion resulting from the national situation of the 
countries making up the Soviet Empire. The ruling apparatus, aims at 
maintaining the dependence on the Soviet Union as a guarantee of its 
own position. but at the same time it wants to weaken it to increase 
its own freedom of decision-making. This situation inevitably creates 
tensions in the political machine and also Creates a point where social 
pressure can be effective. National sovereignty is not sufficient in itself 
for the social emancipation of working people, but it is obviously an 
indispensable precondition of that emancipation. Fear of the fraternal 
guns from the East is, of course, not unjustified but it is consciously 
exaggerated as a 'patriotic device' for stifling the smallest demands and 
as a means of convincing the nation of the absolute hopelessness of all 
its efforts. In reality, the goal of Poland, as of the other nations of the 
Soviet zone, is not to provoke an armed conflict, but a ceaseless pressure 
aimed at diminishing Polish dependence. on the USSR, a dependence 
which can only be weakened through pressure. In this sphere, too, 
thinking along the lines of 'all or nothing' is futile and the 'adoption 
of such a principle means in practice to accept ' nothing '. No one can 
be so blind as to argue that there is no difference between the national 
situation of Poland and Lithuania, or that the degree of dependence of 
Poland did not change at all between 1952 and 1957. Dependence and 
non-sovereignty can exist in different degrees and the difference in the 
degree of dependence is of enormous significance for the existence of the 
nation. The function of the humanistic intelligentsia and, in general, 
of the teaching intelligentsia is of key importance in this respect. 
If the Polish nation was able to resist Germanization and Russifica-
tion in the partition period, this was primarily the achievement of this 
social stratum. If it had not possessed this group, it would have 
remained in the same position as the Lusation nation, which did indeed 
preserve its language but because it has failed to produce its own original 
culture and its own intelligentsia has little chance of survival. Poland 
was preserved as a cultural entity thanks to those who created the 
Commission for National Education and those who continued its work, 
thanks to the teachers, writers, historians, philologists and philosophers 
of the nineteenth century, who, in very difficult conditions, worked to 
increase the nation's cultural heritage. The Czech nation, which was on 
the brink of being Germanized culturally, was saved thanks to the 
similarly conscious efforts of its nineteenth-century intelligentsia. Those 
who today stifle the free development of the national culture are the 
enemies of Poland. 
I 17 I declare myself in favour of the reformist ' principle, it is not in 
the sense that I believe one can define reformism as a legal ' means 
of struggle, as distinct from illegal ' means. This distinction is simply 
without meaning in a situation in which the decision as to what is or is 
not legal is decided, not by the law, but by the arbitrary interpretation of 
ambiguous laws by the police and the Party apparatus. In conditions 
where the rulers can, if they wish, arrest and condemn citizens for 
possegsing unorthodox books, for conversations between individuals on 
political subjects, for telling jokes and for the expression of improper. 
ideas in private letters, the application of the concept of legality has no 
meaning whatsoever. On the contrary, the best way to counteract 
prosecutions of this type .of �-`. crime.'� is their massive committal. I am 
thinking of a reformist orientation in the sense of a belief in the possi-
bility of effective gradual and partial pressures, exercized in a long-term 
perspective, a perspective of social and national liberation. Despotic 
socialism cannot be seen as a totally inflexible system, for there arc no 
such systems. Its capacity for a.certain 'flexibility has been revealed in 
recent years even in fields as decisive as the scope of decision-making 
which is to be subject to official ideological control. The scope of this 
ideological control has diminished to a not insignificant degree: Party  
officials no longer have to know more about medicine than professors of  
medicine and more about philology than philologists. They do still, it  
is true, know more about literature than writers. But in Poland, even  
in this field, certain irreversible changes have taken place. The area  
subject to interference by the ideological authorities is still unbearable,  
but it is significantly smaller than it was, when compared with those  
times not long past, when state doctrine decided the width of trousers,  
tpe colour of shoes and the truths of genetics. One can perhaps say  
that this censtitutes progress from slavery to feudalism. However, we 
are not confronted with a choice between complete decay and perfection, 
but only with the choice of agreeing to decay or making an unceasing 
effort to preserve in our national life such values and standards which, 
once preserved, will not easily be destroyed. The cultural pogrom of 
1968 left a great heritage of discouragement because, though unavoid-
able, it was a confrontation which took place in conditions chosen and 
imposed by the coercive apparatus. But we are now witnessing in the 
world the breaking down of rigid orthodoxies, the abandoning of rules, 
taboos, saints and beliefs, which, not long before, seemed the absolute 
condition of their existence. It might seem that analogies with church 
history are beside the point since churches do not have police and prisons 
at their disposal. Nevertheless, churches have also lost their means of 
compulsion because of the pressure of cultural change, while the police 
have since time immemorial deluded itself as to its own omni-
potence, and have attempted to delude others, because it retains its 
power only so long as others continue to believe in its omnipotence. 
If it has to face strong social pressures. the police reveals itself as Lila

iltely powerless, and the fear of those �vno live by spreading fear 
nes tinnier than the fear of the persecuted. 
Bureaucratic socialism has lost its ideological base. in spite of all 
t:le monstrous features of Stalinism, the Stalinist apparatus, at least in 
the People's Democracies, was incomparably more dependent in its. 
activity on its ideological links with the system than the pre?ent 
apparatus. It might seem that a cynical apparatus, whose members 
measure, the achievements of socialism by their own privileges and 
careers is more efficient, since it lacks encumbrances and restraints, is 
not threatened by ideological shocks, is capable of arbitrary and light-
ning transformations and is more subject to manipulation. But this is 
less than half the truth. Such an apparatus is not only weak in moments 
of crisis and unable to survive real tests, not only highly vulnerable to 
self-destruction through its tendency to-form cliques, but itself appears 
as a symptom of historical decay of the system which it serves. A 
system which nobody serves disinterestedly is dootmed�I quote this 
sentence from Victor Serge's book on the Okhrana�Ha sentence which no 
policeman will ever believe, until he loses his job. Despotic socialism is  
dying the slow death described by Hegel; it seems untouched but it is  
sinking down into an inert boredom and numbness, relieved only by  
everyone's fear of everyone else, a fear discharged in aggression. The  
loss of its ideas means a loss of its raison d'�e for the system. Let  
us note some small changes in phraseology: the word freedom '. was  
always on Stalin's lips when torture and massacres were the order of  
the day in his empire; today when the massacres have stopped, the faint  
cry of freedom puts the entire police force on the alert. All the old-
fashioned words�' freedom ', independence ', law ', justice ', truth ' 
�can turn against the bureaucratic tyranny. All that is valuable and  
lasting in the present-day culture of the nations under the rule of this 
system rises against it. The international communist movement has 
ceased to exist; the idea of communism in its Soviet version has also  
ceased to exist.  
Probably in conditious of ficedorn of choice the majority of the 
Polish working class and intelligentsia would opt for socialism as would 
the writer of this article. Socialism, as understood here, can only be 
implemented in a sovereign national organism, and it presupposes the 
control of society over the means of production and distribution of the  
national income and over the administrative and political apparatu,  
working as an organ of society, and not as a master for whom society  
is a hand-maiden. They would opt for an organism which would  
establish freedom of information arid communication, political pluralism  
and a multiplicity of forms of social ownership, respect for the criteria 
of truth, of effectiveness and of public interest, freedom to form trade 
unions and freedom from the arbitrariness of political police, a criminal 
code under which prison will exist to protect society against anti-social 
behaviour and not in order to transform all citizens into criminals, so 
as to be able to blackmail everyone.  
To what extent a movement for the establishment of such a society 
is po.,e.,0..le depends to a considerable degree, though of course not 
completely, on the extent to which society believes that it is possible. As 
the nature of a given society is dependent in part on its own self-image, 
there cannot be in social change a pure potential concealed in material 
circumstances alone and independent of the degree of awareness of 
potentialities by the people. Thus in the countries of socialist despotism. 
those. who inspire hope are also the inspirers of a movement which 
could make this hope real�just as in society's attempts to understand 
itself, object and subject often coincide. 
THE, belief that socialism in its present form is totally inflexible and 
I can only be destroyed at one fell swoop, and therefore that no partial 
changes are in essence changes in its social nature, easily lends itself to 
justifying opportunism and pure knavery. For if it was true, there would 
be no significance in any individual or collective initiative to counteract 
the monstrous behaviour of the neo-Stalinist bureaucracy, nor in ,any 
struggle to preserve in society respect for the truth, for competence, 
for honesty, for justice and for intelligence; in short, on this premise 
each individual act of knavery can be justified, since it can be interpreted 
simply as an element of the universial knavery, which for the moment' 
is unavoidable and is not the work of individuals but the result of the 
system. The principle of unreforrnability can thus serve as an absolution 
granted in advance for every act of cowardice, passivity, and co-
operation with evil. The fact that a large part of the Polish intelligentsia 
has been persuaded to believe in the complete inflexibility of the shameful 
system under which they live is almost certainly responsible for the 
regrettable passivity which they displayed during the dramatic action of 
the Polish workers in 1970. 
The worst service one could possibly do to the cause of Polish 
independence and democracy is to perpetuate nationalist anti-Russian 
stereotypes. The Russian nation, which has been through a most 
terrible gehenna of recent times, is used by its rnlers as a tool in their 
imperialist policies. But it is itself a victim of these policies to a greater 
extent than anyone else. Given the atrophy ef internationalist ideology, 
the fostering of nationalism within the Soy sphere of influence' is, 
despite certain inherent risks, an intlispense le tool of the most tradi-
tional kind for maintaining power. The friendship of nations' in the 
official doctrine consists of the drinking of toasts of friendship by official 
delegations, and of visits by folk dance groups under strict police 
supervision. True friendship and understanding between nations, whose 
mutual distrust and hostility may have deep historical roots, can only 
be anchored in uncontrolled contacts and exchanges�but this the ruling 
strata fear above all. Polish anti-Russian nationalism, in provoking a 
natural reaction, only strengthens Great Russian nationalism and con-
tributes to the prolongation of both nations' enslavement. It is a pity 
that it should be necessary to repeat this truth which already during the 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 002062642 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 002062642 
'Peoples' Spring' of 1848 was quite banal for the revolutionary demo-
cracy of that period, but, as long as it still applies, it will have to be 
repeated. Those peoPle who, instead of seeking to know and understand 
the true national culture of Russia. perpetuate anti-Russian stereotypes 
in Poland are the uncOnscious spokesmen of the power which holds both 
nations in slavery. ' 
In spite of the Soviet empire's military power and of the invasion of 
Czechoslovakia, decentralizing tendencies within the bloc have not 
ceased and nationalism will continue to erode the organism evermore, 
lacking. as it does,- any ideological -cement. It is not in-any nation's 
interest that national hatreds should provide the fuel for this disintegra-
tion, since such hatreds could end in apocalyptic massacres. One can 
only offset this fearful perspective by putting new life into the traditional, 
old-fashioned idea of the brotherhood of nations united against their 
oppressors. 
TO conclude: all the internal contradictions of despotic socialism 
1 which we have described can be resolved in one of two ways. If left 
to its own inertia, in silence and fear, the system will always and inevit-
ably tend to such a solution of its own contradictions which will increase, 
and not decrease oppression; tighten, not loosen the bondage. . The 
growth of police methods of rule is the result not of increased resistance, 
but, oft the contrary, of its absence. The flexibility of this social forma-
tion�a flexibility whose limits cannot be estaMshod in advance�will 
manifest itself in its re-Stalinization, if no etTecti,, e forces to oppose this 
trend emerge. It can manifest itself in a form more in accordance with 
the needs of society only under pressure from this society; this is a 
lesson which follows irrefutably from our experience. Those who think 
that they can buy their personal tranquillity with small concessions will 
discover that the price of their tranquillity will rise continually. Those 
who today pay only with innocent toadying, will be compelled tomorrow 
to pay with denunciation of their colleagues for the same commodity; 
those who buy miserable privileges only by being silent in the face of 
knavery which they could oppose, will soon be forced to pay by actively 
participating in knavery. The natural law of despotism is moral 
inflation, whereby the distributor of goods compels people to pay ever-
higher prices, if social pressure does not enforce cuts. 
This perspective is perhaps not an encouraging one, but at least it is 
not a fantasy, in contrast to perspectives which would have us wait for 
a miracle, for help from outside, or for the automatic self-correction 
of the system's jarring machinery left to its own inertia. What is 
important is that instruments of pressure are available and arc at nearly 
everybody's disposal. They consist in drawing obvious conclusions from 
the most simple precept. --those which forbid silence in the face of 
knavery, servile subservience to those in authority, accepting alms with 
humility or other similar attitudes. Cur own dignity gives us the right 
to proclaim out loud the old words 'freedom', 'justice', and Poland

V./POSSIBLE REVOLUTION: 
Thu Communist Nations 
No ONE TODAY, even within the communist parties 
of the western world, seriously contends that the Soviet 
Union is a revolutionary model for other countries. Hopes 
for a form of "socialism with a human face," and ex-
pectations of a spontaneous liberalization of the Soviet 
regime, have been periodically, and invariably, disappointed. 
At- the same time, the Soviet Union's lack of success 
in the economic field has made its totalitarian regime 
less and less acceptable. It is no longer possible to justify 
the suppression of liberty by the imperatives of industrial 
discipline�especially since it has become obvious that 
Soviet industry is characterized by waste and inefficiency. 
The China of Mao Tse-tung offers no more promise 
than does the U.S.S.R. China has repudiated "economism"; 
but, for all of that, her people have not regained their 
freedom. The so-called cultural revolution�which seems 
to have been essentially a purge, reinforced, in some in-
stances, by an ominous explosion of collective sadism�
has left intact, or even strengthened, China's dictatorial 
political regime and her all-powerful political propaganda 
machine. It is hard to see the 'sense in declaring economic 
productivity to be of secondary importance in an under-
developed country; and that is particularly true if, as in 
the ease of China, the ideal of austerity which is offered 
to the people is not odkt by: the right to individual 
development, and if it is accompanied instead by an ever 
more oppressive climate of moral,. intellectual, and physical 
terrorism. 
This refers particularly to austerity in the communist 
countries, which is not. the kind of austerity that one 
can interpret as an investment in the future; it is not 
planned, coherent, or due (as we are expected to believe) 
to "primitive socialist accumulation." Rather, it is a 
state of anarchic poverty, resulting from the underpro-
duetivity of a badly managed industrial machine. Thus, 
we are treated today to the spectacle of the Soviets 
borrowing capital from Japanese (that i5, American) banks, 
and asking Ford to build, at: its exper

fact-61-y in Russia. In other words; they are soliciting_the 
honor of beim-, included arnong_the victims of ne_geolonial-
____ 
These indications of failure arc more or less accepted 
as such, depending upon the bias of the individual. Even 
on the European Left, which is traditionally well disposed 
toward China and the 'U.S.S.R., it is- difficult to, find any-
one still willing to declare that every instance of Soviet 
expansion represents a step forward for world socialism 
or that the Chinese system is a freely -exportable mode. 
of "socialism with liberty." (It is true that some student: 
regard themselves as "Maoists" because they reject al 
authority and demand complete individual freedom; but 
these individuals are simply badly informed on the state 
of present-day Chinese society.) On the whole, most 
militant socialists-communists and their sympathizers, or 
at least those who arc open-mindcd and have access even 
to a minimum of information, have gradually been forced 
to recognize, either openly or in their own minds, that 
the Marxist-Leninist states represent a revolutionary fail-
ure. It is no longer Possible to maintain that there can be 
progress in socialism without equal progress in Unman 
freedom, and particularly in freedom of expression. We 
have already seen where that road leads, in rile case 
of National Socialism in Germany and Fascism in Italy. 
Yet, once we abandon this thesis, we must also abandon 
all hope in "democratic centralism"�that is, in the Soviet 
system and the Chinese system. Wc must even question 
whether the system of economic management practiced 
in Russia, China, Yugoslavia, and Cuba dess-.:rvcs the name 
of socialism�that is, whether it is possible to have a 
socialist economy without a political democracy. Can 
we say that the total or partial collectivization of the 
means of production is "socialist" if, at the same time, 
the people are not allowed to exercise individual initiative 
and control,' or to share in decision-making and in the 
exercise of power? Can we say that a system is "socialist" 
if the great options (often a synonym for great errors) 
CO2062642 
Approved for Release: 2021/12/15 CO2062642 
that determine the destiny of a people for rgenerations arc 
determincd by an authoritarian minority? Can a repressive 
totalitarianism which generates underdevelopment be 
called socialism, even at a purely - material level? It is 
high time to preach what we have learned at high cost: 
economic socialism cannot exist in an atmosphere of 
political dictatorship. Any attempt to establish one along-
side the other must lead either to caricature, or to tragedy.Ynslavia, in which non-Stalinist Marxists have placed 
such great hope, has confirmed this principle by remaining 
both ineffectual and repressive. And Cuba, ten years after 
Castro's triumph, is still bogged down in the morass of 
authoritarian nonproductivity.* In the most conservative 
terms, this situation may be expressed by a formula: 
"Socialism has not yet been realized anywhere in the 
world." As a corollary, we might add: "The. U.S.S.R. is, 
in any ease, the last place where it may be realized; and ' 
it is likely that, henceforth, the same prognosis applies 
to China." To put it brutally: the events of October 
1917 in Russia were not the beginning, and cannot be-
come the model, of world-wide socialist revolution. 
If socialism, with or without its "human face," has not 
been realized anywhere, then it is foolish to continue 
referring automatically to the "socialist camp" and the 
"imperialist camp," as though revolutionary action were 
merely a problem of mechanics or of transportation, by 
virtue of which a maximum number of territories or 
political regimes would enter into one camp to the 
detriment of the other. Moreover, this attitude presup-
poses that only capitalistic expansion is "imperialistic," 
and that socialistic expansion is not; that is, that only 
capitalistic nations are capable of seeking to increase 
their influence in international affairs so as to strengthen 
themSelves as geographic realities. The truth, if we are 
impartial in our judgment, is that the communist nations 
and the capitalist nations have been endoi.ved with the. 
spirit of imperialism in approximately equal portions. It 
is hardly worth ',mentioning such obvious examples as 
the invasion of Tibet by China, or of Czechoslovakia by 
the U.S.S.R.; for those Were old-fashioned,, almost Hitlerian: 
enterprises, unworthy of the more _subtle methods of mod-
ern imperialism which seek to avoid outright military - 
conquest. More representative of imperialism at a re-
fined level is the Soviet presence in the Arab nations of , 
the Middle East, which utilizes the very real problems of 
these states to aid thern in 'their war�or rather, to push 
them toward war�while satisfying Russia's own ancient 
expansionist ambitions in this region. Similarly, the ha- - 
tred which exists between the Chinese and the Soviets 
sscc especially Cuba esl-irsocialiste? by Rene Dumont (Paris, 1970), 
and Guerillas in Action by K. S. Karol (New York, 1970). 
is of the kind that Ca 11 flourish only when two imperialis 
tic powers have conflicting designs on the same sphen 
of influence�on black Africa, for example. It means noth 
ing to say that these penetrations into other states ar( 
not manifestations c.) - imperialism simply because they 
are accompanied by an ideological message. Let us recall 
that it was in the name of an ideology�Christianity�
that Latin America was conquered in the sixteenth cen-
tury, and that Christian principles were as little applied 
in those countries then as socialist principles arc applied 
in Africa now. It was also in the 'name of an ideology, 
which was to remain wholly academic�that of "repub-
licanism" and "progress"�that France built her colonial 
empire between 188o and 1914. Ironically, France's ideo-
logical pretexts were not far removed from those of com-
munism. Marx deplored the cruel 'methods of the Euro-
pean powers (particularly those of Great Britain in India) 
in their seizure of territory and commercial rights in 
Asia; but he considered that, in the final analysis, this 
eruption of colonialism represented a progress in civili-
zation, for it would rouse the Asiatic peoples from their 
torp'or and plunge them "into the mainstream of historical 
development."* 
It is clearly a mistake to believe that only capitalism 
is imperialistic, or that the U.S.S.R. and China arc con-
genitally incapable of using their systeMs, of alliances to 
further their own economic, political, and military in-
terests at the expense of weaker nations. We may con-
clude, then, that there has been no more a revolution in 
the foreign policies of the communist countries than there 
has been internal revolution in those same countries. 
For the past fifty years, every road seems to have led to 
increased socialism. Every road, that is, except the socialist 
road. And the reason is obvious. The purpose of the 
second world revolution is to create real equality among 
men, and to give to men the political means to decide 
for themselves on the great matters affecting their destiny. 
Therefore, the concentration of all power�political, eco-
nomic, military, technological, judicial, constitutional, 
cultural, and informational�in the hands of an oligarchy, 
or even, in certain, cases (Stalin, Tito, Castro), of an 
autocracy must be the method least likely to lead to such 
a revolution. And, in fact, what happens under these 
oligarchies and autocracies is that the oligarchs and auto-
crats become more and more entrenched in their positions 
of power, and the solutions that society expects from 
them arc more and more rarely forthcoming. For, unfon 
tnnately, 'the qualities necessary to acquire power (eV= 
heroically) and to exercise power. (even ineffectually) arc

WASHINGTON POST 
BOOK WORLD 
19 September 1971 
THE BOOK, reviewed by Theodore Roszak 
The subtitle of this book in the original French was.. 
"ln nouvelle 'revolution rnondiale est commencer: aux 
Etots-Unis." ``The new world revolution has begun 
in the United .States"! 
Imagine how that brazen-, announcement comes across 
to French intellectuals who Were born believing they � 
hold the patent rights on revolutionary politics�and for 
whom the last word on America has long been Jean-
Paul Sartre's � The Respectful Prostitute. There must 
have been many who at once identified the book as 
satire. It isn't.- Revel means it. The man knows how to . 
be outrageous. 
The main audience this book addresses is the French 
left wing. Its real subject matter is the stagnation and 
self-congratulations (if French radicalism. Revel spends - 
about a third of his space ispecifically on France, lam-
basting radical nonperformance under the de Gaulle . 
ann Pompidou governments. Even- when he is talking 
about America, he is really using us like a whip on 
his left-wing compatriots. A witty, wickedly incisive 
polemic, this�and thoroughly French in substance and 
style. But Americans will find it fascinating to eaves-
drop on the argument. For Revel is a first-class political 
journalist (he is a leading , columnist for the liberal � 
weekly L'Express) and his, comments on the American 
scene hold many home truths. 
Moreover, what Revel lets us overhear about our-
selves is flattering�in the !extreme. Think of it: Here 
is an obviously sane, highl-y knowledgeable writer who 
has nice things to say aboUt us! That is very nearly a 
newsworthy event. Lots of book-reading Americans, by 
now lacerated to the bone, with our copious literature 
of national self-recrimination, will surely love Revel (as 
they did Charles Reich) for breathing a precious little 
zephyr of euphoria through the miasmic social climate. � 
Of course, Revel has his Own good reasons for lavish-
ing compliments on America. Idiot anti-Americanism is 
the hard .core orthodoxy of the European left; the 
demonology of every radical true-believer. So' Revel 
takes it deftly - to :pieces, in; the process giving even the 
most cynical American food for thought. 
more and more dominated, and less and less governed. In , 
Such a predicament, the question of whether one social 
system is better or worse than another becomes a matter 
of purely academic interest. 
For example, he reminds us that, by European stand-
ards, many of America's poor look almost like a corn-
�fortithle middle class. Further,, by comparison with � 
the current ane.mio condition of Frcnel>civil liberties, 
'Americans are living in the democratic promised land. 
. Again by comparison with France (where official, ins-
. official, 'and Self censorship now works to prune con-
America)) political forum 
Froversy at the roots) the 
�-,Ities Ns ith i�lth debate and action. 
And Revel goes on to marvel at how runny more 
Americans go to college and how many more books , 
they read; how dissent commands prime time on U.S. 
television; how Black Panthers are (occasionally) 
ex-
onerated by the courts; how issues as yet esoteric in 
some major European countries�like Gay ,and Women's 
Liberation, like environmental defense�fill our popular 
awareness. If we experience little and reludtant reform, 
Revel sees at least much vitality and originality of ap-
proach. He even concludes that America is "one of the 
least racist countries in the world today"�that is, inso- � 
frit. as racism here is under pressure by a lively mil-
itancy. Whereas in France, the growing number of 
exploited nonwhite aliens (now totaling some. four mil-
lion is still an invi.sible, powerless population. 
Or. be .r!l's balance sheet, we do indeed pick up lots 
of points against weak competition. Because the sitha-
tion in France ( always his main point 0r reference) :iris 
been dismal since de Gaulle, and especially since Vay 
'The left bank of Paris is all but under martial law 
each night; it swarms with surly cops checking identity 
papers. The crude harassment of students by, special 
polic.e squads (like the super tough CRS) is an open 
disgrace�but French courts have yet to decide a case 
against she gendarmerie. Moreover, when Revel poses 
America against the even gloomier backdrop of many 
communist and third world countries, our merits shine 
with brighter magnitude still. Myself. I cannol. cheer 
very loudly for teams that win by default. But then :li,-
crirninating comparisons have their place (I suppo,e) 
in any intelligent politics�though I think only a foreign 
observer like Revel could make the judgments in this 
1,:k sound like more than special pleading. 
In Revel's view,- .he FIlm total of America's relative .

countries are dismissed as non-starters. Much of Europe 
...ernains "mesmerized and immobilized by the past .. . 
pervaded by the idea that nothing can happen here." 
- But 
today in America a new revolution is rising. It is the 
revolution of our time. It is the only revolution that 
involves .radical. moral, and practical opposition to the 
spirit of nationalism...It is the only revolution that, to 
that opposition, joins cultuie, economic and techno-
logical power, and a total affirmation of liberty for all. 
. . It tlirefore offers the only possible escape for 
mankind today: the acceptance of -teChnological civ-
ilization as a means and not an end, and ... the ability 
to reshape-that civilization withoUt annihilating it. 
All the things Revel identifies as signs of the revolu 
tionary dawn have by now been much discussed in 
America: student radicalism, hippies, the militant mi-
norities, the new feminism, ecological activism, the con-
sumer crusaders, above all the massive war resistance. 
Revel even finds a small residue of radical, promise in 
Marshall MeLuhan and Playboy magazine. 
The revolution toward which these forces build, Revel 
ttrgues, is something "wholly new and . .. has nothing 
to do with the revolutions of the nineteenth century." 
By this-he means it must be constructively nonviolent

wise) ; it must use the system against itself, exploiting 
its many legal resources; it must rely on "prepared ex-
temporization," avoiding the doctrinaire paralysis of 
the European left wing where "everything that is work-
able is considered to be tionrevolutionary, and every-
thing that is revolutionary is nonworkable"; above all, 
it must have world government as its highest goal�
something I, cannot recall hearing much discussed 
among young radicals. 
That is not toO specific a program�but then only 
dilettantes and dimwits draw up detailed blueprints for 
revolution these days. I would take mOre issue with 
other aspects of Revel's analysis. I think he'grossly un-
derestimates.the American corporate economy's sheer, 
greedy, foolish inertia and the sad loyalty that a cor-, 
ruptcd establishment commands in mindless "middle 
America." Then too, he has the odd belief that economic 
growth�is the sine qua non of radical social change. But 
our bloated GNP is largely a proliferation of swanky 
garbage. Clearly, Zero :growth is the only sane econom-
ics for the industrial Societies�and the only economics 
that does not play into technocratic hands. 
Revel also plays down the importance of religious 
vision to the new radicalism (he is very secular-minded; 
hence- the "without Jesus" in the title) and gives little 
.attention to the liandicraft-communitarianism that is 
pioneering the counter culture. He is perhaps a little too 
hooked on obsolescent superindustrial values. 
'.Serious shortcomings, these. And yet Revel's shrewd 
.study stems from a sojouin of only a few- Months in

SHORT SUBJECTS 
Malaysia's Scarlet Pimpernel. The legendary Chin Peng, long-
time lea er of Malaysia's ghostly Communist Terrorist Organization, 
is once again leading his 1,500-man guerrilla force into Malaysia. 
Not long ago Malaysian Government security officials intercepted 
a Malayan Communist Party directive ordering Chin's guerrillas to 
move out of their Thai-Malaysian border sanctuaries and to 
reestablish their old bases and supply networks on Malaysian 
soil, A few weeks ago Malaysian Government troops discovered a 
Communist guerrilla training camp a few miles outside Ipoh, 
capital of tin-rich Perak State and one of Malaysia's major towns. 
The potential danger of a new outbreak of carefully planned 
militant Communism in Malaysia (attested to by foreign military 
attaches in Kuala Lumpur and neighboring Singapore) has revived 
all the old stories about Chin, widely known in Western circles 
as Asia's Scarlet Pimpernel. Chin, who has survived nearly three 
decades of hit-and-run existence dating back to the Japanese 
invasion of Malaya in World War II, began his career by supplanting 
his Communist camanding officer after finding the man with his 
hand in the Party till. An instant hero to his guerrilla followers, 
Chin carried out military action against the invading Japanese with 
such elan that the British awarded him the Order of the British 
Empire. By 1948 his love affair with the British had cooled as 
his guerrilla forces began their 12-year harassment of Camonwealth 
forces in Malaysia. The mini-war ended with the British driving 
the CTO to the Thai-Malaysia border, declaring themselves the 
victors and smartly departing the country. Since the departure 
of the Commonwealth forces, the CTO has harassed the Malaysian 
Government with major logistical support being furnished by the 
Chinese Communists. It is possible, in fact, that the present 
CTO forays, which are the deepest penetrations of Malaysian soil 
in many years, were ordered by the Chinese. A number of recent 
reports have placed Chin, in fact, temporarily in Peking. Happily 
for his Chinese benefactors he speaks fluent Chinese, 
The interest in Chin's flamboyant history, of which the preceding 
is only a part, plus the concern being expressed by foreign 
observers, has caused some observers to ponder about Peking's 
support for militant Communist forces in the less-developed nations. 
Peking recently initiated contacts with Kuala Lumpur which culminated 
in the exchange of trade missions. Peking also recently initiated 
contacts with Rangoon which culminated in the August visit of 
Burmese Premier Ne Win to Peking shortly after Burma's Kachin 
guerrillas agreed to accept Chinese aid for their insurgency

against the Ne Win: government In the midst of all this action 
on the government-to-government front, Peking has obviously 
remained as active as ever in offering secret tactical and logistical 
support for militant Communist forces in Malaysia and Burma and, 
implicitly, in a number of other nations as well.

The Smrkovsky Incident. Josef Smrkovsky, Chairman of the 
Czechoslovak parliament during the Prague Spring of 1968 and a 
key figure in the Dubcek regime, now expelled from the Party and 
living in Prague as a private citizen, gave an interview to the 
Italian weekly Giorni Vie Nuove (appearing in the 22 September 
1971 issue). The interview was a forthright condemnation of the 
fraudulent accounts of the events surrounding the Soviet invasion 
of Czechoslovakia and an exposure of current conditions. Especially 
poignant is his account of the fate of former Dubcek supporters 
and the article has caused a sensation in Western Europe. In the 
first place, Smrkovsky could speak as revealingly and authoritatively 
as almost anyone participating in the great Czechoslovak experiment, 
Second, his was an extremely courageous act since he obviously 
placed his personal safety in jeopardy at the hands of the 
current Czech regime. Finally, Giorni Vie Nuove was formerly an 
Italian Communist Party (PCI) organ and still is close to the 
Cannunist Party with its publisher a PCI Central Committee member. 
The interview was published in various European newspapers. 
A shortened version appeared in the London Times: 
The leading Czech Communist newspaper Rude Pravo attacked 
both Smrkovsky and the Italian magazine for the interview. At 
the same time the newspaper claimed the regime did not intend 
to make a "Smrkovsky case," and implied that he would not be pro-
secuted, though calling him a "traitor" and "renegade." 
The PCI in its official organ, l'Unita, took due note of the 
Rude Pravo attack and indicated its concern about the possible 
consequences to Smrkovsky. There have been unconfirmed reports 
about Smrkovsky's disappearance in Prague. No doubt the Soviet-
backed ,Husak regime would like to punish him, but it may be that 
current international publicity may be enough to prevent Smrkovsky's 
persecution.

7, October 19 71 
Q-uerr 
By Anthony Polsky 
Iltresla News Service 
KUALA LUMPUR, Malay-
sia�The erratic guerrilla 
warfare along Malaysia's 
jungled and mountainous 
border with Thailand is ex-
pected to reach a serious 
new stage next year, accord-
ing to documents reportedly 
captured by government se-
curity forces. 
Compared with guerrilla 
wars elsewhere in Southeast 
Asia, the Thai-Malaysia fron-
tier troubles have so far 
been little more than a se-
ries of skirmishes with occa-
sional casualties. 
The guerrilla bands are 
known as CTs�for Commu-
`errorists�but they are 
no all members of the out-
lawed Malayan Communist 
Party. They include bandits, 
Thai Moslem separatists dis-
affected from Bangkok's 
Buddhist government, and 
members of the Communist 
Party of Thailand, whose 
objectives differ from those 
of their Malaysian col-
leagues. 
The Malaysian army, 
which controls operational 
areas of the border, is dis-
inclined to extend facilities 
to foreign observers, partic-
ularly newsmen. But diplo-
mats and foreign military 
attaches both here and in 
neighboring Singapore say' 
insurgency in Malaysia i s 
reaching new dimensions. 
Prime Minister Tun Abdul 
Razak has commented on 
the resurgence. 
One of the most dramatic 
recent developments was 
the discovery of a Commu-
nist guerrilla training camp 
just a few miles outside 
Ipoh, capital of tin-rich 
Perak State. Ipoh is one of 
Malaysia's major towns and 
� 
GS 0171 litse in17 
such a camp could not have 
existed without clandestine 
support from some of the 
townspeople. 
Until quite recently, the 
guerrillas stayed in rela-
tively remote base areas on 
both sides of the border. 
They were regarded as a 
nuisance, not as a serious 
threat. 
Popular Support 
They had been driven to 
the border at the end of the 
Malayan Emergency in 1960 
after a 12-year campaign 
spearheaded by British 
Commonwealth forces. Ma-
laysia had gained independ-
ence in 1957. 
Malayan Communist 
Party leader Chin Peng, 
whose World War II anti-
Japanese exploits earned 
him a British award which 
was later rescinded, took the 
remnants of his bands 
across the border into Thai-
land. From there, they occa-
sionally crossed to harass 
Mals m patrols. 
Government security 
forces set about dismantling 
the Cominunist Party infra-
structure in Malaysia's cities 
and towns, but they never 
really succeeded. "The Brit-
ish did not completely de-
feat the guerrillas in the 
field," said one senior politi-
cal observer, a long-time res-
ident of this country. "But 
they played their trump po-
litical card. Once Malaysia 
achieved merdeka (inde-
pendence, or freedom) popu-
lar support for the guerril-
las dropped sharply." 
Today there is concern 
but little hard evidence that 
this urban infrastructure is 
being revived to support the 
Communists. The trairking 
camp uncovered near Ipoh, 
almost certainly derived its 
trainees and logistic support 
from the town. And in a can-
did interview the Sultan of' 
Perak�a member of the 
State Operations Council 
which deals, among other 
things, with insurgency 
problems�said the 'Commu-
nisiS were planning a 
"major cameback" next 
year. 
The number of guerrillas 
is anybody's guess, but 
1,200-1,500 hardcore fighters 
on both sides of the frontier 
is considered a reasonable 
estimate by independent in-
telligence sources. A year 
ago, Britain's crack Special 
Air Services troops were on' 
more or less continuous 
"training missions" along 
the central sector of the bor-
der. At that time, the guer-
rillas seemed to be orga-
nized into three regiments�
one in the Changloon trian-
gle along the border's west-
ern sector, around Kedah 
and Perlis states; a second 
\ in the mountainous central 
'sector around the Betong sa-
lient in upper Perak, and 
the third in the eastern sec-
tor, the Weng district, 
around Kelantan state. 
Small SAS units main-
tained contact with the abo-
rigines who live in Malay-
sia's mountains. The aborig-
ines, some of whom are in a 
special police force, are a 
prime source of intelligence 
because they know the al-
most-invisible jungle trails 
used by the Communist 
guerrillas. 
� But sometime during the 
,past year, the Malaysian 
-government requested that 
the British 'end SAS "train-
ing" in the frontier region. 
This was done despite evi-
dence that Malaysian secu-
rity forces�especially army 
units� have been unable to 
establish the same rapport 
with the aborigines. 
Politically, economically 
and racially, Malaysia now is 
going -.11 a delicate pe-
riod. The aation has largely' 
surmounted the immediate 
crisis caused by Malay-
Chinese riots in Kuala Lum-
pur in May, 1969, when more 
than 200 persons were � 
� killed. 
Tun Razak, who took over' 
the premiership from Tunku 
Abdul Rahman in Septem-
ber, 1970, has launched an 
economic development pro-
gram of crucial importance 
to the country's future. 
His government has deter-
:mined that a Major cause of 
the 1969 riots was the eco-
nomic imbalance between 
Chinese and Malays. (Ma-
lays comprise about half of 
the country's 10 million pop-
ulation. The other half is 
made up of Chinese and In-
dians and the tribal peoples 
of Borneo. Basically, the Ma-
lays control the government 
while the Chinese hold the 
economic power.) 
While Tun, Razak's gov-
ernment is trying to end the 
disparities, the Chinese in 
particular are bound to feel 
they are being inequitably 
treated because of Malay de-
velopment policies. Racial 
antagonisms have become 
somewhat hardened racial 
attitudes. And if each of the 
country's two major races is 
unwilling to be conciliatory, 
toward the other, Malaysia 
Is in serious trouble. 
The Communists, what-
'ever their actual numbers; 
obviously hope to capitalize 
on such problems.

17 September 1971 
over 
Joseph Smrkovsky was chairman of parliament and one of the most popular leading figures under Dubcek 
in the Czechoslovak leadership in 1968. After the Russian . invasion, he was progressively demoted and 
eNpeHed from the Communist Party in 11979. This is a shortened version of an interview given exclinsiNcly 
to the Italian 11-cekly paper Vie Nuove, edited by Pavide Lajolo, a communist deputy and member of the 
Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party. - 
Q. How do you yourself live? 
A. There are few reasons for 
contentment, none for joy. For 
two years now 1. have been 
almost daily the target of attacks 
in the press, on the radio and 
television and party meetings. 
My political as well as ray per-
sonal honour is being assailed. 
If truthful facts were being used, 
I could admit that this is criti-
cism, although one-sided. But 
it is not truthful information 
that they work with, and there 
is no way of defending oneself 
against slander and smear. 
PrOM.,M7=777=...,..4k4Akw.t....4.4=7,07446o1=41�564 
Q. What happened to your 
former collaborators and to 
people who held the same 
'political views as you did? 
A. My collaborators : they 
were all communists. They 
were erudite people, specialists, 
political scientists, economists, 
historians, party officials, trade 
unionists. etc. None of them 
holds a job today in which he 
can use his specialized know-
ledge. They all work as un-
skilled workers, . mostly on 
digging jobs in. the country. And 
they are supposed Co be happy 
to have got a job at all. One 
Of them, father of a family with 
two childreu, has been dn six 
months to 34 different factories, 
enterprises and institutions 
which advertised vacancies, but 
in, each -case�after a decision 
- taken by the local party 
organization--he was rejected. 
�Professors work as stokers onaa 
- warehouse attendants, former 
- ambassadors work as porters, a 
doctor is now a delivery-man, a 
journalist works as a driver. 
This has been the lot of the 
intellectuals and the former 
party and state offlicials who in 
1968 supported the then policy 
of the communist party and re-
fused to accept the occupation 
.of Czechoslovakia by the War-
saw Pact armies. If you do not 
endorse the occupation of your 
,country by foreign, troops you 
will lose your livelihood. 
Q Your attitude to August, 
1968, is well known and we do 
not, have to deal with it.. But in 
recent months Czechoslovak 
communications media have 
been claiming that the Warsaw 
Pact troops were invited to the 
country by a number of Czecho-
slovak party and state leaders. 
Would you comment tni this? 
A The third anniversary has hist 
passed of the moment when we, 
the praesidiu.m of the C011131111-
niq party central committer. 
were informed at 11.30 p.m that 
rthelaJe troops had crossed the 
borders of � our .country and 
would have it occupied by 6 am. 
Up to this day no one has said, 
no one has made public in the 
press who those people. were 
who issued � tlhot "invitation ". 
There has been sonic talk of 
the members of the National 
Assembly� of which I was the 
chairman at that time. Shortly 
after August 21 1068 the 
presidium of the National' 
Assembly asked all members- of 
the parliament, all deputies and 
members of ,the government to 
submit sworn statements in writ-
ing saying . whether anyone of 
them had invited the troops in. 
All 296 deputies (that is how 
many there were in the parlia-
ment at that time) submitted to 
the presidiuM their written state-
ments that they had not invited 
anybody, any troops to Czecho-
slovakia. 
Since when does a state or a 
group of states send its troops to 
another country at the request 
of " many " or " a number of " 
people, without the knowledge 
of the government. the parlia-
ment and other relevant organs 
of the country concerned? All 
that argument about an " invita-
tion" is just naive talk. 
sTha.t there were people in this 
country who wished it, that is 
another matter. And they would 
have signed. There have been 
such people. But at their " invi-
tation " troops do not come. In 
spite of that this justification of 
the military action in Czecho-
'slovakia is now to become- -; 
after various other versions�the' 
official version. And there are 
efforts to find an appropriate 
ideological justification. But 
why, then, arc both communists 
and non-communists in Czecho-
slovakia being compelled to de-
clare, one just like another, that 
they agree with the military 
occupation of the country and 
that this was correct ? They want 
to involve the whole nation in 
tih e blame-14h o ugh triter she 
event�so that in the future they 
will again he able to say that 
" we all made mistakes, we ail 
are guility "--just as they tried to 
do ;after the dark years of the 
1950s.

The present leadership of 
the communist party has re-
ferred to you many limes as a 
right-wing opportunist and a 
renegade. How would You 
yourself characterize your pre-
sent political standpoint ?

point today ? Thc same as in

would have approved the then 
policy of the party and which 
would have excluded from deci-

standards of relations between 
parties and states are brushed 
away, when the declaration of 
the international workers and 
communist movement on the 
rights of nations is turned into 
a piece of crumpled paper? 
Sovereignty: how many 
different ways have been tried 
to confuse people about 
sovereignty. The citizen, " the 
man in the street ". as he is 
sometimes called, possesses a 
normal brain and therefore he 
knows that the Czech and 
Slovak lands have belonged for 
the last 1.500 �years to the Czechs 
and the Slovaks and that in this 
country Czech and Slovaks 
should role over their affairs. 
over the affairs of their country 
and its people. and at the same 
time to 'stand up properly to 
commitments given to allies and 
friends. What is, however, a 
"limited sovereignty '', a "class 
sovereignty ". a sovereignty 
subordinated to internationalism 
and similar bunkum, according 
to which a nation is supposed to 
leave to someb,ody else its 
'inalienable right to determine its 
own destiny and th.e destiny of 
its country, even though that 
somebody be the dearest ally? 
If someone "cedes " this right.

However, in 1971 it is not

\Prague Liberal Says in Interview Barely 10% 
Back New Regime 
��� 
By PAUL ROI-MANN 
Soeclat to The New Yolk TarCs 
ROME, Sept. 17 -- Josef 
Smrkovsky, one of the leaders 
of the short-lived "Prague 
spring" of liberalization in 
1968, said in an interview pub-
lished by an Italian Communistl 
magazine yesterday that barely 
10 per cent of the Czechoslovakl 
people supported the present 
pro-Soviet regime. 
Now ill and under police 
surveillance in Czechoslovakia, 
Mr. Smrkovsky, who is 60 years 
old, declared that he considered 
his country's continued occupa-
tion by Soviet-bloc troops one 
� of the basic problems of the 
international Communist move-
ment. 
"Our people will never rec-
ognize the accomplished fact, 
will never resign themselves to 
it," Mr. Smrkovsky warned, 
"even if they were forced to 
raise arms every day to vote 
for the sending of resolutions 
and letters of thanks for that 
'fraternal help.'" � 
Mr. Smrkovsky said that 
anyone who approached him 
faced "persecution," that his 
former aides were under "in. 
supportable pressure," and that 
some Czechoslovaks were being 
held in jail without trial. 
Mr. Smrkovsky's statements 
appeared in an interv,.. e in 
Giorni-Vie Nuove of Milan, a 
magazine close to the Italian 
Communist party, the strong-
est in the west, although osten-
sibly independent of it. 
, _ 
I Authentic, an Editor Says I 
In a telephone interview, thel 
assistant editor of Giorni-Viei 
Nuove, Clemente Azzini, said 
the staff was convinced that 
the interview was authentic, 
and that a message recereed 
from Mr. Smrkovksy was un-
mistakably in his handwriting, 
The magazine's editor, Da-
vide Lajolo, is a Communistl 
deputy in parliament and.a for-
mer editor of L'Unita, the or-
'ficiel party organ. 
The cover of Giorni-Vie 
Nuove carried a photograph of 
Mr. Smrkovsky in a windbreak-
er and holding an ax. He looked 
old but vigorous. An autograph 
in Czech read: "Greetings to 
Friends�J. J. Smrkovksy-
1971. - 
The magazine did not 
identify the interviewer. Mr. 
Azzini said the reason was 
"to spare him trouble." He 
hinted that the interviewer was 
not Italian. 
Mr. Lajolo said in a commen-
tary printed with the interview 
that Giorni-Vie Nuove would be 
glad to print interviews with 
the present Czechoslovak lead-
ers. 
In the interview, Mr. Smrkov-
sky said he had "few reasons 
to be satisfied," because he had 
for the last two years bee; ::te 
target of, "one may say, c-e 
-te-ecles by Czechoslovak . 
papers, broadcasts and Cornmu-
nisi e. J. 
Mr. Seerkovsky said he had 
learned from an article in the 
Czechoslovak Communist party 
newspaper, Rude Pravo, last 
year that he had been expelled 
from the party, but had never 
been notified, Orally or in writ-
ing, which party organ had 
made this decision. 
Mr. Smrkovsky, chief of the 
Communist-led anti-Nazi resist-
ance movement in Prague dur-
ing World War II, was president 
of the National Assembly 
during the liberalization drive 
early in 1968. He was one of 
the main lieutenants of Alex-
ander Dubcek, then first secre-
tary of the party. 
Mr. Smrkovsky said in the 
interview that his former col-
laborators, all of them Commu-
nists and many highly 
educated, were in grave dif-
ficulties today. 
"All, of them work today as 
unskilled laborers, mostly in 
building projects outside 
Prague," Mr. Smrkovsky said, 
"and they must be glad to have 
found work. One of them, a 
father of two children, applied 
during six months at no fewer 
than 34 plants, enterprises and 
agencies that had job opening's, 
but was always rejected by de-
cision of the local party organi-
zations." 
"Former professors work as 
stokers or storeroom attend-
ants, former ambassadors work 
as janitors, former physicians 
are porters, former newsmen 
are drivers," he said. 
Many of these, Mr. Smrkov-
ksy charged, are living in mis-
iery," multiplied by the insup-
portable pressure on the con-
sciences of these comrades to 
force them to say that black is 
no longer black but white and 
vice versa." 
, Referring to the contention 
by the present leaders that the 
Soviet-bloc forces invaded 
Czechoslovakia on Aug. 21, 
1968, following requests from 
Prague, Mr. Smrkovksy re-
marked: 
"Up to this day nobody has 
told us, or printed in the news-
papers, who attended this fa-
mous 'invitation.'" � 
In 1968, Mr. Smrkovksy de-
clared, he and like-minded.com-
munists fought "for socialist 
democracy, for humanity in a 
socialist order." 
He said the main reason for 
the Soviet-bloc invasion was 
Moscow's determination to pre-
vent endorsement of this policy 
- - 
by the Czechoslovak party con-
gress that was to have met in 
September. 
Mr. Snarkovksy described the 
present leaders in Prague as a 
clique of cynical party bureau-
crats, but said he was confi-
dent that .his country would 
not e ,ise into the Stalinist 
ter,�oriLL.;. of the early nineteen-
fifties, "even though various 
trials have been held and 
though there are also persons, 
in prison without trial." 
This confidence was based, 
he said, on his belief that world 
public opinion today has a 
greater weight than 20 years 
ago.

Special correspondent cyj 
The Christian Science Monitor 
Vienna 
One of Alexander Dubcek's� most popular 
,aides during the .1968 "Prague spring" has 
'revived Communist acrimony over the So-
viet invasion, 
Josef Smrkovsky, humiliated, isolated, 
ridiculed -at home, has broken his silence 
:with the cooperation and evident approval. 
of the largest and most powerful Commu-
nist party outside the Soviet Union�the 
Italian. � 
The event could have serious implications. 
for international communism, which already 
is fraught with ideological squabbling. 
.Mr .Smrkoysky's criticisms came in the 
:form of a lengthy'question-and-ans�Ver inter-
;view published, in Italy by Vie Nuovi Giorni, 
la large circulation picture- weekly close to 
:the Italian Communist Party. 
As one of the most progressive radiniaers 
of the party Presidium and chairman of the 
National Assembly, Mr. Smrkovsky was 
closely associated with the democratizing 
reforms written into the action program, 
since suppressed in the "normalization" (the 
Soviet term for invasion) process. 
Forceful challenge 
His comments pose a forceful challenge, 
,to regime arguments on all counts covering 
the circumstanees of the InVasicin n�ly 
thing that has happened under. the cloak of 
"normalization" in Czechoslovakia since. 
To that extent an official reaction, and 
possibly some further sanctions against him, 
might appear ineviiable. 
In the interview, Mr. Smrkovsky ridiculed 
rthe contentions that the Soviets decided to 
intervene after an "invitation" from "re-
sponsible" Communists in Prague disturbed 
by events under Mr. Dubcek and the 
"threat" of "counterrevolution." 
"To this day," he said, "nobody has told 
us, or printed in the newspappy, who gave 
this famous 'invitation.'" 
Still more pertinently, he described ".the 
occupation- by Soviet forces and their con-
tinued presence as a problem on the "road 
to socialism" not only for Czechoslovakia ' 
but for all parties and the whole,.communist 
movement. 
zt.ec171 uaaer

"Our people," said Mr. Smrkovsky, "will 
never recognize the accomplished fact, will 
never resign themselves to it, even if forced 
every day to raise their hands for resolu-
tions and letters of thanks for that 'fraternal 
aid.' " 
Prepared indictment 
This was no "off the cuff" outburst by an 
embittered man. It was clearly a carefully 
prepared "indictment" made with the full 
approval of the powerful Italian Communist 
Party with which the Kremlin's relations 
have been gravely strained through the 
three years since the events of 1968. 
The protest was one of the most stoutly 
argued from the "liberal" side and must be: 
deemed the one most likely to command , 
popular sympathy and respect in Czech 
minds because it was made not by an �gr�
living outside, but by a man still living in 
the county, sharing its disappointments 
with that great majority which supported 
the reform movement. 
But whatever official Prague's anger�
and 'angered, indeed, one may assume it is 
�it is unlikely to act without the fullest 
consultation with the Soviet Party. 
It is not hard to see that any hasty, puni-
tive action would only sharpen differences 
between the Soviet party and the Italian. 
Rekindling held possinIe 
It could also rekindle all the old criticisms 
widespread in the international movement 
over the Soviet action against Czechoslo-
vakia. Moreover, it could disturb public 
bpinion'elses.,vhere at a time when the Soviet 
,leaders are concerned-to .gain.".goodwill,n4,, 
support for major policy initiatives on the 
general international scene. 
The Soviets do not normally pay much 
heed to other parties, where major ques-
tions are concerned. But they might be 
_reluctant just now to further aggravate their 
-relations with the Italians. 
The Italian party is unique. It is not only 
the largest outside the 14 parties in power. 
It also commands a big popular vote and 
cpuld conceivably come out on top, in a 
country where Moscow knows large areas 
of opinion are lukewarm on NATO and 
iiapcs it propaganda accordingly.

The implication is that the latter regards 
.the subject of the interview as one covering 
issues which need still to be considered�
as Mr. Smrkovsky himself suggested�
within the Communist movement and not 
just by parties directly concerned. 
So far 'Mr, Smrkovsky's comments have 
drawn no public reaction from the ruling re-

was publicly derided by the present party 
leader, Dr. Gustav Husak, becausd of a

zine showing him, a pensioner, sitting silent 
,and alone on a park bench.

UNITA REPORTS'ON'SWOVSKY 'ATTACK  
An article in RudeTravo, organ of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, 
signed by Vlacav Dolezala, bitterly attacks Josef Smrkovsky, who was 
President of the Czechoslovak Parliament and who today lives-inretirement 
in Prague, because of an interview given to the weekly'GiOrtiVie'NUOve, 
an interview that is described as slanderous. 
The article attacks Smrkovsky claiming that in the past he had two-faced 
contradictory positions, that he was treated with. Magnanimity-, And that today 
he supposedly is abusing it. 
The article says that there is no desire to open any Smrkovsky affair; 
for us it has been definitively closed. 
The article itself, however, asserts further on that, with this interview, 
Smrkovsky has placed himself on the side of the renegades and traitors and 
that he sold himself to the enemy against which he himself in the past more 
than once found himself face to face. 
[L'Unita Footnote]: 
We know how bitter can be the polemic within our own movement even if 
this is notthestyle we choose and if, moreover; we think that polemic should 
concern the subject matter of the positions enunciated from time to time. 
Moreover, We cannot but view with concern the appellations of 'renegades' 
and 'traitor' and 'bribed' used by'RUde'PraVO's journalist over an interview 
given to an Italian leftist weekly.
