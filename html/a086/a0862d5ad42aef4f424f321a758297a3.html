 EAST GERMAN NEWSPAPER CIRCULATION FIGURES.  According to East German
 published figures, there are 38 daily newspapers in East Germany, and
 their combined circulation exceeds 6,000,000 copies per day.  NEUES
 DEUTSCHLAND, East Berlin, official organ of ruling SED (Communist)
 Party, leads the dailies with a circulation of 800,000.  Other impor-
 tant dailies and their circulations are:  FREIE PRESSE (Karl-Marx-
 Stadt), 490,000; FREIHEIT (Halle), 400,000; LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG
 (Leipzig), 360,000; and VOLKSSTIMME (Magdeburg) with about 300,000.
 There are also eight large illustrated weekly newspapers in East Ger-
 many which have a combined circulation of nearly 4,000,000.  Comparable
 figures on other Eastern European countries are not readily available.
 The significance of the above figures is that in this Communist country
 there is one Party daily for every third citizen or about 75% percent
 of alI households in East Germany receive SED papers.  The circulation
 figures of the "non-Party" press is relatively low.   (UNCLASSIFIED)

 History   The Glorious Soviet
 Made to   Thirties
 Order
 Briefly Noted 0000"
 The Fiftieth Anniversary of
 the Bolshevik Revolution is
 an occasion for Communists to recall,
 not only the Revolution itself, (See
 BPG 199, Item #1055, 12 Sept. 66) but
 also the 50 years of Soviet rule
 which followed it.   On the whole,
 they would probably rather not recall
 those 50 years in too much detail,
 since there is much in the Soviet
 history of that period which is hard
 to reconcile with the current Soviet
 line, or indeed with any normal per-
 son's beliefs about how people ought
 to behave.   This is particularly true
 for the period of the 1930's.
 A Soviet historian, Vladimir
 Yakovlevich Klimushev, gave on 16
 January a broadcast talk for Soviet
 domestic audiences on "The Party in
 the Struggle to Build and Consolidate
 Socialism in 1933-1941."  Not surpri-
 singly, Klimushev emphasized the first,
 second, and third constitution; the
 "unification" of "the western Ukraine
 and western Belorussia" (i.e., Eas-
 tern Poland) with the USSR; the
 "restoration of the Soviet system"
 in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.
 His talk was more interesting for its
 omissions:
 1)  Stalin's name was mentioned
 only once, in its alphabetical
 position in a list of 15 party
 leaders.
 2)  No mention was made of mass
 deaths connected with collecti-
 vization.
 3)  No mention was made of
 the blood purges of party
 members, Red Army leaders,
 and "nationalists" follow-
 ing the murder of Kirov
 (December 1934) and lasting
 until 1939, taking a toll
 of over a million lives.
 4)  No mention was made of
 Stalin's use of slave
 labor camps.
 5)  No mention was made of
 the Nazi-Soviet pact, which
 made possible the Soviet
 annexation of Eastern Poland
 and the Blatic States:-- as
 well as encouraging Hitler
 to start World War II.
 All these events are apparently
 "unhistory," even more than in
 Khrushchev's day.
 Since Klimushev's talk was
 a live domestic broadcast, only
 those assets can refer to it
 which would plausibly have know-
 ledge of such broadcasts.   We
 have presented it here, however,
 as we suspect that it may typify
 other yet-to-be published Soviet
 treatment of the last 50 years
 during the anniversary year; we
 expect that articles and books
 will also appear which will be
 more notable, like Klimushev's
 broadcast, for what they do not
 say than for their actual con-
 tents. (This seems especially
 likely regarding Soviet leader-
 ship; thirty of the fifty years
 were under Stalin, and ten were

 claiming to carry on the functions of
 the former Ceylon secretariat (See BPG
 196, item #1048, dated 1 August 1966
 and item #1096 in this BPG).   In re-
 cent weeks representatives of the
 Peking-based Bureau have toured Asian
 and African countries trying to enlist
 support for a Peking-oriented writers
 conference which is to rival a Soviet-
 sponsored writers meeting to be held
 in Beirut from either 11-18 or 18-
 25 March.  A preparatory meeting for
 the Beirut conference was held in
 Cairo last November.  The Chinese have
 bitterly and repeatedly denounced the
 Soviet "splittist" activities.   On
 15 January NCNA reported that revolu-
 tionary writers, journalists, and other
 freedom fighters from 20 Afro-Asian
 "countries and regions" at a meeting
 in Peking on the 14th strongly con-
 demned the Soviet revisionist clique
 for having engineered the Cairo pre-
 paratory meeting for the "bogus" Third
 Conference of Afro-Asian Writers.  But
 it would seem that the Chinese have
 failed so far to muster the necessary
 support for their meeting -- for they
 have not as yet announced a date or

 The February Revolution Approaches
 Its 50th Anniversary
 The liberal Russian revolution, called the "February Revolution"
 because it began on February 23rd on the Old Style (Julian) Calendar,
 broke out 50 years ago.   (On our modern calendar, on 8 March 19171i')
 This popular uprising, in which workers and soldiers really fought for
 freedom, made hopes rise throughout the world.  It seemed that demo-
 cracy had triumphed in the citadel of absolutism.
 Unfortunately, hopes for Russian liberty where shattered in the
 so-called October Revolution eight months later -- actually a Bolshe-
 vik "putsch," without mass participation.  The Communists are already
 celebrating the October Revolution; we should see to it that the.real
 revolution is not forgotten.

 The Real Russian Revolution," issued last September 12th in BPG No.

 CHRONOLOGY
 The Chinese "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" (CPCR)
 Reporting on the tumultuous events in China has further increased and
 is more confused than ever.  Posters appear in the name of various Red Guard
 units from institutions in Peking and in other cities, and posters attack-
 ing a certain leader have sometme6 disappeared a few hours later, replaced
 by others defending the sam individual.  Newspapers and radio stations
 announce that they have been taken over by Maoist "revolutionary rebels"
 who have seized power from "the handful of persons in authority who are fol-
 lowing a reactionary, revisionist line":                        however, the Maoists claim that
 some of these "take-overs" are phoney, staged by oppositionist elements
 sailing under false colors ("waving the Red Flag to oppose the Red Flag")
 to "hoodwink" the people.  As of the end of the period, it appears that the
 press organs in 11 of the 27 provincial capitals have been taken over by
 Maoist rebels, and the radio stations in 11 (not entirely identical) -- but
 this is far from "hard" information, and new developments are reported
 daily:  two of the radio take-overs -- Kunming (Yunnan Province) and Harbin
 (Heilungkiang) -- are reported on the last day of our period, the 30th.
 Under these circumstances, it is hardly practicable to follow our
 usual chronological pattern.  Instead, we will attempt to provide an out-
 line summary of what seem to be the principal developments, with specific
 reference to, or quotes from, only the "hardest" items:  i.e., articles
 from main Chinese press organs or radios or eyewitness accounts by compe-
 tent observers.
 A.  The story behind the GPCR:  materials appearing in Peking during the
 first week of January  posters and wall newspapers describing speeches by
 Mao and Lin Piao to the October "Work Conference" of the CCP/CC, confirmed
 in part by the January 1 RED FLAG/PEOPLE'S DAILY joint editorial) provide
 the following information on the genesis of the CR, from the Maoist point
 of view:
 -- Mao reportedly says that he erred in 1958 when he relinquished all posi-
 tions other than Party Chairman, leaving Teng Hsiao-ping GenSecy and Liu
 Shao-chi Chief of State.  They gradually consolidated their grip on the
 party and state, which steadily drifted away from a true Maoist course.
 "Mao tried to rectify the situation by taking up the problem at the ...
 (CC meeting) in September and October 1965.  However, Mao could not ...
 because the capital had already been firmly fortified by a group of anti-
 Party revisionists led by Peng Chen, former Peking mayor and the first to
 suffer in the current purge.  Therefore, Mao had no choice but to leave
 Peking and go to Shanghai in order to launch his attack against the revi-
 sionist group in the capital."  (Tokyo YOMIURI's Peking correspondent on
 Jan. 6.)  (Note:  it was a Shanghai paper, LIBERATION DAILY, which in Nov.
 1965 published the first Yao Wen-yuan article seen as launching the CR.)

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400070008-4
 -- For 8 months, the CR was apparently limited largely to inside maneuvering
 at the tcp of the Party, during which Lin Piao's stature visibly increased:
 we still have little more than published editorials and articles as evidence
 of what xeally happened during this period.
 -- By late May, Mao was ready to move against Peng and carry his CR to the
 "people" -- with first priority to the universities.  As the Jan. 1 joint
 RF/PD editorial puts it:
 "On 1 June 1966, Chairman Mao decided that the country's first
 M-L big-character poster, posted first at Peking University, should
 be publicized.  This kindled the raging flames of the GPCR and set in
 motion the mass movement which has as its, main target for attack the
 handful of persons within the Party who are in authority who took the
 capitalist road...."
 Simultaneously, the Maoist press carried a series of purple editorials on
 the urgent need to head off a full-scale revisionist counter-revolution
 (a parallel to Hungary was mentioned).  During the months of June and July
 (with Mao out of Peking again), the CC sent out a number of "work teams" to
 prosecute the CR:  however, it is now revealed by posters that the teams
 often tended to counter extreme demands and violence by local groups, then
 already bearing the "Red Guards" name.
 Returning to Peking late in July, Mao was dissatisfied with the perfor-
 mance of the Party's work teams:  either before or during the August 1-12
 plenum (where, although strongly supported by Lin Piao, Mao and his sup-
 porters reportedly were a minority), he decided to take the conduct of the
 CR away from the Party apparatus and give it to the "masses," represented
 by the Red Guards.  Unleashed at the huge Aug. 18 rally, the Red Guards
 rampaged wildly throughout the country:  their actions seemed to be increas-
 ingly directed against the established Party bureaucracy.
 -- Obviously demoted in standing and of uncertain status, President Liu and
 GenSecy Teng apparently felt impelled at the October "Work Conference" to
 offer "self-criticism" of certain errors, principally in misguiding the work
 teams sent out during Mao's absence, thereby opposing the CR:  the Maoists
 denounce this self-criticism as superficial.
 B.  December highlights:  Mao's wife, Chiang Ching, appears in a leading
 role in the CR, becoming cultural advisor to the Army, dominating a mass
 meeting, publicly revealing opposition to the CR in top Party circles and
 implicitly acknowledging that the Maoists are a "temporary minority."  Liu
 and Teng are repeatedly denounced as leaders of the "bourgeois, reactionary
 opposition" to Mao, Peng Chen and others are arrested and publicly humiliated,

 -- and Tao Chu, CCP Propaganda Chief and leader of the CR (who had made
 the ar,,reef leap" from w rankiri? so~,_,ewhere around 90th in the hierarchy to a
 com.s-,o:;.cuoizs l-th in 1966, and who personally made the first p .r 11c ch=arges
 against Liu and Teng), falls victim of concerted attacks by the end of the
 month.  As the month ends, the Maoists make the (possibly fateful) decision
 to carry their GPCR into the factories and fields, insisting defensively
 that it would help, not hinder, production:   the  charter and marching order
 for this  new sit'.Aation" are c,et forth in the  i -:Iortant Jan. 1 joint RED
 FLAG/PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial.
 C.  "Civil war" in Januai  :  The decision to carry the CR into industry
 brings strong opposition from the entrenched bureaucracy in provinces and
 cities throughout the land, from the local Party organizations and adminis-
 trative organs, Party-controlled labor and other mass organizations, and
 from masses of workers.  Numerous reports tell of bloody battling against
 Red Guard intrusions, strikes and widespread disruption of production and
 transport, etc.  The Maoists launch a drive to "seize power" from the
 existing organs - still referred to as "a handful of persons in authority in
 (the local) Party Committee who have taken the capitalist road.".   Follow-
 ing traditional Communist tactics, they aim their top-priority "take-over"
 efforts at the communications media.  Reporting of developments in the pro-
 vinces thus tends to convey only a Maoist picture:   a series of victorious
 take-overs, with negative developments acknowledged only after it can be
 reported that they have been overcome.  By the 23rd, Mao orders the Army,
 heretofore held to a "non-interference" policy, to intervene on behalf of
 the Maoist "revolutionary rebels" when necessary, though a subsequent CC
 Military Affairs Committee directive prescribes moderation and "persuasion"
 rather than force.  By the end of the month, Maoist media are triumphantly
 reporting examples of take-overs in which Army units have played a decisive
 role, --- even against large military formations such as the reported
 20,000-man "August First Field Army" in Sinkiang, said to contain a quasi-
 military division of demobilized soldiers.
 Note the increasing stature of Chou En-lai as a moderator, nominally
 loyal to Mao but publicly condemning extremes and urging moderation, even
 though he is occasionally attacked (and quickly defended) by posters.  Four
 persons seem to be at the top of the Maoist team, the Mao pair, CR chief
 Chen Po-ta, and Army chief Lin Piao.   (The latter has not been seen publicly
 since November and there was some speculation as to his status when a major
 purge of the Army's CR group was announced on the 11th, but his role would
 seem to be enhanced since the Army has openly entered the struggle.)  On the
 other side, Liu and Teng still seem to enjoy the support of a large majority
 of the Party CC and apparat, to the degree that the Maoists feel unable to
 go beyond verbal attacks on them.
 The following seem to be the most significant specific developments
 of the period:
 (1)  The "Shanghai example":  Within the first week of January bloody bat-
 tling, strikes, etc, are reported in various places.  The first and bitterest

 fighting apparently begins on Jan. 3 in the major industrial city of Nanking,
 where, after almost a thousand casualties, Red Guard attacks are repelled
 by public security forces supported by the Army, with the arrest of 6,000
 of the `rebels."  (Nanking seems to be still controlled by the old Liu-
 loyal bureaucracy.)
 On Jan. 5th, however, the local radio in Shanghai, largest of all Chi-
 nese cities, announces that one of the two principal S. dailies, WEN HUI
 PAO, on the 4th ''determined to lean on ... the side of the proletarian
 revolutionary line represented bychairman Mao ... (and) turned itself into
 a paper of the rebel revolutionaries."  A "message to the people in S. from
 11 revolutionary rebel organizations in S., including the S. workers' rebel
 HQ'' follows.  It tells how the "handful of persons..." tried to suppress the
 revolution by various devious meart8, including inciting the masses ("with
 the appearance of extreme 'leftists' and the sweetness of 'revolutionary'
 words") to sabotage production by leaving their jobs and going "north" to
 "deliver an indictment."  Next day, S. radio announces that the other prin-
 cipal paper, LIBERATION DAILY (which in Nov. 1965 first published the first
 CR article), "has also been placed under the new management of the rev.
 rebels."  Various materials from these papers describing "the present excel-
 lent situation of the GCR in S." are broadcast over the next few days,
 including a commentary on the 8th which concludes that "the bourgeois
 reactionary line is now approaching total collapse."  On the 9th, however,
 all carry an "urgent notice issued today by the rev. rebellion HQ of S.
 workers and 31 other rev. mass organizations" which names the Shanghai
 Municipal Party Committee (SMPC) as leading the opposition:
 "... We hereby solemnly warn the SMPC that no schemes aimed at shift-
 ing the line of struggle through disrupting production, interrupting
 communications, and increasing wages and material benefits will ever
 succeed...."
 Because (as noted below) Maoist media publicize this notice throughout
 the land as a model for all rebels, we briefly outline its 10 points:
 1.  "Grasp the revolution and stimulate production."
 2.  Take prompt action to persuade and mobilize workers and functionaries
 who are exchanging rev. experience elsewhere to return to S. immediately.
 3.  Authorizations for travel for exchanging rev, experience are cancelled,
 and money advanced must be repaid.
 4.  The "circulating funds" of all offices, organizations, and enterprises
 are frozen.
 5.  "Matters related to the readjustment of wages, and back payment of wages
 and material benefits," shall be dealt with later.
 6.  Paying students higher wages for labor when they are integrated with
 workers and peasants "is a revisionist practice pure and simple" and must
 be stopped.

 7.  Seizing or inciting to seize public buildings, including houses confis-
 cated from capitalists, shall be dealt with by law, and "those who moved
 into houses seized by force must.move back to their original lodgings
 within one week."
 8.  Those opposed to Mao, Lin Piao and the CR shall be immediately arrested.
 9.  All rebels must immediately carry through the above points `'and turn
 on all organs of propaganda to popularize them and educate the masses."
 10. Anyone violating these points shall, after investigation, be immediately
 punished.
 The extent of the disruption which had actually prevailed in Shanghai
 is revealed during the following weeks as the media report a continuing
 series of "victories"  against sabotage:  the end of strikes in electricity
 and water services, rail transport, shipping and shipbuilding, etc.
 On the 15th, S. radio declares that the grouping of 32 organizations
 which had signed the "urgent notice" was "completely under the control of
 the SMPC," used as "a tool by the SPCC," and "has already been smashed to
 pieces," -- as it announces the formation of a new"Workers Rev. Rebel
 Liaison Dept." to replace the old.
 An unconfirmed report in the Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST on the
 25th from its S. correspondent tells how the S. mayor and a large group of
 former SMPC officials have been paraded through the city for several days
 in open trucks wearing dunce caps and bearing placards.  But, on the 28th
 S. radio broadcasts a new "urgent notice" to workers in the suburbs and
 rural areas, its tone betraying concern about the situation outside the city.
 (2)  The battle against "economism":  Two top-level documents are published
 on Jan. ll* --
 (a) agreetinas message signed by the CCP/CC, the State Council, the Mili-
 tary Affairs Committee of the CCP/CC, and the Cultural Revolution Group
 under the CCP/CC, to the signatories of the Shanghai "u_rgent notice":  it
 calls their "rev. actions... a brilliant example" and calls on "the workers,
 peasants, rev. students, rev. intellectuals, and. rev. cadres throughout
 the country to take concerted action and to beat back the new counterattack..."
 (b) aJoint RED/FLAG PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial." "Oppose econoraism and smash
 the latest counterattack by the bourgeois reactionary line."  It says that
 the Shanghai "urgent notice" has "vividly and penetratingly revealed the big
 conspiracy of the reactionary elements ... using the 'sugar-coated bullets'
 of economic benefits to seduce a part of the masses."  This is `economism,"
 "garbage picked up from the rubbish dump of old style and modern revisionism,"
 which "uses bourgeois ultrademocracy to replace proletarian democratic
 centralism," etc.

 "It is a form of bribery that caters to the psychology of a few
 backward people among the masses, corrupts the masses' revolutionary;
 will, and leads the ... masses onto the wrong road ... to disregard
 the interests of the state and the collective ... and to pursue only
 personal and short-term interests...."
 *Wall posters on the .10th stated that Mao had returned to
 Peking to take personal pharge of the CR.
 (3)  A PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on the 22nd frankly admits:
 "... Right from the beginning., the GPCR has been a stride for the
 seizure of Dower....  He who has power has eve    int:  he who is
 without tower has nothing.  Of all the important things, the posses-
 sion of power is most important!
 Such being the case, the revolutionary masses, with a deep
 hatred for the class enemy, grind their teeth and, with steel-like
 determination, make up their minds to unite, form a great alliance,
 and seize power.'  power:::       and more power:::"
 (4)   Therm enters the fra :  On the same day, Mao is reported (by a
 poster appearing on the 23rd) as ordering Lin Piao to rescind the old
 directive on "the so-called non-interference" (which is now "false non-
 interference") and issue a new order that the Army should send help to
 "the leftwing and revolutionary masses" when they ask for it.  On the
 23rd, NCNA declares that "the commanders and fighters of the three services
 of the Chinese PLA have pledged their most resolute support to the rev.
 rebels seizing Party, state, financial, and other power...," -- carried
 as top news by all media on the 24th.  LIBERATION ARMY DAILY makes it
 official policy in a short editorial on the 25th.:and a follow-up on the
 27th.  The former sets the rationale:
 "The struggle to seize power constitutes a general counter-
 offensive against the attacks launched on the proletariat in the
 last 17 years by the bourgeois agents who wormed their way into the
 Party....  It is a conscious mass movement drawing in hundreds of
 millions of rev. people under the command of Mao Tse-tung's thought....
 The PLA must firmly support end assist them (the proletarian revolu-
 tionaries), for this is a vital call from our great leader Chairman
 Mao....  Even though they  may be just a minority temporarily, we
 must support them without the slightest hesitation.
 Some people use 'non-intervention' as a pretext to suppress
 the masses in reality.  This is absolutely impermissible....
 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'  The
 political power of the proletariat seized by the people's army
 with the gun, too....   We must follow Comrade Lin Piao's instruc-
 tion...."

 Some indication that this mandate was given ex post facto is seen
 in a wall newspaper reported in Pelting on the 23rd describing the dispatch
 of PLA troops on the 22nd to Fangshan, only 2  miles southwest of Pekin
 to defend rev. rebels who had beenlbeaten and imprisoned by security
 forces when they launched an unsucgessful attack against anti-revolu-
 tionary elements on the 20th.  "The dispatch of Army troops to Fangshan
 served greatly to raise the morale of the rev. rebels and to dishearten
 the reactionaries," the paper said; -- and this phrase is repeated through-
 out the remainder of the period, as Maoist media report the successful
 intervention of the Army in Harbin, Changchun (Kirin Province),
 Huhehot (Inner Mongolia), Hofei (Anhwei), and other places.
 (5)  Dissension and purges in the Army:  Liu Chih-chien, Deputy Director
 of the Army's Gen. Political Dept. and official responsible for purging
 the Army of anti-Maoist elements, is denounced by a Jan. 9 poster for
 blocking the purge:   he is among the missing from the'4iamelist of members"
 of the newly reorganized "cultural revolution group" of the Army publicized
 on the 11th.  At the head is Hsu Hsiang-chien, with Chiang Ching (Mrs.
 Mao) as his Advisor.  However, five of the 18 members named are strongly
 attacked by posters within the following days, including Hsu himself and
 his First Deputy, Hsiao Hua (the latter two subsequestly defended by
 Chou).  Other prominent military coming under heavy attack include the
 80-year-old hero Chu Teh, the politically powerful Ho Lung, and Tang
 Ping-thou, editor of the LIBERATION ARMY JOURNAL.  Lin Piao is reported
 as having denounced Ho Lung, -- but the denunciation of Hsiao Hua, an old
 associate of Lin's, is attributed to Chiang Ching, -- and so it goes!
 It is worthy of note that Ho Lung's nephew, Yang Shang-kun, purged
 last summer from his job as CC Secretary, is accused by Red Guard wall
 newspaper COMBAT on the 19th of being "an important spy" who has "often
 conferred secretly with the Soviet Ambassador and conveyed important
 secret documents to the USSR," "installed microphones in the residence
 of Mao Tse-tung to spy on him.," etc.  Yang is accused of plotting a coup
 d'etat with three other purged leaders:  Peng Chen, former Army Chief of
 Staff Lo Jui-thing, and Culture Minister Lu Ting-i.
 (6)  Denunciations and purges of other figures:  Few of the top figures
 in the Party, state and society have escaped denunciation during this
 period, but it is difficult to determine who has been purged and who is
 still on his job.  Public humiliation seems to be a good criterion, and
 the three named at the end. of the above paragraph were exiong 20 shown
 bearing placards in photos displayed in Peking early in the month.
 (7)  Seizure of power at the top:  According to a wall newspaper posted
 at the Peking Municipal Party Committee HQ on Jan 29, a "Peking Revolu-
 tionary Rebel Communeestablished at a "congress of representatives
 of the worker, peasant, soldier and student rev. rebel factions" of 30
 ""revolutionary organizations" meeting on the 28th in response to Chen
 Po-ta's call, "will assume ant' execute the overall power of Peking

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400070008-4
 Municipality."  The 30 orgEuIzations are identified as:  "the Institute
 of Politics and Law, which seized the Public Security Bureau; the Mao
 Tse-tung Thought Combat Corps of the Broadcasting Administration Bureau,
 which seized the central Radio Station; and the Chingkang Shan Corps
 of the Teachers' College, which supported the Maoist faction in repub-
 lishing PEOPLE'S DPILY; as well as organizations embracing wide circles,
 such as the Academy of Sciences, the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, etc."
 The take-over of 11 or 12 central ministries had been reported
 during the period Jan. 14-19, as well as the Peking Public Security
 Bureau on the 9th and Peking Radiolon the 15th.  What the rule of the
 new "Commune" in Peking will mean i`or the nation as a whole remains to
 be seen.
 Meanwhile Maoist media have reported a continuing series of take--
 overs of provincial and municipal media, institutions, local administra-
 tions and Party Committees throughout the land, often with considerable
 confusion and leaving much room for doubt as to the validity of the claims.
 (8)  Noteworthy Miscellany:   (a)  Beginning with Copenhagen on the 8th,
 news media in various capitals around the world report the departure of
 Chinese personnel for Peking, presumably to face the CR:  it is indicated
 that a large part of the diplomatic staffs and most students and other
 personnel are involved.
 (b)  Radio Peking on the 29th announces:  "the State Council has decided
 that there will be no holidays during the spring festival of 1967.  The
 spring festival home leaves of workers will be postponed."  ("Spring
 festival" is the Communist label applied to the traditional lunar new
 year celebration.)
 (c)  Various posters and wall papers have used the terms "Crimson Guards"
 and "Red Flag units," presumably to apply to groupings of adult Maoist
 shock troops, complementing the youthful Red Guards.
 (d)  Posters reported on Jan. 27 say that the 77-year-old former Acting
 President of the Nationalist  Chinese Government, General Li Tsung-jen,
 who defected to Peking from his exile in the U.S. in 1965, was arrested
 as an "American agent," -- on testimony of his young Wife of less than
 a year!
 (e)  Liu Shao-chi's son, Liu Yun-jo, identified as leader of the "916
 Revolutionary Rebellion Regiment" of the 7th Machinebuilding Ministry
 (aircraft), is reported as criticizing his father at a mass rally on the
 6th: on the 20th he is reported arrested on charges of spying for a

 Chronology Continued
 Throughout the period:  Soviet and other Communist media continue their
 recent pattern of coverage of events in China.
 January 3:  Czech agency CTK publicizes a statement by SecyGen Saillant of
 the Prague-based WFTU  on "the illegal and drastic measures ... taken by
 special groups in the CPR ...  against the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions" (reportedly closed late December).
 NCNA Cairo describes an AAPSO press conference at which the Soviets
 tried unsuccessfully to stop the Chinese Liang Keng from finishing a state-
 ment, aroused the indignation of the participants, and finally, with "their
 handful of followers," "fled amidst cries of 'renegades!' and 'shame!""
 The Chinese finished and was applauded.
 January k:  Radio Moscow gives its version of the above press conference:
 the Chinese tried to "spread coarse slander against the peace-loving policy
 of the Soviet Union," but met with a worthy rebuff and "shouts of 'shame!""
 from those present.  AAPSO SecyGen as-Sibai declared the conference closed
 after the Soviet walk-out and himself left the hall, while the Chinese
 "continued to talk alone!"
 NCNA Budapest reports that Li Shou-pao, Chinese Secy to the World
 Peace Council, denounces the WPC Secretariat for "scheming and playing
 tricks on the extension of his Austrian visa," so as to oust him from the
 Vienna WPC HQ, -- blaming it all on manipulation of the WPC by the Soviet
 revisionists.
 In a Moscow press conference, the three Soviet correspondents ousted
 from China in December (#9) condemn Chinese anti-Soviet actions and the CR
 in general.  They particularly object to Chinese statements attributed to
 anonymous Soviet citizens supporting Mao's line.  "Chinese newspapers are
 not beyond even using fake documents.  Thus they published ... an anonymous
 letter from 'one Soviet Komsomol member.'  Krushinskiy, who earlier worked
 in Chinas as a translator, remarked that the specific expressions and
 vocabulary used in this 'letter' showed clearly that it was originally
 written in Chinese...."
 January I--8:  The French CP holds its 18th Congress, with observers from
 "more than  0" foreign CPs, including two ministers from Hanoi and a Viet-
 cong delegation, -- but none from China or Albania.  Denunciations of
 Chinese policies come throughout, from SecyGen Rochet's opening report,
 through Soviet chief delegate Pelshe's speech on the 6th to the closing
 resolution, -- which calls for the convocation of a world CP conference
 "as promptly as possible."  Pelshe on the conference says the CPSU agrees
 with other FPs that favorable conditions are being created and declares
 that "more than 60 parties have come out in favor" of it.

 the CC  members sided with him.  Boffa claims major issues were:  (a) Peng

 the latter opposed Lin Piao's urge to promote the international scope of
 Maoism.   Boffa says that Liu, Teng and Pend; are by no means pro-Soviet but

 the differing views of the two parties and accepted by the CCP delegation
 of Chou En-lai, Peng Chen, Kang Sheng, Liu Ning-i, and Liao Cheng-chih.

 gles should be organized against 'Soviet revisionism' but whether a
 revolutionary double-faced policy should be pursued toward the CPSU
 leadership --- which is now being forced to take a double-faced atti-
 tude in the face of the ferocious escalation of U.S. imperialism's
 aggression in Vietnam and under pressure from the international anti-
 imperialist forces -- so that their activities for an anti-imperialist
 united front can be encouraged and, at the same time, their misbehavior

 January 21 and continuing:  Cino--Soviet relations plunge to a ner low as a
 result of the Chinese blow-.up of a new incident of ':cloo~'y Soviet repres
 lion of Chinese students.'' (See March?4, 1965, and continuing:for:earlier
 case.)  It begins at noon on the 25th as a group of 69 Chinese students
 returning from Europe to face the Cat mount a demonstration at the Lenin
 I?ausoleum in Red Square.  According to Soviet accounts,, they ''took out
 booklets with quotations from Mao Tse-tung and, on command, raised them
 over their heads and began shouting anti-Soviet slogans.`  ?-?hen the militia
 (police) tried to get them to move on and stop blocking entrance to the
 mausoleum, "they began insulting Soviet citizens standing nearby and caus-
 ing unrest,`' going 'so far as to strike a woman in the face'.` and "stomping
 on'' another.  According to the Chinese Embassy protest, as the peaceful
 Chinese "began to read aloud quotations from Chairman P.ao Tse--tung after
 standing in silence, Soviet troops and police pushed and beat up the women
 students among them.  Then, as the Chinese students turned to sing. the
 Internationale, a large number of Soviet troops,, .!policerien, and plainclothes-
 ment attacked them. from all sides and beat them up, thus committing a s
 serious, shocking, and bloody incident."  The note declares that Soviet
 Vice Foreign Minister Firyubin, who finalll,r received the Chinese Embassy
 charge d'affaires at 1920 in the evening after stalling; hire off all after--
 noon,, keeping him standing outside on the lawn more than an hour, "made a
 verbal statement which reversed right and wrong," and "even had the cheek
 to lodge a protest with the Chinese :anbassy."
 A Chinese Foreign ,'inistry statement next day expands the incident in
 the most "undiplomatic" language :
 "... Listen, you chieftains of Soviet revisionism, Brezhnev, Iosygin,
 and the like:  all those who suppress student movements, all those who
 enforce fascist rule over the people, and all those who betray the
 revolution will core to no good end!  The German, Italian, and Japanese
 fascists ... Chiang Kai-shek ... t ,aeT.gaar.... Kautsky ... Khrushchev

 their blood in the streets of Moscow....  All these debts must be

 ,P..ZOPLE' S DAILY editorial, ":zit Back Hard'" on the 27th uses the most
 inflammatory language yet:
 "... Listen, you handful of filthy Soviet revisionist swine.  The
 Chinese people ... are not to be bullied!"
 Blatantly appealing again for "the Soviet people to rise in rebellion,",
 it concludes:
 "We believe that the brilliant red banner of M-L, the thought of
 Mao Tse-tung, will one day be fluttering high over lied Square and in
 the Homeland of the October Revolution! ... Long live the all-conquering
 thought of Mao Tse-tung!"4

 Simultaneously, massive round the"?cloc'.L demonstrations around the Sov

 "Tine general wave of anti `.soviet hatred is being stirred up b-r
 leaflets spread all over the city asserting that 'scores of Chinese
 students were killed and wounded' in Moscow.   The fanatical crowds
 are chanting:    Tooth for tooth, blood for blood."
 A Soviet Foreign Ministry press conference on the 28th emphasizes the
 planned, provocative nature of the incident, denies the Chinese version of
 events, and adds that before their train was very far out of Moscow, all
 but five of the 20 bandaged students had "apparently gotten tired of the
 bandages and plaster" and removed them.
 The Chinese hold an unuurecedented Dress conference in i..oscowr also on
 the 28th, excluding the Soviet press? to display "one of the wounded Chi-
 nese students" and tell his lurid story.  they also present the "chief
 surgeon of the neurosurgery section of the 'anti--imperialist' hospital'' in
 Peking who flew to Moscow especially to treat the wounded students and who
 gives grim reports on the extent of injuries.
 On the 28th,, :`."C'_ A Ea hdad reports a new fascist atrocity when "more

 1096.                        AAPSO's Problems:
 Council Meeting in Nicosia
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   (UNCLASSIFIED)  The 8th Council session of the Cairo-
 based, non-governmental Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organization
 (AAPSO) in Nicosia, Cyprus (13-17 February  1967) may well lead to a
 split in the AAPSO movement -- similar to the one that has already
 occurred in the Afro-Asian Writers' Bureau (see BPG 196, Item #1048,
 dated 1 August 1966) -- a split which would turn AAPSO, Sino-Soviet
 tension-ridden for several years, into a sham organization.   Since the
 organization's inception, the Soviets, the Chinese and the Egyptians
 have exerted decisive influence in its policy-making Council but, in
 recent years, bitter Sino-Soviet feuding has seriously impeded AAPSO's
 organizational and other activities, and has disappointed and angered
 those Afro-Asians who support it for the attainment of constructive
 goals.   It is important to recall that Egyptian alignment with the Sov-
 iets in the AAWB was a determining factor last year in the splitting
 of that organization which had come under Chinese control in 1962:   in
 a Soviet-engineered, Egyptian-backed AAWB "extraordinary" meeting in
 Cairo last June, the AAWB secretariat was transferred from Colombo to
 Cairo and the Chinese subsequently announced the transfer of the AAWB
 secretariat to Peking.
 Chinese Have Lost Ground.   Until about a year ago, Soviet and Chi-
 nese influences in AAPSO's Permanent Secretariat in Cairo had been
 roughly balanced.   The Chinese then lost ground after the departure from
 the Secretariat to Peking of the Indonesian delegate, following the
 coup in Indonesia, and after a more recent split in AAPSO's Japanese
 affiliate which formerly was a supporter of the Chinese line in AAPSO.
 As a result, the Soviets have gained an upper hand in the Secretariat
 (run by an Egyptian secretary-general, Yusuf el Sibai) but they by no
 means control it outright.   After protracted search for a Council meet-
 ing site, Nicosia was chosen where, significantly, the host AAPSO affi-
 liate and the general atmosphere favor the Soviets.   The Chinese have
 opposed the Nicosia site to no avail.   Originally, the Council meeting
 was to be held in Tanzania, but the Tanzanians postponed the September
 1966 date and later signified that they would prefer not to host the
 meeting, apparently being concerned about the prospects of a Sino-Soviet
 feud in their country.

 Major Areas of Conflict.   Sino-Soviet views can be expected to clash
 on matters of (1) representation, (2) agenda, and (3) the site of the
 Fifth AAPSO Conference.
 (1) Representation.  Delegates from AAPSO's affiliates will be eli-
 gible, representing as the case may be ruling and opposition parties,
 exile groups and a few militants representing nobody but themselves.   In
 some instances (such as Ceylon, Kenya, Japan, South Africa, possibly Ghana
 and others) the Council may have to decide which faction, the pro-Soviet
 or the pro-Chinese, to admit. (The Tri-Continent Conference (AALAPSO) in
 Havana in January 1966 had to decide which of two Indonesian delegations
 to seat.)  As at all front meetings, an array of observers will attend --
 from other pro-Soviet and/or pro-Chinese front organizations, the European
 Communist countries, and, given the Tri-Continent Solidarity concept, from
 Latin America.
 (2) Agenda.   The agenda will deal foremost with the struggle against
 imperialism, colonialism and neo-colonialism (headed by U.S. imperialism)
 and for national liberation, etc. -- the standard militant bill of fare
 of Communist fronts, and particularly of AAPSO, which has no functional
 charter whatever.    It will address itself to the problems of the imperial-
 ist policy of war and aggression (particularly in Vietnam), foreign mili-
 tary bases, aggressive military pacts, etc. and also to AAPSO's organiza-
 tion and prospective Fifth Conference
 (3) Fifth AAPSO Conference.   In the unlikely event that the recogni-
 tion of delegations or delegates or agenda matters ("substance") should
 be dealt with relatively smoothly, the question of the next Conference
 site can hardly be resolved without an unprecedented clash in AAPSO.   The
 4th AAPSO Conference held in Winneba, Ghana in 1965 decided that the Fifth
 Conference should be held in Peking in 1967 -- a decision which the Chinese
 naturally defend to the best of their ability and with all the means avail-
 able to them.   The Soviets and Indians have announced that they will not
 attend a Conference in Peking, and the Nicosia Council meeting will deal
 with a request for change of venue from several AAPSO affiliates*.   The
 Soviet supporters argue in favor or a neutral site where conditions would
 be more conducive to holding a Conference without a bitter Sino-Soviet
 struggle -- a partially valid argument but not a realistic proposal, con-
 sidering the difficulty in finding any other meeting place acceptable to
 all concerned.   Even if a site is found, it may be difficult to induce the
 host government to offer it.   (END UNCLASSIFIED)

 "Postwar recuperation of the European economic structure was hindered
 by the continued political and economic encroachment of the USSR into
 Central and Eastern Europe, at the expense of an integrated, balanced
 European economy.  Russia prevented the economic unification of Germany
 and precluded the return of Germany as a full working-partner in the
 European economy.  Two years after the surrender of Germany, such re-
 covery as had been accomplished was facilitated by assistance from the
 United States Government....
 "The proposal put forth by Secretary Marshall underlined the position
 of the United States in support of the drafting of a joint agreement
 as to goals and methods for a period of from 3 to 4 years.  The USSR
 declined to.associate with the United Kingdom and France in framing a
 reply to the Marshall proposal.  The latter two countries issued invi-
 tations to all other European countries (except Spain) to attend a

 conference in Paris.  Because the Eastern European countries under
 Russian influence decided not to take part, the conference was un-
 able to deal with the problem of Europe as a whole, as envisaged
 in the original proposal.  Nonetheless, the 16 countries* partici-
 pating organized the Committee of European Economic Cooperation and
 submitted a report to the United States in September 1947 setting
 forth their needs and their willingness to cooperate in a joint re-
 covery program. It
 In late June 1947 the Foreign Ministers of Great Britain, France,
 and the USSR (Bevin, Bidault, and Molotov) had met in Paris to discuss
 the Marshall proposal.  The Soviet delegation first charged that the
 "steering committee" suggested by Britain and France would "meddle in
 the internal affairs of sovereign nations," and even before the Big
 Three meeting broke up on 3 July PRAVDA alleged that the Marshall Plan
 was a, scheme to prolong the postwar boom in the United States and on 29'
 June TASS described the aid proposal as another instance of "American
 imperialism."
 Czechoslovakia, which had at first agreed to attend the Europe-wide
 conference in Paris to consider the recovery plan, withdrew after its
 Premier and Foreign Minister had been summoned to Moscow.  Poland, which
 had also signified its intention of participating in the Plan, later re-
 canted.   Then on 6 July PRAVDA announced the establishment of the Cominform
 in Belgrade representing Communists of nine countries** and six days later
 the Soviet Government negotiated trade, aid, and barter agreements with its
 satellite states in Eastern Europe, later to become known as the "Molotov
 Plan."  The dichotomy of European recovery efforts was completed on 22 Oc-
 tober when Andrei Zhdanov, speaking for the Cominform, called on Communists
 everywhere to defeat the Marshall Plan, which he denounced as an "instru-
 ment for world domination by American imperialism."
 The 16 nations of free Europe were not daunted by the Communist propa-
 ganda barrage, however, and on 16 April 1948 they formally established the
 Organization for European Economic Cooperation (OEEC); the zones of Germany
 occupied by the United States, United Kingdom and France, along with the
 Free Territory of Trieste, were included in the OEEC.   The same month the
 U.S. Congress passed the Economic Cooperation Act (ECA) to furnish means
 for covering such essential import needs of the participating countries for
 commodities and equipment as could not be financed by their own efforts, and

 to support those measures of self and mutual help on the part of the par-
 ticipating countries which were necessary to achieve true economic recovery.
 Actually the $12.5 billion dollar total expenditure on the Marshall
 Plan for Europe is only a portion of a much bigger and continuing effort
 on the part of the United States to contribute to the economic viability
 of Europe since World War II.  During the period from July 1945 to March
 1961 non-military U.S. Government aid in grants and credits for European
 recovery totaled twice that sum; of this,$6.7 billion went to the United
 Kingdom,$5.3 billion to France, $3.7 billion to West Germany, $3 billion
 to Italy, $966 million to the Netherlands, and $703 million to Belgium.
 Perceptive Europeans recognize this aid, not as a gift for which they
 must forever carry a burden of gratitude, but as vivid proof of America's
 own interest in a free and prosperous Europe.
 In retrospect, France provides some excellent illustrations of what
 too many other people may have forgotten about the Marshall Plan -- and
 U.S. aid in general -- over the years.   Sisley Huddleston, the English-
 born correspondent of the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, THE LONDON TIMES, and
 other British papers in Paris before and after World War II, recalls in his
 book (see attached excerpt) that the turning point in French recovery after
 the War was the application of this Plan, for "had America deserted Europe,
 had she not behaved with enlightened generosity, Europe would long ago gone
 Bolshevik."
 Today, President de Gaulle implies that the aid program of two decades
 ago was merely a passing phase of U.S. manipulation of Europe for its own
 selfish purposes.  According to the semi-official French news agency AFP,
 de Gaulle told a meeting of the Institute of Higher Studies of National De-
 fense in Paris on 20 January 1967:
 "The policy of the United States with regard to Europe has passed
 through three phases.  First there was the Yalta phase:  the United
 States, stiZZ at war with Japan, wanted to keep its hand free in the
 Pacific and it gave the USSR a free hand in Europe.  Then there was
 the second phase:  Japan was beaten and the United States perceived
 its mistake and realized that Europe could become a threat to the
 United States.  So the United States reversed its policy; this was
 the time of the Marshall Plan, NATO, and so forth.
 "Finally, there is the third phase, the one which is taking place
 under our eyes.  The United States again wants to have a free hand
 in the Pacific to settle the Vietnam problem, to continue its policy
 in the Philippines, to support Japan against Communist China, and so
 forth.  It would Zike to conclude a gentleman's agreement with the
 Soviets.  But there is a new fact:  West Europe exists, and a stable
 Europe must be centered around this Europe* in order to arrive at a
 *The AFP dispatch noted at this point that another version of de Gaulle's
 statement at the Paris meeting was "a united Europe must be made up of all
 the countries of Europe..."

 tripoZar world of Europe, the United States, and Asia.  As for
 West Europe's economic policy with regard to the satellite fringe,
 business is business.  We can imagine that the Americans, once
 free of the Vietnamese problem, will also act so that business
 will be business in their relations with these countries."
 President de Gaulle might well have remembered, in this connection,
 another statement* made as recently as 29 July 1963 when he told a press
 conference:
 "As for the Franco-American alliance which has existed since the
 time of Washington, Franklin, LaFayette, DeGrasse, and Rochambeau,
 and which was brought to full fruition during the First World War
 in 1917-1918 and during the Second one beginning in December 1941,
 it is a fact that it still exists today and that everything requires
 the two countries to maintain it.  As long as, in effect, the Soviet
 bloc arrays itself before the free world, capable of suddenly sub-
 merging this or that territory and animated by a dominating and de-
 testable ideology, it will be necessary for people on both sides of
 the Ocean who wish to defend themselves to be linked together in
 order to accomplish this."  (End UNCLASSIFIED)

 GUATEMALA:  Free Government
 Vs. Guerrillas
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  An unclassified attachment to this paper provides a
 background report on the political situation in Guatemala since the
 inauguration of President Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro on 1 July 1966.
 In brief, the main points are:   The Mendez government came to power by
 free, democratic elections, despite widespread opposition from conser-
 vative military leaders.   Shortly after his inauguration, Mendez made
 a determined effort to effect internal peace by offering amnesty to
 the Communist guerrilla forces which have plagued the country for years.
 However, the Communists refused the amnesty offer and launched a new
 campaign of terrorism.   At the same time right-wing extremists, charg-
 ing that Mendez was favoring the far left, unleashed their own campaign
 against the Communists and the government.
 The government struck back hard at both extremes, despite predic-
 tions from all sides of its imminent overthrow.  A state of siege was
 declared on 2 November, most of the leaders of the extreme right were
 arrested, and the army sent troops into the mountain hideouts of the
 Communist guerrilla forces.   The campaign against the Communists has
 been the most determined and the most effective of any undertaken in
 recent years and it has produced encouraging results:   a number of
 guerrilla leaders have been killed or captured, heretofore undisturbed
 rebel bases have been overrun, and dissension among the various Commu-
 nist groups has grown.
 To counteract the government campaign, Cuba has increased its
 efforts to support the guerrillas.   Speeches from Havana, encouraging
 the rebels, have accompanied increased efforts to smuggle arms into
 Guatemala, and the training of Guatemalans in Cuban guerrilla schools
 continues apace.   To obtain funds for the rebellion, the Communists
 have resorted to robbery and kidnaping, thus reinforcing their charac-
 terization as bandits, not liberators.
 The turmoil caused by the extremists of both right and left has not
 significantly reduced Guatemala's capacity to expand its economy and
 ameliorate the privations of most of its citizens.   One of the most
 harmful results has been the flight of capital abroad, but this is
 decreasing.   Nevertheless Mendez Montenegro has vigorously pushed the

 preparation of an economic development plan and has actively searched
 for support of this plan within the framework of the Alliance for Pro-
 gress.   It is noteworthy that Mendez has received strong support from
 neighboring nations, particularly Mexico.

 1099.                        THE DRAFT IN THc USSR
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  The basis for the Soviet draft is the Universal Compulsory
 Military Service Law of 1 September 1939, as amended in June 1962.   This law
 sets forth: a) the procedures for conscription;  b) the duration of the
 military obligation (3 years in the Army; 4 or 5 years in the Air Force and
 Navy);  c) the reserve obligation; and  d) mobilization regulations.   Cur-
 rently, youths register when they reach the age of 17 and they are normally
 called up when they are 19.   Exemptions and deferments are to be granted to
 youths for medical and educational reasons, to youths whose induction would
 work a hardship on their parents, and to married men with two or more chil-
 dren.                    In 1966, as has been observed during the past several years, 800,000
 were inducted into the Soviet Army during, September to December.  This fig-
 ure amounts to a bit less than half of the youth reaching the age of mili-
 tary service in 1966.   The balance were either deferred for the above-noted
 reasons, or were placed in a reserve category.
 Although the Soviets' draft law a  ears to be egalitarian, it is carried
 out in such a way that certain groups  or classes are favored.   For example,
 sons of CP and Government officials tend to be granted a disproportionately
 large share of the places in higher educational institutions, and thus they
 benefit from educational deferments.   They are placed in reserve during their
 university years, and upon graduation serve in the ranks for a year or less,
 after which they can qualify for reserve commissions.(Similar treatment was
 given to educated youths in pre-1914 Germany, and this discrimination was
 an object of Socialist criticism.)  Another boon to the already-privileged
 "New Class" youths results from the Soviets' practice of thoroughly examin-
 ing a youth's papers during the pre-induction period.   Only the most trust-
 worthy (in effect, those whose parents are known and approved of by Party
 officials) are given assignments to such desirable duty as the rocket forces.
 On the other hand, it is reported that inductees whose parents are unknown
 or are not members of the CP are almost all assigned to hard-sweating combat
 arms such as the infantry and the engineers.   In addition, there is a provis-
 ion in the law for early induction of some draftees who then have a better
 chance to select a preferred branch of service; this provision is reportedly
 used for the benefit of the sons of the politically favored.
 These inequities undoubtedly contribute to the negative attitudes which
 sizable numbers of Soviet youth display towards military service.   Some other
 factors influencing this attitude are:  the Khrushchev era's generally heavy

 emphasis on peace; the rigors of the 3- to 5-year tour of military
 service*; and the admittedly sagging morale** of the troops now on
 active duty.
 A campaign to correct these negative attitudes has been intensi-
 fied since its launching in March 1965 when N. G. Yegorychev, Moscow's
 CP boss, expressed his deep concern for the "military-patriotic educa-
 tion" of Soviet youth.   The Komsomol (Communist Youth League) led the
 campaign in 1965, and in April 1966 "military-patriotic education"
 gained the strong endorsement of the 23rd Congress of the CPSU.   The
 aim of the campaign was restated in May 1966 by the chief of the Main
 Political Administration of the Army and Navy, General A. A. Yepishev,
 who said:
 "....Serious changes in the nature of warfare ... call for
 new criteria in the assessment of our entire work in preparing
 youth for military service....  Personal technological preparation
 has increased in importance ...; therefore the right image of mili-
 tary service has to be created among the young."
 The major Soviet organizations involved in this "educational" pro-
 gram are the Komsomol and DOSAAF (Voluntary Society for Cooperation with
 the Army, Air Force, and Navy).  The latter organization, though "volun-
 tary," has been called upon to mobilize its members for the fulfillment
 of tasks which include patriotic military propaganda work.  DOSAAF was
 also charged, by a decree of August 1966, with a broad array of tasks for
 the military indoctrination of Soviet youth.    (See attachment).
 Some of the devices used in this campaign are trips to battlegrounds,
 mock battles between selected teams of youngsters, an expanded sports pro-
 gram aimed in part to train young people "in the defense of the Homeland,"
 and a marked increase in the supplies of military toys as evidenced by
 their abundance on store shelves in December 1966.***
 *Soviet inductees receive no leave during their three years of duty, ex-
 cept for emergencies; little compassion is shown by the aloof and tough
 officers and NCO's who are exceptionally rank - and class-conscious. ro
 **In January 1966 Soviet marshals registered deep concern over the low
 level of morale, discipline, and political indoctrination in the armed
 forces.   Criticism for failure in these areas was leveled primarily at
 officers and professional Party and Komsomol officials in the military
 establishment.
 ***In contrast, US toy manufacturers noted that the market for military
 toys during Christmas 1966 was very disappointing.

 Close observers of Soviet military affairs conclude that the intensity
 of the Soviets' campaign is a rough measure of the severity of the problems
 being encountered in conducting a draft and military training program. They
 note that the Soviets' draft system functions (albeit with glaring deficien-
 cies) and that the pre-induction attitude of Soviet youth is clearly nega-
 tive though not so strongly so that there is a manifest resistance to draft
 calls.   If the Soviet press were free to shine enough light on this situa-
 tion, then it is believed that informed persons the world over would be 25Xl ClO b
 aware that the USSR, too, has serious problems with the military draft.

 RECENT FRAUDS AND DECEPTIONS
 IN SOVIET PROPAGANDA
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  The most striking illustrations of Soviet frauds in the
 foreign sphere are the forgeries which appear to have increased sharply
 during late 1966.   In the handling of domestic news the Soviets have con-
 tinued to withhold and distort information on important developments.
 Although the foreign target audiences of'Soviet forgeries differ sub-
 stantially from the domestic target of Soviet propaganda, as do the
 techniques employed, the objectives are the same:   to gain or expand
 the influence of the Soviet state by any means.
 In support of their foreign propaganda program the Soviets and
 their cohorts have created or inspired ad unknown number of forgeries
 (probably amounting to several hundred) during the past decade.  A lull
 in the use of forgeries by Moscow & Co. during 1961-62 was followed by
 a sharp and steady increase in their counterfeits, reaching a high point
 in intensity in late 1966.   Examples of recent forgeries* are:
 a.   Mogadiscio:  A forgery making a thinly-veiled link between the
 Peace Corps and US intelligence agencies and published in AL HAKIKA was
 reportedly supplied by the local Novosti-staff;
 b.   Lusaka:   Forgeries alleged that the US was planning a coup in
 Zambia;
 c.   Beirut: A countefeit US Army document suggesting covert US
 involvement in Moroccan affairs was surfaced in Lebanon;
 d.   Caracas:  A forged letter allegedly from the US Ambassador to
 a high-ranking Department of State official implied that the Ambassador
 was involved in the planning of a coup in Uruguay.
 *Although these recent forgeries cannot at this time and may, in fact,
 never be definitively attributed to the Soviets or other Communist sources,
 they nevertheless conform to the pattern of past Soviet forgeries.

 These examples, like other forgeries which have been observed over
 the years, show that the primary Soviet aim is anti-US propaganda.   Fur-
 ther similarities will undoubtedly show up when current forgeries are
 compared with past forgeries.   For this purpose, the unclassified attach-
 ment provides descriptions of Soviet forgeries which have been studied
 in detail.
 Assessment of 4+6 Soviet forgeries perpetrated during 1957-65 (see
 references) reveals that most of them are readily detectable from abun-
 dant technical errors and also from their implausibility.   In spite of
 these flaws, the forgeries have served some of the Soviets' interests of
 the moment.   With the lapse of enough time for the forgeries to be
 analyzed and publicized, however, the Soviets' reputation has sometimes
 been adversely affected.   Soviet officials obviously believe, however,
 that the gains from these forgeries more than offset the occasional
 damage of their reputation.
 Although it is impossible to measure the Soviets' gains and losses
 from their forgeries, it is possible to shed light on the attitude which
 underlies the Soviets' extensive use of forgeries.   The Soviets have
 shown a general contempt for objectivity and for real public opinion.
 As they see it, the public's views are to be molded, not listened to;
 and besides, by the Soviets' reckoning, the public's memory is short.
 This manipulative outlook is clearly illustrated by Soviet internal
 propaganda.   A major objective of Soviet domestic propaganda is to con-
 vince Soviet citizens that the Party infallibly represents the will of
 the; masses who, thus, have no need for elections through which to express
 their preferences.   In the complementary sphere of "agitation" the Sov-
 iets' objective is to mold mass opinion and to inspire the masses to
 carry out their assigned tasks.   With information policy guided by
 these objectives, it follows that all events and statements are screened
 and almost all are reported in distorted form.
 The Soviet people are the most competent judges of the degree of
 news distortion by USSR media.   Free World visitors to the USSR have
 almost invariably reported that many Soviet citizens are contemptuous of
 the Soviet press.   Soviet citizens have over the years told Westerners
 their own joke which has it that there is no news in PRAVDA (TRUTH: the
 CPSU newspaper) and no truth in IZVESTIYA (NEWS: the Government news-
 paper).   Rephrased, the joke confirms that Soviet propaganda and "agi-
 tation" objectives are systematically pursued by withholding and modifying
 news.
 Some illustrations of Soviet withholding of news are:
 a. the severe 1963 crop failure in the USSR, which was not reported
 meaningfully in the Soviet press until well after the reading public in
 the West was aware of it.

 b.   the April 1966 earthquake in Tashkent was scantily reported at
 first as having caused minimal damage, whereas subsequent reports grad-
 ually expanded on the seriousness of thetdisaster and 2 months after the
 event the republic CP boss Rashidov stated that 1+5,000 families had been
 left homeless;
 c.   a majority of the numerous Soviet failures to make a soft land-
 ing on the moon were unreported;
 d.   the influenza epidemic of 1965, which affected several million
 Soviets and which accounted for a substantial part of the increase of
 109,000 in Soviet mortality in that year, was barely mentioned in the
 press and the severity of the epidemic was not revealed until almost 2
 years had elapsed.
 The usual Soviet practice of distorting the news is dramatically
 illustrated by two incidents concerning the Sinyavsky-Daniel affair.   A
 month before the trial, IZVESTIYA broke Soviet journalistic silence on
 the arrest (which had taken place 1+ months earlier) and detention of the
 2 writers in an article which not only violently and abusively attacked
 them but which also took quotes so far out of context that the writers'
 expressions were completely distorted.   This article was followed up by
 published "letters to the editor 'which applauded the article's point of
 view; the fabrication of such letters endorsing official policy is a
 familiar tactic, more than once exposed. The second incident was the
 reporting of the speech by Soviet author Mikhail Sholokhov at the 23rd
 Congress of the CPSU in March-April 1966.   In that speech Sholokhov, who
 to all appearances was representing Soviets writers, blasted Sinyavsky
 and Daniel and implied that nothing short of execution would have been
 a just punishment.  While Sholokhov's speech was published, subsequent
 events have shown that large numbers of prominent writers had an exactly
 opposite but unreported view of the justice meted out to Sinyavsky and
 Daniel.
 With such lack of restraint in the ianagement of domestic news, the
 Soviets controlling the press can hardly be expected to restrain them-
 selves in the presentation of material concerning the free world.   The
 Soviets' virulent press and radio treatment of President Kennedy's assas-
 sination, especially during the latter part of 1966 and early 1967, is
 a recent case in point.  Another case is`the reduction of Truman Capote's
 343-page "In Cold Blood" to a 58-page translation retitled "An Ordinary
 Murder"; the shortened Russian version gives the strong impression that
 premeditated murder is a commonplace in America.                          25X1 C10b

 mccerpt from "France -- The.Tragic Years" by' Sisley Huddleston
 The turning point in French recovery was the applica-
 tion of the Marshall Plan of financial and economic aid. Had
 America deserted Europe, had she not behaved with enlight-
 ened generosity, Europe would long ago have "gone Bol-
 shevik." The Marshall Plan was the turning point for two
 reasons: first, because it furnished a material basis for re-
 construction; second, because it forced France to make a
 choice. On the first point, it is unnecessary for me to ex-
 patiate. But on the second, I will add a few reflections.
 France, in my view, had, after the disillusionment of the
 Liberation, lost hope. The tribulations of the war and the oc-
 cupation, the violence and the injustice which accompanied.
 the victory and left few families untouched, the mismanage-
 ment which followed the establishment of a constitution
 which was infinitely worse than the constitution of 1875, and
 might easily have resulted in one-chamber government, that
 is to say, in a dictatorship of the political parties which of-
 fered themselves at the elections and practically forbade any
 opposition, the malpractices, the scandals, the exactions, the
 requisitions, the spoliations of all sorts, the division of France
 into two groups of citizens, the ultrapatriots and the near
 traitors, the restrictions, the controls, the excessive function-
 arism, the toleration, if not the encouragement, of a black
 market worse than any that flourished during the war, the
 suppression of independent opinion, the refusal to pass a
 generous amnesty bill, the shameful exploitation by the false
 Resistants of their privileged position, the lawlessness that
 declared itself in every domain of daily life, the continual
 rise of the cost of living, the steady depreciation of the cur-
 rency, the inadequate wages, the gross immorality reflected
 in the press, the pusillanimity of the politicians, the partiality
 of the radio for the Communists, the constant strikes of a
 frankly revolutionary character, all these things and more
 that" I might enumerate discouraged the better citizens of
 France, who could be heard to say (how many times have
 I heard them say it!) that France was better off under the oc-
 cupation than under the succeeding governments!
 France felt that she was alone, helpless, having lost her
 rank among the nations, fallen into decadence, no longer a
 nation, and with nothing to indicate that she could ever be
 a nation again. Communism actually offered to many an es-
 cape from the feeling of frustration. In these conditions, the

 Marshall Plan was received with joy. It had a salutary e ect.
 It stimulated the French. It was fought ruthlessly by the
 Communists, who rightly saw that it would prevent France.
 from turning completely to Bolshevism. They described the
 Plan as an attempt to make France a satellite of America,
 when they far preferred her becoming a satellite of Russia.
 The choice had to be made, however reluctantly, by the gov-
 ernments. Materially, they were compelled to choose the
 American Plan, whatever its consequences, and soon they
 had, by the sheer force of Communist opposition, to choose
 it morally as well. The breach between Communism and
 (may I call it?) Americanism grew wider every month. The
 good effects of the Plan were soon felt, and any immediate
 return to Communism was at last improbable.
 The pact with England concluded at Dunkirk, the port by
 which the English left France, paradoxically regarded as a
 symbol of mutual help and of union, though it passed with-
 out much notice, operated in the same sense. The Atlantic
 Pact, which definitely linked up France with America, carried
 the process a step farther. But I am bound for state that these
 measures seemed to come too late and were always insuffi-
 cient to create the full sentiment of the unity of the Western
 world. The menace of Bolshevism was hardly appreciated
 .for years, though it was obvious from the commencement.
 The Socialists, in particular, without whom no govern-
 ment could live, were slow to understand that an absolute
 severing of all relations with Communism was essential: they
 looked on the Communists merely as rivals for political
 power. No drastic laws against a mortal enemy have yet
 been taken, though it is apparent that there is a Fifth Col-
 umn in France bent on sabotage, declaring openly that, in
 the event of war, the Communists will refuse to fight, or
 rather will fight against their own country. If it were not
 tragic, it would be comic to watch the attempts to fashion Eu-
 ropean unity. Three or four competing bodies have been
 formed which seem chiefly designed to serve the political
 ends of European "leaders," and some of these European
 "leaders" do not in the least see that the first step to European
 unity is the unity of their own countries. France is not yet
 united; there is no full appeasement of old quarrels, no firm-
 ness in dealing with dissidents. Nevertheless, there is at last
 hope, and it is a hope which has its roots in the Atlantic
 Pact.

 February 1967
 Guatemala:  Free Government versus Guerrillas
 Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro;` was inaugurated as President of
 Guatemala on 1 July 1966.    In the presidential election held in March
 1966 Mendez had received a plurality of the votes cast for the three
 candidates.  At the same time his party, the PR (Partido Revolucionario),
 won a majority in Congress.  According to Guatemalan law, the Congress
 picks the president if no candidate receives a clear majority in the
 nationwide vote.  Thus the newly elected Congress chose Mendez for the
 office on 25 May and he was inaugurated at the beginning of July.
 Mendez' victory was a major surprise for Guatemala since the out-
 going regime of Col. Enrique Peralta Azurdia had strongly backed a mili-
 tary candidate:  Col. Juan de Dios Aguilar de Leon.  In past Guatemalan
 elections the "'official" candidate has always been victorious.  Further-
 more, military influence on Guatemalan politics is normally enough to
 guarantee the success of a military candidate against a civilian.   Since
 1839, when the country became independent, only eight civilian presidents
 could be numbered among the 26 leaders of the republic.  In 145 years of
 independence, Guatemala had been governed by military men for 80 years.
 As might have been expected, a flurry of rumors arose after the March
 elections to the effect that the military and the outgoing government
 would stage a coup d'etat rather than permit Mendez to take office.  It
 is to the credit of Col.Peralta, however, that his government insisted on
 the legality of the elections and on the right of Mendez to become president.
 Communist guerrillas in Guatemala did their part in attempting to
 provoke a preventive military coup by mounting a campaign of violence and
 terror during the spring of 1966.  Although guerrilla activities have been
 going on for many years, the pace picked up during the spring and at the
 same time moved onto the streets of the capital, where kidnapings, terrorist
 bombings, and gunfights became almost commonplace.  To counter the terrorist
 campaign the Peralta government proclaimed a state of siege.
 The first official act of the Mendez government after the inauguration
 was to lift the state of siege, restoring all constitutional guarantees.
 Shortly thereafter Mendez made an open request to the guerrillas to abandon
 their opposition and reintegrate themselves into the national life.  This
 offer included a general amnesty for those persons who had committed po-
 litical crimes since 1960 provided they turned in their arms and released
 kidnapped officials.
 Although the Communists had backed the Mendez candidacy in March 1966,
 against the regime's candidate Aguilar, it now called the election a
 "diversionist maneuver" and refused the amnesty offer.
 The Communists' stepped-up campaign during the first months of the
 new government aroused serious concern among the rightist extremists who
 had been opposed to Mendez' inauguration.  Some of them commenced a counter-
 terror campaign, organizing a group calling itself the White Hand.  This

 organization was suspected of having planted bombs in Guatemala City, and
 three of its leaders were arrested in August for possession of arms and
 subversive propaganda.
 The situation appeared to be headed toward further deterioration when
 President Mendez began a strenuous crackdown on both rightist and leftist
 extremists.  In a radio broadcast on 7 September he said that "groups of
 unpatriotic persons ... are engaged actively and criminally in undermining
 this nation's foundations to subvert its legality, obstruct the govern-
 ment's first steps, and overthrow this government of law and moral re-
 construction."  He declared that the armed forces had been put on the
 alert and were prepared to do what was necessary to "obtain the country's
 general pacification."  The crackdown was speeded up when a state of siege
 was declared on 2 November 1966 (it has since been extended at least until
 2 March 1967).
 The government's campaign against the Communist guerrillas has been
 marked by military probes inuo the mountainous areas in Northeastern
 Guatemala which had previously been the home grounds of the guerrilla bands.
 The campaign has been the most determined and most effective of any under-
 taken by the Guatemalan army in recent years, and it has produced encourag-
 ing results:  several bands have been encircled in the mountains, hereto-
 fore undisturbed rebel bases have been overrun, and in the cities and towns
 the army and police forces have captured several bands of terrorists.  The
 young leader of the Fuerzas Armadas Rebeldes (FAR), Luis Augusto Turcios
 Lima, was killed in an automobile accident early in October; there was im-
 mediate speculation that he had been assassinated by a rival Communist
 group, but this could not be proved.  Turcios Lima's sister, Melida Turcios
 Lima, was captured on 25 October 1966, his successor, Cesar Montes ap-
 parently narrowly escaped capture in November, and Cesar Montes' second
 in command, "Chino" Arnoldo,was killed in a clash on 24+ November 1966 in
 Las Delicias.
 An encouraging factor in the government's campaign has been the sup-
 port accorded by the nation's peasants.  On 26 November 1966 the London
 Times reported that more than a thousand peasants had staged a march
 through Zacapa department,scene of a major part of the guerrilla fighting,
 protesting against the constant terrorism and calling for arms to fight
 the guerrillas.  On 2 December 1966 the Yugoslav news agency Tan jug also
 reported that demonstrations in support of the government led by students
 and peasants had taken place on that date.
 At the same time, dissensions and divisions among the various Coirmu-
 nist groups have festered.  The chief guerrilla group, the FAR, had pre-
 viously been led by Marco Antonio Yon Sosa who heads the 13th of November
 (MR-13) Movement and who had been a favorite of Fidel Castro and had re-
 ceived enthusiastic support from Cuba until his guerrilla movement splintered
 in 1963 with the departure of Turcios Lima.  Then it became apparent that it
 would be more profitable for Castro to support Turcios Lima, who was willing
 to subordinate his group to the direction of the Communist Party.  In his

 .peec:h at the closing sess.'.orf of the Tricontinental Conference, Castro
 denounced Yon Sosa for his ties with the Trotskyites.  Yon Sosa has since
 then allegedly divorced himself from the Trotskyites:  in a statement
 published in the 15 June 1966 issue. of the Salvadorean Communist publica-
 tion Verdad, Yon Sosa said that he hs,d broken with the Fourth International
 because some of its members in his organization had misappropriated party
 funds for their own sectarian interests!
 To counteract the Guatemalan government's campaign, Cuba has increased
 its efforts to support the guerrillas, both materially and polemically.
 Late in September 1966 the Mexican press revealed that an organized band
 of arms smugglers, composed of Mexicans and Guatemalans in exile, had been
 caught red-handed attempting to smuggle arms purchased in Mexico to the
 rebels in Guatemala.  Subsequent press articles added the significant in-
 formation that the Eminence  rgise of the operation was Julian Lopez Diaz,
 Third Secretary for Press and Cultural Relations in the Cuban Embassy in
 Mexico City.  The Guatemalan leader of the smugglers was Victor Hugo
 Martinez Pantaleon, militant member of the Guatemalan Communist Party. This
 band was arrested only five weeks after the committal for trial of a group
 of Mexicans charged with subversion -- including the running of a guerrilla
 training school -- led by the exiled Spanish Communist Victor Rico Galan,
 known previously to have been a backer of Yon Sosa's guerrillas.
 In Havana, the Castro regime ceaselessly exhorts the Guatemalan Com-
 munists to continue and strengthen their campaign of violence and terror.
 On 26 July Castro singled out the FAR as a guerrilla movement which has
 had "considerable success."  On 13 June the Cubans issued a joint communique
 with the FAR and the Guatemalan Communist Party; this quoted Castro's remark
 that all Latin American peoples should fight simultaneously against "im-
 perialism" and applauded the Guatemalan Communists' decision to take up
 arms.  On i1 July Flavio Bravo, Central Committee member of the Cuban Com-
 munist Party, gave a speech endorsing the guerrillas' rejection of Mendez
 and praised their violence.  He reaffirmed the Cuban line that armed struggle
 was the only choice in "all or almost all" of Latin America.  The Afro-Asian-
 Latin American Peoples' Solidarity Organization (AALAPSO) declared 6 February
 1967 as a day of solidarity with the people of Guatemala.  In its document
 proclaiming this event the organization stated:
 "The struggle of the Guatemalan people to rid themselves of
 domestic and foreign exploiters ... has been successful during the
 past few years....  After a brief period of demagogic promises that
 lasted no more than three months, the government of Mendez Montenegro
 ... unleased a ferocious repressive campaign against revolutionary,
 democratic, and popular forces, especially the peasant masses that
 constitute 73 percent of the population ... it has tried to halt the
 patriotic, revolutionary, and anti-imperialist movement of the
 Guatemalan people who are directed and led by the Rebel Armed Forces
 (FAR) commanded by maximum leader Cesar Montes....

 "On the occasioi of the celebration of the worldwide day of
 sc.-idarity with the people of Guatemala on 6 February, the AALAPSO
 Secretariat calls on all member organizations and national committees
 to wage an intensive campaign ... to support firmly the unyielding
 posture of the revolutionary fighters and of FAR and its leaders."
 On 7 February, speaking on behalf of the FAR as its representative
 in Cuba, Francisco Marroquin stated:  "Our revolution does not involve
 the polls.  Our decision is to fight with our weapons in our hands, with
 the firm intention of winning or dying for Guatemala."
 To help implement this "solidarity" the AALAPSO has formally announced
 the establishment of schools for training guerrilla cadres from other coun-
 tries.  One of the training schools is already in operation in Havana,
 training Guatemalans, among other nationalities.
 To finance their own efforts, the Guatemalan terrorists have increas-
 ingly resorted to kidnaping and robbery, thus reinforcing the conviction
 of most Guatemalans that the rebels are actually more common bandits than
 "liberators."
 The turmoil caused by the extremists of both right and left has not
 seriously reduced Guatemala's capacity to expand its economy and thus
 ameliorate the privations of most of its citizens.  Mendez Montenegro has
 vigorously pushed the preparation of an economic development plan and has
 actively searched for support for this plan within the framework of the
 Alliance for Progress.  At the same time, Guatemala has received strong
 encouragement and support from its neighboring countries, particularly
 Mexico, and there is every reason to believe that its economy will con-
 tinue to expand at an encouraging rate, despite the Communists' efforts
 to disrupt it.

 MILITARY YOUTH INDOCTRINATION STRESSED
 [Following is the translation of an un-
 signed item in the Russian-language news-
 paper Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), 26 Au-
 gust 1966, page 1.1
 A few days ago the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the VLKSM
 (Vsesoyuznyy Leninskiy Kommunisticheskiy Soyuz Molodezhi -- All Union
 Lenin's Young Communist League) approved the exemplary statute pertaining
 to patriotic military schools for youth in military schools, military units,
 DOSAAF* educational organizations, schools and elements of the civil avia-
 tion, river, maritime and air force detachments.
 The statute indicates that patriotic military schools are organized
 for the following purpose:
 To educate students who are boundlessly dedicated to communism, to
 their Soviet Homeland, to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and to
 the Soviet Government in a spirit of proletarian internationalism and
 friendship among all the peoples of the USSR;
 To carry out occupational orientation of the adolescents;
 To inculcate the students with high consciousness of their social and
 military duty.   To instill them with discipline, love for military service
 and for the occupation of a Soviet officer, to give them a sense of Soviet
 kilitary pride, an aspiration for heroic deeds for the glory of the Soviet
 Homeland, and also to train the young people for entrance into military
 schools;
 To inculcate the students with the necessary moral will power charac-
 teristics to make them physically fit.   To give them some concrete military
 experience, and to prepare them for the fulfillment of the sports norms
 qualifying them for the rating of "Ready for the Defense of the Homeland."
 The schools consist of members of the senior classes of general educa-
 tional shcools, trade schools, or from schools of the working and rural youth
 who enroll in the schools voluntarily. There is no tuition for attending the
 schools.   The instructors at the schools are reserve and retired officers,
 military personnel from army units and ships, as well as cadets from military
 schools, instructors and teachers of DOSAAF educational organizations.   The

 personnel from schools and elements of civil aviation, personnel of naval
 stations, airports and air force detachments also serve as instructors.
 Each patriotic military school has its own banner, oath (a solemn
 pledge), and a uniform.
 A council consisting of the school director, a representative of the
 komsomol rayon committee, city committee (oblast committee), group leaders
 (instructors), secretary of the school komsomol organization, platoon com-
 manders and representative of the parent committee is organized for the
 purpose of managing the school.
 The school term begins in September and ends in April-May.   The whole
 course covers one to three years.  Training is conducted no more than twice
 a week for two academic hours per session, after school hours.   The educa-
 tional work must ensure the all around mental and physical development of
 the students, their inculcation with practical experience in accordance
 with the specialty of the school.
 In the summer time military-sports camps are organized for the stu-
 dents with funds contributed by trade union organizations, by public educa-
 tion and health agencies, and by enterprises with the aid of military
 schools and civil aviation elements, personnel of naval stations,
 airports and air force detachments, as well as with the assistance of the
 local VLKSM committees.
 A challenge Red Banner of the VLKSM Central Committee was created as
 an award for the best patriotic military establishments.   It is awarded
 annually on the eve of the Victory Holiday.

 Morale in the Red Army
 Soviet marshals in'late 1965 registered deep concern over the low
 level of morale, discipline, and political indoctrination in the armed
 forces of the USSR.   Criticisms for failures in these areas were leveled
 primarily at officers and at professional Party and Komsomol officials
 in the military establishment.   Serious shortcomings of military personnel
 stationed in the Belorussian Republic, such as drunkenness and amoral be-
 havior, appear to have precipitated the campaign.  Defense Minister Malinovsky
 and the armed forces' political spokesman, Gen.Yepishev, placed the blame
 squarely on the shoulders of the officer corps.  The head of the Strategic
 Rocket Forces, Marshal Krylov, concentrated his concern on the broader prob-
 lem of the poor motivation of youth, a problem which also concerned conserva-
 tive Party spokesmen.*
 These statements by Soviet marshals drew expressions of surprise by
 Western observers.   Some commented that the Soviets were merely treating a
 normal disciplinary problem in an open manner rather than, as usual, suppress-
 ing such unfavorable information.   Other Western observers point out, however,
 that the marshals may well have been mustering support for a policy of in-
 creasing the patriotic-military education of youth prior to induction.   Bear-
 ing out the latter conclusion is the strong emphasis placed on the military
 indoctrination of youth.  According to Krasnaya Zvezda  (the Red Army news-
 paper) of January 19, 1967, more than 8,000 war games were held for youth in
 1966. These games included storming of defenses and river-crossing exercises.
 Visits to military establishments were also emphasized.   Evidently viewing
 results in 1966 with satisfaction, Krasnaya Zverda recommended that Pioneers
 and schoolboys be included in future programs.

 ABRAHAM BRUMBERG LETTER TO DAVID M. BURNS,
 U.S. CULTURAL ATTACHE, BAMAKO
 Forged Document Identification Data
 Abraham Brumberg, Executive Director,
 Problems of Communism, Press and
 Publications Service, USIA
 TO:                    David M. Burns, U.S. Cultural Attache,
 Bamako, Mali
 Ostensible date:       27 October 1961
 Synopsis
 The writer of the letter is shown to refer to the closing of the USIS
 Cultural Center in Bamako, Mali; to note that USIA intends to publish a
 special article on this "outrageous act"; and to solicit the addressee's
 help in preparing material for the article and in interpreting the closing
 of the Cultural Center as part of the Cold War.   The forgery implies that
 persons connected with the USIS Cultural Center had been engaged in illegal
 activities, but states that the article about the closing of the Center
 should aim to show that the "events in Bamako" had been instigated by "out-
 side and anti-Nationalist forces."  The letter is designed to cause distrust
 among African peoples toward U.S. nationals and also to intensify racial op-
 position to the United States by its inclusion of such statements as "in my
 opinion the African Negroes are not more capable than our own."
 The forgers mailed photostat copies of the letter to several African
 embassies in Cairo and to the Sunday Express of Lagos, Nigeria, in February
 1962.   The letter was not published, but at least one African diplomat in
 Carlo was informed by a Malian official that the document was believed to
 be authentic.  Attached to a copy of the forgery sent to one embassy was a
 forged handwritten note which read:   "Dear Sir, You will find here something
 very interesting.  Use it as you wish.   NA."  The forged initials were those
 of an officer of the U.S. Embassy, Cairo, who was in the habit of initialing
 outgoing U.S. Embassy transmittals.   The official investigation of this inci-
 dent revealed that no correspondence had ever been exchanged between Mr.
 Brumberg and Mr. Burns.   The letter did not follow standard U.S. government
 format for informal letters exchanged between U.S. officials.
 Because the purpose of this forgery is identical with several others--
 to cause ill-will toward the United States among African peoples by "prov-
 ing" U.S. intervention in local affairs--it would seem to be the work of the

 same fabricators.  Derogatory references to non-white peoples, the mail-
 ing pattern, and other similarities (such as the comparison of Africans
 to wild animals) can be noted both in this forgery case and in an earlier
 anti-United States propaganda exercise--a false document which ostensibly
 originated with the Ku Klux Klan in late 1960 which was discussed in the
 U.S. Senate document of June 1961.  The Ku Klux Klan letter was mailed to
 several African and Asian diplomats in the United States; it warned African
 and Asian delegates to the United Nations to stay away from hotels and res-
 taurants of New York City and closed with the statement:  "There is no wel-
 come in America for a Black and Yellow United Nations."
 Forged Document Identification Data

 Director, USIA
 To:                    All Principal USIS Posts
 Ostensible date:       25 April 1963
 Synopsis
 Apparently designed to strengthen the position of anti-U.S. parti-
 cipants in the Congress of the International Union of Socialist Youth
 (IUSY) at Oslo, Norway, in August 1963, this forged USIA circular re-
 quested USIS representatives abroad to make sure that "our sympathizers"
 among the youth leaders influence the Congress proceedings "in our favor"
 and give "financial aid to those friendly to us."  U.S. delegates to the
 Congress described some of the circular terminology as "utterly un-
 American."  Available evidence strongly suggests Soviet involvement in
 this propaganda attempt.

 Synopsis
 Groundwork for the launching in July 1964 of the forged Brady
 letters was laid with the circulation of an earlier forgery, the
 "'suppressed" USIA press release into which had been threaded false
 claims of a "Mann Plan" for the overthrow of the Brazilian and Chilean
 governments, among others, during 1964.  As a prelude to the surfacing
 of the Brady letters, U.S. and other diplomatic installations in Rio
 de Janeiro,  Santiago, and Montevideo received circulars from a "Com-
 mittee for Struggle Against Yankee Imperialism" which warned of "hundreds
 of American ,CIA, Pentagon, and FBI agents" masquerading in Latin America
 as diplomats.   The first sheet named "some of the American agents who
 took a direct part in the recent coup d'etat in Brazil" and the second
 sheet gave "the names of some of the American agents among those who are
 involved in the preparation of a coup d'etat in Chile."  The name of
 Thomas Brady was listed as one of the "American agents" who had allegedly
 been involved in the Brazilian coup in April 1964.
 Investigation has failed to produce the slightest evidence that a
 committee with this name exists anywhere in Latin America, and it must
 be assumed to be a phantom organization created for the express purpose
 of the mailing to support the forgery..  The letterhead showed not only
 the name-of the committee.but also the slogan "Latin America for the Latin
 Americans" in.large print, in both Spanish and Portuguese.   Both languages
 were used in the text of the circular, one above the other and side by
 side.   On one of the two sheets of letterhead the Spanish for "imperialism"
 was incorrectly spelled with the initial letter "e", which might suggest
 that the letterhead was done by someone usually careless, unfamiliar with
 the language, or both.  At the same time, examination showed the printing
 method to be letterpress for the letterhead and offset printing for the
 text, processes hardly in keeping with the capabilities of a "committee"
 that defied identification.   The envelopes carried Uruguayan postage stamps
 and postmarks, the latter generally illegible, but sample envelopes were
 found to be of probably Brazilian and Argentine manufacture.
 Another mailing from the same committee, addressed to Uruguayans and
 Latin Americans, came to attention at the end of December 1964.   It de-
 nounced alleged U.S. pressure on the military of Uruguay to take over the
 government and, following the pattern set by the first circular, went on
 to list five U.S. officials involved in the planned coup, four of whom the
 "committee" claimed were CIA agents.
 The two Brady letters, surfaced in Argentina on 23 July 1964. and re-
 played elsewhere in Latin America in fairly rapid succession, were designed
 to lend credence to overt propaganda charges of U.S. involvement in the
 overthrow of the Brazilian government of Joao Goulart.  At the same time
 they were intended, with the help of the phantom committee mailing, to sup-
 port overt propaganda charges that the U.S. was then meddling in pre-election
 activities in Chile..  The first letter, an innocuous one ostensibly dated
 2 January 1961, was published to give authenticity to the second one, dated

 15 April 1961+.   In the second letter the forgers had the Director of
 the FBI writing to Brady to convey "personal appreciation to each agent
 stationed in Brazil for the services rendered in the accomplishment of
 'Overhaul'" and referring also to the part played by "the CIA people"
 in "this large scale operation."  Not content with providing "proof" of
 U.S. coup involvement, the forgers added a slighting reference to living
 conditions in Brazil.  Technical scrutiny revealed that the completely
 fabricated second letter was prepared on a typewriter of European manu-
 facture and the signature showed signs of forgery.  There is also proof
 that the first letter was spurious.   In a television speech on 5 August
 1960 Raul CASTRO indicated that the Cubans held a letter identical with
 the first Brady letter, but it was one which had been sent to another
 man to congratulate him on his years of service.  The forgers simply re-
 typed the letter, changing the name of the individual and date of the
 letter.
 PEACE CORPS CIRCULAR MAILED IN IRAN
 Forged Document Identification Data
 From:                  Mr. Cleo Shook
 Director of U.S. Peace Corps Workers in Iran
 To:                    The Peace Corps
 Ostensible date:       No date shown on document.
 Synopsis
 The forgery is an ostensible background briefing memorandum addressed
 by Mr. Shook to Peace Corps members assigned to Iran in which Mr. Shook is
 shown to describe the Iranian people, their customs, and their religion in
 highly derogatory terms.  In some respects, this forgery resembles a USIA
 brief forged and circulated earlier in Brazil.   It shows Mr. Shook as re-
 ferring consistently to Iranians as "the natives" and as portraying them
 generally as backward, indolent, ignorant people who are religious fanatics
 but morally degenerate.   It is especially designed to antagonize the Moslem
 clergy against Americans by the inclusion of phrases describing Islam as
 "reactionary" and Moslem religious customs as "savage" and "wildly fanatic"
 and by advice to the Peace Corps volunteers to prevent the young Iranians
 "from going to the Mullahs to learn Islam, which bars the country from
 modern life."  Several hundred reduced-size photographed copies of the
 forged memorandum were mailed in Tehran, Iran, to addressees in Iran, some
 of whom were newspaper editors.  The Iranian stamps and postmarks appear
 to be genuine.
 The following factors give indication of probable Communist Bloc manu-
 facture:

 ,Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400070008-4
 1.   Since early 1964, the Communist movement has sought to con-
 vince the Moslem world that its "scientific socialism" is con-
 sistent with the ethics and social doctrines of certain Moslem
 teachers.  The Soviets, for their part, engaged in a strenuous
 campaign to win the good will of Moslem religious leaders in the
 Near East and to seek to influence them to become anti-American.
 The forgery fits into this Soviet propaganda campaign.
 2.  Other themes implicit in the forgery are similar to those of
 other forgeries known, or strongly suspected, to have been pro-
 duced by a Communist Bloc intelligence service.   It is designed to
 spread ill will toward Americans by showing that Americans in Iran
 have little genuine respect for the people of Iran and that Americans
 consider Iranians as backward and degenerate.  Moreover, the letter
 is designed to show that the very opinions of Americans about the
 qualities of the people criticized in the letter are in fact descrip-
 tive of Americans themselves.  Also, the forgery was clearly planned
 to indicate that Americans have a ridiculous sense of superiority
 which causes them to intervene in foreign countries in order to re-
 fashion them after a corrupt American model.
 3.   Immorality of Peace Corps members and of local citizens was a
 subject discussed in another forged Peace Corps letter.   That letter
 appeared in Somalia and was ostensibly written by Peace Corps Director
 Sargent Shriver to Harris L. Wofford, Peace Corps representative in
 Addis Ababa.   Identical words and similar emphasis were used in dis-
 cussing the subject in both forgeries -- a fact which suggests a com-
 mon inspiration if not a central point of origin.   The subject of
 U.S. immorality -- especially of Americans serving overseas -- is
 frequently treated in similar terminology in Communist Bloc press and
 radio propaganda stories.
 4.   Other forged U.S. documents known to be, or strongly suspected
 of being, of Communist Bloc intelligence service manufacture, have
 also appeared in the form of reduced-size photographed copies, rather
 than original documents -- a condition which renders technical analysis
 of the forgeries more difficult, as Communist Bloc intelligence services
 are well aware.  Also, other Communist Bloc-produced forgeries of U.S.
 documents most frequently have been mailed in locally-procured envelopes
 with genuine postage.
 5.   Some expressions used'in the forgery are cliches commonly found in
 Communist Bloc English language publications.  Examples of these are
 "historic winds" and "torch bearers of progressive ideas."
 6.   The forgery contains certain typographical errors which consistently
 appear in Soviet-produced documents written in the English language.
