Political, sociological, and economic data, including monetary 
conversion rates, generally reflect information through mid-October 
1975, except for population estimates, which have been projected to 1 
January 1976. Military manpower estimates are as of 1 January 1975 
except for average number of males reaching military age, which are 
projected averages for the 5-year period 1975-79. Military and com-
munications data are as of 30 October 1975 unless otherwise in-
dicated. 
Most of the land utilization estimates are rough approximations, 
and most of the statistical data are rounded (thousands and millions). 
Figures for "arable" may reflect only the area actually under crops 
rather than the potential cultivable. Fishing limits are included only 
when they differ from the territorial limits. 
For some countries GDP, rather than GNP, is shown. The 
difference between the two is in the addition or subtraction of the 
value of return on foreign investment. GDP equals GNP plus income 
earned in the country but sent abroad, minus income earned abroad 
but sent into the country. GDP thus tends to exceed GNP in debtor 
countries, and the reverse is true in creditor countries. 
Major ports are the largest maritime ports of the country, relative 
to other ports of the same country, on the basis of estimated port 
capacity, alongside berthing accommodations, and commercial or 
naval importance. Minor ports are the remaining ports of a country 
which have, relative to the major ports, significantly lower estimated 
port capacity, fewer alongside berthing accommodations, are of less 
commercial or naval importance. Major transport aircraft are those 
weighing over 20,000 pounds. Military budgets are in U.S. dollar 
equivalents. The dollar sign refers to U.S. dollars unless otherwise 
stated. The abbreviation FY stands for U.S. fiscal year; all years are 
calendar years unless otherwise indicated.

GOVERNMENT 
With the end of the war, South Vietnam in effect 
has become reunified with the North. For the 
foreseeable future, however, a separate, ostensibly 
independent administration will be maintained in 
the South. Policy decisions however are made in 
Hanoi by the Vietnam Workers Party?the 
Communist Party?and transmitted to its southern 
branch?the People's Revolutionary Party. Quasi-
military/political people's revolutionary commit-
tees are overseeing basic administrative tasks in the 
countryside while the Provisional Revolutionary 
22 
January 1976 
Government represents southern interests abroad 
and apparently will be the entity to which foreign 
governments are accredited. When Hanoi becomes 
satisfied that the southern administration has 
satisfactorily adjusted economically and politically 
to a more rigid socialist society, formal reunifica-
tion probably will occur. Currently, there is no way 
to estimate the duration of this periods.
