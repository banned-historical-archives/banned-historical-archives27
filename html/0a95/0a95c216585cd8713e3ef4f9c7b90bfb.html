 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 SUPREME SOVIET HEARS KHRUSHCHEV'S.REPORT .          .  . .  . .  .  .     Page 1
 The USSR Supreme Soviet on 7 May heard Khrushchev's
 report on the planned reorganization of Soviet industrial
 administration.  Khrushchev's recommendations generally
 followed his "theses" published last March.            He called for
 abolition of fewer of the central industrial ministries
 than he had previously proposed, however, and recommended
 pushing the reorganization through to completion in two
 months.   In personnel shifts associated with the reorgani-
 zation, Mikhail Pervukhin has been appointed head of the
 Ministry of Medium Machine Building--responsible for nu-
 clear production--and Iosef Kuzmin, a relatively unknown
 central party apparatus worker, chief of the new State
 Planning Commission, the main instrument of central con-
 trol of the economy.

 Aqaba:   A test passage of an Israeli-flag vessel
 through the Gulf of Aqaba to Eilat will probably take
 place at the end of May or early in June.  The reinforce-
 ment of French naval units in Somaliland may indicate
 that France intends to assist Israel if Egypt or Saudi
 Arabia attempts to prevent passage.
 Israel:   UN Secretary General Hammarskjold went to
 Israel fortalks despite Prime Minister Ben-Gurion's re-
 fusal in advance to discuss the topics 11ammarskjold wanted
 to take up.
 Suez:  Britain is evidently prepared to accept Egypt's
 conditions for operation of the Suez Canal.  France still
 opposes any settlement implying acceptance of Egypt's
 terms, but there are indications that a compromise is under
 consideration.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY

 THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CRISIS   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  Page  8
 The most likely successor to the Segni cabinet, which
 resigned on 6 May after Vice Premier Saragat had with-
 drawn his Democratic Socialist Party, is an exclusively
 Christian Democratic government.  This would probably be
 in effect a caretaker government pending elections which
 are now scheduled for next spring but may be held this
 THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN DISPUTE  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  Page  9
 Public opinion remains inflamed in both Honduras
 and Nicaragua, despite the temporary cease-fire agreement
 negotiated by a special OAS committee on 5 May.          Charges
 and countercharges of violations of the agreement are
 aggravating the situation and hampering the committee's
 efforts to work out a plan for troo  withdrawals accept-
 able to both sides.
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 EGYPT'S FINANCIAL SITUATION REMAINS PRECARIOUS .  .  . .  .  .  Page  1
 Egypt's failure since last August to market a large
 part of its cotton and a decrease in foreign trade gen-
 erally have caused a further deterioration in the country's
 precarious financial situation.   There is growing infla-
 tion, a shortage of some goods--particularly imported
 items--and a lack of foreign exchange.  Trade with the
 Soviet bloc reached 56 percent of Egypt's total exports
 and 35 percent of its imports in January and February,
 and Egypt is becoming increasingly dependent on the bloc.
 DISTURBANCES IN POLAND .  .  .  .  .    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page   2
 Strikes and demonstrations have recently occurred in
 scattered areas of Poland; a major riot at Jaroslaw involved
 troops  and  townspeople.  ,    Black-marketeering and other
 illegal financial activities have become widespread since
 October.  The regime'may be compelled by these circum-
 stances to reconsider some of its liberal policies, as it
 cannot afford serious deterioration of its control without

 NUCLEAR CONTROVERSY STIRS BONN GOVERNMENT   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  4
 The rapid development of the nuclear arms question
 as a major issue in the impending West German national
 election has produced a split in the Adenauer cabinet.
 Defense Minister Strauss reportedly is insisting that
 immediate steps be taken to acquire nuclear weapons,
 while the government generally has chosen to back down
 on its public demands for weapons parity within NATO,
 placing emphasis on the need for nuclear disarmament.
 Moscow has been adding fuel to the fire by diplomatic
 notes and propaganda warnings of grave consequences if
 West Germany acquires nuclear arms.                                            25X1
 BRITAIN AND THE "FOURTH COUNTRY" NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROBLEM     Page   5
 In order to preserve its position as the only pro-
 ducer of nuclear weapons in Western Europe, Britain is
 looking for ways to prevent additional countries, espe-
 cially West Germany, from making such armaments.   Skep-
 tical that any disarmament agreement would achieve this,
 Britain may support a nuclear weapons pool under NATO,
 and British officials have urged that the United States
 consider supplying nuclear warheads to "other countries"
 on condition that the recipients forswear programs of
 25X1      their own.  F_                        I
 CYPRUS .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page   6
 The Greek government now seems confident that Arch-
 bishop Makarios will co-operate in a policy aimed at
 independence for Cyprus under some form of trusteeship--
 probably NATO.  Turkey might ultimately accept such a
 settlement, but only if treaty guarantees against union
 with Greece--enosis--were included.  Meanwhile, Britain
 is proceeding with a reassessment of the island's stra-
 tegic importance in the light of London's plans for mil-
 25X1           itary retrenchment.
 COLOMBIAN POLITICAL CRISIS .  .  .  .  . .  .  ,  .  ..  .            Page
 Colombian president Rojas' authoritarian policies, and
 particularly his 8 May "re-election" for the 1958-1962
 term, have provoked opposition in various parts of Colom-
 bia and may result in his being replaced shortly by a
 military junta.   Serious discontent is increasingly evi-
 dent among students, church officials, and some business
 groups, and is reportedly spreading to the military, the
 principal prop of Rojas' "Government of the Armed Forces."

 "GUIDED DEMOCRACY" IN INDONESIA                .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  8
 President Sukarno has imposed his concept of "guided
 democracy" on Indonesia by an emergency decree establish-
 ing his much-heralded national advisory council.                                 Commu-
 nists and pro-Sukarno left-wingers and extreme nationalists
 probably will predominate in its membership.   In the prov-
 inces, sentiment against Sukarno and the central govern-
 ment will probably intensify.  The arrest in Djakarta of
 the South Sumatran "commissioner" and JLO members of the
 South Sumatran governing council will further stimulate a
 desire for a final break with Djakarta.
 OVERSEAS CHINESE RIOT IN SOUTH VIETNAM .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page
 The rising resentment among Overseas Chinese in South
 Vietnam against Taipei's inability to protect them from
 the mandatory naturalization decreed by the Vietnamese
 government recently led to rioting at the Chinese Nation-
 alist legation in Saigon.  With its prestige at stake,
 the Chinese Nationalist government is attempting desper-
 ately to intercede with Saigon, but without success to
 date.
 POSSIBLE POLITICAL CRISIS IN LAOS   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  9
 Laotian prime minister Souvanna Phouma's handling
 of the Pathet Lao negotiations reportedly has aroused
 widespread dissatisfaction in the National Assembly.
 Official circles in Vientiane believe Souvanna'  may re-
 sign or be overthrown after the assembly opens on 11
 May.  Formation of a new cabinet would probably require
 prolonged negotiations, which would impair the effective-
 ness of government operations and would. facilitate sub-
 versive maneuvering by the Pathet Lao.
 DUAL CITIZENSHIP PROBLEM IN MALAYA INDEPENDENCE TALKS   .  .  Page 10
 Chief Minister Abdul Rahman's main difficulty in
 negotiating final details for Malaya's constitution in
 London, beginning on 13 May, will center on the critical
 question of dual citizenship.  This proviso is being de-
 manded by Britain for the many non-Malay residents--most-
 ly Chinese--who are British citizens of other colonies or
 of Commonwealth countries.  This issue is tied to the
 larger  problem of racial ants onisms in the federation.

 JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER'S SOUTHEAST ASIAN TRIP .  .  .  .    .  Page 11
 Prime Minister Kishi--the first Japanese government
 head to visit Southeast and South Asia since World War
 II--will probably be received cordially since no sensi-
 tive issues remain between Japan and the nations he will
 visit. He probably feels that first-hand knowledge of
 the area will be useful in negotiating with the United
 States on Southeast Asian economic development when he
 visits Washington in June.
 INCREASING THAI CONTACTS WITH COMMUNIST CHINA  .  .  .  .  . .  Page 12
 The recent acceleration of "unofficial" Thai con-
 tacts with Communist China has been tacitly encouraged,
 if not actively promoted, by the Bangkok government.
 Although Thai leaders still insist that formal recog-
 nition must await Peiping's admission to the UN, these
 contacts indicate a desire for some "normalization" of
 relations with Communist China.  Peiping is already
 seeking to exploit this opening in the hope of expand-
 ing its influence.
 CHINESE: COMMUNISTS REAFFIRM LIBERALIZATION POLICY  .  .  .  .  Page 13
 The Chinese Communists have given new impetus to
 the liberalization campaign initiated a. year ago, em-
 phasizing persuasion rather than coercion in carrying
 out Peiping's programs, and this policy is being fol-
 lowed in trying to resolve present "contradictions" be-
 tween the people and the leadership.  Peiping declares
 that its policy to "let all flowers bloom and all schools
 of thought contend" is proving successful and will not be
 reversed.
 SOUTH KOREA PREPARES FOR NEW POLITICAL REPRESSION  .  .  .  .  Page 14
 The plan of the South Korean government to revital-
 ize "neighborhood associations" foreshadows increasing
 reliance on coercion and intimidation to assure the con-
 tinued supremacy of the Liberal Party in preparation for
 1958 assembly elections.  Despite official assurances to
 the contrary, the strengthened associations probably will
 work with the police to harass opposition sympathizers.

 Premier Bulganin told a group of American women visit-
 ors on 5 May that the Soviet "economy could overtake" that
 of the United States "within 40 years."              Heretofore, the
 usual formulation has been the vague "shortest possible his-
 torical time period."

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 SOCIALIZATION IN COMMUNIST CHINA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .       .  .  .  .  .  Page 1
 The Chinese Communists, having moved slowly for sev-
 eral years toward complete socializtion of the economy,
 ordered a forced march toward this goal. in mid-1955. By
 the end of 1956, over 96 percent of they nation's peasants
 were enrolled in co-operatives, and industrial and com-
 mercial business was transacted largely through socialist
 organizations.  While the economic results have not been
 entirely satisfactory to Peiping, the Chinese Communists
 are boasting that their method of "peacefully" trans- .
 forming capitalists into wage earners is    uniaue contri-
 bution to Marxist theory and practice.                                        25X1
 WEST GERMAN ACTIVITIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTH ASIA .  Page 4
 The past few months have seen an acceleration in the
 continuing effort by West German government leaders and
 businessmen to expand the Federal Republic's commercial
 and diplomatic influence in the Middle East and South
 Asia.  Total trade between West Germany and the area
 amounted to $1.30 billion in 1956,representing 9 percent
 of Germany's world trade.  The level of prewar German
 trade with these countries has been surpassed, and siz-
 able long-term financial investments and technical aid
 programs have been launched.
 MEETINGS OF HIGH-LEVEL SINO-SOVIET BLOC.LEADERS.  .  .  .  .  .
 A program of visits among top-level Sino-Soviet bloc
 leaders, begun after the crises in Hungary and Poland last
 fall, is apparently scheduled to continue on an intensive
 basis during the coming months.  Moscow initiated the ex-
 change of visits probably with the aim of reinforcing So-
 viet ideological and political influence over the Satel-
 lites.  Chinese Communist participation in the program,
 however, has given much encouragement -to the Gomulka re-k
 gime in Poland, thG least ort~odox and most independent
 of the European Satellites.

 not succeeded in bringing an end to in;gurgent activities
 which have been in progress since 1952.  The Indian gov-

 SUPREME SOVIET HEARS KHRUSHCHEV'S REPORT
 The USSR Supreme Soviet on
 7 May heard Khrushchev's report
 on the planned reorganization
 of the administration of Soviet
 industrial :and. construction
 activity.,  Khrushchev's recom-
 mendations generally followed
 his theses,. published last March,
 but he called for abolition of
 fewer of the central industrial
 ministries than he had previous-
 ly proposed;...  The Supreme, Soviet
 will formally approve the plan,
 possibly with minor amendments;,,
 at the current session, probably
 early next week.   The only other
 item on the agenda is the rou-
 tine approval of decrees pr.'om-
 ulgatedr since the last meeting
 of the Supreme Soviet in Febru-
 ary. .
 Under the plan proposed by
 Khrushchev, about 20 industrial
 ministries are to be abolished,
 and others are to be drastically
 modified..  The planning, statis-
 tical and control organs are to
 be revamped and strengthened,
 and 92 regional, councils of na-
 tional economy established to
 assume operational control of
 the USSR's industrial enter-
 prises.
 Khrushchev urged that the
 reorganization be pushed through
 to completion during May and
 June.   Deputy Premier Lazar
 Kaganovich had told newsmen on
 19 April that the reorganization
 "will be completed by next
 winter,"
 The speed with which Khru-
 shchev wants the project carried
 out will temporarily intensify
 the confusion and dislocations
 which the change is bound to
 evoke, but the retention of
 important ministries for the
 "leading links" of production--
 at least for a transition
 period--may help to alleviate
 some of these difficulties. The
 dislocations apparently are seen
 as less of an evil than per-
 mitting the uncertainty sur-
 rounding the ministries, and
 other organs scheduled to be
 abolished or reorganized, to
 continue.   Soviet sources have
 aaready noted "how much the
 leadership of industry by the
 ministries which are awaiting
 dissolution has been weakened
 in recent days."
 The Soviet leaders did not
 wait for formal approval before
 starting to carry out personnel
 shifts associated with the re-
 organization.   Presidium member
 Mikhail Pervukhin was appointed
 on 2 May as minister of medium
 machine building, the ministry
 currently operating the Soviet
 atomic energy program.   The
 short-range planning committee
 which he headed after December
 is scheduled to be abolished.
 Pervukhin's appointment to a
 single, though important, minis-
 try may reflect dissatisfaction
 with his performance in drawing
 up the modest 1957 plan which
 scheduled the rate of growth
 at a level below that estimated
 by many observers to be required
 to meet the 1960 Five-Year Plan
 goals.
 . The biggest plum in the re-
 organization has fallen to an
 obscure behind-the-scenes party
 administrator,  Iosif Kuzmin,
 Kuzmin was appointed on 4 May
 as chairman of the USSR State
 Planning `'Commission  .(Gos-

 There may have been disagree-

 However,  the fact that he was

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 9 May 1957
 A test passage of an Israe-
 li-.Ulag vessel, the Atlit,
 through the Gulf of Aqaba to
 Eilat will probably take place
 at the end of May or in early
 June.  Although the Atlit,
 which is now en route around
 Africa, could reach Eilat as
 early as 19 May, it is reported
 scheduled to leave Djibouti in
 French Somaliland on the last
 stage of the trip to Eilat about
 28 May, reaching Eilat about 3
 June.  The Israelis reportedly
 intend to escort the Atlit from
 Djibouti through the Red Sea
 and the Gulf of Aqaba.   Israel
 now has two patrol escorts
 available for this purpose at
 Eilat, together with at least
 two armed launches and two new
 motor torpedo boats.   Israel
 reportedly expects that the
 transit will be opposed and in-
 tends to fight if attacked.
 The recent arrival of two
 newly built French destroyers
 and an LST at Djibouti to "test
 hot weather capabilities" has
 significantly increased French
 naval strength there, which
 normally consists of a. patrol
 escort, a coastal mine sweeper
 and a seaplane tender.  The
 reinforcement in French naval
 units may indicate that France
 intends to assist Israel if
 Egypt or Saudi Arabia attempts
 to prevent use of the Gulf of
 Aqaba by Israeli shipping.
 Egypt has at least two
 fleet mine sweepers and four
 to eight motor torpedo boats in
 the southern Suez Canal area,
 and could reinforce rapidly from
 Port Said.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 9 May 1957
 Suez Cana
 Britain is evidently pre-
 pared to accept Egypt's condi-
 tions for operation of the Suez
 Canal, and France is showing
 some signs of willingness to
 compromise.
 London now says it may re-
 quest a UN Security Council
 meeting on the Egyptian canal
 declaration, but only if there
 are assurances that Egypt will.
 promise at this meeting not to
 modify its declaration unilater-
 ally--an unlikely possibility.
 UN Secretary General'!- Hammar-
 skjold, who has been asked by
 the British to query Nasr on
 this subject, believes Cairo
 probably does not intend to
 make a unilateral modification,
 but would react vigorously if
 the Security Council asked for
 public assurances to this effect.
 Britain still hopes to get
 the Suez Canal Users' Associa-
 tion (SCUA) to go on record with
 a statement which would help
 the British bargaining position
 in any future negotiations with
 Egypt both on the canal and on
 unblocking Egyptian sterling
 assets.  The 8 May SCUA meeting
 discussed the Dutch proposal for
 a statement that use of the
 canal does not mean acceptance
 of the unsatisfactory Egyptian
 declaration as.a permanent
 settlement, but was unable to
 agree on a c:ominunque: and sched-
 uled a further meeting.
 Negotiations began in Basel
 on 5 May between Egyptian and
 British banking representatives
 seeking to arrange payment of
 tolls in transferable sterling.
 The British Are evidently will-
 ing"in return to release the
 $80,000,000 in Egyptian trans-
 ferable sterling assests blocked
 after the canal seizure last
 Au;gust,_but the American embassy
 in Cairo has gained the impres-
 sion from a Bank of Egypt of
 ficial that Egypt will demand
 the unblocking of all other
 Egyptian sterling assets, now
 estimated at about $200,000,000.
 British shipowners, probably
 expecting that their government
 will soon sanction use of the
 canal, are now scheduling numer-
 ous transits.
 Paris still opposes any
 move in the Security Council
 or elsewhere which might con-
 firm the Egyptian stand.  The
 French argue that if Cairo made
 a minor concession to soften
 the unilateral character of its
 memorandum, an unsatisfactory
 document would gain prestige,
 while an Egyptian refusal would
 damage the prestige of those who
 have to use the canal anyway.
 The French representative to
 SCUA stated on 2 May that France
 is willing to allow Egypt an
 opportunity to comment on the
 Suez issue in the Security
 Council itself.   In order to
 keep the door open to negotia-
 tions, France proposed that
 further negotiations with Egypt
 should be handled through a
 "negotiating committee" of the
 council.
 Paris continues to refuse
 permission for French vessels
 to transit the canal.  There
 are some signs, however, that
 its stand is becoming less
 intransigent as other countries
 permit their vessels to pass
 through the canal, paying tolls
 to Egypt under protest.  A For-

 THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT CRISIS
 The most likely successor
 to the Segni cabinet, which
 resigned on 6 May after Vice
 Premier Saragat had withdrawn
 his Democratic Socialist Party,
 is an exclusively Christian
 Democratic government.   This
 would probably be in effect a
 caretaker government.   Pending
 elections which are now sched-
 uled for next spring but may
 be held this fall.
 Saragat has been under
 strong party pressure in recent
 months to leave the government.
 This stems partly from a general
 belief that the Segni govern-
 ment has been proceeding too
 slowly with important economic
 and social reforms and partly
 from a conviction of many Demo-
 cratic Socialists that with-
 drawal would expedite reunion
 with the Nenni Socialists.   On
 18 April, when the party di-
 rectorate reaffirmed by a 14-
 7 vote its earlier stiff con-
 ditions for a merger, the left-
 wing minority reportedly
 threatened to pull out of the
 party if its mid-June congress
 endorsed these conditions and
 the party's continuance in the
 government.
 Saragat told his party
 caucus on 5 May that the next
 step would be to try once more
 for:. Socialist: reunification. His
 present position is at least
 a tactical. reversal of his
 previous stand, which he had
 reaffirmed publicly on 14 April.
 He probably wants to avoid be-
 ing isolated within the party
 now that its center, including
 former party secretary Matteotti
 and the Democratic Socialist-
 oriented labor confederation,
 has joined with the left in
 support of a merger.
 Withdrawal from the govern-
 ment--a principal precondition
 laid down by the Nenni Socialists
 for reunification--will enable
 the Democratic Socialists to
 demand that Nenni fulfill an
 important precondition they
 themselves had set--namely,
 a break with the Communists
 in the trade union field and
 in all front organizations.
 With Democratic Socialist
 adherence to any new government
 thus made improbable for the
 immediate future, the Christian
 Democrats seem likely to at-
 tempt a single-party government,
 as certain elements in the party
 have long advocated.   Party
 secretary Fanfani, who reported-
 ly favors this approach, is a
 likely candidate for premier,
 as is former premier Pella.
 Since such a government
 would have only 265 seats in
 the, 590-man chamber, it would
 have to rely on the left for
 .parliamentary support on some
 issues, and on other occasions
 on the 14 Liberals and most of
 the 40 Monarchist deputies.
 This would probably occasion no
 special difficulties on foreign
 policy and defense questions,
 but reliance on the right would
 antagonize the reform-minded
 Christian Democratic left wing
 .and might cause it to break
 away.   Important reform measures
 would be blocked and the gov-
 ernment would have to confine
 its activities to the conduct
 of routine affairs.
 Failure of protracted nego-
 tiations to produce a new govern-
 ment, or the early fall of a new
 government, ;night possibly lead
 to national elections before the
 leg-illy mandatory date of June
 1953.   Administrative technical-
 ities and a standing disinclina-
 tion to hold elections during
 the harvest season virtually
 rule them out before next fall.

 THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN DISPUTE
 25X1
 Public opinion remains in-
 flamed in both Honduras and
 Nicaragua, despite the temporary
 cease-fire agreement negotiated
 by the special committee of the
 Organization of American States
 (OAS) on 5 May.   Charges and
 countercharges of violations of
 the cease-fire by both sides
 are aggravating the situation
 and hampering the committee's
 efforts to work out a plan for
 troop withdrawals acceptable
 to both sides.
 Fighting was limited to
 minor skirmishes and some air
 action in the difficult jungle
 and ; swampland of the disputed
 area.  Most of''it occurred near
 the village of.Mocoron, captured
 .by a Honduran force on 1 May
 and reoccupied by Nicaraguans
 the next day.   The 4,300-man
 Nicaraguan national guard is
 considered superior in equipment
 and training to the 3,000-man
 Honduran army.   The slight ad-
 vantage of the Honduran over
 the Nicaraguan air force has
 been neutralized by the absence
 of Honduran  airfields near the
 fighting area.

 The Honduran military junta,
 which apparently provoked the
 current renewal of the old bor-
 der dispute primarily for domes-
 tic political reasons, succeeded
 in arousing public opinion to a
 warlike pitch.   Junta members
 now fear that they may lose
 control of the situation and,
 after signing the cease-fire
 on 5 May with great reluctance,
 informed the American ambassa-
 dor they feared public reaction
 might lead to an upheaval and
 possibly their overthrow,
 Nicaraguan leaders, though
 highly incensed at the Honduran
 moves, generally acted with
 restraint and attempted to calm
 an aroused public.   They deter-
 mined to limit, if possible,
 military action to ousting the
 Hondurans from Mocoron but at
 the same time prepared for the
 possibility of "total war" with
 Honduras.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 EGYPT'S FINANCIAL SITUATION REMAINS PRECARIOUS
 Egypt's failure in the last
 year to market a large part of
 its cotton crop and a decrease
 in foreign trade generally have
 caused a further deterioration
 in the government's precarious
 financial structure.   There is
 growing inflation, a shortage
 of some goods--particularly
 imported items--and an acute
 lack of foreign exchange.  The
 bulk of Egypt's primarily rural
 population has not yet been
 affected, while population of
 the urban .areas is aware of the
 state of the economy.
 Cairo is seriously con-
 cerned over the recent decline
 in the price of Egyptian cotton
 which had been rising almost
 steadily for over a year.  A
 major reason for the earlier
 increase had been the artificial-
 ly high price paid by the Com-
 munist countries.   This has had
 the effect of pricing Egyptian
 cotton out of the world market.
 However,  the bloc has never
 taken all of Egypt's cotton
 crop, and Egypt has constantly
 been faced with the problem of
 marketing the remainder in the
 West.
 In an effort to move this
 surplus, Cairo has instituted
 a series of discounts ranging
 from 20. percent for sales against
 dollars and 15 percent for West
 German marks to 7 percent for
 sales against Indian rupees.
 Despite the discounts, however,
 foreign buyers are still wait-
 ing for a better deal and sales
 continue to be extremely slow.
 A high-level Egyptian delegation
 which recently toured West Ger-
 many apparently failed to make
 a single sale.
 Egypt is become increas-
 ingly dependent on the Sino-
 Soviet bloc.  For example, So-
 viet bloc trade for
 January
 and February reached
 56
 percent
 of E gypt's total exports
 and
 35 percent of its imports.  This
 compares with 25 percent and'll
 percent respectively for the
 same period in 1956.
 While the bloc's share of
 trade grew sharply, Egypt's
 total trade decreased substan-
 tially.   Imports of $74,000,000
 this January and February were
 almost 21 percent lower than
 during the same period last
 year.  Exports of $67,000,000
 during these months were almost
 16 percent lower than in 1956.
 The concomitant fall in customs
 receipts--an important source
 of government revenue--exacer7
 bates the problem.   It is esti-
 mated that customs receipts by
 mid--April were down almost $26,-
 000,000 below the same period
 of 1.956.
 Egypt's net balances in
 international clearing accounts
 have also fallen substantially
 since last fall.   Its net cred-
 it balance against the Sino-
 Soviet bloc fell from about
 $23,000,000 just before hostil-
 ities to about $10,000,000 by
 mid--March.  During the same
 period,"Egypt rolled up large
 deficits with Western countries.
 The Egyptian pound, for-
 merly one of the most stable
 currencies in the Middle East,
 has substantially weakened,
 Lack of confidence in the eco-
 nomic policies of the present
 government has been partly re-
 sponsible.  Small lots of Egyp-
 tian pounds are selling for an
 average of $1.80 as compared
 with about $2,87 before the
 closing of the canal.

 April was apparently connected
 with unemployment poblems.
 Workers. in the Stalowh" Wola
 region in southeastern Poland,
 which heretofore has been quiet,
 are reportedly demanding higher
 wages.
 Denied pay increases and
 payment of back'b onuses, indus-
 trial workers see their situate--
 tion deteriorating through con-
 tinued scarcities and rising
 prices.  The American embassy
 in Warsaw has reported that
 worker "dissatisfaction and im-
 patience" have been expressed
 in "stormy factory meetings
 about difficult living condi=
 tions."
 In the Jaroslaw incident
 last week, townspeople and
 troops clashed with authorities
 attempting to arrest a young
 soldier.   The rioters were dis-
 persed only after more than
 1,000 police and troops inter-
 vened and drove off the demon-
 strators with tear gas.   Simi-
 larly last month in Stargard in
 northwestern Poland, demonstra-
 tors protesting an eviction
 beat up the mayor and battled
 with the militia.
 The expanding ranks of
 private traders and craftsmen
 are finding it virtually im-
 possible to earn a living hon-
 estly and are resorting to black
 marketeer1ng  on  a big scale.
 According to the press and,
 qualified observers, government
 and party officials, insecure
 in their jobs under existing
 circumstances, are more than
 usually susceptible to collusion
 and bribery.  Farmers are sell-
 ing greater amounts of food to
 free markets and into extralegal
 channels; they see no reason
 for fulfilling their compulsory
 delivery quotas in view of
 promises that these. will even=--
 tuall,y be abolished.;  The 'in-
 crease in prices and uneven dis-
 tribution resulting from the
 serious lag in compulsory de-
 liveries has hit the urban
 worker the hardest.
 An early solution to these
 problems is not in view.  The
 regime hopes to acquire enough
 grain abroad to meet normal re-
 quirements and to put on the
 market from time to time to
 counteract price rises.   If it
 does not succeed in controlling
 prices in this fashion, it must
 either abandon compulsory pro-
 duce deliveries and let prices
 find their true level, or en-
 force the collection of crop
 quotas,  thereby alienating the
 peasant:.-and decreasing his
 productivity.
 Furthermore the government
 may have to reappraise the
 policy of encouraging private
 trade and restrict its growth
 by denying licenses or imposing
 other rigid controls.   Com-
 missions already established to
 curb black-marketeering and
 speculation have admittedly
 proved ineffective to date.
 Sterner government action
 would risk the disillusionment
 of those who pinned their hopes
 on further liberalization.
 The government has sought
 to discourage rebellious tend-
 encies through warnings, visits
 by high officials to disturbed
 areas, and press and radio cov-
 erage of a trial of participants
 in last winter's Szczecin riots.
 Alleged popular demands for
 stricter enforcement of laws
 against "hooliganism and bandit-
 ry," referred to in an article
 by the minister of justice on
 3 May, may be the prelude to
 vigorous measures to strengthen
 control over the populace.  .
 Serious deterioration of this
 control would invite Soviet
 25X1
 intervention.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 9 May 1957
 NUCLEAR CONTROVERSY STIRS BONN GOVERNMENT
 The rapid development of
 the nuclear weapons question
 as one of the major issues in
 the campaign for the West Ger-
 man Bundestag elections in
 September has produced a split
 in the Adenauer cabinet over
 the policy to be adopted.   De-
 fense Minister Strauss reported-
 ly is insisting that immediate
 steps be taken to acquire nu-
 clear weapons, while the gov-
 ernment generally has chosen
 to back down on its public de-
 mands for weapons parity with-
 in NATO, placing greater em-
 phasis instead on the need for
 over-all nuclear disarmament.
 In a debate scheduled
 for the Bundestag on 10 May,
 the opposition parties will
 attempt to embarrass the gov-
 ernment by forcing it into an
 unpopular stand in support of
 an atomic-equipped army.
 Nevertheless, there are indica-
 tions that even in the ranks
 of the opposition Social Demo-
 cratic Party (SPD) there is
 a wide division of opinion
 over tactics to be employed
 on this issue, since many SPD
 leaders do not want to have
 any future SPD-led government
 limited in its build-up of a
 modern army.
 In the face of favorable
 public reaction to Albert
 Schweitzer's call for an end
 to nuclear testing, as well as
 to the renunciation of atomic
 bomb work by 18 prominent West
 German scientists on 12 April,
 the Bonn government has recent-
 ly stressed its own efforts to
 bring about controlled nuclear
 disarmament.   The Soviet Union,
 eager to influence political
 developments in West Germany,
 has helped to keep the issue
 alive by a propaganda barrage
 concentrating on the theme
 that the NATO council meeting
 in Bonn had focused its atten-
 tion on "plans for the atomic
 armament of NATO members, above
 all the Federal Republic of
 Germany."
 The Soviet Union's letter
 to l3onn on 27 April warning of
 the "extreme danger" of West
 Germany's alleged intention
 to arm its forces with atomic
 weapons was attacked by Foreign
 Minister Brentano as "a method
 of interference unparalleled in
 international relations," and
 provoked a further bitter ex-
 change of notes between Chan-
 cellor Adenauer and Soviet
 ambassador Smirnov.
 The Soviet leaders prob-
 ably believe that a public
 debate on the issue of nuclear
 weapons for Germany is likely
 to arouse fear and suspicion
 of Bonn's intentions among
 West Germany's neighbors and to
 disrupt plans for modernizing
 NATO's defense forces.  Mos-
 cow's 27 April warning was ad-
 dressed as much to France and
 other West European countries
 as to West Germany.   It cited
 the "alarm" felt by West Ger-
 mans and "the peoples of
 Europe" caused by Bonn's al-
 leged plans to arm with atomic
 weapons, and recalled that
 West Germany is "the only
 European state whose govern-
 ment demands a revision of the
 present frontiers in Europe."
 Other leaders cited a re-
 cent unpublished opinion poll
 showing  57 percent  of the
 West German public opposed to
 equipping the German army with

 BRITAIN AND THE "FOURTH COUNTRY" NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROBLEM
 In order to preserve Brit-
 ain's unique position as the
 only producer of nuclear weap-
 ons in Western Europe, Britain
 is looking for ways to prevent
 additional countries,  especial-
 ly West Germany, from making
 such armaments.  British of-
 ficials have urged that the
 United States consider supply-
 ing nuclear warheads to "other
 countries" on condition that
 they forswear. programs of their
 own.
 On 26 April, Foreign Secre-
 tary Lloyd told American dis-
 armament delegate Stassen that
 he thought a French decision to
 fabricate nuclear weapons might
 be only a f ew months.away, and
 that if France went ahead, West
 Germany would be quite certain
 to do so.. Some British officials
 believe that French-German col-
 laboration cannot be ruled out.
 For well over a year, Brit-
 ish officials.have cited the
 "fourth country" problem as one
 of the most impelling reasons
 for seeking an international
 disarmament agreement,   Presum-
 ably they have used the same

 the Bundestag debate the gov-
 ernment must stick to its line
 than it will take no intiative
 to acquire atomic weapons.
 argument on the USSR, espe-
 cially in playing on Moscow's
 f ear of a resurgent Germany.
 It is the general impres-
 sion among most Western dele-
 gates to the current UN Dis-
 armament Subcommittee meetings
 in London that the Soviet Union
 has been making a more serious
 effort than ever before to reach
 a limited agreement to meet
 the "fourth country" problem.
 Foreign Office assistant under
 secretary Dean told the Ameri-
 can embassy, however, that the
 Soviet proposals show that
 Moscow was not interested in
 specific steps to meet the
 ""f of rth country" problem.
 Dean suggested it might
 therefore be advisable for the
 United States, or "even" Brit-
 ain, to supply nuclear weapons,
 including warheads, to other
 countries if they would for-
 swear undertaking their own
 weapons program.  Other British
 officials had suggested earlier
 that the United States consider
 such, a move.  Any distribution
 of British nuclear weapons
 would seriously reduce Britain's
 own capability.

 If this move does not
 materialize, Britain might then
 consider using some device under
 the Western European Union to
 supply nuclear weapons to
 France or Germany, if convinced   25X1
 that only such a move would
 keep them from producing weap-
 ons themselves.

 Makarios is continuing his dis-

 however, he has already stayed

 on the Cyprus issue, which he
 hopes to discuss with British
 officials in London.   If the
 British do not indicate a will-
 ingness to receive him soon,
 he is likely to begin agitat-
 ing to return to Cyprus.
 British governor Harding
 told the American consul in
 Nicosia on 6 May that London
 is ;reasse.ssing the strategic
 value of Cyprus in the light
 of Britain's planned military
 retrenchment.   He said there
 is a limit--"say, two years"--
 on the time Britain can con-

 opposition.  Although Harding
 would prefer a "Radcliffe-
 typo" solution of limited self-
 government for the island, he
 apparently believes partition,
 "which conceivably could be
 carried out," is more likely.
 Harding considers guaran-
 teed independence, although
 preferable to partition,  "at
 least at present" to be im-
 practicable because of its
 unacceptability to Turkey.
 The consul believes Harding
 imp]Lied throughout his conversa-
 tion that Britain has seriously
 considered simply withdrawing
 from Cyprus "if all else fails."
 Turkish leaders continue
 pub]Licly and privately to con-
 demn independence and insist on
 partition.   They might, how-
 ever, eventually feel forced to
 accept a compromise granting
 Cyprus independence with treaty
 guarantees against enosis--
 union with Greece.   If the Brit-
 ish should withdraw--as in
 Palestine--without providing
 for an administrative transition,
 the Turks would.probably move to
 occupy the island.
 Colombian president Rojas'

 In April, Rojas reconsti-

 Assembly--the sole legal basis
 of his regime--and packed it
 with his supporters as the
 In response to these steps, the
 two major parties nominated a
 joint presidential candidate,
 Conservative Guillermo Valen-
 cia, and demanded free elec-
 tions in their joint platform.
 Reported military opposition
 to Rojas' continued dictatorial
 rule at a 30 April conference
 apparently caused the postpone-
 ment of his scheduled "legisla-
 tive re-election" from 1 May
 until late in the afternoon of
 8 May.
 The Catholic Church of
 Colombia, the most powerful
 politically in Latin America,
 has taken a stand against Ro-
 jas after almost a year in
 which an ill-concealed rift in
 church-state relations had been
 widening.   The hierarchy has
 displayed sympathy for the op-
 position parties and their can-
 didate; has attacked Rojas'
 governmental policies in ser-
 mons and pastoral letters; and
 has refused support to his re-
 election scheme.
 The cardinal primate, ap-
 parently with the full backing
 of Colombia's bishops, has de-
 nied the legitimacy of Rojas'
 hand-picked assembly.   Damage
 to a church in Bogota caused
 by police quelling a protest
 demonstration on 5 May will
 probably further alienate the
 hierarchy.  Moreover, Colambia.'s'
 leading 'labor 'confederation,
 closely associated with the
 church, has consistently fol-
 lowed a policy of non-co-oper_-
 ation with the regime.
 Rojas' problems are com-
 pounded by a difficult balance-
 of-payments situation which led
 to the adoption last fall of an
 austerity program pinching the
 interests of the business com-
 munity.   Important banking,
 commercial, and industrial
 groups have translated their
 economic grievances into polit-
 ical._  demands for a return to
 constitutional government.
 Business establishments are
 totally or partially closed
 downL in the major cities, para-
 lyzing the economic life of the
 country.  Management may thus
 be co-operating in a general
 strike planned by the opposi-
 tion, to protest Rojas' re-elec-
 tion,.
 Probably to conciliate the
 growing opposition, Rojas re-
 portedly has announced his in-
 tention to resign sometime dur-
 ing the 1958-1962 term in favor
 of a substitute acceptable to
 the armed forces.   Such an in-
 tention, however, will probably
 be regarded by the opposition
 as only temporizing by Rojas
 to give him time to rebuild his
 support, especially since he
 indicated his determination to
 stand firm and grant no conces-
 sions in his 6 May speech to
 the nation.
 Meanwhile popular unrest
 and violence continue to grow,
 despite the release from house
 arrest of the opposition presi-
 dential candidate.   The opposi-
 tion may be expected to invoke
 demonstrations, a general strike,
 and ;passive resistance to win
 military sympathy and provoke
 Rojas' ouster.   There has been,
 however, no known participation
 of Communists in opposition
 activities to date.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY 'SUMMARY
 9 May 1957
 President Sukarno has taken
 the final formal step in im-
 posing his concept of "guided
 democracy" by promulgating on
 8 May an emergency decree es-
 tablishing his much-heralded na-
 tional advisory council.   Sukar-
 nowill head the council, ap-
 point its members and outline
 its duties.   Communists and
 pro-Sukarno left-wingers and
 extreme nationalists probably
 will predominate among the
 council's membership.  The
 council will advise the cabinet
 "both at the request of the
 government as well as on the
 council's own initiative."
 Control of the council and
 a pliable cabinet will give
 Sukarno a direct policy role in
 Indonesian affairs.   He can be
 expected to take action to speed
 national economic development
 and to restore Djakarta's con-
 trol over the disaffected non-
 Javanese areas.   Sukarno prob-
 ably hopes to use development
 projects in the provinces to
 buy back their loyalty and at
 the same time also probably
 plans to follow a program of
 political and military pressure
 to undercut provincial leaders.
 Sukarno will leave the de-
 tails of policy implementation
 largely to his most loyal polit-
 ical followers--extreme nation-
 alist youth and army veteran
 leaders, left-wingers, and Com-
 munists--thereby creating ex-
 cellent opportunities for rapid
 Communist infiltration.
 In the provinces, however,
 reaction to the establishment
 of the council--which involves
 both increasing government cen-
 tralization and Communist in-
 fluence--will be the intensifi-
 cation of anti-Sukarno and anti-
 central government sentiment.
 In Sumatra, the desire for a
 final break with the central
 government may be further
 stimulated by the government's
 arrest in Djakarta of the South
 Sumatran "commissioner" and ten
 members of the South Sumatran
 governing council.   Any indica-
 tion of the government's in-
 tention to use armed force to
 restore central control could
 precipitate regional conflict.

 The rising resentment among
 Overseas Chinese in South Viet-

 Chinese, however, in addition
 to their reluctance to sever

 Although many officials
 in the government recognize
 the danger of a serious dis-

 anti-Chinese drive is pushed
 too hard, Diem has thus far
 been adamant in his opposition
 to any compromise.  There are
 indications, however, that the
 Vietnamese government is anxious
 to prevent the situation from
 deteriorating further during the
 president's visit to the United

 lends itself to Communist ex-

 the United States for backing
 the Saigon regime in its anti-
 Chinese actions.  The American
 embassy in Saigon has also re-
 ported that the crowd-handling
 techniques of leaders of these
 purportedly spontaneous demon-
 striations appear to show Com-
 munist training.
 With the broader implica-
 tions to its prestige among
 Overseas Chinese communities
 throughout Southeast Asia made
 all too evident by the develop-
 ments in Vietnam, the Taipei
 government has been desperately
 attempting to intercede with
 Saigon.   It has announced that
 aid will be extended to those
 Chinese born in Vietnam who
 desire to come to Taiwan.
 Chiang Kai-shek has also in-
 dicated that the next step
 "might well be" to break off

 Vietnam, although Foreign Min-
 ister Yeh has indicated this
 resort.

 In view of the present
 alignment of Laotian political

 government would probably re-

 Any prime minister would have
 to include in his cabinet rep-

 factions outside his own party
 in order to get the necessary
 two-thirds approval in the
 39-seat National Assembly.

 complicated by the new constitu-

 cabinet posts from voting for
 the formation of a government in
 which they would serve.   Under

 these circumstances,  the minor-
 ity parties--the Democrats and
 the pro-Pathet Lao National
 Union Party of Bong Souvanna-
 vong--will probably have an
 influence on the formation of
 a government which is out of
 proportion to their numbers.
 Bong, who controls approximate-
 ly one quarter of the assembly
 on foreign policy issues, would
 be in a good position to press
 for a policy of neutrality
 favoring the Communist bloc.
 In the event of a government
 crisis, the Souvanna Phouma
 cabinet would presumably remain
 in a caretaker status.   However,
 the lack of direction that would
 very likely attend a prolonged
 period of political uncertainty
 would probably weaken the func-

 facilitate the subversive
 maneuvering of the Pathet Lao.
 DUAL CITIZENSHIP PROBLEM IN
 Chief Minister Abdul Rah-
 man's main difficulty in nego-
 tiating final details for Ma-
 laya's constitution in London
 beginning 13 May will center
 on the critical question of
 dual citizenship.  This pro-
 viso is being demanded by
 Britain for the many non-Malay
 residents who are British
 citizens of other colonies or
 of Commonwealth countries.
 Since this issue is tied to
 the larger problem of racial
 antagonism in the federation,
 it has assumed major propor-
 tions in Malay minds.
 Rahman's United Malay Na-
 tionalist Organization (UMNO)
 has agreed to fairly liberal
 citizenship provisions for the
 large Chinese minority now res-
 ident.. in Malaya.   At this
 stage, UMNO leaders feel they
 cannot afford further conces-
 sions which might encourage
 immigration by many Chinese
 who are already Commonwealth
 citizens through residence in
 Hong Kong and Singapore.  These
 leaders are already under
 criticism from irresponsible,
 ultranationalist Malay politi-
 cians for agreements made to
 date.  Further concessions
 would open UMNO to political
 MALAYA INDEPENDENCE TALKS
 attack among the conservative
 Malay villagers who constitute
 the bulk of its support.
 A further Malay argument
 is that the granting of dual
 citizenship to Commonwealth
 citizens might, at some future
 date, make it difficult to re-
 fuse to formalize the same
 privilege for those Chinese
 who would want to claim con-
 current Chinese Communist or
 Chinese Nationalist citizen-
 ship.
 A special working committee
 in Kuala Lumpur apparently has
 worked out compromises on most
 other outstanding issues: a
 satisfactory arrangement has
 been achieved on the question
 of state versus federal rights;
 Islam is to be the national re-
 ligion; Malay and English the
 official languages; and preser-
 vation of the special rights of
 the indigenous Malays is promised.
 The British Colonial Office
 believes that the Malayan dele-
 gation will compromise and allow
 British colonial and Commonwealth
 citizens, under certain condi-
 tions, to obtain Malayan citizen-
 ship without giving up their orig-
 inal  citizenship.  This might be

 accomplished by British accept-
 ance  of an understanding that
 Malaya would negotiate recip-

 the British are aware that the

 offers the best hope for the

 ate, pro-Western regime in
 Malaya.  They would wish to

 For their part, the

 JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER'S SOUTHEAST ASIAN TRIP
 Prime Minister Kishi will
 be the first Japanese govern-
 ment head to visit Southeast
 and South Asian countries since
 World War II.     He is under-
 taking this trip prior to his
 visit to Washington in June to
 demonstrate his "independent
 diplomacy," to enhance his
 personal political prestige,
 and to initiate a campaign to
 win the confidence and ultimate
 leadership of the Asian nations.
 Kishi also probably believes
 that first-hand knowledge of the
 area bill be useful in negoti-
 ating with the United States
 on Japanese-American co-
 operation in Southeast Asian
 economic developments.
 Between 20 May and 4 June,
 Kishi will make approximately
 three-day visits to Burma,
 India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Thai-
 land and Taiwan.   He might in-
 clude Indonesia in his itinerary
 if a reparations agreement with
 Japan appears imminent.   Japa-
 nese opposition to the latest
 proposals for a settlement,
 however, suggest that a visit
 to Djakarta will be postponed
 until fall when Kishi plans to
 visit the remaining Southeast
 Asian countries.
 Kishi's trip will emphasize
 his policy of "personal diplo-
 macy," and probably will seek
 to overcome old animosities and.
 create a climate of mutual
 trust by persuading his hosts
 that Japan poses no threat.
 His government is making more
 effective attempts than its
 predecessors to deal with the
 practical problems of economic
 co-operation with Southeast
 Asia, and the prime minister
 will stress offers of economic
 collaboration.

 Kishi also is likely to
 seek support for the Japanese
 proposal to ban nuclear weap-
 ons tests, to stress Japan's
 desire for closer ties with
 the Asian-African bloc, and to
 invite the leaders he visits to
 come to Tokyo.   He can be ex-
 pected to sound out his hosts
 on policy toward Communist China
 and attitudes toward the Commu-
 nist bloc.   He probably will
 seek to assess local sentiment
 toward American activities in
 the area.
 The prime minister will
 probably receive a cordial re-
 ception since no sensitive
 issues exist between Japan and
 the countries he will visit. He
 is likely to receive encourage-
 ment on banning nuclear weapons
 tests, particularly in India.
 His visit to Taiwan will be the
 most difficult because the Na-
 tionalists can be expected to
 press him on the issue of re-
 lations with Peiping.
 Leaders of Kishi's Liberal-
 Democratic Party originally
 urged him to make the trip to
 push an "Asian first" policy for
 economic and domestic political
 reasons, including a desire to
 undercut the Socialist Party.
 His absence from Japan will also
 alleviate pressure ;for a cabinet
 reorganizat~on, a matter which
 Kishi prefers to postpone until
 he establishes his pre-eminence
 in party affairs.
 INCREASING THAI CONTACTS WITH COMMUNIST CHINA
 The recent acceleration
 of "unofficial" Thai contacts
 with Communist China has been
 tacitly encouraged, if not
 actively promoted, by the Bang-
 kok government.   Although Thai
 leaders still insist that for-
 mal recognition must await Pei-
 ping's admission to the UN,
 these contacts indicate a de-
 sire for some "normalization"
 of relations with Communist
 China.   Peiping is already
 seeking to exploit this opening
 in the hope of expanding its
 influence.
 While there have been
 previous "good-will" and busi-
 ness visits to Peiping by in-
 dividual Thais in the past
 months, a record number  of
 Thais are now on such missions
 in Communist China.   These
 include a 48-member cultural
 troupe--composed of Thailand's
 best artists--a labor delega-
 tion, and possibly a few jour-
 nalists.
 None of these groups could
 have traveled to Peiping with-
 out at least the tacit consent
 of Bangkok authorities as their
 members all had passports valid
 for Hong Kong, the usual point
 of entry into Communist China.
 Government collusion was partic-
 ularly suggested in the depar-
 ture of the cultural troupe.
 The size of this group.,   its
 composition, the great secrecy
 surrounding the preparations
 for its departure, and the
 absence of the usual "warnings"
 against the consequences of
 visiting Communist China all
 point to official involvement.
 The troupe is scheduled to
 visit several major Chinese
 cities and is reportedly "con-
 sidering" traveling on to the
 USSR and Poland.
 Bangkok's approval of such
 contacts with Communist China
 is probably motivated primarily
 by local political considera-
 tions.   Some Thai leaders, such
 as Minister of Interior Phao,
 reportedly believe the govern-
 ment must attract leftist sup-
 port if it is to remain strong.
 They may believe the recent

 support their position.   This
 attitude may. be a factor be-
 hind the maneuvering which is
 said to be going on in the in-
 terest of facilitating the re-
 turn of former premier Pridi
 from China.
 The Thais may also desire
 to hedge against their strong-
 ly pro-Western orientation.
 Thai leaders are acutely con-
 scious of Communist China's
 military and subversive capa-
 bilities.   There is also some
 popular sentiment that Thailand
 is losing its share of the
 Chinese market and therefore
 that trade relations should be
 promoted.
 Although the stepped-up
 contacts with Communist China
 do not portend an early or
 drastic revision of Thailand's
 foreign policies, they provide
 Peiping with an opportunity to
 enhance its influence in  an
 area from which it has here-
 tofore been effectively ex-
 cluded.   Rebuffed in earlier
 attempts to establish closer
 economic ties with Bangkok
 through offers of trade and
 aid, the Chinese Communists
 are now putting increased em-
 phasis on propaganda and "peo-
 ple's diplomacy."
 Relaxation of Thai restric-
 tions on the importation and
 screening of Chinese Communist
 motion pictures last December
 was immediately exploited by
 Peiping.   Since then 12 films
 produced in China have had suc-
 cessful runs in Thailand.  The
 American embassy in. Bangkok
 recently reported that  the
 Chinese Communists were holding
 what amounted to a "film festi-
 val" in the. Thai capital. Pei-
 ping; will almost certainly at-
 tempt to use the present Thai
 visits to press for Bangkok's
 acceptance of return visits by
 Chinese Communist "cultural"
 groups.
 CHINESE COMMUNISTS REAFFIRM LIBERALIZATION POLICY
 The Chinese Communists.
 have given new impetus to the
 liberalization campaign initi-
 ated a year ago, emphasizing
 persuasion rather than coercion
 in carrying out Peiping's pro-
 grams, and this policy is being
 followed in trying to resolve
 present "contradictions" between
 the people and the leadership.

 to "let all flowers bloom and

 is proving successful and will
 not be reversed.

 around a young man assigned to
 his first post in the party or-

 becomes gradually disillusioned
 by his encounters with party
 bureaucracy and with the cyni-
 cism of party leaders.

 from the Communist ideal and
 does not challenge the funda-

 His descriptions of party life
 have been considered inflamma-

 SOUTH KOREA PREPARES FOR NEW
 The plan of the South Ko-
 rean government to revitalize
 neighborhood associations,
 usually comprising between 10
 and 15 households, foreshadows
 increasing reliance on coercion
 and intimidation to assure the
 tenure of the governing Liberal
 Party.   Such associations, uti-
 lized by the Japanese as the
 lowest level of Korean local
 government, served as an in-
 forming and coercing device to
 keep the native population sub-
 jugated.
 The associations have con-
 tinued to function as community
 and like the Soviet writer
 Dudintsev's Not By Bread Alone,
 the novel has become the object
 of acrimonious debate.
 The limits of'Peiping's
 liberalization program have
 not been clearly defined, but
 Peiping has indicated that the
 guiding formula is to be "unity-
 criticism-unity"--that is,
 criticism will be tolerated only
 from friendly persons desiring
 unity in China and writing with
 the purpose of bringing the
 masses and the present leader-
 ship closer together,   In prac-
 tice the formula leaves to the
 regime the judgment as to when
 criticism becomes "counter-
 revolutionary" and designed to
 alienate the masses from the
 leadership.
 Apparently confident of its
 continuing ability to keep criti-
 cism within proper bounds, the
 regime condemns doctrinaire
 opponents of liberalization with-
 in the party as anti-Marxist and
 sectarian, and promises that

 the Japanese.
 While denying they would
 be controlled by the national
 police, the minister did admit
 that the strengthened associa-
 tions would assist the police
 against the "fifth column" and
 aid in exposing corrupt offi-
 cials.   Government plans re-
 portedly also call for the
 establishment of police offices
 to maintain liaison with these
 groups. Thus organized, all
 local political activity would
 be exposed to the scrutiny of
 Liberal Party supporters, who
 would need only report to the
 police to assure pressure
 against any administration
 opponent.
 Opposition apprehensions
 have been further heightened by
 proposed legislation, possibly
 to be revived when the assembly
 reconvenes in September, which
 would ensure the Liberal Party's
 supremacy.   Amendments to the
 assembly law, which include
 elimination of the secret bal-
 lot on certain issues, would
 facilitate passage of a consti-
 tutional amendment to remove
 opposition Vice President Chang
 Myon from the line of presi-

 constitutional amendment, com-

 Opposition fears of in-
 creased administration harass-

 founded.   The government's ac-
 tions tend to confirm reports
 that Liberal Party leader Yi
 Ki-pung has given up hope of
 winning a free election and
 will rely on repressive meas-
 ures to assure an administra-
 tion victory. A recent refer-
 ence by the home minister to

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 9 May 1957
 Shortly before the new
 Chinese'Communist state was
 established in 1949, Mao Tse-
 tung declared that one of its
 principal tasks would be to
 transform China from an "agri-
 cultural to an industrial state
 and from a new democratic to a
 socialist society."  Since then,
 Communist China has been in
 what its party theorists de-
 scribe as the "transition pe-
 riod" to socialism.
 Although Chinese writers
 now claim that the transition
 was a peaceful one, there was
 considerable violence and blood-
 shed in the early stages, par-
 ticularly during the land re-
 form movement in the country-
 side and the campaign against
 "vices" in the cities.  The
 populace was thoroughly cowed
 by these developments, and Mao
 Tse-tung personally ordered in
 July 1955.  that the transfor-
 mation process be greatly ac-
 celerated.  By the beginning
 of 1957, over 96 percent of the
 nation's peasant households
 were enrolled in co-operatives,
 industrial and commercial busi-
 ness was transacted largely
 through some form of socialist
 organization, and the Communists
 could claim that socialist re-
 form had been "basically com-
 pleted."
 Agriculture
 Land reform, which forced
 out the landlord and rich peas-
 ant, was the first step toward
 socialism in agriculture, fol
 lowed by the production of
 seasonal mutual-aid teams which
 were gradually transformed into
 permanent, year-round teams.
 The next step was the organi-
 zation of a number of low-level
 agricultural producer co-opera-
 tives in which income continued
 to be derived from individual
 investments of land and equip-
 ment.   The final stage has been
 the high-level co-operatives,
 virtually indistinguishable
 from the Soviet collective
 farm. The percentage of farm
 households enrolled in co-
 operatives jumped from only 15
 percent in mid-1955 to 96 per-
 cent at the end of 1956, and
 fully four fifths of the co-
 operative farmers are now in
 collectives.
 Peiping is conscious of
 the hazards of overdirection
 in :regard to the collectives.
 A recent decision by the Min-
 istry of Agriculture provides
 that in 1957 state production
 quotas will be imposed on only
 nine instead of 25 crops, "to
 encourage peasants to run the
 co-operatives independently."
 One of the most difficult
 problems facing the regime,
 however,  is how to divide a
 co-operative's harvest.   Grain
 and cotton procurement programs
 for the current crop year are
 lagging; and, while this may
 result in part,  from overesti-
 mates of the harvest, Peiping
 clearly suspects the peasants
 of holding back on the state's
 share of the crop and has urged
 local cadres to greater collec-
 tion efforts.
 Although there was little
 resistance in the beginning,
 there have been recent indica-
 tions that the peasant is be-
 ginning to grumble about his
 hard life as compared to the
 life enjoyed by city workers.
 Morale on many of the collec-
 tives is reportedly low.  The
 peasant apparently does not
 work as effectively or enthusi-
 astically for the collective
 as he did for himself.  He
 neglects the collectively owned
 animals and equipment, and
 resents the chair-borne cadres
 who eat  but do not work.   The

 the delivery quotas laid on
 them by the economic planners,
 and increased investment in
 agriculture will be required
 in order to achieve steady in-
 creases in production.
 Industry and Commerce
 When the Chinese Commu-
 nists came to power in 1949, they
 immediately nationalized enter-
 prises which had been in the
 hands of the Chinese National-
 ist government, as well as the
 property of individuals closely
 identified with it.  This in-
 cluded practically all heavy
 industry and railroads.
 A number of private busi-
 nessmen in both industrial and
 commercial pursuits, however,
 were encouraged by the new re-
 gime to continue operating.
 While it did not hide the fact
 that the eventual goal was the
 extinction  of all capitalists,
 Peiping indicated that a pro-
 longed period of capitalist-
 socialist coexistence was
 possible.
 By restrictive taxation,
 by encouraging labor excesses,
 and by taking over sources of
 supply and markets, the state
 gradually moved to curtail the
 ability of private businessmen
 to "exploit" the people.   The
 first landmark in the transi-
 tion process was the campaign
 When the gongs were stilled,
 approximately 96 percent of
 the nation's onetime private
 industrialists and 67 percent
 of ]privately owned commercial
 undertakings had taken the step
 to Joint state-private owner-
 ship.  These joint enterprises,
 in which theoretically both the
 state and private interests
 have invested money, have been
 more accurately described as
 governed, used, and managed
 exclusively by the state.  They
 constitute the last step in
 the transition process before
 socialism is attained.   Former
 capitalists are now receiving
 fixed payments, amounting to
 a liquidation dividend,  on the
 value of their private share,
 The Communists promised late
 last year that this rate of
 return, usually around 5 per-
 cent, would be continued for
 about seven years, after which
 the firms would presumably be
 completely socialized.
 Peiping acknowledges that
 many former capitalists, after
 accepting joint status, indulge
 in "improper behavior" and fail
 to "align their individual
 interests with state interests."
 As it result, a special "college
 of socialism" has been estab-
 lished in which, by intensive
 study of Marxism-Leninism,, the
 former capitalist can raise
 his "socialist consciousness."
 Several drawbacks to the
 socialization of the industrial
 and commercial economy became
 conspicuous during 1956, espe-
 cially in regard to retail
 trade.  Peiping admitted that

 commercial departments had
 inhibited production and led
 to maladjustments of the dis-
 tribution pattern.   Inflation-
 ary pressures built up, and,
 because prices were rigidly
 fixed, the quality of goods was
 reduced.  Sales dropped and so
 did state revenues.  Clearly
 an adjustment was in order.
 Last September, Chen Yun,
 China's top economic policy
 maker, stated that it would be
 preferable if a "very large
 section of industrial, handi-
 craft trade, rural sideline
 production and commerce be
 carried on under individual
 management,"  'Handicraft co-
 operatives should be split up.
 Limited price rises should be
 permitted as an incentive to
 improving quality.  "Free
 markets, duly supervised and
 limited in scope;" should be
 permitted to encourage the
 local interchange of specified
 commodities.
 Chen insisted that these
 steps, most of which have been
 put into practice, did not rep-
 resent                     a return to capitalism,
 and pointed out that state
 supervision would ensure against
 any capitalist-style profit
 taking.  He also noted that the
 state retained its monopoly in
 the trade of essential commodi-
 ties like grain, cotton, edible
 oils and export goods.
 It is unlikely that these
 measures will solve the under-
 lying problems in this field,
 and for some time Peiping will
 have to work toward  achieving
 a satisfactory compromise be-
 tween the demands of the state
 for the greatest possible re-
 turn from its commercial activ-
 ities and the requirement for
 more freedom and greater mone-
 tary incentives for individual
 traders.
 Claims to Originality
 In expounding their philos-
 ophy of socialization,  the Chi-
 nese advanced certain doctrines
 which diverged from Soviet
 views.  Avoiding direct comment
 on Moscow's insistence that the
 "dictatorship of the proletar-
 iat" was the necessary state
 form for building socialism,
 Peiping's theorists asserted
 in :1953 that the "people's
 democratic dictatorship" was
 the political structure under
 which China would advance to
 socialism.  The issue was
 largely one of semantics, pur-
 sued by Peiping primarily to
 glorify Mao Tse-tung with an
 eye to the Communist movements
 in "backward, noncapitalist"
 countries.
 In 1956, Peiping conceded
 that the people's democratic
 dictatorship was a variant
 "form" of the Soviet proletar-
 ian dictatorship.  It neverthe-
 less insisted on retaining the
 distinctive formula of people's
 democratic dictatorship, a
 formula used by no other Com-
 munist country until Hanoi
 borrowed it recently to describe
 North Vietnam's state structure.
 Peiping also claims that
 China's "peaceful" transforma-
 tion of capitalists into wage
 earners is unprecedented in
 Communist theory and practice.
 Chinese theorists credit Mao
 with having "discovered" a new
 way for socializing capitalists,
 who in China are being "bought
 out" rather than "smashed."
 Describing this method as "some-
 thing that has appeared for the
 first time in the world," they
 have asserted that the theory
 of the peaceful transformation
 of capitalism in China "is still
 another brilliant contribution
 of Comrade Mao Tse-tung to the
 .storehouse  of Marxism,"
 Since the death of Stalin,
 Moscow has gradually moved
 closer to Peiping's view of the
 Chinese transition to socialism.
 At the Soviet 20th party con-
 gress, Shepilov applauded the

 While accepting the Chinese

 the Chinese, who, according to
 a 23 November Pravda editorial,
 "always make it clear that
 their methods, though perfectly
 correct in their own country,
 are not necessarily of universal
 application."  The Chinese Com-

 been making good-will visits
 to various Middle Eastern and
 South Asian countries.   Chan-
 cellor Adenauer's visit to
 Iran in March was followed by
 that of Defense Minister
 Strauss and President Heuss.
 Foreign Minister Brentano con-
 cluded his trip around the
 world with a visit to India in
 March; Vice Chancellor Bluecher
 returned from Pakistan in
 March; and a commercial com-
 mission, composed of represent-
 atives from the Ministries of
 Foreign Affairs, Agriculture,
 and Economics, and from bank-
 ing circles, made a six-week
 tour of Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma
 and India.
 Political Aims
 Besides its interest in
 markets and investment oppor-
 tunities, Bonn is anxious to
 increase its diplomatic influ-
 ence in the Asian countries.
 Its immediate aim is to prevent
 recognition of the East German
 regime by non-Communist states.
 Bonn's long-standing position
 is that it will not maintain
 diplomatic relations with any
 state--other than-the USSR--
 recognizing East Germany, but
 it has recently been consider-
 ing establishing diplomatic
 relations with the Eastern
 European Satellites and evi-
 dently feels in need of assur-
 ances that such a move would
 not be followed by extensive
 Asian recognition of East Ger-
 many.
 Looking somewhat further
 ahead, Bonn is seeking to line
 up maximum support in the UN
 for its views.   In particular,
 it intends to get the German
 unification question brought
 before the General Assembly
 and is highly conscious of the
 important role played by India
 and other Asian members in that
 body.   Bonn has also indicated
 its concern over Communist in-
 filtration of the underdevel-
 oped Asian countries and its
 belief that this requires a
 strong Western countereffort,
 chiefly in the economic field.
 West German diplomatic
 endeavors in the area have so
 far met with moderate success.
 Brentano succeeded in getting
 Indian prime minister Nehru
 to issue a statement on the
 need for a peaceful settlement
 of German unification but did
 not obtain the commitment he
 sought of firm Indian support
 for the West German position
 on this issue.  Bonn has suc-
 ceeded in maintaining good re-
 lations with the Arab states,
 despite the anti-European feel-
 ing generated by Suez and its
 own continuing reparations
 shipments to Israel.  The Ger-
 mans have carefully refrained
 from establishing diplomatic
 relations with Israel, and the
 Arab states have refrained
 from recognizing the East Ger-
 man regime.
 Trade Drive
 The level of prewar Ger-
 many's trade has been surpassed,
 and sizable long-term financial
 investments and technical aid
 programs have been launched.
 Total trade between West Ger-
 many and the Middle East and
 South Asia amounted to $1.30
 billion in 1956, representing
 9 percent of Germany's world
 trade.
 A technical commission was
 formed in Bonn last winter to
 advise the Foreign Ministry on
 problems of co-operation with
 the underdeveloped countries.
 It will probably call for an in-
 crease of the government's tech-
 nicaal assistance fund and press
 for cheaper credits for exports
 on a long-term basis.
 Egypt:  The most striking
 illustrat on of West Germany's
 trade drive is provided by
 the industrial fair it held
 in Cairo in early April.  Of-
 ficially described by Bonn as

 efforts at infiltrating Egyptian

 HIGH-LEVEL SINO-SOVIET BLOC LEADERS
 A program of top-level
 visits among Sino-Soviet bloc
 leaders begun after the crises
 in Poland and Hungary last
 fall is apparently scheduled
 to continue on an intensive
 basis during the coming months
 to reinforce the bonds of
 "proletarian internationalism."
 The current series is much
 more extensive than the high-
 level bilateral contacts with-
 in the bloc after the death of
 Stalin.   Since October, for
 example, all of the European
 Satellite regimes have sent
 delegations to Moscow.   With
 the exception of the Poles,
 all of these groups have paid
 homage to the Soviet Union
 and to the heroic action of its
 troops in Hungary.   Satellite
 leaders have also exchanged
 visits among themselves and
 have issued communiques which,
 while paying respect to one
 another's socialist virtues
 and dealing with matters of
 mutual interest, have empha-
 sized the USSR's leadership
 of the socialist camp.
 The exchange program was
 presumably instituted by Mos-
 cow as an inoffensive way of
 publicly reasserting the form
 of control and ideological
 guidance it sought to exert for
 a time through the Cominform.
 Both the French and Italian
 Communist Parties, the only
 nonbloc Cominform members, have,
 in fact, been active in the cur-
 rent program.   The bilateral
 contacts presumably offer the
 Satellites some measure of
 prestige and sovereignty in
 harmony with the Soviet declara-
 tion of 30 October reaffirming
 Satellite "sovereignty."
 Chinese Communist participa-
 tion in the program, however--
 although undoubtedly considered
 a necessity by the Soviet leaders
 --may have had unwelcome  con-
 sequences in Moscow's eyes.

 leaders of the hostile Naga
 tribesmen who have been in
 armed revolt against the In-
 dian government since 1952.
 Top-level negotiations held
 in Assam during April between
 the Indian authorities and the
 Naga leaders may prepare the
 way for cessation of guerrilla
 activities which have threatened
 the vital rail link with upper
 Assam and cut off much of In-
 dia's frontier with northern
 Burma.

 one on the northeastern frontier
 where organized political ac-
 tivity has developed.   The
 traditional animosity of the
 Mongoloid tribesmen toward
 people of the plains has been
 shaped by shrewd leadership
 into a militant demand for an
 independent "Nagaland."  The
 surprising strength and persist-
 ence of the agitation probably
 results from the personal ambi-
 tions of such semieducated
 Naga leaders as Zapu Phizo,
 "su.premo" of the separatist
 movement and veteran- of the
 British Indian army.   Of the

 fore another monsoon season.
 Separatist Movement
 The separatist movement,
 spearheaded by certain elements
 of the Naga tribes, has long
 been the most serious of In-
 dia's frontier tribal problems.
 The Naga region is the only

 about 2,000 appear
 to be actively hos-
 tile.  Many of the
 peaceful Nagas, how-
 ever, seem to sympa-
 thize with the aims
 of the separatist
 leaders.
 Since disturb-
 ances broke out in
 1952,  the movement
 has developed into
 a resourceful ter-
 rorist operation.
 The pattern in the
 Naga Hills has been
 one of intermittent
 "incidents" which
 range from head-hunt-
 .ing and hit-and-run
 attacks on govern-
 ment police posts to
 .pitched battles with
 combined police and
 army forces.   The
 raiders have been
 well supplied with
 small arms, most of
 which apparently have
 come from abandoned
 Japanese and Allied
 war dumps in the area.
 Their familiarity with
 the wild terrain gives
 them a great advantage
 over the government
 forces.   Like the ter-
 rorists of Malaya,
 they fade into the
 jungle or mix unnoticed

 prise attacks under cover of

 Possible Foreign Support
 The Naga movement is be-
 lieved to be nationalist-in-
 spired.   Its leadership, which
 is largely Christian, reported-
 ly rejects Communism.   There
 has been no evidence that it
 has received any large-scale
 assistance from Communist
 sources.
 Previous reports of con-
 tact with the Chinese Commu-
 nists have never been confirmed,
 although a few Chinese of un-
 determined origin have been ar-
 rested in the area.   Some Indian
 officials reportedly suspect
 that Communist China is provid-
 ing the Nagas with clandestine
 financial support. While Pei-
 ping would probably regard the
 maintenance of such a potential
 base only a short distance from
 Chinese territory as in its
 long-ra'ige interests, the Chi-
 nese would be unlikely to jeop-
 ardize. their present relations
 with New Delhi by furnishing
 the Nagas with substantial as-
 sistance.
 Government Measures
 The frontier uprising ap-
 parently has caused great con-
 cern in the inner councils of
 the Indian government.   When
 the insurgent activity rose
 to an alarming point early in
 1956, the government sent
 regular army troops to the
 scene with instructions to
 eliminate the resistance once
 and for all.  After a year of
 concerted campaigning with a
 force of about division strength,
 however, the authorities have
 not met with notable success.
 In recent weeks disturbances
 have flared up again, this time
 in areas where the rebels had
 not previously operated.   This
 expansion of their operations
 to the Assam plains and to
 Manipur, however, may result
 from the fact that the army
 and police have flushed some
 of the hostile tribesmen from
 their native hills.
 Nehru has often dismissed
 the Naga movement's demands
 for independence as "absurd"
 and not to be considered in
 any event.   While New Delhi
 did indicate recently a will-
 ingness to consider measures
 for increasing tribal autonomy
 within the constitutional frame-
 work,  it refused to negotiate
 whi:Le the rebels continued their
 lawless activities.
 Negotiations
 Relations between the gov-
 ernment and the Naga leaders now
 appear to have taken a new turn,
 General    K. S. Thimayya, former
 leader of the Indian truce team
 in Korea and presently army
 chief of staff, was sent to As-
 sam in order to negotiate with
 leaders of various Naga groups,
 A conference in Shillong on 20-
 22 April was attended by two

 other ranking generals, the
 governor and chief minister of
 Assam and 30 Naga leaders, most
 of whom belong to the separatist
 organization.   The tribes rep-
 resented, however, apparently
 were-:limited to those in the
 northern Naga Hills, and the
 leaders of the more belligerent
 elements in the south evidently
 did not participate.   Consequent-

 a settlement of the rebellion.
 Despite recent signs of
 vitality, the die-hard Naga
 elements face several acute
 problems--the most important
 relate to food shortages, mili-
 tary supplies and recruiting.
 The movement has also suffered
 recently from factionalism:
 Phizo's leadership has been
 SECRET
 openly challenged, a tendency
 which is likely to be accentu-
 ated by the authorities' recent
 overtures.
 The government, on its part,
 is faced with a military cam-
 paign which seems to offer less
 prospect of success with each
 season, while at the same time
 the problem grows more embar-
 rassing politically and more
 demanding financially.   In ad-
 dition, New Delhi's urgent pro-
 grain for developing and securing
 adjoining areas of the isolated
 and vulnerable Northeast Fron-
 tier Agency must be sharply cur-
 tailed while such a concentrated
 effort is necessary in the Naga
 sector.
 These problems and the
 pattern
 of recent developments
 suggest
 that both sides in the
 con:Flict
 now may be ready to
 work out
 a compromise settle-
 ment.
