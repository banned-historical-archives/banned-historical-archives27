 OPEN WAY TOWARDS A SOCIALIST ALGERIA
 Programme Of The Communist Party of Algeria
 New Age, Communist Party Weekly
 mew Delhi, August 5, 1962
 The recently-published Programme of the Alge-
 rian Communist Party is "a programme of national
 liberation,  true democracy and economic and social
 progress.
 "It is the programme for the building of an Alberiar_ State, of national
 de ocracy, which should open pup the way towards a socialist Algeria", de-
 cles this historic document- the first and so far the only statement of aims
 by any Algerian political group.
 In defining "What the Algerian Republic Should be", it calls firstly for
 "an independent republic, sovereign, one and indivisible", making it clear
 that this implies the evacuation "sooner or later" of French troops and bases.
 Algerian unity "implies the ending of all privileges arising out of
 colonisation.  This is not incompatible with the guaranteeing of the legitimate
 non-colonialist interests of the Algerian minority of European or of Jewish
 origin, with their equal representation within the elected assemblies, respect
 for their particular language, culture and religion, within the framework of
 Algerian law. "
 Secondly, the Programme declares that the Algerian Republic should
 be "a truly democratic republic".  This, it points out, implies the rejection
 of authoritarian methods and of repression of the masses. "
 True  democracy "should also be apparent in the
 institutions  of the Algerian state",  to be  created
 by a Constituent National Assembly elected by
 direct, single,  universal and secret ballot by all
 over the age  of 18,  with all Algerians over the  age
 of 20 eligible to stand as  candidates.
 This Constituent Assembly should draw up a Constitution. Its provisions
 should include:
 - a single National Assembly elected for four years, with a
 government formed by it and responsible to it;
 - a national non-regular people's army which "will help in
 the tasks of reconstruction to the extent that it is not occupied
 with national defence.... The people will ensure that this army
 ... is not used as an instrument of reactionary and anti-
 democratic policies, as has been the case in many Middle East
 and Latin American countries";
 - guarantees for human rights, individual liberty and freedom
 of thought, opinion, press, public meetings, association, worship,
 the recognition of trade union rights and the right to strike.
 Thirdly, the Algerian Republic should be "a Social Republic" - "political
 independence alone will not bring about the tremendous change in the situation
 which is required: it should be accompanied by true economic independence
 and radical social measures. "
 Analysing the economic situation of Algeria, the Programme points out
 that it is characterised by "the relationship of domination and dependence im-
 posed by the colonial regime.
 "This domination is first of all direct; the landed property owners,
 ultra-colonialists, possess the best land whilst the French monopolists and
 foreign monopolists have their hands on the mineral and fuel resources, on
 industrial enterprises and the banks....
 "Domination is equally indirect; it is exercised by colonial institutions
 imposed on the people, such as the Custom s Union (with France - Ed.) free-
 donAppto edf,or  tehsou2OO?/flfl/2aittaiA-RUP 8,08O1A900i'Q0070006-9

 The Programme makes a critical examination of the financial and eco-
 nomic provisions of the Evian Agreement which brought about a cease-fire in
 Algeria.
 The Agreement marked a  "considerable  step for-
 ward" and "admits the principle of the economic
 and financial sovereignty of Algeria" but "there are
 limitations to certain parts of this  sovereignty,  in
 particular in the  section dealing with agrarian reform
 and nationalisation of the main wealth of the  country. "
 The Algerian Communist Party demands the complete ending of eco-
 nornic and financial dependence on French imperialism, the breaking of the
 stranglehold of the French and international monopolies and an end to the
 privileges enjoyed by the colonialists and feudalists.
 It calls for an economic plan to develop the national economy, diversi-
 fy production (thus ending the dependence on a small number of crops or pro-
 ducts characteristic of colonial economies) and improve living standards.
 This plan should be based on:
 - agrarian reform;
 - the mobilisation of savings for investment, above all in heavy industry;
 - full employment on work of national interest.
 On the first point,  the  Programme declares that
 "the Algerian Communist Party proposes the  confis-
 cation,  pure  and                          simple,  and without compensation,
 of land owned by the big  colonialists, " pointing out
 that these number about 7,000 and alone  own about
 90 per  cent of the  colonis&'d  land.
 It calls for the confiscation of the land of the big Algerian feudal land-
 owners and of big estates belonging to landlords who I ollaborated with the
 French colonialists.
 The surplus land of big proprietors who did not betray the national
 cause wiould also be limited "in friendly fashion and taking into account
 the value of the land. It
 The land should be redistributed free to landless poor peasants,  to
 middle peasants with insufficient land (with priority for ex- servicemen of
 the Algerian Liberation Army and the families of those who died in the war)
 and also to "small farmers who are Algerian citizens: of European origin
 who have insufficient land (giving priority to those who assisted the Algerian
 Liberation Army)".
 It calls for the encouragement of genuine agricultural cooperatives.
 Certain big estates (notably the big vineyards producitig good wines of which
 the export forms a big part of Algeria's national revenue) should become
 cooperatives or State farms run by agricultural workers and technicians.
 The  Programme's  section on industrialisation
 calls  for the nationalisation of Algeria's natural
 wealth,  including the rich Sahara oil and natural
 gas  deposits,  coal, iron,  phosphates etc.
 In addition to the building of a heavy industry, which it sees as the
 basis of economic independence, the Programme proposes the extension
 of light industry, including controlled private enterprise, the encourage-
 ment of traditional and modern artisans' cooperatives and the extension of
 the country's road and rail system built up by the colonialists primarily
 to facilitate the country's exploitation and the rapid deployment of troops.

 The Programme outlines a series of social measures, including
 steps to aid victims of the war, a fair wage policy of equal pay for equal
 work, the eight-hour day, health, education, housing and women's rights.
 Underlining that progress depends upon  "the  total
 and enthusiastic mobilisation of our people",  the
 Programme  declares that  "the first condition for
 this mobilisation is the  conscious and resolute unity
 in action of all anti-imperialist and progressive
 forces within the  nation.
 "The Assembly on the basis of a common programme, should make
 itself into a Front of national organisations grouped together, respecting
 the autonomy of each organisation and within the framework of a common
 discipline.
 "Many patriots and leaders of the National Liberation Front feel that
 this assembly should be one single party.  What should be the programme
 and ideology of this one party?  The attitude of the Algerian Communist Party
 will be determined by the reply to this question.
 "The Algerian Communist Party is opposed to a single party based on
 nationalist bourgeois ideology.  Such a party, even if its composition is
 popular, even if its leaders spring from the working class or the working
 peasantry, would sooner or later be the instrument for the domination of
 the working masses by the bourgeoisie, even if this bourgeoisie has not at
 the present moment a solid economic foundation in the country. "
 The Algerian Communist Party will be in favour of a single Party
 based on working class ideology if the political and social conditions are
 created, the Programme goes on, recalling the example of the United
 Socialist Party of Cuba.
 "But whilst working for a  single  party formed on
 such a basis,  and for the  time when political and
 social conditions will be ripe for such a party,  the
 Communist Party of Algeria does not support the
 suppression of parties  reflecting the interests of
 anti-imperialist bourgeois  or petit-bourgeois  sections
 Abroad, the Programme advocates a policy of peaceful coexistence,
 non-adherence to military blocs (specifically excluding the use of the Algerian
 Sahara as a nuclear testing ground), solidarity with Morocco and Tunisia who
 are on the way to building a united Arab Maghreb based on anti-imperialism,
 democracy and social progress and cooperative and friendly relations with all
 countries, above all with the Socialist countries.
 "Neither agrarian reform nor nationalisation will be sufficient to build
 socialism, " it declares.
 Socialism, it goes on, means:
 _ the social ownership of the principal means of production;
 - the progressive collectivisation of agriculture;
 -'working class leadership of thd riational'and progressive forces;
 - the existence of a strong Marxist-Leninist Party.
 "It is in order to lead our people, together with all Algerian patriotic
 andp-rogreosive.forces, that our Party, conscious of its guiding role, has
 set rut this programme and puts it before all Algerians, in this year which
 ought to be the start of new struggles for independence, for land and bread,
 for work and education, true democracy and the unlimited progress of our
 nation", it concludes.

 Marx's Theory of the Alienation of the Worker
 Since Marx's concept of socialism is closely related to the transformation
 of "alienated labor" into "free labor" it is useful to determine exactly how he
 conceived of these terms.  In the first of four essays -- subsequently entitled
 the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts -- which were written between
 April an August 1844 (iretlier wars early^nn his career, pre -dating even the
 Communist Manifesto), Karl Marx discusses in detail the question of alienation.
 In act, the' first o t e four manuscripts bears the title, Alienated Labor. Marx
 begins the manuscript by accusing contemporary political economists of tarting
 with the fact of private property rather than explaining it, of failing to show, th^t
 is, how the laws of political economy develop from the nature of private proper?.),.
 Marx concludes that "the only moving forces which political economy recognizes
 are avarice and the war between the avaricious, competition. " Marx defines
 his task as one of demonstrating
 "the real connection between this whole system of
 alienation -- private property, the separation of labor,
 capital and land, exchange and competition, value and
 the devaluation of man, monopoly and competition --
 and the system of money. "
 In the process, he examines three types of alienation which occur in the pro-
 duction process.
 In discussing man's relationship to external nature from which he lives
 (plant life, animal life, air, minerals etc.), Marx points out that the latter
 constitute a part of human consciousness as objects of natural science to be
 studied and as objects of creative activity to which man can give shape, pro-
 a ortion color etc.  From the practical aspect also they constitute part of human
 life since man lives from nature's products in the form of food, fuel, clothing,
 housing etc.  Thus external nature is the direct means of life and also the
 material object and instrument of life activity.  According to Marx, "Conscious
 life activity distinguishes man from the life activity of animals" which are one
 with their life activity.
 "Man makes his life activity itself an object of his
 will and consciousness.  Only for this reason is his
 activity free activity.  Alienated labor reverses the
 relationship, in that man, because he is a self-
 conscious being makes his life activity, his being,
 only a means for his existence. "
 Marx distinguishes three types of alienated labor.  First of all, Alienation
 of the Worker from the Products of his Labor.  Materialistically, Marx chooses 'with to begin      what he terms a "contemporary economic fact," that is, that
 "The worker ri. e. in this case the alienated worker of
 a modern industrial society-_7 becomes poorer the more,
 wealth he produces ~oorer, that is in his "humanness"7....
 The devaluation of the human world increases in direct
 relation with the increase in value of the world of things.
 Labor not only creates goods; it also produces itself
 and worker as a commodity, in the same proportion as
 it produces goods....  The alienation of the worker in
 his product means not only that his labor becomes an
 object, assumes that is an external existence, but that
 it exists independently, outside himself, and alien to him,
 and that it stands opposed to him as an automonous power. "
 /The creation  of the nuclear bomb might be used to illustrate a product which
 fas assumed an external existence, alien to its creators and opposed to them
 as an "autonomous" power.?  Subsequently, Marx concludes: "Political econon j
 conceals the alienation in the nature of labor insofar as it does not examine the
 direct relationship between the worker (work) and production. " And, a bit
 later, "The direct relationship of labor to its products is the relationship of the
 worker to the objects of his production. "
 The second category of alienation distinguished by Marx is Alienation of the
 Worker in the Activity of Production.  "Alienation appears not only in the result,
 but also in the process of production."   What constitutes alienation of the
 production process ?

 "First, that the work is external to the worker, that
 it is not part of his nature; and that, consequently, he
 does not fulfill himself in his work but denies himself,
 has a feeling of misery rather than well being, does
 not develop freely his mental and physical energies but
 is physically exhausted and mentally debased.  The
 worker therefore feels himself at home only during
 his leisure time, whereas at work he feels homeless.
 His work is not voluntary but imposed, forced labor.
 It is not the satisfaction of a need, but only a means
 for satisfying other needs.  Its alien character is
 shown by the fact that as soon as there is no physical
 or other compulsion it is avoided like the plague.
 External labor, labor in which man alienates himself,
 is a labor of self-sacrifice, of mortification.  Finally,
 the external character of work for the worker is shown
 by the fact that it is not his own work but work for
 someone else, that in work he does not belong to him-
 self but to another person....  We arrive at the result
 that man (the worker) feels himself to be freely active
 only in his animal functions -- eating, drinking and
 procreating, or at most also in his dwelling and in
 personal adornment -- while in his human functions he
 is reduced to an animal. it
 Thirdly, in thejrocess of production, the worker is also alienated from
 his "species life" / i.e. his identification as a human beinj7 since it transforms
 the very activity through which he should confirm his "humanness" into a means
 of physical existence.  "Thus alienated labor turns the species life of man.. .
 int^ an alien being and into a means for his individual existence.  It alienates
 man from his own body, external nature, his mental life and his human life. "
 Marx summarizes:  "A direct consequence of the alienation of man from the
 product of his labor, from his life activity and from his species life is that
 man is alienated from other men... What is true of man's relationship to his
 work, to this product of his work and to himself, is also true of his relationship
 to other men..."  He then goes on to show that alienated labor in turn creates
 the alien person to whom the product of the alienated labor belongs, i.e. the
 "capitalist" (note that this is Marx's original definition).
 "Through alienated labor the worker creates the
 relation of another man, who does not work and is
 outside the work process....  Private property
 /1. e. the objects created by alienated labor and
 which now belong to an alien being, the capitalist-/
 is thus derived from the analysis of the concept of
 alienated labor, alienated life, and estranged man. "
 The example which comes to mind as the embodiment of Marx's idea of
 "positive labor" is that of a thirteenth or fourteenth century goldsmith. Such
 a "laborer" would creatively and joyfully shape external nature (in the form of
 a golden metal) into an object in which he confirmed his "species being" and
 his basic identity (through art) with his fellow man, thus confirming in concrete
 form his human nature in such a way that he was not only able to fulfill himself
 in his work but would (if he were of the caliber of let us say Benvenuto Cellini
 of 16th Century Florence) contribute to "species image" of Western man for the
 next 500 years and more.
 The Communist world has continued until the very recent past to deny that
 such a phenomenon as alienation could occur in a "socialist" state, and -- as
 the Soviet, Polish and Czech daily press bear witness -- has not found realistic
 or efficacious means for dealing with this important problem.

 EVENTS UP TO OCTOBER 1962
 After a period of relative calm, recent weeks have have again witnessed
 marked symptoms of deterioration in Sino-Soviet relations.  At the 22nd CPSU
 Congress a year ago, the air rang with indirect attacks on Chinese policies,
 thinly disguised as attacks on Albania and the "Anti-Party Group.." After the
 Chinese Communists responded by attacking Soviet policies at the December
 1961 meeting of the World Peace Council in Stockholm and elsewhere, Khrushchev
 rejoined by turning the Chinese attacks on "full-belly socialism" against the
 Chinese themselves, saying on 5 March that certain people were "preaching
 equality in the spirit of the first Christian communities with their low standard
 of living and asceticism," and adding: "Communism cannot be depicted as a
 table with empty plates and occupied by highly conscious and completely equal
 people.  To invite people to such Communism is tantamount to inviting people
 to eat soup with a fork. " But in mid-March, Moscow Radio stopped attacking
 the Albanian leaders (except in broadcasts in Albanian, where the attacks ceased
 in early April) until early May, and with the exception of certain mid-May
 articles, there was an absence of polemic in the Soviet press until late June.
 Instead, in early April there was glowing Soviet comment on a joint Chinese-

 20 April a Sino-Soviet protocol on goo s exc anges was signed with a great
 display of politeness, although the Soviets appear to have offered no new credit,
 On the Chinese side, a series of articles in Red Fla  attacking Soviet policies
 was interrupted from early March to late Apri , an    in early July the principal
 Chinese delegate to the Moscow Peace Congress stated the Chinese position in
 moderate terms and praised Khrushchev personally.     The Chinese also behaved
 moderately at the Youth Festival in Helsinki,  There was minor static at intervals
 throughout this period, but nothing on the scale of that seen in the winter of
 1961-2.  It is possible that, behind the scenes, negotiations for a reconciliation
 were going on.
 If there were any such negotiations, they must now be suspended, or at
 least in serious difficulty.  Symptoms of friction and realignment include:
 1.  Chinese attacks on the doctrine of the priority of peaceful
 coexistence and general disarmament were made in Red Fla  (1 August),
 at the 6th Congress of the WFDY (Warsaw, 10-16 August) and at the
 7th Congress of the IUS (Leningrad, 18-29 August).  The Red Fla
 article advocated the Chinese pattern of revolution for co onia and
 semi-colonial countries, while at Warsaw, Wang Chat-hua argued that
 disarmament was not the only, or the most important way to safeguard
 world peace.  There and in Leningrad, the Chic oms maintained that
 the essential thing was to weaken imperialism, in particular through
 the national liberation movement; this would be the best way to secure
 world peace (!).  A Moscow youth paper, Moskovsky Komsomolets,
 reacted by noting that "some students still underestimate the
 importance of the disarmament problem and have a wrong idea of
 the relationship between the struggle for national independence and
 general and complete disarmament."                                would clc
 2.  On 25 September, V'w viet . f#icial^ rya;.: rtadly said that the USSR /
 its two remaining consulates in China (Shanghai and Harbin); their
 activities are to be taken over by the Soviet Embassy in Peking.  The
 Soviets claimed that the closure was based on reasons of economy,
 but the USSR has never been stingy when it could maintain listening
 posts in other countries, and there had been rumors on 20 September
 that the Chic oms had requested the closing of Soviet consulates.       On
 5 September, the Soviets also announced that the Chinese Ambassador
 was leaving Moscow for a new assignment; though the Embassy will
 continue to function under a charge d'affaires, it is interesting that
 the Chinese Ambassador did not (as did the West German Ambassador,
 Kroll) see Khrushchev before his departure.  So far as is known, the
 present Soviet Ambassador       in Peking has never been received
 by Mao Tse-tung.
 3.  According to a report in the New York Times (24 September),
 the Soviet theoretical journal Kommun st  ? s noww published an article
 warning revolutionaries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against
 "unjustified over-zeal," saying that capitalist economic forms must be
 eliminated in a stage of "general democratic development" before newly
 independent states can be ripe for Communism: "Neglect of general
 democratic problems and undue haste may narrow the popular basis
 of Socialist revolution and compromise the noble idea of Socialism in
 the eyes of the masses." This amounts to a serious attack, not only
 on current Chicom policy, but also on China's own revolution.

 Chinese People's Republic was celebrated in Peking, with hundreds
 of thousands of marchers passing the reviewing stand, but no
 important Soviet official observable in it.  At a Chinese anniversary
 rally in Moscow, the highest Soviet representative was the Minister
 of Higher and Specialized Secondary Education, G. M. Pushkin.  On
 30 September, Chou En-lai renewed the Chinese attack on "modern
 revisionism," implicitly including Khrushchev as well as Tito in the
 charge, and maintained that efforts to "isolate" China would be
 fruitless.  And at the anniversary ceremonies in Tirana, the Chinese
 delegation chief voiced Chinese opposition to "great power chauvinism
 e. , Soviet chauvinisrR. "
 5.  The visit of the Soviet titular chief of state, L. I. Brezhnev,
 has provoked new attacks on Yugcolavia from Peking and Tirana.
 On Brezhnev's arrival on 24 September, Belgrade Radio disclosed
 that the Soviet party included "Deputy of the Supreme Soviet Andropov."
 Andropov, whose first name and patronymic are Yuriy Vladimirovich,
 is also, and far more important, the chief of the CPSU Central
 Committee Department for Liaison with Communist and Workers'
 Parties of Socialist Countries, as well as a former Soviet Ambassador
 to Hungary,   a has frequently traveled to various satellite capitals.
 His presence is significant, in that it suggests that in addition to
 improving relations between the two countries at the state level, an
 attempt may be made for closer cooperation at the Party level as well.
 Brezhnev's visit, ostensibly at the head of a parliamentary group, may
 have resulted from another "parliamentary" visit in the opposite
 direction.  Brezhnev's tour was announced on 10 July, shortly after
 a delegation of members of the Yugoslav Federal People's Assembly,
 headed by Pete Stambulic, toured the Soviet Union in the last week of
 June and the first week of July. Among the Yugoslav delegates was
 Dusan Mugosa, a Party leader in the Kosmet district, which is
 Yugoslavia's Albanian minority region; Mugosa was instrumental in
 organizing the Albanian Workers Party (the Albanian CP) after World
 War II.  Recently, during Brezhnev's  visit (on 30 September),
 Mugosa stated, in a speech reported by Borba, that communism in
 Albania was threatened by Hoxha and Shehu, and asserted that even
 Albanian Politburo members lacked confidence in them.  These facts
 suggest that the Soviet Union may have given tacit consent to Yugoslav
 policies directed toward the overthrow of the Albanian regime and its
 replacement by one controlled by - or at least sympathetic to - the
 Yugoslav brand of "socialism. " The presence of individuals like
 Andropov and Mugosa in delegations is often overlooked by non-Commu-
 nists, but does not pass unnoticed by the veteran Party leaders in
 Peking and Tirana.

 TEXT OF FINAL COMMUNIQUE OF ASIAN-AFRICAN PARLEY
 The Asian-African conference, convened by the Government of Burma,
 Ceylon, India, Indonesia and Pakistan, met in Bandung from the 18th to 24th of
 April, 1955.
 In addition to the sponsoring countries, the following twenty-four
 countries participated in the conference:
 Afghanistan, Cambodia, People's Republic of China, Egypt, Ethiopia,
 Gold Coast, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Nepal,
 the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Turkey, Democratic
 Republic of (North) Vietnam, State of Vietnam and Yemen.
 The Asian-African conference considered the position of Asia and Africa
 and discussed ways and means by which their poeples could achieve the fullest
 economic cultural and political cooperation.
 A.   Economic Cooperation
 1.  The Asian-African conference recognized the urgency of promoting
 economic development in the Asian-African region.  There was general desire
 for economic cooperation among the participating countries on the basis of
 mutual interest.and respect for national sovereignty.
 The proposals with regard to economic cooperation within the participating
 countries do not preclude either the desirability or the need for cooperation
 with countries outside the region, including the investment-of foreign capital.
 It was further recognized that assistance being received by certain
 participating. countries from outside the region through international or under
 bilateral arrangements had made a valuable contribution to the implementation
 of their development programs.
 2.  The participating countries agree to provide technical assistance to
 one another, to the maximum extent practicable, in' the form of:
 Expert, trainees, pilot projects, and equipment for demonstra-
 tion purposes;
 Exchange, of know-how, and establishment of national and- where
 possible- regional training and research institutes for imparting
 technical knowledge and skills in cooperation with the existing
 international agencies.
 Development Funds Proposed
 3.
 The early establishment of a special United Nations fund for
 economic development;
 The allocation by the International Bank for Reconstruction
 and Development of a greater part of its resources to Asian-
 African countries;
 The early establishment of an international finance corporation,
 which should include in its activities the undertaking of equity
 investment ; and
 Encouragement of the promotion of joint ventures among Asian-
 African countries insofar as this will promote their common
 interest.
 4.    The Asian-African conference recognized the vital need for stabilizing
 commodity trade in the region.
 The principle of enlarging the scope of multilateral trade and payments was
 accepted.  However, it was recognized that some countries would have to take
 recourse to bilateral trade arrangements in view of their prevailing economic
 conditions.

 5.  The Asian-African conference recommended that collective action
 be taken by participating countries for stabilizing international prices of and-
 demand for primary commodities through bilateral and multilateral arrange-
 ments, and that'as far as practicable and desirable they should adopt a unified
 approach on the subject in the United Nations Permanent Advisory Commission
 on International Commodity Trade and other international forums.
 6.     The Asian-African conference further recommended:
 Asian-African countries should diversify their export trade by
 processing their raw-materials whenever economically feasible
 before export; intra-regional trade fairs should be promoted
 and. encouragement be given .to the exchange of trade delegations
 and groups of businessmen;, exchange of'information and of
 samples should be encouraged with a view to promoting intra-
 regional trade; and normal facilities should be provided for, the
 transit trade of landlocked countries.
 'i. Tlie Asian-African conference attached considerable importance
 to slapping and expressed concern that,slupping lines reviewed from time
 to tiara their freight rate$ oftep to',the detriment of participating countries.
 It recommended a. study. of this , problem and, collective action there--

 on matters relating to oil, such as remittance' of?pr&fits and taxation,
 might finally lead to the formulation of a common. policy.
 Nuclear Energy Stressed
 IO.'     The Asian-Af rican conference emphasized'the particular
 significanee of the development of nuclear energy for the peaceful purposes
 for. Asian-African countries.
 The conference.w alcomed the initiative of the powers principally
 concerned in'offering to make available information regarding the use of
 atomic energy for peaceful purposes;
 Urged the speedy establishment of an international atomic energy
 agency which should provide for adequate.representation of the Asian-
 African countries on the executive authority of the agency; and
 Recommended that Asian and African governments take full advantage
 of the training and other facilities in the peaceful uses of atomic energy
 offered by the countries sponsoring such programs.
 11.  The Asian-African conference agreed to. the appointment of
 liaison officers in participating countries, to be nominated by their
 respective national. governments, for the exchange ;of information and
 matters of mutual interest.
 It recommended that fuller use should be made of the existing inter-
 national. organizations, and participating countries w.ho were not members
 of such international organizations but were eligible should secure member-
 ship.
 12.   The Asian-African conference recommended, that there should
 be prior consultation of participating countries in international forums with
 a view, as far as possible, to furthering their mutual economic interest.
 It is, however, not intended to form a regional bloc.

 B.  Cultural Cooperation.
 1.  The Asian-.Afri.can conference was convinced,. that among the most
 powerful means of promoting understanding among nations is the develop-
 ment of cultural cooperation.  Asia and Africa have been the cradle of great
 religions and civilizations which have enriched other cultures and civili-
 zations while themselves being enriched in the process.
 Thus the cultures of Asia and Africa are based on spiritual and
 universal foundations.  Unfortunately, cultural contacts among Asian
 and African countries were interrupted during the past centuries.
 The people of Asia and Africa are now animated by a keen and sincere
 de sire to renew-their old cultural contacts and develop new ones in the
 context of the modern world.  All participating governments at the conference
 reiterated their declaration to work for icloser cultural cooperation.
 The Asian-African conference took note of the fact that the existence
 of colonialism in many parts of Asia and Africa, in whatever form it may
 be, not only prevents. cultural cooperation but also suppresses the national
 cultures of the peoples.
 Basic Rights Found Denied
 Some colonial powers.have denied their dependent peoples basic rights
 in the sphere of education and culture, which hampers the development of
 their personality and also prevents cultural intercourse with other Asian-
 and African peoples.
 This is particularly true in the case of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco,
 where the basic right of the people to study their own language and culture
 has been suppressed.
 Similar discrimination has been practiced against African and Colored
 people in some parts of the Continent of Africa.
 The conference felt that these policies amount to a denial of the
 fundamental rights of man, impede cultural advancement in this region and
 also hamper cultural cooperation on the wide international plan.
 The conference condemned such a denial of fundamental rights in the
 sphere of education and culture in some parts of Asia and Africa by this
 and other. forms of cultural suppression.
 In particular, the conference condemned racialism as a means of
 cultural suppression.
 3.  It was not from any sense of exclusiveness or rivalry with other
 groups of nations and other civilizations and cultures that the .conference
 viewed the development of cultural cooperation among Asian and African
 countries.
 For World Cultural Ties
 True to the age-old tradition of tolerance and universality, the
 conference believed that Asian,and African cultural cooperation should be
 developed in the larger context of world cooperation.
 Side. by side with the development of Asian-African cultural coopera-
 tion the countries of Asia and Africa desire to develop cultural contacts
 with others.  This would enrich their own culture and would also help in
 the promotion of world peace and understanding.
 4.  There are,many countries in Asia and Africa which have not yet
 been able to develop their educational, scientific and technical institutions.
 The conference recommended that countries in Asia and Africa which
 are more fortunately placed in this respect should give facilities for the
 admission of students and trainees from such' countries to their institutions.

 Such facilities should also be made available to the Asian and
 African people in Africa, to whom opportunities for. acquiring higher
 education are at present denied.
 5.   The Asian-African conference felt that the promotion of
 cultural cooperation among countries of Asia and Africa should be
 directed towards:
 a.  The acquisition of knowledge of each other country;
 b.  Mutual Cultural exchange; and
 c. Exchange of information.
 6            The Asian-'African conference w;a,s of the opi'nion that at this
 stage the best results in cultural; cooperation-would be achieved by pur-
 suing bilateral arrangements. to mplem:ent its. recomtend.at ons and by
 each country taking action on-its own wherever possible and feasible.
 Eights'- and. Sc if- Determination
 C.    Human
 1.           The Asian-African conference declared its full- support of the
 fw damental principles of. human rights as set forth in the Charter of the
 United Nations and took note` of the iJniversal. Declaration of Hum"an Rights
 as a common ,standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations..:
 The conference decl'a.xedits full support of the principle of self
 determination of peoples and nations..as, set forth in the Charter of the
 United.`Natiois and. took note of'the United Nations resolutions `on th"e
 right of. 'people's and nations to self-determiuiation, vuhi c li is a pre
 requisite of the full enjoyment of all fundamental human .rights.
 2.  The Asian-African conference deplored thepoli.cies and practices..
 of racial segregation and discrimination which form ?the.taasia.of.geve.rnu ent
 and' human. relations in large regions of Africa and in other, parts of the world.
 Such conduct is not only a . 'gro s s violation of human rights but also
 a denial of "the fundamental values of civiliza.t on and' the dignity of man.
 The conferenice extended its warm sympathy and support for the
 courageous stand taken by the  ictir' "i of racial discrimination, especially
 by the peoples of African and Indian and Pakistani' origin in South. Africa;
 applauded all those who sustained their cause; reaffirmed the determination
 of. Asian-African peoples to eradicate every trace of racialism that night
 exist in their own countries; and pledged to use its full moral influence to,
 guard against the danger of falling victims of the same evil in their' struggle
 to eradicate it.
 3.: In view of the existing tension in the .Middle East caused by
 the situation in Palestine and of the danger of that tension to world peace,
 the Asian-.African conference declared its support of the rights of the
 Arab people of. Palestine and called for the implementation of the United,
 Nations resolutions on Palestine and of the peaceful settlement of the
 Palestine question.
 D.  Problems of Dependent People:
 1.  The Asian-African conference, in the context of its expressed
 attitude on the abolition of colonialism, supported the position .of 'Indo . -
 nesia in the case of West Irian (Dutch New Guinea) on the relevant agree-
 ments between Indonesia and the Netherlands.
 The Asian-1-African conference urged the Netherlands Government
 to reopen negotiations as soon as possible to implement-their obligations
 under the above-mentioned agreements and expressed the earnest hope
 that the United Nations could. assist, the parties concerned in finding a,
 peaceful solution to the dispute.

 2.  In view of the unsettled situation-In North Africa and of the--
 persisting denial to the peoples of North Africa of their right to self-
 determination, the Asian-African conference declared its +uppor't of
 the rights of the people of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to `self-
 determination and independence and urged the French Government to
 bring about a peaceful settlement of the issue without delay.
 F.   Promotion of World Peace and Cooperaton:
 1.  The Asian-African conference, taking note of the :fact that
 several states have still not been admitted to the United Nations, con-
 sidered that for effective cooperation for world peace" membership in
 the'United-Nations should be universal, called on the Security Council
 to support the admission of all those states which are qualified for
 membership in terms of the Charter.
 In the opinion of the Asian-African conference the following
 countries which were represented in it  Cambodia, Ceylon, Japan,
 Jordan, Laos, Libya, Nepal and unified Vietnam - were so qualified.
 The conference considered that the representafon of the
 countries of the Asian-African region of the Security Council in
 relation to the principle of equitable geographic distribution was
 inadequate.
 It expressed the view that as regards the, distribution of the non-
 permanent seats,. the Asian-African countries which, under the' arrange-
 ment arrived at in London in 1946, are precluded from being elected,
 should be enabled to .serve on the Security Council, so that they might
 make a more effective contribution to the maintenance of international
 peace and security.
 Z.  The Asian-African conference having considered the dangerous
 situation of international tension existing and the risks confronting the
 whole human race from the outbreak of global war in which the des-   -
 tructive power of "all types of armaments including nuclear and thermo-
 nuclear weapons would be employed, invited the attention of all nations
 to the terrible consequences that would follow if such a war were to
 beak out.
 .Disarmament Proposed
 The conference considered that disarmament and the prohibition
 of production, experimentation and use of nuclear and thermonuclear
 weapons of war are imperative to save mankind and civilization from the
 fear and prospect of wholesale destruction.
 It considered that the nations of Asia and Africa assembled here
 have a duty toward humanity and civilization to proclaim their support
 for the prohibition of these weapons and to appeal to nations principally
 concerned and to world opinion to bring about such disarmament and
 prohibition.
 The conference considered that effective international control
 should be e stablished and maintained to implement such prohibition
 and that speedy and determined efforts should be made to this end.   --
 Pending the total prohibiti:inof the manufacture of nuclear and thermo-
 nuclear weapons, this conference appealed to all the powers concerned
 to reach agreement to suspend experiments with such weapons.
 The conference declared that universal disarmament is an absolute
 necessity for the preservation of peace and requested the United Nations
 to continue its efforts and appealed to all concerned speedily to bring
 about the regulations limitation, control and-reduction of all armed forces
 and armaments ilu4ing the prohibition of the production, experimentation
 and use of all weapons of mass destruction and to establish effective
 international control to this encl.

 in the case,of :Aden ,and the, southern, arts of Yemen known as the pro-
 tectorates and urged.the parties -`-conccrned to ar'r"ive at,a"peaceful settlement
 F.  Declara,.tion, of ap'r6blems'of Dependent Peoples:
 The Asian-African conference discussed the problems of dependent
 peoples and colonialism and the evils arising from the subject to what. is
 stated in the following paragraph;,,~ the. conference is-agreed:
 In declaring that' colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil
 which should speedily be brought, to an end;
 2     affirming that the subjection of ,peoples to alien subjugation,
 domination.anc: exp'loitatiori'c'oristitute a. denial of.fundamental human rights
 is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and is an impediment to
 the promotion of, world peace..and cooperation;
 3.  In declaring its support of the cause of freedom and 'ndependence
 for all such peoples; and
 4.  In calla' g upon the powers concerned to grant freedom and inde-
 pendence to such peoples..
 G.  Declaration of Promotion of World Peace and Cooperation: '
 The Asian-African conference gave anxious_ thought to, the que stion
 of world peace and cooperation.  It 'viewed with deep concern the'present
 state of international tension with its'danger of an atomic world war:
 The problem of peace is correlative with the problem: pf international
 security.  In this connection all states should cooperate especially `through
 the United Nations in bringing about the.reduction of armaments. and the
 elimination of nuclear weapons under effective international control.
 In this way international peace can be''promoted and nuclear energy,
 may be used exclusively for peaceful purpose.  This would help answer the
 needs, particularly of Asia and Africa, for what they urgently require are
 social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.
 Freedom and peace are interdependent.    The right of. self-determination
 must be enjoyed by all peoples and freedom and independence must be '"granted
 with the least possible delay to those who are still dependent people.
 Indeed all nations: should have'the right freely to. choose their own
 political and economic systems and their own way of life in conformity
 with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
 Free from "c'iatrnst.:and fear -and-; itb 'ctinfi,c-lerice andwgeodwiU " i
 toward each other, nations should practice tolerance and live together
 in peacewit'hone another 'as good neighbors and develop friendly cooperation
 on the basis of the following principles:
 1." Respect for the fundamental human rights and for the purposes
 and principles. of the charter of the United Nations.
 ,2.  Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations.
 3.  Recognition of the equality of all races and of the equality of all
 nations, large and small.
 4.  Abstention froth intervention or interference in the internal affairs

 bute to the maintenance and promotion of international peace and security
 while cooperation in the economic, social and cultural fields would help
 bring about the common prosperity and well-being of all.
 The Asian-African conference recommended that the full sponsoring

 POLITICS
 Had President Soekarne's regime
 adopted the same apolitical atti-
 tude, the Fourth  Asian  Games
 would have been a joyful thing to
 remember.  As it Is, the Jakarta
 meet  Is  unlikely to go down In
 sports history by that name. The
 splendid performance of the athletes
 who are   competing there at the
 moment is being matted by the cold
 intrusion of politics, the spotlight
 has shifted from the magnificent,
 new stadium  in Jakatta-.-perhaps
 the finest in the world-to the com-
 mittee rooms outside where it rum-
 bet of Asian sports authorities and
 the Indonesian   Government. are

 Both the supoil, facilities pro.

 'the infliction  of politics on the
 games are the result of the same
 cause: President Soekarno's belief

 one is quite overwhelmed as one

 Ilrabourne Stadium. Then there is
 a stadium for hockey which can
 seat 25,000; the indoor stadium can
