 THE WEEK IN PERSPECTIVE
 Little heavy fighting took place in South Vietnam
 last week, but the incident rate remained high.  The
 seven-day period was highlighted by a Christmas truce,
 more fastidiously observed by the allies than by the
 Viet Cong.
 The South Vietnamese Government has begun to
 initiate a policy of reprisals against supporters of the
 dissident tribal autonomy movement, FULRO, although
 some officials are still urging moderation. Meanwhile,
 there are continuing reports of dissatisfaction within
 the military over the present Ky-Thieu leadership,
 including rumors of coup plotting.

 I,   THE SITUATION IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 A.   POLITICAL SITUATION
 1.   The South Vietnamese Government has begun to
 implement a tougher policy toward members and sym-
 pathizers of the tribal autonomy movement FULRO,
 which staged an abortive uprising in the central
 highlands ten days ago.   A military tribunal in II
 Corps began holding trials on 27 and 28 December
 for nearly 40 persons accused of complicity in the
 revolt,  about half of them tribesmen from a rebel-
 lious government paramilitary company in Phu, Bon
 Province.   The remainder are officials,  schoolteachers,
 and students arrested in Pleiku Province for complic-
 ity with FULRO.   Four of the troops were sentenced
 to death;  two of them have already been publicly exe-
 cuted in Pleiku,    and the other two, unless granted
 clemency,  are scheduled for execution in Phu Bon.
 Some 30 montagnards have received sentences ranging
 from life imprisonment, in one c:as;e,  to oneyear,
 with the majority sentenced to 10-20 years of com-
 bined prison terms and exile.   Only four men were
 acquitted,
 2.   Additionally,  II Corps commander General
 Vinh Loc issued two decrees aimed at crushing the
 FULRO movement.   The first orders the populace to
 refrain from any cooperation with FULRO on penalty
 of execution.   The second decree,  apparently not yet
 published but presumably dating from 20 December,
 grants members of FULRO a grace period of 20 days
 in which to surrender,  after which they will face
 "the severest punishment."
 3.   Some members of the government in Saigon,
 including vice premier and defense   minister General
 Co,   reportedly are counseling restraint toward the
 majority of some 300 FULRO members in government
 hands,  lest there be an adverse reaction among the
 montagnard tribes in general.   General Loc himself,
 a strong proponent of a tough line toward the FULRO
 rebels,  included programs of assistance to the
 montagnards in a recent planning session on pacifi-
 cation in II Corps.   However,                             Loc and other military
 officers in II Corps have reportedly agreed to keep
 another 300 former FULRO troops, who pledged allegiance

 to the government late last summer,  on extended train-
 ing detail in coastal Khanh Hoa Province,  rather than
 return them to active combat against the Viet Cong in
 the highlands.
 4.   In Saigon,  meanwhile,  there are further
 reports of dissatisfaction within the military over
 the performance of General Ky as premier, and of pos-
 sible coup plotting to overthrow K                                and chief of
 state General Thieu.                                             25X1C
 police director   o one   Ram Van Lieu,  in
 complicity with  I  Corps commander General Nguyen
 Chanh Thi,  is plotting a coup to take place at the
 een  ppro c e   on   e a    o  unname    a   o is
 generals seeking his support for a move to oust Ky
 and Thieu; Quang, who has made no secret of his dis-
 taste for Thieu,                             a Catholic with Dai Viet Party con-
 nections, was alleged to feel that a change in gov-
 ernment would open up little prospect for the Buddhists
 until they have successfully launched a Buddhist po-
 litical party.
 5.   Although there continues to be no firm evi-
 dence of any imminent coup,  criticisms of Ky-and his
 government's alleged failings continue to be re-
 ported from various circles.   General Thi has fre-
 quently been quoted as critical of the regime's lack
 of progress and as expecting eventually to be called
 upon to take over the government and rid it of cor-
 ruption.   He has been reported closely associated
 with Lieu since their mutual paratroop service.   Lieu
 himself appears independently ambitious    He has in-
 dicated that he desires a broader cabinet assignment
 in the intelligence-security field.   He is also
 associated with several members of Ky's original
 civilian "braintrust," some of whom Ky reportedly
 desires to remove from positions of influence.
 6.   Earlier this month, Colonel Lieu reportedly
 observed that differences among South Vietnam's
 ruling generals were increasing,  but that no faction
 appeared capable of mustering enough support to mount
 a coup.   Lieu indicated in particular that southern-
 oriented generals,  including Defense Minister Co,
 were dissatisfied, and that retired General Tran Van

 Don and his southern supporters were a threat to
 stability.   Lieu commented,  however,  that he felt
 the only likely means by which Ky might be replaced
 would be by decision of the ruling military Directorate.
 7.   Premier Ky continues both publicly and pri-
 vately to discount the likelihood of a successful
 coup attempt.   In comments to the press on 29 De-
 cember,                                he implied,  however,  that other means might
 be tried to remove him.   He cited,  as an example,
 attempts to bribe him with up to US $1,000,000 to
 accept a post abroad.
 8.   Indicative of the type of charge to which Ky
 may prove vulnerable was the recent exoneration by
 a military tribunal of General Tran Tu Oai--a prom-
 inent officer during the Diem regime--and 12 associ-
 ates accused of embezzlement.   No explanation for the
 acquittal of Oai, who was tried in absentia,  has
 been offered,  despite the fact that the case against
 him was allegedly "air-tight," and expected to be-
 come a major example of the government's anticorrup-
 tion policies.
 9.   The secretary-general of the Directorate,
 General Phan Xuan Chieu,  recently outlined to a
 US Embassy officer  government  plans for establishing
 an advisory council early in 1966.   Chieu stated
 that the Directorate had decided, with only Premier
 Ky in opposition,  to grant the council more concrete
 responsibility than originally proposed.   He said
 that the council would probably have about 60 mem-
 bers, who would be formally presented to the public
 following the convocation of another armed forces
 congress,  probably about the time of the lunar new
 year, or Tet, from 21-23 January.   Chieu volunteered
 no information on the identity of the council mem-
 bers,  implying some difficulty in finding qualified
 persons willing to serve.   He noted, moreover,  that
 earlier plans to establish a "national front" of
 political parties to support the military regime had
 been deferred,  presumably because prominent civilian
 politicians were more interested in opposition
 activity.
 10.   In connection with the projected advisory
 council, Buddhist monk Tri cuang has on more than

 one occasion emphasized to US Embassy officers his
 dissatisfaction with the Directorate's plans.   Quang's
 objections appear to stem from a belief that the coun-
 cil will have virtually no representation from exist-
 ing provincial and municipal councils,  currently the
 only democratically elected bodies in South Vietnam.
 In the background of Quang's position is his apparent
 suspicion that the advisory council may be a vehicle
 for Directorate chairman General Thieu to further
 the prospects of the Dai Viet Party and various
 Catholic elements.
 11.   The Viet Cong Liberation radio on 28 Decem-
 ber broadcast a "decision" of the Liberation Front
 to cease attacks on government troops during the
 Tet festivals,  for the four-day period from 20
 through 23 January.   The broadcast,  stressing the
 national character of the Tet holiday,  did not spe-
 cify a cessation of attacks on US and third country
 troops during the lunar new year period,  but implied
 that attacks by the latter during the Tet would incur
 the opposition of all Vietnamese forces--the Commu-
 nist as well as the government.   In previous years,
 the Viet Cong have sharply reduced activity during
 the new year period,  but last year the Tet was
 followed by a sharply intensified Communist military
 campaign.
 12.   South Vietnamese officials, who last year
 proclaimed no open cease-fire posture during the Tet
 but generally held operational activity to a minimum,
 have indicated that they may also observe a cease-fire
 this year.   However,  possibly to curb speculation of
 a bid to initiate negotiations,  South Vietnath's For-
 eign Minister Tran Van Do told an American reporter
 on 28 December that South Vietnam opposes any formal
 cease-fire or unconditional negotiations with the
 Communists.   Do characterized the Saigon government
 as willing to entertain "corridor" discussions,  but
 "dead set" against peace negotiations at present.
 He claimed that the Communists would never negotiate
 in good faith,  as long as they felt they stood a
 chance of winning on the battlefield.   Do added that
 he did not think there was any contradiction between
 his government's position and the US willingness to
 engage in "unconditional discussions."

 13.   Both Premier Ky and Chief of State Thieu
 have also reiterated to the press in recent days
 their belief that the Communists were not prepared
 to undertake serious negotiations at present.   Ky
 rejected the four points proposed by North Vietnam
 as a basis for negotiations as tantamount to asking
 "unconditional surrender".   General Thieu declared
 that any possibility of talks depended on the Com-
 munists,  but indicated that he felt that,                               because
 of Chinese Communist. pressure on North Vietnam,  the
 outlook was for further escalation of the war.

 14.   During the week ending 23 December retail
 prices in the Saigon area generally remained at
 levels slightly under those prevailing a month earlier.
 Prices of imported commodities continued to rise
 moderately except for certain commodities such as
 cement, the price of which has risen 129% over the
 past month.
 15.   As a result of meetings with rice merchants,
 the GVN Ministry of National Economy has now agreed
 to government purchases of red rice as well as
 *hite rice.   While this will partially ease the over-
 all rice problem, private banks on the other hand,
 may adopt a more restrictive rice credit policy.
 The US mission is encouraging easing of these credit
 restrictions.
 16. Congestion in the Port of Saigon is expected
 to be improved to a limited degree when the  (French)
 Messageries Maritimes complex, which was recently
 purchased by the GVN,  is turned over to the US.Army
 on 1 January for exclusive use of US military cargo.
 However,  ports in central and northern South Viet-
 nam are experiencing off-loading delays due to the
 onset of-the northeast monsoon.

 B.   MILITARY SITUATION
 1. Combat activity remained at a generally low
 level throughout the week,  with no significant con-
 frontations occurring. Only two of the eight Viet
 Cong attacks were estimated at battalion or larger
 size.   The highlight of the period was a relatively
 one-sided Christmas cease-fire.
 2. During the period 19-25 December,  861 inci-
 dents were reported,  comparable to 866 the previous
 week.   The kill ratio favored the government to a
 lesser degree, 3.7 to 1 as against 4.3 to 1 last
 week.   Viet Cong casualties included 937 killed and
 137 captured,  about the same as last week's 952 and
 130.    The government lost 227 killed,  499 wounded,
 and 104 missing or captured,  an improvement over the
 previous week's 359,  555,  and 257.respectively.   US
 casualties were 21 killed,   95 wounded,  and 11 missing
 or captured.   No allied casualties were reported.
 Weapons losses slightly favored the government forces,
 who lost 226 and captured 246.   A marked decline of
 Chieu Hoi response also occurred, with
 35
 military
 defectors compared to 214 last week and
 returnees as against 101.

 GVN/Allied Activities
 3.   Government and Allied military activity con-
 tinued,                                  until Christmas,  at the same level as in the
 previous week, with one highly successful operation
 reported.   Of 70 battalion or larger operations during
 the 19-25 December period,  42 made enemy contact,
 whereas last week's 69 achieved only 31.   A total of
 23,661 small unit operations,  including 2,726 US,  re-
 sulted in 163 contacts, with 78 of these by American
 troops.
 4.   The most significant government action of the
 week was an ARVN 21st Division operation on 22 Decem-
 ber.   More than seven ARVN battalions boxed in an
 estimated Viet Cong battalion in the Chuong Thien-
 Phong Dinh border area of IV Corps Tactical Zone.
 Maximum use was made of artillery and tactical air
 support,  and Viet Cong positions in a canal-cut paddy
 area were then assaulted,  resulting in 282 Viet Cong

 killed and 12 captured,  along with numerous weapons.
 ARVN losses were 21 killed and 51 wounded.
 5.     Friendly military activities were halted
 abruptly during a GVN-ordered Christmas cease-fire
 which began at 6 PM on 24 December.   Following a
 series of incidents and small attacks by the Viet
 Cong,  friendly operations were resumed after the
 cease-fire period.   No significant major engagements
 have developed,  although ARVN reports of a three-
 battalion search-and-destroy effort in Long An Prov-
 ince indicate contact with a substantial Viet Cong
 force on 27 December;  initial casualty figures show
 100 Viet Cong killed,  with ARVN losses of two killed
 and nine wounded.
 6.   US and Allied forces ended a relatively quiet
 week by moving back to base areas for the Christmas
 holiday, and terminating several operations.   Three
 US and one Korean operations of   battalion  or
 size are now in progress,  in addition to six beingger
 conducted by ARVN forces.
 7.   Sea, River, and Coastal Force operations de-
 clined during the 19-25 December period, with 3,035
 junks and 11,834 persons searched, compared to 3,655
 and 15,078 of the previous week.  Of the 106 detainees,
 none was confirmed Viet Cong.
 8.   B-52 raids were concentrated against target
 areas in Bien Hoa and Vinh Binh provinces during the
 pre-Christmas period.   The first B-52 Stratofortress
 strike since the holiday was conducted on 28 December
 against a suspected Viet Cong complex in Quang Tri
 Province.   The total number of B-52 missions over
 South Vietnam to date is 133.
 Communist Activities
 9.   Viet Cong activity continued at the same high
 level throughout the week of 19-25 December,  but its
 intensity decreased.   Partial observance by the Viet
 Cong of their announced Christmas Eve 12-hour cease-
 fire, with disregard for a 30-hour Allied cease-fire,
 highlighted  the end of the week.   A total of 65 in-
 cidents occurred during the 30-hour period, with 18
 during the Viet Cong 12-hour lull.   The same incident

 distribution pattern with respect to Corps Tactical
 Zones prevailed during the Christmas period as through-
 out the week.   Since the official end of the Viet Cong
 cease-fire at 7 AM on 25 December,  the tempo and in-
 tensity of Communist activity have increased.
 10.   Incident levels remained high all week in I
 Corps  (CTZ), where six attacks,  including two of bat-
 talion or larger scale, were mounted.   A multibattalion
 attack against an outpost in western Quang Tri seemed
 indicative of a renewed Viet Cong effort to re-occupy
 the Route 9-Ba Long Valley infiltration corridor.   An
 estimated Viet Cong battalion attacked a Regional Force
 company about seven miles north of Quang Ngg  City.
 Elsewhere in I CTZ,  the usual variety of harassment
 and interdiction was in evidence.
 11.   No attacks were reported in II CTZ, and in-
 cident levels were low there for the eighth consecutive
 week.   The continued inactivity of Viet Cong/PAVN units
 in this region is believed indicative of a regroupment,
 replacement,  and retraining phase.   Continued infiltra-
 tion and other movements are reported,  and PAVN forces
 involved at Plei Me and Chu Pong during October and
 November are expected to be capable of large-scale
 attacks in the highlands within two weeks.
 12.   In III CTZ,  a one or two-company attack was
 reported in Hau Nghia Province, involving the Trung
 Lap Training Center.   The 101st Regiment,  325th Divi-
 sion  (PAVN), has reportedly moved from Quang Duc Prov-
 ince of II CTZ into northern Bien Hoa Province of III
 CTZ, with the alleged mission of attacking Bien Hoa
 Air Base.   There are low-level indications that a
 battalion of the Dong Thap Regiment has moved from IV
 CTZ into Long An Province in III CTZ.   These reloca-
 tions are unconfirmed,  but the threat of isolation of
 the capital area appears to be increasing.
 13.   In the Capital Military Region, a series of
 grenade incidents marked the continuation of the Viet
 Cong's anti-American and anti-police terroristic
 campaign.   Two assassinations of hamlet chiefs in the
 Capital Military Region brought the total of such in-
 cidents to five during December.   There have been 11
 assassinations of local government officials in 'three
 months in the Hop Tac area.   Since mid-December four

 Military Region.
 14.   One attack occurred in IV CTZ,  involving
 two Viet Cong companies against a Special Forces
 camp in Kien Tuong Province.   Of the incidents per-
 petrated by the Viet Cong during the Christmas cease-
 fire period,  almost twice as many occurred in IV CTZ

 1.   There was a sharp drop during the past week
 in the total number of Chieu Hoi returnees.   Accord-
 ing to the official GVN tally only 120 persons
 rallied to the government during the period.   This
 contrasts quite unfavorably with the previous week's
 total of 499 persons.   Civilian returnees constituted
 more than one-half of the current week's total, with
 74 listed in this category.   There were also 35
 military defectors,  and 11 political officials.
 Totals for the previous week were 214 military defec-
 tors,  101 political officials,                           18-2 civilians,  and
 two draft dodgers/deserters.
 2.   The US Cadre Liaison Group in Saigon,i.s now
 working closely with the new chief of the rural con-
 struction cadres, Lieutenant Colonel Tran Ngoc Chau
 General Lansdale's Senior Liaison Office is also
 maintaining close contact with both the US Cadre
 Liaison Group as well as the Ministry of Rural Con-
 struction.   Colonel Chau has prepared and distributed
 a draft statement of basic policy for the recruitment,
 training,  and employment of rural construction cadres.
 The policy statement is to be reviewed and commented
 on by provincial authorities,  after which a final
 policy directive will be issued.   Colonel Chau and
 his American advisor also are continuing their survey
 of cadre resources in order to match assets at hand
 against projected requirements for 1966 provincial
 pacification plans.   Based upon this survey,  a priority
 system will be established for training and deploying
 rural construction cadres.
 3.   For the first time,  all provinces have or will
 have approved rural construction budgets before the
 beginning of 1966.   Hopefully, provincial budgets will
 also be strengthened during the year by certain re-
 visions such as improved fiscal and accounting pro-
 cedures,  the details of which are now being worked
 out.
 4.   In order to insure the timely and effective
 implementation of the 1966 rural construction pro-
 grams,                               the minister of Rural Construction, General Nguyen
 Duc Thang, plans to create a 120-man inspection corps.
 This group of inspectors will be responsible for making
 field checks to insure that the programs are being
 conducted as planned.

 5.          Although the Viet Cong have already proposed
 a four-day truce period during the lunar new year
 holiday (20-23 January), government plans for a major
 effort, starting early in January,  apparently will
 not be affected.   South Vietnamese and US officials
 are in the midst of a joint planning effort for an
 all-out holiday psychological warfare effort.   Plan-
 ning is broad in scope and is intended to reach all
 segments of the South Vietnamese population as well
 as the Communist armed forces.   Objectives of the
 program include encouragement of a maximum response
 to the Chieu Hoi effort,  enhancement of the confidence
 of the Vietnamese people in their  government,, belief
 in the invincibility of the GVN cause,  and erosion
 of confidence of Viet Cong/PAVN confidence in their
 leadership and cause.   Intensive efforts will be
 made to cause desertions among the ranks of the Com-
 munist military forces as well as to sway the civilian
 population in Viet Cong-controlled and contested areas.
 Full advantage will be taken of the sentimental aspects
 of the holiday season--especially  the "return to home"
 theme.
 6.   Part of the psychological campaign will be
 the introduction of television into South Vietnam,
 hopefully by the time of the Tet celebration.   Public
 announcement of the TV plan. was made on 24 December
 by the Saigon government.
 7.   A recent report by USIS in Saigon points up
 two notable examples of the slowly evolving impact
 of psychological warfare operations against the Com-
 munists.   In the IV Corps Tactical Zone,  it was noted
 that, during the period 25 October-14 November,  62
 of a total of 86 Chieu Hoi returnees came in bearing
 specially prepared surrender leaflets.   These leaflets
 were part of an intense government effort conducted
 throughout IV Corps area on 24 October. The Viet
 Cong were reported to have reacted to this campaign
 by killing several GVN cadres and two children of
 other GVN officials,  as well as by threatening Viet-
 namese Information Service personnel.   During the
 Plei Me campaign in Pleiku Province, most of the 14
 PAVN defectors were reported to have been carrying
 surrender leaflets.   Surrender leaflets were found
 on many of the bodies of the Communist dead.   In view
 of the prevalence of these leaflets among the PAVN

 dead, USIS comments that ways should be developed to
 provide an opportunity to surrender to those who desire
 to do so.
 8.   According to a 26 November report from the
 US consul at Hue,  a pacification effort,  launched in
 mid-October to recover those areas of Hoa Vang district
 which lie close to Da Nang city and the vital US air-
 base,  has made little tangible progress.   The plan,
 originally presented in late September by the province
 chief,  actually did not get underway until 18 October
 when the first search-and-destroy operations were
 launched.   The operation was the outgrowth of an agree-
 ment by Major General L.W. Walt,  III Marine Amphibious
 Force Commander and the I Corps Tactical Zone commander
 General Nguyen Chanh Thi to cooperate in a joint effort
 to pacify certain areas hear the Da Nang airbase.
 9.   The concept of operations visualized a two-phase
 program to pacify nine'villages and 38 hamlets..'Five
 villages, with 21 hamlets were to be pacified during
 the period 1-30 November, with the remaining villages
 and their hamlets completed in December.   However, no
 significant progress had been reported by 26 November.
 10.   GVN statistics relating to the security con-
 ditions in this area close to Da Nang .are_remarkab;ly
 candid,  and present a bleak picture.   Of the 15,845
 families in the area,  over 1,000 are known to have
 relatives with the Viet Cong.   Over 450 identified
 Communist officials and guerrillas are from this region.
 Twenty of the 48 hamlets in the area are acknowledged
 to be under Viet Cong control,  nine are considered
 secured,  and nine contested.   Only 83 Popular Forces
 and 50 village and hamlet officials are present in
 the area.
 11. The operational force which was to operate
 in this thoroughly penetrated area initially consisted
 of one Regional Force battalion,  five People's Action
 Teams  (PAT), 344 Mobile Action Cadres, psychological
 warfare teams,  and the small number of government
 personnel already present.   Two 'US Marine battalions
 were detailed to ring the area in order to prevent
 penetration by outside Viet Cong forces.

 II.   DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BLOC
 A.   POLITICAL
 1.   Hanoi propaganda has attempted to discredit
 the current 'US cessation of the air attacks against
 North Vietnam by claiming that hostile US air activ-
 ity over the DRV :is continuing.   The DRV has protested
 to the ICC charging that "many formations of US jet
 fighters repeatedly overflew the DRV and carried out
 reconnaissance and provocative activities" on 25,  26,
 27, and 28 December.   Th:i.s is the same line that Hanoi
 took toward the first :five-day cessation of the bomb-
 ings last May.   Neither Peking nor the Liberation
 Front has yet commented on the current standdown.
 2.   Moscow's decision to send one of its top
 leaders--party secretary Shelepin--to Hanoi indicates
 a clear intention to make its influence felt with the
 North Vietnamese.   The visit,  announced on 28 December,
 will mark the first trip to Hanoi by a high-level. So-
 viet leader since the Kosygin mission last February.
 The Soviets probably feel that the current pause in
 US bombing raids against North Vietnam provides a good
 opportunity to encourage Hanoi to seek political al-
 ternatives to the war.   The announcement of the
 Shelepin visit coincides -with increased Russian ma-
 terial and political support for the DRV and renewed
 expressions of Hanoi's gratitude for Moscow's "great
 assistance,"
 3,   The Soviet mission represents a direct chal-
 lenge to China's influence in Hanoi, however.   In
 what may have been an effort to placate the Chinese,
 the North Vietnamese party daily on 28 December
 published a lengthy article praising the "broad and
 tremendous support" which Peking has provided North
 Vietnam.   The article cited numerous examples of
 Chinese pledges of support,  including statements by
 Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai.   There was,  however,
 an undertone in the article suggesting that Hanoi
 feels Chinese aid has been more in the form of talk
 rather than action.   Although Peking has insisted that
 it will "stand shoulder to shoulder" with its Vietnam-
 ese comrades, Hanoi may feel that Peking should pro-
 vide additional assistance and cooperate more fully
 with Soviet efforts to aid the DRV.

 4.   Hungary granted North Vietnam a new long-term
 interest-free loan as well as a moratorium on repay-
 ment of past loans on 28 December,   In addition,  a
 separate agreement on Hungarian "economic assistance
 of a different nature" was also signed in Budapest by
 North Vietnamese Deputy Premier Le Thanh Nghi and
 Hungarian Vice Premier   Fock.   The vague terminology
 used to describe the second agreement may indicate an
 attempt by the Hungarians to supply minimum support
 for Hanoi's war effort without publicly committing
 itself to any specific military assistance,   The an-
 nouncements indicated, however,  that the assistance
 offered is more generous than Le Thanh Nghi was able
 to arrange when he was in Budapest early last summer,
 The DRV deputy premier has gone on to East Germany.
 B.     MILITARY
 1.   Eleven MIG-21/FISHBED fighters have been in-
 troduced into the North 'Vietnamese fighter inventory,
 but apparently there is no appreciable change in the
 composition of their MIG-15/17 force.
 Detailed analysis of 23 December high altitude
 photography revealed the following tactical aircraft
 at the airfields indicated:
 49 MIG-15/17s                  9 MIG-l5/17s
 5 possible MIG-15/l7s
 5 IL-28/BEAGLES
 7 MIG-21/FISHBEDs
 4 probable MIG-21s
 The detailed photographic analysis could not
 determine if the confirmed MIG-21s were clear air mass
 or all-weather models.   In either case,  these newer
 generation fighters at Phuc Yen pose an increased
 threat to US air operations over North Vietnam.
 It is possible that a number of MIG-15/17s and
 several IL-28 aircraft were airborne during the period
 the high altitude aircraft overflew Phuc Yen and Kep
 airfields,  however,  it is believed that the inventory
 remains at about 63-66 MIG-15/17s.

 in exercising the right of self-defense might take
 action across  the Cambodian borderr^.   Accusing the United
 States of seeking excuses for military intervention in
 Cambodia, Phnom Penh has called upon the 1954 Geneva
 signatories to make clear their intentions should the
 US violate Cambodian borders, reserved the right to ap-
 peal to the UN,  and declared that all border incursions
 will be repulsed.   Meanwhile, Cambodia's invitation to
 the ICC to control the part of Sihanoukvilie and in-
 spect':arms shipments to Cambodia?s military forces
 remains under consideration.
 6.   The GVN intercepted two Cambodian motorized
 launches towing five junks each near Phu Quoc Island on
 25 December.   The launches escaped, but a GVN patrol-
 craft captured some of the junks and nine Cambodians.
 The junks were carrying only shovels and baskets and no
 gunfire was exchanged during the interception, suggesting
 that Viet Cong were not aboard,   Subsequently, on 27 De-
 cember,                       a GVN patrol craft reported it was being ap-
 proached by a Cambodian patrol craft and requested US
 assistance.   Embassy Saigon, however, directed that under
 no conditions were US units to engage Cambodian units,
 even if South Vietnamese units or territory were to be
 attacked.   The 'US mission has requested clarification of
 the rules of engagement and. recommended that US naval
 units not become involved in fighting between Vietnamese
 and Cambodians.

 INFLATIONARY PRESSURES EXPECTED IN
 SOUTH VIETNAM IN 1966
 1.   The GVN economy will face growing inflation-
 ary pressures during 1966.   The large and mounting
 deficit in the GVN budget,  the increase in  US.
 forces,    and the planned US increase of i:n-country.
 spending for military and civilian construction will
 place new demands on an economy which has little un-
 used capacity.                            Transportation bottlenecks, a short-
 age of labor,  and possible decreases in agricultural
 output will exacerbate supply problems.   The result-
 ing imbalance between demand and supply may result
 in price rises as great or greater than the 35 to
 40 percent experienced in 1965.   The inflationary
 impact would be particularly severe in Saigon and
 other areas where  VC.activity and-the US,forc'e
 build-up have been intensified.
 2.   Before 1965,  the inflationary impact of GVN
 budget deficits had been contained by the increasing
 use of money,  instead of barter,  in the rural economy,
 the import of commodities under the AID commercial
 import program and PL-480,  and the willingness of the
 Vietnamese public to hold larger cash balances.   During
 1965, however, major inflationary pressures were un-
 leashed by the conjunction of shortages of goods,  the
 increase in foreign personnel demands for in-country
 goods and services,  and the accelerating increase in
 wages resulting from price rises and declining manpower
 reserves.
 3.   During 1966,  the GVN budget deficit,  even if
 expenditures are limited to the proposed level of 55
 billion piasters,  could rise above the 15-18 billion
 piasters estimated for 1965 to 20 billion piasters or
 more.   US and other foreign troop spending and the
 piaster component of military construction may jump
 from about 10 billion piasters in 1965 to an estimated
 30 billion piasters.   The total of 50-55 billion piasters
 for budget deficit and foreign spending (compared to
 about 29 billion piasters in 1.965)  is equivalent to over
 one-third of all goods and services available in Vietnam
 in 1965,  and is substantially more than the total of the
 present money supply of 42 billion piasters.   Since in-
 flationary pressures will be working against a far

 smaller level of idle resources in the economy,  their
 impact will be more severe and more difficult to comet
 tain than during 1965.   Table 1 shows percentage in-
 creases,  as reported by the Dunkerly mission,  in the
 cost of living and in money supply during the years
 1962-64 and the first three quarters of 1965,

 4.  The major factor restraining inflation has been
 the supply of AID-financed commercial. imports and PL-480
 commodities.   Although the generation of counterpart
 funds from US-financed imports will be increased sub-
 stantially during 1966,  the GVN budget deficit will prob-
 ably increase despite this assistance.   A second factor
 restraining inflation in the past has been the tradi-m
 tional tendency of the Vietnamese to hold a part of
 additional income in the form of money.   If prices ac-
 celerate, money holdings are discouraged. and the demand
 for goods is increased as a consequence.
 5.   The increase of domestic and import commodities
 adequate to satisfy increased demands will be critical
 to maintenance of a measure of economic stability during
 1966.   Inadequate port and transport facilities have

 created serious bottlenecks  in the operations of the
 domestic economy.   There have been major increases in
 internal transport,  warehousing,             and stevedoring costs.
 The major threat from inadequate port; and transport
 facilities is the danger that these will. be unable to
 handle the vol.ume of commercial and military imports es-
 sential to rel.i.eve the burden. on domestic supplies and
 to meet the anticipated demand.
 6.   Specific material resources are expected to be
 in short supply during 1966,   Prices for construction
 materials have increased markedly in 1965,   For example,
 in the past three months, gravel prices have doubled;
 the price of sand has doubled during the last year;
 brick prices are up 75 percent;  and lumber prices have
 also increased substantially,   In general,  any increase
 in demand for construction materials brings about an
 immediate and pronounced response in price with only a
 belated and small response in quantity.   Prices of
 luxury consumer goods and the more expensive food items
 are expected to continue their sharp increases as  the
 result of Local spending by US and other foreign per.-
 sonnel.   These items include meat, seafood,  fresh
 vegetables,  beer, cigarettes,  an.d.high-priced textiles.
 In contrast,  the prices of rice,  fish sauce,  and low-
 priced textiles, which are basic necessities for the
 poorer elements of the Vietnamese population,  have main-
 tained relative price stability;                              this trend is expected
 to continue during 1966,
 7.   Anticipated increases in 1966 US expenditures
 for construction in. Vietnam will have additional reper-
 cussions in the manpower sector of the economy.   Wage
 rates for most categories of skilled construction workers
 have doubl.ed during the last year,   Wages for unskilled
 labor have not increased as sharply but; are estimated
 to have increased by at least; 50 percent in Saigon.
 With the exception of rural  labor in isolated areas,
 Vietnamese manpower resources are now fully empl.oyed,
 8.   Control of the -inflationary threat to economic
 (and hence political) stability during 1966 is clearly
 dependent on US and GVN countermeasures.   For example,
 the US could meet the bulk. of the requirements for
 skilled labor and. critical. commodities needed to expand
 port facilities and for military const;ruc'tion,  from
 sources outside of South Vietnam.  Additional. measures

 to control in-country spending by foreign personnel
 are possible.   Similarly,  new GVN fiscal measures, such
 as sharply increased taxes,  are effective tools in
 soaking up excess purchasing power.   But even under the
 best of circumstances,  the problem is to limit inflation
 to manageable levels in 1966, not to aim for price
 stability.
