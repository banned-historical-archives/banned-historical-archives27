FOREWORD 
This study is a broad historical and 
conceptual examination of economic sanctions 
as an instrument of foreign policy in a variety 
of political settings. Using the full range of 
information available to this Agency, we have 
studied 13 cases of economic sanctions covering 
a representative sample of sanctions sponsors, 
targets and circumstances. Drawing on the 
information in these case studies as well as on 
open literature, we have examined each of the 
elements affecting the formulation and 
implementation of sanctions. The result is a 
framework for understanding the potential and 
limitations of sanctions as a foreign policy 
instrument, which can be used to assess whether 
to impose sanctions as a sponsor and how to 
respond to sanctions as their target.

Summary 
A detailed analysis of 13 applications of economic sanctions yields mixed results 
regarding their effectiveness as instruments of foreign policy. In none of the cases did 
the imposition of economic sanctions force a country to reverse the actions that 
triggered the sanctions. There are two main reasons for this failure. 
o Most economies have sufficient flexibility to mitigate the economic 
impact of sanctions by circumventing them or by making internal 
economic adjustments. 
o Even when the sanctions have substantial economic impact, countries 
have shown a strong and lasting commitment to maintaining their 
present course of conduct. The imposition of sanctions, in many cases, 
has stiffened their resolve. 
The case studies reveal that miscalculation, misunderstanding, or failure to take all of 
their complex elements into account have caused sanctions to fail, sometimes with 
serious economic and political consequences for their sponsor. 
We found, nonetheless, that sanctions can serve several useful purposes: 
o They make the target country pay an economic price, sometimes a high 
one, for its policies. 
o They contribute to its international isolation. 
o They may strengthen the hand of opposition groups within?or outside?
the sanctioned country. 
o For the country imposing sanctions, they provide a policy alternative 
short of military action, satisfy important political constituencies, and 
buy time and  room for diplomatic initiatives and other approaches to 
the problem. 
Whether or not sanctions can be considered effective depends on the objectives 
against which their impact is measured. The unstated objectives often differ from those 
that are stated publicly. In general, sanctions are likely to be more effective when 
judged against objectives of economic punishment or public disapproval rather than 
against the goal of changing the conduct of an offending country. 
Our analysis confirms the complexity of using sanctions as an instrument of 
foreign policy. Key findings in this regard include: 
o There are distinct tradeoffs between unilateral and multilateral 
sanctions. While a single country may have a strong commitment to 
levying sanctions, it is less likely to control the range of goods needed 
to have a significant economic impact on the target. While a group of 
sponsors has the potential ability to economically punish the target 
country, this power is rarely used because of disagreements on sanction 
objectives and a wide range of commitments to the sanctions effort.

o Sanctions often yield unanticipated political and economic results; in 
some cases the sanctions have caused countries to shift alliances or 
their economic and political orientations. 
o Sanctions acquire political significance even when economic effects 
are minimal. Easing the sanctions without some evidence of 
concessions by the offending country may give an impression of 
failure. In any event, it probably will be taken as a signal of a policy 
shift. 
The potential effectiveness of sanctions can be gauged by the close analysis of 
several factors. Most important among these are: 
o The volume and importance of goods that the sponsor country can 
withhold from the offending nation. 
o The impact of the sanctions on the target country's domestic politics 
and international position. 
o The ability of the sanctioned country to adjust economically to the loss 
of commerce. 
o The commitment of the target country to the policies that triggered 
the sanctions. 
o The degree of cooperation the sponsor country can get from other 
nations; reaching agreement on objectives is often difficult and in such 
cases the political cost of getting cooperation from allies can be high. 
o The economic cost of the sanctions to the sponsor country. 
o The ability of the sponsor country to maintain the sanctions over a long 
enough time to have an impact on the offending nation. 
We also found, however, that even the most careful planning process is unlikely to take 
full account of all the political and economic dynamics associated with the use of 
economic sanctions.

ECONOMIC SANCTIONS: AN HISTORICAL 
AND CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS 
Economic Sanctions Defined 
Economic sanctions are non-military actions to deprive a country of something of 
value. They include such measures as restrictions on financial and commercial relations, 
communications, and transportation. Sanctions can be sponsored by a single country, an 
informal grouping of countries, or a multilateral organization. They are normally 
imposed for one or more of the following reasons: 
o To express disapproval of a country's conduct. 
o To punish a country for its conduct. 
o To force a country to change its conduct. 
A detailed examination of 13 economic sanctions cases (see Table 1) indicates that 
economic sanctions can be effective instruments of foreign policy. However, they are 
extremely complex to use. They require careful consideration of: 
o Their announced and hidden objectives. 
o The economic and political ability of the sponsor to withhold something 
of value over time. 
o The ability of a country to go without the restricted commodities. 
o The commitment of the target country to the action that triggered 
sanctions. 
The case studies reveal that miscalculation, misunderstanding, or failure to take all of 
these elements into account have caused sanctions to fail, sometimes with serious 
adverse economic consequences for their sponsor.* 
Sanction Objectives 
In our judgment the effectiveness of an economic sanction must be assessed in 
terms of the objectives of the sponsoring country. According to a review of the 
* To judge the effectiveness of economic sanctions we developed a set of "best case" 
criteria to use as a benchmark. See the Appendix labeled "Effectiveness" for a 
comparison of the 13 case histories with "best case" conditions.

Economic Sanctions Case Histories  
1935-36 League of Nations Sanctions on Italy 
1948-Present Arab League Boycott of Israel 
1960 USSR Sanctions on PRC 
1961-62 OAS/US Sanctions on Dominican Republic

1980-81 US Sanctions on USSR (Afghanistan) 
1982 EC Sanctions on Argentina 
Our analysis of economic sanctions is based in large measure on these 13 case histories. 
We believe that they provide a sufficient analytical base for assessing the effectiveness 
of sanctions because they: 
o Represent the principal categories of sanctions employed in recent 
times. 
o Represent sanctions applied by geographically, ideologically, and 
economically diverse countries. 
o Are well-documented. 
o Raise issues that will probably affect future applications of sanctions.

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/12 : CIA-RDP08501350R000200470001-4 
literature, economic sanctions historically have been viewed as efforts to change a 
country's behavior. This was the stated objective in nine of the 13 case histories included 
in this study. In many instances, however, sanctions have had less ambitious objectives. 
For example, Arab League members have long recognized that the best they can hope for 
by their boycott of Israeli goods and companies doing business with Israel is to inflict 
economic punishment; the boycott will not force Israel to change any of its policies. 
Similarly, according to senior Carter Administration officials, the United States 
recognized that sanctions would not cause the Soviets to withdraw from Afghanistan; 
they were meant to punish the Soviets for their conduct and to let Moscow know the 
price for similar conduct in the future. 
In some cases, the objective may be only to show disapproval of a country's 
conduct. Our examination of European Community sanctions on Argentina during the 
Falldands war indicates that they were primarily intended to symbolize disapproval of 
Argentina's invasion and European Community solidarity with the United Kingdom. 
Sanctions often combine the three objectives and change their relative emphasis 
over time. For example, sanctions by the United States and the Organization of 
American States on Cuba were initially meant to bring down the Castro government. 
However, as time passed the focus shifted to punishing the Cuban government and the 
Soviet Union by making them pay a heavy economic price for their alliance. 
In our judgment, sanctions that either punish or symbolize disapproval have been 
employed in recent years for two reasons: 
o Countries recognize that economic sanctions are unlikely to cause 
sufficient distress to change the conduct of the major powers, and even 
small poor states are usually able to mitigate or withstand their 
impact. 
o Mass communications and diplomacy conducted in international forums 
have placed a greater premium on adherence to universal norms of 
conduct. Sanctions may symbolically note a country's compliance with 
these norms and highlight the deviation of another.

Hidden Objectives  
Critics of the use of economic sanctions often conclude that a sanction failed 
because it did not change the country's conduct or achieve some other stated objective. 
In many cases, however, the true objectives may not have been publicly stated. For 
example, the announced objective of the League of Nations sanctions against Italy was to 
end the war in Ethiopia. But the case history shows that the unstated objective of 
League members was to check Hitler's expansionist plans by demonstrating the 
effectiveness of the League's collective security provisions. Again, according to the case 
history, two unstated objectives of the sanctions on Rhodesia led by the United Kingdom 
were to prevent use of force by other countries and to maintain the United Kingdom's 
"image" in the Commonwealth and Third World. 
We have concluded that unstated objectives present policymakers with both 
advantages and problems. On the positive side unstated objectives allow: 
o Flexibility in determining when sanctions can be removed because 
politically significant elements of the society will not have a basis for 
judging "success" or "failure." 
o A private discussion with the offending country of the true objectives 
of sanctions, permitting it to accede to the sponsor's demands without 
publicly capitulating. 
There are three principal disadvantages, however, to unstated objectives: 
o A country urging a multilateral group to impose sanctions will have a 
more difficult task if it maintains a private agenda. 
o Unstated objectives cannot be kept secret in a multilateral context, 
making a public confrontation with the target country unavoidable. 
o In both unilateral and multilateral situations, sanctions with unstated 
objectives may be more difficult to justify to the people of the 
countries imposing them who bear their costs. 
Establishing and Implementing Sanctions 
We have identified four key elements that are likely to affect a policymaker's 
decision to implement economic sanctions: 
o The kinds of items to be withheld or markets to be boycotted.

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/12 : CIA-RDP08501350R000200470001-4 
o The need and desire for multilateral sponsorship and the willingness of 
other states to participate. 
o The economic and political effects of sanctions on the offending 
country. 
o The degree of the target country's commitment to the action that 
triggered the sanctions and the sponsor country's economic and 
political commitment to the sanctions over time. 
Which of these elements must be considered depends on the goal of the sanction. If the 
objective is to demonstrate disapproval, only the first two are pertinent; punishment, in 
addition to the first two elements, requires assessment of the economic impact, while an 
attempt to change a country's behavior requires consideration of all four elements. 
The Scope of the Sanctions  
The scope of sanctions can vary from a select number of items to a total embargo 
on all commerce with a country. Scope must be considered in qualitative as well as 
quantitative terms; although sanctions may be applied to a limited number of items, 
those few items may be of critical importance. An example of an ideal circumstance for 
sanctions would be a sponsor country that controls all transport routes to and from a 
country. Absent foreign trade, the country would be forced to rely solely on its own 
resources. South Africa is one of the few countries in a position to impose this kind of 
complete sanction on several states such as Lesotho. 
The sanctions analyzed in our case histories range from very broad embargoes ? 
Italy by the League of Nations, Cuba by the United States and the OAS, and Rhodesia by 
the United Kingdom and United Nations ? to more selective applications. Eight of the 
13 cases involved withholding a narrow range of items, such as oil in the Organization of 
Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) embargo on the United States. In two of 
the cases ? Soviet sanctions on the People's Republic of China and US sanctions on 
Pakistan ? the principal item of value withheld was aid. 
In each of the cases we analyzed, the scope of the sanctions was theoretically 
sufficient to cause some economic deprivation. Furthermore, we found the scope of the

ECONOMIC SANCTIONS IN AMERICAN DIPLOMATIC HISTORY 
Economic sanctions have served as a fundamental instrument in the conduct 
of American foreign relations from colonial times to the present. Controversy 
about their effectiveness has lasted as long. 
The passage of the Stamp Act by the British Parliament in 1765 led to the 
first imposition of economic sanctions by Americans. The Stamp Act required the 
affixing of revenue stamps to newspapers, pamphlets, almanacs, legal documents, 
playing cards, and dice. The American colonies reacted to this new tax by calling a 
Stamp Act Congress which, although unofficial, resolved not to import any goods 
which required payment of the tax. The Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 
after petitions by London merchants who complained of injury to English trade 
caused by the effective colonial embargo. 
In 1767, still searching for revenue to pay for administration of the colonies, 
the British imposed duties on tea, glass, painters colors, oil, lead, and paper. The 
Americans refused to import taxed items and, in 1770, the British repealed the 
taxes on all items except tea. In this case, sanctions were a partial success. Three 
years later, residents of Boston imposed a private economic sanction by dumping 
chests of taxed tea into the harbor. 
For the first 50 years of American diplomacy, economic sanctions were 
employed in retaliation for British seizures of American ships and impressment of 
seamen as well as in efforts to protect US shipping from the belligerents in the 
Napoleonic wars. However, these sanctions were not always as effective as the 
pre-revolutionary embargoes on imports. For example, the Non-Intercourse Act of 
1809 closed American ports to French and British ships and outlawed imports from 
those warring nations. However, it was repealed quickly when the loss of customs 
revenues hurt the US Treasury more than the intended targets. 
Between the early 19th and the first quarter of the 20th centuries, economic 
sanctions were employed less frequently than in the first decades of the Republic. 
Secure from serious foreign threats to its existence, the United States turned 
toward the tasks of continental expansion and internal development. From 1825 to 
1935, economic sanctions were employed by both the Federal government and 
Confederate forces during the Civil War and the United States used sanctions 
against several Latin American nations. In the last 50 years, sanctions have 
resumed their prominent place in American diplomacy as the United States first 
tried to avoid entanglement in the Second World War and then assumed worldwide 
leadership after the War's end. In the postwar years, because of the dangers 
inherent in nuclear superpower confrontation, economic sanctions have, in  some 
cases, replaced military action as instruments of foreign policy.

sanctions generally to be in proportion to the perceived seriousness of the "offense." 
That is, the United States and the OAS considered Cuba's move toward Moscow to be a 
very serious offense warranting full-scope sanctions. Algeria's nationalization of several 
French oil companies brought a proportionately less serious response involving an 
embargo on Algerian oil production and purchases of oil by French companies. The case 
studies suggest that, except for sanctions on Cuba and Rhodesia, sanction sponsors did 
not intend to inflict extreme economic damage on the offending countries. In those two 
cases, full-scope sanctions were, in many ways, a prelude to military action. 
Sanction Sponsors  
Sanctions can be sponsored by a group of individuals within a country, a single 
country, an informal group of countries, or a formal multilateral organization. Although 
groups of individuals have sponsored sanctions (for example, US longshoremen's refusal to 
handle goods destined for Iran during the hostage crisis), we did not analyze this category 
because it does not involve official state conduct of foreign relations. 
The principal advantage of a single-country sponsorship is that the country usually 
has authority to enforce its sanctions. However, in the case of sanctions intended to 
change conduct or to punish, a single country is less likely to be able to control enough 
items of value to cause deprivation. If sanctions are a symbol of disapproval, concern 
about actual impact is less and the disadvantage of a single country sponsor is reduced. 
In the Uganda case, the trade embargo was a symbol of US disapproval of Idi Amin's 
bloody rule even though its economic impact was insubstantial. 
Multilateral organizations, informal or formal, have the potential advantage of 
controlling more resources and eliminating more alternate suppliers and markets. 
However, multilateral sanctions are replete with problems: 
o Given widely divergent national economic and political interests, 
reaching a consensus to impose sanctions may be difficult and their 
provisions may be weakened in the process as in the case of the League 
sanctions on Italy or the European community sanctions on Argentina. 
o Lengthy discussions to achieve consensus give the target time to 
adjust, such as Italy did during League debate in 1934 and 1935.

o Alternatively, any country requesting multilateral participation in 
sanctions it has already imposed risks a challenge to the sanctions' 
legitimacy and divisiveness among potential sponsors, both of which 
? work to the advantage of the target country. 
o Even if consensus is reached on imposing sanctions, compliance is not 
assured. The organization must, in the end, rely on enforcement by 
members whose ability and willingness may vary greatly. UN sanctions 
on Rhodesia were flagrantly violated by some members and not 
enforced by others. Similar problems arose in the League of Nations 
case, OAS sanctions on Cuba, and the Arab Boycott of Israel. 
The best case for sanctions by a multilateral organization would be one in which a 
relatively small group of countries with closely convergent interests impose sanctions on 
a target country whose conduct impinged equally on their national interests. The OAPEC 
oil embargo is an example of these circumstances. In theory, the European Community 
and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development should be effective 
sponsors of sanctions under proper conditions. In practice, even industrial countries with 
shared values and many shared national interests have had difficulty imposing effective 
sanctions. 
The Impact of Sanctions 
Sanctions can have economic and political effects on all parties involved as well 
as on countries on the sidelines. The economic impact on the target country can range 
from minor inconvenience to major economic dislocation and will be affected by: 
o Its access to alternate sources of supply or markets. 
o Its ability to adjust internally. 
o The ability of the sponsor country to enforce the sanctions. 
Review of the literature on the subject and the case studies reveals that each of these 
factors has been important in determining the effectiveness of sanctions. 
Alternate Sources of Supply  
In 11 of the 13 cases we analyzed countries were eventually able to secure 
alternate sources of supply or markets. The alternate sources came from ideological or 
strategic foes of the sponsor in the cases of Italy, Cuba, and Rhodesia; and from

opportunistic suppliers in the cases of Israel, the PRC, Algeria, the United States during 
the OAPEC embargo, Uganda, Iran, and the USSR during the Afghanistan-related grain 
embargo. During the short duration of the sanctions on the Dominican Republic, 
alternate suppliers were able to circumvent some of the sanctions by purchasing arms, 
vehicles, and petroleum from Canada, Western Europe, and the Middle East. The EC 
sanctions on Argentina did not deprive Argentina of any commodities, but alternate 
suppliers of most items were available if necessary. 
Even though alternate sources of supply or markets are available, sanctions can 
still have an economic impact. In several instances (the PRC, Cuba, and Rhodesia), there 
was either a time lag between the imposition of sanctions and availability of alternate 
supplies or a high economic or political cost involved in securing the supplies. The 
availability of alternate supplies should not preclude successful application of sanctions. 
However, governments imposing sanctions should recognize that the impact may be 
diminished and that they may have to modify their objectives. 
Ability of the Target to Adjust Internally  
Countries subject to sanctions not only seek alternate supplies of items withheld, 
but they try to adjust internally to the absence of those items. Adjustment can include 
both increased self-sufficiency and a shift in demand away from the embargoed items. 
Rhodesia and Cuba are both examples of countries that adjusted internally. Rhodesia 
became much more self-reliant in manufactured goods during the sanctions. In fact, the 
case study reveals that Rhodesia was so successful at internal adjustment (as well as 
securing alternate sources) that the sanctions left Zimbabwe with a much stronger 
economy than would otherwise have been likely. Moreover, white Rhodesians managed to 
more or less maintain their standard of living during the long sanctions period. Cuba 
shifted from an economy dominated by US capital and consumer goods to an economy in 
which capital is supplied by Eastern Europe and Japan and the supply of consumer goods 
is substantially reduced.

TEXT TABLE  
Provisions  
Cut all trade and 
financial ties with 
Italy. Did not 
Include oil. 
Primary: Bans all 
trade between Arab 
states and Israel. 
Secondary: Bans 
commerce with 
companies that 
contribute signifi-
cantly to Israel's 
economic or military 
strength. Tertiary: 
Sponsors require third-
country firms to refuse 
to use products or services 
of blacklisted companies in 
fulfilling a contract or 
sale. 
Impact  
Few hardships felt by 
Italian people. Unerrploy-
men t declined, fami 1 y 
Income rose during 
sanctions. Little if 
any impact on the Italian 
Government's ability to 
maintain political leader-
ship or on Italy's 
commitment to continue the 
war. 
Until 1975, little 
discernible economic 
Impact. After 1975, 
some foreign firms may 
have decided to forgo 
trade with Israel. 
Cancellation of 
Soviet technical 
assistance and with-
drawal of 2,000 
experts. 
Withdrawal of Soviet 
experts dealt the Chinese 
a heavy blow whose 
effects were felt many 
years afterwards. 
Combined with three years 
of bad harvests and the 
mistakes of the Great Leap 
Forward, sanctions helped 
precipitate a domestic 
crisis in 1960 through 
1962. 
Conclusions  
Failure of these sanctions provides a 
classic damnstrat ion of the problems 
involved in establishing and implementing 
multilateral sanctions. Membership did not 
agree on objectives; sanctions late, 
limited, and incomplete; League did not have 
power to enforce sanctions; and Membership 
did not control critical strategic goods. 
Main achievement of boycott has been the 
symbolic expression of Arab solidarity 
against Israel The boycott sponsors do 
not control the supply of goods Israel 
Imports and do not effectively enforce 
the sanctions. 
Sanctions failed to change Chinese 
ideological or foreign policies. In fact, 
they led to adverse political consequences 
for their sponsor. The Chinese leadership 
was so committed to its ideological break 
with the Soviets and to establishment of its 
own independent foreign policy that it was 
willing to bear the considerable economic and 
political cost of the sanctions. Sanctions 
provided the Chinese with a scapegoat to explain 
economic failures. Chinese adjustment to 
sanctions ultimately left Moscow with limited 
economic means to influence Beijing's behavior. 
The sanctions did punish the Chinese for their 
conduct.

Impact  
Sanctions hit the 
Dominican economy when 
already sagging economic 
performance hampered 
adjustment. The Dominicans 
were able to circumvent 
some of the sanctions by 
purchasing arms, vehicles 
and petroleum. Economic 
deterioration fostered 
political unrest in the 
middle and upper classes, 
the army, and the Catholic 
Church. After Trujillo's 
assassination, the remaining 
family and supporters lost 
control of the government. 
The sanctions significantly 
damaged Cuba's growth and 
general development. The 
sanctions did little to 
weaken Castro's internal 
political position. 
Economic impact affected 
some sectors, notably 
agriculture, more than 
others but generally 
Rhodesia's ability to 
adjust internally 
combined with circum-
vention of the sanctions 
substantially reduced 
economic effects. 
Conclusions 
The sanctions met with considerable success 
in exacerbating deteriorating economic 
conditions and providing fuel for the 
floundering opposition. After Trujillo's 
death, the continuation of sanctions forced 
the Trujillo family and supporters to yield 
control of the government. 
The Castro regime was so committed to its 
revolutionary policies that it was willing 
to bear the considerable cost of sanctions. 
Sanctions provided Castro with a scapegoat 
for domestic problems, which he exploited to 
gain acceptance of radical changes in Cuban 
society. OAS participation did not change 
results. 
Failed to achieve principal objectives 
because they were not fully enforced by 
any of the major implementing parties; 
key supplier, South Africa, flouted 
sanctions; and the Rhodesian economy 
adjusted quite well to the sanctions 
that were enforced. Unintentionally. 
the sanctions left Zimbabwe with a much 
stronger economy than would have otherwise 
been likely.

Impact  
Algerian production 
dropped at least 25 
percent in 1971, but 
impact undermined by 
developments in world oil 
market where rising prices 
enabled the Algerians 
largely to offset the 
losses from production 
cutbacks. 
The sanctions led to wide-
spread fuel shortages in 
the United States and 
other industrial countries 
for a relatively short 
time. The embargo awaken-
ed the United States to the 
costs of importing sub-
stantial amounts of oil 
leading to the beginning 
of major adjustments in 
US domestic and foreign 
policies. The embargo 
had a powerful demonstra-
tion effect on other 
industrial countries that 
were heavy consumers of 
Arab oil; they began to 
voice greater support for 
Arab positions. 
Sanctions did not halt 
Pakistan's efforts to 
develop nuclear weapons 
capability. Economic 
impact was minimal. 
Conclusions 
French companies settled the dispute on 
terms favorable to Algeria. -Sanctions had 
little impact on Algeria because France 
failed to get cooperation of other states; 
market conditions helped Algeria offset 
revenue losses; French commitment was eroded 
because it could not readily replace 
Algerian oil. 
? 25X1 
The United States remained committed to 
its support of Israel. The Arab states 
were not able to control the supply of 
oil to the United States. The United ? 
States was able to adjust to the embargo. 
Yet, the embargo did demonstrate 
opposition to US support of Israel and 
symbolized solidarity with Syria and 
Egypt. 
Pakistan was willing to forgo US aid in 
order to continue its efforts to develop 
nuclear weapons because it perceived nuclear 
weapons as an element vital to its national 
security. Highly visible imposition of 
sanctions increased domestic support for 
the Government of Pakistan policies thus 
easing the political cost of foregone aid. 
The fact that the United States took tangible 
action combined with demarches to other 
countries has caused Islamabad to become 
dependent on the clandestine procurement 
network and has slowed development 
of its nuclear program.

Impact  
Despite its economic 
problems and heavy 
dependence on the US 
market, Uganda suffered 
little from US trade 
sanctions. 
Little impact on Iran's 
ability to procure needed 
imports but did change its 
trading patterns. Iran 
circumvented US and EC 
sanctions on trade. 
Blocking of financial 
assets did not signifi-
cantly worsen economic 
problems. Sanctions, by 
themselves, failed to 
force early release of 
the hostages. 
In 1980 USSR able to 
replace only 9 million 
of 17 million tons of 
grain denied by the 
United States, but the 
impact declined the next 
year as the USSR more 
fully replaced denied 
grain supplies. Some 
delay in Moscow's effort 
to upgrade domestic 
fertilizer industry. 
Retarded some moderniza-
tion programs. Deprived 
Moscow of some prestige 
and propaganda opportuni-
ties from the Olympics. 
No significant economic 
impact. Reduced chance for 
a protracted war against 
Britain. 
? 25X1 
The United States was unable to gain cooper-
ation of other governments in shutting off 
trade, and Uganda was able to find other 
suppliers and buyers. Yet, sanctions 
indirectly changed the Ugandan Government 
because President Nyerere interpreted them 
to mean that the international community 
would not oppose his invasion of Uganda to 
remove Amin by force. 
Impact of sanctions was slight because the 
Iranian economy was already operating far 
below normal and Iran was able to circum-
vent sanctions. Although some allies gave 
tacit approval to the asset freeze, the 
United States failed to have full support of 
allies and full control over embargoed items. 
United States underestimated the strength of 
the commitment of the revolutionary movement 
In Iran and the willingness of Iranians to 
sacrifice for their cause. The sanctions did 
serve the US need to "do something" quickly in 
response to the hostage seizure. 
Illustrates the difficulty of implementing 
economic denial measures on a multilateral 
basis. United States and allies not able to 
control supplies of grain because a major 
exporter refused to participate. Intensity 
of US commitment was affected by domestic 
political considerations. No consensus among 
major sponsors on how to carry out the 
objectives. Sanctions did punish the Soviets 
in some measure. 
The EC sanctions against Argentina are the 
classic case of diplomatic gesture. 
Community demonstrated solidarity at little 
cost.

Enforcement  
The ability to enforce sanctions is critical to their impact. Enforcement is, in 
turn, affected by whether compliance is voluntary or mandatory and can be monitored 
effectively. Compliance with sanctions imposed by a single country is usually mandatory 
for persons in that country. However, even in this case, enforcement may be 
complicated by the existence of corporate subsidiaries outside the jurisdiction of the 
sponsoring country. Current problems of enforcing sanctions relating to the Soviet gas 
pipeline are a clear example of this problem. 
An added problem of enforcement is that persons affected by sanctions may 
challenge them in courts or in legislatures. These challenges, even if not successful, may 
delay implementation of the sanctions and provide the target with time to begin 
adjusting. Delay may also introduce enough doubt about sanctions being sustained that 
their impact is diminished. 
Even if compliance with sanctions is mandatory, the ability to monitor compliance 
depends on: 
o The specific goods or services being withheld. 
o The number and variety of alternate sources of supply. Not only is the 
physical problem of monitoring more difficult, but the incentive to 
break sanctions is greater when there are more suppliers willing to 
violate sanctions in order to gain or to avoid losing a market. 
o The geographic location of the target country. Multiple points of entry 
to surrounding countries are difficult to monitor; transactions with a 
nation surrounded by potential sanctions violators would be more 
difficult to monitor than a country surrounded by sponsors. 
o The target's ability to evade monitoring. Large industrial nations are 
likely to have more effective, means of monitoring sanctions, but 
countries have demonstrated considerable ingenuity in evading 
sanctions. 
o The legal authority and capacity of the sponsor country to monitor. 
If any one of the possible weaknesses of enforcement and monitoring arises, the impact 
of the sanctions will be reduced. Moreover, groups that are bearing the costs of imposing 
sanctions will increase pressure to end them.

The case histories are replete with enforcement and monitoring problems. The 
League of Nations did not have the authority in the Covenant to insure that its own 
members enforced sanctions against Italy. The United Nations, with authority to enforce 
sanctions provided in Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter, was no more successful in 
enforcing its sanctions on Rhodesia. According to the case histories, even the United 
States, with an intense interest, full enforcement authority, and a substantial monitoring 
capability, was unable to prevent US firms from circumventing sanctions on Iran during 
the hostage crisis. 
Commitment 
The success of sanctions in modifying behavior is affected by political as well as 
economic impact. Political impact is difficult to quantify, but is affected by: 
o The absolute severity of the economic impact of sanctions. 
o The distribution of the economic impact among the population. To the 
extent that the burden appears to be equally shared, the prospect of 
maintaining political unity in the face of sanctions is improved. 
o The ability of the government to maintain its leadership despite the 
sanctions.   
In general, the greater a government's commitment to the conduct that triggered 
sanctions, the more likely it will be to bear their cost without modifying the conduct. 
Moreover, its commitment is often solidified because it is being subjected to sanctions. 
One author notes that the theory underlying the use of economic sanctions 
"...disregards the simple .principle of adaptation: that which seems 
unacceptable at, the beginning of. the conflict becomes acceptable as one 
gets kised to life under hardship...value-deprivation creates the social 
conditions wider which much more sacrifice is possible  so that the limit for 
political disintegration will be reached much later...." 
The Chinese, Cuban, and Rhodesian cases are all examples of a high degree of 
commitment. 
o The Chinese continued their ideological and economic split with 
Moscow despite the high initial cost of Soviet sanctions.

o The Cubans not only continued but intensified their initial conduct; as 
the impact of sanctions diminished because of Soviet help, Cuba 
became more irritating to the United States and other OAS members 
by its efforts to export revolution and by acting as Soviet surrogates in 
Africa. 
o The Rhodesians remained committed to preserving minority rule and 
minority economic advantages until civil war forced a change. 
Countries imposing sanctions do not usually benefit from such a unity of purpose. 
Their commitment is affected by: 
o The importance the population attaches to the objective of the 
sanctions and their willingness to bear the economic costs. 
o The willingness of the government to incur the political costs of 
sanctions. 
o The willingness of allies to share the cost of multilateral sanctions. 
In the likely event of problems with any one of these elements, commitment will be 
reduced and the sanctions will probably not be sustained. 
Review of the literature and case histories indicates that targets ? for the 
reasons described above ? are far more likely to be committed to their course of 
conduct than sponsors are to be committed to sanctions. This difference in commitment 
combined with the fact that sanctions often do not have the impact intended provides a 
concise reason for the failure of many economic sanctions. 
Unintended Results 
We found that economic sanctions can lead to unintended results. Given the 
current degree of international economic interdependence, economic sanctions often 
affect not only the countries directly involved but other nations as well. For example, 
the sanctions on Rhodesia had an unintended negative impact on Zambia because of 
disruptions in critical oil supplies and local trade and had an unintended positive impact 
on South Africa which became a principal supplier and transshipper of goods bound for 
Rhodesia. Moreover, political confrontation between sponsor and target can cause 
dramatic, unforeseen, and unintended changes in the latter's foreign policy. The case 
history of Soviet sanctions on the PRC provides a clear example of unintended political

consequences. Soviet sanctions were intended to reassert Soviet foreign policy and 
ideological leadership over the PRC. However, the result of the sanctions was to reduce 
substantially Soviet participation in Chinese development and its attendant political 
leverage. Furthermore, the sanctions were one of the reasons that the PRC turned to 
the West for technology and capital. In the case of Cuba, US sanctions left Castro with 
the choice of either yielding or reorienting the Cuban economy toward the Soviet Union; 
he chose the latter. 
Conclusions 
Sanctions have achieved some of their objectives in several of the cases we 
analyzed for this study. However, in none did sanctions, by themselves, change the 
conduct of the target country. Of the three sanctions objectives, changing conduct is the 
most difficult to achieve. Sanctions rarely have sufficient impact to induce change and, 
even in the face of economic hardship, governments have been committed enough to the 
course of conduct that triggered sanctions to bear the burden. Countries subjected to 
sanctions, as well as to military action, have demonstrated a substantial ability to adjust 
to deprivation. The ability to adjust must be taken into account when determining the 
objectives of sanctions. 
Sanctions are more likely to achieve objectives relating to punishment or symbolic 
disapproval. In these cases response from the target country matters little and there is 
less cost to the sponsor. However, these two objectives may be more difficult to sustain 
because people in countries imposing sanctions may be less willing to bear even a small 
cost in order to achieve a "symbolic" victory. 
Whatever the objective of sanctions, the literature and case histories clearly 
indicate the extraordinary complexity involved in their implementation. All components 
of the sanctions must function effectively or their impact is seriously diminished. The 
advantage lies with the target country, which has every incentive to attempt to avoid the 
impact of sanctions through evasion or adjustment. Moreover, the existence of multiple 
sources of supplies or markets controlled by countries or private individuals with political

or economic reasons to break the sanctions provides many ways to avoid the economic 
impact. 
We believe that a thorough examination of key factors in the sanctions process 
and a comparison with the objectives, can serve as a guide to the likely outcome of the 
use of an economic sanction. This approach was validated by analyzing the 13 cases in 
our study. Even the most careful planning, however, cannot take full account of the 
political and economic dynamics associated with the use of sanctions because their 
outcome frequently can be influenced by unforeseen events.

LEAGUE OF NATIONS SANCTIONS ON ITALY (1935-1936) 
qackground to the Sanctions  
Immediately following Italy's invasion in October of 1935, Ethiopia appealed to the 
Council of the League under provisions of its Covenant, which declared any war or threat 
of war a matter of concern to the whole League. The League Council Committee of Six 
reported that Italy had resorted to war in violation of League obligations to submit 
disputes to arbitration or judicial settlement. The adoption of this report by the Council 
was the signal for the automatic application of sanctions under the provisions of Article 
16.1 of the Covenant: 
Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of 
its covenants under Articles 12, 13, or 15, it shall im facto be 
deemed to have committed an act of war against all other 
members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to 
subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the 
prohibition of all intercourse between the nations of the 
covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other  State, 
whether a Member of the League or not. 
Provisions of the Sanctions  
The sanctions imposed by the League on Italy were not nearly as stringent as 
Article 1R mandated. The League adopted four economic sanctions effective November 
18, 1935: 
o The prohibition of the export of arms, ammunition, and implements of 
war. 
o An embargo on certain agricultural and key mineral exports to Italy. 
o The prohibition of loans, credits, and some other capital flows to public 
and private entities in Italian territory. 
o An embargo on imports of Italian goods. 
In November, the League submitted to member governments an additional proposal that 
extended the sanctions to petroleum, iron and steel (including alloy steels), and coal and

coke. These later measures were never adopted; therefore, the scope of the sanctions 
did not include commodities critical to Italy's war effort. 
Not only was the scope of sanctions limited, but the League did not have the legal 
power to enforce members' compliance with sanctions. Furthermore, at the time the 
initial sanctions were imposed, the 54-nation League did not include Germany or the 
United States, major suppliers of arms and oil to Italy. 
Objectives of the Sanctions  
The League of Nations sanctions against Italy are a good example of a case where 
the stated and unstated objectives differed considerably. The announced objective of the 
League's sanctions was "....to make the war so costly for Italy that a 'reasonable' solution 
could be evolved. The (member) nations were prepared to be modest in their definition 
of their 'reasonable' aims. Ethiopia, like Czechoslovakia at Munich, was expected to do 
most of the yielding." * 
The publicly stated objective for the League's action may not have been 
paramount in this sanctions case. According to several academic studies, the League 
intended the sanctions to inhibit Hitler's expansionist plans by demonstrating that the 
collective security concept of the League could work in Europe where it had failed in 
Manchuria. The Italian invasion of Ethiopia occurred against a background of rising 
tensions in Europe created by a resurgent and expansionist Germany and Italy's search for 
its place in the sun. The sanctions thus became 
enforcement powers of the League of Nations. 
Given the specific provisions of the sanctions, 
a principal test of the peace 
however, the prospects for 
influencing the behavior of either Mussolini or Hitler were not favorable. The two

principal powers in the League ? France and the United Kingdom ? did not intend the 
sanctions to undermine seriously Italy's warmaking capacity. Although the Italian war 
effort was vulnerable to a cutoff of strategic materials, the British and the French did 
not want to impose stringent sanctions that would push Mussolini too far toward war with 
them or toward alliance with Hitler.* 
"Much of this was well known to Mussolini. Italian diplomacy made 
excellent use of this desire to avoid war. At several critical times the 
Rritish and French turned aside from imposing increasingly harsher terms 
of sanctions in response to threats that Italy would assume belligerent 
rites.**" 
Compliance with the Sanctions  
Not only was the scope of the sanctions limited, but compliance by members and 
non-members was incomplete. Four members of the League refused to apply any 
sanctions. The embargo on arms was not applied by seven members. Financial 
restrictions were not adopted by eight countries. Finally, 13 countries failed to prohibit 
imports from Italy. One author has noted, 
"The belated and partial restrictions adopted did? not interfere at all 
seriously with Italy's war-making potential or even with the comfort of her 
population. Italy had been able to build significant stockpiles of many 
essential products in the period from December, 1934, to September 1935, 
while her intentions grew ever clearer. She was able to continue this 
process for at least a month and a half after the invasion, since, for 
coordination purposes, the effective date for many sanctions measures was 
November 18. The failure to ban important items, such as petroleum, and 
the failure to cut off shipments of banned items from non-members and 
even from members permitted Italian industry to function at high levels." 
Impact of the Sanctions 
_ 
Analysts of the League's sanctions against Italy generally conclude that the 
measures had little, if any, impact on the Italian Government's ability to maintain

political leadership or on Italy's national unity and commitment to continue the war 
against Ethiopia. 
"With the measures of control over trade and over the economy which were 
adopted or strengthened, few of the hardships envisioned by the advocates 
of economic sanctions were in fact felt by the Italian people. Indeed, the 
build-up and war periods saw a substantial decline in Italy's unemployment 
problem. While wages rose little or not at all, many families saw over-all 
income rise as more members went to work or received Army pay.*" 
In fact, analysts believe that Mussolini was able to turn international opprobrium 
into a tool for uniting the Italian people behind the Fascists in defiance of the 
League.** Whether full application of sanctions over a long period of time would have 
affected Mussolini became an academic question after Italy's conquest of Ethiopia and 
the League's failure to extend sanctions to the point where concessions would have been 
forthcoming.*** 
Results of the Sanctions  
The League of Nations failed to achieve even its stated objectives against Italy. 
Although collective action by the League was imposed for six months, the sanctions 
failed to make the war so costly for Italy that it would be forced to resolve the conflict 
by negotiation. More important, in the long run, failure to apply Article 16 fully, coupled 
with serious problems of implementation of the sanctions due to French and British 
concerns about alienating Mussolini, and to circumvention by members and non members, 
provided a strong indication to Hitler that the League would not likely impose collective 
security measures against expansion of the Third Reich.****

Historically, the focus of attention has been on the lack of will of the League 
members to invoke the collective security concept of the League to check Mussolini and 
to serve as a demonstration to Hitler. However, the fact is that even if Article 16 of the 
Covenant had been fully invoked and even if all members of the League had complied 
with the full sanctions, non-member Germany was willing to provide Mussolini with arms 
required to continue the war and the non-member United States was willing to provide 
the oil Furthermore, Ethiopia's inability to resist any army equipped with modern 
weapons, including gas, severely limited the time available for even fully implemented 
sanctions to have an impact on Italian military operations or to have a significant enough 
impact on the Italian economy to give the political leadership pause in its prosecution of 
the war. 
Conclusion  
Failure of the League's sanctions provides a classic demonstration of the problems 
involved in establishing and implementing effective sanctions through a multilateral 
organization. 
o The membership of the League did not agree on objectives; sanctions 
were late, limited, and incomplete. 
o The League did not have the power to enforce sanctions; therefore, 
League members violated them as their individual national interests 
required. 
o The membership of the League did not control the supply of value to he 
withheld by the sanctions; therefore, Italy was able to purchase 
essential strategic goods. 
o Italy was able to adjust to the limited restrictions by stockpiling 
commodities, invoking firm measures of economic control, and utilizing 
idle resources.

ARAB LEAGUE BOYCOTT OF ISRAEL (1948-Present) 
Background to the Sanctions  
The Arab boycott of the Jewish community in Palestine predates the formal 
establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. In December 1945 the Arab League Council 
called on all Arabs "to refuse to deal in, distribute, or consume Zionist products or 
manufactured goods." Even before the boycott, many Arab individuals and groups 
shunned Jewish businesses in Palestine. 
Before 1950 the boycott attempted only to keep Israeli goods out of Arab 
countries. In that year the boycott was extended to include third-party shipping in an 
effort to slow trade into and out of Israel. The Arab League Council decided that any 
ship carrying military equipment or immigrants to Israel would be barred from Arab 
ports. In the early 19508 the Council also recommended extending the boycott to foreign 
firms with branches in Israel. 
The Arab boycott is administered by a Central Boycott Office (CBO) 
headquartered in Syria and national boycott offices in each Arab country. The sponsoring 
Arab League had seven members initially?Syria, Trans-Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, 
Lebanon, Egypt, and Yemen?but has since grown to 21 active members. Each member 
of the League appoints a representative to a central boycott committee which usually 
meets semiannually. The committee recommends the addition or deletion of firms to the 
blacklist, but its decisions are not binding. Each Arab country decides whether to accept 
the decisions of the committee. Each country, therefore, maintains its own blacklist, 
and the various country lists are not uniform. 
Objectives of the Boycott  
The boycott's stated goal is to hinder the economic and military growth of Israel. 
Beyond that, however, the boycott serves as a sign of opposition to Israel and a useful

propaganda device. In a recent press interview, CBO Secretary General Nurallah 
Nurallah claimed that the boycott is "the only effective Arab measure against Israel." 
One scholar has observed that "perhaps one of the principal benefits of the boycott 
program, in Arab League eyes, is that it keeps the issue of Israel constantly before the 
Arab people." 
The Arab League does not distinguish among the various types of boycott it 
administers, but the world business community generally differentiates among three 
types of boycott action. The primary boycott bans all direct trade between Arab states 
and Israel. Until the United States enacted strict antiboycott legislation in 1977, the 
primary ban was most commonly enforced by a negative certificate of origin?a trade 
document certifying that the goods in question are not made in Israel and do not contain 
Israeli-made components. After the United States forbade US firms from supplying 
negative certificates, most Arab states came to accept a positive certificate of origin 
that indicates where the product and its components were manufactured and the name of 
the manufacturer. 
The secondary boycott, instituted in the early 1950s, bans commerce with 
companies that contribute significantly to Israel's economic or military strength. A firm 
is blacklisted if. it: 
o Has a plant, branch, licensee, or regional agent for the Middle East in 
IsraeL 
o Is a partner in any Israeli company. 
o Advises Israeli manufacturers. 
o Acts as agent or principal importer for any Israeli firm. 
o Prospects for natural resources in Israel. 
Although boycott officials periodically insist publicly and privately that only firms adding 
to Israel's strength are blacklisted, the contributions of many boycotted companies are 
difficult to discern. The Topps Chewing Gum Company, for example, was blacklisted 
after it licensed an Israeli factory to produce Bazooka bubble gum.

Firms suspected of proscribed activity in Israel are usually confronted with a 
questionnaire asking if they are engaged in forbidden practices. If a firm responds 
positively or refuses to reply to a questionnaire, it may be blacklisted. US firms are 
prohibited from responding to boycott questionnaires under the 1977 antiboycott 
legislation. The law also requires US companies to report the receipt of questionnaires 
to the US Department of Commerce. In late 1979 the deputy secretary general of the 
C130 stated that since US antibovcott laws took effect, 90 percent of all US companies 
blacklisted were boycotted for failing to respond to boycott office questionnaires. 
In a form of extended secondary boycott, boycotting countries require third-
country firms to refuse to use products or services of blacklisted companies in fulfilling a 
contract or sale to enforcing countries. A clause requiring such a refusal sometimes 
appears as a contract condition. This requirement has been labeled a tertiary boycott in 
the United States. It is especially prevalent in international banking. As Arab financial 
institutions have come to play an increased role as lenders to corporate and government 
borrowers, some borrowers have been pressured to refrain from dealing with blacklisted 
banks or other institutions with alleged "Zionist" connections. Three Arab banks, for 
example, recently withdrew as co-managers of a $2 billion loan for the Mexican state oil 
company after blacklisted banks were included in the management syndicate. 
Rnforcement of the Boycott  
Numerous exceptions made by Arab states to the boycott principles detract from 
their goal of preventing certain types of commerce with Israel. Some Arab League 
members have criticized the central boycott bureaucracy itself. After the boycott-
committee went through all of 1.978 without meeting, the League commissioned an 
investigation of charges by some members that the C130 is ineffective. A report written 
by the Arab League's then-assistant secretary general accused the C130 of inflating its 
performance.

The threat of loss of business in the Arab world is the only tool the Arab League 
has to enforce its secondary boycott. Therefore, companies that conduct a relatively 
small share of their business with Arab countries are less vulnerable to boycott 
pressure. 
Even countries that strictly enforce the boycott have overlooked regulations and 
dealt with blacklisted firms when they believed it was important to their economic 
development or national security. Iraq, for example, bought buses from British Leyland 
while the company was on the blacklist. If goods or services are only available through a 
few exporters, exceptions are made. The boycott also may be ignored if a blacklisted 
firm is the only source for necessary spare parts. The former head of the US Commerce 
Department's Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance said in 1981, "If they want the goods, 
Arab countries will accommodate themselves..., by and large an arrangement can be 
made." 
Military equipment is usually exempted from boycott requirements since 
government-to-government sales are not subject to the boycott. Despite the principle of 
blacklisting any company contributing to Israel's military strength, Arab governments 
regularly put their own national security interests ahead of boycott rules. Still, the 
"General Principles for the Boycott of Israel" recommend that importing countries 
examine Israel's connections with arms manufacturers. 
The boycott office excepts from boycott rules any international banking 
institution from which the Arabs derive greater benefit than Israel regardless of the 
extent of the bank's relationship with Israel. A commercial bank will not be blacklisted 
-
for dealing with Israel if boycott officials have evidence that the bank has loaned more 
money to Arabs than to Israelis. 
In the same vein, some Arab countries have told corporations investing in Israel 
that they would not be blacklisted if they made an equal or greater investment in an 
Arab country.

Many large firms and banks, therefore, have found that they can deal 
with both Arab states and Israel because the Arabs consider their products or capital 
resources indispensable. 
Implementation of the boycott varies from country to country. Iraq, Syria, Libya, 
and Kuwait are considered by most observers to be among the strictest states. Morocco, 
Tunisia, Sudan, Somalia, Mauritania, and Algeria do not enforce the secondary boycott. 
Egypt ended its participation in the boycott as part of its peace treaty with Israel. 
Iraq and Libya are among the most inflexible enforcers of the boycott, but they 
will make exceptions for products or services that cannot be matched elsewhere, 
especially items for the petroleum industry. Before the US embargo on Libyan 
Petroleum-related services and equipment in 1981, Tripoli would allow boycott language 
acceptable to US authorities in letters of credit for goods that could not be found outside 
the United States. 
Oman, at the other extreme, is an unenthusiastic participant in the boycott. 
Muscat's practice has been to pay lip service to CBO directives and interpret them in a 
liberal fashion or ignore them entirely. 
Impact of the Boycott  
Until the mid-1970s the Israeli Government for the most part was quiet about the 
boycott, fearing that publicity would only remind the business community of its 
existence. Israel's concern about the boycott before the increase in Arab economic 
power in 1.973 was so slight that it abolished its small antibovcott office in 1971. In 
1975, however, Israel reestablished an antibovcott unit. Still, Israeli Government 
officials have differed in tone on the boycott, stressing its negative aspects when talking 
to US officials but playing it down to potential investors. Israeli officials have 
acknowledged that foreign firms are able to continue doing business with Israel through 
various means such as dealing through separate companies or subsidiaries or simply

ignoring the boycott. Although some firms may decide to forgo trade with Israel because 
of boycott considerations, alternative sources of supply are usually available. 
The imoact of the boycott on Israers economy is difficult to measure, but we 
believe it was a factor in the drop in foreign investment in Israel from a high of $185 
million in 1973 to $86 million last year after net disinvestment of $1 million in 1980. 
Although Israel touts its free trade access to the EC as an attraction to investors, many 
probably locate in EC countries to avoid boycott problems. The boycott, however, is only 
one of the reasons for the decline in investment. Triple-digit inflation and a strong trade 
union movement discourage many investors. 
The economic impact on the sponsoring Arab states is diluted considerably by 
their failure to implement the boycott stringently. If the Arab states adhered vigorously 
to their boycott principles, they might deny themselves access to necessary inputs or 
best suppliers. 
In the long term, Arab countries' implementation of the boycott is likely to be 
marked by continued self-interest, with exceptions to boycott regulations common when 
they serve a particular nation's purpose. Therefore, its impact on Israel, the Arab states, 
and third-country businesses will continue to be limited. 
Conclusions  
The Arab boycott of Israel has few of the elements necessary for successful 
sanctions. Its main achievement has been the symbolic expression of Arab solidarity 
against Israel. 
o The Arab states do not control the supply of goods Israel imports. 
o The boycott is not mandatory for members of the Arab League. 
o The degree of enforcement varies widely, in part because of the 
potential detrimental impact on the Arab states themselves. US 
antiboycott legislation has complicated the enforcement effort. 
o The political and economic impact of the boycott on Israel has been 
small.

USSR SANCTIONS ON PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (1960) 
Background to the Sanctions  
The decision by the USSR in August 1960 to abruptly cancel its technical 
assistance and withdraw its economic experts from China was a dramatic reminder that 
Soviet aid entails a heavy political price. In the early 1950s, China had felt compelled to 
pay this price of subservience to Soviet national interests and Soviet leadership of the 
Communist world in order to enjoy the strategic and economic benefits of the Sino-
Soviet alliance. By the mid-1950s, however, as China began to stand on its own feet, 
differences over a broad spectrum of political, military, economic, and ideological 
questions began to undermine Sino-Soviet relations. 
Faced with an increasingly independent China, Soviet policy vacillated. In 
agreeing in 1957 to assist China in the development of an advanced weapons program, the 
USSR sought to persuade the Chinese leadership to subordinate their political ambitions 
in the interests of becoming a great military power. But when in 1958 the Maoist 
leadership in quick succession claimed to have discovered a new road to economic 
development (the Great Leap Forward) and a short cut to the ultimate Communist 
society (the People's Commune) and then precipitated the Taiwan Straits crisis, 
Khrushchev turned increasingly to threats and sanctions in order to secure compliance 
from China. In June 1959, for example, both as a penalty for past behavior and a threat 
for the future, Khrushchev formally abrogated the Soviet commitment to assist China in 
the development of nuclear weapons. 
With the publication of the polemical Lenin Anniversary pronouncements in April 
1960, the Chinese issued an unmistakable challenge to Soviet ideological and political 
leadership of the international Communist movement. The Soviets responded at a bloc 
conference in June by circulating a long letter denouncing the Chinese and threatening to

reduce aid unless China backed down. When Khrushchev then attacked Mao for being as 
vain and isolated from reality as Stalin had been and the Chinese delegate responded in 
kind, including a personal attack on Khrushchev for having "betrayed" Marxism-Leninism, 
the moment of truth had arrived. 
Objective of the sanctions  
The purposes for which the USSR imposed economic sanctions against China in 
mid-1960 were never clearly defined. Crude and self-defeating as it may seem in 
retrospect, Soviet strategy appears to have been to give China a foretaste of the even 
more unpleasant consequences that would ensue if Beijing persisted in challenging Soviet 
leadership and Soviet doctrine. The Soviet Union may also have hoped to take advantage 
of China's economic dislocation?the result of the Great Leap Forward and a succession 
of bad harvests?to strengthen the hand of the moderate opposition within the Chinese 
Communist Party to Mao's radical policies. 
Having threatened in an international Communist forum to reduce aid unless 
China retreated, the Soviets may have felt compelled to act when it became evident the 
Chinese would not back down. Since the objective of the sanctions was not made clear, 
it was interoreted by the Chinese as an attempt to force the replacement of Mao Zedong 
as leader of the CCP or at least repudiation of his policies. 
Description of the Sanctions  
The USSR inflicted a heavy blow upon the Chinese economy in August 1960 when 
it abruptly canceled Soviet technical assistance and withdrew some 2,000 experts. Soviet 
aid projects (some 300, including those supplied by East European countries) constituted 
the very heart of China's industrialization program. Practically all the basic plans for 
industrial development?for example, the construction of new steel complexes, the 
building of new power plants, the development of railways, and the installation of new 
chemical plants and oil refineries ? were predicated on these projects. 
Although perhaps one-half of these were fully or partly completed and in

operation by mid-1960, the whole program was undercut by the sudden withdrawal of 
Soviet technicians who took the blueprints for plant installation back with them. While 
Sino-Soviet trade continued, equipment on order and arriving from the Soviet Union could 
not be installed and began to pile up on railway sidings, in warehouses, and in half-
completed factories. 
Although the Soviets threatened a more drastic cessation of aid, they did not cut 
off trade, even in such strategic commodities as petroleum (for which China was then 
heavily dependent on the USSR) and spare parts for China's industry, including military 
industry. Indeed, it was the Chinese who took the initiative in the fall of 1960 in cutting 
back on trade by phasing out the importation of Soviet complete plants and equipment. 
Factors Affecting Success or Failure  
The Soviet Union could only prevent the supply of experts and technical assistance 
to China from socialist bloc countries. As a result of the Korean War and the associated 
US and allied trade embargoes, however, in 1960 China could not obtain many types of 
machinery, equipment, and complete plant installations from any other source. The same 
applied to technical assistance. 
Within three months, however, the Soviet government had second thoughts and 
offered to send "any number" of Soviet experts back to China. This reversal was 
apparently prompted by the belated realization that, by pulling the experts out, the USSR 
had deprived itself of the chief remaining instrument through which it might retain some 
leverage or influence on the Chinese leadership and policy. The Soviets also apparently 
had some forebodings of the enormity of the consequences, which were to greatly 
accelerate the process of separating the Soviet and Chinese economies and societies. 
The economic cost of the sanctions to China is difficult to assess. There is no 
question that the withdrawal of Soviet experts dealt the Chinese economy a heavy blow 
whose effects were felt many years afterwards. Combined with three years of bad

harvests and the mistakes of the Great Leap Forward, it helped precipitate a domestic 
crisis in the years 1960-62, which for a time appeared to imperil the very existence of 
the Beijing regime. Although industrial production plummeted, the basic cause of this 
crisis was a severe shortage of food reaching famine proportions (the Chinese have 
admitted a famine death toll in excess of 10 million at this time) in the disaster areas of 
25X1 
disowned and overthrown by the Soviet people. 25X1 
Results of the Sanctions  
Throughout the three-year "time of troubles" from 1960-1962, there was 
continuing controversy within China's leadership over the proper response to Soviet 
economic pressures. Alternating between defiance and at least tactical accommodation, 
the varying character of this response appeared to reflect fluctuating leadership 
assessments of the gravity of China's domestic crisis. 
_ 
East and North China. Paradoxically, as the crisis deepened and the Chinese 
restructured their economy to give priority to agriculture and maintaining subsistence 
levels of food consumption, there was progressively less need for Soviet experts and 
technical assistance for China's industry. 
Finally, the political consequences of the-Soviet application of economic sanctions 
against China were counterproductive. Instead of undermining the Maoist leadership, 
Soviet sanctions were exploited by the Chinese as a scapegoat for the regime's economic 
failures. A nationwide campaign criticizing Khrushchev and the Soviet Union was 
organized in discussion groups extending down to the primary school level. The Chinese 
charged the Soviet leader with precipitating China's industrial slowdown (by withdrawing 
Soviet technicians); aggravating China's food crisis (by insisting on debt repayment via 
expanded Chinese exports of foodstuffs); and attempting to subvert and subdue the 
Chinese government (by applying economic pressures). To top it off, the Chinese 
propagandists heaped personal abuse on the Soviet leader (employing such epithets as 
tipig,11 
"donkey," "coward," and "turncoat") and predicted that eventually he would be

25X1 
Confronted with famine, popular uprisings, and the threat of disaffection in the 
Army, the Chinese responded favorably to the Soviet offer to negotiate a new aid and 
trade agreement in November 1960 and, throughout the ensuing protracted negotiations, 
ceased polemics and even made a number of conciliatory gestures toward the Soviet 
Union. But the help which China had hoped to obtain?principally, 5 million tons of 
grain?was not forthcoming. Moscow's refusal of Beijing's request at a time of desperate 
need further embittered the Chinese. 
After a further period of tactical accommodation in the spring and summer of 
1962 (this time prompted by concern over the threat of an American-supported Chinese 
Nationalist invasion), the Maoist leadership then decided in the fall of 1962 to launch an 
all-out struggle against the "modern revisionist" leadership of the Soviet Union. The 
following year, the Chinese began to orient their economy more and more toward the 
West and Japan. The large capitalist industrial states increasingly took over from the 
Soviet Union the bulk of China's annual foreign trade (see figure). Moreover, as the 
Chinese emerged from their economic depression, they began placing in the West long 
term orders for complete plant deliveries of the type the Soviets had made .to China in 
the past. 
Instead of bringing the Chinese to their knees, the final outcome of the Soviet 
decision in mid-1960 to impose economic sanctions on China was to bring to an end the 
central role the USSR had played in China's modernization and to reorient the Chinese 
economy toward the capitalist West. 
Conclusions  
The USSR's cutoff of aid to China is a case where sanctions not only failed to 
achieve their objectives but led to adverse political consequences for their sponsor. 
o The Chinese leadership was so committed to its ideological break with 
the Soviet Union and to establishment of its own independent 
development and foreign policy courses that it was willing to bear the 
considerable economic and political cost of the sanctions.

OAS/US SANCTIONS ON DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (1961-62) 
Background to the Sanctions  
For 31 years, the Dominican Republic was ruled by what some academics have 
called the most absolute dictatorship ever established in Latin America. General Rafael 
Trujillo began in 1930 to build' a power base through control?by strong-arm tactics and 
bribery?of both the armed forces and the political apparatus as well as of the national 
economy. The Trujillo family controlled over half the arable land and four-fifths of the 
capital city's businesses, thereby employing three-fourths of the nations' labor force. 
By the late 1950s, however, international and domestic forces combined to 
undermine Trujillo. Regional sentiment against dictators mounted with the fall of other 
such Latin American strongmen as Juan Peron of Argentina in 1955, Marcos Perez 
Jimenez of Venezuela in 1958, and Fulgencio Batista of Cuba in 1959. Adding to the 
sentiment against Trujillo was the publicity over his allegedly ordering the execution of a 
political opponent and his American pilot in 1956. Meanwhile, Washington was becoming 
increasingly aware of the growing anti-US sentiment in Latin America which was 
highlighted by Vice-President Nixon's unfriendly reception in Peru and Venezuela in 
1958. As a result, the Eisenhower administration reevaluated its policies toward Latin 
America and began withdrawing support from the Trujillo regime, including cancellation 
of arms trade agreements. 
Pressure against the Trujillo regime intensified in February 1959 when Romulo 
Betancourt?an outspoken critic of Trujillo?took office as the President of Venezuela. 
In June 1959, Dominican exiles launched an unsuccessful invasion that Trujillo believed 
was Venezuelan-backed. Trujillo lashed out with unprecedented violence against the 
exiles and their supporters in the Dominican Republic. Pressed by Venezuela, the OAS' 
Inter-American Peace Committee accused the Dominican Republic of "flagrant and

widespread violation of human rights" including the "denial of free assembly and of free 
speech, arbitrary arrests, cruel and inhuman treatment of political prisoners and the use 
of terror and intimidation as political weapons." In retaliation for Betancourt's continued 
verbal attacks on Trujillo and for alleged Venezuelan assistance in the June invasion, 
Trujillo launched his third and nearly successful assassination attempt on the Venezuelan 
president. 
OAS and US Sanctions  
Dominican aggression against Venezuela caused the OAS to initiate sanctions. In 
January 1901, the members voted to: 
o Break diplomatic relations with the Dominican Republic. 
o Partially interrupt economic relations with the Dominican Republic, 
beginning with the immediate suspension of trade in arms and 
implements of war of every kind. 
These sanctions were later expanded to include trade in petroleum, petroleum products, 
trucks, spare parts and other commodities. 
The United States initially objected to the sanctions, fearing that they would lead 
to Trujillo's overthrow and his replacement with a pro-Castro leader. Washington argued 
that the OAS should persuade the Dominican Republic to become more democratic and 
hold free elections under international supervision. With the other members clearly 
opposed to the US approach, and in hopes that the OAS would condemn Cuba in the 
future, Washington decided to approve OAS sanctions. In addition to OAS sanctions, the 
United States cut back import quotas for Dominican sugar. 
The US-supported sanctions, officially imposed to punish Dominican participation 
in the Retancourt assassination attempt, were in our judgment constructed so as to force 
political liberalization of the Trujillo regime or an end to Trujillo's rule. After Trujillo's 
death, the sanctions were used as a tool to rid the Dominican Republic of the Trujillo 
family, prevent a right-wing coup, and to press for democratic elections. 
The sanctions hit the Dominican economy when already sagging economic

performance hampered adjustment and the Trujillo regime had turned its attention to 
survivaL Real GDP growth, which had averaged 7 percent annually in 1953-58, had fallen 
to only 1 percent in 1q59-60 as massive capital flight cut imports sharply. In 1960, 
foreign exchange revenues were drawn down by nearly half to $15 million. Moreover, 
two-thirds of public expenditures were allocated for defense. In 1961, the sanctions 
worsened the economic crisis. 
o A shipping crisis occurred when Venezuela refused to admit ships that 
had docked in the Dominican Republic and the international seamen's 
and longshoremen's unions stopped loading ships bound for the country. 
o Oil shortages developed when the Netherlands Antilles halted 
shipments of refined petroleum and Shell Oil temporarily suspended 
sales in response to pressure from Venezuela. 
o Export earnings in 1961 were cut 21 percent, and imports fell another 
20 percent in nominal terms. 
The Dominicans were able to circumvent some of the sanctions by purchasing arms, 
vehicles, and petroleum ? albeit at higher cost ? from Canada, Western. Europe, and the 
Middle East. Trujillo also managed to ship coffee to the United States disguised in 
Colombian bags, and he planned to build a Dominican refinery with French and US 
contractors. 
Roueezed by the growing crisis, Trujillo raised taxes, slashed public employee 
salaries, cut bonuses, and increased commissions to government officials on all business 
transactions. He also used the sanctions as a basis for anti-US propaganda and opened 
diplomatic and commercial relations with the USSR and Eastern Europe. In these 
circumstances, investor confidence remained in the depths. Economic activity fell 2,2 
percent in 1961, and unemployment rose sharply. 
The economic deterioration fostered political unrest in the middle and upper 
classes, the army?traditional Trujillo supporters?and the Catholic Church. The regime 
responded with increased repression and terror. An underground grew rapidly and, on 
May 30, 1961, Trujillo was assassinated. Trujillo's inept son succeeded his father while 
figurehead president Ralaguer retained his office. With continued economic pressures

from OAS sanctions and an increagingly vociferous opposition, Trujillo's son resigned 
abruptly in November. Trujillo's brothers, dissuaded from taking power by the show of 
US naval force off the coast and the antagonism of the armed forces, left the country 
with the remainder of the Trujillo family, leaving Balaguer in charge. Balaguer, 
considered a Trujillista, encountered widespread domestic opposition. After the United 
States threw its support to the opposition, Balaguer was forced to share power with a 
seven-member Council of State and promised to resign with the removal of OAS 
sanctions. On January 4, 1962, the OAS removed all diplomatic and economic 
sanctions. 
Conclusions  
The OAS sanctions and US sugar quota cutbacks, initiated to punish Trujillo and 
force political liberalization in the country, met with considerable success in 
exacerbating deteriorating economic conditions and providing fuel for the floundering 
anti-Trujillo opposition. Although the assassination of Trujillo cannot be directly 
attributed to the sanctions, after his death clear signals of US policy and the 
continuation of the sanctions forced the Trujillo family to flee the country.

US/OAS SANCTIONS ON CUBA* (1962-Present) 
Background to the Sanctions 
Almost from the day Castro took power in January 1959, Havana and Washington 
embarked on courses of action that inevitably led to conflict. The United States was 
first shocked by the circus-like executions of Batista supporters and then alarmed at 
Cuban provocations directed against US citizens, property, and policies. The antagonism 
grew as Cuba became viewed as the vehicle for Soviet encroachment into the 
hemisphere. 
The turning point came with the visit to Cuba of Soviet First Deputy Premier 
Anastas Mikovan, who signed a trade agreement with the Cubans on February 1.5, 1960. 
The agreement was the first of a series of political, military, and economic 
understandings that tied Cuba to the USSR. Furthermore, it began the basic 
reorientation of Cuba away from its traditional US relationship. On May 7, 1960 Cuba 
and the USSR re-established full diplomatic relations. 
With these actions and the attacks against US property and interests, US 
policvmakers decided to impose economic sanctions. A contingency order had already 
been given in March 1960 for Cuban refugees to be organized, trained, and equipped for 
possible action. 
o In June, in consultation with high-level US Government officials, the 
American and British-owned oil refineries in Cuba refused to process 
crude oil sent from the Soviet Union. (Cuba retaliated by seizing the 
installations.) 
o In July, President Eisenhower suspended the remainder of the Cuban 
sugar quota for 1960, which amounted to 900,000 tons out of a total of 
*The application of economic sanctions was only one set of measures used by 
Washington in its relationship with the Castro regime. Other measures included military 
action, covert activities, political pressure, and propaganda, which are not addressed in

3.1 million tons, worth approximately $92 million. (The Cubans reacted 
by confiscating oroperties of US citizens and companies.) 
o During the same two-month period a coordinated decision was made by 
the government and US companies to remove key personnel from 
American plants in Cuba, a measure designed to put the squeeze on 
Cuba's productive capacity and output. (Despite disruptions, this 
technical manpower gap was filled by Cubans or foreign specialists. By 
August, the Castro regime had seized all American properties on the 
island.) 
Following the unsuccessful Bag of Pigs invasion in April 1961, US policy toward 
Cuba entered a new phase. 
o On February 3, 1962 the Kennedy administration imposed a total 
prohibition on exports to Cuba except for "foodstuffs, medicines, and 
medical equipment for humanitarian reasons." 
o On March 23, Washington prohibited imports of merchandise made or 
derived in whole or part of products of Cuban origin. 
Under the Johnson administration, the anti-Cuban measures already instituted by 
the United States were multilateralized through hemispheric approval and support. In 
July 1q64, the Organization of American States (OAS) voted to establish the following 
sanctions against Cuba: 
o The severing of diplomatic and commercial relations. 
o The suspension of all trade, direct and indirect, except for foodstuffs, 
medicines, and medical equipment. 
o The suspension of all sea and air service to and from Cuba. 
o The establishment of passport restrictions on travel to and from 
Cuba. 
Additional sanctions were imposed by the OAS in 1967: 
o The recommendation that government-owned or financed cargoes not 
be shipped on vessels sailing to Cuba. 
o The general call to Western allies to restrict their trade and financial 
ties with Cuba.* 
Most OAS members adopted the sanctions, but many did not rigorously enforce them. 
*See Annex for a listing of the specific sanctions imposed.

Objectives of the Sanctions  
The initial primary objective of the US sanctions was to remove Castro from 
power, demonstrated most visibly by the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion. Subsequently, US 
policy shifted to a combination of economic and political pressures designed to at least 
neutralize Castro and, at best, cause his downfall. The 1962 missile crisis did not change 
this thrust. US officials publicly and privately stated their belief that Cuba posed a 
potentially grave security threat to the United States, directly because of its ties with 
the international Communist movement and indirectly because of its support for 
subversive groups elsewhere in Latin America. 25X1 
The basic structure of the Eisenhower-Kennedy Cuban policy changed little during 
the Johnson administration. The Johnson administration followed the example of its 
predecessors by treating the Castro regime as temporary. The United States publicly 
portrayed the overall goal of its policies to be the establishment of "a truly free and 
independent Cuba which, under a government democratically chosen by the people, will 
live in peace with is neighbors."* US officials also publicly identified four specific goals, 
indicating that US objectives had become more diverse over time: (1) to weaken the 
Castro regime; (2) to discredit the Cuban economic model and make Cuba pay a high 
economic price for its conduct; (3) to contain the spread of Castroism; and (4) to make 
Soviet support of the Castro regime so costly in political and economic terms that the 
Soviets would realize the futility of continuing their burdensome commitment there or of 
assuming similar commitments elsewhere in the hemisphere. 
US policy goals toward Cuba did not change significantly during the Nixon

administration.* Nevertheless, enforcement of the economic sanctions became 
increasingly difficult. The onset of the Vietnam war had revised Washington's foreign 
policy priorities and efforts to enforce the embargo became less aggressive over time. 
The Castro regime not only had demonstrated its staying power but had gradually 
abandoned its support for revolutionary movement in the hemisphere. Indeed, Havana 
launched a broad campaign to normalize its economic and political relations with other 
nations in the hemisphere as well as in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Moreover, the Nixon 
administration launched its overture to China. 
As a result of these events, pressures began to build against continuation of the 
policy of isolation. In the early 1970s, a number of US Congressmen began urging 
normalized relations with Cuba. In 1972 five hemispheric nations recognized Cuba, in 
the face of the OAS ban on relations. In 1974, the United States agreed to permit the 
first major exception to US embargo regulations by permitting sales to Cuba by US 
subsidiaries in third countries. Other exceptions followed. 
By the mid-1970s, therefore, it had become apparent that the broad application of 
economic sanctions and other measures aimed at the isolation of Cuba was no longer 
possible. In August 1975, the OAS passed a resolution that allowed each member to 
determine for itself the nature of its economic and diplomatic relations with Cuba. The 
United States voted in favor of the resolution. 
Economic Impact of the Sanctions  
In our judgment, the Cuban embargo, in its early years, was significantly damaging 
to Cuba's growth and general development. Prior to the embargo, Havana was extremely

dependent on trade with the United States (see Figure 1). The loss of this natural trading 
partner caused serious dislocations throughout the economy. 
Havana's hard currency earnings suffered greatly from the loss of the US market 
for sugar?its major export. Since most large sugar importers had long-established 
contracts with sugar producing nations, Cuba could not make sizable sales to other hard 
currency purchasers. With low export revenues from its major crop, Cuba was forced to 
reduce drastically its imports from the West. Havana turned to the socialist bloc for 
trade, and by 1965 this group of countries accounted for 76 percent of Cuban trade, up 
from less than 3 percent in 1957 (see Figure 2). 
The rapid shift in the direction of trade caused a multitude of domestic production 
problems. Probably the single most damaging effect of the embargo was Cuba's inability 
to obtain the needed spare parts and raw material inputs for its almost entirely (90 
Percent) US-produced capital stock. Other problems emanated from a lack of 
complementarity between Cuba's import needs and Bloc export capabilities. Often the 
kinds of machinery and raw material imports that Cuba needed most were in short supply 
within the Bloc. Not infrequently, the quality of Bloc imports was unsuitable, either due 
to poor production processes or because products were unsuitable to the Cuban climate, 
technological orientations, or methods of use. Hundreds of pieces of Soviet farm 
equipment were junked because they were designed for continental crops planted in rows 
of different widths than the Cubans used. 
While it is not possible to quantify the cost of the embargo to Cuba, we believe it 
was at least partially responsible for the decreases in production experienced by Havana 
during the 1960s (see Table 1).* Other factors included irrational and inefficient planning 
systems and the flight of skilled technicians. In addition, the embargo had a significant 
impact on the Cuban lifestive since the Cuban people were overwhelmingly dependent on

US consumer goods and foodstuffs. Domestic production was oriented toward export 
goods and after the implementation of the embargo imports of consumer goods were 
severely limited due to reduced foreign exchange earnings. 
The effects of the embargo have diminished considerably over time, however. 
Cuba's capital base now consists largely of Soviet, East and West European, and Japanese 
machinery and equipment. Consumer goods are more readily available from both the 
East and from improved domestic production capabilities. In addition, Havana has 
opened several front companies which enable it to obtain various types of US products, 
particularly consumer goods. Industrial, agricultural, and transportation activities are all 
now relatively traffected by the disruptions and diversions of resources originally 
associated with the embargo. 
The costs of the embargo to the United States were minimal. Washington readily 
obtained alternate suppliers for Cuban sugar. In addition, US exports to Cuba were 
small?l.8 percent of total US exports in 1957. 
Political Impact of the Sanctions  
The imposition of sanctions in the 1960s did little to weaken then-Prime Minister 
Castro's internal political position. Indeed, the benefits probably outweighed the 
disadvantages. Sanctions implied a grave external threat, which Castro exploited to 
carry out the radicalization of all Cuban political, economic, and social institutions. In 
an atmosphere of national peril, most Cubans were ready to accept radical change in a 
spirit of sacrifice. 
Those on whom the economic weight of the sanctions would ordinarily fall directly 
were no longer of economic or political importance?having either fled the country or 
been discredited and forced from active political life?or had cast their lot with the 
revolutionary government and supported its policies. Long after the sanctions had lost 
their economic impact, the Castro regime continued to extract political capital by 
blaming virtually every economic problem on them. Even today, Cuba is attributing its

need for debt rescheduling to the economic damage allegedly wrought by the US 
sanctions. 
Results of the Sanctions  
In our judgment, the US and OAS economic sanctions, by themselves or in 
conjunction with other measures, have not met any of their objectives. We also believe 
that Western economic sanctions have almost no chance of compelling the present Cuban 
leadership?mostly guerrilla warfare veterans in power since the late 1970s?to abandon 
its policy of exporting revolution. Not only are these veterans deeply committed to 
armed struggle, but they also see revolution abroad as protective of Cuba by redirecting 
US attention toward regional "hot soots." This is the basis for Che Guevara's theory of 
"creating many Vietnams." 
We believe the current Cuban leadership reacts to sanctions and other external 
Pressures not by reducing foreign subversive adventures but by stepping up such 
activity. Unless Western pressures coincide with Soviet pressures on Havana, sanctions 
are not likely to have the desired limiting effect on Cuban policy until the "guerrilla 
elite" now in control in Havana passes from the scene. 
Conclusions  
The outcome of the US economic sanctions against Cuba in many ways parallels 
that of the USSR's sanctions against China. 
o The Castro regime was so committed to its revolutionary policies that 
it was willing to bear the considerable economic cost of the sanctions. 
o The sanctions provided Castro with a scapegoat for all kinds of 
domestic problems; in fact, he exploited the threat they posed to gain 
acceptance of radical changes in all aspects of Cuban society. 
o Cuban adjustment to the impact of the sanctions left the United States 
with limited economic means to influence Havana's behavior. 
In addition: 
o OAS participation in the sanctions did not change the results because 
their additional economic impact was minimal and enforcement 
became increasingly lax.

ANNEX-Economic Sanctions Applied Against Cuba as of 1975  
1. The OAS Sanctions (None of these has effect by itself; all need support by laws 
and regulations of the individual states:) 
- Member states are called upon to suspend all trade with Cuba, except 
for foodstuffs, medicines, and medical equipment; and to suspend all 
sea transportation between their countries and Cuba except that 
necessary for humanitarian reasons (under Authority of the Rio Treaty, 
Resolution 3 of the Ninth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of 
Foreign Affairs 1964). 
Recommendation is made that OAS member states deny bunkers and 
government cargoes to ships in the Cuba trade (under OAS charter, 
Resolution III 10 of the Twelfth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of 
Foreign Affairs, 1967). 
- Recommendation is made that friendly non-member governments 
restrict their commercial and financial operations with Cuba, as well 
as sea and air transport with that country, especially transactions and 
transport conducted by state entities (recommendation under OAS 
charter, Resolution III 2 of The Twelfth Meeting of Consultation of 
Ministers of Foreign Affairs, 1967). 
2. Restrictions on US Citizens and Entities  
Section 620(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 
authorizes the President to "establish and maintain a total embargo 
upon all trade between the United States and Cuba." Although in 
actual practice provision is made for exceptions for humanitarian 
purposes, a near-total embargo on such trade is maintained under 
regulations which include: 
Export Control Regulations. Issued under the authority contained in 
the Export Administration Act of 1969 (previously the Export control 
of 1949) and other laws, these regulations prohibit any unlicensed 
direct or indirect export from the United States to Cuba except for 
humanitarian shipments of certain foodstuffs, medical supplies and 
inexpensive gift parcels. This includes parts and components exported 
from the United States for use in the manufacture of a product for 
export to Cuba. Licenses are normally not issued. 
Cuban Assets Control Regulations. Issued under the authority 
contained in Section 5 (b) of the 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act and 
other laws, these regulations: 
- Prohibit the direct or indirect import or export of any property in 
which Cuba or a Cuban national has any interest.

- Prohibit, without a license from the US Treasury, any vessel under the 
control of US citizens or their foreign subsidiaries from engaging in the 
Cuba trade. 
- Prohibit American companies that own foreign petroleum installations 
in their own name from bunkering or having any dealing with vessels 
registered in or under charter or lease to Cuba. 
Block Cuban assets in the United States, prevent use of US financial 
facilities by Cuba or Cuban nationals, and prohibit Americans, 
including those who are officers and directors of foreign subsidiaries of 
US companies, from engaging in any financial or commercial 
transaction with Cuba without Treasury license. 
..? 
- Where there are no American officers and directors, the American 
company is asked to support US foreign policy by preventing its foreign 
subsidiary from engaging in such transactions. This "moral suasion" has 
been successful. 
Transportation Order T-1. Issued under the authority contained in the 
Defense Production Act, this order prohibits US registered vessels and 
aircraft from carrying to Cuba any commodity on the United States 
Positive List, the United States Munitions List, or under the control of 
the Atomic Energy Commission without appropriate authorization. 
3. Restrictions on Foreign Citizens and Entities  
Under Section 620 (a) (1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as  
amended: US assistance under the Act is prohibited to the present 
Government of Cuba and to countries that furnish assistance to that 
Government. This can be waived if the President determines such 
assistance is in the national interest. 
Under Section 620 (a) (3) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
amended: US assistance under the Act shall be terminated to countries 
that fail to take appropriate steps to prevent ships or aircraft under 
their registry from carrying any goods to or from Cuba. This can be 
waived if the President determines it important to national interests. 
Under the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951 (The Battle  
Act): US assistance is prohibited to any country that permits strategic 
exports to any nation threatening the security of the United States. 
Cuba was included within the terms of the Battle Act as of November 
1962. 
- Under Section 103 of the Agricultural Trade Development and  
Assistance Act of 1954, as amended (Public Law 480): US sales of 
agricultural commodities under Title I of the Act are prohibited to 
countries that sell, furnish, or permit their ships or aircraft to carry 
any equipment, materials or commodities to or from Cuba, except that 
with respect to the selling, furnishing, or transporting -ofi?nedical 
supplies, non-strategic raw materials for agriculture and non-strategic 
agricultural or food commodities, sales agreements may be entered 
into if the President finds with respect to each such country that such

sale is in the national interest, informs the Congress of his reasons for 
such finding, and publishes his reasons and findings in the Federal 
Register. 
- Under NSAM-220: Shipments owned or financed by the US Government 
should not be shipped from US ports on a foreign flag vessel that has 
called in Cuba since January 1, 1963 unless the persons controlling the 
vessel give satisfactory assurance that no ships under their control will, 
henceforth, be employed in the Cuba trade so long as it remains the 
policy of the US Government to discourage such trade. 
- Under the Export Administration Act of 1969: Department of 
Commerce regulations issued under the authority contained in this Act, 
prohibit the unlicensed bunkering or servicing in US ports of vessels of 
Communist countries, including Cuba, or vessels that have been denied 
access to US Government cargoes by reason of their having been 
engaged in the Cuba trade since January 1, 1963. In accordance with 
the recommendation of the Twelfth Meeting of Consultation of Foreign 
Ministers of the American States, licenses for bunkers are denied to 
ships that have called in Cuba since September 24, 1967. Additionally, 
resale by foreign firms of US commodities (including ship stores, plane 
stores, and bunkers) to Cuba is prohibited unless specifically authorized 
by the Department of Commerce. 
4. The Following is Related to Cuba Directly  
No aid shall be given under the Foreign Assistance Act or any sugar 
quota given to any government of Cuba except as deemed necessary by

UK/UN SANCTIONS ON RHODPSIA (1985-79) 
Background to the Sanctions  
White Rhodesian opposition to sharing power with the country's black majority set 
the stage for the UK-led imposition of economic sanctions against Rhodesia in November 
1985. Pressured by rising worldwide anticolonial sentiment after World War II, the 
United Kingdom hammered out a new constitution for Rhodesia in 1961. Among other 
things, this established a complex franchise system that immediately created 15 
parliamentary seats for blacks and could have led eventually to black majority rule. 
Seeking a quicker and more complete power transfer, however, black nationalist groups 
(led by Joshua Nkomo of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union) rejected the new 
constitution and for the first time resorted to violence against white property. 
Conservative whites formed the Rhodesian Front in March 1982, and this party?aided by 
an election boycott by blacks?won power at the end of that year. 
The political platform of the Rhodesian Front was to remove the threat of black 
nationalism and gain independence from the United Kingdom. Ian Smith, who had risen 
to leadership of the Rhodesian Front by April 1964, pushed London to accede to a formal 
application for independence that had been made by the party leadership in 1963. 
Although the British Government was not averse to independence for Rhodesia, a 
stalemate quickly developed over the role of black Rhodesians after independence. 
Britain sought five conditions: 
o Maintenance of the principles and intention of progress toward 
majority rule, already enshrined in the 1961 constitution. 
o Guarantees against retrogressive amendment of the constitution. 
o Immediate improvement in the political status of blacks. 
o Progress toward ending racial discrimination. 
o Acceptance by the Rhodesian population as a whole of any proposed 
basis for independence.

Following two trips by Smith to London and a visit by UK Prime Minister Harold 
Wilson to Salisbury in futile attempts to iron out differences, the Smith government 
announced a unilateral declaration of independence on 11 November 1965. Prime 
Minister Wilson imposed economic sanctions against Rhodesia on the afternoon of the 
same day. 
Britain imposed a second set of sanctions in December 1965, and the United 
Nations followed with sanctions in December 1966 and May 1968. The UN resolutions 
were passed without dissent. Both resolutions included reminders to member states that 
failure or refusal to implement the measures would constitute a violation of their 
obligations under the UN Charter. All states were called upon to report measures taken 
to implement the resolutions, and a Security Council committee was established to 
gather information on the evasion of sanctions. 
Description of the Sanctions  
UN sanctions complemented those imposed by Britain and eventually encompassed 
a cutoff in all trade, transport of Rhodesian goods, and funding to Rhodesia (see table 
1). In addition to the four major sanctions measures, both the United Kingdom and the 
United Nations passed supplementary legislation and resolutions designed to tighten and 
increase their effectiveness. In January-June 1966, the United Kingdom made purchases 
of several Rhodesian products by anyone in the world a violation of British law. The UN 
Security Council passed roughly a dozen additional sanctions measures after May 1968. 
Some of these covered loopholes in transportation, financing, and franchising, while the 
remainder simply duplicated items in Resolutions 232 and 253. 
Objectives of the Sanctions  
The Wilson government's stated objectives were to end the Smith rebellion and 
restore legitimacy so that ultimately the country could be granted independence under 
majority rule. Wilson wished to unseat Smith ("There can be no truck with this illegal 
regime or any compromise with it.") rather than just induce a return to negotiations. The

objectives of the subsequent UN sanctions were worded differently: to "end the rebellion" 
and to "avoid assisting the illegal regime." 
Wilson had several unspoken objectives aimed both at domestic British 
constituencies and at world opinion. Holding a slim four-seat margin in the British 
parliament, Wilson wanted to head off any growth in pressures for military intervention 
which might endanger his consensus with the Tory parliamentary opposition on the 
sanctions issue. Many in the British Liberal Party and some in the left wing of Wilson's.. 
own Labor Party already were pressing for much stronger measures against Rhodesia. 
Their views coincided with those of many Third World countries. Additional objectives 
not directly articulated by the Wilson government included: 
o Forestalling the use of force by other countries. 
o Maintaining Britain's positive image and reputation in the international 
community. 
o Taking a stand for morality and justice. 
o Reducing the chances that Zambia might cut off copper shipments to 
British industry if Britain failed to punish Rhodesia. 
o Reducing the likelihood of retaliation against whites in other African 
countries. 
The UK and UN sanctions were targeted against the 225,000 white Rhodesians. 
Besides controlling the government, this group dominated the economy. White farmers 
produced all of the country's principal export crops; and white businessmen owned the 
mines, factories, transport facilities, and most of the wholesale and retail distribution 
system. Had sanctions worked as intended, they would also have severely hurt the __ 
welfare of the country's 5 million blacks. Roughly half of these depended on low paying 
jobs in white-owned businesses for at least part of their subsistence. 
Compliance with the Sanctions  
In many respects, Rhodesia appeared to represent a nearly ideal target for 
sanctions:

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/12 : CIA-RDP08501350R000200470001-4 5x1 
o Exports were concentrated in a small number of primary products?
tobacco, sugar, and a few minerals?and only three markets?the 
United Kingdom, Zambia, and South Africa. 
o Imports were concentrated in one product area?machinery and 
transport equipment?and were purchased largely from two countries?
the United Kingdom and South Africa. 
o Overall, foreign trade accounted for a sizable percentage of Rhodesian 
GNP. 
o The British economy was not critically dependent either on supplies of 
raw materials from Rhodesia or on the Rhodesian market.* 
As it turned out, however, the sanctions were severely undermined because Rhodesia's 
African neighbors, Japan, the United States, and many European countries?including the 
United Kingdom?were unwilling or unable to abide by them. Moreover, the United 
Kingdom and the United Nations were unwilling to enforce them militarily. 
South Africa, which faced the threat of sanctions because of apartheid, openly 
helped Rhodesia circumvent the sanctions during the entire 14 years they were in 
effect. Pretoria continued to trade with Rhodesia and provided critical imports, such as 
oil, as well as transport and other entrepot services to the landlocked country. We 
estimate that at least two-thirds of the goods moving between Rhodesia and South Africa 
for much of the period originated or ended up in world markets with false documentation 
provided mainly by South African middlemen. The similarity between Rhodesian and 
South African traded goods as well as South African laws prohibiting importers from 
disclosing the ultimate destination of their purchases enhanced the ability of middlemen 
to obscure the Rhodesian connection. 
Other African countries also breached the UN embargo. 
o Disguised trade channels similar to those through South Africa were 
available to Rhodesia in Portuguese Mozambique until its independence 
in mid-1975. 
* Several Western companies, however, were dependent on specific primary exports 
from Rhodesia. For example, Union Carbide of the United States and Foote Mineral of 
the United Kingdom depended on Rhodesia for chrome ore, Turner and Newall of the 
United Kingdom used Rhodesian asbestos, and Kroof Mull of West Germany relied 
exclusively on graphite from Rhodesia.

o Zambia?Rhodesia's largest 1965 export market?continued to trade 
with Rhodesia and to use its transport facilities until 1973. Then in 
October 1978, after a five-year hiatus, transport bottlenecks on the 
alternative Benguela and Tazara railroads forced Zambia to resume 
transshipments via Rhodesia. This probably enabled some Rhodesian 
goods?particularly white corn, light manufactures, and coal?to find 
their way to Zambian markets. 
o Other black African neighbors?Botswana, Malawi, and Zaire?
maintained economic relations with Salisbury in spite of UN 
sanctions. 
25X1 
The West and Japan did not vigorously enforce sanctions, especially during the 
initial years of application. Indeed, much of the billing and payment for Rhodesia's trade 
with the West was channeled through Swiss banks; Swiss middlemen apparently remained 
important conduits until the sanctions were lifted, although their government banned 
such activity in January 1978. A 1978 report sponsored by the British Government 
accused the United Kingdom's two largest oil companies of supplying petroleum products 
to Rhodesia until 1976?first through South African middlemen, then via a complex swap 
arrangement with a French company in then-Portuguese Mozambique. The United States 
resumed its role as the leading importer of Rhodesian chrome and several other minerals 
from the passage of the Byrd Amendment in late 1971 until its repeal in March 1977. 25X1 
The countries that evaded the Rhodesian sanctions generally had, or gave, strong 
reasons. These mostly reflected their assessments of their own best economic and 
political interests combined with the inducement of strong price incentives offered by 
Rhodesian businessmen: 
o The US Congress passed the Byrd Amendment on the ground that 
chrome was "the one item which could and should be imported from 
Rhodesia that is vital to the national security of the United States." 
* Although only chrome was mentioned during the Congressional hearings and debates, 
the general license issued by the Department of Treasury on 25 January 1972 authorized 
imports of chromium ore, ferrochrome produced in any country from Rhodesian 
chromium ore, and any other material of Rhodesian origin determined to be "strategic 
and critical." Rhodesia produced 22 of the 72 minerals on the US list of "strategic and 
critical" mineral products, and many of these were imported while the Byrd Amendment 
was in force.

o Portugal viewed continuing relations with Rhodesia as a stabilizing 
factor in southern Africa. This was important to Lisbon while it was 
still trying to maintain control of Angola and Mozambique through the 
mid-1970s. 
o Switzerland felt that compliance with the sanctions would violate its 
long-standing policy of neutrality. 
o Cutting trade ties with Rhodesia would have caused severe economic 
dislocations in Malawi, Botswana, Zambia, and Zaire. 
Results of the Rhodesian Sanctions  
The UK and UN sanctions against Rhodesia failed to achieve the stated objectives 
of either Prime Minister Wilson or the UN Security Council. Indeed, as time passed and 
the Rhodesian economy flourished, the United Kingdom narrowed its stated objectives 
for the sanctions. Instead of ousting the Smith regime Britain's goal became that of 
keeping pressure on Smith to negotiate. Even that objective was questioned. By 1972, 
Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Foreign Secretary of the then-Conservative government, said "I 
do not honestly think that sanctions are the main influence which brings Mr. Smith to the 
negotiating table." 
Following the first full year of sanctions, the Rhodesian economy performed well 
for almost a decade. Real GDP growth averaged 6.5 percent annually between 1965 and 
1974; below-average economic performance occurred only in drought years. 
To achieve this pace, the government took a larger role in the economy through a 
formidable array of organizations and controls. 
o Development corporations were set up to provide financing and 
technical expertise for industrial, mining, and agricultural enterprises. 
o Efforts to find new export markets and to evade sanctions were 
centralized. 
o The Rhodesian Government assumed extensive owers in resource 
allocation and control of wages and salaries. 
Import substitution flourished and contributed to the economic resiliency. By 
1970, manufacturing had replaced agriculture as the leading nonservice sector, owing to 
a 50-percent overall growth over the five-year period. As a result, virtually all essential

consumer items and some intermediate and capital goods were supplied domestically, 
thereby saving Rhodesia valuable foreign exchange. Indeed, import volume did not match 
or exceed the 1965 level until 1973. 
On the export side, only agricultural sales suffered badly during the sanctions 
period. The embargo crippled tobacco sales, Rhodesia's single largest foreign exchange 
earner. This was because tobacco was too easily traced to the source and could not, 
therefore, be passed through foreign middlemen to the world market. The sharp decline 
in tobacco earnings, -as well as a need to reduce dependence on imported food, caused the 
government to encourage growers to switch to corn and wheat production. 
Sanctions initially hurt chromium, Rhodesia's second-largest export earner. 
Despite a sharp downturn in output during the late 1960s, however, the US decision to 
end its embargo?the Byrd Amendment?and the skirting of trade impediments by other 
Western countries, allowed production to outstrip presanctions levels by 1972. 
Other nonagricultural exports generally held their own. Copper and pig iron sales, 
for instance, were hurt little by sanctions because of new markets in Western Europe and 
transit with South African bills of lading. The majority of Rhodesia's nondurable 
manufactures were sold to South Africa and were not affected. 
Following the unilateral declaration of independence, South African funds and an 
involuntary boost in domestic investment allowed Rhodesia to largely replace traditional 
sources of capital. With remittances to US, British, and Canadian parent companies 
prohibited by the Smith government, profits had to be reinvested rather than 
repatriated. As a result, total domestic investment surged from 13 percent of GDP in 
1964 to an annual average of 20 percent during the first half of the 1970s. 
In addition to the reinvested earnings, some $500-750 million in new foreign 
investment flowed in, mostly from South Africa. Adherence to the boycott by 
international bankers and foreign donors made Salisbury almost totally dependent on 
South Africa for these and other financial flows. Concessional aid and access to

Pretoria's private capital markets enabled the Rhodesian Government to finance its small 
budget deficits. 
The Civil War Years  
Beginning in 1975, Rhodesia was beset by a new round of troubles that wreaked 
economic havoc. The main factors were an escalation of the protracted civil war and the 
Zambian and Mozambican closure of their borders with Rhodesia. The ensuing 
uncertainty and the erosion of the middle class market because of white emigration 
weakened the investment climate. Moreover, international demand for Rhodesian 
commodities sagged with the recession in Western markets. The economic downturn that 
began in 1975 persisted for five years. With the real economic decline averaging 3 
Percent annually, per capita income had tumbled 24 percent by 1979. 
Government reactions to the war also had profound implications, as the mounting 
diversion of resources into defense undercut economic growth. The defense portion of 
the budget rose from 19 percent in 1975 to a peak of 32 percent in 1979, pushing the 
overall budget deficit from $4 million in 1975 to over $700 million in 1979. The 
stimulative effects of rising defense expenditures were more than offset by the reduction 
in producer and consumer subsidies, the boost in personal income taxes, and the 
mandatory purchase of war bonds to help cover these deficits. Moreover, the shift of 
scarce foreign exchange to military-related purchases reduced financial resources for 
local businessmen, even as the diversion of skilled white manpower from industry and 
agriculture worsened an already bad labor situation. 
External factors also undermined the embattled economy. The Zambian border 
closure during 1973-78 had deprived Salisbury of transshipping fees, but, by itself, this 
did little harm. More serious was the decision in 1976 by the new Machel government in 
Mozambique to close its borders with Rhodesia. This action forced a rerouting of trade 
through South Africa that increased Rhodesia's freight payments about 50 percent 
annually.

25X1 
Beyond the internal and regional forces, the deteriorating international economy 
also took a heavy toll. Demand by developed countries for most of Rhodesia's exports 
slumped as world oil prices soared. Trade sanctions caused Rhodesia to suffer 
disproportionately, as buyers switched to more dependable suppliers. In addition, largely 
because of technology changes, Rhodesia was unable to replace the US chrome market 
lost to it after the 1977 repeal of the Byrd Amendment. 
Whether the sanctions were a significant factor in the ultimate switch to majority 
rule, 14 years after they were imposed, is questionable. Without the escalating civil war 
after 1975, the Rhodesian economy probably would have continued to achieve a 
performance acceptable to the white population despite sanctions. Nonetheless, 
combined with the civil war and the persistent diplomatic pressures of the United States, 
? United Kingdom, and ultimately even South Africa, the Smith government probably 
factored in the difficulties caused by sanctions in its decision to capitulate. 
By imposing sanctions, the Wilson government probably achieved some of its 
unstated objectives. Thus, the imposition of sanctions served?at least initially?as an 
effective expression of morality and justice and probably helped maintain a positive 
international image for Britain. As time passed and the sanctions proved ineffective in 
bringing Rhodesia to heel, these initial results were severely eroded. Third world 
countries, in particular, expressed frustration over London's unwillingness to resort to 
military force. 
After Majority Rule  
Ironically, the longer term outcome of the Rhodesian sanctions was to leave the 
Smith government's successors with far more diversified and stronger manufacturing and 
agricultural sectors than would otherwise have been likely. By 1975, the investment of 
retained earnings by Rhodesian companies plus South African investment had developed 
Rhodesian manufacturing sufficiently to meet most domestic consumer needs and provide 
exports to South Africa and other neighboring countries. Because of the enforced switch

25X1 
from tobacco to grain crops, Rhodesia not only strengthened its self sufficiency in food 
production, but also became (along with South Africa) one of Africa's only two consistent 
net food exporting countries. 
Conclusions  
The failure of the UK and UN sanctions to achieve more than a few unstated ? 
and certainly not primary ? objectives illustrates the difficulties of enforcing sanctions 
even against a target that appears highly vulnerable. 
o The sanctions were not fully enforced by any of the major 
implementing parties. 
o Neither the United Kingdom ncr the United Nations was willing to use 
military force. 
o A key supplier of the value to be withheld by the sanctions ? South 
Africa ? did not participate and, in fact, openly flouted the sanctions. 
o Largely because of South Africa's role, the Smith government's 
prohibition against profit repatriation by foreign-owned companies, and 
Salisbury's centralization of economic authority, the Rhodesian 
economy adjusted quite well to the sanctions that were enforced. 
The fact that the Smith government gave way after 14 years appears much more the 
result of the civil war and heavy diplomatic pressure than of the domestic impact of 
sanctions. 
Even though unintentional, the sanctions ultimately turned out to be beneficial 
from the viewpoint of both the sponsors and the target because they left Rhodesia, now 
Zimbabwe, with a much stronger economy than would otherwise have been likely.

FRENCH SANCTIONS ON ALGERIA (1971) 
Background to the Sanctions  
In April 1971 France imposed sanctions against Algeria in an effort to resolve a 
dispute over oil prices and the nationalization of French oil holdings. The issue arose 
when a 1985 oil agreement granting oil and gas concessions to France in return for aid in 
industrial development and exploration came UP for renegotiation in 1970. The Algerian 
Government claimed that France was not fulfilling all of its obligations in connection 
with exploration, industrial development, and the import of Algerian gas into Prance. 
In July 1970 Algeria unilaterally announced an increase in the tax-reference 
price* of oil from $1.08 to 52.85 per barrel. In the fall of 1970 it called for $3.00 and by 
the end of the year was demanding $3.24. Furthermore, Algeria asserted that the price 
issue was secondary to its objective of taking over control of oil production from the 
French companies involved. After protracted negotiations, the Algerian Government 
broke the deadlock in February 1971 and unilaterally announced that it would take over 
51 percent of French oil production?accounting for about 70 percent of total Algerian 
crude oil production?and all pipelines and gas wells in the country. 
According to press reports, the French Government initially decided to make the 
best of the situation and seek the highest possible remuneration for seizures. Following 
fruitless talks between the two governments, however, Algeria announced in April 1971 
that: 
o It was raising its oil price to 53.80 per barrel (the highest price of any 
oil Producer in the world). 
o It would pay only 5100 million to French oil companies as 
compensation for the 51-percent takeover of their assets (about a

seventh of what the French companies had estimated their lost assets 
to be worth and a third of what they were willing to settle for). 
o It was ending all foreign-owned concessions in Algeria. 
The French Government responded by cutting off negotiations with the Algerian 
Government, and the French companies involved?the state-owned Elf-Erap and the 35 
percent state-owned French Petroleum Company (CFP)?suspended their liftings of 
Algerian oil. 
Objective of the sanctions  
The objective of the sanctions was to force the Algerian Government to 
reconsider compensation terms and the tax-reference price of oil. The French 
calculated that their actions would lead to an immediate drop in revenue. The French 
companies involved produced in 1970 some 660,000 b/d of crude oil out of a total 
Algerian production of 960,000 b/d. 
Description of the Sanctions  
The French boycott cost the Algerians a production drop of at least 25 percent in 
1971. In addition to suspending their lifting of Algerian oil, the companies took action on 
the international oil market by issuing warnings that they would sue any buyers of oil 
from the fields seized by Algeria, which they considered to be their property. The 
French Government also approached the World Bank, from which the Algerian state oil 
firm Sonatrach was seeking financing for petroleum development, to block any extension 
_ 
of credits. Finally, it appealed to the United States to forgo a planned purchase of gas 
from Sonatrach until the oil dispute was settled. 
Factors Affecting the Success or Failure of Sanctions  
The effectiveness of the French sanctions was undermined by developments in the 
world oil market, where rising prices enabled the Algerians largely to offset the losses 
resulting from production cutbacks. Moreover, the French could not win the full support 
of their allies. Although the United States proved willing to delay the purchase of 
Algerian gas by the Texas El Paso firm?a decision also influenced by the high Algerian

asking price?both US and Rritish firms reached agreements with Sonatrach on the 
exploitation of their own, smaller oil concessions in Algeria. 
French determination to uphold the sanctions was eroded by the disproportionate 
cost of the measures to their own interests. Prior to the imposition of sanctions, 
Algerian oil accounted for 25 percent of total domestic consumption. French energy 
policy, which did not provide well for alternative sources of supply, made it difficult for 
France to quickly find oil substitutes to make up for the Algerian shortfall. Its loss was 
Particularly serious for the Elf-Erap firm, for which it represented 80 percent of total 
Production. In addition, the sanctions strained Franco-Algerian trade relations generally 
and encouraged Algeria, which had relied heavily on trade with France, to diversify its 
trading partners (for example, by developing prospects for large-scale exports of oil and 
gas to the United States). The sanctions also strained the "special relationship" between 
Algeria and France. This was of special concern to France since Paris considered Algeria 
an important link to the Arab world. 
Results of the Sanctions  
The net result of these converging pressures was the collapse of the sanctions. 
First CFP?in June 1971?and then Elf-Erap?in December 1971?agreed to most Algerian 
terms. CFP settled for a share of oil amounting to half its 1970 production, and Elf-Erap 
accepted a share equal to only one-third of its pre-nationalization production. Four 
small companies agreed to withdraw completely from the Algerian industry. 
Compensation for the nationalization was close to Algeria's original terms. The tax-
reference price was raised to $9,.8049.95 per barrel, with a provision for renegotiation 
after five years. 
Sonatrach, on the other hand, emerged as the tenth most important oil producing 
company in the world. Algeria itself has emerged as one of the leading price hawks in 
OPEC. Its victory over sanctions in 1971 almost certainly contributed to this 
aggressiveness.

Conclusions  
In the French boycott of Algerian oil almost none of the factors needed for 
successful.sanctions was present. 
o France was not Algeria's only customer and could not gain the full 
support of the others. 
o France's commitment to the sanctions was eroded because it could 
not readily replace Algerian oil, which was a significant portion of 
French supplies, and because the sanctions strained the "special 
relationship" with Algeria, which Paris considered a key link to the 
Arab world. 
? The cost of the sanctions to Algeria was minimal because rising world 
oil prices enabled the Algerians to offset most of the revenue loss 
resulting from the reduction in export volume. 
o The Algerian Government remained strongly committed to taking 
over control of its oil production.

OAPEC OIL EMBARGO ON THE UNITED STATES (1.973-19741 
Background to the Sanctions  
The Arab oil exporting nations embargoed the United States during and after the 
1967 Middle East war but to no effect. The United States used its domestic spare 
capacity in conjunction with stepped-up imports from non-Arab oil producers to meet its 
oil requirements. The Arabs were unable to withstand the loss of oil revenue for an 
extended period and soon lifted the embargo. 
By October 1973, however, the United States had become vulnerable to an Arab 
embargo. Three important developments had taken place: 
o US oil demand increased steeply while domestic production fell. 
o Increased world oil demand reduced world spare capacity. 
o Oil prices quadrupled. 
Between 1967 and 1973 the US energy intensive industries boomed and most of the 
increased energy demand was for oil. Environmental laws and federal regulation limited 
the mining and use of coal, the construction of nuclear power plants, and natural gas 
production. US oil output peaked in 1970 and fell thereafter; Arab oil imports rose as a 
result. 
Until 1970 world oil supply usually exceeded demand. In the early 1970s, however, 
the economies of the major industrial countries expanded simultaneously and soaked up 
the excess supply. 
The surge in oil demand and growing assertiveness by OPEC revolutionized oil 
pricing. In 1971, producer governments forced the oil companies to raise oil prices. 
Then, on 16 October 1973, OPEC uniliaterally hiked the price from $3.01 to $5.12 a 
barrel. Demand continued to outrun supply and three months later OPEC raised the price

to t11.65. Oil revenues flowed into producing countries at unprecedented rates, giving 
OAPEC members sufficient financial reserves to withstand a prolonged embargo. 
Description of the Sanctions  
On 6 October 1973, Syria and Egypt invaded Israeli-occupied Arab territory. 
Israel suffered military reversals in the first days of the war and asked the United States 
to resupply it with arms. 
On 17 October, the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (0APEP)* decided to: (1) embargo the United States, (2) shut-in the oil 
normally shipped to the United States and reduce production an additional 5 percent, (3) 
determine an importer's access to Arab oil according to its level of support for the Arab 
cause and (4) make further monthly production cuts of 5 percent until Israel relinquished 
all Arab territory.** 
On 18 October the United States announced that it would resupply Israel with 
arms. Saudi Arabia, which had counseled OAPEC to be moderate, reacted by reducing its 
oil production an additional 5 percent and assuming leadership of the embargo. 
Enforcement  
OAPEC governments ordered foreign oil companies to enforce the embargo and 
threatened them with expropriation and other punitive measures if they failed to 
comply. To insure compliance, OAPEC members required tanker captains loading Arab 
oil to sign affidavits designating their destination and to cable back upon arrival. Arab 
diplomats abroad also checked public records of oil imports. OAPEC members did not 
establish a mechanism to monitor each other's observance of the boycott; nonetheless, 
virtually no Arab oil reached the United States during the embargo. 
* OAPEC consists of Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Algeria, Qatar, the United 
Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Syria, and Egypt. 
** Iraq  subsequently refused to reduce its production, but it did participate in the 
embargo.

Objectives of the Sanctions  
OAPEC members stated three objectives for the sanctions: 
o Express their anger at the United States for assisting Israel. 
o Demonstrate solidarity with Egypt and Syria. 
o Make the United States press Israel to return Arab land. 
The act of imposing sanctions allowed OAPEC to accomplish the first two 
objectives. As to the third, Egypt regained sovereignty over some of its territory while 
the sanctions were in effect, but the United States did not ask Israel to make territorial 
concessions in order to induce the Arabs to lift the embargo. 
The OAPEC linkage between the sanctions and repatriation of Arab land loosened 
after the war ended in late October. Saudi Arabia, the largest oil exporter and the key 
to maintaining the embargo, indicated that total Israeli withdrawal was not a condition 
for lifting the sanctions. It did insist, however, that Israeli withdrawal begin. 
In November, the United States launched a diplomatic effort to disengage Arab 
and Israeli forces. Egypt and Israel concluded an agreement in mid-January that required 
Israel to pull back in the Sinai. Henry Kissinger, who mediated the agreement, asserts in 
his memoirs that the sanctions did not influence US diplomacy. Israeli Defense Minister 
Moshe Dayan's memoirs corroborate Kissinger. 
The United States felt that the agreement met the Saudi condition for ending the 
embargo. However, Syria quickly petitioned the Saudis to extend the embargo until the 
United States attempted a Syrian-Israeli disengagement. The United States refused to 
commence negotiations while the embargo was in effect. In February, an Arab summit 
conference offered a compromise; OAPEC would agree to end the embargo if the United 
States sent a diplomatic mission to assess the prospects for a Syrian-Israeli 
disengagement. The United States agreed, and OAPEC lifted the embargo on 19 March 
1974.

Impact of the Sanctions  
The Arab sanctions led to widespread fuel shortages in the United States. The 
sanctions had an impact because (1) non-Arab exporters did not have sufficient spare 
capacity to compensate for Arab production cutbacks and (2) the Arabs had the financial 
reserves to maintain the embargo for an extended period. 
Three factors, however, mitigated the sanctions' impact: 
o The oil companies used their worldwide transportation and marketing 
networks to reallocate the available oil. By diverting some non-Arab 
oil from Europe and Japan to the United States and replacing it with 
OAPEC production, they prevented the United States from losing the 
maximum possible amount of oil. 
o At the time, US dependence on Arab oil was modest. The sanctions 
cost the United States 1.3 million b/d of oil or 7% of its total oil 
consumption. The American people experienced discomfort but not 
hardship.* 
o The US commitment to Israel had broad support. Throughout the 
embargo, the public never pressed the government to change its 
Mideast policy to meet Arab demands. 
Results of the Sanctions  
The embargo awakened the United States to the costs of importing substantial 
amounts of oil. During and after the embargo, the United States began making major 
adjustments in its domestic and foreign policies to try to reduce its vulnerability to 
future sanctions. The United States: 
o Initiated a variety of programs to conserve energy, develop synthetic 
fuels, and increase oil, gas, and coal production. 
o Helped create the International Energy Agency to foster energy 
cooperation among the industrial oil importing countries. 
o Assumed a more active role in the Middle East to prevent a diplomatic 
stalemate that could trigger another war and renewed sanctions. 
* The oil companies' allocation measures caused Western Europe to lose about 12 
percent of its total oil consumption; they permitted Japan to increase its consumption by 
about 10 %.

The embargo had a powerful demonstration effect on other industrial countries. 
Most were heavy consumers of Arab oil and lacked the capacity to substantially reduce 
their dependence. Western Europe and Japan waged vigorous diplomatic campaigns to 
cultivate OPEC members As a result, they voiced greater support for Arab positions. 
The sanctions greatly enhanced the international prestige of the Arab oil 
exporters and OPEC in general. OAPEC had used oil to punish a military superpower 
with impunity. The less developed countries saw it as a turning point in international 
relations. They soon enlisted OPEC support in an attempt to make the industrial 
countries create a "new international economic order" favorable to the Third World. 
Conclusions  
In terms of its effectiveness the OAPEC oil embargo on the United States 
presents a paradox. Few of the elements needed for achieving substantial economic 
impact were present. 
o The Arab oil exporters were not able to control the supply of oil to the 
United States. 
o The United States was able to adjust to the embargo with relatively 
little economic dislocation. 
o The United States remained committed to its support for Israel. 
Yet, OAPEC members could legitimately claim that the embargo met their 
objectives. 
o The goals of expressing anger at the United States and demonstrating 
solidarity with Syria and Egypt were symbolic and easily met by 
imposing the embargo. 
o The goal of making the United States pressure Israel to return Arab 
land was also largely symbolic because Washington was already 
committed to this end. 
As it turned out, the oil price increases had a more substantial economic impact on the 
United States than the embargo.

US SANCTIONS ON PAKISTAN (1977-88) 
Rackground to the Sanctions 
The imposition of sanctions against Pakistan in the late 1970s involves a number 
of factors that appear to make it a special case. First, the objective on the part of the 
US Government was highly specific?namely, to discourage the Pakistani military regime 
from pursuing a nuclear weapons program. Other aspects of Islamabad's foreign and 
security policies or even its domestic politics and human rights record were not relevant 
to the decision to impose sanctions. Second, the sanctions were diverse, involving not 
only the prohibition of all nuclear cooperation but also the termination of US 
Government assistance in the areas of military and economic aid. Third, some of the 
sanctions have been removed while other restrictions still remain in effect. The 
Prohibition against nuclear cooperation is still in force, but economic and military 
assistance programs involving or requiring US Government financial support resumed as 
of December 1981. 
A crucial factor that complicates any long-germ assessment is that expected 
developments in the Pakistani nuclear program could triggr the reimposition of 
economic and military sanctions within a short period of time. The rationale and legal 
foundation for the original sanctions remain operative. US political leaders can 
authorize a total embargo on assistance programs any time the pace of the Pakistani?
nuclear program seems to warrant this step. The possibility of a reimposition of 
economic-military sanctions could still influence the decisionmaking process within the 
Pakistani military regime concerning the immediate need for a nuclear weapons device.

The Sanctions: Origin and Scope  
The imposition of sanctions against Pakistan in 1978 and 1979 was an outgrowth of 
the broad Congressional-Executive effort in 1976-1978 to codify laws governing nuclear 
exports and to make US nonproliferation policy more stringent. The relevant US 
legislation does not single out Pakistan, but growing concern about the direction of the 
Pakistani nuclear program was an important factor in stimulating proposals for tougher 
laws on nuclear transfers to nonnuclear weapons states. The French decision in early 
1976 to sell Pakistan a commercial-scale reprocessing plant was a major turning point. 
The Ford and Carter administrations put considerable pressure on the French 
Government to cancel the contract even though Pakistan had agreed to place the facility 
under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. In June 1978 Paris informed 
Washington that French firms would withdraw from the reprocessing plant project. We 
believe this step was taken not in response to US wishes but primarily because of the 
risks in being associated with the nuclear weapons ambitions of a right-wing military 
regime. 
US Government efforts to restrict relations with Pakistan were based on the 
following legislation: 
o The Symington and Glenn Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act 
of 1961. 
o The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. 
The fundamental purpose of this legislation was to pose the threat of sanctions to 
persuade states that had not already ratified the Non-Proliferation Treaty to (a) accept _ 
IAEA safeguards over their entire nuclear program and (b) refrain from procurement 
activities that could contribute to a nuclear weapons program. Congress and the 
Executive Branch were essentially in agreement on these basic goals, although opinions 
varied about the ultimate motives of potential proliferators such as Pakistan. 
The prohibition against all nuclear cooperation with Pakistan resulted from the 
automatic aoplication of section 118 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. This

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/12 : CIA-RDP08501350R000200470001-4 5X1 
section stipulates that there can be no nuclear exports to any nonnuclear weapons state 
that has not placed all its nuclear activities under IAEA safeguards at the time of 
export. Islamabad's longstanding refusal to accept safeguards on all its existing nuclear 
facilities required 12E facto the total and immediate ban on US nuclear transfers to 
Pakistan.* This prohibition took effect on 10 March 1978 when the Act came into 
force. 
Termination of economic and military assistance to Pakistan resulted from the 
Glenn and Symington Amendments. The Glenn Amendment to the Foreign Assistance 
Act (section 6701 requires such sanctions against any nonnuclear weapons state that 
acquires reorocessingL technology or detonates a nuclear device. This amendment was 
never formally invoked, but the US Government ordered a winding down of economic aid 
in 1977 in reaction to the French-Pakistani reprocessing plant project. Economic 
assistance was resumed for 1978-79 after the French decision to withdraw from the 
reprocessing project. 
The eventual termination of all US Government economic and military assistance 
to Pakistan resulted from the application of the Symington Amendment. This 
amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act (section 669) stipulates that a nonnuclear 
weapons state that has obtained uranium enrichment technology outside IAEA safeguards 
can no longer receive economic or military assistance from the US Government. 
Discovery of evidence of the existence of Islamabad's clandestine enrichment facility 
near Kahuta led to the imposition of economic and military sanctions for nearly three 
years beginning in March 1979. 
Objectives of the Sanctions  
There were three publicly stated objectives for the imposition of sanctions on 
Pakistan:

o To discourage the Pakistani military regime from pursuing a nuclear 
weapons program. 
? o To slow development of the program by persuading other nuclear 
weapons states not to export sensitive nuclear materials, equipment, 
and technology to Pakistan. 
o To demonstrate that the United States would withhold nuclear 
cooperation and economic and military aid from a nonnuclear state 
which is attempting to develop nuclear weapons. 
Results of the Sanctions  
In our judgment the imposition of the sanctions failed to achieve the first 
objective. Pakistani President 7,ia and his top military advisers were not deterred from 
their fundamental objective of obtaining a nuclear weapons capability. Islamabad 
steadfastly resisted safeguards over ifs entire nuclear program, and Pakistani scientists 
continued efforts to develop both reprocessing and enrichment technology?the two 
routes to a nuclear weapons capability. Moreover, there was no incentive to slow the 
effort to develop a nuclear weapons capability once it became evident that the US 
Government wished to resume economic and military aid to Pakistan in the wake of the 
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan Although the nuclear sanctions remain in effect, 
economic and military aid resumed as of December 1981. 
Impact of the Sanctions  
On a political level, the military regime in Islamabad appeared to reap additional 
public support in the wave of reaction against the US sanctions in 1971. The Pakistani 
leaders felt no compelling need to rely on the United States prior to the Soviet invasion 
of Afghanistan later that year. They had taken steps to develop strong ties with China 
following the downturn in US-Pakistani relations in the mid-1960s. In the 1970s, Pakistan 
also looked more to moderate Arab states and Iran for financial assistance and to 
European suppliers for arms.

history of bilateral relations and the widespread belief among Pakistanis that the United 
States had failed them in two wars with India. 
The sanctions appear to have reinforced Islamabad's doubts about the credibility 
of the US security commitment to Pakistan as enunciated in the defense cooperation 
agreement of 1959.* 
25X1 
the termination of US 25X1 
military assistance, if anything, confirmed Pakistan's intention to develop a nuclear 
weapons capability. Islamabad regards such a capability as the ultimate guarantor of its 
security against India whose conventional supremacy and nuclear potential it cannot hope 
to match. With the United States unavailable as a counter to India and the Chinese 
unable to supply sophisticated arms, Islamabad placed a high value on nuclear weapons as 
an effective deterrent that was attainable with Pakistan's technological and financial 
resources. 
The cutoff in US economic aid occurred at a time when Pakistan's foreign 
payments position was becoming increasingly precarious following several years of heavy 
borrowing. Foreign exchange reserves had dropped by one-half between December 1978 
and July 1979 to $183 million and continued to slide to a mid-September low of $77 
million, roughly one week's import coverage. While US aid was small relative to 
Pakistan's needs ? scheduled 1979 disbursements of $130 million vs. a financial gap of 
$1.3 billion ? it was provided on very soft terms. Nevertheless, after vaguely 
threatening to default on debt service payments in an effort to secure a new debt 
rescheduling agreement from a group of Western creditors, Pakistan was able to bolster 
its international reserves by negotiating short-term credits from foreign private banks 
and soliciting emergency assistance from Saudi Arabia. 
President Zia ridiculed a tentative US offer in early 1980 to provide $400 million in 
emergency economic and military aid following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This 
offer was made by the Carter administration without having obtained Congressional 
approval to waive the restrictions under the Symington Amendment.

Despite the lack of US aid, by June 1980 Islamabad had covered its foreign 
payments gap and increased foreign exchange reserves to nearly $700 million. Islamabad 
used planned and emergency aid from Saudi Arabia, a $163 million Trust Fund loan from 
the IMF, and borrowed short-term funds against export earnings of the next rice crop. 
Moreover, good crops, strong export growth, and several key economic policy refoms 
enabled the economy to grow 6 percent in FY 1980 for the third consecutive year. 
Pakistan reduced its current account deficit in both 1980 and 1981. 
Military Assistance  
The termination of military aid probably reduced US influence within the 
Pakistani military establishment as a result of the suspension of the IMET training 
program for promising officers, but it had no appreciable effect on Pakistan's military 
capabilities. The amount of US arms supplied to Islamabad after 1965 was negligible and 
largely paid for in cash. Since the US arms embargo during the 1965 India-Pakistan war, 
China and France had become Pakistan's principal arms suppliers. From FY 66 through 
FY 79 Pakistan purchased less than $430 million in military equipment from the United 
States, much of it spare parts and ammunition for older US weapons. The only 
significant military items purchased from the United States during this time were TOW 
anti-tank missiles and M-113 armored personnel carriers, bought in 1975 and 1976. 
The Symington Amendment did not preclude cash military sales. Even before the 
sanctions were applied, only $7.6 million of Pakistan's total arms purchases from the 
United States were funded by Foreign Military Sales (FMS) credits, and none since FY 
68. Pakistan signed cash FMS agreements worth t88 million in FY 80 and FY 81 after 
the Symington Amendment sanctions were applied, but only for spare parts, ammunition, 
and support equipment. Moreover, the Symington Amendment did not preclude the 
delivery of military equipment already purchased. Pakistan received about $130 million 
in military equipment, including TOWs and armored personnel carriers from FMS 
agreements concluded prior to the sanctions.

Nuclear Sanctions  
Nuclear relations between Pakistan and the United States were virtually non-
existent when the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 went into force. The main 
effect of the Act's prohibition of nuclear transfers to Pakistan fell on the US voluntary 
contribution in cash and kind to the International Atomic Energy Agency, an annual gift 
used to finance technical assistance and training programs for developing nations. Since 
the contribution was funded under the Foreign Assistance Act, the United States decided 
that the provisions of the Symington Amendment made Pakistan ineligible for any US 
funds provided via the IAEA on a country-specific basis. This assistance included the 
provision of experts, gifts of equipment for laboratory facilities, and fellowships for the 
study of nuclear-energy-related subjects in the United States. The training and technical 
assistance which the United States denied to Pakistan through the IAEA was instead 
provided by European countries. 
The United States has succeeded to a considerable extent, however, in meeting its 
secondary objective of making it more difficult for Pakistan to achieve a nuclear 
weapons capability. Washington continued efforts to persuade other nuclear supplier 
states not to export sensitive nuclear materials, equipment, and technology to Pakistan 
? efforts that would not have been credible in the absence of US nuclear sanctions. This 
attempt to win support for tighter export controls was a source of tension and 
disagreement with other nuclear suppliers for a number of reasons: 
o Several West European countries as a matter of policy are opposed to 
trade restrictions even with regard to nuclear transfers to a potential 
proliferator. 
o Few West European countries accept the principle that a nonnuclear 
item should be controlled on the ground that it could contribute to a 
nuclear weapons program. As a result, the United States has found it 
difficult to interdict trade with Pakistan involving dual-use equipment 
or gray area technology. 
o Other nuclear supplier states have until recently resisted US efforts to 
make the export control lists more precise and more comprehensive. 
The London Suppliers Guidelines in many instances are too vague to 
serve as a useful guide to the implementation of export control policy.

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/09/12 : CIA-RDP08501350R000200470001-445X1 
o Some countries have not been willing to devote the law enforcement 
resources needed to prevent Pakistan from operating a clandestine 
procurement network in Western Europe. Through the use of 
intermediaries, false shipping addresses, dummy companies, and other 
techniques, Pakistan has been able to conceal in many instances that it 
is the ultimate user of items being bought. 
Nevertheless, Pakistan is less prepared to explode a nuclear device 'at this time 
than it would have been had Islamabad been free to advance its nuclear program through 
open procurement and trade. A number of nuclear supplier states were sensitive to the 
issue of nuclear cooperation with Pakistan and took steps to prevent some sensitive 
nuclear transfers. As a result, Islamabad is now almost totally dependent on the 
clandestine procurement network. Plans to complete and operate the enrichment- and 
reprocessing facilities designed to produce weapons-grade nuclear material have been 
delayed. 
The United States is still trying to get Pakistan to accept safeguards on all its 
nuclear facilities. Washington has urged other nuclear supplier states not to submit bids 
for Pakistan's new nuclear power reactor without the stipulation that Islamabad must 
accept "full scope" safeguards. Several Western governments, however, have made it-
clear to the United States that they fear they might be undercut by competitors at the 
last moment and lose the contract. Nevertheless, the concern about Pakistan's 
unsafeguarded facilities and the IAEA's inability to maintain effective safeguards at 
Pakistan's only power reactor near Karachi is now widespread. There are no 
international legal obligations for any nuclear supplier to insist on full scope safeguards 
but failure to make this demand of Pakistan at this point would expose the supplier state 
to considerable criticism. 
Pakistan's leaders are not likely to relinquish their objective of obtaining a nuclear 
weapons option even if the United States succeeds in fashioning a united supplier front on 
the issue of full scope safeguards. However, the rejection of full scope safeguards would

seriously impede Pakistan's plans for a larger nuclear power program. The Pakistanis 
could and probably would turn to other developing nations with nuclear expertise for 
assistance, but this strategy would take years to bear fruit. 
Conclusions  
o The US sanctions against Pakistan did not halt Pakistan's nuclear 
program, but the fact that the United States took tangible action and 
reinforced it with efforts to sensitize other nuclear supplier states has 
caused Islamabad to be almost totally dependent on the clandestine 
procurement network and has slowed development of its nuclear 
program. 
o The sanctions imposed under provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act 
did not have a major impact , on Pakistan's military preparedness or 
economic development because 'aldstan was able to adjust to the 
absence of US aid for the short period of its suspension in part because 
other donors, including multilateral institutions supported by the 
United States, provided alternate sources of military and economic aid. 
o The Government of Pakistan was willing to forgo US assistance in order 
to continue its efforts to develop nuclear weapons because it perceived 
nuclear weapons as a vital element in its national security. 
o Imposition of US sanctions in a highly visible way increased domestic 
support for the Government of Pakistan thus easing the political cost 
of the forgone aid.

US TRADE SANCTIONS AGAINST UGANDA (1978) 
Background to the Sanctions  
The United States imposed trade sanctions on Uganda in October 1978 in response 
to a lengthy series of human rights violations by Ugandan President Idi Amin. According 
to US Government estimates, Amin had murdered nearly 100,000 people?including two 
American reporters?since seizing power in a military coup in 1971. He also had expelled 
almost all of Uganda's 60,000-member Asian community, crippling the country's domestic 
trade. 
The decision to impose sanctions capped a year-long campaign by a small group of 
Congressmen who in September 1977 introduced three bills to terminate all trade 
between the United States and Uganda. Statements in The Congressional Record 
indicate particular concern about US purchases of Ugandan coffee?half of Kampala's 
total coffee exports at the time?which were cited as an important element in Amin's 
ability to stay in power. The statements also pointed out the role of US companies in 
supplying nearly 40 percent of Uganda's oil imports, in constructing a 
telecommunications satellite system, and in providing civilian jet aircraft and pilot 
training. According to Ugandan statistics, the United States was Uganda's largest 
trading partner in 1977, accounting for one-third of the value of Kampala's international 
transactions. 
Efforts to obtain approval of embargo legislation were held up by the lack of 
support in both Congress and the White House. 
President Carter's opposition to Ugandan sanctions was based on a number of factors. 
o The United States had already demonstrated its distaste for the Amin 
regime by closing its embassy in Kampala and suspending all official US 
assistance. 
o Washington was monitoring Ugandan trade by requiring the 
Departments of State and Commerce to review US export licenses and 
determine whether the export item would contribute to human rights 
violations.

? 
o Amin might retaliate by taking measures threatening the safety of the 
200 Americans still in Uganda. 
o Economic sanctions would be ineffective and inconsistent with the 
principle of free trade. 
Over the next several months, however, an intensive anti-Amin campaign by the 
American media gradually aroused public opinion in favor of sanctions, with a similar 
impact on Congress. 
Provisions and Objectives of the Sanctions  
The sanctions contained in Public Law 95-455 of October 10, 1978, applied to 
nearly all US trade with Uganda and directed that: 
o No article, including technical data or other information, except grains 
and additional foodstuffs could be exported to Uganda by anyone 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. 
o No article grown, produced, or manufactured in Uganda could be 
imported into the United States. 
These proscriptions were to remain in effect until the President certified to Congress 
that the government of Uganda was "no longer engaged in a consistent pattern of gross 
violations of human rights." 
While an end to human rights violations in Uganda was the stated objective of the 
sanctions, we believe the Congressional testimony on the legislation indicates that there 
was a major unstated objective as well. That goal was to put enough pressure on the 
Ugandan economy to undercut Amin's control and thereby result in his ouster as 
president. 
Impact of the Sanctions  
Uganda was in desperate financial strains during this period and, being landlocked, 
it was dependent on the pro-US government of neighboring Kenya for its international 
trade. Most of the modern sector of the economy had long since shut down, following the 
expulsion of Asians and Amin's indiscriminate persecution of Uganda professionals. 
Agriculture kept the economy going, but production had been declining as farmers

reduced output to subsistence levels. 
Despite its economic problems and heavy dependence on the US market, Uganda 
suffered little from the US trade sanctions. Ugandan officials had been aware for some 
time of official US sentiment regarding Amin's policies because of the steps taken by the 
Carter administration and the discussions in Congress. According to Embassy sources, 
Ugandan envoys were visiting numerous Western and other countries as early as January 
1978 to line up new customers for coffee and other products. Indeed, by the time 
sanctions were in place, US companies had almost completely ended commercial dealings 
with Kampala. In addition, the Kenyan Government continued to provide transit for 
Ugandan trade. Official data indicate Ugandan efforts to locate other buyers were 
largely successful?export receipts during the embargo showed no change from the 
similar period immediately preceding the sanctions. Most of the slack was taken up by 
other Third World countries, although Japan, the United Kingdom, West Germany, and 
Italy also stepped up purchases somewhat (see table 1). 
25X1 
25X1 
On the import side, the US embargo hampered 25X1 
Uganda's ability to obtain petroleum imports. Official Ugandan data show a steady 
decline in oil deliveries, reflecting in our judgment a reluctance by other international oil 
companies to allow Kampala to purchase oil on credit. Embassy sources report that, as a 
result, the government had to contend with more frequent fuel shortages and associated 
disruptions in public transportation. 
Results of the Sanctions  
Although sanctions did not directly bring about a change in Ugandan Government 
policies or the government itself, Embassy reporting suggests the embargo did have an 
indirect role in Amin's political demise. According to conversations between senior 
Tanzanian and US Embassy officials, Washington's decision to terminate commercial 
dealings with Kampala was an important factor in Tanzanian President Nyerere's decision 
to opt for a direct military campaign to remove Amin in October 1978. Nyerere believed

the sanctions were a sign that the international community would not oppose his invasion 
of Uganda. 
Conclusions  
On the surface, the US trade sanctions against Uganda had little going for them. 
o The United States was unable to gain the cooperation of other 
governments in shutting off trade. 
o Uganda was able to find other suppliers and burrs of most of the goods 
traded with the United States.  
Yet, the sanctions ultimately?even if indirectly?achieved the objective of 
bringing about a change in the Ugandan Government because of the political impact they 
had in a third country. 
o President Nyerere of Tanzania interpreted the sanctions to mean that the 
international community would not oppose his invasion of Uganda to remove 
Amin by force.

US SANCTIONS ON IRAN (1980-81) 
Origin and Scope of the Sanctions  
The United States imposed economic sanctions on Iran as part of a larger 
diplomatic strategy to force the release of the American hostages seized by Iranian 
militants on 4 November 1979. The immediate objective of the sanctions was to create 
sufficient economic pressure on Iran to force it to release the hostages. 
Three 'days after the embassy was taken, President Carter ordered a halt to all US 
oil imports from Iran. As the crisis dragged on, the administration also blocked all 
Iranian assets under US control and informally curtailed some exports to Iran?
particularly military equipment already paid for by Tehran. US impatience with 
Khomeini's intransigence with respect to settlement proposals from both Washington and 
the United Nations culminated in Carter's formal prohibition on 7 April 1980 of all 
exports to Iran except food and medicine. In fact, a de facto trade embargo was already 
in place because US longshoremen had earlier refused to load cargo?even food?bound 
for Iran. 
The most controversial US sanction was the blocking of all Iranian assets in the 
United States and those under the control of US banks, businesses, and individuals outside 
the United States. The objectives of this action were, initially, to protect US asset 
claims from Iranian default and, later, to pressure Iran to release the hostages. The US 
decision froze about $12 billion of Iran's bank deposits, gold, and other property under US 
control; about $5.6 billion of these deposits and securities were held in overseas branches 
of US banks, mostly in the United Kingdom. By taking the extraordinary step of 
obstructing the use of these overseas accounts, the United States doubled the amount of 
Iranian assets it could immobilize?including nearly one-half of Iran's official foreign 
exchange reserves.

To make the sanctions work the United States needed the cooperation of its 
allies. To this end US representatives visited several European countries to discuss the 
sanctions from the outset of the crisis. The United States also asked the UN Security 
Council in January 1980 to adopt restrictions on trade and financial transactions with 
Tehran, and in April Secretary of State Vance met in Washington with representatives 
from 25 countries to seek a commitment to the sanctions. 
Concerned about their own self-interest and the wisdom of Washington's hard-line 
economic position, the allies' response was less than enthusiastic. They feared the 
sanctions would threaten their substantial contractual arrangements with Iran and 
generally were skeptical that sanctions would force Tehran to free the hostages. Japan, 
and to a lesser extent, Western Europe counted on Iran to meet oil import needs. 
Following the Soviet veto of the UN resolution, the EC and Japan reluctantly adopted a 
diluted version of the sanctions they had earlier approved during the Security Council 
discussion. 
Although some allies gave tacit approval to the asset freeze, they never did agree 
to the tougher measures that Washington wanted them to impose. Generally, the EC 
agreed at its ministerial meeting in May 1980 to ban: 
o All export contracts retroactive to 4 November, excluding food and 
medicine. 
o All new industrial service contracts. 
o All new supplier credits, loans, or credit guarantees. 
The EC measures also included some financial restrictions on Iranian bank accounts and 
on the purchase of Iranian oil at prices sharply higher than the OPEC benchmark. Japan 
announced similar sanctions in June 1980. These sanctions did not block Iranian assets in 
the allies' banks, contained loopholes, and were not strictly enforced. Moreover, neither 
the EC nor Japan embargoed oil imports from Iran.

? 
Domestic Impact of the Sanctions  
The rationale for the economic sanctions was Iran's heavy dependence on foreign 
trade. In 1979, the United States was Tehran's second largest source of imports, 
following West Germany; the OECD countries accounted for about 70 percent of Iran's 
imports in 1979. Iran relied on imports to meet most of its requirements for capital 
goods, industrial raw materials, military equipment, and consumer goods. Iran's most 
critical import needs at the time of the sanctions were for food and for spare parts for 
the oil industry. 
The economic sanctions apparently had no effect upon Iran's decision to hold the 
hostages. Khomeini's response to the sanctions was even more vituperative than his usual 
criticisms of the United States. Indeed, Khomeini reportedly appeared ecstatic over 
Carter's break of diplomatic relations, calling it a "final victory" for Iran. His control of 
this emotionally-charged issues was so great that Iranians were probably willing to (or 
could be coerced into) suffering economic costs far in excess of those exacted by the 
sanctions. If anything, the hostage crisis consolidated the revolution in the hands of 
Khomeini and the clerics. 
The sanctions exacerbated economic problems in some sectors of the economy but 
did not inflict major new hardships or create insurmountable difficulties. Tehran 
managed to find alternative sources for many denied goods?albeit at much higher 
prices. In other cases, Iran either rationed or fell back on inventories. Because of the 
generally depressed state of the economy, Iran probably would have cut back on imports 
of most trade categories in any event. 
The only sector of the economy to suffer notably from US economic sanctions was 
the transportation sector, which faced a critical shortage of spare parts. By June 1980, 
about half of the civil aircraft fleet?composed mostly of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas 
aircraft?lacked sufficient spare parts. The railroads also were in desperate need of 
spare parts for their American-made locomotives. Iran suffered a general shortage of

car and truck parts as well. 
Stopping the supply of oil field equipment to Iran did not substantially affect 
already depressed crude output. The revolution had put the petroleum industry in 
disarray; the oil worker strike during January-March 1979 and Khomeini's decision to 
lower oil exports caused oil production to tumble 40 percent to an average of 3.2 million 
b/d for 1979. During most of 1980, the high price for Iranian oil in the face of a soft 
world oil market was the main reason oil exports fell further to about 1.6 million b/d; the 
other reason was Iraqi war damage. Nonetheless, Iran had sufficient spare parts and 
excess capacity to keep its oil fields and refineries operating at these reduced levels of 
production without US equipment or technology; even with the sanctions, oil industry 
equipment often could be obtained legally from third parties and foreign subsidiaries of 
US companies. 
Oil income of about $33 million a day gave Iran the financial wherewithal to cope 
with the sanctions. Even without US oil purchases, Iran's oil earnings?which accounted 
for virtually all Iran's income?were more than sufficient to cover the import bill in 1980, 
which was up 34 percent from 1979. Although oil exports to other developed nations also 
declined, these countries still provided an important market for Iran's oil. 
Iran easily circumvented US and EC sanctions on trade. Increased food shipments 
from France, Germany, and Australia more than made up for the loss in US foodstuffs, 
which had accounted for about one-fifth of Iran's food purchases abroad before the 
sanctions. Food imports from the OECD in 1980 rose 30 percent over 1979 to $1.2 
billion. Tehran also turned to the Third World for new sources of food. 
Several West European, Japanese, and even US firms traded embargoed goods with 
Iran in violation of the sanctions, usually through intermediary firms in the UAE and 
Kuwait. Supply arrangements covered a wide range of industrial goods, capital 
equipment, and chemicals all of which fell under the sanctions. US involvement included 
the sale of goods such as engine parts, tires, appliances, and drilling rigs.

? 
The blocking of financial assets did not significantly worsen Iran's economic 
problems, in part because Iran radically changed its portfolio management policies. 
Markazi, Iran's central bank, increased its holdings of gold as a reserve asset. 
The 
share of Iran's official reserves not frozen by the United States amounted to about $8 
billion?the equivalent of almost a year's worth of 1980 imports. In fact, Iran increased 
its reserve holdings during the period of the sanctions. 
Longer Term Impact on Trade  
While the sanctions had little short-term impact on Iran's ability to procure 
needed imports, they did refocus Iran's trading patterns. The sanctions accelerated the 
shift of trade from the West begun before the hostage crisis. To offset the impact of the 
sanctions and to lessen its dependence on the industrialized West, Iran signed economic 
agreements with several Third World countries. Largely as a result, the OECD share of 
Iranian imports fell from 83 percent in 1978 to 66 percent in 1980. 
Iran also strengthened its economic relations with Eastern Europe. Tehran signed 
comprehensive trade agreements with several of these countries to exchange oil for 
foodstuffs, industrial goods, and the technical assistance, equipment, and material to 
construct factories in Iran. In addition, Eastern Europe provided military hardware to 
Iran. Some of these countries helped Iran evade the sanctions by transshipping Western 
spare parts. 
Iran also signed a one-year trade agreement with China in November 1979 calling 
for a doubling of two-way trade over 1978, to roughly $160 million. In May 1980, the two 
countries concluded deal for an unspecified amount of Iranian oil. 
The USSR provided little help to Iran despite a new trade agreement. The Soviets 
were unable to meet Iran's priority need for food because of the USSR's own agricultural

problems. Moreover, the USSR could not supply many of the components needed by 
Iranian industry which was based largely on Western designs. As a result, Iranian 
purchases from the USSR actually declined about $17 million between 1979-80. 
Conclusions  
The US sanctions on Iran by themselves failed to force the early release of the 
hostages or to create substantial problems for the Khomeini regime. 
o The economic impact of the sanctions was small because the Iranian 
economy was already operating far below normal as a result of the 
internal revolution. Moreover, most of the economic pressure that 
should have resulted from the US-imposed trade and financial 
restrictions was relieved by Iran's ability to circumvent the 
sanctions. 
o The United States failed to have the full support of its allies and, 
hence, full control over the value it attempted to deny Tehran. 
o The failure or inability of the United States to substantially reduce 
Iran's oil exports gave the regime the financial wherewithal to 
overcome whatever trade disruption initially occurred. 
o Finally, the United States underestimated the strength of the 
revolutionary movement in Iran, Khomeini's ability to organize and 
control the populace, and the willingness of Iranians to sacrifice to 
the point of martyrdom for what they perceived as a just and 
important cause. 
Iran's war with Iraq probably had more to do with the hostage release than the 
sanctions. Because of the Iraqi invasion in September 1980 Iran desperately needed spare 
parts for the military. War damage to oil facilities and the danger to tankers serving 
Iranian ports, however, eliminated a key source of finance for these purchases. With 
Iran's security threatened, the continuing asset freeze began to have an impact. 
The sanctions were probably more successful when viewed as a response to the 
need to "do something" quickly about Iran's temerity in seizing the hostages. For both 
domestic and international political reasons the United States had to make some show of 
force. Other options, such as military actions, were initially dismissed as inappropriate 
or unlikely to succeed.

US SANCTIONS ON USSR (AFGHANISTAN) (1980-81) 
Background to the Sanctions  
In January 1980, following the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan, the 
United States and the major allies announced a sanctions program against the USSR. All 
the governments involved issued immediate and, in most cases, strong condemnations of 
the Soviet invasion. After consultations, most of the allies initially agreed to back the 
US-led partial grain embargo. The United States, in addition, proposed a number of 
specific economic denial measures covering the supply of other agricultural products, 
various kinds of high-technology goods, and government credits and credit guarantees 
(see chart). Finally, the US Government proposed a Western boycott of the 1980 Olympic 
Games to be held in Moscow. The sanctions effectively ended with the lifting of the 
grain embargo in spring 1981. 25X1 
? Objectives of the Sanctions  
The stated objective of the sanctions was to bring about a withdrawal of Soviet 
troops from Afghanistan. None of the parties to the sanctions, however, was willing to 
intervene militarily to achieve this result, and most were convinced that nothing short of 
? 
force would work. Thus, the primary objective of these sanctions became the unstated 
one of punishing the Soviets for their aggression. Of the economic denial measures 
introduced or suggested, three were aimed at hindering Soviet plans for upgrading- --
consumer diets (grain embargo and denial of superphosphoric acid and fishing rights). 
Several were designed to hinder Soviet efforts to eliminate bottlenecks interfering with 
economic growth (denial of oil and gas equipment, metallurgical equipment, 
communications and automotive equipment, and computers as well as the proposed limits 
on Western government credits). The Olympic boycott was aimed at embarrassing 
Moscow politically, and secondarily at denying the USSR some hard currency.

PRINCIPAL US-PROPOSED ECONOMIC DENIAL MEASURES AGAINST THE USSR 
Agriculture  
o Limit the USSR to purchases of the 8 million tons of US-origin grain guaranteed in 
each of the 1979/80 and 1980/81 US-USSR Long-Term Agreement years (1 October-
30 September accounting basis). 
o Agreement among all the major grain exporters except Argentina not to replace 
denied US grain. 
o Denial of outstanding contracts for oilseeds, meals, and poultry as of 4 January 1980. 
o Ban the sale of processed agricultural products made in foreign countries from US 
raw products (for example, soybean meal made from US beans). 
o Suspend shipments of 1 million tons a year of US-origin superphosphoric acid to the 
USSR. 
o Reduce Soviet fishing quotas in US waters from original 1980 figure of 420,000 tons 
to 75,000 tons. 
Technology  
o Assurances that West European and Japanese firms would not be allowed to bid for 
projects US firms could not pursue because of the suspension order on export 
licenses. 
o A US Government review of all outstanding and pending export license applications 
for sale of equipment and technology to the USSR. 
o Tighter controls on equipment and technology sales to the USSR within COCOM 
channels to include: 
Consideration of a policy on process know-how to include COCOM review of 
any large ($100 million plus) transaction in whieh Western technology 
contributes to the development of Soviet industry in a military-relevant 
area, even if neither the technology nor the equipment is currently on the 
list of COCOM-embargoed items. 
Agreement on new review procedures for fiber optics, lasers, and 
polycrystalline silicon essential in the manufacture of integrated circuits 
(ICs). 
- Agreement on strengthening controls on computer and related software 
sales. 
Other  
o A total cutoff of government-supported credits and guarantees subsequently 
revised to a request for less concessionary terms on new credits.

? 
Compliance with the Sanctions  
The US-proposed sanctions did not draw strong support from US allies, which made 
it clear from the outset that ? for both political and economic reasons ? they wanted to 
keep the door to the Soviet market ajar. Moreover, each was mindful not to take a 
markedly tougher stand on sanctions than its neighbor. In the case of grain, Argentina, a 
major exporter, refused to embargo any sales. The varying degrees of commitment to 
the sanctions meant that acceptance of and compliance with the US proprosals also 
varied. Most countries put a temporary de facto hold on official export credits, but some 
held out longer than others. The national Olympic committees in West Germany, Japan, 
and Canada boycotted the Olympic Games; the committees in Britain, France, and Italy 
did not boycott, although participation was limited. 
In the months immediately following the US introduction of sanctions the debate 
over the issues had a divisive effect on the Western affiance. The West Europeans, in 
particular, were highly critical of the Carter administration's handling of the matter, 
claiming that the United States had no long-term strategy for dealing with the Soviets 
and that the United States did not appreciate the West Europeans' position on their 
relationship with the USSR and the need to keep channels of communication open. The 
debate, however, served to heighten awareness of the need for greater policy 
coordination in dealing with the Soviets. A consensus was reached on the need to 
strengthen COCOM, for example, even though the parties did not agree on the means. In 
addition, the discussion involving the US request for less concessional terms on new 
credits to the USSR helped lay the groundwork for the 1982 OECD decision to move the 
USSR into a higher rate category for official export credits. 
By the spring of 1981 the United States had decided that the domestic political 
costs of the partial grain embargo were too high relative to its effect on the USSR. US 
farmers?the group most affected by the sanctions?had lost grain and soybean sales to 
the USSR worth perhaps $1.3 billion.

The lifting of the US grain embargo further weakened allied support for other US 
sanctions. Western governments acted quickly to protect their commercial interests. 
The EC eliminated restrictions on sales of grain to the USSR and planned to resume 
subsidies on exports of grain and other agricultural products. The Canadians, who were 
taking advantage of the US embargo to pry better terms out of Moscow for grain, 
dropped that tactic and rushed to sign a five-year agreement. On the non-agricultural 
front, Tokyo began to argue that US lifting of the grain embargo gave Japan a freer hand 
in selling high-technology products to the USSR, although within COCOM the "no 
exceptions" policy on sales of embargoed technology has not been formally abandoned. 
Result of the Sanctions  
In the case of the grain embargo, the USSR was able to replace only 9 million tons 
of the 17 million tons denied by the United States between January and end-September 
1980. Thus, total grain imports for the 1979/80 Long-Term Agreement year (October-
September) were roughly 25 percent below the expected level. In the 1980/81 LTA year, 
however, Moscow was able to line up nearly all the grain its ports could handle while 
relying on the United States for only 9.5 million tons, or one-fourth of the total as 
compared with nearly two-thirds in the year prior to the embargo. The roughly 1.5 
milliort tons of soybeans and soybean meal denied by the United States in 1980 LTA year 
were fully replaced by Argentina and firms in Western Europe. In fact, EC, Canadian, 
and Australian grain exports to the USSR all increased in 1980 compared with 1979. 
_ 
The sanctions resulted in some delay in Moscow's effort to upgrade its domestic 
fertilizer industry. The United States is the only large-volume source of superphosphoric 
acid (SPA)?a chemical that the Soviet "liquid complex" fertilizer plants purchased from 
France were designed specifically to use. The suspension of US SPA sales between early 
1980 and mid-1981 delayed the liquid complex fertilizer program by more than a year

because most of the available phosphoric acid was of a lower grade and unsuitable for use 
in the program. 
Western sanctions probably did not impair Soviet industrial production 
appreciably, in large part because France, West Germany, and Japan did not fully support 
restrictions on trade in technology and equipment. While orders by the Soviets for 
Western machinery and equipment fell dramatically for a while, new Western contracts 
to supoly equipment rebounded in second- half 1980. Nevertheless, the interruption in US 
technology sales retarded some urgently needed modernization in the USSR. For 
example, Soviet oil and gas exploration schedules were set back by delays in granting 
export licenses for such items as drillships and rigs. The revocations of licenses for the 
Dresser drill bit plant complicated efforts to improve drilling efficiency. And US denial 
of computer parts and assembly line equipment has further hampered an already lagging 
Soviet effort to double production capacity for diesel engines at the Kama truck plant. 
The impact of these denials, however, is likely to diminish over time as West European 
and Japanese firms continue to step in as US replacements. 
The boycott of the Olympics deprived Moscow of the prestige and propaganda 
opportunities it hoped to extract from well-run, non-controversial games. It had little 
effect on Soviet hard currency earnings, however, because most of the receipts from 
tourism and broadcast rights had been prepaid. 
On the political side, the economic sanctions heightened the debate within the 
USSR between advocates of expanding trade with the West and those favoring greater. 
autarky. Sanctions served to strengthen the hand of those favoring self-sufficiency who 
have long argued that the USSR is dissipating its patrimony by exporting vital raw 
materials for Western technology. Thus, the denial measures introduced an element of 
uncertainty at a time when Soviet officials were putting the finishing touches on the 
1981-85 plan and reinforced doubts within the leadership about the viability of USSR-

Western trade over the long term. The sanctions have not, however, deterred Moscow 
from pursuing its goals in Afghanistan. 
Conclusions  
The sanctions against the USSR following its intervention in Afghanistan illustrate 
the difficulty of implementing economic denial measures on a multilateral basis even 
though potential sponsors generally agreed on the objectives, both stated and unstated. 
o The United States and others were unable to control supplies of grain 
to the Soviet Union because a major grain exporter refused to 
participate in the embargo. 
o The intensity of the US commitment to the grain embargo was affected 
by domestic political considerations. 
o Apart from the grain embargo, there was no consensus among the 
major sponsors on how to carry out the objectives. 
The sanctions did achieve, in some measure, the objective of punishing the Soviets for 
their aggression: 
o 1980 grain imports were reduced by 8 million tons and restrictions on 
sales of superphosphoric acid delayed the liquid complex fertilizer 
program thus adversely affecting Soviet plans to upgrade consumer 
diets. 
o Interruption of US technology sales delayed industrial modernization 
efforts.

? EC SANCTIONS ON ARGENTINA (1982) 
? 
Background to the Sanctions  
On April 2, 1982, Argentina militarily occupied the Falkland (Malvinas) Islands. 
The following day the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 502, which demanded 
immediate cessation of hostilities and withdrawal of Argentine troops and called on 
Argentina and the .UnitedKingdom to resolve their differences diplomatically. 
The United Kingdom immediately dispatched a fleet toward the islands invoking 
the right of self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter. On 3 April Prime Minister 
Thatcher froze Argentine assets in the United Kingdom. This move was quickly followed 
by a ban on trade with Argentina. 
In addition to bilateral action the United Kingdom embarked on a comprehensive 
worldwide diplomatic campaign to apply maximum pressure on Argentina to withdraw its 
troops and resort to a negotiated solution to the territorial dispute over the Falklands. 
On 6 April at a meeting of the permanent representatives of the EC 10 in Brussels the 
United Kingdom requested a firm show of EC solidarity and implied that it would like to 
see a total ban on imports from Argentina. The EC responded to the British request on 
16 April by agreeing to a 30-day ban on imports from Argentina. This was the sternest 
punitive measure ever taken by the EC, although it was not as comprehensive as the 
British had requested. 
As the British fleet approached the Falldands and it became clear that the United 
Kingdom would not negotiate while Argentine troops remained on the islands, EC 
solidarity faded. Ireland publicly stated that it opposed British use of force to regain the 
islands. The Italian Government was under strong domestic pressure to lift the sanctions, 
primarily because of cultural and ethnic links to Argentina. Other members, such as the 
Netherlands and Denmark, were concerned that the sanctions were becoming irrelevant

to the conflict. They argued that if an invasion were to take place, the sanctions would 
have failed to achieve their primary objective of forcing negotiations. 
Unable to achieve the unanimity required to renew the Community-mandated 
sanctions by 16 May, the EC Foreign Ministers announced action by their separate 
governments to maintain economic pressure on Argentina. Ireland and Italy stated they 
would avoid "distortions of trade," which meant they intended to resume imports from 
Argentina but not for cross-trade purposes. The Danish Government renewed its 
sanctions pending parliamentary adoption of national measures for sanctions. The 
remaining six member states announced a renewal of the existing sanctions for one week. 
A week later, on 24 May, the EC Foreign Ministers met again to discuss the 
sanctions issue. This tithe it was announced that the members would extend indefinitely 
the separate national measures announced the previous week. 
After the fall of Port Stanley, the British wanted to maintain the sanctions until 
Argentina formally agreed to end hostilities. However, on 21 June the EC announced 
that economic measures would be lifted by the member states the following day. The EC 
noted that some of the Ten that had introduced arms embargoes on a national basis would 
continue these measures for the time being. 
Objectives of the Sanctions  
The explicit goal of the sanctions was to pressure Argentina to comply with UN 
Security Council resolution 502, which demanded Argentine withdrawal from the 
Falldands and resumption of negotiations to settle the dispute. The relative importance 
of EC trade to the Argentine economy led many Europeans to conclude that the trade 
embargo would exert considerable pressure on the Argentine regime to come to the 
negotiating table. 
An important unstated motive of the EC sanctions was to demonstrate that the 
Community would respond to a clear-cut case of aggression against one of its members.

25X1 
Unlike controversial sanction cases such as Poland and Afghanistan, where the 
Community was divided on the appropriate form of action, Argentina had attacked an EC 
member state. Many EC countries felt that Argentina's sense of international isolation 
would be increased by EC solidarity. 
Finally, the continental EC countries were conscious of the growing unpopularity 
of the EC within the United Kingdom and of the United Kingdom within the EC. EC 
agricultural policies and the cost of EC participation were sensitive domestic political 
issues for Thatcher's conservative government. Decisive political support from the EC 
on the Falklands issue was seen as a possible way to increase the EC political standing in 
the United Kingdom while coaxing the Thatcher government to be more compromising on 
internal Community issues. 
Impact of the Sanctions  
The specific sanctions imposed by the EC were far short of the comprehensive 
measures taken by the United Kingdom. They applied only to imports from Argentina 
and were for a 30-day period. Specifically exempted from the sanctions were contracts 
that had already been signed and shipments underway. Given the amount of Argentine 
goods subject to long-term contracts and the length of time it takes to ship goods from 
Argentina to the EC, most trade was not affected -by the ban. 
Only if the 30-day ban had been extended would the measures taken collectively 
by the EC have had practical effect. It was clear from the outset, however, that renewal 
of the sanctions would be difficult, given the unwritten procedural requirement for 
unanimity within the Community and the reluctance of Ireland and Italy to support 
continued sanctions. It was the symbolic gesture of the EC decision that was intended to 
produce diplomatic and psychological effects. 
The EC sanctions were not nearly as effective as the separate actions of 
particular states. Both France and West Germany were strong supporters of the British 
and quickly moved to impose arms embargoes on Argentina. Other arms suppliers

? 
including Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, and Norway also 
cut off arms sales. Since Europe was the primary supplier of arms to Argentina, access 
to military equipment was almost completely restricted. 
EC sanctions were part of the broader context of the diplomatic and economic 
pressure being applied against Argentina. In a wide variety of multilateral forums 
Argentina found little support for its military action. In the Security Council and the EC 
there was explicit condemnation. Argentina was unable to gain Nonaligned Movement 
support for its positions in the UNGA, UNCTAD, GATT or even UNESCO. The response 
of the OAS was largely rhetorical, and moderate Latin states insisted on watering down 
Argentine resolutions so that they would have no legal effect. 
Results of the Sanctions  
In spite of Argentine vulnerability to economic sanctions the nature of the dispute 
between Argentina and the United Kingdom reduced the leverage of economic coercion. 
It became clear as the crisis developed that Prime Minister Thatcher had broad 
domestic political support to retake the Falklands by force. Within the Conservative 
Party she would have faced strong opposition to a negotiated settlement that did not 
achieve total Argentine withdrawal without any commitment on the sovereignty issue. 
President Galtieri and the military government had little room to negotiate. 
National sentiment favored retaking the Falklands. As it became clear that a favorable 
diplomatic settlement was unlikely, the leadership decided that it would be better to 
surrender on the battlefield after an honorable fight than to surrender at the negotiating 
table. 
The sanctions combined with other factors, however, may have kept the military 
conflict in bounds. Although Argentine leaders decided to fight in the Falklands rather 
than negotiate withdrawal, there was also talk of a protracted war against Britain. Had

Britain stood alone this might have been a more attractive policy alternative; but with 
the Argentine economy already weak, little prospect of resupply of military equipment, 
and with the threat of renewal of the EC ban on imports this was not a realistic option. 
Conclusions  
The EC sanctions against Argentina are the classic case of a diplomatic gesture. 
At little cost the Community demonstrated solidarity with a member state which had 
been the victim of aggression. Had the sanctions been in effect for a lengthy period 
their economic impact might have provided incentive to Argentina to remove the troops 
and return to the negotiating process. However, the intransigent positions of both the 
United Kingdom and Argentina and the British willingness to use force to prompt a rapid 
resolution of the crisis meant that economic sanctions had little influence in resolving 
the conflict.

Effectiveness of Sanctions 
To judge the effectiveness of economic sanctions we developed a set of "best 
case" criteria. Sanctions will accomplish their goals most effectively when: 
o The sponsor country has something of value that is critically important 
to the target country and can prohibit its acquisition. 
o The sponsor can monitor compliance with the sanctions. 
o The target has no alternative source of supply or, in the case of a 
boycott, no alternate market. 
o The country imposing sanctions is strongly committed to them while 
the target is not strongly committed to the conduct that triggered 
sanctions. 
o The economic and political cost of the  sanctions is high for the target 
and low for the sponsor. 
We have found no instances in which such optimal conditions existed when sanctions were 
imposed. Nevertheless, the ideal case serves as a benchmark against which to measure 
the effectiveness of economic sanctions. 
We then compared actual sanctions with the theoretical best case. To do this we: 
o Disaggregated the sanctions into seven component parts. 
o Determined the relative importance of each component to the 
sanctions process, using a scale of zero to 10. 
o Determined the prospects for successfully implementing each 
component. 
o Aggregated the judgments about each component and compared the 
result with the ideal case. 
The resulting index number, although highly subjective, provides some indication of the 
probability of successfully applying sanctions in a particular case. The higher the 
number, the more likely sanctions are to be effective. Visually, the more black 
appearing in the bars, the more likely the sanctions are to be effective.
