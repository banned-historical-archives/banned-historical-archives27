 Reformers
 China's Economy in 1985:
 A Test for Reform and
 Problems associated with the implementation of major economic reforms
 arose in full force in 1985, severely testing the economic skills and political
 resolve of China's reformers. According to Chinese statistics and press
 reports:
 ? Confusion surrounding new agricultural policies was compounded by
 poor weather, causing grain output to fall for the first time in five years.
 ? Industrial output, spurred by economic incentives and relaxed central
 controls, grew at an excessive 18-percent rate, increasing the strain on
 China's inadequate infrastructure.
 ? Inflation tripled, the trade deficit grew to almost $7 billion, and foreign
 exchange reserves declined 29 percent.
 ? Low-level officials took advantage of relaxed controls to engage in price
 gouging, speculation, and fraud.
 Although industrial production has slowed since July, Beijing remains
 concerned with inflation, excessive investment spending, and the large
 trade deficit. In major speeches in early 1986, Chinese leaders called for a
 period of consolidation and adjustment in the reform program, and Premier
 Zhao Ziyang stated in January that no major price reforms would be
 implemented this year. Reform leaders emphasize that the readjustment
 period will be temporary, and they have indicated that important reforms
 are being contemplated for 1987. For this year, however, we look for the
 Chinese to try to curb imports and expand exports; make more selective use
 of foreign exchange reserves; increase incentives for grain production; and
 emphasize efficiency, profitability, and specialization in industry.
 Beijing's success in making these adjustments will have important implica-
 tions for China's economic relations with the United States. Because of
 China's large trade deficit and declining foreign exchange holdings, Beijing
 will push hard for increased sales to the United States of oil, light
 manufactures, and textiles. In addition, China may restrain domestic
 consumption and try to increase exports of corn and soybeans to Japan,
 South Korea, and the Soviet Union-making small, but noticeable inroads
 into traditional markets for US grain. Planned restrictions on imports of
 consumer durables and production lines that process foreign-supplied
 components will probably have a greater impact on East Asian trading
 partners than on the United States; the Chinese will continue to purchase
 technologically advanced industrial equipment from US suppliers.

 To conserve foreign exchange, China has also decided to slow or postpone
 major infrastructure projects-such as construction of a nuclear power
 plant near Shanghai-for which US firms expected to compete. And
 increased restrictions on the use of foreign exchange may make joint
 ventures with China less attractive to US investors.
 Finally, Beijing appears resigned to cover part of its expected trade deficit
 with increased commercial borrowing from the world financial market. At
 a meeting in March with US Embassy officers in Beijing, Chinese banking
 officials stated that the government was willing to increase China's debt
 service ratio from the current 5 to 7 percent to 15 percent by 1990-
 implying that China might borrow more than $25 billion over the next five
 years. Increased Chinese commercial borrowing would provide new oppor-
 tunities for US banks to benefit from Beijing's opening to the West, as well
 as greater competition for international investment funds.
 The success of the economic adjustment period will also have important
 implications for the political strength of the reform coalition. Reformers
 are under pressure from party opponents to show better results from their
 policies. When the extent of economic problems became evident last year,
 tensions within the leadership rose quickly-with conservatives attacking
 Deng Xiaoping and his supporters for excessively decentralizing economic
 decision making and weakening the role of central planning. Reform
 leaders acknowledged the economic problems, but defended the reforms
 and pointed to significant gains during the year-such as an estimated 11-
 to 12-percent increase in real GNP, an 8-percent jump in energy produc-
 tion, and a sharp increase in government revenues that allowed Beijing to
 record a budget surplus for the first time since 1978.
 Conservatives thus were not able to exploit economic difficulties for
 political gains, but the pace of reform, nevertheless, slowed sharply during
 the latter part of the year. Popular disenchantment with the reform
 program surfaced in the form of protests by university students and
 grumbling about rising food prices. In our view, Beijing's greatest single
 challenge will be to maintain price stability, if it is to keep the conserva-
 tives at bay and implement further reforms in 1987.

 We believe there is a better-than-even chance that Beijing will be able to
 slow economic growth and ease pressure on prices, thereby setting the stage
 for reforms next year. But because Chinese leaders lack experience
 managing a partially decentralized economy, and because pressures for
 rapid growth exist throughout the country, we expect China will continue
 to experience periods of excessive growth and inflation-followed by
 government-induced retrenchment-as Beijing implements additional re-
 forms. The fluctuations in China's economic growth, in turn, will impart a
 "stop and go" character to Beijing's reform program during the next five
 years.

 China's Economy in 1985:
 A Test for Reform and
 Reformers
 China's economic performance in 1985 was driven by
 the expanded economic reform program adopted by
 the Central Committee in October 1984. Relaxed
 central controls sparked significant gains in produc-
 tion, but economic policy makers had difficulty steer-
 ing the economy through the transition to a more
 market-oriented system. Reform-related problems be-
 came embroiled in the party and government debate
 over the Seventh Five-Year Plan (for 1986-90}-the
 draft of which was approved in April by China's
 National People's Congress (NPC). Although the
 draft reaffirmed China's commitment to economic
 reform, Beijing has announced that 1986 will be a
 year for consolidating and improving past policies.
 Beijing's ability to reestablish economic stability this
 year will play a key role in determining reform
 policies for the rest of the plan period.

 Since the economic reforms were launched in 1979,
 agriculture has been the centerpiece of Beijing's effort
 to improve economic efficiency. Although agricultural
 reforms are still the most important success of the
 reform program-the gross value of agricultural out-
 put increased at an average annual rate of 11 percent
 from 1981 to 1984-growth rates fell in 1985. Ac-
 cording to China's State Statistical Bureau, agricul-
 tural output increased only 3 percent last year.'
 After three consecutive years of record harvests, grain
 output fell 7 percent in 1985 (see figure 1)-as a result
 of reduced acreage, flood damage, and confusion over
 reforms that eliminated grain quotas in favor of a
 market-oriented contract system. Rapidly developing
 rural industries also pulled peasants away from less
 lucrative grain production.' Reform leaders maintain,
 however, that surpluses from previous years will more
 than make up for the shortfall.
 Notwithstanding the smaller harvest, China became a
 net grain exporter in 1985. According to Chinese
 trade data, China exported over 9 million metric tons
 of grain last year-almost triple the 1984 level.
 Chinese grain imports were approximately 5.4 million
 tons-with about 800,000 tons coming from the
 United States (see figure 2).

 Efforts to diversify agricultural production were bol-
 stered by officially sanctioned price hikes. Outputs of
 sugarcane, peanuts, rapeseed, and sesame increased
 by more than 25 percent last year, according to
 Chinese press reports. Production of meat increased
 by 14 percent, and eggs by 23 percent.
 Overly Rapid Industrial Growth
 China's industrial output increased 18 percent last
 year, according to Chinese statistics, continuing a
 trend of double-digit growth in industrial production
 that began in 1983 (see figure 3). During the first half
 of 1985, industrial output expanded at a 23-percent
 annual rate, but efforts to cool the economy reduced
 the growth rate to 10 percent in the fourth quarter'
 (see figure 4).
 Rural industry was the fastest growing sector of
 China's economy for the second year in a row.
 Chinese media reported that the output value of rural
 factories shot up by 35 percent and accounted for
 almost one third of total industrial production. In
 light industry, buoyant consumer demand sustained a
 boom in the production of electrical home appliances.
 Output of washing machines, electric fans, and televi-
 sion sets increased over 50 percent, and production of
 refrigerators more than doubled. Production of build-
 ing materials, heavy equipment, and machinery gen-
 erally increased more than 15 percent during the year,
 while production of rolled steel increased about 9
 percent.
 We believe, on the basis of incomplete statistical
 evidence, that rapid industrial growth has been caused
 by skyrocketing investment spending-up by 35 per-
 cent in 1985-and a surge in wages and bonuses for

 tons. Recent gains in production have been the result
 of policies that eased restrictions on private and
 collective small-scale mining operations, that per-
 mitted state mines to sell overquota production at free
 market prices, and that rewarded workers for in-
 creased productivity.
 China produced about 2.5 million barrels of oil per
 day (compared with 2.3 million in 1984), exporting
 one-fourth of the total. Gains in oil production were a
 result of new finds and improved recovery technol-
 ogies. Increases in electric power generation came
 largely from completion of new coal-fired facilities
 and increased deliveries of coal to power plants.
 Loosened central oversight of foreign trade and a
 surge in investment and consumer spending led to a
 flood of imports-up 54 percent last year, according
 to our estimates based on partner trade data. Because
 of the surge in domestic production, Chinese exports
 increased by about 13 percent-leaving Beijing with a
 1985 trade deficit of $6.9 billion.' Because of the
 deficit, China's foreign exchange reserves fell by
 almost one-third during 1985, and China devalued its
 currency about 12 percent against the US dollar (from

 industrial workers. Successful rural reforms have
 increased the availability of raw materials for indus-
 trial use, while boosting rural incomes and fueling
 consumer demand. Rapid industrial growth also has
 been facilitated by industrial reforms, particularly
 those allowing enterprises to sell overquota production
 at prices above the state-set levels. To a lesser extent,
 rapid growth last year may have been caused by the
 technical modernization of some segments of Chinese
 industry-such as steel, textiles, and electronic prod-
 Significant Gains in Energy Production
 China's production of both coal and electricity in-
 creased about 8 percent last year, and oil output grew
 9 percent.' China was the world's second-largest coal
 producer in 1985, with output topping 850 million
 2.8 yuan/dollar to 3.2 yuan/dollar).6
 ' Customs data reported by China's State Statistical Bureau show
 exports increasing less than 5 percent last year, giving China a
 trade deficit of $14.9 billion. The discrepancy between Chinese
 customs data and partner trade data results, in part, from differ-
 ences in accounting practices. First, China's customs data includes
 the costs of insurance and freight in its import totals, and excludes
 them from its export totals-which inflates the reported trade
 deficit. Using International Monetary Fund methodology to ex-
 clude the costs of insurance and freight from import values, China's     25X1
 trade deficit would be $11.4 billion. Second, we believe that China
 includes in its import totals payments for certain services-such as
 training, blueprints, and royalties-that are related to capital goods
 imports. This may inflate China's reported trade deficit by over $1
 billion, relative to partner trade data. In our judgment, the
 discrepancy between Chinese customs data and partner trade data
 may also result from attempts by Chinese traders to circumvent
 their customs service through smuggling, underreporting the value
 of their exports, and overreporting the value of their imports.
 6 China's currency is inconvertible. The State Administration of
 Exchange Control (an organ of the central bank) adjusts its value

 Strong industrial growth, rising prices, and increased
 tariffs on some imports pushed up government reve-
 nues by over 24 percent in 1985, despite difficulties-
 including widespread tax evasion-in implementing a
 new tax system. The gains in revenue allowed Beijing
 to record a budget surplus of 2.8 billion yuan ($880
 million), the first since 1978 (see figure 5). Chinese
 accounting practices, however, record government
 bond sales and Ministry of Finance foreign exchange
 borrowing from Chinese banks as revenue. As mea-
 sured by Western standards, China's budget had a
 deficit of about $2.7 billion dollars.
 Although Chinese leaders tout rapid growth as an
 indicator that industrial reforms are working, media
 commentaries suggest that Beijing is concerned that a
 continuation of the fast-paced expansion will exacer-
 bate longstanding economic problems, heighten social
 tensions, and undermine reform efforts. Despite the
 sharp increases in production of coal, oil, and electric-
 ity last year, energy supplies in China are strained.
 Additions to the transportation network have not kept
 pace with the growth in industrial output, and the
 system remains seriously overburdened. Chinese me-

 tion.
 Chinese media reports also suggest that key reform
 goals, such as improvements in industrial efficiency
 and product quality, are being undermined by the
 rapid growth. Beijing acknowledges that higher out-
 put in some cases is caused not by efficiency gains but
 by the use of large amounts of inputs. A Hong Kong
 newspaper reported that losses by state-owned enter-
 prises were up by over 9 percent during the first nine
 months of last year. Press reports also suggest that
 rapid growth is wearing out equipment at excessive
 rates, increasing occupational hazards in factories,
 and generating higher levels of environmental pollu-
 in March 1986,
 Premier Zhao Ziyang acknowledged that recent out-
 put levels were possible only because China imported
 large amounts of raw materials and industrial compo-
 nents. Imports of rolled steel last year, for example,
 were equivalent to one-half of China's total rolled
 steel production, yet China's machinery industries            25X1
 experienced shortages of rolled steel-as well as pig
 iron, copper, zinc, and other raw materials-during          25X1
 the year. We believe Beijing recognizes that its
 industrial development cannot be based on imports of
 raw materials and equipment, and that its foreign
 exchange holdings cannot sustain such high rates of
 growth.                                        25X1
 When their accelerated reform program was approved
 in 1984, reformers claimed that increased competition
 between state-owned enterprises would spur improve-
 ments in the quality of products. The shortages caused
 by strong demands for consumer and investment
 goods, however, have actually eased pressure on firms

 weakness" of China's economy.
 Although output grew rapidly in 1985, it was not
 sufficient to meet the demand for consumer durables,
 industrial equipment, and building materials. China's
 retail price index showed prices rising 8.8 percent,
 triple the rate in 1984. Beijing probably is concerned
 that rising prices will jeopardize popular support for
 economic reforms. Although large increases in wages
 and bonuses have cushioned the impact of -higher
 prices for some consumers, a jump in retail food prices
 caused widespread complaints among urban residents,
 and the rising cost of living was a factor in protests by
 university students last fall.
 When the extent of the economic problems became
 known last year, political tensions within the leader-
 ship rose-with conservatives attacking reform lead-
 ers for economic mismanagement. We believe that the
 political strength of the reform coalition and the
 increased economic sophistication of its leaders was
 evident in Beijing's reaction to the economic problems
 in 1985. Chinese leaders did not halt reforms and try
 to dampen the overheated economy abruptly by reim-
 posing strict administrative controls-as they might
 have in the past. Instead, after industrial output
 increased at a 23-percent annual rate during the first
 quarter of 1985, they implemented a combination of
 market-oriented macroeconomic adjustments and
 state directives to slow the economy gradually.
 China's 1985 budget, announced that April, called for
 narrowing the budget deficit by slowing the growth of
 government spending. In particular, Beijing ordered a
 10-percent cut in administrative expenditures. Beijing
 also began pursuing a tight money policy:
 ? In April, Beijing raised interest rates on time depos-
 its and on loans for working funds. In August,
 Beijing boosted rates on capital construction loans
 and again hiked time deposit rates.
 ? Lacking an established secondary market for gov-  25X1
 ernment securities, China's central bank cannot
 conduct open market operations. Instead, Beijing      25X1
 reduces the money supply by increasing sales of
 goods from state-run stores. To soak up excess
 currency, Beijing announced that it would use $2
 billion in foreign exchange reserves to import scarce
 consumer durables,' and the Ministry of Commerce
 was ordered to mark down prices of overstocked
 domestic commodities and increase sales to the
 public. Banking authorities also made vigorous ef-
 forts to collect savings deposits from households-
 including mobile bank teams that went door to door.
 To slow growth, Beijing ordered a halt in some capital
 construction projects. Many other administrative con-
 trols were employed through China's banking system:
 ? According to official statements, China's central
 bank was ordered to set and enforce quarterly credit
 limits for its branches and the specialized banks
 (such as the Agricultural Bank and the Industrial
 and Commercial Bank).
 ? Banks were ordered to stop offering loans to ineffi-
 cient enterprises and to firms that produce poor-
 quality products.
 ? Banks were prohibited from extending credit for
 capital construction projects whose spending ex-
 ceeds the state quota or for projects not listed in the
 state plan.
 ? To prevent indiscriminate increases in wages and      25X1
 bonuses, enterprises were required to place wage
 funds in special accounts to be monitored by the
 banks. Apparently, the payroll accounts of some
 units were frozen.

 exchange set aside may have been announced, in part, to put a
 better gloss on the surge in imports of consumer durables that was

 Western economists have been cautious about accept-
 ing Chinese economic statistics at face value. Like
 those of most developing countries, China's statistical
 collection and measurement techniques are crude,
 and economic data sometimes are deliberately dis-
 torted at local levels. Our concerns with the reliabil-
 ity of Chinese statistics have been heightened in the
 past year by the very rapid industrial growth rates
 reported by Beijing and by the sharp changes in
 values of other economic indicators, such as the trade
 balance and foreign exchange reserves.
 Although we generally have confidence in gross pro-
 duction statistics for individual products-particu-
 larly in heavy industry-we believe recent figures
 may overstate Chinese industrial performance for a
 number of reasons:
 ? Enterprises increasingly purchase semifinished
 goods and industrial components from other firms
 rather than manufacture the inputs themselves, and
 these transactions may be recorded in calculations
 of overall industrial output.
 ? Although industrial output in urban areas is mea-
 sured in constant prices, the output of rural indus-
 tries is not adjusted for inflation.
 ? On occasion, production data may be exaggerated
 by local officials and enterprise managers.
 Nevertheless, we believe the economy grew at a very
 rapid pace last year, albeit more slowly than Chinese
 figures indicated.
 Although industrial production has slowed since mid-
 1985, statements by Chinese leaders at the recent
 NPC suggest to us that Beijing remains very con-
 cerned with inflation, excessive investment spending,
 and its large trade deficit. We believe Beijing will
 continue to tighten control over credit and capital
 construction this year.
 We also have noticed some anomalies in other eco-
 nomic data released by Beijing:
 ? Cotton. Beijing implemented policies last year to
 reduce cotton production, and China's State Statis-
 tical Bureau reported a 33 percent drop in output.
 On the basis of weather patterns and acreage
 planted, however, we believe the actual decrease
 was less than Beijing reported.
 ? Trade Balance. China's Customs Bureau and the
 Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
 each publish an estimate of China's balance of
 trade. The two estimates for 1985 differed by over
 $7 billion (neither accorded with projections based
 on partner trade data). Although each calculation is
 based on different accounting methods, the differ-
 ence between the estimates appears to have widened
 more than can be explained by the growth in
 China's trade.
 ? Foreign Exchange Reserves. Last year, Beijing ap-
 parently changed the way it calculated foreign
 exchange reserves to include its holdings of foreign
 government securities. Although not officially ac-
 knowledged by Beijing, the change does explain
 why China's foreign exchange reserves appeared to
 increase $1.7 billion between June and September
 even though trade deficits (according to Chinese
 customs figures) averaged about $1 billion a month
 during the quarter.
 In addition to macroeconomic problems, Beijing has
 been confronted with rampant economic corruption,
 with some of the worst cases caused by party officials.
 Although Chinese leaders probably expected that an
 increase in economic corruption would accompany a

 and the output of rural industries.
 In our judgment, the reliability of Chinese statistics
 may have been eroded somewhat by recent economic
 decentralization, China's statistical reporting system
 was set up to measure the performance of a planned
 economy, but economic reforms have decreased the
 portion of the economy operating under direct state
 controls. Beijing may be having difficulties accurate-
 ly recording and valuing outside-of-plan production
 included in the totals.
 We believe China's top officials probably do not
 deliberately distort economic statistics. Beijing, how-
 ever, is not above `packaging" data for political
 purposes. For instance, last year Beijing announced
 that the output of village industries would henceforth
 be included in the total for gross value of industrial
 output (GVIO), instead of in the total for gross value
 of agricultural output (GVAO)-as had been the case.
 When the 1985 State Statistical Communique was
 released, however, the output totals presented first
 were calculated according to the old system. Because
 village industries were the most rapidly growing
 sector in China's economy, their inclusion in the
 GVAO statistic made agricultural and industrial
 growth appear better balanced. In other press reports,
 statistics for GVIO have been presented without
 qualification as to whether village industries are
 loosening of central controls, they may have been
 startled by the extent of the problem. During the past
 year, the Chinese media have reported numerous
 examples of illegal price hikes, fraud, bribery, smug-
 gling, and black market trading of foreign currencies.
 Three of the most egregious cases uncovered by
 Beijing were:
 ? The Hainan Island Case. Island authorities took
 advantage of development policies that allowed
 Notwithstanding the potential problems with Chinese
 accounting methods, we report official statistics for
 the following reasons:
 ? We believe Chinese leaders base decisions on the
 official data that is released publicly. Although
 leaders undoubtedly receive confidential reports on
 economic performance, we believe the government
 does not have a separate data set that is markedly
 more accurate than the information released by the
 State Statistical Bureau. Changes in the values of
 official economic statistics often provide us a means
 to predict accurately changes in Beijing's economic
 policy.
 ? We believe growth rates give accurate qualitative
 indicators of economic performance. For instance,
 Chinese price indexes probably understate inflation,
 but changes in the indexes may generally reflect the
 inflation trend.
 ? Sometimes we are able to verify official statistics
 indirectly. Reported gains in oil production, for
 instance, correspond with increases in Chinese oil
 exports (which can be verified from partner trade
 data).
 economic trends in China.
 We believe official statistics, when interpreted with
 some caution, provide a generally accurate picture of
 tariff-free imports of some products to purchase
 Japanese cars, television sets, and other consumer
 durables and illegally resell them in the interior of
 China. Before central authorities stepped in, Hai-
 nan entities had arranged to import almost $1
 billion worth of cars. On the basis of reports by the
 Hong Kong media, we believe that broad elements
 of the party, government, and military forces took
 part in the scheme.

 ? The Fake Medicine Case. In one prefecture in
 Fujian Province, 45 enterprises manufactured coun-
 terfeit brand-name medicines, which were marketed
 throughout China. According to press reports, local
 officials protected the counterfeiters for over two
 years. The case was judged to be so serious that it
 was mentioned in a major speech at a national party
 conference in September 1985.
 ? The Liu Haoran Case. An itinerant ex-convict set
 up a dummy trading company and, in less than six
 months, signed fraudulent contracts worth 7.85
 billion yuan (almost $2.5 billion) with Chinese orga-
 nizations. Promising to deliver scarce goods in re-
 turn for a down payment, Liu collected more than
 19.7 million yuan (over $6 million).
 Last year Beijing also combated a proliferation of
 companies established by party and government
 officials. Chinese media reported that these officials
 used their influence to obtain goods in short supply
 and reaped windfall profits by marking up prices. In
 one case, local officials threatened a bank manager
 with loss of party membership if he did not lend them
 money for their company. Recently, the Hong Kong
 press has reported that children of senior officials
 have been involved in illegal dealings while managing
 large Chinese trading companies
 Party conservatives-with Politburo Standing Com-
 mittee member Chen Yun the rallying point-took
 advantage of economic problems to press Deng
 Xiaoping to slow the pace and narrow the scope of
 reforms. In May 1985, a party newspaper for intellec-
 tuals published a series of articles that drew parallels
 between the rapid growth China was experiencing and
 the 1958-60 Great Leap Forward-which Chen had
 opposed. Two months later, the party theoretical
 journal published an incendiary article that praised
 Chen's leadership of the economy in the 1940s and
 1950s and disparaged current decisionmaking on eco-
 nomic policy. Chen delivered a sharp public criticism
 at a party conference in September, warning that the
 fall in grain production threatened economic stability.
 Chen also rebuked reformers on theoretical grounds,
 arguing that "market regulation involves no planning,
 blindly allowing supply and demand to determine
 production ... planning is the essence of macroeco-
 nomic control." In a broader sense, Chen's argument
 implied that economic reforms were progressing too
 rapidly and that there are limits on how far economic
 decentralization can go without threatening social
 disorder.
 Although Deng was able to weather the storm-at the
 September party conference, in fact, he was able to
 make sweeping personnel changes that strengthened
 his reform coalition-conservative criticism clearly
 was a factor in the marked slowdown of the pace of
 reform. Premier Zhao stated in January 1986 that no
 major price reforms would be implemented this year,
 and in his speech to the national party conference in
 September 1985 suggested that Beijing might need a
 two-year readjustment period to perfect macroeco-
 nomic control techniques. Other leadership state-
 ments and press reports indicate that through the end
 of this year the Chinese will:
 ? Adjust agricultural policies to boost grain produc-
 tion. Beijing will increase state investment in agri-
 culture and make subsidized fertilizer and fuel
 available to peasants who grow grain.
 ? Widen slightly the scope of managerial autonomy.
 Firms that produce goods for export, for example,
 will be encouraged to retain a portion of their
 foreign exchange earnings for use in improving
 production technology.
 ? Promote efficiency and profitability through spe-
 cialization and interenterprise trade.
 ? Make minor price adjustments. Policies linking total
 wage funds and enterprise profitability probably
 will be delayed pending further price reforms.
 We believe this period of adjustment will be smoother
 than the 1979-80 cycle of reform and readjustment

 that led initially to a surge of imports, investment
 spending, and inflation-and later to arbitrary can-
 cellations of import contracts for industrial plants and
 sharply reduced spending for important infrastructure
 projects. First, central leaders are now more knowl-
 edgeable about how China's economy operates and
 what is economically feasible. Second, production of
 agricultural, and light and heavy industrial products
 is much better balanced than before, the government
 has a budget surplus, and foreign exchange holdings
 are much higher. Finally, Beijing can use indirect
 economic levers, as well as administrative controls, to
 Impediments to Future Stability
 economic dislocations last year still exist.
 Beijing's ability to reestablish economic stability in
 1986 will weigh heavily in determining reform plans
 for the rest of the decade. Managing an economy that
 is being transformed from a centrally planned system
 to one that mixes planning and market elements, is
 difficult, however, and the factors responsible for
 makes similar mistakes almost inevitable.
 Policy Errors
 Major sources of economic instability in 1985 were
 the 50-percent increase in currency in circulation and
 loans to industrial enterprises that were made in 1984.
 In our view, the money supply surge was caused by
 errors in the implementation of new banking reforms.
 Although a period of consolidation may allow Beijing
 time to plan the next steps in reform, the pragmatic,
 trial-and-error nature of China's reform process
 capital construction and wage payments.
 One-Sided Enterprise Autonomy
 Although managers have more flexibility in using
 enterprise revenues, reforms have not progressed far
 enough to allow market forces to discipline managers
 who make poor choices. Beijing still subsidizes state
 enterprises that lose money, and a working group was
 formed only recently to draft bankruptcy legislation.
 Until the industrial reform program is implemented
 fully, a further relaxation of administrative controls
 over enterprises probably will cause another surge in
 Local Interests
 Reports in national and provincial media suggest that
 enormous pressure by workers, managers, and local
 officials for rapid growth is a continuing source of
 economic instability. Promotion of "10,000 yuan
 households" by the media in 1984 and exhortations to
 get rich through hard work have generated rising
 expectations among workers for an improved standard
 of living. Rising food prices have intensified worker
 demands for raises, while the relaxation of state
 controls over some enterprises has weakened the
 ability of managers to resist them. Given years of
 emphasis on meeting quantitative targets, many man-
 agers still believe that they must prove their compe-
 tence by rapidly expanding enterprise production.
 Chinese leaders have made clear they will increase the
 powers of the central bank and make greater use of
 taxes to maintain economic stability while implement-
 ing reforms. But because they lack experience in
 managing a partially decentralized economy, and
 because pressures for rapid growth exist throughout
 the country, we expect China to experience periods of
 rapid growth and inflation-followed by government-
 induced retrenchment-as Beijing implements its re-
 form program! The fluctuations in China's economic
 growth, in turn, probably will impart a "stop and go"
 character to Beijing's reform program during the next
 five years.
 Because of China's large overall trade deficit and
 declining foreign exchange reserves, Beijing probably
 will push hard for increased exports this year-
 including greater sales to the United States of oil,
 light manufactures, and textiles. China may restrain
 domestic consumption and try to increase exports of
 corn and soybeans-primarily to Japan, South Korea,
 B The difficulty of managing China's economy is compounded
 because the responsiveness of enterprises and consumers to econom-
 ic levers probably is changing as the reforms proceed. 0

 and the Soviet Union. We believe China will continue
 to make noticeable-but minor-inroads into tradi-
 tional markets for US grain in 1986.
 this year, Premier Zhao
 indicated that Beijing will try to slow the growth of
 imports while changing the composition of China's
 purchases. According to Zhao, Beijing will strictly
 control imports of consumer durables and production
 lines that process foreign-supplied components. Re-
 strictions already are in place for consumer durables
 that China can produce domestically, including color
 televisions, refrigerators, radios, and motor vehicles.
 These restrictions will probably have a greater impact
 on sales by East Asian trading partners than on sales
 by the United States. Despite the lower harvest in
 1985, grain reserves and increased production this
 year probably will be sufficient to prevent Beijing
 from increasing grain imports by much in 1986.
 Beijing's ability to cut back overall imports is some-
 what limited, however, by the continuing need for raw
 materials and technologically advanced equipment for
 Chinese industries.
 Faced with the prospect of a trade deficit in 1986,
 Beijing is attempting to be more selective in expend-
 ing foreign exchange reserves. For instance, Beijing
 apparently has decided to slow or postpone major
 infrastructure projects-such as construction of a
 nuclear power plant near Shanghai-for which US
 firms expected to compete. Increased restrictions on
 the use of foreign exchange may make joint ventures
 with China less attractive to US investors.
 Beijing seems resigned to covering part of the expect-
 ed trade deficit with increased commercial borrowing
 from the world financial market. At a March meeting
 with US Embassy officers in Beijing, Chinese banking
 officials stated that the government was willing to
 increase China's debt service ratio from the current 5
 to 7 percent to 15 percent by 1990-implying that
 China could potentially borrow more than $25 billion
 in the next five years.10 In 1985, China issued over
 $800 million of foreign-currency-denominated bonds
 for public subscription outside of China, and we
 expect Beijing to step up these sales this year. In-
 creased Chinese commercial borrowing will provide
 new opportunities for US banks to benefit from
 Beijing's opening to the West, as well as greater
 competition for international investment funds.
 In the long run, commercial opportunities for US
 businesses are linked to Beijing's success in imple-
 menting its ambitious reform program, and, therefore,
 to its ability to prevent the instability that plagued the
 economy last year. Prospects for increased US sales to
 China are dependent to some extent on China's ability
 to earn foreign exchange. Improved Chinese export
 performance, however, ultimately must be achieved
 through improvements in industrial efficiency elicited
 from reforms of production and industrial manage-
 ment systems. Controversial price reforms are neces-
 sary to improve resource allocation in China and are
 the keys to allowing China and its trading partners to
 benefit from increased specialization according to
 comparative advantage. 0 in March, Chi-
 nese officials hinted that they eventually plan to make
 China's currency freely convertible, and thus elimi-
 nate foreign investors' concerns regarding repatriation
 of profits. Beijing probably anticipates, however, that
 currency convertibility can be allowed only after the
 reform program has been implemented fully.
 10 Some of the borrowing, of course, would be noncommercial
 borrowing from international organizations and other governments.

 Appendix
 A Report Card on Economic Reforms
 The Third Plenum of the 12th Party Congress, which
 met in October 1984, approved a general set of
 guidelines for expanding China's economic reform
 program to urban areas. During the first half of 1985,
 Beijing announced initial steps toward price and wage
 reforms, while promoting increased autonomy for
 industrial enterprises. In 1985, Beijing also took a
 major step toward commercializing agriculture. We
 believe the economy has responded strongly to the
 reforms, but not always in ways that Beijing antici-
 pated.
 Second-Stage Agricultural Reforms
 Seven years ago Beijing introduced the "household
 responsibility system," which gave peasant families
 effective control, but not ownership, of farmland. The
 system allowed peasants to lease land for a fixed
 period-now 15 years for most uses-and gave them
 leeway to manage the land as they wanted. Peasants,
 in return, had to meet production quotas but could sell
 overquota output to the state at premium prices. To
 encourage greater production, in the spring of 1979
 Beijing raised procurement prices of all major farm
 products (but maintained retail prices at previous
 levels)
 The success of the reforms probably surprised
 Beijing-grain production increased at an average
 rate of over 6 percent per year from 1979 to 1984.
 The agricultural policies, however, began to impose a
 financial burden. Beijing had to lay out increasing
 amounts of budget revenues to purchase the bumper
 harvests, while produce rotted in overflowing state
 granaries.
 To reduce the financial burden of successful reforms,
 Beijing implemented policies in 1985 that broadened
 the influence of market forces on agriculture. Instead
 of setting mandatory purchase quotas for peasants to
 fulfill, the state now signs production contracts for
 grain (and cotton) with individual farmers. The con-
 tracted amounts generally are less than the previous
 quotas, and peasants are expected to sell surplus
 production on the free market. The state has dropped
 its former commitment to purchase all overquota
 production at a premium price, and will now purchase
 excess grain only if the free market price falls below
 the set procurement price. In addition, the state no
 longer purchases nonstaple products such as vegeta-
 bles, fruit, or meat-but state-owned marketing units
 in cities are being encouraged to sign contracts with
 peasants to improve supplies of nonstaples in urban
 areas. Finally, rural industry is being promoted to
 absorb some of the excess labor created by increasing-
 ly efficient agricultural production.
 Beijing hoped the new policies would promote the
 development of a diversified agricultural sector and
 encourage peasants to produce better quality products
 and make more efficient use of land. The policies,
 however, elicited a stronger response than Beijing
 intended. Peasants were quick to switch to more
 profitable crops, such as oilseeds and vegetables.
 Strong consumer demand and readily available funds
 spurred the development of rural industries. Accord-
 ing to one Chinese journal, workers on average made
 three times more in rural industries last year than in
 traditional agricultural pursuits-and some peasants
 left their land idle to take jobs in industry. We believe
 that about 60 percent of the 1985 decrease in grain
 production can be attributed to the new rural policies.
 Reforms of Enterprise Management
 China's reform leaders believe that granting enter-
 prise managers increased decisionmaking autonomy is
 the key to reducing the waste and inefficiency that
 have traditionally plagued Chinese industry. On one
 hand, Beijing is diminishing the scope of central
 planning. Only about 60 major industrial products-
 such as steel, petroleum, and chemicals-are to re-
 main under mandatory state production quotas. Most

 goods eventually will be produced under "guidance"
 plans that are set by the state but are flexible enough
 to enable enterprises to adjust to changing market
 conditions. Although individual managers will have
 an element of choice under guidance planning, the
 state intends to maintain overall compliance by ad-
 justing economic levers such as enterprise taxes and
 interest rates on loans. Some consumer items and
 many agricultural products will be traded in essential-
 ly open markets.
 On the other hand, Beijing is attempting to reduce the
 control of party and government officials over eco-
 nomic decision making in factories. Enterprises now
 retain a larger share of their revenues, and managers
 have more leeway to develop production and market-
 ing strategies and decide how to use retained earnings.
 In 1984 enterprises were given the right to sell
 overquota industrial production at prices above state-
 set levels. Enterprises are encouraged to compete, and
 managers increasingly are held accountable for losses.
 Chinese media claim that output has increased mark-
 edly in some factories in which managers have been
 given enhanced decisionmaking authority. We believe
 that the right to market overquota production has
 been a particularly strong lever for increased efficien-
 cy and production. Embassy and press reports, how-
 ever, suggest that the implementation of increased
 enterprise autonomy has been uneven. In many fac-
 tories, party officials or higher administrative units
 still make the important decisions. Moreover, when
 managers have decisionmaking authority they are
 sometimes hesitant to use it. For instance, managers
 who have the right to fire unproductive workers
 almost never do.
 Price Reforms
 China's price system is irrational in that prices of
 many goods do not reflect relative market scarcities or
 the costs of production. State-set prices have been
 changed infrequently since the 1950s, and some goods
 are piled up in inventories while others are in chronic
 shortage. Within the next five years, Beijing plans to
 establish a more rational, three-tiered price system.
 Prices of key products, such as coal and steel, will still
 be set by the state, but at levels that better reflect
 relative scarcities in the economy. Prices of many
 other products, including most manufactures, will
 fluctuate in response to market conditions within
 bounds set by the state. Supply and demand alone will
 determine the prices of minor consumer goods-for
 instance, some clothing products, cosmetics, and vege-
 tables-and overquota production of most industrial
 goods.
 Beijing took a cautious approach to price reform in
 1985. The key reform implemented was the removal
 of controls on retail prices of vegetables, meat, and
 other nonstaple farm products. Beijing also removed
 price controls on sewing machines, watches, and some
 brands of bicycles, and-to encourage greater use of
 highway transport-raised short-haul railroad rates
 for passengers and freight.
 Although Chinese media report that the reforms have
 prompted gains in efficiency, higher prices-particu-
 larly for food-have sparked widespread complaints.
 Because the planning system generally kept inflation
 low in the past, consumers and Chinese leaders are
 sensitive to price hikes. Reform leaders realize that if
 they relaxed price controls on additional products the
 current excessive demands for consumer and invest-
 ment goods would boost the inflation rate, so they
 have postponed major price reforms until after 1986.
 Wage Reforms
 Chinese reformers, recognizing that Maoist egalitari-
 anism eroded labor productivity, are encouraging
 enterprise managers to reward workers for superior
 skills and performance. Last year, some industrial
 enterprises, on a trial basis, were allowed to float their
 total wage funds upward or downward on the basis of
 the amount of profits earned and the amount of taxes
 delivered to the state. In July 1985, Beijing an-
 nounced a wage-reform package for teachers and
 government workers in which wages are to be based
 on the employee's position, seniority, and perfor-
 mance.
 Wage reforms ran into serious snags last year. Unau-
 thorized across-the-board wage hikes for factory
 workers contributed to inflation and undermined ef-
 forts to link remuneration to performance. Wage

 almost a year behind the original timetable, delayed,
 we believe, by budget concerns and resistance from
 employees, who fear they will lose out if skills and
 positions are rated over seniority as salary criteria.
 tivity rose.
 Reformers discovered that the policy of allowing an
 enterprise's wage fund to float on the basis of profit-
 ability was seriously flawed by China's irrational
 price structure. Enterprises selling goods at high
 state-set prices were able to make large profits in
 1985, even if their efficiency was low, while enter-
 prises required to sell goods at low state-set prices had
 difficulty earning profits, even if their labor produc-
 sation trade operations.
 Foreign Trade Reforms
 Beijing significantly reduced central control over for-
 eign trade in 1984. City and provincial governments
 were given greater authority to deal with foreign
 firms, and Chinese foreign trade enterprises were
 allowed to operate as commissioned agents for manu-
 factures and importers of most products. Some of
 China's key state enterprises were granted indepen-
 dent authority to sign contracts for technological
 transformation projects, joint ventures, and compen-
 strictions on foreign exchange use.
 We believe Beijing hoped the reforms would increase
 the stake that Chinese enterprises have in the trade
 process and thereby improve the timeliness and quali-
 ty of imports and exports. The relaxed controls,
 however, caused the trade balance to deteriorate
 sharply last year, and competition among local trade
 organizations caused a decline in the export prices of
 some Chinese goods. Since April 1985, Beijing has
 recentralized its trade apparatus and tightened re-
