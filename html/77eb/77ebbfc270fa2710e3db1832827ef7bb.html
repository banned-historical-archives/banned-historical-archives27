FOREWORD 
  Since mid-1960 the organizational form of the rural 
commune has remained essentially unchanged, but important moderating 
changes in economic policies have occurred. These changes are de-
scribed and evaluated in this report, which also reviews briefly the 
organizational form of the present-day rural commune. A brief survey of 
the urban commune is included.

CHINESE COMMUNIST POLICY ON COMMUNES* 
1960-61  
Summary and Conclusions  
Poor harvests, inefficient management, and mounting peasant unrest 
compelled Chinese Communist leaders during the fall of 1960 to moderate 
their policies on rural communes. Major changes in the functions of the 
communes were made to allow the peasant more freedom, to delegate more 
responsibility to low-level officials, and to eliminate wasteful and in-
efficient management practices. These changes continued through the 
first 7 months of 1961. For ideological reasons, however, the leaders 
have refused thus far to make major modifications in the formal organi-
zation of the commune, which has remained essentially unchanged since 
the reorganization of 1959.** 
The present-day Chinese rural commune is essentially a federation 
of collectives and is organized on three levels: the top level (the 
commune proper), the production brigade, and the production team. 
Authority is centered mainly in the production brigade, which since 
the reorganization of 1959 has been permitted considerable autonomy in 
planning and directing production and in distributing income. The 
brigade, with 240 households on the average, resembles in size and func-
tion the Soviet collective farm and the former Chinese agricultural 
producers cooperative. Production teams of about 40 households do the 
actual farm work under contracts signed with their brigades. 
Urban communes, which were revived on a wide scale early in 1960, 
have been less important and less disruptive than rural communes. 
Their organization has been shadowy and their role limited. In a 
typical urban commune, messhalls and communal services were set up to 
free housewives for work in small-scale communal workshops, which pro-
duced items for consumers and intermediate products for state-owned 
factories. Scant attention has been paid to the urban commune in the 
official press since June 1960, and its future is in doubt. 
* The estimates and conclusions in this report represent the best 
judgment of this Office as of 1 August 1961.

During the first half of 1960 the Chinese Communists were still 
operating in a "leap forward"* mood, although less exuberantly than 
in 1958. Radical programs carried out early in 1960 included a drive 
to expand the collective raising of hogs, a high-pressure program to 
expand rural industry, the scheduling of a vast amount of rural con-
struction work on irrigation projects and roads, and a campaign to 
revitalize urban communes. All these programs were curtailed or sus-
pended by the end of 1960. 
In the countryside the general effect of changes in policy adopted 
during the fall of 1960 was to cause a return to agricultural practices 
prevailing before 1958. The new rural policies had four broad objec-
tives: (1) to encourage a limited revival of private plots and the 
free rural markets; (2) to reduce peasant unrest by such measures as 
allowing the peasant more freedom, slowing the workpace, and compensat-
ing him for property confiscated in 1958; (3) to overhaul finances, 
curtail wasteful investments, and cut costs; and (4) to improve labor 
and management policies. Basic to new management policies was a sharp 
curtailment in nonagricultural activities, with large numbers of peas-
ants reassigned to production teams to engage in field work. Thousands 
of officials also were transferred down to production teams to strengthen 
leadership at the bottom level. The increased importance of teams was 
stressed further when brigades were instructed to allow teams more lee-
way in making production decisions such as the time of sowing. 
Agriculture under Chinese Communist rule has been marked by insta-
bility and inefficiency, characteristics that probably will persist as 
long as the country is ruled by impatient and doctrinaire leaders such 
as Mao Tse-tung and Liu Shao-chi. These leaders can be forced to relax 
controls whenever their mistakes become disastrous, as in 1960, but in 
general they believe that the long-term solution lies not in getting 
along with few controls but in devising correct controls. 
* The term leap forward as used in this report refers to the regime's 
policy -- instituted in 1958 and carried over into 1959 and 1960 in 
milder form -- of working men and machines at maximum speed with only 
secondary concern for the quality and variety of output.

I. Organization as of 1 August 1961 
A. Rural Communes 
The organizational structure of the rural commune in Communist 
China was stabilized in its present form during 1959, when the most 
radical features of the original 1958 commune were dropped.* The 
original huge commune of 1958 had quickly proved inefficient in carry-
ing out agricultural and allied tasks, and key management responsibili-
ties were returned in 1959 to the next lower level of organization --
the production brigade, which is similar in size of labor force and 
function to the former Chinese agricultural producers cooperative and 
to the Soviet collective farm. 
The rural commune is organized on three levels: the top level 
(the commune proper), the production brigade, and the production team. 
There are about 24,000 communes averaging 5,000 peasant households 
each, 500,000 brigades averaging 240 households each, and 3 million 
teams with about 4o households each. There are wide variations in the 
size of individual units, however, depending on the density of popu-
lation, the type of crop, and other local conditions.** 
The top level of the present-day commune has little to do with 
either the planning or the execution of agricultural policy. Important 
decisions on matters such as land use are made primarily by the county 
(hsien) government -- the level of authority next above the commune --
on the basis of broad state directives from above and detailed plans 
supplied by the brigade from below. Execution of decisions on produc-
tion is the responsibility of brigades and teams, the role of the top 
commune level being confined to the general supervision of performance 
by the brigades and teams. Apart from this function, at the top level 
of nearly every commune are found the office of the commune Party com-
mittee; a branch of the Peoples Bank; a general store; state tax and 
grain collection units; a clinic; an agrarian research institute; a 
junior middle school; a farm tool manufacture and repair station; and 
such enterprises as a flour mill, a tailor shop, and a breeding farm. 
A few communes have machine-tractor stations. 
** For example, in densely populated Kwangtung Province the average 
brigade has 40o households compared with the nationwide average of 
240 households. Many refugees from Kwangtung have reported that they 
belonged to outsize brigades with more than 1,000 households. Action 
reportedly has been taken to break up some of these larger brigades 
into smaller units.

The production brigade, the next lower level, is the key collec-
tive unit for planning production and distributing income. Brigades are 
said to own 80 to 90 percent of all farm implements and draft animals. 
Equipment under the direct management of the brigade includes power, 
irrigation, threshing, and transport equipment. In addition, brigades 
operate miscellaneous enterprises, such as blacksmith shops, hog farms, 
and fisheries, which under current rules are authorized to employ no 
more than 3 percent of the rural labor supply. The typical brigade is 
run by a management committee that is staffed by 10 to 15 officials 
who in most cases also are members of a branch of the commune Party 
committee. The typical brigade also has one primary school. 
The production team, the lowest level of the commune, is the op-
erational unit and works under a contract signed with the brigade. A 
team is headed by two or three officials, at least one of whom is a 
Party member. Each team has a messhall, provisioned by the brigade, 
and usually a nursery and a kindergarten. 
B. Urban Communes  
The urban commune in Communist China is a far more shadowy 
organization than its rural counterpart. Eventually, according to 
Chinese Communist ideology, cities will be transformed into ideal com-
munal units, but meanwhile application of the concept has been limited 
to the freeing of housewives from household tasks for other work. 
In the hectic days of 1958, confused efforts were made and then 
dropped to introduce urban communes, and not until the spring of 1960 
was the concept revitalized and introduced on a wide scale. The scope 
of the campaign was nationwide except that Shanghai, the largest and 
most cosmopolitan city in Communist China, was exempted from participa-
tion in the movement. When an urban commune was formed, it set up or 
expanded messhalls, nurseries, kindergartens, and neighborhood service 
centers that provided such services as mending and washing clothes and 
cleaning houses. Then all adult urban dwellers who were not already 
working for state enterprises -- mostly housewives plus a few peddlers 
and handicraft workers -- were put to work in large numbers of small 
commune industrial enterprises. 
No figures on urban communes have been released since August 
1960, when it was stated that 52 million urban residents were enrolled 
in 1,027 communes. There is ample evidence, however, that the movement 
has bogged down. Peking clearly became dissatisfied with the inef-
ficiency and high cost of operation of many commune enterprises and 
after August 1960 adopted several restrictive measures. For example, 
many enterprises were getting subsidies and paying little or no taxes, 
and a stop to this favored treatment was ordered.11/ Most new commune

enterprises at first were engaged in subcontracting work for state-
owned enterprises, but this activity was curtailed when it became appar-
ent that quality control was difficult to maintain. Commune industry 
was reminded repeatedly that its main tasks were to produce mall items 
for consumption (like buttons, pots, pans, and shoes) and to engage in 
repair and service work -- the traditional functions of the handicraft 
sector. The urban handicraft sector had been curtailed sharply in 
1958, when most of its labor force was transferred to state-owned enter-
prises for work in heavy industry and construction. 
Policies, January 1960 Through July 1961  
A. Radical Policy, First Half of 1960  
In the period 1958 through mid-1960 the Chinese Communist 
leadership was in a radical mood, believing that rapid economic gains 
were attainable by means of crash programs carried out under close 
Party direction. Although by early 1960 the Chinese had moderated 
their general policy by dropping such ill-conceived programs as the 
backyard steel furnaces and the overcentralized features of the rural 
commune, it was apparent from the new programs adopted for 1960 that 
the "leap forward" approach was still being followed. 
In rural areas early in 1960 the approach led to a reckless 
expansion of activities (other than the cultivation of crops) in dis-
regard of cost and usefulness of the effort expended. Communes and 
brigades assigned 10 million men, or nearly 5 percent of the rural 
labor force, to the drive to expand collective raising of hogs in the 
busy agricultural month of May 1960. Insufficient feed and poor sani-
tary conditions caused the death of many collectively raised hogs later 
in the year. The labor force of commune industry was expanded from 
5 million men at the end of 1959 to 9 million in the spring of 1960. 
The additional labor force was used largely to manufacture new and 
untested items of farm machinery, such as rice transplanters, millions 
of which were made before they proved to be impractical. A vast amount 
of rural construction work on water control projects, rural roads, and 
terracing of hills was performed, and most of this work was hastily 
planned and apparently was of slight value. This stress on collective 
activities occurred at the expense of private economic activities, 
such as the cultivation of private plots and the private raising of 
hogs -- sideline activities that normally are important sources of sup-
plementary income to the peasant. 
In urban areas, Peking's radical mood found an outlet in the 
campaign to revive urban communes. Another radical activity, affecting 
both rural and urban areas, was the largely wasteful campaign to en-
courage the masses of ordinary farmers and workers to invent new tools 
and devise new methods of production.

In the second quarter of 1960 the Chinese Communists were still 
driving ahead on radical programs in both the cities and the countryside. 
Then two unexpected difficulties occurred -- a very poor wheat harvest 
in June 1960 and the sudden decision by Moscow in July to recall the 
2,000 to 3,000 Soviet industrial technicians in China. These difficul-
ties forced the regime to make a critical appraisal of the entire eco-
nomic situation, an appraisal that exposed the existence of a third 
major problem -- disruptions resulting from "leap forward" excesses. 
After more than 2 years of "letting politics command economics," 
Peking discovered that deferred maintenance was shortening the life 
of machinery, that standards of quality in production had dropped, 
that methods of production in agriculture and industry generally were 
wastefUll and that the statistical organization and the planning system 
were impaired. 
B. Moderate Policy, Second Half of 1960 and First Seven Months  
of 1961  
Under the pressure of all its economic difficulties, Peking 
during the second half of 1960 abandoned or drastically modified almost 
all of the economic policies introduced in the "leap forward" period.* 
The general effect of changes in policy adopted in the country-
side after June 1960 was to cause a gradual return to the policy pre-
vailing before 1958. The major reversals in rural policy were codified 
and endorsed by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, 
the top policymaking body in China, in a resolution issued on 3 Novem-
ber 1960 and called a "12-point resolution on rural communes." 2/ This 
resolution was the first major Party review of policy on rural communes 
undertaken since August 1959, when the system of three-level ownership 
was announced. The resolution of November 1960 was given little pub-
licity and apparently was issued primarily to assure rank-and-file 
Party officials that the top leadership was serious this time in wanting 
to reverse policy, the effect of the moderating measures ordered in 1959 
having been lessened by a concurrent campaign against conservative offi-
cials. 
The text of the 12-point resolution was not published, but its 
probable contents may be reconstructed from discussions of individual 
policies in the Chinese Communist press 
50X1 
The evi- 50X1 
dence indicates that Peking was trying to accomplish four objectives: 
(1) to encourage a limited increase in private economic activity;

(2) to reduce peasant unrest; (3) to overhaul finances, curtail waste-
ful investment, and cut costs of collective farm units; and (4) to im-
prove farming methods and management practices. Many specific rules 
and regulations were issued to achieve these four objectives, and refu-
gees generally have confirmed that the new rules were seriously carried 
out. 
1. Limited Revival of Private Peasant Activity  
A major policy change after mid-1960 was the decision to 
encourage a limited revival of private peasant activity. This revival 
was desired partly because the regime was beginning to recognize that 
the collective sector was less effective than the private sector in 
some sideline activities such as the raising of hogs. In addition, the 
regime hoped to allay popular discontent by restoring a measure of indi-
vidual freedom to peasants.* 
To encourage private activity, the regime put into effect 
many measures to provide the peasant with genuine incentives to grow 
vegetables, raise chickens and hogs, and make handicraft items, all on 
his own initiative. The most important measures were the reassignment 
of small private plots of land and the reopening of rural trade fairs. 
In addition, collective units agreed to provide seed and small pigs to 
individuals, not to requisition manure from the household cesspool, and 
to leave peasants enough spare time to work on their own. 
soon after the fall harvests of 1960 50X1 
the regime began to reallot private plots to peasants, to be used as 
they desired. Private plots are small, usually less than one-twentieth 
of an acre, and probably make up only 1 to 2 percent of the land under 
cultivation. Their importance is out of proportion to their size, how-
ever, because they receive careful attention and because substantial 
quantities of vegetables and fodder crops are grown on them. 
During December 1960 the regime ordered the reopening of 
rural trade fairs throughout the country in order to restore a con-
venient market outlet for the produce of the peasant. The fairs are 
held about once a week. Buyers include other peasants, visitors from 
nearby urban centers, and state commercial units. Numerous restric-
tions have been set up to prevent the resurgence of "capitalist tend-
encies." No individual is allowed to buy for resale. No trade is 
permitted in "Category 1" commodities -- staples like rice, wheat, 
and beans. Trade in "Category 2" commodities, which include pigs and 
eggs, is permitted only after a state procurement quota has been met. 
"Category 3" items, which may be traded freely, include such items as

herbs, firewood, and woven baskets. All sellers must buy a license 
and carry a certificate from their brigade authorizing them to sell 
their produce. The trade fairs are carefully policed by "market con-
trol committees," and in spite of controls and restrictions the fairs 
apparently have flourished. 
Private activity is often an important source of cash income 
to the peasant household, although it probably accounts for less than 
20 percent of the total income in both cash and kind. 
2. Efforts to Placate the Peasantry  
In giving the peasant more freedom the regime also hoped 
to reduce peasant unrest after 3 years of overwork and 2 years of 
undereating. Additional measures adopted to achieve this purpose in-
cluded efforts to ease rural food shortages and instructions to Party 
officials and militia to cease maltreating peasants, to ease the driv-
ing workpace, to compensate peasants for property confiscated in 1958, 
to stop withholding wages in the form of forced deposits, and to alle-
viate individual cases of extreme malnutrition. To ease rural food 
shortages, the regime took extraordinary action to reduce the obliga-
tion of rural areas to feed the cities and supply foodgrain for export. 
For example, the regime reduced urban food rations by 10 to 15 percent, 
greatly reduced exports of foodstuffs) and purchased large quantities 
of foodgrain from abroad. In spite of such measures, widespread mal-
nutrition and food shortages developed in the countryside early in 
1961. Collective officials were told in the late summer of 1960 to stop 
requiring night work and to give adult males at least 2 days vacation a 
month and females 4 days, and later in the winter the vacation rule was 
liberalized to 4 days for men and 6 for women. Low-level officials 
became noticeably more polite after October 1960, according to refu-
gees, and militiamen were ordered not to use violence against farmers 
caught stealing foodstuffs. To please the peasantry further, Peking 
instructed collective farms to compensate peasants for houses, tools, 
and animals confiscated during the commune movement of 1958. Because, 
officials had made a similar promise early in 1959 but had taken no 
action, peasants were pleasantly surprised this time when they actually 
received money. Brigades made these payments out of reserve funds, 
which normally are reserved for new investment. 
Brigades also were told to stop withholding wages in the 
form of forced deposits. Previously, under pressure to build hog farms 
and buy large quantities of new tools and construction materials) many 
brigades had spent funds that should have been distributed to peasants. 
From various activities, both collective and private, the average peas-
ant in 1960/61 received more cash income than in 1959/60, but there was 
a shortage of the goods that he wanted most to buy -- food and clothing.

He probably spent most of his additional income to buy handicraft articles 
or food items sold at very high prices in the free rural markets, or he 
put it in savings. 
Hungry peasants had been promised late in 1960 that food rations 
would be increased, but this promise was one that the authorities were 
not able to fulfill. by April 1961 50X1 
supplementary rations and medical treatment were being provided to alle-
viate severe cases of malnutrition and that by July 1961 the first har-
vests of the year had led to a general easing of the food shortage. 
3. Financial and Investment Policies  
In November 1960 the regime promulgated relatively conserva-
tive financial rules for communes and brigades. These rules had a double 
purpose -- to ensure that collective farms had no funds to continue "leap 
forward" policies and that peasant welfare would be given more considera-
tion in the 1960/61 year. The regulations were first publicized in mid-
November 1960 in the Party journal Red Flag, which summarized them as 
"the policy of keeping less and distributing more and the policy of dis-
tributing less by the free supply system than by the wage system." 
The "free supply systee is the name given to the system of 
distributing foodstuffs communally through the messhall the decision to 
reduce the amount of "free supply' marking a further retreat from the 
original commune concept. In 1959 the rule had been to distribute 30 to 
40 percent of disposable income in the form of "free supply." In November 
1960, brigades were told to keep "free supply' below 30 percent in order 
to maximize the amount distributed directly to peasants according to their 
workpoints. The effect in a poor year was to reduce the amount of food 
available for "free" distribution by the messhall and to weaken the mess-
hall system. 
The new financial policy for communes reversed the usual pri-
orities followed in Communist China for investment and consumption and 
ordered that consumption come first. When distributing gross income, 
brigades were told to see that at least 90 percent of commune members 
received an increase in income. The proportion\of gross income dis-
tributed for consumption was to be 65 percent in "normal" areas and more 
if natural calamities had occurred. The official standard previously 
had been 60 percent, and apparently it had fallen to 55 percent in the 
1959/60 year, when brigades and communes were under great pressure to 
increase investment and production expenditures. 
Tight controls over production costs were reimposed. For 
example, one brigade cited by Peking had spent 34.5 and 35 percent of 
its gross income in 1958 and 1959, respectively, on such production

items as seed, feed, repair of tools and equipment, and purchase of 
insecticides and fertilizer. After reducing the seeding rate and 
eliminating all possible waste, this brigade allegedly cut production 
costs to 19 percent of gross income. In Kwangtung Province in October 
1960 the provincial Party committee recommended that brigades cut the 
seeding rate in half, back to the traditional rate, and reduce produc-
tion costs to a level less than 20 to 25 percent of gross income. 2/ 
Brigades were told to regard investment activities as a 
residual claimant on gross income. The allocation to the. reserve fund 
for investment was cut to 5 percent of gross income compared with about 
10 percent in 1958/59 and 1959/60. The brigades were advised that it 
was not necessary to maintain any certain level of investment but, 
rather, that investment should be larger in a year of abundance and 
less in an ordinary year. 
A comparison of estimates of the main uses of income of 
collective farms in 1956/57, 1959/60, and 1960/61 is presented below: 
Percent 
Allocations  1956/57 1959/60 1960/61  
Consumptions ("free supply" 
and wages in cash and kind) 60 55 65 
Production costs 25 30 25 
Reserve fund 8 lo 5 
Taxes 7 5 5 
Gross income 
100 100 100 
The ability of communes (including brigades) to finance in-
vestment in 1960/61 must have declined sharply. Communes not only re-
duced allocations for the reserve fund but also spent funds previously 
accumulated for investment purposes to compensate peasants for property 
confiscated in 1958. State subsidies andloans were an important source 
of investment funds in 1958/59 and 1959/60. Their amount for 1960/61 is 
unknown, but probably, in line with state policy discouraging unnecessary 
investment, they were no larger than in previous years. 
Brigades also were told to lower investment expenditures by 
requiring commune members to buy their own simple farm tools. If 
peasants were too poor to buy tools, brigades were advised to go ahead 
and procure tools for commune members, while deducting the expenses 
incurred from the wages of the commune members concerned. Although

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
Communist doctrine insists that means of production be owned by the 
collective or the state, Peking adopted this new rule on the sensible 
grounds that peasants would take better care of their own tools than of 
collectively owned tools. 
The paradox of the attempt to give agriculture higher pri-
ority while rural investment is reduced can be explained by the reck-
lessness and ineffectiveness of much of the investment carried out in 
1959/60. Communes and brigades were then compelled to buy huge quan-
tities of tools and implements that were often unneeded, build hog farms 
that were later abandoned, and carry out extensive construction work 
(such as irrigation ditches, roads, and hillside terraces) that was 
hastily planned and frequently of little immediate value. The regime 
in 1960/61 apparently decided that a first step in rationalizing agri-
cultural production methods was to discontinue all projects except those 
of proved effectiveness in increasing production. It then hoped to make 
a fresh start on developing sound plans that took local conditions into 
account. Under this more rational approach, investment opportunities 
would be small at the beginning (while the emphasis was on planning and 
preparations) and would increase gradually, for example, as effective 
techniques for using new tools and building irrigation projects were 
worked out. 
4. Labor and Management Policies  
Drastic changes also occurred in management policy affecting 
all rural production -- that is, production in commune industry, culti-
vation of crops, and other agricultural activities. These changes were 
brought about by curtailing commune industry, collective hog farms, and 
construction activities; reassigning the labor released from these ac-
tivities back to the production teams to work in the fields; discontinu-
ing almost all of the superintensive farming methods introduced in the 
1958-60 period; and allowing peasants and team officials more responsi-
bility for deciding how to grow crops. 
a. Curtailment of Activities Other Than Cultivation of Crops  
(1) Rural Construction  
The new approach to rural construction was announced 
by Peking in November 1960, when the regime declared that in the coming 
winter "rural areas would spend much less manpower on such capital con-
struction tasks as building water conservancy works and leveling farm-
land as compared with the previous two years." _9./ It was added that 
peasants released from this activity were to be either put to work in 
the fields or allowed to engage in sideline production of their own.

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
In the previous winter of 1959/60, according to Peking, there were 
77 million peasants (or one-third of the rural labor force) working on 
water conservancy projects. 
Peking elaborated the new policy in December 1960 
in a directive specifying that water conservancy projects sponsored by 
the state and top level of the commune rely primarily on specialized 
mechanized construction teams rather than on ordinary peasants and that 
work performed inside brigades and teams such as digging ditches and 
leveling terraces should be restricted to projects that would yield 
profits in the same year. 
(2) Collective Hog Farms  
The intensive campaign by collective units to expand 
hog raising collapsed in mid-season. As early as July 1960 the People's  
Daily was admitting that the campaign had "not produced the desired re-
sults." 12/ The reasons given were (a) lack of managerial experience in 
large-scale hog farming, (b) inadequacy of fodder, and (c) unsanitary 
conditions that caused high death losses in crowded pens. Subsequent 
statements confirm that the regime has ordered collectives to leave the 
raising of hogs, for the most part, to individual households. 11/ Present 
policy is to make small pigs available to peasants at cheap prices, allow 
peasants to grow fodder and to take the time necessary for the care of 
their private plots and pigs, offer fair prices for pork and hog manure, 
and give meat ration coupons equivalent to a percentage of the pork de-
livered to the state. 
As yet there has been no indication of the extent to 
which this shift in emphasis will affect the planned production of hogs 
or the ratio between hogs raised collectively and privately.* The shift, 
however, should stimulate production, although some peasants may be slow 
in responding to the new incentive measures. Recalling past vacillation 
in this regard, many probably will adopt a wait-and-see attitude out of 
fear that they will not be adequately compensated for the labor and other 
costs expended. 
(3) Commune Industry and Other Undertakings  
at the Commune Level 
Curtailment of industry and sideline agricultural 
undertakings, such as fish hatcheries and tree nurseries, at the commune 
level became drastic late in 1960. According to Peking, the number of 
* The most recent figures available are for 1959, when, according to 
Peking, the inventory of hogs reached 180 million (an unbelievable "leap 
forward" claim), 70 percent of which, it was claimed, were raised col-
lectively.

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
workers employed in full-time industrial enterprises at the commune 
level swelled from 5 million men (about 2 percent of the rural labor 
force) at the end of 1959 to nearly 9 million men (about 3.5 percent of 
the rural labor force) in the first half of 1960. In September 1960, 
Chinese Communist newspapers were instructing that all undertakings at 
the commune level, except a "very small number," should discontinue 
full-time operations and either disband altogether or operate on a 
seasonal basis. 12/ In mid-April 1961, Red Flag recommended that full-
time undertakings of all types at the commune level employ only 2 per-
cent of the rural labor force. This quota covered not only indus-
trial enterprises but also such undertakings as breeding farms, fish 
hatcheries, tree nurseries, experimental farm plots, stores, and special 
transport units. The number available for commune industry alone was 
not specified but would have been substantially less than the 5 million 
employed at the end of 1959. It seems likely that, in most of China, 
industrial enterprises now run by rural communes resemble in size and 
scope the handicraft producers cooperatives that existed at the township 
level before 1958. 
b. Reassignment of Labor Back to Farm Work  
According to the I March 1961 issue of Red Flag, more 
than 20 million laborers had been shifted to the "first-Yin-77f agri-
culture since the fall of 1960.* Although the combined effect of this 
transfer and the cessation of superintensive "leap forward" methods of 
agriculture should have left agriculture with an ample labor supply, the 
Chinese Communists still claim that a shortage exists and that further 
reallocation of labor is necessary. It is unclear whether the Chinese 
genuinely believe that a shortage exists or whether they merely recognize 
that no alternative opportunity for employment exists for unskilled 
peasant labor. 
In allocating rural labor, rural officials have been 
told to assign about 95 percent of rural labor to production teams and 
to mske sure that during the busy farm seasons at least 80 percent of 
production team workers are assigned to field work. 2__Y 
c. Discontinuation of Superintensive Farming Methods  
In the period 1958 through June 1960 the regime intro-
duced with great fanfare a series of superintensive farming methods that 
were called Mao's "eight-point charter." The eight points were soil 
* In Kwangtung Province, for example, the official response to this 
problem was to send nearly 2.2 million workers to the "first line" of 
agriculture. Among them were 239,000 from state-owned enterprises, 
190,000 idle laborers in towns, and 1,735,000 from various activities 
within communes.

improvement, manuring, irrigation, the use of good seed strains, close 
planting, plant protection, field management (including deep plowing), 
and the use of improved implements. These were applied on a nationwide 
scale by huge numbers of political officials who were overzealous and 
gave little heed to local conditions or the need for prior testing on a 
rational basis. Therefore, in spite of the expenditure of tremendous 
amounts of labor and of additional amounts of grain to maintain the new 
high seeding rate, these efforts were largely wasted. By the fall of 
1960 the entire body of new methods had been quietly abandoned, and col-
lective units were being advised to go back to traditional methods and 
traditional seeding rates. 
d. Delegation of Responsibility to Production Teams  
In the fall of 1960 the Chinese Communists adopted meas-
ures to give the production team a greater sense of identity, more re-
sponsibility for management of cultivation work, and an incentive to work 
harder. 12/ First, brigades were ordered to stabilize the boundaries 
and personnel of teams and make fixed assignments of draft animals and 
farm tools to teams, an action called the "four fixes." Then brigades 
were supposed to make firm production contracts with teams, called the 
"three guarantees and one reward." Under this contract, each team guar-
antees to meet production quotas, and on its part the brigade guarantees 
to leave the teams a specified amount of manpower and to supply a fixed 
sum of money and materials to meet production costs. The brigade also 
is supposed to leave teams free to determine their own farming techniques 
as long as they carry out sowing assignments and meet production quotas. 
In theory, teams that exceed production quotas are entitled to a portion 
of the excess under a complicated formula -- this is the "one reward." 
Teams also are permitted to engage in certain sideline activities, such 
as raising livestock and breeding fish, outside its contract with the 
brigade. According to the regulations, only a small portion of the pro-
ceeds from such sideline activities has to be turned in to the brigade. 
It is official policy to encourage competition among teams. 
The regime has admitted that the same general rules on 
the team-brigade relationship were on the books in 1959/60 but generally 
were ignored. In 1960/611.however, commune and brigade officials were 
told to treat the rules more seriously, and scattered reports by refugees 
indicate that; as far as production decisions are concerned, teams were 
in fact given considerable freedom. Nevertheless, frequent repetition 
in Chinese Communist propaganda of the theme "respect the authority of 
the production team" suggests that division of authority probably remains 
confused to the detriment, of efficient management. Confusion could result 
either because brigade officials are unwilling to give up authority to 
make production decisions or because they are uncertain how much authority 
to delegate and how much to retain.

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
Brigades are still charged, insofar as is known, with 
the primary responsibility for determining specific sowing plans and 
production quotas. Moreover, the brigade, with its control of the 
purse strings, continues to supply grain for seed and feed, tools, 
fertilizer, insecticides, and other production materials, largely ac-
cording to its judgment of team requirements. But if some brigades 
have been unwilling to delegate much responsibility, others would 
appear to have gone to the other extreme and delegated the day-to-day 
responsibility for operating a given plot of land to individual house-
holds or small groups of households. Travelers arriving in Hong Kong 
from the north report that it is again common to see peasants working 
in the fields in small groups, as opposed to the great assemblages that 
characterized the early years of the commune. 
III. Outlook* 
What the Chinese Communists need most is a year of good agricultural 
weather. They nevertheless stand to gain important political and eco-
nomic benefits from their new rural policies. Refugees leaving the 
mainland late in the spring of 1961 reported that peasants generally 
were pleased that past errors were being corrected, although believing 
that the mistakes should not have been committed in the first place. 
The morale of low-level Party officials should rise with the increased 
delegation of authority to them. By reducing the amount of arbitrary 
"guidance" from above, the authorities have created a better climate in 
the collectives for improving farming methods according to local re-
quirements. 
How long such an improved atmosphere will last is uncertain, however, 
because collectivized agriculture in Communist China has been character-
ized by instability in policy and inefficiency in performance. To the 
difficulties associated with doctrinaire policies of collectivization 
must be added such basic difficulties as shortage of arable land, high 
cost of reclRmation, widespread illiteracy, and periodic flood and 
drought. As a result, the long-run task of increasing total production 
and production per worker in Chinese agriculture will be at best a com-
plex and lengthy process. 
A. Instability  
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) remains strongly committed to 
the concept of the rural commune in spite of its shortcomings. Liu 
Shao-chil number two man in the hierarchy, reaffirmed this commitment 
* The discussion in this section centers on the outlook for the rural 
commune. The urban commune is not expected to play an important role 
in the next year or two.

in a speech on 1 July 1961 commemorating the 40th anniversary of the 
CCP. lg Although defending the commune, Liu also indicated dissat-
isfaction with it. He said that the commune "should be placed on a 
sound footing and consolidated and [that] the superiority of the people's 
commune system in promoting agricultural production should be brought 
into full play." That further changes in commune organization are con-
templated was admitted by Foreign Minister Chen Yl in March 1961 to a 
Hungarian newsman, as follows: 
Communes are very young organizations, and we have 
not yet gained sufficient experience with them ... . 
We must make changes in their internsl organization, 
but the principle of the people's commune is right, and 
we do not want to make changes in this regard. 12/ 
In domestic propaganda the Chinese Communists have stressed the 
stability, not the instability, of the present-day commune. They have 
promised, for example, that ownership rights of the production brigade 
will not be touched for at least 5 years. 1.111/ Probably few Chinese put 
much faith in such promises, however, because the brief history of 
socialized agriculture in China has often been marked by the adoption 
of radical changes soon after reassurances were given against their 
adoption. For example, the First Five Year Plan proposal promised that 
collectivization would be gradual, but this proposal was published in 
July 1955, a few weeks before an all-out drive began to gather all 
peasants into agricultural producers cooperatives, which soon came to 
resemble Soviet collectives. A year before communes were formed, in 
September 1957, the CCP directed that cooperatives be reduced in size 
to just over 100 households (for reasons of efficiency) and that no 
change thereafter be made for 10 years. 1 
The Chinese Communists tend to exaggerate the size of agricul-
tural problems and successes and typically have overreacted to them. 
This manic-depressive tendency partly accounts for the wings that have 
occurred from radical to cautious policies. After the poor 1960 har-
vests the regime relaxed its guidance over agricultural production 
matters, but it may resume radical policies after the next one or two 
bumper harvests. The leaders probably have not yet learned the one 
lesson of the commune movement -- that tight central control can com-
pound difficulties in the agricultural sector. Disaster may force the 
leaders to admit that mistakes have been made, but they seem convinced 
that the solution lies not in getting along with few controls but in 
devising correct ones. Thus they talk about reorganizing the commune 
but not abandoning it. Mao's belief in the need for tight controls was 
expressed in October 1960 as follows:

In order to prevent mistakes and ensure orderly 
progress, it is essential that the Chinese people 
follow a very narrow line for the foreseeable future 
and that, regrettable as it might be, a great number 
of people would have to do the same thing at the same 
time and according to a prescribed formula. 
The next drive to accelerated agricultural production is not ex-
pected to repeat past mistakes automatically and almost certainly will 
stop short of the excesses practiced in 1958. However, the general 
pattern of radical periods in the past (such as 1956 and 1958-60) may 
be followed. In these radical periods, collective controls over the 
peasant have been strengthened at the expense of the private sector of 
the economy. The Party apparatus has been mobilized throughout the 
country to institute new policies, such as raising hogs or using new 
cultivation tools, which mielt be profitable if introduced gradually 
and practiced in moderation but which usually have been carried out to 
excess. 
Until the next drive the current set of relatively moderate 
policies may prevail with little change, although there are additional 
moderate measures that the Chinese Communists may adopt while still 
staying within the framework of socialized agriculture. They may permit 
a further enlargement of the private sector, which is still small by 
Soviet standards. They may reduce the number of officials assigned to 
production units from the outside and give more responsibility to local 
peasants. They may reduce the size of production brigades, which now 
average 240 households. As noted above, in 1957 the CCP decided that 
the optimum size of cooperatives under "present conditions" was a few 
more than 100 households. It stated then that exceptions should be 
allowed only for "a few big cooperatives which are really run with 
success." A final, though less likely, possibility would be the aban-
donment of the messhall and the "free supply" of staple grain. 
B. Inefficiency 
Socialized agriculture in Communist China has certain inherent 
inefficiencies, some of which are characteristic of Soviet agriculture 
also. At all times, whether the policy line is hard or soft, direction 
over agricultural production is exercised through a huge Party apparatus 
made up of officials selected mainly for political qualifications rather 
than technical and managerial skills. The Chinese regime tends to think 
in terms of organizational solutions first and technical solutions second. 
This order of priority was described in a typical article that appeared 
in a Peking newspaper in February 1961. The article declared that the

development of agriculture involves two problems: the first is that of 
"production relations," which (it said) is to be solved by faithfUlly 
following Party policies on communes, and the second concerns "produc-
tivity," which is to be solved by economizing labor and mechanizing 
agriculture. 22/ Late in 1960, when the regime reaffirmed its promise 
to give agriculture higher priority, the chief measure adopted was to 
assign large numbers of additional officials to work teams. 
In Communist China, as in the USSR, new methods that show promise 
in selective areas often are mechanically applied on a wide scale with 
little regard to local conditions, and such methods may do more harm than 
good. 
Even though the highly wasteful labor-intensive projects of the 
"leap forward" have been discontinued, the regime apparently still be-
lieves that a labor shortage* exists. In a country where there is barely 
1 hectare (2.)-71 acres) of farmland for each peasant household, this 
belief is either a delusion or an acknowledgement that the organization 
of labor for farmwork is incredibly inefficient. A direct result of 
this belief is that current efforts to modernize agriculture emphasize 
unduly the development of labor-saving machinery and give insufficient 
stress to measures, such as producing or importing more chemical ferti-
lizer, that increase the yield per acre. 
C. Prospects of Success 
There are two factors that favor agricultural development in Com-
munist China: (1) modern technology is creating an increasing variety 
of possibilities for increasing agricultural production, and (2) the 
regime since 1959 has seemed willing to assign higher priority to agri-
culture in the allocation of manpower and materials. Given moderately 
efficient agricultural institutions and average weather, the prospects 
for agriculture over the next few years should be sufficiently good to 
provide a slowly increasing supply of foodstuffs per capita for the 
rapidly growing population. The Communist system of control, however, 
with its elements of politics, prejudices of leadership, and dogma, will 
complicate the difficulties of effectively applying resources and modern 
technology to Chinese agricultural conditions. 
* "Leap forward" policies tended to create "labor shortages" by over-
committing the labor force for various mobilization programs. There is, 
of course, no labor shortage in China in the sense of too few workers 
per unit of land or per unit of capital.
