SUBJECT: Meeting Between Eric Johnston, and N. Khrushohev on October 6, 1958 
Before leaving Moscow Mt. Eric Johnston left with the Embassy 
, a cagy Of his account of his discussions with the Chairman of the 
Council of Ministers, N. S. Khrushchev, on October 6, 1958. Following 
is the complete text as written by Mr. Johnston. 
"Raving been called back from Tashkent on Friday night (October 3), 
I met with Zhukov at 11 AM Saturday morning (October 4). He informed 
me that he would notify me Sunday morning (October 5) as to the details 
of my trip to see Khrushchev. On Sunday morning I received a telephone 
call from Mr. Sofinsky that I would be picked up at the hotel at 1:45 
AM Monday morning (October 6). About 6 o'clock Sunday evening I was 
again telephoned by Mr. Sofinsky that the plans had been changed, 
that I was to be in my room by 12 o'clock midnight and was not to leave 
the room. At 12:45 Mr. Zhukov would pick me up at my apartment. Be 
would not telephone me and / was not to meet him out front. Mr. Zhukov 
was there promptly at 12:45 AM (October 6). We left in a black ZIS 
for the Moscow airport. 
Upon arrival we went to the second floor to a private room. It 
was about 1:45. We stayed in this room until 2:20 when Mr. Zhukov 
announced it was time to go. We walked out onto the field and got 
into a private plane No. 025. It was manned by Air Force personnel. 
When we got on the plane there were two other gentlemen, Mr. Yury 
Volsky and Mr. Troyanovsky, the interpreter. The plane VAS spotlessly 
clean even the toilets. It was furnished in light blue and white with 
two 1;rge davenports and five large swivel chairs. We took off about 
2:45. I did not know the destination. I was given one of the daven-
ports and &blanket. The davenport was not long enough to lie down on, 
but / did. image rest of a sort. 
Later in the morning (October 6) at about 10 minutes to 8, we 
landed at Adler on the Black Sea. We were net by a ZIS car and 
chauffeur

Oahffeur and driven like mad around the Black Sea. It looked like 
e arta between the French and Italian Riverias. It was a perfect 
day, with a cloudless sky, and I was quite impressed with the general 
surrouadings. About one hour later we were driven to a home, some 3 
or 4 hundred feet above the Black Sea, in a place oal1edGag. We 
went up to solid iron gates, honked the horn, and they were opened by 
man. We drove through well-groomed grounds with orange and banana 
trees .and a variety of carefully cultivated flowers. 
The house was fairly large, Well furnished, and well kept. A 
sher vith a white coat and white cap and 5 girl servants were around 
the place. All were dressed in uniform. I was given a large double 
room with bath and told that I could bathe and shave and we would have 
breakfast. We reached the home at Gagra at about 865. We assembled 
for breakfast about 10 o'clock. After a sumptuous breakfast we took 
off for our final destination, retsunda, about an hour's drive away. 
Again we drove like mad, mostly on two sorecching.wheels, through a 
beautiful territory. For about a mile before we reached Khrushchev's 
home the road was lined with tall cypress trees. At the end of this 
groVe was a small village on the Black Sea, On the other side of 
thia village we came to a halt before a solid iron gate with one 
Nadler standing guard. Zhukov spoke a few words to him but presented 
no Oredentials. The gates were opened immediately and we found our-
selves inside. The grounds, large and spacious, were enclosed only 
with A wire mesh fence not more than four feet high. I saw no other 
guards or security forces of any kind during my visit, The house, 
whioh looked new, is large and square, It is a two-story white stucco 
home situated on the edge of a large grove of what I was informed were 
very rare trees, I have forgotten the name. The bark on these trees 
had the appearance of yellow pine but the needles were more like cedar. 
The forest floor was clean as though it had been carefully raked,. we 
stopped in front of the house but were not taken into it; rather we 
were led around the west side to the beach, which is composed of large 
piedea of gravel with no sand, A slated board walk, perhaps three 
feet wide, extended for a half mile or more down the beach, There were 
several cabanas scattered along the board walk. The canvas on the 
cabanas were colored blue or white, or both. Later Mr. Khrushchev was 
to inform me that one large cabana was a guest house for those who 
liked to sleep next to the water, while others were merely dressing 
rooms. 
We walked down the board walk for a couple of hundred feet to a 
platform covered by a large umbrella under which were several chairs 
and a table with fresh fruit and dishes. Zhukov pointed out to me 
that Khrushcheit was coming down the walk. Indeed he was. Iquickly 
saw that he was hatless, and was wearing a blue suit somewhat like the 
seeissUcker type we wear in Washington in the summer. A Georgian white 
shirt with blUe embroidery was tied by a string at the neck. Sandals

Suddenly, Khrushchev looked at me and said "Why( you don?t look

I replied that we had to work so hard in the tapit'alist countries

"There are many causes of world tension today but perhaps the -I 
moat important is imperialism in its many forms,C, England and France 
hav* grown rich on the exploitation Of other peoples." I interrupted 
to hay. that I felt that imperialism or colonialism had cost these 
bountried far more in the recent years than any advantages they might 
have reoeiVedi that these countries-were trying to edueate people for 
freedom and independence. 
"This is not true," he said, "look at the Middle East. Colonialism 
fetultilism Still Continue there. You are trying to keep the exist-
ins governments in power, but the people want their own governments 
responsive to their own wishes, This can only come by revolution, 
Every woman,who has a child hopes that it can be born without pain but 
moot women have pain. The overthrow of feudalism and colonialism 
usually domes with pain." 
'Perhaps you misunderstand our position," I said, sk, do not 
Object to nations changing their leadership even by violent: method but 
We do object to a revolution started by an outsidelbrce, a comnunist, 
601eSpiratorial force directed from the outside," 
6We are not doing that," he said, "Do you think Nasser is a 
communist? Communism is outlawed in Egypt and I understand there are 
H,o-0 or more communists under arrest. Do you think this is an out-
Ail. eommunist. conspiracy? Take Iraq, there the leaders are not 
comiunists. In fact, they are anti-communists. The revolt was against 
feudal 'system. Take Finland, there' is a Corublunist party in Finland. 
we wish them well, but we are not supporting them, We hope all people 
will overthrow feudalistic governments, wherever they are. But in 
your case you support these feudalistic regimes with troops. If it 
had hot been for British troops in Jordan, Hussein would have been 
murdered long.ago by his people, hot by Communists. As soon as British 
troobb are removed from Jordan, the people will decide what they want 
to d?If they want to overthrow Hussein they Will do so. Why do you 
support these obsolete regimes in many of these Middle Eastern countries? 
Your iMperialism takes the form of interest in oil and ts revenues. 
Oil seems to be more Important to you than people." 
A had uttered these last remarks with some heat, At the first 
opportunity I denied vigorously many of his allegations and pointed 
out in some detail what the oil companies had done to raise the 
standard of living of peoples in these areas. I explained that several 
of these countries were receiving large revenues from oil, which had 
bean developed by technical Skills not possessed by these less 
develcped.areas, and that the sale of the oil produced the revenue 
needed by these Countries. "would you buy this oil?" I asked, His 
replY Was quiokt "Of cOurse not We have more oil and gas than we 
heed' We have no interest in Middle Eastern oil. In fact, we are 
rodibig many of fair coal mines because we do not need the coal. Oil

land gas are being used instead. We are dieseling our railroad 
l000motives, making electricity from oil and gas, using it in our i 
factories, and we shall continue to use more oil. We are not inter-
ested in Middle Easterncil." 
I took several minutes to try to explain to him some of the 
problems of the oil companies, their interest in the peoples of these 
areas, their avoidance of political entanglements, etc., and finally 
said: "But many of these countries need outside help, financial 
assistanee. The oil revenues, although large, are not of sufficient 
sive to bring the improvements so urgently needed. Would you be 
willing to cooperate with financial assistance?" 
To my surprise he said: "You wrote an article about this a few 
weeks ago in THE NEW YORK TIMES. Some of this article was accurate. 
The revolt in this area is against poverty and disease and feudalism. 
You suggested in your article that you would contribute three dollars 
to every dollar that we would contribute to this area." 
"That's correct," I replied, "but I suggested that it Should be 
channeled through the United Nations and be used on a regional basis. 
Would you agree to this?" 
Ne agree with the principle of helping these people," he said, 
"but we will not agree to spend the money through the United Nations, 
because the United Nations is just a puppet show with the strings 
being pulled by the United States. in fact, we may get out of the 
United Nations. Why remain in such a puppet show? No longer does the 
United Nations reflect the will of people." 
"But," I continued, "would you be interested in joining in some 
fund to help raise the living standards that you have been talking 
about so eloquently," 
"We will contribute," he said, "but we will do so in our own way. 
The countries which should contribute the most, however, are those 
which have benefited the most from the imperialism in this areae" 
'Who is that'?" I asked. 
"England and Frame," he answered. "They should pay for the past 
exploitation of this area. Western Europe wants the oil of the Middle . 
East. Let them pay for it at a reasonable price and let them contribute 
to a large fund to make up in some small measure for their long 
exploitation of these people. You know," he added, "it is difficult 
for re to understand your side. You were founded by a revolution and 
for years you were the great revolutionary force in the world, but 
today you support reactionary regimes everywhere. You don't seem to 
understand that the world is undergoing a change. On the contrary we 
;upport the desires of all people who set up their own governments and 
ould be. fres from outside domination."

His voice reared and his fist pounded the table. "They are

.he Shifted the subjeot quickly, asking: "Why is Nixon so fond of 
Ohiang Kai-shek? This is another subtject of disagreeNent between our 
two countries." 
I asked him if he had not confused Knowland with Nixon. 
"This doesn't 'make any difference," he said. "Why don't you 
understand that the Chinese Government is the government of the people 
Of China. We can never settle the China question until you realize 
this. Kerensky is now living in New York, but Rercnsky has just as 
much chance of coming back and taking over the government of Hi,ssia 
as Chiang Kai-shek has of taking over the government of the mainland 
Of china. Why can't you people understand this?" 
Here I carefully explained that this was a problen, I felt should 
be discussed by the President of the United States or the Secretary 
Of State. This dealt with the foreign policy of the United Otates and 
Was not in a position to oomment, but as a private citizen 1 thought 
that perhaps there were several reasons. One was that China was at 
war With the United Nations, that she had still not come to a peace 
-treaty in Korea with the United Nations. 
"You mean," he snapped, "come to a peace treaty with the United 
/ States. The United States furnished the forces and the United States 
did the fighting. The United Nations is just a puppet. Why do you 
Continue to obscure the real facts. But let's not discuss these 
things, they are details. The broad question is, why don't you under:-
stand the situation in China? Eventually the china question must be 
solved." 
I asked him if he would use his good offices with China to try 
to help solve it. 
"Of course," he replied, "provided you will recognize the condi-
tions that exist in China." 
"And another cause of irritation," he said, "is you are constantly

these eleven men and did not now have them, 
Be said! "Yes, you heard me correctly. We have never Seen the 
men, we do not now have them. We do not even know that there were 
eleven men aboard. If they were, we do not know what happened to 
them." 
t saidt "Have you told our Embassy?" 
He replied "Yes. Now you claim that this was a plane en route 
from Germany but we know that isn't true. We know the base of the 
plate in Turkey. Your plane was on reconnaissance trying to End out 
about a new radar warning system that we have installede I w t to 
tell you that we are going to continue to shoot down any planes that 
violate our borders. When we have guests in our country we treat 
them well, but we are not going to tolerate unwelcome guests and, 
furthermore, I don't know what you are bothering with Turkey fore I'll 
let you in on a secret. We have no navy in the Black Sea and no sub-
marines in the Black Sea and we are not going to put any there, Our 
missiles could wipe out Turkey in 15 minutes. We have sent a note to 
Turkey and we are going to make claim against Turkey for these plane 
incidents." 
This was a subject that / was not prepared to discuss and not 
desiring to pursue it further, I changed the subject, sayingg 
"I have asked you your opinion of the cause of your irritation 
with the United States. Now let me give you one of the irritating 
problems that we have with your country." I suggested that perhaps 
he wasn't going to like it but I thought I should state my views 
frankly. He interrupted me to says 'How do you know I am not going 
to like it. You capitalists are always judging what communists are 
going to say even before they say it. 
? "All right," I said, "here it is, I believe that your relation-
ships with the outside world would be greatly improved if you would 
allow foreign correspondents to report what they see and hear in the 
Soviet Union without censorship." 
"There is no oehaorship of facts," he said, "in the Soviet Union. 
It is only lies that we censor. The foreign press reports what it 
sees. We only delete the lies. Then after we have deleted the lies, 
the correspondents go to the Embassy and send them through the 
diplomatic pouch So they get there anyway." 
I interjected, "who determines what are facts and what 
are lies?

*That it just the problem," I. said. "People may have different 
versions of the truth. If you would allow foreign correspondents 1 
to report without censorship, you would probably get a few bad 
artieles, but you get many good ones that would far outweigh the bad 
ones. Much of the suspicion which exists because of your secrecy 
and ybur censorship would be removed." 
His eyes narrowed to slits, like a tomcat about to fight another. 
He pounded the table until the fruit shook. "Look at the lie .that 
CBS .just presented on television the play in which I am supposed to 
have killed Stalin," he said. "That's the kind of lie that we don't 
appreciate. What would you think that kind of lie does to the rela-
tionships between our two countries during this period of the cold 
war? Suppose we had presented on television a play depleting 
President Eisenhower as murdering someone. What would you say?" I 
told him that I deplored untruths about anyone particularly about 
rulers of states, but that untruths were somettmea stimulated by the 
secretiveness used in the operation of the Soviet system. .For instance, 
? the Voice of America in Russian is jammed wildni.coming into the Soviet 
? Union, whereas we do not attempt to jam Radio Moscow when it is broad. 
oast in English to the states and to the world, ' 
He saids "That is because the Voice of America tells lies." 
"Mr. Chairman," I said, "the Voice of Moscow tells lies, too," 
"No, it doesn't," he thundered.. 
"But, Mr. Chairman, I have heard the lies with my own ears on 
my Shortwave radio in my hotel room in Moscow. Distortions of the 
truth, clearly. Why don't you like the Russian people to get the 
Same kind of information that we give the American people so the 
Russian people may judge for themselves. Freer flow of information 
both ways would do this." 
During this part of the conversation he had been gesticulating 
vigorously and talking to me as though. he was haranging a crowd. 
?it as the sunlight sometimes breaks througb the clouds on an April 
day, his countenance changed, he smiled, laughed, and bald: "Now 
we are getting angry at one another. We are friends. Let us act 
as friends. What other question do you want to ask me?" 
I started to ask him about his new educational program but he 
looked at his watch and remarkeds "It is after 2 o'clock. Come 
along, and have lunch with me and my family. You are going to spend 
the night here," 
? We arose And started down the walk, ? I had my camera with me 
and asked hist it I might take a picture of him. He agreed readily,

rand / Dna pped several pictures of him and of Zhukov; then Zhukovr 
a picture of Khruahchev and me, and the interpreter took a picture 
of all three of us. Khrushohev was intrigued with the camera. I 
.told him that I was taking three-dimensional pictures in color to be 
viewed through a finder that restored the three dimensions. He 
Ilooked at the camera with great interest during my explanation and 
then said: "You make better cameras than we do, but we make better 
missiles." And, again with a loud St. Nickts laugh, he added: "Of 
oourse the world will judge which is the most important." 
We walked down the board walk to the right angle walk that led 
up to the house. His family awaited us. I was introduced to his 
wife, a stocky, peasant-type woman with a bulbous nose and gray 
stringy hair pulled back off her face. Wisps fell carelessly over 
her ears. She wore a sack-type dress of dark gray. She was very 
pleasant, but other than the customary salutations, said little, 
His daughter, whom / would judge to be about 40, was tall and rather 
slender, with light brown hair, a quick smile and penetrating eyes. 
It was obvious she had her father's energy and enthusiasm, Her 
husband, a man perhaps 10 or 15 years older, was tall and large of 
athletic build, with lots of gray hair. I later learned that he was 
the head of the theater in Kiev. A doctor, whom I judged to be 
Khrushchevts personal physician, a tall, lean man, rather handsome 
and fiftyish, and another man, whose name I did not learn but who 
appeared to be a personal secretary, completed the luncheon party. 
I noticed that the living room was large and spacious. The furniture 
I was white, perhaps bleached teakwood. The chairs and draperies were 
also white. The room was furnished in govd taste with objects of 
art. It was not overdone. He showed me to my bedroom, located off 
the living room, and it was a large, spacious room, with white 
furniture. A big bathroom was off this room. It was tiled and con. 
tamed, in addition to the ordinary plumbing fixtures, what seemed 
to be a massage table. All types of toiletries were on a table and in 
the basin tray there was what appeared to be a large cake of perfumed 
Preach soap. The soap was purple and finely textured, After washing 
my hands, I joined the group in the living room and we went upstairs. 
On a wide balcony extending the entire length of the house, there was 
a dining table with the proper number of places set and a large quantity 
of various types of Russian hors d'oeuvres, A lace table covering 
looked as if it might have come from Belgium. Mrs. Khrushohev sat 
at the head bf the table. Khrushchev was on her right and next to 
him sat his daughter, her husband, and the male secretary. I sat on 
Mrs. Khrushohev's left and next to me Game Zhukov, Volskyt'and the 
doctor. 
After W6 sat down, Xhrushchev said: "Let's have a drink of 
Armenian brandy first. Mikoyan won't speak to me unless I give you 
a drink of his brandy first." This, of course, we drank "do dna"...

The hors d'oeuvres were followed by soup, and trout o then by - 
limb shops, a salad, fruit, and coffee. We had two drinks of brand-y] 
and two drinks of vodka during the meal and there were many toasts 
to friendship and closer cooperation between our peoples. The lamb 
*hops were deltoious but 1 noticed that Khrushchev ate none. I asked 
him if he didn't like lamb chops. "Oh yes,? he replied, "but my 
doetor won't let me eat them." He waved a hand at the tall man at 
the end of the table. 
I then said: "Mr. Zhukov has told me a big lie." 
*What do you mean?" asked Khrushchev. 
"He told me," I replied, "that Russians had small lunches and 
I have never seen a bigger one." Everybody seemed to laugh at this 
and Khrushchev said: You should really see a big Russian lunch if 
you think this is big." 
My back was towards the Black Sea but I occasionally glanced 
around. The sea was like a mill pond, not even waves lapped on the 
pebbles. Through the branches of these odd surrounding trees, there 
was the Black Sea, and beyond loomed the tall mountains rising like 
blue guardians to the Caucasus. 
The conversation went at a rapid fire pace. It was a jovial 
one. There was much kidding of me as a capitalist. I took it in 
good nature and, in many instances, felt that I was able effectively 
to turn the tables on the communists. No one spoke during the lunch 
except Khrushchev, his daughter, the interpreter, and me. No one 
interrupted him except his daughter and I noticed all were deferential 
including his wife. 
Early in the meal I remarked that his daughter didn't look iike 
him but like her mother. Quick as a flash, he stuck his whole arm 
across the table with his finger pointing towards me and roared2 
"Another capitalist mietake. You capitalists can never get anything 
right, This woman isn't her mother. This is my second wife. Ha! 
Hal? he roared again. "Another capitalist lies" His daughter came 
to my rescue, howeyers and said that she had frequently been mistaken 
for her stepmother's daughter. The contours of their faces were the 
tame. "No, no," he roared, slapping the table, "I never thought my 
daughter would stand up for a capitalist." He then went on to explain 
that he had several ohildrenj one boy had been killed as a flyer 
during the war$ another son was a graduate engineer and was now work-
ing in a technical job in Moscow) another daughter was married to an 
editor. ."How many children are there in families in America?" he 
asked. "2 understand an average of about four children. This is 
good. TO increase the populationa-good idea."

"You wanted to ask me about our education system," he said, -1 
&Hy son doesn't have the same desire for education as I had." And 
Again his eyes closed to almost catlike slits, He went ong "1 
worked in a coal mine owned by the French in the Donbas. I got what 
education I could at night. The French paid miserable wages, so I 
Couldn't go to college at that time, This is the type of capitalist 
exploitation we are fighting against all over the world." His voice 
was raised, his fists were olenohed, but the storm passed as quickly 
as it came. He added* "There is no use in talking about the past. 
The future is ours. The future of communism is inevitable, Nothing 
can stop it. Put our youth must have the same respect for manual 
labor that / have. After their secondary education they will go to 
work. If they want to they can study at night and those who want to 
get an education can do so, but all must have respect for labor. It 
is through labor that we make human progress and the Soviet Union is 
going to make progress." 
We had arrived at the salad course and Khrushchev wanted to know 
if I liked mangoes. I told him I was very fond of them, "well," he 
said, ?I got a shipment from Nasser the other day. I am afraid they 
are a little too ripe but let's try them." He rang for a servant who 
brought in a large tray heaped with mangoes. I took one and remarked 
upon its excellencies Khrushohev maids "Yes, they are good but they 
are not as good as the ones I get from Nehru. He sends me a shipment 
about once a month. By the way," he changed the subject, "how is 
President Eisenhower?" I told him that the President's health, in 
my Opinion, was excellent. 
"Yon know," said Khrushohev, "I like that man. At the Geneva 
Conference he took me to the bar after every meeting and we had a 
drink together. I hope his health is good. I'd like to sit down 
and have another talk with him. Why do you people have such crazy 
ideas about Russia and the Communist Party? It must be your capitalists 
who are fearful that the common people will get what they have. But 
President Eisenhower is a soldier, not a capitalist." 
"Tell me about your seven..year plan,* I said. 
"There isn't much to tell. It is really an extension of old 
filtem.year plans, and a little more ambitious. We are going to increase 
those things that we need the most. /t was hard in the early days 
to make much progress with industrialisation but now it is ihoreasing 
by geometric proportions. At the end of seven years we are going to 
go a long ways toward catching up with the U.S. At the end of another 
seven, years, or at the end of 14 years, we will catch up with the U.S. 
in production per capita. We will have electricity for the farms of 
the Soviet Union, automobiles for her people. It is endless the 
things you can do. This is a great country, a storehouse of resources. 
Under eommuniem we can do anything.'

thiltr0 .Ten years from now China may have appther 150 million peoples 
could be a blessing or a problem to yoe. Do you consider her 
a problem at all? Might she, be interested in the vacant lot to the 
north of her? HAS this thought motivated your planning in Siberia?" 
Ha looked at me rather quizzically and said: "China is a great 
eountry. By the year 2,000 it may have a billion people but 
oommulist states never think of going to war with each others It 
is only capitalist states that do that. Of oourse, we will have no 
trouble with China. All communist states believe in getting along 
with each other, in growing and developing. We think of peace, not 
of war* In my latest conference with Mao Tse-Tung he told me that 
China was producing more grain this year than she needed. In the 
Soviet Union, we can increase our agricultural. production by ten-fold 
with adequate mineral fertilizers and adequate manpower. No, there is 
no fear of China. We both believe in the communist doctrine. We 
want to develop our countries, have a higher standard of living for 
our people, and you oan only do that through peaceful means." 
The sumptuous lunch had been completed. We walked into the upper 
hall where there was a large wooden box that looked like cedar painted 
with some design. The box was about 31 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet.. He 
opened the lid. Inside were neat rows of apples, wrapped in white 
paper. "Take one," he said, "they are the best applies I have ever 
eaten." / took one. It was bright redo "Who sent you these?" I 
asked. "An old friend of mine," he said, "Kadar in Hungary," Each 
of us took an apple and walked down the stairs through,the living 
room to the front porch. 
"Let's take a walk," he suggested. We walked along the boardwalk. 
The family remained near the porch: We were alone except for the 
interpreter. We walked to the end of the boardwalk, a considerable 
distance, and then came back. During the walk,, he said: "There are 
two things you must understand. The Soviet Union doesn't want war 
and under your system the United States can't start a war. Isn't it 
foolish therefore to continue endlessly this cold war?" 
"I quite agree with You," I said, "but it seems. to me that the 
problem is primarily yours." 
*Nei that's not true," he said, "You hate communism Just because 
it is a different system. You think you can destroy us. You think 
if you keep up an armaments race that we cannot do likewise and at 
the sane time improve the standard of living Of our people. You think 
that if our people have a lower standard of living there will be a

up with you in the armaments rade. In fact, in some ways I think we 
lire ahead. At the same time we hive improved our country and improvLi 
the (renditions of life of our people. You are afraid of competition 
from us. You are afraid that we will outproduoe you and outsell you 
im the markets of the world and that other countries will follow the 
aommwaist example.. 
X told him that I was not afraid of this at all. As a matter 
of fast, I welcomed it because I was just as firmly convinced that our 
democratic society could produce more and bring greater happiness to 
its people. In euoh a race, free from force, there was no question 
im my mind which would eventually survive. There have been many 
shinges in the world and modern capitalism in America today was no 
more like capitalism of the 19th century than a flower garden resembled 
a desert. Khrnshohev came back to the subject, remarking: "Why 
don't you reduee armaments then, quit this foolish race and use this 
Saving or a portion of it to help undeveloped countries improve their 
position?" 
I retorted that President Eisenhower had said the same thing. 
211 fact I think he proposed it. 
"No," said Khrushehev, "it was a Frenchman who proposed it first 
and I did it second." I replied that I didn't know who proposed it 
first but I do know that President Eisenhower is for this kind of 
development program, 
By this time we had rejoined the family who had gathered in a 
small group conversing, It was about a quarter to five, 
"Wow," said Khrushohev, "you will spend the night here, have 
dinner with us, go grouse hunting with us tomorrow. I know a wonder-
rui spot about 30 miles from here across the sea." 
*I am very sorry, Mr. Chairman," I said, "but I really think 
Should go back to Moscow tonight. I would like to go grouse hunting 
With you but I have already over-stayed my welcome as it is." 
"But you haven't seen all the Caucasus," he said. "If you won't 
&tat overnight then at least let me send you to Lake Ritzaluke. It 
is beautiful. You can spend the night up there." 
"But, Mr. Chairman," 2 said, "/ must be back in Moscow on

Until Wednesday morning. I must fly back at tight."

Zhukov says that I must fly hack at night on Monday," I 
"You can fly back any time you with. You can fly beak 
La the daytime tomorrow, if you wish." 
Zhukov turned to me and said* "We can go and spend the night at 
Rittaluke and leave tomorrow afternoon by plane for Moscow. 
This I agreed to do. 
"but you should leave immediately," said Ithrushchev. "It is a 
long mountain road and if you leave right now you can make it there 
before dark. / don't want you to drive that road after night. I'll 
have my chauffeur put the top of the oar down and I'll give you my 
fur.lined coat. You'll need it in the mountains," 
So we left Petsunda at 8 minutes to five and were driven by the 
same wild driver over mountainous roads. The scenery was gorgeous. 
A WWII, river flowed through thecanyon walls. At times there were 
sheer walls of rock more than 1,000 feet high above us. At other 
tines we were going along the sides of the canyon with vast space 
beneath us and there were no guard rails. Just about dark we arrived 
at the lake. The health resort had been opened in 1947. The building 
was of wood, painted white and green, and was of the same shoddy 
0 onstruction you see almost everywhere in Russia, I can only account 
for this by the fact that there are far too few capable artisans in 
many of the crafts to do all of the construction jobs being undertaken. 
By contrast Xhrushchev's home was beautifully built. 
It was the last of the season at this hotel, which was probably 
reserved for special dignitaries. Only one other party was present-. 
a group of three writers and their wives. I was given a nice room, 
took a warm bath, had another sumptuous meal and went to bed early. 
All four of us went on this trip. 
Next morning we arose at 6230. After a satisfying breakfast we 
toured the lake in a boat. It is a small lake, perhaps three miles 
long and a mile and a half wide at its widest spot. Around a turn in 
the lake was a dacha that had been Stalin's. It was obviously being 
kept up. There were servants and flower beds, Towering mountains 
rose all around the lake. The scenery is about an beautiful as any 
1 have seen in the world. 
At 10100 AM we left on our return trip to Adler and reached the 
airport about 12130. The same plane was there to take us to Moscow 
where we arrived at approximately 6215 in the evening. A chauffeured

JOHNSTON Was informed that the Binkiang Railroad, which has been known 
to have been planned for some time, is actually under construction by the Chinese 
and the Soviet. He was informed that they hope to have trains in operation on 
this railroad by the end of 1959. The Russian terminus of the railroad is at 
Alma*Ata in the Kirghiz Republic, and the Chinese terminus will be at Lungehow 
is Oangsi Provinoe where it will tie into the railroad presently leading into

ONNSTON stated that prior to his meeting with KHRUSIICIAV, he had been 
advised by the British Ambassador and by others in Moscow that KETWOHCHEV had 
been * drunkard and that he now had very bad kidney and bladder trouble as well 
as prostate trouble and that he could no longer drink any alcohlic beveragea and 
had to be very careful of his health. In addition, JOETISTOTI remarked that he 
had been informed by the Swiss Ambassador that KEBUSHCREV was not a good business 
executive, that be could not delegate authority, and that all decisions had to 
be made by KHRUSHCREV personally or nothing was accomplished. JUAESIDN took 
issue with both of these points, based upon his observations during his visit 
? with KHRUSECKCY. Be pointed out that during his entire five or six hour visit 
with KHROSECHITs KOUSECHEV did not drink excessively but dia consume two drinks 
Of vodka, two brandies, and two or three glasses of vine. In addition, JOHNSTON

or *ix bour period KNINISECION was not at any time interrupted by any phone 
galls, messengers or message of any description. JOHNSTON stated that XRRUSHOHSY

remarked several times in the course of the discussions that he delegated 
certain functions to certain officials and that they completely managed the 
responsibilities he bed assigned them until such time they ran into difficulties 
which they could not solve and then, end only than, they came to him for assistance. 
JOHNSTON also stated that contrary to certain information anl impressions he 
had received prior to this meeting, he did not consider KHEN711INV to be a 
blabberomouth or a person who spoke without thinking and knotTing what he was 
saying. JOHNSTON considered IBRUSRMET to be a master showman but nevertheless 
thought he wail extremely careful in everything he said despite the fact that 
he spoke quickly and in an apparent off-band manner. It vas .rnr.731071's observe. 
tion that when SWUM:HEY did not wish to discuss a subject or was not prepared 
to discuss a subject, even in a private conversation, he merely changed the 
subject in each case and refused to go further along lines of conversation he 
did net vent to pursue. With respect to the state of unuononvls health, 
JOHNSTON noted that at the end of this lengthy session PanummAr seemed just 
as bouncy as over and without any signs of fatigue, whereas JP7MTOU himself 
felt exhausted. 
JOHNSTON was impressed with ONUSUCSEV's statistical knowledge of the 
United States, He stated that XVPJONCIEV' was extremely voll.informed on all 
matters pertaining to United States production in all fields but showed a 
complete lack of eomprehension of how the W.S. or, for that matter, the West 
in general operates and functions. In the latter respect, JtrinnToN felt that 
MUSS= had no comprehension vbatsoever.

According to JOENSTON, XNRVSHCHEV on two or three occanions expressed 
an interest in visiting the United States. In this connection he expressed 
a liking for and a desire to talk to President Eisenhower but commented that 
the President was sensitive and would not talk to people. Partgrtnew went on 
to say that the president ought to talk to people and stated that he would 
like to sit down and have several long talks with the President. Be expressed 
the view that some good might come of such talks. In this connection JOHNSTON 
reported that in a conversation with KIXOTAN, =EWAN had also said that he 
thought it would be helpful if the President end IHBUORCREV could sit down and 
have Fri:Vete conversations similar to those which MOM had with 
In.boih instances, JOHNSTON pointed out to XEBUSHOW end to ETKOYAN that 
because of system wherein reporters, photographers and the people in general 
know whatever the President is doing, it would be virtually impossible for the 
President and ERBUSHCNEY to have conversations unbeknownst to the populace of 
the United States. JOUUSTOM stated that WOTAN remarked that he and ADENAUER 
bad made some "deals under the table" which were presently in process of being 
worked out, but MOM declined to respond to JOHNSTON's questions as to the 
details of such arrangements. 
Both IUMUSECHEY and =MAN described ERRUSHCREVIs visit to China in 
Oaring terms: MUM= stated that in his meeting with MAO TEE.TUNO, MAO 
told .him of the magnificent harvest China bad hadj they had ample grain for 
everyone, and were making great strides in their industrial and agricultural 
developnente. According to ORUSECREV, MO stressed that with the new fertilizers,

develop:lentil, they anticipated being able to support without any problems a 
tdllion people by the year 2000. anusnehEv informed JOIMSTO3 that MAO was a 
very torwardolookirg: man and that he anticipated no problems between China 
and Buisia in the future. XVIIUSHOWI, in fact, ridiculed JUMSTOWs suggestion 
that conceivably ten years from now KRUSE= might be looking to the United 
States for assistance against China and stated that this was purely a capitalist 
idea and that only capitalists get into wars. 
Xn.summation,. JOHNSTON expressed the view that the entire motivation 
of mummy and the Soviet hierarchy is due to a feeling of inferiority and 
desire to "Beat America." Be cited several illustrations in support of this 
end stressed that XIIBMSCREV studies the United States, particularly statistically, 
as a oballenger studies the champion he is to oppose. JOTT3ID1 believes that 
this feeling of "Beat America" permeates all fields of Soviet enacavor including 
sports, cultural activities, agriculture, industrial production and scientific 
development, although IBRUMCHBV appeared particularly to plreo emphasis on 
Surpassing the Uhited States economically and in produCtion per capita prior 
to the end Oct hie second Seven-Tear Plan. 
When asked whether Or not be thought a vinit by IMMO= to the United

fairly considerable period of time. He expressed the opinion that a short 
visit in vhieh 101111/13HCHEV was wined, dined, and entertained would not affect 
him in the slightest. He believed that ICHRUSHCMCV would merely translate his 
various ais.Impressions into antagonisms unless he could remain here for a
