 Having developed the charge of "revisionism" against the Soviet leader-
 ship in respect to its position on strategy for the world Communist move-,
 ment, the Chinese Communist press withdrew into relative silence on this
 charge following the Soviets' all-out counterattack in June 1960 at the
 Bucharest meeting of Communist bloc party leaders.  Beginning on 1 July 1960,.
 the press ceased to feature the issue; in mid-August, the press and party
 spokesmen again joined the dialogue with the Soviets.
 The following survey covers developments in the dispute, as seen in
 the Chinese Communist press, from the beginning of July 1960 to Chinese
 National. Day, 1 October 1960, the major yearly occasion for celebrating
 the regime's achievements and voicing its view of the world situation.
 A.  Early July.  Dispute Submerged
 For nearly 1 1/2 months, the Chinese press refrained from carrying
 the argument to the Soviets in articles, editorials, or reports of speeches
 devoted to the issue of international revisionism, or even of foreign af-
 fairs, but published semiprivate discussions, buried in items on domestic
 subjects.  A partial exception to this was the speech of the Chinese rep.-
 resentative to the World Peace Council meeting in Stockholm, which event
 by its nature brought from the Chinese a discussion of the substantive
 issues in the dispute; but the Chinese speaker did not mention "revision-
 ism," nor did he criticize, even indirectly, any Soviet views on the
 related issues.
 On 10 July 1960, as reported in Jen-min Jih-pao of 15 July, the head
 of the Chinese delegation, Liao Cheng-chip, virtually bombarded his audi-
 ence at the World Peace Council meeting with varied and repetitive uses
 of the word "struggle."  On this and on "imperialism," the object of strug-
 gle, he brought the standard Chinese reading of the previous months.  But
 he especially stressed "struggle toward relaxation of international tension,
 for disarmament, for reconvening a summit conference, and for peaceful
 coexistence."  These objectives, he insisted repeatedly, were dependent
 on struggle.   Only by incessantly increasing the strength of the socialist
 camp, the national independence movements, and all other "peace-loving"
 forces, and by uniting these in a "long, tireless struggle against im-
 perialism," could "imperialism be compelled to accept peaceful. coexistence."
 Only by making the "imperialists" realize, through struggle, that refusal

 to carry out disarmament would be to their disadvantage could they be
 "forced to sit down and negotiate" on disarmament.  "To compel imperialism
 to accept negotiations and reach certain agreements, with us and to safe-
 guard these agreements against violation during implementation, there must
 be intense struggles, and diplomatic negotiations must be closely coordi-
 nated with the struggles of the masse.,," he said.
 In this connection, he professed to see the Soviet part in the abor-
 tive summit meeting as one of a number of "recent peoples' struggles" in
 defense of peace, stating,, "The just struggle of the Soviet government and
 people against US imperialist provocations and wrecking of the four-power
 conference has effectively exposed the US imperialists' peace deceptions....
 China, the other socialist countries, and all the world's peoples who love
 peace and uphold justice resolutely support the Just, struggle of the Soviet
 Union...."
 The Chinese press had begun, even before the period of its de-emphasis
 of the dispute, to speak occasionally of internal ideological problems in
 terms of revisionism, and how this practice increased.  Before a national
 congress of writers and artists, as reported in Jenvmin  iLA?2aa~.23 July 1960,
 two officials of the party propaganda department    its chief, Lu,Ting-yi,
 and a deputy director, Chou Yang -  d.scussed internsClonalrevisionism
 in a domestic context.  Amid lengthy considerations of the role of litera-
 ture and art and of the problem of bou ?geois thinking among those who pro-
 duce them, they brought the matter up in terms which were relatively new:
 Making the standard observation tl.at the modern revisionists were
 tailoring their policies "to the need: of imperialism" and that in fact
 revisionism is a "product of imperialist policy," La ;Ting-yi also said.,
 "Under the label of so-called 'active coexistence,' the modern revision-
 ists are attempting to confuse the masses with bourgeois pacifism and with
 the deceptive ideas of bourgeois 'hunn,nism'; they oppose collectivism with
 individualism, and. Marxist-Leninist theory of class struggle, proletarian
 revolution, and proletarian dictatorship with the bourgeois theory of
 'human nature.'  They try to use these rid:Lculous.ideas to emasculate the
 revolutionary will and numb the revolutionary struggles of the people of
 all countries ... in a fruitless effort to have the people abandon their
 struggles against imperialists and reactionaries,, and toward eliminating
 the revolution."
 Chou Yang observed that the revisionists were spreading the bourgeois
 theory of human nature, humanism, and pacifism in order to obscure class
 antagonism and thus deny class struggle and revolution, and to create il-
 lusions about the capitalist class.  He asserted:  "Modern revisionists
 place historic idealism counter to materialism, class compromise counter
 to class struggle, the theory of huma;u nature counter to that of classes,
 and corrupt bourgeois human nature counter to proletarian revolutionary
 human nature."  Be also reiterated the Chinese contention that revisionism
 "is the main danger in the international workers movement."

 The same application of the issue to domestic concerns was seen on
 a local level.  In a speech to a Shanghai youth congress on the problem
 of bourgeois ideology, reported in the 17 July 1960 Chieh-fang Jih-pao.
 (Shanghai), a secretary of the municipal committee of the Communist Youth
 League observed that "class struggle exists not only in our country; a
 more serious class struggle exists even in the international arena."  He
 remarked that the modern revisionists were "assisting the imperialists"
 in spreading bourgeois ideology; exalting bourgeois pacifism, humanism,
 humanitarianism, and sentimentalism; and trying to find a market for these
 among certain youths in the socialist countries.  He held that anyone
 who had properly established a proletarian world view would courageously
 defend the cause of revolution anywhere and any time; he would inevitably
 be concerned with the struggles of the people of the world and move to the
 front to "wage the irreconcilable struggle against the national and inter-
 national enemies and modern revisionism."  In closing he said.,  "We must
 further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet
 Union; strengthen our unity with the people of the whole world; and forever
 courageously stay at the forefront of the struggle against US imperialism
 and modern revisionism."
 An article of 21 July 1960 in the same city daily, on the subject of
 taking a political approach to problems, asserted:  "The modern revision-
 ists, represented by the Tito clique and serving the aggressive policies
 of imperialism, have venomously slandered our people.  This must, indeed,
 be dealt with seriously."  It said that to wage a determined struggle
 against these people, "we must constantly analyze international developments
 from the viewpoint of class struggle; we must exert, strengthen, stimulate,
 and encourage ourselves, and perform all aspects of our work, well, so as
 to underlay and amplify the forces opposing imperialist aggression and
 defending peace.  Failure to observe international problems from this view-
 point and to help intensify the struggle by one?s own action are manifes-
 tations of political deviation."
 Ai Ssu-ch.?i, a party theoretician, in a long philosophical article
 in Jen-min Jih-pao of 31 July 1960, which explained at great length the
 presence of a  dialectical uniformity" between thought and existence,
 touched briefly on the matter of revisionism at the end of his disquisition.
 Here he observed that one who cannot apply dialectics to the theory of
 cognition and who does not understand the dialectical uniformity "is bound
 to embark on the road of anti-Marxism-Leninism."  He recalled that the
 question of uniformity of thought and existence had been an important one
 between revisionists and Ma rxist-Leninists in the latter?s struggle against
 bourgeois idealism, and held that currently there was an "extremely im-
 portant realistic, as well as a theoretical, significance" in the idea of
 this uniformity.  He added:  "The modern revisionists are now everywhere
 sabotaging the materialist theory of cognition and materialist dialectics
 in ideology.  For us to correctly resolve the question of uniformity be-
 tween thought and existence will benefit our struggle against revisionism......
 The world outlook of right opportunists and revisionists being largely
 idealistic  they regard the uniformity between thought and existence as
 a metaphysical one, seeing existence as something no different from their
 own subjective consciousness."

 Similar to this was a philosophical essay appearing as the last ar=,
 ticle in Hung-ch'i of 1 August 1960, entitled "On the Unity of 'Opposites."
 Again "revisionism" was unobtrusively discussed at the end of the treatise,
 though this time more at length and in more concrete terms.  It complained
 that "the enemies of Marxism-Leninism," the revisionists, negate the
 absoluteness of the struggle between opposites, distort the "unity" aspect
 of dialectics into sophism and relativism, and obliterate the fundamental
 conflict and the qualitative difference between the; proletariat and bour-
 geoisie, between socialism and capitalism, between the socialist and
 "imperialist" camps, and between righteous and unrighteous wars.  It stated.
 that to obliterate the difference between "imperialist" wars and national-
 ist wars "is purely a revisionist technique to which we must resolutely
 object," but that it was also extremely erroneous to deny that "imperialist"
 wars may turn into nationalist wars, and to this too it stated resolute
 objections.  It noted that Lenin had said the latter error was extremely
 harmful in practice because it might lead to misleading propaganda for
 "disarmament," since it might seem that there may never be any war other
 than the reactionary war and thus the people might adopt an attitude of
 indifference toward nationalist movements.
 At the beginning of August 1960,, Army Day, usually celebrated with
 fanfare and speeches, was notable for the absence in the official daily,
 Jen-min Jih-pao, of speeches of such military notables as Defense Minister
 Lin Piao or Chief of Staff Lo Jui-ch'ing.  There did appear in the issue
 of 3 August, however, a report on the speech in Moscow. of Major General
 P'an Chen-vu, Chinese military attache.  He was reported to'have professed
 the desire of the Chinese people for peace and their steady adherence to
 a "peaceful foreign policy," as well as their advocacy of peaceful coex
 istence and "constant efforts to reduce international tension."  This he
 qualified with:  "We nevertheless cannot but see, while we actively defend
 world peace, that US imperialism vigorously carries on arms expansion and
 war preparations....  We must necessarily maintain high vigilance against
 its plots and carry on a determined struggle against it.  We are firmly
 convinced that the great unity of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet
 Union, is unbreakable."  Continuing on to dwell on the "friendship and
 unity" between Chinese and Soviet armed forces, he interlarded these pro-
 testations with China's determination to remain vigilant and carry on this
 struggle.
 There was evinced more clearly during the post-Bucharest period a
 facet of the dispute which had begun to appear during its earlier stage:
 an apparent sensitivity over the fact that China was the butt of abuse
 not only from without the bloc, but from many parties within itas well.
 Articles by such familiar spokesmen as Tao Chu, first secretary of the
 Kwangtung Province party committee, left the impression that the Chinese
 were beginning to feel they were in fact being "isolated," as the Soviet
 party had predicted would be the case if they held'to their position.

 In a long article on the problems of the transitional period in China,
 published in Jen-min Jih-pao of 5 August, Tao Chu complained:
 "At present, the international reactionary clique headed by the US
 imperialists is constantly working against our country and is following
 a policy of aggression and war throughout the world, while the modern
 revisionists, to meet the imperialists' needs, distort and emasculate
 Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principles in order to lull the revolution-
 ary will of the masses and break up the ranks of the international Communist
 movement.  This situation has confronted us with the task of studying and
 mastering the theory of socialist revolution and construction, combating
 revisionism, defending Marxism-Leninism, and speeding up the pace of our
 revolution and construction."
 At the end of this article T'ao demonstrated another characteristic
 of spokesmen in this period -- that of apparent concern for the alliance,
 mixed with a persistent holding td their position and implicit criticism
 of that of the Soviets.  He urged the strengthening of the international.
 unity of the proletariat, "especially the socialist camp, headed by the
 Soviet Union," a step he called a "holy mission" necessary to the carrying
 out of the socialist cause.  He saw the Chinese revolution as a "great
 component of the world revolution," but as also being inseparable from
 the aid of the socialist camp, the Soviet Union, the international prole-
 tariat, and other revolutionary forces.  He said:  "our fundamental in-
 terests lie in strengthening the unity of the socialist camp, headed by
 the Soviet Union, and the international unity of the proletariat.  Im-
 perialists and modern revisionists, headed by the Tito clique, are working
 deceitfully to sabotage this unity, an effort we must drastically expose
 and destroy."
 B. Mid.-August:  Dispute Re-Emerges
 The Chinese brought the argument out from the semicover of domestic
 philosophical articles on 13 August 1960, when Jen-min Jih-Rao carried an
 editorial on foreign affairs, ostensibly in refutation of US State Depart-
 ment charges that the Chinese were warlike.
 The editorial was defensive throughout.  It asserted Chinese adherence
 to a peaceful foreign policy, tying this to the Five Principles of Peaceful
 Coexistence initiated in 195+ in company with Nehru of India.  The US, it
 said, had "always rejected Chinese peace, proposals and peaceful coexistence,"
 and its charge of "belligerence'against China was slander of a country
 whd,ch had signed treaties with neighbors and advanced a proposal for a
 Pacific peace pact.  True, it said, China's propaganda had "exposed imper-
 ialists' aggressive policies consistently, but how can peace-loving people
 throughout the world not expose it?"

 The editorial reached its real point in the last paragraph:  "We
 definitely believe that the overwhelming majority of. the world's people,
 including workers, peasants, and progressive national bourgeoisie and
 intellectuals,-,sympathize with ahd support us.  The most recent strong
 evidence of this is the praise and support for Premier Chou En-lai's pro-
 posal by the peace-loving public opinion of all countries.  The modern
 revisionists and their followers have gone to the extreme of loudly af-
 firming the US imperialist slander that China is 'warlike,' or that it
 'desires war,' or that it 'does not want peace or peaceful coexistence';
 they have concocted the lie that China tries to 'promote world revolution.
 through war,' and so on.  By all this they do nothing but place themselves
 in the position of apologists of imperialism.  This cannot harm China at
 all, and will place them in an unfortunate situation.  The Chinese people
 have contempt for all this blasphemy and will never relax their efforts
 to expose and struggle against the US imperialist policies of aggression
 and ware  They will consistently and firmly stand behind the just struggles
 of all peoples.  China will continue unwaveringly in its peaceful foreign
 policy, striving to coexist peacefully with countries with differing  so-
 cial systems....  We are completely aware that the realization of any pro-
 posal which actually serves world peace is possible only if we rely on
 the continuous struggle of the masses of all countries to frustrate the
 plots for aggression and war of the imperialists headed bythe US....
 Two days later, in Jen-min Jih- ao, 15 August 1960, on the occasion
 of the observance in Peiping of the North Korean liberation anniversary,
 politburo member Li Hsien-nien showed the same defensiveness, stating:
 "US imperialism, to disguise its new aggressive and expansionist activi-
 ties and divert the attention of the world's peoples, has employed its
 old tricks of hollering 'thief,' when it itself is the actual thief, and
 of playing its old tune of slander to damage the Chinese people."  He
 asserted that the Chinese people were not opposed to the American people,
 to, whom they would, "as always, be forever friendly."  Though "imperialism"_
 had been hostile to China and occupied Taiwan, China "continued the initia-
 tivp of suggesting that they sit down and negotiate this by peaceful con-
 sultation:", The Chinese, he insisted, had "consistently stood for peaceful
 coexistence and the Five Principles," but the US had "turned down the
 Pacific peace pact proposal."  He asked'if it were not clear "who was the
 aggressor and who wanted war."
 He also used this occasion to make clear his party's general position
 in the dispute which had lain dormant for 1 1/2 months:
 "The Chinese people are adamant in their stand against imperialist
 aggression and for world peace, and they are consistent in'their support
 of the just struggles of the people of various countries for national in-
 dependence, democracy, freedom, and socialism....  We are pleased to note
 that the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, has become unpreeed-
 entedly strong; the national democratic movements in Asia, 'Africa, and

 Latin America have surged to great size; the struggling forces of the
 people in the West and the peace-loving forces of,the whole world have
 developed rapidly; and a storm of struggle against US imperialism and its
 lackeys is forming and gaining speed in many areas of the world."
 As to China's socialist bloc neighbor, he observedu  "The Korean peo-
 ple have worked unceasingly and in a spirit of internalism,for the unity
 of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, and against modern re-
 visionism represented by Tito.  In its position as sentinel in the East
 for the socialist camp, the Democratic Republic has contributed much to
 the work of opposing the policy.of war and aggression of imperialism headed
 by the US and of defending peace in Asia and the world.  Through their
 victory in their war of national defense, the Korean people preserved the
 independence of Korea and the security of the socialist camp, and also
 dealt a great blow to the aggressive mood of US imperialism and upset its
 war plansb  BY their brave fight, they tore the paper tiger which looked
 so powerful but which in reality was not, and proved that if only an op-
 pressed people will rise and struggle determinedly, they can disrupt the
 warring, aggressive activities of US imperialism.  This has given endless
 courage to the people of the world in their opposition to imperialist ag-
 gression and their struggle to win and defend world peace, national inde-
 pendence, democracy, and freedom."
 He spoke of the traditional, deep friendship of.the two peoples, de-
 veloped in their long struggle against common enemies, and of how in the
 "great, just war against US aggression" they had shed blood together,
 "highlighting the noble spirit of proletarian internationalism" of the
 two peoples.  He said, "bur comrades-in-arms friendship was formed through
 bloodshed.... We-shall give mutual support and aid, learn from one another,
 and make the greatest contributions to the unity of the socialist camp,
 headed by the Soviet Union, and to the development of our common cause....
 We shall forever join hands with the countries of the socialist camp and,
 with all peace-loving peoples and countries, struggle to the end against
 US imperialist aggression and for the defense of peace in Asia and the
 world."
 Chou En-lai on the namo occasion, as reported in Jen-min Jih-pao,
 16 August 1960, remarked that the "foreign.policy of peace  pursued by
 both governments was "unshakable," and that it was exactly for the defense
 of world peace that they had fought "imperialist policies of war."  "We
 are deeply convinced," he said, "that if the Chinese and Korean peoples,
 the peoples of other countries of the socialist camp, and all peace-loving
 peoples in the world strengthen their unity and persist in struggle, we
 will certainly realize the peaceful reunification of Korea, will certainly
 liberate Taiwan, and will certainly preserve peace in the Far East and in
 the world."

 As of mid-August 1960, the official party theoretical semimonthly
 Hung-ch'i (Red Flag), which had ceased on 1 July to carry any articles on
 international affairs, still concentrated solely on domestic subjects.
 However, Li Fu-ch'un, politburo member, who was a very important spokesman
 on national policy during this period, brought up the matter of internae
 tional revisionism in a long, key article on problems of the general line
 for "socialist construction," in the 16 August issue.  Remarking on the
 importance of socialist-camp aid and of support of people throughout the
 world for China's socialist cause, he noted that the progress,of its con-
 struction in turn strengthened the camp and the ('oppressed and' struggling
 peoples" of the world.
 "This," he said, "is the reason each of our victories receives en-
 couragement from the people of the socialist camp and the world and earns
 the hatred of the handful of imperialists, reactionaries, and modern re-
 visionists and of those who echo them.  They have conducted campaigns r.
 against China since 1958, in an effort to isolate us and undermine our
 great cause of socialist construction, but events have gone contrary to
 their aims.  Their anti-Chinese activities, as far as we are concerned,
 are to the good, not the bad, because they prove we are real Marxist
 Leninists and that we are not doing badly.  They have not damaged us at
 all, but rather have aroused our whole party and people to unite still
 more closely and to establish the bold target of catching up with and
 surpassing the most advanced capitalist countries of the West. economically
 and culturally, and by ourvwn efforts.  For them, their anti-Chinese
 activities are not a benefit but an evil. portent.  They will see that
 ultimately the rock they cast at others will crash down on their own feet.
 They will expose their own ugly features and will isolate themselves from
 the well-intentioned people who form more than 90 percent of the world's
 people."
 In the closing statement of his article Li said:  "The present in-
 ternational and domestic situations are both greatly,f avorable to our so-
 cialist construction.  No lies or slander by the forces., of the reactionaries
 and modern revisionists can prevent our advance."
 Reporting on efforts to propagate Chinese points. of view at the world
 conference against nuclear bombs by the Chinese delegation to that conclave,
 its leader, Liu Ning-yi, wrote in Jen-min Jih-pao of 27 August 1960 that
 the delegation, in company with those of other countries, had militantly
 promoted the idea of struggle against "the common enemy, US imperialism."
 When the Chinese speaker there said that "US imperialism is the enemy of
 the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and of all peace-loving peo-
 ple in the world" and that if these all unite and resolutely struggle
 against it, "lasting world peace can be maintained," according to Liu, he
 "won sympathy from the delegates from Japan and other countries and received
 repeated, warm applause."  Liu said:  "At this international meeting there
 was no market for the attempt to beautify or create illusions about imper-
 ialism.  A speaker who tried to neglect the difference between the US and
 the Soviet u     was s ou    down as he began to    ak  and the Yugoslav

 On 30 August 1960, Jen-min Jih-pao carried two articles on the Boxer
 rebellion, which it presented as the classic illustration of the need for
 struggle, especially for oppressed and colonial peoples.  The Chinese peo-
 ple in this period, one article held, "had no alternative but to rise and
 struggle against imperialism."  Among the "imperialist abuses" it listed
 as existing then was the division of China's territories into the spheres
 of influence of "Russia, Britain, Germany, France, and Japan"  It de-
 scribed the rebellion as "an anti-imperialist war, a revolutionary war,
 a war for progress."  Precisely because it was "in direct opposition to
 imperialism and'.d ew its strength from the masses," the article said, it
 has since "drawn the hatred of all reactionaries and has been misrepresented
 by all kinds of bourgeois apologists."  The 'article credited the movement
 with initiating the "anti-imperialist struggle by the colonial peoples"
 which was to take place in the 20th Century*
 It also took up a question which previously had not been much discussed
 in the Chinese press --that of which class should lead the "revolutions
 of.the oppressed peoples."  Thp Boxer rebellion was a demonstration of the
 revolutionary activism of the peasants, it held.  "The national question
 is in fact a peasant question.  The anti-imperialist struggle cannot be
 thoroughly carried out unless proper leadership has been provided the
 masses of peasants," it said.   The bourgeoisie are revolutionary to an
 extent and should be made maximum use of by the working class, it continued,
 but some of the bourgeoisie of colonized countries have won powers from
 the "imperialist bourgeoisie," through the establishment of independent
 nations as a result of national movements, and have used such powers in
 dealing with other revolutionary classes.  This class in the colonies has
 a double character and "to regard the bourgeois movement as the main cur-
 rent of national liberation, to support it energetically and exclusively,
 keeping silent on the struggles of the broad revolutionary masses, is to
 take the bourgeois point-of view and to act against Lenin's teachings."
 It asserted the "historical law" that "imperialist aggression" inevitably
 leads to revolution in the colonies, and though the revolution may begin
 in crude form, the masses will in the long run be the decisive forces,
 and though the struggle mayfollvw a tortuous course, they are sure to
 win.  'The question is, whether or not people dare to struggle against
 imperialism, and whether the weak bourgeoisie or the masses will be de-
 pended on in such struggle.. This  as true at the time of the Boxer rebel-M
 lion, and is no less true today," it held.
 The second article on the same subject was used as a vehicle to pre-
 sent the position of Mao Tse-tung himself on the question of the "oppressed
 peoples."  It said that when Mao had received visitors from the underde
 veloped countries, he expressed the following sentiments:' "The peoples
 of the world are the friends of the Chinese people.  The imperialists and
 their jackals are the enemies of all, and are small in number.  World peace
 must be won through the struggle of the peoples of all countries; people

 are the decisive factor....  To defeat the reactionary rule of the imperial-
 ists.;, a broad united front must be formed, and all the forces possible
 should be rallied to continue the arduous struggle.. The US imperialists
 are the greatest imperialists in the world at present and are the common
 enemy of all peace-loving peoples, and these should all be united to drive
 them from Asia, Africa, and Latin America."
 ''s words, the article said, showed among other things "the common
 purpose of the Chinese people and the peoples of the other Asian, African,
 and Latin American countries."  It said:  "The attitude of the Chinese
 people toward the national democratic movements of the peoples of Asian,
 African, and Latin American countries, as conveyed by Comrade Mao,'is in
 complete accord with the views of Lenin and of all Communists in the world
 who are loyal to Marxism-Leninism."
 C.  September:  Parties Meet in Vietnam
 Li Fu-ch'un figured prominently in the dispute when, at the beginning
 of September 1960, he, traveled to Hanoi to represent China,at the North
 Vietnam Workers Party congress.  Here, where representatives of the Soviet
 Union and other bloc countries also spoke, the argument came more clearly
 into the open than had been the case since the meeting of party leaders
 at Bucharest in June.  Li made three speeches on this occasion.
 The first, made at a ceremony in honor of North Vietnam's National
 Day, prior to the congress, carried no punch in respect to 'the dispute,,
 and was in fact heavy with statements which made it seem that Li, on this
 occasion, might take a relatively agreeable approach to the issue.  As
 reported in Jen-min Jih pao, 2 September 1960, Li made some brief. references
 to struggle, but more noticeable were his observations that the Vietnamese
 had always upheld'the principles of "proletarian internationalism" and
 made constant efforts to strengthen the unity of the camp headed by the
 Soviet Union., He remarked that they, at the southern front of the camp,
 had determinedly "opposed the imperialist policies of aggression" and
 greatly contributed to "safeguarding 'peace" in the region.  He also spoke
 of-their victories in'the "war of resistance to France" and in the 6 years
 since, which he said had increased the strength of the camp and "strength-
 ened the will of the oppressed peoples to struggle for independence acid
 freedom."  But he also observed:
 "Our two countries are united in the great family of'socialism headed
 by the Soviet Union.  We have closely cooperated and supported one another
 in the cause of opposing US imperialism, defending Southeast Asian and
 world peace, and building socialism.  Our two countries in the past few
 years have developed greatly in political, economic, cultural, and scien-
 tific and technical cooperation....

 "The present international situation is very good.  The'socialist
 camp is growing more and more prosperous   The economies of the Soviet
 Union and all the fraternal countries have developed on a great scale,
 while the imperialist camp is rent by contradictions and troubles.   An
 increasing number of-people and countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin
 America have become more and more aware of the decaying nature of imperial-
 ism and colonialism, and have risen against them.  The struggles of the
 people, In South Korea, Turkey, Japan, Laos, and South Vietnam against US
 imperialism and its lackeys have dealt heavy blows to the imperialist
 policies of aggression and war.
 "Our socialist countries have persistently followed a foreign policy
 of peace and stood for peaceful coexistence between countries with differ-
 ing social systems.  The-Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the other so-
 cialist countries have made continual efforts to achieve this aim....  The
 Vietnamese people now have the arduous task of building socialism in the
 North and peacefully unifying the motherland."
 However, in his later speech made at the congress, as reported in Pei-
 ching Jih-pao of 7 September 1960, Li depicted the Vietnam Workers Party
 as characterized by "unremitting struggle" and,a "great example of struggle
 to the exploited people in the South."  It had made "important contributions
 to the struggle against the imperialist war policy, for defending'Asian
 and world peace, and for peaceful coexistence among countries with differ-
 ent social systems, and to the struggle to support national liberation in
 Asia,.Africa, and Latin America."  China and Vietnam always supported each
 other he said, in the struggle against "US imperialism," which had  "now
 resorted to-more deceptive tactics in spreading a smoke screen of peace
 to lull. the vigilance and numb the fighting will of the people of various
 countries against imperialism.  We staunch Marxist-Leninists will of course
 not hold any illusions about imperialism."  In the "anti-imperialist strug-
 gle," he said that it was instructive to recall Lenin's teaching that
 revisionist thinking was most apt to spread "whenever the bourgeoisie
 changes its tactics."  Then he said-
 'tIn conformity with US imperialist tactics, the Yugoslav modern rep
 visionists are now feverishly depicting imperialism in glowing terms and
 desperately attacking the Marxist-Leninists.  They   XQ great efforts to
 undermine the unity of the Communists of various countries, and particularly

 bears out the Lenin thesis as above, and also the Moscow Declaration's
 point that modern revisionism remains the principal danger in the inter:
 national. Communist and workers movement....  It is absolutely impermissible
 to relinquish fundamental theoretical Marxist-Leninist positions on the
 pretext of opposing dogmatism, or to replace Marxism-Leninism with revision-
 ism.  Marxism-Leninism is guiding us with all its brilliance from victory
 to victory, to final, complete triumph.  Its great theories and revolutionary
 spirit are not outmoded and will never be so."

 In his final speech, at a rally "celebrating the success of the con-
 gress," reported in the Peiping Kuang-ming Jih-pao, 12 September 1960, Li
 Fu-ch'un hailed the Vietnam party's  determined struggle for peaceful re-
 unification" of Vietnam, "a patriotic and just struggle" which the Chinese,
 he said, completely sympathized with and supported.; H& continued:
 "The Chinese and Vietnamese people are brothers living side by side
 and are close comrades in arms who have always been concerned for and sup-
 ported one anbther's struggles for national liberation.  Now, too, we
 support and encourage one another, cooperating closely and advancing
 shoulder to shoulder in our struggle against our common enemy, US imperial-
 ism, in socialist construction, in defending the cause of Asian and world
 peace, and in supporting the just struggles of the Asian, African, and
 Latin American peoples....  In the defense of world peace and to realize
 peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, the
 Chinese people have conducted,a determined struggle against the vicious
 enemy of the world's people, US imperialism.  This struggle by the Chinese
 people has given a telling blow to its policies of aggression and war, so
 that it is especially hostile to us and. attacks us frantically.  But we
 have won the universal sympathy of all oppressed nations and peoples and
 of the peace-loving peoples of all countries."
 In Peiping, Li Fu-ch'un received some high-level backing.  Politburo
 Member Po Yi-po, at a Peiping rally in celebration of North Vietnam's National
 Day, as reported in Jen-min Jih-pao, 2 September 1960, observed that a
 "storm of struggle by all the peoples of the world is raging 'and gaining
 force," and that the "forces of peace, national independence, and socialism
 are growing stronger each day, as is the influence of the socialist camp."
 He cited the launobing,of the second Soviet spaceship ! ahd Soviet scientific
 achievements as again having "stimulated greatly the fighting will of the
 peoples of various countries to oppose imperialist aggression and defend,
 world peace."  He expressed the conviction that if the "world forces for
 peace and against imperialism" would further unite and conduct sustained
 struggles, they would "definitely defeat US imperialist war activities 4nd
 constantly win victories for the defense of peace."  He added that China
 and Vietnam"both love peace, and have consistently followed a peaceful
 foreign policy and worked tirelessly for realization of peaceful coexistence,
 relaxation of international tension, and the defense of Asian' and world
 peace."  He said:  "The stand of China and Vietnam in defending peace in
 Indochina is staunch and immovable.  No force .can shake the determination
 of the peoples of the Indochinese states against foreign intervention and
 in the defense of national independence,."

 Premier Chou En-lai, at a North Vietnam embassy reception, contributed
 the observations, as reported in Chieh-fang Jih-pao, 3 September 1960, L.:
 that the Vietnam republic "was born, developed, and flourished in the midst
 of the protracted struggle conducted by the Vietnamese people against im-
 perialism."  Its people "had carried out revolution to overthrow long
 imperialist rule," and through 9 years of resistance "had destroyed the
 French imperialist dream and safeguarded the revolution's gains."
 "As a staunch.member of the socialist camp," he said, "it is now
 vigorously defending peace in Indochina and Asia and making. greater efforts
 for world peace and mankind's progress.  It has always maintained a.peace-
 ful foreign policy and stood for the peaceful coexistence of countries with
 different social systems."  But he also observed:  "The Vietnamese people's
 struggle for the.peaceful reunification of their fatherland is forging
 ahead.  This struggle has become an important component of the stormy strug-
 gle of the peopleof the whole world against US imperialism,  The Chinese
 people have supported, do support, and in the future will continue to sup-
 port their struggle, and believe that their just demand will be realized.
 The Chinese people and government, persisting in the Five Principles of
 Peaceful. Coexistence, have always been concerned for peace in Indochina
 and hope to see this area on China's border become an area of peace."
 .Chou closed his speech with the observation that the two peoples had
 always been "comrades in arms and brothers in the great socialist family,"
 and that their mutual cooperation and assistance had promoted the building
 of socialism domestically and also had furthered the strengthening of the
 socialist camp.  The Chinese people would "stand forever at the side of
 the Vietnamese" and make still greater. efforts to strengthen the unity of
 the camp and "defend peace and the progress of mankind," he said.
 D.   Mid-September:  National Liberation Struggle
 The visit to China of President Sekou Toure of the Republic of Guinea
 provided the backdrop for the Chinese party to elaborate its case in re-
 spect to "struggle by the oppressed peoples" and on the "true nature of
 imperialism." The new note here was the "change" in the international
 situation as the Chinese professed to see it, apparently to counter the
 contention,. the Soviets had made from the start that it was the changed
 world realities which Justified their position and invalidated some classic
 Leninist teachings. .
 Liu Shao-ch?i, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, led off
 with the following assertion, as reported in Kuang-minx Jih-pao, 11 Sep-
 tember 1;960:                  "The  vigorous development of the African national inde-
 pendence movement :reveals .a tremendous change in the contemporary international
 situation.  The swift, sweeping progress of the struggle of the people of

 become the main stream in the world situation."  He noted that Tbure had
 devoted himself to the Guinean people's cause of national independence,
 and led them in "protracted, unremitting struggles Against the imperialists'
 repeated, subversive plots" and in development of the nation's economy,
 thus helping to "strengthen the unity of the Asian and African peoples,
 oppose imperialism, and defend peace."  Their victory, he said, had ine4
 spired other African peoples in struggles against colonialism.  Today,
 African. peoples who had achieved independence, he added, were "waging
 heroic struggles to continue to free themselves of imperialist political
 and economic control and cultural influence:, while others were "stubbornly
 struggling" to realize national independence.
 Liu, as other spokesmen had done, coupled this with a statement which
 mixed elements of the Chinese and Soviet positions on peace and struggle.
 "The Chinese people," he said, "have spared no effort to strengthen the
 unity of the countries of the socialist camp and that of all the peace-
 loving countries and people of the world, and to fight unwaveringly against
 US imperialist aggression and in defense of world peace.  Chiz}a has con-
 sistently followed a peaceful foreign policy, stood for peaceful coexist-
 ence among nations with differing social systems, and made persistent u:,'
 efforts to this end....  We stand for peaceful settlement of international
 disputes without resorting to force.  We always support the Soviet Union's
 proposals and steps toward disarmament and prohibition of nuclear weapons,
 and others aimed at easing international tension.  Our peaceful foreign
 policy is daily winning increasing sympathy and support from the peoples
 of the world."
 Peng Chen, member of the politburo,~in a toure welcoming rally speech
 reported in Jen-min Jih-Rao on 18 September 1960, gave his own reading of
 the changed situation:   The socialist camp grows mightier by the day.
 The national democratic movements have undergone a new development.  im-
 perialism, headed by the US and its lackeys, is now encircled and beseiged
 by the peoples of the world.  The sympathy and support of the people of
 the whole world go to the African peoples opposing imperialism and defend-
 ing and struggling for independence and freedom."  Peng warned that "the
 imperialists'are trying to penetrate into Africa to supplant the old .
 colonialists, using so-called economic aid to impose new fetters on the
 peoples."  He added:  "Imperialism remains imperialism, and 'the African
 peoples have come to see from experience that to win and defend their in-
 dependence, they must struggle persistently against it and its lackeys....
 The Chinese and Guinean peoples, in the common cause of opposing imperial-
 ism, safeguarding national independence,'and attaining world peace, have
 always shared whatever came" and have provided one another support....  Let
 us more closely support one another in our struggle against colonialism
 and imperialism and for peace, and in our construction work."

 Jeri:-min Jih-pao of 10 September 1960 contended that events demonstrated
 that Yie existence off' a new, independent Guinea had "accelerated the dis-
 integration of the imperialist colonialist system."  But the "imperialists"
 were not "reconciled to their defeat" and would make a "desperate, last
 struggle," it said, so that the Guinean people saw it their duty to support
 the struggle of other Africtn,a peoples.  "The Chinese government and people
 determinedly support the people of Guinea and other African countries in
 their struggles. against imperialism and. colonialism and to attain and de-
 fend national independence," according to the paper, which added that the
 visit of Toure would promote "the comradeship-in-arms of the two peoples,
 formed in their struggle against imperialism and colonialism and for the
 defense of world peace."
 The issue of 14 September 1960 said:  "The Asian and African peoples
 deeply realize from experience that imperialism and colonialism are the
 enemies of independence and freedom of the people in all countries, as well
 as of peace in. Asia, Africa, and the whole world.  Imperialism and colonial-
 ism will. never change their. aggressive and warlike nature....  The leaders
 of China, and Guinea, in their talks, completely agreed that the winning
 of the world pease depends mainly on the determined struggles of the peo-
 ples o.tf,s).all , the;; cdunt iesu,.~.nga,inst;_::a,3mperial sri~ ,.;.and  nhl~aniall sm and that the present tide of the national liberation movement in Asia,
 Africa, and Latin America to oppose imperialism and colonialism is an
 indispensable and vitally important force for safeguarding world peace....
 Let the imperialist slander all they will; the people of the world realize
 that the! brave struggles against imperialism and colonialism of the Cuban,
 Congblese, Algerian, and all oppressed peoples of the world for independ-
 ence and freedom are making greater and greater contributions to the de-
 fense of world peacea"
 In recognizing the establishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba,
 Jen-min Jih-pao of 29 September 1960 said:  "Every struggle which the
 Cuban people wage against US imperialism is inevitably in support of the
 Chinese people.  The deep friendship between the Chinese and Cuban peo-
 ples, established on the battleground against US imperialist aggression,
 will last forever.  US imperialism bitterly detests the friendship exist-
 ing among the peoples of various countries, and fears their unity.  It
 particularly detests the friendship and unity between our two peoples.
 Since the victory of the Chinese people?s revolution, it has been at-
 tempting by all possible means to isolate us,.but without the slightest
 success.  We have friends all over the world....  Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 said on 8 May of this year that the people of Cuba, of Latin America, and
 of the entire world are the friends of the Chinese people, while the im-
 perialists and their running dogs are their common enemy....  Common
 struggle and common historical destiny have bound us closely together;
 let us go forward arm in arm in the struggle against imperialism and colo-
 nialism and in the defense of peace."

 On the same day, the paper used the occasion of the arrival in China
 of the premier of the Algerian Provisional Government to develop this
 theme further.  It remarked that the Chinese people had "great sympathy"
 for the Algerian people's persistence in 6 years of, struggle under very
 adverse conditions against the French colonialists"backed by US imperial-
 ism."  They could rely, it said, on the continued complete support of the
 Chinese, as they continued their struggle in the future, for the Chinese
 people would always stand with the Algerian people.   T4ough the two coun-
 tries are far apart, the "common struggle against imperialism" linked them
 closely together, it said.  It also observed:  "Allwho'~have the courage
 to stand and fight for independence and freedom, to struggle determinedly
 against imperialism and colonialism, are unconquerable.  The brave Alger-
 ian and other African peoples will win certain and complete victory.  The
 Algerian people's struggle is not isolated, for it has earned the wide,:;
 sympathy and support of the African and Asian peoples and those of the
 whole world....  The Chinese people see the Algerian people's struggle
 for national liberation as an important support to their own struggle be-
 ing waged against imperialism."
 E.  1 October:   National Day
 The speeches of Chou En-lai, carried in Jen-min Jih-pao on 1 October
 1960, and of Foreign Minister Chen Yi, carried in the same paper on
 2 October, both made in observance of National Day, were perhaps most note-
 worthy for their display of the defensiveness and sensitivity which had
 become a feature of many statements by the Chinese.
 Chou, presenting the now familiar formula of Chinese adherence to a
 foreign policy of "peace and support for peaceful coexistence," cited a
 number of examples of treaties. and negotiations his' government had under-
 taken.  These showed, he said, "how sincerely and practically the Chinese
 people and government have acted, and the concrete efforts they have made
 for the cause of defending world peace."  Chen Yi observed ,how "unwaver-
 ingly" the Chinese had "guarded the unity of the socialist camp, headed
 by the Soviet Union," and how they had striven to "strengthen the mutual
 help and cooperation" between the two countries toward their commonicause;
 how the Chinese had supported the Soviets' "peace proposals and efforts
 to relax international tensions."
 Chou stated:  "We are clearly aware that there exist in the world a
 handful of people, the imperialists and their followers, who have never
 held good intentions toward us, who have never stopped cursing and revil-
 ing us, and who have always counted on the failure of our cause.  But their
 hopes will not be realized.  The more they attack us, the stronger the
 proof. of the justice of our cause and the correctness of the road of the
 Chinese people.  Like other socialist countries, a prosperous, strong,
 socialist New China is absolutely no threat to anyone and can only benefit
 the world, and for this reason our cause has the support of all peoples,

 especially the peoples of the Soviet Union and the other 0o0.1411,t countries.
 The Chinese people are profoundly grateful for such world support and will'
 always need it.  We will never disappoint other people's expectations and
 the support they give us.  We are determined to proceed victoriously and
 with still firmer resolve along the road that has been charted and the goal
 that has been established....  Imperialism and its followers have always
 tried in vain to damage China's international prestige and to isolate it
 internationally by the slander that it is warlike and aggressive.  This
 plot will not succeed.  The determination of the Chinese people to strug-
 gle for ;peace can weather the test of time, and can never be shaken."
 The same theme was followed by Chen Yi.  He contrasted "the imperialists,
 reactionaries, and modern revisionists" with the peoples of the world by
 attributing to the former a "deep hatred for China's domestic successes,
 especially the leap forward."  Repeating Chou's observation that they had
 awaited the regime's failure, he asserted..  "Contrary to the expectation
 of the imperialists, reactionaries, and modern revisionists, the Chinese
 people's cause of socialist revolution and construction has not fallen be-
 hind but advanced with great strides, and no power on earth can prevent
 China from proceeding victoriously to its great goal."  He advanced the
 examples of the Burma and Nepal boundary negotiations and various treaties
 as "facts which fully demonstrate that the C inege people, who fervently
 love peace, can never be harmed by lies or isolated by slander."
 Chou stated:  "Whether in the past, the present, or the future, the
 Chinese ;people always stand with the oppressed nations and peoples, re-
 solutely supporting the peoples ...in their just struggles....  They con-
 sider the struggles of Other peoples to be a powerful support to.themselves,
 as well as an indispensable safeguard to world peace.  The Chinese people
 are determined to strengthen their unity with the peoples of the other
 socialist countries and with the peoples of the whole world, and to strug-
 gle to the end for the victory of our common cause."
 .The tone of the 1 October 1960 Jen-min Jihmpao editorial on the sub-
 ject of National Day contrasted considerably with that of the foregoing
 speeches.  Developing the theme of the changed international situation,
 it held that "the struggle for world peace, national independence, democ.>
 racy, and, social progress" had reached a new high in the current year,
 the peoples of the world were "seeing imperialism for what it was," and
 more and more of them were "participating in the movement to prevent it
 from starting another war and to safeguard peace."  The workers movement
 in' the capitalist countries had made progress, it said, while the economic
 situation in these countries was deteriorating, "with the US facing a new
 economic crisis."  It asserted that the "struggle between the US and other
 q3tense throughout
 imperialists to gain spheres of influence" was 'becoanu
 the world and "their internal problems and                     among them"
 were growing.

 "The development of the international situation over the past year,"
 it said, "has seen the forces of socialism, national liberation, peace,
 and democracy forge still further ahead of the forces.of imperialism, re-
 action, and war.  In other words, with the East wind preva.ling further
 over the West, the situation is very greatly advantageous to the struggle
 of the world's people for peace, democracy, national liberation, and so
 cialism, and to the construction of their motherland by the Chinese people
 in a peaceful international environment."
 Discussing its own domestic victories, the editorial expressed "warm
 sympathy and high respect to the people of various countries in the world
 for their struggle for brightness and prosperity."'  It observed that the
 socialist camp, "headed by the Soviet Union," had become "more consolidated
 and more powerful, the Soviets having achieved greater successes in their
 all-out construction of Communism, and, in science and technology, having
 left the US still further behind."  In the "fraternal" countries, it said,
 construction had advanced with vigor, and "the socialist countries have
 earned wide support from all peoples for their foreign policy of peace,
 and, their world standing and influence have risen continuously; pursuing
 their great common ideal of Communism, and. opposing their common enemy,
 friendly relations between them will endure forever and no force can
 undermine their unity."  The Chinese, it said, had', consistently conducted
 "dauntless struggles for the cause of peace," and had supported the So-
 viets' "peace proposals and efforts for disarmament and relaxation of
 tension."  To this it added:
 "Me Chinese people warmly support the Asian, African,, and Latin
 American peoples' struggles to attain and safeguard national independence,
 and regard these struggles as.^a powerful support to themselves.  They
 have always made great efforts toward. the establishment and development
 of peaceful coexistence with all foreign countries, and for the broaden-
 ing of the area of peace in Asia."
 The editorial closed with the now customary note of sensitivity:
 ";US imperialism's plots to isolate New China by using shameful tactics v
 will never succeed.  The Chinese people believe that if the people through-
 out the world will continue to take full advantage of the present profound
 situation... they can defeat the policy of aggression and war of the im-
 perialist clique headed by the US and realize the great goal of defending
 world peace....  The Chinese people will struggle to defeat the aggressive
 war forces headed by US imperialism and to defend world peace, in company
 with the peoples of the whole world."
 Hung-ch'i of 1 October 1960 used the celebration of National Day and
 the simultaneous publication of the fourth volume of the selected works
 of Mao to review the Chinese position in the dispute and to give the credit
 for the "correctness" of the whole span of Chinese views to Mao Tse-tung

 himself.  The concentration, in the editorial, however, was specifically
 on the "correct, revolutionary approach to dealing with imperialism," as
 centered on Mao's concept of slighting the enemy strategically (seeing
 him as a "paper tiger"), but of taking him seriously and making careful
 efforts to defeat him tactically.  The editorial boasted.
 "The victory of the Chinese revolution is a great, historically sig-
 nificant world event, after the victory of the Russian October Revolution
 and the 'victory of the international antifascist ward  It has penetrated
 the imperialist front in the East and has struck a death blow to the imp
 perialist colonial system.  It has greatly strengthened the socialist
 camp, headed by the Soviet Union, further altered the appearance of the
 world, and greatly inspired the people of the whole world who are strug-
 gling for liberation from imperialist and reactionary oppression.  Its
 victory is a victory of Marxism-Leninism, a victory of Mao Tse-tung's
 thinking.  His theoretical guidance played the very great, decisive role
 in the victorious, protracted revolutionary struggles of the Chinese peo-
 ple against enemies internal and foreign."
 Continuing on the theme of revolution, the editorial commented that
 in the revolutionary civil war, the Chinese people had "displayed to the
 full their revolutionary spirit and had formed an invincible force, under
 the guidance of Comrade Mao's theory."  It further observed that where the
 "Chinese party and people desired to transform the country into a New
 China led by the proletariat and belonging to the masses," the question
 "whether our party should follow the revolutionary line and determinedly
 lead the people of the country to overthrow the reactionaries, or should
 take an opportunistic line, abandon the gains of the people's victory,
 and compromise with and surrender to imperialism and its lackeys" became
 a vital issue affecting the nation's destiny.
 Mao., it said, had pointed out long ago that the "imperialist camp
 headed by the US was opposing all the democratic forces headed by the So-
 viet Union and preparing for a distant third world war to defeat these
 forces, a plot which the democratic forces must and definitely can defeat."
 It quoted him as saying:  "The anti-imperialist camp of the world is more
 powerful than the imperialists; it is we who are superior, not the enemy....
 All attitudes which overestimate their strength and underestimate the
 strength of the people are incorrect.  With strenuous effort, we, in com-
 pany with all the world's democratic forces, can definitely defeat the
 imperialists' scheme of enslavement, prevent a third world war, destroy
 all reactionary rule, and win a lasting peace for mankind."
 The editorial asserted that Mao's concept of strategically slighting
 the enemy but of tactically taking him seriously was the result of historical
 experience in revolution.  "It demonstrates," it said, "endless devotion
 to the cause of proletarian revolution, and absolute courage, determination,

 and confidence in winning revolutionary victory, and it displays Marxist-
 Leninist wisdom and skill in conducting struggle against the enemy and
 gaining step-by-step victory.  The history of the Chinese revolution proves
 that the revolutionary line based on this concept has strengthened the
 revolutionary forces and led them out of defeat to victory, and from local
 to national victories, in contrast with the results of opportunistic lines."
 It observed that "there are some" who, taking a metaphysical' world outlook,
 think that to follow the concept of taking the enemy lightly strategically
 is to take an adventurist viewpoint, while to take him seri.osly in tactics
 is to overestimate his strength and underestimate one's own.  Such people
 do not understand the "dual nature of imperialism,"nor do they understand
 Marxist dialectics, it said.
 ''.This I *W,," the editorial asserted, "has been proved by the past
 revolutionary experience of the Chinese revolution, and it will continue
 to be proved in the victorious development of the world revolution of the
 people in the future....  The people of our country, together with those
 of the great Soviet Union and the other socialist countries and the peo-
 ple of the whole world, are struggling against imperialism and colonialism,
 against modern revisionism, for the defense of world peace and for national
 independence, democratic freedom, and the victory of the socialist cause."
 To this end, it held, Mao's aforesaid fundamental strategic-tactical con-
 cept must be applied.

 Need for-Peaceful, .Coexistence Stressed
 A survey of several North Vietnam papers and periodicals made from
 17 August through 8 September 1960 seems to indicate that on the surface,
 at least, the Sino-Soviet controversy has abated to some extent.'
 Since the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic
 of Vietnam occurred on 2 September 1960, almost all press space during
 the period of this survey was given to some phase of this anniversary,
 and from 2 through 8 September, Nhan Dan, the official organ of the Viet-
 nam Lao Dong Party, carried full texts of the speeches made by heads of
 delegations from the Soviet Union, China, and many other socialist coun-
 tries.
 The fact that the paper printed the text of these speeches indicates
 that the regime in North Vietnam may have finally decided to acknowledge
 the Sino-Soviet conflict.  Heretofore, when dealing with speeches made by
 various Soviet or Chinese leaders, Nhan Dan usually excerpted or summarized
 them and in this way managed to omit any statements prejudicial to either
 side.  The statements made on this occasion by:-the foreign delegates (in-
 cluding the Chinese) and the North Vietnamese leaders allatress the theme
 of unity and peaceful coexistence, vigilance against "imperialist aggres-
 sion," and the leadership of the Soviet Unions
 These points were all emphasized by Premier and Politburo member Pham
 Van Dong, when, according to the 2 September issue of Nhan Dan, he said:
 "The nature of imperialism, particularly US imperialism, is aggression
 and warmongering.  However, the balance of forces in the world. has now
 changed In favor of socialism, national independence, and world peace.
 Today the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are successfully
 building communism and socialism and have become an invincible force.;
 Along with peace-loving people all over the world, they are able to pre-
 vent war, check the blood-stained hands of the imperialists, preserve
 peace, and save mankin4 fi   a new world war, a nuclear war.
 "At present, the policy of peace and peaceful coexistence of the
 Soviet Union and the socialist bloc, and the Soviet proposal for complete
 and general disarmament, fully meet the interests. and aspirations of people
 the world over....
 "The imperialists, with the US imperialists.. at their head, are cruel
 and treacherous, but the Vietnamese and the people of the world are con-
 stantly heightening their vigilance, deepening their hatred for the
 imperialists,.and exerting ever more vigorous efforts to defeat them.
 Final victory will certainly belong to the people.  It is clear that

 the present era is not an era in which the imperialist countries can
 freely rule the roost in the world....  It is an era :'.'when socialist is
 on the upgrade and imperialism is on the decline.'  It is the era 'when
 the forces of peace have grown so that there is a real possibility of
 averting war.'"
 Exactly the same points were made in a more succinct manner by Zenon
 Nowak, Alexander Dubcek, Ferenc Nezval, Nicolae Giosan, Dimity Dimov,
 Begir-Balluku,.Mrs Pak Chong-ae, and Damdin, respective heads of the party
 and government delegations from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania,
 Bulgaria, Albania, North Korea, and Mongolia..
 The only person who made any overt reference to the Sino-Soviet dis-
 pute was Baqir Balluku, head of the Albanian delegation.  Unlike other
 delegates, who did not mention China at all, he devoted a large part of
 his speech, which appeared in Nhan Dan on 2 September, to the  "diabolical
 aims" of the US against China in occupying Taiwan and in preventing
 China's entry into the UN.  Unlike the other delegates, who gave great
 praise to the USSR for its achievements in all fields and for its "un-
 stinting efforts for peace,"  Balluku mentioned the Soviet Union only
 twice and then apparently in a routine manner.  Once he stated that "the
 imperialists will never succeed in their wily schemes because there now
 exist the glorious and unrivaled Soviet Union and the glorious People's
 China...."
 His other mention of the USSR was in his closing remarks, when he
 said: "All together we will safeguard the unshakable unity of the
 socialist bloc, which is headed by the Soviet Union....
 PKI Pursuing, fMiddle-= Road
 A survey of Harian Rakjat from 3 August 1960, when the Indonesian
 Army lifted  its ban on that paper, to 15 September 1960, when the ban
 was again imposed, seems to indicate that the moderate middle-of-the-road
 group which has controlled the party since 1951 is still concerned with
 defending its position against attacks from both right and left.  As
 indicated in previous issues of Communist Revisionism and Dissidence., the
 PKI (Indonesian Communist Party  has long been plagued by the danger of
 revisionism inherent in its policy of collaboration with the national
 bourgeoisie in a united front.   At the other extreme, double encouragement
 emanating from developments on both the domestic political and inter-
 national Communist scene has been given in recent months to a faction
 desiring to pursue a more vigorous line both toward the Indonesian govern-
 ment and in interpreting Marxist-Leninist dogma.

 C?0-N_F-I-D-E?-N..T..I.A.,L
 Because of the conjunction of certain Indonesian internal political
 developments and the growing ideological disagreement between the Soviet
 Union and China, it is not clear whether-at this particular time either
 of these presumed dissident factions is motivated primarily by theoretical
 or, by pragmatic political considerations.  Furthermore, statements of
 position by these factions are entirely lacking in the period under con-
 sideration.  However, one can infer from the most insistent arguments in
 ..the articles of the moderates within the party the main points on which
 they are being attacked.  In addition, the amount of coverage given in
 the daily Communist press to statements by leaders of either?the Soviet
 Union or China which might tend to support the position of one or the
 other of the factions can also be viewed as an indication that the party
 may be leaning to one side or the other.
 To start with an examination of this latter possible key to the situ-
 ation, no significant Soviet article which might have acted as a counter-
 weight to Chinese arguments was published in.Harian Rakjat during the
 period covered.  In contrast, there was a certain amount of republication
 .of Chinese statements.  This was concentrated at the beginning of August
 1960 and led off with HNA dispatch on Chou En-lai's proposal of a Pacific
 Peace Pact and denial of Chinese abandonment of a peaceful coexistence
 policy in the 3. August 1960 Harlan Rakjat.  The same issue contained an
 NCNA report on a speech by General Lo Jul-ching on the anniversary of the
 People's Liberation Army.  The general supported peaceful coexistence in
 his remarks, but also noted that if "the imperialists" were to launch an
 aggressive war, they would "be sure to suffer total defeat."
 The 4 August 1960 Harian Rakjat carried a report on Chen Yi's speech
 at a reception for military attaches on the same occasion in which he
 noted the similarity between the Chinese struggle and the present one
 of the African nations and attributed China's success in this struggle
 to the People's Liberation Army. On 6 August 1960, Irian fakjat summarized
 at length Lu Ting-i's speech to China's Third National Congress of
 Writers and Artists and included the full text of three paragraphs which,
 in an attack on "modern revisionists" (identified with Tito), neatly
 summed up the main Chinese positions in their ideological dispute with
 the Soviet Union.  The article also summarized a speech to the same
 congress, by Chou Yang, which included criticism of revisionists.
 At this point, however, coverage of Chinese materials pertinent to
 such controversial questions ceased abruptly until 12 September, when
 there was a brief report on Liu Shao-chi's speech to a banquet honoring
 the.President of Guinea.  This item noted that Liu called for heightened
 vigilance against "imperalist intrigues" in the Congo and elsewhere, but
 did not develop the subject.  This cessation of coverage of the Chinese
 position. is of particular interest since it came at a point when the
 Chinese themselves were issuing tajor statements in their rebuttal of
 Soviet criticism..

 Dgring.,this' period:,.,there wasz_no,., .ire t discuss a ;ln the.;I  .onesian
 press of peaceful coexistence per se.  However, the generally mild tone.,
 of the speech made by the chairman of the Indonesian delegation.to the
 anti-A and H bomb conference in Tokyo, the main theme of which was that
 the struggle for peace cannot be separated from the struggle for national
 independence, contrasted with the greater militance of the speech by the
 general chairman of the Japanese Anti-A and H Bomb Council.  Both these
 speeches were reported on in the 5-:,' August 1960 Harian Rakjat.  Similarly,
 in a long article which appeared in the 10 August- 1960 issue of the paper,
 Kartinah Kurdi developed the theme that women are lovers-.of would peace
 by stressing the 'horrors6f'atomic warfare and thereby indirectly implied
 that another war would be unthinkable.
 The main concern of the Indonesian Communists at this time, howev,r,
 was a continuing examination of the nature of their own revolution.  To
 this end, a 3 to 30 August series of articles marking the 15th anniversary
 of the 1945, revolution, which occurred on 17 August, was used as a vehicle
 for justifying the position and interpretations of the moderate faction
 within the party and may have been intended to counter possible dissidence.
 The general pattern which can be discerned in these articles does not
 differ from that well established over the years in PKI material.  However,
 there are certain,focal points around which the main arguments revolve,
 and a consideration of these highlights the principle areas in which the
 established party line may be being challenged for both practical and
 theoretical reasons.
 The most basic of these problems is the question of the, present stage
 of the Indonesian revolution and its ultimate goal.  In a 10 August 1960
 artie1e, Umar, who is not further identified, spelled. out the "orthodox"
 position by asserting that the August Revolution could only be a national
 democratic revolution or a "bourgeois democratic revolution of the new
 type."  He said that "it does not yet have the form of a socialist revo-
 lution. ? But neither )is it ; a'revolution' which leads' to ,capitalism.  In
 short, as explained by D. '    Aidit, lithe perspectives. of the Indonesian-.
 revolution are socialism and Communism."
 On 20 August 1960, A. Anwar Sanu.s:L, a member of the Central Committee,
 published a further definition of the PKI's view of the stages of revo-
 lution.  He distinguishes between the national democratic stage, whose
 task is to abolish "imperialism" and the remnants of feudalism completely
 and create a transitional society between capitalism and socialism, and
 the socialist stage, in which "all forms of exploitation will be ended."
 Here he is  careful to specify that exploitation by, indigenous private
 entrepreneurs is included in that to be ended and that the end of indi-
 vidttal ownershipf&the means of production will mean the end of indi-
 vidual  ownership of land.  Sanusi repeats the assertion which has
 appeared so frequently in recent PKI :literature that there is no
 "Chinese wall" between the two stages of revolution, but also notes

 that socialism is the "inevitable future" of every national democratic
 revolution.  The important thing is "to know the limits of this revo-
 lution" and thus to avoid "stage-jumping" which would endanger it.  For
 example, he says, nationalization of all land at the present stage would
 be premature, for it would make a real national front impossible by
 alienating the peasants.  On the other hand, an interpretation which
 would, permit the continued ownership of large industries by "imperialist"
 capital and would even allow for new foreign capital investment in
 Indonesia would be rightist.
 Sanusi makes these points in an appeal for correct understanding of
 the 1945 Constitution, for "there is a danger that the 1945 Constitution
 may be interpreted as a socialist constitution and so give rise to a
 leftist and sectarian line.  There is also a danger that it may be in*
 terpreted in a rightist and even in a counterrevolutionary way."  He
 indicates clearly that impatience exists in regard to the slow progress
 of the revolution by almost apologizing for the fact that the socialist
 stage has not yet arrived, despite the passage of 15 years since the
 August Revolution.  He also seems worried about the wide use of the term
 "socialism" in Indonesia at present and the possible misunderstandings
 which may arise from this practice.
 A similar concern was evidenced in an article contributed by Thaher
 Thajeb, a member of the Central Auditing Commission,, on 9 August,which
 insists that the only successful socialism is that of Marxism-Leninism,
 thereby implying the appeal of a less orthodox socialism,
 The idea that orthodoxy is essential is also inherent in the second
 theme which runs through these articles.  It is first stated by Omar when
 he argues that victory can be achieved only if the people support the one
 political party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory and therefore able to
 provide correct leadership for their struggle.  Later in the article, he
 states the problem even more clearly when he insists that the "historic
 task of leadership of the revolution and the united front can be borne
 by no other class that the proletariat."  TJmar cites the failure of the
 proletariat itself and of the peasants in Indonesia to understand this
 as a major weakness, particularly in the development of antifeudal
 peasant movements.  Given this need for proletarian leadership of the
 revolution, the party of the proletariat "must preserve its political
 and organizational independence and ideological purity" in the united
 front.  Hence the current PKI slogan "unite and struggle."
 In discussing this, Umar quotes a passage from Aidit's report to the
 fourth plenary session of the PKI central committee in 1956 calling for
 constructive criticism of the democratic groups allied with the party
 in the united front.  Umar applies this policy by inference to the 8 July
 1960 poliburo criticism of certain policies and members of the cabinet,
 arguing that such criticism will save rather than destroy the united
 front.

 Aidit himself discusses this problem in an article marking the a,uhi,ver-
 sary              of  the August Revolution which appeared in the 17 August 1960
 Harlan Rakjat. ..He reaffirms the PKI position that the united front must
 comprise the  wavering middle forces" as well as the progressives.but:,that
 it must rely primarily on the latter as "it is impossible to rely on the
 wavering forces.  He bolsters his argument with a quotation from Lenin,
 "it is only the proletariat which can be a, real fighter for democracy,"
 and warns that the proletariat must be joined in this struggle by the
 peasants if the bourgeoisie is not to take over the democratic revolution
 and distort it.  The same refrain appears elsewhere in this issue of
 Harlan Rakjat, in an article by the foreign editor' which warns that the
 leadership of the revolution must not, be surrendered to nonrevolutionaries.
 Another aspect to this question of who is to participate in the revo-
 lution is indicated by Umar's statement that efforts at cooperation in
 the united front will fail if any cooperative bodies which 'are formed are
 not based on the alliance of proletariat and peasants and if they do not
 generate revolutionary actions by the broad masses.  The purpose of such
 revolutionary action is, of course, to move the government to action in
 its turn.  A suggestion that the Indonesian. government has perhaps been
 less responsive that the PKI may have wished is made by M. T. Peleng,
 candidate member of the Central Committee, on 13 August, when he condemns
 certain' unnamed "leaders" who heed only their own interests and warns that
 the people can distinguish between true and false leaders.
 Aidit takes this idea and ostensibly basing-his argument on a state-
 ment made by Sukarno on National Veterans Day, 10 August 19'60, that "the
 Indonesian revolution must proceed from above and from below; a revolution
 from above is not a revolution because the masses do not participate and
 that which is only from below is a rebellion," he shifts the emphasis
 slightly in his August Revolution anniversary article to warn that "it
 is only possible to prevent a revolutionary rebellion if the revolution
 also proceeds from above."  If it does not, "a revolutionary rebellion
 is a necessity."  Aidit elaborated further on this concept in a 19, August
 speech which was published in the 22 August Harlan Rakjat.  He demanded
 a revolutionary "retooling" of the government apparatus to ensure proper
 governmental response to the thoughts and feelings of the people, defining
 the revolutionary process as "measures from above and pressures from
 below."
 The final point emphasized in this series, as well as in most PKI
 writingi, deals with the target of the revolution.  This remains "imperi-
 alism and feudalism," although in these, particular articles "imperialism "
 is given more attention.  Thaher Thajeb insists that Indonesia must not
 compromise with or waver in its attitude towards "imperialism."  Such
 compromise is blamed by M. T. Peleng for all of Indonesia's current pro-
 blems.  Furthermore, he warns that "the influence of imperialism in
 Indonesia is still extensive 'and feu&O-ism rune rampant.  The reformists'

 home is equaled by that of the revisionists on'the international scene.

 Although they are not mentioned specifically in this series, Umar,
 article, cites as one of the lessons drawn from the experience of the
 August Revolution the fact that cooperation with other nations struggling
 for national independence and consequent opposition to "every form of
 bourgeois chauvinism" are necessary.  Furthermore, the Harian Rakiat
 foreign editor insists that there must be no compromise with the  imperi-
 alists" and that if there is firm unity against them, they will back down
 both domestically and. internationally as they are only "paper tigers."
 In sum, during the period reviewed, the PKI has made no new departures
 in either theory or practice but has simply further clarified its already
 known positions.  Its overriding concern still seems to be to defend a
 policy falling somewhere between that of the reformists, who would allow
 the revolution to be captured by the bourgeois liberals,. and that of the
 "stage-?jumpers," who would.move on to a socialist revolution without
 bourgeois allies.  It might be possible to draw an analogy between the
 position in which this middle-of-the-road faction finds itself within
 the PKI and that of the Soviet party within the international Communist
 movement.  Assuming the validity of such a comparison, a continuing am-
 bivalence in PKT policy is to be expected, for the party's dominant
 faction. will be forced to modulate the tone of its pronouncements depend-
 ing on the audience which it is addressing, just as the Soviets pursue
 a not always well-demarcated line between revisionists and leftist
 deviationista.

 Activitie's of Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Association
 An editorial in Unen ,on 21 September 1960, "Ten Days of Friendship
 Among Neighboring States," dealt  with the activities of the Mongolian-
 Chinese Friendship Association.                              A summarized translation in Chinese
 appeared in Jenmmin J h of 22 September 1960.  The following is a
 translation of the Mongolian text.  The portion of the text in parentheses
 is not included in the Chinese translation.
 "Ten days of Mongolian-Chinese friendship activities begin today
 throughout Mongolia.  The occasion is a suitable one for further-de-
 veloping friendly relations between the two countries.  (Six hundred
 and fifty million) Chinese people, under the leadership of the Com-
 munist Party, have transformed the appearance of tleir native land and

 have attained great success within a short period of time in the field of
 socialist construction.  The Chinese people have successfully accomplished
 the socialist industrialization of their country, and are now engaged in
 carrying out a revolution in cultural and technical matters.  The form of
 collective property in the field of economics has been completely SUC,4 ,
 cessful.  (A mere glance at last year reveals the fact that the over-all
 production of the Chinese people in industry and agriculture increased
 31 percent over 1958.  In 1959, the Chinese people produced 13 million
 tons of steel, 34+7 million tons of coal, 41 billion kilowatt-hours of
 electricity, and 54+0 billion chin of grain.)  The heroic Chinese people
 have been extremely successful. in the work of peaceful construction.
 (They have also contributed continuously their share in the great com-
 petitive struggle between socialist and capitalist economic system.  By;
 'do doing, they have demonstrated that they are continuing to increase, the
 power of the socialist camp under the leadership of the Soviet Union.
 "The. influence of the great October Socialist Revolution was immedi&
 ately felt by both the Mongols and the Chinese.  The victorious Mongolian
 revolution of 1921, followed by the victory of the Chinese revolution in
 1949, opened up a new period in'the friendly relations between the people
 of Mongolia and China, whose past bad, witnessed long-standing ties of
 friendship as neighbors.  This great friendship between the two countries
 was demonstrated in 1952 by the agreement on mutual economic and cultural
 cooperation, with the result that all features supporting proletarian
 internationalism were further developed and greatly strengthened.
 "The aid provided by the Chinese people to the Mongolian people has
 been very extensive.  (By means of a grant of 160 million rubles.-and a
 long-term loan of 100 million rubles, the People's Republic of China has
 caused the following to appear in town and country throughout Mongolia:
 in Su'he Baatar City have been erected the electric power plant, a model
 building, the plywood industrial complex, and a paper factory; and in
 Ulan Bator, a textile factory, highway bridges, theOrhon irrigation
 system, and additional fine buildings.  In this manner, the Chinese
 workers and industrious technicians have contributed much energy in the
 construction of socialism in. Outer Mongolia.  Moreover, the Mongols are
 learning a great deal from the rich experience of the Chinese.)
 "A few months ago, Chou En-lai, Premier of the State Council of the
 People's.Republic of China, arrived in Outer Mongolia on a friendly visit.
 He signed the 'Mongolian People's Republic and the People's,Republic of
 China Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Aid,'''The Agreement on Economic
 and Technical Aid to the Mongolian People's Republic on the Part of the
 People's Republic of China,' and the 'Agreement on Scientific and Tech,-'

 and c:boperation for .the people '.of Mongolia and'.China.  These treaties. and
 agreements have not only greatly expanded the.friendship and cooperation
 of our two countries, but are also..highly.,eignificant for.strengthening
 the solidarity of the socialist camp headed by. the Soviet Union and for
 strengthening peace and security among nations.
 (According to the agreements drawn up at the time of Premier ChoulEn-
 lai4s friendly visit to our country, the People's Republic of China is to
 provide a loan of 200 million rubles and to take part in the following
 large-scale enterprises: metallurgical works capable of producing 100,000
 tons of steel a year; a cotton textihe factory capable of producing 30
 million meters of cloth a year; glass production; a sugar plant; apart-
 ment houses covering an area of 220,000 square meters of land; and a new
 culture building.)
 "(In the problem of carrying out successfully the Third Five-Year Plan,
 which will develop both the national economy and culture of the Mongolian
 People's Republic during 19611965, the large amount of generous aid
 offered by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of'China helps to
 speed up the material and technical basis of socialism in Outer Mongolia.
 Instructors from these countries are also applying their energy to meet
 the educational needs of our country.)
 "The many millions of Chinese people are completing the work of the
 Second Five-Year Plan 3 years ahead of schedule.  The great lessons aVaila-
 ble from the.rich experience of the millions of hard-working Chinese, who
 have attained tremendous success in a shorter period of time than ever
 observed previously in world history, are of great value to the Mongolian
 people in their struggle to build socialism.  (The opportunity has now
 arrived for mutual study of the work accomplished by our industrious
 Chinese comrades during the 10 days of activity inaugurated by the
 Mongolian-Chinese  Friendship Association.  During the 10-day -:period,
 aside from extensive training of our people with regard to the phenomenal
 success of the People's Republic of China in the fields of economics and
 culture, evenings?.vilL be spent exchanging experience with Chinese tech-
 nicians and workers.  With regard to their special experience in innova-
 tions, the subject matter will be broadcast by radio on a large-scale to
 explain it in great detail.  By discovering new ways and means, as well
 as their over-all results,, additional material is made available for both
 our party and our public institutions.)
 "The 10 days of Mongolian-Chinese friendship activities will add sig-
 nificant stimulus to the development of Mongolian-Chinese friendly .
 relations and will strengthen the confidence and determination of our
 people in their great struggle to construct socialism."

 Press Reprints Coexistence Portion of "Pravda" Article
 An article in Unen on 30 August 1960, "Problems of War and Peace
 Under Present Conditions," is a summarized translation of an exticle by
 Yu. Frantsev published in Pravda of 7 August 1960.  The following is
 the section of the article called "The General Line of Our Foreign
 Policy."  The Mongolian translation of this section from Russian was
 complete.
 "Leninism arises from the fact that in the final analysis, the problem
 of the victory of a new social system is decided in the all-important
 sphere of the activity of man and in the field of production'Lenin.wrote,
 'The productivity of labor, in the end, is the most important factor con-
 tributing to the victory of a new social system."  This is one of the
 basic precepts of Leninism, defining the process of transition from
 capitalism to socialism, Socialism displays its gigantic resources in the
 field of creative labor productivity.  Throughout the period of the civil
 war, Lenin recognized clearly this major task of the new society.  At the
 height of the embittered battles against the followers of Denikin,. he
 examined closely the question of the interrelationship with capitalist
 countries which were outstanding in technical and economic fields 'during
 that period when socialist and capitalist states exist side by side.'
 Lenin advanced and established the principle of the peaceful coexistence
 of countries with different social systems.
 "With regard to relations between socialist and capitalist countries
 in the present historical period, the principle of peaceful coexistence
 as advanced by Lenin is the only true as well as indispensable route. The
 policy of peaceful coexistence. serves the interests of the working class.
 It serves the interests of all working people as well as Communism itself.
 Today, while fighting against the Cold War policy, we are winning over to
 our side broad sections of,the public in capitalist countries, further.
 isolating the aggressive tactics of monopoly capitalists, both in the
 world arena and within capitalist countries.  This promotes the cause of
 peace, democracy, and socialism.
 "The struggle for peace and for the peaceful. coexistence of. countries
 wits different social systems is the general line of the foreign policy
 of the socialist camp. The peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union
 and of the other socialist countries receives the support and approval of
 all nations.  A clear manifestation of this policy is exemplified by the
 Soviet proposals concerning genera and complete disarmament, the reali-
 zation of which would deliver humanity from the fear of a new war.
 "New and extremely favorable conditions have.arisen now in the strug-
 gle for Communism, compared with the time when the working class first
 assumed power in ouic country.  At that time, the 'charm of bourgeois
 civilization' was quite apparent.  However, along with the advance toward

 Communism in our country, the 'charm of bourgeois civilization' di-
 minished at about the same rate as the attraction for the bourgeois
 ideas of,workers in capitalist countries.  However, at present, the
 Soviet Union is in a position to demonstrate the material and spiritual
 wealth which the Soviet citizen receives as the result of the creation.
 of the socialist system.
 "The imperialists have long fought against this his         perspective.
 They have openly endeavored to destroy the peaceful competition of social-
 ism with capitalism by means of war.  Hence, by utilizing Cold War methods,
 they have been trying, as Khrushchev has said, 'to force the socialist
 countries to squander their material resources on unproductive goals.'
 Along with the armaments race, they have been attempting to stop the
 development of science and culture in socialist countries so that their
 internal. destruction would discredit the socialist system.  These plans
 of the imperialists have resulted in failure.  The time is not distant
 when the socialist camp will overtake and surpass the capitalist countries
 in per-capita production.  The Soviet Union will have the highest standard
 of living for the workers and the shortest workday, and the people will
 no longer be required to pay taxes.
 "Socialism is gaining great victories in peaceful competition with
 capitalism.  During the last 6 years, our industrial output has increased
 90 percent, whereas that of the US increased only 15 percent.  On the
 whole, industrial production in socialist countries has increased 600
 percent.over the prewar period.  On the other hand, industrial goods in
 capitalist countries approximately tripled during the same period.
 "Socialist society is organized for production of means of production
 and means of consumption instead of production of means of destruction.
 The imperialists have set up the Cold War to avoid open and direct war-
 fare with the socialist camp.                            This has contributed to the increasing
 power of the latter.  At present, the Soviet Union and the world
 socialist camp are in a position to liquidate the Cold War.
 "Time and again the imperialists have concocted wild stories about the
 "aggressivenessof Communism."    Their calculations were aimed at terrifying
 the people in bourgeois countries.  However, as the result of the con-
 sistent peaceful policy of the Soviet Union and of our party, the imperi-
 alists have demonstrated their true nature as aggressors.  Their 'peace-
 loving' mask has been torn off.  All people blessed with common sense are
 able to see that the Communists, the Soviet Union, and all socialist
 countries are unyielding in their fight for peace, and that Communism
 embraces the ideology and policy of creation which is responsible for
 the peaceful and constructive work of the masses."

 Part 2.  EASTERN EUROPE
 Deviations from the Soviet line on peaceful coexistence are denounced
 in East Germany and Hungary and openly espoused in Yugoslavia, where a
 Soviet attack on Kardelj's book on socialism and war is answered.  In both
 East Germany and Hungary, there,are rejections of ideological coexistence
 in the sphere of the social superstructure, the specific targets being
 attempts to water down Marxist doctrine on the class struggle and class-
 political structure.  However, the East. German press contains a "revision"
 of the Soviet position in the form of a statement which categorically re-
 jects peaceful coexistence with West Germany.  Czechoslovak and Rumanian
 studies denounce revisionist manifestations in the economic base.  A
 Czechoslovak report on the 1959 Party Eistorians Conference emphasizes the
 "falsity of revisionist hopes" for a "second, industrial revolution" in the
 West which would bring about changes in production relations in the direc-
 tion of socialism.  In Rumania, the leading economic monthly pointed to
 the "absurdity" of revisionist attempts to identify capitalist nationaliza-
 tion with socialization of the means of production by the dictatorship of
 the proletariat.
 The problem of existentialism occupies the attention of publications
 in Hungary and Poland.  In both cases, the primary complaint'is against
 the prediction contained in Sartre's latest book of the eventual acceptance
 of existentialism by Marxism.  The Hungarian press also provides the added
 feature of linking Agnes Heller's views on individual freedom with existen-
 tialism.  Concerning sociological research, the East German press publishes
 a denunciation of the revisionist tendency to evolve an independent Marxist
 sociology separate from historical materialism.  This form of revisionism
 apparently holds an appeal for a Yugoslav sociologist who bases his critique
 of Soviet sociology on its "doctrinaire 'explanation! and guidance of social
 processes."

 with results of our historical science, attempting to overcome the short-
 comings and mistakes of the past, and to ideologically and politically arm
 the broad cadres of political workers not only for the struggle against
 unfriendly ideologies, but also for the solution of the new tasks arising
 from the construction of socialism in our country...."
 Ten issues of the Almanac had been published by January 1960.  The
 following excerpts of the proceedings of the Fifth Bucharest Conference of
 Communist Historians, held 25 August -- 2 September 1959, are from an
 account of this conference by Miroslav Boucek which appeared in the No 10,
 January 1960.-issue of Prispevky k dejinam KSC.' (A full translation of:
 this article appeared in Joint Publications Research Service Report No
 6007, 26 September 1960.)
 "The Bucharest Conference of Historians of the Communist Parties was
 held from 25 August to 2 September 1959.  This was the longest conference
 to.date and the most comprehensive as far as delegate participation was
 concerned.  Representatives of l4 fraternal parties attended the Third
 Prague Conference in 1957 and representatives of 20 countries atlded the Faarth
 Berlin Conference in 1958.  The Fifth Bucharest Conference was attended
 by 63 delegates who represented as many as 25 Communist and workers parties.
 The conference was attended by representatives of institutes, institutions,
 and commissions for the history of the Communist Party of the following
 countries:  Soviet Union, People's Republic of China, Austria, Albania,
 Belgium,, Bulgaria, Great Britain, Hungary, Vietnam, German Democratic
 'Republic, German Federal Republic, Denmark, India, Indonesia, Italy,
 Canada, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Rumania,
 France, Czechoslovakia, Chile, Sweden, and representatives of the periodi-
 cal Problems of Peace and Socialism.  This growing number of countries
 participating in conferences of party historians shows the continuously
 expanding cooperation and close mutual contacts of party historians in
 individual countries.  This also increases the responsibility which indi-
 vidual historians must assume in their work, because their work literally
 becomes a part of the over-all tasks of Marxist historiography.
 "The conference dealt with two principal questions.  First, the
 question of the Communist and workers parties' struggle fox' the unity of
 the working class and, second, the tasks of historical science in the
 struggle! against contemporary revisionism.  Introductory reports were
 presented on both principal points on the agenda, followed by a discus-
 sion in which 36 conference participants took part.
 "Comrade G. Vasilichi, director of the Institute of History of the
 Rumanian Workers Party, presented a report on the struggle of Communist
 and workers parties for the unity of the working class.  The principal
 report (to which the report by Comrade E. Sereni, head of the Italian
 delegation, was closely related) contained three parts.  The first part
 dealt with the theoretical foundations of the fight for the unity of the

 working class, which is a requirement if the working class is to gain
 political power.  The second part contained a survey of the successful
 struggle for working class unity in the People's Democracies, and inserted
 an attempt to draw generalizations from this struggle.  The third part
 dealt with the problems of the struggle for the unity of the working class
 in capitalist countries after World War II.
 "The entire discussion was concentrated on those questions.  The fol-
 lowing persons took part in the discussion:  V. Joannes (France), F. Knittel
 (German Democratic Republic), S. Madchi. (Albania), Le Manh Trinh (Vietnam),
 E. Sereni (Italy), Kim Ghen In (forth,?" Korea), A. Buchmann (German Federal
 Republic), L. Dugersuren (Mongolia), 11. Boucek (Czechoslovakia),.A. Aizmer
 (Poland), S. Balint (Hungary), J. Rosner (Austria), T. Bakri (Indonesia),
 E. Nekocha (Chile), J. Jacobs (England), W. Sidney (Canada), K. Vasiliev
 (Bulgaria), and S. Dange (India).
 "It has been demonstrated convincingly that to achieve working class
 unity through struggle is a historical necessity resulting from capitalist
 production methods and from the position of the working class in the capi-
 talist society.  The laws of class struggle in capitalist society create
 tendencies toward working class unity.  In the beginning, they unite in
 an elementary and unorganized fashion to defend their immediate economic
 interests; only when revolutionary worker parties are established and
 strengthened does the struggle for real. political unity of the working
 class become the real thing.
 "'Theoretical conclugions and generalizations, based on many years of
 experience of the Communist parties, were the starting` points of almost
 all contributions to the discussion.  However, it appeared that theoretical
 generalizations of experiences lagged behind., especially after the Seventh
 Congress of the Communist International.  The delay in generalizations was
 particularly apparent with regard to experiences gained by the Communist
 and workers parties in their struggle for working class unity during World
 War II and in the postwar era.  The Declaration of Communist 'and Workers
 Parties, approved in Moscow in 1957, generalized these experiences in the
 most elementary fashion, but historians still must work out the new con-
 clusions and experiences which the international Communist movement has
 gained in the last 20-years.
 "The introductory report to the :second point onthe agenda, the tasks
 of historical science in the struggle against contemporary revisionism, was
 presented by N. I. Shatagin, Doctor of Historical Sciences and head of the
 Soviet delegation.  The following comrades took part in the discussion:
 K. Endre (Hungary), Le Manh Trinh (jorth7 Vietnam), T. Danishewski (Poland),
 P. Reiman (Czechoslovakia), S. Manushi (Albania), T.'Ch'un-fan (People's
 Republic of China), L. Einicke (German Federal Republic), L. Michelsen

 and J. Jacobs (England).
 "The report and discussion were based primarily on the Declaration
 of'Communist,and Workers Parties.  The declaration pointed out that
 revisionism is the greatest danger at present because it is a direct mani-
 festation of bourgeois ideology in the labor movement.  The greatest majority
 of the Communist parties concentrated attention in their ideological work
 on the struggle against revisionism.. The substance of revisionism was un-
 masked successfully and destroyed ideologically;.. and where the revisionists
 attempted to take over the party, they were successfully smashed, also
 from the organization viewpoint.
 "Institutes and commissions for the history of Communist parties joined
 actively in this foremost task of the Communist parties.  A series of pub-
 lications were issued to combat revisionism.  Three Leninist almanacs against
 revisionism were published in the Soviet Union, and almanacs of historical
 articles about the struggle against revisionism were published in almost
 every country.  The works of classic writers were of enormous importance
 in this struggle.  Among these, the complete works of V. I. Lenin were pub-
 lished in many countries.  A new textbook of the CPSU and a six-volume
 history of the CPSU, which is being prepared for publication, will be a
 big help in unmasking falsifiers and revisionists who are attempting to
 discredit the glorious road of the CPSU.
 "However, it appears that while we paid greater attention to problems
 of the history of the Communist Party, particularly in the last years, we
 did not pay enough attention to the history of the international workers
 and Communist movement.  Therefore, the foremost task for the coming years
 will be to prepare a historical outline of the international Communist
 movement.   The Institute of Marxism-Leninism attached to the Central Com-
 mittee. CPSU, in cooperation with other scientific institutes in the USSR,
 is preparing for publication aotwo-volume history and a two-volume almanac
 of documents of the Communist International; a three-volume history of the
 worker and national-liberation movement in the 19th and 20th centuries; a
 two-volume history of the European workers movement after World War II; a
 two-volume historical survey of the workers movement in the Far East; and
 a two-volume history of the Second International.  Through a common effort,
 all the institutes of history are to prepare a popular textbook on the
 international workers and Communist movement and an almanac of articles on
 the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the First
 International.  The Bucharest Conference has directed all the institutes
 and commissions for the history of the Communist parties to proceed in
 this direction, to pay greater attention to questions of the international
 workers and Communist movement and to questions of most recent history.

 "The report and the discussions concerning the second point concerned
 three problems which were subjected to concentrated attacks by the revision-
 ists.  First, they covered the role of the.Communist parties in the con-
 temporary workers movement.  The attacks of revisionists in this direction
 are well known.  They deny that there is any need for the existence of Com-
 munist parties.                    Their attacks against democratic centralism are equally
 dangerous.  This attack is deliberately concealed, but\its basic aim is to
 liquidate the Communist parties, because to violate the basic organizational
 principle of establishing Marxist-Leninist parties means to convert the
 Communist Party into a professional association,, as it is so much advocated
 by the revisionists.
 "That is why the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the congresses of all
 the other Communist parties attributed so much importance to, questions
 concerning the party's role.  This provides an urgent task for the histori-
 ans:  to show ever more penetratingly the real role of the Communist Party
 in the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie,: to show that
 the Communist Party must have a leading role if victory is to be won over
 the bourgeoisie.  More attention must be paid to the role of the Communist
 Party during the phase of building socialism, particularly with regard to
 the new views of the 21st Congress of the CPSU about the growing leading
 role and continuous strengthening of the organizational role of the Com-
 munist Party during the phase of building socialism and during the transi-
 tion to Communism.
 "The second problem under discussion concerned special characteristics
 of the contemporary workers movement.  the revisionists,  who  base their
 views on new phenomena occurring in the development of capitalism, arrive
 at conclusions in which they even tally about the so-called second industrial
 revolution; according to them, the latter will automatically bring about
 changes in production relationships in the same way it happened in the
 first industrial revolution -- though this time in a socialist direction.
 This question is related to another problem:  the possibility of a transi-
 tion from capitalism to socialism in individual countries.  The revisionists
 claim that capitalism transforms itself gradually into socialism and that
 therefore there is no need for any party or for any special effort on the
 part of the working class to fight for socialism.  The report and the dis-
 cussions fully disproved these false 'theories' of the revisionists.  The
 discussion presented an almost complete analysis of the new phenomena in
 the capitalist world, based consistently on Marxism.  Though these problems
 are more in the nature of economic analyses and relate more to tasks of
 economics and philosophy, historians maist also remain on guard, because
 the repercussions of these 'theories' are frequently sneaked into the record
 of history by the revisionists.  This was borne out of a series of recent
 cases in Poland and Hungary.

 "The report from the conference would not be complete without mention-
 ing the work of the commissions.  The commissions held their sessions in
 the afternoons and discussed the following subjects:  (1), a proposal to
 draft a popular textbook on the international workers and Communist move-
 ment;                          (2)  the problems of publishing party documents; and (3) an exchange
 of experiences.  After the deliberations, the commissions accepted a re-
 commendation addressed to individual institutes and institutions for the
 history of the Communist parties.
 "The proposal for an international textbook, which was submitted for
 discussion by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism attached to the Central
 Committee CPSU, was approved in substance.  The textbook is to be completed
 by 1963, and all institutes of history and the most important commissions
 on the history of the Communist Party in capitalist countries are to par-
 ticipate in its preparation.  The textbook will summarize the history of
 the workers and Communist movement from the rise of the working class to
 the present.  An editorial board has been created for the textbook; its
 members are representatives of institutions and institutes of history
 from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia,
 Poland, the GDR, Rumania, Italy, and France.  The Institute of Marxism
 Leninism of the Central Committee CPSU was put in charge of coordinating
 and concentrating the material.
 "A recommendation of the second commission, which is engaged in
 publishing party documents, states that in the future the institutes of
 history should pay more attention to an extensive. publication of party
 documents.  Collections of documents are important supplements for,the
 study of the history of the Communist Party of each country; at the same
 time they are a means for detecting all falsifiers.  Party documents in-
 cluded in the almanac should be published without any alterations of the
 text.  The system of annotations should be prepared with particular care.
 The question of publishing documents which were prepared by a collective
 of workers and signed by persons who later became renegades will be decided
 separately in each case.  Since a number of institutes have issued their
 own instruction on the publication of documents, the conference recommends
 that, on the basis of these instructions, a common effort be made to out-
 .1ine general methodological principles for the publication of party docu-
 ments.
 "The third commission recommended that the institutes of party history
 intensify their mutual cooperation.  When the institutes of history work
 on individual questions which are dealt  with by several institutes, these
 institutes must be in constant touch; they must exchange their material and
 consult each other.  Most of the institutes recently prepared a bibliography
 on the history of the workers movement.  The commission recommended that
 copies of these bibliographies be sent to the Institute of Marxism-Leninism
 of the Central Committee, CPSU, which will coordinate the entire project.

 In the same way, it is necessary to intensify the exchange of,archive docu-
 ments; it is therefore recommended that  the  institutes  organize
 exchange visits of archive workers.  It is recommended that the institutes
 of history cooperate more closely in p.iblishing periodicals by exchanging

 Ideological and Cultural Revisionism
 East German sources have reflected to an increasing extent the dilemma
 of attempting to justify to zealous party members a peaceful resolution of
 the "basic contradiction" between East and West Germany (i.e., between the
 'peace-loving forces" of East Germany and the "militarist imperialists" of
 West Germany), while at the same time cultivating and building up this,
 contradiction to the East German populace to the point of denying that
 ,peaceful coexistence with West Germany is at all possible at present.  By
 setting up the "militarist-imperialist" issue as a barrier to coexistence,
 East Germany appears to be adhering, deliberately or not, to the Chinese
 view.  The following statements from the No 18, September 1960, issue, of
 Neuer Weg further indicates, that many party officials have not yet been
 brought into line with the Soviet view:
 "Members of party managements in our Kreis fBerlin-Mittel said that
 there is nothing new in the decision of the Central Committee...on the
 results of the Bucharest conference.  They said that we have been talking
 of coexistence for a long time, as well as of the...possibilities,of
 maintaining peace....  These comrades have not studied the decision well.
 "Several comrades in one seminar 01-n the other han 7 said that imperi-
 alism has always brought forth new wars....  They said that as long as
 imperialism exists, there will be wars.... These comrades have clearly
 characterized imperialism correctly, but have overlooked the new situation
 in the world'-in which imperialism is no longer the ruling force....
 "In the seminar, the opinion arose that the imperialists would never
 surrender and that,. thus, peaceful coexistence of states with different
 social orders is not possible...."
 An article entitled "The Basic Contradiction in Germany" in the No
 6, 1960, issue of Deutsche Zeitschrift fuer Philosophie (DZfP) says, "As
 propaganda experiences show, there are eLuany-who cannot understand from a
 theoretical viewpoint that a deep antagonistic contradiction',can be re-
 solved peacefully and thus, gradually.  On the other hand, there are others
 who from a practical standpoint cannot imagine that the basic solution of
 the antagonistic contradiction which demands the victory of the peaceful

 democratic forces in West Germany and the deposing of the aggressive
 imperialist forces of financial capital, can take place without open,
 violent, military fight....  From the demand ft-hat the "aggressive imperi-
 alist" forces in West Germany be eliminateg...arises the question of
 whether this is not a case of the GDR interfering in the internal affairs
 of West Germany and whether the policy of peaceful coexistence applies to
 the relation between the two German states.  He who wants to give a 'yes'
 or 'no' answer to this question understands neither the content of the
 national German question nor that of peaceful coexistence."  (However, a
 local party secretary in Bezirk Magdeburg, gave a clearly negative answer
 to the possibility of peaceful coexistence between East and West Germany
 in the 3'September 1960 issue of the Magdeburg Volksstimme.)  The above
 article in the DZfP further: said, "In any case (and on this point the
 policy of the SED Jocialist Unity  Arty. of Germanf and the KPD fCom-
 munist Party of German basically differs from that of all revisionists),
 solution. of the basic contradiction in Germany is'only possible through
 revolutionary means, i.e., by overcoming the aggressive militaristic
 forces in West Germany and not by cooperating with these forces....  Under
 certain circumstances the... contradiction can be-peacefully resolved... if,
 for instance, the progressive side of the contradiction was so strop  that
 it could. determine... the solution.  I do not consider exact correc/those
 views which intensify the antagonistic contradictions....  For example, the
 fourth issue of the series,Wissenschaftliche Weltanschauung, says 'Antagon-
 istic contradictions do not become less severe in the course of development,
 but rather grow and deepen.  The development of antagonism leads as a
 rule to violent conflicts of opposing forces which usually end in violent
 disagreement....'  This generalization, I think, lacks historical immediacy."
 In East German sources, the question of determinism and the applicability
 of dialectical materialism to aspects of modern science continue to be dis-
 cussed.  The September 1960 issue of Einheit includes an article on deter-
 minism end modern biology which points out that the complex problem of
 causality, including correlations, dynamic and static legality, and "organ-
 izedness" (organisiertheit), must be solved by joint work on the part of
 Marxist philosophers and natural scientists.  The No 6, 1960, issue of,
 'DZfP (signed for the press on 15 May 1960) includes an article, "The
 Philosophic Significance. of Heisenberg'e Indeterminate Relations," which
 reiterates the importance of differentiating between dialectical and
 mechanical determinism.  This point is again made in the same issue of
 DZfP in one of the contributions in a survey of articles (compiled by a
 Czech) from 1959 issues of the Czechoslovak philosophical journal, Filo-
 sofi    Casopis.  In this survey, an article entitled "On Mechanism in
 the Concept of Historical Materialism" severely criticizes the Czechoslo-
 vak revisionist, Tondl, for his "mechanistic" view of causality..

 Tondi is denounced in two other articles in the survey, essentially
 fro reducing Marxist philosophy to an "epistemological and neopositivist"
 problem.  Also included in this series is criticism of the philosophic
 and sociological views of the "influential representative of Czechoslovak
 positivism during the inter-World War period," Josef Kral.  An article in
 the No 5, 1959, issue of the Czechoslovak philosophical journal, entitled
 "Pseudo Materialist Tendencies in Our Philosophy," objects to the "neo
 positivist tendencies in contemporary Czechoslovak philosophy and shows
 that, in addition to these tendencies, there are also Hegelianizing,
 pseudo Marxist tendencies influenced by Lukacs and Lefebvre.  In an article
 Lource not give 'Classes and the Real. Structure of Society,' K. Kosik
 represents... that pseudo-Marxist view of social development which Lukacs
 presented in his book, Geschichte und f.assenbewusstsein (History and Class
 Consciousness).....  Similar pseudo-Marxist tendencies are also manifested
 in many other articles and publications  in Czechoslovakia] where the work
 of the young Marx is used to replace materialistic and revvolutionary-
 democratic ideas by unmaterialistic concepts....  Lukacs...underestimated
 the possibilities that imperialist, bourgeois ideology has for exploiting
 and misusing parts of Hegelian philosophy.  To be sure, criticism of
 Hegelianizing tendencies in Marxism must not mean a return to nihilistic
 relations harmful to Marxism, to German: classic philosophy.  Both tendencies
 (the neopositivist and Hegelianizing) are essentially un-Leninist, Social
 Democratic tendencies in Marxist philor-...ophy....
 The No 6, 1960, issue of DZfP also includes an essentially favorable
 review of the East German book, Beitrae a zur Erkenntnistheorie and das
 Verhaeltnis von  Sprache  and  Denken ' Contributions  to  the  Theory
 of Knowledge and t e Relation Between Speech and Thought), by Erhard
 Albrecht.  In this book the following critical remarks are made against
 the Polish philosopher Adam Schaff:
 "fAlbrechg questions whether truth is only an attribute of judgments
 (c.s A. Schaff says)....  Albrecht sees in Schaff's view a 'separation from
 the sensory-empiric and logicorational step in the process of knowledge.'...
 He .lbrechg opposes any identification of reality and truth',, and says that
 only reality, and not truth, exists independently from judgments-ft
 The entire book appears to deal with many of the main issues on which
 revisionist views have developed.  For example, "In connection with cau-
 sality..., Albrecht discusses the often-asked question as to whether the...
 defense of determinism does not lead to fatalism and to a denial of free-
 dom."                  In another section of the book, "Albrecht... rejects the revisionist
 line held by Herneck and Havemann in 1956 and 1957 which... transformed the
 Marxist, theory of knowledge into pure methodology and, thus, separated its
 world view from its class-political content."  Albrecht is also described
 as the first East German philosopher to dispute modern bourgeois ontology
 as represented by N. Hartmann.  With regard to neo-Thomism, which is des-
 cribed as the philosophic basis of political clericalism, Albrecht says,

 "It is the strongest organized ideological force of the present-day West
 European bourgeoisie which even has some effect in socialist countries
 where the Catholic faith is widespread (particularly Poland and Hungary).
 Thus, all revisionist theses on ideological coexistence and all...attempts
 to weaken the contrast between objective-idealistic neo-Thomism and
 Marxism-and to offer subjective idealism as the common opponent (as is
 done in the works of G. Lukacs) are all the more dangerous."
 Several isolated references have been found to tendencies toward
 creating a sociology independent of historical materialism.  This charge
 was made by Dr Kalab from the Charles University in Prague at the 9-11 May
 1960 conference of East European Bloc social scientists in Berlin (re-
 ported in the August 1960 issue of Einheit).  Also, an article entitled
 "Historical Materialism and Practical Social Research," in the No 5, 1960,
 issue of DZfP (signed for the press on 31 March 1960) includes the follow-
 ing statements.
 "The methodological directives worked out by Lenin in his work Who
 Are the 'Friends of the People' and How do They Fight Against the Social
 Democrats?, are the...bases which Marxist social scientists should use
 in investigating the social processes in the GDR and in West Germany.
 They /These directives7 cannot be replaced by anything else, neither by
 a special Marxist sociology which exists next to historical materialism
 as an independent discipline with its own object, which has been variously
 proposed especially by revisionist groups, nor by worshipping bourgeois
 sociology and uncritically accepting their methods, techniques, and thus
 also their basic theoretical elements. Historical materialism is the
 Marxist sociology....  Where practical attempts have been made to create
 a Marxist sociology which boasts of an independent right to exist next
 to historical materialism..., historical materialism has been replaced
 by bourgeois sociology."  This was the charge brought against Juergen
 Kuczynski, the former revisionist East German historian, in an article
 in the No 5, 1957, issue of the Soviet philosophical journal, Voprossy
 filosofi which was reprinted in the No 3, 1960, issue of the DZfP(seeee
 Eastern Europe Press Survey (101), Summary No 2578, pp 6-9).  As far
 as is known from source references, Kuczynski has not published a
 modification of his views on this; he remains a member of the economic
 section of the East German Academy of Sciences and was listed as one
 of the East German participants at the 11th International Historians
 Conference held in August 1960 in Stockholm.
 Disagreement arose between East German participants at the above-
 mentioned East European social scientists conference in May on the issue
 of "spontaneity."  As reported in Summary No 2830, Review of Communist
 Theoretical Journals (8), two East German Marxist professors (one of them
 was Professor Havemann) were criticized for imparting positive "creative"
 qualities to the concept of "spontaneity" and thus "giving spontaneity
 a certain place in the fields of science and art."

 With regard to art, there have been continued objections to collec~-
 tivizing the profession and to the negative influence imposed, on art by
 the doctrine proclaimed at the April 1958 Bitterfeld Cultural Conference.
 In reference to the first point, an article in the No 5, 1960, issue of
 DZfP says that there are "opportunist and. revisionist distortions and
 simplifications",.. of all kinds which say that the cultural development
 "from I to we" aims toward eliminating the individual personality.  A.
 series of articles appearing in recent issues of the East German youth
 organization weekly, Forum, deplore East German artists' insistence on
 individuality, an attitude relfected in their current slogan.," "Each has
 to wield his own paint brush alone."
 On the second point, this same source says that certain artists
 consider the Bitterfeld directive one which leads to dictatorship by
 the untalented and the dilettante.  Two articles by the same author (one
 in the No 3, 1960, issue of the Weimare:r Beitraege and one in the 21
 August 1960 issue of Forum) admits that artists have "misinterpreted!'
 the Marx/Engels statement in Deutsche Ideologie (German Ideology), which
 says that there will be no painters under Communism -- only persons, among
 others, who happen to paint.  The author insists that this does not mean
 that art will become an avocation or that the artistic level will decline.
 Yet artists continue to point to these precise results now developing in
 East Germany since the Ulbricht doctrixi  was proclaimed at the Bitterfeld
 meeting.
 Official Party Statements Stress Orthodk3xy as Writers Seek New Ideo-
 logical Orientation
 In its combined August-September 1960 issue, the Hungarian theoretical
 journal Tarsadalmi Szemle published a long item titled "For the Lenin Party
 Spirit of Philosophy -- Theses of the Philosophy Work Group Operating With
 the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party Concerning
 the Situation and Tasks of the Philosophical Front."  This article presented
 no startling changes in the party line on philosophy. It pointed to the
 danger of nationalism, and it condemnel the revisionist deviations of Lukacs
 and his students (Agnes Heller, Istvan Itermann, and Istvan Meszaros) and
 the revisionist "errors" of Erik Molnar (who still leads discussions on
 economics, sociology, and history both in Hungary and as Hungaxfs represen-
 tative abroad).  It did not, however, applaud the recent work of the
 Hungarian Philosophical Institute in its criticism of Luckacs and. Heller.
 The article gives a general impression of official dissatisfaction with
 current philosophical work and it is an effort to restate the official
 orthodox line.

 Similarly, an article by Endre Molnar titled "Concerning the Laying
 of the Foundations of Socialism" in the "For Propagandists' Work" section
 of the August 1960 Partelet restated the orthodox line on the problem of
 the transition to socialism.  Such articles indicate an increasing concern
 with the ideological justification of the Communist movement and the lead-
 ing role of the party therein, but they do not clearly indicate what pres-
 sures, internal and external, prompt this increasing concern.
 Another article in the August 1960 Partelet did, however, point to
 a problematic internal pressure.  In a discussion of the intellectuals
 policy of the party, Laszlo Nagy noted the "solid political alliance"
 between the intellectuals and the working class, but he deplored the fact
 that the nonparty intelligentsia did not yet stand on the "world-view
 soil of Marxism-Leninism."  He recommended a stepped-up program of ideo-
 logical training but he also noted the party's failure to react quickly
 enough to modern problems.  He said of the intellectuals:  "They are
 seeking the 'modern world view' which gives the answers to the present...."
 He concluded that "Marxism-Leninism is the most progressive ideal of this
 age," and he referred the propagandists to the theoretical statements of
 the CPSU congresses for answers to "the most important questions of our
 age."
 In the Hungarian literary weekly Elet es Irodalom, these problems
 were also discussed from varying viewpoints.  In the 2 September 1960
 issue, Imre Gyore, a confirmed party hack, complained that there were
 groups of writers who "expressed major or minor reservations, even if
 they did; not hostilely oppose the fact of socialist construction."  And
 he added:, "It is a shame not to speak of this."
 Bela Illes, an old Muscovite, also entered the debate in Elet es
 Irodalom.  In the 9 September 1960 issue, although he attempted to
 appear liberal, he stated:  "Literary backwardness can be liquidated...
 only...-when the direction has been indicated, not by the poets, but by
 the party...."  And he added in his conclusion:  "We are free to criti-
 cize everyone, but we are not free to criticize so recklessly...."  Illes
 was answered in the 16 September 1960 issue by the editor of Elet es
 Irodalom, Miklos Szabolcsi, who, while pretending to defend a position
 of strict orthodoxy, wrote:  "The Communist critic, without regard to
 persons, bravely and on principle, with quality and fighting spirit,
 must criticize everything whic1r he considers objectionable ideologically
 or critically....  We will do this in the future too -- we hope, always
 with greater quality and more courage, but at the same time we intend to
 maintain the mood of literary debates which has recently formed, a more
 sober, more resolute, and more polite mood."

 In the 23 September 1960 issue of Elet esIrodd4lom, in a rather el-
 liptical article labeled a "reader9a comment" on the debate on young
 writers, Imre Bata made the following statement:  "The struggle of the
 humanly inspired intellectuals has emerged, a struggle for a scientifi-
 cally equipped, modernly based materialist view and culture.  The time
 question culminates here and becomes here a serious 'concern for the
 young and the mature alike,.,,"
 The September 1960 issue of Na   ..la , the Hungarian world litera-
 ture monthly, also contributed to this veiled ideological debate.  An
 unsigned note of Sartre's Critique de la Raison Dialectigue,while critical
 of Sartre's position, also observed that "that Marxist who ignores the
 individual and the particular to the benefit of the general sins seriously
 against Marxist dialectics."
 A long article by the eminent populist writer Laszlo Nemeth, also in
 the September 1960 Naayvilag, reviewed the short stories and plays of the
 modern Swiss author Durrenmatt,  Judging from the published material, this
 article was commissioned by Nagyvilag as part of its defense of its "mod-
 ernist" policy, but it was also used by Nemeth, apparently, as a pretext
 for presenting his own ideological views.  This use of Durrenmatt was
 noted before in the case of Agnes Heller (see Summary No 2470, Eastern
 Europe Press Survey      and Peter Versa (See Summary No 2598, Eastern
 Europe Press Survey  104).  The following is perhaps the most dramatic
 of Nemeth's many double entendre observations on the paraphrases of
 Durrenmatt:  "The powerful are powerful -- discount this worthless thing
 and oppose them without weapons.  Power can take away everything:  your
 wife, your daughter, even your wisdom; the only one it cannot reach is
 he who has nothing,  So, let man be gray,  Creep, in the guise of foolish-
 ness, as a slave, as a merry pal, into the castle; put up with shame and
 explode the walls from within, with humanity...,"
 Laszlo Kardos, editor of Na    la?, issued an appeal in the September
 1960 issue for an international conference of socialist writers,  Western
 writers are to be excluded so that questions need not be discussed in a
 state of "delicate poise."  Among the outstanding problems that Kardos
 would like to see resolved by the writers (not by the party) are: the
 narrow and broad definitions of socialist realism, the position of criti-=
 cal realism, and modernist literature.
 A curious sidelight on the continuing activity of the literary
 liberals and modernists is Miklos Szabclcsi's recent attack on national-
 ism.  In the 19 August 1960 issue of Elet es Irodalom, Szabolcsi re-
 viewed a recent volume of poetry by Lajos Konya, a Communist poet and a
 leader of the 1956 intellectual revolt.  Szabolcsi praises Konya in
 general, comparing him with Gyula Illyes, but he criticizes Konya's
 "regressive" poems which returned to the "image of the 'eternal people,'"

 In the 9 September 1960 issue of Elet es Irodalom "M. Sz." (Miklos Szabolcsi)
 was more explicit in'his criticism of the poet Gyula Sipos who had written
 of the "Little Hungarians" and the criticism included Peter Veres among
 those writers who entertain ideas of the "eternal Hungarian people" oppos-
 ing the "leaders."  This criticism of the "narodnik-nationalist" view may
 be a result of party pressure, it may be a reflection of the old Hungarian
 argument between cosmopolitan urbanists and nationalistic populists, but
 it is also possible that those liberal and modernist writers who are now
 seeking a new ideology to oppose tyrannical Marxism are deliberately purg-
 ing their ranks of passionate nationalists who, it may be. felt, acted too
 precipitously in 1956 and who could not be counted on in a prolonged inter-

 Ames Heller Condemned -- A Classical Case of Revisionism and Marxist Ethics
 The following is a condensation of "A Critique of the Ethical Revi-

 Marxist categories.  Unlike the literary participants in the "revisionist
 clan" (see Summary No 2622, Communist Revisionism and Dissidence(1)), who
 probably use a Marxist language only insofar as they are forced to do so
 by the situation in which they find themselves, Agnes Heller (like Gyorgy
 Lukacs and. Istvan Hermann, both recently condemm,Fed for revisionism) is a
 convinced Marxist.   As a result she presents a rather tragic picture --
 she seeks to an_querst .e. questions which trouble all humanist, liberal
 intellectuals behind the Iron Curtain, but she is doomed to failure  by
 the inadequacy of the framework into whit: ; she seeks to force the answer.
 Magyar Filozofiai Szeemie is a qua r ter:u y review published by the
 Philosophical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.  The editor
 in chief is Jozsef Szigeti, Maus student turned Lukecs enemy, and the

 Bela Fogerasi, one-time revisionist, later party-line critic of Lukacs,
 always a dialectic. a and. passionate enemy of "pyzyeical idealism," and now

 this feud, but it also describes the genes & concerns with which Agnes
 Heller was dealing when her Introduction to Oenersl Et  cs was adopted as
 a university text in 1957.  Miller's concern with freedom, her hatred of
 tyranny, and her reference to the "ethical socialist" tradition are of
 general, significance even if her answers to the problems raised are very
 limited?

 "Introduction"
 "Agnes Heller is the principal representative of revisionism in
 ethics in. Hungary.  Her 1957 book, though not officially published, was
 widely used as a university:text.  Heller applies to ethics the anti-Marxist
 concepts of Gyorgy Lukacs, which he developed for aesthetics.  But ethics
 stands closer to reality then aesthetics, because aesthetics studies
 reflections whereas ethics studies real relations.  Thus ethics is under
 a greater obligation to take class interest into consideration.  Marxist
 ethics stresses consequences of acts, not the subjective purpose of acts;
 Heller reverses this.  Marxism places politics above ethics; Heller
 pretends to put ethics above politics but really she is putting petit-
 bourgeois views above proletarian views.
 "Lukacs was a latent revisionist; Heller is an outright revisionist.
 Lukacs sincerely tried to fight the bourgeois symptom of deviationism in
 the movement, but he used bourgeois arguments. Heller, on the other hand,
 is an outright revisionist.  Lukacs argued for 'ideological coexistence;'
 but Heller expands this to 'political class peace.'  Lukacs urged a search
 for principles of 'reason' on which all could agree, but Seller actively
 annihilates those elements of Marxism which a bourgeois democrat cannot
 accept.  Lukacs had humanistic illusions but he projected them onto an era
 to which they did correspond; Heller makes these illusions absolutes.
 "`Heller sees the realm of public affairs as alien and hostile to
 ethics, even in a dictatorship of the proletariat; she thus recommends
 retirement from public affairs and she is thus decadent.  For Heller,
 progress is the result of the materializing of a 'good and general humanum.'
 Although Heller gives evidence of being an independent thinker, her think-
 ing, under the pressure of class influence, leads to the old revisionist
 positions.
 "Originally, revisionism was based on the belief that capitalism
 was stable.  Now, revisionism is based on disillusionment over the slow
 solution of problems by socialism.  Thus the old revisionism was active
 but the new revisionism is passive.  Both fail to recognize the primary
 importance of the interests of the working.class.
 "The petit-bourgeoisie always play an ambiguous role; when the
 bourgeoisie are in power they join the proletariat.  But when the workers
 are in power, the petit-bourgeoisie are the base for every kind of devia-
 tion.

 "The degradation of the interests of the'working class comes from
 an emphasis on Hantian ethics.  These Kantian theorists defined the problem
 of socialism as the interest of all mankind.  This was a complete revision
 of the foundations of Marxism.  These theorists questioned materialism and
 declared that dialectics was only a methc r,, an aid to thinking.' Thus, re-
 jecting Hegel, they returned to Kant and dualism and approached value-
 personalism.
 "The new revisionists, unlike the old, must use 'Aesopic language.'
 Thus Heller is responsible not only for what she says, but forwhat can be
 deduced therefrom.  She detaches socialism from the worker movement.  She
 sees the highest manifestation of Marxist moral development in the so-called
 'abstract.' norms.
 "Heller's revisionism has made e_rticulpte the disillusionment of
 large intellectual groups.  Her viewpoint parallels that of Kolakowski but
 Kolakowski is more open and Heller is more dangerous.  In 1953-1954, Heller
 wrote on Chernyeshevski's ethical opionions; she was not then a revisionist.
 But in her 19 6 work Az erkolcsi normak felbomlasa (The Dissolution of
 Ethical Norms) she began to show her revisionism, even though one of the
 authors of this criticism, Maria Makai, failed to notice this at that time.
 "The State"
 "The central thought in Heller's chapter on the stateis the pro-
 blem of man's becoming an instrument.  She thinks that this is a character-
 istic of every state.  Heller wrote:  'This characteristic of the central
 state power was and is,present everywhere, where there, was and is at pre-
 sent a central state power.'  Heller openly and unequivocally denies the
 democratic character of the socialist statd.  According to Heller, the
 fundamental condition of social democracy is the satisfactory amount of
 leisure time that makes it possible for people themselves to participate
 in the direction of the state and of production, so that this function
 would be performed by them and not by an outfit which is alienated from
 them.  Heller wrote:  "With the 8-hour wcrking day, and naturally with
 an even longer working day..., it is objectively impossible for there
 to be a real democracy.'  But Heller goes even further, she not only
 deprives the socialist state of its democratic character, she sees in
 it the main obstacle to the evolution of human freedom.  She denies that
 there is any radical change in quality with the transition from capitalism
 to socialism.  She holds that the dictatorship of the proletariat is a
 necessary evil, which transforms the subjects of the state into instruments,
 using a force which is alien to man and which is democratic, at the very
 best, only in its outward appearance, but with its coercive power it is
 one of the most formidable obstacles in the path of the realization of
 human freedom.

 "In her analysis Heller regards states as general and men as
 singular factors; thus she ignores class.  In fact, the state is the
 instrument of the class.  Heller's fault is that she$absolutizes' the
 .Marxist doctrine about the alienation of the state.  But this is not valid
 for a proletarian, :state.
 "The fountainhead of Heller's opinion is Kantian ethics.  One of
 the fundamental tenets of Kant is that the social phenomena, among them
 .the state and jurisprudence, are to be judged and evaluated according to
 their moral value.  Hegel sees the state as the greatest good, Heller
 sees it as one of the greatest evils, but both mystify the state power.
 Almost all of Heller's teachings can be discovered in the concepts of the
 Neo-Hegelians.  Stirner, one of the founders of anarchism, not only
 mystified the state but held it to be the greatest negative factor,
 Bakunin, in his debates with Marxism, expounded such opinions; but Bakunin
 denied the necessity of the socialist state while Heller stresses  its
 necessity.  Yugoslav revisionism also makes this final step.
 "Heller did not necessarily pick up her ideas from these sources,
 but Heller's concept is old and is a concoction of different idealist,
 anarchist, and revisionist ideas.
 "Force
 "Heller holds that force is a necessary evil and she places the
 emphasis on 'evil.'  Engels opposed such ideas in Duehring, and. Lenin
 opposed them in Otto Bauer.  Heller's theory of force is directed straight
 against the dictatorship of the proletariat.  Heller claims that the
 dictatorship of the proletariat uses force even against the revolutionary
 masses. In 1956-1957, counterrevolutionary powers were temporarily
 successful in influencing wide masses of the working population.  In this
 exceptionally difficult case, so far the only case in the history of
 proletarian dictatorships, the dictatorship of the proletariat actually
 used force not only against the former exploiting classes, but also against
 some groups of the deceived working masses.  But this force could be applied
 successfully and it could be followed by a speedy consolidation only
 because fundamentally it was identical with the interest of the entire
 proletariat.  /Note:  Beginning immediately after "In 1956-1957" above, the
 passage Just given is a full translation of the original passage_7
 "Heller's reasoning recalls the debate which took place 4+O years
 ago between Lenin and Kautsky.  In this case Kautsky came to the same
 conclusion as the anarchist Sorel.  Heller also agrees with Sorel, even
 tough she seems to criticize him.

 "Political Freedom
 "For Heller, the realm of freedom is a realm without a state.. It
 is true that Lenin wrote:  'While there is a state, there is no freedom;
 when there will be freedom, there will be no state,'  But Lenin also wrote:
 'Freedom?  But freedom from the oppression of what class?'  The state of
 the proletarian dictatorship is not free but it guarantees freedom for
 the working class.  Heller relegates the jump into the realm of freedom
 into the distant future.
 "Heiler's questioning is based seemingly on a Marxist thought:
 the emergence, development, and termination of the state is actually
 connected with the division of labor and the productive potentials of labor.
 Heller' s concept, however, disclaims democracy not only for the present
 but also for the future of socialism.  According to Heller, the condition
 of the realization of genuine democracy is such a decrease in working time
 as can be realized only under fully developed. Communism.  The core of
 Heller's fault is that she narrows the idea of democracy' to primitive
 democracy.
 "Law
 "The central idea of Heller' legal concept is that law, like the
 state, is morally negative.  She opposes 'outward' law to 'inner' morality.
 Heiler wrote:  'The legal judgment is always deductive and never inductive
 like the righteous moral judgment.'  But socialist law loses the negative
 characteristics of exploiting legal systems.  The socialist constitution
 and the socialist plan express the will of the people.  Heller'slegal and
 moral concept is a revival of the Ksntian opposition of legality and
 morality.
 "Heiler's revisionist concept reflects the pro- counterrevolutionary
 attitude of certain segments of the petit bourgeoisie who entertained
 utopistic-eclectic day dreams that the counterrevolution would preserve for
 them certain positive acceptable features of socialism (liberation from
 big capitalist competition, termination of economic crises, democracy, etc.)
 and at the same time end the negative features of proletarian dictatorship
 (the, planning which restricts private coam ereial. and industrial activity,
 the dictatorial characteristics of the proletarian dictatorship, etc.).
 In a word,, they desired the contradiction creating bourgeois way of life
 without the contradictions.
 "For Heller, the negation of socialist democracy, relegating its
 realization to the distant future, actually expresses the yearning of the
 petit bourgeoisie for a bourgeois democracy.  It is not that Heller sub-
 jectively identifies herself with this petit-bourgeois standpoint, but that
 she expresses this standpoint in ethical terms.

 "Class Morality
 "Heller denies the existence of 'eternal moral values' but she
 asserts that there are 'universal human values,' such as love, honor,
 honesty, etc.  These values constitute a separate moral sphere; this
 separate moral sphere contains the 'genuinely' human element as opposed
 to elements reflecting class interest.  But Seller is in error because
 universal moral interest can present itself only in a concrete system
 of norms -- in our times, only in the moral system of the worker class.
 Heller herself pointed out earlier that when Chernyeshevski talked about
 the 'abstract universal interest of mankind' he always meant the actual
 revolutionary interests of the Russian peasantry.
 "L, Woltmann mystified the idea of universal interest, and Jaures
 did not fill his most general moral ideas with class content.
 "Heller says that only in a classless society will abstract norms
 become concrete norms.  She denies that traditional moral values have to
 go through the purifying fire of the revolutionary movement to be translated
 into real values.  And she sees the seeds of the morals of the future not
 in proletarian morality but in generally recognized moral traditions.
 "Heller handles formalistically and one-sidedly the question of
 whether a man is justified in reporting his friend to the authorities
 because of political reasons.  According to her, this is the gravest sin
 under any circumstances.  She does not discuss the political-moral contents
 of the friend's deed.  A Marxist recognizes that conflict could arise here;
 only the sectarian would not see any conflict because he sees moral value
 only in :Loyalty to the class interest.
 "Burke's argument against the French revolution, that it destroyed
 the already crystallized moral values and thus threatened the whole world
 system of morality with disintegration, is used by Raymond Aron against
 the proletarian revolution.
 "Why does Heller make so-called abstract norms the criterion for
 all moral norm systemsI  Because she zmkesauniversal 7awout of the' lesson of the
 historical fact that fascism trampled under foot the entire moral inherit-
 ance.                   But when she attacks fascism, she is compelled to polemicize with
 the other extreme (which is for her bad), Communism, with socialist
 morality, which similarly means the impairment of those illusorily inter-
 preted abstract norms that in her eyes are lifted to an ideological
 pedestal.  /-Note,.  Beginning with "she is. compelled," the above passe a is
 a direct translation from the original, as is the following sentence_~  In
 this she gets dangerously close to that 'antitotalitarian' bourgeois theory
 which, alluding to the 'interests of the social and moral status quo' and
 to the 'moral and social interest of humanity,'. brings Communism to a
 common denominator with fascism.  In this Heller is similar to the antifascist
 democracy of Lukacs.

 "Heller wants to defend the moral legacy against 'moral nihilism.'
 She objects that when cadre was selected,, prior to the counterrevolution,
 party and class loyalty were checked but not trs.ditiohal morality.  Heller
 writes'.' 'Among other things, this was the reason that party loyalty could
 become the safe-conduct of cruelty, inhumanity, personal envy, etc.'
 "Heller has become a spokesman for the old line  df  ethical:
 socialism -- the  line of the neo-Kantians of Marburg and Freipurg, of
 Windelband, Vorlander, and Standinger, the line of Jaures."
 "The  Individual
 "The individual is the central form, starting point, and end point
 for Heller's  ethics.  This placing of the individual in the center can
 already be found in her work on Chernyeshevski's ethical views.  She says
 that morals come into being when individual interests come into being
 within and conflict with the community interests.  Thus there was no morals
 in the primitive community and there will be no morals in Communism.  She
 writes:  'In Communism the norms of class society become habits, and as
 habits they cease to be the subjects of morals.'
 "Helier places the relationship of class and individual on its
 head.  She starts from the individual; the class exists only as  a col-
 lection of individuals.  In her argument against the vulgar Marxists she
 comes to the conclusion that the individual is essentially independent of
 class definition; she does not say this openly but this is the only
 logical link.
 "In reality, the class factor is the fundamental defining factor;
 individuals create classes only as class-individuals.  We must also point
 out that Heller is wrong in saying that only an individual can be moral or
 Immoral.  For example, when we say that in the age of imperialism, new,
 negative aspects characterize bourgeois morality, we do not mean, that every
 individual member of the bourgecd   approves of these new norms,but the
 class as such does approve of them.
 "In any case, differences between the community and the individual
 do exist even in the simplest case. And initially the judgment did not
 take subjective intentions into considerations but only the consequences.
 This again opposes Heller's individualistic conception.
 "Heller's individualistic ethics stems from Kant, like her other
 views.      Like the Austro-Marxists she unsuccessfully attempts to combine
 Kaatien and Marxist ethics.  Heller's view: show an outstanding kinship to

 the revisionist weaknesses of Jaures; he also placed the individual in the
 center and forced class viewpoints into the background.  Jaures wrote:
 'The rule of one class is an outrage against humanity.'  Ortega y Gasset
 is a modern representative of such individualism -- although this is not
 to say that Heller got her Kantian ideas from Jaures or Ortega y Gasset
 directly?  Heller's immediate source is Gyorgy Lukacs.
 "Freedom as a Concept
 "Let us examine where this exaggeration of the individual leads
 in the problem of freedom.  Heller seems to attack two extremes:  the
 vulgar materialist emphasis on class and state freedom; and the subject-
 ivist emphasis  on individual freedom.  But actually she denies the
 categories of class and state freedom. Heller writes 'Freedom is always
 the freedom of an individual....  The freedom of a class means that the
 freedom of Individuals belonging to that class has been realized.  If
 we say that one state is freer than another, than we mean that that state
 guarantees more freedom to individuals than the other state does.' But
 it is the Marxist view that only the liberation of the class opens the
 door to the liberation of its members.  If we accept Heller' s views, then
 it appears that the bourgeois slander is correct according to whichthe
 socialist state is not the dictatorship of the proletariat but the dictator-
 ship of a few persons who oppress the proletariat itself.  Heller'.s
 equation of the freedom of the state to the freedom of individuals  is
 contradictory because a state has a freedom which it opposes  to individuals.
 "Heller also errs in making subjectivist criteria of freedom
 primaryb  In reality the decisive criterion of freedom is rule over natural
 or social factors in recognition of necessity.  Frequently, men are free
 without being subjectively aware of it.  For example, some peasants enter
 cooperatives against their will.  According to Heller they are not free,
 but the peasant who sticks to his old individual farming is free.  In
 reality, the cooperative peasant is much freer even though he receives his
 'orders' from the cooperative leaders instead of from 'nature.'  Heller's
 concept reduces freedom to bare spontaneity.
 "This emphasis on the concept of self-realization is an existent-
 ialist idea, a Sartrian idea.  One of the chief representatives of the
 Mensheviks, Axelrod, also made freedom of the personality central.  in
 comparing the value of capitalist and socialist societies the problem of
 freedom should be considered not primarily in relation to the individual,
 but rather in relation to the classes.
 "The Problem of Norms
 "Heller says that we think of two things when we hear the word
 'norm':   first, that which is generally done, and second, that which should
 be done but which generally is not done.  These are the concrete and the

 abstract norms, respectively.  it is our poisition that the abstract norms
 are nonexistent and of an idealist construction and that a development of
 the conception of Marxist norms must begin from the dialectics of the
 general and the particular (i.e., the socially determined and the class
 determined).
 "According to Heller, the price of the 'supraclass' nature of
 abstract norms is that they cannot be realized.  Thus they cannot be linked
 to the worker class movement.  According to her, the worker classjdoes not
 represent the universal interests of mankind.
 "According to Heller, the most abstract demand is the demand of
 the highest order but in reality the highest demands are the most concrete
 (e.g., the demands of proletarian humanism).  Heller's conception is a
 peculiar manifestation in ethics of epistemological idealism.  In contrast
 to Heller's incorrect analysis into abstract and concrete norms, we
 propose the following categories:  elementary norms (for social existence)
 an(. elementary moral  inheritance (of a class).
 "What political idea is being expressed in this .'theory of Heller's?
 Obviously it is that Lukacs type of ideological coexistence.
 "Heller's ethics reflects the structure of capitalist society and
 the false consciousness of the individual living therein -- just as in the
 case of Proudhon,as Marx pointed out.
 "Heller points to the 'positive' side of hypocrisy.  On this point
 Heller joins Kolakowski, but Heller goes even further -- Kolakowski spoke(-
 of the positive role of hypocrisy, but Heller speaks of it!?as a 'positive
 phenomenon.'  (It should be noted that hypocrisy is a peculiarityof  the
 morality of bourgeois society.  When Commua_sts mislead their enemies, this
 is not a case of hypocrisy.)
 "Heller also evidences a tendency to make. peace with religious
 morality -- here the principle of ideologies'. coexistence comes to the
 surface.  According to Heller) as long as a class society or a state exists,
 there will be religious views.  This is a justification of spontaneity.
 What sense is there in atheist propaganda if what she says is true?  Heller's
 conception of morality is very similar to that developed by Cyorgy Ronay
 in U  Ember La contemporary Hungarian weekly put out by Actio Catholics in
 Budapest .
 "Kautsky, Adler, and revisionists, reformists, and renegades in
 general have always made allowances for religion.
 "Why did Heller came to an approv.a_ of the antihumanist content
 of religious morality despite her protestations of atheism and humanism?
 Because her atheism and humanism are bourgeois atheism and humanism.

 "Marxists must go beyond the position of bourgeois materialists
 and must evaluate religious alienation as originating from and subordinate
 to wordly. alienation.
 "Morality
 "In analyzing Heller's conception of morality we see that she
 remains at the position of subjectivism represented by Kant.  The starting
 point for the distorted understanding of morality lies in her incorrect
 solution of the freedom-necessity problem.  Heller writes:  'A demand
 becomes moral if it confronts a person not only as an external demand, but
 also has become an internal demand....'
 "Thus, according to Heller, external demands are nonmoral and
 cannot be binding on the moral. individual. In reality, everything depends
 on what content is being expressed in the internal or external demand..
 Heller abolishes the entire dialectics of the objective and subjective
 side of morality.  She completely loses sight of the historical fact that
 when the worker class organizes itself as a conscious class and builds
 socialism, the subjective and objective side  of morality undergo an
 essential change.  The objective moral demands developed by the worker class
 stand higher than the subjective moral feelings of the average individual..
 Heller's conception opens the gate to spontaneity.  But Lenin pointed to
 the positive moral influence of the proletarian state power.
 "Good and Evil
 "What,,according to Heller, is moral evil:   'That which does not
 satisfy the  moral needs of man, or which impedes the satisfaction of
 these needs....' Heller does not take up the,question of what role the
 moral evil has in the development of class societies.  Heller ethicalizes
 history and puts ethics above history.
 "Lukacs was able to reject. aesthetic decadence in his knowledge
 of the bourgeois classics.  Heller cannot do even this, but there is a
 theoretical weakness common to both Lukacs and Heller, neither is able to
 measure capitalist aesthetics or ethics by the yardstick of the labor
 movement.
 "According to Heller, virtue is 'the conscious and voluntary
 assumption of the morality of a given community, an outer and inner
 harmony....' Apparently Heller's position is Marxist but it has an anti-
 sectarian purpose which ends in denying the morality of the movement.
 Keller hypothesizes that socialism can be established without its having
 a public character; she thus raises to general laws of socialism the
 sectarian errors committed in certain periods.

 "Heller's earlier positions when she showed the different class
 bases of the Goethe-Schiller 'beautifiIl souls' and the Chernyeshevsky
 ideal, a man developed from many sides, was clearer and truly Marxist.
 "Value
 "In Heller's analysis, reality becomes ever more split:  on the
 one side are values (the embodiment of historical good), and on the other
 side are the necessary processes of reality, the historical evil.  Philo-
 sophically this conception is based on the ;Cantianism which she could not
 overcome.  According to Heller) values are the historical good, 'the
 abstract good which is embodied not in individual men, but which is brought
 into being by world history in the totality of mankind.'  Ultimately) this
 means that morality creates the good sphere and history creates the bad
 sphere.  This is similar to Kolakowaki's Position.
 "Heller's acceptance of bourgeois value-ontologism abolishes. the
 differences between the categories of being and consciousness, making it
 impossible to understand the categories of -values as categories of ideb
 logical objectivity.  Thus the definitions Of variofs values lose their
 concrete determinants, primarily their historical, economic, and class
 determinants.  If we pose the question of the moral good on a concrete
 historical basis, then the answer will be relative and in accordance with
 class interests.
 "Heller denies that historical necessity which is the indispensable
 base for Communism, for the general social realization of the moral good.
 "Heller defines humanism as respect for self and other as auto-
 nomous moral beings.  A class-conscious worker will immediately understand
 the anachronism of this definition, but a petit-bourgeois will find this
 definition adequate.
 "Heller admits that the hierarchy of moral values changes according
 to epoch and class, but she joins the value-ontologists by asserting that
 the character of a value is not class-determined.  Thus we can agree with
 Icautsky, who said, before be became a renegade, that the 'back to Kant'
 slogan ultimately meant 'back to Plato.'  Platonic ideas also hide in  the
 conceptions of Jaures.  Heller is not the only one to put forward these
 anti-Marxist ideas today.  The Polish revisionist Kolekowski preceded her
 with the express intention of making the criteria of moral behavior inde-
 pendent of all philosophies of history.
 "The Kantian humanist conception (i.e., never to use oneself or
 another as a means but only as a goal) stands in sharp opposition to the
 Marxist humanist conception the essence of which is that the liberation of
 the exploited majority, can come only by means, of violating the 'moral
 autonomy' of the minority.

 "For the Marxist, just moral judgment is subordinate to the goal,
 the abolition of classes.  According to Heller, this abolishes morality --
 itself.                           Heller rehabilitates the basic principle of bourgeois law:  equal
 moral judgement of moral individuals who are regarded as equal -- but they
 are not equal.
 "Goals and Means
 "According to Heller, if the means are without value from the
 viewpoint of 'moral development,' then the goal also loses its moral con-
 tent.  Heller considers this to be an ethical law which is applicable even
 to the labor movement.
 "In this periods he who rejects the means of the labor movement
 rejects its goals also.  The conceptions of the reformists and revisionists
 offer a happy opportunity to the demagoguery of the bourgeois theoreticians;
 they can theoretically hold the moral goals of socialism while rejecting
 'only' its methods.  For example, Dewey and A. Huxley reject socialism on:
 this basis.
 "Heller overlooks the simple fact that the goal determines the
 means.  The revisionists overlook the fact that the goal becomes a means
 and that the means appear as goals.  The goal transforms the means.  In
 its relations with the class enemy the Com?nunist movement has no regard
 for the abstract moral content of means.
 "However, the Marxist viewpoint does not classify all means  as
 abstractly justified, but only those which stand in an internal, causal
 interdependence with the goal.  The adequate nature of the means is prima-
 rily a political  question.
 "The 'ethicalization' of the class struggle is an old wishful
 dream of the bourI.sie and the revisionists.
 "Heller sees a moral sin in all political activity.  Here rene-
 gadism: replaces the well-known petit-bourgeois heresy which confuses demo-
 cratism with socialism.  Here Heller's ethics fails ultimately and appears,
 at best, as a refurbished Tolstoyan ethics.
 "Heller writes: 'Political activity, in its narrower sense, is
 nothing more than a struggle for power....'  According to Heller, even
 proletarian politics contains immorality.  She does not say that it  is
 morally forbidden to participate in social activity, only that this
 activity is accompanied ethically by sin.   In some cases you must undertake
 to sin.   This conception does not differ at all from that of Raymond Aron.

 "Marxism does not deny that moral contradictions come up in the
 course of progressive social activity.  But Marxism views these contra-
 dittions from the side of the political goal.
 "Su Summing   up
 "Lenin stressed that there was no trace of ethics, in the
 revisionists' meaning of the term, in Marxism.  He wrote that Marxism 'in
 the theoretical area subordinates the "ethical viewpoint" to,., the "principle
 of causality" and in the practical sphere refers it to the class struggle.'
 Revisionism does not want to hear of this definition, and it is not by
 chance that Heller never mentions it in her work on ethics.  Heller's
 ethics carries the theoretical expressions of alien class interests into
 Marxism and it subordinates politics to morality.
 "The common theoretical root of these revisionist views is a
 failure to recognize the priority of the interests of the worker class.
 Imre Nagy necessarily opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat on the
 basis of the proposition that the worker class could not subordinate  the
 universal interests of the nation to its own class interests.
 "Heller proposes class peace instead of class struggle.  And she
 abolishes the principle of party spirit.  It is an old tactic of revisionism
 to oppose party spirit with the scientific spirit and to oppose 'the
 'prophet-revolutionary' Marx to the 'scientist' Marx.  In raising such
 problems, Heller develops further the conceptions of Lukacs.  But Lenin
 pointed out that during the building of socialism the chief danger is the
 petit-bourgeois belief in spontaneity, a belief which hides in the above
 ideas.
 "By developing her ideas on the i=orality of politics In 1956-1957,
 Heller, was attempting to paralyze the revolutionary forces and to justify
 the hostile passivity of the intellectuals."
 Existentialism Becoming Significant Revisionist Force Among Intellectuals
 The "fashion of existentialism" as an expression of revisionistic
 thought in Polish intellectual circles, especially among Marxists, appears
 to be consolidating its foothold and continues to give cause for serious
 concern.  The first one to express such misgivings was Adam Schaff; writing
 in the 20 September 1959 Nowa Kultura, he frankly blamed the failure of
 Marxist theory for fostering existentialism.  In it he complained that back
 in 1951, existentialism was not even considered as a threat to the eminent
 position enjoyed by Marxist thought; however, "only a few years later, in

 1956-1957, it became a real force, above all in the Marxist fevisionist7
 milieu, in which the most varied, supposedly original and innovating
 ideas were, in reality, variations on the subject of existentialism if
 not an outright plagiarism of its ideas."
 There were various reasons, according to Schaff, for?permitting
 existentialist thought to make such tremendous inroads within the ranks
 of Polish intellectuals, including Marxists:  primarily, the failure of
 Marxist thought to take into consideration the fullness of the psycho-
 logical life of man, the subject of the life of man, the proper behavior
 of man with relation to himself and to others, the responsibility of the
 individual for his actions, etc.  In the words of Schaff, Marxism avoided
 these problems "because the union between Marxism and the revolutionary
 workers movement emphasized the problem of the justness of social develop-
 ment...and problems related to the struggle of the masses.  These
 practical, political interests of Marxism put.off until the future matters
 connected with the individual and his problems....  In this manner there
 arose, historically, a.vacuum in the philosophical problems of Marxism."
 Schaff admits that it is a "considerable vacuum" which has created..a
 situation in which "revisionistic tendencies" in Poland "borrowed ideas
 from existentialism and are actually navigating under its standard."
 Schaff makes it clear that he has no intention of justifying the
 revisionists.' flirting with. existentialism, but that his aim is  to
 answer "why existentialism became the fashionable philosophy of revisionists
 .in Poland," and "what makes it so attractive."
 A more recent series of articles, by Zdzislao Najder in the 1  and
 28 August 1960 Nova Kultura, complains of the widespread obsession with
 existentialism among Polish intellectuals.  Nader is apparently
 concerned not only because this phenomenon is prevalent among the older
 intellectuals, but "because it has a decidedly wider range and is more
 significant since it primarily includes the youth."
 As for the reasons for the popularity of existentialism, Najder
 explains that "social upheavals and the catastrophies of war" are not
 enough.  The principal reason for the change which took place among
 young philosophers was "the theory of the individual',s responsibility for
 everything, for what he 'is' and what he does, responsibility which, in
 the opinion of Sartre, is undertaken in an inevitable manner in the name
 not only of oneself, but of all mankind as well.  The flight from respon-
 sibility, both in the moral sense and in the ordinary sense of undertaking
 daily work decisions, became a social-political sickness of alarming
 proportions and had to evoke a violent reaction.  No other element of
 existentialist philosophy has exerted such an influence, and none was as
 'Justified' in its influence."

 In a follow-up article dwelling on existentialism as a philosophy
 and a social phenomenon, Najder insists that the second aspect is the
 more important of the two.  During the occupation, he says, two slogans
 become crystallized in the mass consciousness:  "the individual is noth-
 ing"                   ~+nd.'- "everything is relative."  But, he maintains, the individual
 in Poland has not the slighest desire to be nothing, at least internally,
 so this is the reason for the popularity of the new slogan,,"silent
 republics"  Thus, the slogan, "everything is relative," is the device of
 those people who do not want to become "engaged" at any price.  That is
 why, Najder insists,  existentialism is so dangerous in Poland: not as
 a philosophy for the "professionals" but as an ideological expression of
 a certain social attitude.
 Concern over the adverse influence that Sartre existentialism may
 have on intellectual circles in Poland was voiced in a review of Sartre's
 latest book, Critique de la raison dialectique (Critique of Dialectical
 Reason), by Adam Schaff in the l  September 1960 Pr2eglad Kulturalny.
 Schaff makes a distinction between Sartre the philosopher and Sartre the
 playwright, intimating that. he does not think much of the former.
 Schaff maintains that in his new book, Sartre is in effect reasoning
 that existentialism will eventually gain the upper hand over Marxism.
 Schaff writes:  "Sartre closes his introductory remarks with the far-
 reaching prognosis about the dissolution of existentialism in. Marxism...;
 however, it appears that existentialism is to disappear, but not in the
 sense that it will be vanquished by Marxism, which will solve its
 problems in its own way, but rather that it will be accepted by Marxism
 as the basis for all studies.  Hence, it is not a question of a 'disappear--
 ance,' but of a clear advance of existentialism to the role of d'i
 foundation of all studies of Marxism,-a question of 'supplementing
 Marxism with existentialism."'
 In conclusion, Schaff says, "Here we have this contradiction:  his-
 torical materialism tells us to explain all the actions and motivations
 of an individual by special conditioning; existentialism, on the contrary,
 tells us to seek the final source of social phenomena in the autonomically
 understood freedom of the individual.  Here we have two diametrically
 opposed trends which cannot be joined. into one philosophical system.
 Sartre was also unable to do that, although he might have imagined that
 he fills existentialism with Marxism, while actually he tries to  turn
 Marxism into a variation-of existentialism."

 Manifestations of Economic, Ideological, and Cultural Revisionism in'Press
 The Rumanian party press in recent months has included condemnations
 of revisionist and dissident tendencies in economics, in matters concerning
 the ideological education of youth, and in literature and art.
 In an article in Probleme Economice of August 1960, M. Paraluta dis-
 cusses the development erid strengthening of socialist ownership.'  The
 author condemns contemporary revisionism which, "by falsifying the Marxist-
 Leninist teaching about the need to eliminate capitalist ownership,
 attempts to rehabilitate the old reformist concept about the peaceful
 integration of capitalism, an idea repudiated by Lenin, claiming that the
 capitalist forms of ownership would pass through a process of qualitative:
 transformation, of accumulation of 'socialist phenomena."'
 Paraluta continues:  "The absurdity of these attempts is obvious....
 In general, the revisionists try to identify capitalist nationalization
 with socialization of the means of production after the proletariat has
 seized political power.  But, in reality, bourgedis nationalizations do
 not change the nature of capitalist ownership at all,'while the passing
 of the means of production to the ownership of all the people after the
 proletariat seizes political power. leads to the destruction of capitalist
 ownership. andits replacement by ownership of an entirely different
 nature, an ownership which excludes the exploitation of man by man.
 "There is no common element between capitalist and socialist owner-
 ship since they are not the same types of ownerships.  Socialist ownership
 can be created only after the destruction of the capitalist system, after
 the seizing-of political power by the proletariat.  Its creation within
 the capitalist system contradicts the fundamental interests of  the
 capitalist class,. which holds all the economic and political power in the
 capitalist state.  To speak about the accumulation of `socialist phenomena'
 in capitalist ownership is equivalent to attempting to reconcile unr'econ-
 cilable antagonisms, to attempting to deny the fundamental opposition
 between capitalist and socialist ownership.
 "The wholly unscientific character of the theories concerning the
 pretended peaceful integration of capitalism into socialism -- of cap-
 italist ownership into socialist ownership -- has been clearly demonstrated
 by realities in socialist countries.  The experiences of these countries
 have proven that socialist ownership can be established only after  the
 revolutionary seizure of state power by the working class."

 Becoming more specific, Paraluta attacks the "Yugoslav revisionists,
 who, distorting Marxist-Leninist teaching about the general laws of,
 socialist construction, assert that the means of productionlshould  be
 socialized only when they are at the disposal of the so-called collectives
 of producers, thus denying the need for establishing socialist state
 ownership of the means of production,  It is well known that the classics
 of Marxism-Leninism understood the socialization of the principal means
 of production.to mean the creation of ownership relationships which would
 guarantee all members of society the game situation in respect to these
 means, not allowing the utilization of these means by one part of society
 for the exploitation of the other parts...."
 The Yugoslav revisionists are also criticized in another Rumanian
 publication.  Scrisul Banatean, thd monthly organ of the Timisoara branch
 of the Rumanian Writers Union, includes in its July 1960 issue an article
 by Ion Ariesanu discussing party First Secretary Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's
 report to the June 1960 Third Party Congress.  Ariesanu echoes Gheorghiu-
 Dej's condemnation of the Yugoslav revisionists for attacking'the party
 in its role as leader and the socialist state as the instrument of building
 socialism.
 According to Ariesanu, "In the matter of the state, the revisionists,
 denying the economic role of the socialist state, raise spontaneity to a
 supreme principle.  The results of these 'theories,' applied to the very
 operation of the Yugoslav economy, are seen very clearly today in the
 anarchy of their agriculture, where the process of collectivization has
 stagnated, private wealth has increased and inflated, and small property-
 holders have been ruined."
 Two Rumanian cultural publications express concern over the ideo-
 logical training of the youth.  Luceatarul of 15 August 1960 warns that
 the enemy (bourgeois ideology) "camouflages itself, adapts itself, and
 tries to infiltrate, especially. where lack of experience in life or
 weakening of revolutionary vigilance lead it to. believe it can remain
 unobserved for a while."  The author of the article exhorts all Union of
 Working Youth members to combat "manifestations of individualism., disdain
 for the interests of the collective, nationalistic prejudices, symptoms
 of moral decay, and pathological curiosity about decadent Western society."
 In Contemporanul of 9 September 1960, two university courses for
 future teachers -- courses in pedago4r and pedagogical psychology -- are
 criticized for their poor treatment of the historic and class character of
 education, as well as for their insufficient combativeness and lack of
 emphasis on Communist morality.
 According to articles appearing in the press, writers and artists
 are not all adhering to the party line and do not all have the proper
 conception of the party spirit.  Criticizing a recent plastic arts exhibit

 in Bucharest, Scinteia of 27 August 1960 comments that "what the artists
 call'originality,' the fruit of personal experience, sometimes represents
 a superficial treatment, a unilateral understanding and a sterile plagi-
 arism of the style of the masters."
 Literary critic Savin Bratu's contribution to the recently published
 volume, Probleme actuale ale literaturii realist-socialiste (Current,
 Problems of Socialist-Realist Literature ,is attacked by  ribuna of
 18 and 25 August 1960 for its "countless confusions."  Also, asserts
 Tribuna, "The article by Savin Bratu...contains errors of a more serious
 nature -Ohich affect its political and ideological contents.  Literary
 critics maintain, and concrete literary practice strengthens  the
 assertion, that the writer of today is attracted by the new element of
 society since the new strikes the imagination of the creator in a special
 way.  Savin Bratx maintains the contrary.  The old is more. evident than
 the new, since the morbid and abnormal have a greater power of attraction
 j5ccording to Brat."
 The Tribuna critic explains that "the error arises from Savin Bratu's
 bizarre and idyllic idea about the great revolutionary transformations
 taking place in our country....  Savin Bratu has a fatalistic, mechanistic
 idea about the development of society, an idea which is more reminiscent
 of Aeschylus than of the classics of Marxism-Leninism....
 "The way in which Bratu conceives of the party spirit is a meta-
 physical error.  According to the critic, the party spirit is an entity
 independent of the will of men, something which floats above them."
 Discussing the writer's responsibility to base his work on actuality,
 the July 1960 issue of Viata Romineasca states:  "ire combat the 'theory
 of distance' not to forbid this or that theme, but because this theory
 disorients the writers and prevents them from understanding that  the
 principal duty of socialist-realist literature is the reflection  of
 actuality."
 The editor in chief of Belgrade Borba, in its i4 September 1960
 issue, reviewing Edvard Kardelj's Socijalizam i Rat (Socialism and War ),
 stresses the importance of maintaining peace and practicing coexistence.
 Stating that "a country's international behavior is governed by its
 concrete attitude toward the question of peace,." Joze Smole asserts that
 "conscious socialist forces naturally are aware of their obligation to
 suppress the emergence of every sign of a lack of belief in the possibility'
 of averting ,war" and adds that "disbelief as regards peace essentially

 Suggesting that the difficulties ;economic and political at an
 international level) which are facing China "have apparently given rise
 to certain instances of demoralization " Smole submits that "disbelief
 has been noted  in China7.in the development of socialism, the strength
 of the working class, and social progress in general."  He asserts that
 "by its unrestrained anti-Yugoslav cs paign, which is not solely a
 campaign against Yugoslavia, China has openly expressed its intention and
 exposed its attempt to force its disbelief as to. the possibility of
 averting war upon other socialist countries and the international workers
 movement."
 Joze Smole then says that conscious socialist forces "cannot remain
 indifferent to attacks against coexistence," in which these forces "see
 the most efficient policy of strengthening socialism and social. progress."
 He points out that Kardelj's book "provides evidence of the correctness of
 the policy of coexistence for which socialist Yugoslavia has' always been.
 calling consistently for no purely pacifist reasons; but from the point of
 view of social progress, the workers movement, and socialism,."  It also
 ".constitutes another example of the. ideological and'theorotical strength
 of the Association of Communists of Yugoslavia in the defense and creative
 implementation of Marxism and Leninism."  Smole concludes that Kardelj's
 study, "as an indubitable contribution to the development of socialist
 thought in general, is of great significance to the international workers
 movement."
 Another article by Joze Smole appeared in the 12 September 1960 issue
 of Borba in rebuttal to a Soviet criticism of Kardelj's book in the 2
 2 September 1960 issue of Moscow's Pravda.  Smole notes that the authors
 were clearly in a great hurry to launch a politicallattack on Yugoslavia,
 since they "did not even have enough time to read Kardelj,'s discourse':to
 the end."  He submits that their main intent has been to "forbid Yugoslav
 Communists to discuss a current problem of socialist international policy,
 retaining for others the monopolist right to interpret this problem.."
 A reading of Kardelj's book, he says, makes it clear that "Yugoslav
 Communists do not care to enter into abstract ideological polemics with
 others and least of all to become involved in Soviet-Chinese ideological
 differences."  The author discusses the three "theses" of the Pravda
 discussion and points out that'these "theses" have po connection whatever
 with Kardelj's study.  In fact, he charges the authors with failing to
 act in a "middle role between dogmatism and "revisionism.'  When they
 criticize the dogmatists, they use arguments which are the essence of
 KardelJ's study.  When they attack Yugoslav 'revisionism,' they themselves
 fall into-the very dogmatism which the;yr otherwise criticize."  However,
 says Smote, "there can be no middle road in essential socialist problems,
 such as coexistence.  One can only be for or against coexistence..... It
 is obvious that the Moscow Pravda cannot boast that its "criticism' has
 contributed to strengthening the forces of peace and to the unity of the
 socialist forces in their struggle for peace."

 Inhibitedd Soviet Sociology
 Soviet social education is criticized by Dr V. Milanovic in the
 No 7-8, July-August 1960, issue of the Yugoslav monthly Nasa Stvarnost
 for failing to interest Soviet researchers in the contemporary social
 processes.
 The author notes that "the central position in sociopolitical education
 ought to be held by dialectic and historical materialism," but that this
 is not true of the Soviet educational system, where thebasic subject of
 sociopolitical education is the history of the CPSU.  In his view, Soviet
 historiography has, to be sure, attempted to view the past critically,
 but it is primarily a "unique synthesis of national history and  world
 historical events" which contains "many elements of romanticism and sub-
 jectivism."  He admits that the description and analysis of the past
 40 years' development "represents in the teaching process a factor whose
 impressiveness the average student cannot resist and which he cannot
 accept critically."  Thus, he says, Soviet "social education does  not
 adequately develop a free, independent,, critical, and investigative
 attitude in the students toward social phenomena and processes."  He
 submits that an orientation of instruction in which historical science
 holds the central position cannot by its very nature develop a deeper
 interest in the problems of contemporary society.
 Dr. Milanovic finds some of the Soviet conceptions about the relation-
 ship of material, objective conditions and subjective factors to scientific
 development "very interesting."  He notes that Soviet authors frequently
 stress the material side of the question of the role and tasks of social
 science and its application in sociopolitical activity and that they
 continually point to the progress achieved in!.th,e material base of the
 cultural development in the USSR.  The author admits that the educational
 process in the USSR had produced an increasing number of educated  and
 scientific personnel, but when he questions their achievements in Soviet
 sociology, he suggests that "quantity" does not necessarily produce
 "quality."
 As to the sociological works mentioned by one Soviet sociologist,
 Milanovic says that "these are great works of a historiographic, character,
 but the Soviet author does not mention a single., more important work of
 research in social relations and contemporary social movements in the
 Soviet Union."  Milanovic concludes that the reason for  '.the absence of
 concrete sociological research in the Soviet Union, the orientation toward
 historical themes, and the lack of connection between sociological research
 and the current social processes-should be sought in the political
 relations, in the current disregard for concrete sociological researches,
 and in the doctrinaire 'explanation' and guidance of social processes."

 "Commuie" Is Not Communism
 Red China's communes are undoubtedly the target of certain disparaging
 remarks appearing in a discussion of the Yugoslav communal system, in the
 17 September 1960 issue of Zagreb V.esnik, by Dr Jovan Djordjevic.  The
 author remarks that discussions in the Yugoslav press at the time of the
 introduction of the Yugoslav communal system "did not have a', primarily
 academic character, nor were they preparations for a sudden 'leap' in the
 introduction of a mechanical, doctrinaire, compulsory, or militarily
 administrative"collectivism which, according to the expression 'commune,'
 ought to resemble Communism."  Describing the social, economic, and
 political functions of the Yugoslav commune, the author stresses that
 "it is no% longer a territorial grouping of.'inhabitants, or a "natural
 environment' or a 'dormitory for citizens,' but a truly living society of
 consumption, production, and interpersonal' relationships."

 Communist Party Supports Moscow Line on Peace and War
 The support of the Finnish Communist Party (FCP) of the Moscow line
 for peaceful development toward socialism was expressed by Ville  Pessi,
 Secretary-General of the FCP, in his speech of 20 August 1960 at_ the
 Central Committee meeting, which was reported by Kansan Uutiset, the
 Helsinki Communist daily, of 21 August 1960.  In the speech, which was
 devoted to-the international situation, Pessi quoted a passage from the
 Moscow "peace manifesto" of 1957 and claimed that the communique signed
 at the Bucharest Conference was in complete accord with it.  To sub-
 stantiate his statement that the program of the FCP was in complete
 accord with both statements, Pessi quoted the following excerpt from the
 program   "The  FCP attempts to promote the kind of democratic develop-
 ment that will ensure victory in our country to the working population,
 which represents the majority of the people; that will transfer political
 power to the working class and the workers who are in alliance with it;
 and that will form a majority grouping even in the Diet to put through
 reforms leading to a socialistic system.  The Communist Party desires the
 victory of socialism through peaceful means.  However, the violence of
 the antirevolutionary forces could necessitate repelling it with the
 workers` forces...."
 The statement issued by the Central Committee of the FCP at the
 close of its meeting reiterated the support of the Moscow "peace" line.
 This statement, which was published by Kansan Uutiset on 23 August 1960,
 referred to the "unanimous approval" of the Bucharest communique and
 claimed that the policies practiced by the FCP, as well as the decisions
 of its :12th congress in April 1960, support the decisions reached  at
 Bucharest.  To corroborate the FCP's upholding of peaceful coexistence,
 the statement noted that the 12th congress established that the policies
 of peaceful coexistenc? had, proved beneficial to the Finnish people in
 that they resulted in a stabilization of democratic conditions in Finland,
 led to favorable trade relations between Finland and the USSR, developed
 new work possibilities for the Finnish people, decreased reactionary
 prejudice and promoted an objective relationship toward the USSR, and
 make the USSR's achievements and policies known in Finland.

 Socialist Deputy Raps Misuse of Thrmi "Revisionism"
 Misuse of the term "revisionism" by the Communist Party was charged
 by Antonio Giolitti, deputy of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), in the
 11 September 1960 issue of the PSI newspaper Avanti:,  of Rome.  Giolitti
 was responding to a query by Ulderico Pazzagli, of Pisa, who in a letter
 to the newspaper asked what was behind the "revisionism, dogmatism,
 extremism, sectarianism;" and such apparent "windmill," undefined' targets'
 of the Communist Party's sallies.
 Giolitti said that, far from being "windmills," these were real
 ideological and political positions held by certain men and groups, but
 that they and their proponents were very hatd'_to describe and identify
 because "the Communist Party leaders always conceal and dietobt ",the
 thinking of the opponents whom they are combating within the party and
 at times outside of it also, especially when dealing with burning
 questions of ideology and labor history."
 .  Furthermore, he continued, experience, especially since 1956, shows
 that the Communists "systematically reject open and loyal discussion and
 systematically resort to falsification and slander."  As examples he
 mentioned the latter treatment accorded in Rinascita, theoretical journal
 of the Italian Communist Patty (PCI), to his own vo ume, Il communismo in
 Europa (Communism in Europe), as well as to the book by Sergio D 'Angelo
 and Leo Paladini, La sfida di Krusciov (The Challegge of Khrushchev).
 (For reviews of these books pu  ishe. in Rinascita,'see Summary No 2776,
 Review of Communist Theoretical Journals         Note he observed, that
 the PCI lacked arguments for a serious critique; it was only that its
 leadership had decided that one must not engage in discussion about the
 Third Interaationa and the Soviet Union, brlit   must' repeat only the
 content of "official versions carrying the imprimatur."
 Giolitti concluded by giving the Bernsteinian definition of revisionism..
 (or reformism) and decrying the "derogatory and slanderous" slant given
 now to a word used in connection with a "serious and honorable body of
 opinion which finds its place, with full rights of expression, within the
 labor movement and the struggle for sociali."
