 The agreements on procedures reached in Paris on 15 January between
 the US and North Vietnam will enable both Hanoi and Saigon to claim that
 their basic demands have been satisfied. The Communists apparently con-
 cluded that it was necessary to get the substantive talks under way before
 the new US administration takes office. Hanoi's move to break the impasse
 at the 11th hour of President Johnson's administration suggests that it
 probably intended all along not to let 20 January pass without some
 resolution of the procedural issues, but that it held back in hopes of
 obtaining a complete allied acceptance of its demands.
 Having established the ostensible equality of the Liberation Front at
 the negotiations, the Communists are doing their best to shore up their
 political and military potential in the South. They are showing more aggres-
 siveness in the southern half of South Vietnam as they continue to reinforce
 and resupply. The next week could prove to be a critical time; 20 January
 has quite often been mentioned in captured documents and prisoner inter-
 rogations as a target date for the completion of combat preparations.
 Although allied bombing and spoiling operations have continually disrupted
 Communist attempts to prepare for future battles, the enemy's local force
 and guerrilla units in coordination with some of its main force units could
 stage some limited attacks at any time.
 In Laos, the Communists are keeping up pressure on government forces
 on several fronts. They appear to be trying to reduce sharply the government
 presence around the Bolovens Plateau in the south, while the successful
 attack on a government ammunition depot near Vientiane appears intended
 in part to point out the vulnerability of government facilities near the
 capital.
 The failure of the top Chinese Communist leaders to show up together
 in public since the party plenum last October has given rise to rumors in
 Peking of ferment in the leadership. Top Chinese leaders have been out of
 public view for lengthy periods before, but this practice leads to tensions and
 confusion.
 An apparent effort by the Japanese Government to condition public
 opinion to the need for concessions regarding American bases on Okinawa as
 the price for an early return of the Ryukyus has drawn a strong critical
 reaction. Nationalistic pressures will make it increasingly difficult for Prime
 Minister Sato to favor any formula for reversion that grants US base rights
 extending beyond those that apply in Japan proper.

 VIETNAM
 The agreements on procedures
 reached in Paris on 15 January be-
 tween the US and North Vietnam
 will enable both Hanoi and Saigon
 to claim that their basic demands
 have been satisfied.   The Commu-
 nists apparently concluded it was
 necessary to get the substantive
 talks under way before the new US
 administration takes office.   They
 agreed to a symbolic division of
 the conference table by accepting
 the presence of two small tables
 at either end of an axis of, but
 not touching, a main round table.
 The North Vietnamese also agreed
 to allied proposals for a two-
 sided speaking order.
 Movement came after more
 than a month of Communist intran-
 sigence, during which an undivided
 round table remained their main
 objective.   Hanoi's move to break
 the impasse at the 11th hour of
 President Johnson's administra-
 tion suggests that it probably
 intended all along not to let 20
 January pass without some resolu-
 tion of the procedural issues,
 but that it held back in hopes of
 obtaining a complete allied ac-
 ceptance of its demands.
 Despite the last-minute con-
 cessions, Hanoi is striving to
 present the new US administration
 with a picture of steadily in-
 creasing communist strength.   Hav-
 ing established a position of
 ostensible equality for the
 Liberation Front at the negotia-
 tions, the Communists are also
 doing their best to shore up their
 political and military potential
 in South Vietnam.   The political
 pressure on Saigon is being stepped
 up by threats to replace the South
 Vietnamese Government at the na-
 tional level with a "peace cab-
 inet," and in the countryside
 with the "liberation committees."
 The South Vietnamese probably
 see the final table configuration
 as fairly well satisfying their
 long-standing requirement that the
 arrangement reflect the two-sided
 character of the negotiations.
 President Thieu presumably hopes
 this will help him sell the com-
 promise to the rest of the leader-
 ship and to the people at large
 without serious loss of face.
 Saigon seems likely to in-
 terpret the Communists' willingness
 to accept such a compromise as
 proof of its contention that con-
 cessions can be extracted from
 the Communists if they are brought
 under the pressure of time while
 the allies do not seem to be in
 a hurry to reach a settlement.
 This could strengthen Saigon's
 conviction that tough bargaining
 tactics offer the best chance of
 reaching an acceptable settlement
 with the Communists.

 Military Situation in
 South Vietnam
 The Communists are showing
 more aggressiveness in the south-
 ern half of South Vietnam as
 they continue to reinforce and
 resupply at a deliberate pace.
 In what may be the beginning
 of another phase of their "winter-

 spring  campaign, the enemy launched
 a flurry of generally light but
 well synchronized shellings through-
 out III and IV corps last weekend.
 These were followed by limited
 ground attacks, including a pen-
 etration of the allied airfield
 complex at Can Tho.   Other sig-
 nificant allied military targets
 in the delta and the western high-
 lands were hit by mortar and
 rocket attacks during the week.
 In midweek, an enemy ambush of
 an allied convoy in Tay Ninh Prov-
 ince backfired when allied reac-
 tion forces killed 122 of the at-
 tackers.
 Meanwhile, heavy rains to-
 gether with allied spoiling opera-
 tions have apparently seriously
 disrupted enemy battle prepara-
 tions in some coastal areas of
 the northern provinces.   Despite
 numerous reports of enemy intent
 to stage attacks there, most of
 the Communist main force combat
 units are currently scattered in
 the mountains to the west of
 principal target areas.   Some of
 the enemy's local force and sap-
 per units, however, could mount
 limited attacks in certain key
 sectors of I Corps in the near
 future.

 COMMUNISTS STEP UP MILITARY ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT LAOS
 The military situation is
 heating up again in the south,
 although there has been no major
 new fighting.
 After a three-week respite,
 the government base at Ban Tha-
 teng has again become the target
 of North Vietnamese forces posi-
 tioned along the eastern rim of
 the Bolovens Plateau.   The gar-
 rison was hit with a heavy mortar
 attack and light ground probes
 on 12 January in what appeared
 to be the start of a fresh cam-
 paign to force the government to
 surrender that strategically lo-
 cated position.   As many as three
 North Vietnamese battalions are
 dug in around the base,  and the
 weary 400-man defending force may
 not hold out even if the enemy
 does not launch an all-out ground
 assault.
 Evidence continues to mount,
 meanwhile, that the Thateng opera-
 tion is part of a wider Communist
 effort to reduce sharply the gov-
 ernment's presence around the
 Bolovens.   Villagers in the Se
 Done Valley report that the enemy
 has opened Route 23, which con-
 nects with the main supply cor-
 ridor from North Vietnam, and is
 moving both troops and supplies
 into the area.   In addition to
 increasing harassment against the
 provincial capital of Saravane,
 the enemy appears to be preparing
 for a push against government
 positions along the western edge
 of the valley.   Last year at this
 time, North Vietnamese and Pathet
 Lao troops moved into the Se Done
 area and began offsetting the
 gains of a two-year government
 development and proselyting pro-
 gram.
 In the north, enemy raiders
 destroyed a government ammunition
 depot some 12 miles northeast of
 the capital city of Vientiane on
 15 January.   In recent months,
 Pathet Lao propagandists have
 told villagers of plans to step
 up terrorist activities in Vien-
 tiane Province, including at-
 tacks against the airport and
 military garrisons in the capital.

 will feed apprehensions, similar
 to those expressed last year,

 Meanwhile,  the enemy is mov-

 reinforcements have overrun sev-
 eral outlying government bases,
 and it appears to be only a mat-

 situation at Na Khang, where the

 will add to Phnom Penh's already                     on reserves from last year's rec-

 A senior Australian diplomat
 in Phnom Penh has expressed con-
 cern that the recent drought,
 in combination with earlier cut-
 backs in planting, will lead to
 a serious reduction in rice pro-
 duction this year.   He estimates
 the current crop will yield one
 third less than last year's
 crop.   In addition, he believes
 there will be a serious shortage
 of fresh-water fish,  the country's
 secondary staple.   He claims
 that remedial steps taken by the
 government have been too little
 and too late.
 The Australian diplomat has
 probably overestimated the poten-
 tial loss by accepting what appear
 to be exaggerated figures about
 planting reduction, but has still
 spotted what will undoubtedly be
 a serious shortfall in the cur-
 rent rice crop.   Prince Sihanouk
 has also warned of a sharp reduc-
 tion in rice production.   Cambodia
 should, however, be able to miti-
 gate the domestic impact of the
 expected drop in production by
 Nevertheless, Sihanouk's gov-
 ernment appears to be in for an
 economic squeeze it can ill af-
 ford in the face of country-wide
 dissidence.   Dissatisfaction with
 Phnom Penh's economic policies,
 which has been a major factor
 in the rural dissidence, could
 grow to even more serious pro-
 portions in the coming months.
 The situation, however, may
 bring additional pressure on the
 government to accelerate programs
 to improve the lethargic economy.
 Sihanouk recently decided,  for
 instance, to seek more actively
 for badly needed foreign invest-
 ment and to participate in inter-
 national economic organizations.
 Sihanouk apparently has ac-
 cepted the advice of those in the
 government who have been urging
 a reversal of the  "go it alone"
 policy that he adopted five years
 ago, which has been responsible
 for some of the current economic
 dislocation.

 in the leadership are getting

 just before the 12th plenum, a

 raised objections to the treat-

 general course of the Cultural

 and to the fitness of Lin Piao

 Although the details of
 this story are implausible,  it

 in the present uncertain atmos-

 ,JAPANESE CRITICAL OF US BASE RIGHTS ON OKINAWA
 An apparent government ef-
 fort to condition Japanese pub-
 lic opinion to the need for con-
 cessions regarding American bases
 on Okinawa as the price for an
 early return of the Ryukyus has
 drawn a strong critical reaction.
 In a Tokyo press conference
 last week,  the Japanese ambassa-
 dor to the US candidly stated
 that the US cannot accept a re-
 version agreement that imposes
 the same restrictions on Okinawan
 bases that apply to US bases in
 Japan--prohibition on nuclear
 weapons and advance consultations
 prior to any major force deploy-
 ments.   Ambassador Shimoda urged
 a compromise that would place the
 Okinawan bases in a special sta-
 tus and thus preserve their value
 as part of the American deterrent
 in the Far East.
 This trial balloon evoked
 harsh criticism from all seg-
 ments of the political spectrum
 in Okinawa as well as from the
 press and all opposition parties
 in Japan.   The government will
 face strong challenges on this
 question in the Diet when it re-
 convenes late this month.
 The Sato government has
 probably concluded from the furor
 triggered by the statement that
 its ability to contain pressures
 for reversion is diminishing and,
 consequently,  its maneuverability
 on the question is being re-
 stricted.
 Developments over the past
 year, including the election of a
 leftist chief executive in Oki-
 nawa last November and the crash
 of a B-52 there shortly there-
 after, have made any acceptance
 of a prolonged US administration
 of the Ryukyus a growing politi-
 cal liability to the Japanese
 Government.   Moreover, national-
 istic pressures make it increas-
 ingly difficult for Prime Minister
 Sato to favor any formula for re-

 The Soviets loudly publicized their space achievements last week, but
 still had time to complain about the world around them. A harsh Pravda
 attack on Chinese political developments clearly was intended as a backdrop
 for the world Communist meeting in May and the preparatory meetings
 scheduled for February and March. Moscow's plans to hold a summit
 meeting this month of the bloc's economic organization, CEMA, seem to
 have gone awry. A "preliminary" meeting reportedly will take place soon,
 possibly as early as next week when CEMA marks its 20th anniversary. A
 summit meeting of Warsaw Pact representatives may still be held this month.
 Looking to the West, Moscow saw little that it liked in President Johnson's
 State of the Union address, but kept to its policy of withholding comment
 on the new US administration.
 Middle Eastern tensions were very much in the forefront of European
 thinking. The US response to the Soviet "peace plan" was delivered in
 midweek and presumably is under study in Moscow. Paris reiterated its
 desire to see a meeting of the "big four" held within the framework of the
 UN to discuss a Middle East settlement, but made no specific proposal to
 that effect.
 In Czechoslovakia, the controversy over press freedom is continuing.
 There is speculation that Dubcek will soon introduce new regulations muf-
 fling publications critical of the Russians and the Czechoslovak conserva-
 tives. The mass media have thus far successfully resisted regime efforts to
 station censors in their editorial offices.
 Polish party boss Gomulka apparently is moving to improve his power
 position, particularly in respect to his most important challenger, hard-line,
 nationalistic ex - interior minister Moczar.

 "BEST EUROPE UNLIKELY TO FOLLOW SWEDEN'S LEAD ON HANOI
 Sweden's recognition of North
 Vietnam is not likely to move
 other Western European govern-
 ments to follow its example.
 Stockholm announced the long-
 predicted move late last week,
 and Sweden's ambassador to Peking
 is expected to be accredited to
 Hanoi.  Although South Vietnam
 subsequently requested accredi-
 tation of a Swedish ambassador to
 Saigon, the Swedish Government
 has deferred a decision on what
 it considers a "delicate ques-
 tion," and is likely to drag its
 feet for some time.
 France already has a dele-
 gate general in Hanoi with more
 than consular but less than dip-
 lomatic rank, and the United
 Kingdom has a consul general
 there.   Neither country has in-
 dicated, however, that it will
 change existing arrangements.
 The Socialist and far-left par-
 ties of several Western European
 countries have expressed approval
 of Stockholm's move, but have not
 mounted campaigns to persuade
 their respective governments to
 follow suit.
 The situation could change
 if such members of NATO as Den-
 mark or Norway were to recognize
 Hanoi.   Denmark has already an-
 nounced, however, that it will
 not follow the Swedish example
 at this time but will instead
 await developments in the Paris
 peace talks.   The Norwegian Gov-
 ernment announced that it would
 review the question of recogni-
 tion, but only within the context
 of the nation's policy of recog-
 nizing only one part of divided
 states.   The Oslo announcement
 stated that it would not be ex-
 pedient to act in such an unclear
 negotiating situation.
 Among the European neutrals,
 Finland announced that it would
 not recognize Hanoi because such
 a step would conflict with its
 traditional policy of nonrecog-
 nition of divided states.  Aus-
 tria and Switzerland already main-
 tain relations with South Viet-
 nam and have not announced any
 plans for changing their relations
 with the Vietnamese states. As
 neither country has strong left-
 wing pressures comparable to
 those in Sweden, the chances of
 any shift are slight.
 Within Sweden, the fact of
 recognition has been generally
 accepted.
 the Social
 Democratic leaders of the gov-
 ernment probably chose this time
 to announce recognition in order
 to shore up their position  with
 the party's left wing. The leader
 of the Swedish Communist Party,
 aware that a favorite far-left
 issue has been pre-empted by the
 government, was angered that the
 move was taken before Parliament
 could convene to discuss the mat-
 ter.   Some of the leaders of the
 non-Socialist opposition parties
 questioned the haste with which
 the decision was made and regretted
 that relations with the US were
 unnecessarily harmed, but they be-
 lieve that in principle the de-
 cision was a correct one.

 USSR REPAIRS TIES WITH FRANCE
 Moscow took further steps
 last week to patch up its "spe-
 cial relationship" with France as
 part of its over-all effort to
 restore relations with the West
 to their pre-August footing.
 Whatever political benefits the
 two participants may have thought
 they gained, they announced no
 major breakthroughs in economic
 or scientific cooperation after
 the week-long session in Paris of
 the Franco-Soviet "Grande Commis-
 sion."
 This was not the first sign
 of Soviet attentiveness to its
 ties with France.   The Soviet
 ambassador to Paris called twice
 on President de Gaulle late in
 November.   Last month, the new
 French envoy in Moscow was re-
 ceived by President Podgorny with
 unusual promptness and cordiality
 less than a week after his ar-
 rival.   Also in December, a joint
 working-level commission on
 Franco-Soviet cooperation did the
 spadework in Moscow for last
 week's meetings, and an expanded
 cultural exchange agreement was
 signed then.
 This session of the "Grande
 Commission," a body set up after
 De Gaulle's trip to the USSR in
 1966 as a vehicle for ministerial
 exploration of new areas for
 Franco-Soviet cooperation, had
 been postponed after the Soviet
 invasion of Czechoslovakia.   It
 was rescheduled at Moscow's
 urging.   French Foreign Minister
 Debre sought to play down its
 political significance, but a
 ranking Foreign Ministry official
 admitted that, despite Czech-
 oslovakia, France attaches great
 importance to its ties with
 Moscow.   De Gaulle apparently
 made no effort to resist Soviet
 efforts to broaden the discussions
 to include Europe, Vietnam,  and
 the Middle East.
 France agreed to the com-
 mission meeting at this juncture
 partly because it is anxious to
 have Soviet economic support in
 view of recent financial dif-
 ficulties.  It also would like,
 with Moscow's help, to have a
 role in negotiations on the
 Middle East.   In addition,
 De Gaulle may want to offset the
 effect of recent slight improve-
 ments in Franco-American rela-
 tions.
 Moscow and Paris agreed to
 begin negotiations in March on
 renewing their five-year trade
 pact that expires at the end of
 1969, with a view toward doubling
 trade between the two countries
 to $1.4 billion by 1974.   The
 negotiations also will involve
 supplying French equipment for
 truck and cellulose plants, and
 additional French facilities in
 the fields of natural gas,
 metallurgy,  food, and other
 light industries.   The USSR has
 actively sought to increase its
 truck capacity and has been
 looking to truck builders in
 Western Europe and the US for
 assistance.
 French exports to the USSR
 have grown rapidly over the past

 four years. In 1968, France
 probably became the USSR's prin-
 cipal Western supplier, with
 exports of some $260 million.
 France's imports from the USSR
 last year amounted to $190 mil-
 lion.   Despite its rapid growth,
 however, Franco-Soviet trade
 represents less than two percent
 of the total trade of each
 country.
 France appears likely to
 achieve another trade surplus
 with the USSR this year.   In the
 Paris talks, the USSR agreed to
 buy $80 million worth of consumer
 goods above its normal purchases,
 probably to show support for France
 during its present economic prob-
 lems.                                                                  The Soviets probably will
 not be willing to incur large
 trade deficits with France indefi-
 nitely, however.   Thus, the 1974
 trade goal may prove overly ambi-
 tious unless France is willing to
 increase imports of Soviet raw
 materials, which often are avail-
 able on better terms glsewhere.

 FRENCH SUPER MIRAGE AIRCRAFT ENTERS FINAL TESTING
 Final flight-testing of pre-
 production models of the French Su-
 per Mirage F-1 is to begin next
 month.   Flight-testing of the newly
 designed, high-performance F-1
 started in December 1966 and the
 test program to date has reportedly
 been a successful one.   Series pro-
 duction is scheduled to get under
 way this year, and the first F-1
 aircraft probably will be deliv-
 ered to the French Air Force late
 this year or early next.
 The F-1 is powered by a SNECMA
 Atar 9K50 turbojet engine--an im-
 proved version of the well-proven
 power plant of the Mirage IV
 bomber.   The new engine gives the
 F-1 greater speed,  range,  altitude,
 and payload capabilities than its
 Mirage fighter predecessors.   The
 aircraft eventually will employ a
 Super Atar engine, now under devel-
 opment, which will increase the
 Mach 2.2 speed and 1,700 nautical
 mile range of the aircraft still
 further,  and will also enable it
 to carry more armament.
 Construction and operational
 experience gained from about 800
 Mirage fighters operated by the
 air forces of nine countries has
 contributed to the technical base
 for production of the new F-1.
 The primary role of the aircraft,
 which has new and improved elec-
 tronic equipment, is all-weather
 interception at high and low alti-
 tudes.   It is also suitable for
 ground attack duties,  for which it
 can supplement its two 30-mm.  guns
 by carrying bombs and other arma-
 ment on seven attachments under the
 wings and fuselage.
 The French Air Force has placed
 an initial order for 90 F-ls as re-
 placements for Mirage IIIs.   Appro-
 priations for the first 30 are in-
 cluded in the 1969 French budget.
 The F-1 thus far has found the
 US F-4E to be its primary competi-
 tor for foreign sales.   The F-1 re-
 cently lost out to the F-4E in the
 US-dominated Japanese market, even
 though the F-1 would be less expen-
 sive for the Japanese to produce
 than the $3.5 million F-4E.   Das-
 sault, the manufacturer of the F-1
 expects that the plane will have a
 high export potential in the 1970s,
 and does not consider Japan a typi-
 cal testing ground for the salabil-
 ity of the aircraft.

 COMMONWEALTH CONCLUDES RESTRAINED CONFERENCE
 The conference of Commonwealth
 prime ministers, which ended in
 London this week, went more smoothly
 than expected and probably succeeded
 in its intent to promote a better
 understanding of the views and poli-
 cies of the 28 member countries.
 The problem of Southern Rho-
 desia was a focal point, as in the
 last Commonwealth meeting in Septem-
 ber 1966, but there was a good deal
 more reasoned argument and much less
 vituperation this year.   No one had
 a pat solution for dealing with the
 Rhodesian claim to independence, and
 the government heads differed vigor-
 ously on the courses they wanted to
 follow.   Most of the Africans,  led
 by Tanzania's Nyerere and Zambia's
 Kaunda, demanded that Britain with-
 draw the offers it made on board the
 HMS Fearless last October and reaf-
 firm its previous pledge of no in-
 dependence before majority rule.
 Although Prime Minister Wilson
 would not specifically reject his
 recent proposals, he stood by the
 "no-independence" pledge unless an-
 other settlement proved acceptable
 to the Rhodesian people.   He con-
 ceded that a referendum on a set-
 tlement might be necessary.   Accord-
 ing to the formulation in the com-
 munique,  the validity of any set-
 tlement would depend on the demo-
 cratically ascertained wishes of the
 Rhodesian people.
 Uganda's Obote criticized the
 traditional position that "internal
 problems" should not be discussed at
 Commonwealth conferences.   He
 thought that such matters as the Ni-
 gerian civil war had important im-
 plications for the Commonwealth and
 should be considered.   Nevertheless,
 most discussions on Nigeria took
 place in the corridors.   For a brief
 time, it seemed as though some prog-
 ress might be made in the general
 effort to end the war, but the con-
 testants were too unbending for
 peace talks to get started.
 In the end, the African sup-
 porters of Biafra were more con-
 cerned over issues of internal con-
 sequence, such as Asian emigration,
 and less than willing to confront
 a fellow Commonwealth member di-
 rectly.
 The question of migration
 within the Commonwealth proved to
 be as delicate as that of Rhodesia.
 In the background of the informal
 discussions on this issue is the
 fact that about 200,000 persons of
 East Indian origin reside in east
 Africa but hold British passports.
 The African countries think Britain
 should accept them, but London in-
 sists it cannot allow more than the
 1,500 annual quota.   This British
 policy came under heavy fire, but
 communique language was agreed upon
 to the effect that all Commonwealth
 governments should try to build a
 social structure of nondiscrimina-
 tion and equal opportunity.   The
 Commonwealth's secretary general
 was asked to consult with members
 on general principles.
 Wilson proposed that a con-
 ference be held next year,  and sug-
 gested that it take place at some
 other capital on the grounds that
 rotation would be good for the Com-
 monwealth.

 Last week's high-pitched fears throughout the Arab world that Israel is
 about to mount some major attack have subsided somewhat with the passage
 of time but are far from being dispelled. No indications have been discovered
 that the Israelis are making any large build-up, and border incidents have
 continued at their usual level.
 The Yemen civil war, which has dragged on for six years, has finally
 broken down to the point where loyalties can no longer be clearly discerned,
 and fighting can more accurately be described as a hodge-podge of internal
 dissension.
 The Nigerian civil war also continues with no indication of an early
 break in the military stalemate.
 Moroccan nationalists have seized on the visit of Algerian Premier
 Boumediene to revive Moroccan border claims. Although raising this issue
 publicly adds a note of discord to the superficial amity surrounding the visit,
 the King may welcome the distraction in order to demonstrate to Bou-
 mediene the real difficulties Morocco faces in any effort to deal with the
 sensitive border question.
 The campaign for the midterm elections in early February in four
 important northern states of India is gaining momentum. Prime Minister
 Gandhi and leading cabinet members are out stumping, and the opposition
 parties are increasing their tempo. The level of violence is expected to rise as
 the election nears.
 The gradual broadening and deepening of Indo-Iranian relations was
 given further impetus by the recently completed state visit by the Shah to
 India. During the visit, the Shah gave the first public indication of a
 willingness to compromise on Iran's claim to Bahrain. Reaction from other
 Persian Gulf riparians has been cautiously optimistic.
 In Turkey a new wave of student-labor unrest appears to be building
 up. Leftist and rightist student groups have clashed, and leftist-oriented
 industrial workers have, for the first time, resorted to arson and sabotage.
 Strikes may also occur at US military installations in Turkey in late January
 or early February unless current conciliation efforts involving private con-
 tractors are successful.

 USSR TAKES HARDER LOOK AT ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH INDIA
 The recently signed 1969
 Indo-Soviet trade protocol calls
 for an Indian export surplus
 that would be used to meet some
 of New Delhi's debt obligations
 to the Soviet Union.   The agree-
 ment also suggests, however, that
 Moscow is unwilling to meet In-
 dian demands for the kind and
 quantity of commodities New Delhi
 wants.
 According to the protocol,
 total Indo-Soviet trade will
 actually decline to $325 million
 this year, compared with about
 $350 million in 1968.   Although
 the agreement calls for a sharp
 20-percent increase in India's
 exports to the USSR to a level
 of $212 million, Soviet sales to
 India are expected to drop to
 about $113 million--a marked de-
 cline from the $175 million
 reached last year.  A substantial
 part of the planned increase in
 Indian shipments to the USSR re-
 flects promises made during Kosy-
 gin's visit last year to purchase
 considerably more Indian manu-
 factured goods, including steel
 and light engineering products,
 thus making greater use of In-
 dia's under-utilized production
 capacities.
 Indian sales, however, may
 fall far short of the planned
 goals.   For example, Moscow's
 agreement to buy 54,000 Indian
 rail cars between 1969 and 1973
 is being delayed because India
 claims the Soviet offer is sub-
 stantially below what the rail
 cars actually cost to build.
 Also, New Delhi is reluctant to
 increase sales of commodities
 such as jute and raw skins that
 can be sold in the West for hard
 currency.
 The Indian trade surplus
 called for in the protocol amounts
 to about $100 million.   Although

 almost every year since 1963.
 These surpluses, however, were
 not large enough to pay the total
 annual installments due on In-

 neither is the surplus planned

 under the Soviet aid program,
 largely for machinery and equip-

 Rather than looking for new

 want increased imports of Soviet
 industrial raw materials and fer-
 tilizer under existing credit ar-

 Inasmuch as India's revised fourth
 Five-Year Plan  (1969-73) is ex-

 probably will be slow in draw-

 extended in 1966 for this plan.
 UNITED PAKISTANI OPPOSITION PLANS STRATEGY
 A loose coalition of opposi-
 tion parties,                   established last
 week,  has received endorsement
 from several independent opposi-
 tion leaders to boycott the 1969-
 70 elections, and is moving ahead
 with plans to stage antigovern-
 ment protests.
 Leaders from eight opposi-
 tion parties,  covering the en-
 tire range of the political spec-
 trum,  announced on 8 January the
 formation of the Democratic Ac-
 tion Committee  (DAC).   Their
 formal statement,  couched in gen-
 eral terms to satisfy all par-
 ticipants,  set forth a minimum
 program for "restoration of Oe-
 mocracy"  in Pakistan.                         It called
 for a return to the parliamentary
 system, the institution of direct
 universal suffrage, and the res-
 toration of various civil rights.
 Simultaneously,  the DAC announced
 a joint decision to boycott the
 1969-70 elections if they are
 held under the present indirect
 electoral system which favors
 President Ayub.
 The boycott decision has
 already been endorsed by several
 independent opposition leaders,
 including former East Pakistan
 governor Azam Khan and retired
 East Pakistani chief justice
 S. M. Murshed.   Asghar Khan,
 having thus far avoided a public
 statement on the boycott, has
 told US officials that although
 he is not in full agreement with
 the strategy, he feels morally
 obligated to support it.   Ex -
 foreign minister Bhutto--still
 in jail--has maintained silence,

 ARAB STATES FEAR AN ISRAELI ATTACK
 The Arab states are convinced
 that Israel may be planning a
 large-scale attack, and Lebanon
 suspects that France has reneged
 on its offer of strong support.
 Israel has privately and
 publicly denied it is preparing
 for a major attack, and the US
 military attache in Tel Aviv con-
 firmed on 15 January that he could
 find no evidence of an impending
 attack.   Israel has blamed the
 Soviets for originating the rumor
 to further their political offen-
 sive for an imposed settlement.
 The Lebanese, meanwhile,
 continue to fear that they will
 be the prime target of any Israeli
 attack.   Their nervousness has
 been compounded by growing doubts
 that France's offer of aid was in
 fact as broad as they initially
 believed.   Convinced that their
 only chance of escaping Israel's
 wrath lies in controlling terror-
 ist attacks, the Lebanese con-
 tinue an all-out effort to crack
 down on such activity.   They even
 tried to bribe terrorist leaders
 to evacuate the Mount Hermon area
 by promising to give financial
 and material aid to operations
 conducted out of any other coun-
 try; their failure illustrates
 the growing power of Arab commando
 organizations.
 Meanwhile, the UN remains
 seized of the problem.   Mediator
 Jarring continues his efforts to
 find a compromise solution, and
 the recent Israeli retaliatory
 raids against Lebanon have caused
 US diplomats at the UN to suggest
 that the number of observers
 attached to the Israeli-Lebanese
 Mixed Armistice Commission  (ILMAC)
 be increased.   At present, ob-
 servers are stationed on the
 Lebanese side only because
 Israel considers ILMAC technically
 dead.   Consultations with the'two
 countries have emphasized that
 regardless of their conflicting
 legal positions, the stationing
 of a substantial number of observ-
 ers on both sides--a concept Israel
 has always fought--could help
 prevent terrorist activity against
 Israel and protect Lebanon from
 Israeli retaliatory action.   For
 their part, the Lebanese favor the
 idea if it can be implemented
 without their government's formal
 request and if they can avoid
 debate on the status of ILMAC.

 ZAMBIA DISCRIMINATES AGAINST OPPOSITION
 Violent intimidation and
 discrimination against the polit-
 ical opposition in Zambia have
 increased in the aftermath of
 last month's parliamentary elec-
 tions.
 Tribalism,  always just be-
 low the surface in Zambian poli-
 tics, proved to be a surprisingly
 strong factor in the elections.
 The opposition African National
 Congress  (ANC)  gained almost
 every seat in two provinces by
 a campaign that openly exploited
 and fanned tribal antagonisms.
 Although President Kenneth
 Kaunda's United National Inde-
 pendence Party  (UNIP)  still won
 81 of the 105 total seats, he
 was visibly shaken and embittered
 by the resurgence of Zambia's
 most serious threat to political
 stability.
 During a press conference
 on 23 December, Kaunda left no
 doubt that he expects his newly
 appointed governors to "organize"
 the two runaway provinces to pre-
 vent future ANC victories.   He
 publicly endorsed the slogan,
 "it pays to belong to UNIP," and
 specifically announced that op-
 position members will be fired
 from the civil service and police.
 He lumped ANC parliamentarians--
 and by implication all ANC mem-
 bers--with foreigners, mostly
 Asians, who are to be denied
 trading licenses as part of an
 economic reform program to in-
 crease Zambian ownership of busi-
 nesses.
 Local UNIP leaders and the
 rank-and-file have energetically
 begun to follow and to expand on
 Kaunda's orders.   Officials in at
 least two towns have announced
 that trading licenses will be
 given only to UNIP members.   More
 significantly, many UNIP members
 have declared open season on ANC
 followers.   Raids on ANC members
 and their property have been wide-
 spread, although most incidents
 have involved only minor vandal-
 ism.   Some UNIP-inspired incidents
 were directed against loyal UNIP
 members of the tribes that over-
 whelmingly voted for the ANC,
 which indicates how many Zambians
 of both parties view the anti-ANC
 campaign as an intertribal con-
 flict rather than as a national
 movement against disruptive tri-
 balism from any quarter.   The vio-
 lent aspects of the anti-ANC cam-
 paign can only reinforce tribally
 based apprehensions and antago-
 nisms.
 Kaunda returns on 17 January
 from a two-week trip to Britain,
 and he may move to end the intimi-
 dation.   The relatively low level
 of the violence indicates that
 the short-term threat to law and
 order can probably be dealt with.
 A serious setback, however, has
 already been dealt to Kaunda's
 effort to stamp out tribally
 based politics, the motive of his
 anti-ANC pronouncements.                  25X1

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Most Latin American governments were preoccupied last week with
 their own domestic problems.
 Colombian President Lleras has been bothered all week with Commu-
 nist-exploited student and labor demonstrations against recent increases in
 bus fares and utility rates. Violent protests in the southwestern industrial
 city of Cali on 8, 9, and 14 January forced the government to send in troops
 and impose martial law. Labor leaders have called for a general strike on 22
 January that President Lleras terms an attempt at revolution.
 Guyana is concentrating on mopping up after the abortive, Vene-
 zuelan-inspired rebellion in the southwest two weeks ago. Prime Minister
 Burnham appears to be looking for some way to implicate his archrival, Peter
 d'Aguiar, but so far has not come up with anything substantial. Venezuela,
 meanwhile, is trying to take the spotlight off its involvement by publishing
 articles by the Guyanese rebels claiming they have been badly mistreated for
 years.
 Peru's President Juan Velasco seems convinced that his government
 must maintain its hard line in the controversy with the US over the
 expropriation of International Petroleum Company (IPC) holdings. Velasco
 has reportedly authorized publication of a full-page ad in the New York
 Times outlining Peru's case, and other US oil corn anies in Peru h v
 asked to help pay for the article.
 General Wessin y Wessin's return to the Dominican Republic on 12
 January after more than three years in exile has not provoked any strong
 reaction by either his supporters or opponents. In his first public statement
 after his return, the rightist leader said that he intends to follow a "legal
 path" in establishing himself as a serious candidate for the presidential
 election in 1970.
 Anguilla has reaffirmed its independence from the Associated State of
 St. Kitts, and the premier of St. Kitts is insisting that London block
 Anguilla's action. The British have termed the move illegal and have agreed
 to withdraw their representative and shut off further aid, but an early
 resolution does not seem likely.

 BRAZILIAN LEADERSHIP SITUATION REMAINS UNCLEAR
 There has been little appar-
 ent progress in resolving Bra-
 zil's leadership quandary, but
 pressures for action are build-
 ing up.
 the government ap-
 pears to be dividing into two
 camps--for and against President
 Costa e Silva.   Basically, the
 dividing line is between those
 who,  like the President,  favor
 moderation and a return to demo-
 cratic norms, and those who want
 strong action to clean out "sub-
 version and corruption."   Rival
 military leaders are reportedly
 maneuvering for position, and
 the current strategy appears to
 be "arrest thy enemy's friend."
 Key "Generals" are Dutra de
 Castilho, commander of the cen-
 tral army headquarters,  First
 Army   (Rio)  commander Syzeno Sar-
 mento, Army Personnel Chief
 Muricy,  and Moniz de Aragao,
 chief   of the cavalry and Veteri-
 nary Service.   They apparently
 have broad respect and support
 among junior-grade officers, who
 back their eagerness to "straighten
 out" Brazil as well as their
 strongly nationalistic foreign
 policy views.   While these men
 do not oppose needed social and
 economic reforms,  if they were
 officially in power,  they would          25X1
 be more likely to strive to main-
 tain order than to initiate mean-
 ingful reforms.
 Among the steps "The Gener-
 als" and other hard liners want
 are strong new measures against
 educators,  journalists,  and mem-
 bers of the judiciary.                                                                           For ex-
 ample,  they advocate retirement
 or dismissal of judges who have
 frustrated efforts to prosecute
 "known Communists and antigovern-
 ment agitators."   "Communist"            25X1
 journalists are to be muzzled and
 prevented from continuing their
 "calumnious attacks."   A three-
 man commission is already at work
 in the Education Ministry investi-
 gating and deciding which educa-
 tors will be dismissed for "anti-
 government revolutionary activ-
 ity."
 The more moderate civilians
 and officers appear to be fairly
 closely associated with the Pres-
 ident, but--like him--even those
 in the cabinet seem to be at
 least partially  bypassed when
 decisions are made.   Costa e
 Silva is continuing his efforts
 to shore up his position, but if
 he does not act soon, he may
 have little choice but to cooper-
 ate or be replaced.

 lic has remained apathetic,  some

 limited opposition to the govern-
 ment may be developing.   For ex-
 ample, Foreign Minister Magalhaes
 Pinto is reportedly considering
 resigning in protest--he prob-
 ably suspects his position is be-
 coming untenable and hopes that
 such a dramatic move would make
 him the natural leader of those
 forces that oppose the trend of
 the government.   Sao Paulo Mayor
 Faria Lima is another moderate
 who reportedly has some backing.
 This opposition is not likely
 to get too far, however,  in view
 of the almost total absence of
 a dialogue between the government
 and civilian politicians, and
 the growing military distaste
 for "the politicians."   Costa e
 Silva has publicly blamed lack
 of political support for the exec-
 utive as his reason for assuming
 dictatorial powers, virtually ac-
 cusing members of the progovern-
 ment party of insincerity and be-
 trayal.   Such conditions do not
 bode well for a reopening of Con-
 gress, officially scheduled for
 March.   Although the President
 might like to return to democratic
 forms,  neither he nor the mili-
 tary seem anxious to provide a
 forum for even a "sanitized" op-
 position.
 The Brazilian Government is
 drifting leaderless, with an un-
 clear chain of command and a grow-
 ing power vacuum that has set off
 a debilitating struggle for con-
 trol.   It is possible, however,
 that this inherently unstable
 situation could continue for some
 time--largely because there is
 no consensus among the military
 on who should re lace Costa e
 Silva.
 VENEZUELA'S NEW GOVERNMENT TO LIMIT POLICY INITIATIVES
 President-elect Rafael Cal-
 dera will be slow to introduce
 social and economic reforms in
 Venezuela during his first year
 in office.
 Caldera,  the first Christian
 Democrat elected to the presidency,
 won only a narrow plurality in
 elections last December,  and his
 party failed to secure a majority
 in the Congress.   Left-wing Chris-
 tian Democrats view his victory
 as a mandate for swift implementa-
 tion of the party program.   Cal-
 dera, however, has taken the more
 realistic view that an expected
 decline in government revenues
 and the strength of the Demo-
 cratic Action Party's congres-
 sional bloc will seriously limit
 his ability to initiate new pol-
 icies.
 Rather, Caldera will concen-
 trate on broadening public sup-
 port for his government by push-
 ing noncontroversial social pro-
 grams,                                                                          such as housing,  sanita-
 tion,  and education, delaying
 major legislation that might be
 controversial.   In line with this

 tentative strategy, Caldera has
 announced that his government
 will eschew formal political al-
 liances with other parties and
 instead will negotiate ad hoc ar-
 rangements with the opposition
 depending on what legislation is
 being considered.
 Heavy emphasis will be put
 on winning the support of inde-
 pendents in Congress.   Perhaps
 as a means of ensuring their co-
 operation, Caldera has announced
 that his cabinet will consist
 largely of noncontroversial in-
 dependents and technicians.  Some
 Christian Democratic Party lead-
 ers predict that all but the
 three top posts--Foreign Affairs,
 Interior, and Government--will
 he held by independents.
 A number of problems will
 confront Caldera after he assumes
 office,  including relations with
 the Communist countries, a terri-
 torial dispute with Guyana,  and
 the formulation of a new petro-
 leum policy.   Although Caldera
 has not committed himself yet
 to specific policies, Christian
 Democratic leaders have already
 indicated that the new govern-
 ment favors establishing diplo-
 matic relations with the Soviet
 Union and other Eastern European
 countries as soon as possible.
 Page 2 4
 SECRET
 Caldera's views concerning
 the emotional issue of Venezuela's
 claim to over three fifths of
 Guyana's territory are not clear.
 Although he has taken a concilia-
 tory tone in public statements
 on the issue, he will be under
 pressure from the military and
 other domestic "hawks" not to
 temper Venezuela's claims to the
 area.
 Another concern to Caldera
 is the formulation of a new pe-
 troleum policy that will encour-
 age additional foreign investment
 in Venezuela.   Caldera hopes to
 be able to present a "national
 solution" to the country before
 1973 so that investment plans for
 continued development of the oil
 fields can be made well before
 the present oil concession con-
 tracts expire in 1983.   The Demo-
 cratic Action Party, however,
 has already given notice that it
 will fight any basic changes in
 the oil policy it forged during
 the ten years that it held power.
 Caldera may be able to capi-
 talize on an initial reservoir
 of good will to go forward with
 a social improvement program.
 Whether his hoped-for government
 of "national consensus" will re-
 assure the country and prepare
 the way for other initiatives is
 uncertain at this time.

 MORE LABOR AND STUDENT AGITATION EXPECTED IN COLOMBIA
 Government economic measures
 are causing resentment in Colom-
 bia.                       Martial law was imposed in
 one city last week, and security
 forces are preparing for new trou-
 ble.                       A labor front representing
 all political viewpoints has
 called for a general strike on
 22 January, and President Lleras
 has reacted by terming the strike
 call an attempt at revolution.
 Lleras' treatment of organ-
 ized labor's problems as sub-
 ordinate to other considerations
 in Colombian economic development
 has created a growing estrange-
 ment between him and top labor
 leaders.   Last May, several major
 unions, both Communist and demo-
 cratic, formed a front to oppose
 plans for an imposed national
 savings fund, compulsory arbitra-
 tion, and other measures affect-
 ing workers.   Lleras' efforts to
 pacify the union leaders by in-
 creased consultations, creation
 of a national labor council, and
 the naming of a more popular labor
 minister were offset by his con-
 tinued adamance on pushing his
 program.
 Meanwhile, orthodox and ex-
 tremist Communists have been com-
 peting for greater influence in
 labor and student groups.   In-
 creases in bus fares and utility
 rates effective this month caused
 such resentment that labor lead-
 ers seized on them as a starting
 point for agitation.   Students
 in Cali were egged on to demon-
 strations that became so violent
 last week that martial law was
 declared and the government sus-
 pended the rate increases there
 for "restudy."  The labor union
 front in Valle, the province in
 which Cali is located, has called
 for a general strike on 22 Janu-
 ary that is being promoted by
 labor leaders of every political
 stripe, including followers of
 former dictator Rojas Pinilla.
 Support for similar strikes is
 mounting in other cities and the
 return of students to classes on
 20 January offers other possibili-
 ties for violent demonstrations.
 Troops are being alerted for pos-
 sible moves to maintain order.
 The President appeared on
 television on 13 January to refute
 charges that his-government is un-
 fair to the workers and to warn
 that it will not tolerate con-
 tinuing public disorder.   Lleras
 apparently blames the Communists
 in the united front for the at-
 tempts to escalate the labor pro-
 tests, although the two major con-
 federations--both non-Communist--
 are in the vanguard of the strike
 call.   Lleras is likely to act
 strongly if provoked, which in
 the present situation could cause
 serious antigovernment reaction.
 Despite the basic soundness of
 his determination not to favor
 special interest groups at the
 expense of the entire country,
 Lleras' earlier failure to handle
 labor complaints with more finesse
 has helped to create this impasse.
 The situation is not unlike his
 showdowns over political issues
 last year; showdowns which he won,
 but at the cost of needless
 political friction.

 PANAMA'S MILITARY GOVERNMENT ADOPTS REPRESSIVE MEASURES
 Panama's military-controlled
 government is taking additional
 steps to tighten its grip on the
 country despite signs of business
 deterioration caused by earlier
 arbitrary actions.
 The resignation last week
 of five of the eight civilian
 cabinet ministers, who had be-
 come dissatisfied with the Na-
 tional Guard's restrictions on
 their authority, is symptomatic
 of the growing apprehension of
 many Panamanians over military
 retrenchment on pledges to work
 toward rapid restoration of in-
 dividual rights and constitutional
 government.   The appointment of
 men of little political stature
 to fill the cabinet posts is
 seen as still another move to
 reinforce subservience to the
 guard's policies, and possibly
 to undermine the influence of
 the country's oligarchy.   Pub-
 lication of a strongly worded
 denunciation of the government
 issued by the resigning cabinet
 officials was banned by the junta,
 which continues to maintain strict
 controls over all news media.
 Rumors circulating in Pan-
 ama City of impending new ar-
 rests of unspecified "high per-
 sonages" are adding to uneasiness
 over the guard's high-handed
 tactics.   Recent arrests of
 former government officials
 without due judicial process,
 the seizure of one major news-
 paper and the forcible shutdown
 of another, and the closure of
 the university and the capital's
 largest secondary school have had
 adverse effects on the business
 climate and are creating alarm
 among the wealthy
 On the heels of the cabinet
 break, the government confiscated
 a shipment of US newspapers, ap-
 parently because they contained
 accounts of new guerrilla clashes
 near the Costa Rican border.   The
 renewed fighting was presumably
 instigated by supporters of ousted
 president Arias
 Sentiment against the
 guard remains high in the western
 part of the country and the in-
 surgents may be able to continue
