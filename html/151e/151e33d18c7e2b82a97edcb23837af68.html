 .Ayatollah Khomeini's entourage has announced that
 he will delay his return until the airports in Iran are
 opened--probably no earlier than Sunday.   Sporadic ne-
 gotiations are continuing between Khomeini and Prime
 Minister Bakhtiar but there appears  to be a wide gulf
 separating their positions.
 25X1
 25X1
 Bakhtiar has suggested
 that Khomeini delay his return for several weeks and
 that elections be scheduled within the next three months
 to select an assembly to make changes in the constitution.
 Bakhtiar would remain as head of a caretaker government.
 Bakhtiar undoubtedly realizes that he risks provok-
 ing massive demonstrations and continued strikes if he
 does not allow Khomeini to return soon.   Yesterday the
 government banned unauthorized demonstrations.   If
 strictly enforced, this ban may well lead to violence.
 Bakhtiar is probably under pressure from the military,
 however, not to give in.
 Bakhtiar is trying to win popular support by appear-
 ing as the defender of the constitution.   His statements
 and actions, however, indicate he is moving more and
 more into the military's camp, thereby eroding his claim
 to be an independent figure.  Many of the progovernment
 demonstrators yesterday were probably military personnel.
 Khomeini clearly wants to return to Iran soon in
 order to take hold of the situation, but he is a cautious
 person and the uncertainties are giving him pause.   He
 probably also calculates that the threat of his return
 keeps the pressure on the Bakhtiar government and that
 he has little to lose by stretching out the suspence
 for several more days because the government and the
 Iranian economy remain paralyzed by strikes.

 //The continued refusal of many Iranian workers to
 return to their jobs in several key economic organiza-
 tions reflects the increasingly influential role being
 played by highly politicized workers'  councils.   These
 councils, often made up of persons not employed by the
 organizations, have either taken over all decision-
 making or are strong enough to thwart any decisions
 taken by management without their approval.//
 In the critical oil sector, Khomeini's agent--the
 leader of the Liberation Movement of Iran, Mehdi
 Bazargan--apparently secured the agreement of many
 workers to return to their jobs in order to produce
 enough oil to meet domestic requirements.   Many workers
 who did return have continued to be nonproductive.
 Management at the National Iranian Oil Company report-
 edly is unable or unwilling to make any substantive
 decisions without the approval of labor relations com-
 mittees at the refineries.   Most production facilities
 remain shut down and the US Embassy doubts that even
 routine maintenance is being done on inactive units.
 As a result of continuing problems in the oil
 sector, crude production has failed to rise above the
 400,000 to 600,000 barrel-per-day level during the past
 few weeks.   This level of output, combined with techni-
 cal problems at the refineries and on at least one pipe-
 line, probably are limiting the production of refined
 oil products to between one-half and two-thirds of do-
 mestic requirements.
 // The activities of the Central Bank, Bank Melli--
 the major commercial bank--the national power agency,
 the customs organization,  Iran Air, and several other
 agencies,  also are subject to the whims of workers'
 councils.   Invariably,  those councils are refusing to
 approve any payments to foreigners or foreign companies,
 a policy reinforced by the Central Bank's refusal to
 sanction any transfers of foreign exchange.   As a re-
 sult, both domestic and international business opera-
 tions remain frozen.//

 BRIEFS AND COMMENTS
 JAPAN:   Policy on Vietnam
 //Japanese Foreign Ministry officials expect China's
 Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping  (Teng Hsiao-ping)  to press
 for a stronger Japanese stand against Vietnamese actions
 in Indochina--and by implication against the Soviet
 Union--when Deng meets Prime Minister Ohira in Tokyo
 early next month.   The Japanese reportedly plan to
 turn aside any Chinese attempt to invoke the antihegemony
 clause of the Sino-Japanese peace and friendship treaty
 as the basis for a joint approach toward events in
 Southeast Asia.//
 //To fend off Chinese pressure, Ohira and other
 leaders are certain to cite the actions they have taken
 since the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea.   The gov-
 ernment has made known its opposition to Vietnamese
 aggression by announcing a review of the economic
 package agreed to during Vietnamese Foreign Minister
 '
 Trinh
 s visit to Japan last month.//
 //The Japanese have emphasized that their policy
 toward Indochina will remain in step with that of the
 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian
 Nations--Japan's most important economic partners in
 the region.   The increase in Japanese aid to Thailand
 announced during Prime Minister Kriangsak's visit to
 Tokyo last week, for example, was designed to assuage
 Thai security concerns as well as to signal the priority
 Japan attaches to ASEAN's interests.//
 //Foreign Minister Sonoda reportedly called for a
 reassessment of Japanese policy toward the region in the
 wake of the Kampuchean conflict.   Major policy changes
 are unlikely, but the government is certain to avoid too
 close an identification with China's anti-Vietnamese and
 anti-Soviet stand on Indochina./

 ITALY:   Communists Intend to Withdraw Support
 Italian Communist Party chief BerZinguer is likely
 to launch a new attack on the Christian Democratic gov-
 ernment today and to announce his party's intention to
 withdraw its parliamentary support.   The Communist move
 will threaten the collapse of the government and greatly
 increase the possibility that an early parliamentary
 election will be caZZed after a protracted period of
 maneuvering.   There appears to be no consensus on an
 alternative formula.
 //If the Christian Democrats do not yield to Commu-
 nist demands for a larger role in the governing process,
 the Communists--convinced that time is working against
 the party--are clearly prepared to risk an early elec-
 tion.//
 Although Christian Democratic leaders have declared
 their willingness to discuss differences with the Com-
 munist Party,  they are not prepared to meet the party's
 demands and also seem willing to opt for a new election--
 particularly if the Communists could be blamed for the
 government's collapse.
 The smaller parties, notably the Socialist and
 Social Democratic, are strongly opposed to an early
 election in which they expect to do poorly.   These
 parties are maneuvering desperately--against increasingly
 unfavorable odds--to work out an alternative governing
 formula.
 Uncertainty concerning the fate of Prime Minister
 Andreotti's government is likely to continue into next
 week when its proposed economic plan is scheduled for
 debate in parliament;                                    Andreotti  25X1
 may announce his intention to step down on Monday when
 this debate begins.   Christian Democrats have reportedly
 been seeking to maneuver the Communists into breaking
 with the government over the economic plan.   They would
 blame the Communists for ignoring Italy's pressing prob-
 lems and hope to gain a tactical advanta e over them in
 any future election.                                                    25X1

 at the site.   Construction at oneplant was 70-percent

 USSR:   Effects of Fuel Crisis in Armenia
 The Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic is bearing
 the brunt of the two-month halt in Iranian natural gas
 deliveries to the USSR.   The resulting gas shortage
 totals nearly 1 billion cubic feet a day--about one-
 fourth of the area's energy consumption--and is forcing
 Moscow to convert gas burning facilities to oil,  cut
 back in energy consumption, and manipulate energy ex-
 ports.
 The halt in gas imports has forced industries and
 central heating plants in Armenia's major cities such
 as Yerevan to cut back sharply on heat supply.   Neigh-
 boring republics--Georgia and Azerbaijan--are also feel-
 ing the effects of the fuel shortages during this colder
 than normal winter.                                                     25X1
 Moscow,  apparently not expecting a quick resumption
 of gas shipments,  is instituting emergency measures to
 find fuel supplies.   Underground gas storage reserves
 are being drawn down.   Pipeline flows have been reversed
 bringing in gas from the north.   in addition, electric
 power plants and boilers are being converted from gas
 to oil.
 The conversion of industrial boilers and heating
 plants from gas- to oil-fired systems is fairly simple
 technically but could take a month or more.   Shortages
 of necessary valves, pumps,  storage tanks,  and skilled
 workers is delaying the conversion process.   In contrast,
 many large power plants in the region are designed to
 burn either fuel and can be switched from gas to oil
 quickly.
 The substitution of oil for gas in the Transcaucasus
 Republics during this fuel crisis is likely to reduce
 oil exports from the Black Sea port of Batumi by about
 40,000 to 50,000 barrels per day.   The Soviets, however,
 will continue to honor their contracts for oil deliveries
 to the West and could offset any localized reductions by
 stepping up shipments from other nonaffected Black Sea
 ports.

 POLAND:   Gierek-Wyszynski Talks
 The main item on the agenda of the lengthy meeting
 on Wednesday between Polish party leader Gierek and
 Catholic Primate Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski was probably
 the visit in May of Pope John Paul II to celebrate the
 900th anniversary of the martyrdom of Poland's patron
 saint,  Saint Stanislaw.   Although the regime would like
 to postpone the visit,  the Pope has said publicly that it
 is his  "duty" to come.   The regime is unlikely to block
 the visit as it is well aware that massive civil dis-
 turbances would probably occur should it do so.
 The two Polish leaders, who last met 15 months ago,
 probably reviewed such matters as the Church's demands
 for greater access to the media and permits to construct
 new churches.   The regime has not given ground on these
 or other issues.   Probably also on the agenda was a dis-
 cussion of the country's severe economic problems, now
 further aggravated by the severe weather that has crip-
 Wyszynski regards Gierek as the most capable person
 in the Polish leadership, and has supported the regime
 when Gierek appears threatened by either internal party
 wrangling or possible civic unrest.

 The shaky alliance between Prime Minister Habre and
 President MaZZoum has been further imperiled by the re-
 ported arrest by Habre yesterday of two senior govern-
 ment officials.   Habre supporters have also called for a
 general strike in Ndjamena.   A showdown between MaZZoum
 and Habre has been rumored for weeks.
 Habre is probably using these maneuvers to gain
 more control of the government and may even feel confi-
 dent enough to try to push Malloum aside.   His military
 position improved sharply after his forces recently cap-
 tured a rebel stronghold in eastern Chad.    Habre may
 also believe he can count on the support of Ndjamena's
 predominantly Muslim population.   Malloum, however, has
 resources of his own,  including a numerically superior
 military force and the backing of Habre's arch-foe,
 gendarmerie commander Kamougue.
 France, Chad's major benefactor, sent additional
 security forces last Friday,  reflecting Paris'  growing
 concern that the Malloum-Habre coalition's days are num-
 bered.   The French have long advocated Muslim presence
 in the government but have become increasingly unhappy
 with Habre's behavior.
 Relations between Malloum and Habre have been un-
 easy since their reconciliation last August that called
 for greater Muslim participation in the government.   The
 two leaders have been at odds over the timetable for in-
 tegrating Habre's forces into the Chadian Army and the
 Prime Minister's demands for more power.

 rate against foreign currencies.   The exchange rate will
 be carefully controlled to limit devaluation pressures.
 The government hopes these changes will regain the 5 to
 6 percent economic growth rate averaged before 1975;
 growth has averaged only 1.9 percent annually since then.
 In recent years, South Africa's main source of foreign
 capital has been loans from international financial in-
 stitutions.   Liabilities to these institutions almost
 tripled between 1974 and 1977, reaching $7.9 billion.
 Foreign confidence in Prime Minister Botha's government
 has weakened because of racial strife and economic sanc-
 tions, and officials hope the exchange reforms will induce
 foreigners to invest enough capital along with technical
 knowledge and entrepreneurship to produce a significant
 impetus to growth.                                                      25X1

 //Taiwan is reacting to the normalization of ties
 )etween the US and China with a mix of bitterness and
 hard-headed calculation.   Ton-level officials on Taiwan
 1ione  to retain as much as possible of the US connection
 ,nd appear determined to delay implementation of unoffi-
 rial relationships with the US.
 President Chiang Ching-kuo has made a determined
 effort to promote public unity and confidence in Taiwan's
 future. He has tried to convey an impression of ef-
 fective government action to meet the crisis by holding
 emergency meetings of economic and military officials;
 by pledging to increase defense spending,  seek modern
 arms, and achieve military self-sufficiency;  and by
 reiterating that he will never negotiate with the
 Quick pledges by major foreign corporations and
 banks to continue doing business with Taiwan have rein-
 forced government efforts to bolster public confidence.
 After initial jitters, Taiwan's stock market has stabi-
 lized.   There have been no signs of unusual capital
 flight or real estate sales.
 The public has responded to both the situation and
 to the government's handling of it with an upsurge of
 patriotism.   Except for the anti-US riots in Taipei
 on 16 and 27 December, the government has had no dif-
 ficulty maintaining public order.
 One of the government's first responses to the US
 decision was to postpone the partial national legislative
 election scheduled for 23 December.   Opposition politi-
 cians initially reacted with pledges of support for the
 government in the interest of national unity.   Suspicion

 of the government's intentions grew quickly in opposition
 ranks, however,  and early this month the authorities
 broke up three meetings called to protest cancellation
 of the election.
 //Last weekend,  the government arrested a prominent
 opposition figure, Yu Teng-fa, and his son and charged
 them with having contacts with an alleged infiltrator
 from the mainland.   The decision to crack down came
 in early January when Chiang apparently agreed with
 the recommendation of his top security officials that
 the current situation calls for a minimum of public
 criticism of the government.//
 //The authorities must reckon with the possibility
 of a violent reaction should the crackdown become more
 widespread and stimulate an adverse public reaction.
 They are reported to be ready, however, to make further
 arrests if necessary.   Other opposition figures are
 rallying to Yu's support, but have apparently not yet
 decided how to react.//
 Chiang has repudiated the widely discussed options
 of declaring an "independent" Taiwan, turning toward the
 USSR, or negotiating with China.   His emphasis on the
 importance of continued ties with Washington suggests

 that even though Taipei will bargain hard,  it eventually
 will compromise on the key issue of eliminating govern-
 ment-level relations,  and perhaps on other issues as
 Taipei may view the recent limited, unofficial pub-
 lic discussion it has fostered on the possibility of
 developing nuclear weapons as useful reassurance for a
 jittery domestic audience and as a lever to be used
 on the US.   Although the motivation for developing
 nuclear weapons may now be stronger than previously,
 especially among defense production and research offi-
 cials, Chiang has publicly repudiated this option.   He
 will continue to be deeply influenced in this policy
 area by the necessity of maintaining vital links with
 Washington, including cooperation in the nuclear energy
