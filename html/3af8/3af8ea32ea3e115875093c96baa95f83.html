 PREFACE
 To determine real trends in China's foreign trade since 1970, the effects
 of world inflation and of the devaluation of the US dollar must be factored out
 of current value data. This research aid presents estimates of China's trade
 with the non-Communist countries in current and constant US dollars for the
 years 1970-75.
 An upward bias also exists in the current value data for China's trade with
 Communist countries. The principal cause of this bias was introduced when
 barter prices were revised to world market levels, after years of adherence to
 "historical" prices. The devaluation of the dollar vis-a-vis the ruble and
 East European currencies has also introduced inflation into the current
 dollar data. Deflation of China's trade with the Communist countries is a
 separate study, however, requiring different methods and more information
 than is currently available.
 Section I provides a brief overview of historical trends in the current
 dollar value of China's trade with non-Communist countries. Section II
 describes and analyzes aggregate price trends for PRC exports and imports.
 Section III deflates trade into constant US dollars and analyzes the aggregate
 quantity-or real-trends. Derivation of the price indexes for China's exports
 and imports is explained in the Appendixes.

 China: Real Trends in Trade
 With Non-Communist Countries Since 1970

 1. Historical Trends in the Dollar Value of Trade
 Since the founding of the People's Republic, China's trade with the non-
 Communist countries has advanced in fits and starts-the result of a complex
 interaction of foreign and domestic economic and political factors (see figure
 1). Until recently, exports and imports were basically in balance.
 Between 1950 and 1959 China's total trade-Communist and non-
 Communist-more than tripled, outstripping the growth of the domestic
 economy. Because of Mao's "lean to one side" foreign policy and the Korean
 war trade restrictions imposed by the Western nations, most of the growth in
 trade was with the Soviet Bloc-non-Communist countries accounted for only
 one-third of the total.
 Trade slumped in the 1960s; not until 1970 did the total again reach the
 peak level of 1959. Nevertheless, the non-Communist portion increased
 sharply. The Sino-Soviet rift-together with three disastrous harvests following
 the Great Leap Forward-encouraged China to diversify trade. By 1966,
 China had shifted three-quarters of its trade to the West. During the Cultural
 Revolution, however, China's attentions turned inward, and trade stagnated.
 The resumption of regular planning during the Fourth Five-Year Plan
 brought a new wave of trade. From 1971 to 1975, the dollar value of China's
 trade tripled; and the non-Communist share of China's trade rose to nearly 85
 percent-by far the largest share of any Communist country's trade. At the
 same time, flexible exchange rates and unstable world prices created a new
 element of uncertainty for China's central planners. No longer could the
 Chinese plan for balanced trade simply by adjusting the targeted quantities of
 exports or imports within a framework of known world prices. After 1971,
 total receipts and expenditures could be determined with certainty only after
 contracts were in hand. In 1974, China registered its first major trade deficit
 with the West.
 Through the 1950s and 1960s, dollar values probably provided a fairly
 accurate measure of the real growth in China's trade with the West. World
 inflation amounted to only 2 or 3 percent per year, and foreign currencies
 were fixed against the dollar with only occasional changes. Since the

 Smithsonian Agreement in December 1971 and the OPEC oil embargo in
 October 1973, the dollar has declined in value, and world prices have jumped
 sharply. As a result, dollar values have distorted the real trends in China's
 trade. To understand recent developments in China's trade, it has become
 necessary, therefore, to reexamine the period since 1970, sorting out both price
 and quantity trends.
 11. Aggregate Price Trends
 Table 1 presents aggregate price indexes for China's exports and imports
 in terms of US dollars, using 1970 as the base for comparison. In general,
 China's export prices varied little from 1970 to 1971, but reflect the full extent
 of the devaluation of the dollar in 1972. Big increases occurred in 1973 and
 1974, followed by a slight decline during the world recession in 1975. Import
 prices fell in 1971 and remained below the 1970 level in 1972 despite the
 dollar devaluation, but picked up in 1973 and skyrocketed in 1974, before
 leveling off in 1975.
 A. Export Prices
 Exports from China's extractive sector exhibited greater price fluctuations
 than exports from either the agricultural or manufacturing sectors (see
 figure 2). This sector is the smallest and, therefore, the most affected by price
 movements of a few commodities. The decline in 1971 and 1972 was due
 largely to falling prices for antimony and tungsten ores; prices for fluorspar,
 natural graphite, common salt, and many other crude minerals actually
 increased. From 1973 on, this sector, of course, was dominated by the meteoric
 rise in crude oil prices.
 Export prices for products of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors
 followed almost identical trends, except for 1973, when rice and soybean
 prices jumped sharply. Overall, prices in these sectors declined about equally
 in 1975, although the recession hit certain groups of commodities more than
 others. Average prices, for example, for China's exports of natural textile fibers
 (mostly silk, angora, and cashmere) fell by almost a third from 1974 levels,
 while prices for textile fabrics (mostly cottons) fell by only 20 percent and
 clothing prices dropped by less than 15 percent.
 Export prices for consumer goods initially ran ahead of foodstuffs and
 industrial supplies, but then fell behind in 1973. Crude oil buoyed up the
 average for industrial supplies in 1974 and 1975; with oil excluded, however,
 this sector fared no better than foodstuffs or consumer goods.

 Compared with other end-use categories, export prices for capital goods
 diverged most from the general trend. Prices were virtually constant from
 1970 to 1972 and only rose slowly thereafter. Some of these products
 apparently were offered at "friendship prices" under aid agreements-exports
 of railroad equipment to Tanzania, for instance. In part, however, the slow
 increase in prices must reflect the difficulties these Chinese goods face in
 competing with machinery and equipment produced in the West.

 B. Import Prices
 China's overall import price index generally followed the trend for
 manufactures, the major component (see figure 3). Imports of agricultural
 commodities-wheat, corn, sugar, soybeans, and cotton-exerted an upward
 influence in every year, while imports of commodities from the extractive
 sector-primarily natural rubber-had only a minor effect on the overall
 trend.
 Import prices for capital goods did not begin to rise until 1973, a year
 after the devaluation of the dollar, but then increased at a fairly steady pace.
 The devaluation of the dollar probably was not reflected in immediate price
 increases because of the long lead times between contracts and deliveries-
 most of China's capital imports are not shelf items. Machinery and transport
 equipment had a relatively small impact on the overall import price index,
 however, until 1974 and 1975, when expenditures on these items climbed to 30
 percent of the total import bill.
 Prices for imports of industrial supplies-consisting chiefly of steel,
 nonferrous metals, and petrochemicals-had the greatest bearing on China's
 overall import price index. In general, steel prices fell in 1971 and 1972, but
 surpassed the 1970 level by 1973 and nearly doubled by 1975. Prices for
 finished products increased faster than for forms, as did prices for cold-rolled,
 high-carbon, alloy, and specialty steels. Import prices for copper, nickel,
 tungsten, and titanium fell sharply in 1971 and generally did not regain the
 level of 1970 again until 1975. Price trends for petrochemicals-including
 benzene, various fibers, plastics and their intermediates, ammonium chloride,
 ammonium sulfate, and urea-were highly correlated, due largely to their
 derivation from a common base. In most of these cases, however, the lag
 behind petroleum price hikes amounted to over a year.
 C. Factors Affecting Price Trends
 Prices for individual export commodities may have fluctuated just as
 much as prices for individual imports. Nevertheless, China's overall export
 price index tends to be less volatile than its import price index because China's
 exports are dispersed over a wide range of commodities, while imports are
 concentrated in a narrow range of goods that are essential to the state.
 Because a handful of commodity groups account for the bulk of China's
 imports, price instability for any one of these can have a major effect on the
 overall import price index. On the other hand, the Chinese are probably in a

 better bargaining position on prices because they buy a significant share of the
 world's exports of some commodities. China, for example, is the world's largest
 importer of chemical fertilizers. Moreover, because all transactions are
 handled by state trading corporations, the Chinese probably derive some
 oligopsonistic power from the ability to offer potentially large sales to
 individual firms in the West. Just what effect this leverage has had on import
 price trends is difficult to assess. China's import prices have lagged behind
 rising world trade prices in recent years, but this may only reflect the long
 lead times between the signing of contracts and deliveries for many of China's
 imports-in some instances as long as a year or more.
 The Chinese siphon off for export some of just about everything they
 produce. Until the Chinese began exporting crude oil, no single export took
 more than a small share of domestic output. Because China's exports are
 scattered over a myriad of products, a sharp drop in price for any single
 commodity can have only a small net effect on the overall export price index.
 For the same reason, China has little leverage on prices except in a few minor
 commodities-bristles, downs, feathers, tung and linseed oil, tungsten, and
 antimony, for example.

 trade largely explain the divergences between the indexes. Prices for China's
 exports, even excluding oil, increased faster than those of other Asian less
 developed countries (LDCs) but merely kept pace with inflation worldwide.
 Unlike China, the Asian LDCs depend on a few commodities-rice, rubber,
 sugar, copra, tin, and lumber-for a major share of export earnings. In
 general, prices for those commodities fell in 1971-72, shot up in 1973-74, and
 dropped again in 1975.
 China's import price index oscillated around the export price index for the
 industrial countries-China's major suppliers-falling below in 1971 and 1972
 largely because of declining prices for fertilizers, nonferrous metals, and steel,
 and rising above in 1974 mostly because of the sharp jump in prices for wheat,
 cotton, and rubber. Manufactures such as automobiles and other consumer
 durables, which have had a stabilizing influence on the export price index of
 the industrial countries, were not among China's imports.
 E. Terms of Trade
 Table 3 presents a method for converting the price indexes derived in
 terms of US dollars into indexes in terms of Chinese Ren Min Bi (RMB). From
 the Chinese point of view, export prices probably did not begin to rise
 perceptibly until 1972. Although China's export price index increased 11

 percent in terms of dollars from 1970 to 1972, this was due entirely to the
 devaluation of the dollar: measured in Chinese RMB (or even in IMF Special
 Drawing Rights-SDRs), export prices were virtually unchanged. Import
 prices fell even faster in RMB than in dollars. The resulting terms of trade
 index is the same in both currencies, however. China's commodity terms of
 trade improved substantially between 1970 and 1973, but thereafter declined
 just as quickly as it had risen.
 The Chinese insulate internal prices from external inflation, in effect, by
 taxing exports and using the proceeds (the difference between the
 procurement cost and export revenues) to subsidize imports. So long as export
 prices keep pace with rising import prices (and trade is balanced), the
 domestic economy can be isolated completely. There is no evidence that the
 Chinese responded to the deterioration in the terms of trade after 1973 by
 raising internal prices on goods that are exported; but the foreign trade
 corporations may have passed along price increases on some imports to the end
 users. This could affect purchasing decisions to the extent such decisions are
 made at a local level.
 To central planners, exports are merely a means of financing imports.
 When trade is viewed in barter terms, the terms of trade becomes critical. If
 the terms of trade improve, a larger volume of imports can be financed with
 the same volume of exports, or exports can be reduced. Declining terms of
 trade spell trouble.
 III. Aggregate Quantity Trends
 Table 4 compares the current and constant dollar values of China's
 exports and imports. Current dollar values greatly exaggerated the real growth
 in trade. From 1970 to 1975 exports and imports both increased about 250
 percent in value, but only 73 percent and 79 percent, respectively, in quantity,
 measured in 1970 prices. This is still a healthy growth rate-in comparison,
 China's GNP grew only 36 percent; and the volume of world trade, only about
 30 percent over the same period.
 Current dollar values, moreover, failed to reveal important trade
 developments. Price increases disguised the difficulties that Chinese exports
 encountered during the world recession, when the volume of PRC exports
 actually declined. In 1970 dollars, Chinese exports expanded at a rate of about
 15 percent per year from 1970 to 1973, but fell in 1974, and just barely
 regained the 1973 level in 1975 (see figure 4). The 1970 dollar series largely

 reflects the real trends for China's traditional exports, however, since little
 weight is given to crude oil exports, which were valued at an estimated 1970
 price of $1.70 per barrel. In the 1975 dollar series, on the other hand, Chinese
 exports continued upward with only a marginal dip in 1974, solely because of
 the weight attached to crude oil exports, which were valued at $12.88 per
 barrel-the average 1975 price for China's oil exports to Japan.*
 Current dollar values also concealed significant trends in the real level of
 China's imports. Even though large-scale purchases of complete plants did not
 resume until 1972, the volume of imports picked up immediately following
 the Cultural Revolution and accelerated every year until 1974, when the worst
 trade deficit in PRC history lead to a cutback in the volume of imports.
 Imports continued to fall through most of 1975.
 A. Export Trends in Current and Constant Dollars
 Table 5 presents estimates of current dollar values for China's exports
 classified according to sectors of origin, end-use categories, and major
 categories of the Standard International Trade Classification. The agricultural
 and manufacturing sectors have contributed about equally to China's export
 earnings, with the extractive sector coming into the picture only recently.
 * The real increase in China's exports from 1973 on is probably somewhat lower than suggested by the
 1975 dollar series and somewhat higher than indicated by the 1970 dollar series.

 major fluctuations occurred largely in grains, textiles-fibers, fabrics, and
 clothing-and miscellaneous consumer goods. Some exports, such as oilseeds,
 were virtually constant over the entire period.
 From  1970 to  1972,  China's exports of agricultural goods and
 manufactures each grew at a real rate of 15 to 20 percent per year (see
 figure 5). In 1973 Peking stepped up exports of manufactures-particularly
 textile fabrics, clothing, and handicrafts. In order to boost production and
 export of finished textiles, Peking not only held back exports of raw textile
 fibers but also imported record quantities-cotton imports, for example,
 reached 400,000 metric tons. The former action was largely responsible for the
 reduced growth rate for agricultural exports. In 1974 exports of manufactures
 fell, as did agricultural commodities to a lesser degree. Only oil and rice
 appeared to offer any prospects for growth.* Economic recovery got under
 way in the developed countries in 1975, and China's exports of textile fibers
 and fabrics nearly returned to 1973 levels. Lack of demand among the LDCs
 continued to plague China's exports of consumer goods, however.
 B. Import Trends in Current and Constant Dollars
 Current and constant dollar values for China's imports are presented in
 tables 7 and 8, respectively. Most of China's foreign exchange expenditures
 have been for finished and semifinished manufactures, rather than for
 agricultural or extractive raw materials. Although China's purchases of
 foodstuffs and capital goods have attracted much attention, these have been
 small in comparison with China's imports of industrial supplies.
 In real terms, China's imports of manufactures increased every year since
 1970-taking a big leap in 1973 (see figure 6). Sharply increasing imports of
 capital goods were largely responsible for maintaining the volume of
 manufactures after 1973. Imports of most other commodities fell.
 During 1971 to 1973, the first three years of the Fourth Five-Year Plan,
 the volume of China's imports of industrial supplies more than doubled, led by
 steel, nonferrous metals, chemicals, and cotton. Large orders for complete
 plants and equipment began in late 1972, but deliveries did not show up in
 magnitude until 1974 and 1975. To compensate for the sharp influx of capital
 goods and an inability to expand export earnings as rapidly as needed, the
 Chinese initially cut the volume of imports of industrial supplies-hardest hit
 * From 1972 to 1975 the volume of China's grain exports more than tripled; and in 1975, the value of
 grain exports exceeded grain imports for the first time since 1960.

 suggested that prices were up sharply. If true, this would indicate another
 decline in the volume of export deliveries last year, a not unlikely
 development in light of the domestic political upheavals and natural disasters
 that occurred.

 billion on an f.o.b. basis, down from $5.8 billion in 1975-the first decline in
 the current dollar value since 1971. Limited data suggest that import prices

 The total 1976 dollar value of the commodities that were up in volume-$1.9
 billion-was more than twice that for the commodities that were down-$900
 million. These figures suggest that the decline in the real value of China's
 imports that began in 1974 may have been halted last year.
 Most of these imports went into China in the first half of 1976, however;
 second half imports were running at only 50 percent of the first half.
 D. Factors Affecting Real Trends in Trade
 For a number of reasons, the trend in China's trade since 1970 has not
 followed changes in national income or production. China's imports, for
 example, rose at a real rate of almost 25 percent per year between 1970 and
 1973, while the growth of China's GNP was averaging 7 percent. Between
 1973 and 1975, the volume of imports fell, even though domestic production
 continued to grow.
 Because of China's conservative financial policies, the real level of China's
 imports is linked through the terms of trade to the real level of exports. As
 China's commodity terms of trade change, the real level of both exports and
 imports generally changes in the same direction. The only exception was in
 1975 when the real value of exports increased rather than declined. This
 probably reflects a Chinese need to generate export earnings to settle a larger-
 than-planned trade deficit in 1974.
 Although China's exports amount to less than 3 percent of national output,
 they probably are hampered by domestic supply as well as foreign demand

 Approved For Release 2001/03/22 : CIA-RDP79B00457A000700060001-0
 constraints. The Chinese appear to move slowly in expanding supplies
 available for export in response to increased world prices. In fact, on occasion,
 the Chinese have reduced supplies in response to increased prices-if the price
 of a commodity increased significantly, earnings apparently exceeded the
 target sufficiently to divert some of the supplies that had been earmarked for
 export back into domestic use. Conversely, if the price fell, the Chinese ended
 up exporting more in order to meet their target for foreign exchange
 earnings. *
 In contrast, the Chinese have been quite flexible in their ability to alter
 import plans to take advantage of falling prices or to shift from commodities
 that are rising in price relative to other imports. The import indexes indicate a
 75-percent negative correlation between prices and quantities. Some of this
 correlation may be spurious, however, since the indexes reflect all shifts in
 demand and supply-domestic as well as foreign. For example, the Chinese
 may have bought a commodity not because its price had fallen, but because of
 a coincidental bottleneck developing in the domestic economy.
 In China, the political system sets the boundaries within which the
 economics of central planning are generally free to operate. Occasionally
 political turbulence has spilled over into the economic arena-certainly during
 the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, and the Interregnum of
 1976. Although some trade policy issues-most notably, the question of
 exporting raw materials in return for capital goods-divided China's
 leadership in the recent past, all sides agreed in principle on self-reliance and
 on China's conservative financial policies. Even though trade expanded
 rapidly from 1969 to 1973, Peking pursued a policy of import substitution,
 aimed at reducing China's reliance on foreign economies. At no time did any
 Chinese leader espouse either complete autarky or an open-door trade policy.
 In 1974, Peking-still under the guidance of Chou En-lai-cut back imports
 in order to prevent a balance-of-payment crisis. Although criticism of
 "worshipping things foreign" appeared in the PRC media at that time as part
 of the Anti-Confucius Campaign, economic factors . probably explain the
 decline in the real level of trade. In late 1975 and early 1976, Peking-by then
 * For example, from 1973 to 1974, the average price per head for China's hog exports to Hong Kong
 jumped from $43.87 to $63.58, but the Chinese cut back deliveries from 2.68 million to 2.37 million head as
 foreign exchange earnings climbed from US $118 million to $151 million. Domestic supply constraints may
 have been the reason for the cutback since the hog population in Kwangtung Province, neighboring Hong
 Kong, had remained constant in 1973 and 1974, at 14.4 million to 14.5 million head. (The hog population in
 China as a whole, however, increased from 202 million head to 231 million). Conversely, from 1974 to 1975
 the average Hong Kong price fell marginally, but the Chinese increased exports to 2.61 million head. In
 Kwangtung, the hog population had increased to 15.8 million head.

 under the leadership of Teng Hsiao-ping-stepped up purchases, and imports
 expanded. Teng's ouster and the political turmoil that followed resulted in a
 halt in many trade negotiations and a sharp decline in imports in the second
 half of 1976. With the "Gang of Four" eliminated, the current Chinese
 leadership has now called for a return to the active trade policies initiated by
 Chou. Nevertheless, China's ability to increase exports will remain a major
 constraint on the growth of imports, and a basically cautious Chinese attitude
 towards trade is likely to persist for many years.

 Appendix A
 Methodology
 This appendix contains a brief description of the procedures used to
 estimate the price indexes for China's exports and imports found in appen-
 dixes B and C, respectively, and in table 1 of the text, and a short analysis of
 the accuracy of these indexes. A more detailed explanation and a complete
 listing of the sample commodities found in tables B-3 and C-3 are available
 upon request.
 The major objective of this research was to construct price-and
 ultimately quantity-indexes for China's trade that are roughly comparable to
 the indexes of countries that publish detailed trade statistics. Index number
 practices vary from country to country with respect to prices, sampling
 procedures, weighting formulas, and construction techniques. The United
 States, Japan, and West Germany, for example, construct export and import
 price indexes from a sample of contract prices taken at the time of shipment or
 delivery.  All other countries derive unit value indexes from highly
 disaggregated trade data. Only the United States uses the chain-linked
 (moving base) Fisher formula for both the price and quantity indexes. Other
 countries use some combination of Laspeyres, Paasche, or Fisher indexes, but
 with fixed base years. Probably most construct Laspeyres quantity indexes and
 Paasche price indexes, the latter derived by dividing the appropriate indexes
 of current value by the former.
 In previous studies, rough estimates of price trends for China's trade were
 made using the price indexes of trade for "representative" market economies
 as a proxy. However, this procedure can lead to erroneous results, because (a)
 the commodities reflected in the surrogate indexes are not necessarily those
 that China trades, and (b) China's prices-both for exports and imports-may
 diverge from free market prices as a result of barter arrangements, political
 maneuvering, and certain other features of state trading. To be reliable,
 therefore, indexes for China's trade must reflect the prices and quantities of
 goods actually traded by China.

 The Construction of Indexes for PRC Trade
 In this study, unit value indexes have been derived for China's exports and
 imports from trade partner statistics. The indexes were constructed using
 current value weights (the Paasche formula) with a fixed base year. The
 availability of data dictated the methods used to construct the indexes.
 Prices and quantities for major Chinese contracts are occasionally
 published in trade reports and press articles. This information generally is not
 in a form suitable to derive price indexes, however. Indexes that are used to
 deflate trade should reflect prices at the time of shipment, since value data are
 recorded on that basis. Contract prices should be used to derive price indexes
 only if they are concurrent with the value data. To obtain price data on that
 basis entails a massive sampling effort-so far, afforded only by the United
 States, West Germany, and Japan. Unit value indexes have the advantage of
 automatically being in phase with the value data they are designed to deflate.
 Furthermore, the benefits of a much larger sample size that can be obtained
 from trade returns probably outweigh the disadvantage of using unit values as
 a proxy for prices.
 Highly disaggregated commodity data have never been compiled for
 China's trade. Although the Country-by-Commodity Series,* prepared by the
 US Department of Commerce through 1974, contains quantity and value
 information for China's trade with 30 to 40 countries, the data have been
 aggregated to approximately the four- or five-digit level of the Standard
 International Trade Classification (SITC) and are not sufficiently detailed to
 provide accurate unit values. The only alternative was to derive unit values for
 commodities from six-, seven-, and eight-digit levels of the official statistics of
 China's trade partners.
 Not all developed countries and few LDCs publish country-by-
 commodity trade data which are that detailed, however. The United
 Kingdom, for example, publishes country-by-commodity data only down to
 the five-digit level, even though the statistical office publishes much more
 detailed data on a commodity-only basis. In order to prevent China's trade
 with the developed countries from assuming inordinate weight in the price
 indexes, the trade partner statistics were sampled on a geographic basis. For
 China's exports, data were drawn from the country-by-commodity trade
 statistics of Japan, France, and Canada among the developed countries; and

 Exports to and Imports from Communist Areas in Eastern Europe and Asia, and Cuba by Free World

 from those of Hong Kong, Singapore, and the East African Customs Union
 among the LDCs. On the import side, the French statistics were dropped; and
 German, Swedish, and Moroccan data were added.
 Stratified sampling techniques were used in order to select the sample
 commodities from each country's annual trade returns. The final data set
 consisted of 528 export commodities and 192 import commodities. Examples
 of the unit value statistics derived for each of the sample commodities are in
 tables B-3 and C-3.
 The unit value indexes for the sample commodities were first aggregated
 into price indexes for two-digit SITC divisions using the current value share of
 each sample commodity in the two-digit group as a weight. The price indexes
 for the 55 export and 33 import divisions are presented in tables B-2 and C-2.
 The two-digit price indexes were then weighted by the known two-digit
 current value shares for China's trade with the non-Communist countries as a
 whole * to form aggregate price indexes for exports and imports and for
 various economic classifications of traded items. Because price trends tend to
 be more highly correlated within divisions than between divisions, the
 reweighting gives proper emphasis to price trends for various groups of
 commodities and prevents any single commodity, such as red spring wheat
 imports from Canada, from having inordinate weight in the overall price
 index. The two-digit level price indexes were assigned to the various economic
 classes as shown in table A-1. The aggregate price indexes are in tables B-1 and

 ' This system of concordances was designed specifically to
 accommodate the data that are available for China's trade, although
 it generally follows the Standard Industrial Classification for
 economic sectors and the US OBE, End-Use Commodity Categor-
 ies. Commodities within a two-digit division of the SITC generally
 are homogeneous enough to fit entirely within one of the sector and
 end-use categories. Some two-digit divisions, however, must be
 subdivided in order to distribute China's exports or imports
 properly. China's exports of tobacco, for instance, are composed of
 both raw tobacco and cigarettes. Raw tobacco (SITC t21) is
 included in the agricultural sector and as an industrial supply.
 Processed tobacco (SITC 122) is included as a product of the
 manufacturing sector and as a consumer good. Processed foodstuffs,
 which have accounted for 5 to 10 percent of total PRC exports to the
 non-Communist countries in recent years, are difficult to separate
 from other foodstuffs even at the five-digit level of the SITC and
 were, therefore, left in the agricultural sector, although they
 rightfully belong in manufacturing. Some two-digit divisions
 contained commodities such as peanut oil that serve dual purposes;
 these commodity groups were assigned arbitrarily to the most likely
 end-use category. The sector of origin and end-use categories in this
 Research Aid differ somewhat from the categories found in PRC:
 International Trade Handbook. In this paper, for example, the
 foodstuffs series includes oilseeds but excludes tobacco. Likewise,
 the series for capital goods covers hand tools and precision
 instruments in addition to machinery and transport equipment.

 are the base year and current year, respectively. This formula was reworked
 into the algebraically identical weighted average of price relatives:
 pt -    (
 )1(
 PC  Pt' qt /
 t
 t )
 t  t
 This form of the expression was used because the required data were readily
 available. The expression shows that the weight attached to each price relative
 is the current value share of each item in the sample. This is true both at the
 most disaggregated level and at the two-digit level.
 Crude oil exports and sugar and oilseed imports are not included in the
 price indexes in the appendixes. Since these three groups of commodities were
 not traded by China in every year since 1970, a separate solution was required
 in order to incorporate them into the aggregate price indexes and constant
 value series presented in the text. The procedure was the same for all three:
 quantities for the commodities were derived directly from trade partner
 statistics. Export or import prices for 1970 were estimated from market prices,
 and multiplied by the quantities to derive a constant value series in 1970
 dollars. The Paasche price indexes were then derived by dividing the current
 value of total exports or imports by the sum of the constant 1970 dollar values.
 Table A-2 presents the procedure for China's exports as an example. Tables
 A-3 and A-4 present the quantity and value information for sugar and oilseed
 imports used in estimating the constant value series and aggregate price
 indexes for China's imports.
 The Accuracy of the Indexes
 All index numbers contain at least three sources of error: (1) a formula
 error, resulting from the choice of weights used to average prices or quantities;
 (2) a sampling error, since for all practical purposes every index is based on
 sampling; and (3) a homogeneity error, resulting from the introduction of new
 goods or the elimination of old, for which comparisons of actual traded prices
 and quantities in the base and current years are not possible. If unit values are
 used as a proxy for prices, a fourth error arises.
 In using unit value indexes, it must always be explicitly recognized that
 they reflect changes both in prices and in the quality of the items traded.
 Quality changes have less effect on the indexes as commodities become more
 narrowly defined. The accuracy of a unit value index is thus a function of the

 ' The current dollar values of China's crude oil exports (2) were
 subtracted from total exports (1) for each year to obtain the value of
 non-oil exports (3). Column 3 was divided by the price index for
 PRC exports, excluding oil, taken from table B-1 to derive the 1970
 values for non-oil exports (6). A price of $1.70 per barrel was
 estimated based on the average price of Indonesia's crude oil exports
 to Japan for 1970. This price was applied to the quantity of China's
 crude oil exports for 1973 to 1975 to obtain the 1970 dollar values
 (5). Columns 6 and 5 summed to the 1970 dollar values for total
 exports (4). The aggregate export price index (7) was then derived
 by dividing column 1 by column 4.

 necessarily understated. Nevertheless, PRC imports of oilseeds have been erratic, as suggested by the above figures. No purchases are

 variance in prices of all the items subsumed within a commodity classification.
 If that variance is small, unit value indexes will accurately reflect true price
 indexes, even if composition shifts have occurred.
 At any specified level of a. trade classification system, unit values for more
 complex products appear to be less reliable than those for commodities with
 little processing. This is a particular problem in the case of the unit value
 indexes for capital goods, where a great variety of machinery may be included
 within even the most specific categories. Customs classifications generally
 were not designed for the purpose of deriving unit value indexes, however,
 and the accuracy of unit values are not always a function of the stage of
 processing. For example, PRC exports of walnuts and table salt-which might
 appear homogeneous-vary significantly in price, depending on grade.
 For comparisons over short periods of time, unit value indexes probably
 provide reasonable approximations, since market patterns remain fairly
 constant and quality shifts tend to be random and thus average out when the
 indexes for individual commodities are aggregated. Over longer periods,
 improvements in the quality of products may bias a unit value index to the
 high side.
 The Laspeyres and Paasche indexes provide a conservative estimate of the
 upper and lower bounds, respectively, of a true utility price index. * The
 Paasche price indexes in this paper, therefore, tend to underestimate the true
 increase in prices; and the constant dollar values tend to overestimate the real
 increase in quantities. For PRC exports, formula error may have amounted to
 as much as 1 percent for contiguous years and up to 5 percent for a
 comparison between 1970 and 1974. For PRC imports, formula error may
 have amounted to as much as 2 percent for contiguous years and up to 23
 percent for a comparison between 1970 and 1975.
 The downward bias of the Paasche formula, however, tends to
 compensate for any upward bias resulting from the use of unit values as a
 substitute for prices. The Paasche index thus provides more accurate results
 than if a Laspeyres index had been used to deflate trade. Furthermore, the
 Paasche price index yields easily interpretable results when used to deflate the
 current value of trade:

 The latter expression is merely the total value of current year quantities (q t) if
 those quantities had been traded at base year prices (p 0).
 Although statistics are available to measure the sampling error of index
 numbers when sampling is stratified, weighted, or without replacement, no
 formula has been devised to measure the variance of the average when all
 three techniques are used, as in this research aid; * therefore, this error was
 estimated by analyzing variances for several subsets of the overall sample. For
 China's exports, the sample size for the items in table B-3 ranged from 31
 percent to 40 percent of the value of China's non-oil exports to the non-
 Communist countries. The maximum sampling error for the export price
 index is estimated at ?15 percent. With oil included in the sample, the sample
 size increased to 46 percent in 1975 and error was reduced, perhaps to ?10
 percent. For China's imports the sample size for the items in table C-3 was
 consistently above 50 percent, and the maximum sampling error was estimat-
 ed at ?5 percent.
 Homogeneity error, resulting from unique commodities appearing or
 disappearing from trade, cannot be measured. For China's exports, this error is
 probably minor. Although the Chinese have made several claims about the
 increasing numbers of commodities available for export, many of these items
 are for exhibition purposes, and actual sales are probably small relative to
 China's traditional exports. For China's imports, however, homogeneity error
 could be large-many of China's capital goods imports are one of a kind.
 Two steps were taken to minimize homogeneity errors: first, the three
 most important groups of commodities that were not traded in each of the six
 years covered by the indexes were deflated separately. Theoretically, the base
 year price used to integrate these commodities into the price indexes and
 constant value series should have been the y-intercepts of China's export
 supply and import demand functions. Because these functions cannot be
 estimated, world market prices were used instead. This procedure (i.e., the use
 of market prices as a substitute for the y-intercept price) tends to overestimate
 the true utility price index for China's crude oil exports and to underestimate
 the true increase in prices for China's sugar and oilseed imports (for the 1970-
 based indexes). On the export side, the actual price that would have been
 sufficient to induce the Chinese to export just one unit of crude oil in 1970
 must have been somewhat higher than the world market price. Prima facie
 evidence of this is the fact that China did not export any crude oil at the going
 price of $1.70 per barrel in 1970. (Not until oil reached $4.54 per barrel did

 China export a drop). On the import side, the actual price that would have
 sufficed to induce the Chinese to import sugar, soybeans, and other oilseeds
 must have been somewhat lower than the world market price, which obviously
 the Chinese refused to pay. The degree of distortion in the export and import
 price indexes resulting from the use of market prices as a substitute for
 the y-intercept price is impossible to determine.
 Second, homogeneity errors were reduced by first constructing the
 Paasche price indexes directly from the data for commodities covered in the
 sample, and then deriving the constant value data-or quantity indexes--by
 dividing the price indexes into total value data for all commodities. This
 procedure assumes that the price trends for commodities not covered in the
 index are similar to the trends for those that are. Most countries, however,
 construct quantity indexes first (simply because it involves fewer steps), and
 then derive price indexes. An implicit assumption of this latter procedure is
 that quantity trends for commodities that are not included in the index are
 similar to the trends for those that are. Price trends probably are more highly
 correlated than quantity trends, however, both because of market imperfec-
 tions (prices, once raised, are hard to lower) and because of inflationary fiscal
 policies worldwide. For this reason, homogeneity errors can be reduced by
 constructing price indexes first.
 All errors considered, the export price indexes developed in this paper are
 probably more accurate than the import price indexes. Although sampling
 error is smaller for the import price indexes; unit value error, formula error,
 and homogeneity error are smaller for the export price indexes.
