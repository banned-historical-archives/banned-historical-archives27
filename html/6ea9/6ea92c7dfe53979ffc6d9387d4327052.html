 THE FIFTH SESSION
 OF THE
 FIRST NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS

 THE FIFTH SESSION OF THE FIRST NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS
 1 February - 11 February 1958
 I.   Int odu.ction
 On 6 January 1958, the Standing Committee of the National
 People's Congress (NPC) announced that the Fifth Session of the
 Congress would be held in Peking, beginning on 25 January.  This
 announcement was somewhat unexpected since the Fourth Session
 had been held as recently as 26 June - 15 July 1957, and normally
 a period of a year had been allowed to elapse between such meetings.
 The agenda for the Congress as announced on 6 January included
 (a) the national economic plan for 1958, (b) the examination and
 approval of the 1958 budget, and (c) the approval of the alphabetization
 of the Han language.  This agenda made it appear that important
 economic problems and decisions had required the convening of the
 Congress in advance of the norr.lal date in order to secure its formal
 approval.
 Recent events in Communist China, however, led some to won-
 der whether there was not at least one other question which, even
 though not mentioned in the announced agenda, might engage the
 attention of the Congress,  During the preceding months, a number
 of provincial congresses had been taking action to dismiss from
 party and government posts in the provinces rightist elements which
 had been identified in the course of the "blooming and contending"
 campaign.  It seemed plausible that one reason for the convening of
 the Fifth Session of the NPC might be to carry the process of punish-
 ment and ptvrging of rightists to thezational level.
 For nearly three weeks after the 6 January announcement no
 further public mention was made of the forthcoming Fifth Session.
 Then, on 24 January, a New China News Agency (NCNA) broadcast

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78'Q915R000800010015-6
 carried an announcement by the Standing Committee that a prepara-
 tory meeting for the Fifth Session of the NPC would be convened on
 25 January.      No explanation was made as to why the opening of the
 Congress itself, originally announced for the 25th, had been post-
 poned.                             Prime Minister CHOU En-lai reported the agenda for the
 Congress which included:
 (a)    A report on the execution of the 1957 budget.
 (b)    The draft of the 1958 budget.
 (c)    The draft of the 1958 national economic plan.
 (d)    The phonetic alphabet.
 (e)    A readjustment of organizations under the State
 Council.
 The addition of the fifth item to those originally announced,
 presaging some reshuffling on the national. governmental level,
 seemed to strengthen the possiblity that the Congress would take
 some action against rightists  in upper-level governmental posts.
 On 25 January, NCNA reported the preparatory meeting presided
 over by LIU Shao-chi.  PENG Chen, a vice-chairman of the Standing
 Committee, member of the Politburo and Mayor of Peking, reported
 an agenda identical with that announced by CHOU En-lai on the 24th.
 The formal opening of the Fifth Session of the NPC was scheduled
 for 1 February.  On 31 January, NCNA again announced the opening
 of the Congress on 1 February and listed an agenda which, without
 explanation, omitted the item on reorganization of organizations
 under the Slate Council.
 It is possible to speculate on the meaning of the alternate
 omission and  inclusion of this item in the agenda as indicating in-
 decision or friction within the Chinese Communist leadership over
 the cabinet shuffle which was to take place.

 Sanitized - Appred For Release : CIA-RDP78-9ua915R000800010015-6
 The Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress got
 under way, as announced, on 1 February.  On the rostrum, listed
 in this order by NCNA, were Chairman MAO Tse-tung, * Vice
 Chairman CHU Te, Chairman of the Standing Committee LIU Shao-
 chi, Prime Minister CHOU En-lai, Vice-Chairmen LI Chi-shen,
 S'TFT~T Chun-ju, KUO Mo-jo, HUANG Yen-pei, and "others".
 The formal agenda for the Congress now included a report by
 Vice-premier and Finance Minister LI Hsien-nien on the 1957 bud-
 get and the draft of the 1958 budget, a report by Vice-premier and
 chairman of the National Economic Commission PO I-po on the
 1958 .national economic plan, one by PENG Chen on the work of the
 Standing Committee and one by WU Yu-chang, Director of the Com-
 mittee for Reform of the Chinese Written Language, on the proposed
 phonetic alphabet.  Reorganization of the government was again
 omitted.
 II.   Removal of Rightists From Ministries
 Even before the Congress formally convened, the expected
 purge of rightists from upper-level government posts began.
 According to the Chinese Home Service of the Peking radio, the
 State Council on 31 January, after hearing a report from CHOU
 En-tai, voted to recommend to the Standing Committee of the NPC
 the dismissal of three non-CCP ministers who had been named in
 1957 as rightists.  The three were CHANG Po-chain, Minister of
 Communications, CHANG Nai-ch'i, Minister of Food, and LO
 Lung-chi, Minister of Timber Industry.  The radio report did not
 detail the charges against these ministers which were presumably
 part of CHOU's report, but the dismissals came as no surprise.
 These three had been among the most outspoken critics of the party
 and system in the period of "blooming and contending" during the
 first half of 1957, and had been the principal targets of the anti-
 rightist campaign thereafter.  CHANG Po-chain and LO Lung-chi
 Underlined names are those of Chinese Communist Party
 Central Committee members.

 Sanitized -Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78 -915R000800010015-6
 had, In varying degrees, repented and confessed while CHANG
 Nai-ch'i had apparently been somewhat more recalcitrant.  Their
 cases had received a maximum of attention in the Chinese press
 and over the radio, and it had generally been felt that their re-
 moval from office was only a question of time.
 The three rightist ministers, non-Communist Party members,
 had been representatives in the government of the so-called "demo-
 cratic parties", part of the facade of democracy provided by the
 Chinese Communists for their government.  CHANG Po-chain and
 LO Lung-chi were Vice-chairmen of the Central Committee of the
 China Democratic League.  CHANG Po-chain was also Chairman
 of the Central Committee of the Peasant-Worker Democratic
 Party.  CHANG Nai-ch'i was Vice-chairman of the Central Com-
 mittee of the China Democratic National Construction Association
 and Vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and
 Commerce.  The democratic parties had been targets for anti-
 rightist denunciation for their bourgeois ideology, failure to give
 wholehearted support to the building of socialism and for harboring
 rightists and counterrevolutionaries in their ranks.  In self-defense
 and as a preliminary to the removal of the three ministers from
 their government posts, the democratic parties, between the open-
 ing of the preparatory meeting on 25 January and the convening of
 the NPC on 1 February had moved to purify themselves by expelling
 from office and membership in their parties a number of rightists,
 including the three ministers.  Thus, since they no longer re-
 presented these parties, their removal from government office
 could be justified on constitutional as well as ideological grounds.
 The Standing Committee of the NPC confirmed the decision of
 the State Council and, accordingly, Chairman MAO on 31 January
 issued a formal decree dismissing the three rightists from their
 ministerial posts.
 III.  Purge of Rightist Deputies From the NPC
 The first day's session of the NPC on 1 February continued the
 purging of rightists from the organs of government.  Although six-

 Sanitized - Appoved For Release : CIA-RDP78-W915R000800010015-6
 teen elected deputies* to the Congress (including SHA Wen-han and
 YANG Ssu- i, governor and vice-governor, respectively, of
 Chekiang province until removed not long before by the provincial
 Congress) had been dismissed as rightists by the Standing Com-
 mittee prior to the opening of the NPC on the basis of a recommen-
 dation by the Fourth Session, a number of rightists still held valid
 credentials as deputies.** One of the first acts of the NPC was to
 reject these credentials for thirty-eight rightist deputies.  They
 were charged with having "betrayed the fundamental principles of
 the Constitution by their anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-
 socialist positions and attitudes. "
 Of the thirty-eight rejected deputies, in addition to CHANG Po-
 chtin, CHANG Nat-ch'i and LO Lung-chi, ten were also removed
 from offices at higher levels.  Removed as members of the Stand-
 ing Committee were HUANG Shao-hung, LUNG Ytin and CH'EN Ming-
 shu; from the Nationalities Committee, FEl Hsiao-t'ung, HUANG
 Hs.ten-fang, and OU Pai-ch'uan; and from the Bills Committee,
 G.HANG Ytin-ch'uan, HUANG Shao-hung, HUANG Chi--hsiang,
 HSIEH Hstieh-hung and LO Lung-chi.  Two members of this com-
 mittee had also been among the sixteen deputies dismissed by the
 Standing Committee before the op,e'ning of the Congress.  LUNG
 Ytin and HUANG Ch'i-hsiang were also removed from the National
 Defense Council.  The latter two had shortly before been dis-
 missed from their offices and membership in the Kuomintang
 Revolutionary Committee, one of the "democratic parties".
 Most of the remainder of the thirty-eight, as well as of the six-
 teen dismissed in advance, seem to be individuals of lesser im-
 portance about whom little is known.
 There has been speculation as to a relati. nship between this
 purge of the government organs of the Chinese Peoplels Republic
 For these names and other groups removed from office by the
 NPC, see Appendix.
 **   There is no evidence as to whether any of these were in
 physical attendance at the Congress.

 (CPR) and a possible internal conflict within the Chinese Communist
 leadership.  However, so little information is available either about
 the purged individuals (with the exception of a few top figures) or
 about any such internal conflict that no conclusions along these lines
 can be drawn.  There seems to be no reason to assume at present
 that this purge is anything more than appears on the surface--an
 elimination of rightist elements identified in the course of the
 cheng feng campaign.
 Only four of the purged deputies have been identified as Com-
 munist party members and most of the rest about whom anything is
 known were members or officers of the democratic parties, in-
 cluding the CDL, the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic
 Party, the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, the AU-China
 Federation of Industry and Commerce Associations,/ tie Chiu San
 Society.  It is possible that besides the punishment and elimination
 of individual rightists, the purge is also intended as an attack upon
 the democratic parties themselves.  The example made of these
 leaders will discourage the remaining elements of the parties from
 exhibiting any rightist tendencies in the future and at the same time
 the parties have been deprived of their most independent-minded
 leaders and those with sufficient courage to voice their criticisms.
 The Communist regime may well feel that this punishment of
 rightist democratic party elements will ensure arn'irr.imum of trouble
 from these parties in the future.  The intention of the CCP to make
 the democratic parties completely reliable agencies for control of
 non-Party elements is further indicated by the frequent warnings
 given by Communist Party leaders that the democratic parties still
 retain many bourgeois characteristics and that their only future lies
 in thorough socialist re-education, wholehearted support of socialist
 construction, and acceptance of the leading role of the Communist
 Party.  The implication is present that should the democratic parties
 fail to heed these warnings, the regime might decide to dispense
 with the democratic parties altogether.
 The analysis of the backgrounds of the purged deputies, besides
 indicating an attack upon the democratic parties, also proves once

 Sanitized - Appred For Release : CIA-RDP78-Oil''915R000800010015-6
 more how completely insecure is the position in the Communist
 regime of individuals with a background of Western associations or
 former KMT membership.  The regime uses such persons for the
 sake of their skills and knowledge or for their prestige value, but
 never really trusts them and they must walk always in the shadow
 of the fear fliat at any moment, at any whim of the party leader's7iip,
 their past associat ions may be brought up against them.
 The future      of the purged ri,htists is not clear.  The re-
 gime apparently prefers to avoid the bloody type of purge associated
 with Stalinism although it will not hesitate to use more drastic
 measures if necessary.  It is likely that many of the exposed
 rightists will be included in the transfer of intellectuals and bips must come first.  Then the future of
 Korea should be determined by free nationwide elections held under
 the sr-pervision of an organization of neutral nation,,- (not the UN).
 This ..s the first official statement from the Chinese Communists
 of support for neutral super  is ion of elections in Korea, even
 though it would probably be discovered in the imp! :::-rentation of
 this proposal that their concept of "i.   .trals" in this c_ntext would
 be quite different from that of non-C rnmunist nations.
 To facilitate such a solution, CHOU continued, the Chinese
 People's Republic was prepared to discuss with the North Korean
 government the withdrawal of the People's Volunteers from Korea.
 It has, of course, since been announced by the CPR that this
 unilateral withdrawal will be completed by the end of 1958.

 Sanitized Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-  915R000800010015-6
 He urged that the United States and the United Nations do likewise,
 but did not make Chinese withdrawal contingent upon this.
 Then CHOU turned to the question of relations between Com-
 munist China and the United States.  After referring to the pro-
 tracted ambassadorial talks which have been going on and blaming
 their failure on the US insistence upon recognition of the status
 quo for Taiwan, he proceeded to consider further the question of
 Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek government.  The importance
 which the Chinese Communists place on this question is indicated
 by the fact that CHOU devoted approximately one-fourth of his whole
 report to the subject.  He reviewed the attempts of the United States
 to promote the "two-China" concept--the Eleventh Olympic Games,
 the meeting of the Special Committee on the International Geo-
 physical Year, the International Red Cross Conference
 O::.tober 1957, etc.    He criticized both the British and the Japanese
 for the support which he alleged they have given to the two-China
 concept.  He reiterated again and again in the strongest terms the
 determination of Communist China never to accept the idea of two
 Chinas.  In closing, he made it plain that Communist China was not
 interested in any deal exchanging US recognition of the Communist
 regime for Communist acceptance of the two-China idea.
 VI.  Other Reports to the NPC
 On 3 February, the NPC heard reports from Finance Minister
 LI Hsien-nien on the budget and from Chairman of the National
 Economic Commission PO I-po on the National Economic Plan for
 1958.  It is not the purpose of this paper to attempt any sort of an
 analysis of the Chinese Communist economy based upon these
 reports.  The generalized figures and statistics provided would
 not lend themselves to such an analysis in any case.  However,
 there are a few implications in these reports which should be
 mentioned.
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000800010015-6
 Sanitized - App  ved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R000800010015-6
 None of the economic problems which Communist China is
 believed to be currently facing--such as lagging agricultural pro-
 duction, largescale movement of peasants to the cities with con-
 sequent manpower shortages on the land, shortage of consumer
 goods, particularly food-grains and cotton cloth, etc. --were ad-
 mitted or dealt with in these economic and fiscal reports.  LI
 Hsien-nien did admit that in the winter of 1956 there had been some
 overspending on capital construction.  Of course, the Central
 Committee and MAO Tse-tung had corrected this error, The very
 general figures given in the draft budget for 1958 indicate that while
 a slight increase is planned for capital investment in agriculture,
 the principal emphasis will still be placed upon heavy industry.
 The total budget represents an increase of approximately three
 billion yuan over 1957.
 PO I-pots report also acknowledged the role of assistance
 from "the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries" in the accom-
 plishment of the first five-year plan and assured the Congress that
 "generous help" would continue to be forthcoming from the same
 sources.  However, there is also throughout the report, as in other
 reports and speeches, a strong emphasis upon "practice economy
 and oppose waste", and repeated admonitions that only extreme
 frugality can make possible the fulfillment of the plan.  The budget
 for 1958, as reported by LI Hsien-nien, does not include any figures
 for foreign aid in its tabulation of expected revenue, although such
 aid may be hidden in receipts from "foreign trade", "loans", or
 "other sources".  Similarly, on the expenditure side no specific
 figure for repayment of foreign loans is given, although the total
 for repayment of loans of all kinds is 3. 12 percent of the total
 budget, an increase of 123. 01 percent over the 1957 figure.
 In this connection it is interesting to compare the silence of
 the budget on foreign aid and the emphasis throughout the Congress
 on preventing waste with a Peking Daily editorial published on 2
 February.  The paper was explaining why there were not sufficient
 funds available for all development projects, thus necessitating the
 practice of economy and the prevention of waste.  It pointed out that

 China had received loans in the past from the Soviet Union and other
 fraternal countries but that those countries needed funds themselves
 for their own construction and, therefore, China could not one-
 sidedly rely on them to help her.  In the future "... dependence
 should be placed on the 600 million people of our country for the
 accumulation of every cent" (emphasis added).
 In the light of statements such as these, it is possible to question
 whether PO I-po's statement about "generous help" in the 1958 plan
 was entirely candid.
 B.  Rectification
 The progress of the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist
 movement was not part of the agenda of the N.PC.  Perhaps it was
 felt that the report on the cheng feng movement delivered by TENG
 H.siao-p'ing to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the
 CCP on 23 September 1957 had adequately dealt with this question.
 Nevertheless, most of the speakers found it desirable to in-
 clude a reference to rectification in their remarks.  CI 9U's report
 on foreign affairs began with a tribute to the campaign/having "infused
 an unprecedented new spirit" into the Chinese people.  PO I-po credited
 rectification with having won "great victories on the political and
 ideological fronts" which in turn "spurred on victory on the economic
 front".  The rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle,
 he went on, "constitute a socialist revolution on the political and
 ideological fronts and a continuation of the socialist revolution that
 took place in 1955-56 on the economic front. "  PO also laid emphasis
 on the importance of practicing economy and opposing waste if eco-
 nomic goals were to be met.
 Such references to the success of rectification and anti-rightism
 could be multiplied from the speeches of the deputies at the NPC who
 seemed to feel that their own ideological purity required such state-
 ments crediting the campaigns with the successes and achievements
 in all fields.

 One aspect of rectification, the transfer of something like a
 million cadres, bureaucrats, students and intellectuals back to
 the land for physical labor, received little attention at the Congress.
 An occasional deputy supported the policy in a speech, but no
 important leader made any significant statement on this problem.
 C.  Minorities
 The principal statement on this question was made by WANG
 Feng, vice-chairman of the Commission of. Nationalities Affairs.
 His report to the Congress discussed the question of localism as
 a barrier to national unity and a hindrance to strengthening "the
 socialist system and leadership of the party in the: national minority
 areas. "   He associated localism with rightism, saying "advocates
 of localism are bourgeois rightists under the cloak of nationalism.
 The contradictions between us are contradictions between friend
 and foe. " Chinese Communist policy towards the minorities was
 clearly stated by WANG  "The Chinese Communist Party is the
 nucleus of leadership in the building of socialism in our country
 and the true representative and protector of the interests of our
 various nationalities.  All nationalities must sincerely and truly
 uphold the leadership of the Party. "
 Speeches were also made by a number of deputies from minority
 areas, but their remarks were largely confined to describing how
 fine everything is in their areas, how happy the people are, and
 the great things they are achieving under the leadership of the Com-
 munist Party.
 There were implications for the minorities in the approval by
 the NPC of the proposal for a new alphabet for the written Chinese
 language.  This proposal was undoubtedly motivated by the necessity
 for a simpler system of writing to facilitate the elimination of il-
 literacy, both among the minorities and the mass of the Chinese
 themselves.  However, the imposition of written Chinese on the
 minorities instead of the development of a written form of their own
 tongue might be regarded as a step towards assimilation of the

 minorities.  That such suspicions did actually exist is indicated by
 the fact that WU Yu-chang, Director of the Committee for the Re-
 form of the Chinese Written. Language, reporting to the Congress
 on the proposal, found it necessary, after pointing out that since
 the nation had realized national unity, it required a common
 language, to reiterate that "promotion of the common language
 should not and will not limit the right of the various nationalities
 to use and develop their own languages. "  Whether such state-
 ments will actually allay such suspicions among the minorities
 is something which is open to doubt.
