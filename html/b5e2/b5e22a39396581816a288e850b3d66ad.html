 Tung Chi-ping (above) is the
 first Chinese defector to have
 been raised and educated under
 communism. He schemed seven
 years for freedom, finally seized
 it in Central Africa with a five-
 minute taxicab ride. Now learning
 English here, he hopes to
 continue his education at an
 American university.'
 By TUNG CHI-PING as told to QUENTIN REYNOLDS
 HY DID I defect? Why,
 on May 26, 1964, did I
 give up a coveted career
 as a Red Chinese diplo-
 mat in Central Africa
 for a future of uncer-
 tainty? The official pro-
 test by the Red China Embassy to Burundi
 claimed that I was "kidnapped and held by
 members of the United States Embassy in
 Burundi." The news of my "kidnapping" was
 also carried by the Shanghai and Peking
 newspapers. They lied.
 1 am telling the true story now in the
 hope that it will reach my family in China.
 I arrived in Bujumbura, the capital of
 Burundi, on May 25, 1964, to take up my
 duties as assistant cultural attache of the Chi-
 nese Communist Embassy. Eighteen hours
 later, I walked into the United States Em-
 bassy and pleaded for political asylum. Now,
 I am in the United States. For seven long
 years, I had dreamed of this, and everything
 I had done back in Shanghai and Peking was
 directed toward this end.
 I have been in this new country of mine
 almost four months, and if I am warmed by
 'the friendship of many Americans, I am just
 as often bewildered because so few of those I
 meet seem to realize the enormous threat Red
 China poses to the new African nations. Most
 people concentrate on the Chinese Commu-
 nist threat to Southeast Asia. There i4 a, say..
 ing in Peking and in the Communist diplo-
 matic world that Mao Tse-tung can take over
 Southeast Asia any time he wishes by making
 six phone calls. Mao is wasting little money
 and little propaganda in that part of the
 Africa today has the highest priority,
 and that is why I, a very junior 21-year-old
 diplomat, was sent to Burundi, where the
 official language is French. The most impor-
 tant part of my seven-year program to get
 out of China was to master the French lan-
 guage. Very few Red Chinese diplomats
 speak any language but their own, and I felt
 .that, once I knew French, I might be sent
 abroad at least as an interpreter.
 Not many Americans to whom I have
 spoken have ever heard of little Burundi.
 Geographically, it lies between the Congo
 Basin and East Africa, and because it is the
 gateway to the Congo, this small, hilly, under-
 developed, overpopulated nation is impor-
 tant in Mao's long-range plan to dominate as
 much of Africa as be can. Before I was sent
 to Burundi, I had been thoroughly briefed
 on the progress being made there and. the
 plans for the future. Again and again, my
 superiors repeated Mao Tse-tung's statement:
 "When we capture the Congo, we can pro-
 ceed to capture the whole of Africa. Burundi
 is the stepping-stone for reaching the Congo."
 Months earlier, the plan to take over
 Burundi had been put into operation by Kao
 Liang, whose credentials identified him as a
 reporter for the New China News Agency.
 He was, in fact, an experienced agent who
 had formerly been active in India. He inter-
 viewed government officials in Burundi and
 was careful to mention the many advantages
 that would accrue to Burundi if it were to es-
 tablish friendly relations with Red China.
 This is the standard beginning for Red Chi-
 nese infiltration of a new state.
 Kao Liang, persuasive and skillful, had

 Once a week, we all had to write a confession
 detailing even the slightest acts, words or thoughts
 we had had that might be construed as critical of
 communism. I made my reports as bland as pos-
 sible, but then I was criticized for not being frank.
 F inal:ly, I thought of something that might satisfy
 the l.caf.ue without involving me in serious trouble.

 that we were the most circumspect scholars in the
 world. Desire is not an emotion that flourishes
 under fear. This campaign against overpopulation
 worked fairly well in the cities, but 80 percent of
 China is rural, and in the country, the kind of dis-
 cipline enforced in Shanghai was impossible to
 invoke. The sons and daughters of farmers, whether
 married or not, ignored what they felt to be absurd
 restrictions against a normal way of life.
 In Shanghai, rape and seduction were coat id-
 ered serious offenses, unless the act was cornmitie 1
 by a visiting African. We all heard the story 14 an
 exchange student from Somaliland who had se-

 found, even our dreams. I was reported for talking
 in my sleep and for saying things that could be con-
 strued as criticism of the party. Shortly after this,
 I made a second application for membership in the
 League, hut again was rejected.
 I had little life outside my studies, and I didn't
 care for any. As I learned more and more French,
 my determination to get out of China was intensi-
 fied. Occasionally, I was able to, find a book, a
 newspaper or a pamphlet in French, and I de-
 voured these as greedily as I devoured the corn
 husks, sweet potatoes and occasional spoonful of
 rice we were given for dinner. I learned a little,
 but not much, about the outside world. I learned
 something about the United States from our daily
 newspapers, which were, of course, constantly
 vilifying that country. I began to long to go to
 America for the very reasons for which it was
 being criticized. By now, I felt that anything that
 Mao Tse-tung hated must be good.
 Life in Shanghai had changed considerably
 from the time my father was a young man. In those
 far-off days, every man yearned for a big family.

 whole thing. But because the seven girls had. done
 some talking, the story became public property.
 I asked a classmate why the Somali student
 had not been punished. "Don't you know?" he
 laughed. "All Africans must be treated with kid
 gloves. Our leader has great plans for Africa, and
 nothing must be done to hurt the feelings of any
 African." It was the first inkling I had that Africa
 was to be Mao's No. 1 target.
 During my last year at the Institute, I was
 becoming more conscious than ever of the loss of
 dignity every citizen suffered under communism.
 Reports coming to Shanghai from the rural dis-
 tricts emphasized this fact. Ancestor worship has
 always been part of the Chinese philosophy. Per-
 haps "ancestor worship" is too dramatic a term.
 Chinese children, nevertheless, have always been
 brought up to respect their parents, their grand-
 parents and, for that matter, their great-grand-
 parents. Now, small groups of Peking agricultural
 experts were going from village to village asking
 for volunteers to dig up the ancient graveyards,

 unrest in Red China and that it is only a matter of
 time until the people rise up and overthrow Mao
 T, e.-tong and his regime. But if I said that, it would
 be just wishful thinking. There is unhappiness, un-
 rest and discouragement among the people, but
 there is apathy too. Mao is not quite the revered
 war hero that he was a few years ago. Millions hope
 that he will be replaced eventually by someone less
 stern, less attached. to the inflexible dogma of com-
 munism. Their hopes rise no higher than this.
 I know that many of my former classmates at
 the Institute envy me because I managed to break
 away, but I know, too, that they will never do any-
 thing to jeopardize the small but relatively safe
 sinecures their graduation from the Institute af-
 forded them. I know that there have been anti-
 Communist cliques at various universities, but I
 know, too, that they have always been infiltrated by
 Young Communist League agents, reported to the
 authorities and their members set to work on
 farms. Thousands of intellectuals feel sullen re-
 sentn-tent toward a system that does not allow then
 to fully realize their intellectual potential, but there
 is nothing they can do to change conditions.
 Many people in the United States have great
 hopes that Chiang Kai-shek will eventually land an
 army on the mainland. If he ever does, millions
 will ask in bewilderment, "Who is Chiang Kai-,
 shek?" Because of strict censorship by the Peking
 government., it is seldom that one sees his name.
 Mainland Chinese who remember Chiang view him
 now as the puppet ruler of Taiwan, an armed
 American colony. And they are told that when
 Chiang acts, the Americans pull the strings.
 There are no "graduations" in China
 But let me return to my story. When I finished
 my four years at the Shanghai Institute, I applied
 for permission to join the Commission for Cultural
 Exchange in Peking. Incidentally, there is no such
 thing as a "graduation ceremony" from a univer-
 sity; that is considered a bourgeois affectation.
 Upon completion of your studies, you are sent to
 work on the farms for, one year, and I fully ex-
 pected that this would be my fate. I still hadn't
 been allowed to join the Young Communist League,
 and as a rule, only its members were given prefer-
 ential treatment and government jobs.
 To my amazement, I was accepted by theCom-
 nr,ission for Cultural Exchange. I had nothing but
 my good record in French to recommend me, but
 when I reached Peking, I discovered there were
 very few in the Cultural Commission who spoke
 French. My job was to act as interpreter at various
 international meetings. This wasn't very challeng-
 ing work, but it did,enable me to meet a great many
 foreigners, to learn more about the world outside
 China, and it improved my French.
 Then, the opportunity unexpectedly arrived.
 I was selected to go to Burundi with the diplomatic
 rank of assistant cultural attache. My new supe-
 rior, Shen Chun, was the cultural attache at our
 Embassy there. A careful, balding party member
 in his m*Wlaff~sd~lyiatr~

 "experts" on Africa, I went on a furlough to see
 my family in Shanghai. The farewell I bade then,
 was more final than they realized.
 Back in Peking, I took my clothing allowance,
 about $400, and bought myself sonic suits, shirts,
 a couple of pairs of shoes and a suitcase. I tucked
 away five pounds of sterling, about $14, for even-
 tual escape funds. On May 19, Shen Chun and I
 flew from Peking to Canton on a government plane.
 In Canton, we boarded an Air Pakistan air-
 liner bound for Karachi. We had to wait two days
 there for a connecting flight. Shen remained by my
 side, and I 'worried that I might give myself away
 by talking in my sleep. I had thought about Ilefect-
 ing in Karachi, but I spoke no English, and was
 afraid that no one there would speak French. So I
 decided to wait and see just how far away from
 Red China I could get.
 From Karachi, we flew to Aden, Nairobi and
 then Kampala, in Uganda, close to Burundi. As the
 miles from my homeland multiplied, I became
 more and more preoccupied with escape. I won-
 dered if my companion, Shen, was becoming sus-
 picious of my silence, and tried to chat about trivial
 things, like the weather. I even debated asking; him
 to defect along with me.
 We landed in Bujumbura on May 25. I had
 half-hoped to make a break at the airport, but one
 of our diplomats was there to escot't us to the Em-
 bassy's temporary headquarters in a wing of the
 Paguidas-Haidemenos Hotel. I kept watching for
 the right moment to escape.
 It came early the next morning. I awoke about
 6 a.m, and found Shen already gone from our
 room. I put on a shirt, trousers and bedroom
 slippers to look as casual as possible, and took an
 elevator to the lobby. Across the street, I could see
 a taxi stand. I went to our private dining room and
 gulped down breakfast. The others were still eat-
 ing as I got up to leave. I sauntered out of the hotel
 and crossed the street. No one seemed to be watch-
 ing. I jumped into a taxi and told the driver to rush
 me to the American Embassy. I had learned my
 French well, for he understood. We drove through
 Bujumbura, still cool in the quiet morning. The
 American Embassy was only five minutes away.
 I got out of the taxi and looked at the stone
 building where all my hopes would culminate. Still
 wearing bedroom slippers, I shuffled in to the sur-

 BY T GEORGE HARRIS
 MAO TSE-TUNG, poet-dictator of the biggest nation I:
 -in history, looks, to some like a stupid peasant in
 a morality play. With''evil pride, while his family
 starves, he buys an expensive firecracker to im-
 press the neighbors. In this make-believe, you don't
 wonder what Mao can, in fact, do with his bomb.
 He may have plans. But the leaders and press'
 of the Western world., responsible men, have taken
 pains to prevent public panic over the new menace. 1,
 We hear their reassurances before we hear the
 worries that prompt them. The thin Red economy,
 we are told, will need several hard years-any-
 where, estimates say, from five to twenty-five-to I
 build nuclear-armed ICBM's to threaten us.
 Whatever comfort this calendar offers, it im-
 plies a harsh reality that has to be faced : The nu-
 clear thunder out of China announced a newly
 formidable foe among nations. A hungry giant has
 grasped the science and technology of modern
 power. In the rush to explain China's weaknesses,
 Most reports have, in our "be calm" mood, j
 wildly understated Chinese advance and ambition.
 Diplomats tend to declare that China's main use of
 the bomb will be as a status symbol in Southeast
 Asia. But China's imperialistic ambitions reach
 far beyond Asia-into troubled Africa.     ;
 Never mind, one diplomat told me, the Afri-
 cans are superstitious about radioactive damage to
 their manhood. As dedicated bomb-banners, he i
 said, they will hold the Chinese responsible.
 Even the military menace has been giver.-the
 once-over-lightly in public. Though the Chinese
 is
 announced an "atom bomb," U.S. experts first put
 it down as a rudimentary test "device" made of
 plutonium. The implication: China could not yet
 produce fuel enough for more than a blast or two,
 had not built the ordnance to make its device port-
 able. The fallout proved to be from a bomb as
 advanced as our Hiroshima "Lean Boy." More
 surprises may follow. In 1959, when the Chinese
 went all-out for the bomb, they knew what they
 needed. They also knew their bomb would never
 be considered a weapon, even for defense, if they
 did not develop a way to transport it to a target.
 So? Key scientists who study atomic-intelli-
 gence think the Chinese started on these lesser jobs
 years ago--and are now very close to a workable
 weapons system. "It's too dange.rous," says a care-
 ful strategist, "to assume otherwise."
 Obviously, they are years behind the U.S.
 in ICBM's, but this smug comparison leaves out
 something. They do not need ICBM's to put a bomb
 on Taiwan, or South Vietnam, or India-or, as the
 Russians know, Outer Mongolia. They can threaten
 their neighbors, already under pressure, with crude
 rockets (they have a U.S.-trained specialist) or re-
 built IL-28 bombers (Russian-contributed),
 Mao Tse-tung, who acts with more caution.
 than he talks, may only rattle his atoms. He would
 be hard put to find an A-bomb target that would
 not trigger H-bomb retaliation. Our policy-makers
 automatically assume that any attack upon a non-
 Communist nation requires us to destroy all of
 China's nuclear machinery bypush-button missiles.

 hardly foolproof. "Our superiority is overwhelm-
 ing, and we will make it damn clear to the Chi-
 nese," says a policy-maker. Then he goes on to his
 deeper worry. "They are the first nation to have,
 this power that is not concerned about what hap-
 pens to its people." Elderly Mao, he knows, may
 .one day be replaced by a less cautious man.
 In this context, possession'of atomic potential
 ended the era when China was only a regional
 power. On his way to the bomb, Mao knocked out
 the No. One Russian, Nikita Khrushchev, and took '
 over as chief Communist. Counterpressures against
 him lost force. He need no longer even be fretted.
 by Chiang Kai-shek's faded dream of reconquest.
 Red China has become the major menace to a
 nervous world. The West has its hands full.
 Behind such military and diplomatic results,
 already visible, stands the scientific and techno-
 . logical cause. China's atomic explosion cannot be
 treated, though some try, as an isolated achieve-
 ment of an otherwise primitive society. We made
 that mistake once before. After Russia first tested
 an atomic device in September of 1949, the U.S.
 foolishly underestimated its expanding potential.
 We wasted years on internal wrangles over
 whom to blame. You remember the big debate at
 home: How had our atom secrets fallen into enemy
 hands? But for traitors, many were persuaded, the
 backward Russians would never have produced
 A-bombs or H-bombs. Scientists argued with the
 witch-hunters, but shared their mistaken estimate
 of Russian technology. The bomb, many felt, was
 a one-shot act put on at great cost by a country that
 could do little more for years. Experts explained
 that the Soviets had no "broad base of secondary
 scientific and technological resources." They talked
 as they now talk about China.
 Only a few men saw the deeper error. Dr.
 M. H. Trytten, director of scientific manpower for
 the National Academy of Sciences, worried over a
 remark he had heard all too often from free-world
 researchers who watched their Russian counter-
 parts. "I know the Russians can't be doing much
 along other lines," each would tell him, "but in my
 part of science, they're moving up fast." Trytten,
 a methodical Minnesotan, compiled an index of
 specifics. Be organized Library of Congress and
 CI.A teams to study Soviet publications.
 As his evidence confirmed his worst fears,
 Trytten ran into widely held and complacent myths.
 Many scientists, devoted to free inquiry, could not
 accept the idea that science could make general, if
 uneven, progress, under a dictatorship. Science
 writers shared the dogma. Without public warn-
 ings from the press, Government officials were
 slow to consider Trytten's evidence on its merit.
 I happened to know Dr. Trytten. during those
 years-1952 and 1953-when he first tried to sound
 the alarm. "He was like a man who saw his house...-.-
 afire, but could not rouse the fire department. Ile
 eventually persuaded President Eisenhower's Na-
 tional Security Council to read his report on Rus-
 si a's massive training for scientists and technicians.
 But the U.S., which depends upon the spon-
 ntiI the .
 next shock. In 1957, we looked up to see Sputnik I
 and dog-toting Sputnik II soaring across our skies.
 Then the missile race turned serious, and, more to
 the point, we sensed the total challenge to our tech-
 nological supremacy-dangerously late.
 The. recent Chinese blast sent me back to
 Trytten, who still advises the Government on sci-
 ence. Surely, I said, we aren't back in the same
 situation. "Well," he answered mildly, "I have
 thought so for quite a while. It is much harder to
 get reports on what the Chinese are doing than it
 was on the Russians. But we know some of it. In
 one area, micromolecules and cell biology, we sus-
 pect that they may become world leaders."
 Behind the bamboo curtain, it now appears,
 the Chinese technological drive overrides all other
 considerations, except, perhaps, Mao's yen for sus-
 picion and tyranny. The West had its first informed
 peep in the late 1950's when Canadian geophysi.
 cist J. Tuzo Wilson was allowed to visit research
 centers. In Peking, he found efficient new labs for
 100,000 teachers and students. He rode new rail-
 roads over the interior plains to a vast new re-
 search complex in Lanchow. This center, special-
 izing in physics, probably supervised the recent
 nuclear test' The technology poured into the bomb
 represents major resources brought into use in
 spite of economic disasters.
 Why? A fanatic lust for technology has been
 a standard trait of communism. In Russia during
 the Battle of Leningrad, when old women dug
 trenches in the bitter cold, healthy young men
 never missed a day's study at the technical insti-
 tute. In China, the Marxist adoration of science is^
 compounded by a specific national experience.
 The ancient Chinese intellectual tradition, which
 produced gunpowder, turned decadent and lost
 out to the science-minded vigor of the West. This
 historic loss of face may explain why Americans
 of Chinese descent feel deeply about the sciences
 and contribute far more than their share to U.S.
 scientific advance. They fill about 2,000 key-re-
 search and teaching jobs. In Red China, where the
 hate of "foreign devils" survives in daily "kill
 Americans" ritual, dictator Mao uses the built-up
 anger of the centuries to justify investing in tech-
 nology while millions go hungry. Even in a crude
 and wasteful economic system, the monster effort is
 apt to pay off better than it did for the Russians.
 Said Tuzo Wilson: "The science in this wild
 and frenziedly growing outpost of Asia. is, though
 limited by [lack of trained] manpower, unques-
 tionably up-to-date both in technology and theory."
 Mao Tse-tung's passion for nuclear power
 was the decisive factor in recent Communist his-
 tory and in Khrushchev's rise and fall. On the way
 .up, Khrushchev moved to solidify his satellite em-
 pire by mollifying its most independent element.
 ,He?gave China, on October 15, 1957, a treaty
 'promising economic 'assistance and nuclear re-
 sources. Capital goods, and technicians poured
 across the border, in two years completed 200 eco-

 aluagrnirc." Khrushchev called them "madmen."
 The West listened with understandable self-interest
 to tftc argument's main theme. Not often do we
 hear tvon monster nations in formal debate over
 whether. for the sake of ideological purity, they
 mutt jointly abolish the rest of us with nuclear
 weapomc. No comparable dialogue has been re-
 ported since ancient Greece, where, according to
 'rhucydides, the Melians failed to persuade the
 ;Athenians, by logic, not to enslave or kill them.
 By this fall, the Red Chinese seemed, like the
 Athenians, to be winning on points. Khrushchev
 called this December's international meeting of
 .Communist leaders from 26 countries. His purpose:
 to ban madmen from the Soviet bloc. But he found
 lie did not have the votes. Many other Communist
 groups, while not eager for nuclear war, objected .
 to the spin-off of China, The monolithic unity of
 the Soviet empire was whirling into "polycen-
 trism." To avoid total Russian embarrassment,
 Khrushchev's hand-picked subordinates pushed
 old Nick aside-only hours before Mao's bomb
 went off near the Russian border.
 Since then, the Communists have sweated
 over new alignments. Most Sovietologists believe
 Russia and China will try to heal their split, but
 fail. If the bear and the dragon wrestle on E:he In i ok
 of nuclear war, no human can sleep safely.
 For the free world, Red China's new power
 and ambition can only be a menace. But, as Rcrssia
 found, such ambition brings new discipline,:md i he
 beginnings of restraint. China's heavy trade with
 Japan is jeopardized by fallout. China's infiltra-
 tion project in Africa would be blown to bits by
 further atomic explosions. Aware of the stakes,
 Mao accompanied his boast of his bomb with a,
 pledge "never at any.time and under any circum-
 stances to be the first to use nuclear weapons."
 To force him to keep that promise will be the
 business of U.S. policy. The job demands, as Lyn-
 good sense." Our ultimate weapon, the loyalty and
 initiative of free men, is blocked off by China's
 total isolation. We must break through. The dragon,
 now growing nuclear teeth, cannot be left to hide
 behind its bamboo curtain. The close,in struggle
 with Russia has proved that, while we cannot end
 the Communists' drive to rule the world, we can
 make each piece of it too costly for them to try to
 take. In time, the war urge of the Chinese may be
 turned, like that of the Russians, toward scientific
 and economic competition for the respect of the
 nations caught between them and us.       END.
