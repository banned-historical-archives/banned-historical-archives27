 Editorial
 WE did not invent  a  new  name for
 YY  ourselves. We have proudly adopted
 the title of one of the world famous books by
 Rajani Palme Dutt, which has helped to educate
 progressive democrats the world over on the
 role of British Imperialism in our country
 and the strength and weakness of our national
 movement,  and which  is reverently used
 as a text-book by the Indian Lefts to under-
 stand the past of our movement and the tasks
 ahead of ,the unfinished Indian Revolution.
 Our honest endeavour will be to carry
 forward, from month to month, the scientific
 analysis of the Indian problems based on the
 principles of Marxism-Leninism, which R.P.
 Dutt has brilliantly formulated for our whole
 modern epoch. Against the current wave of
 frustration, we need the faith of the Russian
 Bolsheviks.  Were their difficulties less? Len-
 in's comrades-in-arms derived their undying
 faith  from their revolutionary  ideology,
 Marxism.  Against  the  growing cancer of
 cynicism we need the patience of the Chinese
 Communists.   Mao Tse-tung's comrades-in-
 arms could tirelessly struggle for 30 long years
 because they used the Marxist-Leninist theory
 to understand the complicated problems of
 their liberation  struggle  and  experience
 taught them that the more successfully they
 could wield their  ideological weapon, the
 mare effectively would they be able to lead
 their revolutionary struggle to victory.
 We shall apply Marxism to Indian reality
 For most patriotic Indians the post-15th
 August India has  been all  topsy-turvy.
 The conditions of life that they  expected
 to change for the better have worsened and
 men  they expected  to  rise higher have
 fallen lower than they imagined possible.
 Traditional ideas fail to explain the present
 tragedy.  Yet we must understand it if we
 are to grapple with it.
 The path forward before the Indian movement
 can never be blazoned unless the Indian Communists
 learn to apply the universal,truth of Marxism-
 Leninism to the Indian reality.
 The  broken  hearts  of Indian  patriots
 cannot revive with new hope unless their
 own loyal  service of our   suffering people
 leads them on to study the experience of the

 vast lands stretching from  the Pacific to
 the  Elbe, where  nations   have  become
 truly independent, where people are really
 masters of their destiny, where truth triumphs
 and hope lives, where poverty is being liqui-
 dated and culture nursed.
 INDIA TO DAY will not be a highbrow,
 so-called "theoretical" journal.  It will truth-
 fully mirror the sufferings of the people and
 formulate their pressing demands. It will carry
 contributions from the leaders of the Trade
 Unions, the  Kisan Sabhas,       the  Students'
 organisations, and various democratic political
 organisations on the problems of rebuilding
 and uniting their disrupted and      suppressed
 organisations.
 For a new Democratic Front
 Progressive intellecutals and advanced ele-
 ments inside every democratic party and group
 have come to realise that after the betrayal
 of their pledges by the leaders of the Congress,
 the National Congress can no more function
 as the United National Front  serving the
 needs of the people, that a new  Democratic
 Front uniting all the truly patriotic forces of the
 country must be formed outside the National Congress
 and against the Government manned and run by
 its leaders.
 The leaders of the Congress have compro-
 mised with the British Imperialism symbolised
 by their agreement to remain inside the Bri-
 tish Empire and letting India be linked with
 the global strategic aims of the Anglo-American
 Imperialists.  They are pledged to safeguard
 British Capital and enterprises in India and
 are offering anti-national terms  to  foreign
 Imperialist captal and enterprises.
 The leaders of the National Congress have
 compromised with the old social allies of the
 British Imperialism, the Princes and landlords.
 They are hindering the democratic unification
 of various nationalities in autonomous ling-
 uistic provinces.  They are playing with the
 problem of the abolition of the Zamindari
 system with the result that the feudal parasites
 are getting their price, the tiller of the soil re-
 mains land hungry, while the people suffer
 famine conditions.
 The leaders of the Congress representing
 big capitalist interests have entered into alliance
 with the feudal parasites and  Imperialist
 exploiters and warmongers.  The domination of
 this unholy alliance over our national life must be re-
 placed by a new anti-Imperialits alliance of workers,
 peasants, youth,  women, progressive intellectuals
 and national bourgeois elements who all suffer under
 the present regime. Parties, organisations, groups
 CIA-RDP83-00415R008500030004-0
 and eminent  individuals representing these
 anti-imperialist democratic  classes and in-
 terests have yet to be regrouped inside a broad-
 based Democratic Front.  To the new and
 difficult problems of building such a Demo-
 cratic Front which will carry forward the anti-
 imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, INDIA
 TO-DAY will make its contribution.
 Importance of India
 The eyes of both the Imperialist and the
 anti-imperialist leaders the world over are
 fixed on India.  The Imperialist statesmen
 of the world realise that with China gone
 out of their orbit, India is their last major
 base  left in    the  colonial  world,  and
 that  without    India's  aid  they  cannot
 launch a major war on the Asian soil.    In
 other words, they realize that without the
 Indian help they cannot turn back the wheel
 of history that is moving against them from
 Korea to Burma and will ultimately push
 them  down  their  historic  doom.      The
 anti-Imperialist leaders of the world realise
 [that if India breaks away from the Imper-
 ialist camp, it will be a decisive blow against
 the Imperialist war-mongers, and winning
 [a major ally for the camp of peace and de-
 mocracy.  That  is  why  Stalin welcomed
 Nehru's peace initiative on Korea.  That is
 why Mao Tse-tung gratefully greeted India's
 'recognition of China and her championing of
 China's right of admission into the U. N. O.
 But the vacillations, the weaknesses and the
 contradictions    of  Nehru   Government's
 policy are also  the dismay   of progressive
 people   everywhere.   They  look forward
 to  the   day  when the    Indian  popular
 movement will     be able to force a  real
 consistent change of policy on the Govern
 ment,  or  establish      a  new Government
 which will     adopt a  new foreign policy
 and which will raise its powerful voice against
 the imperialist war-mongers, help to ensure
 lasting peace and aid the forces of freedom
 and democracy in every land.
 INDIA TO-DAY will build a broad-
 based Indian Peace  movement  and unite
 all Indian anti-imperlialist forces to actively
 aid Asian liberation and  advance  along
 lines that will align our great country with
 the camp  of anti-imperialism, democracy
 and peace headed by the Socialist U. S. S. R.
 and the New People's China.
 INDIA   TO DAY is dedicating itself to
 a great and noble task, the struggle for full
 national independence and establishment of

 India in the
 Battle for Peace
 1. With Imperialist War-mongers or
 Patriotic Peace Partisans ?
 BEFORE the scars of suffering have healed, before
 the tragic memories of World War II have grown
 dim, the question on every intelligent lip and in every
 civilised land is: Will there be World War III ?
 The battle-lines are  getting drawn with
 greater and greater sharpness.
 The war-mongers are led by the American
 Imperialists, who had hoped to take over the con-
 quests and the resources of the defeated German
 and the Japanese Imperialists, and who  have
 emerged unchallenged as the greatest Imperi-
 alist power on earth. They consider domination
 of the world as their right.  They ? are out to
 blast all opposition to their plans by freedom-
 loving nations with their guns, by launching or
 provoking wars against them.  Their allies are
 from among the reactionary politicians of every
 country who are rapidly losing the confidence
 of their own peoples.
 They mask their aim of enslaving the world
 as defending human freedom and they perform
 this intellectual trick by borrowing arguments
 from the well-known arsenal of Goebbels &
 Co., by raising the  bogey of Communism.
 They have turned the U.N.O. away from its
 original aim and with the aid of their satellites
 have made it into an extension of the U.S.
 State Department, to rubber-stamp Truman-
 Acheson proposals.  They are out to re-arm
 Germany and make it the main arsenal in
 Europe and use the Reischwehr Generals and
 cadres to train their Atlantic Army.  They are
 out to rearm Japan and use it as their main
 arsenal in the  East and utilise the Japanese
 militarists to train up the armies of their Asian
 stooges.  On the soil of Korea they have al-
 ready fired the first salvoes of World War III
 and if the Korean conflict could not be extend-
 ed, it is despite the Americans, it is because the
 P. C. Joshi
 anti-imperialist peace-loving peoples and their
 wise leaders have successfully checked the war-
 mongers.
 The imperialist War Camp led by the Ame-
 rican Imperialists is being successfully countered
 by the anti-imperialist Peace Camp led by the
 U.S.S.R. and China.  The future of war and
 peace depends upon which among the two camps
 wins and which loses.
 Five post-war years
 Let us cast a rapid look back at the last 5
 post-war years to see who is winning and who
 is losing
 The American Imperialists made the blue prints of
 their post-war domination of the world while the
 World War II was on.
 They did not believe in alliance with the
 U.S.S.R. except as a war-time expedient.
 They worked and hoped for such a weakening
 of the U. S. S. R. that it could be ignored,
 bullied and  brow-beaten in post-war years.
 As American diplomacy began going back on
 the Yalta and Potsdam Agreements and the
 U. N. O. Charter, Soviet diplomacy exposed
 them at every step and on every issue and on
 all availabie occasions inside and outside the
 U. N. O. Soviet diplomats made  concrete
 proposals that will remove the causes of tension,
 ensure peace and lead to international co-
 operation.  The result has  been  that                                                                          the
 American rulers stand exposed, before a grow-
 ing number of peoples, including their own, as
 self seeking, power-mad, war-mongering poli-
 ticians who do not honestly seek settlement,
 but would either dictate to, or threaten others,
 to have their way.  In the world of today, the
 side that loses the ideological-moral battle in
 the judgment of honest leaders of thought and
 men, loses more than half the battle.  The

 aims of American Imperialists are being un-
 masked by the principled and patient Soviet
 diplomacy.  The American Imperialists  are
 driven to drug their own people  with war
 hysteria and to rely  upon the thoroughly
 discredited weapon of anti-Communism.
 The American Imperialists had bargained
 that the war-devastated Soviet Economy will
 need American aid for its own rehabilitation,
 while the rest of the world will be available to
 them for their unhindered economic penetration.
 But, the reality under Stalin's Post-war Five-
 Year Plan turned out to be otherwise.  The
 Soviet leadership relying upon the honest will
 to labour of the Soviet workers and collective
 farmers not only fulfilled the Five-Year Plan in
 four years, not only crossed the pre-war figures
 in every branch of national economy, but was
 able to actively aid the rehabilitation of the
 East European People's Democracies whose
 leaders had spurned the enslaving entanglements
 of the Marshall Plan.  Wise Socialist planning
 defeated greedy capitalist calculations.
 The result is that when the Soviet leaders passion-
 ately declare that a peaceful co-existence of different
 social systems in the world is possible and necessary
 and challenge capitalism to peacefully compete with
 Socialism, the American Imperialists start raving and
 slandering, the last resort of those who know they are
 losing.
 Fiasco of Amrican plans in Europe
 The Dollar Imperialists had planned to restore
 capitalism in post-war Europe.  They counted
 their chickens too early.  Half of Europe-the
 Eastern half, set its face firmly against the old
 capitalist-feudal order and is stoutly marching
 towards Socialism in closest alliance with the
 U.S.S.R.  In the other half-the Western half,
 Imperialists were more successful because of
 the occupation of these countries by Anglo-
 American armies which enabled the reactionary
 politicians of these countries to stage a political
 come-back.
 Seeing through experience that the Mar-
 shall Plan has made their countries Ameri-
 can colonies, and  resenting  American inter-
 ference in their national-political life,  and
 realising the consequences of letting their sol-
 diers, sailors and    airmen become American
 mercenaries,  the  democratic  peoples of
 Western Europe are seeing that the path of
 their present rulers, the American puppets, is
 the path of national slavery, popular misery
 and ultimately mass human butchery. The
 peoples of    Western Europe, therefore, are
 building broad-based and growing peace move-
 ments which in important countries like France
 and Italy have become mighty mass movements
 and are headed by strong Communist Parties.
 Today,   no honest observer will say  that
 Western Europe is safe for the American Impe-
 rialists.                                                                          They cannot count on its support for
 their war-plans, because the people themselves
 are turning against their plans.  On the other
 hand, independent neutrals frankly state that if the
 American Imperialists provoke a Europeon war the
 Western Europe will be lost to Communism in no time,
 i.e., it will go out of the imperialist orbit and into the
 hands of its own peoples.  Such is the growing
 weakness of the American position in Western
 Europe and such the emerging awakening of
 the people.
 Asia has become a volcano for them
 The Imperialist circles had hoped that with
 some adaptations, and minor reshuffles they
 will be able to retain or regain their Asiatic
 colonies.
 Their first big shock, from which they took
 long to recover, was when the Chinese people
 decisively rejected the regime of Chiang Kai-
 sliek and all the plans of American strategists
 remained on paper despite millions of dollars
 sunk to stabilise Chiang's Government, despite
 millions of tons of equipment to aid his armies
 in the field..
 Decisively defeated but yet undeterred, the
 American Imperialists fell back on the three-
 pronged MacArthur attack on People's China-
 in the                                                                     north through Korea, in  the south
 through Viet-Nam, and on the central mainland
 from Formosa. The MacArthur plan has been
 buried in the plains and high-lands of Korea,
 and the five-starred General has had to face
 disgrace and dismissal.
 Instead of a restoration of the pre-war status-quo,
 all the Imperialist rulers of the world are faced with
 armed national liberation struggles in various South-
 East Asian countries.
 Even in the sleepy  Middle East a new
 national liberation upsurge is gathering strength
 and Imperialist puppets have to jail thousands
 of patriots and resort to martial-law in order to
 keep themselves in power.  The Anglo-Ameri-
 can rivalry over oil has become so acute that
 their native agents are using the method of as-
 sasination to outmanoeuvre each other and serve
 their respective imperialist masters.
 The Asiatic Colonial World, thus, far from being
 the main reserve of World Imperialism, has become its
 main problem  today.   The imperialist war-
 mongers are being forced to realise that the

 continuous supply of essential and strategic raw
 materials from the colonies cannot be taken
 for granted, nor any large-scale recruitment
 of colonial man-power for their future war
 against the U.S.S.R. and China.   The more
 far-sighted of the Imperialist statesmen are
 already panicky over their colonial rear crack-
 ing faster than it can be patched up.
 Alliance of Puppets breaking
 The American Imperialists united the reac-
 tionary politicians inside every country into
 an American Party, they won over the Right-
 wing Socialist and Labour leaders who had
 begun to disdain the very class on whose
 shoulders they had risen to political and mass
 leadership and learn to respect the opinions
 of their master class and they were only too
 willing to denounce Communism as "authorit-
 arian" and "dictatorial" and glorify capitalism
 as  "democratic socialism"  and  popularise
 American war-plans as peace projects.
 The American   Imperialists  seemed  to
 succeed for a while.  Even the once roaring
 British lion began acting as the lap-dog of
 Lady Dollar.  But this pro-imperialist, anti-
 democratic, war-mongering alliance of reaction
 could never be stabilised. Lenin had forecast
 long ago that  capitalists, who cannot but
 follow the law of dog eat dog, can never build
 a lasting unity among themselves.  Whatever
 American diplomacy wa; able to achieve in
 the first post-war years in the nature of build-
 ing an Alliance of Puppets has begun showing
 signs of serious strain in the last two years.
 The squabbles  over the distribution of
 Marshall Aid appear small before the problem
 of getting the so-called "Atlantic countries"
 make their just contribution.  Each wants the
 maximum of Ameri an money and equipment
 and is prepared to contribute the least in men
 to serve as cannon-fodder in America's anti-
 Soviet war.
 The more real the implications of German
 re-armament become for the peoples who were
 the victims of German aggression, the more
 their panic increases, and the less possible the
 American puppets find to defend the American
 alliance before their bewilderd peoples.  Same
 with the re-armament of Japan in the east.
 The first threat to use the atom bomb by
 Truman led Attlee rushing to Washington.
 The load of American-dictated British rearma-
 ment has already split the loyal British Cabinet.
 In Korea the defeat of the American Army,
 led by their greatest General, equipped with
 all the weapons that American efficiency could
 produce, at the hands of the Korean Liberation
 Army and the heroic Chinese Volunteers, with-
 out the real weight of the Chinese People's
 Liberation Army being thrown in, without the

 Soviet Air Force and the Soviet Armies coming
 in to the field, has convinced the world that
 the American side is the losing side.  Such a fiasco
 of American arms and leadership as witnessed
 in Korea cannot but have a devastating effect
 on the morale and the internal unity of the
 American Puppets.
 The American plans are not succeeding.
 They are being exposed and checkmated by
 Soviet diplomacy; they are being disrupted by
 popular action and wherever they have resorted
 to military  intervention,  they   are  being
 defeated by military action.
 Danger of War has become acuter
 But the Imperialists would not be imperi-
 alists if they took. their defeat 1,:ing down.
 The less the people listen to their propaganda,
 the louder they lie to inject the backward.
 The more they lose, the more desperate they
 grow.  From propagnda of war, they passed
 on to preparations for war, and have actually
 started local wars in two sectors of Asia, in
 Korea and Viet-Nam, and in Europe they are
 already trying provocation against the People's
 Democracies through  the Tito gang from
 Yugoslavia.
 The one historic lession of the last 100
 years of Imperialist domination, which Lenin
 first  pointed  out  in his  famous classic
 "Imperialism-the Last Phase of Capitalism" is that
 war is in the nature of Imperialism; it is the
 law of its life.
 The one historic lesson, driven home into
 the heads of millions of intelligent men, of the
 last two world wars, is that diplomatic checks
 in peace-time do not make the imperialist
 warmongers adopt the path of reason, on the
 other contrary, they go more & more hypocri-
 tical and hysterical and take to actual prepa-
 rations for war; that defeat in local wars does
 not convince the war-makers that their future
 is doomed, on the contrary, they think that
 only through bigger wars will they win their
 real aims.  Such were the calculations and the
 practice of Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo.  Such
 is the case with the Anglo-American Imperiali-
 sts today.
 There is no guarantee of lasting peace in
 the world until the  Imperialist ruling classes
 and their reactionary puppets are hounded
 out of political life inside their own countries
 and successfully prevented  from interfering
 in the lives of other countrles.
 Hence the very defeats of the Anglo-American
 plans in the past five post-war years are a call for
 more vigilance, for bringing about a still greater
 awareness of the issues involved among the broad
 masses of the peoples of all countries, for uniting and
 consolidating the camp of peace and democracy more
 and more.
 Peace depends upon the People
 The basic issues remain unsettled; the dan-
 ger of war remains real; it is true that the war-
 mongers have been thrown on the  defen-
 sive, but millions of people have yet to be
 educated, activised,  organised and thrown
 into action in defence of peace.
 In February this year, the Pravda corres-
 pondent asked Stalin the one question agitat-
 ing the minds of all intelligent people; "What
 will be the outcome of this struggle of the
 aggressive and the peace-loving forces ?"
 Stalin gave the following answer in his tra-
 ditionally clear cut manner:
 "Peace will be preserved and strengthened if the
 people take into their own hands the cause of the
 preservation of peace and defend it to the end. War
 may become inevitable if the war-mongers succeed in
 enmeshing the popular masses in a net of lies,
 deceiving them and drawing them into another war.
 "This is the reason why a broad campaign for
 the preservation of peace, as a means for exposing
 the criminal machinations of the warmongers is now
 of paramount signi--fccance.
 The issue and the task of the day could not
 be put into simpler and more truthful words.
 Russia, China and India shall decide
 The active role of the people the world over
 is the need of the hour.  Lenin underlined the
 historic importance of the Indian people in
 a manner from which the anti-imperialist lead-
 ers of the Indian people cannot but derive an
 urgent sense of their own duty.  Scanning the
 world situation after the end of World War I
 and the victory of the Russian Revolution the
 eagley-eed Lenin confidently prophesied:
 "In the last analysis the upshot of the struggle
 will  be determined by the fact that Russia, India
 and China etc., account for the overwhelming majority
 of the population of the globe. And it is precisely
 this majority that during the past few years has been
 drawn into the struggle for emancipation with extra-
 ordinary rapidity, so that in this respect there
 cannot be the slightest shadow of doubt  what
 the final outcome  of  the world struggle will
 be.  In  this  sense  the  complete   victory of

 Socialism is July and absolutely assured."
 (Lenin: "Better Fewer, But Better,"
 Pravda, March 4, 1923).
 Let us recall where did Russia and China
 stood then and where do they stand now? And
 contrast their position with ours, only to realise
 acutely that our feet have to march Paster to
 catch up with our great neighbours and historic
 allies.   Geography, history  and  our  own
 national aims proclaim aloud: Russia, China and
 India together can decisively change the course of human
 history, against Imperialist warmongers, and towards
 the liberation, peace and prosperity of humanity.
 The Indian patriots cannot but derive new
 and  limitless self-confidence by grasping she
 full significance of the strength of our allies.
 Our North-Western Ally
 Soviet Russia was struggling for life after
 World War I. After World War II it is head-
 i:ig the world-wide anti-imperialist democratic
 peace camp.  In the relatively short span I.-
 30 years, it is such a historic forward lead,
 at the head of progressive humanity,  that
 only a wisely  directed family of Socialist
 nations like the U.S.S.R.  could confidently
 take.
 The Russians have earned their leading
 place through the blood of their countless
 martyrs, through the sweat of  their toilers
 and through the wisdom of  their leaders.
 They staged the first successful popular re-
 volution in the Epoch of Revolutions.                          They
 were the first to build Socialism in their
 country.  They played the foremost part in
 the defeat of Fascist Imperialists in World
 War  II.  They unmasked     Anglo-American
 post-war plans  for world domination   and
 for launching World War III.   They have
 offered practical plans to save peace  and
 ensure international co-operation.
 POLITICALLY, the unity of the Soviet
 State is based on the highest form of peoples'
 democracy  and  equality of    nations  yet
 achieved by mankind.  Behind Stalin are men
 and women enjoying the fruits of Socialism and
 engaged in building Communism.       Truman
 is sitting on the top of a volcano of disconten-
 ted slaves  of capital, of nations robbed of
 their independence, of coloured races suffer-
 ing discrimination, oppression and lynchings.
 MILITARILY,the might of the Red Army
 was tested against what was once supposed
 to be the unconquerable German  Army.
 Stalin has successfully carried out the behest
 of Lenin, to raise and train the Red Army
 to be able to defeat any combination of Impe-
 rialist powers.  The German and the Japanese
 Imperialists challenged it during World War
 II and lost half of Europe and a good part of
 Asia to the people.  If the Anglo-American
 Imperialists dare challenge it, they will. lose
 the remaining parts of Europe and Asia.
 ECONOMICALLY, the capitalist leaders
 are pursuing policies which worsen problems
 all round and intensify the economic crisis,
 while the Soviet leaders  have completed
 the Post-War Five-Year Plan in only 4 years
 and 3 months and have achieved a magnifi-
 cient success.  The industrial output in 1950
 was 73% above that of 1940.  The  1950
 grain  harvest surpassed  the  1940 harvest
 by 345 million poods.  Soviet citizens have
 received 4 major price reductions and large
 wage   increases. Against this the economy
 of capitalist countries presents a picture of
 stagnation and decay.
 During the last twenty years the average
 level  of production  in  U. S. A. increased
 about two per cent annually; but in the
 U. S. S. R. it increased by twenty per cent.
 Thus, the tempo of the growth of Socialist
 economy is ten times that of the most powerful
 capitalist country in the world .  Who will.
 doubt that Socialism will surpass capitalism
 in our own day and under our own eyes. ?
 In the U. S. S. R.,  atomic     energy is
 being put to peaceful uses; mountains are
 being blasted, course of rivers changed, whole
 deserts irrigatedto become fields and pastures;
 the very climate and nature are being changed.
 Who would want his  country  remain
 yoked to the dying Capitalism, instead of
 learning  from  and  cooperating  with the
 rising Socialism.
 INTERNATIONALLY, the strength and
 the influence of the U. S. S. R. are grow-
 ing.  New states have risen on its borders
 which are bound with it in closest alliance;
 450 million strong People's Republic in the
 cast and 150 million strong Peoples' Democra-
 cies in the West. Its policy of World Peace
 of achieving  peaceful   co-existence of the
 Capitalist and the  Socialist systems  and
 freedom for all nations  has found a world
 wide popular base through the emergence
 of the World Peace Congress which mobilised
 50 crores of people against the atom bomb
 and plans to rally more for the Pact of Peace.
 It is India's furtune to  have such a strong
 prosperous and peaceful neighbour on its north-west.

 Our North-Eastern Ally
 The victory of the Chinese Revolution
 has soul-stirring significance that the cause
 of Asian liberation has won its greatest victory
 and a mighty bastion of peace, democracy
 and freedom manned by 450 million  Free
 Asians has emerged on the Asian soil.
 All the weight of the Chinese diplomacy
 in alliance with the U. S. S. R. will be
 thrown on the side of defeating the Imper-
 ialist plans in Asia and ensuring the with-
 drawal of foreign Imperialist troops from all
 Asian countries.
 Every Asian country can feel secure against
 imperialist military intervention by entering into
 a mutual assistance pact with the People, Repub-
 lic of China.
 The Mao leadership is putting through
 plans to transform China into a great modern
 industrial nation with Soviet assistance, and
 is offering trade on equal terms and in mutual
 interest to all Asian countries and above all
 to our country. The Dollar Imperialists are
 rebuilding Japan under the slogan of coopera-
 tion  between  an  industrial  Japan  and
 an agricultural South-East Asia.
 Protector of Asian nations
 From the Imperialist side, the economic
 pressure on all Asian countries wil be to keep
 us as agricultural and backward countries
 producing cheap raw materials for     their
 industries and aggressive war plans.   From
 the Chinese side will come the inspiring
 example of how a free nation transforms the
 old colonial and feudal  order into a new
 democratic  and  well-balanced   industrial
 agricultural economy serving all the needs of
 its people.
 The agrarian reforms have already changed
 the chronically famine and flood stricken Kuo-
 mintang                            China  into a prosperous  food-ex
 porting People's China, as we know it from our
 own experience. As new industrialisat ion plans
 get  into stride,  new happy prospects will
 arise before every Asian nation which is in
 friendly cooperation with People's China.
 In the wake of the victory of the Chinese
 National Revolution, a new Cultural Renais-
 sance is  taking place.  Mass illiteracy is
 being rapidly eradicated. Intellectuals-leaders
 of an ancient nation-are educating themselves
 anew in the science of Marxisn-Leninism,
 the science which when applied skilfully and
 correctly by the Mao leadership led to the
 victory of their Revolution. When the leaders
 of the  Chinese thought and culture start
 applying this new science to various branches of
 knowledge, China will make new contribu-
 tions to world culture.
 It is India's good fortune to have such a rising
 anti-imperialist, peaceful power as  our north-
 eastern neighbour.

 THEIR TRUE PLACE IS WITH             THE U. S. S. R.
 AND  THE   PEOPLE'S   CHINA INSIDE THE    ANTI-

 Informed Indians spontaneously contrast
 Mountbatten-created and        Nehru-led  India
 with Mao-led People's Republic of China.
 The anti-American feeling in our country today
 is a growing mass feeling.           The moral and
 material strength of the U. S. S. R., despite the
 anti-Soviet propaganda in Big Business press
 is being increasingly realised by all sections of
 the people  The Tass publication "Sovietland"
 and specially its editions in Indian langu-
 ages are having  record sales.   The  mass

 peace-loving  traditions  are growingly be-

 pro-Soviet.

 II Zigzags of Nehru's Foreign Policy
 T HE British-imposed  deadlock had left
 India without a National Government
 for the entire war period.  When  the  San
 Francisco Conference met for the foundation of
 the U. N. 0., the British-nominated delegation
 from our country was led by the quisling
 knight Ramaswamy Mudaliar.  The Congress
 Working Committee was yet in jail but Gandhiji
 was out and he denounced this misrepresen-
 tation of India and declared :
 "Real peace can onJ be based on freedom and
 equality of all races and nations......exploitation
 and domination of one nation over another can have
 no place in a world striving  to put an end to
 all wars.
 "An indispensable preliminary to peace is the
 complete freedom of India from all foreign control.
 "Independent India is pledged and prepared for
 international cooperation, which may take the
 form of a World Federation."

 Molotov's helping hand                    Caretaker Government, under Ranganadhan
 These words could not but find sympathe-
 tic response among  lovers of  peace and
 friends of freedom. Forty members of the
 British Parliament demanded the release of
 Congress leaders enabling Indian represen-
 tation at'Frisco by representatives of a National
 Indian Government. Molotov threw Soviet
 weight on the Indian side when he stated :
 "The delegationfrom India represented a country
 which was not independent...... We are confident,
 the time will come when the voice of independent
 India will be heard."
 When the problem of colonies came up
 Molotov again stated:
 "The Soviet delegation realises that from the
 point of view of international security we must first
 of all see to it that dependent countries are enabled
 as soon as possible to take the path of national in-
 dependence. The Soviet delegation will take active
 part in the consideration of this problem in its entire y."
 Even the correspondent of the Hindustan
 Times, J. J. Singh was stirred into writing:
 "I confess that when Mr. Molotov read this
 -1  clause (quoted above) my eyes moistened.  I felt
 an indescribable thrill.  Here was a great and power-
 ful nation striking out forcibly and in unmistakable
 terms for the `national independence' of all peoples"
 1. The First Flush
 The Congress leadership utilised the post-
 war national upsurge to strike a compromise
 with the British Government.  After compli-
 cated negotiations, the Interim Government
 with Nehru as the Vice-President was formed
 on September 2, 1946.
 Nehru outlined his foreign policy in the
 first press Conference. He declared that hence-
 forth :
 India's foreign policy will be independent
 of the policy of White Hall;
 India will support veto in the U. N. Char-
 ter for the sake of Big Power unanimity;
 India will stand for Colonial freedom;
 Indian men and money will not be used for
 the suppression of national  movements in
 other countries; and
 India will  fight against    South  African
 treatment of Indians.
 They were bold new words; but at the
 Paris Peace Conference  the Indian dele-
 gation, which was nominated by the earlier
 MAY 1951
 continued to side with the British on some
 vital issues.
 At the First Session of the U. N. 0. General
 Assembly (end of 1946) India and the Soviet
 acted together on the issues of
 (i) the South African racial discrimination
 against Indians;
 (ii) the South African plan to annex South-
 West Africa;
 (iii) Setting up  Trusteeship Council in a
 manner as to provide  democratic  checks
 against Imperialist  oppression; and
 (iv) the retention of the veto system.
 Imperialist circles did not like this orienta-
 tion of India inside the U. N. 0. and put
 pressure. Indian delegate justice Chagla sum-
 mated the position as follows:
 "Our instructions from the Government of India
 were that we should consider every question that
 Came up before the United .Nations on its merits and
 decide accordingly.
 "As it happened Russia and her group did support
 its strongly on the South African issue,  and on
 certain other questions we found ourselves taking
 the same line as the Russians.  But at, no time did
 we blindly vote with the Russian group."
 Mrs. Pandit, the leader of the Indian
 delegation stated :
 "The Soviet approach to most problems has been
 somewhat more liberal than that of Britain and
 the United States".
 So deep was the stirring of national feeling
 within India in recognition  of the  Soviet
 support to the cause of India and of colonial
 freedom that even Ashok Mehta was driven to
 write in the Blitz:
 "We acknowledge  with gratitude and pride
 the debt we owe to Russia for the unstinted support
 given to India in the hour of need."
 Asian Relations Conference
 India carried forward her new role to
 pursue an independent foreign policy and aid
 Asian freedom when the Nehru Government
 took initiative to summon in New Delhi
 the inter-Asian Relations Conference (April,
 1947).
 From  its  platform  Nehru  denounced
 Imperialist domination and proclaimed Asian
 nations' determination to be free:
 "For too long we of Asia have been petitioners
 in western Courts and Chancelleries in the past.
 We propose to stand on our own feet and cooperate
 with all others who are prepared to cooperate with
 us. We do not intend to be the plaything of others."

 Vacillations start
 These rousing declarations and unanimous
 reports and resolutions were essentially sound.
 Subsequent events were to prove whether they
 were empty words or meant to be seriously
 implemented.  China  was yet  under  the
 Chiang regime which under American Imperialist
 inspiration and  guidance was planning to
 unleash a gigantic civil war.  The South-East
 Asian countries were in  the midst of their
 national struggles. In the middle east, Anglo-
 American rivalries were becoming acuter, but
 the joint front to drown the rising local anti-
 imperialist                          democratic movements was  also
 in operation.  The role  of India was, there-
 fore, decisive in the coming months and years.
 This phase of India adopting an indepen-
 dent policy also led to the establishment of
 diplomatic relations with the U. S. S. R.
 in April, 1947. Imperialist pressure to pre-
 vent and  delay  establishment of normal
 relations with our great. neighbour did not
 succeed, but the pro-imperialist anti-Soviet
 reactionaries immediately  manoeuvred and
 got all the facilities for stepping up foul and
 slanderous anti-Soviet  propaganda in  the
 Indian press and invading our Universities
 and utilising all the channels of information
 (e. g, the A. I. R. ) and public instruction.
 At the third  session of the            U. N. O.
 General Assembly  (autumn,   1947)  Indian
 representatives began to vacillate; the duality
 of Indian stand puzzled the fiiend.s of India
 as it roused into. criticism the advanced Indian
 democrats.
 India and the Soviet acted together and
 aided the cause of peace, national self-deter..
 mination  and international co-operation on
 the following important issues: the retention
 of veto in the U. N. O. Charter ; Palestine;
 the Indonesian cease-fire; the South African
 plan to annex the South-West Africa; the
 question. of withdrawal of foreign troops from
 Greece;  the question of submitting to  the
 U. N. C), information about colonies; and the
 issue of the Trusteeship Council.
 India supports Imperialists
 But on some very important issues India
 supported the Anglo-Amrican camp and aided
 their anti-democratic plans.
 In the name of acting the conciliator bet-
 ween Great Powers, India stood neutral on
 the question  of ratification of the  Italian
 Peace Treaty.  Ratification would have led
 to prompt withdrawal     of Anglo-American
 troops  from  Italy.  India offered it under
 American pressure.
 Indian representatives supported Anglo-
 American Imperialists for the first time on the
 issue of setting  up  the Little  Assembly
 in  violation  of the  U. N.  O.  Charter,
 diminishing the authority of the  Security
 Council and by-passing the veto right and
 thus  moulding    U. N. O. into an  Anglo-
 American Imperialist agency with the aid
 of the fake majority of the puppet states.
 On the Korean issue, the Indian delegation
 supported the American game.
 The U. S. had proposed that under U. S.
 supervision elections be held in both zones,
 a Government formed and then troops of occu-
 pying powers be withdrawn.
 The Soviet demanded that the represen-
 tatives of the Korean people be heard on the
 matter, and proposed  that the  occupying
 powers first withdraw their forces and then
 elections be held and a Korean Democratic
 Government be established.
 India's responsibility for Korean War
 The Indian delegation intervened with a
 compromise proposal.  It proposed U. N. O.
 control, instead of supervision of the elections,
 but the troops of the occupying powers were
 to be withdrawn after elections. Thus the crux
 of the American proposal was taken over.
 The first  chairman of the U  N. O.
 Commission for Korea was an Indian repre-
 scantative and he obediently dittoed everything
 Washington suggested.
 JVehrn Government thus  bears the political
 moral responsibility for the later open military
 American  aggression against the  heroic Korean
 people. Indian Government aided the American
 plans and preparations for the same.
 And what has been India's reward? Only this
 that  the American . Imperialists  are  now
 trying to impose on the Nehru Government,
 the same proposals for Kashmir which it had
 itself prepared .or the Koreans earlier. Historic
 retribution stares Nehru Government in the
 face.
 Why did the Nehru  Government start
 going back upon its declared aim of indepen-
 dent foreign Policy  ?
 Because of August 15, 1947!
 The  deal between  the   Indian  big
 capitalists, represented by  the Congress
 leadership, and  the . British Government
 had been struck. India was to declare itself'
 a Republic but stay inside the British empire;
 i. e., the Congress leadership had agreed

 structure but had volunteerily agreed to let
 India be integrated with British Imperialist
 "Defence"  (i. e., War)  strategy.
 Nehru Government was playing at power
 politics so far,  exploiting  Anglo-American
 contradictions on the one hand and the Imper-
 rialist and Soviet contradictions on the other.
 With the 15th of August, the phase of pressure
 tactics and noble words ended, and then began
 Pandit Mountbatten KiJai and Lord Nehru Ki Jai.
 Nehru Government's foreign policy staged
 a right about turn into the Imperialist group.
 2. The Phase of Retreat
 (August 15, 1947 to early 1950)
 The price of 15th of August Mountbatten-
 Nehru settlement was that practical steps
 to coordinate Indian economy and strategy
 with British went ahead and Nehru's voice
 became the Asian voice of Anglo-American
 Imperialism.
 Strategic Coordination
 Through  a  series  of  commonwealth
 Conferences Indo-British       economic   and
 strategic links were strengthened anew. Our
 military equipment is  patterned upon and is
 exclusively secured  from Anglo-American
 sources. Our Commander-in chief was groomed
 for the job by the British themselves. Our
 Naval and Air Chiefs are British and so are
 all technical military advisers.
 Nehru's Government was "fully consulted"
 on the text of the ATLANTIC- PACT and it
 "whole-heartedly   consented"   to  Britain
 joining the Pact.  Indian Government linked
 up her defence with   Britain and supported
 Britain linking up with U.  S. A. and its
 Atlantic puppets, and, thus, we became part
 of the Anglo-American global strategic chain.
 Nehru Government participated both in the
 secret and the public  discussions  of the
 PACIFIC PACT.  India was represented at
 the Baguio Conference by the notorious British
 puppet Ramaswamy Mudaliar.  Dr. Evatt,
 Australian Minister,  who was playing - a
 leading role in the negotiations, stated after
 consultation with Bevin:
 "Such a pact would be on the lines of the Sorth
 Atlantic  Pact.... Countries certain to be included
 in any first approach for membership of the pact are
 believed to be the U. S. A., Canada, Britain,
 Australia, New Zealand and India.  By dual
 p
 n
 e
 The Pacific Pact and t
 pation in it would have fructified but for the
 emergence of People's China.  The moment
 Nehru Government realised that this new rising
 major Asiatic power would denounce and
 oppose the Pacific Pact in the East as resohrtely
 as the U. S. S. R. was opposing the Atlantic
 Pact in the West, it retreated.
 Economic penetration
 The long drawn negotiations with Britain
 and other Empire countries have crystallised
 in the form of the Colombo Plan under which
 our economy is condemned to remain colonial,
 i.e., go on producing  raw  and strategic
 materials  for imperialist needs and remain
 industrially backward and dependent.
 An Indo-American Air Pact was signed
 early in 1947, on the basic of equality between
 the gaint America and the infant India.
 Airlines, Airmen and Aircraft of 3 big American
 Air Companies are getting acclimatised to
 our climate, landscape, etc.
 American penetration has come through
 other channels too. Early in 1949, an American-
 dominated  World Bank  Mission  made a
 thorough survey not only of the projects for
 which loan was demanded by India but also of
 the over-all economic and financial resources
 of our country.
 Another American-dominated Mission
 carne from the International Monetary Fund
 to consider loans of Rs. 540 crores  for the
 reconstruction of country's   airfields  and
 Rs. 300  crores for building an     `Indian'
 Navy under a British Admiral        and with
 ships from British and American yards.
 It is not only that the Nehru Government
 has been going to Anglo-American monopoly
 capitalists for economic `aid', but has also been
 yielding to their pressure not to enter into
 normal (and to us more profitable) economic
 relations with the U. S. S. R., the People's
 China and the East European countries.
 The  cat is  out of the bag  inside the
 American Congress  where  the shameless
 demand is being openly made that if we
 want American food to fight our famine we
 must not only pay for it but also mortgage
 our foreign policy and become enemies of the
 U. S. S. R,  and  the P eople's China and
 endanger our national security.

 Against Asian Freedom
 Earlier, Nehru had spoken for  Asian
 freedom.  In this phase of his foreign policy
 he struck a series of blows against the freedom'
 struggles of the Asian countries.
 After the renewed Dutch. aggression in
 Indonesia in the winter of 1948 there was
 universal demand for firm action  by the
 U: N. O:, and solidarity  action by Asian
 nations.
 Earlier Soviet  and India had worked
 together.  This time India and U. S. A.,
 worked together.  Indian  delegate, Rama
 Rau at the U. N. O. dropped the demand
 of an immediate cease-fire and total with-
 drawal of Dutch trrops.
 Nehru Government  took  initiative    to
 summon an Asian Conference on Indonesia
 but  did  not  invite  the  Asiatic  Soviet
 Republics to it.  It is no wonder that U. S.
 Ambassador in India, Loy Henderson was
 able to forecast that this Conference would
 have a "constructive effect."
 The       Conference  did  denounce   Dutch
 Aggression in the preamble of its resolution,
 but in the operative part, it endorsed  the
 American plan on crucial issues.
 Thus, the authority of the Republican
 leaders was confined to the Residency of
 Jogjakarta.
 The Republican Government was forced
 to become part of an Interim Government
 together with the old  pro-imperialist non-
 Republicans.
 Dutch troops were given  three months
 to smash up guerilla resistance and they could
 be used later to " restore law and order".
 The New York Times correspondent reported
 that Loy Henderson played a significant role
 to make the final resolution " moderate and
 workable."
 The organ of the British oligarchy the
 London Economist commended the Delhi con-
 ference as an example of " what can be done with
 Asian nationalism if handled aright."
 Help to Nu; abuses to Malayan patriots
 New Delhi also became the venue of an-
 other " informal Conference on Burma " where
 'Fhakin Nu was promised support against the
 Communists and other patriots (in the form of
 arms and money) and pressure was exerted on
 him to settle with the pro-British Karens.
 After this the London Economist characterised
 Nehru  as  a  " statcman  of genius"  and
 explained
 "He had first assembed the nations of Asia for
 consideration of the Indonesian question and incidentally
 taken the wind out of Russia's anti-imperialist sails by
 giving leadership to Asian opinion on the subject. .
 .He has now brought together a family council
 of the Commonweath in such a way that neither is
 Britain exposed to the charge of reviving Imperialism
 by intervention in Burma, nor is India left alone to
 cope with a very unpleasant situation on its eastern
 borders.
 Nehru went on a goodwill visit to Indo-
 nesia  and  on  the  way back  touched at
 Singapore where he publicly fraternised and
 feasted  with  the British butchers of the
 Malayan patriots as a State Guest and roundly
 denounced the guerillas.  This he did know-
 ing that the majority of the Indians living in
 Malaya, true to the national tradition of their
 homeland, were anti-British ; knowing that
 the best sons of the Indian plantation workers
 and employees in Malaya were among the
 heroic guerilla  fighters; knowing that  they
 had made  a  proud  contribution even      in
 numbers   martyred  in  the  united     armed
 struggle of Indians, Chinese and Malays for
 the sacred cause of Malayan independence
 and democratic rights.
 It was no sudden outburst on Nehru's
 part. The basis for this new friendliness with
 the British rulers and this hostility towards the
 freedom fighters of colonial conntries had been
 laid when as a part of the 15th August settle-
 ment, Nehru Government had agreed to let a
 section of the Gurkhas in the old Indian Army
 join the British Army.  Those very Gurkhas
 were now being used against the Malayan
 anti-imperialist struggle.
 India's reward: Intervention in Kashmir
 Indian reactionaries had thought that for their
 servile pro-Imperialism the least price they would get,
 would be Anglo-American support over Kashmir.
 What they really got was a public sermon. from
 Attlee and Truman to accept arbitration and stop
 talking in terms of national self-respect and just
 democratic principles.
 Verbal protests were, of course, made but
 the Dixon Mission, proposed by the Anglo-
 American representatives, was accepted, which
 tried to entangle India into accepting some
 variant of the Anglo-American plan for the
 strategic Kashmir.
 Servility to Imperialists could only get in
 return calls to surrender and never solidarity
 in a just cause.

 1. New shift : 1950 -
 The above headlong march into and along
 with the Imperialist camp was disrupted and
 halted by the rise of the Chinese People's
 Republic and the events that followed.
 The American strategists had not bargained
 for such a rapid loss of China.  They had hoped
 that with the  aid of their countless dollars
 and up to date equipment, Chiang Kai-shek
 would hold on a substantial part of China, at
 least, up to the time they prepared the ground,
 diplomatically and militarily, for a large-scale
 American war on the Chinese soil.
 Secondly, because the Kuomintang regime
 had begun to stink in the nostrils of decent men
 the world over through the exposure of its
 own  nepotism, corruption and inefficiency
 (all of which was inevitable under native
 reaction   representing   feudal-compradore
 interests in a backward colonial conntry),
 the Anglo-American rulers planned to build up
 Nehru as the wise Asian statesman and he
 had past reputation for anti-imperialism and
 progressivism.    Hence the Anglo-American
 diplomats directed a campaign of fulsome
 flattery of Nehru to exploit Indian national
 sentiment.  They organised pressure at  all
 the weak spots of the Indian situation and
 life to get the needed surrender by the Nehru
 Government to their plans.  Sadly for them,
 this plan too could not come to full fruition.
 Chinese Revolution: main reason of shift
 The rapid victories of the People's Libera.
 tion Army against Chiang Kai-shek convinced
 even the  friends of the    Anglo-American
 Imperialists in India that the American plans
 for the reconquest of China were still-born.
 Gradually the  significance of the birth of'
 Peoples' Republic of China began to dawn:
 that China was no more the sick man of
 Asia and 45 crores of people were actually
 up on their feet; that China was no more
 only potentially a great power but had begun
 to act as such, both on the dimplomatic and
 military planes; that the biggest nation of Asia
 through its own  liberation  had  suddenly
 advanced to the  position of leadership of
 Asia.  Indian ruling circles could not just
 whisk this reality away from their calculations.
 As the American aggressive plans for the
 whole of Asia, of direct or indirect control
 and domination of every Asian country, began
 unfolding themselves,  even  the  bourgeois
 nationalist circles in colonial countries, and
 MAY, 1951
 above all in India, began realising that to
 directly aid American plans is to heavily lose
 face before their own people.
 Korea exposes America's feet of clay
 The American military disasters in Korea
 spot-lighted the entire actual situation: that
 a determined freedom-loving people, even of such a
 small nation as Korea, can defeat and shake to its
 very foundations the aggressive military might of
 America; that the American ship even in Asian
 waters was a sinking ship.
 The  politically experienced  Indian  big
 bourgeois leadership began acting as even rats
 do inside a sinking ship and Nehru Govern-
 ment registered new shifts in its foreign policy,
 away from the direction it was rushing down
 and towards the course it had turned its back
 upon, though stilt remaining  yoked to its
 15th of August moorings.
 Nehru Government's welcome steps
 in this phase Nehru Government began
 disentangling itself' from the logical conse-
 quences  of  its earlier  and                                                                          growing pro-
 imperialist alignment and  on specific issues
 took a positive stand for the preservation of
 peace and demarcated itself from the rabid
 proposals of the war-mongers.
 Korea: It  first  supported the  illegal
 Anglo-American resolution and blessed Ame-
 rican aggression as United Nations' action.
 But as the American and puppet armies began
 reeling back under North Korean patriotic
 blows, it took bold initiative for a peaceful
 settlement of the Korean  issue.  Stalin wel-
 comed it, but Acheson turned itRown.  It
 has, therefore, thrown its diplomatic weight
 to localise the conflict.  It roundly denounced
 Truman threat to use      the atom bomb and
 helped to prevent the power-mad, U. S. rulers
 from putting this threat into practice. Despite
 these correct and concrete steps to save world
 peace, the Nehru  Government has  not yet
 renounced  its earlier support to the illegal
 U. N. 0.  resolution and has instead, sent a
 Medical Unit to Korea which is serving as a
 part of the British Empire forces in the field.
 China:    India's was the first Government
 outside the Soviet-led anti-imperialist camp
 to recognise the  Chinese People's Republic
 and ever since it has been strongly pressing
 for admission of People's China into the U. N.
 0. and for the seating of its representative in
 his rightful place in the Security Council.
 Inside the  U. N. 0., it opposed the Anglo-
 American proposal to denounce People's China
 as the aggressor, though it did not support the

 Soviet proposal to denounce actual  and real
 American  aggression despite violation of the
 Chinese air, blockade of the Chinese coast,
 occupation of Chinese territory in Taiwan and
 the bombings of Chinese towns. It  - -)t imper-
 missibly  upset over the assertion of Chinese
 suzerainty over Tibet.
 American War Propaganda and Agg-
 ressive Plans:  In a series of speeches and
 statements beginning from the second  half of
 last year, Nehru has denounced the key slogan
 of Anglo-American warmongers of a preventive
 anti Soviet war to win the next world war to
 win world peace. This upset the Imperialists,
 for it, discredited them in Asia and isolated
 them in their own countries.  This aided the
 Peace Partisans, for it enabled them to win new
 and hitherto vacillating elements to support the
 crusade for lasting peace by saving peace now.
 In the latest session of the  U.  N.  O.
 General Assembly, the Indian representative
 opposed  the Acheson  Plan  to revise the
 Charter and turn the U. N. O. away from
 its original purposes  of safeguarding peace
 and  subordinate U. N. O. to U. S. State
 Department dictation, acting as  its inter-
 national mask.
 Kashmir:  The Indian Government has
 refused to accept the Anglo-American Resolu-
 tion passed by the Security Council which will
 bring foreign troops on the Kashmir soil and
 subordinate its democratic Government to the
 arbitrary will of an American nominee.
 Food and Strategic Materials:  It has
 needed tl c pressure of menacing famine condi-
 tionsbefore the Nehru Government took the risk
 of displeasing the Dollar  Monopolists  and
 entered into negotiations for food deals with
 China and the U.S.S.R.     But the fraternal
 willingness of these countries and the easy and
 cheap terms offered did not prevent the Indian
 Government from giving monazite concession
 to the war-mongers--the avowed enemies of
 India's friends who arc  sending food  in her
 time of need.
 4. Whither India's Foreign Policy?
 The zigzags of' Nehru's foreign policy are
 the result of the push and pull between the
 Indian big capitalists and the Anglo-American
 Imperialists.
 Peace-loving  democrats the world over
 were as greatly disappointed over the pro-
 imperialist orientation of India's foreign policy
 following the 15th of August as they arc now
 looking with new hope towards India after a
 series of initiatives for peace by the Indian
 Government in the recent past.
 Progressive patriots  under Congress  in-
 fluence feel as proud of the new orientation of
 Nehru's foreign policy as they are discontented
 over his internal policy.
 Indian  Lefts tended to ignore the signi-
 ficance of these new shifts in Indian foreign
 policy, which were  themselves a reflection
 of  bigger shifts on the world scene.  Late
 awakening to reality never starts with a clear
 headed understanding and the mind registers
 extreme swings. Indian Lefts for the time being
 are sharply divided. Some tend to indulge in
 uncritical  glorification of Nehru's foreign
 policy, ignoring its vacillations and contra-
 dictions.  Others tend to ignore its objectively
 progressive role on crucial specific issues
 in the wider struggle of war  versus peace.
 A correct  understanding         that  neither
 surrenders to false national pride, nor shuts its
 eyes to living reality, is urgently called for.
 India under Nehru, by the very limitations
 imposed upon  Indian  sovereignty     under
 15th of August compromise, is. a part of the
 British Empire whose rulers have mortgaged
 and subordinated it  to the mighty Dollar
 Empire.
 Why this change in Nehru's policy ?
 The recent welcome shifts in Nehru's policy
 are a reflection of the contradictions in the camp
 of Imperialist reaction. ,
 As the weakness of the Imperialist posi-
 tion in Asia and the fiascoes of the immediate
 plans of aggressors became apparent, Indian
 ruling class circles became uneasy.  They
 realised that to go whole-hog with the Anglo-
 American   Imperialists  and permit them
 to  use  India  as  their  actual war-base,
 means putting their own    regime into jeo-
 pardy, face the rising hostility of the patrio-
 tic and                                                                      peaceful  Indian people, and lose
 everything    when    the    unconquerable  _
 Red Army from  the North-West and the
 heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army from
 the Norht-East come marching in pursuing
 the Anglo-American Imperalist armies to
 smash them in their  main  Asiatic base.
 They,  therefore,  decided to disown and
 dissociate themselves from the immediate war
 plans of the Anglo-American Imperialists.
 The Indian ruling class could take some
 hold anti-war  measures and risk the dis-
 pleasure of the British and the Americans
 becuase it is not,  itself, -faced  with any
 imminent threat of internal revolution.

 The dominant sections in the Indian
 leaderships are politically experienced enough
 not to hand mover the  national masses to
 the Left and themselves appear only as the
 apologists of the Imperialists.
 Hence the new shift in Nehru Govern-
 ment's policy; while not breaking lose from
 the Imperialists, hence the attempt to disentan-
 gle itself from getting into deeper commitments
 with the Imperialist warmongers disowning
 their war hysteria and even opposing their
 actual moves of aggression.
 Lenin, the greatest revolutionary strate-
 gist of our age, proclaimed   the tactical
 axiom that the proletarian  and the people's
 movement which cannot       exploit the con-
 tradictions in the enemies'         camp and Fail
 Ill. For World Peace
 The issue of peace or     war is  the cen-
 tral issue before every country  including
 ours.  From it stem all problems, and on it
 depend their solution too.
 This realisation led the advanced elements
 among Indian patriots to organise the Indian
 Peace movement as a part of the World Peace
 Congress which embraces in its ranks the best
 and most eminent sons of every people.
 The Indian Peace  committee already
 includes in its ranks Congressmen of the
 eminence of Dr. Kitchlew, Lala Dunichand
 and Pandit Sunderlal; Left leaders represen-
 ting almost all parties except the Right-wing
 pro-American Socialists; labour leaders like
 Chakkarai Chettiae and Satyapriya. Banerji;
 writers like Vallathol, Sumitranandan Pant,
 Mahadevi  Verma,  Tarash.ankar  Banerji,
 and Rajendra Singh Bedi; cultural workers
 like Prithvi Raj Kapoor, Anil Biswas, and
 Ravi.  Shankar;  journalists like Karanjia,
 Rana Jung  Bahadur Singh and Shamlal;
 jurists like P. R. Das; and Professors Kosambi,
 Habib and D. K. Karve. To get rid of the sec-
 tarian legacy of the past it is organising this
 month in Bombay its All India Convention
 to frankly discuss problems of rallying India
 for World Peace and Asian Liberation which
 will enable it to broad-base the movement.
 Attention will undoubtedly be concen-
 tratel upon the following specific issues:
 Pact of Peace: The Berlin session of the
 World Peace Council has launched the appeal
 for a world-wide campaign for a Pact of Peace
 between the five GreatPowers with the proviso
 that the nation that refuses will be considered
 as nursing aggressive intentions. It will be
 to win allies however vacillating and weak,
 will never successfully fight forward to victory.
 The right attitude for Indian progressives
 towards Nehru's foreign policy will. be  to:
 Boldly support all his specc peace moves;
 they objectively aid the anti-imperialist peace camp;
 Sharply expose all the weaknesses, vacillations
 and contradictitns of his policy which come from
 pro-imperialist alignment and demand that a con-
 sislent and firm peace policy be followed.
 Tirelessly  work  to establish a  Government
 that will more correctly reflect the will of our common
 people, complelly break Indian lies with the Im-
 perialists  and  whole-heartedly  join                                                                          the   anti-
 imperialist peace camp and lead India to plan her
 nigh ful role in the world,
 and Asian Liberation
 proposed that the Indian Government act the
 host  for  convening  such  an international
 conference.  Such  an   effort will  spotlight
 the decisive role of India. To get our Govern-
 ment take the initiative will be the problem
 before every   peace loving  Indian.
 The National Appeal:   The all. India
 Preparatory Committee will propose to launch
 the following  appeal  for   mass  signatures
 throughout the country:
 `?Affi.rnmi.ng our faith in the establishment of
 place and  good  will among nations   and
 confidently asserting that war is not inevitable,
 we call upon our people and our Government:
 To demand banning of all weapons of mass
 eeter-mnination and to call for simultaneous and
 proportionate disarmament among the nations.
 To urge the withdrawal from each Asian
 country q f all troops foreign to that country.
 To declare that no foreign power shall
 recruit for their armed ,forces Indian nationals
 or those of another country on Indian soil.
 To categorically state that no permanent
 or temporary transit bases or transport faci-
 lilies for troops, recruits or war materials
 shall be granted in India to any foreign power.
 It does not go beyond the oft-proclaimed
 aims of every section ofour national movement.
 In practice it means breaking away from the
 shame of the alignment with the Imperialist
 camp of war-mongers and taking our proud
 flace in  the  anti-imperialist  camp  of the
 plghters for peace.
 For Asian Solidarity:  No  country is
 more popular in India than China; from no
 other country we have  to learn as much
 as  from China.

 - Close Indo-Chinese diplomatic coopera-
 tion can become a decisive factor in  Asian
 liberation and for  World  peace. Close
 Indo-Chinese economic and cultural coopera-
 tion  will  strengthen people's welfare in
 both countries and advance their respective
 national cultures.
 No patriotic Indian will even. say that
 our Government has done its duty by Korea,
 if he knew the nature and  the extent of the
 American atrocities in Korea. Nehru Govern-
 ment is putting its weight behind a peaceful
 solution in Korea  but  it has also sent a
 Medical unit from our Army to serve  the
 American  aggressors.  It  is a shameful
 contradiction between word and deed.  The.
 Indian Medical unit must be summoned back
 home or asked to serve the  tortured Koreans and
 not their torturers.
 The Gurkhas cannot be sent as British
 mercenaries  to fight the  Malay guerillas
 without the consent and co-operation of the
 Indian Government.    They are being rec-
 ruited on                           Indian soil.  This  has  to be
 stopped in future.  Those already in Malaya
 have to be recalled by persuading Nepal
 Government and      letting it be known that
 they  will   not  be  allowed    passage back
 to Nepal over Indian territory if the Nepal
 Government   insists  on   servility  to  the
 British Imperialists and   refuses to  listen
 to brotherly Indian advice.
 For  Peaceful Indo-Pak        Relations:
 It is nonsense to speak of fighting for world
 peace and let Indo-Pak relations drift the
 way they are doing.  In fact, solving the
 Indo-Pakistan problems is the specific con-
 tribution we have to make to                               the  cause
 of world  peace,   as  well  as to disrupt
 the Imperialist plans to provoke and weaken
 us both and themselves come in as arbitrators
 to force us to align with them.
 The crux of Indo-Pak relations is the issue
 of Kashmir.
 The Anglo-American plan to plant  foreign
 troops  and  impose  an  imperialist Arbitrator
 under the cover of U. JV. 0.    must be resisted
 at all costs despite the acceptance of the proposals
 by the Pakistan Government.
 A just solution of the Kashmir issue can
 only be  based on  the acceptance  of the
 following principles:
 ANTI-IMPERIALISM,   i.  e.,  no   acceptance
 of foreign  troops   to  be  stationed inside
 Kashmir under any cover.
 SELF-DETERMINATION,      i.  e.,    the people
 of Kashmir themselves to decide the issue
 of accession through a democratic and free
 plebiscite.
 FAIR  ELECIONS,   guaranteed   under   the
 supervision of a Commission of the full Se-
 curity Council; this and not a Commission
 appointed by the Anglo-American majority
 will be impartial.
 It is a hard battle and who would expect
 a, peaceful solution of the knottiest problem
 created by the Imperialists except through
 a sustained successful effort for the accep-
 tances of just principles by the two Govern-
 ments ?
 The national economy of both our coun-
 tries has been distorted,  our peoples are
 suffering want and our traditional trade
 links have been disrupted by the British
 imposed partition.  All hindrances to res-
 toration of mutual trade must be removed
 in the interests of our peoples  and. for the
 lessening of the existing tension.
 `National Security in Danger" is the war-
 cry of reactionaries on both the sides.                                                                  The
 Imperialists are biding their time to impose
 a Defence Pact under their own  auspices
 and link up the coordinated Indo-Paksstan
 defence with their own world plans.  Our
 answer can only be:
 1.  An Indo-Pakistan  Pact  of  Lasting
 Friendship and Mutual Assistance against all
 foreign aggressors.
 2.  Non-aggression Pacts with all our nei-
 ghbours: Persia, Afgha.nistan, the U. S. S. R.,
 China and Burma.
 Economic Cooperation with  all coun-
 tries that will trade with  us on equal terms
 and aid our industrial development without
 political strings.  The contrast between the
 Colombo Plan and  the Sino-Soviet  Eco-
 nomic Pact needs to be nationally popular-
 ised. The contrast between the American and
 Chinese terms for food has laid the basis for
 mass realisation of the fact that only from our
 anti-imperialist allies we will get fair terms
 and real aid to build our national economy.
 Their aim and ours
 The   Imperialist   aim   vis-a-vis   our
 country has been graphically ' described by
 the American ace columnist Walter Lippman
 in the following words:
 "India's manpower and material resources....
 must be recognised.... Without India's support
 the British positions might have  been untenable
 in the last, war.  In another war the American-
 British Position  becuase o; their weak manpower
 strength would be even worse."

 Mr. Loy Henderson at New Delhi
 ALMOS T in every notable happening in
 India's Capital these days there is a
 hand discernible. It is the hand of a master
 intriguer, who has the support of influential
 circles  inside  and  outside  the   Govern-
 ment  and                        has unlimited resources at his
 disposal.
 Nearly two years ago, in early 1949, the
 Tass News Agency of the U.S.S.R. in India
 published a book, called "The Truth About the
 American Diplomats"  by  Annabelle Bucar.
 A  Connought Circus    pavement  bookshop
 displayed the  book along  with numerous
 other   publications ranging  from  books
 by Katheleen Norris,  O.  Henry andothers
 to Moscow  editions          of Marx, Engels,
 fn.  A rather
 flashily dressed
 American  passed  that way and
 looked attentively at Bucar's booki n
 and put   it aside.  The Sardar
 who owned the bookshop, consistent with the
 usually obliging methods of the Connaught
 Circus shopkeepers, thought that  the Sahib
 has not liked that book on America and so
 showed him another volume, this time an
 American publication, entitled "1,000 Ameri-
 cans" by George Seldes, which- incidentally
 is a thorough exposure of the supposed freedom
 of the press in  America.  This, somehow,
 infuriated the representative of the "American
 Way of Life".  He became wild.  " How can
 you sell such trash?" he yelled. He pointed to
 the volumes by Marx and Lenin and demanded
 an explanation from the poor Sardar: "How can
 you sell these? Is there nobody to arrest you?"
 It transpired that Mr. Loy Henderson had
 just               then arrived in New Delhi as the U. S.
 Ambassador to India and was much irritated
 by his exposure through the timely publication
 by the TASS of Annabelle Bucar's book which,
 no doubt, had a very successful sale in the
 capital.  The Yankee, who got so angry, was
 one of the host of attaches and officers who
 had accompanied Loy Henderson  to India
 and whose  numbers  have  since increased
 in geomteric progression,  so that today they
 have come to occupy more than three pages
 of the Delhi District Telephone Directory !
 What is significant, however, is that this
 minion of Loy Henderson questioned the right
 of an Indian national to sell works by Marx
 and Lenin and wondered why the shopkeeper
 Lenin and Sta
 American
 had not been arrested l Later developments
 revealed that the prime object of this and the
 other American `diplomats' headed by Loy
 Henderson himself, in coming to India was
 nothing but to interfere in India's internal
 affairs, to make the Nehru Government fall
 in line with the designs and the requirements of
 the war-mongering American big business.
 What has been Henerson's modus operandi
 for the achievement of this object ? The solu-
 tion to this question would be found in the
 personality of the man himself.
 Long, long ago, on the outbreak of World War 1,
 Henderson, who then was a young man of military
 age, sought refuge in the Red Cross and avoided conscrip-
 tion.                                                                    "The doors of the Red Cross were wide open to
 certain young men
 u ntrigues with excellent con-
 necticris who for one
 nd
 iadid reason or another, most often cowardice,
 not want to fight. And as a Red
 Cross worker, Henderson made his first
 acquaintance with  the   young Sovier Republic and
 immed'ately realised that in the months and years to
 come Communist-batting would pay rich dividends and
 that the U. S. Government  institutions would  be in
 continuous need of "Russian" or rather "anti-Russian"
 specialists.
 Of these `specialists' who have been a legion, it can
 be safely said that, they have among other things, specia-
 lised in the art of discovering the `menace' of Commu-
 nism in all possible nooks and corners of the earth and
 thus utilise the fears of the big business to get profit-
 able assignments and jobs.
 Soon after his early days with the Red Cross, Loy
 Henderson joined the U. S. Foreign Service and was
 sent to the Baltic States where his work was directly
 related to the Soviet affairs. Before the establishment of
 diplomatic relations with the U. S. S. R, in 1933, the U.S
 State  Department recalled him to Washington where
 he laid the ground-work of the organisation which
 handled Soviet-American relations and which has since
 become the Division of East European Affairs. Soon after
 that he went to Moscow along with his associates and
 disciples whom he had indoctrinated in anti Sovietism;
 and under the close direction of Loy Henderson the
 entire U.S. Embassy establishment in the Soviet capital
 became a branch of the notorious O.S.S. (the basic
 American Intelligence organisation).
 After he had got this system under way, Henderson
 went back to Washington in 1938 and remained there till
 1943 as the Assistant Chief of the Division of East Euro-

 IT AIN'T CRICKET
 T. C. SIMMONS,   a  west  cost
 journalist has unearthed a vast inter-
 national plot that involves the Soviet
 Union.  He got his scoop from Paris and
 Brussels, and it concerns "international
 intrigue and skullduggery." The cast
 of characters, according  to Simmons,
 includes "a sinster Egyptian agent, an
 American  foreign   correspondent,  a
 presumably stalwart  General   Motors
 official and, lurking in the background,
 the grim figure of Premier Joseph Vissari-
 onovich Dzugashvili (Stalin).
 Are we ready for  the astounding
 details ? Here goes: "At a recent Brussels
 motor show the star proved to be. the Mosko-
 vich, a Russian-built six passenger   sedan
 selling at $980."
 *
 AS IF  THIS   were not enough,
 Simmons also revealed another awful fact,
 made available to him by the superior
 detective work of Theodore H. White,
 Overseas News  Agency correspondent.
 White made known that the Soviet Union
 is now offering, on the international mar-
 ket, the Olympia typewriters,. "a hand-
 some, blackcased job with keys of dark
 maroon, a dove grey body, and with
 margin releases and sets, shifts, and com-
 plex spacing and guiding equipment."
 The price of the  Olympia is only $25.
 IS THERE no limit to Soviet perfidy?
 What  intrigue!    What skulduggery !
 As Simmons says: "There's nothing like
 competition to keep the West's industrial
 machine running properly but this super
 clut-cate game of the USSR just isn't the
 kind of cricket western entrepreneurs care
 to play."
 Yes, yes, the western "entrepreneurs"
 are rather upset about this whole busi-
 ness.  Competition is all right in its place,
 where you can either control it or elimi-
 nate it.  But when you have to start
 competing with the East, in those areas
 where capitalism doesn't have quite the
 reputation it used to, it's not cricket.
 Above all, we must play cricket !  We
 must  demand our right to pay $3,000
 instead of $980 for an auto!  We refuse
 ean Affairs. i'urning with hatred against the U. S.S.R.,
 ,
 is wishes had the better of his reason at the time of the
 Ger  an attack on the U.S.S.R? and he advised Roosevelt
 that Germany would overrun Russia in a few weeks and,
 'herefore, no closer ties need be established with the
 Soviets inspire of the very obvious common interests of
 the U.S.S.t,., and the U.S.A, in the war against Germany.
 Henderson's magic lamp
 Roosevelt, however, soon realised that Henderson
 was working 'o sabotage cooperation be,ween the U.S.A.
 and the U S.S.R. ar.d so he had him removed front the
 key position in the State Department and sent to Baghdad
 as the United States Minister in Iraq. But the trick which
 had helped Loy Henderson to build his career earlier came
 handy once again. In the words of Annabelle Bucar:
 "Henderson, however, is never at a loss.  He has a ready
 answer to everything. Having come to the home of the Ara-
 bian Nights he, like Aladdin, pulled out his personal magic
 lamp. Presto, there appeared a genie.  Henderson's discovery
 in Iraq was the same discovery he had made elsewhere-the
 red menace".
 And his discovery of the 'Communist menace' in
 Baghdad and the Middle East so endeared him to the
 State Department that he was recalled and made the
 Head of the Division of Middle Eastern Affairs.
 Roosevelt died, Truman stepped in his place.  Came
 1945. Just two days before the Soviet Union went to war
 with Japan, Truman decided to drop the first atom bomb
 on Hiroshima, a decision which the world-famous British
 Atomic Scientist Professor Blackett  has suggested, was
 "not so much the last military act of the second 'world
 war, as the first act of the cold diplomatic war with
 Russia."   Big events were taking place in India.  From
 the Middle East to India is but a short distance and as
 the Head of the Division for Middle Eastern Affairs in
 the U. S. State Department, Loy Henderson's discerning
 eyes soon perceived the growing 'red menace' in that
 vast country.  To make the new set-up in India fall in
 line with the global strategy of the U. S.  Military staff,
 now, became the chief concern of this careerist. And so
 this man, Loy Henderson, came to India.
 to surrender the  privilege  of paying
 $125 for a typewriter instead of $25!
 We are cricketeers !
 If we weaken, we  are liable to find
 ourselves at the  merey of a "sinister
 Egyptian agent," and I  do not mean
 Orson Welles.  This "sinister Egyptian
 agent" to whom Simmons referred is an
 Egyptian business man who offered a
 French importer 20,000 Olympia type-
 writers at $25 each.  Had he offered the
 French importer 20,000  Corona type-
 writers at $125 each.   I assure you he
 would not have been at all sinister.
 TO BRING  PRICES  within the
 reach of the people is not cricket.  It
 isn't football.  It isn't baseball. It's just
 one aspect of socialism.

 York, on Tuesday, February 27, 1951)

 in his new surroundings Henderson was
 not without friends.  The Shridharanis  (of
 "My India, My America" fame), the Masanis,
 the Rangas and others of the clan of "Washing-
 ton Patriots" were already active. Henderson,
 to his amazement and pleasure, found a very
 large  number of  `top' Indian  politicians
 who were almost as conerned, if not more,
 at the growing `red menace' as he himself was.
 Though possessing an unusual talent for per-
 sonal intrigue, Mr.                          Henderson has an ex-
 terior which belies this talent and leads those
 who do not know him intimately to consider
 him an honest and frank human being.  And
 so with the Shridharanis and the Masanis,
 with the sympathetic `top' politicians, and with
 his own capacity for double-talk, Loy Hender-
 son soon became the leading foreign diplomat
 in the Capital, who could at any time pick
 up the phone and fix appointments with any
 Minister or official of the Government of India.
 The 'teas' at Birlaji's
 And soon enough the court-circulars  of
 the then Governor-General, His  Excellency
 Sjt. C. Rajagopalchari  began to announce
 more and more frequent audiences with Loy
 Henderson.  It transpired that the U.S. State
 Department gradually got more and more
 impressed by the `wisdom' of    Rajaji and
 Henderson recieved an increasing number of
 State Department requests for Rajaji's advice
 and guidance on questions connected with the
 South-East Asian and Far Eastern Affairs!
 But a lot went on behind the scenes of
 which people 'generally have no knowledge.
 Birlaji also became very friendly with Hender-
 son and after that it was the easiest thing for
 Henderson to get an audience with any Cong-
 ress leader through Birlaji's good offices.  An
 invitation to tea at Birlaji's palace would be
 something which no Congress leader could
 refuse and at the tea-table would invariably
 be found Birla's American ` friend' to talk
 things over.  Specially frequent and numerous
 were the friendly chats between Birla, Loy
 Henderson  and      the then Home  Minister
 and Deputy Prime Minister, the late Sardar
 Vallabhbhai Patel.
 In his public pronouncements the -Ameri-
 can Ambassador was never tried of expressing
 the profound solicitude of the United States
 for India.  Time and again he harped on the
 Fulbright Act, the Smith-Mundt Act and the
 `Point Four legislation. Explaining that the
 purpose of the first two acts was to promote
 better understanding between the people of
 the United States and those of India, Henderson
 announced at Roorkee on November 25, 1950
 that "almost 100 Indian and American nation-
 als will be making use of those funds by the end
 of this year.  Over 60 Indian students and
 professors have already left for the the United
 States with the assistance of the Fulbright
 rupee funds and the dollar funds provided
 by the Smith-Mundt Act". He further added :
 "The two programmes  combined  might
 enable a total exchange of over 300 persons
 in 1951, and about 75 Americans are expected
 to come to India."
 This, then, became the method by which
 the U.S. Embassy Staff, studded with the
 O.S.S. Agents, came in touch with young
 Modesty!
 AMERICAN IMPERIALIST CREDO
 The following is taken from an editorial
 which appeared in the Los Angeles Times
 on October 2, 1950, headlined : "It's no
 time for us to be Modest"
 ,,The United States has won another
 war-that, in naked simplicity is
 the matter which confronts our lea-
 ders in the associated fields of diplo-
 macy, economics,  philosophy and
 armed might.
 "Despite the fiction of carrying
 out a U. N. police action, we  have
 a clearer claim to write our own
 ticket than in 1918 or even in 1945.
 For we have not only become the
 mightiest of military  nations, we
 also stand as the fountainhead of the
 world's  diplomatic  leadership, of
 the world's wealth and even of the
 world's thought.
 "Who else dominates the seven
 seas and air above them?  Whose
 diplomats   control  every positive
 move of the 57-member United Na-
 tions and the left-out nations, such
 as Germany,  Japan  and  Spain?
 Where is there a continent or even an
 island which is not on our aims list?
 And what else, except made-in-Ame-
 rican democracy, is the over-riding
 philosophy and aspiration    of the
 known universe?

 Somebody's got to be boss ... What
 are we waiting for?"

 Indian University students and their guardians.
 Boys of `respectable' families were selected
 for studies in America where the more `reliable'
 ones are being trained for `more reliable'
 work! Through the same medium American
 O.S.S. agents are coming to India and settling
 down at all sorts of places for their 'studies'
 and for  doing `fundamental research'. In
 reality, these gentlemen are mapping out
 India for any future contingency.
 Network of American agents
 As to how widespread  exactly is the network
 of American agents in India at present,  it is diffi-
 cult to say .  But that it is considerably wide, that
 it has corroded the highest civilian in the New Delhi
 ,Secretariat, that there is hardly anything regarding
 our armed forces which the Americans are not aware
 of, and that even the Cabinet discussions and secrets
 leak out to them are things which are now the subject
 of everyday gossip in the New Delhi society.
 Our American `friends', it seems, have
 been collecting  most  detailed information
 about the Trade Unions and the different
 political parties in the country. A well-informed
 journalist friend of the author of this article
 went so far as to say that the Americans have
 in their records a complete list of the members
 of the Communist Party of India upto the level
 of the District Committees.
 Recently there was the story of the Food
 Cable by 43 members of the Indian Parliament
 and it is now well-known that the draft of the
 cable was prepared by none else than Mr. Loy
 Henderson and that the Food Minister Munshi
 was fully aware of this fact.
 Even more recent was the so-called Congress
 for Cultural Freedom at Bombay where under
 the patronage of Ministers Munshi and Ambed-
 kar and of the leaders of the Indian Socialist
 Party, notorious agents of the American State
 Department  like  Burnham,  Spender  and
 Norman Thomas misused Indian hosptality by
 spitting venom against the Peace Policy of the
 Nehru Government and abused and slandered
 the Indian Communists and the Soviet Union
 to their hearts'  content.  That Mr. Loy
 Henderson's hand and the Carnagie Trust's
 funds were behind this Conference, is an open
 secret.
 Hendersson's conquest of Indian Press
 Some people have described these as the
 greatest successes hitherto achieved by Henderson
 in India.  However, in the opinion of more
 competent observers, Henderson's greatest success
 lies in his conquest of the Indian press.  As the
 New. Delhi Correspondent .of a contemporary
 has written : "The Indian Press directly or indirectly
 is becoming the mouth piece of America".
 It is not very difficult to understand the
 anxiety of the Indian Press Barons to estab-
 lish closest possible links with the Americans.
 We have already referred to the close friendship
 between  Henderson  and Birlaji.  Recently
 the Goenka-Deshbandhu Gupta combine has
 also joined hands with the Americans. Desh-
 bandhu Gupta's "Indian News Chronicle", which
 has on its staff a swaggering young fellow
 who has just returned after a course of `training,
 in U.S.A.',  is openly  pro-American.  The
 same press is now printing "The   American
 Reporter", the propaganda-rag of the American
 Embassy at Delhi.   A Hindi weekly of the
 same name has also made its     appearance
 recently for which nearly a dozen Hindi
 journalists have been employed on rather
 strikingly high salaries.
 And now Dalmia's papers have also begun
 to play the American tune.  The dramatic
 exit of Rana Fang Bahadur Singh, prominent
 for his pro-Soviet and pro-China views and
 an active participant in the Peace Movement,
 from the editorship of Delhi "Times of India"
 has been a necessary sequel of the new align-
 ment.
 The list of the : `American' papers in India,
 however, will not be complete without men-
 tioning the weekly "Thought" of Delhi which,
 it is reported, does not sell much and carries
 no advertisements worth the name, but still
 manages to pay very high salaries to the "in-
 tellectuals of Royist inclinations" employed
 on its staff.  It is widely known in the news-
 paper world that "Iplies " is entirely depen-
 dent upon its American friends.  It might
 also be mentioned that it was "Thought" which
 took the lead in organising that blatantly pro-
 American propaganda show called the Cong-
 ress for Cultural Freedom.
 Prior to the establishment of the U. S.
 Embassy in Moscow in 1933, Loy Henderson
 had selected a group of `smart' young men for
 being trained as Russian experts. One of these,
 George F.  Kennan by name, was Minister
 at the U.S.A. Embassy at Moscow, when the
 second world war ended. In his book "Conspiracy
 against Peace", the English journalist Ralph
 Parker records that on seeing the jubilant
 Moscow crowds from the Embassy window,
 Kennan said grimly: "They are cheering....
 They think the war is over, but it is only just
 beginning." This man Kennan is now a Coun-
 sellor of the State Department in Washington
 and in the absence of Loy Henderson its

 'Chief Russian Expert.  He wrote an article
 under the caption  "Is War with Russia In-
 evitable?" in "The Readers' Digest", of March,
 1950.  Introducing him "The Readers' Digest'
 wrote:  "As chief of the State Department's
 planning staff, he was responsible for the cold
 war plan of containinq. Communism in Europe
 and was one of the originators of the European
 Recovery Programme' .  In this article which
 was very widely publicised by the American
 Press, George Kennan laid down the strategy
 of American State Depatment.   Incidentally
 it also reveals and explains the role of Kennan's
 erstwhile colleague and "guru", Loy Henderson
 in India.
 Said Kerman: "We must continue to take an intelli-
 gent and helpful interest in the efforts of people every-
 where to withstand the sort of pressures which are
 brought to bear against them from the Moscow Comm-
 unist side.  It means that we must continue the policy
 of throwing our weight into the balnce wherever there
 are relatively good chances that it will be effective in
 preventing the further expansion of the power of inter-
 national Communism."
 Tandon's statement about Tibet
 And so it was that when in January last
 Pandit Nehru refused to beat the war-drum
 following the march in certain eastern parts
 of Tibet by the Chinese People's Liberation
 Army, Loy Henderson, out to throw his weight
 into the balance, quickly arranged a meeting
 over the usual tea at Birla's New Delhi House
 with Shri Purushottam Das Tandon, the Cong-
 gress President.  And two days later Tandonji
 came out with a statement repudiating all
 his previous protestations of friendship with
 China (e.g., in his Presidential address at the
 Nasik Session of the Congress) and roundly
 condemned China s new regime.  The "good
 chances" were further extended. Henderson's
 good boy Masani gave Tandonji a heap of
 propaganda pamphlets on.Korea and did his
 best to make the old man 'come out openly
 agsinst Nehru's policy of peace.
 Contacts with R. S. S. and Hindu Sabha
 The other day a very old and leading
 Gandhite Congress leader of Uttar Pradesh was
 telling me that he had come to know from
 very reliable sources that Loy Henderson
 had already succeeded in establishing `necess-
 ary  contacts' with certain sections of the
 Hindu Mahasabha and the R. S. S. leader-
 ships.  Some of the leaders of these two organi-
 sations have already met Henderson and they
 hope to receive lavish help from him.  It will
 not be very surprising if Dr. Shyamaprosad
 Mukerji's new party also proves to be a product
 of the same confabulations.
 The above-mentioned Gandhite Congress
 leader then said with real feeling that what
 was troubing him even more than this news
 about the R.S.S. and the Hindu Mahasabha
 leaders was the fact that even the Socialist
 leaders like jai Prakash Narain and Asoka
 Mehta were following in the footsteps of
 Masani and Munshi.
 And with the Socialists too !
 The concern and the sorrow of this veteran
 Congress leader had been still further intensi-
 fied by the news which had recently appeared
 in the press and which had said that the Ameri-
 can "socialist" leader Norman Thomas had
 promised to secure large-scale financial help
 L'or the Indian Socialist Party. Incidentally, it
 might be mentioned that Mr. Norman Thomas'
 `Socialist' Party can count its members on
 finger-tips, but it has huge funds placed at
 its disposal by the State Department.
 Thus,  Mr. Loy Henderson has thrown
 his net far and wide. From the R.S.S. leaders
 to the Socialists, from the Rangas to the Am-
 bedkars, from the weekly rag "Thought" to
 the powerful and established newspaper-com-
 bines, from the Indian Government Officials
 to the Congress President, every vital point
 in the public life and the administration of our
 country is a target of his "activities".
 Mani target-Nehru's Peace Policy
 Loy Henderson's immediate objective is to defeat
 Nehru's Policy of Peace.  Nehru's Peace Policy
 today has became one of the greatest obstacles in the
 war plans of the American imperialists.  It is for
 this reason that America is going all out to organise
 its Fifth Column in India and is even manouvring
 to get its own candidates elected in the next general
 elections.
 There are two prongs of the American
 attack on India.  One is the political black-
 mail from outside on questions like Kashmir
 and the American food aid to India.       The
 other prong is the organisation of a network
 of American agents inside India.
 All those who want to see India    develop
 into a really free, sovereign and economically
 independent republic,  and who want to save
 India from being used as a cats-paw by the
 Western Imperialists for their war-plans, must
 be vigilant with regard  to these  activities
 of this `guest' of ours, Mr.  Loy  Henderson,
 and must fight against them .               -

 SRI VATSYAYAN'S CONGRESS AND HINDI WRITERS
 T HE recent Congress for Cultural Freedom
 at Bombay was remarkable for the
 absence from its deliberations of the cultural
 leaders of the country.
 Its chief organizer was Shri S. H Vatsyayan,
 a Hindi writer of some eminence with a sweet
 tongue and rather persuasive ways.  With a
 little window-dressing and some deliciously
 vague phrases about "culture" and "freedom,"
 Shri Vatsyayan had easily succeeded in making
 a number of notable Hindi writers to agree
 to sponsor and attend his Congress.
 However, with every new statement of
 Shri Vatsyayana, the real aims of the Chief
 Organiser and the powers acting from behind
 him., became clearer, and many-nay, almost
 all Hindi writers of any importance, dropped
 the idea of attending the Congress.  Only
 one, Syt.  Narendra Sharma actually attended it
 but only to walk out in protest against the
 anti-Soviet resolution moved by the organisers.
 And the speeches of  Minister      Munshi
 and the American `guests', as  well    as the
 resolutions passed by the Congress, removed
 the last lingering doubts of the Hindi writers
 about the real purpose of Shriyut S. H.
 Vatsyayan  and  his  Congress for Cultural
 Freedom.  I have tried to find out the views
 of some of the eminent Hindi writers about
 this either by meeting them or by correspond-
 dence.                          Here are the opinions of a few of them.
 Rahulji's Letter
 Rahu ji wrote to me as follows :
 I read in the papers too about the Cultural Free-
 dom Congress, meeting in Bombay. Is it any good com-
 plaining against American Imperialists for it? It is
 through them that Capitalism in its death-throes is
 fighting for its survival!  How can the good of the
 millions suit the palate of these age-old tyrants who
 have tasted blood?  But the most amazing thing was
 the association of the Indian Socialist leaders with
 this Congress.  Has malice rendered them altogether
 purblind?  Is it America that is the biggest sheet-
 anchor of Socialism now ?  Do the 800 million
 strong Socialist countries of the Eurasian mainland
 compare unfavourably with America? Is it that the
 interests of Indian Socialism lie not with their
 neighbouring brothers of Eurasia but with American
 Imperialism?  Who can doubt now that America
 has left no stone unturned to start the third world
 war that would mean _the total destruction of all
 culture?  About those who cannot understand this,
 I can only say, that they are either mad or they have
 nothing whatever to do with truth.  There is only
 one answer to this: the unity of all the left forces and
 all progressive-minded people should be built up as
 speedily as possible.
 The letter is quite eloquent and needs
 no comment.
 Shri Ila Chandra Joshi's opinion
 From the talk with Shri Sumitranandan Pant
 it transpired that he had agreed to sponsor
 the Congress becuase he was given to under-
 stand by S. H. Vatsyayan that it would discuss
 the possibilities and the ways and means of
 having, apart from the political and social
 approaches, a purely cultural approach to
 matters.   However,  the  Congress,  as  it
 stands now before the world, had nothing
 in common with these objectives communicated
 to Pantji and Pantji is, indeed, very much
 disillusioned.  He declined to say much be-
 fore he had talked it over with Shri Vatsyayan;
 but he definitely said that he was not sati-
 sfied with this Congress since it had become
 a forum of      anti-Soviet  hate-propaganda,
 which  was altogether  uncalled  for.  The
 Congress had talked not of culture but of
 fighting Communism which was irrelevant.
 Pantji said that he for one stood for a cultural,
 i.e., peaceful  solution of world's maladies
 and consequently did not     believe in war.
 Therefore, the sabre-rattling that took place at
 the Congress was utterly alien to his mind.
 Pan ji made it plain that he stood for peace and
 culture and believed that war could be checked; but if
 war did break out, he said, we should unhesitatingly
 side with the Soviet.
 It was in this connection that he expressed
 his indignation at the treatment meted out
 to Narendra Sharma at the Congress and said
 that the whole thing was very disgraceful.
 Talk with Pantji
 The verdict of other  writers, too, was
 not different.  For example Syt. Ila Chandra
 Yoshi, till recently the editor of the illustrated
 weekly "Dharma Yuga", who was at Bomaby
 when the Congress took place, said that it was
 a stinking business, this Congress.  He said
 that every one in Bombay, even the most

 ignorant, knew that it was an American show.
 So, no decent man associated  himself with
 it.  Among the people,  there was such a
 strong feeling against the Congress that one
 was afraid of attending it just as one is afraid
 of going to a brothel, for fear of being caught!
 Joshiji said that he knew from the begining that
 'Cultural Freedom' was only a camouflage, that
 the Congress was really concerned with creating a
 cultural war-base in our country..
 Joshiji had been very much pressed to
 join the Congress but he had frankly told the
 organisers of the Congress that at the moment he
 considered all talks of cultural freedom and
 the like as stuff and nonsense, that any amount
 of this camouflage was not going to stop the
 people from ushering in the Socialist order of
 things.  He may have his differences with the
 Soviets, but of this he was thoroughly convinced
 that the Soviets had taken the first big step
 towards real culture in as much as they had
 equalised the social  status of the people and
 had freed them from the daily cares of Hunger
 and Nakedness.
 Therefore, Joshiji said, he stood for communism
 as the first step towards the  liberation of in-an's
 energies for a future of limitless possibilities.
 He said that if the Conference had succeeded in
 doing anything it was in exposing men like Jaya
 Prakash Narayan and Vatsyayan who now stood
 before the people in their true colours.

 so that we all may lighten the dark recesses
 of our mind, renew our faith in and reforge

 ously and unitedly resume the march forward
 to final victory.
 Linked as our ruling circles are with the Anglo-
 American imperialist circles,  pro-imperialist
 and anti-Soviet, anti-democratic and reaction-
 ary proganda is being freely let loose. Reaction
 has strengthened its grip over all the channels
 and   sources of  propaganda  and popular
 education-Press, Radio and  educational ins-
 titutions.   Progressive intellecuals  are being
 starved, denied opportunities and forced to
 surrender to. the ruling clique.

 the national progressive tradition and ruthlessly
 expose all pro-imperialist, reactionary ideologies
 and  their protaganists.  INDIA  TO-DAY
 Amrit Rai  is a young Marxist Hindi
 writer, and editor of monthly HANS.  To-
 gether with another young Hindi poet, Nemi
 Chandra Jain he will be reporting to our readers
 every month on the cultural developments in
 the Hindi-speaking world.
 Mahadeviji and Bachchamji
 Sint. Mahadevi  Verma and Shri  Bachchan
 also spoke in the same vein.  Mahadeviji said
 tht she had long ago smelt a rat in it and now,
 of  course,  everything  was  clear as  day.
 Bachchanji said that after the speeches made
 at the Congress there could not be a shadow
 of doubt that the Congress was  American-
 inspired and American-financed.
 All of us being Hindi writers, the sordid fact
 of Syt.  Vatsyayan's leading role in it inevitably
 cropped up in our talk again and again, and
 here it is my duty to put on record that people
 in general  feel  about  Vatsyayan that he
 convened this Congress because he had some
 axe of his own to grind. Yes, they said it.
 And so that is how the Hindi intellectual world
 reacted to  this American propaganda-show,
 which ended so dismally, as Auden's Gum Eliot
 put it, not with a bang but with a whimper.
 It, however, augurs well for the camp of
 peace and   democracy.   It shows that the
 building up of the cultural united front in
 our land is on the order of the day.
 [Continued from Page 2]
 will help to  unite all progressive cultural
 workers to meet the challenge of reaction, save
 our youth from ideological corruption and our
 people from demoralisation and initiate a new
 national cultural renaissance based on anti-
 imperialist democratic foundations and truly
 reflecting  the problems of India and the
 world in which we live.
 To start INDIA TO-DAY on our own would
 have been too venturesome, if not a sign of
 intellectual conceit. But we have been promised
 full  cooperation by a number of eminent
 writers   and  scientists  and  a  team  of
 younger   Marxist intellectuals as well as by
 a large number of the organisers of the mass
 movements in various parts of our country.
 We hope to make it a real collective effort
 of Indian Marxists and progressives.
 With the light of Marxism to show us
 our path, for people's life and nation's liberty,
 we will make our contribution to the grand
 common cause of world peace and liberation.

 Anglo-American Intervention in places
 thousands of miles from their own frontiers
 KOREA
 4,980 miles from the U.S.
 28 million inhabitants. 79,200 square
 miles.  The   Americans  opposed  the
 unification of the country and maintained
 the police regime of Synghman Rhee south
 of the 38th parallel.  There were 85,000
 arrests over the last 7 months before the
 war began. There were 100,000 partisans
 in the South.  In the North, the People's
 Republic  was  fulfilling the  people's
 aspirations.   The  Americans provoked
 war and came out into open aggression
 against Korea  where     they  savagely
 slaughtered the civilian population.
 MALAYA
 8,400 miles from the U.S.
 5 million inhabitants.  47,200 square
 miles.   1,20,000 British soldiers  and
 70,000 police are fighting the partisans
 (with a #200 bonus for every partisan
 killed). Ganapathy, the Indian General
 Secretary of the Malayan trade unions,
 was murdered in his prison cell in Singa-
 pore and his successor was also brutally
 murdered  by the British.
 VIET-NAM
 7,800 miles away from the U.S.
 21 mil ion inhabitants.  1,13,400 sq.
 miles.  700 billion francs have already
 been poure I out there to keep the Viet-
 Namese peol.le in chains and to main-
 tain bases fc r  aggression                       against  the
 Chinese people. 2,00,000 soldiers (French,
 African and  German)   are    engaged
 in the fight to oppress the Viet-Namese
 people  who for the past 5 years have
 been carrying on an  armed struggle.
 American military missions are being
 sent to Indo-China and a 50 million
 dollar aid has been promised.
 THE PHILIPP4NES
 6,900 miles away from the U.S.
 1,88,50,000 inhabitants. 1,07,740 sq.
 miles.  The Americans have spent 2
 billion dollars to build 23 military bases
 in this country which is under a regime
 of terrible poverty and savage repression.
 The Hukbalahaps  (people's  soldiers)
 have liberated the centre of Luzon which
 is the main island.
 BURMA
 10,200 miles away from the U.S.
 47 million inhabitants. 2,43,967 squire
 miles.  As in Greece,  the  Americans
 are taking over from the British. The
 partisans have been fighting there for
 the past three years and have liberated
 18,000 square miles of their soil. Opera-
 tions against the partisans are directed
 by the Anglo-American military mission.
 GREECE
 4,200 miles from the U.S.
 73,00,000,    inhabitants.  47,770  sq.
 miles. First  British,  then  American
 armed intervention to impose the mona-
 archy on the Greek people.                                                                            An incre-
 dible reign of terror is raging (Makronissos
 concentration camp) which has already
 claimed 20,000 victims.
 [Continued from page no. 16]
 So the simple position is as follows:-
 The Anglo-American Imperialists, without
 active Indian aid  CANNOT wage a suc-
 cessful wrold war.
 India's firm stand for  peace
 together
 ,
 with the mighty U. S. S. R. and China
 can lay the spectre of World War III.
 j A  Tripartite Indo-Chinese-Soviet  Alliance,
 can successfully bury American plans for world
 domination, guarantee lasting peace                     and push
 the wheel of human history decisively forward
 and speed up liberation and every nation of demo-
 cracy for the common man  and pave                                                                                           the path
 towards the realisation of World Socialism when
 war and want will become stories, from a historical
 past.
 Such is the glorious  prospect  before
 the Indian national  movement once its
 advanced democratic elements unite to make
 the Indian Peace Movement BROADER than
 our old national movement ever was.
 Let the best from our anti-imperialist,
 internationalist traditions of  our national
 movement stir the soul.
 Let the shame of  seeing  our  ancient
 country tied to the Imperialist chaxiot-wheel
 sting us to the quick.
 Let the love for our own near and dear
 ones make us fight for peace and  against
 the war-mongers.
 The rest will follow.

 Monopolists Fear Peace Because.....
 War is the
 most profitable
 business
 W WAR involves death and destruction for
 millions of human beings, but it is a
 damned profitable business for a few.
 Every American tank and plane operating
 in Korea, every bomb dropped  on Korean
 towns and villages, mean enormous profits for
 the American armaments manufacturers.
 Businessmen of the New York Stock-Exchange
 literally danced with joy when Truman an-
 nounced his "state of emergency" on December
 16, 1950.  Commenting on this, the Associated
 Press, under the heading   00 New York Stock-
 Exchange Record " wrote:
 " The mobilization of American economy
 resulted in shares on the New York Stock-
 Exchange going up on Monday by more than
 4,800,000 dollars the highest figure in 11 years.".
 "Business week", the influential journal of
 business circles wrote on December 9, 1950:
 "A short dip might have been a fair bet as
 long as the military build-up was jogging along
 at a lethargic face.  But now, the huge defence
 (read: War!) programme is a sharp goad on
 the industry."
 Exorbitant prices of armaments
 More will be spent on war measures in the
 US this year than in the entire five preceding
 years, and for the 1951-52 fiscal year, Truman
 has asked for 71 billion dollars for war purposes;
 that is, 74 per cent of the entire Budget!
 The big trusts of the'war industry, of course,
 are reaping the benefis: no less than 60 per cent
 of the war Budget will be pocketed by them in
 MILLIONS FOR FORD
 THE Ford Motor Co. has announced
 that it has received an order
 from  the US  army to  build  an
 estimated 195 million dollors' worth
 of medium tanks at a plant to be
 erected in the Detroit area. .

 Footnote:  Henry Ford left an estate
 admitted to be worth 80 million dollars.
 the form of payment for military orders.  They
 arc demanding an exorbitant price for their
 lethal products, a price far in excess of even
 the usual high rate.  For instance:
 In 1945, an automatic carbine rated 3.55
 dollars whereas, today, its price is 64 dollars.
 At the end of World War II, a quick-firing
 rifle cost 134 dollars; today, its price has gone
 up to 358 dollars.
 The price of a machine-gun for the same
 period has increased from 249 to 720 dollars,
 and that of a heavy mortar from 590 to 1055
 dollars.
 The price of a truck has increased from 2,500
 to 5,900 dollars, that of a 105 mm. gun from
 8,300 to 13,700 dollars, that of a light tank from
 39,600 to 126,000 dollars.
 Huge and quick profits
 From this we see how the merchants of
 death are raking in huge profits; their agents
 in the Government paying any price asked for
 at the expense of direct and indirect taxes
 imposed on the people.
 The "New York Times" reported on October
 27, 1950, that the General Motors Corpora-
 tion realised in the first nine months of 1950 a
 greater net profit than was ever recorded by
 any American corporation in a full year.
 Between June 1940 and March 1943 alone,
 the U.S. Government placed war orders with
 this firm to the sum of 8,500 million dollars,
 as well as orders for building at least 100 new
 enterprises.

 War-time profits from both sides of front
 DURING World War II, General Motors
 made a net profit of 1,253 million dollars.
 It netted profits on both sides of the front: in
 America and in Germany.
 In the pre-war dollar invasion of Germany,
 among the enterprises which fell into the hands
 of General Motors was the Opel works in
 Russelsheim which, in addition to tanks, pro-
 duced for the Hitler army enormous quantities
 of essential parts for the Messerschmitt, Junk-
 ers and Fokke-Wolff planes.
 Right until the middle of 1941, prominent
 U.S. representatives of General Motors were
 members of the Board of the Opel Corporation.
 Even after Hitler had declared war on
 USA, General Motors continued to collaborate
 with the Nazis.  But, as they could not do this
 openly during the closing years of the war, they
 appointed their Danish representative (Albin.
 D. Madsen) as their repsentative with Opel
 Built up Hitler's tank and air forces
 ACCORDING to "Poor's Manual" (refer-
 ence book on US industry) in the years
 when Hitler's army was being equipped, 20
 million dollars of the enormous profits netted
 by the Opel enterprises belonging to General
 Motors were invested in other Nazi corporations
 producing armaments.  Without Opel (that is,
 without  General Motors), the Hitler tank
 divisions and the Hitler Luftwaffe would never
 have been what they were.
 After the war, General Motors was able to
 place its representatives in key positions in the
 American military administration in Germany,
 and General Motors' Opel works are thriving
 again on rearmament.
 Du Pont chemical trust
 THE real significance of General Motors in-
 vasion of Europe must be sought in its
 financial tie-up with Du Pont.
 This  chemical  trust, the  biggest in the
 capitalist world, was intimately linked, through
 cartels and patent agreements, with I. G.
 Farben-the economic and political bulwark
 of the Hitler State. Du Pont controls the
 greater part of the shares of General Motors.
 The Du Pont concern helped to arm Japan
 for war against China and sold to Mitsui con-
 cern patents for explosives.  For years, Du
 Pont has been netting enormous profits from
 the production of atom bombs.
 They make both guns and governments
 It was General Motors boss Charles E.
 Willson whom, last December, Truman invest-
 ed with dictatorial powers to mobilise  the
 economy.
 Dean G. Acheson, the American Secretary
 of State is a lawyer, a member of a Washington
 firm that is general counsel for Ethyl Corp.,
 jointly owned by Du Pont's General Motors
 and Rockefeller's Standard Oil of New Jersey.
 He entered the State Department in 1941, and
 helped formulate the Truman Doctrine, the
 Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Pact.
 Previously his clients had included some of the
 largest oil, munitions, radio and telephone cor-
 porations in the country.
 John Foster Dulles, the Political Adviser
 to the State Department, who played a major
 role in starting the War in Korea, is the senior
 partner in the law firm of Sullivan and Crom-
 well, of Wall Street, the most powerful of Ameri-
 can corporation lawyers, serving -Morgan and
 Rockefeller, and is a director of International
 Nickel Co. of Canada, Ltd.  (Morgan  and
 Rockefeller). Through Sullivan and Cromwell,
 he had close relations with the I. G. Farben
 interests in Germany, and with the German
 law firm of Albert and Wertriele, who handle
 the business of the German subsidiaries of
 International Telegraph and Telephone Co.
 (Morgan).
 The Secretary of Defence, General George
 C. Marshall, who was Secretary of State from
 1947 to, 49, and was the author of the Truman
 Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, is a director
 of Pan-American Airways, a combination of
 Morgan, Rockefeller and Mellon interests.
 Deputy-Secretary of Defence Robert  A.
 Lovett, is a partner in the Wall Street Invest-
 ment Banking firm of Brown Bros. and Harri-
 man Co. (Morgan and Rockefeller), a director
 of Morgan's New York Life Insurance Co.,
 and of the Union Pacific Railway.
 Similarly, General Douglas MacArthur,
 till recently the Supreme Boss of Japan, For-
 mosa, Phillippines and the occupied portions
 of Korea, has wide financial and industrial
 interests in. the Phillippines and Japan.
 Through these and such other agents, the
 big armament manufacturers in America are in
 a position to directly influence and mould the
 policies of the Government and they are taking
 good  care to keep up  the war-hysteria in
 America and the cold War in the international
 affairs, and are trying their worst to spread the
 flames of the Korean War to China.

 The Indian delegate reports
 the World Women's Meet at Berlin
 WOMEN
 AGAINST WAR
 In the first week of February this year, 300
 leading women of the world, representing over
 nine crores of organsied women of all parts of
 the globe, gathered in Berlin for the meeting
 of the Council of the Women's Interna-
 tional Democratic Federation.   The
 Indian delegate reports the  meeting to the
 readers of INDIA TODAY
 OUR plane touched the ground and we
 were in Berlin.  The airport is in the
 British zone.  A girl had come to receive me
 with a car which took us to the Eastern Zone.
 I had expected that the border of the two
 zones would be very heavily guarded.  All
 the P.T.I.-Reuter reports appearing in the
 Indian  newspapers  had always represented
 Berlin as a veritable powder-keg which would
 burst into flames at the first spark.  So, I was,
 naturally, rather surprised to find only three
 or four policemen guarding the border and
 checking the people going to the  Eastern
 Zone-a scene which was in no way different
 from what is an everyday sight at the Bandra
 or Mahim causeway in Bombay where police-
 men make a routine check-up of all traffic.
 A city of ruins
 Berlin has been a city famous for its magni-
 ficent buildings and fine roads.  But now it is
 a heartrending sight.  From the Brandenburg
 Gate to the Potsdamer Platz, from the shell
 of the Reichstag to the razed earth of the
 former Chancellory, on every side of the Unter
 der Linden there is an endless panorama of
 ruins.  The people and the government of
 Eastern Germany are devoting all their ener-
 gies towards the reconstruction of their country
 and specially of their beloved Capital.  But
 that is a Herculean job and  one can even to-
 day see everywhere the evidence of the terrible
 consequences of Hitler's war for Germany.
 Utter chaos of debris stretches over tens of
 square miles and beneath that lie corpses in
 thousands which are still being dug up.   And
 over the ruins one can see huge posters, poin-
 ing towards the debris, saying: "Look at this
 destruction !  This is what war means !"
 The arrangements for our stay had been
 made in the biggest hotel of the city which had
 central heating that kept us warm even in the
 severe winter of February.  And every night
 when we came back from the meeting there
 were always some surprise gifts waiting for
 us in the room-apples, chocolates, sweets and
 sometimes even a packet of cigarettes !
 We were introduced to the Prime Minister
 of the Democratic Republic of Germany,
 Otto Grotewohl.  He told us that under the
 Hitler-regime, for many years the German
 people had been kept completely isolated
 from the democratic and peace-loving people
 of other countries of the world.  Therefore,
 he said, they were very happy to welcome
 in their country representatives of nine crores
 of people from all parts of the   world.
 He assured us that the people of Germany,
 Eastern as well as Western, hated the very
 idea of war and were opposed to the plans of

 td-niilitarisation of Germany.  Recently there
 was a referendum in a big town in West-
 tern Germany on this question and over 88
 per cent of the  population     voted  against
 rearmament.
 One elderly German lady frankly admitted
 that it was a very hard job to educate people
 who had been for years indoctrinated With
 the racial,  chauvinistic,  gangster  ideas of
 Fascism,  into democratic and peace-loving
 citizens. "But we have done the job", she added
 "and will go on doing it."
 The miracle of East Germany
 And from what I saw and heard in Berlin,
 Weimar and other parts of Eastern Germany,
 I could not help agreeing with the old lady.
 It is a real marvel that throughout Eastern Ger-
 many you never hear or read of war.   In London,
 every morning the daily papers would talk
 about nothing else but war and would give
 the impression that a world war was likely to
 break out any moment and that most probably
 it would start in Germany.  But in Germany
 itself, during my ten days' stay, I never had
 this fear grip my heart that the world is
 recklessly heading towards war.
 In fact, there is now  a statutory ban on
 any kind of war propaganda  in  Eastern
 Germany.  In response to the appeal of the
 World Peace Congress, the Democratic Re-
 public of Germany has enacted a law making
 war propaganda a cognizable and severely
 MME. THAELMANN'S MESSAGE
 My dear friends,
 Your visit to Berlin, the capital of Germany,
 for the meeting  of the council of Women's
 International Democratic  Federation,  gave
 me particular pleasure.  It is a great honour
 and a task of great responsibility for the German
 women, to carry on the fight against the war-
 mongers and for friendship between. the peo-
 ples of the different countries of the world.
 In the German Democratic Republic and
 in the democratic section of Berlin the anti-
 fascist democratic social order is being streng-
 thened daily.  Our peace-loving progressive
 Government under the leadership of the work-
 ing class and our president Wilhelm Pieck and
 our Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl have put
 all their strength into the effort of raising the
 living standards of the German working people.
 In the German Democratic Republic, there
 are no unemployed.  We had a two-year plan
 which was over-fulfilled, and since 'January,
 punishable crime.
 "Peace will conquer  War",  '"DER  FRIE-
 DDEN   BESIEGT  DEN KRIEG",                                                                 this solgan hangs
 not only in all Conference halls, but over
 the entire Eastrern Germany and was echoed
 and re-echoed from the throats of thousands
 of young, blond German girls and boys who
 surrounded us at every corner of the city
 with banners and  flowers and the slogans
 of peace.
 I met two unique women in Berlin-one
 was the daughter of the great Clara Zetkin. She
 is now more than sixty and does not speak
 English.  So she just went on shaking my
 hand for a long time.  She wanted to say
 something but no translator was available
 nearby, andI had to content myself with only a
 warm embrace. The other was Rosa Thaelmann,
 the widow of that great leader of the German
 people, Ernst Thaelmann who after eleven years
 of solitary confinement was brutally murdered
 by the Hitlerites on the eve of the liberation
 of Berlin by the Soviet Army.  Rosa Thaelmann,
 also, together with her young daughter, has
 spent many long and terrible years in Hitler's
 concentration camps.  Now she works in the
 Democratic Women's League of Germany.
 She gave me a copy of her      message to the
 women of the world which I am enclosing with
 this letter (see at the bottom of this page-
 Editor).
 From 45 countries, delegates had come
 1951, we are working untiringly for our new
 Five-Year Plan under the slogan "Always ready
 for work and for the defence of peace!"
 Untiringly we are explaining to the Ger-
 man women that the American imperialists are
 planning the same fate for the population of
 Western Germany which they have already
 inflicted upon the people of Korea.  We have
 not forgotten the terrible nights when the
 Americans used to bomb our cities and towns
 during World War II. On February 3rd, 1945,
 during the course of an air attack on the living
 quarters of Berlin by thousands of American
 bombers, not less than 50,000 women and child-
 ren and old and sick people were killed.  That
 is why the progressive women and the mothers
 of Germany from the bottom of their hearts
 hate the American interventionists, who are
 massacring the innocent population of. Korea.
 The German women know and have not
 forgotten how the the Soviet Union, Poland,
 Czechoslovakia, France, Bulgaria,  Rumania,

 to the Council meeting, from the Soviet Union
 and the People's  Democracies of Eastern
 Europe, from U.S.A,  Britain, France  and
 Italy, from Korea, China and the countries
 of the Middle East.
 These women belonged to different political
 trends and religious sects and they were from all
 walks of life.  The simple housewife, the mill-
 hand, the peasant girl, the teacher, the artist
 and the Minister of State -here all sat together
 to discuss the menace of war that is hanging
 over the world and threatens with death every
 darling child of every loving mother.
 The Korean Glory
 There were two  delegates from North
 Korea, Mme. Che Den Zuk, the North Korean
 Minister for Culture and a young girl of twenty
 years who had already gazed into the eyes
 of death while working  as a nurse with the
 Korean People's Army.
 Mme.  Che Den Zuk in her speech said
 that today there were only two  ways open
 before the people of Korea : either to defend
 the independence  of their  country against
 the American invaders, if necessary even with
 bare hands; or to become once   again the
 slaves of a colonial power.  The Korean peo-
 ple have chosen                      the first road and they
 shall not turn from it.  The soil of suffer-
 ing Korea is drenched with blood. The dead
 and many other countries have suffered from the
 German Fascist bandits.
 The best sons and daughters of the German
 people also suffered torture and death in the
 concentration camps and prisons of the same
 gang.  We  owe eternal thanks to the brave
 Soviet Army which liberated us from fascism
 by sacrificing millions of its heroic soldiers.
 - It was the brave sons of the Soviet-land who
 liberated my daughter Irma and myself from
 the concentration camp of Ravenesbrucke.
 Ernst Thaelmann, my comrade and the father
 of my daughter Irma, ?after eleven years of
 solitary confinement, was murdered by the
 fascists shortly before our liberation by the
 Red Army.  In his spirit, my daughter and
 I work in the million strong organisation of
 the D. F. D. (Democratic Women's League of
 Germany)  and   try to  do  our  share in
 the rebuilding of a united and democratic
 Germany.
 I have time and again spoken to the workers
 of the German Democratic Republic in large
 mother with the baby clasped to her breast,
 the corpses of children covered with blood
 and mud, the women mad with  grief, these
 are now a common sight in Korea.  Millions
 have been rendered homeless, lacs have been
 done to death by American bombs, American
 machine-guns  and  American napalm jelly.
 Those who escape the terror-bombings, have
 no food to eat, no clothes to  put on and no
 house to take shelter in.   "But", said Mme.
 Che Den Zuk, "the Korean people-men and
 women alike-are fighting and will continue
 to fight even as the people of Soviet Union
 fought against the Hitlerite invaders."
 Zoya, the martyr Heroine of the Soviet Union
 has inspired many Korean girls to follow her
 example. The Secretary of the Korean Women's
 Democratic League Kin Ran Ok was arrested
 by the Synghman Rhee traitors. They ordered
 her to shout "Long live Synghman Rhee!" She
 replied "No, Rhee is a trator to Korea.  Long
 live the beloved leader of the people, Kim Ir
 Sen." 1 And she died shouting these words.
 In the Kumor mountains, Kan Gur Sun,
 the famous partisan girl single-handed killed
 30 enemy soldiers and enabled her partisan
 unit to  break  out of enemy encirclement.
 Addressing herself to the American and
 English  women,  Mme. Che Den Zuk  said:
 factories like the Maxhutte about our friend-
 ship for the Soviet Union and for the people
 of the People's Democracies, about the vital
 need for the German people to recognize
 the Oder-Neisse frontier as the peace frontier
 between the Polish and the German peoples.
 Our youth, which is organised in the
 Free German Youth works and studies in the
 spirit of Ernst Thaelmann and of the millions
 of fighters for freedom who had to sacrifice
 their lives in the fight against Fascism.
 The heroic Soviet women, the heroic women
 of Korea and China and the brave partisans of
 peace in Italy and France are an example for
 us and  an inspiration  which drives us to
 achieve even more, to unmask the warmongers
 and to safeguard peace for all people.
 The representatives of the nations present at
 this meeting, have given us heartening words.
 Deeply moved, I thank them all for this deep
 experience and I vow that I shall put all my
 strength into the fight for peace.

 "Vou must know the evil things that your
 husbands and brothers are doing in Korea.
 Realise that you too bear the responsibility
 for the murder of lacs of completely innocent
 people. And do not belive that bombs will
 continue to fall on the Asian cities and you
 will be safe in New York and London, that the
 towns and villages of America will never
 have to endure  what the towns and villages
 of our country are  suffering  today.  If
 you want  your children  to be spared the
 horrors of war, fight !  Fight now, to end
 this dirty, senseless war in Korea.  Fight to
 stop your sons, brothers and husbands from
 being sent to death in distant Korea."
 The assembled delegates and the German
 mothers and daughters listened to the repre-
 sentative of the Korean women with tears in
 their eyes, and each one of us vowed within her
 heart to go back to her country and tell every
 woman the tragic but heroic story of Korea.
 Soviet delegate speaks
 The  Soviet delegate Perfenova warned the
 delegates that the American Imperialists having
 suffered a fiasco in Korea were hastily prepa-
 ring to kindle a new war in Europe and were
 re-militarising Western  Germany, planning
 to use German people as their connonfodder.
 "In U. S, A." she said, "the heads of the
 administration, the generals of the army and
 some  journalists  and   editors  are  openly
 calling for Moscow, Leningrad and Baku to
 be atom-bombed.  But in my country, in
 the Soviet Union, the teachers are teaching
 children that besides the America of Truman
 and MacArthur,     there is also an America
 which gave Abraham Lincoln and Fredrick
 Roosevelt to the world, the` America of Paul
 Robeson and Howard Fast and of the American
 fighters for Peace and against the war in
 Korea.  That is the difference between a
 peace-loving real democracy and an imperial-
 ist hot-bed of aggression."
 The Hell that is Greece today
 The Greek delegate charged the American
 war-mongers of having turned her beautiful
 country into a dismal  place of death and
 desolation.  She said that while in name
 the native Monarcho-Fascists ruled over her
 country, in reality Greece was already a colony
 of the Americans, who had established a real
 tyranny over the land.  More than sixty
 thousand Greek patriots-men and women,
 are dying a slow death in the notorious Mak-
 ronissos and other concentration camps and
 prisons.  510  women exiled in the barren
 CIA-RDP83-00415R008500030004-0
 island of Trikeri are living in the open, exposed
 to cold, rain and terrible winter storms.  In
 the prison of Averof 760 women patriots are
 undergoing  unheard of torments.      Amongst
 them, 12 are condemned to death including
 a ninety years old  grandmother who       has
 already given 3 sons to the Freedom movement
 of her country.
 But the women of Greece are resolutely
 struggling for' Peace and indepence of their
 country.  One of the women while signing
 the Stockholm Peace Appeal has written:
 "I sign because of the martyrdom  and humi-
 liation suffered by my people.  I sign because of my
 negro brothers who are being flogged, lynched and
 put to the electric-chair in America.  I sign because
 of my yellow brothers of Korea whose father-land
 is being trampled upon by the boots of the invaders;
 because of Seoul I sign the Stockholm appeal."
 There were  many other speeches and
 reports by the delegates from various countries
 and innumerable messages from Women's
 organisations and distinguished women, in-
 cluding the famous La Passionaria of Spain,
 Mme. Dolores Ibarurry and Mme. Cotton of France.
 The Call to the Governments
 After considerable discussions inside the
 various Commissions the Council unanimously
 passed a resolution addressed to the women
 of the world calling upon them to compel the
 Governments  of their respective countries
 (1) to enact laws banning war propaganda
 in any form;
 (2) to stop spending billions on armaments
 and use that money for increasing social ameni-
 ties ;
 (3) to act for immediate cessation of the
 war in Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign
 troops from there;
 (4) to act for stopping the remilitarisation
 of Germany;
 (5) to stop the persecution of the defenders -
 of Peace.
 The second resolution was about the need
 of strengthening and broadening the movement
 for the defence of children and gave a call
 for the widest possible celebration of an Inter-
 national Children's Day in 1951.
 The other resolutions were about the task
 of building the unity of various  women's
 organisations, the fight against remilitarisation
 of Germany, and the Peace Movement.
 The Indian delegation fully participated
 in the  discussions.  The leading members
 of the Council impressed upon  the Indian
 delegates the great and urgent need of Indian
 30                                                                   INDIA TO-DAY

 Women's organisations formally joining the
 International movement.
 After the meeting was over, the delegates
 dispersed into several groups to tour different
 parts of Eastern Germany.  l went to Weimar.
 The warm and friendly welcome that  we
 received at every small village and town on
 our way was too wonderful to be described. In
 Turania where we had gone to see the Steel
 Factory and the Wilhelm Pieck Nylon Factory,
 the Premier (the  Minister-President, as he is
 called in Germany) of Turania himself welcomed
 us and gave us a dinner, where I was given a
 seat next to him, because, as they said, India
 was such an important and great country.
 The Premier talked to me-an ordinary
 girl from India just like a friend and a comrade.
 He told me that he was a son of the working
 class and had escaped death  ten times and
 that he regretted very much that he did not
 know English and, therefore, could not talk
 directly to the representative of a great country
 like India.
 When I left Germany I was loaded with
 all sorts of presents-two big dolls, a beautiful
 glass flower vase, a broach, a pair of bracelets,
 a chain, numerous books and  albums and
 plenty of sweets and chocolates and so many
 kisses of German women and children.
 I-went to Berlin with a number of prejudices
 against the Germans.  But I found that the
 common people everywhere are the same-
 friendly, peace-loving and affectionate.  And
 I returned with a deep affection in my heart for
 the German women and men.  May be some
 day we shall be able to build a strong women's
 movement in our  country and  invite the
 German women here.

 FACTS
 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW
 INTENSITY OF THE BOMBING
 The American  General Emmeth O'Donnel,
 before leaving Tokyo for the United States, declar-
 ed on January 18 that U.S. Air Forces had dropp-
 ed over Korea 43,000 tons of bombs with "maxim-
 um results".
 43,000 tons since June 25, last year, that is, in
 7 months! This is 3,000 more tons than were drop-
 ped                                over  Germany in the  whole of  1942,  and
 Germany is three times as big as Korea.
 That is, bombing in Korea has been five times as
 intense as that of Germany in 1942.
 President Truman Says :
 "The principles for which we are
 fighting in Korea are right and just."
 Message to Congress, January 8, 1951.
 But Korean women say:
 Dear Friends,
 You who                               desire peace  throughout  the
 world     and a happy  future for                             humanity;
 you who nurture the flame of protest against
 all injustice,                            source  of unhappiness    and
 suffering for humanity, it is to you that we
 address this message from our deserted ruins,
 where the winter lashes the body and chilly
 blizzard relentlessly pierces the thin clothing.
 Our peaceful life has been blasted by the bursts
 of countless American shells....
 The roads are choked with the number-
 THESE ARE American STATISTICS
 US Fifth Air Force statistics give the follow-
 ing provisional summary of civilian casualties by
 the action of the Force: 250,000 dead, 200,000 wou-
 nded, 90,000 missing.  Refugees from bombard-
 ment: 3,000,000 up till December.
 WONZU
 On January 17, the Newspaper Le Monde of
 Paris published following despatch of an American
 Agency, the United Press:
 "Before the withdrawal, every house in Wonzu
 was burnt down, every bridge blown up, every
 scrap of food rendered unfit for consumption.
 Patrols went out into the surrounding countryside
 to set fire to the huts and haystacks.  Roads and
 fields were mined.  Then, after the town had been
 evacuated and the last bridge blown up, artillery
 and aircraft joined up.
 "Today, Wonzu is razed to the ground.  Not
 one section of a wall is left standing to shelter the
 enemy. And within a radius of several miles the
 earth and the hillside where shells and bombs have
 dug innumerable holes make  the  picture of a
 pockmarked face."
 BETWEEN SUWON AND SEOUL
 Newspaperman Henri De Turenne wrote from
 the Korean front to the French newspaper Le Figaro
 as follows:
 "The icy plain between Suwon and Seoul is
 completely deserted and all the towns are razed to
 the ground.  Suwon, the only town in the penins-
 ula with any pretentious to beauty, a kind of Car-
 casonne, complelely walled, with towers and gates
 eight centuries old, looks today like an empty box.
 Inside the walls there is nothing lett but a carpet
 of ashes; the inhabitants, some hundred thousand
 of them, have disappeared.  All along the road to
 Seoul, through the frozen paddy fields that, from
 a distance look like the compartments of an ice-

 less corpses of our                                                                        brothers  and  sisters.
 In the cities,  most  of the theatres,  clubs
 and  other  cultural  institutions have been
 destroyed and burned by American bombs.
 But it is not only the towns and villlages
 that have been destroyed; the barbarians
 drop their  incendiary  bombs  and flaming
 liquid  even in  sparsely populated places;
 here an isolated house on a mountain path,
 there a whole forest is put to flames. Hardly
 a human  shadow       can be found  in the
 streets; in the villages the crowing of the
 rooster and the barking of the dogs are no
 longer heard.   Now  instead    of peaceful
 family gatherings and songs  of work  and
 construction, the roaring flame of the people's
 wrath  is heard, everywhere  are heard the
 people's  maledictions, everywhere the peo-
 ple's eyes  gleam with burning hatred and
 the desire for vengeance.
 Korea can. no longer be studied on the
 maps and in the books which depicted and
 described our   country  six  months  ago.
 Where towns and villages (were marked on
 the maps,  no trace  remains; here  stood a
 house, it is no more; here were a garden and a
 forest, they( are no more.  Only the moun-
 tain ranges and the river beds remain for ever;
 but so   does  the  unshakeable will  of the
 Korean people to fight for its   liberty  and
 independence.
 The targets on which the American planes
 have been dropping their bombs     since the
 very beginning of the war, and on which
 they have  loosed  their guns,  are  not the
 trenches, or  the  artillery    emplacements of

 our army, the barracks, and military convoys,
 but children's schools, hospitals crowded with
 the sick, churches,  theatres,  and  cottages
 on the banks of limited streams or in lonely
 places in the mountains.  They have aimed
 their flaming liquid  and their    incendiary
 bombs at infants weeping at     the breast of
 their  dead mothers,  at young brides     be-
 wailing with hot tears their husbands who
 will never return, at aged mothers hoping
 day after day for the return of their beloved
 sons........
 It was  when we       reached the highest
 mountain peaks  that we saw  the  most
 terrible  scenes.  None of  us could ima-
 gine that mankind could attain such degra-
 dation.                          We are convinced  that this was
 the work not of the hand of man, but rather
 of the claws of a beast in human form.
 We        saw a baby, who with tiny hands
 grasped the breast of his dead mother, and
 vainly tried to suck nourishment therefrom.
 How could the baby know  that his  mother
 had been killed, that  the life-giving  milk
 would     no  longer  flow from her breast ?
 This child was the only human being left
 alive out of 700 of our brothers and sisters
 shot by the American monsters on the moun-
 tain of Chupkhennen.
 Not far from Chupkhennen, in the valley
 of Endon, we came upon a place where the
 Americans had shot 200 young school girls;
 in a pine forest, on  the banks of a little
 stream, were spread in disorder the bathing-
 shoes worn by the                          children  during  their
 physical-culture period.  It  seemed to   its
 that we  could  see   the young girls falling
 beneath  the enemy bullets; we could hear
 their last  cries,  could hear them as they
 cursed their  executioners.   The  bodies of
 the young girls were taken away after they
 had been murdered, but their shoes remained
 behind, scattered on the grass.
 In a little  village of Savori, a province
 north of Pyeng Yang, in only a few days the
 Americans and the Synghman Rhee troops
 killed   about half  of  the   inhabitlts.
 Before they shot her, an aged Korean woman
 vented her wrath on the enemy: "Monsters !
 You  will be wiped  out,  without   fail."
 Such curses are heard wherever the Ameri-
 can and the Synghman Rhee brigands go.
 The air is filled also with the groans and the
 curses of our sisters  violated by the Amer-
 cans and their Korean                   mercenaries.      Many
 of our sisters could not bear the shame in-
 flicted on them;  such was  their hatred of
 the enemy that they committed suicide- , ..

 in groups of about ten  peasants,  burying  at
 the roadside heaps of corpses frozen into tragica-

 soldiers killed by aircraft.
 "About ten kilometres north-west of Suwon,
 an American battalion had started to attack a
 hill position held batered held by the North Kor-
 eans. As usual, the artillery had battered the hill
 for half an hour before, but when the infantry
 went in they were greeted with machine-gun fire.
 The battalion commander then asked more artill-
 ery support, and called in the air force.
 "For one hour, after the thundering artillery,
 jets dosed the hill with napalm and rockets.
 "I'll be damned if anything's left alive," said
 a correspondent who arrived at that moment."

 Rajput glory of battle was
 not appreciated by our
 its close associates and
 friends.  It was a very exclusive movement; it
 had a very exclusive growth and ultimately it
 died of its 'own exclusion.
 The new peace movement seeking to avoid
 the mistakes of the past has a more comprehen-
 sive understanding of the issues at stake.
 Slowly it is acquiring shape, strength and
 vitality.  Slowly it is rising from a nebulous
 mass of vague longings for Peace and growing
 into a distinctly autonomous political move-
 ment having firm national roots.  Today it
 covers within its wide sweeping arch, ele-
 ments from extreme right to extreme left,
 industrialists, Congressmen, Theocrats, Socia-
 lists, Forward Blocists, Communists, intellec-
 tuals, scientists, doctors, non-Party, non-Poli-
 tical men and women from diverse faiths,
 religions and races.  More than 25 lacs of
 people have signed its Peace pledges at one time
 or another.
 Three thousand years' tradition
 All this has  been achieved within  the
 incredibly short period of one year, with-
 out any governmental backing, without the
 whole-hearted cooperation of any political
 party or parties who could make Peace', the
 centre of their programme, a shining testa-
 ment of their faith and glory However, the
 struggle for Peace does not wait for anybody. the
 people have taken it up and it will grow.
 That the Peace movement has been able
 to grow in India in so short a time is not only
 due to our new understanding but due also
 to an understanding which is very, very old.
 'From the hoary past, over the whispering
 galleries of a three thousand years, tradition,
 the voice of our ancient scholars, prophets
 and men of Peace comes to us in words of
 clear crystal-like, luminous wisdom.
 The Indian Peace tradition is a very real,
 genuine tradition.  It is,not that India did not
 have wars and warriors in the past or that the
 A peaceful tradition is a great incentive
 to Peace.  But it has its limitations.  For
 the demand of Peace is independent of our
 tradition,  religion and philosophy, though
 they may all help to build a climate of Peace
 in our country, the real demand of Peace is a
 rational, objective reality, arising out of the
 fact that to-day through the misuse of scientific
 discoveries, through atom bombs and hydrogen
 bombs, and other death-dealing instruments of
 mass destruction, it is within the bounds ofpossi-
 INDIA TO-DAY
 people.  The difference
 lies in an almost univer-
 sal abhorence of war and
 having Peace somehow,
 even at the cost of some   *
 compromise.  The  dif-
 ff'erence lies in  the fact that Ashok is a
 greater hero to us than Maharana. Pratap,
 Buddha infinitely greater than    Shankara-
 charya, Akbar more beloved than Aurang-
 zeb.                                                                  All our great heroes are heroes of Peace.
 We do not boast of having a Halaku, Chengiz
 Khan, Timarlane or Hitler within the last
 5,000 years of our  organised social  exis-
 tence.  Unlike the imperialists, we did not
 first send the priest and then the soldier ab-
 road.                                                                  We first sent the priest, and then the
 priest and then again the priest.  That has
 been our tradition.
 Those who struggle for Peace in this country,
 those who go to the people with a message of
 Peace, must recall to their mind and to the mind
 of the people our glorious peace-loving heritage.
 They should recall Krishna's valiant struggle
 for Peace before the battle of Mahabharata:
 his even-to-the-last minute  attempts to seat
 Kauravas and Pandavas at a round table to
 thrash out the issues and come to a pact of
 peace.  I think  someone     should  translate
 those chapters and dramatise them for the
 modern stage.  In the new context of things,
 those old ancient truths will gleam with new
 meaning.  They will convince many not only
 with the humanity of Peace, but also with the
 Politics of Peace, for Krishna was a great
 politician as well as a great prophet.

 AFTER ATOM BOMBS.. - - . COFFINS!
 The Pacific Tribune of Ottawa, Canada,
 reported on February 23, 1951 that "the
 St. Laurent Government is planning to
 manufacture  collapsible,  easily-stored
 fibre-board coffins for distribution to
 urban centres likely to be bomb-targets in
 event of war.  As an added gesture to
 culture, the National Research Council
 has developed a spray to give the coffins a
 velvet appearance.  The cost will be
 approximately $5 each."
 That is, after making atom-bombs, now
 they are making eo, fjins !
 bility-nay, it is a probable certainty that the
 entire mankind can be wiped out, the entire
 earth reduced to a wasteland andits atmos phere
 surcharged with poisonous radio-active elements.
 This is not a mad man's dream or fantasy.
 Its horror in all its naked truth and brutality
 has been admitted by such eminent scientists
 as Einstein, Joliot-Curie and many others.
 Faced with such prospects of destruction and
 annihilation, Peace becomes the collecting point of
 all humanity to save itself from a few individuals
 and groups of individuals who seek profit from death
 and war.
 First we must live
 And since Peace is the collecting point
 of diverse political  elements,  reactionaries
 as  well  as  progressives,  Commuists      as
 well as Gandhi-ites;  Peace becomes nautral
 to all political issues except those of Peace
 and War.  This neutrality of Peace between
 various political elements within the orbit
 of the Peace movement is a cardinal point
 in issue and should always be  maintained.
 I say this becuase it often happens that some
 persons, through their incorrect understand-
 ing,  or becuase of their established political
 habits and w?iys of thinking, would resort to
 tendentious methods to give their own poli-
 tical colour ng to the Peace movement, to
 channelise it into solving local, national or
 international problems which are really, ex-
 traneous to the problems of Peace.  Such
 methods tend to create tension within the
 Peace movement rnd restrict its growth.
 Our occupation with the single problem of
 Peace does not mean that other problems
 concerning our national existence should not
 be solved.  But there are other platforms to
 do so.  On the. issue of Peace, the neutrality
 of Peace must be obtained towards its various
 components.  This will obviate the necessity
 of discussing such issues as Telengana, Assam,
 the partition of Bengal, the Indian constitution,
 Vana  Mahotsav,  the  Railway Time-able
 or Birth-Control-all from the same platform.
 Really, Peace is the most dire necessity
 for mankind today.  Let us not make it a
 joke. Capitalism is a stage in living,  So
 is Communism.  But first we must live to know
 how to live.  That is why both capitalists
 and Communists have joined our movement
 on the issue of preserving world Peace. It
 would be dangeroi s to exclude one or the
 other.  To   those who say that our Peace
 movement  contains  many Communists, I
 would say that a peace movement which does
 not  include Communists  and  allow them
 to play their rightful role in it would be as
 dangerous a movement as the peace move-
 ment which includes only Communists in it
 and which does not allow other elements to
 play their proper role in it. Rather it should
 be a matter of great satisfaction to us that
 Communists  come  on our platform 1prea-
 ching world Peace and not world  war, that
 in answer to the tragic barbarism of a few
 brutal war-makers, they bring to us the finest
 hope of a new humanism.
 But Peace is not synonimous with politi-
 cal slumber.  It does not mean that in a
 given country or sector of human life various
 political trends and ideologies will not contend
 fiercely to mould human society into a parti-
 cular shape.    Peace does not stop that process.
 Rather it accelerates that process by providing
 a peaceful international atmosphere in which
 man can experiment with various ways of
 life and by his own efforts and understanding
 arrive at a higer level of living.  Of living,
 not of Death.
 Lean on the anti-imperialist sentiment
 To use a Chinese saying with a slight
 modification,  one might  say that World
 Peace is the water in which various political
 fish will roam.  The  fish  will not  exist
 without water.
 That brings me to the continuous process
 of liberation  struggles going on on the con-
 tinents of Asia  and Africa against various
 foreign imperialisms. It is true that these foreign
 imperialismsdenoteacontinuous stateof aggress-
 ion and war carried on by some foreign powers
 against the colonial naitons ofAsia and Africa for
 the last two hundred years. Two hundred years
 is a long time.  During this time it was but
 natural for these colonial peoples to know

 those aggressors by names, by faces, by all their
 dark, cruel methods. It is also natural for these
 people to develop an intense passionate hatred
 against this centuries old aggression.
 Any Peace movement in colonial countries which
 does not  take serious  account of this  intense
 overwhelming feeling of the people would be lacking
 in national content.
 At Warsaw we took a step in that direc-
 tion and I hope more  attention will be
 paid to this aspect of things by various peace
 movements in colonial cAuntries.
 From Stockholm to Berlin appeal
 The draft of a national appeal put froward
 by the Indian Preparatory Committe calling
 for the withdrawal of foreign troops from
 Asian soil is another step in that direction.
 In fact, let us hope some day we shall have
 a big Congress of Peace comprising of all
 colonial countries, in India or China, to thrash
 out our particular national problem of Peace.
 We have travelled a long road.  From
 Stockholm to Berlin Appeal.  In India the step
 was faltering, the pace uneven, but unmis-
 takably there have been taken big steps
 towards enduring Progress.  Stockholm posed
 the moral issue of Peace.   Berlin poses the
 political issue, of bringing all the five great
 powers together to sign a Pact of Peace.  It
 means asking the world of Communism and
 the world of capitalism,  the world of Peo-
 ple's Democracy and the world of Imperial-
 ism to give us Peace in our life-time.  It does
 not mean the end of Imperialism, or the end
 of our national liberation struggles.  It means
 in fact, the provision of water for the fish to
 swim in.  The Peace movement has grown
 from the moral to the practical plane.  The.
 Berlin Peace Council decision must be widely.
 approved in India, and the ranks of those who
 have signed. the Stockholm Appeal, must be
 joined by hundreds of millions of Indians
 signing the Berlin Peace Appeal sure in the
 knowledge that the Indian people by their
 united will can really make war impossible,
 sure in their resurgent faith in their glorious
 tradition to march  forward hand in hand,
 with other peoples of the world, not to make
 a nightmare of shambles  and ruins, but a
 rainbow of shimmering smiles, of fond lights
 and hopes and a great embracing of hearts
 all over the world.

 T HE foreign policy of the Soviet Union
 has been much misunderstood in this
 country. In many cases the misunderstanding
 is inspired by a dislike of the social philosophy
 which is the basis of the Soviet State; in other
 words, by hatred  of Marxism, Bolshevism,
 or Socialism.  But in other cases, the misun-
 derstanding is due either to ignorance or
 confused thinking.

 of the foreign powers to the SovetState during
 the early years of its existence.
 The Bolshevist Revolution took place in
 Russia in November 1917, when the capita-
 list and imperialist powers were engaged in
 a life and deaths.tyuggle.  Consequently none
 of the Great Powers was in a position to, inter-
 fere.                   But Lenin warned the Bolsheviks that
 their immunity from foreign invasion would
 not last long. As soon as the two rival imperialist
 groups were able to patchi up their quarrels --
 a permanent so]ut_1on szt=_the imperialist rival-
 ries was not possible without  destruction
 of imperialism itself -they  'ould unite to fight
 Bolshevism.  Some of his cc.lleagues including
 Trotsky were inclin--d to pooh-pooh his warn-
 ings as unduly alarmist.                            But Lenin -proved
 right.  Soon  after  the     Revolution, the
 armies of fourteen countries (Britain, France,
 America, Japan,  Italy, Poland, Czechoslo-
 vakia, Rumania, Hungary, and Germany etc.)
 invaded the Soviet Republic with the d,:,
 lared object of "strangling Bolshevism at the
 moment of its birth", as Mr. Churchill recently
 put it.
 Lessons of Intervention and Civil War
 Such an attack on a revolutionary state
 by a combination of foreign powers was not
 a unique event in history.  After the great
 French  Revolution,  the  other  European
 powers invaded France to restore the Bourbon
 monarchy and the ancien regime in -France.
 In 1871, Bismark helped the bourgeois govern-
 ment of France to crush the `Commune'-the
 revolutionary government set up by the people
 of Paris.  In our own times, the Fascist govern-
 ments of Germany and  Italy helped the
 Spanish rebel Franco to destroy the Spanish
 Republic.  Therefore the combined assault
 on the Soviet Republic in 1918 by a coalition
 of fourteen foreign powers was not surprising.
 But one feature of the intervention must be
 noted. Germany co-operated with the powers
 which had just inflicted a crushing defeat on
 her.  The enemies of yesterday became friends
 for the purpose of destroying Socialism in
 Russia.  What saved the Soviet Republic
 was a number of factors.  Most important
 of these was the fanatical resistance of the
 masses in defence of their Soviet Republic.
 Secondly, the conflicting interests of the Great
 Powers were ' too deep-rooted to make any
 co-operation possible for long.  The Soviet
 Government took the fullest advantage of the
 jealousies and rivalries among their' enemies.
 Lastly, the opposition of the working classes
 in imperialist  countries, who had already
 suffered the horrors of four years of war, to
 this new war against the infant  Workers'
 Republic damped the crusading anti-Bolshev-
 ist ardour of the invading governments.                                                                    The
 `intervention' failed, and the Soviet Republic
 came out-of-this ordeal alive, though consi-
 derably weakened.
 But the `intervention' had a permanent
 effect on the foreign policy of the Soviet
 government.  During the ordeal of Civil War
 and ' foreign invasion the Bolsheviks derived
 many useful lessons which were to stand them in
 good stead in later years.  They were convin-
 ced that though the __`intervention _ had been
 beaten off, it would be repeated.   What
 had been gained was only a truce, or a brea-
 thing space.
 The Civil War convinced Soviet states-
 men that Capitalism would not tolerate for
 ever the existence within itself of a Socialist
 economy.  This conviction has-- been the basis of
 Soviet foreign policy ever since.  The broad prin-
 ciples of this policy were laid down by Lenin
 himself. These principles may be summarised
 as follows:
 The existence of the Soviet Union may be
 detrimental to the interests of Capitalism as
 a whole, but the conflict of interests between
 individual capitalist states is too deep to allow
 any united front against the Soviet Union for
 any length of time.  Therefore, it should be
 the aim of the Soviet government to take full
 advantage of these rivalries in order to prevent
 the formation of an Anti-Soviet coalition.
 Utilizing Imperialist rivalries
 This policy had already  been pursued
 with  advantage.  When  during  the  peace
 negotiations with Germany, news was received
 that the German armies had  resumed their
 advance, Trotsky proposed that the Bolshevik
 government should ask the   Allied Powers
 for aid against Germany.  Lenin supported
 this proposal with the remark: "Please add my
 vote in favour of the  receipt of support and
 arms  from  the  Anglo-French  Imperialist
 brigands".  Similarly when Japan invaded
 Siberia, ostensibly to stamp out Bolshevism
 but really to annex Eastern  Siberia,  the
 Soviet government relied on the traditional
 policy of America to weaken Japan's position
 on the Asiatic mainland.  In the end, American
 oppposition forced Japan to withdraw. :Again,
 when Britain sent her troops to the Caucasus,
 the Soviet government had little difficulty
 in persuading other Great Powers that the
 British aim was not to fight Communism,

 but to secure the oil-fields of Baku.*  During
 the years immediatley following the Treaty
 of Versailles, when Germany was an outcast
 among the great powers in Europe, the Soviet
 government developed cordial relations with
 her for trade purposes.
 The Five-Year Plans
 Another great lesson which the Soviet
 government learnt from the "intervention"
 was to develop the military and industrial
 strength of the country as quickly as possible.
 This was the genesis of the famous Five- Year Plan;
 which transformed Soviet Russia from a backward
 agricultural country into the second greatest indus-
 trial country in the world.  That Soviet Russia
 would have been industrialised sooner or later
 is certain, for socialism in a primitive economy
 is unthinkable.  But the terrific pace of the
 Five Year Plans and the terrible sacrifices
 which it entailed upon the people were dictated
 by the international situation.  At the end of
 the first Five-Year Plan, Stalin said:.
 "It was the basic task of the Five-Year Plan
 to transform the U. S. S. R. from an agrarian
 and weak country, subservient to the caprices
 of capitalist countries, into a powerful industrial
 land, fully independent of and not subservient
 to the caprices of world capitalism."
 This is not the place to discuss the Stalin-
 Trotsky controversy or to  decide  whether
 "Socialism in one country" is possible. But
 it is obvious to any intelligent observer that
 if Stalin's policy had not been adopted in 1928,
 the Soviet Union would not have survived the
 invasion of Hitler in 1941.
 Peace Front and Collective Security
 Another principle of Soviet foreign policy
 was to develop a "peace front" for the preven-
 tion of war. In all the Disarmament Confer-
 ences, the Soviet government proposed the total
 abolition of all armament.  Their proposals
 were negatived by all the Western powers.
 Moreover, the Soviet government concluded
 non-aggression pacts with all States bordering
 on her territory.  (The only exception was
 Japan who refused to conclude any such pact) .
 In particular, it fostered diplomatic and trade
 relations with Germany who had been laid
 low_ by the burdens of the Versailles Treaty.
 The Soviet Union was Germany's best customer
 *"The oil industry of Russia liberally financed and
 properly organised under  British  auspices  would in
 itself, be a valuable asset to the Empire"- Herbert Allen,
 Chairman of the BIBI hBAT  Oil Company,         in an
 address to the Stockholders, December 24, 1928.
 during this period and  most of the heavy
 industry plant for the Five-Year  Plan was
 bought in Germany.  The cordial relations
 between Germany and the Soviet Union lasted
 till Hitler came to power.
 The rise of Hitler is the dividing line in
 Soviet foreign policy. The basic  principles
 of this policy did not change,  but the rise of
 Nazism necessitated  a change  in   tactics.
 Nazi Germany compelled the Soviet government to
 seek a rapproachement with Britain and France.
 From 1933 to 1939 the efforts of the  Soviet
 government were directed towards the  build-
 ing up of a system of collective  security in
 Europe against Nazi aggression.  If any state
 was attacked anywhere in Europe, all the other
 states would come to her help against the
 aggressor. This is the principle of collective
 security in a nutshell, and the Soviet government
 made repeated efforts to create it in Europe.
 They joined the League of Nations with this ob-
 ject. But the effort failed, and in the end the So-
 viet government itself concluded a Neutrality
 Pact with Nazi Germany.  In order to under-
 stand the causes of this failure, it is necessary to
 understand the problems created by the Treaty
 of Versailles after 1919, and in particular the
 policy of Britain and France to meet  those
 problems.
 Problems after World War I
 After the Great war, the victorious Allies
 were faced with two great problems.     The
 first was communism and the other was Germany.
 Of these two, Communism was the greater
 danger. For instance, consider the following
 remarks of a man who has left a name in history:
 "The effect  of the Russian    problem
 on the Paris (Peace) Conference was
 profound : Paris cannot be understood
 without Moscow.  Without ever be-
 ing represented at Paris  at                                                                               all,  the
 Bolsheviki and Bolshevism were power-
 ful elements at every turn.                                                                              Russia
 played a more vital part at Paris than
 Germany".
 These are the words of Woodrow Wilson,
 President of the United States and founder
 of the League of Nations.
 In 1919, the entire continent of Europe
 was on the brink of a social upheaval which
 threatened to sweep all governments.  The
 nations were hungry and disillusioned; the
 armies were tired and weary of discipline.
 (It was these conditions which were partly
 responsible for the failure of the Allies to crush
 the Soviet Republic). A communist government
 was proclaimed in Hungary in March, 1919.

 Bavaria established a Soviet overnment in April.
 In 1919, world capitalism and its statesmen
 lived in fear of Bolshevism. his fear dominated
 every move of the Allies  If Poland asked
 for a loan it was to defend the world against
 Bolshevism.  If the star ing population of
 Germany required feeding it was to save Ger-
 rnany from                          Bolshevism.  A chain of small
 states was set up on the Baltic as buffer states
 against Bolshevist Russia. The major task of
 the League of Nations was t save the world from
 Bolshevism.  This was pro lem number one.
 Dilemma of the Imperialists
 The second problem        as Germany.  The
 great war had revealed h r colossal military
 strength and war potenti 1.  So she had to
 be curbed with a strong   and.  But in this
 respect the Allies were in dilemma.  If Ger-
 many was treated too severely                         and  if the
 burdens and restrictions i posed on her were
 too heavy, the might be pushed into the arms
 of Communism.  Already in 1919 there was a
 revolutionary crisis in Ger any. Hence care
 must be taken to save Germany from Bolshevism
 at all costs. Moreover, they was a sharp conflict
 of policy between Britain and France over the
 German problem. Britain  as anxious only to
 render Germany harmless as a rival in the colonial
 and imperial fields.  Henc , on her insistence,
 Germany was deprived of all her colonies, her
 entire navy and       merca tile  marine.   But
 Britain wanted to preserve Germany  as a
 great continental Power to reserve the Balance
 of Power against France, an  also as a bulwark
 against the Bolshevist men  e.  But the French
 aim was to destroy Germany as a great power
 and to cut her up into smal states.  This aim
 was defeated by Anglo-A erican opposition.
 France, however, surrounded Germany with
 an iron ring of states all heavily armed and
 bound by a military  al iance  to  France.
 The members of this allie nce were Poland,
 Czechoslovakia, Rumania  and Jugoslavia.
 For many years the initiative in the matter of
 Germany  lay with   Fra ce.  Britain's role
 was confinedto holding the scales even between
 Germany and France.
 Solution of the dilemma-Hitler
 Then came Hitler.
 In Mein Kampj, Hitler laid down the follow-
 ing policy with regard t  the expansion of
 Germany in the future: "We, National Socialists
 put an end to  the eve lasting  movement
 of Germans  to the Sou   and West and
 turn our eyes to the land in the East. We
 put an end to the colonia policy of pre-war
 times and proceed to the erritorial policy of
 the future.  If we speak of new land in Europe
 today, it is primarily only of Russia and its
 subject border states that we can be thinking."
 This was the famous DRANG NACH OSTEN-
 the PUSH TO THE EAST.
 To the Imperialist powers the rise of Hitler
 pointed the way to the liquidation of both
 problems together-Gerlnany and Bolshevism.
 If Hitler wanted to push towards the East
 and annex Russian territory, it was no con-
 cern of Britain and France.  This  would
 give Germany all the territory and sources
 of raw material she required, and keep her
 away from colonial ambitions in Asia or Africa.
 Moreover, the conquest of Russia was a tough
 job, and would weaken Germany and render
 her harmless for a long time.  If in the process,
 Bolshevist Russia was weakened or destroyed,
 no tears need be shed  over it.  But if Ger-
 many was to wage a successful compaign in
 the East, she must become a      Great Power
 again. The shackles of the Treaty of Versailles
 must be removed.  The iron ring of states
 encircling her must be broken.   Germany's
 western frontier must be secured  against
 invasion, so that she may have a free hand in
 the East.
 Imperialist powers build up Hitler
 Thus, in the decade between 1929 and 1939,
 Germany gradually rose to power and re-armed
 with the connivance of the other Imperialist
 powers, particularly Britain.  The Rhineland
 was evacuated in 1929, six years before time.
 Germany was freed from the burden of repara-
 tions in 1932, a concession which was constantly
 denied to the Social Democratic government
 of Germany.  In 1933, Germany was allowed
 to occupy the Rhineland in violation of the
 Versailles Treaty.  In the same year, Britain
 concluded a naval Agreement with Germany
 which allowed her to build a navy up to forty
 per cent of the size of Britain's navy.  This
 treaty was made without consulting France
 and was a violation of the Versailles Treaty.
 It gave Germany mastery over the Baltic.   In
 1936, Germany  was allowed to introduce
 conscription, again in violation of the Versailles
 Treaty.  In 1938 Germany was allowed to
 occupy Austria (France proposed joint action
 against her but Britain rejected this suggestion).
 In October, 1938, was enacted the infamous deal
 at Munich, when Czechoslovakia was handed
 over to  Germany.  The French steel-ring
 around Germany was broken at last.  During
 this period the Spanish Republic was destroyed
 by Franco with the help of Italy and Germany
 while Britain refused to intervene. A hos-
 tile fascist state  on her  southern border

 weakened France and made her more depen-
 dent on British support than ever.
 The Policy of Appeasement
 Of course, the policy of encouragement
 and appeasement of Germany was full of
 risks.  Hitler, after climbing to power with
 British help, might double-cross Britain.  He
 might desire colonies after all.  But this risk
 must be taken.  The alternative was to push
 Germany over to communism.        And if com-
 munism came to Germany, it would spread
 over the whole of Europe and then Asia and
 Africa.  That would be the end of Imperia-
 lism.  "Appeasement" was a                                safer policy.
 Any risk that Germany might turn her might
 against her "appeasers"  could be provided
 against by Britain re-arming herself.  The
 policy of Britain and France was thus summed
 up by Stalin:
 "Through the policy      of appeasement
 there runs the eagerness and desire  not to
 prevent the aggressors from perpetrating their
 black deeds, not to prevent, say, Japan from
 becoming involved in a war with China or
 better still with the Soviet Union; not to prevent,
 say, Germany from becoming enmeshed in
 European affairs, from becoming involved in
 a war with the Soviet Union; to allow all
 belligerents to sink deeper into the mire of war,
 stealthily to encourage them to follow this
 line, to allow them to weaken and exhaust
 one another, and when  they  become suffi-
 ciently weakened, to appear on the scene with
 fresh forces, to come out, of course, in the
 interests of peace, and to dictate their terms
 to weakened belligerent nations.  It is cheap
 and it serves its purpose".  (Stalin: Speech
 to the 18th Congress of the Communist Party
 of Soviet Union, March, 1939)
 Fiasco of Chamberlain's policy
 After the seizure of Prague in March, 1939,
 Germany stood  at  the cross-roads.    Upto
 now it was not possible to guess the intended
 direction of her aggressive ambitions.  But
 after the conquest of Czechoslovakia her next
 move must indicate her  intention.  If her
 aim was to push her way to the         east and
 towards the Soviet Union, her  next move
 would be to come to an understanding with
 Poland and direct her attention on   Soviet
 Ukraine.   The  British  government must
 have watched for Germany's next move with
 bated      breath.   The day after  Germany
 marched into  Prague, the  Soviet   govern-
 ment                              proposed   to  the British govern-
 ment the                              formation of a collective front
 against German aggression.  But the British
 Prime  Minister  negatived this  suggestion
 on the ground  that it was     "premature".
 No wonder, because Germany had not yet
 made her next move.    Her next move was
 shown in the manner in which Germany
 partitioned Czechoslovakia.  The Ukrainian
 province of Teschen-also called Carpathian
 Ukraine-was given to Hungary, thus reveal-
 ing that Germany was no longer interested
 in Soviet Ukraine.  At the  same time, the
 German press started a bitter campaign against
 Poland and pressed for the return of Danzig
 and the Polish Corridor to Germany.  Si-
 multaneously, the Nazi leaders began to de-
 mand the return of Germany's former colo-
 nies.  The direction of German expansion
 was fully revealed now-not DRANG NACH
 OSTEN, but a colonial empire.  The entire
 policy of "appeasement", patiently and skill-
 fully built up by the  Government of Neville
 Chamberlain collapsed.  Hitler had double-
 crossed Chamberlain. The British government
 now turned towards the Soviet Union for help
 against Nazi aggression, and intimated to
 the Soviet government that they were willing
 to negotiate a collective Security Pact with
 Moscow.  Thus  began the famous negotia-
 tions which dragged on through the summer
 of 1939, and ended when the Soviet govern-
 ment signed a non-agression pact with Germany.
 New menace for the Soviets
 Meanwhile, the Soviet government were
 watching the course of events.   They had
 watched the rapid re-armament of Germany
 with British connivance, the crumbling of
 the European structure built at Versailles,
 the growing economic crisis in capitalist coun-
 tries, and the steady drift towards war.  They
 also watched the re-appearance of the old
 menace-the formation of a coalition against
 the Soviet Union.  They tried to meet the
 situation as best as they could.  They worked
 hard to build up a peace front on the basis
 of Collective Security. But Collective Security
 was torpedoed by the resolute refusal of Britain
 to undertake any   obligations    in  Eastern
 Europe.  The Soviet government then con-
 cluded a pact of mutual assistance with France
 and Czechoslovakia.  This pact was made
 possible by the growing fear of France that
 she could not rely on Britain alone for her
 security against a re-armed  Germany but
 needed the additional support of another
 Great Power.  At the same time the Soviet
 government joined the League of Nations.
 The Franco-Soviet Pact was made a part
 of the League Covenant to meet any possible

 objection that the pact w s a violation of the
 Treaty of Locarno.   Needless to say, the
 Franco-Soviet Pact died   painless death at
 Munich.
 But the Soviet government had too keen
 a sense of realism to plat any great reliance
 on Pacts ("scraps of paper") for the security
 of the Soviet Union. Hen e their other answer
 to the growing danger of war was a tremendous
 speeding up of the military defences  of the
 country.  They built u  their defences on
 the basis of having to fight the strongest possi-
 ble combination of ene  ies  single-handed.
 The Far Eastern army  as made an entirely
 separate  and  complete  defence system.
 Huge armament factories were erected in the
 Urals and in Siberia, safe from an attack from
 the West or the East. By March 1939, nearly
 40 % of the entire resourc s of the U. S. S. R.
 were being devoted to d fence.
 British bid to double- ross the Soviet
 I shall now discuss Soviet policy during
 the  months  which   im ediately  preceded
 the Non-Aggression Pact between Russia and
 Germany.  How was it that a situation which
 began with Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations
 for collective security agai st Germany sudden-
 ly ended with the signing of a treaty between
 Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.  The inner
 history of all the negot ations which ? took
 place between the partie will'be known only
 when the secret archive  of Britain, France,
 Germany and the Soviet U lion are made public.
 But one fact became obvious from the very
 beginning of Anglo-Soviet negotiations. There
 was a sharp difference between  the inter-
 pretation  put  on  the                              word "pact"  by
 Britain and France on the ne hand and by the
 Soviet government on th  other. The Soviet
 Union wanted a pact of collecitve security
 which would secure all countries in Europe
 against  aggression. By  "aggression" they
 meant any attempt,  direct or indirect, to
 destroy the independent  of a state. But
 Great Britain and France only  wanted  a
 military  alliance which would compel the
 U. S. S. R.  to defend  Poland   against
 Germany.   Thus the Soviet government came
 to realise that Britain and France probably
 wanted to use Russia as  tool, and were pos-
 sibly at their old game of 'tirring up a conflict
 between the Soviet Un on and    Germany.
 Moreover, in July, 1939, while negotiations
 were still taking place, news leaked out that
 "conversations" were goi g on in Londonbet-
 ween a prominent German official, Herr Wohltat
 and a member of the British Government for
 an  understanding  between  England  and
 Germany.  The  disclosure  of the Hudson-
 Wohltat conversations was a rude warning
 to the Soviet government that the danger of
 a double-cross,, by Chamberlain's government
 was very real. At this stage, the Soviet
 government appears to have decided that no
 useful purpose would be served by further
 negotiations with the Western Powers.  They
 turned towards the Nazis  who were more
 than willing to sign a non-aggression pact in
 their desperate anxiety to avoid a war on two
 fronts.  The result was the Nazi-Soviet Pact
 of Non-Aggression on the 23rd August, 1939.
 Subsequently, Mr. Chamberlain complained
 that  the Soviet government  had  double-
 crossed him.  But they could say with justice
 that it was only a case of double-crossing
 a double-crosser.
 Hitlerite invasion of the U. S. S. R
 22nd of June, 1941. is a great landmark
 in the relations  of the Soviet State with
 the non-Soviet world.  Hitler's invasion  of
 the U.S.S.R.  resulted in a military alliance
 between the Soviet State and the Western
 democracies.
 Credit for this alliance goes in a, large
 measure to Winston Churchill.  His previous
 and subsequent record must not blind us to the
 fact that his prompt decision to help the
 Soviet State was an act of courage in sharp
 contrast with the sinister and suicidal policy
 of Chamberlain.  We are not concerned with
 Mr.  Churchill's motives.  It has been sug-
 gested that his decision to help the U. S. S. R.
 was due to    an ignorance of the military
 strength of the Soviet state.  In other words,
 it is said that had Mr.  Churchill known that
 the Red Army was more than a match for
 the Wehrmacht, his policy would have been
 different. This may or may not be true.  But
 none of these facts can derogate from the his-
 toric  significance of                                                                          Mr.  Churchill's de-
 cision.  He may have been the unconscious
 instrument of history and its purposes.  But
 his decision  ushered a  new era in world
 history. From June 22, 1941 the Soviet system
 was recognised as one of the great economic
 and social systems of mankind. The Soviet
 State became a co-partner of Britain and
 America and a joint trustee of world peace
 after the termination of the war.
 From 1941 to 1945 was the period of the
 "patriotic war" against Germany.  The entire
 resources of the Soviet State were directed
 towards the achievement of one object: victory
 over Fascist Germany.  The common fight

 against the Axis forces drew the Soviet state
 and the western democracies together. Instead
 of being regarded as an enemy, the U. S. S. R.
 came to be regarded as an ally and friend
 of the western democracies.  The  policy of
 co-operation  culminated  in the  establish-
 ment of the United Nations with the U. S.,S. R.
 as one of the permanent members of the
 Security Council.    The period of outlawry
 and isolation of the Soviet state was over,
 never to return.
 America disrupts war-time alliance
 The period after 1945 may be called the
 period of the disruption of the Allied-Soviet
 entente which was built up during war.  The
 causes of the disruption may be summarised
 as follows:
 The foremost among these causes was the
 action of the U. S. Government in manu-
 facturing the Atom bomb as a secret weapon.
 The Bomb was kept a secret from the U. S. S. R.
 but was disclosed to the two other allies of
 the United States, Great Britain and Canada.
 The only conclusion from this discrimination
 could be  that the U. S.  government was
 contemplating the Bomb as a possible weapon
 against the Soviet Union in a future war.
 The second great disruptive factor was the
 decision of the U. S. government to annex
 all the Japanese islands in the Pacific and con-
 vert them into naval and military bases.  Some
 of these islands were more than 5,000 miles
 away from the Pacific coast of America but
 only 400 miles from the Soviet coast. The
 American decision was announced when war
 against Japan was still being fought and no
 serious differences had arisen between the
 U. S. A. and the U. S. S. R. There could be
 only one interpretation of the American deci-
 sion to build bases near the territories of the
 U. S. S. R., namely, that America had al-
 ready started thinking in terms of a future
 conflict between itself and its Soviet ally.
 The third cause of the disruption of the
 Entente was the consolidation of the Soviet
 bloc in eastern Europe.
 The American decision to manufacture the
 Atomic bomb as a secret weapon and to build
 naval and military bases near the Soviet coast
 had swift reaction in the U. S. S. R.  The
 Soviet  government decided once again to
 achieve security along its borders.  They were
 determined that no Hitler would use the border
 states as jumping-off boards for an invasion.
 With this end in view, the Balkan states were
 rapidly Sovietised,  the popular fronts in
 Rumania,  Hungry, Bulgaria  and Czecho-
 slovakia were dissolved and these neighbour
 states of the U. S. S. R. were converted into
 full-fledged communist states, which resulted
 in a more or less complete disruption of the
 war-time entente between the Soviet govern-
 ment and its western allies.
 2. Is Soviet Union Re-arming ?
 ANOTHER common misconception re-
 lates to Soviet `aggression' and Soviet
 re-armament. American propaganda is directed
 towards these two points. It is often alleged that
 the Soviet Government is re-arming at a terrific
 pace with the object of committing aggression
 in Western Europe and elsewhere.  American
 propaganda is very persistent on this point.
 In fact, the U. S. government and its allies
 have made the slogan of Soviet military power
 the main justification for their own programme
 of re-armament.  It is, therefore, necessary to
 examine the truth of this charge.
 The exact state of Soviet armament is a state
 secret known only to the Soviet government.
 But certain aspects of Soviet economy throw
 some light on the controversy whether the
 Soviet government is embarking on a pro-
 gramme of re-armament on the scale of Hitler
 or whether it is pursuing a policy of peace and
 reconstruction within its own borders.
 Re-armament cannot be hidden
 It is an elementary fact that any programme
 of re-armament is not possible without the diver-
 sion of a large portion of the material resources
 of the state towards unproductive channels.
 For example, if the U. S. government decides
 to build 10 battle-ships, the result will be that
 colossal quantities of steel and other metals,
 man-power, and technical skill must be taken
 away from the civilian production to be spent
 on the navy. Similarly if the Soviet government
 decides to build 10,000  bombers or fighter
 planes, it must deprive its civilian population
 of the necessary material resources and man-
 power which will be reserved for its armament
 factories.
 The inevitable result of any large scale
 programme of re-armanent are : (1) the rise in
 prices of commodities, (2) the ever-increasing
 scarcity of commodities for civilian consump-
 tion, and (3) the general slowing down of the
 "nation-building" industries.
 A state which embarks on a programme of re-

 Approved For Release 2002/01/04: CIA-RDP83-00415R008500030004-0
 armament may be 'able to hide the exact size and
 extent of its re-armament programme, but it cannot
 conceal from the world the inevitable effect of such
 a re-armament programme on its economic system.
 Its effects in the West
 For example, take the effect in Britain of
 the present increase in armament.  There has
 been a general reduction in "nation-building"
 construction.  The quota of rations for civilian
 consumption has been reduced, and rationing
 has been re-introduced in the case of increasing
 number of commodities. There has also been a
 steady rise in prices all round. Health services
 and other social services have been curtailed.
 As I write these lines, news has arrived of
 the resignation of Mr. Aneurin Bevan from Mr.
 Attlee's government as a protest against the
 decision to reduce social services  and civil
 consumption in the interests of re-armament.
 This decision was a part of the economy
 drive necessitated by the recent re-armament
 programme.  A first class crisis has arisen in
 the British. Labour Party.  There could be no
 more apt illutration of the inevitable effect of
 re-armament on the economy of a country.
 Again take the effect in the U.S.A.  of
 the colossal re-armament programme of the
 U. S. government.  There has been a sharp
 rise in prices and the civilian population has
 been warned to be prepared for further and
 bigger sacrifices in the interests of "national
 security."
 Thus, it is impossible for any state to in-
 crease its armaments unless it simultaneously
 adopts. the following measures : (1) It must
 Truth about the relative size of the
 Soviet and the Anglo-American
 Armies
 The latest Soviet note to the British
 Government reveals the following :
 1.  With combined armed forces of more
 than 5 million men,  the  U.S.A.,
 Britain and France alone now have
 an armed force more than twice as big
 as the total armed forces of the
 Soviet Union.
 2.  While the  Soviet Union has demo-
 bilised thirty-three age groups since
 the end of the war, the U.S.A.,
 Britain and France  arc  rapidly
 increasing their armed forces.
 3.  While the Soviet armed forces are
 today down to the level of 1939, those
 of the U.S.A., Britain and France
 are several times greater than in 1939.
 increase the prices of commodities for civilian
 consumption. (2) It must impose  rationing
 of commodities on a very large scale.  (3) It
 must cut down expenditure on industrial con-
 struction and "nation  building"                                                                           activities.
 If the Soviet government is  increasing its
 armaments and maintaining a large standing
 army (11172 divisions in Europe alone"), then
 its economy must reveal the inevitable con-
 sequences explained above.
 But what is the actual position in the
 U. S. S. R. ?  One would have expected that
 the prices of commodities are rising, that ra-
 tioning had been introduced on a large scale,
 and that `nation-building' construction had
 been cut down as in Hitlerite Germany ("guns
 and not butter"), or as in present-day Britain
 and America.  But what is the actual position?
 Re-armament cannot reduce prices
 As regards prices of commodities, the retail
 prices of food and manufactured goods have been
 reduced by the Soviet governtnent four times since
 1945. The last reductionwas made on March 1,
 1951.  The decision to reduce prices covered
 a wide range of commodities including bread
 and bakery products, cereals, rice, vegetables,
 meat and meat products, fish and fish products,
 fats, cheese and dairy products, soaps, paraffin,
 cosmetics, tobacco products, furniture, crockery
 and glass wares, radio sets,  bicycles, motor-
 cycles, clocks and watches, building materials
 and household goods such as sewing machines,
 cutlery and agricultural  implements.   The
 reduction in prices also extended to prices
 in restaurents, dining rooms, cafes and other
 catering  establishments. The U. S. S. R. is
 the only. country in the world where the prices of
 commodities are steadily going down.
 The important point about this reduction
 in prices must be noted.  It is not an isolated
 act, but a part of a continuous policy of price
 reduction since 1945.     As stated above, the
 reduction in prices on March 1, 1951 was the
 fourth since the end of the war.  Here is a
 remarkable contrast between the Soviet economy
 and the economy of the countries like Britain
 and America.  Whereas in these countries
 the prices of commodities are going up due
 to a general scarcity caused by re-armament,
 the prices of commodities in the U. S. S. R.
 are steadily going  down.  This fact is not
 consistent with a programme of re-armament.
 The second fact to note is a general derationing
 of commodities in the Soviet Union since 1945.  The
 list of derationed  commodities is increasing
 every I year.  For example bread  was  dera-
 tioned quite some time ago.  This  policy of

 policy of reducing prices must
 have resulted in a huge in-
 crease in the  demand' for
 civilian consumption.  How
 is it possible for the Soviet
 government to embark on a
 policy of a large scale clera-
 tioning and reduction in prices
 and thus stimulate the `civilian
 consumption at a time when it
 required, all  the  available
 material resources of the state
 for re-armanent?
 The third fact to note is the
 increase  in what is known as
 `nation building' industries. After
 1945, the Soviet government
 has started huge construction
 works like the Hydro-Electric
 stations on the Volga, Dnieper
 and the Amu Darya and the
 construction of the Main Turk-
 menian, the South Ukrainian,
 North  Crimean and  Volga-
 Don Canals.  These construc-
 tions must     have involved a
 capital expenditure of billions
 of rubles and the diversion of
 huge quantities of material
 resources. Citizens of India
 will contrast the position in
 their own country with that in
 the Soviet Union.  The govern:
 went of India has been compelled
 to abandon many `nation-building'
 projects due to a world-wide scarcity
 of materials caused by the re-
 armament programme of Britain
 and America, but the Sovietgovern-
 ment has not only succeeded in rehabilitating its
 industries destroyed by Germans, but is  actually
 expanding its civilian industry and construction.
 In the face of these facts, let us analyse the
 charge against the Soviet Government that
 it has embarked on a programme of large scale
 re-armament.  Let us assume that the charge
 against the Soviet government about re-arma-
 ment, is true.                      In that case, the simultaneous
 existence of the following conditions in the
 Soviet Union can not be explained by any
 known law of Economics : (1) There is a huge
 expansion of unproductive armament; (2) there
 is also a continuous reduction in the prices
 of commodities and goods for civilian consump-
 tion, (3) there is also a continuous policy of
 derationing;  (4)  and there is also `nation
 building' construction on a huge scale.  All
 these facts taken together, do not make sense.
 The reader ' will also remember that the
 Soviet  State is  poor  compared with    the
 U. S. A. Its material resources  are scanty.
 Whereas America produces more  than 60
 per cent of the world's output ofindustrial goods.
 The Soviet Union can hardly produce enough
 to meet its domestic requirements. Then how
 is it that at a time when the U. S. Government
 is being compelled to raise prices and restrict
 civilian consumption in order to fulfil its re-
 armament programme, the Soviet Union with
 meagre resources, is able to re-arm on a scale
 larger than in America and also reduce prices,
 deration commodities, and expand its `nation-
 building' industries and construction.

 3. is the Soviet Union responsible for
 Western rearmament?
 IT remains to examine the charge against
 the Soviet Government that they are
 responsible for the decision of the Western
 democracies to rearm.  The speeches of Presi-
 dent Truman and Premier Attlee are calculated
 to convince world public opinion that the
 rearmament of America and Western Europe is
 a stern necessity forced on the democracies by
 the menace of communist aggression.  This
 is an argument which requires  careful exa-
 inination by the countries like India.                            Why
 India in particular ?  Because   India has
 good reason to be interested in the rearmament
 controversy.   One of  the  reasons   why
 America has  declined  to  supply capital
 goods and heavy machinery   to India and
 the  other   backward  countries    is the
 alleged compelling necessity for rearmament.
 It is the race in armaments which is responsi-
 ble for India being deprived of the opportunity
 and means    of industrialization. India has
 a right to inquire into the reasons advanced
 in justification of this policy of rearmement.
 Armament older than the Soviets
 The first point to note is that the so-called
 Communist "menace" came into existence in
 1917.  Before that year there was no Soviet
 state and no Communist menace.  One would
 have expected that in the absence of a Com-
 munist menace the Westen democracies would
 have regarded armaments as an unrieeessar~
 waste.  But what was the position before 1914?
 The fact is that America, Britain, France,
 Germany, Japan  and all the  other Great
 Powers were all heavily armed. Worse, they
 had entered upon a headlong race in rearmament
 which was costing millions upon millions of
 rupees.  Thus  an impartial observer must
 come to the conclusion that armaments are a
 much older institution than the Communist
 `menace".  The reader must also admit that
 the decision of the Western democracies to
 engage in an armament race has nothing to
 do with Communist menace.  There must be
 other reasons for it, such as the desire to prevent
 a slump in industry, to stimulate employment
 by an artificial incentive in the shape of huge
 government orders for armaments.
 Another significant fact to note is the attitude
 of the Soviet Government in all the disarma-
 ment conferences from 1928 till the present day.
 In 1928 the Soviet Government made a proposal
 in favour of a complete and universal disarma-
 ment.   Under this proposal every state was
 to disarm completely and was to be allowed
 military forces and armaments just sufficient
 for police purposes within its territory.  The
 Soviet proposal was rejected by every other
 Great Power.
 Subsequently, in 1932 and later years the
 Soviet Government made another proposal
 in favour of a partial disarmament which
 would at least stop the armaments race, which
 was about to begin.  This proposal was again
 rejected by the other Great Powers.
 SOVIET PROPOSALS
 First Session
 Soviet delegation proposed
 1.  General reduction of armaments.
 2. Prohibition of the production and
 the use of atomic energy for military pur-
 poses.
 Second Session
 Vyshinsky proposed on Sept 18, 1947 :
 1.  Condemnation of the criminal
 propaganda for a new war.
 2.  Allowing of such propaganda to
 be regarded as a violation of the duty
 assumed :by member-States under U. N.
 Charter.
 3.  All governments to be urged to
 prohibit war propaganda as a criminal
 offence.
 4.  Earliest implementation of the
 General Assembly's decision of December
 14, 1946, on reduction of armaments.
 and of January 24, 1946, on excluding
 from national armaments the atomic
 weapon and other armaments for mass
 destruction.
 Third Session
 Vyshinsky proposed on Sept 25, '48:
 1.  Reduction of the armaments and
 armed forces of the five Great Powers
 by one-third within one year.
 2.  Establishment of an international
 control body within the frame-work of

 In 1947 the Soviet Government proposed
 a pact banning the use of atomic bombs and
 bacterial warfare.  This proposal was rejected
 by the U. S. Government.  Thus the present
 race in the manufacture of atom bomb has not
 been forced on America and Britain by the
 Soviet Government. On the contrary, the race
 has been forced on the Soviet Government by
 the attitude of the U. S. Government.
 Worse than Hitler
 The U. S. Government and the American
 politicians are quite candid in their attitude to-
 wards the question of the atomic bomb. They
 say that the monopoly of the secret of the bomb
 gives America a military advantage which it
 would be foolish to surrender.  There was no
 way open for the Soviet Government but to go
 ahead with the manufacture of the atom bomb
 until such time when the Soviet stock-pile
 equalled in size its American counterpart.
 Until this stage is reached the atomic race will
 continue and billions upon billions of rupees
 will be wasted in the manufacture of bombs while
 80 per cent of the population of the world
 lives in a condition of indescribable poverty
 and backwardness.
 It is somewhat remarkable that the U.S. Govern-
 ment has adopted an attitude which is worse than
 that of Hitler.  The Nazi Government was quite
 willing to sign a pact banning the use of poison gas
 and chemical warfare.   This pact- was respected
 by both belligerent camps throughout the period of
 the war, until the dropping of the atomic bomb

 Fourth Session
 Vyshinsky proposed on September 23,
 1949 :
 1.  Condemnation of the  prepara-
 tions for a new world  war now being
 conducted in the United  States and
 Great Britain.
 2.  Prohibition of the atom bomb and
 establishment of effective control over
 atomic energy.
 3.  Conclusion of a Peace Pact bet-
 ween the U. S. A. Britain, France, China
 and the U. S. S. R.
 MAY 1951
 over Hiroshima and Jtfagasaki. Why then should
 the U. S. Government be unwilling to sign a simi-
 lar Pact banning the use of the atomic bomb in war?
 .Most Governments of the world including those
 of India, Pakistan, China, Indonesia and even
 Britain are in favour of such a pact.
 Therefore, it is hardly fair to say that the
 responsibility for the present race in arma-
 ments is on the shoulders of Soviet Government.
 How can a Government which has made
 several proposals for disarmament and peace
 be made responsible for the present wasteful
 race in armaments?
 4. Socialist State cannot be
 aggressive
 T HE foreign policy of the U.S.S.R. cannot
 be properly understood without under-
 standing its domestic policy.  The roots of
 every foreign policy lie in the internal con-
 ditions within a state.  For example,  the
 foreign policy of the imperialist powers in the
 second half of the nineteenth century cannot
 be understood without an understanding of the
 Nature of the economic system known as
 imperialism.  The policy of expansion abroad
 had its roots in the economic conditions at home.
 In the case of the Soviet Union, its foreign
 policy can not be properly understood without
 some understanding of the fundamental charac-
 ter of the Soviet State.  Once this character
 is understood by the reader many misconcep-
 tions about the Soviet foreign policy disappear
 from his mind.
 Fifth Session
 Vyshinsky proposed on Sept. 20,1950:
 1.  Condemnation of the propaganda
 for a new war.
 2.  Banning of the atomic weapon
 unconditionally,  institution  of  strict
 international control, and a declaration
 that the Government which shall be the
 first to use it, or any other means of mass
 extermination against any country will
 be regarded as a war criminal.
 3.  Conclusion of a Peace Pact bet-
 ween the U. S. A., Britain, France, China
 and the Soviet Union.
 4. Reduction of the armed forces of the
 five Big Powers by one-third in a year, as
 a preliminary step to further reductions.

 What are the fundamental characteristics of
 the Soviet state? The two features which are
 beyond dispute or controversy are the following :
 (1)  The production of goods and commodities
 in the U.S.S.R is not in the hands of pirate concerns
 but belongs to the state.  Furthermore, the basis
 of production is not the profit motive but planning.
 The most important consequence of this feature
 is that there are no vested interests in the
 U. S. S. R. which stand to gain  by  an
 increase in armaments.     In this matter the
 internal conditions, in the Soviet Union may
 be contrasted with those of Britain, U. S. A.,
 France and other countries where any in-
 crease in armaments immediately results in
 an increase in the rate of profit of big corpo-
 rations like  Du  Pont,  General  Motors,
 Metropolitan Vickers,  Comite des Forges,
 Tatas or Birlas. Therefore in deciding whether
 the war DID NOT
 have the same effects

 U.S.S.R. U.S.A.

 it should re-arm or disarm, the Soviet govern-
 ment has not to contend against powerful
 vested interests whose prosperity depends upon
 an ever-increasing armaments race.
 (2)  The second characteristic of the Soviet
 state is the doctrine of racial equali y.  There may
 be a good deal of controversy about the presence
 or  absence of civil liberties in the Soviet
 state but the existence of complete  racial
 equality in every sphere of social and political
 life throughout the boundaries of the U. S. S. R.
 is a fact which has never been seriously chal-
 lenged even by the enemies of the Soviet state.
 The economic and political implications of the
 doctrine of racial equality must be properly
 appreciated, particularly by nations of Asia
 and Africa who have been struggling in vain
 to persuade the western powers to concede
 equality of status to all  coloured  nations.
 In the economic sphere, the Soviet state insists
 that the benefits of industrialization and modern
 science shall be enjoyed by every nationality in the
 Soviet Union.  In fact, the rate of capital expen-
 diture in the backward regions of the U.S.S.R.
 is much higher than in Russia proper.  Thus
 the Soviet state has not classified its population
 into two sections, an advanced section which
 is industrialised and a backward section which
 is engaged in producing raw materials and
 agricultural products for the advanced section.
 The declared goal of the Soviet government
 is to establish uniform industrial system through-
 out its boundaries.
 In the political sphere, every individual enjoys
 the same status irrespective of race, colour or na-
 tionality.  This  position  may be  contrasted
 with those prevailing in the so-called Negro
 states of the U. S. A. or in the colonial
 empires of the western powers.  In the Czarist
 Empire too, the Asian nationalities (Ar-menians,
 Georgians, Jews and Turkestanis) were treated
 as  inferior races just  as the Indians are
 treated in  South Africa  and Negroes  in
 the southern states of the U. S. A.   The
 October Revolution brought about a funda-
 mental change. For bringing about this change
 credit goes entirely to the Soviet Government
 which has never deviated from the principle of
 racial equality during its 34 years of existence.
 The question which an impartial student of
 international affairs must ask himself is:  Can a
 government which is based on the principle of complete
 racial equality and justice for all nationalities within
 its borders be a tyranny?  Can such a govern-
 ment harbour designs to conquer  the world by
 sword?

 SECOND WORLD PEACE CONGRESS (WARSAW)
 Manifesto to the Peoples
 of the World
 War threatens mankind: every child, every woman, every man.
 The United Nations is not fulfilling the hopes placed in it by the people
 to ensure peace and security,
 All human life and mankind's cultural heritage are in peril.
 The people would cling to the hope that the United Nations will return
 resolutely to the principles upon which it was founded after the Second World War,
 and which consisted of securing freedom, peace and mutual respect between all peoples.
 More and more the peoples of the world are putting their hope in themselves--
 in their determination and in their goodwill.
 Every thinking person knows that he who says : "War is inevitable", slanders
 mankind.
 You, who read this 'message proclaimed in the name of the peoples of
 eighty nations, represented at the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw, must
 never forget that the fight for peace is your own fight.  You should know that
 hundreds of millions of defenders of peace. join in stretching out their hands to
 you.  They invite you to take part in the noblest battle ever waged by a humanity
 confident of its future.
 Peace does not wait on us.  We have to win it.
 Joinyourwill to ours in demanding the cessation of the war which rages in
 Korea and which may set the world ablaze.  Stand up with us in opposing the
 attempt to re-sow the seeds of war in Germany and Japan.
 Together with 500 million human beings who signed the Stockholm Appeal,
 we demand the abolition of atomic weapons, general disarmament and controls
 to accomplish this.  The strict control of general disarmament and of the destruc-
 tion of atomic weapons is technically possible.                    What is needed is the will to do it.
 We demand the outlawing of war propaganda.
 Let us press before all parliaments, all governments and the General
 Assembly of the United Nations for the peace proposals put forward by this
 Second World Peace Congress.
 The power of the forces of peace throughout the world is great enough,
 the voice of free men is strong enough, for us together to secure a meeting of the
 representatives of the five Great Powers.
 The Second World Peace Congress provides, the convincing proof that
 men and women gathered from the five continents of the world can agree, despite great
 d)ferences of opinion, in order to dispel the scourge of war and to maintain peace.
 Let the governments follow this example and peace will be saved.

 SECOND WORLD PEACE CONGRESS (WARSAW)
 Appeal to the United Nations
 When the peoples of the world created
 v  the United Nations, they endowed. it
 with their hopes.  The greatest of these was
 the hope for peace.
 Today, however, war upsets the peaceful
 life of many peoples and threatens tomorrow
 to upset the peace of all mankind.
 If the United Nations is not fulfilling that
 great hope reposed in it by all the peoples
 of the world, both those whose governments
 are represented in it and those not yet represen-
 ted therein-if the United Nations is not
 guaranteeing mankind security and peace,
 this is because it is being influenced by forces
 which   have  disregarded  the  only path
 to universal peace : the search  for general
 agreement.
 If the United Nations  is to realise the
 hopes that the peoples have always reposed
 in it, it must return to the path marked out
 for it by the peoples since the days of its found-
 ation, and, as a first step in this  direction,
 must secure as soon as possible  the calling
 together of a meeting of the five great powers :
 the Chinese People's Republic, France, Great
 Britain, the United States of America and
 the Soviet Union, for the examination and
 peaceful settlement of current differences.
 The  Second World  Congress  of  the
 Defenders of Peace, comprising delegates of
 eighty countries and expressing the true voice
 of a humanity longing for peace, demands
 that immediate consideration be given by the
 United Nations, and by the parliaments to
 which the governments of the various count-
 ries are responsible to the following proposals
 designed to restore  confidence among all
 countries, regardless of their respective systems,
 and to maintain and re-restablish peace :
 1.  In view of the fact that  the war now
 raging in Korea is not only bringing incal-
 culable disaster upon the people of Korea,
 but also threatens to      become a general
 war, we demand the cessation of hostili-
 ties, the withdrawal from Korea of foreign
 armies, and the peaceful settlement of the
 internal conflict between the two parts of
 Korea,  with  the participation  of the
 representatives of the Korean people.  We
 demand that the ,problem be dealt with by
 the Security Council in its full composition-
 that is, including the lawful representatives
 of the Chinese People's Republic.
 We call for the  termination of the
 intervention by American armed forces
 on the Chinese island of Taiwan (Formosa)
 and the cessation of hostilities against the
 Republic  of Viet-Nam, military opera-
 tions which also carry the threat of world war.
 2.    We categorically condemn every move
 made and measure taken in violation of the
 international  agreements  forbidding  the
 remilitarization of Germany and Japan.
 These moves and measures constitute a
 grave threat to peace. We urgently demand
 the conclusion of a peace treaty with a
 united and demilitarized Germany, as well
 as with Japan, and the withdrawal from
 both these countries of the forces of occupa-
 tion.
 3.   We consider the violence employed to hold
 peoples in a state of dependence and colonial
 subjection as a powerful menace to the
 cause of peace and we proclaim the right
 of those people to freedom and indepen-
 dence.  At the same time we raise our
 voices . against every form of racial dis-
 crimination, for it promotes hatred between
 peoples and endangers the peace.
 4.  We consider it necessary to denounce the
 attempts made by the supporters of aggres-
 sion to confuse the very meaning of what
 constitutes aggression and to intervene,
 under one pretext or another, in the inter-
 nal affairs of other nations.
 We declare that  no political,  strategic
 or economic considerations, no motives
 deriving from the internal situation or
 any internal conflict in one or another
 state, can justify armed intervention by any
 other state. That state conmmits the crime
 of aggression which first employs armed
 force under any pretext whatever, against
 another state.
 5. We hold that propaganda for a new war
 constitutes a grave threat to the peaceful
 co-operation of peoples, and we, therefore,
 hold it to be a crime of the deepest gravity
 against humanity.
 We appeal  to the parliaments  of all
 countries to enact a "Law for the Pro-
 tection of Peace", which shall render all
 INDIA TO-DAY

 propaganda for a new war, in any form
 whatsoever, liable to criminal prosecution.
 6. In view of the fact that all decent persons,
 regardless of their political views, regard
 the ruthless mass destruction of civilian
 populations in Korea as a crime against
 humanity, we demand that a competent
 International Court be appointed to exa-
 mine the crimes committed during the war
 in Korea, and in particular the question of
 the responsibility of General Mac-Arthur.
 7. Voicing the demands of peoples who bear
 upon their shoulders the heavy burdens
 of military budgets, and firmly resolved
 to guarantee humanity a firm and stable
 peace, we present for the consideration of
 the United Nations, of all parliaments
 and of all peoples the following proposals :
 Unconditional prohibition of all manner
 of atomic weapons,  and  of bacterio-
 logical,   chemical,                               poisonous,  radio-
 active and all other                             devices of mass
 destruction;
 Denunciation  as  a war criminal of that
 government which henceforth is the first
 to use these weapons.
 The Second World Peace Congress, mind-
 ful of its responsibility to the peoples, appeals
 with equal earnestness, to the great powers
 and calls upon them to launch, during the
 years 1951 and 1952, a gradual, simultaneous 11
 and similarly proportioned reduction of all
 their land, sea  and air armed  forces by
 one-third to one-half of their present size
 Such a step, by putting a decisive end to
 the armaments race, will reduce the danger of
 aggression.  It will help to lighten the budgets
 of States which weigh heavily on all sections
 of the people.  It wit, help also to restore inter-
 national confidence and the  necessary co-
 operation between all nations, regardless of
 their social system.
 The Congress declares that the controls for
 prohibiting atomic weapons and all weapons
 of mass destruction, as well as all conventional
 arms, are technically possible.  An interna-
 tional body, staffed by qualified inspectors,
 should be set up within the frame-work of the
 Security Council and should be made responsi-
 ble for the control of the reduction of conven-
 tional arms as well as the prohibition of atomic,
 bacteriological, chemical and other weapons.
 These controls, to be effective, not only must
 apply to military forces, existing armaments and
 arms  production as  declared  by each na-
 tion, but also, on the demand of the inter-
 national control commission, must be extended
 to include the inspection of military forces,
 existing armaments and arms production which
 is suspected beyond what has been declared.
 These proposals for the reduction of armed
 forces constitute a first step on the road to ge-
 neral and complete disarmament, the final goal
 of all defenders of peace.
 The Second World Congress, convinced
 that peace cannot be secured through an arma-
 ments race seeking a balance of forces, holds
 that these proposals give no military advantage
 to any country, but that they would result in
 halting the drive to war and in advancing the
 well-being and security of peoples of the world.
 8. We emphasise that, in certain countries,
 the passage from a peace economy to a war
 economy is increasingly disturbing normal
 economic relations and the interchange
 between countries both of raw materials and
 industrial goods.  It is our view that this
 exerts a harmful influence on the standards
 of living of many peoples, that it raises
 obstacles to economic progress and business
 relations, and is a source of conflicts end-
 angering the peace of the world.
 Taking into consideration the vital in-
 terests of the populations of all countries,
 and with the desire to improve conditions
 throughout the world, we urge the restora-

 tion of normal trading relations between
 the countries on the basis of mutual advan-
 tage, satisfying the requirements of the
 peoples concerned,  excluding  economic
 discrimination in any form and safeguard-
 ing the development of each national
 economy and the economic independence
 of states, both large and small.
 9. We hold that obstruction of cultural rela-
 tions among the peoples breeds discord
 and  misunderstanding  and  creates an
 atmosphere of distrust, favourable to propa-
 ganda for war.
 We consider that on the other hand,
 the strengthening of cultural  relations
 between  the  peoples  creates conditions
 favourable to mutual understanding.
 Accordingly, we appeal to all govern-
 ments, urging them to contribute towards
 improving  cultural  relations  among the
 peoples, in order to enable them to be-
 come better acquainted with each other's
 treasures in the field of  culture.  We
 appeal to them to facilitate the organisation
 of international conferences of persons
 active in the field of culture, the mutual
 exchange of visits and the publication and
 wide diffusion of the literature and art of
 other countries.
 We draw the attention of the  United
 Nations to the fact that, while calling upon
 it to justify the hopes reposed in it by the
 peoples of the world, we are at the same time
 undertaking the establishment of a World
 Council of Peace.
 The World Council of Peace shall be a
 body embracing representatives of all the

 Resolution against War Propaganda
 T HE Second World Congress of the Dc-
 fenders of Peace, considering :
 That the propaganda favouring war carried
 fon in some countries creates the greatest threat
 to the peaceful co-operation of peoples; and
 That the propaganda favouring war is therefore
 one of the greavest crimes against humanity;
 APPEALS to the parliaments of all countries
 to enact a "law for the Protection of Peace",
 rendering all propaganda for a new war,
 in any form whatsoever, liable to criminal
 prosecution.*
 The Congress appeals to the parliaments
 of all countries, in the interest of strengthening
 peace, to provide for the education of the
 younger generation in a spirit of co-operation
 with other peoples and of respect for other
 races and nations.

 countries  of the  world,  to boycott firmly
 publishing houses, film-producers, press organs,
 broadcasting stations, individuals and organ-
 isations which spread, directly or indirectly,
 propaganda favouring war.  We ask them
 also to protest vehemently against all forms
 of  art and literature which support  such
 propaganda.
 The Congress appeals to all workers of the
 press, in literature, in the arts, in the cinema,
 in education, to refuse to allow themselves or
 their professional media to be used as instru-
 ments of propaganda of hatred and war among
 the  nations, and to take an active part in
 spreading the principles of peace and mutual
 understanding amongst the peoples.

 Resolution on the strengthening of cul-
 tural relations between countries
 WITH a view to ensuring peaceful colla-
 boration  and   mutual   under-
 standing between peoples, the Second World
 Congress of the Defenders of Peace considers
 it necessary to take measures for the strength-
 cuing and development of cultural relations
 between the different countries. The Congress
 recommends :
 In the Field of Science:
 The creation  of international scientific
 associations to include scientists  from every
 country.
 The organisation of scientific congresses
 in the capitals of each state in turn.   Organi-
 sation of visits of scientists to other countries
 for closer mutual relations and for the exchange
 of scientific experience.
 Exchange of literature  between          univer-
 sities and big libraries. Publication of regular
 bulletins with notes on material published
 in the different countries.
 The organisation of visits to other countries
 for young people, students, etc., during holi-
 days.
 In the Field of the Arts :
 The organisation of tours for  theatrical
 companies, orchestras, ballet companies and
 outstanding representatives  of the arts, as
 well as the distribution of films.
 The organisation  of  music festivals, to
 familiarise listeners with the music of other
 countries.
 The organisation of exhibitions of art and
 of folk art.
 Invitations  to  representatives  of other
 countries to take part in the  celebrations of
 national commemorations of important dates
 in history, science,  literaure  and the arts.
 Commemoration of  these        dates in  other
 countries. -
 The translation of literary works,   the
 publication  and  performance     of musical
 works.  Exchange of these as well as notes and
 articles or critical statements about them.
 Widespread publication of world classics
 in literature and in music and reproduction
 of paintings,  sculptures and world-famous
 examples of architecture.
 The development, in each country, of the
 art of translation of literary works from other
 languages.
 Resolutions of-the Berlin Meeting
 of the World Peace Council
 On the Struggle for Peace in the colonies
 and Dependencies
 THE  Charter  of the  United Nations,
 which was based on the right of free
 self-determination  of peoples,  raised  high
 hopes in colonial and  dependent   countries.
 But, in  this sphere, as in many others, the
 attitude of the United Nations, by serving
 as  a  screen  for the methods of force and
 compulsion used to     maintain  peoples in a
 state of dependence and colonial subjection,
 has undermined the hopes placed in it.
 This situation increases the danger of a new
 world war.
 The World Peace Council denounces the
 false propaganda which tends to represent a
 new world war as a path that might lead to
 the  free  self-determination  of the.  colonial
 and dependent peoples, and declares that the
 common action of all peoples side by side for
 peace constitutes a decisive factor in the rea-
 lization by the colonial and dependent peoples
 of the right of free self-determination.
 The proposals towards a peaceful settlement
 of the war in Korea and the  major Asian
 problems-Taiwan, Viet-Nam, Malaya-and
 toward a peaceful settlement of the German
 problem and the Japanese problem, as well as
 the efforts of conciliation by certain Asian,
 Arab, and other peace-loving countries, con-
 tribute at one and the same time toward the
 maintenance of' peace and toward the free
 self-determination of peoples.
 The growing opposition of the colonial and
 dependent peoples to aggression, oppression
 and the stifling of their liberties; to the inclu-
 sion of their countries in aggressive pacts; to
 the raising of native military contingents for
 use against other peoples; to the stationing of
 foreign troops on their territories; to the
 acquisition of military bases and raw materials
 in their countries; to the lowering of their
 cultural values; to measures of race discrimina-
 tion--all contribute vitally to the maintenance
 of peace.
 The World Council proclaims the solidarity
 of all peoples without exception in the struggle
 against the war that threatens all mankind.

 Resolution on a Peaceful Solution of
 the Korean Conflict
 TO secure a peaceful settlement of the
 Korean question, the World  Peace
 Council demands the immediate calling of a
 conference of all countries concerned.
 We call on all lovers of peace in all coun-
 tries to urge their respective governments to
 support the immediate calling of such a con-
 ference.
 The World Peace Council strongly main-
 tains the opinion that all foreign armed forces
 must be withdrawn from Korea to enable the
 Korean people to settle their internal affairs
 for themselves.
 Resolution on the Decision  of the
 United Nations Wrongfully Naming
 the Chinese People's Republic
 an "Aggressor" in Korea
 THE World  Peace  Council recalls the
 definition of aggression adopted by the
 Second World Peace Congress: "That State
 commits the crime of aggression which first em-
 ploys armed force under any pretext whatever
 against another State," and it declares unjust
 and illegal the resolution adopted by the Ge-
 neral Assembly of the United Nations naming
 the Chinese Peoples's Republic an" aggressor"
 in Korea.  This decision constitue;; a serious
 obstacle to the peaceful solution of the Korean
 question; it threatens extension of the war in
 the Far East and, consequently, threatens the
 outbreak of a new world war.
 The World Peace Council demands that
 the United Nations rescind this resolution.
 Resolution on the United Nations
 THE World Peace Council has taken note
 that the United Nations has failed to
 reply to the Address of the Second World Con
 gress, as though proposals for the maintenance
 of peace advocated by the  representatives of
 hundreds of millions of human beings did not
 concern it.
 Since the adoption of that Address, the
 U.  N.  has still further disappointed the
 hopes the peoples had placed in it and has
 raised this disappointment to a climax by the
 resolution condemning China as an "aggressor'.
 It has sanctioned, and covered  by
 authority, the systematic destruction in Korea,
 by the American  armed forces,  of almost
 a million human beings, including old people,
 women and children, crushed or burnt in the
 debris of their towns and villages.
 The World Peace Council  resolves to
 dispatch to the U.N. a delegation comprising
 Signor Nenni (Italy), Mme.  Isabelle Blume
 (Belgium), Mrs. S.O. Davies (Great Britain),
 Mrs. Jessie Street (Australia ), M. d'Astier de
 ]aVigerie (France), Mr. Tikhonov (U.S.S.R),
 Mr. Wu Yao-tsung (Chinese Peoples Repub-
 lic),  Mr. Hromadka  (Czechoslovakia),  M.
 Gabriel  d'Arboussier (Black Africa), Senor
 Pablo Neruda (Chile), Genral Heriberto Jara
 (Mexico),  Mr.  Paul Robeson  and Rev.
 Willard Uphaus (U.S.A), Dr. Atal (India)*.
 This delegation shall be charged to demand
 of the U.N.:
 1.  That it consider the various points
 of the Address of the World Peace Congress
 and the various resolutions adopted at this
 session of the World Council and express an
 opinion on each.
 2.  That it return to the role assigned to it
 by the Charter, namely,  that it should serve
 as an area of agreement between the govern-
 ments and not as the instrument of any do-
 minant group.
 This decision of the World Council will
 have the support of hundreds of millions of
 men and women who have a right to maintain
 a vigilant watch to ensure that high interna-
 tional organs do not betray their mission of
 safegurading peace.
 *  As we go to the press, the news has  come that
 Mr. Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General of the U. N. 0,
 has informed the World Peace Council that he is ready
 to receive the delegation.
 Resolution on a Peaceful Solution
 of the Japanese Question
 IN pursuance of the decisions of the Second
 World Peace Congress, the World Peace
 Council strongly condemns theremilitarization
 of Japan now being effected by the occupying
 power against the wishes of the Japanese
 people.
 The World Peace Council considers it
 essential that a referendum on the remilitari-
 zation of Japan and the conclusion of a peace
 treaty with a peaceful and demilitarized Japan
 be held in Japan and in the countries most
 concerned in Asia, America and Oceania.
 The World Peace Council condemns all
 attempts to conclude a separate peace with

 Japan.  It considers that a peace treaty must     Resolution on Organization and Develop-
 be the subject of negotiations in the first ins-                           ment of the Peace Movement
 tance by the People's Republic of China, the
 United States of America, the Soviet Union and
 Great Britain, and agreed to by all the countries
 concerned.  All occupation forces must be
 withdrawn from Japan immediately after con-
 clusion of the peace treaty.
 The Japanese people must be guaranteed
 a demoratic and peaceful life.
 All military organiztions and institutions,
 acknowleged or concealed., must be forbidden,
 and the whole of industry must be directed
 towards a peace economy.
 The  World  Peace  Council  invites  all
 friends of peace in Asia and the Pacific area,
 including those in Japan, to hold on the earliest
 suitable date a regional conference for the
 defence of peace, in order to achieve a peace-
 ful solution to the Japanese  question                   and
 thereby dispel a serious source of danger of
 war in the Far East.
 Resolution on a Peaceful Settlement
 .  of the German Problem
 MILITARIST and Nazi forces are being
 MILITARIST
 in Germany, in betrayal of
 the resolve of the peoples in  whose name
 were concluded the treaties which categorically
 insist  on  Germany's  disarmament.    This
 rearmament,  military  and     industrial, of
 Germany constitutes the gravest of the dangers
 threatening a new world war.
 The World Peace        Council  notes  with
 satisfaction the growth of the forces of peace
 in Germany and welcomes        the gratifying
 success of the Peace Congress of Essen.  It
 commends the friends of peace in Germany
 for undertaking, as a task in which peace-
 loving people of all tendencies are participating,
 a referendum in which the German people
 shall express their will on the question of the
 remilitarization of their country and on the
 conclusion of a peace treaty that shall put
 an end to the present dangerous state of un-
 certainty.
 The World Peace Council calls upon the
 peoples most directly menaced to unite in a vigo-
 rous movement of protest of millions of men
 and women to secure from their governments
 the conclusion, in the course of the current
 year, of a treaty of peace with a peaceful and uni-
 ted Germany, whose demilitarization, ensured
 by an international agreement, will constitute
 the best guarantee of peace in Europe.
 1 HE World Peace Council, at its meeting
 in Berlin in February 1951, notes with
 satisfaction what has already been done to carry
 out the decisions of the Second World Cong-
 ress and considers that these activities must be
 still further developed.
 The Council in,particular urges all national
 committees greatly to increase the circulation
 and popularization of the Address to the Unit-
 ed Nations Organization.  The Address must
 reach every corner of the earth; it must be
 made known to every man and every woman.
 The Council calls upon every peace-lover to
 show the greatest initiative in this task both
 nationally and internationally.
 The Council records and welcomes the fact
 that a number of countries have passed laws
 against war propaganda.
 It urges national committees to take steps
 to frame proposals for Peace Defence Acts for
 presentation to the national parliaments.  It
 calls upon national committess to inform pub-
 lic opinion on these efforts so as  to secure
 the widest public support.
 It urges national committees  to put  the
 people on their guard and to mobilize them
 to  denounce  and  bycott  all publications,
 schoolbooks, films, radio broadcasts, etc., which
 contain any incitement to war.
 It asks national committees  to  launch a
 great campaign of enlightenment in which
 thousands of men of goodwill in each country
 will ceaselessly expose the falsehoods that aid
 the preparation of war.
 It proposes that the Bureau take steps to
 set up, under the Secretariat, an information
 office to supply a service of  accurate and
 objective information  in order to defeat false
 or tendentious news designed to whip up a
 war psychosis.
 *
 The World Peace Council welcomes  the
 relations which have  been  established, in
 accordance with the decisions of the Second
 World Congress, with numerous associations
 and groupings and expresses its satisfaction at
 the contribution to the further extension and
 development of the peace movement which
 these contacts have made possible.
 The Council resolves :
 1.  To continue discussions with the move-
 ment of `mondialists' in different countries
 with a view to defining points of agreement
 and joint activity, and encouraging reciprocal
 participation in conferences and congresses.

 2.  That the equal-representation meeting
 suggested by the Society of Friends, be ar-
 ranged, the documents and resolutions of the
 two movements forming the basis for a discus-
 sion of conditions for joint action.
 3.  To bring the resolutions adopted at
 this session to the notice of the Churches and to
 solicit their support.  The President of the
 Council, Professor Joliot-Curie, has already
 written in the name of the Bureau to the high-
 est Church authorities informing them of the
 Second World Congress resolution on disar-
 mament.  Several replies received to date are
 indicative of the interest evoked by this mes-
 sage.
 4.  That it is necessary to develop relations
 with circles in various countries which favour
 neutrality so that they may be encouraged to
 take'eff'ective action in behalf of peace.
 5.  To work for co-operation with pacifist
 movements and with all groups,  contact and
 co-operation with which can serve the cause
 of peace.
 *              *              *
 The World Council welcomes the proposals
 and steps already taken for calling internation-
 al conferences which will enable those quali-
 fied to represent opinion in various countries
 to exchange views and  jointly to seek the
 solution of problems in the interests of world
 peace.
 In conformity with this, the World Council
 1.  Approves   the  convocation  by  the
 Franco-Belgian  Movement Against German
 Rearmament of a conference of the peoples of
 the European Atlantic Pact countries, together
 with the German people, in Paris or Brussels,
 at the earliest possible date.  The  object of
 this conference shall be to examine the ques-
 tion of combating remilitarization of Germany
 and attainment of a peaceful solution of the
 German problem;
 -2.  Approves the proposal for the organiza-
 tion of a conference of the countries of Asia
 and the Pacific, the principal object of which
 shall be the struggle against Japanese rear-
 mament and the peaceful solution of existing
 conflicts, and also the holding of a popular
 referendum in the Asian and Pacific countries
 concerned on the remilitarization of Japan
 and the conclusion of a peace treaty with her
 in the current year;
 3.  Requests the Bureau to - support the
 organization of regional conferences,
 (a) of the countries of the Near East and
 North Africa, and
 (b) of the Scandinavian countries.
 4.  Recommends that the Secretariat envis-
 age the organization of similar conferences,
 (a) of the countries of Black Africa, and
 (b) of the countries of North America and
 Latin America.  (This! conference should he
 held in Mexico next August.)
 The World Council decides to call an Inter-
 national Economic Conference, to be held in
 the U. S. S. R. in the summer of 1951.  This
 conference shall be open to economists, techni-
 cians, industrialists, businessmen and trade-
 unionists of all countries, and its object shall
 be to consider ways and means of re-establish-
 ing economic relations and raising the general
 standard of living.
 The conference shall discuss the following
 subjects :
 (a) Opportunities for improving standards of
 living in the middle of the twentieth century
 under peace conditions;
 (b) Opportunities for improving economic
 relations between all countries.
 In accordance with the resolution of the
 Second World Congress on cultural exchanges,
 the World Council recommends  its Bureau
 to give full support to the organization of a
 conference of members of the medical pro-
 fession, which has already been initiated by
 leaders of the profession in France and Italy,
 and which should be held in Italy during
 this year.  This conference shall be devoted
 to the problem of combating the evil effects
 of war  preparations  on  the  public  health
 services.
 The Council directs the Secretariat to study
 the possibility of, and encourage international
 conferences to  discuss  ways  and means of
 developing national cultures and international
 cultural collaboration under peace conditions.
 (Conferences of writers and artists, scientists,
 film producers.)
 A conference of writers and artists shall be
 convened in 1951.
 It directs the Bureau to explore the possi-
 bility of founding a film centre that will en-
 courage and co-ordinate the production and
 distribution of peace films and will combat the
 use of the cinema for war propaganda.
 It recommends the Secretariat to. approach
 peace-loving scientists with a view to encourag-
 ing them to urge the national and interna-
 tional scientific organizations to which they
 belong to adopt as a charter principle the
 demand that their discoveries shall be used
 for peaceful purposes only....

 I remember a tune we used to hear in Spain
 And it made the heart beat faster, and we

 Why the blue sky above 'us was so blue.

 Like the cry of migrant birds, a tune which

 In the silence, after the notes, a stifled sob
 Revenge of the salt seas on their conquerors.
 I remember a tune which was whistled at

 In a sunless time, an age with no wandering

 When children wept for the bombs and in
 catacombs
 A noble people dreamt of the tyrants' doom.
 It bore in its name the sacred thorns which
 pierced
 The- brow of a god as he hung upon  the
 gallows
 The song that was heard in the ear and felt
 in the flesh
 Reopened the wound in his side and revived
 his sorrows.

 All the words were forbidden and yet I know

 In that country's heart, though hidden under-

 The dumb will speak and the paralytics

 The crown of blood, the symbol of anguish

 The evil men who today rule over France,
 wanted to damn Henri Martin in the eyes of
 the French people.  But they could not think
 up anything better than the simple trick of
 putting up before the same Tribunal which
 was trying Henri Martin a  quarter-master
 named Heimberger, accused of sabotage on
 the air-craft  carrier  "Dixmude".  The  re-
 actionary press made a great fuss about it,
 trying to connect both the cases and hinting
 that the act of sabotage was committeed on
 the instructions of Henri Martin.
 Martin angrily rejected this charge in a
 magnificent letter.  He said:
 "We are 8 million Frenchmen who do not
 want to die either for the American Imperial-
 ists or for the French capitalists.  We are,
 therefore,  sufficiently strong.  It is because
 of this that ,I reject individual sabotage. I have
 confidence in the strength of the people."
 And then with the following statement
 of the quarter-master Heimberger, the charge
 of sabotage collapsed completely:
 t e
 I would be fighting for the happiness o
 people of Viet-Nam. Liberty, Equality, Fra-
 ternity, are not empty words for me. 1 do not
 wear a uniform on my heart, nor on my conscience.
 I am ready to give my life for my country.
 I have not changed.  If they have dragged
 me before this tribunal, it is because the men
 who rule my country, betray it as at the time
 of the occupation."
 The President of the Tribunal:  When you
 enlisted, you knew that you would have to
 obey orders for waging war.            -
 Henri Martin:   I did not enlist to wage
 a war which strikes at women and youngsters.
 The President:  Have you got proof of
 what you have said?
 Henri Martin: Yes, at Haiphong we shot
 at a column when we did not know whether
 they were civilians or soldiers.
 The President:  Do you accept the author-
 ship of the leaflet entitled" SAILORS, VOTE
 FOR PEACE !" ?
 Henri Martin: Yes,
 on my request and

 this leaflet was written
 distributed by other
 Approved
 searrcen, after I had asked them whether they
 were in agreement with the fight for peace.
 The President:  Did  you receive foreign
 inspiration for writing this leaflet ?
 Henri Martin: I did not need. that.  It
 is sufficient to see . what  still needs to be
 reconstructed in our country to understand
 that the military credits are too high, and
 that instead of waging a war in Indo-China,
 it would be better to place all the forces of
 our country into the fight for peace.
 The President:  I do not want to reproach
 you for this, but when one is a sailor, one
 has certain obligations, especially as you have
 received the enlistment allowance.
 Henri Martin:   So you mean 'to say, that
 we are not sailors, but mercenaries ?
 The President:  You  enlisted  to go to
 Indo-China!
 Henri Martin:.  It was not the the attrac-
 tiveness of the allowance which made me
 go there.  I wanted to fight against the
 Japanese aggressors and not against the Viet-
 Namese people.  It is true, that when I saw
 the work I had to do, I asked three times
 for a cancellation of my enlistment.  Three
 times I was refused. Besides, to those who
 reproached me for  casting a slur on the
 discipline and the morale of the sailors, I
 replied, that there was nothing in asking the
 sailors to vote for peace. I repeat that we
 are not mercenaries but republican sailors.
 . The President:  But in  distributing the
 leaflet: "Not a man, not a penny :for Indo-
 China", you have made the apology for
 disobedience.
 Henri  Martin: It is not  disobedience
 when it is a question of fighting against a
 government which betrays the 'interests of
 France.   Those   who  fought against the
 Vichy Government are not traitors.
 The President:    So everyone can do as he
 pleases
 Henri Martin:  There is a fundamental
 difference between doing as one pleases, and
 obeying criminal orders.  As far as I am con-
 cerned, what I have seen in  Indo-China- is
 quite sufficient. Between March and Decem-
 ber, 1946, at a time when the agreement of
 March 6 was in force, we, among others, sank
 junks loaded with rice which the Heaclquarters
 had agreed to permit to reach Haiphong for
 feeding the civilian population, and my own
 officer said: "Oh, these bastards!"

 Henri Martin:    I will not become an accom-

 The Defence Lawyer, Mr. Vienney: To every-
 one his role Mr. President!...
 Yes, to everyone his role.
 To the Jules Mochs and the Rene Plevens
 the role of the tyrants of their own people and
 of the murderers of the Viet-Namese.
 To Henri Martin the role of a fighter for
 the"freedom and the honour of his own country
 and for international brotherhood of all the
 peoples of the world.
 The Jules Mochs and the Rene Plevens
 are desecrating the great traditions of France,
 the land of the French Revolution and  the
 Paris Commune.
 Henri Martin in fighting against the un-
 just war in Viet-Nam is defending the honour
 of France and is carrying forward the heritage
 of the Jacobins and the Communards, of
 Gabriel Peri and the 75,000 who fell fighting
 against Hitler and  Petain, and  of Andre
 Marty, who organised the  historic  Revolt
 of the Black Sea Fleet at Odessa. when the
 French Imperialists were trying to intervene
 against the young Soviet Republic of Russia.
 Salute to Henri Martin ! In the fight for
 Peace we shall learn from his heroic example.

 security:
 "We demand the conclusion of a peace pact among

 "We would consider a refusal to meet to conclude
 such a pact, by the Government of any of the great

 aggressive design on the part of the Government

 that hope  for peace, to   add their names in its
 support.".
