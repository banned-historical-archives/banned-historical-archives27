 1.  ANALYSIS
 Preparations for the establishment of a clandestine
 Communist party organization or illegal apparat parallel
 to the party's legal overt organization have recently been
 reported in several Free World Communist parties. * There
 are also indications that legally operating Communist parties
 in countries where previous conditions of suppression
 prompted the establishment of illegal apparats are taking
 steps to strengthen their apparats.  There is some evidence
 to show that the emphasis on illegal organization may go hand
 in hand with an increased effort by each. Communist party to
 penetrate its country's police and military forces.  Finally,
 * Clandestine activity in some form is always a part of the
 Communist party operations in a Free World country
 regardless of whether the party is legal or illegal.  For
 example, a Communist party may set up a special clan-
 destine mechanism or apparat to facilitate the channeling
 of funds.  Such an apparat may or may not be illegal in
 the sense of being against the laws of the country, but is
 frequently referred to by the Communists themselves as
 an "illegal apparat".  As used in this paper, the term
 "illegal apparat" refers to a clandestine party organization
 compartmented from the party's conventional organization,
 whose members are not generally known as Communists,
 whose primary purpose is the continuance of party opera-
 tions under conditions of severe repression, and which may
 include organizational provision for violent action up to the
 level of paramilitary forces.

 there are indications that Communist parties in several
 countries have either established a capability for armed
 action, such as a paramilitary force, or demonstrated an
 interest in such a capability.  Whether this capability is
 part and parcel of the existing (or planned, as the case may
 be) illegal organization or a special compartmented mechanism
 of the Party, is as yet undetermined.
 It should be noted further that at least one illegal party,
 the KPD in West Germany, recently has been reported --
 although not confirmed -- as establishing a separate clan-
 destine apparatus for sabotage and armed action divorced
 from the political mechanism of the Party.  Also, a usually
 reliable source has recently reported that in the illegal CP
 of Panama all new memberships are on a clandestine basis.
 This suggests either that the CP Panama is establishing a
 separate illegal organization comprising unknown Communists
 distinct from the known CP which is technically illegal;  or
 that the existing illegal organization is being improved and
 more stringent security practices are being instituted.   CP
 Australia, it may be noted, is known for using secret Party
 members for its illegal operations.
 Communist parties reported to be in varying stages of
 establishing a clandestine party organization or improving
 an existing organization include those of Argentina, Brazil,
 Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Venezuela, and the USA
 in the Western Hemisphere;  France, Italy and West Germany
 in Europe;  India, Israel, Lebanon, and Pakistan in the Near
 and Middle East;  and Indonesia and Japan in the Far East.
 For most of these parties the pressure of local events made
 the question of establishing an illegal apparat an immediate
 problem.    The reported attention to illegal apparats by the

 above parties may be indicative of similar attention by other
 parties of the International Communist Movement (hereafter
 referred to as ICM).
 Although a CP normally works with both overt and clan-
 destine methods, it tends to stress one or the other based on
 local political conditions and the prevailing tactical line of
 the ICM.  Since the 20th Party Congress of the CPSU in
 February 1956, the tactical line for the ICM has emphasized
 for the CP's in the Free World the employment of legal
 methods, coupled with the penetration, exploitation, and
 manipulation of nationalist and amenable leftist and trade
 union forces in a massive offensive.
 There are indications that some CP's, particularly in
 Free World countries where political conditions are favorable
 to legal parliamentary tactics, emphasized legal means
 almost to the exclusion of clandestine operations.  Other
 CP's, with limited resources, concentrated on the parlia-
 mentary struggle rather than disperse their limited resources.
 It is believed that this situation appeared deplorable to the
 CPSU, which foresaw its offensive tactics leading either to
 counterpressures forcing the CP's to go underground or to a
 situation favorable to a takeover by the CP.  From its view-
 point, under these conditions, an illegal apparat or clandestine
 organization paralleling and compartmented from the overt
 party would be considered essential;  in the former case to
 protect the party and in the latter case to play a key role if
 required.  The situation is also believed to have appeared
 unsatisfactory to the CPSU with respect to certain illegal
 parties which, long suppressed, had placed too great an
 emphasis upon purely clandestine agent operations -- result-
 ing in a consequent weakening of the illegal membership base

 of the Party.  An example of this is the 1957 criticism of
 Zachariades by the KKE Central Committee in the Soviet
 bloc, in which he was described as following a "line of
 detachment from the masses".  Accordingly, the CPSU
 appears 'to have decided to take necessary corrective
 measures.
 The renewed emphasis on the establishment of illegal
 or parallel apparats by Communist parties in the Free
 World appears to have stemmed from the gathering of delega-
 tions from some sixty-five Communist parties at Moscow in
 November 1957 for the 40th anniversary celebration of the
 October Revolution.  Stressing the importance of this
 gathering for the ICM, the Soviet press at that time commented
 that "there has been no event like it in the Communist move-
 ment for more than twenty years," an obvious comparison to
 the important Seventh (and last) World Congress of the
 Comintern held in 1935.  The conclusions of the Moscow
 gathering were embodied in the Twelve-Party Declaration
 which set the policy for the ICM.  Significantly, this
 declaration restricted the "parliamentary road to Socialism"
 to "a number of capitalist countries" and stated that in case
 of resistance by reactionary forces, "the possibility of non-
 peaceful transition to Socialism should be borne in mind. "
 Pursuant to this latter proviso, the CPSU leaders secretly
 pointed out to representatives of the Free World Communist
 parties the advisability of establishing illegal or parallel
 apparats and increasing efforts to penetrate the security
 services.  Some party leaders, notably the secretary-
 general of the Indian Communist Party, raised objections to
 establishing an illegal apparat, and no firm agreement or
 policy binding on all parties appears to have been reached at
 that time. However, even the Indian Communist Party con-
 curred in the advisability of increasing efforts to penetrate
 the security services.

 Following the November 1957 Moscow Conference, Soviet
 representatives are believed to have reiterated to a number
 of Communist parties the CPSU desire for the establishment
 of illegal apparats.  Particular attention appears to have been
 given by these functionaries to the parties reluctant to under-
 take this action.  That the CPSU achieved some success in
 its over-all efforts. is indicated by the fact that during 1958
 the Communist parties of Argentina, Brazil, Peru and
 Venezuela in. Latin America;  France and Italy in Europe;
 India, Israel, Lebanon and Pakistan in the Near and Middle
 East;  and Indonesia, and Japan in the Far East were reported
 in varying stages of establishing or strengthening illegal
 apparats and/or preparing for paramilitary activities.  Of
 these parties, the case of the Indian Communist Party (CPI)
 is perhaps most interesting because the CPSU had to over-
 come a strong reluctance on the part of the leadership of the
 CPI to the establishment of an illegal apparat.
 Subsequently, the CPSU used the occasion of its 21st
 Party Congress (held at Moscow from 27 January to 5
 February 1959 and attended by some seventy-two CP delega.
 tions) to emphasize again to selected Free World Communist
 parties the necessity of establishing illegal apparats and
 developing a capability for armed action in case of need.
 Guidance on these points was given to representatives of
 certain Free World CP's attending the Congress by CPSU
 officials, including Khrushchev himself.  Similar guidance
 was given by officials of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
 including MAO Tse-tung, to CP representatives from Latin
 America who visited Peiping after the 21st Congress of the
 CPSU.
 In guidance to the Italian Communist Party (PCI),
 Khrushchev is reported to have stated that a crucial period

 for the peace of the world was at hand and that the party's.
 clandestine organization should be reviewed and strengthened
 in view of this grave prospect.       He emphasized that even if
 the Berlin situation did not reach the point of armed conflict,
 the need for a strong illegal apparat was vital because of the
 possibility of suppressive action against the C.P's in Western
 Europe.
 With respect to the Indian Communist Party, the Japan
 Communist Party, and probably other Communist parties in
 the Middle East and Far East, leading CPSU and CPC
 officials pointed out that recent military coups as in Burma,
 Pakistan, and Sudan and the development of repressive anti-
 Communist policies by governments in these areas seriously
 threaten the survival of the CP's.  The Indian Communist
 Party and possibly others were admonished to meet this
 threat by developing apparats capable of armed resistance,
 or at least by building the cadre of an underground party.
 They were also instructed to intensify their efforts to
 penetrate their countries' military and police circles.
 With respect to Latin America, CPC officials gave a
 detailed briefing on the necessity of establishing illegal
 apparats to the representatives of fifteen Latin American
 Communist parties* who visited Red China in February and
 March 1959 after the 21st CPSU Congress.  This briefing was
 given in a context of encouraging the Latin American CP's to
 `Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia,
 Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
 Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela.

 pursue the "national liberation struggle" which the Cuban
 revolution had shown could be successful in the imperialist
 rear.  Although. the CPC approved of the armed revolution
 which occurred in Cuba, it was recommended that elsewhere
 peaceful and legal tactics should be tried first.  The time for
 armed struggle would be determined by the conditions of
 imperialist oppression rather than by the Communistst own
 decision.  The Communist parties must be prepared for this
 eventuality, and therefore an illegal apparat functioning
 parallel to a legal or semi-legal Communist party in each
 country must be established.  The important' aspect, accord-
 ing to CPC officials who briefed James Jackson of the CPUSA
 (secretary for .negro and southern affairs), was not that a
 Communist party have a large membership, but that it have
 an underground organization in reserve and protected.
 The CPC officials emphasized that the knowledge of the
 existence of the illegal Communist party must be limited to
 members of the Central Committee of the legal CP, and
 better still, to only a few of them.  The illegal CP should
 never surface, even if conditions of legality permit.  When
 part of the illegal CP or one of its members loses contact,.
 by reason of investigation or repression, the "lost" unit or
 individual should join the overt, legal CP without even
 mentioning the illegal CP.  The illegal CP should be organ-
 ized in highly compartmented form to avoid destruction when
 part of it is discovered.
 The CPC officials pointed out that the CPC used this
 system to advantage, especially in Shanghai, where without
 it the CPC could not have been so successful.  They stated,
 moreover, that a truly clandestine Communist party operating
 alongside a legal CP is essential to avoid disaster brought

 Approved For Release 2000/05/05 : CIA-RDP78-00915R001200040003-1
 about by total repression.  In addition, the parallel illegal
 CP, apart from its normal tasks, is in a good position to
 obtain financial assistance from various sources for both
 the overt and covert CP organizations, and to facilitate the
 collection of information.
 It appears that both the CPSU and the CPC agreed that
 the various CP's should operate legally, if possible, while
 holding an illegal apparat in reserve for the defense of the
 party or for offensive action at the proper time.  However,
 within the framework of increased fraternal liaison and
 assistance as sanctioned by the CPSU, the CPC, in its
 guidance and training of other CP's, has stressed clandestine
 work, citing in particular practical illustrations from the
 CPC's own successful rise to power.  CPSU training of CP
 functionaries, on the other hand, has been, so far as is
 known, of a more academic nature.   There is also some
 evidence that the CPC in its guidance and training of other
 CP's is seeking to increase its influence and stature within
 the ICM by presenting its experiences as more up-to-date
 and pertinent for parties currently engaged in "national
 liberation struggles" than the experiences of any other
 Communist party.  It appears that Latin American Com-
 munists in particular are becoming more inclined to regard
 the CPC as their guide to the revolution on the grounds that
 problems faced by the CPC are similar to those confronting
 Communists in Latin America, and that therefore the CPC
 experience has considerable applicability.  Because clan-
 destine work played such a large part in the CPC rise to
 power, more emphasis on illegal apparats may thus be
 expected in those CP's susceptible to CPC influence.  In
 the reported cases of Communist parties establishing a
 clandestine party organization or improving an existing
 organization, the extent of progress varies from party to

 party.  In some cases only initial preparations have been
 made to meet the possibility of the party being outlawed.
 Such preparations include arrangement for safekeeping of
 documents and valuable movable property, the establishment
 of secure communications channels, the designation of sub-
 stitutes for well-known key personnel, and the training of
 selected personnel for the clandestine party.  In other cases
 organizational preparations have progressed to the point
 where an underground cadre is in being with leaders
 selected and secret party members instructed and recruited.
 In some instances organizational measures have gone so far
 as to include the establishment of clandestine paramilitary
 groups or "shock troops", the acquisition and caching of
 arms, paramilitary training, and preparations for sabotage
 (including training in preparation of explosives and other
 sabotage techniques).  However, as noted previously, the
 exact relationship between the paramilitary structure of a
 party and that party's illegal apparat is not clear.
 In certain cases selected secret CP members were
 designated to form an ostensibly non-Communist party to
 operate legally in the event the Communist party is outlawed.
 Use of a front party operating legally is, of course, an
 accepted Communist technique in countries where the CP is
 both illegal and suppressed.
 Personnel involved in the establishment of illegal
 apparats or paramilitary forces appear as a general rule to
 fall into one or more of the following categories:
 a.   Individuals known in the past to be represent-
 ative of the group within the CP most inclined towards
 violent tactics.  Examples of this are Putchalapalli
 Sundarayya and Harkishan Singh Surjit in the CP India,

 Approved For Release 2000/05/05 : CIA-RDP78-00915R001200040003-1
 and Rafael ECHEVERRIA Flores and Jorge
 RIVADENEIRA A. in the CP Ecuador.
 b.   Persons with past experience in illegal or
 paramilitary activities.  Here again are Sundarayya
 and Surjit;  Charles Tillon of the CP France, an ex-
 resistance fighter;  and Suhayl Yamut and Ibrahim
 Munaymnah of the CP Lebanon, both known to have
 previously engaged in terrorist activities.
 c.   Persons holding party positions which have
 historically been involved in the establishment of illegal
 apparats, (i. e.  Organization Secretary,  Control Com-
 mission Chairman,  Cadre Department head).                                      As
 examples, Phil Bart, organization secretary of the
 CPUSA, was made responsible for the establishment of a
 skeleton illegal apparat;  Jorge RIVADENEIRA A. , the
 secretary for organization of the Pichincha Provincial
 Committee of the CP Ecuador, is allegedly responsible
 for the organization of a paramilitary force;  Jesus
 Encarnacion VALDEZ_ Ochoa, secretary for organization
 of the CP Mexico, and Arnaldo MARTINEZ Verdugo, his
 deputy, are believed to have received a briefing on illegal
 apparats from CPC officials.
 It is possible that training in the Bloc may also be a
 characteristic which could serve to identify persons concerned
 with illegal apparats.  Rafael ECHEVERRIA Flores and
 Ricardo PAREDES of the CP Ecuador have both recently com-

 is a Communist student at the University of San Marcos with
 no known official position within the Party.

 In the past two years, the following legal parties
 previously reported as possessing illegal apparats are
 believed to have taken steps to improve their clandestine
 organizations -- either as a direct result of the pressure
 of local events or in response to guidance received from
 the CPSU and/or the CPC,
 France
 Despite its long-established illegal apparat, prob-
 ably neglected in recent years, the French Communist
 Party (PCF) was in no position to operate illegally when
 de Gaulle came to power.  Subsequent to the de Gaulle
 takeover in May 1958, the PCF, fearing that it would be
 outlawed, reportedly undertook preparations for such an
 eventuality.  These preparations involved protection of
 documents and valuable movable property, decentraliza-
 tion of Party leadership, localization of the printing of
 propaganda, penetration of opposition political groups
 as well as the police and army, etc.  However, these
 efforts were not long-lived and present indications are
 that the PCF has ceased all such preparations, at least
 on a broad and observable scale.
 Indications that the Indonesian Communist Party
 (PKI) possesses an illegal apparat have been received
 from the immediate post-World War II period up to the
 present.  Not least among these indications has been
 the revelation from time to time of the existence of

 secret PKI members in the ranks of other parties or in
 high government circles.
 D. N. Aidit, secretary-general of the PKI, who
 attended the 21st Congress of the CPSU, is known to have
 returned via Communist China where he met with CPC
 officials (including MAO Tse-tung).  Since the CPC is
 known to have briefed Latin American CP delegates who
 returned from the Congress via Peiping on illegal
 apparats, it is quite possible that Aidit received a
 similar briefing.
 .  Information received subsequent to Aidit's return
 suggests that the PKI is expanding and strengthening its
 illegal apparat.  Since about April 1959, new PKI cadres
 have been brought directly into the underground Party
 and not into the overt Party organization as was pre-
 viously done;  and in June 1959, a fairly reliable source
 revealed that the PKI intended to infiltrate the "Angkatan
 '45" (Generation of 1945) organization in order to develop
 it as a mechanism through which to carry on Party
 activities in the event the PKI should be outlawed or
 suppressed.
 Italy
 While there have been indications in the past that the
 PCI maintains an illegal apparat, it is not believed to
 have been very extensive or particularly active.  It has
 been reported to have been involved in limited prepara-
 tions for underground activity in the event the PCI should
 be outlawed, but its main activity seems to have been
 the penetration of Italian government institutions and
 political parties.  However, as a result of discussions

 with CPSU officials at the time of the 21st Congress,
 the PCI has reportedly increased its preparations for
 clandestine activity in the event the Party should be
 declared illegal.
 The following legal parties, in the past two years, have
 taken steps towards the establishment of a clandestine organ-
 ization parallel to the overt :party organization.  While some
 of these parties certainly acted under the pressure of local
 events, others are reliably reported to be acting in response
 to guidance from the CPSU and the Communist Party of
 China (CPC).
 Argentina
 In the latter part of January 1959 the Argentine Com-
 munist Party (PCA) showed its concern over the possi-
 bility of illegality when it issued directives cautioning
 PCA members against any actions which would provoke
 the Argentine Government into declaring the Party
 illegal and instructing cell leaders to begin training
 Party members in underground techniques.  At that
 time, Felipe BESRODNIK, a member of the Central
 Committee of the PCA responsible for finances, was
 in Moscow attending the 21st Party Congress of the
 CPSU.  It is known that he returned via Peiping where
 he was among Latin American CP representatives who
 received a briefing from officials urging the establish-
 ment of illegal apparats.  Reports received in early 1959
 reflected that the PGA was indeed making preparations
 for underground activity -- particularly after
 FRONDIZI's executive order given in April which forbade
 all Party activities, although it did not actually outlaw the
 PCA.  Subsequent to the restrictive order the PCA

 instituted measures to increase the security of Party
 communications;  began the dispersal of files, corre-
 spondence and compromising papers;  ordered the
 establishment of safehouses for clandestine meetings;
 and made arrangements for the shifting of Party head-
 quarters to a covert location in Cordoba.  That these
 preparations on the part of the PCA are not for naught
 is shown by recent reports that the FRONDIZI govern-
 ment intends to initiate court action which may result in
 the Party being declared illegal.
 Ecuador
 At some time prior to 1948 a member of the Spanish
 Communist Party who was passing through Ecuador
 briefed Ricardo PAREDES, then secretary-general of
 the Ecuadoran Communist Party (PCE), on the troika
 system utilized by the Spanish Communists and urged
 PAREDES to start immediately organizing such a system
 in Ecuador.  PAREDES did indeed take initial steps
 towards the establishment of an illegal apparat, but
 shortly thereafter, in 1948, PAREDES' power in the
 Party was broken and the PCE dropped the idea com-
 pletely.  PAREDES' replacement as secretary-general
 of the PCE was Pedro SAAD, who favored a relatively
 legal approach.  In January and February 1959 SAAR
 attended the 21st Congress of the CPSU, accompanied by
 Rafael ECHEVERRIA Flores, secretary-general of the
 Pichincha Provincial Committee of the PCE, who had
 just completed six months training in Communist China.
 It is believed that SAAD and ECHEVERRIA went to
 Peiping after the Congress and there received a briefing
 on illegal apparats from CPC officials.  Subsequent to
 their return, SAAD is said to have altered his position

 /Caveat:   Details of the establishment of an illegal
 apparat in India and Ajoy Ghosh's discussions with CPSU
 and CPC officials emanate from a source of question-
 able reliability, but are included in this analysis because
 of the high degree of agreement between this data and
 similar information from other sources, pertaining to
 other CP's.  The allegation that the Indian Communist
 Party is, indeed, in the process of establishing an illegal
 apparat has been confirmed by separate independent
 sources./
 In early February 1958, the First Secretary of the
 Soviet Embassy in New Delhi briefed two CPI officials,
 P. Sundarayya and Harkishan Singh Surjit, on the
 necessity of establishing an illegal apparat.  Some
 difference of opinion developed within the CP India
 leadership over this question, and the Party secretary-
 general Ajoy Ghosh continued to voice opposition, as he
 had at the 40th Anniversary celebration in November
 1957, on grounds that the Party reorganization required
 by such action would weaken the Party's efforts in the
 parliamentary struggle.  At its Congress in Amritsar
 in April 1958, the CPI continued to emphasize the parlia-
 mentary struggle for attaining power and incorporated
 this concept in its Amritsar thesis.  However, while the
 Congress was still in session, an important CPI official,
 P. Sundarayya, departed for Moscow to discuss the
 establishment of an illegal apparat.  In mid-May 1958

 Ajoy Ghosh also went to the Soviet Union to confer with
 officials of the CPSU.  Upon their return to India in June
 and July, respectively, both officials were in agreement
 on the necessity of establishing an illegal apparat and of
 increasing efforts to penetrate India's armed forces.  The
 coming to power of General de Gaulle in France, in spite
 of a highly organized CP with strong parliamentary
 support, was cited as an illustration of what might occur
 in India, and was used as a justification for the establish-
 ment by the CPI of an illegal apparat.  P. Sundarayya
 was reportedly given the responsibility of beginning
 building this apparat immediately in Andhra Pradesh.
 Ajoy Ghosh attended the 21st Congress of the CPSU
 and returned via Peiping.  While in Moscow and Peiping
 he participated in discussions with CPSU and CPC
 officials in which he was allegedly informed that the
 military coups in the Middle East and Asia seriously
 threaten the survival of the Communist parties in those
 areas.  To meet the threat, the CP's must develop
 apparats capable of armed resistance, or at least build
 the cadre of an underground party and must also intensify
 their efforts to penetrate military and police circles.
 The CPI decision to establish an illegal apparat was
 strengthened by the Kerala crisis.  As of September 1959,
 however, there was disagreement within Party leader-
 ship circles as to the form the apparat should take:  one
 group apparently felt that the apparat should for the time
 being be organized with planning and preparatory tasks
 at the national and provincial levels alone;  the other
 group favored a broader structure of a more militant
 character, to include the creation of units at the lowest
 levels of the Party.

 A noteworthy feature of the Indian case is the
 evidence that the CPI has been reluctant to weaken its
 overt organization and run the risk of compromising the
 parliamentary struggle by diverting assets to an illegal
 apparat, a problem which may also apply to other legal
 Communist parties heavily committed to overt activity
 in a parliamentary democratic context.  Also of signif-
 icance is the impact of de Gaulle's rise to power in
 France upon the CPI.  This development had a similar
 impact on other parties of the ICM, and may have made
 the task of the CPSU easier in convincing the various
 CP's of the necessity of establishing an illegal apparat.
 Violence which occurred in Nazareth on 1 May 1958
 drew rumblings from Government circles that the
 Israeli Communist Party (Maki) might be outlawed.  At
 the National Convention of Maki during the same month,
 two Maki politburo members referred to the necessity
 for preparing safeguards against the possibility that the
 Party might be declared illegal.  Immediately after the
 convention initial steps were taken involving the covert
 recruitment of selected activists to take part in certain
 long-range plans for illegal work involving a complete
 break with Maki on the part of the selected individuals.
 However, it has recently been reported that these
 preparations have been discontinued.

 discussed the suppression of CP's in various Free
 World countries and is known to have returned to Japan
 via Communist China, where discussions were held with
 CPC officials.  After the return of the delegation to
 Japan, reports from a source of undetermined reliability
 reflected that the JCP was seeking to establish an organ-
 ization known as the Kyuyu Kai, to be composed
 primarily of individuals not known to be Communists,
 which would enable the Party to continue its activities
 in the event it was declared illegal.
 A usually reliable source revealed that in June 1959
 Juan Pablo SAINZ y Aguilar, acting secretary-general
 of the PCM during the absence of secretary-general
 Dionisio ENCINA Rodriguez (who led the PCM's delega-
 tion to the 21st Congress of the CPSU), intended to
 recommend that the PCM be reorganized as three
 separate entities comprising a legal structure, a semi-
 legal apparatus composed of Party sympathizers, and
 an illegal apparatus consisting of persons who had never
 had any overt connection with the Communists.  However,
 SAINZ decided to shelve the plan pending the return of
 ENCINA and the rest of the PCM delegation:   Jesus
 Encarnacion VALDEZ Ochoa, secretary of organization,
 and Arnaldo MARTINEZ Verdugo, assistant secretary of
 organization.  ENCINA is known to have returned to
 Mexico in late July or early August 1959.  Since his
 return the proposal for the reorganization of the PCM
 has remained shelved, possibly because it was felt that
 the PCM should concentrate first on healing the split
 which was then plaguing the Party.

 the PCV was represented among the Latin American CP
 members who were briefed on the advisability of
 establishing illegal apparats by CPC officials after the

 are believed to be in the process of establishing illegal
 apparats distinct from the Party's political mechanism.
 The military coup in Pakistan on 7 October 1958
 resulted in the abolishment of all political parties and
 the arrest of many Communists.  Important and well-
 known CP leaders were instructed by the Party not to
 go into hiding or underground but to face arrest calmly
 and not attempt to escape imprisonment.  Lesser-

 agitators or activists, were told to go into immediate
 hiding so that they might be available for instructions
 through underground channels.
 As mentioned earlier in this paper, all new

 existing illegal structure is being improved and more
 stringent security practices are being initiated.
 Another feature of the recent trend toward clandestine

 The PGA in Buenos Aires is said to have initiated
 in August 1958 a training course in military tactics,
 firing positions, hand-to-hand combat and sabotage.  A
 usually reliable source, in an unconfirmed report,
 alleged that three "CPSU members" arrived in
 Argentina in September or October 1958 to conduct
 classes in "semi-military" tactics for Army veterans
 and PCA members.  In early 1959 the PCA reportedly
 maintained in Buenos Aires a force of "shock troops"
 which took part in the violent anti-Government demon-
 strations of 3 April 1959.  This force was said to be
 under the leadership of Felipe BESRODNIK (who visited
 Peiping after the 21st Congress of the CPSU).  In May
 1959 the PCA was allegedly training groups of young
 people in street-fighting and sabotage and had alerted
 the secretaries of the zone committees and made them
 responsible for organizing armed groups.  During the
 spring and summer of 1959 evidence accumulated

 force by the PCE.  The revolutionary group of the PCE,
 as personified by ECHEVERRIA and Jorge RIVADENEIRA
 A., began developing a plan of action.  The group was to
 conduct training courses in sabotage and paramilitary
 techniques. Each person trained was then to recruit and
 train five more who would in turn be responsible for five
 others. The system was to continue with each group of
 five knowing only the identity of its own leader. Pseu-
 donyms were to be used by all members.  A subsequent
 report from the same source revealed the existence in
 May 1959 of a group called the Comandos, headed by
 Jorge RIVADENEIRA A., numbering about seventy
 individuals.  The membership of this group was
 apparently drawn from the young Communists' organiza-
 tion of the PCE.  The Comandos were said to be organized
 into units of fifteen persons (these fifteen may have been
 further divided into squads of five, but there is no proof
 of that as yet).  It subsequently became apparent that the
 PCE Comando group was only in the planning stages.
 However, in August 1959, with the approval of Pedro
 SAAD, secretary-general of the Party, RIVADENEIRA
 issued orders to expedite the development of the original
 plans.  In September 1959, a separate, independent

 There is unconfirmed evidence that the CP India
 may be planning the establishment of a paramilitary
 force.  Information dated November 1958 from a non-
 Indian liaison service alleged that the CPI had opened a
 guerrilla training camp at Kakchin on the eastern border
 of Manipur adjacent to Burma.
 During September 1958, the PCV discussed plans
 for the organization of a secret guerrilla force, having
 as its primary mission the repelling of attempted coups
 against the BETANCOURT Government (the PCV fears
 the return of a military regime);  and as its secondary
 mission the support of the PCV in its struggle for power.
 Such a force was established with Douglas BRAVO, a
 member of the Federal. District (Caracas) Regional
 Committee of the PCV1 , at its head.  BRAVO was said to
 be responsible to a Cornite Revolucionario de Comandos
 (Revolutionary Committee of Commandos), a sub-
 committee of the PCV Central Committee.  Paramilitary
 training of members of the PCV guerrilla force was
 initiated in March 1959 at several secret locations and
