9 NOvember 197 
PRINCIPAL DEVELOPMENTS 
25X1 
Hanoi appears 
to be sending a fresh armor regiment and two field 
artillery regiments into northern South Vietnam. 
(Page 1) 
Pakistan is taking a number of diplomatic moves favor-
able to Asian Communist regimes. These steps may re-
flect President Bhutto's dissatisfaction with certain 
aspects of his relations with the US. (Page 3) 
The Argentine Government appears to be preparing for 
the return of former dictator Juan Peron. (Page 4) 
Uganda's deadline for the departure of non-citizen 
Asians passed yesterday without major incidents, and 
most of those required to leave havebeen evacuated. 
(Page 5) 
At Annex, we examine the confusing domestic political 
scene that has prevailed in China since the purge of 
Lin Piao one year ago.

VIETNAM 
Hanoi appears to be sending a fresh armor regi-
ment and two field artillery regiments into northern 
South Vietnam. Recent North Vietnamese messages, 
as well as aerial photography and US pilot sightings, 
have disclosed large numbers of tanks, tracked ve-
hicles, and convoys of artillery moving through the 
panhandle toward the Demilitarized Zone. One inter-
cept disclosed that 92 tanks had moved through the 
Vinh area, and other units farther south have re-
ported the passage of three groups of tanks that 
could be an armor regiment. A message of 5 November 
from the major enemy logistics authority in northern 
Quang Tri Province noted that "two ground artillery 
regiments..." equipped with tracked vehicles and 120 
trucks were to move along Route 9 in Quang Tri Prov-
ince.

CHINA 
It has been a year since the purge of Lin Piao. 
The ruling politburo has still not been reconstituted 
by replacement of those military members who went 
down with Lin. Leadership turnouts and authorita-
tive policy pronouncements have been rare. 
Despite the outward appearance of order 
in China, tensions clearly persist among 
the surviving leaders. This is evidently 
recognized by many low- and middle-level 
party members in China. 
Moreover, the protracted campaign through-
out the country to repudiate Lin Piao 
and the absence from view of an increas-
ing number of provincial military leaders 
suggest that military powerholders in the 
provinces are under pressure. This in-
volves real_ risks for domestic political 
order. 
At Annex we examine the confusing domes-
tic political scene in greater detail.'

PAKISTAN 
- The Bhutto government is taking a number of 
diplomatic moves favorable to Asian Communist re-
gimes. Yesterday, Islamabad began its formal with-
drawal from SEATO. On Tuesday, it recognized Hanoi, 
and it intends to recognize Pyongyang today. More-
over, Islamabad's next step may be early recogni-
tion of Sihanouk's "Royal Government of National 
Union." 
There appear to be several factors behind 
these moves. Bhutto wants to increase 
Pakistan's contacts with other Asian 
nations, he wishes to ingratiate himself 
further with Peking, and he needs to coun-
ter criticism by leftists at home that 
his policy is too pro-American. 
A growing dissatisfaction with US policy could 
also be involved.

ARGENTINA 
On Tuesday Hector Campora, Peron's personal 
representative in Argentina, announced that the 77-
year-old former dictator would return to his home-
land on 17 November. Within a few hours President 
Lanusse told the nation that the armed forces would 
guarantee Peron's personal safety and deal with any 
threats to domestic peace by either Peronists or 
their opponents. 
Peron has said before that he would re-
turn, and this announcement may be only 
another attempt to throw the opposition 
off balance and to pressure Lanusse into 
agreeing to his demands on Peronist par-
ticipation in political activity. It 
seems more likely, however, that this 
time Peron recognizes that he must return 
or face a serious loss of prestige. 
If Peron does return he may well stay for 
only a few days, long enough to endorse 
an electoral accord with the military. 
The short lead time on Campora's announce-
ment and the tenor of Lanusse's speech 
suggest that the Peronists and the gov-
ernment are close to an agreement on the 
conduct of the national elections next 
March and on the orientation of the gov-
ernment that will take office in May.

NOTE 
Uganda: President Amin's deadline for the de-
parture of non-citizen Asians passed yesterday with-
out major incidents, and most of those required to 
leave have been evacuated. Some 1,500 stateless 
Asians remain, however, along with a few thousand 
Asians with Ugandan citizenship and those exempted 
because of their much-needed technical skills. The 
UN has set up departure centers in Kampala for the 
remaining stateless Asians and will try to move them 
to facilities in Europe and elsewhere by the end of 
the week.

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
DOMESTIC POLITICS, CHINESE STYLE 
The events of last autumn drastically altered 
the political edifice in Peking, but the surviving 
leaders have, at least up to now, managed the crisis 
well. Basic social order has been maintained. The 
military has remained stable while being urged by 
the regime to be subordinate to civilian party con-
trol. The trend toward moderation in domestic poli-
cies--a trend evident since 1969, and one that has 
wide popular support--has been even more pronounced 
since Lin's departure from the scene. In the con-
duct of foreign affairs, Peking has scored a succes-
sion of triumphs in 1972, the fruition of its deci-
sion several years ago to adopt a more pragmatic and 
outgoing foreign policy. 
Nevertheless, the domestic political difficul-
ties faced by Peking are major ones, and the leader-
ship has thus far reacted with extreme caution. Pe-
king's problems are most evident within the polit-
buro itself; only 16 of the original 25'members 
named in 1969 are still being mentioned in the offi-
cial press by name, and of these only a dozen appear 
to be participating in the affairs of state in a 
meaningful way. The delay in reconstituting the 
politburo is doubtless associated with the question 
of the military's future representation on that body. 
While the regime wrestles with this problem, the 
armed forces are without a designated leader. Mar-
shal Yeh Chien-ying has been serving as de facto de-
fense minister but has not been formally appointed 
to the position. 
The Issues 
Because Lin was officially designated Mao's 
successor, Peking also faces a major task of working 
out anew formula for succession. For several years, 
Peking has delayed convening the National People's 
Congress, the state forum for legitimizing institu-
tional and personnel changes. Presumably this delay 
has stemmed from disputes within the leadership, and 
among these issues has been the wisdom and utility 
of many of the changes wrought by the Cultural Revo-
lution. The idea of a post-Mao "collective leader-
ship" has persistently surfaced in the past year; it 
is likely that it is the mix of this collective, 
rather than the principle itself, that is now at is-
sue. 
The regime's handling of the Lin affair has 
made it appear that the central issue in Peking is 
one of civilian versus military control. In fact, 
the issue is much more complex. Evidence--some of 
it antedating Lin's demise--indicates the institu-
tional problem is a real one. Nevertheless, the 
Al

FOR THE PRESIDENT ONLY 
leadership is deeply divided on a much wider range 
of policy and personnel questions. Moreover, devel-
opments during the Cultural Revolution clearly cre-
ated and intensified antipathies between leaders 
who were identified with its excesses and those of 
a more moderate persuasion. It is hard to believe 
these antipathies have now vanished, or that they 
no longer cut across institutions and interest 
groups, including the armed forces. 
Some Anomalies  
The actual facts surrounding the demise of Lin 
Piao?in September 1971 may never be known. Most of 
those at politburo level who were purged with Lin 
had long been associated with him and were clearly 
identified with the excesses of the Cultural Revo-
lution. In fact, however, the affair claimed high-
level military victims at both ends of the politi-
cal spectrum. Moreover, a campaign against ultra-
leftists--which began in late 1969, evidently under 
the direction of Chou En-lai--has been muted if not 
terminated altogether, even though it has not 
reached all of its potential victims. Chiang Ching, 
deputy head of the Cultural Revolution Group which 
directed Mao's purge of the old party apparatus, 
Seemingly should have been the next target, but as 
Mao's wife she apparently is immune. Two other 
prominent leftists, Shanghai party leaders Chang 
Chun-chiao and Yao Wen-yuan, also continue to ap-
pear frequently in Peking. 
In contrast to these inconsistencies in person-
nel matters, China appears at present to be travel-
ing on a single policy track. Rationality and prag-
matism seem to be the order of the day, not only in 
foreign policy but also in domestic areas dear to 
Mao's heart, such as education. There are no con-
vincing signs that this approach is being opposed 
or debated at the moment. 
One element that almost certainly is raising 
political temperatures is the protracted effort to 
repudiate Lin Piao. The notion that Lin, the de-
fense minister and Mao's designated successor, could 
turn against his mentor has sharply eroded confidence 
in the country's leadership, not only among party 
officials but among the populace at large. Since 
early this year, cadres have been studying a succes-
sion of documents purporting to spell out the details 
of Lin's coup plot. The key item in this series, the 
so-called "571 document," contains Lin's purported 
operations plan. The plan lists not only those 
forces that Lin allegedly could count on for support--
primarily the air force--but also a number of other 
military units he supposedly was attempting to en-
list in the plot. The implication is that there

still are elements within the armed forces whose 
loyalty is questionable. The most ominous sign in 
this connection is the latest available document in 
the anti-Lin series, issued in early July, which sug-
gests that the central authorities will not in the 
future need written evidence of complicity in the 
Lin "conspiracy" in order to move against given in-
dividuals. 
Problems in the Provinces  
Some members of the leadership may in fact be 
exploiting the Lin affair in order to move against 
military powerholders in the provinces. This im-
pression has been reinforced in recent weeks by the 
failure of an increasing number of these leaders to 
make public appearances  
A move against provincial military leaders, . 
even-on a selective basis, risks jeopardizing domes-
tic political order. The Cultural Revolution de-
stroyed the leadership of the old party and govern-
ment bureaucracies, leaving the military as the only 
effective instrument of control.. Some efforts have 
been made to re-establish the civilian party struc-
ture and reassert its traditional leading role in 
the Chinese polity. It is clear, however, that mil-
itary leaders still hold the balance of power in the 
party apparatus. outside of Peking. Thus a move 
against these military leaders, particularly if it 
is widespread, could cause a breakdown in control, 
with no alternative mechanism available to fill the 
void. 
The continuing denunciation of Lin and the ac-
companying "rectification" movement within the party 
and the army seem to have Mao's consent.  
Mao may see the campaign 
as an opportunity to settle personal scores with a 
number of provincial military leaders, primarily 
those whose opposition to the Red Guard movement led 
him to close out the Cultural Revolution before he 
felt he had accomplished all of his objectives. 
On the other hand, Mao must recognize that his 
close personal identification with Lin renders him 
vulnerable in certain important ways. The 571 docu-
ment contains some unusually harsh words about Mao's 
leadership. In effect, it accuses Mao of the ex-
cesses of the Cultural Revolution, characterizing 
him as aY'cruel tyrant." This attack.on the Chair-
man is. attributed to Lin, and it has been circulated

with Mao's explicit approval, but the effect has 
been to give wide publicity to a list of grievances 
against Mao with which most of the populace can 
readily identify. 
Mao and Chou  
During 1972, Mao and Chou have seemed to work 
very closely on most matters. Chou has constantly 
been at Mao's side during the Chairman's meetings 
with visiting state leaders, and in the course of 
the detailed negotiations with foreign powers, Chou 
has made it clear that he always defers to Mao on 
broad policy matters. Similarly, Mao has on several 
occasions publicly acknowledged his confidence in 
Chou. 
Provincial leaders_are not now faced, either 
collectively or individually, with the massive pub--
lic attacks and orchestrated violence that were so 
provocative in the 1967-68 period. In the absence 
of such a direct challenge--and Peking has gone to 
some lengths to indicate that such a challenge is 
not forthcoming--it is unlikely that they could or 
would unite to defy the authority of the Chairman - 
directly. This seems,particularly to be the case 
in the absence of a strong and authoritative leader 
for such a move'. 
It is difficult to cast Chou in such a role. 
His concern for the loyalty of the armed forces to 
the political system is surely as great as his con-
cern for the cohesion of the military establishment, 
and on both. grounds he is-likely to attempt\to 
"limit the damage" rather than place himself at the 
head of a, group determined to end the selective 
purge of the military by open defiance of Mao. To-
day Chou seems to have the endorsement of the Chair-
man for much of his domestic program as well as for 
his foreign policy, and this is an asset he will not 
castaway lightly. .Thus, a Mao,-Chou split seems. 
highly improbable now... 
Mao's motives in the present situation are 
equally complicated. Certainly vindictiveness and 
a desire to settle old scores play a major part in 
the current moves against the provincial military. 
But the explicit attempts. to reassure the military

that it is not about to suffer a thoroughgoing "rec-
tification," coupled with continued emphasis on rel-
atively conservative and pragmatic policies at home 
as well as abroad, seem to indicate that the Chair-
man's offensive is at this point a limited one. 
Like Chou, he seems intent for the moment to limit 
the damage. His objective could well be to estab-
lish abetter balance between competing leftist and 
conservative forces--and hence further increase his 
own freedom of maneuver--by whittling away at the 
predominantly conservative military leaders in the 
?provinces through a process of linking them, however 
tenuously, to the Lin "plot." 
To create this better balance, Mao may eventu-
ally do more than merely whittle away. Most recent 
appointments have involved relatively conservative 
persons who were under attack during the Cultural 
Revolution, but two others do not fall into this 
category. These latter appointments suggest at 
least the possibility of a leftward swing in the 
political pendulum. Whatever the case, it is clear 
that further changes are in prospect and that ten-
sions will persist for some time within the leader-
ship.
