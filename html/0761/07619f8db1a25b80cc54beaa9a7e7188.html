 EGYPT:   President Sadat has been urging the
 Arab oil producers to lift their embargo against the
 US once a Syrian-Israeli disengagement has been
 implemented.
 The Egyptian ambassador in Abu Dhabi told the
 US charge that Sadat recommended this course in his
 talks last weekend with United Arab Emirates Presi-
 dent Shaykh Zayid,
 Sadat publicly implied
 his feelings on a lifting of the embargo when he
 remarked in an Algiers press conference on January
 22 that every change in US policy toward the Arabs
 should bring a corresponding change in Arab policy.
 Sadat is working for an early easing of oil
 restrictions in response to US mediatory efforts
 in the disengagement negotiations.   He cannot press
 too hard, however; not only does he not control the
 oil weapon, but he must also avoid giving the im-
 pression that oil, having served Egypt's own ends
 thus far, need no longer be used to serve the in-
 terests of other Arabs.
 Sadat thus made it clear in his talk with
 Shaykh Zayid that his recommendation is that the
 embargo be lifted only after Syria has accomplished
 the same type of disengagement that Egypt has just
 concluded.   Sadat was also careful to leave the
 final decision to the oil producers themselves, and
 he has avoided direct comment on the issue in public.
 His Algiers statement was not explicitly tied to the
 oil embargo, and reference to any Arab quid pro quo
 was dropped completely from the Arab press and radio
 coverage of the press conference.

 Sadat gave Zayid no indication that his deferral
 to Damascus' sensibilities is being repaid by Syrian
 willingness to begin negotiations with Israel.
 Recounting his discussion with President Asad on
 January 19, Sadat expressed particular pleasure with
 Asad's reasonable attitude but indicated that a num-
 ber of other Syrian leaders are skeptical of Egyp-
 tian intentions and may be ready to sabotage any
 peace agreement.

 Despite Sadat's apparent rapport with Asad, his
 remarks about other Syrian leaders indicated that
 Damascus has still not reached a final decision on
 whether to negotiate with Israel.  Queried by Zayid
 on what would transpire if Syria decided against
 negotiations, Sadat remarked pointedly that this
 would be a decision for which Damascus would bear
 the consequences.

 JAPAN:   Although the country is facing serious
 balance-of-payments problems, government officials
 and businessmen appear to be coming around to the
 view that the domestic economy will not suffer as
 serious a setback from the energy crisis as previ-
 ously feared.   Industrial production is believed to
 have declined about 5 percent in December and is
 expected to register another 2.5-percent decline in
 January.  At its November peak, however, industrial
 production was 17 percent higher than a year earlier,
 and growth probably will resume in the second quar-
 ter of this year.
 Economic disruption from the oil shortage has
 been much milder than was anticipated at one time.
 A number of key semimanufactured items--for example,
 rolled steel, paper, plastics, and chemicals--are in
 short supply, but some of the shortages predate the
 energy crisis.
 Inflation remains Japan's most immediate prob-
 lem.   Because of supply problems at home and higher
 import prices, the wholesale price index in December
 was about 30 percent above the level of December
 1972 and consumer prices were up almost 20 percent.
 To slow the price spiral, Tokyo has moved-to tighten
 fiscal and monetary policies in recent weeks.  There
 is a strong possibility that these moves, in combina-
 tion with swelling oil import costs, will slow real
 economic growth even more than is required by the
 energy supply constraint.
 Substantial inflation will persist, whether or
 not the government continues to restrain demand.
 Partly because of higher oil costs, wholesale prices
 are expected to rise 15 percent this year and con-
 sumer prices almost as much.   The price spiral al-
 ready is posing a serious political problem for the
 Tanaka government, and Finance Minister Fukuda has
 expressed determination to slow it even at the cost
 of some economic growth. Earlier this week, Fukuda
 appealed publicly for support for government efforts
 to dampen inflation and counteract the impact of
 hi her oil costs on the balance of payments.

 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS:tDownward
 pressure on the yen eased in early trading today.
 During the first hour, the volume of trade amounted
 to $45 million, compared with $250 million yester-
 day when the Bank of Japan sold a total of    50 mil-
 lion to maintain the yen at 300 per dollar.,The
 Tokyo market had been closed since the announcement
 last weekend that the French franc would be floated,
 but trading was allowed to resume apparently because
 of the relative calm prevailing in European financial
 centers on Tuesday.
 CThe Japanese Ministry of Finance wants to avoid
 a series of competitive devaluations, but depreciation
 of the v en is likely if strong downward pressure
 resumes.   Some Japanese officials, including Vice
 Ministe   of Finance Inamura,  suggested earlier in
 the week that a rate of 320 yen to the dollar might
 be necessary to bring equilibrium to the market.
 Others have suggested a return to the Smithsonian
 rate of 308.
 The dollar strengthened somewhat on European
 exchanges yesterday.   The mark declined by 1 percent
 and the franc by almost as much despite French dollar
 sales of $130 million.   The Bank of France has now
 sold about $250 million to slow the decline of the
 franc since Paris decided to float its currency.   The
 Bank of Italy, which last week sold an estimated $350
 million to support the lira, has withheld support
 this week,  allowing the lira to decline with the
 franc.   For the second day in a row, gold declined
 slightly in price--to $134.50 an ounce.

 CAMBODIA - NORTH VIETNAM:   Sihanouk's current
 visit to Hanoi, which began on January 22, is his
 first trip outside China since September, when he
 attended the nonaligned conference in Algiers.  Al-
 though the visit has become an annual event that
 allows him to celebrate Tet with his hosts, the
 Prince undoubtedly will use the occasion to discuss
 the Khmer Communists' dry-season campaign.   It is
 unlikely, however, that the discussions will result
 in a major shift in the insurgents' hard-line strat-
 Sihanouk's two visits to Hanoi in 1973 coincided
 with key developments in the Cambodian situation.
 In late January the Prince tried unsuccessfully to
 persuade the Khmer Communist forces to respond posi-
 tively to Phnom Penh's call for a cease-fire--an
 approach he said was endorsed by both Peking and
 Hanoi.   In early April, Sihanouk returned to Hanoi
 following a one-month trip to Cambodia that was de-
 signed to dramatize his position as nominal head of
 the insurgency, as well as to put his troubled re-
 lations with Khmer Communist leaders in a more pos-
 itive light.

 EC - MIDDLE EAST:   Despite their disarray on
 community matters, the Nine are increasingly thinking
 about a future joint role in the Middle East.  Taking
 up a commitment made at last December's summit, the
 EC members are discussing proposals to set up a num-
 ber of EC-Arab committees on cooperation in industry,
 agriculture, energy, technology, education, and raw
 materials.
 The French have been lobbying heavily for some
 expression of Arab-European cooperation.  The other
 members are also generally in favor of a more sub-
 stantial, and joint, European presence in the area,
 but some--the Dutch for example--are concerned about
 conflicting with US efforts in the Middle East.
 In recent meetings, the community's Political
 Committee and a Middle East working group have ad-
 dressed the question of cooperation with the Arabs,
 along with peace guarantees and economic aid to Pal-
 estinians and "war-devastated areas."
 If enough progress were made on cooperative
 projects to justify a conference of EC-Arab foreign
 ministers--a possibility the EC is weighing for
 later this year--and if the Nine could formulate a
 meaningful aid program, Western Europe's effort to
 play a part in guaranteeing an eventual peace settle-
 ment would be strengthened.  The EC position would
 be represented by France and Britain, through their
 roles in the UN Security Council.
 A German official, however, has described the
 work of the Middle East experts as being still at an
 early stage and "rather academic."  The discussion
 of economic aid, he said, revealed the members' re-
 luctance to accept new obligations.
 The discussion on peace guarantees is essentially
 an effort to update a set of ideas worked out in 1971.
 The proposals remained "in the files" after news of
 their existence occasioned a public row among the EC
 members, who at that time were more divided than now
 in their attitude toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.

 CHILE:   The government this week issued a regu-
 lation Wining specific activities by the moderate
 and conservative political parties that it declared
 in "recess" after the junta took power.  The leftist
 parties were outlawed at that time, and their status
 has not been changed.
 The new regulation, carrying on the regime's
 effort to "depoliticize" the nation completely,
 defines the "recess" as a "situation of inactivity
 that affects all attempts to achieve the goals of a
 party, without actually ending its existence."  This
 restricts even the Christian Democrats who have coop-
 erated with the government.
 The parties have survived three months under the
 original "recess" decree, but if the long list of
 activities specifically prohibited by the new regula-
 tion is strictly enforced for an extended period of
 time, they will suffer severely.   The long-range
 effect of the regulation will depend on what strate-
 gies the parties can devise to circumvent it so as to
 ensure their survival, and on the length and strength
 of the junta's commitment to strict enforcement.
 The junta's broad disdain for politics and
 politicians apparently continues to outweigh entreat-
 ies by the Christian Democrats that only the Commu-
 nists and other leftists skilled"In the art of clan-
 destine activity stand to gain from a strict politi-
 cal moratorium.

 ARGENTINA:   President Peron's dramatic call for
 a nationmobilization to destroy terrorism has, at
 least temporarily, united a large part of the frac-
 tious Argentine community behind him and isolated
 his opponents.
 The audacious, bloody attack by Marxist People's
 Revolutionary Army guerrillas on a military garrison
 last weekend has resulted in shock and outrage, even
 in a society inured to growing violence.  The raid
 also was a tactical disaster, and the terrorists are
 publicly admitting it.  Although there are conflicting
 reports, as many as 20 terrorists may have been killed
 and hundreds of suspected extremists rounded up in
 large-scale police operations.
 Military leaders seem reassured by Peron's tough
 response.  Although their role in the counterterror-
 ist drive is still not clear, most officers see
 recent developments as a watershed that will mark the
 end of Peron's policy of restraint toward the extrem-
 ist groups.   The President's blast against unidenti=
 fied provincial authorities for being soft on
 leftists--a clear move to force the ouster of admini-
 strators who are out of step with his policies--was
 particularly welcomed by the military.
 The left-leaning governor of Buenos Aires Prov-
 ince, where the guerrilla incident occurred, resigned
 yesterday, and there are press reports that the prov-
 ince will be taken over by central government offi-
 cials.   Similarly, the governor and leftist labor
 leaders in Cordoba Province are under fire and will,
 at least for a while, be more cautious in their oppo-
 sition to policies of the federal government.
 The left-wing youth of the Peronist Movement,
 and even the Peronist guerrilla organization, have
 denounced the terrorists' actions, but they have
 also condemned as "repressive" the draft laws now
 before Congress which are aimed at tightening anti-
 terrorist legislation.  While they may continue
 demonstrating against the laws, their position has
 been weakened and the legislation will undoubtedly
 be promulgated soon.

 Although recent events clearly have presented
 Peron with a unique opportunity to strike a hard
 blow at the terrorists, there are dangers inherent
 in the situation.   Heavy-handed actions in political
 purges of his movement or in security operations may
 soon undercut the psychological advantage he now
 holds and drive the Peronist left wing into the
 extremist camp.  The military could also quickly
 become disenchanted if Peron does not follow up his
 pronouncements with further action.

 China: The Party Commands the Gun
 The new year has already seen two major develop-
 ments in internal Chinese politics--the unprecedented
 rotation of eight high-ranking military men, in ef-
 fect dislodging nearly all of them from well-
 entrenched provincial bases, and the reinstatement
 of the once-disgraced Teng Hsiao-ping to the Polit-
 buro and his appointment to the highly important
 Military Affairs Commission.   Taken together, these
 moves represent an evolution in the-domestic polit-
 ical scene at least as important as the reconstitu-
 tion of the Politburo at the Tenth Party Congress
 last August.
 As a result, prospects for convening the long-
 postponed National People's Congress now seem
 brighter, and it may also be possible to fill long-
 vacant central military posts.  Moreover, there has
 almost certainly been a reduction in the danger that
 certain disgruntled military leaders in the prov-
 inces might combine with ultraleftists in Peking in
 opposition to moderate policies that have been in
 effect at home and abroad for the past several years.
 Nevertheless, the recent moves do not signal the
 end to political problems within the leadership;
 indeed, they may run the risk of creating new ones.
 Military Commanders Shifted
 The rotation of military commanders speeds up
 what had been a gradual effort to ease military
 leaders out of top provincial party and government
 posts.   As early as the spring of 1971, Chou En-lai
 had expressed uneasiness over the pervasive role of
 the military in provincial affairs, and the question
 of the army's proper place in politics was unques-
 tionably a major element in the fall of Defense Min-
 ister Lin Piao the following autumn.
 In the aftermath of that imbroglio, a return
 to civilian party leadership in the provinces was
 never really in doubt; the only question was how

 rapidly it could take place.   A selective purge of
 military men in provincial leadership posts--
 comprising men who had somehow been linked to the
 Lin "conspiracy"--began at once and did not run its
 course until the summer of 1972.   The pace of re-
 ducing the power of provincial military leaders then
 slowed considerably, and few were replaced outright.
 .The party committees they headed, however, were en-
 larged by the addition of civilian party cadre.
 Plans for a further large reduction in the num-
 ber of soldiers in provincial party posts were prob-
 ably made in preparation for the Tenth Party Congress,
 but stiff opposition to these plans from at least
 one key regional commander threatened to complicate
 and perhaps scuttle the congress.   Chen Hsi-lien,
 then commander of Shenyang Military Region as well
 as first secretary of the party committee in Liaoning
 Province, sponsored a campaign in the Liaoning media
 to oppose the extensive use of university entrance
 examinations.   The politically astute Chen may have
 seized this issue as a ploy to divert the Peking
 leadership from its move to reduce the army's polit-
 ical role, or even to raise the specter of a poten-
 tial radical-military alliance.
 The resistance of the military, symbolized by
 Chen, may well have postponed a more drastic dilu-
 tion of the army's political role than that which
 occurred at the party congress.   The number of mil-
 itary men on the Central Committee was significantly
 reduced, but Chen and the others on the Politburo
 who were not implicated in Lin Piao's abortive mili-
 tary coup retained their positions.

 The Return of Teng Hsiao-ping
 The complete rehabilitation of Teng Hsiao-ping,
 who had been party secretary general before the
 Cultural Revolution, very likely was also discussed
 about the time of the congress.   The fact that he
 was not then named to the Politburo strongly suggests
 that considerable opposition to such a move had not
 been overcome by the summer.   This opposition may
 have existed among military figures who wished to
 retain a significant political role for the PLA as
 well as among some ultraleftists who had helped
 engineer his downfall in 1966.   Teng's appointment
 to the Military Affairs Commission also strongly sug-
 gests that he will play a significant role in the
 formulation of policy affecting the military--quite
 possibly in connection with a redefinition of the
 army's political role.   His posting strongly affirms
 the principle that the "party commands the gun."
 The final terms for the rotation of the regional
 commanders, as well as Teng's appointment, probably
 were negotiated at high-level meetings after the
 congress.   Unlike the provincial military figures
 who vanished after the Lin affair, the men involved
 were not purged but only changed jobs; the media are
 recording their appearances in their new bailiwicks
 and have in fact given most of them considerable pub-
 licity.   Nevertheless, the only titles they now hold
 pertain strictly to their military duties.   The re-
 gime will almost certainly find it easier to appoint
 civilian cadre to the leading party and government
 posts that have now become vacant in the several
 provinces affected by the rotation.   This would have
 been more difficult had Peking attempted to deprive
 these powerful men of their party and government
 titles while leaving them entrenched in their former
 strongholds.
 The Struggle Is Not Over
 They were permitted to save face, and this tes-
 tifies to the still-formidable strength of China's
 leading military figures as well as to the leader-
 ship's desire to avoid divisive solutions.   Indeed,

 the way the media are currently treating the mili-
 tary--giving it only limited praise while emphasizing
 the necessity for discipline and party control--
 suggests that Peking is wary of that strength and
 may anticipate further trouble from among the army's
 leaders.
 A clearer reading of the regime's attitude to-
 ward the army will be possible when the topmost posi-
 tions in the military establishment are filled.
 Marshal Yeh Chien-ying, a 75-year-old member of the
 Standing Committee of the Politburo, is a probable
 choice for defense minister.  A close associate of
 Chou En-lai, Yeh has in effect filled the post since
 Lin Piao vacated it.   While Teng Hsiao-ping may also
 be a candidate for that job, he could instead become
 chief of the General Political Department.   That post
 apparently was vacated by the transfer of Li Te-sheng,
 who had held the job for several years, to the
 Shenyang Military Region.
 There are several possible candidates for chief
 of staff.   The selection of a professionally oriented
 officer would be consistent with the effort to de-
 emphasize the military's involvement in politics.
 This would also be true if the new chief of staff
 had a public security or other quasi-military back-
 ground.   On the other hand, the appointment of a man
 from the ranks of the army's political commissars or
 a commander who has been heavily involved in politics
 since the Cultural Revolution would tend to accord a
 continuing political role to the military.
 The selection of the military figures who will
 occupy the top posts, as well as some general guide-
 lines on the military's  role in national affairs,
 may well have been part of a bargain reached by the
 party and military elements involved before the
 shifts of regional commanders took place.  Not all
 elements in this equation have necessarily been
 worked out, however  and some further horse-trading
 may lie ahead.
