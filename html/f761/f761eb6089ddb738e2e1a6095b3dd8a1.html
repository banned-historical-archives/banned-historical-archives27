 The North Korean shootdown of a US reconnaissance aircraft over
 international waters appears to have been a deliberate action designed to
 revive a high level of tension with the US. In light of its experience in the
 Pueblo affair, the Kim 11-song regime apparently saw a relatively low-risk
 opportunity to score another propaganda triumph that would offset the
 failure of its pressure campaign against South Korea. North Korea's imme-
 diate call for a Military Armistice Commission meeting probably was in-
 tended to forestall US retaliation and to provide a propaganda forum for
 further charges of US aggression.
 South Korean reaction to the incident has indicated an immediate
 concern over US resolve to deal firmly with North Korean attacks. In Japan,
 on the other hand, concern has been expressed that Japan might become
 embroiled in a Korean conflict.
 In South Vietnam, main force Communist units continue to refit in
 sanctuary and border base areas. The enemy has, however, sought to cover
 his general disengagement by launching a few heavy attacks against outlying
 targets. In Paris, meanwhile, the Vietnamese Communists are sending out
 mixed signals, probably in an effort to suggest some flexibility on their part
 without actually abandoning any of their maximum positions.
 After two weeks, the Chinese Communists have announced only that
 their ninth party congress has "unanimously" approved the new party
 constitution and the political report given by Mao's heir apparent, Lin Piao.
 Peking has announced that discussions leading up to the election of a new
 central committee did not begin until 15 April, suggesting that differences
 between the various, party factions still have not been settled.
 An increasing willingness on the part of local Cambodian officials to act
 on long-standing instructions to limit Communist activities along the border
 with Vietnam reflects Phnom Penh's growing preoccupation with the prob-
 lem of the Communist presence. The change in the Cambodian attitude is
 largely a result of heavier fighting along the border and increasing Commu-
 nist encroachments in the southern half of Cambodia over the past several
 years.

 VIETNAM
 Many main force Communist
 units throughout the country are
 now refitting in familiar sanc-
 tuaries and border bases.   Even
 so, the enemy has sought to cover
 his general disengagement by
 launching a few heavy attacks
 against outlying targets, partic-
 uarly in III and IV corps.
 MILES
 On the night of 10-11 April,
 enemy troops launched rocket and
 mortar attacks that caused heavy
 allied casualties and damage to
 military installations near Tay
 Ninh city and to delta civilians
 living in the capital city of Vinh
 Long Province.   More recently, the
 enemy again attempted to demon-
 strate his presence in the field
 by launching a human-wave attack
 on a US fire-support base south
 of Tay Ninh city; more than 200
 Communists were killed during the
 ensuing battle.
 Over the near term,  it seems
 like
 ly the Communists will con-
 tinu
 e sporadic she,llings against
 sele
 cted allied targets and per-
 haps
 occasional ground assaults
 such
 as the one on the fire-sup-
 port
 base.   The Communists are
 not
 now in a position, however,
 to launch heavy, coordinated ground
 attacks against major US installa-
 tions throughout the country.
 Political Developments in
 South Vietnam
 South Vietnamese politicians
 have been engaged in an intensive
 round of parleys since President
 Thieu announced on 7 April that
 he would head a new political
 organization in the coming politi-
 cal struggle with the Communists.
 Thieu, however, has yet to make
 clear precisely what he has in
 mind.

 In addition to the likely
 support of groups that have fa-
 vored the government in the past,
 such as Tran Quoc Buu's Vietnam-
 ese Confederation of Labor, the
 Catholic Greater Solidarity Force,
 and the Nhan Xa Party, Thieu seems
 to have acquired the support of
 the Revolutionary Dai Viets, who
 have generally been a key element
 in opposition to the government.
 Other possible supporters include
 factions of the Vietnamese National-
 ist Party  (VNQDD) as well as ele-
 ments of the Hoa Hao and Cao Dai
 sects.   Another group that has
 supported the government, Senator
 Tran Van Don's National Salvation
 Front, remains uncommitted, how-
 ever, and has withdrawn from the
 progovernment Lien Minh Front.
 A number of politicians,  in-
 cluding some close to President
 Page 3
 Thiet.,  are concerned that the new
 organization may develop into an
 authoritarian party similar to the
 Can Lao under President Diem. F_
 A group of members of the Lower
 House: who support the militant Bud-
 dhists, meanwhile, has accused the
 government of damaging national
 unity by its handling of the Thich
 Thier.L Minh case.   Some of these
 legislators have criticized alleged
 differences between Thieu's words
 and actions, pointedly accusing him
 of a lack of tolerance of dissent
 despite his pledge on 7 April to
 allow a real opposition to operate.
 The recent arrests of several al-
 legec' members of a Viet Cong cell,
 including the publisher of the Sai-
 gon Daily News and a militant Bud-
 dhist:, are bringing more of this
 type of criticism.
 President Thieu's initiative
 has apparently encouraged several
 opposition elements, particularly
 liberal, southern-oriented groups
 led by the Tan Dai Viets,  to be-
 gin closing ranks.   One Tan Dai
 Viet leader reportedly wants to
 broaden his party--through mergers
 with such groups as an element of
 the I!oa Hao sect and the followers
 of former chief of state Phan Khac
 Suu--into a coalition to act as a
 "loyal opposition."
 Such mergers could produce an
 opposition group of some substance,
 and the largely southern character

 government, but on several recent
 occasions they have dropped hints
 of willingness to bargain.

 LAOTIAN COMMUNISTS MAINTAIN OFFENSIVE PUSH
 The Communists have captured
 a government outpost astride the
 Mekong River in northwest Laos.
 A series of enemy ground
 assaults against government forces
 at Pak Beng on 14 April brought
 about the fall of the garrison
 and two outlying defense positions.
 This caps a seven-month enemy
 effort to clear government forces
 from the Nam Beng Valley.   The
 protracted siege may have been
 designed to draw off government
 guerrillas who have stepped up
 operations against Lao and Thai
 Communist elements along the
 Thai-Lao border.
 Communist forces have long
 been able to move in the area
 surrounding Pak Beng and to block
 traffic on the Mekong, but the
 opening up of the valley could
 facilitate the passage of troops
 and supplies into western Saya-
 boury Province.   The erosion of
 the government's presence in this
 area may also have an impact in
 Thailand, where a Communist tribal
 insurgency has made significant
 inroads in the border area.
 In the Plaine des Jarres to
 the south,  there has been no new
 major fighting but a government
 counteroffensive continues to make
 limited headway.   The Communists,
 probably thrown off balance by
 heavy air strikes, have so far
 limited their response to a se-
 ries of probing attacks against
 the neutralist headquarters
 at Muong Soui.

 CAMBODIA SEEKS TO LIMIT VIETNAMESE COMMUNIST ACTIVITY
 The Cambodian Government ap-
 pears to be carefully applying new
 pressure against Vietnamese Com-
 munist forces in Cambodia.
 Cambodian border elements
 have fought several skirmishes
 with Viet Cong and North Vietnam-
 ese troops in recent months.   Such
 incidents are not without prece-
 dent, but they are a clear sign
 of growing tension in the border
 areas.   Local officials,  includ-
 ing at least one provincial chief,
 have gone so far as to contact
 their South Vietnamese counterparts
 to discuss cooperation against
 the Viet Cong.
 The change in the Cambodian
 attitude is largely a result of
 heavier fighting along the bor-
 der and the extent to which Com-
 munist bases have proliferated
 in the southern half of Cambodia
 over the past several years.
 i  Problems
 have arisen because the Communists
 apparently have expanded bases
 into new areas and built new
 fortifications, thus upsetting
 understandings reached long ago
 with local Cambodian officials.
 The Cambodians also believe the
 Communists are supporting local
 rebels.
 The increasing willingness
 of local Cambodian forces to act
 on long-standing instructions to
 limit Communist activities re-
 flects Phnom Penh's growing pre-
 occupation with the problem of
 the Communist presence.   Cambodian
 news media have described Viet
 Cong violations of the border in
 greater detail than heretofore,
 and Liberation Front representa-
 tives have been maneuvered into
 admitting publicly that such in-
 cidents occur.   By applying new
 pressures against the Communists
 now, while at the same time moving
 toward a resumption of relations
 with the US, Cambodia's Prince
 Sihanouk is again trying to achieve
 by political means what he has
 been unable to gain by military
 measures alone.
 Cambodia also appears to be
 setting the stage for its eventual
 participation in a regional peace
 settlement.   Sihanouk has publicly
 demanded representation when the
 Paris talks discuss his country,
 and he will certainly consider
 evacuation of foreign troops his
 primary goal.
 For their part, the Com-
 munists are trying to maintain as
 cordial relations with the Cambo-
 dians as possible.   The recent
 Cambodian actions do not seriously
 threaten Communist bases in Cam-
 bodia, and the Communists will
 probably not react strongly
 unless the Cambodians become more
 aggressive .

 COMMUNIST CHINESE PARTY CONGRESS CONTINUES DEBATE
 After two weeks of silence,
 Peking broadcast on 14 April its
 first "interim" communique on
 developments at the party's ninth
 congress. This communique,  like
 the one announcing the opening
 of the congress, was bland and
 uninformative, in general more
 remarkable for its omissions than
 for its positive content.   No
 speeches delivered at the congress
 have yet been made public.
 In an obvious effort to
 counter speculation regarding
 the silence that has enveloped
 the meeting, the announcement
 on 14 April pointed out that the
 congress was meeting in plenary
 session only for the second time
 on that date;  delegates were re-
 ported to have been meeting in
 small groups in the intervening
 two weeks to discuss the new
 party constitution and Lin Piao's
 political report delivered on the
 opening day of the congress.
 Both the report and the consti-
 tution were reported to have been
 adopted "unanimously" at the sec-
 ond plenary session.
 Neither of these documents
 seem likely to have been the sub-
 ject of extended debate.   The
 new party constitution, which in
 its final form almost certainly
 closely resembles a "draft" that
 has been circulating in China
 since last autumn,  is a vague and
 loosely worded document setting
 forth a number of general proposi-
 tions regarding the role of the
 party--in effect a political pro-
 gram rather than a codification
 of the party's by-laws.   Some
 discussion of the actual practi-
 cal functioning of the various
 party organs was undoubtedly re-
 quired, given the highly general-
 ized nature of the new constitu-
 tion, but it is unlikely that the
 wording of the document itself led
 to sharp debate.
 Nor does it seem likely that
 the content of Lin Piao's politi-
 cal report was closely questioned.
 The speech was undoubtedly care-
 fully reviewed by Mao and other
 members of the leadership prior
 to delivery, and in this sense
 the speech itself was probably
 sacrosanct.   Debate was almost
 certainly limited to the question
 of how the  "tasks" set forth in
 the report were to be implemented.
 In this area, however, considerable
 differences of opinion may have
 arisen.   A muffled discussion on
 how far and how rapidly to press
 in implementing radical new pro-
 grams surfaced in the press and
 radio in the weeks prior to the
 opening of the congress.
 The item on the agenda al-
 most certainly causing the most
 trouble is the election of a new
 party central committee.  The jn-
 terim communique reported that
 discussions on this last major
 issue were not to begin until 15
 April.   This, however, was almost
 certainly a self-serving declara-
 tion designed to conceal deep
 cleavages on this important ques-
 tion.   Indeed,  it seems likely
 that the congress was due to con-
 clude its work last weekend,  and

 that adjournment of the meeting
 has been postponed because the
 conclave has become bogged down
 on this still unresolved issue.
 Provincial leaders have re-

 on the precise composition of
 this body.   Competing interest

 ance of the committee among mil-
 itary figures,  "rehabilitated"
 officials who had been criticized
 in the course of the Cultural
 Revolution and younger party
 members who had unreservedly
 supported it from the outset.
 A further area of contention
 may involve the balance of pro-
 vincial leaders to officials
 whose duties are focused on Pe-
 king.
 The interim communique re-
 ported that Mao Tse-tung,  in
 his opening speech on 1 April,
 expressed the "hope" that the
 congress would be one of "unity."
 Thus far,  it does not appear that
 he is getting his wish.

 NATIONALIST CHINESE HOLD TENTH PARTY CONGRESS
 President Chiang Kai-shek's
 moves at the Kuomintang's recent
 tenth party congress to revitalize
 his party's leadership appear de-
 signed both to strengthen the
 policy-making machinery and to
 prepare the way for his chosen
 successor.   Chiang's intent to in-
 ject fresh enthusiasm and motiva-
 tion into the party as a whole,
 however, met with little apparent
 success.
 At the congress,  the first
 since 1963, Chiang named six new
 members to the central standing
 committee--the party's senior
 policy-making body.     Most of the
 new appointees are young, econo-
 mist-oriented technocrats.   The
 virtual exclusion of such experts
 in the past contributed to a
 gradual decline in the standing
 committee's importance and rein-
 forced the government's emphasis
 on military priorities at the
 expense of economic investment
 and growth.
 Chiang's action may reflect
 a recognition that his son and
 chosen successor, Defense Minister
 Chiang Ching-kuo, will not be able
 to command the unchallenged au-
 thority that the Generalissimo en-
 joys.   President Chiang apparently
 believes that the presence of a
 group of energetic,  competent of-
 ficials will help balance the
 conservatism of old-line Kuomin-
 tang hierarchs and give the re-
 gime's economic development pro-
 grams the guidance and drive they
 must have to succeed.   Chiang
 also created a new "advisory"
 presidium that reportedly will
 provide a graceful exit from ac-
 tive party life for aged party
 stalwarts.
 Despite these moves to re-
 vitalize the top level of party
 leadership, the congress made no
 move to lessen the domination of
 the traditional mainland elements
 in the party.   Little was done to
 increase the limited role of the
 native Taiwanese, who constitute
 84 percent of the island's popu-
 lation but only 10 percent of the
 congress' delegates.
 The Nationalist congress was
 legally scheduled for late 1961
 and may have been delayed at least
 initially because of President
 Chiang's indecision over what to
 do with the vacant post of party
 deputy director general.  Many
 party officials had assumed that
 the post would go to Chiang Ching-
 kuo, but the Generalissimo instead
 announced that he was abolishing
 the position. Chiang probably
 wanted to avoid not only the
 "dynastic" implications of ap-
 pointing his son to the post,
 but also the potential risk of
 creating a challenger to an or-
 derly succession if someone
 else were named.   President
 Chiang, in any event, appears
 confident that his son already
 has sufficient control of the
 party apparatus to assure a
 -smooth transition.

 Eastern European attention was centered on Czechoslovakia this week
 as the party central committee grappled with the problem of responding to
 Soviet pressures for restoration of orthodoxy. The Dubcek leadership has
 not only been under attack for vacillation frorn greatly emboldened conserv-
 atives but also from youth and workers for bowing to Soviet desires. As the
 plenum opened, it looked as if most of the liberals would be ousted from the
 leadership.
 Top Polish and East German leaders conferred with Soviet Defense
 Minister Grechko in East Berlin, probably about the situation in Czechoslo-
 vakia and what the Soviets were doing about it. Grechko returned to Prague
 before going home; Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Semenov is still there
 overseeing developments. The Warsaw Pact exercise involving Czechoslovakia
 ended on schedule, 16 April, according to a TASS announcement.
 Hungarian party chief Kadar in effect withdrew his conditional support
 of the Dubcek leadership in a sharply critical public speech; later, he tried to
 soften the blow by ratifying a friendship pact he signed with the Czech-
 oslovak leader last June.

 CZECHOSLOVAK PLENUM ELECTS HUSAK AS PARTY CHIEF
 The Czechoslovak party cen-
 tral committee on 17 April elected
 Gustav Husak as first secretary
 of the Czechoslovak Communist
 Party--replacing Alexander Dub-
 cek.   Husak has been head of the
 Slovak party and is a "realist"
 who advocates closer cooperation
 with Moscow as the only possible
 course.
 the Czechoslovaks also succumbed
 to pressures to streamline the
 leadership to Soviet specifica-
 tions by reducing the size of the
 presidium from 23 to 11 members--
 in the process removing from
 power 11 of Dubcek's moderate
 and liberal supporters.
 Ithe
 central committee has abolished
 the executive committee of the
 presidium--the "inner politburo"--
 created last November.
 The new presidium is domi-
 nated by moderates who, like
 Husak, believe that the Czecho-
 slovaks must comply with Soviet
 directives in order to prevent
 the Soviets from cracking down
 more harshly and narrowing the
 already limited maneuverability
 that the Czechoslovaks have in
 pursuing their own domestic
 goals.   Dubcek was named to the
 new presidium, but the outspoken
 Josef Smrkovsky--the last remain-
 ing progressive in the leadership--
 was dropped.
 Key members of the central
 committee apparently gathered in
 informal caucus on the morning
 of 17 April to discuss the ques-
 tion of leadership prior to con-
 vening the crucial plenum in the
 Page 12
 afternoon.
 On the eve of the plenum,
 the Dubcek regime granted a clean
 bill of health to ten prominent
 pro-Soviet conservatives.   Most
 of these "rehabilitated" hard-
 liners had been branded as
 "traitors" and "collaborators"
 by the public in the aftermath
 of the invasion.   Before the
 plenum, the Dubcek leadership
 came under strong attack for
 its "vacillation" from Husak

 eign Minister Semenov apparently
 is staying in Prague to observe
 the proceedings and to maintain

 in the present s;t^.a-irn.   The
 police are hoping to intimidate
 the people and head off trouble
 by removing the "antisocialist
 elements"  they consider most
 likely to generate it.
 Earlier this week,  students
 in Prague staged peaceful strikes
 in an attempt to persuade Dubcek
 and his associates that they must
 not cave in to the Russians. Un-
 happily for the leadership, the
 student declarations were uncom-
 promisingly anti-Soviet in tone.
 The students' reaction to the cen-
 tral committee meeting is un-
 predictable.
 The trade unions had also
 reiterated their support for
 progressive policies and had
 criticized the restrictive meas-
 ures introduced earlier this
 month, but the union leaders
 have pledged cooperation with
 the party and will try to avoid
 stirring up anti-Soviet senti-
 ments.  Militant workers, how-
 ever, might join the students
 should the latter decide to
 demonstrate.
 SLOWDOWN IN COMMUNIST OIL EXPORTS TO FREE WORLD
 Soviet exports of petroleum
 to the free world are likely to
 decline about ten percent this
 year after failing to increase
 in 1968 for the first time since
 1955.   Domestic demand and the
 USSR's commitments to Eastern
 Europe are rising rapidly at the
 same time that the growth of So-
 viet oil production has slowed.
 Little expansion is likely in
 Soviet exports at least through
 the mid-1970s.
 Total Communist petroleum
 exports to the free world during
 1969-70 probably will not signifi-
 cantly exceed last year's level
 of 51 million tons even though
 exports from the Eastern European
 countries, especially Rumania,
 may increase.   The share of free
 world demand--excluding the US--
 that Communist countries will
 satisfy in these two years will
 drop below its recent level of
 five to six percent.
 Soviet deliveries, which ac-
 count for most Communist petroleum
 exports to the free world, amounted
 to 4:3 million tons in 1968, worth
 about $540 million.   Sales for
 hard currency, principally in
 Western Europe, increased slightly
 to $375 million, while exports to
 the  less-developed countries de-
 clined for the third straight
 year.
 Rumania accounted for about
 one half of the eight million tons
 of petroleum products exported
 from Eastern Europe last year.
 Although Rumania's sales in 1968
 were derived largely from domestic
 crude oil, probable increases over
 the next few years will be sus-
 tained primarily by crude oil im-
 ported from the free world.   The

 In exchange, the USSR pro-
 vided oil to the Western
 oil companies at Black Sea
 ports for delivery to their
 markets in Europe.   Ship-
 ments to Western Europe
 rose by 1.8 million tons,
 and Communist countries
 provided about the same
 share of total oil sup-
 ply to Western Europe--
 nine percent--as in 1967.
 The USSR may try to
 preserve its free world

 other Eastern European countries
 export petroleum products derived
 mainly from Soviet crude; it is
 unlikely that the USSR will permit
 these countries to expand their
 exports significantly,  as this
 would deprive the USSR of addi-
 tional hard currency.
 The increased cost of trans-
 port resulting from closure of
 the Suez Canal brought about a
 total decline of about 1.1 mil-
 lion tons in exports to Japan,
 India,  and Ceylon.   The drop in
 exports to Japan was about 800,000
 tons, reducing the Communist share
 of Japan's oil supply to about two
 percent from more than three per-
 cent in 1967.   This decline was
 lessened to some extent by the
 arrangement of swap deals with
 Western oil companies that pro-
 vided oil to the USSR at Persian
 Gulf sources for delivery to So-
 Such an arrangement was reached
 with Algeria last year.   The USSR
 may decide to deliver such petro-
 leum to other less-developed coun-
 tries to conserve its own oil for
 sales to hard-currency countries.
 The decline in Communist pe-
 troleum exports to the less-de-
 veloped countries is expected to
 continue during the next few years.
 A substantial decrease is antici-
 pated in exports to Greece, which
 recently concluded a long-term con-
 tract with Western oil companies
 for most of its oil requirements
 through 1980.   Although total So-
 viet petroleum exports to Egypt
 are expected to decline this year,
 shipments of products rather than
 crude may increase following ex-
 tensive damage to the Egyptian
 oil refinery complex at Suez.

 GENEVA DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE: FOCUSES ON SEABEDS.
 The Eighteen Nation,  Dis-
 armament Committee  (ENDC),  after
 four weeks of negotiations in
 Geneva,  seems ready to settle on
 the drafting of a treaty restrict-
 ing arms on seabeds as its most
 feasible project. The conferees
 want to retain the ENDC's effec-
 tiveness as a disarmament forum
 and to present a meaningful dis-
 armament proposal to the UN's 24th
 General Assembly when it convenes
 next fall.   The seabed issue ap-
 pears the most likely to gain US-
 USSR cooperation, which the other
 countries at Geneva recognize as
 the sine qua non of disarmament
 progress.
 At the outset of the ses-
 sion,  the matter deemed most im-
 portant by the nonaligned nations
 was a comprehensive test ban
 treaty, but various US and Soviet
 objections made it apparent that
 this would not be readily obtain-
 able.   A new US proposal for a
 cutoff  of production of fission-
 able material for weapons purposes
 was rebuffed by the USSR as un-
 workable.   Other issues that ap-
 pear to be nonstarters include a
 package deal of various disarm-
 ament measures, desired by the
 Italians;  nuclear-free zones,
 brought up by Mexico and the East
 Europeans;  and a Soviet-proposed
 agreement banning the use of nu-
 clear weapons "for attack."
 The Soviet draft treaty on
 seabeds, introduced on 18 March,
 proposes a ban--beyond the twelve-
 mile limit--on the use of the sea-
 beds for military purposes.   All
 installations on the seabed would
 be open to inspection by repre-
 sentatives of all signatory states
 on a reciprocal basis.   The draft's
 broad sweep has raised a number of
 reservations, but the Soviet rep-
 resentative has argued that com-
 plete demilitarization would fa-
 cilitate settlement of such thorny
 issues as verification.   He con-
 tended that if only nuclear weap-
 ons were prohibited, any country
 could reject verification requests
 on the grounds that only conven-
 tional facilities were involved.
 The US has suggested prohibiting
 only  "nuclear weapons and other
 weapons of mass destruction," and
 also that verification be handled
 by International Atomic Energy
 Agency inspectors.
 There have been indications
 that. the Soviets are not inflex-
 ible: on across-the-board demil-
 itarization, and in any case are
 willing to negotiate the issue.
 The proposed treaty's geo-
 graphic coverage--whether it
 is defined by the twelve-mile
 limit or by some other formula-
 tiort--will probably provoke con-
 troversy.   In exchange for their
 obligations under the NPT, how-
 ever,  the nonnuclear countries
 are impatient to exact further
 disarmament concessions from the
 super-powers, and this will serve
 as an incentive to agreement.

 MOSCOW PUTS LITTLE STEAM BEHIND "EUROPEAN SECURITY"
 Moscow is keeping alive its
 appeal for a European security
 conference but is taking no steps
 to bring the idea closer to re-
 ality.   In their propaganda,  the
 Soviets even seem to be adding
 further conditions to those set
 forth in the Budapest declara-
 tion of 17 March.
 A Soviet government state-
 ment on the eve of NATO's minis-
 terial meeting last week took a
 more polemical tone and inflex-
 ible approach than did the decla-
 ration that the Warsaw Pact states
 coordinated and signed.   Unlike
 the Budapest document, which
 called for a preparatory meet-
 ing "as soon as possible," the
 USSR stressed that "serious and
 effective work" on European se-
 curity "is possible only on the
 basis of recognizing the true
 situation on the continent."
 Moscow made clear that it
 has not scaled down its standard
 demands for recognition of post-
 war borders, "two Germanies,"
 the "separate entity" of West
 Berlin, and the prevention of
 West German access to nuclear
 weapons--familiar prerequisites
 that were in the Budapest appeal.
 The Soviets added, however, that
 Bonn must declare the Munich
 agreement of 1938 to have been
 invalid at its inception, and
 they also implied that Bonn must
 sign the Nonproliferation Treaty.
 Soviet diplomats waited to
 deliver the Budapest document to
 Western capitals until the week
 before the NATO meeting, but they
 apparently had no instructions
 to follow it up.   They were at
 pains to avoid specifics about
 the conference called for in
 the document and to leave vague
 the key question of the US role.
 Some Soviet officials, including
 Ambassador Dobrynin in Washing-
 ton, said that Moscow would not
 veto US participation, but they
 kept to the line that this was
 a matter for the "Europeans" to
 decide.
 Moscow's Warsaw Pact allies
 have also been active in push-
 ing the proposal in the West.
 They are just as vague as the
 Soviets, however, and are often
 contradictory in explaining key
 points.  Moreover, they are
 adding conditions to the Buda-
 pest appeal consonant with their
 national interests.
 Moscow sees merit in the
 security conference idea, which
 strikes a responsive chord among
 the detente-minded in Europe
 and fosters friction within the
 Alliance.  The Soviet press has
 blamed the "Bonn-Washington axis"
 for blocking progress on detente.
 Over all, however, none of the
 ambiguity has been removed and
 nothing new has been added in
 this most recent of Moscow's re-
 current European security cam-
 paigns.   Moscow intends to keep
 the subject nebulous, as was the
 case with the Bucharest declara-
 tion of 1966 and the Karlovy Vary
 appeal of 1967.

 NATO MARKS 20TH ANN]:VERSARY
 The discussion at last week's
 NATO ministerial sessions focused
 mainly on the recent Budapest
 "appeal" of the Warsaw Pact na-
 tions for a European security
 conference.   Enthusiasm for de-
 tente, which had seemed strong
 earlier, waned following Moscow's
 description of NATO on 9 April
 as the "main obstacle to the safe-
 guarding of international secu-
 rity."   As a result, the minis-
 ters decided not to refer to the
 Budapest appeal in their communi-
 que. They advocated exploring
 with the East "concrete issues
 which best lend themselves to
 fruitful negotiation and an early
 resolution."  US participation
 in any European political set-
 tlement was stressed.
 Looking forward to an era
 of negotiation--the communique
 explicitly endorsed US-USSR dis-
 cussions of strategic arms limi-
 tations--the ministers called
 for "strict adherence to the prin-
 ciple of full consultation...be-
 fore and during any negotiations
 that might affect the interests
 of the Alliance or any of its
 members."  The French refused to
 agree to policy guidelines on
 future East-West relations but
 accepted a statement that the
 members "would take into account"
 these guidelines in forming their
 national policies.
 Among the other topics con-
 sidered at the meeting was the
 proposal for discussion of com-
 mon social and environmental prob-
 lems.   The ministers instructed
 the permanent NATO representatives
 to examine means of improving
 exchanges of views on these sub-
 jects.   They also remanded to the
 permanent representatives the
 proposal that deputy foreign min-
 isters meet periodically to re-
 view major,  long-range Alliance
 problems.   The ministers of the
 nations in the integrated command
 deferred substantive questions on
 Alliance defense posture to the
 May meeting of the Defense Plan-
 ning Committee, but they reiter-
 ated the need for "sufficient,
 substantial, and effective" con-
 ventional forces.
 The quadripartite dinner on
 Berlin and German affairs--held
 on the eve of each NATO minis-
 terial meeting--produced some
 debate when West German Foreign
 Minister Brandt asked that the
 communique include a sentence
 rejecting the Soviet "thesis"
 on intervention rights under the
 enemy states articles of the UN
 Charter.   This Soviet contention
 is a factor in West Germany's
 reluctance to sign the Nonprolif-
 eration Treaty.   French Foreign
 Minister Debre",  citing Soviet
 reticence on the subject in re-
 cent months, doubted that the
 climate was  "seasonable" for re-
 introduction of Western views
 on the Soviet claim, a stand gen-
 erally endorsed by the US and
 UK.   Lacking support, Brandt
 dropped his request.

 Artillery duels along the Suez Canal between Egyptian and Israeli forces
 are now occurring nearly every day. Nasir's forces initiate most of these in an
 apparent attempt to demonstrate to the other Arabs that Egypt is still in the
 forefront of opposition to Israel and to bolster Nasir's position at home.
 King Husayn's speech at the Press Club in Washington has been de-
 nounced by all fedayeen organizations and has received a very cool reception
 by the Arab press and radio.
 The build-up of military forces along the disputed river boundary
 between Iran and Iraq continues, although both sides probably want to avoid
 open hostilities.
 The Iranian Government is playing the
 matter in low key publicly, but a minor incident on the river could provoke
 a dangerous flare-up.
 In India, a new constitutional amendment allowing the formation of
 autonomous regions within states almost assures the early creation of the
 Garo and Khasi-Jaintia substates in the hill areas of the eastern state of
 Assam. Home Minister Chavan has refused to regard the measure as a
 precedent for formation of additional autonomous regions-even for trou-
 bled Andhra Pradesh where intrastate regionalism has led to violent demands
 for separatism. He warned that such a trend would lead to the "disintegra-
 tion of this country."
 The Soviets are again searching for space recovery facilities in the
 Indian Ocean. The government of Mauritius is considering a Soviet request
 for aircraft parking rights, the temporary installation of communications
 equipment, and permission to sail through Mauritian territorial waters.
 The Central African Republic has announced the execution of Lt. Col.
 Alexandre Banza, minister of state for public health, for attempting a coup
 and the assassination of President Bokassa. Banza, principal architect of the
 military take-over that brought Bokassa to power in 1966, had been un-
 happy over a recent demotion in cabinet rank. Whether Banza actually
 attempted a coup or Bokassa deliberately rid himself of a potential chal-
 lenger is still unclear. Although a few presumably related arrests have been
 re orted there have been no major repercussions in Ban  i.

 NIGERIAN FORCES THREATEN BIAFRAN CAPITAL
 Federal forces are threat-
 ening the Biafran capital of Umu-
 ahia, whose fall would represent
 a major psychological victory for
 Lagos.   Meanwhile, Nigerian and
 Biafran delegations are attend-
 ing a meeting in Liberia of the
 Organization of African Unity
 (OAU)  Consultative Committee on
 Nigeria, but prospects for a
 negotiated settlement remain dim.
 Elements of the federal 1st
 Division have advanced to within,
 seven miles of Umuahia, and early
 this week Biafran civilians be-
 gan to evacuate the town.   It
 appears increasingly likely that
 the lst Division will capture the
 town before long.   As federal
 pressure on Umuahia increases,
 Ojukwu can be expected to move
 his headquarters to a more secure
 area.
 Secessionist forces have held
 their own on the other fronts, in-
 cluding the south where the fed-
 eral 3rd Division has been try-
 ing unsuccessfully to relieve a
 brigade trapped in Owerri since
 February.   Should the Biafrans
 decide to wage a prolonged defense
 of Umuahia, however, federal units
 may well be able to make some
 progress on the southern front.
 There are no indications that the
 static 2nd Division is about to
 move from Onitsha.
 The Nigerian military success
 in the Umuahia area has probably
 relieved some of the pressure on
 the federal leaders, who had failed
 to show any military progress since
 September.   New strains are devel-
 oping in Lagos, however, as the
 prolongation of the war has led
 to a considerable amount of fi-
 nancial corruption--high even by
 Nigerian standards--among senior
 members of the military.
 Thus far, federal leader
 Gowon appears untainted,  and it
 seems unlikely that there will
 be a move against him at pres-
 ent.                                                            A more serious threat
 probably comes from the guilty
 officers,  including all three
 division commanders, who may
 well fear that Gowon will take
 action against them.
 On the diplomatic front,
 neither Gowon nor Ojukwu opted
 to go to the OAU meeting this
 weekend, although both sent
 delegations.  African leaders,
 including Emperor Haile Selassie
 and President Tubman, have shown
 increasing concern over the Ni-
 gerian situation, but it seems
 unlikely that any dramatic peace
 moves will result.   Lagos, bol-
 stered by its recent military suc-
 cess, will almost certainly main-
 tain its insistence that Biafra re-
 nounce secession before serious
 peace negotiations begin.   Biafra,
 on the other hand,  seems unlikely
 to retreat from its demand for an
 unconditional cease-fire as a pre-
 requisite to substantive talks.

 STUDENT UNREST PERSISTS IN TURKEY
 Student strikes, which be-
 gan in Ankara over two weeks ago,
 have rapidly spread to other
 schools and universities through-
 out Turkey.   At their peak,  it
 is estimated that about 75 per-
 cent of the total higher educa-
 tion student body was involved.
 Unlike the student boycotts last
 spring, which concentrated pri-
 marily on justifiable student
 grievances, the current disturb-
 ances  have focused largely on
 political issues, especially in
 Ankara.
 The primary target of the
 leftist student leaders who have
 organized and coordinated the
 strikes appears to be the Demirel
 government, although there has
 also been some anti-American
 propaganda.   The student "Occupa-
 tion Committee" at Ankara Univer-
 sity openly admitted that it was
 doing everything possible to
 "erode the government's position."
 From all appearances, the polit-
 ical   left is clearly exploiting
 student discontent in an attempt
 to strengthen its own position
 in the forthcoming campaign lead-
 ing to national parliamentary
 elections in October.
 Although the student boycotts
 are widespread, the action has
 primarily centered in Ankara.
 Student agitation in Istanbul
 has been generally muted except
 for two clashes between student
 extremists on 14 April.   The stu-
 dent body at Istanbul University
 appeared to be reluctant to fol-
 low Ankara's lead, although it
 may be planning further political
 action.
 The important political par-
 ties condemned the new student
 strikes, but tried to get politi-
 cal mileage from them.   The major
 opposition Republican Peoples'
 Party  (RPP)  accused the ruling
 Justice Party of capitalizing
 on the student unrest to help
 destroy democracy.   In response,
 Prime Minister Demirel charged
 the RPP with provoking past dis-
 orders and pledged that freedofi
 of education would never be en-
 dangered by the brute force of
 a few.
 There are increasing signs
 that the current wave of stude*t
 strikes may soon end, at least
 until further action can be
 planned.   The six-day occupation
 of buildings of Middle East Tech-
 nical University--sponsored in
 part by the US--was brought
 to a speedy climax last Sunday
 when gendarmes and riot police
 ousted the students;  several were
 injured and about 100 arrested,
 The six-day boycott in Adana in
 southern Turkey ended quietly on
 15 April after a promise to corp-
 sider legitimate student demands.
 The current halt may be
 merely the lull before the storm
 as student extremists are reported
 to be increasingly emboldened in
 their denunciation of the govern-
 ment and their espousal of the
 socialist cause.   There are rumors
 that student demonstrations are
 being planned for 28 April on the
 anniversary of the student riots
 that preceded the military ouster
 of the Menderes regime in 1960.

 LARGE SOVIET NAVAL FORCE STILL IN MEDITERRANEAN
 The ships and submarines
 that sailed into the Mediter-
 ranean from the Atlantic a week
 ago rendezvoused with units of
 the Mediterranean squadron off
 the Tunisian coast and then
 split into several groups.
 The flagship of the Northern
 Fleet contingent--a Sverdlov-
 class cruiser--and several other
 Soviet ships are making a five-
 day official visit to Annaba
 (formerly Bone), Algeria.   This
 naval visit closely follows So-
 viet President Podgorny's visit
 to Algiers and may portend an ex-
 panded use of Algerian port fa-
 cilities by Soviet naval units.
 Most of the Soviet ships
 now in the Mediterranean--19 sub-
 marines, 18 surface warships, and
 16 support ships--are in the usual
 Soviet anchorages and Egyptian
 ports.   There has been no major
 naval activity thus far; some
 four of the submarines and sev-
 eral surface units probably will
 leave the Mediterranean in the
 next few days.  Most of the ships
 scheduled to leave the Black Sea
 during the past week failed to
 pass through the Bosporus.

 PAKISTANI GOVERNMENT ACTS TO WIN POPULAR SUPPORT
 The new government of Presi-
 dent Yahya Khan is continuing
 its efforts to win the support
 of those elements of Pakistani
 society that participated in the
 agitation against former presi-
 dent Ayub Khan.   Meetings have
 been held with industrial, labor,
 and student leaders, with em-
 phasis being placed on the need
 to revive the economy.
 Deputy Martial Law Admin-
 istrator Nur Khan, whose respon-
 sibilities apparently include
 labor, conducted a series of
 meetings with labor leaders in
 both East and West Pakistan in
 an attempt to formulate plans
 for settling grievances.   On 5
 April at Rawalpindi, he met with
 members of the Joint Labor Coun-
 cil--a group representing sev-
 eral labor unions from West
 Pakistan--and a labor repre-
 sentative from East Pakistan.
 In Dacca on 9 April, Nur
 Khan assured labor leaders in
 the east wing of the country that
 workers would receive the wage
 increases agreed to by employ-
 ers prior to the imposition of
 martial law, even if the in-
 creases had been won by force.
 He warned, however, that if the
 wage rates eventually established
 for various industries by gov-
 ernment committees were lower
 than the rates achieved through
 Page 26
 compulsion, the workers would be
 obliged to return overpayment's.
 Nur Khan also met with student
 leaders on 9 and 10 April in
 Dacca, where he received a copy
 of their long-standing proposals
 for reform.   The present govern-
 ment, however, is unlikely to
 be sympathetic to some of these
 proposals, such as autonomy for
 East Pakistan.
 On 12 April, another deputy
 martial law administrator, Ad-
 miral Ahsan, announced that the
 support price for wheat would be
 lowered and that the issue price
 of government wheat in both prov-
 inces would also be reduced.   He
 claimed the lower prices would
 not reduce farmers' income be-
 cause of higher production and
 would significantly benefit the
 population, which spends a high
 proportion of its income on food.
 He also reaffirmed President
 Yahya's earlier statement that
 foodgrain  requirements for East
 Pakistan would be met by ship-
 ments from the West.
 In an apparent move to create
 a more favorable popular image
 for his new government, Yahya Khan
 on 13 April dismissed Altaf Gauhar
 as secretary of the Ministry of
 Information.   Gauhar had been one
 of former president Ayub Khan's
 closest advisers and had become a
 symbol of the former government.
 In East Pakistan, meanwhile,
 authorities disciplined two in-
 dividuals for alleged excesses in
 enforcing law and order, perhaps
 in an effort to demonstrate that--
 despite stringent martial law regu-
 lations--the government's primary
 concern was the protection of the
 common man.

 With the Easter holidays over, activity began to pick up in Latin
 America this week.
 Separate terrorist incidents in the Dominican Republic in the last ten
 days have claimed the lives of at least four members of the security forces
 and left others seriously wounded. Communist terrorism is becoming such a
 problem that it will provoke military reprisals and further complicate politi-
 cal conditions.
 The secretary general of the Chilean Communist Party told a party
 meeting last week that the Communists cannot hope to win the 1970
 presidential election alone. His speech was directed primarily at the Social-
 ists, whose candidates the Communists have supported in recent elections
 and who in general espouse a more extremist line than do the Communists.
 He added that his party would support an alliance of "popular forces"
 including the Radical Party, now under the control of leftist leaders, and
 parts of President Frei's Christian Democratic Party.
 The 13th meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for
 Latin America began in Lima, Peru, on 14 April. Trade and development
 problems will be the general topics of discussion, but developed nations'
 policies toward Latin America will come under considerable fire. For the
 first time since Peru severed relations in 1959, an official Cuban delegation,
 led by central committee member and key economic adviser Carlos Rafael
 Rodriguez, is visiting the country. In a bitterly anti-US speech, he blamed
 the US for all the economic ills of Latin America. Also present are observers
 from the Soviet Union and some East European nations.

 PERU'S MILITARY GOVERNMENT FACES ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
 An exodus of competent per-
 sonnel from the Central Bank and
 an inflationary economic program
 could combine to cause Peru fur-
 ther serious economic problems.
 Most of the professionals on
 higher level staffs of the Cen-
 tral Bank have been dismissed or
 have resigned to protest charges
 related to the controversy over
 the International Petroleum Com-
 pany  (IPC); some have taken asylum
 in Latin American embassies in
 Lima. This not only lowers the
 competence of the bank, but also
 has shaken the confidence of in-
 ternational lenders.
 On 10 April, Finance Minis-
 ter Morales  Bermudez outlined
 his financial program, which will
 do nothing to stem inflationary
 pressures in Peru.   The US Embassy
 comments that the program demon-
 strates that Peru's financial af-
 fairs now are in the hands of of-
 ficials who not only do not under-
 stand the magnitude of the prob-
 lems facing them but also are
 blithely confident that the un-
 realistic schemes they are devel-
 oping are adequate to meet the
 situation.
 Morales Bermudez'  program
 includes a sizable deficit in
 the 1969 budget, which he stated
 would be financed without direct
 recourse to the Central Bank and
 without a resultant increase in
 inflationary pressure.   He also
 stated that the budget must be
 used to achieve development ob-
 jectives,  regardless of whether
 it is balanced.   He promised a
 loosening of credit without un-
 duly increasing liquidity,  and
 stated that financial austerity
 would not be necessary.   These
 plans are not likely to be in
 accord with standby loan require-
 ments set by the International.
 Monetary Fund.
 In addition,  foreign credits,
 which dried up in anticipation of
 imposition by the US of economic
 sanctions under the Hickenlooper
 Amendment, have not been forth-
 coming as the government had
 hoped.   There is no evidence that
 foreign lenders are eager to deal
 with Peru as long as the threat
 of sanctions remains.
 Negotiations between Peru
 and the US over compensation for
 expropriation of some facilities
 of IPC are expected to resume
 in about ten days when a Peruvian
 delegation arrives in Washington.
 The delegation will be led by,Gen-
 eral Fernandez Baca, who is had
 of the state-owned petroleum com-
 pany.   One of President Velasco's
 extreme leftist advisers reportedly
 is to be a member of the delega-
 tion.   Velasco continues to rep-
 resent the deferral of economic
 sanctions as a great victory for
 Peru.
 Poland's ambassador to Ven-
 ezuela, in commenting to the press
 on the establishment of diplo-
 matic relations between Peru and
 Poland,  said he saw "great possi-
 bilities" for profitable economic
 contacts between the two countries.
 Despite such pro forma statements,
 it is unlikely that any great in-
 crease in trade will occur soon.

 VENEZUELA'S PRESIDENT SPEEDS PACIFICATION CAMPAIGN
 The Caldera government is
 continuing its efforts to bring
 an end to insurgent activities
 in Venezuela.
 On 10 April, President Cal-
 dera announced that the govern-
 ment has accepted the offer of
 a distinguished group of Vene-
 zuelan citizens led by the Roman
 Catholic cardinal of Caracas to
 act as a mediator between the
 government and the rebels.   The
 committee will seek guarantees
 for the guerrillas in return for
 pledges that all guerrillas in
 the country will lay down their
 arms.   The decision to accept
 this offer was undoubtedly aimed
 at bringing about complete paci-
 fication of the country, a goal
 that the new government has given
 highest priority.
 The government for its part
 probably hopes that talks with
 guerrilla leaders will further
 widen the split among their
 followers between those favor-
 ing a cease-fire and those who
 want to continue armed action.
 The MIR is seriously di-
 vided over what course to fol-
 low.  A special plenum of the
 party has been called this week
 in eastern Venezuela to discuss
 the debilitating effects that the
 government's pacification program
 is having on the guerrillas.  MIR
 leaders fear that the government
 may try to split the party by sud-
 denly legalizing it while nego-
 tiations are going on.  Although
 some government officials are
 said to favor such a tactical
 move, the action would probably
 cause considerable unease among
 military and political figures
 who take a dim view of the gov-
 ernment's negotiations with the
 rebels.
 Although they were willing
 to go along with the government's
 decision to legalize the Commu-
 nist Party last month, they see
 a vast difference between re-
 storing constitutional guarantees
 to a party that has abandoned
 armed struggle, and one that con-
 tinues insurgent activities and
 has the gall to present impos-
 sible demands to the government
 before agreeing to a cease-fire.
 There is a possibility that Cal-
 dera,  in his eagerness to claim
 credit for pacifying the country
 for the first time since 1962,
 may take actions that could
 jeopardize his relations with
 the military.

 CUBA REACTS TO RISE IN CRIME
 The growing incidence of
 crime throughout the island has
 forced Cuban leaders to review
 the effectiveness of the nation's
 law enforcement apparatus.
 Crime--ranging from vandalism
 and draft-dodging to arson and
 murder--has been increasing be-
 cause of shortages of food and
 consumer goods, increased aus-
 terity, and frustration brought
 about by the heavy demands made
 on the population. Recent state-
 ments by regime spokesmen indi-
 cate a deep concern that may lead
 to stringent countermeasures.
 The serious nature of the
 problem was first made public
 last September when Fidel Castro
 complained of mounting juvenile
 delinquency and acknowledged that
 more than 70 major "counterrev-
 olutionary acts" had taken place
 in the preceding six months. His
 promise "that heads would roll"
 was followed shortly by the execu-
 tion of two men accused of set-
 ting a warehouse fire that re-
 sulted in alleged losses of 1.5
 million pesos.   This harsh ob-
 ject lesson apparently had only
 a temporary deterrent effect.
 To address the problem on
 a broad scale, the Vice Ministry
 of Internal Order of the Interior
 Ministry organized meetings in
 its units to discuss all types
 of crime including such minor
 offenses as traffic violations,
 worker absenteeism, and various
 kinds of "antisocial acts" in-
 volving "hippies."  The meetings,
 which began at the local level
 in January and had progressed up
 through the regional and provin-
 cial levels by mid-March, were
 attended by representatives of
 the mass organizations who con-
 tributed "constructive criticism."
 In late March, a National Forum
 on Internal Order was held in
 Havana with key regime officials
 presiding.
 Speeches delivered by Presi-
 dent Osvaldo Dorticos and In-
 terior Minister Sergio del Valle
 gave clues as to what measures
 were being considered.   New laws
 will broaden the application of
 capital punishment; technical re-
 sources for crime prevention and
 detection will be improved; or-
 ganizational changes will be made
 within the Vice Ministry of  In-
 ternal Order; and pressure will
 be exerted on religious groups
 whose teachings interfere with
 the Cuban revolutionary process.
 Also, stress will be placed on
 social work performed primarily
 by the mass organizations; com-
 missions will be set up to study
 the unification of the various
 law enforcement agencies; codifi-
 cation of laws will be studied
 in an effort to create uniformity
 of sanctions; and the Interior
 ministry will involve itself more
 in educating the public on the
 ministry's role in Cuban society.
 Despite the Castro regime's
 use of the term "counterrevolu-
 tionary" to describe any activity--
 political or criminal--that is

 at variance with its aims, there
 is no evidence to suggest that
 crime in Cuba today represents
 an organized effort to undermine
 stability and present a political
 challenge to the government.   No
 matter what measures the regime
 may adopt, crime will probably
 remain a problem as long as the
 current depressed economic condi-

 government provokes frustration       25X1

 JAMAICAN OPPOSITION SHOWS NEW VIGOR
 The opposition People's Na-
 tional Party  (PNP)                       is demonstrat-
 ing increased vigor under its
 new leader, Michael Manley.
 Early this month, the 44-year-
 old Manley, who succeeded his
 father as party chief in Febru-
 ary, announced the formation of
 a shadow cabinet "designed to
 reflect the aims and goals of a
 PNP government."  There are 16
 ministries in all, the three
 most important of which--Exter-
 nal Affairs, Defense, and Labor--
 are held by Manley himself.
 Manley has also allocated
 to his top party lieutenants new
 responsibilities for organizing
 popular support.   This move is
 in line with Manley's expressed
 interest in encouraging collec-
 tive leadership in contrast to
 the traditional one-man rule of
 Caribbean political leaders.
 There is evidence that pub-
 lic support may be shifting to
 the PNP.   In recent elections
 for local officials throughout
 the country, the PNP led the in-
 cumbent Jamaica Labor Party in
 popular votes for the first time
 since 1959.   In the last gen-
 eral elections, held in 1967,
 the vote was fairly evenly di-
 vided between the two parties.
 Although Prime Minister
 Shearer is not scheduled to
 face the voters again until
 1972, elections might be called
 earlier if divisions within his
 own party should result in de-
 fections from the government
 ranks.   The PNP is already capi-
 talizing on the government's in-
 ability to cope with serious
 crime.   Shearer, whose own home
 was fired at recently, has
 charged that subversive elements
 are responsible for the current
 wave of violence, but there is
 no evidence to substantiate this
 allegation.  According to the US
 Embassy, general reactions in
 the Kingston area range from jit-
 ters to fear.
