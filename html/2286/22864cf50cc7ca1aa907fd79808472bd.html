 MEMORANDUM FOR:   Director of Central Intelligence
 THROUGH           Vice Chairman, National Intelligence Council
 FROM                                   Special Assistant for Warning
 SUBJECT        .  The International Arena in 1986
 1.  There will be no significant changes this year in the pattern of
 East-West relations or regional power equations that have prevailed in the
 past half decade.  Sharp political competition centering on Gorbachev's
 bold "peace offensive" will dominate US-Soviet relations.  Soviet political
 strategy, aimed primarily at influencing the outcome of critical national
 elections in West Germany in January 1987 and in Britain the following year,
 will preclude provocative or high-risk initiatives that might trigger
 unwanted confrontations with the US.  The greatest potential for political
 surprise this year will reside in a possible decision by China to reopen the
 Taiwan question and in the regional fallout from a collapse of the Labor-
 Likud coalition government in Israel.
 2.  The most urgent problems facing the Administration will stem from
 essentially unforeseeable consequences of two major developments:  a fall
 in oil prices to $15 to $20 a barrel and the US deficit reduction process
 under Gramm-Rudman.  Prospective declines in the dollar's value, real interest
 rates in the US, and the US trade deficit will reduce, if not remove, the
 principal sources of economic growth during the last two years in Western
 Europe, Japan, and the developing countries.  If these governments do not
 adopt more expansionary policies, Europe and Japan will experience various
 degrees of economic stagnation, and Third World countries will encounter
 even more intractable problems in servicing foreign debts.
 International Economic Outlook
 3.  1986 will be a volatile year.  The world financial structure will
 experience severe strains that will exceed those induced by the recession
 and Mexico's financial crisis in 1982.   The crunch will appear in the last
 two quarters, with a 50 percent chance of debt crises involving two or more
 countries.  Leading debtors such as Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Nigeria
 will avoid formal defaults but there will be a strong possibility of unilateral
 reductions in interest payments, following precedents set by Peru and Nigeria
 in limiting payments to no more than 10 percent and 30 percent of export
 earnings.   Most debtor countries will become more assertive in demanding
 concessions in rescheduling arrangements, and they will echo the declaration
 of Latin American econonicministers in December that growth must-have higher
 priority that repayment of debts.  These demands will be accompanied byI
 growing agitation for a restructuring of world debt and reconstruction of the
 international financial system.

 4.  Mexico, and perhaps Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina, will confront a
 choice either to maintain austerity measures in order to meet scheduled interest
 payments, thereby risking domestic political stability, or'to declare major
 reductions or moratoriums on payments.  Time is running out, and the fall in
 oil prices will hasten the day of decision.  A substantial increase in bank
 and official loans to major debtors would avert another payments crisis for
 a year or two, but a policy of increasing the debt burden and curtailing
 darestic investment and imports will not be politically acceptable in the
 longer term.  In the next year or so, more Third World debtors will emulate
 Nigeria's example in rejecting III' austerity agreements, gambling that this
 can be done without incurring major eeonanic or political penalties because
 banks will have no choice but to reduce interest rates and stretch out re-
 payments.
 5.  The decline in oil prices will have cumulative effects on the debt
 problem.  The drop in price in the last three months already has exceeded
 the projections of most industry economists, and it has inspired the Saudi
 strategy to force price reductions to the point that Britain, Norway and
 other non-OPEC producers will be cbliged to negotiate a general producers'
 agreement on production levels and prices.  Although conventional wisdan
 in the industry appears to anticipate such an agreement because of the magni-
 tude of the stakes in an unrestrained price war, OPEC will fall well short
 of its goal of recapturing a "fair market share" for all 13 members.  More-
 over, Saudi Arabia's calculated risk in attempting to enforce its role as
 the crucial "swing producer" will fail in the next 12 to 18 months.
 Soviet Political Strategy
 6.  The Gorbachev leadership this year will mount the most vigorous and
 resourceful peace offensive since World War II.   The principal vehicle will
 be Gorbachev's grandiose program of 15 January for a three-stage process
 culminating in the elimination of all nuclear and chemical weapons by the
 year 2000.   Other initiatives in the caning year may include an easing or
 ending of Andrei Sakharov's internal exile and a schedule for partial with-
 drawal of Soviet forces fran Afghanistan.  The peace offensive will be aimed
 primarily at encouraging political forces that Moscow hopes will increasingly
 alienate Western Europe from the US and determine the outcome of the Bundestag
 elections in January 1987 and British elections the follgwing year.  Soviet
 arms control initiatives, particularly on INF, will be calculated to exploit
 the polarization among and within the major West German political parties
 created by the debate over INF deployment in 1980-83.  The Soviets perceive
 historic opportunities to capitalize on the collapse of the 30-year West
 German consensus on foreign and security policies.  Soviet initiatives will
 be tailored to encourage the Social DemocraW to adopt positions designed
 to capture what Chairman Willy Brandt calls the elusive "majority to the left
 of the CDU."
 7.  West Germany, Britain and the Netherlands will be the main targets
 of frequent manipulation of Gorbachev's ambiguous references to a separate,
 interim agreement on intermediate-range missiles in Europe.  Gorbachev will

 use his visit to Italy this spring to announce ostensibly attractive new
 proposals for an INF accord.  His immediate aim will be to strengthen the
 prospects of the anti-INF Labor Party in the May elections in the Netherlands.
 A Labor victory would be a significant breakthrough for the Soviet scenario
 in 1986 because a new Labor government would repudiate both the present
 government'sINF deployment decision and the basing agreement for cruise
 missiles.
 8.  West Germany, however, will be Moscow's prime target.  Gorbachev's
 suggestion that the second US-Soviet summit meeting be deferred until autumn
 reflects a calculation that the impact on West German opinion of the
 arms control and political pronouncements he plans to make in the US will be
 magnified the closer the visit comes to the January elections in the Federal
 Republic. The Soviets are convinced that the erosion of West German public
 confidence in NATO's traditional security and arms control policies has made
 the Bonn government vulnerable.  Chancellor Kohl has attempted to contain
 the damage by repeatedly emphasizing his carmitment to arms control and by
 promoting the notion of an interim accord on INF.   Gorbachev attempted to
 turn this tactic against Kohl by surfacing his own proposal for a separate,
 interim INF agreement during his visit to Paris last October.   The thrust
 of Gorbachev's message throughout 1986 was illustrated by his speech at a
 dinner for Italian Communist leaders on 28 January:  "If we managed to
 eliminate the Soviet and American medium-range missiles on our continent
 without delaying or burdening the matter with other problems, we would unravel
 what is perhaps one of the complicated tangles in present-day world politics
 and would significantly clear the way toward a radical reduction of nuclear
 weapons and then their complete elimination."
 9.  The Soviets of course will be operating on the assumption that
 neither Bonn nor Washington, having invested so much political capital in the
 protracted contest over INF deployment, will seriously consider "eliminating"
 the INF missiles.  In sum, manipulation of the notion of a separate INF accord
 will be the cutting edge of Gorbachev's peace offensive, with the ultimate
 aims of undermining the Kohl government's political authority and electoral
 prospects, forcing the Administration to reject what will be portrayed as a
 genuine opportunity, in Gorbachev's words, to "free the European Continent
 of nuclear weapons," and enhancing the chances of a Social Democratic victory
 next January.
 Soviet Policy Toward the United States
 10.  Soviet political strategy will focus on repeated attempts to corner
 the Administration into rejecting seemingly constructive arms control proposals.
 The central purpose of Gorbachev's three-stage nuclear disarmament plan was
 to lay the foundation for this strategy.  Moscow's principal tactic will be
 to draw the Administration into assigning top priority this year to an interim
 accord on INF.  In private contacts and public statements, the Soviets will
 actively prorate the idea that INF reductions could go forward without an
 agreement on strategic and space weapons.

 11.  The Soviets are convinced that the US, West Germany and Britain
 will be unwilling to consider a canplete removal of the Pershing II's and
 GL ls.  They have taken the precaution, however, of guarding against a
 Western surprise by inserting in Gorbachev's plan a number of conditions
 judged to be totally unacceptable:  (a) the US must pledge not to transfer
 its strategic and medium-range missiles to other countries under any circum-
 stances;                        (b)  Britain and France must agree not to build up their own
 nuclear forces;  (c) the US must follow the Soviet Union's example and end
 all nuclear explosions and then join in calling on other states to halt
 testing;  (d) other nuclear powers must freeze their nuclear weapons, end
 testing, and "begin to join in nuclear disarmament."  Finally, the Soviets
 plan to counter an expected Administration demand that they reduce sharply
 the number of SS-20s in Asia by making an agreement contingent on a corres-
 ponding cut in American mid-range weapons in East Asia and the Western
 Pacific.  Soviet spokesmen already have contended that the mission of SS-20s
 in Asia is to counter US nuclear capabilities in the region and implied that
 US carrier-based aircraft and aircraft based at Misawa on Hokkaido Island
 .must be included in any trade-off.
 12.  There will be no retreat this year fran the three cardinal points
 of Soviet arms control policy:  (a) strategic weapons must be defined as
 including all systems capable of "reaching each other's territory," and
 any definitive long-teen accord on INF must be an integral part of an agree-
 ment on strategic weapons;   (b) an agreement on strategic weapons is possible
 only if the US joins the USSR in renouncing the development, testing, and
 deployment of "space strike arms";   (c) from the outset-of any arms reduction
 process, the US must end all nuclear testing.  The Gorbachev leadership has
 no illusions about the negotiability of this package.  Proposals are deliber-
 ately framed to elicit US criticism and rejection, which can then be used
 to "doclmient" charges that the Administration is irrevocably co rdtted to
 achieving strategic superiority and a first strike capability.  As Gorbachev
 put it in his 4 February interview with L'Humani.te, "These proposals are a
 kind of 'rt ent of truth.'  They make our partners in the talks show their
 real worth and reveal the aims their policy is really pursuing."   He charged
 that the US is "determined to continue the arms race cane what may."
 13.  In sum, the Soviets will not modify either their political strategy
 or the fundamental assessment of the Administration's intentions which they
 first articulated in the spring of 1981.  As recently as 25 January, Izvestia's
 senior observer, Aleksandr Bovin, restated the judgment he has regularly
 voiced over the past five years:  "Frankly speaking, I think... that while the
 current Administration is in the White House in the United States, I can hardly
 see us agreeing on some major issues with the Americans.  The factions of the
 American bourgeoisie now in power in the US and whose interests are repre-
 sented by Reagan will hardly agree to reducing or slowing the arms race because
 .of their material interests."  These public assessments of Administration
 intentions, of course, are simply a device to enhance the credibility of
 Soviet policy and purposes in the contest for world opinion, particularly in
 Western Europe. Soviet diplanacy and propaganda will hammer relentlessly on
 the alleged contrast between the Soviet Union's peaceful aspirations and what
 Gorbachev describes as the "militarization" of the US economy and "even of
 political thinking."  Gorbachev fully shares Andropov's basic calculation that
 -III           Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/08: CIA-RDP88T00988R000100080012-1

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/08: CIA-RDP88T00988R000100080012-1
 the Administration's foreign and defense policies can be successfully mis-
 represented and exploited in a climate of growing "contradictions" between
 American and European political and economic interests.  This calculation
 underlies Gorbachev's constant invocation of the "tremendous significance"
 of the world public's desire for peace and an end to the arms race, as well
 as his sermons about the "special responsibility" of the two superpowers
 and his appeals for a "decisive break" with "stone age ways of thinking"
 and for policies that "rise above national egoism."
 14.  The geopolitical ambitions that shape Soviet arms control policy
 and political warfare tactics will lead Gorbachev to focus on SDI, nuclear
 testing, and INF in his second meeting with President Reagan.  He will
 elaborate on his offers of on-site inspection and volunteer a willingness
 to consider "untying" his three-stage arms reduction program so that separate
 accords on such items as INF and chemical weapons might be negotiated.  This
 approach will be calculated to demonstrate the Soviet Union's readiness to
 produce "specific and concrete results" at the second summit and to prepare
 the ground for subsequent complaints that "the US side so far has not proved
 to be ready for major decisions." (Gorbachev's summit report to the Supreme
 Soviet on 27 November 1985)  In sum, the Soviet leader's prime concern during
 his visit to the US will not be to explore areas of possible accommodation
 but rather to build a case that will impress West European opinion with
 the need to disengage from American leadership and pursue independent policies
 toward the USSR.
 15.  In the months before Gorbachev's visit to the US, the Soviets will
 make a concerted effort to project an impression of significant progress
 toward a normalization of relations with China.  They will attach great
 importance to strengthening their position in the strategic triangle as a
 crucial element in influencing foreign perceptions of the global "correlation
 of forces."  The Soviets are anxious to have Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian visit
 Moscow before the second US-Soviet summit, and they-have announced that Wu
 has agreed to make this visit in may or June, with Foreign Minister Shevardnadze
 reciprocating with a trip to Beijing late this year.  If Wu's talks in
 Moscow yield satisfactory results, the Soviets probably will try to arrange
 a summit meeting between Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping or General Secretary
 Hu Yacbang, or one between Presidents Granyko and Li Xiannian, before
 Gorbachev's trip to the United States.
 16.  Although the Soviet peace offensive in early 1986 assigns a key
 tactical role to proceeding with a second US-Soviet summit, this scenario
 could be changed by foreign or domestic developments in the next six months.
 If Gorbachev's nuclear disarmament plan and other political initiatives have
 not produced the intended effects by mid-simmer--in particular, favorable
 prospects for an SPD electoral victory next January--the general secretary
 will cane under strong pressure from elements in the party and military hierarchies
 to back away from another summit and from the invitation to President Reagan
 to visit Moscow in 1987.  Considerable skepticism exists within Soviet elites
 about the efficacy of summitry as an instrument for advancing Soviet geopolitical
 objectives.  Gorbachev tacitly acknowledged this skepticism in his post-Geneva

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/08: CIA-RDP88T00988R000100080012-1
 summit speeches in which he struck a defensive tone in explaining the
 decision to open a dialogue with the head of an Administration which, in
 the general secretary's words, "openly took a course toward confrontation,
 rejecting the very possibility of a positive development of Soviet US relations."
 This rhetoric and the obvious ambivalence of his claim that "we are right in
 saying that the overall balance of Geneva is a positive one," suggest that
 Gorbachev is leaving the door open for an abrupt shift in course.  This
 calculated ambiguity also was evident in his remark to Senator Kennedy on
 6 February that a second summit "would have no sense" unless it could "yield
 practical results, produce serious shifts in the directions that are of
 greatest importance for the cause of peace."  The general secretary implied
 that Soviet agreement to a specific date would depend on progress toward an
 agreement to remove all inte n ediate-range missiles from Europe.
 17.  As of early February, the Soviets still intend to go forward with
 a second summit, provided they can secure the Administration's agreement
 to defer it until late November or December---timing calculated to maximize
 the meeting's impact on the West German elections.  However, if the Soviets
 conclude next summer that a Social Democratic victory is beyond reach and
 that the Administration's approach to the second summit is likely to fore-
 close Soviet political gains, the odds will rise sharply that Gorbachev will
 postpone his visit to the US indefinitely, contending that the Administration's
 defense and arms control policies had ruled out all possibility of achieving
 "practical results."
 Sino-American Relations
 18.  There is at least a 50 percent chance that Beijing will reopen the
 Taiwan question in the next 12 months by demanding that the US establish a
 specific date for ending arms sales to Taiwan, endorse China's "one country,
 two systems" formula as the basis for reunification negotiations, and undertake
 a direct role as mediator to overcome Taipei's refusal to negotiate "peaceful
 reunification."  Chinese leaders have been preparing the ground for this
 initiative since late 1984.  General Secretary Hu Yacbang's decision last
 month to postpone his expected visit to the US this year may have been
 motivated by a desire to avoid an impression of cordial bilateral relations
 that would undermine the credibility of renewed demands for resolving the
 Taiwan problem.
 19.  Although the "reformist" group led by Deng Xiaoping, Hu Yacbang,
 and Premier Zhao Ziyang strengthoOdits political authority last September by
 a major shake-up in the Politburo, Secretariat, and Central CccmLittee, there
 has been  evidence of considerable agreement within the party elite over the
 scope and pace of Deng's domestic reforms.  The key imponderable in assessing
 China's intentions is the possibility that strategy on the Taiwan issue will
 become entangled in struggles over domestic policy and power.  If this should
 occur, Deng and his principal lieutenants may find it expedient to abandon
 their ambiguous and temporizing stance on Taiwan and shift to pressure tactics

 threatening that if the US does not agree to end arms sales and deliver
 Taiwan to negotiations, Beijing will be free to jettison its policy of
 peaceful settlement.
 20.  If US-Soviet relations take an abrupt downturn as a result-'-of an
 impasse at the second summit or an indefinite postponement of Gorbachev's
 visit to the US, the odds favoring renewed Chinese demands would increase
 substantially.  China's moves to improve the atmospherics of relations with
 Moscow during the past year were intended to enhance Beijing's negotiating
 leverage with Washington.  In view of the Chinese leaders' sanguine view of
 their position in the strategic triangle, they would perceive a sharp
 deterioration in US-Soviet relations as creating favorable opportunities
 to force a test of nerves with the Administration over Taiwan.   In this
 contingency, there would be a considerable chance of Chinese miscalculations
 because they would reason that renewed confrontation with the USSR would
 enhance the Administration's incentive to avoid a simultaneous downturn in
 Sino-US relations.
 The Koreas
 21.  Political dynamics in South Korea this year will increase the chances
 of violent confrontations between President Chun Doc Hwan's government and
 the opposition New Korea Democratic Party.  The government's strong reaction
 to the launching of the NKDP's nation-wide petition drive demanding direct
 presidential elections in 1988 and other constitutional revisions underscores
 its determination to repress any challenge to Chun's authority.  There is a
 60 percent chance that NKDP activists and university students will mount
 street demonstrations this spring in an attempt to provoke the government
 into imposing draconian emergency measures.
 22.  The North Koreans are anticipating political violence in the South.
 They will announce new initiatives such as a proposal for a North-South summit
 meeting in an effort to encourage Chun's domestic opponents and inhibit his
 freedom to justify a crackdown by invoking the usual "threat from the North."
 President Kim I1-song's New Year's address voiced support for the "just
 struggle" in the South against "oppression and persecution."  The North
 Koreans will intensify their campaign to expand trade and exchanges of visits
 and agitate their proposal for a single Korean team to carpete in the Asian
 Games in Seoul this year and in the Summer Olympics in 1988, also in Seoul.
 Kim Il-song believes that Chun Doc Hwan will attempt to perpetuate his power
 by amending the constitution that limits him to one term or by employing
 extra-legal means to designate his successor in 1988.  Kim therefore anticipates
 a period of growing volatility in South Korean politics in the next two years
 that will open unprecedented opportunities for North Korean political
 exploitation and subversion.

 The Philippines
 23.  Post election passions and hostilities will subside after a few
 weeks of protest deronstrations and rhetoric.  Government security forces
 will be able to control the protests without resorting to the kind of
 draconian repression that might trigger an unmanageable breakdcwm in public
 order.  However, the repercussions of the ill-advised snap election and
 Marcos' declining health and vigor will gradually erode his political authority.
 The Communist Party and New People's Army will attempt to exploit post election
 confusion and recriminations by mounting urban violence and subversion, but
 the security forces will be able to contain this threat.  There will be
 another upsurge of political protests and violence if the ruling party engages
 in conspicuous attempts to rig the local elections next may.
 24.  The evolution of events since the assassination of Benigno Aquino
 in August 1983 has set the Philippines on an irreversible course of transition
 to a new political order in the post Marcos era.  Marcos will retain the
 support of the bulk of the armed forces through the remainder of his incumbency,
 and he will be able to maintain a tolerable degree of internal order and
 national administration in the next year or two.  In the longer term, there
 will be at'least an even chance that establishment leaders in the ruling
 party, the political opposition, the business community, the church, and the
 military will gradually work out understandings that will ease the country
 through a difficult transition period.
 Arab-Israeli Relations
 25.  In contrast to the relative stagnation and temporizing that characterized
 1985, the next 12 months will witness an acceleration of political dynamics
 and change in both the Arab states and Israel.  Events will be dominated by
 repercussions from three major developments:   (a)  King Hussein's moves to
 arrange an accommodation with Syria in the aftermath of the failure of his
 scenario for bringing the PLO into negotiations with Israel and the US, and
 the indefinite postponement of US arms sales to Jordan; ( b) En intensifica-
 tion of the struggle for control over an increasingly polarized PIA;   (c) political
 initiatives by Prime Minister Peres to split the Likud bloc and break up the
 coalition government before Yitzhak Shamir takes over the premiership as
 scheduled on 1 October.
 26.  The political contest in Israel will aggravate rivalries among the
 Arab states and Palestinian factions that will harden reactions to Israeli
 moves.  In May or June, Peres will announce plans to unilaterally impose
 autonomy in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by late December.  Labor Party
 leaders will portray this plan as an interim arrangement pending negotiations
 for a comprehensive peace agreement with Jordan.  The autonomy plan will not
 apply to the strategic Jordan valley, greater Jerusalem, or Jewish settlements
 in the West Bank and Gaza.  With these exceptions, Palestinians would be granted
 control over the administration of municipal affairs, agriculture, education,
 justice, finance and taxation, and other services.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/08: CIA-RDP88T00988R000100080012-1
 27.  The political purpose of the autonomy plan, which Likud strenuously
 opposes, will be to split the Likud bloc and its dominant Herut Party and
 force Likud to withdraw from the coalition government.  The Labor Party will
 then form a new government with several small religious parties.  This
 scenario, however, will carry a high potential for igniting a political
 upheaval.  Likud leaders will attempt to preempt Labor's ploy by creating a
 cabinet crisis and taking Likud into the opposition on a platform of no
 concessions of any kind to Jordan or the Palestinians.  There will be a good
 chance that Shamir will be replaced by Ariel Sharon as Likud leader, with
 the result that Likud's policy will became even more intransigent on negotia-
 tions with Jordan.  One effect of a deliberate breakup of the Labor-Likud
 coalition will be to strengthen the appeal of ultranationalist right-wing
 parties at the expense of both Labor and Likud.
 28.  A cabinet crisis in Israel will trigger sharper competition among
 rival Palestinian factions and result in an upsurge in terrorist actions
 against the Israeli presence in the Occupied Territories and Israel proper,
 as well as more frequent attacks on American targets in the middle East and
 Western Europe.  Arab governments, including Egypt, will portray the autonomy
 plan as an irreversible step toward formal annexation of the West Bank and
 Gaza.   Political disarray in Israel will be exploited by the Syrians to
 intensify Shiite and Palestinian pressure on the Israeli military presence
 in southern Lebanon.  President Assad, however, will continue to avoid major
 provocations such as a limited attack on the Golan Heights that would
 unleash strong Israeli reprisals against Syrian clients and military facilities
 in Lebanon or against Syria itself.
 29.  Assad will became more aggressive in seeking to oust Arafat and
 bring a reunified PIA under Syrian control.   Having succeeded in blunting
 the Jordanian-PLO initiative on negotiations with Israel and obliged King
 Hussein to pursue an accommodation with Syria, Assad will press harder to
 secure predominant influence over Arab policy, at the expense of Jordan,
 Egypt, and Saudi Arabia.    This change in power relations within the Arab
 world will pose particular dangers to King Hussein's position.  The general
 aggravation of Arab-Israeli tensions, a significant escalation of unrest
 and terrorism in the West Bank, and the return to Jordan of thousands of
 Palestinians discharged from Gulf oil fields because of the fall in oil
 prices and output will create a potentially explosive situation in Jordan
 in the next 12 to 18 months.
 Iran-Iraq
 30.  The war will intensify this year as both Tehran and Baghdad gamble
 that even minor successes will demoralize enemy forces and civilian popula-
 tions and trigger internal upheavals.  Both regimes are exaggerating the
 adversary's vulnerability to domestic revolts or coup attempts.  In Iran
 there will be a growing likelihood of showdowns between competing factions,
 especially if a deterioration of Khameini's fragile health removes his
 moderating influence.  His mediation was crucial in averting violent clashes
 between radicals and conservatives last year.  A major military setback could
 ignite  a test of strength instigated by private militias organized by
 radical Revolutionary Guard leaders.

 31.  Even an intensified domestic struggle will not impair the Iranians'
 confidence in their capacity to outlast Saddam Hussein in a protracted war
 of attrition.  Evidence of growing military and civilian frustration over
 Saddam's inability to end the war will encourage Iran to mount further
 limited offensives, such as the capture of Al Faw.  There will be a 40 percent
 chance of an attempt by senior Iraqi military officers to oust Saddam before
 the end of the year.  These odds will increase if Iraqi forces fail to
 dislodge the Iranians fran their bridgehead at Al Faw.   Iran's tenacity
 and performance seen to have led the Soviets to judge that the war is
 gradually turning against Iraq--a revised assessment reflected in the
 decision to send Deputy- Foreign Minister Korniyenko to Tehran and to
 adopt a more conciliatory attitude.   Although the Iranians will persist
 in  pressuring the Gulf states to halt financial and logistic support to
 Iraq, they will not carry out their threats to close Hormuz or make a
 sustained effort to interrupt international shipping in the Gulf.
 Central America
 32.  Events in the first half of the year will focus on congressional
 consideration of the Administration's request for substantial military and
 humanitarian assistance to the contras.  The Sandinistas and Cubans will
 take a variety of initiatives calculated to strengths congressional and
 public opposition to the request.  Managua, for example, will indicate
 readiness to resume negotiations under Contadora auspices after the six-month
 suspension ends in May, and Castro will reaffirm his willingness to withdraw
 Cuban military advisers from Nicaragua if the US accepts Sandinista terms
 for an agreement.  The Sandinistas will also offer cosmetic concessions to
 two small opposition parties, make other gestures toward "pluralism," and
 relax some emergency decree restrictions.  But they will not agree to begin
 talks with the United Nicaraguan Opposition under any circumstances, and they
 will count on tacit Latin American support for rejecting Administration
 requirements on this issue.  The Sandinistas, moreover, will continue to
 insist that a formal US agreement to halt all assistance to the contras and
 other forms of "interference" is an essential precondition for a regional
 peace accord.
 33.  If Congress approves the Administration's request to resume military
 assistance to the FDN, the Sandinistas, backed by Cuba and the USSR, will
 attempt to turn Latin American opinion against the US by raising noisy
 allegations that this represents only the first phase of a plan for direct
 military intervention in Nicaragua.  If the request if rejected, the Sandinistas
 will interpret this as the beginning of the end of the-FDN's challenge.  By
 mid-year they will intensify military and subversive pressures to force
 Honduras to deny sanctuary to the contras.
 34.  Regardless of the outcome of the debate in Washington over Central
 America   policy, the Sandinistas will continue to play a waiting game.  The
 recent request by eight Latin American foreign ministers that the Administration

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/08: CIA-RDP88T00988R000100080012-1
 halt aid to the contras and renew the dialogue with Managua will reinforce
 Sandinista confidence that time and prevailing political trends in Latin
 America will work:to their advantage in the next year or two.  The Sandinistas
 will rely on political warfare maneuvers rather than negotiations, and they
 will remain deeply skeptical that the Contadora process will yield an
 acceptable agreement.  The next 12 months will not bring the Nicaraguans to
 modify their basic assumption, namely, that their Central American neighbors
 will be ready to come to terms 'through bilateral negotiations only after
 the FDN is reduced to a manageable nuisance along the thinly populated
 northern border.
 35.  The Soviets and Cubans will continue to urge the Sandinistas to
 avoid  blatant provocations that would play into the Administration's hands.
 The Gorbachev leadership will regularly voice support for Nicaragua's
 independence and sovereignty and the Soviets and Cubans will provide
 sufficient petroleum, industrial machinery, and consumer goods to avert a
 collapse of the economy.  Neither Moscow nor Havana, however, will deliver
 advanced weapons such as MIG-21s or MIG-23s, or SA-2/SA-3 surface to air
 missiles this year.  Bloc military assistance will continue to be confined
 to helicopters, infantry weapons, and support materiel such as trucks,
 jeeps, spare parts and other non-lethal equipment.  The Soviets and Cubans
 will go on training Nicaraguan air-defense forces, and they may provide
 self-propelled anti-aircraft guns this year, but they will not cross the
 crucial threshold of introducing jet fighters or SAMs.
 36.  In El Salvador the uneasy truce between Duarte's Christian
 Democrats and senior military leaders will be tested more severely this
 year than ever before in the last three years.  Support in the officer corps
 for Duarte has declined in the past six months, and there will be growing
 tensions and recriminations over economic policy and management, military
 assignments, and cabinet changes.  If Duarte aggressively pursues his US-
 supported economic stabilization program, his political standing will be
 progressively impaired among most sectors of the population, and this will
 deepen the high command's dissatisfaction with his leadership.
 37.  In sum, the political climate will be ripe for a potentially
 destabilizing test of strength toward the end of the year.  A major misstep
 by Duarte could precipitate his overthrow with no advance warning.  The
 decline in the FMLN insurgents' military capabilities will limit the threat
 to terrorist spectaculars in San Salvador and other urban centers, including
 assasssiriation attempts against Salvadoran political and military figures
 and US personnel.  One of the most volatile issues this year will be Duarte's
 reaction to probes by non-Communist members of the FMLN of prospects for
 reentering the political mainstream.  Social Democratic groups led by
 Guillermo Ungo and Ruben Zamora will be more active in exploring a possible
 political acoonirodation.  If Duarte and his political lieutenants appear to
 be responding favorably, the chances of a violent reaction by hard-liners in
 the military will increase sharply.

 38.  Panama's chronic economic problems will grow more unmanageable,
 increasing the likelihood of a political upheaval this year.  Having ousted
 President Barletta last Septenber, Defense Chief Noriega is now stuck with
 an already discredited Delvalle government.  Noriega may remove Delvalle in
 the next six months and assume the presidency himself, or become-head of a
 military-civilian ' junta. There will be some chance that Noriega will attempt
 to reinforce his authority and silence critics in the Defense Forces by
 blaming the US for the country's problem, particularly the Administration's
 policy of withholding economic assistance until Panama establishes a coherent
 economic program.
 South America                                                        -
 39.  Aside from the debt problems of the major South American countries,
 Chile will present the greatest potential for a political breakpoint this year.
 The main imponderable will be the capacity of more than a dozen non-Communist
 opposition parties and labor leaders to organize a credible threat of a
 national strike this summer as a means to force General Pinochet to negotiate
 a transition to civilian rule based on principles contained in the national
 accord signed by eleven parties last August.  The opposition's principal aim
 will be to deepen cleavages among the service catmanders who form the ruling
 junta.  Air Force Gen. Matthei's advocacy last last year of a dialogue with
 the opposition prompted a'threat from Piroehet to dismiss him and the national
 police chief if they persisted in opposing his political policies.  The Army
 representative on the junta was forced into early retirement last November
 and the Navy eatmander is thought to oppose Pinochet's plan to stay in power
 after 1989, when Chileans are scheduled to vote on a single presidential
 candidate to be nominated by the junta.
 40.  If the opposition succeeds in staging protests leading to a general
 strike, there will be an even chance that Pinochet's intransigence will
 precipitate an open split in the junta and armed forces.  The political atmosphere
 will became much more volatile: after the summer vacation period ends in March.
 Pinochet is confident that the divided opposition can be intimidated without
 risking a major breakdown in public order.  His disdain for "pseudopoliticians"
 and his successful repression of strikes and leftist violence in 1983 and
 1984 will lead him to underestimate the strength of public demands this
 year for a return to civilian rule.  Gen. Matthei and other junta members
 believe Pinochet "catmitted large mistakes" last year by refusing to negotiate.
 The next 12 months will witness events that may provide a definitive judgment
 on these conflicting assessments of the stakes in Chile.
 Southern Africa
 41.  In South Africa the caning year will be marked by escalating black
 attacks on white businesses and residential eonrTu ities.  The capacity of
 government security forces to maintain order in black townships and, at the
 same time, protect white areas will be stretched thin.  The government will
 be obliged to deploy regular military personnel in substantial numbers.

 The aggressiveness of militant black youths who are not associated with or
 controlled by  the major black organizations will become the principal
 threat to white security and authority.  This threat will far exceed that
 of the ANC's military arm, wh ich will not be able to mount any significant
 expansion of guerrilla activities from bases in neighboring Front Line states.
 The ANC, however, will succeed in staging sporadic attacks on key economic
 facilities such as the petroleum refinery-in Transvaal.  The ANC this year
 will concentrate on building long-term assets for waging a "people's war,"
 particularly the organization and expansion of small military cells.
 42.  The federation of 34 black labor unions formed late last year
 will become much more politicized.  Its president has warned, for example,
 that if the government does not abolish laws that require blacks to carry
 passes, "we will take all the passes of the black people and burn them."
 The federation and other major black organizations will combine to sponsor
 demonstrations including boycotts of black schools and white businesses.
 The boycotts may be called in the next three months if the government rejects
 demands  for the unconditional release of Nelson Mandela and other ANC
 leaders and the lifting of the state of emergency imposed last July.
 43.  There is a 40 percent chance that escalating violence against the
 white minority will produce a severe crisis of confidence in President Botha's
 leadership before the end of the year.   The accelerated drift toward open
 race war will strengthen the influence of hawks and maximalists in the
 National Party and government.  If a genuine crisis of confidence emerges,
 there will be a 30 percent chance that Botha will repudiate his strategy of
 limited and ambiguous reforms, call a snap election, and resign from office
 before year's end.
 44.  In Angola, the prospect of US military assistance to UNITA will not
 cause the dos Santos government to establish a timetable for the withdrawal
 of Cuban troops.  The Angolans will react by suspending further negotiations
 on Namibia and by shifting to a more hostile stance linking the US with
 South Africa's regional interests.  Castro will increase Cuban support to
 Angola, as well as to the ANC and SWAPO, and seek to place himself at the
 head of a movement for greater unity among the Frontline States in confronting
 the US and South Africa.  The Soviets will expand military and economic
 assistance to Angola and reinforce their advisory presence in the country.
