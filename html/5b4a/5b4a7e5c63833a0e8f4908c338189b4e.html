 Key Judgments Despite cuts in defense spending and reductions in the size of the People's
 /reformation available Liberation Army (PLA), China since 1979 has steadily strengthened its
 as of I December 1982 defenses opposite the Soviet Union. The Chinese have acted in response to
 was used in this report.
 a continuing Soviet military buildup along the Sino-Soviet border and in
 Mongolia, which has become a worrisome security concern for China. This
 may be one of the reasons for Beijing's willingness to resume talks with
 Moscow.
 The Chinese effort has added new units and has resulted in a 30-percent
 increase in major weapons in the border regions, with the northeast
 receiving the most attention. The improvements of defenses are reminiscent
 of the larger Chinese augmentation that occurred following the Sino-Soviet
 border conflict in 1969.
 China's primary aim is to strengthen fortifications at the first defensible
 terrain along traditional invasion routes by forming new garrison units and
 improving the firepower and mobility of existing units. China also is
 strengthening the combat capabilities of main-force units located farther
 back.
 The improvements reflect Beijing's strong commitment to its strategy of
 defense in depth. Beijing believes that these changes would buy additional.
 time for it to move reinforcements into secondary defensive positions and
 block advancing Soviet forces.
 We doubt, however, that the Chinese could stop a concerted Soviet attack,
 but they could make it potentially more costly for Soviet troops to break
 through the outer perimeter of China's defensive network. We believe that
 a stronger defense in the north may give Beijing greater flexibility in
 considering military operations against other neighboring countries by
 making it costly for the Soviets to retaliate.

 We expect the Chinese buildup opposite the Soviet Union to continue, but
 its pace and size will depend on the outcome of the current Sino-Soviet
 talks. The Chinese are now in a stronger bargaining position and might be
 willing to withdraw a few infantry divisions from border regions as a
 reciprocal though largely symbolic gesture of conciliation. We believe in
 any case China will continue to modernize its forces in the north with new
 and better defensive weapons as they become available.
 We foresee little change in Beijing's war-fighting strategy during the
 1980s. China will continue to lack the modern weapons needed to stand up
 to the well-equipped Soviet forces, but as more advanced Chinese weapons
 come on line over the next few years, China should be able to partially re-
 dress its serious deficiencies in antitank and air defenses.
 We believe that by maintaining a strong and largely self-sufficient
 defensive capability against the Soviets, Beijing also accrues greater
 maneuvering room in negotiations for foreign weapons and technology.
 Most importantly, in our judgment the greater strategic independence
 resulting from this strengthened defensive posture will make Beijing
 increasingly unwilling to acquiesce to a high level of US arms sales to
 Taiwan as a means of securing its own supply relationship with the United
 States.

 China Strengthens Its Forces
 on the Soviet Front
 Despite 13 years of relative quiet, the Sino-Soviet
 border remains a potential source of instability. Inter-
 est in reducing the possibility of a major confrontation
 along that frontier and improving China's security are
 key elements of Beijing's decision to seek warmer
 relations with Moscow. The resumption of talks be-
 tween the two that began in October could lead to
 some reduction in tensions on the border. Both sides
 have significantly expanded and improved their mili-
 tary capabilities since 1969, and although hostilities
 seem remote, a new confrontation could have far more
 serious consequences than the earlier ones.
 Soviet forces on the border-an issue that Beijing has
 insisted on discussing in the renewed round of talks-
 are a serious security concern for Beijing. Chinese
 officials argue-we believe with good reason-that
 Soviet forces far exceed the level necessary for the
 security and defense of the frontier. The Chinese also
 contend that the Soviets use military activity along
 the border and in Mongolia as a means of pressuring
 China and influencing Chinese policies.
 We believe the steady expansion of Soviet military
 power on China's northern border poses a serious
 dilemma for Beijing. The Chinese know that they
 cannot compete in numbers and quality of weapons
 with the Soviet military. China lacks the infrastruc-
 ture, technology, and capital to match the modern air
 and ground force weapons of the Soviets. Beijing
 wants technology from the United States and other
 Western countries. The Deng Xiaoping leadership,
 however, appears determined to pursue a more nation-
 alistic foreign policy that gives China greater inde-
 pendence in the conduct of its relations with other
 nations. This independent stance could limit Beijing's
 access to foreign military technology, forcing China
 for the most part to rely on its own efforts to meet the
 Soviet military threat.
 China's alternative to foreign assistance in military
 modernization is to continue renovating and improv-
 ing its defenses against a Soviet attack-the same
 course that it has doggedly followed for the past few
 years. This paper examines those preparations, relates
 them to Soviet military developments opposite China,
 and assesses their place in traditional Chinese strate-
 gy. It also provides an assessment of what those
 preparations give the Chinese in the way of an
 improved military position vis-a-vis the Soviet Union,
 and projects the trend of China's border forces
 through the 1980s.
 As Seen From Beijing
 Beijing views Soviet military power as the major long-
 term threat to Chinese security. It regards Soviet
 military power as the pillar of Soviet foreign policy
 and draws a direct correlation between what it per-
 ceives as the Soviets' growing political assertiveness in
 Asia and their expanding military strength. The
 Chinese see Soviet strategy in Asia as "offensive,"    25X1
 with the goal of driving out the United States,
 controlling northeast Asia, and encircling China both
 politically and militarily. In that regard, they link
 together Soviet military aid to India, the Soviet
 invasion of Afghanistan, the ongoing Soviet military
 buildup and modernization on China's northern bor-
 der, the expansion of the Soviet Navy in the Pacific,
 and the Soviets' support of Vietnam and their expand-
 ing presence in Indochina.
 As a hedge against further Soviet gains in the region,
 China has strengthened its already close ties to North
 Korea and has improved relations with the United
 States and Japan by stressing common strategic inter-
 ests. In keeping with its long-held goals of self-
 sufficiency and independence, however, Beijing has
 eschewed military alliances.

 China plays down the likelihood of a Soviet attack
 any time soon. The Chinese, moreover, appear confi-
 dent that their small, concealed missile force deters a
 preemptive nuclear attack by the Soviets who, we
 believe, cannot be certain of eliminating China's
 ability to retaliate and destroy major population
 centers in the Soviet Far East. Former Chinese
 Defense Minister Geng Biao told
 that China's nuclear arsenal is so well hidden
 that it would survive a first strike and still have the
 capability to inflict intolerable damage on the Soviets.
 The Chinese also believe that Soviet conventional
 forces currently available along the Sino-Soviet fron-
 tier are insufficient to mount successfully a major
 conventional attack against China and that Moscow
 would be reluctant to weaken its defenses opposit..
 Europe or in volatile South Asia to reinforce the
 China front.
 The Chinese reiterate that their strategy of "people's
 warfare" would ensure that a Sino-Soviet conflict
 would be protracted-a situation the Soviets would
 want to avoid. The Chinese also cite the advantages
 that accrue to them as a result of their vast territory,
 large manpower resources, and determination to en-
 dure great hardships if a war with the Soviet Union
 develops.
 Its Effects
 Evidence                              indicates
 that the Soviet threat pervades virtually all of China's
 military development and force planning. We believe
 the threat helps give Chinese military leaders a high
 political stature and serves as an incentive to improve
 Chinese forces.
 military training is oriented toward devel-
 oping tactics and doctrine for countering Soviet offen-
 sive advantages.                         last
 year's Zhangjiakou exercise-the country's largest-
 ever joint-service maneuvers-was designed specifi-
 cally to test the armed forces' capability to counter a
 major Soviet attack aimed at the capital:
 ? The threat also has forced Beijing to maintain a
 large standing Army-currently some 3.7 million
 combat troops in ground, air, and naval forces-
 which represents a considerable burden on China's
 meager economic resources. China stations nearly
 half of its ground and air forces-about 1.6 million
 men and some 2,700 combat aircraft-in the mili-
 tary regions bordering the Soviet Union and Mon-
 golia.
 ? The need to counter Soviet advantages, particularly
 those in armor and tactical air forces, heavily
 influences China's selection of new weapons for the
 services. Concern about Soviet superiority also af-
 fects the development of China's war-fighting strat-
 egy and force deployment.
 ? The threat also has stimulated military moderniza-
 tion. The sophisticated equipment that the Soviets
 have massed on their side of the border contrasts
 sharply with the obsolescent Chinese hardware and
 adds to the demand from military leaders for newer
 and better weapons.
 Military officers have expressed disappointment at
 China's inability to supply its armed forces with
 modern weapons produced locally or imported from
 the West.
 China's Knowledge of Soviet Forces
 China is well aware of the steps the Soviets have
 taken over the past few years to improve their military
 posture along the Sino-Soviet frontier. Whatever oth-
 er intelligence may be available to Beijing, the Chi-
 nese have sharpened their knowledge of Soviet mili-
 tary developments through greater contact with the
 West, including participation in conferences on strate-
 gic issues, and through access to unclassified publica-
 tions on the military balance. High officials, military
 officers, and analysts at the Beijing Institute of
 International Strategic Studies all tell a consistent
 story about the Soviet buildup, and the strength

 Secret
 figures they provide on Soviet forces are reasonably
 accurate. There are no indications that the Chinese
 deliberately distort the data in order to exaggerate the
 threat.'
 Beijing clearly perceives an acceleration in the rate of
 improvement of Soviet military capabilities since the
 late 1970s and attributes this primarily to Soviet
 concerns about improved relations between China and
 Japan-the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and
 Friendship was signed in 1978-and the establish-
 ment of diplomatic relations with the United States in
 1979. The Chinese specifically tie the Soviet buildup
 to the visit of former President Leonid Brezhnev to
 the Soviet Far East in 1978.
 ? Formed new commands to improve control of mili-
 tary operations in the Far East. Last year a Beijing
 Institute official cited as "an important strategic
 measure" the Soviets' reestablishment of the High
 Command of Soviet Forces in the Far East in 1978.
 He also showed concern over the creation in 1980 of
 a new theater-level air army-a reorganization of
 existing Air Force assets designed to improve con-
 trol of Soviet air operations. The Chinese evidently
 view such measures as indicative of Moscow's ef-
 forts to improve its control over military campaigns
 in the region.
 ? Built SS-20 IRBM bases and deployed Backfire
 bombers to the area. Xu Xin, a Deputy Chief of the
 Chinese General Staff, told
 that China is worried about these
 deployments, and Beijing Institute analysts have
 stated that the two weapon systems greatly improve
 the Soviets' ability to attack strategic targets in
 Asia.
 'Although China's estimate of 1-1.2 million Soviet troops along its
 northern border is over twice the CIA estimate, Chinese figures
 probably represent the strength of Soviet forces after full mobiliza-
 tion for war. If Moscow were to flesh out all its understrength units
 on the border, we believe our current estimate of some 435,000
 troops would more than double and thereby approximate the
 ? Established new ground force divisions and moved         I
 others closer to China's borders. Deng Xiaoping,
 commenting                       on the Soviet   25X1
 "danger to China" last June, noted that the Soviets 25X1
 had some 50 divisions on the border. A year earlier
 during a Beijing seminar on Sino-Soviet relations,
 Wu Xiuquan, the President of the Beijing Institute
 and a Deputy Chief of the General Staff, cited the
 increased number of Soviet troops along the frontier
 and in Mongolia "especially in the last two years"
 as an example of the growth in Soviet military
 strength opposite China.
 ? Modernized the equipment in air and ground units
 on the border. Beijing Institute assessments accu-
 25X1
 rately note the arrival of advanced combat aircraft
 such as MIG-23s, -25s, -27s, and attack helicopters,
 25X1
 and modern ground force equipment such as T-72
 I
 tanks, BMP infantry fighting vehicles, and self-
 propelled artillery.
 China has reacted to the Soviets by renovating and
 improving its northern defenses. The program, which
 began in 1979, involves primarily the ground forces
 but, we believe, almost certainly will involve the air
 and air defense forces more extensively as more
 modern weapons become available. The buildup has
 proceeded at a steady, moderate pace within the
 framework of the existing military structure and in a
 defensive context
 The new program is reminiscent of the large-scale
 augmentation of China's northern defenses that oc-
 curred after the Chinese and Soviets clashed on
 Damanskiy Island in 1969.
 China shifted whole armies and un re s
 o thousands thousands of troops northward over the ensuing two
 to three years and realigned its forces to meet the new
 threat from the Soviet Union. Following that massive
 buildup, the Chinese made only gradual improve-
 ments to their forces during the mid-1970s when they
 concentrated on filling out units in other areas of the
 country

 The Decision To Reinforce
 We believe Beijing apparently decided in 1978-79
 that its defenses in the north were no longer adequate
 to deter a Soviet attack. The decision probably result-
 ed from two factors: Beijing's initial perception that
 the Soviets intended to augment their forces along
 China's northern frontier and a deep concern over the
 deteriorating situation on China's southern flank
 where the Soviets were forging a strong relationship
 that threatened Chinese interests in Southeast Asia.
 Extensive coverage in the Chinese press indicated
 China was well aware of the increased Soviet presence

 "Cuba of the East" and publicly portrayed it as a

 ment of China.

 In aggregate, the Chinese effort has increased the
 number of major weapon systems-tanks, armored
 personnel carriers, field artillery-in the border mili-
 tary regions by about 30 percent over the levels
 existing there in 1978 (table). The size of the increase
 varies by weapon system and region, and some of the
 equipment increases result from the creation of new
 units.
 Over the same period, the Soviets have also increased
 the number of tanks, APCs, and artillery pieces in the
 four border military districts opposite China. Between
 1978 and 1982, the number of artillery pieces in-
 creased by 1,700, the number of APCs by 2,600, and
 growing vulnerability in the north was heightened in
 March 1979 when the Soviets moved forces into
 Mongolia and staged the larges

 the number of tanks by 1,200.
 In the Northeast. China's expansion and improve-
 ments of its northeastern defenses rival the buildup
 and reorientation of military forces that occurred in
 the region after the 1969 clash when China shifted its
 focus from the coastal and southern provinces to the
 northern border (figure 2). The new effort relies
 largely on upgrading the equipment of existing units,
 arming newly created garrison units for defense of
 invasion corridors, and increasing the mobility and
 firepower of main-force units
 We believe the defensive nature of the buildup is
 reflected in the priority that Beijing has assigned to
 strengthening the ring of garrisons

 ? Armored regiments have been added to eight garri-
 son divisions. Only one garrison had an armored
 regiment before 1979. The new units are equipped
 primarily with old tanks, which, while no match for
 modern Soviet tanks, do provide increased firepower
 and tactical mobility to the garrisons.
 ? Artillery inventories of garrison divisions have
 grown significantly and are highlighted by an em-
 phasis on antitank weaponry. The Chinese have
 brought in 122-mm howitzers, 130-mm field guns,
 truck-mounted 130-mm multiple rocket launchers,
 and added to the garrisons' inventories of 85-mm
 antitank guns (figure 5). Small numbers of China's

 China also evidently is strengthening its antitank
 defenses.                            small num-
 bers of the Chinese-produced Sagger antitank guided
 missile are being deployed with units along the Sino-
 Soviet border (figure 8). The Sagger is effective from
 all sides against the Soviet T-54/55 and T-62 tanks
 and against the T-72 except from head on. We believe
 the Sagger, when widely deployed, would substantial-
 ly bolster China's defenses in offsetting the Soviets'
 massive edge in armor.
 Chinese defense plants have had difficulty manu-
 facturing the Sagger, however, and it has not yet been
 produced in large numbers. Military publications
 show that the Chinese have had more success in
 developing and producing a 62-mm light antitank
 rocket, which reportedly is now being deployed with
 infantry units in the northeast.
 In the Northwest. A substantial reinforcement of
 Urumqi Military Region has been under way since
 1979 and probably results from Beijing's assessment
 that this region was most vulnerable to a Soviet strike
 in retaliation for its invasion of Vietnam (figure 9).
 The Urumqi area is largely desert wasteland and
 would be difficult to defend using China's preferred
 occupy positions around the city of Urumqi and in the
 line of mountains extending westward to the Soviet
 border

 ations; and low-level bombing attacks
 This trend in training is epitomized in the joint-
 service exercise held last year at Zhangjiakou, which
 sits astride a major invasion corridor leading to
 Beijing from the Soviet Union and Mongolia (figure
 11). That exercise was China's largest ever and
 involved as many as 50,000 troops and 500 combat
 aircraft. In that heavily publicized exercise, Beijing
 tested coordination between air and ground forces in
 joint operations and used "aggressor" units to add
 realism to the maneuvers. The exercise scenario also
 included practice in defensive chemical, biological,
 and radiological warfare; airborne and paradrop oper-
 This year the Chinese mounted a large combined-
 arms exercise in Lanzhou MR involving infantry,
 artillery, and tank units. Press reports stated that the
 training emphasized combat against a Soviet-modeled
 force equipped with armed helicopters, tanks, self-
 propelled artillery, and motorized infantry units.C
 the Chinese are paying
 On the whole, however, Beijing's Air Force improve-
 ments pale in comparison to those made by the Soviets
 in recent years. According to our estimates, they have
 added hundreds of advanced fighters, fighter-bomb-
 ers, and bombers to units in the Far East. Chinese
 industry officials admit that China lacks the technol-
 ogy to design, develop, and produce high-performance
 combat aircraft that can compete with the newest
 Soviet models. China's combat aircraft still outnum-
 ber Soviet combat aircraft in the border regions-
 2,700 to 2,400-but the margin has been greatly
 reduced in recent years, and, as we have noted, the
 quality of China's aircraft is low. As China does
 acquire new aircraft and weapons for the Air Force,
 we expect them to go first to units in the north
 Training. China is redirecting its military training in
 order to better prepare its forces for the conditions
 they would face in a war with the Soviets. The
 Chinese press has discussed the Army's "new task" of
 training under modern conditions, and, during the
 past three years, military maneuvers have become
 larger and more realistic based on scenarios that
 simulate combating an opposing force having the
 increased attention to maneuvers in which tank units
 train with mechanized infantry units, suggesting that
 Chinese ground forces are developing tactics for
 mobile, combined-arms operations in open country.
 We believe this could mean that China plans to
 provide more infantry divisions with armored person-
 nel carrier regiments as equipment becomes available.
 For Defense Strategy
 The improvements opposite the Soviet Union are
 largely defensive in nature, and this suggests to us
 that China remains committed to its strategy of
 defense in depth to counter any Soviet attack. The
 new and strengthened garrison divisions are located
 some 100 to 300 kilometers back from the border,
 suggesting that China is resigned to the necessity of
 trading space for time in any conflict with the Soviet
 firepower and mobility of Soviet units.

 Beijing recognizes that it cannot keep pace with the
 Soviets in designing and producing modern weapons
 needed to meet the. Soviets head on at the border.
 China's strategy acknowledges Soviet advantages in
 firepower and mobility and concedes that Soviet
 forces probably would break through any defenses
 that China can now establish along the frontier. Some
 Chinese main-force units might deploy forward to
 reinforce garrison units in wartime, but they probably
 would fall back to form successive lines of defense in
 areas where the Soviets breach the defenses. The
 strong emphasis on antitank weapons and tactics, on
 combined-arms training, and on simulating modern
 combat conditions indicate, however, that the Chinese
 intend to defend their territory aggressively.
 For Defense
 Although the improvements in defenses would not
 stop a concerted Soviet attack, we believe China's
 force augmentation and modernization program has
 made it potentially more costly for Moscow to mount
 a military operation against China. We continue to
 believe that Soviet forces currently stationed on the
 frontier could seize major portions of Chinese territo-
 ry along several fronts-especially in the northwest-
 and probably could break through a few corridor
 defenses and move deeper into China. The Soviets,
 however, would require substantial reinforcements or
 the use of nuclear weapons to permit overrunning and
 seizing Shenyang MR and the northernmost portion
 of Beijing MR. China's reinforced garrison divisions,
 especially those in the northeast, occupy defensive
 strongpoints on high ground and could use their
 antitank traps, antitank weapons, and artillery to
 make an attack costly to the Soviets. Moreover, in our
 judgment, China's strategy of withdrawing to succes-
 sive lines of defense before suffering heavy casualties
 and its plans to use the militia in guerrilla warfare
 virtually assure that any conflict would be protracted.
 We believe the Chinese force augmentation program
 enhances Chinese security, because it combines a
 nonprovocative posture with the prospect of a tough
 protracted conflict if attacked. By preparing only for
 a "worst case" Soviet conventional invasion-a major
 attack with strategic goals-the Chinese have re-
 duced the potential impact of less ambitious Soviet
 military actions against China. Because China is
 prepared to absorb hit-and-run attacks or punitive
 strikes, those Soviet options would have relatively
 little strategic value but high political cost and would
 carry a risk of military retaliation-such as artillery
 shelling or a limited attack across the border-and
 escalation to a larger conflict.
 For Policy Options
 The reinforcement of China's defenses-and the re-
 sulting improvements in its military position-have
 important benefits for Beijing. We believe the force
 augmentation can buy time for the Chinese to mod-
 ernize their military forces at the slow pace dictated
 by the country's overburdened economy and its limit-
 ed technology base. Prolonged stability on the north-
 ern border is an important condition for China in its
 long-range plans for modernization. Given stability,
 China can continue to develop its own weapons with-
 out undue reliance on foreign sources of advanced
 military technology, and it has maneuvering room to
 pick and choose among the available systems that it
 wants.
 The strengthened defense posture also helps Beijing
 continue its policy of self-reliance. China can thus
 forgo substantial foreign assistance or strategic alli-
 ances in defending its borders against the Soviets. In
 our judgment, the increased independence accuring
 from China's strengthened defensive posture will
 make Beijing increasingly unwilling to acquiesce to a
 high level of US arms sales to Taiwan as a means of
 securing its own arms supply relationship with the
 United States.
 China's military preparations in the north do not
 make it immune to Soviet pressure, but Beijing's
 deployments would permit military operations against
 other neighbors-for example, Vietnam or India-
 without massively reinforcing in the north to guard
 against Soviet retaliation. Beijing would, however,
 carefully assess the likelihood of a Soviet intervention
 before taking action in order to preclude fighting on
 two fronts
 Beijing may also have strengthened its bargaining
 position with Moscow on the issue of mutual with-
 drawal of troops from the border. We believe the

 Secret
 addition of three garrison divisions in the northeast
 and the large increases in the firepower of other
 garrisons would allow Beijing to withdraw a few
 main-force units without significantly affecting the
 capabilities of China's first line of defense. Beijing
 could argue that its strong but largely immobile
 garrison divisions have little offensive capability and
 should not be included in force reduction talks.
 The pace and size of continued Chinese augmentation
 of border defenses will depend on the outcome of
 Beijing's current talks with Moscow. Beijing raised
 the issue of Soviet troop withdrawals in the first round
 that Beijing would agree to mutual force reductions,
 although lengthy negotiations would probably be re-
 quired to achieve a reduction regarded as balanced by
 both sides. In such talks China at a minimum also
 probably would seek an agreement to slow down the
 expansion of border forces.
 The Chinese may be willing to withdraw a few main-
 force units from border areas if the Soviets agree to
 pull back a similar number of units from Mongolia or
 from positions along the Chinese frontier. Soviet
 motorized rifle divisions are virtually identical in size,
 organization, echelon, and combat mission to Chinese
 main-force infantry divisions but possess greater mo-
 bility and firepower. Thus Beijing would benefit from
 a 1-to-1 withdrawal of such divisions. Moreover,
 Beijing's move of main-force divisions deeper into
 China would have little effect on its capabilities
 because China's strategy is to defend in depth. Fur-
 thermore, Chinese units could be quickly loaded onto
 trains and returned to the border region. By relocating
 divisions deeper into China, Beijing would strengthen
 its strategic reserve, thereby increasing the forces
 available for redeployment to threatened areas.
 Sino-Soviet negotiations over mutual troop reductions
 and a slowing in the pace of military modernization
 almost certainly would be protracted. During this
 period, we expect the Chinese to continue to strength-
 en existing units and positions in the north. The
 Chinese efforts would be directed specifically at coun-
 tering Soviet expansion and modernization and would
 be kept in a defensive context. If the Soviets continue  25X1
 to expand their forces at the rate of one division a
 year, the Chinese would probably keep pace by
 creating a few more garrison divisions in Shenyang
 and Beijing MRs and by adding additional tank units
 in the Urumqi MR. In addition, they would probably
 improve the tactical mobility and firepower of units
 stationed opposite the Soviet Union by providing them
 more tanks, armored personnel carriers, and artillery.
 We believe the Chinese will continue to emphasize the  25X1
 development and deployment of relatively low-cost
 defensive weapons such as antitank missiles and air
 defense systems to counter Soviet advantages in ar-
 mor and aircraft. The Chinese will continue to mecha-
 nize infantry divisions and will deploy newer aircraft
 such as the F-8 and follow-on models and new        25X1
 generation surface-to-air missile systems as they be-
 come available.                                                                                                              25X1
