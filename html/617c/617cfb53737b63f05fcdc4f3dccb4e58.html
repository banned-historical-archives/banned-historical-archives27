GENERAL 
Upon arrival at Stanford University on the tenth of March, an 
inventory was taken to determine the best method of exploiting the 
vast amount of documents that had already arrived at the Library. 
This included roughly. 152 crates of Japanese docuMents, some Korean 
items, a vast amount of Russian documents, and eight crates of Chi-
nese documents that had recently arrived from China on the "Admiral 
Capps".. 
Two lines of action was decided upon: The immediate preparation 
of a general survey on foreign documents for Documents Branch. The 
immediate screening of the Chinese documents for items of possible 
intelligence value. These will be forwarded to Washington for further 
exploitation. 
The general survey of Russian, Korean, and Japanese documents 
were forwarded as Report I and II. 
With the arrival of (ORS), efforts were concen-
trated on the screening of the Chinese documents that were fast 
filling all the available floor space at the Library. Two more ship-
ments of documents from China had arrived; Eleven crates on the SS 
General Weigel (Meigel shipment No I) and seven more on the SS General 
Nreigelts second trip. (Weigel shipment No II) At least two more 
shipments were expected at Stanford from Canton, China and the Island 
of Formosa. 
To date, the eight crates of material on the Admiral Capps' 
shipment and the eleven crates of the first Weigel shipment have been 
screened. The seven crates bf the second Weigel shipment arrived 
at Stanford as I was preparing to return to Washington, 1-). C. and 
these have not been screened. (Four of these crates are earmarked 
for the University of Washington. I have requested Stanford Library 
officials to hold the remaining three crates in storage until further 
instructions from Aashington).

ADMIRAL CAPPS' SHIPMENT 
These were the original eight crates of Chinese documents I 
was sent to screen at the Hoover Library. As already indicated in 
Report II, the 10,000 sundry items of this shipment were all pub?
lished either prior to the Revolution of 1911 or during the early 
years of the Republic. Very few of the documents were published 
during the last ten years and all are of questionable value at the 
present time.

SS GENERAL NEIGEL SHIPMENT NO I (eleven crates) 
(1) Communist Chinese Documents, By purchase, gift, or ex-
change, the field representatives of the Hoover Library in China 
managed to accumulate a sizable collection of documents from the 
Communists of Yenan, Kalgan, Peiping, and Chungking. The bulk of 
the items were obtained in Yenan from party, administrative and 
military organizations, a printing office and four book stores. 
They were all published during the past ten years when party head-
quarters have been at Yenan. Earlier materials were scattered 
during the long march from Kiangsi. 
Newspapers  
a. Chieh-fang Jih-pao variously translated as uEhancipation 
Daily,' or "Liberation Daily", the leading organ of the 
Chinese Communists. Very nearly complete file from the 
first issue in May 1941 through October 1946. Parts of 
the months of June 1941 and March and December 1945 are 
missing. 
b. Pien-chtu chtun-chung pao, "Border regions Mass Newspaper" 
published in Yenan in the Shensi vernacular. It is nearly 
complete for the periods MArch 1944 to February 1945 and 
April 1946 to October 1946. This paper is far less impor-
tant for the study of general communist policy than the 
influential Chieh -fang, but it is useful for the study 
of the popular propaganda and of local problems in the 
Shensi -Kansu -Ninghsia communist area. 
c. Hsin Chung -Hua pao predecessor of the Chieh-fang, 1937 to 
1941, published every three days. This important paper 
is obtainable only from grocery shops which occasionally 
use old copies for wrapping. A search of these shops 
yielded the Hoover library a fragmentary file scattered 
through the period March 1939-May 1941. 
d, Ktang-chan pao, Journal of the War of Resistance. Pub-
lished in Shensi Province. Fragmentary file September 1944 
to September 1945. Also acquired from grocers. 
e. Sample copies of Kuan-chung pao, published in Ma-lan, Shensi 
and Pu-tui Sheng-pao, "Army Life, the ',Stars and Stripes" 
of the Eighth Route Army. 
Magazines  
a. Over seventy copies of 22 different magazines were obtained, 
all 1946 vintage except a few. 
b. Fifteen miscellaneous pamphlets dated 1945 and 1946.

(3) WALTER HEISSIG - MONGOL COTJACTION  
Eight of the eleven crates of the first Weigel shipment 
constituted the collection of Dr. Walter Heissig, former university 
professor in Peiping, who during the period of World War a was a 
member of Nazi Intelligence service in the Orient headed by Lt. Col. 
Ludwig Ehrhardt. Ehrhardt Bureau coordinated German army, navy, air 
and economic intelligence activities in the Far East, and its field 
extended from Siberia to Ceylon, Australia, and the Pacific Ocean 
areas as far as Hawaii. Dr. Walter Heissig was the expert on Inner 
and Outer Mongolia. The Heissig collection, without doubt, is one 
of the best existing collections on Mongolia, the material is mostly 
of a technical scholarly type. The majority of the seven or eight 
thousand volumes are written in Mongol, Russian, German, and Chinese. 
Altho the majority of the collection is background material on 
Mongol literature, steps should be taken to have the collection for-
warded to Central Intelligence Group for reference material and 
perusal for further exploitation. There are at best only a very small 
handful of Mongol language experts in the United States and lithe 
material is not going to yield up any secrets except in the hands 
of a genuine scholar, carefully trained in the subject for many 
years. A copy of the 18 January 1947 issue of the New York Times 
stating that Dr. Walter Heissig was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment 
by United States Army Commission for his activities with the Ehrhardt 
Bureau is included in this report. Before his actual confinement, 
Dr. Heissig gave Mr. Arthur Wight (Stanford Representative in China), 
countersigned by Heissigis lawyers, authorization for Nr. Wight to 
take over the Heissigts collection until his 20 year prison sentence 
is over. This fact is not known to others except to Stanford library 
authorities and Mr. Wright. Attached also is a copy of a letter 
from Wright to Dr. Fisher of the Hoover Library giving the background 
of the attempt by one Kullgren (at present,believed to be with Intelli-
gence Division, Pentagon Bldg.) to procure the collection for Washington 
at the time, but Stanford field representatives had already got the 
collection an board the SS General Weigel for shipment to Stanford. 
Before my departure for Washington, I spoke to Dr. Fisher casually 
about the Heissig Collection, and during the course of the conversation 
Dr. Fisher stated with reluctant acquiesence that if Washington 
authorities request for the collection, he had no recourse but to 
let it go.

' From New York Times 18 Jan. 1947 Re: Walther Heissig, Herbert Mueller. 
"Ehrhardt. German Spy in Orient, and 20 Aides sentenced in China. 
Leader Gets Life Term From United States Army Commission for Hiding Japanese-
Two Receive 30 Years. 
By Henry R. Lieberman: special to the New York Times. 
Shanghai, Jan. 17--Lieut. Col Ludwig Ehrhardt, Chief of the Nap Intelligence service 
in the Orient, was sentenced today to life imprisonment by the U.S. Army Military 
Commission. He was convicted of conducting espionage for the Japanese after Germany's 
surrender. 
Twenty other members of the Ehrhardt Bureau were found guilty of violating the 
Garman surrender terms by continuing espionage activities. Two were sentenced to 
thirty years' imprisonment and the rest, including a young woman, Frau Maria Mueller, 
received prison terms ranging from five to twenty years. 
Flanked by six military police, some of the defendants jerked to rigid Prussian-
style attention as their names were called. Most displayed little emotion. 
Ehrhardt, a hollow-cheeked, bespectacled man of about 45, who looks more like a 
tired bookkeeper than a master spy, stood up dejectedly. A gulp slid down his thin 
neck as he heard his punithment fixed at "hard labor for the rest of your natural 
life"; 
Chief has Vast Field 
Ehrhardt handed the German fifth column in the Balkans before he was sent to 
China to coordinate German army, navy, air and economic intelligence activities here. 
He took over in December, 1942, and his field extended from Siberia to Ceylon, Australia 
and Pacific Ocean areas as far as Hawaii. 
Two who received thirty-year terms were Baron Jesco von Puttkamer, former chief of 
the German Information Bureau, and Alfed Romain, propagandist, who once worked for 
the German Library of Information in Nev York. 
In the summer of 1941 almost the entire staff of the Library of Information at 
17 Battery Place Was shifted to Shanghai. The mailing list was sent ahead earlier by 
diplomatic pouch. 
Four persons received twenty year sentences, including Hans Hosberg, a Jewish 
journalist who became an "honorary aryan" after fifth column work in Danzig and Poland.

c/C to EHR to: New York Peiping, 18 Feb 1947 
Washington 
Dear Dr. Fisher: 
I mailed my letter of yesterday's this morning, and this afternoon 
I had a caller and a letter both of which you should know about at once. 
A letter from Heissig dated Feb. 4 WAS sent through the military 
attache Is pouch, and thus took two weeks to reach no. I have had 
much more recent letters through ordinary post, but not mentioning the 
two matters touched on in this letter of Feb. 4. 
1. His dictionaries were returned to him, and he will be allayed 
to take them to Germany, along with his research manuscripts, etc. 
2. Co].. Lewis L. Leavell, Asst U S military attache came to Heissig 
in the jail on Feb. 5 and told him that a radiogram from Kullgren 
requested Heissig to send H's book to Kullgren in Washington. He 
could not but agree, and in his letter of Feb. 4 he instructs me to 
turn the books over to the Asst. military Attache in Peking for shipment 
in army pouches to Kullgren. Maj. Bradley, who is asst. mil. attache 
here came to the house this afternoon, bringing H's letter and asking me 
to turn the books over to him. I told him of course that they were on 
the Gen. Weigel en route to the US. His impression is that they are 
wanted officially in Washington and that it is not a move on Xullgren's 
part to safeguard the collection himself, but he WAS not perfectly cer-
tain. I suggest that you get in touch with Hullgren at once and try to 
straighten the matter out. 
Ey personal opinion is that the collection should be kept together, 
and you could do a better job of that than the bureaucrats. Secondly, 
the material is mostly of a technical scholarly type. I know that all 
branches of intelligence have got the mind up about their lack of 
knowledge of Mongolia. But the Heissig collection is slanted more on 
Mongol literature than anything else, and that material is not going to 
yield up any secrets except in the hands of a genuine scholar, carefully 
trained in the subject for many years. A catalogue and microfilming would 
be the first steps in appraising its value and making parts available. 
I am sure you can work out some agreement with Kullgren or the 
War Department, but I should think immediate action desirable, as they 
might try to intercept the shipment when it comes off the Weigel* mix it 
up with our awn acquisitions, etc., etc. Parenthetically and between 
ourselves, Heissig gave me a paper, countersigned by his lawyer, autho-
rixing me to take over his books, and his new instructions are of course 
not his awn but result from force majeure. 
Wits best regards 
Sincerely 
Sgd: Arthur

MEMORANDUM ON WALTHER HEISSIG 
1. Curriculum vitae: 
Born, Vienna 5 Dec 1913. Youth in Vienna, Matriculum Berlin, Oct '35 
1935-36 service in German Army, through that service loss of Austrian 
citizenship, conferment of German. For a brief period member SS. 
Studies: 1936-9 studied Mongol, some Chinese, ethnology, geography, 
prehistory, archeology at Berlin Univ. 
Service in the Army, autumn 1939--autumn 1940, dismissed because of health. 
(published in "Geopolitik") Continued studies at Vienna U. 1940-41. 
Ph.D (summa cum laude) Thesis: "Der mongolisohe Kulturwandel in den 
Hsinganprovinzen." 1940-41 assistant in Far Eastern Dept. Museum of Ethnology 
May 1941, travel via Siberia to Manchuria. Jul-Aug travel in the Mongol areas 
of the three 'eastern provinces. 
Outbreak of war with Russia prevented return to Germany. Resided in Changhun 
until Autumn 1943. Study of Mongol language and problems. Autumn 1943, called 
under Army orders, to work for the so-called Erhardt bureau (German counter-
espionage) at Peiping. Continued that work until 8th May 1945, publishing at 
the same tine in Folklore Studies, Monumenta Serioa? and Sinelogische Arbeiten. 
1944-45 lecturer Catholic University, Peiping. Published the monograph 
"Bolur Erika" June 1946. Taken in early June to Shanghai charged with "illegal 
post surrender activities in connection with the so-called Erhardt Bureau". 
Is now on trial. 
Comment: There is agreement among those who know that Heissig is a vary gifted 
young scholar. I cite Lattimore, Lessing who knows his work), and Antoine 
Mostaert, the greatest living hengolist. He is by nature impulsive, and in his 
early twenties, joined various violent youth movements which led eventually to 
his loss of Austrian citizenship and his draftinginto the German Army. I think 
he sincerely and genuinely, and for a long period has regretted his early mis-
takes, and he was apparently not among the active Nazis either here or in 
Manchuria, though heves under orders to work for the bureau. This is not an 
easy matter to judge, but I am convinced that he has lost whatever immature 
fascist ideas he may once have had. He has boundless enthusiasm for his work, 
a fine analytical mind, great technical competence. He is a vigorous and 
lively companion. His English is fair but improving. 
3. Plan: Before the arrest he gave me an outline of his p4ns: (1) a Continu-
ation of my Bolur Erike, reconstruction of the Ghengis tan epic and the sayings 
of Ghengis Khan. (2) A history of mongol nationalism. (3) Edition of the 
mongol historical chronicles which I discovered in manuscript in Mongolia. "I 
could be used as teacher for anoient and modern Mengel history, mongol language 
and literature, library workon a Mongol collection, work in the Far Eastern 
Department of an Ethnological Institute." He is at present on trial, and 
although Kullgren sent a strong letter of recommendation to be used on his 
behalf, and Dr. Stuart promised him a Yenching post, should he be freed, 
Heissig is new of the opinion that, in accordance with American orders, he 
will be deported to Germany at the end of the trial. He believes, and has 
been informed that this will hold -whether he is found guilty or not. The 
defense Attorneys are certain that he will be found innocent. I have talked 
with them. Unless stronger pressure from America intervenes, it now appears 
that he will have to return to Germany. 
4. Library: His collection contains many rare, some unique books and mis. If 
the Hoover library is agreeable, I shall have them sent there for safekeeping. 
Please let me know. From your experience in handling other German libraries, 
you will probably be able to tell whether the presence of his books on your

it, I shall try to have a full list made. It fills 
cubic feet each. 
5. Recommendations: It is my opinion that Heissig would make up for our national 
deficiencies in Mongol studies. He would be a stimulating member of a Far-
Eastern Institute. His knowledge in the field is unique. If Stanford or the 
Hoover Institute contemplates such a program, you should make every effort 
to get him. 
I should not like, however, to stand as sole sponsor for him. 
young and without academie standing, and we have come in for a 
criticism for our efforts to save Heissig and Dr-. Walter Fuchs 
tation. You probably know from your European experiences what 
public reaction there might be to calling him to Stanford, and 
probably be plenty of sniping from those in possession of only 
facts.

I think that Lattimore, who spend a day with Heissig here last Jan, and 
appointed him his book agent, would be qualified to advise in this matter. 
Kullgren sees it from the point of view of national policy (though he likes 
Heissig very much personally), and some branch of the government ought in 
the national interest, to stand sponsor for Heissig if you take the initiative 
in keeping his usefulness available. 
Any steps in this line should be taken at once, for deportation is likely to 
come up at any time. The Chinese, with their idea that once on trial means 
certain guilt, will be difficult to deal with, and even Dr. Stuart may not 
be able to guarantee his immunity from Chinese interferenoe, s#ould he be 
allowed to remain in China* If deported he mill go to Munich. He is persona 
non grata to the Austrian government. It might be possible to get him out of 
Germany, but you probably know the difficulties in such an operation, esp. if 
he has beendeported from China as undesirable. He has no backlog of money 
to keep him going, aid immediate financial relief would have to be forthcoming 
should he be exempted, temporarily or permanently from deportation. 
For your information I quote from a letter from State to Prof. Goodrich who 
had written asking them to exempt Drs. Fuchs and Heissig from deportation 
(2 July 1946) "...the appropriate agencies have established the connection 
with the Nazi war effort of both Dr. Heissig and Dr. Fuchs and the Department 
has concurred in such measures as may be found necessary and appropriate in 
connection with the repatriation of these two Germans...However, the War 
Departnent has determined that Germans in China, particularly those connected 
with the Nazi party and its activities in China should be repatriated to 
Germany. The Dept. of State concurs with this policy." 
P.S. He has a wife in Vienna whom he is trying to divorce.

V MISCELLANEOUS 
a. German Embassy Collection 
Tentative arrangementzhave been made by Sanford Library 
representatives to obtain the Library of the german Embassy in Peiping. 
This Library consists of some 10,000 volumes of which approximately 
1,000 are standard bound foreign volumes, the rest being made up of 
journals, reports, pamphlets etc. The languages used in order of 
frequency are: German, Chinese, English, French, Italian, Russian, and 
Japanese. Since the collection belonged to the German Embassy, it 
should contain documents of possible intelligence value on the Far East; 
I Have no knowledge where the collection exist this date. During my 
last conference with Dr. H. H. Fisher before returning to Washington, I 
inquired of Dr. Fisher if any German Embassy material were in the Hoover 
Library stacks; Dr. Fisher stated that the Library did have some of the 
items, but requested that I keep the matter confidential as it mould 
involved a great number of people. 
b. Mongolia and Sinkiang 
The Hoover Library is very interested in foreign publications relating 
to Mongolia and Sinkiang. I underistand that contact has been made with 
Professor Basil Alexeev, Director, Chinese Cabinet, Oriental Institute, 
Academy of Science of the USSR, Leningrad for the Institute's bibliography 
of material on these areas. 
About 17 February 1947, Stanford field representatives in China established 
contact with the Consul-General in Urumchi and requested that all back 
issues of Tartar newspapers, current subscriptions and all local publications 
be sent to Stanford University. 
e. Japanese Collection 
At the present time, the Hoover Library has about 160 crates of Japanese 
documents on hand. Each month, various Stanford representatives in Japan 
send on an average of two crates to the Library. These crates fortunately 
contain "shipping list" itemizing the Contents. I have already informed 
Hoover Library officials that Documents Branch was interested in obtaining 
copies of all the "shipping list" and have coordinated with 50X1 
to have his typist make copies for DB. In general, the type of-documents 
in this collection are of a lower priority competed with the Chinese 
documents. Suffice it is to have on hand in Documents Branch a complete 
listing exactly what is available at Stanford. 
d. Kiang YU-Wei's Printed Works 
Hoover Library representatives in China microfilmed six to eight volumes 
of the printed works of 'clang Yu,awei. These were obtained from the 
immediate family of Mr. Vang. 
e? Tang Wu Kung Pao  
Hoover Library is negotiating with the Kuomintang to obtain complete files 
of the party gazette which circulates only to party members.

f. Mho's Who (Kuomintang) 
Stanford University representatives in China succeeded in procuring 
from the Communist a complete up-to-date Who's Who giving the top 
echelon personnel of the Kuomintang. At present, the original 
document is being microfilmed at Harvard University to be returned 
to Stanford in the near future. 
VI NOTES FOR THE RESEARCHER 
As the screening of the Chinese documents progressed, I jotted 
down tidbits of information on certain documents that may be of use 
to the researchers. I an passing these notes on for what they're 
worth. 
The Proof of Russia's Secret Plot 
Four volumes dealing with the secret Russian documents that Marshal 
Chang Hsueh Liang's Military Police seized in their raid on the Russian 
Embassy located at Peiping on the 6th of April, 1926. These volumes 
published the more important documents from among the many hundreds 
taken. (original Russian documents photostated with Chinese translations) 
It brings out documentary praf of Russian economic and military 
penetration of China. It demonstrates (with charts) haw the Russian 
spy system operated to procure Chinese military and economic secrets, and 
haw confusion was caused in China by the supplying to the Chinese 
Communist munition and financial aid to promote strikes, revolts and 
civil war. It also showed that their final aim will be to achieve World 
Revolutions by attacking capitalistic countries one at a time. 
China's Four Great Families 
Communist condemnation of the "Big Four" families currently occupying 
the key spots in China, namely Chiang, Soong, Kung 'and Chen or Chiang 
Kai Shek, The Soong sisters minus Hadame Sun Yet Sun, H. H. Kung and the 
Chen brothers of the central clique. Accusation includes charges of 
mal-practices with regards to foreign exchange, the creation of trade 
monopolies, eto., for self benefit entirely at the expense o1. the people. 
The Secret Societies of Ching Pang and Ko Lao  
This is the first time I've had the good fortune to oome across a book of 
this nature. I recommend full translation of its contents to gain an 
insight to the workings of secret organizations new operating in China. 
I also highly recommend a very limited distribution of translated copies for 
security reasons. Originally one 'of the secret organizations was formed 
to overthrow the Manchu Dynasty. Subsequently, the organization was used 
for otherpurposes. During World Mar II, both secret organizations under 
friirlr4r

. 
Tai Ii served as an effective spy system on the Japanese. With the 
fall of Japanese war machine, the nationalist government used the 
two organizations to keep the Communist in line. Although the 
Communist published the volume to expose the workings of Ko Lao and 
ahiang Pang societies, the same information would be of tremendous 
use to our awn intelligence organization in China. 
Ilritings of Lu Hsiun  
Six volumes on the works of Lu Hsiun eincluded among the Chinese 
documents screened. Five volumes published by the-CoMmunist and one 
by the KUqmintang advocates. On the surface these volumes appear to have 
no immediate intelligence value, but I recommend that re/searchers may 
pay careful attention to the name of La Hsiun. Naw deceased, Chow Shu-Jen 
(Chow Shou-Jon) (better known undel7aniarre-plume, Lu Hsiun) exercised 
a tremendous influence upon the followers of Communism. A brilliant 
man with very humble circumstances, he could have been a man of tremendous 
wealth and power in China if he would have but compromised his principles. 
But principles triumphed over wealth and Lu Hsiun died a poor man. In 
the last few years, the name of Lu Hsiun became tremendously popular 
with the average citizens of china--both Communist and KMT followers alike. 
His sound principles and progressive thoughts have been taken over and 
interpreted by Communist scholars as the same progressive and liberal 
viewpoints expounded by the Chinese Communist Party. This form of 
propaganda has tremendous appeal to the average Chinese with the result 
that many, if not openly, have secretly admired the Communist Party. 
It appears to me that CIGis interest in Lu Hsiun is this. Here is a 
man that has tremendous following in China, all classes alike, in both 
parties. By studying closely the thoughts and writings of Lu Hsiuns 
timely propaganda could probably be effected to point out to Mr. John Doe 
of China that the Lu Hsiunts thoughts, writings, and the views of the 
Communist Party are not oneor the same.

VII SUMMARY REMARKS 
a. My tour of duty at the Hoover Library confirmed a long-held 
conviction that the most expedient and economical method of 
exploiting a document target site calls for Documents Branch 
representatives initially to perform the spade work of surveying 
such sites to determine scope and content of the collection, 
performing if required, the necessary screening functions* selecting 
items for further exploitation and forwarding such items by the 
mpst expeditious means to Documents Branch where the documents 
are prepared in an acceptable form (translation,etc.) for the use 
of the Research Analyst. 
The vast amount of Chinese documents arrivedd Stanford 
University in huge crates, odd boxes* bundles, bags?completely 
untranslated. Thirty-five thousand documents mere quickly scruened 
and eight hundred items selected and forwarded to Documents 
Branch where the items mill be accessioned in Documents Branch 
publications and disseninated to all authorized agencies. 
b. Any attempts at research in the field will encounter certain 
obstacles and Stanford University is no exception. All the 
necessary tools for research are centrally located in the Washington 
DC area; this includes the various technical reference books, 
dictionaries, gazetteers, the numerous expert consultants, the 
necessary ancillary personnel who are properly cleared to do even 
typing. I reiterate* Documents Branch personnel, familiar lui-Ch the 
"logistics" of documents exploitation (linguistic requirements, 
material already on hand in Documents Branch, and other Washington 
repositories) should initially perform the spade work of documents 
exploitation. 
c. Dr. Walter Heissig is spending the next twenty years in prison 
and will be deported to Germany upon completion of the term. If 
Dr. Heisaig is deported before the twenty years period, I am confident 
our worthy allies will take adequate steps to secure his services, 
sinc7777173777 is one of the few real authorities on Mongol 
territory, people, custom, language, etc. Dr. Owen Lattimore, 
Dr. Lessing (U. of Calif.) and Antoine Mostaert, the greatest living 
Mongolist mill attest to this. It is my understanding that Dr. Heissig 
has his personal dictionaries and research manuscripts with him and 
that he is at present writing a history of Mongol nationalism in 
prison. It is felt that Central Intelligence Group should exploit 
Dr. Heissigfs knowledge of Inner and Outer Mongolia in the same manner 
as German technical experts are presently being exploited. To the 
best of my knowledge, there are no Mongolian language experts in CIG, 
and Heissigls knowledge could be utilized to a high degree in this 
aspect.

de I recommend that Documents Branch take positive steps to 
procure custody of the Heissig collection from Stanford 
University for such time as required for adequate'purusal of the 
collection to determine if further exploitation is needed. I 
have already informed Mr. lay Stein tote sure the collection 
is not tampered with until further instructions from Washington. 
e. 
Before leaving the Hoover Library, I atteppted to work out 
an arrangement whereby Documents Branch will be kept informed 
of what the Library receives, especially its incoming current 
newspapers, and periodicals, special collection, etc. It was 
my intention to come back to Washington mtih a working agreement 
whereby Stanford will send to Documents Branch a duplicate 
copy of every Library card it prepares for all items indexed 
and cataolgued. Both Dr. Fisher and Miss Nina Almond, Reference 
Librarian, agrred to the idea in general. The whole conversation 
was conducted on a very informal basis, but the idea was firmly 
planted in event of future DB efforts in this direction.
