ment for the American imperialists who carried out bacteriological warfare 
and we must unite together to smash this warfare of the American 
aggressors.... Like the japanene devils, the American imperialists 
.started the preparatory work for bacteriological warfare at a very early 
dates and were even more poisonous-minded than their Japanese counterparts. 
Early in 1943 the U.S. Government established the Biological Warfare 
Commission under the War Departments setting up bacteriological murder 
factories in several places.... The most ferocious and brutal of these 
(experiments) was the experimentation on the bodies of our Chinese and 
Korean People's troops who, were captured.... American forces sailed to 
Wonsan port in Korea and made bacteriological experiments on captured 
People's Volunteerss..also on Koje Islands as admitted by reactionary 
American reporters. (Peking, Chinese Numeral Codes Mar. 17)
