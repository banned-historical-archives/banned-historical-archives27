 makes many unhealthy conditions possible
 in the post office and Government offices,
 and I believe the best way to meet the sit-
 uation is to eliminate the provision and make
 the promotions automatic.  After all. If an
 employee is not meeting acceptable standards
 of work, he can be separated as incompetent.
 If the supervisor takes this course, the em-
 ployee can defend himself through the ap-
 peals procedure.  As it now stands, however,
 the employee has no real means of defending
 himself  from  possible  vindictiveness  and
 injustice.
 Mr. Chairman, in addition to H.R. 8995 to
 provide salary increases, I want to call the
 committee's attention to other bills before
 your committee, which I have introduced in
 behalf of Federal employees, and to urge your
 early consideration of them.
 H.R. 1020, providing for 30-year retirement
 without reduction in annuity; H.R. 1023 for
 an improved system of overtime compensa-
 tion for postal field service employees; H.R.
 1021 to eliminate the use of work measuring
 devices in the postal service; H.R. 2612 to
 liberalize the annuities formula;  and H.R.
 1019 to provide an allowance for work cloth-
 ing of certain postal field service employees.
 I have also introduced H.R. 1013, which is
 before the Ways and Means Committee, to
 exempt from income tax the annuities and
 pensions of Federal employees.
 In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I want to say
 that, if we are to maintain a high level of
 efficiency in our Government service-if we
 are to retain loyal and dedicated workers and
 preserve employee morale in the Govern-
 ment-we have a definite responsibility to
 provide them with adequate pay and with
 fair and equitable work standards and pro-
 motion schedules.
 We spend billions to close the missile gap,
 to lead the space race, and for foreign aid to
 improve  the  living  standards  of  peoples
 around the globe. We must take action now
 to improve the living standards of our Fed-
 eral employees. Fe
 VIETNAM POLICIES
 (Mr.. PUR.CELL (at the request of Mr.
 ALBERT)  was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. PURCELL.  Mr. Speaker, recently
 we have been hearing more criticism of
 our policies in South Vietnam, particu-
 larly from some of our college campuses.
 Seldom, however, do we have an opportu-
 nity to get the views of those who are
 paying the heaviest price, the American
 fighting men who are helping South
 Vietnam defend itself.
 I was privileged to receive a copy of a
 letter written to the editor of the Denton,
 Tex., Record Chronicle by a resident of
 Denton serving in South Vietnam, Lones
 E. Taylor, AMII3, U.S. Navy.
 I particularly want to call attention to
 his pointed question:
 We sacrifice everything dear to us, some
 even their lives.. Is it too much for us to
 ask and expect that you at home have faith
 and back us just a little?
 For us to fail to stand with this young
 man, those who serve with him, and the
 South Vietnamese, will only delay the
 time when we would be fgrced to call a
 halt.tt the expansionist policies of the
 Communists in Asia.  If we are to con-
 tain them, and we must do this sometime
 or perish, then we must recognize that
 although South Vietnam might not be
 the most ideal place for the confronta-
 tion, the time to make our determina-
 tion clear to the Communists is now.
 Americans like to win.  This , is our
 nature, and it is very difficult for us to
 live with a situation where we can fore-
 see a long period of struggle ahead beset.
 with so many problems.  But, if we are
 to prevail in this conflict, we must real-
 ize these difficulties will be with us and
 we must recognize the need to continue
 to support our effort in South Vietnam.
 I commend this letter to my colleagues:
 A  LETTER  ON  VIETNAM
 JUNE  13,  1965.
 DEAR EDITOR: Whether or not you print this
 letter is up to you and your paper, but I
 feel I must write what I and many men over
 here in the Vietnam war feel.
 As for myself, there were many reasons I
 stayed in the Navy (of which money certainly
 wasn't one)  love of my home, family, and
 most of all, my country.  I've never thought
 of myself as being very patriotic, but the
 more I read of papers back home, it turns my
 stomach to think that people can think so
 little of this wonderful country that we live
 in.
 Among other things, the Navy has helped
 me to grow into a mat and accept my re-
 sponsibilities as a citizen of America, for
 which our forefathers fought and died so
 graciously and willingly.
 Has everyone forgotten the basis that this
 country was founded on?  Or don't they
 teach that in our colleges and universities
 today?
 I have always regretted that I didn't at-
 tend college first instead of going into serv-
 ice, but now I'm not too sure.                                                                            I would hate
 to think that I had the outlook on life and
 would so willingly turn down responsibility
 as  students  over  the country  today  are
 doing.
 They are making a mockery of everything
 that true Americans believe in today.    When
 they protest the war in Vietnam and policies
 of our Government leaders by picketing the
 White House, burning their draft cards and
 doing many other disgraceful and unpatri-
 otic things, it only shows their lack of learn-
 ing                                                                                and understanding.  They  don't  care
 what they protest, or even care whom or what
 it hurts.
 YOUTH  WILL  GOVERN  WORLD
 I realize they are only a small percentage
 of our young students, but if left to grow,
 could be our entire country, for the youth of
 today will govern the world tomorrow.
 Most of this is caused by fear.  No one
 wants war or to die in a far land that has
 little meaning to their lives.
 This is not so.  We over here know what
 we're fighting for. It isn't like the Korean
 war.   We know now that we must fight
 communism anywhere over the world where
 it threatens free people that are depressed,
 poverty stricken and that are being eaten
 alive by the Communist machine.  Not only
 for these reason but for our wives, families,
 and even our forefathers that have died be-
 fore us.
 We are over here now trying to do our job
 as we know it, but it is hard to have faith
 and fight for what we know to be right when
 people at home have no faith and aren't
 backing us as they should.  Sometimes we
 wonder if you even care about us or your-
 selves.
 Every day some of our shipmates fail to re-
 turn to the ship (USS Midway), but they go
 each day knowing if they the we will carry
 on to win over communism in the end.
 QNE..I.ORE CQPEFORT
 We left our comfortable homes, our wives
 and families to spend lonely, endless days at
 sea, our only comfort the fact that someday
 we'll be able to return in peace, for a while
 anyway.
 14217
 We sacrifice everything dear to us, some
 even their lives.  Is it too much for us to ask
 and expect that you at home have faith and
 back us just a little?
 We are the ones fighting now and we're
 not complaining about it.  Are people so
 afraid that they might be asked to fight a
 little for what (if anything) they believe in?
 There isn't any one of us here who wouldn't
 like to change places with any student back
 home, but we believe in freedom.  Doesn't
 anyone else believe in freedom any more?
 Evoryone wants peace, but to me it matters
 a great deal the price I have to pay for it.
 How can we expect to have peace and free-
 dom at the expense of countries like South
 Vietnam if we turn our backs on them?
 NO LONGER ANGRY
 When I started this letter I was angry, but
 now I have compassion for those who believe
 that peace is good no matter what they have
 to do or what rights they have to give up to
 get it.
 If we follow this line of thinking we'll soon
 have nothing else to lose and will be lost and
 buried by communism, because there will be
 nothing else to hope, believe, or fight for.
 Has our morality dropped so low?
 I've lived all my life in Denton prior to
 joining the Navy and I love the town and
 people.  When this is over (the war), I plan
 to take my discharge with 61/2 years' active
 service and return to my wife and children
 to take my place in a community that I'll be
 proud of.
 I have heard of no such demonstrations
 from the campuses of Denton and this makes
 me proud and very happy.
 If this letter serves no other purpose, I
 hope it will make a few people realize what
 I have tried to say and just understand a
 little of what is facing us.
 We'll do the job.  You just give us some
 support and we'll all be fulfilling our job.
 Give us back our faith in the American
 people again.
 Respectfully submitted.
 LoNES E. TAYLOR, AMH3.
 NEW YORK CITY IN CRISIS-PART
 CVI
 (Mr. MULTER (at the request of Mr.
 ALBERT)  was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. MULTER.  Mr. Speaker, I com-
 mend to the attention of our colleagues
 the following article which appeared in
 the New York Herald Tribune of May 3,
 1965, concerning the Women's House of
 Detention in New York City.
 The article is part of the series on
 "New York City in Crisis," and follows:
 NEW  YORK CITY  IN  CRISIS-PRISON REPORT
 ATTACKED
 (By Alfonso Narvaez)
 New York City's Women's House of De-
 tention found itself enmeshed in another
 controversy yesterday as Democratic mem-
 bers of the State and city government at-
 tacked                                                                                                                                                 Deputy Mayor  Edward  Cavanagh's
 recent report that charges of "snake-pit"
 conditions at the prison "were without sub-
 stance."                                                                                                                                                   They called for continued investi-
 gation into conditions at the penal institu-
 tion.
 Assemblyman Joseph Kottler, chairman of
 the assembly committee on penal institu-
 tions, charged that Mr. Cavanagh's report,
 made public last Tuesday, was "totally inade-
 quate and one sided."  He said that despite
 the fact that overcrowding at the prison had
 been alleviated, "it is still a snake-pit."
 Mr. Kottler, interviewed on WCBS-TV's
 "Newsmakers." said that he had the recorded
 Approved For Release 2003/10/15 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000300180020-8
 14218           Approved Fir   fr        lA~/1i~    BDPfl7B    6R000300180   e 24, 1965
 testimony of four other former inmates of
 the prison who corroborated charges of ram-
 pant Lesbianism, rats, vermin, poor food, and
 humiliating internal examinations.
 Mr. Kottler brought with him to the
 studio three women who had been arrested
 during a civil rights demonstration last Oc-
 tober and who had been held in the House of
 Detention for 5 days.
 After the telecast, the women charged that
 they had been subjected to inadequate medi-
 cal attention and humiliating examinations
 and that they had seen Lesbian activity, rats,
 and. other vermin.
 TAKEN AWAY
 Helena Lewis, 28, of 20 West 10th Street,
 said that they had been searched practically
 in  public  for           narcotics.   She  said  that
 everything had been taken away from them,
 including   medicine  that             had  been  pre-
 scribed for her by her doctor.
 One of the other women, a psychologist
 at a residence for neglected girls, said that
 one of the guards patted some of the prison-
 ers as they waited for their examination.
 Mr. Kottler said that he was hopeful that
 two State investigations would begin soon
 to look into conditions at the prison and
 others throughout the State.  He said that
 he had sponsored legislat'on calling for the
 creation of a joint legislative investigation
 committee and that Speaker of the House
 Anthony J. Travia favored the proposal.
 In a radio interview on "The WINS News
 Conference," city Councilman Paul O'Dwyer
 sharply criticized Mr. Cavanagh for his "po-
 litical" report refuting charges against the
 prison.
 "I would say that he was a less than im-
 partial reporter in connection with that sit-
 uation," Mr. O'Dwyer said.  "Several of us
 intend to make an investigation or an in-
 quiry of our own therein the coming week."
 Mr. O'Dwyer said that the report by Mr.
 Cavanagh had been made to offset a damag-
 ing report by Herman T. Stichman, Governor
 Roc:kefeller's  special  investigator,  and  to
 "come in to sort of put up a defense."
 DISCOUNT REPORTS
 Mr. O'Dwyer said that he would discount
 both reports and rely on statements by Cor-
 rections Commissioner Anna Dross, who "for
 the last 12 years has been screaming that
 conditions are bad in the Women's House of
 Detention."
 During the last 2 months more than eight
 women have complained publicly about their
 treatment at the prison and have testified
 before various investigating committees of
 the conditions there.
 If  the  3  proposed  investigations  take
 place, they will bring to 10 the number of
 committees that have probed into charges
 of  overcrowding   and  homosexual  activity
 first made public by an 18-year-old Benning-
 ton College freshman, Andrea Dworkin, who
 had been arrested during a pacifist demon-
 stration and who could not raise $500 ball.
 She has recently been subpenaed to appear
 before a May grand jury investigating condi-
 tions          and  treatment  at  the, 33-year-old
 prison, at Greenwich Avenue and West 10th
 Street.
 The prison has been the target of count-
 less investigations ever since it first opened
 "as the greatest step forward in prison his-
 tory."  The prison, originally designed to
 house 401 inmates, held as many as 650 when
 charges of "snakepit" conditions were aired
 last month.
 As a result of Deputy Mayor Cavanagh's
 preliminary investigations more than 100
 women were transferred to the top floor of
 the Brooklyn House of Detention, which
 usually houses only men.
 At last reports, there were 450 inmates
 housed in accommodations for 457.
 Reports  of  shocking  conditions  at  the
 prison and the mixing of young first of-
 fenders and other persons not yet convicted
 of crimes with hardened female prisoners
 tend to highlight another apparent failure
 in the administration of New York City.
 NEW YORK CITY IN CRISIS-
 PART CVII
 (Mr. MULTER (at the request of Mr.
 ALBERT)  was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD and to include extraneous mat-
 ter.)
 Mr. MULTER. Mr. Speaker, the fol-
 lowing article concerns the role that
 businessmen should play in solving some
 of New York City's problems.
 The article is part of the series on
 New York City in Crisis and appeared in
 the New York Herald Tribune on May
 4, 1965.
 The article follows:
 NEW YORK  CITY  IN  CRISIS-DAVID  ROCKE-
 SELLER'S CALL FOR URBAN ACTION
 (By Barrett McGurn)
 David Rockefeller, president of the Chase
 Manhattan Bank, said yesterday that "pri-
 vate business" Is the key to solving the crises
 threatening major cities from one side of
 America to the other.
 Federal, State, and municipal funds com-
 bined will never amount to more than "seed
 money" in the face of the towering and
 multiplying needs of this country's great
 urban  centers,  the  49-year-old  financier-
 philanthropist said.
 For every dollar put up by Government,
 private business will have to raise five in
 order to assemble the immense sums need-
 ed, Mr. Rockefeller calculated.
 Mr.  Rockefeller made it clear that his
 analysis applied specifically to crisis ridden
 New York, the largest of the world's urban
 concentrations.
 He spoke in Miami Beach to the 33d an-
 nual convention of the Edison Electric In-
 stitute.  He talked of America's great cities
 and mentioned that success in this country
 in meeting the challenge would be a model
 for  the whole   planet.  Mr.  Rockefeller
 pointed out that the growth of city difficulties
 has been compared by the United Nations
 World Health Organization with war and
 peace as a foremost issue of the remaining
 20th century years.  He frequently cited the
 woes and efforts of New York in arguing
 his major thesis: -
 Business should shoulder its large share
 of the burden, but more favorable tax struc-
 tures are needed as an inducement.
 "The major investment must be under-
 written by private sources.
 "And to attract such substantial funds,
 we must take steps to make investment in
 urban  redevelopment  more  appealing  in
 competition with other opportunities.
 "Modifications in some existing tax regu-
 lations, and the use of vehicles that would
 be free from some tax restraints, offer pos-
 sible avenues of approach.
 "Properly conceived, taxes can be made
 to  stimulate  growth  as  well  as produce
 revenue."
 LEADERSHIP
 Mr. Rockefeller's comments were the latest
 contribution to a great public forumon the
 crisis of such areas as New York City, a
 colloquy which has mounted in intensity
 since the start of the continuing Herald
 Tribune series on "New York City in Crisis."
 Like two other episodes, the formation of a
 Committee of 14 to cope especially with the
 New York blue collar job drain, and the
 creation of the Committee of 65 to combat
 the commuter rail crisis, Mr. Rockefeller's
 contribution was based on the prime as-
 sumption that business leadership must be
 part of any solution to the city's ills.
 Mr. Rockefeller Is a member of the Com-
 mittee of 65.  His Chase Manhattan board
 chairman, George Champion, is a key figure
 in the Committee of 14, and is immediate
 past president of the 197-year-old New York
 Chamber of Commerce, which sounded the
 first call for business leadership in tackling
 the difficulties of a city in crisis.
 Mr. Rockefeller's comments were consid-
 ered particularly significant because of his
 prominent position in New York civic and
 financial circles.   He has often been sug-
 gested as a Republican candidate for mayor
 or as the leader of a businessmen's drive to
 combat New York's difficulties, but always
 has refused to join his brother, the Governor,
 in anything smacking of politics. Mr. Rocke-
 feller is, however, president of the Down-
 town-Lower Manhattan Association, which
 has led the way in New York local reform
 by injecting hundreds of millions bf dollars
 of new life into the once-fading Wall Street
 financial area.
 Mr. Rockefeller made these remarks on
 the importance of the problem of the in-
 creasing urbanization of America:
 "The United Nations World Health Organi-
 zation declared recently that 'after the ques-
 tion of keeping world peace, metropolitan
 planning is probably the most serious single
 problem faced by man in the second half of
 the 20th century.'  Indeed, it is a problem
 of such enormous magnitude, baffling com-
 plexity and immense diversity that it coln-
 pels our attention and our energies.
 "We are coming to realize the immense
 dangers of an uncontained population explo-
 sion and all this portends for inhibiting ma-
 terial progress.  Now we must also acknowl-
 edge the dangers Inherent in an uncontrolled
 population implosion, the tremendous influx
 of people into huge urban centers and the
 self-generating congestion of our cities."
 STIMULATING NEWS
 (Mr. MULTER (at the request of Mr.
 ALBERT) was granted permission to ex-
 tend his remarks at this point in the
 RECORD   and  to  include  extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. MULTER.       Mr. Speaker, we are
 all delighted with the President's act in
 signing the excise tax reduction bill on
 Monday.  The following editorial from
 the New York Journal American of June
 21, 1965, comments upon that and sev-
 eral other pieces of good news:
 STIMULATING NEWS
 President Johnson  signs today the  bill
 providing for $4.6 billion in reductions on
 excise taxes on a wide variety of consumer
 goods.  It should be a vitamin shot to the
 economy.
 The President estimates the bill will re-
 lease about $1.75 billion in extra purchasing
 power during the remainder of this year,
 and another $1.75 billion next January when
 further excise cuts of $1.6 billion are sched-
 uled.
 Together with this development is the
 stimulating announcement by the President
 that the Federa: budget deficit for the year
 ending June 30 will be about $3.8 billion-
 $2.5  billion  less  than  his  estimate  last
 January.
 For the most part the lower budget deficit
 Is attributed to last year's cut in corporate
 and personal income taxes.  Economists hold
 it has stepped up demand for goods and
 services, thereby increasing corporate and
 personal  incomes  and      raising  Federal
 revenues.
 Other aspects of good news are:
 The administration's program to out the
 dollar drain of Government programs abroad
 has reduced the net balance-of-payment
 costs by 23 percent. or $635 million.

 FERMENT,  BITTERNESS,  AND  THE  THREAT  OF
 BLOODSH,.ED TAUNTS LIFE OF CHICAGO
 (By Paul Harvey)
 This Is Chicago.  The long, hot summer
 has begun.          In the concrete canyons of the
 Loop and in the steamy asphalt jungles
 which su;round It, there is ferment, bitter-
 Three weeks ago in Chicago, Harlem Con-
 gressman ADAM CLAYTON POWELL urged Ne-
 groes to seek for themselves  "audacious
 power."
 Coincidence or not, since that speech the
 tempo of marching, picketing, demonstrating
 has increased in Chicago.
 During the 2-day visit of the astronauts,
 the entire city held Its breath over the brazen
 boast by a rabble-rousing "rights" leader who
 threatened to "do something that will upset
 the whole country."  He didn't.
 Overwhelmed by official pleading, public
 indignation, and newspaper warnings "not
 to go too far," the demonstrators kept their
 peace for 24 hours.
 The. nyyxt day the midcity marching began
 again, protesting "de facto school segrega-
 tion," demanding the outster of School Su-
 perintendeint Willis.
 Every day now it's something else. A local
 demonstration leader says the "real target is
 Mayor Daley."
 "If we can topple the Daley machine In
 Chicago, we can topple the machine of any
 northern City. If we can't do it with marches
 we' Will take economic means.,, .
 Comic-crusader Dick ` Gregory urged fol-

 American History
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. RALPH YARBOROUGH
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Thursday, June 24, 1965
 Mr. Y'ARBOROUGH.  Mr. President,
 now pending before the Parks and Rec-
 reation Subcommittee of the Senate In-
 terior and Insular Affairs Committee is a
 bill, which I have introduced, to estab-
 lish the Alibates Flint Quarry, on the
 Canadian River, as a national monu-
 ment.
 Discovered in 1925, this 300-foot-wide,
 mile-long shard of a ridge, about 35 miles
 northeast of the present city of Amarillo,
 is one of the most significant archeolog-
 ical finds of our time. Alibates flint was
 the best material for making weapons
 and tools that the early American man
 could find; and this particular quarry is
 the only place where it could be ob-
 tained.
 Two ancient Pueblo-type villages and
 numerous campsites have already been
 discovered, and indicate that a com-
 munity developed around the quarry.
 Further archeological explorations will
 surely uncover many more significant
 relics of these early years of our conti-
 nent's history.
 In order that further explorations may
 be promoted and, in order that this im-
 portant monument of early America may
 be secured for the intellectual enrich-
 ment and pleasure of all the people of
 Texas and of our Nation, both present
 and future, I feel that it is the responsi-
 bility of this Congress to preserve the
 Alibates flint quarry as a national monu-
 ment..,
 Recently, an article entitled "Alibates
 Flint Quarry Pinpoint 'Longest Story"'
 was published in the Amarillo Sunday
 News-Globe of May 16, 1965. The article
 was written by Thomas Hough.  I ask
 unanimous consent that the article be
 printed in the Appendix of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the+e~article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Amarillo (Tex.) News-Globe, May

 ALIBATES FLINT QUARRIES PINPOINT LONGEST
 STORY ,
 (By Thomas Hough)
 AMAitILLO -=Walking over' the Alibates flint
 quarries in the Texas Panhandle makes a
 A3315
 famous stone wall are recent innovations in
 man's life upon earth.
 . The quarry contains the longest story ever
 told.
 When naked early man killed the giant
 mammoth for food, he used the best weapons
 he could get: That is why Alibates flint holds
 such a prominent place in archeology.
 Because of a $5-year secret by a dedicated
 amateur archeologist, and the administra-
 tive skills of an Amarillo businessman, the
 priceless story in the quarries now will be
 preserved for all mankind.
 The businessman is  Henry Hertner,  a
 former city commissioner, who took the lead
 in bringing the project to the attention of
 Government officials so that the site could
 be protected as a monument to prehistoric
 free enterprise.
 Sac  in .1925, Floyd Studer, of Amarillo,
 discovered the quarries on one of his many
 field trips.  Studer probably has done more
 poking around in the Panhandle than any
 other single person.
 Many of his artifacts from a lifetime of
 collecting are displayed in the Panhandle
 Plains Historical Museum at Canyon.
 Studer knew he had a great discovery, but
 he bad no_ way of exploring it.  So he kept
 it'a secret.                            ,
 He did share his discoveries with a few
 prominent  archelogists.  They   determined
 that flint from the Alibates quarries had
 been taken into Canada, to California-in
 fact, all over the West.
 Alibates flint made the best weapons and
 tools that early American man could find.
 And there was only one place in the world
 where it could be obtained-out of the 300-
 foot-wide, mile-long shard of a ridge about
 35 miles northeast of the present city of
 Amarillo.
 Archeologists say the flint must have had
 extreme value in order for early man to have
 carried it so far away from the quarries,
 Today a person can see the hundreds, at
 last count, 550 pits that pock the area.  An-
 cient man used poles, stones, and his hands
 to root through the weathered surface rock
 to get solid flint.
 . Two  ancient  Pueblo-type  villages     and
 numerous  campsites in the   area    indicate
 that at one time flourishing communities
 existed.
 Competent exploration of ancient civiliza-
 tion takes time and money.  Progress is slow.
 Studer continued to keep secret the location
 of the quarries.
 But then the Canadian River Water Au-
 thority began planning Sanford Dam to con-
 tain Lake Meredith.  The water will be used
 by  11  west Texas cities, and the lake is
 planned as a recreation area for water sports
 enthusiasts.

 Mr. FLOOD.  Mr. Speaker, the Vet-

 this House are well aware, is one of our
 most helpful and influential national or-
 ganizations.
 One of the reasons the VFW's views

 zonal knowledge.  The VFW national
 commander and the organization's na-
 tional security director have seen per-
 sonally the troubled spots that are of
 such deep, concern to our Nation.
 Within the past few weeks National
 VFW Commander John A. Jenkins, of
 Birmingham. Ala., who is weal known to
 Members of this House, and the VFW
 National Security and Foreign Affairs
 Director, Brig. Gen. James D. Hlttie,
 U.S. Maril)e Corps (retired),' personally
 visited southeast Asia, including battle
 fronts in South Vietnam. In so doing,.
 the VFW commander performed a truly
 valuable service to our country and its
 fighting men.  As representative of the
 1,800,000 overseas combat veterans, Buck
 Jenkins could personally assure our
 fighting men-and he did-that our
 country is behind them and they are not
 forgotten in the far away battlefields.
 There was another great service per-
 formed by the VFW through Commander
 Jenkins. During his visit to the Repub-
 lie of China, he flew in a Republic of
 China Air Force plane to the off-shore,
 and regularly shelled, island of Quemoy.
 This island of Quemoy is an outpost of
 freedom in Asia and is a bastion of the
 free world's defense against aggressive
 communism in the western Pacific.
 On behalf of the Veterans of Foreign
 Wars of the United States, and as a, re-
 sult of a resolution unanimously adopted
 by the VFW dt its 1964 national conven-
 tion, in Cleveland, Ohio, Commander
 Jenkins presented a VFW certificate of
 admiration and appreciation to the mili-
 tary and civilian defenders of Quemoy
 for their contribution to the defense of
 the free world. It is such things as this
 which the VFW does to strengthen our
 defense against communism, that has
 earned the VFW such high esteem in the
 United States and overseas.
 Commander Jenkins' remarks were
 brief but eloquent, and because of the
 Importance of the occasion, as well as
 what the VFW commander said, I in-
 clude his presentation address at the
 conclusion of these remarks:
 REMARKS OF JOHN A. JENKINS, COMMANDER
 IN CHIEF, VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS OF
 THE UNITED STATES, PRESENTATION OF THE
 VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS CITATION TO THE
 MILITARY AND CIVILIAN DEFENDERS OF QUE-
 MOY, QUEMOY, REPUBLIC OF CHINA, MAY 12,
 1965
 One of the high privileges that comes to
 me as the commander in chief of the Vet-
 erans of Foreign Wars of the United States,
 is to present on behalf of the VFW, citations
 honoring those who have contributed to the
 defense of the free world.  Today, it is my
 privilege and pleasure to participate in such
 a presentation.
 I bring you the greetings and respects of
 the 1,300,000 overseas combat veterans who
 comprise the membership of the Veterans of
 Foreign Wars of the United States.
 Every member of the VFW is a combat vet-
 eran.  Because of this experience, our mem-
 bers respect and admire those whe have
 demonstrated heroic bravery In the face of
 enemy attack.
 We of the VFW ,share with freedom-loving
 peoples everywhere a devotion to liberty and
 a determination to defend freedom against
 the evil attacks of communism.  We know
 that the free world can be protected only by
 people who believe so deeply in freedom that
 they will die to preserve it.
 Because we  recognize  these things,  we
 recognize the Importance of Quemoy and the
 heroism of those who have defended it so
 bravely and effectively.
 -Consequently, the thousands of delegates
 attending the 1964 convention of the Vet
 crane of Foreign Wars of the United States in
 Cleveland, Ohio, last August, unanimously
 voted to award an official citation of the
 Veterans of,Foreign Wars to the military and
 civilian defenders of Quemoy.
 This decision by the convention was made
 for many reasons:
 Because of the bravery and the determina-
 tion you have demonstrated in beating back
 repeatedly  the  onslaughts  of  Communist
 aggression.
 Because of the brave manner in which you
 defy communism while living on an island of
 freedom   literally   under  the   guns   of
 communism.
 Because  in  defending  Quemoy             against
 Communist aggression you are preventing
 communism from seizing Quemoy, which is
 one of the most strategically important posi-
 tions in the defense of the free world.
 And finally, we of the VFW take this means
 of expressing to the military and civilian de-
 fenders of Quemoy our admiration and our
 gratitude for all these things which you have
 done in the defense of your. freedom, and
 most assuredly in the defense of free peoples
 everywhere.
 At this time `it is my privilege, as com-
 mander in chief of the Veterans of Foreign
 Wars of the United States, to present this
 official citation.  It Is our hope that it will
 be for you a lasting reminder of the friend-
 ship, admiration, and esteem in which you
 are held by the members of our organization.
 It is our hope, too, that although we may be
 separated from you by the thousands of miles
 of the Pacific Ocean, you are not forgotten,
 and that what you have done, and what you
 are  doing  in the  defense  of freedom,  is
 prominently in our #heczg#t@ and our hearts.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. GEORGE A. SMATHERS
 OF FLORIDA
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Thursday, June 24, 1 965
 Mr. SMATHERS.  Mr. President, as
 President Johnson recently said on na-
 tionwide  television,                                                  the  genius  and
 strength of America rest largely with
 our freedom to debate and criticize our
 national policies.
 Certainly, no thinking American wants
 to curb that freedom of discussion. By
 the same token, however, no American
 wants this precious liberty to damage
 the many other freedoms for which the
 United States stands.
 Unfortunately, I feel that the loud
 and, in far too many cases, uninformed
 criticisms of America's commitment in
 Vietnam have, indeed, damaged the
 cause Of world freedom.
 Max Freedman, in an article entitled
 "The Progression in Vietnam Debate,"
 which was published in the June 23 is-
 sue of the Washington Star, made this
 point quite clear.
 Mr. Freedman noted that President
 Johnson has made every effort within
 reason to find a peaceful settlement In
 Vietnam.
 The President has tried to meet every
 legitimate request.  First, there was the
 demand for negotiations. The President
 eloquently appealed for negotiations,
 with his offer of unconditional discus-
 sions.                                                                                                                           The Communists turned a deaf
 ear.
 Next came the demand to halt the
 bombing.  The President ordered this
 pause. Again, the Communists refused
 to help find a way to peace.
 Now there is the demand for negoti-
 ations with. the Vietcong.
 Criticism is essential to our democracy.
 But, in this case, such criticism seems
 to be strengthening the Communists'
 determination to control all of southeast
 Asia.
 Mr. Freedman pointed out this danger :
 Over the weekend President Ho Chi Minh,
 of North Vietnam, was quoted as saying that
 the Communist military effort Is receiving
 encouragement from the  criticisms heard
 inside the United States.
 I strongly support President Johnson's
 leadership of the free world.
 Communism knows one language; that
 is the language of strength and determi-
 nation.  The United  States has the
 strength.  President Johnson has dis-
 played the determination.
 I recommend that the entire Freed-
 man article be read. At this time I re-
 quest consent that it be printed in the
 Appendix of the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 THE PROGRESSION IN VIETNAM DEBATE
 (By Max Freedman)
 In the White House they are drawing up
 an interesting list of the various stages that
 have marked the public debate on Vietnam.
 First there was the demand for negotia-
 tions.                                                                                                                           This demand died away when the
 President went to Baltimore and made his
 offer of unconditional discussions.
 Then there was the campaign for a pause
 in the bombing.  When President Johnson
 ordered this pause and nothing happened to
 bring  the Communists to  the  conference
 table, the agitation became far less vehement.
 Now there is a demand for direct negotia-
 tions with the Vietcong.  The White House
 is struck by the progression of these de-
 mands.                                                                                                                           The argument moves from a simple
 request for  negotiations, to  a  campaign
 against bombing raids on North Vietnam, to
 a demand for a negotiated settlement based
 on direct talks with the Communist guerrilla
 forces in South Vietnam. Always the pres-
 sure is on the United States to make the first
 concessions to the Communists.
 In pointing to these facts, White House
 officials make no criticism of the group of
 Democratic Senators who have become the
 public opponents of U.S. policies in Vietnam.
 The President himself has acknowledged that
 these Senators have both "the right and the
 duty" to express their convictions on such a
 major aspect of U.S. policy.  Officials in the
 White House are not opposed to criticism.
 They are  wondering  instead whether  the
 critics are sufficiently aware of the uses to
 which their protests have been put by the
 Communist side.
 Instead   of  persuading the   Communists
 that the time had come to seek a negotiated
 settlement, these American criticisms have
 had the opposite effect. They have hardened
 the Communist military campaign, led them
 to hope that the United States may yet be-
 come  grievously  divided,  and pushed the

 depend on his being a spokesman for the

 INTERNATIONAL PAPER CO.,
 New York.
 International Paper Co. has been an in-
 dustrial citizen of the Mobile area since 1928
 and the headquarters of our Southern Kraft
 Division has been located there since 1930.
 We have very deep roots in this enterpris-
 ing, fast-moving community.  Mobile has
 been home to several thousand of our em-
 ployees and to many of us from other parts
 of the company.  Mobile also has been a
 gracious  host  on the  frequent  occasions
 when we have visited there.
 But much more important to our company
 has been the economic and business climate
 that has been fostered in Mobile by the
 public spirited. businessmen and community
 leaders who set the tone for the city, Mobile
 welcomes growth;  it welcomes innovation
 and expansion; it looks to the future.
 To a large extent, this sound, business-
 oriented background has encouraged us to
 invest more than $67 million in expansion
 and development of our Mobile operations
 since 1954.  One of the most important sin-
 gle aspects of our operations in Mobile has
 been the establishment and growth of our
 Erling Riis Research Laboratory.  Named for
 the former head of our southern operations
 and a longtime Mobile resident, this lab-
 oratory is one of the outstanding pulp and
 paper research organizations in the coun-

 We look forward to our future associations
 with your progressive, alert community. The
 combination of a growing complex of mod-
 ern industry and a stable, hard-working,
 cordial  populace,  makes  Mobile  almost
 unique of all the cities in the Gulf South
 region.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. JACK EDWARDS
 OF ALABAMA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, June 24, 1965
 Mr. EDWARDS  of  Alabama.  Mr.
 Speaker, industrial expansion in Mobile
 and other parts of southern Alabama is
 continuing at a rapid pace.  Leaders of
 industry have on many occasions indi-
 cated their successful experience with
 growth operations in our area.
 As examples I call attention to the two
 following statements:
 LOUISVILLE & NASHVILLE RAILROAD,
 Louisville, Ky.
 The Louisville & Nashville Railroad is proud
 of its past association with the development
 of the city of Mobile and is confident of fu-
 ture progress in which we expect to partici-
 pate.
 The location?of Mobile provides a fortu-
 nate environment and a sunny industrial
 climate for the import and export of many
 commodities,.  As Alabama's only port, Mo-
 bile offers a growing operation that already
 ranks among the top 10 ports of the Nation.
 This  status   has  been  achieved  largely
 through efforts of the Alabama State docks
 organization, which has provided facilities
 for convenient and economical transfer of
 ,goods from ship lines through an extensive
 rail distribution system to all parts of the
 United States.
 The L. & N. contributed.to the establish-
 ment of the State docks by deeding a sub-
 stantial block 'of its property to the State
 early in 1926.
 This railroad has also cooperated with the
 Alabama Development Association, the Mo-
 iz1le.Area:,Qham ci S1  ODmmerce and?civic
 leaders in promoting development for indus-
 trial use of 7,400 acres near Mobile.   -
 Establishment of competitive freight rates
 has further encouraged industrial expan-
 sion at Mobile.  Tangible results of these ef-
 forts include a recent expansion of Interna-
 tional Paper Co.'s Mobile operation and the
 establishment by the Scott Paper Co., in co-
 operation with the L, & N? of a warehouse

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. LINDLEY BECKWORTH
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, June 24, 1965
 Mr. BECKWORTH.  Mr. Speaker, for
 a long time I have been interested in the
 extent to which the older people of our
 Nation have opportunities to be employed
 by the Federal Government.  I have
 feared that it is entirely too difficult for
 an older person to get work with the
 Federal Government. I desire to include
 in the RECORD a letter which was written
 to me.June 8, 1965, by Chairman John
 W,,, Macy.  Chairman Macy has sent to
 me some very informative figures. I ask
 to include these figures in the CONGRES-
 SIONAL RECORD.
 U.S. CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION,
 Washington, D.C., June 8, 1965.
 Hon. LINDLEY BECKWORTH,
 Chairman, Subcommittee on Civil Service,
 Committee on Post Office and Civil Serv-
 ice, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  MR.   BECKWORTH:  This  letter  is  in
 reply to your Inquiry of April 16, 1965, ask-
 ing for information that might serve to up-
 date your subcommittee on developments in
 ApprovedFor Release 2003/10/15 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000300180020-8

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- APPENDIX          June 24, 1965
 the program to insure there Is no discrimina-
 tion against older persons in connection with
 Federal
 employment.
 There has been no indication of need for a
 special drive in this area of placement of
 people and none has been undertaken. The
 reports received in our Bureau of Inspections
 have not shown any cause for concern.  So
 far as we have any reason to believe the
 selection of older people from our registers
 is in reasonable relationship to the number
 ,who apply and are qualified.  The GommLs-
 sion, however, is staying alert to any, changes.
 We have In process a study of the Federal
 employee population by age which should
 shed further light on the overall situation.
 We expect to have the report by early sum-
 mer and will send you a copy as soon as it is
 available.
 One enclosure. is the statistical material we
 prepared last year and submitted to the edi-
 tors of the 1964 annual report of the Presi-
 (                                                             nt's Council on Aging which was issued
 under the title "Action for Older Americans,"
 The ;waterial which we submitted was more
 comprehensive than the editors found oc-
 casion to use, It may be of interest to you.
 Last year the Commission sponsored a bill
 11 to require mandatory retirement at age 70
 after 5 years of service rather than after
 15.  Employment beyond 70 could still con-
 tinue but on a. year-to-year basis.  We felt
 that such a measure would encourage agen-
 cies to appoint more people of really ad-
 vanced years so far as normal employment
 prospects are concerned.  The bill was re-
 introduced this year as H.R. 442.  A copy of
 our report on it is enclosed.
 Another enclosure of possible interest to
 you in connection with age and employ-
 ment is a reprint of an early retirement sur-
 vey from our Civil Service Journal, "Thirty-
 eight Years Is aPIenty."
 Finally, it is my understanding that some
 of the agencies in the excepted service have
 elected to follow the same "no age limit"
 employment policy now required of all in
 the competitive  service.   The  Bureau  of
 Medicine and Surgery of the Veterans' Ad-
 ministration is one of these.
 I hope that this survey of developments
 will prove helpful to your subcommittee.
 Sincerely yours,
 JOHN W. MACY, Jr.,
 Chairman.

 bases is so large, that the removal of
 this  market,  through  conversion  of
 burners on these bases to natural gas,
 would clearly make it uneconomic for
 the mines to continue to operate.
 Officials of the Department of Defense
 had   carefully` and  single  mindedly
 studied this conversion proposal.   In
 fact, it is precisely because the consid-
 eration was  so  single  minded                         that
 greater and more important considera-
 tions than the estimated $1 million a
 year saving, which would, ostensibly, be
 realized from conversion by the Federal
 'Government, have been completely over-
 looked or have been given too little con-
 sideration.
 Even if the presumed saving could
 have been realized-and I have serious
 doubts about that, the mischief which
 would be done by conversion would far
 outweigh, in the national interest, any
 economy which might result.  There
 comes a time, I believe, when we should,
 in effect, stand back and ask ourselves
 just what it is that we are attempting
 to defend by means of our defense ef-
 forts. If it is not a sound economy, with
 successful operating industries, gainfully
 employed workers, with the families of
 these breadwinners living in security,
 and the generation of all the beneficial
 side effects for the economy which such
 activities produce, what is it we seek to
 defend?.
 ,Without its coal mines, the Matanuska
 Valley would have become an economi-
 cally blighted area-a little Appalachia
 in the heart of the 49th State, where, not
 decay and retrogression, but growth and
 hope should be, and have in general been,
 the watchwords.
 Conversion by the military to natural
 gas would have resulted immediately in
 the unemployment of about 125 men who
 mine and handle coal which goes to Fort
 Richardson and Elmendorf Air Force
 Base. These men are in most cases long-
 time residents of Alaska.  They have
 families. It is not overstating the case to
 say that in the. area of the mines there
 is nothing else to provide the kind of
 economic activity which would permit
 these men and their dependents to con-
 tinue to live there. Thus, the making. of
 the appropriation for conversion sought
 by the Defense Department would have
 destroyed an industry and would have
 wrecked the economy of an important
 section of Alaska.
 It is my belief that conversion in the
 Anchorage area would, in the natural
 course of events, be followed by similar
 conversion north of the range at the
 Fairbanks area bases, so that it would be
 only a, matter of time until Alaska's coal
 mining industry would be wiped out en-
 tirely.
 In short, the cost of conversion, $1,-
 560,000, would not only be a waste of the
 taxpayers' dollars, but would also lay the
 foundation, for a continued annually
 greater cost of_ operation of these mili-
 tary bases which the same, taxpayers
 would be compelled to pay in perpetuity.
 Wht.?wo ate, dealing with, here, Mr.
 President, is . not only, a few columns of
 figures. . What We are dealing with is
 also the destiny of, human beings.  In
 addition- to thy direct effects which I,
 have been discussing, there would be
 many incidental and, related results, all
 of them destructive and unfortunate.
 The Alaska Railroad, owned by the Fed-
 eral Government, now moves, the coal
 from the mines at Palmer, Eska, and
 Jonesville to the bases.  This transpor-
 tation activity makes possible a quality
 and frequency of railroad service and a
 level of rates on commodities other than
 coal which Ithe people of Alaska-al-
 though they often grumble about them-
 have managed to tolerate.  Removal of
 the coal-transportation activity would
 hurt the railroad and also would hurt
 the people of Alaska who depend upon
 its rates and services.  An alternative,
 which I hardly think the Bureau of the
 Budget or the Congress would look upon
 with great favor, would be to subsidize
 the operation of this Government-owned
 railroad, in order to make up for the
 losses of traffic.  This would, indeed, be
 robbing Peter to pay Paul.
 The computations, on which the sup-
 posed saving to the Federal Government
 from conversion were based, relied on a
 price of gas of 29 cents a thousand cubic
 feet delivered to the Defense Depart-
 ment. No other purchaser, wholesale or
 retail in Alaska, has up to this time, ever
 been able to enjoy a gas price that rea-
 sonable. There is reason to believe that
 a realistic price would be about 10 cents
 higher, or 39 cents a thousand cubic feet.
 At such a price-which I am fearful the
 gas supplier would have to move to, in
 years ahead, in order to remain solvent,
 there would be no saving at all to Uncle
 Sam from conversion. In fact, the fuel
 cost would be higher than the cost of coal
 has been in the past 2 years.  In addi-
 tion, of course, we would have gone to all
 of the expense and trouble of converting.
 Let us consider what the situation
 would be after conversion to natural gas
 at these bases. It is fairly well conceded
 that in that area petroleum fuels are
 not competitive.  With the coal mines
 out of business, their plants dismantled,
 and their employees dispersed, natural
 gas would be the fuel in the area.  Not
 only the defense bases, but also the pri-
 vate consumers, would be wholly depend-
 ent on it, alone. All would have to pay
 whatever price was demanded. It should
 be understood that there is no free play
 of competition in connection with this
 matter.  The pipeline company, which
 has quoted a gas price to the Defense De-
 partment, is the only supplier now in a
 position, or likely to be in a position in
 the foreseeable future, to deal with the
 Government, With coal out. of the pic-
 ture, this natural gas monopoly would
 completely rule the situation.
 I applaud the action of the Armed
 Services Committee; and I hope this
 false,  alleged  economy will now be
 dropped, not only for the fiscal year
 ahead, but also for the future.
 "FAIR FIGHTS AND FOUL"-BOOK
 BY JUDGE THURMAN ARNOLD
 Mr.     McGEE.  Mr. President,  some
 years ago "a "lucky lawyer" came out of
 my State, and, after serving for a time as
 a professor of law at Yale, gravitated to
 Washington,, to serve as Assistant Attor-
 14169
 ney General in charge of the Antitrust
 Division of the Department of Justice.
 Later, he sat on the U.S. Court of Ap-
 peals, and also founded a significant law
 firm here in our ,Nation's Capital.
 Judge Thurman Arnold has written of
 his life-the "life of a lucky lawyer," as
 he calls it-in a book, just released, en-
 titled "Fair Fights and Foul." An excel-
 lent review of the book by a fellow at-
 torney, James Rowe, is published in to-
 day's issue of the Washington Post, along
 with an article based on a recent inter-
 view by Morton Mintz.  The interview
 makes the point that Judge Arnold is still
 quite willing to "light matches in powder
 mills." I ask unanimous consent that the
 book review and an article from the
 Washington Post be printed. in  the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the review
 and the article were ordered to be printed
 in the RECORD, as follows:
 [From the Washington Post, June 24, 1965]
 THURMAN ARNOLD RIDES AGAIN RELIVING
 .SPECTACULAR PAST
 (Reviewed by James Rowe)
 "Fair       Fights  and  Foul,"  by  Thurman
 Arnold, Harcourt, Brace & World, 292 pages,
 $5.95.
 Once upon a time, around 1940, there was
 an iconoclastic Yale law professor who, when
 sent to Washington, turned into a fearsome
 dragon.  Even today any big businessman
 over 50 shivers and trembles in his' boots at
 the magic phrase "Thurman Arnold."  But
 the dragon has mellowed since he was the
 greatest trustbuster of them all, not even
 excluding his own two great trustbusting
 heroes, Teddy and Franklin Roosevelt.
 So he has written a mellow book.  It is as
 always  sardonic,  witty,  anecdotal and  it
 shines with a literary polish.  All this one
 could expect from the author of the "Folk-
 lore of Capitalism," a brilliant pyrotechnic
 display which burst like the 4th of July
 over the legal firmament two decades ago.
 The difference is that his new book has an
 increased urbanity.  No longer is Arnold in-
 dulging in scintillating advocacy for one of
 his varied causes.   Today he is indulging
 in a review of his attitudes and beliefs.  He
 is looking back and pointing out with a
 modesty  somewhat    striking  in     Thurman
 Arnold how right he was on the various fields
 of battle.  And incredibly, it does seem he
 was always right.
 There is too little of the unforgettable
 man, the personality, color and excitement
 of Thurman Arnold in this book, except for
 his youth in Wyoming, Princeton, and Har-
 vard Law School, and law practice in Wyo-
 ming.  After a few years of teaching at Yale
 Law School, of which he still has a rather
 high opinion, Arnold took on a variety of
 legal tasks in Washington.
 Then Roosevelt appointed him Assistant
 Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust
 Division  of  the  Department  of  Justice.
 Those, as he says, were the great days; when
 he led possibly the single most talented staff
 of lawyers ever seen in Washington.  In 4
 years he brought more prosecutions for vio-
 lation of the antitrust law than had taken
 place during the preceding 50 years.   He
 insists nevertheless that the antitrust law
 is more important as a symbol of an Ameri-.
 can belief than it is in practice.
 ` Still this is not simply a book on antitrust
 law.  Arnold has opinions on everything, in-
 cluding working for the Government (which
 he liked), the Civil Service (which he would
 abolish because it is inefficient), the Federal
 court of appeals (on which he sat briefly but
 left because he knew he was by temperament
 an advocate and not an impartial judge).

 He discourses on balanced.budgets, Keynes-
 ian  economics,  the  printing  of  money,
 and fiscal policy, the New Deal and the Great
 Society, which pleases him greatly.
 He expounds a fascinating theory that
 Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson were
 the William McChesney Martins of their day
 and Alexander Hamilton the Leon Keyserling.
 It may be true but, as he has said in other
 connections, it will take generations before
 this theory becomes general belief.
 For many years the author has been in
 Washington private practice.   Although he
 discourses happily about law firms and law
 schools, the book spends no time on the cases
 which have made him a successful corporate
 lawyer.   He  prefers  his  "public"  cases-
 Esquire, Playboy, and obscenity, the Latti-
 more case, and the Bailey and Peters cases.
 He does not refrain from paying his due
 respects to the memory of Senator Joseph
 McCarthy and to timorous Government ex-
 ecutives.
 Be :tells about his rescue of poet Ezra
 Pound from St. Elizabeths and from trial for
 treason.
 It would have been fun if he had put more
 of himself, rather than his ideas, into the
 telling.  But the ideas and the causes are
 fascinating and interesting enough for every-
 one, not only the lawyer but also the histo-
 rian, the sociologist, psychologist, and even
 the general reader.
 It is quite clear that this dragon lived
 happily ever after.
 STILL ICONOCLASTIC JUDGE ARNOLD CALLS CIVIL
 SERVICE A HANDICAP
 (By Morton Mintz)
 After Thurman W. Arnold took over the
 Justice Department's Antitrust Division dur-
 ing the New Deal, he says in his new book,
 "indictments of respectable people began to
 pour out.
 He prosecuted oil firms, General Electric
 the American Medical Association, the Asso-
 ciated Press.
 "Cries of outrage could be heard from coast
 to coast," Arnold writes in "Fair Fights and
 Foul," which Harcourt, Brace & World is
 publishing today.
 "I was pictured as a wild man whose sanity
 was in considerable doubt.  One major news-
 paper referred to me as 'an idiot in a powder
 mill'.,,
 Arnold is now 74, founding (and active)
 partner in the influential law firm of Arnold,
 Fortas & Porter and basking in prestige.
 He is addressed by many as "judge," having
 served on the U.S. court of appeals here.
 But the willingness to light matches in
 powder mills-for what Arnold deems good
 and  sufficient  reason-is  still  there.  It
 burned brightly in an interview the other
 day.
 There is, he said, "no justification any
 more" for the civil service. This brought a
 lighted match closer to the powder than does
 his book, in which he is content to call it
 "a serious handicap to Government effi-
 ciency."
 SURVIVES AS A SYMBOL
 Interview or book, his objections are the
 same.  Civil service, he says, survives "as a
 symbol of the Government's fairness to its
 employees." But, he writes in "Fair Fights,"
 the symbol has little relation to reality:
 Civil service affords practically no protec-
 tion in the tenure of Government service.
 The head of a department, if he is con-
 scientious, can always get rid of an em-
 ployee by the process of a reorganization that
 abolishes his job.
 "If he is not conscientious, he can file a
 list of charges against an employee, listen to
 the employee's defense In an absentminded
 way, and then fire him.
 "The employee can appeal to the courts,
 if  he  wants  to  spend  his  money use-
 lessly * * * I have undertaken cases of dis-
 charged employees where I was convinced
 that the evidence of bias was clear and con-
 vincing.                                                                      I lost them all.
 "On the other side of the ledger, civil serv-
 ice puts a handicap on the official's judg-
 ment in selecting his staff * * *
 "If  corporate  management  had  to  go
 through this process of subjecting the per-
 sonnel and salaries of its staff to some higher
 authority, even the ordinary citizen unversed
 in the mysteries of corporate operation would
 be able to detect that it was nonsense.
 "But any kind of restriction on Govern-
 ment management would be regarded by the
 same citizen as a necessary and wholesome
 restriction  in  the  interests  of preventing
 Government executives from ruining their
 own departments by the free exercise of their
 feeble personal judgments."
 SACROSANCT POSITION
 "Thus the civil service has acquired an
 impregnable position in the mind of the pub-
 lic as a symbol of respectability and decorum
 in the conduct of Government affairs.  Any-
 one who doubts it is apt to be charged with
 being contumacious toward holy men."
 Here, from the interview, are other matches
 carried by Arnold to other powder mills:
 Little that was taught at Princeton when
 Arnold was a student there was relevant to
 the development of the social institutions of
 the outside world. But faculty members and
 students in today's teach-ins, seemingly so
 relatedto the outside world, are, if anything,
 even  more  detached  from  the  realities.
 Arnold, it should    be noted, believes that
 President Johnson will prove to be "one of
 the greatest Presidents we have ever known."
 Like private industry, Government needs
 some "cleansing process" to get rid of its
 incompetent managers.  Many of them got
 where they are because good men, finding
 that a Government career is not considered
 "a career of honor" by the people, get out.
 The  people  thus  have  a self-fulfilling
 prophecy.
 "Big business is very inefficient, but is
 judged by its best examples.  Government is
 very efficient in some things-look at the
 moonshot-but            is  judged  by  its  worst
 examples."
 Regulatory agencies become "captives of
 the people they regulate." The regulators
 are beset "by the pressures of wanting to
 be liked by the people they regulate" and
 from whom they may later seek employment.
 So what they do is to turn to "harass-
 ment" of the small, rather than the regula-
 tion of the big.
 Arnold would have liked to title his book
 "Life of a Lucky Lawyer," but his publisher
 talked him out of it.
 He regrets that he dealt with the late Sen-
 ator Estes Kefauver in the book solely in the
 unfavorable context of his crime investiga-
 tion.                                                                     In other respects, such as Kefauver's
 leadership of the Senate Antitrust Subcom-
 mittee, Arnold considers him "a great man,"
 and wishes he had said so.
 Finally, he wishes his manuscript dead-
 line had not prevented him from saying more
 in praise of the performance of President
 Johnson.
 Pb             c  e,
 VI    AM DIALOG
 Mr. McGEE.  Mr.  President,  the
 Washington Star of June 23, in com-
 menting on C.B.S.  television,' Monday
 night, upon the debate between propo-
 nents and opponents of the administra-
 tion's Vietnam policy, makes the point
 that the university professors opposed to
 the presentcourse of events have offered
 us nothing which could rationally be de-
 scribed as an alternative.
 The editorial also points up the effec-
 tive and articulate affirmation of our
 Government's mission by the President's
 assistant, McGeorge Bundy, whose ap-
 pearance served, as the editorial put it,
 "a useful purpose."  The same could be
 said, I may add, for those on the other
 side. I ask unanimous consent that the
 editorial from the Washington Star be
 printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 VIETNAM DIALOG
 The "Vietnam dialog" presented by CBS
 Monday night obviously did not convert any
 of  the  professors  to  the  administration's
 point of view.  Nevertheless, the show served
 a useful purpose.
 It demonstrated, for one thing, that Mc-
 George Bundy is indeed a formidable oppo-
 nent on the debating platform.  He was more
 than a match for the representatives of the
 "academic community," singly or collectively.
 And the President's aid was especially effec-
 tive in carving up Prof. Hans Morgenthau,
 who Is generally thought of as the guiding
 spirit of the academic critics of our policy in
 Vietnam.
 More importantly,  it demonstrated that
 you can't beat something with nothing.  In
 this  instance, Bundy's something was a
 clearly articulated definition of the admin-
 istration's policy and program.  The policy
 has not yet achieved the desired result. But
 we may know more about its usefulness 6
 months from now, and in any event It con-
 stitutes a tangible, affirmative course of ac-
 tion which can be stated In terms that are
 understandable.
 The great weakness of the position of the
 other side was that it offered nothing which
 could rationally be described as an alterna-
 tive.
 Mr. Morgenthau said he is "opposed to our
 present policy in Vietnam on moral, military,
 political and general intellectual grounds"-
 an  interesting rhetorical  exercise,  but  it
 means little or nothing.  He also mentioned
 five alternatives to our present policy, and
 said he favored the fifth. What is it?  "I
 think our aim must be to get out of Viet-
 nam," he said, "but to get out of it with
 honor."  This is an alternative? President
 Johnson has said essentially the same thing
 on half a dozen occasions.
 One thing more.  Mr. Morgenthau seemed
 to take as his model the French withdrawal
 from Algeria and Vietnam.  He failed to men-
 tion that in each case the French were wag-
 ing a purely colonial war, which is quite a
 different thing from honoring treaty commit-
 ments for the sole purpose of helping South
 Vietnam maintain its independence in the
 face of plain aggression by the Communists.
 FE-      1,441 -
 THE PROGRESSION IN
 VIETNAM DEBATE
 Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, as one
 who has taken his stand early and
 firmly in support of the administration's
 policies in Vietnam, I have always wel-
 comed debate on the subject, particu-
 larly with my colleagues here in the
 Senate who may disagree, at least on
 certain points of policy. Such debate is
 needed, especially in major policy areas.
 Nonetheless,  Mr.  President,  Max
 Freedman, writing in Wednesday's
 Washington Star, has called attention
 to the uses to which our adversaries
 have put some statements of disagree-
 ment.  His article is worthy of note by
 the Members of this body. Therefore,
 I ask unanimous consent that the article
 be printed in the RECORD.

 FTHE VIETNAM IMBROGLIO
 Mr. CHURCH.          Madam President, on
 February 17, I spoke in this Chamber to
 urge a negotiated settlement of the war
 in Vietnam.  At that time, negotiation
 was a dirty word in Washington; since
 that time, I am gratified that a negoti-
 ated peace has been expressly made the
 object of American policy in southeast
 Asia.
 In view of the expanding nature of our
 military involvement in South Vietnam,
 it is difficult to see how the Vietcong can
 expect to score a conclusive military de-
 cision. On the other hand, any quest on
 our part for a durable victory on the bat-
 tlefield is equally dubious. Senator FUL-
 BRIGHT,  the distinguished chairman of
 the Foreign Relations Committee, wisely
 summed up the matter last week, in
 these words:
 It is clear to all reasonable Americans that
 a  complete  military  victory  in  Vietnam,
 though theoretically attainable, can in fact
 be attained only at a cost far exceeding our
 interest and our honor.
 With this statement, I am in full agree-
 ment. It obviously serves the American
 interest to reach a political settlement
 in Vietnam, whenever this can be ac-
 complished on acceptable terms, and in
 a manner consistent with the commit-
 ments we have given to the Saigon gov-
 ernment.
 Now that this objective has become our
 avowed goal, there is a very real need for
 us to discuss, here in the Senate, in this
 historic forum of free and open debate,
 not only the direction of our policy, but
 new steps that might be taken in pur-
 suit of a negotiated peace.  To remain
 silent, when the prospect of a widening
 war confronts us, would be to shirk our
 duty; worse still, it would be to behave
 like a mock parliament of a totalitarian
 state.
 Let me make my own position plain.
 In the past, beginning more than a year
 ago, I have publicly criticized American
 policy in Asia.  But, in his handling of
 our predicament in Vietnam, I have not
 criticized the President.  I realize that
 Lyndon Johnson is in the position of a

 in the RECORD an excerpt from the report
 (No. 364), explaining the purposes of
 the bill.
 There being no objection, the excerpt
 Was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 PURPOSE OF THE BILI.
 The purpose of this legislation is to change
 the term of office of Commissioners of the
 Federal Maritime Commission from 4 years
 to 5 years and to provide that a Commis-
 sioner whose term has expired will  serve
 until his successor has been nominated and
 approved with the advice and consent of
 the Senate.
 GENERAL STATEMENT
 Under the present law the Federal Mari-
 time Commission is composed of five mem-
 bers, each appointed for a 4-year term.
 Therefore, the terms of two Commissioners
 expire simultaneously.  This situation could
 create a serious problem by preventing the
 continuity of service which is essential in any
 regulatory  commission.   The  legislation
 would have no effect on the 4-year terms of
 Commissioners presently serving.         -
 The. problem of a possible lack of continu-
 ity could be seriously aggravated under the
 present law by the absence of any provision
 which authorizes Commissioners to continue
 to serve until their successor has been nomi-
 nated and approved by the Senate.   This
 standard provision is found in the basic law
 establishing the terms of Commissioners on
 other regulatory agencies.  This bill would
 extend that provision to appointments made
 to the Federal Maritime, Commission.
 This aspect of the problem is particularly
 acute at the present time because the terms
 of office of the Chairman and of another
 member of the Federal Maritime Commission
 expire on July 1 of this year.  If these offices
 are not filled under the present law by that
 date, no action could be taken by the remain-
 ing three Commissioners except by unani-
 mous consent until the vacancies are filled.
 This undesirable,sitlation could be avoided
 by prompt enactment of the bill.

 that we seek no wider, war, but in the
 face  of mounting Vietcong pressure
 against the embattled Saigon govern-
 ment, the President has also emphasized
 that "we do not plan to come running
 home and abandon this little nation, or
 tear up our commitments, or go back on
 our word."
 I fully support the President in this
 position.  I have consistently backed
 him in the stepped-up military action
 he has ordered, including the bombing
 of  supply  routes  in  North  Vietnam.
 These    bombings,  together   with  the
 American troop movements into South
 Vietnam presently taking place, should
 make it abundantly clear that the vast
 resources of the United States are now
 fully arrayed behind Saigon.
 THE STUBBORN WAR
 Within the past few weeks, American
 military strength in South Vietnam has
 doubled; at the present rate of input, it
 will double, again before the end of the
 year.  Our bombing of the north, once
 sporadic, has become systematic.  The
 mission of our combat troops, once con-
 fined to sentinel duty at a few air bases,
 steadily expands toward a general Amer-
 ican engagement in the war.  We have
 too much muscle power to be driven
 out.  We are capable of occupying and
 holding South Vietnam with our own
 military might. Hanoi cannot possibly
 defeat the United States.
 Yet the war goes on.
 Last April, in his notable peace-seek-
 ing address at Johns, Hopkins, President
 Johnson threw open the door to the con-
 ference table by announcing his readi-
 ness to commence "unconditional dis-
 cussions with the governments con-
 cerned."  He declared that "the only
 path for reasonable men is the path of
 peaceful settlement."  The terms he of-
 fered were anything but onerous.
 He said:
 Such peace demands an independent South
 Vietnam-securely guaranteed and able to
 shape its own relationships to all others, free
 from outside interference, tied to no alliance,
 a military base for no other country.
 By the standards of past wars, these
 are unusually generous terms.  North
 Vietnam would escape unpunished for
 her aggression.  An independent, non-
 alined South Vietnam would pose no
 threat to Hanoi. Moreover, such a set-
 tlement would bring about the orderly
 withdrawal of American troops from
 southeast Asia, for which the Commu-
 nists have long and loudly campaigned.
 Yet the war goes on.
 This obstinate Communist refusal to
 end the shooting is all the more vexatious
 in face of Johnson's indicated readiness
 to contribute a billion dollars, once peace
 is restored, toward an international co-
 operative effort to develop the mighty
 Mekong River.  The great rewards of
 such an enterprise-including electric
 power-could be fully shared by North
 Vietnam, as well as South Vietnam, Laos,
 and Cambodia.  The President has made
 clear:
 We would hope that North Vietnam would
 take its place In the common effort just as
 soon as peaceful cooperation is possible.
 Obviously, the words of pe-tee cannot
 begin in earnest until the wastes of war
 have ended.
 Yet the war goes on.
 Two explanations, both of which de-
 serve careful assessment, suggest them-
 selves: First, Hanoi still anticipates vic-
 tory on her own terms, despite Saigon's
 success in securing the United States as
 a fighting partner; and, second, Peiping
 presses for a prolonged war as the best
 device available for advancing China's
 larger ambitions in Asia.
 THE VIEW FROM -HANOI
 If Hanoi's intransigence is rooted to
 the belief that the Vietcong will even-
 tually prevail, what accounts for it? The
 answer given widest favor in this country
 is that Ho Chi Minh feels that we will
 grow weary of the war, and that Amer-
 ican public opinion will then force us to
 pull out. Accordingly, homefront critics
 of our Vietnamese policy are admonished
 that their complaints will be interpreted
 in Hanoi as proof of our waning resolu-
 tion.  Students and faculty on our cam-
 puses, protesting the deepening American
 involvement in an Asian war, are scolded
 for giving false hopes to the enemy.
 Presumably, nothing less than total con-
 formity of opinion throughout the United
 States will suffice to persuade Ho Chi
 Minh that our country will not soon
 abandon the Saigon government.
 Undoubtedly, the college "teach-ins,"
 the protest rallies, and the occasional
 picket lines demanding our withdrawal,
 are sources of encouragement for Hanoi.
 But since when have free people not be-
 haved this way? Only dictatorships stifle
 dissent.  As long as Americans stay free,
 differences of opinion, on foreign as well
 as domestic issues, will continue to be
 vigorously and openly expressed.  Any
 American foreign policy which depends,
 for success, upon a monolithic accept-
 ance at home is foreordained to failure.
 However, this argument, so well de-
 signed to dampen homefront opposition,
 is much too convenient to be very con-
 vincing. Hanoi is surely aware that the
 United States has yet to quit a fight. In
 two World Wars, we settled for nothing
 less than unconditional surrender; in the
 Korean war, we fought on against the\
 onslaught of Red China until all of South
 Korea was resecured.  Never have we
 shown a lack of staying power under fire.
 Besides, the President himself has
 made it unquestionably clear that the
 United States will "stay the course" in
 Vietnam.  His words are as irreversible
 as his deeds:                      -
 We will not be defeated.  We will not grow
 tired.  We will not withdraw, either openly
 or under the cloak of a meaningless agree-
 ment.                                                                          -
 His pledge is sealed with American
 blood already drawn.      The whole world
 bears him witness.
 Congress has also made its position
 apparent.  By nearly unanimous votes,
 the members of both parties have given
 unmistakable evidence of their willing-
 ness to supply whatever money the war
 may require. Our annual outlay, which
 until recent years was $200 million, has
 risen to $2 billion.  If the burden were
 to again increase 10-fold, it is evident
 that Congress would readily vote the
 funds.                             -
 Indeed, the case is so lopsided that it
 should be plain by now, even to the most
 indoctrinated Communist, that the ex-
 panding military involvement of the
 United States cannot be dismissed as
 some sort ,of death agony, staged to give
 temporary cover to an impending Amer-
 ican withdrawal from southeast Asia.
 It is far, more likely that Ho Chi Minh
 is counting not so much on Washington
 as on Saigon itself to call it quits. And
 with some reason. An endemic instability
 engulfs the city.  One coup follows an-
 other with such frequency that corre-
 spondence with the Government might
 well be addressed: "To Whom It May
 Concern."
 President Johnson cannot unite the
 spoiling factions. A competent and effec-
 tive government in Saigon, capable of
 giving sustained direction to the war,
 can only be established by the Vietnam-
 ese themselves.  They keep failing the
 test; no formula for stability emerges;
 no bonds endure between the Buddhists,
 the Catholics, and the self-seeking mili-
 tary rivals. The political situation seems
 to worsen dayby day.
 Under the `circumstances, it is small
 wonder that public confidence crumbles
 away, or that this erosion should be
 further aggravated by the changing face
 of the war.  For the more the war is
 transformed into an American engage-
 ment on the mainland of Asia, pitting the
 West against the East, white men against
 brown, the more the fighting takes on the
 outer appearance of the former war for
 independence against the French.  In
 the countryside of Vietnam-and those
 who have been there as I have, will read-
 ily testify that this is the case-the level
 of sophistication is very low. Inhabi-
 tants of the rice fields and jungles, where
 the guerrilla war exists, are apt to mark
 an enemy more by the color of his skin
 than the uniform he wears.  As larger
 numbers of Americans move in and take
 over, as the changing complexion of the
 war becomes more evident, Ho Chi Minh
 may well surmise that time plays on his
 side.
 He may anticipate, as the months go
 by, that the incessant propaganda cam-
 paign of the Vietcong is bound to sound
 more plausible and appealing; that the
 Americans have come to reimpose the
 hated imperialism of the past; that the
 generals rotating on the roost in Saigon
 are contemptible puppets; that the peo-
 ple must join together in  one great
 liberation front.
 The continuing war, moreover, may
 bludgeon into the arms of the Vietcong a
 multitude that cannot be beckoned in.
 The guerrilla fighter is ruthless, but he
 kills with cunning, discriminating be-
 tween friend, follower, and foe.  Not so
 with napalm dropped on a native vil-
 lage-it burns blindly and converts ' all
 suffering survivors into foes. An Ameri-
 can veteran of the jungle fighting in
 Vietnam has well observed that the best
 weapon for successfully prosecuting a
 guerrilla war is a knife; the worst, an
 airplane.
 So there are good reasons for Ho Chi
 Minh to play a waiting game. The Viet-
 cong grow stronger.  Saigon staggers un-
 der mounting blows. If a protracted war
 involving increased numbers of Ameri-
 can troops will win the Communists
 added favor among the people, the temp-
 tation to persist is compelling. After all,

 Mao's shrewd- appraisal of the war in
 Indochina, has proved a great misfoor
 tune, It has enabled him to use us, along
 with the Vietnamese, to further his de-
 signs on Asia.
 These designs are well enough known.
 As the giant of Asia, unfettered of her
 colonial bonds, China is determined to
 reclaim her place as the dominant power
 of the mainland. She would redraw old
 boundary lines, dating back to the an-
 cient empire, through the assertion of
 claims which,have nothing to do with
 communism.  For example, less than 3
 years ago, in the border dispute with In-
 dia, Chiang Kai-shek publicly affirmed
 China's right to the territory sought by
 Mao. As with the Soviet Union, the ter-
 ritorial aspirations of Red China spring
 more from national tradition, than from
 the doctrines of Marx or Lepin.
 And, just as the Communist leaders in
 the Kremlin, following the Second World
 War, reimposed the Russian sphere of
 influence over the Balkans, earlier exist-
 ing under the czars, so the Reds in Pei-
 ping, after 1954, have sought to reestab-
 lish  over  Indochina  the  sphere of
 influence so long enjoyed by the Chinese
 emperors. This region, in fact, bears a
 resemblance to the Balkans, consisting
 as it does of small, bordering countries,
 over which China looms like a dragon
 above a handful of lizards,.
 In the natural course of events, we
 cannot hope to deny China her influence
 in southeast Asia, any more than China
 can deny us ours in the Caribbean. The
 best we can do is to slow down the Chi-
 nese penetration, so that the larger of her
 neighbors, countries like India and Pak-
 istan, can gather the strength necessary
 to furnish the mainland of Asia with an
 effective counterpoise to Chinese power.
 Unfortunately, the American involve-
 ment in a protracted war in "the Balkans
 of Asia" works directly against these
 ends. As most Asians are inclined to see
 it, the United States has intervened in a
 war that is primarily a Vietnamese affair,
 regardless of whether the struggle is
 viewed as an insurrection in the south,
 or a covert war by the north against the
 south. Either way, American troops, not
 Chinese, are in the fight;  American
 planes, not Chinese, are doing the bomb-
 ing.  Whatever aid China has given
 Hanoi is outweighed many times over by
 longing the war makes Hanio increas-
 ingly dependent upon China for weapons
 and supplies, compromising her hard-
 won independence., Within the Commu-
 nist camp, the continuing war can be
 pointed to by China as proof that the
 Russian argument, for peaceful coexist-
 ence with the West is absurd, while with-
 in China itself, the daily tongue lashings
 administered to the "American devils in
 Vietnam" furnish .,,,the  ed government
 with a convenient whipping post around
 which to rally the people to greater en-
 deavor at home.
 THE. SEARCH FOR  A SOLUTION
 Much as we need a solution, it will not
 be found in retreat. Were we to decide
 to abandon South Vietnam after so
 lavishly committing our prestige there,
 our withdrawal would surely undermine
 confidence in the United States through-
 out the Far East. Other little countries
 which now rely on us, like Thailand,
 Laos, and even Taiwan, would be de-
 moralized. China would profit most from
 the triumph of the Vietcong which would
 soon follow an American decision to give
 up the fight in South Vietnam.
 Therefore; we must remain in the war
 until a basis for its settlement is found.
 But let us concentrate our attention, and
 our military action as well, in South
 Vietnam, where the outcome will be de-
 termined anyhow.
 The war in Vietnam is as much a polit-
 ical struggle as it is a military one. In-
 deed, I think if we looked at it closely we
 would decide to concentrate more work
 in the political and economic areas to
 help meet the threat of the Vietcong.
 As our former Ambassador, Henry Cabot
 Lodge, said during his tour of duty in
 Saigon:
 The  Vietcong campaign is, above all, a
 political affair.  When the Vietcong have had
 enough                       and  decide to stop fighting, they
 simply melt in with the people.  If the peo-
 ple were to deny the Vietcong, they would
 thus have no base; they would be through.
 The essentially political nature of the
 struggle has led American officials who
 know most about the situation to cor-
 rectly observe that the present conflict
 is essentially a South Vietnamese war
 which can only be won by the South
 Vietnamese   themselves.   As  President
 Trannedy said shortly before his death:
 doubtedly, given our heavy dependence
 upon naval and aerial power, we would
 attempt to confine the land war to south-
 east Asia, where Chinese armies would
 soon fill the jungles.  We would strike
 back through the air, observing no sanc-
 tuary, but as long as we used conven-
 tional weapons, we could never subdue
 China through bombing alone.
 By sending five or six combat divisions
 into battle-the balance of our uncom-
 mitted army-we could probably convert
 South Vietnam into an American mili-
 tary outpost.  A stalemate would de-
 velop, and, finally, in order to end the
 attrition, we would negotiate a truce with
 Red China, much as we did in Korea.
 The truce would conform with the reali-
 ties of the situation, leaving us in pos-
 session of  South Vietnam,  and  the
 Communists in occupation and control
 of the rest of Indochina.
 Beyond southeast Asia, on the broad
 global front, the intensified struggle in
 Vietnam could yet lead to a shotgun
 marriage between the feuding titans of
 the Communist world.  The promising
 thaw in our relations with the Soviet
 Union will then give way to a full re-
 sumption of the cold war, with our ad-
 versaries  joined  together  again  in
 common cause.  This may still be a part
 of the price we shall pay for the corner
 into which we have been painted in
 Indochina.
 These, then, are the two horns of our
 dilemma: If we abandon the war in Viet-
 nam, China gains; if we fight it out,
 China also gains. Why should not Mao
 Tse-tung work so feverishly against a
 negotiated settlement?  It is the one
 escape hatch which may still be within
 our reach.
 .Seymour Topping, writing from Saigon
 for the New York Times, confirms this
 analysis by observing that President
 Johnson's offer for unconditional peace
 talks was a blow to Red China.  Topping
 writes :
 Peiping's propaganda denunciation of the
 "negotiations plot" has been almost hyster-
 ical.  Acceptance by Hanoi of this offer would
 mean the strengthening of the positions in
 southeast Asia of Peiping's two chief ad-
 versaries, the United States and the Soviet
 Union.
 THREE PROPOSALS FOR ACTION
 It is, alrg dy very late.  We should
 waste no time on recriminations over

 ident managed to strengthen it some 4
 months ago, by making his still-unac-
 cepted proposal for unconditional peace
 talks. If the Communists are determined
 for the war to last, we can at least keep
 placing the responsibility where it be-
 longs-squarely on their backs.
 Another' argument, often used to cast
 scorn upon any suggested resort to the
 United Nations, is to the effect that oth-
 er countries would send no more than
 token forces anyway, so that the United
 States would still have to bear the brunt
 of what Secretary Rusk has called "a
 mean, dirty war."  That, of course, was
 the case in Korea, but conducting the
 campaign there under the U.N. flag
 proved a great advantage to the United
 States.  The same would hold true in
 Vietnam.
 Until recently, even more curious than
 our failure to turn to the U.N. has been
 the evident disdain we have shown for
 any contact with the Vietcong. Official-
 ly, we cannot extend to the Vietcong the
 autonomous  recognition  they  desire,
 because we see the war as a case
 of indirect aggression by the north
 against the south, and regard the Viet-
 cong-including its many members who
 are residents of the south-as merely the
 agents of Hanoi.
 Nevertheless, there is nothing in our
 theory of the war to preclude Hanoi
 from including representatives of the
 Vietcong in any delegation the Govern-
 ment of North Vietnam may send to the
 conference table. In fact, the inclusion
 would tend to bear out our official view-
 point.  Recognition of this, at long last,
 may account for the slow melt in our
 frozen posture which now appears to
 be taking place. Secretary Rusk has in-
 dicated, in response to recent inquiries,
 that he would not interpose an objection
 if Hanoi chose to include Vietcong
 spokesmen among her representatives. I
 think we should affirmatively declare our
 willingness to deal with the Vietcong on
 this basis. For too long, we have sought
 to exclude them entirely, though they
 are the very combatants opposing us, a
 posture so rigid and unreal as to have
 given a certain currency to the Commu-
 nist charge that we really do not wish to
 negotiate.
 Though the United States cannot deal
 directly with the Vietcong, we ought not
 to oppose peace talks among the Viet-
 namese themselves.  The warring fac-
 tions-Saigon, the Vietcong, and Hanoi-
 should explore the prospects for finding
 a formula to silence the guns, and to
 escape the pincers of the great-power
 squeeze which 'threatens to undermine
 the neutrality and independence coveted
 by all of them.
 Finally, I believe that the time is ripe
 for us to vigorously proclaim the prin-
 ciple of self-determination for the peo-
 ple of South Vietnam.  Whether the
 south should merge with the north under
 the rule of Hanoi, or remain separated
 under a government in Saigon, should be
 decided by popular vote.
 The manner and method of the vote
 would have to be worked out by nego-
 tiations.  The timing would have to
 await a cease-fire and the restoration of
 the requisite internal order.  To insure
 the integrity of the election, we might
 propose its supervision by the U.N.  If
 these arrangements could be made, both
 sides should pledge themselves to abide
 by the results.
 Our belief that Hanoi will never per-
 mit free elections in the north-which
 has often been emphasized as an argu-
 ment against the  proposal-does  not
 justify denying them in the south. We
 have often asserted that the Vietcong is
 a militant minority which seeks to
 forcibly impose its will upon the people
 of South Vietnam. If this is so, the peo-
 ple themselves will furnish the proof in
 a competently conducted election; if it
 is not so, then by what right would we
 deny the country to Ho Chi Minh?
 There are some who ridicule any
 proposal for a popular referendum upon
 the ground that the Communists would
 never agree.  All the more reason, I
 should think, to put them to the test,
 right out in the open, before the eyes of
 the watching world. What better way to
 prove that the Communists are relying
 on bullets, not ballots, to further their
 ambitions?
 Perhaps the war has gone beyond the
 turning point. It may be that Hanoi in-
 tends to continue the fight, regardless of
 what we may now do or propose. The
 conference table may be off in the dis-
 tance, at the end of a long and tragic
 trail of casualties still to be suffered. But
 we cannot know this positively without
 first making the proposals.  If they are
 rejected, we will have lost nothing for
 having tried.  Our interest calls for no
 less than a ceaseless effort to find an
 honorable basis for settling this war.
 After all, thefuture of Asia will not be
 determined in the jungles of Vietnam.
 Peiping knows her real rival is New
 Delhi. Why else did China seek out the
 opportunity to humiliate India in the
 border war of 1962?  If the future of
 freedom in Asia is to be decided in any
 one place, it will be on the Indian sub-
 continent, not in the little Balkan-type
 countries of Indochina, where our ener-
 gies are now being so largely absorbed.
 Freedom, as a matter of fact, is not
 really at issue in South Vietnam, unless
 we so degrade freedom as to confuse it
 with the mere absence of communism.
 Two dictatorial regimes, one sitting in
 Hanoi, the other in Saigon, struggle for
 control of the country. Whichever pre-
 vails, the outcome is not going to settle
 the fate of communism in the world at
 large, nor the problem of guerrilla wars.
 They did not begin in Vietnam and will
 not end there.  They will continue to
 erupt  in scattered,  farfiung  places
 around the globe, wherever adverse con-
 ditions within a country permit Com-
 munist subversion to take root.
 Nor can it be soundly contended that
 the security of the United states requires
 a military decision in South Vietnam.
 Our Presence in the Far East is not an-
 chored there.  Saigon does not stand
 guard over Seattle.  We conquered the
 Pacific Ocean in the Second World War.
 It is our moat, the broadest on earth,
 from the Golden Gate to the very shores
 of China. There is no way for the land-
 locked forces of Asia to drive us from
 the Pacific; there is no need for us to
 past mistakes which may have led us
 into the Vietnam imbroglio. The upper-
 most requirement now is to find a solu-
 tion. How do we bring Hanoi to the con-
 ference table ready to settle on honorable
 terms? The answer, if there is one, must
 lie in the calculated use of the mailed
 fist and the velvet glove.
 Admittedly, the stepped-up American
 military pressure is intended to summon
 Hanoi to the conference table. But this
 alone will not suffice. It is obvious that
 further diplomatic moves are called for.
 I would propose :
 First. That we abandon our unilateral
 posture in Vietnam by soliciting the serv-
 ices of the United Nations in the search
 for a peaceful settlement.
 Second. That we affirm our willingness
 to deal with representatives of the Viet-
 cong, as part of any delegation Hanoi
 may send to the conference table.
 Third. That we advocate genuine self-
 determination for the people of South
 Vietnam, as the basis-for an agreement
 settling the war.
 These proposals should be additional
 to, not substitutes for, the terms of peace
 offered by President Johnson in his laud-
 able Johns Hopkins address. Naturally,
 we should continue to reiterate the Pres-
 ident's declaration that we want no mili-
 tary foothold in Indochina nor alliances
 there-that our objective is independence
 and neutrality for the countries of the
 region and nothing more.
 The method we should adopt, the tac-
 tics we should employ, in attempting to
 engage the services of the United Na-
 tions, are matters for the State Depart-
 ment.  Whether we should try, under
 U.N. auspices, to reconvene the original
 signatories to the Geneva accords, or
 seek direct U.N. intervention through the
 Security Council, or whether we should
 pursue Secretary General U Thant's in-
 timation that the good offices of the U.N.
 might be utilized to mediate the dispute,
 are matters that cannot be resolved here.
 But this war does threaten world peace,
 and the U.N. did intervene to restore
 internal order in the Congo. The situa-
 tion in Vietnam is sufficiently similar to
 make the crisis there an entirely appro-
 priate subject for U.N. action.
 Indeed, our failure to take the con-
 troversy to the U.N. long ago is a puzzle-
 ment.               It is said that the U.N. faces
 bankruptcy from past peacekeeping mis-
 sions, and is quite unable to assume
 further burdens. Yet, a U.N. peace force
 in South Vietnam could be financed by
 voluntary contributions, the same as oth-
 er ventures in the past.  Even if the
 United States had to pay the bulk of
 the cost, the amount would be less than
 our present outlay.
 It is also said that if we, were to ask
 for U.N. intervention in the Security
 Council, Russia would probably veto the
 proposal.  Perhaps this would happen,
 perhaps not.   The Soviet Union has
 cause to want China restrained in south-
 east Asia, and the U.N. could well rep-
 resent the most acceptable means avail-
 able.  But if Russia were to veto our
 proposal, the onus for the continued war
 would fall on the Communists. Our po-
 sition  would  not be  weakened  but
 strengthened, the same as the Pres-

 It makes no sense to say, "You may
 discuss domestic matters, but dissent
 must end at the water's edge.  Foreign
 matters are the ones most vital to the
 survival of our Nation and the health and
 safety of our people."  That is why the
 Constitution vested in Congress the
 power to declare war, recognizing that
 .this, above all other decisions, was the
 most fundamental that a government
 could make.
 So we have to conduct foreign policy
 In full recognition that we are and shall
 remain a free people.  I tried in my ad-
 dress to point out that I do not believe
 that dissent from some quarters within
 the United States is the reason why
 Hanoi persists in the war.  There are
 much better reasons.
 But this argument serves those who
 would quiet all dissents, who would have
 us act like some monolithic mass; who
 seem to believe that our efforts against
 totalitarianism in the world should be
 conducted as though we were ourselves
 bound in a totalitarian straitjacket.
 The Senator is correct: We in the Sen-
 ate have a duty to speak up. I have
 tried to execute that duty today by point-
 ing out that I fully support the Presi-
 dent's efforts, and that I am in full
 agreement with whathe said in his Johns
 Hopkins address-namely, that he is pre-
 pared to enter into unconditional discus-
 sions looking toward a political settle-
 ment in southeast Asia.
 The new proposals I have made may
 not work; but no one yet has shown me
 how this. country would be weakened by
 trying them. Until someone does, I shall
 continue to stress them.
 I thank the Senator from Wisconsin
 for his contribution to the debate.
 Mr. CLARK.  Madam President, will
 the Senator from Idaho yield?
 Mr. CHURCH. I am happy to yield
 to the Senator from Pennsylvania.
 Mr. CLARK,  Madam President, I
 should like to join the Senator from
 South Dakota and the Senator from Wis-
 consin in their commendation of the
 splendid address just made by the Sena-
 tor from Idaho. I find myself generally
 -in agreement with what he has said;
 specifically, I am impressed by the con-
 structive suggestions he has made in
 the course of his remarks. However, I
 should like to express a slightly differ-
 ent view, to this extent:
 We in,'the Senate should stop acting
 defensively a66-ttt our constitutional duty
 to debate foreign policy in the Senate.
 Of course we must debate the Vietnam
 situation.  Of course we must debate
 the Dominican Republic situation.  Of
 course we must stand in support of the
 Senator from New York [Mr. KENNEDY]
 in the brilliant address he made yester-
 day, in which he said, "Let us stop all
 the nonsense about the proliferation of
 nuclear weapons and try to reach an ac-
 commodation which will lift the burden
 of nuclear terror off the shoulders of
 the world."
 I intend to pay no attention ' to the
 Columnists hawks and the military for
 whom they front. Let the Messrs. Alsop,
 Hanson Baldwin, and William S. White,
 and the militarists for whom they front,
 take their particular positions with re-
 spect to muzzling the Senate and cutting
 off debate in the name of phony patriot-
 ism. I say let us stop talking about our
 right to debate. Of course we are going
 to debate, and we need not be defensive
 about it.
 I should, like to ask the Senator from
 Idaho a few questions of substance in
 connection with his splendid address.
 First, does he not find himself in sub-
 stantial  agreement with  the  recent
 speech by the distinguished chairman of
 the Committee on Foreign Relations [Mr.
 FULBRIGHT] in this regard?
 Mr. CHURCH. I do.
 Mr. CLARK.  Next, I wonder whether
 we do not have to take a somewhat more
 pessimistic veiw of the situation in South
 Vietnam than is represented by the ad-
 ministration's position at the moment or
 by the attitude taken by our good friend,
 the  Senator from 'Connecticut  [Mr.
 DODD], on the floor of the Senate not too
 long ago. I should like to make an ob-
 servation and ask the Senator from Idaho
 to comment on it.
 I am gravely concerned about what
 has happened in Saigon. I consider the
 installation, as premier, of Air Force
 General Ky to be a move of desperation.
 I am terribly upset about his announce-
 ment, as reported in the New York Times,
 that he has set up sandbags for public
 executions in the city square without
 trial, of individual citizens of South Viet-
 nam who may or may not be profiteers,
 and the like.
 I wonder what the Senator's view is
 concerning the sincerity with which we
 can support a kind of government which
 appears to deny every principle of free-
 dom and democracy for which we are
 fighting.  We have said we are in Viet-
 nam to protect freedom, but I am afraid
 history will show that it is a freedom
 which, for more than 1,000 years, the
 people never had.
 I wonder what the Senator from Idaho
 thinks about the contention that we are
 holding up the alms of a free people who,
 for some reason, seem to have chosen a
 government that makes Tony Imbert's
 government in the Dominican Republic
 look like a democracy.
 Mr. CHURCH.  Madam President, I
 am afraid that we Americans have a
 tendency to wrap any American engage-
 ment abroad in a thick ideological cloak.
 Ever since we entered the First World
 War, we have converted our fights into
 moral crusades.  Even 'now we talk
 about the free world, and our duty to
 stand as its sentinel on its every bound-
 ary, against communistic transgression.
 Heaven knows' that I find communism
 repugnant. Everything that I believe in
 is contrary to Communist doctrine and
 Communist objectives.  However, in all
 candor, I admit that communism is not
 the only kind of tyranny in the world.
 If we take a look at the countries sur-
 rounding the Communist world, we have
 to look very hard to find one that is a
 free land.  From Japan to Israel, with
 the exception of India and Malaysia,
 most of the countries are tyrannies.
 Many of the tyrannies are so reprehen-
 sible to the people living within the
 countries that, in this era of rising pop-
 lar expectations, there will come revo-
 14109
 lutions against them.  I hope that the
 Government of the United States will
 not become so single-purposed in its fix-
 ation with communism that it places this
 Nation in the position of defender or pro-
 tector over every rotten tyranny in what
 we euphemistically choose to call the free
 world.  If we do that, our policy will
 never work.  This is an era of great fer-
 ment in the world.  There will be other
 revolutions in many of these countries.
 For us to take the position that we are
 to be a kind of global policeman with
 the duty of imposing a Pax Americana,
 and with a military obligation to inter-
 vene to put down every future effort to
 overthrow   established   governments
 would be a foolish and futile enterprise,
 compared with which I can think of no
 example in the long course of history.
 Rome governed the ancient world by
 conquering it, and thus imposed a Pax
 Romana based upon a universal order
 of Roman law and government.  That is
 .not possible in the modern world, and it
 is the furthest thing from the American
 purpose or desire.
 Mr. CLARK.  Madam President, I
 completely agree with the Senator from
 Idaho.  I should like now, if I may, to
 turn his mind to another, and perhaps
 unduly pessimistic, point of view. There
 are those, including the eminent Colum-
 nist Walter Lippmann, who believe that
 the time might well be past when we can
 negotiate with Hanoi, or . even Peiping
 or possibly even with the Vietcong, and
 that we have reached a point of no re-
 turn in that regard.
 I ask my friend the Senator from Idaho
 to comment as to what we could do if,
 after having "stood firm" during the
 monsoon season-and I agree that we
 should, because I see no alternative and
 am in complete accord with both the
 President and the Senator from Arkansas
 [Mr. F'uLBRiGHTI in that regard-at a
 cost of perhaps thousands of American
 casualities, the monsoon season comes
 to an end and we still have a foothold in
 Vietnam and there is no negotiation.
 Then what should we "do? Should we go
 on interminably in a war which shows
 little hope for this country? Should we
 join our'Republican friends who say that
 if that happens they will take the case
 to the country against the administra-
 tion? .
 . I ask these questions not rhetorically
 because I am not sure that I have the
 answers.  I believe that the Senate de-
 bate should be one in which we should
 think through the problems and attempt
 '
 see what will happen when we get by
 to
 the monsoon season.
 Mr. CHURCH.  Madam President, I
 thank the Senator from Pennsylvania
 for making a very excellent point.
 I am told that the French, during the
 last phases of their attempt to preserve
 French rule in Vietnam, used to reas-
 sure themselves that things would be dif-
 ferent after the monsoon season.
 I believe it is also true that the ad-
 vice we were giving the French in Viet-
 nam, in those days, is very similar to
 the advice that the French are now giv-
 ing us, 10 years later.
 I can only say that I have made some
 proposals which I believe are worthy of

 Saigon, our prestige would begin to rise
 again.
 Does anyone think that French pres-
 tige has suffered since France managed
 to recognize that the era for the" white
 man's control over Africa and Asia has
 ended, that is to say, since France
 stopped trying to preserve French do-
 minion in that part of the world?
 I realize our purpose is not the same
 as the French was. We all know it.  It
 does not do any good to keep pushing
 this open door.  The point is not how
 we see our purpose, or what we know it to
 be. The question is, How do the Asians
 see the war which outwardly seems to
 so much resemble wars with which they
 have had familiarity-the  colonialist
 wars against the French, the Dutch, the
 British, the legions of the Western World.
 I do not, I might add, have great faith
 in wars. Wars in thiscentury have done
 more harm to the Western World than
 good. Rather than furnishing solutions,
 each great war created still bigger prob-
 lems.
 Our purpose is to seek a settlement in
 southeast Asia. That is the basis of our
 hopes; and then American prestige will
 ,soar again in the eyes of the peoples of
 Africa and Asia.
 Madam President, I promised to yield
 the floor, and I am happy to yield the
 floor, so that the distinguished Senator
 from New York [Mr. JAVITS] may be
 recognized.
 Mr.  JAVITS.  Madam  President,  I
 shall take only a few moments.  I ask
 the distinguished Senator from Idaho to
 bear with me.
 I have read his statement with great
 interest.  I - did not, unfortunately, be-
 cause of committee meetings, find it pos-
 sible to be present with other Members
 of the Senate during his delivery of the
 speech. I would like to put his speech in
 focus with respect to the resolution that
 I am about to introduce.
 I consider the resolution a comple-
 ment--and I use the word advisedly-to
 what the Senator from Idaho has laid be-
 fore us.  The dialog must go on, but a
 debate without an instrument of author-
 ity before us for action is a very different
 kind of dialog from that which occurs
 when there are committee  hearings,
 committee consideration, debate, and a
 vote. That is what I am trying to bring
 about.
 When Congress passed Senate Joint
 Resolution 189 of August 10, 1964, it gave
 the President originally a big mandate.
 As Commander in Chief, he did not need
 it, but in our. Government it was wise to
 get the advice and consent of Congress
 for such an important action.  That
 resolution gave the President a blank
 check to use our Armed Forces, but it
 gave him a blank check only in the frame
 of reference at that time : that we were in
 South Vietnam as advisers, that we
 would strike back if we were attacked, as
 in the Gulf of Tonkin, that we would
 protect our bases, and that we would use
 the kind of discretion which was neces-
 sary under the prevailing conditions.
 Now less than a year later we see the
 likelihood of a land war on a long-term
 basis.      -
 Of course, the answer of the Senator
 from  Idaho  and  the  Senator  from
 Pennsylvania [Mr. CLARK] is right. We
 understand we are waiting for a break
 in time and are trying to push all the
 levers we can in order to get that break,
 that does not mean we should not stay
 there.  We are mired there, if that is
 what we want to call it.
 I try, in this resolution to do three
 things. One, to have Congress join the
 President in laying down our objectives
 in South Vietnam-that we have no
 designs in North Vietnam, for example?
 and are willing to go back to the 1954
 Geneva  agreement,  which  has  been
 referred to by the Senator from Arkan-
 sas [Mr. FULBRIGHT], by other Senators,
 and by the majority leader, who is one
 of the most knowledgeable Senators in
 foreign affairs.
 The second point is to have Congress
 join with what the President said at
 Johns Hopkins-That we are ready to
 negotiate, even, as some have said, if it
 means having some representatives of
 the Vietcong in North Vietnam costumes
 in a delegation.
 The third point is to declare our read-
 iness to use every medium the United
 Nations offers in trying to arrive at a
 solution.
 It must be remembered that when the
 President was urged to say that he was
 willing to negotiate, he said he had said
 it 43 times, but when he said it the 44th
 time, at Johns Hopkins, the world heard
 it and said, "Now the United States is
 willing- to conduct absolutely untram-
 meled discussions."
 So it is in this case.  The President
 says he has a mandate.  It is reported
 that he carries it around in his pocket
 and will-show it to demonstrate that he
 is acting in team with the Congress..
 But the words of that mandate no longer
 mean what was intended in the light of
 the situation at that time. A new joint
 resolution would lend the solidarity of
 the President, the Congress, and the peo-.
 ple to our effort.
 I have read what the Senator has said,
 just as he has read what I have said.  I
 would be much comforted by his com-
 ments on this matter.  I am trying to
 add a proper compliment to the dialogue
 which has taken place by a distinguished
 group in this Chamber.
 Mr. CHURCH.  I understand exactly
 what it is the Senator is attempting to
 do.  In a way, he is furnishing an in-
 strument to cope with the mounting
 frustrations in Congress over this situa-
 tion.
 Mr. JAVITS.  Exactly.
 Mr. CHURCH.  His proposal is wor-
 thy of the most serious consideration by
 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
 because We are all groping for some
 answer, and we want to look very care-
 fully at the one the Senator from New
 York has taken the initiative to offer
 today.
 Mr. JAVITS.  I am grateful for the
 comments of the Senator from Idaho.
 I yield now, without losing my right to
 the floor, to the Senator from Ohio
 [Mr. YOUNG].
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  Madam Presi-
 dent, I thank the distinguished -Senator
 serious study.  If they were tried, they
 might work.  If they do not work, we
 shall not be weakened in any way.
 In the meantime, I concur with the
 Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. CLARK]
 and with the distinguished chairman of
 the Foreign Relations Committee [Mr.
 FULBRIGHTI that we must stick _itout, be-
 cause we have made a commitment.
 Whether it was a wise or an unwise com-
 mitment is not the point. Once a coun-
 try like the United States pledges itself
 to assume an obligation, that obligation
 must be honored. At the same time, we
 must continue to try to find a basis for
 a satisfactory settlement in Vietnam.
 One of the ways to do it is by continuing
 the debate on the floor of the U.S..Sen-
 ate.
 I now yield to the Senator from Utah.
 Mr. MOSS.  Madam President, very
 briefly, I commend my colleague the Sen-
 ator from Idaho for his usual, thought-
 ful and very courageous exposition of a
 problem that I am sure bothers us all.
 I find myself in concurrence with the
 speech that the Senator has delivered
 today. I congratulate him on his cour-
 age in coming to the floor and trying to
 open and expand the dialog on the sit-
 uation in Vietnam.
 It seems to me that the Senator from
 Idaho has said, in a little different way,
 something that was said on the floor
 yesterday when the problem of nuclear
 proliferation was being discussed, and
 that is that we in the United States,
 merely because we are the greatest and
 richest country in the world, must take
 the initiative in seeking a way out of this
 problem, rather than comporting our-
 selves as though we were fearful of our
 prestige, fearful of being thought to be
 compliant, fearful of taking_ the steps
 that a truly great nation should take.
 I find that implicit in the three pro-
 posals the Senator has made, which
 are : first, that we seek to have the
 United Nations enter this matter; sec-
 ond, that we affirm our willingness to
 deal with representatives of the Vietcong
 as part of the negotiations; and, third,
 that we advocate genuine self-determi-
 nation for the people of South Vietnam,
 as the basis for an agreement settling the
 war.
 I believe that these are great and
 worthy programs, and that we should
 have continued debate on the floor of
 the Senate.
 We should fulfill our position as part-
 ners in this form of government and in
 our general policy.
 I commend the Senator from Idaho.
 Mr. CHURCH.  Madam President, I
 thank the Senator very much for his
 words.
 One final word concerning the pres-
 tige argument.  The continuing war in
 southeast Asia, in my judgment, is stead-
 ily eroding American prestige in the eyes
 of most of the ordinary people in the
 Afro-Asian world, because they see the
 war differently than we see it.. That is
 why Red China is so interested in seeing
 the war prolonged.  If we were able to
 find a basis for a settlement that we could
 live with, that would not represent ei-
 ther unilateral American withdrawal or
 a repudiation of our commitment to

 THE SHARPENING PREDICAMENT IN VIETNAM
 In his press conference last Thursday, the
 President quoted some secret reports he had
 received from a foreigner  who had made
 contact with a high official in Hanoi.  The
 President meant to convince our people that
 he had tried and failed to "get them (the
 North Vietnamese) to talk to us."
 The first secret report was on February 15,
 very shortly after our bombing offensive had
 begun.  The second report was on June 7,
 when the bombing policy had been in opera-
 tion for 4 months.  The substance of both
 14111
 reports was the same. Neither the threat of
 the bombing nor the results of the bombing
 had induced Hanoi to.take an interest in
 negotiating peace with the United States.
 There is no doubt that the President is
 correctly informed.  Hanoi will not negotiate
 with Washington because it is convinced that
 Saigon has lost the war and that we cannot
 reverse the results. In Paris a few weeks
 ago I talked with a number of specialists in
 southeast Asia, both French and Vietnamese.
 I asked them what would happen if     the
 President ordered the bombing of Hanoi and
 Haiphong  and invaded  with a very  large
 army.
 It would only make more certain, they said,
 the  ultimate  domination of  Vietnam  by
 China.  For the result of all our bombing in
 the north and of all our fighting in the
 south would be to wreck and ruin the whole
 of Vietnam to a point where the Vietnamese
 themselves would be quite unable to recon-
 struct their economy.
 They would have to turn to China.  For
 the United States would find no government
 which it could support, and amidst the dev-
 astation only an oriental dictatorship would
 be  able to deal with  the chaos and the
 misery.
 I have learned over the years to have great
 respect for the judgment of these men with
 whom I talked.  They have the advantage
 not only of the long French experience in
 Indochina but also of their contacts, through
 the large Vietnamese colony in Paris, with
 Hanoi, and even with the Vietcong.
 They are prophesying now that while U.S.
 military power can destroy the political and
 economic structure of Vietnam, it cannot
 transform the defeated Saigonese into vic-
 tors.  The more the devastation, the more
 certainly will China be the ultimate winner.
 Does this mean that the time has passed,
 owing to the  irreparable  losses in  South
 Vietnam, when the President can hope to
 induce Hanoi to negotiate with him?   If he
 means with him, I am afraid there is no
 doubt it means just that.  It is no less true,
 I think, that he is now unable, even if he
 were willing, to negotiate with the Vietcong.
 At this grim juncture, the President is
 threatened at home by a Republican ma-
 neuver  which  he  cannot  easily  dismiss.
 Messrs Laird and Ford told him last week
 that if his objective is nothing better than
 a negotiated peace, he is committing many
 too many American troops. This is an ex-
 ceedingly shrewd political maneuver.      For,
 if the President continues his present policy,
 which is to commit an increasingly large
 ground army in order to produce a stale-
 mate, he will be accused of wasting Ameri-
 can lives for no real purpose.  Messrs. Laird
 and Ford, on the other hand, will go to the
 country saying that if the President had
 only dared to bomb Hanoi and Haiphong, the
 United States would have had a victory with-
 out casualties on the ground.   It would not
 be true because all experience goes to show
 that wars cannot be won by bombing alone.
 But it would be effective demagogy.
 The President is in a squeeze because his
 limited policy has failed and an unlimited
 policy would incur greater risks of great war
 than he has a right to take.  The moment of
 truth is drawing near, a moment when he
 will have to ask himself whether, since he
 cannot negotiate with Hanoi, someone else
 can.  In the months to come he will have
 to consider whether the only course still
 open to him is to encourage the Vietnamese-
 Hanoi, Saigon, Vietcong--to negotiate with
 each other.
 If they could work out a deal among them-
 selves, it would no doubt mean that our
 influence in Vietnam had sunk to a very low'
 point, except as we recovered some of it in
 assisting the reconstruction of the country.
 But there may be some consolation in the
 fact that a Vietnamese solution made by the
 Vietnamese might lay the foundations of

 THE FIERczNEss or RED CHINA
 (By Walter Lippman)
 The quarrel in the Communist camp has
 become evermore ferocious and from our
 point of view evermore interesting.  We have
 to begin by making a guess as to why, as the
 military situation in Vietnam grows worse,
 the  Sino-Soviet  quarrel  becomes  fiercer.
 There must be something of very high im-
 portance  at  stake  between                      Moscow  and
 Peiping.
 My guess-there is no way of knowing-is
 that the intensification of the quarrel is due
 at bottom to Red China's fears that there is
 in the making a Soviet-American under-
 standing for the containment of China.  If
 this came about, China would be strategi-
 cally surrounded. There would be the Soviet
 nuclear power along its northern frontier
 and there would be American nuclear power,
 allied in some measure with the Soviet Union,
 along the Chinese southern and southeastern
 frontiers.
 China's fear that this might happen could
 explain  a  number of  otherwise puzzling
 things.  It could explain Pedping's recent
 accusation that the Soviet Union is an Amer-
 ican stooge conspiring to end the war and
 deprive Peiping of a total victory.  It could
 explain the fact, which has now been con-
 firmed officially by the "Soviet Union, that
 Peiping has been opposing and obstructing
 Soviet military aid to North Vietnam.  For
 if the Russians appeared as the principal
 military defender of Hanoi, they would ac-
 quire a principal influence on the settlement
 of the war.
 Moreover, if my guess is correct, the Chi-
 nese Government believes that if the war
 can be made to go on to the bitter end, the
 result will be to expel the Soviet Union and
 the United States from its southern border-
 land.  Without having to fight itself, Red
 China would then fall heir to the wreck and
 ruin of Vietnam, and the historically anti-
 Chinese people of Vietnam would be deci-
 mated and prostrated.
 These are high stakes, and only high stakes
 can account for the fierceness of the Chinese
 campaign against the Russians.  If the hy-
 pothesis is correct, the first practical conclu-
 sion, we must draw from it is that we must
 not be overzealous.  The Soviet Union is still
 a Communist society, and we must not em-
 barrass it by treating It as if it had turned
 renegade.  We should act on the principle
 that the Soviet Union is a mature Communist
 society, and because of that--since both of
 us are mature societies-we have a common
 vital interest in coexistence and world peace.
 It is not for us to make ostentatious and
 dramatic overtures to Moscow.  But we can
 move with deliberation to remove the minor
 irritations, as for example, over the payments
 to the U.N. Beyond this, we should let other
 governments make the running while we
 hold on in South Vietnam and ponder the
 crucial and unavoidable decision of whether
 to encourage negotiation among the Viet-
 namese.
 The fierce intransigence of Red China is a
 fact.  Potentially and theoretically it threat-
 ens everyone.  The great question is whether
 Red China's militancy and expansionism will
 be moderated in the course of time or in-
 tensified during the few years that remain
 before Red China becomes a nuclear power.
 It is a gamble, of course.  But I myself am
 betting that moderation will appear in the
 course oftime and natural evolution and can
 be brought on by patience, firmness, and dip-
 lomatic skill.  The alternative is preventive
 Back in the late  1940's when the  cold
 war had begun, when Stalin was at his worst,
 I was invited to lunch in the Pentagon with
 a high official. The object of the lunch was
 to persuade me to write articles in favor of
 launching a preventive nuclear war against
 the Soviet Union.  Stalin, I was reminded,
 waS a villain who was moving step by step
 toward the conquest of the world.  There
 was no stopping him by measures short of
 nuclear war, and as we had the air force
 and the nuclear bombs while Stalin did not
 yet have them, it was our duty to strike
 him before he struck us.  Not to do so would
 be criminal negligence. , If we flinched and
 waited, we would lose the future.
 I  did  not  write  the   articles,  but  the
 luncheon made a profound impression on me,
 particularly in the years which have followed
 during which the Soviet Union has emerged
 from Stalinism.  We gambled correctly, that
 Stalinism would pass, and we won that gam-
 ble.  We shall have to take t" same gam-

 JOINT RESOLUTION D  IGNED TO
 TRIGGER HEARINGS AND DEBATE
 ON VIETNAM POLICY
 Mr. JAVITS, Madam President, on
 several occasions in the past 2 months-
 ever since it began to appear likely that
 American  troops in  large  numbers
 would be sent into ground combat in
 South Vietnam-I have urged the Pres-
 ident to consult Congress by means of a
 joint resolution to approve and support
 such an important new phase of United
 States participation in the Vietnam
 struggle.  Laying a new resolution be-
 fore Congress to follow the August 10,
 1964, resolution, passed after the Bay of
 Tonkin incident, would have been a most
 desirable and 'responsible action on the
 part of the administration.  But it has
 not been done.  I am, therefore, intro-
 ducing today a joint resolution-which I
 send to the desk and ask that it be ap-
 propriately referred and printed in the
 RECORD-which raises the issues and
 will, if acted on, inspire the hearings and
 debate which the' situation `requires.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint
 resolution will be received and appro-
 priately referred; and without objection,
 the joint resolution will be printed in the
 RECORD.
 The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 93) to
 promote the maintenance of interna-
 tional peace and security in southeast
 Asia, and to supplement Public Law 88-
 408, introduced by Mr. JAVIxs (for him-
 self and Mr. RANDOLPH), was received,
 read twice by its title, referred to the
 Committee on Foreign Relations, and
 ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as
 follows:
 S.J. RE5. 93
 Whereas the Congress by joint resolution
 approved August 10, 1964, declared that it
 "approves and supports the determination of
 the President, as Commander in Chief, to
 take all  necessary measures to repel any
 armed attack against the forces of the United
 States and to prevent further aggression"
 and further declared that "The United States
 regards as vital to its national interest and
 to world peace the maintenance of interna-
 tional peace and security in southeast Asia"
 and "is, therefore, prepared, as the President
 determines, to take all necessary steps, in-
 cluding the use of armed force, to assist any
 member or protocol state of the Southeast
 Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting as-
 sistance in defense -of its freedom"; and
 Whereas  the  deliberate  and  systematic
 campaign of aggression that the Communist
 regime in North Vietnam is, waging against
 its neighbors and the nations joined with
 them in the collective defense of their free-
 dom has risen in intensity and constitutes
 a threat to international peace and security
 which is not being met by action of the
 United Nations or other international agen-
 cies; and
 Whereas the people of South Vietnam and
 the peoples of southeast Asia continue to
 desire the assistance of the United States in
 protecting their freedom and their right, to
 be left in peace to work out their own des-
 tinies in their own way; and
 Whereas the United States has no terri-
 torial, militiry, or political ambitions in that
 area, and the President has expressed the
 determination of the people of the United
 States that the United States is prepared to
 engage in uncondiional discussions and nego-
 tiations to bring about a condition of peace
 and security in southeast Asia; and
 Whereas the intensification of the aggres-
 sion  against  South  Vietnam  requires  the
 United States so materially to increase the
 means for defense against such aggression,
 including the use of the Armed Forces, as
 to make advisable a further joint resolution
 of approval and support by the Congress:
 Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
 resentatives of the United States of America
 in Congress assembled, That the Congress ap-
 proves and supports the decisions made by
 the President, as Commander in Chief, in im-
 plementing the joint resolution of August
 10, 1964, to promote the maintenance of in-
 ternational peace and security in southeast
 Asia.
 SEC. 2. The United States declares its deter-
 mination, consonant with the Constitution
 of the United States and the Charter of the
 United Nations and in accordance with its
 obligations under the Southeast Asia Collec-
 tive Defense Treaty, to take all necessary
 steps, including the use of armed force, as
 the President determines, for the purposes
 set forth in section 3, to assist any member
 or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Col-
 lective Defense Treaty requesting assistance
 in defense of its freedom.
 SEC. 3. The United States affirms that the
 objectives of the United States are to bring
 about the cessation of hostilities by cease-
 fire or other appropriate means and the res-
 toration of peace, tranquillity, and security,
 and the observance of international treaties
 and agreements in South Vietnam, and to
 assist South Vietnam in obtaining a full
 opportunity for self-determination, religious
 freedom, economic and social progress, the
 establishment  and  strengthening  of  free
 institutions, and the enjoyment of friendly
 relations with its neighbors.
 The United States is ready, whenever and
 wherever there is any willingness by the other
 appropriate parties to do so, to undertake
 honorable negotiations to attain these objec-
 tives.
 Sze. 4. The United States regards inter-
 national action to assure conditions of peace,
 security, and freedom in southeast Asia to
 be most desirable and is ready to join with
 other appropriate parties  in assuring the
 maintenance of international peace and ap-
 plying within that area the principles and
 provisions of the United Nations Charter.
 SEC. 5. This resolution shall expire when
 the President shall determine that the peace
 and security of the area is reasonably assured
 by international conditions created by action
 of the United Nations or otherwise, except
 that it may be terminated earlier by concur-
 rent rsolution of the Congress.
 Mr. JAVITS.  Madam President, in
 this connection, it is important to note
