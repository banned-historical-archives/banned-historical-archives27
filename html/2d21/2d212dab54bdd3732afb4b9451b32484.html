PREFACE 
This report is the second in a series of 
in-depth biographic studies of Communist China's  
top leaders  
I _ )The series will fill a gap in our bio-
graphical coverage of China's senior leadership 
and is launched in anticipation of future leader-
ship changes. 
The additional length of these reports over 
our conventional product is primarily attributable 
to the inclusion of more background information 
and speculative comment than is our usual custom. 
Our aim is not to take firm positions on matters 
of great intelligence interest but to present the 
available facts--as well as some of the differing 
views of China specialists on these leaders. 
This report was prepared by the Central Reference 
Service and was coordinated within CIA as 
appropriate.

BIOGRAPHIC BRIEF 
The enigmatic Lin Piao, Mao's favorite 
general and the youngest of the ex-marshals in 
the fading old guard of the People's Liberation 
Army (PLA), has been Mao's chosen heir apparent 
for 5 years. He was confirmed by the Ninth 
CCP Congress in April 1969 as Mao's successor, 
replacing Liu Shao-chli. 
Born in a revolutionary-minded environment, 
Lin matured rapidly as a field general in the 
1930's until dealt the severe handicap of 
recurring ill health following a serious wound 
in 1938. He mastered his condition sufficiently 
to reconfirm his towering reputation as a field 
captain in the military campaigns that preceded 
the 1949 takeover. 
In partial retirement during much of the 
1950's, Lin was yet a powerful regional figure 
and rose quietly in national influence. He 
emerged at the end of the decade as Mao's counter-
weight to party politicians, and he gave his full 
support to Mao's recent struggle for control of 
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), using the PLA 
as the principal tool in the Cultural Revolution 
years of 1965-69. 
His wife, 
Yeh Ch'un, sits on the Politburo and helps manage 
his work load.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
Vice Chairman, Chinese 
Communist Party; Vice 
Chairman, Politburo; 
Principal Vice Chairman, 
Military Affairs Com-
mission; Minister of 
National Defense 
Lin Piao, Mao Tse-
tung's favorite general 
the commander of China's 
military forces, and 
Mao's designated politi-
cal heir, has a strong 
record but uncertain 
prospects. After 1959, 
when Mao ended former 
Defense Minister Pleng 
Te-huai's career, Lin 
made the People's Liberation ALmy (PLA) a model 
for nationwide emulation. His ideological prepara-
tion of the aimed forces, in retrospect, appears to 
have been a deliberate effort instigated by Mao to 
exploit a rejuvenated PLA under Lin as the major 
instrument for combating those domestic foes that 
Mao believed were opposing him. 
Lin's status derives primarily from Ma s favor, 
but it is supported by an apparently effective work-
ing relationship with Premier Chou En-lai and by 
Lin's important political positions. 
LIN Piao 
(2651/1753) 
Despite Lin's rapid rise to prominence since 
1959, he remains one of the least known of China's 
leaders and is difficult to assess. In his posture 
Lin must take account of Mao's innate jealousy, and 
it is understandable that Lin's present image is a 
pallid one. It remains to be seen whether he will 
be capable of stepping out in his own right after 
Mao's demise. He seems devoid of charisma, but the 
frail and bumbling picture sometimes reported is an 
over-simplified caricature. He has worked for over 
30 years under partial physical disability, and 
he clearly combines great inner strength with his 
recognized talent.

Approved for Release: 2022/02/10 006928150 
Lin is an able military tactician, strategist, 
politician and administrator. He controls the 
military establishment through the Military Commis-
sion of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Lin has 
systematically placed military men personally loyal 
to him in many key central and regional party and 
government posts. During the Cultural Revolution, 
however, his treatment of the PLA was, by Western 
standards of intraorganizational loyalty, repre-
hensible, and the resentments kindled then could 
impede his succession. 
Despite Mao's accolade, and despite his own 
organizational skill, Lin's prospects for a smooth 
succession to Mao are uncertain. Besides having 
poor health, he does not take a very positive role 
in running the country. His public association 
with some of Mao's extreme policies may also have 
cost Lin appreciable military and civilian support 
since 1960, and especially since 1966. 
Positions  
Lin's titular rise in China's central government 
began in 1954, when he became a Vice Premier of the 
State Council. In 1955 he attained membership on 
the Politburo. He has been a Vice Chairman of the 
CCP Central Committee (CCP-CC) since May 1958, when 
he was elevated to the inner circle by appointment 
to the Politburo Standing Committee. In September 
1959 he became Minister of National Defense and 
senior vice chairman of the CCP Military Commission. 
With his rise to his present stature as Mao's heir 
in 1966, he also became the sole Vice Chairman of 
the CCP-CC (the other four vice-chairmanships were 
eliminated) and the senior Vice Premier of the State 
Council. In 1969 Lin was reelected Vice Chairman 
of both the CCP-CC and the Politburo at the Ninth 
Congress of the CCP and was also reelected to the 
Politburo Standing Committee. 
With Mao and Chou En-lai Lin dominates the 
Politburo through the Standing Committee. He and 
Mao dominate military affairs through the Military

Commission and its "administrative unit." The 
Commission, a panel, and the unit, a secretariat, 
are bodies through which Lin can control and 
direct military matters to any needed extent. 
Early Life  
Lin Piao (born Lin Yu-jung 2651/3022/1369) 
was born on 5 December 1907 in Liuchiawan, Huang-
kang Hsien, Hupeh Province. He was the second of 
four sons. Possibly two of his brothers were 
involved in early revolutionary activity. Three 
were cadres after 1938; one survives and now works 
in a tuberculosis hospital in Tientsin. His 
father was a petty landowner, the proprietor of a 
small felt factory, which failed, and in later 
years a purser on a river steamer. 
Lin was nurtured under strong revolutionary 
influences in his family. Maturing in stirring 
times and in a revolutionary hotbed, he was intro-
duced to Communism by a cousin. This man, Lin 
Yu-nan, was 20 years Lin's senior and a founder 
of the "Hupeh Communist Group." Lin Yu-nan was 
in the USSR in 1917, and in 1920 he organized a 
Communist Party group in Lin Piao's natal village. 
After primary schooling, Lin studied at his 
cousin's Chunhsin School at Patouwan from 1919 to 
1921. For the next 4 years he attended the Kung-
chin Middle School in Wuchang (now part of Wuhan). 
Both schools were centers of Communist indoctrina-
tion. 
At some time during his student days Lin 
joined the Kuomintang. At the age of 17, he was 
much influenced by the May 30th Movement of 1925, 
and he went to Shanghai as a delegate to a congress 
of the communistic China National Students' Fede-
ration. There he joined Socialist Youth and later 
its successor, the Communist Youth League. In 
1925 he went to Canton to enter the Whampoa Mili-
tary Academy. At Whampoa he came under the

influence of Chou En-lai, the school's real 
political director in the usual absence of the 
Kuomintang (KMT) figure to whom Chou was nominally 
deputy. In 1926, when KMT members had to resign 
if they had Communist affiliations, Lin left the 
KMT and overtly joined the CCP. 
Lin participated in the Northern Expedition 
of 1926 as a probationary platoon and company 
commander. He was involved in the 1 August 1927 
mutiny against the Nationalists in Nanchang, 
Kiangsi Province, when the PLA was "born" and 
endured its first defeat. Under Chu Te, his 
principal patron and still a Politburo member, 
Lin quickly became a battalion commander in the 
4th Red Army, which was organized after Chu and 
Mao joined forces in April 1928. 
Lin succeeded Chu Te in command of the 4th 
Red Army in 1930 and in command of the 1st Red 
Army Group in 1932. He had gained the confidence 
of Mao and Chu while still junior to other top 
commanders, and his reputation as an able tactical 
commander began to grow. 
As a field general Lin emerged from the 
shadow of Chu Te after the Long March of 1934-35, 
when he and Chou En-lai, under Mao and Pleng Te-
huai, Mao's senior general on that trip, were in 
the vanguard group. At Yenan Lin was given com-
mand of the 115th Division of the Eighth Route 
Army in the reorganized Chinese Communist Armed 
Forces. 
After June 1936 Lin headed the Eighth Route 
Army's cadre school, usually known until 1945 as 
the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and 
Political University (Kangta). 
Lin is given possibly unmerited credit for a 
successful ambush of part of the Japanese 5th 
Division in September 1937 at Pinghsingkuan, the 
principal point of entry to Shansi from Hopeh. 
At least two visitors to Yensn gained the impres-
sion that credit for the battlefield victory

really belonged to Nieh 
Jung-chen, Lin's deputy 
commander. 
Many of the military 
men who were later named 
to key PLA posts served 
under Lin during the now 
semilegendary, "heroic" 
Yenan days extending from 
1935 to 1945. 
The Wartime Years 
In early 1938 Lin 
received an incapacitating 
wound that forced him to 
depart for the USSR for 
treatment. He therefore 
missed the "Hundred Regi-
ments" campaign of 1940. 
This climactic offensive involved over 400,000 
men in 115 regiments and lasted 108 days. Lin's 
deputy, Nieh Jung-chen, supposedly furnished 47 
regiments from the area under his command, but 
certain units formerly under Lin's direct command 
did not participate. 
ADDRESSING TRAINEES AT YENAN 
C. 1937 
Returning to Yenan from the USSR in 1941 or 
1942, Lin assisted Mao in the 1942 Rectification 
Campaign directed against Mao's inner party oppo-
sition. Late in the year he was assigned to the 
light but essential duty of liaison service with 
the Chinese Nationalists in Chungking in associ-
ation with Chou En-lai. One of their tasks was 
to negotiate preliminary proposals for military 
collaboration with the Chinese Nationalists. Lin 
returned to Yenan after July 1943 to resume the 
Kangta command and help direct the training of 
troops. After V-J Day the Communists moved into 
Manchuria in advance of the Nationalists. Lin 
assumed overall command of the Northeast Military 
District and of the Northeast Democratic United 
Army in October 1945. Lin's growing forces com-
pleted the occupation of Manchuria and the elim-
ination of Nationalist resistance by the end of 
1948.

Lin then led his forces, reorganized in late 
1948 into the PLA 4th Field Army, in the victorious 
1949 sweep to China's southern frontiers. During 
this period Lin served as commander of the Central 
China Military District and as first secretary of 
the Central China Bureau of the CCP, while remain-
ing commander of the 4th Field Army. 
The 1950's 
Troops drawn mostly from the 4th Field Army, 
Lin's command, spearheaded the Chinese entry into 
the Korean War late in 1950. 
claimed that it was Lin who directed 
PLA operations in Korea from 26 November 1950 
until January or February 1951, but the regime 
itself has never commented on Lin's role, if any, 
in the Korean conflict, and he was probably not 
present. 
When the national regime was established in 
1949, Lin immediately became a member of two 
interim organs--the Central People's Government 
Council and the People's Revolutionary Military 
Council; he became a vice chairman of the latter 
body in 1951. 
In October 1949 Lin was appointed chairman 
of the Central-South Military and Administrative 
Committee; he remained chairman of the Central-
South Administrative Committee, which succeeded 
it in 1953. He was also commander of the Central-
South Military District from 1949 to 1954 and 
first secretary of the Central-South Bureau of 
the CCP from July 1950 to 1954. He remained 
commander of the 4th Field Army until its reorga-
nization in 1954.

Lin replaced P'eng Te-huai as Minister of 
Defense in September 1959. Since then Lin has 
attempted to articulate Mao's desires--at the 
price of many fine military managers lost 
through purge. 
The 1960's 
After Soviet military advisers left in mid-
1960, the CCP-CC Military Affairs Committee, at 
an enlarged meeting in September-October, endorsed 
Lin Piao's platform of the "Four Firsts"--abstract 
theses that identify the four primary working 
contexts in which, under the influence of Mao's 
thought, politicization should mature. In terms 
of increasing specificity, these phases of 
activity are said to shift from the general human 
situation to political activity, next to ideolo-
gical awareness, and finally to the application 
of the "living idea," i.e., the ability to put 
Mao's thought to work in solving day-to-day prob-
lems. 
Also emphasized and subsequently linked with 
the methods of Lin Piao was the somewhat older 
"Five-Good Soldier" movement to cultivate indi-
viduals who would be "both Red and expert" and 
who would be above the sort of "professionalism" 
that chooses to be expert before being "Red" and 
neglects political activity. 
At the beginning of 1961 the Military Commis-
sion also promulgated Lin Piao's criteria of "Four 
Goods" for judging the political and military 
effectiveness of basic-level units. These formu-
las have been relentlessly developed and inflated 
as touchstones of Lin Piao's reinvigoration of the 
PLA, beginning with a "rectification campaign" in 
1960-61. 
Despite Lin's having increased PLA combat 
effectiveness after 1960, the notion that an army 
exists to fight has, overall, lost ground in favor 
of the idea that the PLA is the instrument of 
ongoing revolution and political reconstruction. 
Lin's position on soldierly preparedness, however, 
has not necessarily been nonprofessional. Lin has 
� 7 �

always stressed improved training in basic skills 
for individuals and for small units, and under 
him the Military Commission ordered the reduction 
of large-scale military exercises. Lin's philoso-
phy emphasizes the creation of a well-conditioned 
soldier, flexible in both the political and tech-
nical dimensions, and adaptable to new demands. 
For such a soldier, presumably, retraining is 
continual and partially self-directed. 
The politicization process in the PLA began to 
take on important domestic political overtones in 
1962 when Mao set out to recapture the CCP, intend-
ing to use the PLA as the instrument. During the 
year and a half that followed, the regime was more 
preoccupied by foreign affairs and by the efforts 
of Liu Shao-chli's old CCP machine to regain the 
initiative than with matters in which Lin Piao was 
overtly involved. Lin abolished ranks in the PLA 
in 1965. This reduced the authority vested in 
professional officers by rank apart from assignment 
and greatly simplified politically motivated per-
sonnel changes. The propaganda buildup of the PLA 
as a political model gained great strength in that 
year. 
The Cultural Revolution  
"On People's War," a lengthy article ascribed 
to Lin and published in September 1965 at the out-
set of the Cultural Revolution, reiterated many 
Maoist positions and placed them in long-term 
context. Lin seemingly challenged the nuclear 
centers of the non-Communist world with envelopment 
through spreading revolution, but in failing to 
commit China to anything beyond encouragement, he 
reinforced Mao's basically inward-looking perspec-
tive on China's place in the world political 
community. 
In step with Mao when the Cultural Revolution 
was launched in early November 1955, Lin issued a 
directive to the PLA on 15 November on its work 
for 1966. Lin called for a political mobilization 
of the PLA, emphasizing the use of Mao's thought, 
the "Four Firsts," hard political work at the

company level, and energetic promotion and train-
ing programs. This was followed in January 1966 
by a PLA political work conference to implement 
the directive. In late March Lin gave his support 
to a critical report by Chiang Ch'ing on the PIA 
political condition and put himself behind both 
an impending PLA purge and the use of the PLA to 
support the Cultural Revolution in China. In 
early August 1966, just before a series of Red 
Guard rallies began, Lin launched the internal 
purge of the PLA but largely spared the lower-
level line organizations. 
ADDRESSING A CULTURAL REVOLUTION RALLY, AUGUST 1966. L TO R: KIANG SHENG, 
CHIANG CH'ING, CHOU EN-LAI, LIN PIAO AND MAO TSE-TUNG. 
Lin's most significant single contribution 
to the Cultural Revolution in 1966 was to lead, 
on Mao's behalf, in eliminating Pieng Chen, the 
leader of the Cultural Revolution's first phase.

Spearheading Mao's plan after Pleng was purged, 
Lin then supported Mao's second Cultural Revolu-
tion Group, a new and radicalized body, which 
enlarged the campaign and undertook an all-out 
attack on the CCP. When the Eighth CCP-CC Plenum 
met in August 1966 Lin emerged as the leading 
radical and heir apparent. 
For Lin, the months between August 1966 and 
April 1969 encompassed both intense activity and 
at least one reported bout of illness, in early 
1967. He spoke at four of the eight great rallies 
(the other four had no speeches), held between 18 
August and 26 November 1967, that launched the Red 
Guards on their destruction of the old CCP. 
Lin enforced the assignments laid on the PLA 
in the first half of 1967. These tasks included 
implementation of a 23 January order to end 
spreading chaos caused by confrontations involving 
PLA forces on both sides; strong participation in 
the three-way alliance system for establishing 
revolutionary committees in the provinces; and 
application of the system of military control com-
mittees at all trouble points in the economy and 
government under PLA officers. An order of early 
April to the PLA to accept responsibility for 
keeping order without using force was ineffectual. 
In this difficult period, the stress on 
"politics in command," a purge of numerous senior 
officers in December 1966 and January 1967, and 
the later necessity of giving PLA support to radi-
cal forces had the effect of deepening the gap 
between politically minded officers and those more 
professional officers concerned with military 
problems. 
The Wuhan Incident of 20 July 1967, a regional 
commander's reaction against the Peking radicals, 
was a turning point that sobered the regime. Lin 
had no choice but to replace the commander. Lin 
temporarily joined the inflamed radicals in taking 
a stand against imputed sedition in the PLA. A 
violent but short-lived campaign, initiated to 
"drag out the rascals" throughout the PLA, became 
a divisive threat to PLA integrity, generating 
deep reactions.

In August, as Chiang Ch'ing, Mao's wife, was 
restrained from further support of the extreme 
leftists, Lin shifted his position to support of 
the PLA and authorized PLA suppression of local 
turmoil. On 9 August, in his most significant 
speech of the year, Lin reemphasized the necessity 
for the disruptions that had occurred but supported 
imposition of orderly and firm PLA control over 
mass organizations through better guidance from 
the center. 
In the ensuing half year, Lin's political 
posture appeared to change as the regional PLA 
commanders came to greater prominence at the 
expense of weakening radicalism at the center. 
For instance, Huang Yung-sheng, commander of the 
Canton Military Region, replaced Acting Chief of 
Staff Yang Ch'eng-wu when the latter was purged 
in March 1968. Haw Lin figured politically in 
Yang's removal is not known. Yang's sudden 
political demise and seeming abandonment by Lin, 
to whom he had been considered fully loyal, is 
still unexplained. 
As Lin's first decade as chief of the PLA drew 
to a close in 1969, it was apparent that the PLA 
had changed drastically. Lin had converted it 
from the conventionalized force it had become during 
the 1950's into a politically alert, lower-keyed 
professional body, without abandoning the goal of 
modernization. In making it a revolutionary army 
again, he also had purged it twice. As Mao's 
ranking party soldier he had successfully supported 
the elimination of former Chief of State Liu Shao-
chli, and he had helped dismantle the civil CCP 
apparatus and replace it with a militant, Maoistic 
regime reminiscent of the armies of "liberation" 
of the pre-1949 period. 
In April 1969 Lin's stature as Mao's new 
successor was confirmed, after 32 months' advance 
notice, by being written into the new CCP Constitu-
tion promulgated at the Ninth Congress. He is also 
named three times in the 1970 draft of a proposed 
new State Constitution for the People's Republic of 
China. Article 2 of this document calls him Mao's

Approved for Release: 2022/02/10 006928150 
"close comrade-in-arms and successor and the 
deputy commander of all the armies of the whole 
country." 
The Ninth Party Congress also confirmed Lin's 
stature on the five-man Politburo Standing Committee 
that had run the Cultural Revolution. The Military 
Commission, as reconstructed in 1967, apparently 
continued without change. Its makeup is only 
partly apparent; the principal known parts of the 
commission apparatus appear to be under Lin's 
control. 
Recent Activity  
Not enough is known about Lin's recent activity 
to permit useful speculation on what it means in 
political terms, but his activity patterns are 
partially known from official Chinese sources. 
Necessary public activities for Lin Piao 
include the annual rallies in Peking on I May and 
1 October and any very large special rallies. He 
attends major caucuses, such as Central Committee 
plenums (e.g., October 1968, May 1969 and August 
1970) and enlarged Politburo meetings (e.g, May 
1969). His speeches at such gatherings may or 
may not be published. Occasional unconfirmed 
reports indicate that he travels. He may have 
made personal inspections in southwestern China 
in December 1968 and in the Chenpao Island area 
of Manchuria in March 1969. 
Lin's few private meetings that are reported 
are generally diplomatic- or military-related. 
He has audiences with selected foreign visitors, 
favoring countries that are China's clients. For 
instance, in May 1970 he received Le Duan chief 
of the Vietnam Worker's Party. 
Lin's visibility decreased suddenly following 
the Ninth CCP Congress and its follow-on confer-
ences in April and May 1969. Between 1 January 
1967 and 1 June 1969 Lin was relatively active, 
being physically in evidence for about 16 months, 
and out of sight for only about 13. Thereafter, 
- 12 - 
Approved for Release: 2022/02/10 006928150 
Approved for Release: 2022/02/10 006928150 
except for a few single or closely grouped appear-
ances, Lin was withdrawn from the public eye from 
1 June 1969 to I May 1971. 
Two Views of Lin Piao's Prosyec s  
Lin's stature is rooted in Mao's confidence 
in him, and qualified observers disagree on the 
strength of his power base in the national mili-
tary establishment. Outside the capital he depends 
partly on the projection of his great strength in 
Peking and partly on the loyalty of the PLA to Mao, 
to country, and to Lin as its commander. 
Much depends on Huang Yung-sheng, the PLA 
Chief of Staff, who now seems to stand sixth in 
the regime. Huang's long record of service under 
and near Lin is impressive. Yet when Huang came 
to the General Staff it was as an ex-regional 
commander and not necessarily as Lin's prot4g4. 
If Huang should be elevated to the Politburo 
Standing Committee, the influence of regional 
commanders might well gain strength at the center 
at Lin's expense. 
In one view, therefore Lin is a weak choice 
for the succession because he lacks adequate 
support in the PLA at regional and provincial 
levels. He antagonized many military profession-
als during the Cultural Revolution and bore down 
heavily, often unreasonably, on the regional 
commanders until after the 1967-68 winter of Mao-
study for high-level military cadres in Peking. 
Another view sees Lin as strong through having 
emerged from the Cultural Revolution with the PLA 
still united in its loyalty to Mao, and with its 
commanders united in acceptance of Lin's leader-
ship. In this view Lin's strength is based on his 
personal relationships. These bonds result more 
in influence than in direct control, possibly 
because Lin, like Mao, requires loyal lieutenants 
to be capable of acting independently for unpredic-
table lengths of time during which he is unavailable.

Lin's 1936 wound was apparently in the region 
of the chest. His 3 years of treatment in the 
USSR were followed by light duty from 1941 to 1945. 
His next period of active command was from 1945 
to 1949. Lin is thought to have again been ailing 
in 1952-54, a time when others seemed to be carry-
ing his burden, and during the rest of the 1950's 
his appearances were extraordinarily few, quite 
possibly for health reasons. In 1962 there was 
a 2-month bout of hospitalization, and he was out 
of action at least once during the Cultural Revo-
lution. 
Personality and Style  
Opinions of Lin vary 'de 
y� 
In one perspective, Lin is a master politician; 
in another, he is the soldier's soldier. Uncer�
tainty persists because he has kept himself with-
drawn and semilegendary. In the past there have 
been moments of proud assertiveness, but now, like 
Mao, he keeps observers guessing. In his leader-
ship style of recent years he has suppressed flair. 
His style is characterized by brief appearances 
with limited exposure; infrequent public pronounce-
ments intended to be hailed, capsulized, and 
propagandized; unpredictable timing; restraint in

public attack on newtargets; and long, unex-
plained absences of variable duration. Speculation 
inspired by Lin's public absences has in the past 
proved so unreliable that it has virtually ceased. 
Lin's austere way of life is seemingly devoid 
of pleasures, and he has a public image of intense 
preoccupation with serious concerns. 
Lin's military style was characteristically 
aggressive, imaginative and dramatic, supported 
by exemplary thoroughness in preparation and 
planning. Lin is a believer in full readiness, 
flexibility in commitment of forces, incidental 
dissimulation as needed, and judicious readiness 
to disengage and retreat. Further, he is not 
restricted to one scale of magnitude: He can 
visualize both the building of general success 
out of small successes and the complex marshalling 
of field armies; his ability to grasp or to dis-
count detail cannot therefore be disregarded in 
evaluatina his political and managerial talent. 
concludes: 
From Lin we should therefore expect long 
periods of deceptive inactivity; followed 
by lightning moves in specific directions 
using all the force at his disposal; 
followed either by consolidation or quick 
retreat; followed, finally, by a further 
period of waiting and planning. 
Lin has 
his cont 
limited 
Family  
traveled abroad only to the USSR, an 
Lin is currently married to Yeh Ch'iin, who was 
first identified by Chinese Communist media as his 
e in January 1967. He was previously married 
to Liu Hsi-ming, by whom he has a son and a daugh-
ter. He apparently also has teenage daughters 
from one of the marriages.
