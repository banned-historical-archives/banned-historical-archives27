 29 SEPTEMBER 1971
 INDOCHINA
 The dispatch of the Li Hsien-nien economic delegation to conclude
 the annual aid agreement in Hanoi rather than in Peking, where it
 has always been signed in the past, seems clearly a part of the
 PR 's effort to reassure and mollify the DRV in the wake of plans
 for President Nixon's trip to China.  PRC concern to offer such
 reassurance was strikingly demonstrated when Li Hsien-nien, at a
 banquet on the 24th, seemed to respond directly to the implicat3e~ns
 in recent DRV statements--including those by Defense Minister Giap
 and Premier Dong last month--that China was departing from a
 proletarian internationalist path.  Li dramatized the importance
 of adherence to such a policy when, after avowing Peking's
 intention to continue to assist Vietnam, he declared that "if
 one fails to do so, he is not a proletarian internationalist and
 not a communist."
 Hanoi followed up the 22 September DRV Foreign Ministry statement
 on the preceding day's heavy U.S. air strikes against the North
 with radio and press comment saying these strikes again exposed
 U.S. hypocrisy and intent to continue the war.  A NHAN DAN article
 on the 23d is notable for a personal attack on the President:  It
 says that the latest U.S. action "has bared more clearly the true
 face of Nixon--a very dishonest and wicked man, a reactionary who
 is extremely warlike and perfidious, and a life-or-death enemy of
 our people."  This vitriolic language--reminiscent of some of the
 attacks on the President following the 15 July announcement of his
 plans to visit China--is not repeated in other current comment,
 however.
 Peking and Pyongyang also issued foreign ministry statements
 protesting the air strikes against the DRV on the 21st.  And
 official statements were similarly issued by spokesmen for the
 Sihanouk government's foreign ministry (RGNU) and for the NLHS
 Central Committee.  Comparable formal protests came from all of
 these sources at the time of the heavy strikes last November, but
 only Pyongyang supported the DRV Foreign Ministry statement in
 March of this year with a statement of its own.
 Moscow has issued no high-level protest, although the air strikes
 against the DRV are condemned in some statements by Soviet public
 organizations and in press and radio comment. -Gromyko in his UNGA
 speech, as reported by TASS on the 28th, referred to "recently
 stepped-up" air strikes against the North in the course of asking a
 series of rhetorical questions on why the United States had not
 responded to the PRG's 1 July seven-point proposal.
 PRC DELEGATION FOR AID ACCORD SHOWS CONCERN TO REASSURE DRV
 The conclusion of the annual PRC-DRV aid agreements in Hanoi for
 the first time is                intriguing against the background

 of the DRV's cessation in late August of the attacks on the
 Chinese which had gone on for some six weeks following the 15 July
 announcement of President Nixon's projected visit to China. It
 appears that the halt in Hanoi's polemics coincided with
 preliminary consultations on the agreement, since an "experts
 delegation" arrived in Peking on 28 August headed by Ly Ban, a
 vice minister of foreign trade and regularly a member of the DRV
 delegation in talks on the annual aid agreement.  There were no
 reports of any talks in Peking, however, and there had been rto
 hint that negotiations would be held in Hanoi this year prior
 to the 24 September announcement that the Li IIsien-nien
 delegation had arrived to conclude the agreement on military
 and economic aid for 1972.  Ly Ban was among those reportedly
 welcoming the Chinese delegation, but he was in Peking at
 least as late as 16 September, when he greeted PRG Foreign
 Minister Binh upon her arrival in Peking en route home from
 Paris.
 It is, of course, impossible to know which side took the
 initiative regarding the unprecedented conclusion of the
 agreement in Hanoi.*  But it seems that along with Peking's
 concern to reassure the North Vietnamese about its policies,
 the imminent visit to the DRV by Soviet Chairman Podgornyy
 may also have been a factor.  The Podgornyy visit to the DRV
 "in early October" was first announced on 30 August by Moscow
 and Hanoi, and TASS on 23 September said he would be arriving
 in India on 1 October en route to Hanoi.  It is conceivable
 that the annual Soviet-DRV aid agreement could be signed while
 he is there.**
 *   The aid a rcement for 1971 was signed in Peking on 6 October 1970
 by Li Hsien-nien and DRV delegation head Vice Premier Nguyen Con.
 And from 1965 through 1969, DRV Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi headed
 the delegation which concluded the agreements annually in Peking.
 The timing of the negotiation on the aid agreements has varied
 from year to year; for example, the 1969 agreement with the PRC
 was signed in September and the 1968 accord in July.
 **  While the annual Soviet-DRV aid agreement, like the agreement
 with China, is usually signed by vice premiers, there is a
 precedent for signing at a higher level:  Pharr Van Dong and
 Kosygin signed the annual agreement in October 1969 when the DRV
 premier was visiting the USSR.

 29 SEPTEMBER 1971
 DELEGATION     For the most part, propaganda surrounding the PRC
 ACTIVITIES     delegation's 24-28 September visit  vas standard
 fare, with ceremonial activities closely
 paralleling those in Peking in previous years.  The aid agreement
 was signed on 27 September by PRC Vice Premier and Politburo
 member Li Hsien-nien and DRV Vice Premier and Politburo member
 Le Thanh Nghi at a ceremony attended by Premier Pham Van Dong.
 This accords with the practice in Peking, where Chou En-lai
 has attended the signing ceremonies.  Peking media describe the
 accord as "the 1972 agreement on China's economic, military,
 and material assistance," but VNA adds the qualification that
 it is "nonrefund" aid.  It has been the general pattern for
 Hanoi but not Peking to describe the annual aid agreements as
 "nonrefundable," although the NCNA report on a protocol on
 supplementary military aid signed on 4 July followed Hanoi's
 lead in referring to a "gratuitous" supply of equipment.
 The Li Hsien-nien delegation was feted at a banquet given by
 Le Thanh Nghi on the 24th; on the 26th the group was received by
 Le Duan and Pham Van Dong, who also hosted a banquet that evening.
 This parallels the treatmcnt last year in Peking of the Nguyen
 Con delegation, which was received by Mao and Lin Piao as well
 as by Chou En-lai.  On 27 September DRV Defense Minister Vo
 Nguyen Giap received military members of the PRC delegation--
 Yen Chung-chuan, deputy chief of staff, and Lu Kuei, deputy
 head of the PLA armaments department.  Also on the 27th,
 Li Hsien-nien gave a farewell banquet at the Chinese embassy
 at which Pham Van Dong and Giap were the ranking DRV guests.
 DRV statements during the visit for the most part contained
 standard evaluations of PRC aid and of the relations between the
 two countries.  For example, Le Thanh Nghi at the banquet on the
 24th voiced sentiments similar to Nguyen Con's at a banquet
 welcoming his delegation to Peking last year.  Thus, Nghi affirmed
 that Vietnam has "always enjoyed strong support and great and
 effective assistance" from China and expressed gratitude for
 Chinese aid--particularly noting assistance to overcome damage
 from the recent floods.  Also in essentially standard terms, he
 said that the DRV is "determined to make an all-out effort for
 the further consolidation and development of the friendship and
 militant solidarity between the Vietnamese and Chinese people."
 And he went on to assert that the current Chinese visit and
 talks "represe'.t a new, vivid manifestation of the militant
 solidarity and fraternal, friendly relations between our two
 parties, governments, and peoples."

 SINO-DRV       Despite Li Hsien-nien's direct overtures in
 RELATIONS      assuring the DRV that Peking is committed to a
 policy based on proletarian internationalism,
 Hanoi did not respond in kind and its propaganda notably failed
 to allude to the concept as the basis for Sino-DRV relations.
 Speaking after Le Thanh Nghi at the banquet on the 24th,
 Li Hsien-nien, in stressing the Chinese commitment to aid
 Vietnam, paraphrased an instruction from Mao and in the process
 provided a negative definition oP a proletarian internationalist.
 He declared that if one failed to aid Vietnam "he is not a
 proletarian internationalist and not a communist; this will
 mean betrayal of the revolution."  The Mao instruction,
 introduced by Chou En-tai during his March 1971 visit to Hanoi,
 had advised that "if anyone among us should say that we cannot
 help the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S.
 aggression and for national salvation, that means betrayal,
 betrayal of the revolution."*
 The question of proletarian internationalism was again raised
 by Li Hsien-nien in his 27 September speech at the farewell
 banquet.  He claimed pointedly that the visit had shown that
 "Sino-Vietnamese friendship based on Marxism-Leninism and
 proletarian internationalism is being consolidated and developed
 with each passing day and that it is deep-rooted and no one can
 undermine it."  This statement accords with banquet speeches in
 Peking last year by both Li and Nguyen Con.  Le Thanh  Nghi's
 failure to respond in kind this year suggests that Li's remarks
 on the 24th did not satisfy the North Vietnamese.
 DRV implications last month that Peking was in fact departing
 from a proletarian internationalist path were conveyed in
 Defense Minister Giap's message on the 1 August anniversary of
 the Chinese army and in Pham Van Dong's 31 August DRV National
 Day address.  Giap for the first time failed to characterize
 Chinese assistance as being in the spirit of "proletarian
 internationalism,"** and Pham Van Dong pointedly referred to
 *   It is possible that Peking first advanced this formulation
 last March--just prior to moves to improve Sino-U.S. relations--
 in order to give advance assurance to Hanoi that Peking's support
 for its struggle would not falter.  Since March the Mao
 instruction has been recalled on only two occasions:  by Chief of
 Staff Huang Yung-sheng at a 5 June reception on the PRG
 anniversary and by Fang I, minister for economic relations with
 foreign countries, at a bangr.et welcoming a Vietnamese study group.

 the proletarian internationalism of the Vietnamese people but
 made no such characterization of other communist countries.
 PRC WILLINGNESS     In his promise of support for Vietnam at
 TO "SACRIFICE"     the 24 September banquet, Li Hsien-nien used
 a formulation which Chou En-tai had revived
 on 6 March during his trip to Hanoi but which has not appeared
 in high-level statements since then:  Li said the Chinese "will
 not flinch from the greatest national sacrifices" in aiding
 Vietnam. Willingness to sustain great sacrifices is first
 known to have been vowed by Pang Chen in his 1 October 1965
 PRC National Day address; it was not mentioned again until a
 22 July 1966 speech by Liu Shao-chi.  Peking media continued
 to repeat this pledge during the summer of 1966, and Lin Piao
 voiced it in his national day address that year.  The pledge was
 labeled an "instruction" from Lin Piao in some subsequent
 propaganda.  Prior to Chou's revival of it, the statement had
 last appeared in Peking propaganda in late 1967.
 Li Hsien-nien did not stress Chinese support in his final
 speech on the 27th and, in fact, implicitly played down the need
 for assistance by characterizing the war situation as
 "unprecedentedly fine"--an evaluation that has marked Peking's
 assessment since Operation Lam Son 719 in southern Laos.

 editorial on the new PRC aid agreement
 gratuitously mentioned assistance given the DRV by the Soviet
 Union and other socialist countries.  Hanoi comment on aid
 agreements with China has not normally referred to Soviet aid,
 although aid from "socialist countries" has sometimes been
 cited.  It is not clear whether the references to the Soviets
 at this time are a further indication of Hanoi's continuing
 pique with China in the wake of Sino-U.S. developments or whether
 they were included in anticipation of Soviet President Podgornyy's
 forthcoming visit.  Hanoi's long-standing effort to maintain a
 balance in its treatment of the Soviets and Chinese was well
 illustrated in the VNA press review on the 29th:  The review
 noted the prominent attention given the Chinese aid agreement,
 but it added later that "in view of the coming visit of a
 Soviet party and government delegation to Vietnam" and of the
 PRC's national day, the papers carried reports on economic
 developments in the USSR and China.

 DRV references to Soviet aid at meetings with the Chinese are not
 without precedent, and it is possible that the North Vietnamese
 leaders feel less reluctant to make such references in Hanoi
 than when they are guests of the PRC.  Thus, while Nguyen Con did
 not cite Soviet aid in his speech in Peking last year, Pham Van
 Dong did mention it in his 6 March speech welcoming Chou En-lai
 to Hanoi.  NCNA duly carried the full texts of both Dong's
 speech in March and Nghi's 211. September speech, along with their
 references to the Soviets.
 DRV FOREIGN MINISTRY PROTEST OVER AIR STRIKES ENDORSED BY PRG
 The assertion in the 22 September DRV Foreign Ministry statement
 that the heavy U.S. air strikes against the North on the 21st
 "threaten" the Paris talks is echoed in a supporting PRG
 Foreign Ministry protest on the 23d as well as in a NHAN DAN
 commentary that day.  The statements by the communist delegates
 in Paris serving notice that in protest they would postpone the
 weekly session of the talks until the 30th have been duly
 reported by Hanoi and Front media, but no point is made of the
 postponement in comment on the strikes.
 U.S. air strikes against the North since the heavy ones on the
 21st prompted a standard protest at the lower level of the DRV
 Foreign Ministry spokesman on 27 September.  The spokesman said
 that following "the extremely serious acts of war" on the 21st,
 the United States sent planes including B-52's and "used
 artillery from south of the demilitarized zone and warships in
 the open sea to continuously strafe Huong Lap, Vinh Giang,
 Vinh Son, and Vinh Thach villages in the Vinh Linh area" from
 22-25 September.  He charged further that U.S. planes "str.fed
 a number of localities in the western part of Quang Binh
 Province."
 The minittry statement on the 22d was followed the next day by
 articles in NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN as well as radio
 comment.  NHAN DAN's  aftitle'. is at variance with the other
 propaganda in its vicious personal attack on the President.
 It says that "the new military adventure has bared more clearly
 the true face of Nixon--a very dishoneot and wicked man, a
 reactionary who is extremely warlike.eaid perfidious, and a
 life-or-death enemy of our people."  This attack is reminiscent
 of a passage in the 22 July NHAN DAN editorial that displayed
 Hanoi's disquiet over the President's planned trip to Peking.
 The editorial called the President "the worst anticommunist,

 bellicose, and reactionary element" and added that "in more than
 20 years as senator and vice president, he always proved to be a
 frenzied anticommunist, advocating settling international problems
 by force . . . ."  The current NHAN DAN article is also atypical
 in calling the President a "military adventurer" and in stating
 that for this reason the army and people of North Vietnam "must
 remain vigilant day and night."  Other comment on the strikes
 makes more pro forma references to DRV readiness to deal with the
 "aggressor."
 The QUAN DOI KHAN DAN article does not attack the President
 personally, but it does go beyond the foreign ministry statement in
 another regard.  While the statement called the air strikes "an
 insolent challenge to peace- and justice-loving public opinion in
 the world and the United States," the army paper says the latest
 "act of war" is a "brazen act of provocation against the socialist
 countries and progressive worldwide public cpinion."  (The 3 March
 foreign ministry statement, issued at the time the PRV was
 expressing concern about the Laos operation, also claimed that U.S.
 acts against the DRV constituted "an impudent challenge to the
 socialist countries, peace- and justice-loving countries, U.S.
 people, and people the world over."  The same assertion appeared
 in other propaganda at that time, including remarks by Defense
 Minister Giap at a reception marking Soviet Armed Forces Day on
 23 February.)
 Both the press articles as well as radio comment take issue with
 U.S. statements that the strikes on the 21st were part of the
 policy of "protective reaction."  For example, QUAN DOI NHAN DAN
 says that to "shamelessly" defend the strikes, the U.S. spokesman
 in Saigon repeated the "old arguments of self-defense reactions
 which on many occasions have been rejected by worldwide public
 opinion."  A Hanoi radio broadcast in Mandarin on the 24th called
 the U.S. labeling of the strikes as "a security measure" to
 protect U.S. troops "false reasoning" that exposes the United
 States' "extremely obstinate and bellicose nature."
 A Hanoi radio commentary on the 23d titled "Nixon's Hawkish
 Nature Has Not Changed" goes further than other comment in linking
 the strikes with U.S. "opposition" to a negotiated settlement.
 Like the NHAN DAN Commentator article on the 21st--the first
 substantial Hanoi comment on negotiations since a 25 July
 NHAN DAN Commentator article--Hanoi radio says that the replacement
 of Ambassador Bruce by Ambassador Porter does not appear to have
 changed the "obstructionist" U.S. attitude.

 PRC FOREIGN MINISTRY. PEOPLE'S DAILY SCORE AIR RAIDS ON DRV
 The PRC Foreign Ministry statement and the PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator
 article on 24 September, reacting to the large-scale U.S. bombing
 of the DRV's Quang Binh Province on the 21st, express "great
 indignation at this criminal act of U.S. imperialism."  Peking's
 reaction to the strikes seems in tune with the general effort to
 reassure the DRV.  Chinese media carried the text of the
 22 September DRV Foreign Ministry statement and summaries of the
 23 September PEG Foreign Ministry statement, as well as of the
 statements issued by the DRV and PRG delegations to the Paris
 conference.  The PRC statement is similar in tone and substance
 to the 24 November 1970 PRC Foreign Ministry statement protesting
 U.S. bombing raids against North Vietnam on 21 November.  U.S.
 bombing missions against North Vietnamese targets in March 1971
 did not evoke a PRC Foreign Ministry statement, although Peking
 media reported the DRV Foreign Ministry protest at the time.*
 Condemning the "wanton bombing raids" and expressing "firm
 support" for the DRV stand as represented by its statement on
 the 22d, the PRC Foreign Ministry statement--and the PEOPLE'S
 DAILY Commentator article, which simply rephrased the principal
 points of the Statement--took the "Nixon government" to task for
 talking abou.G ending the war in Vietnam while "in fact constantly
 intensifying" it.  The foreign ministry specifically charged the
 U.S. Administration with refusing to answer the PEG's seven poir:G
 proposal of 1 July and to fix a time limit "for the complete
 and unconditional ;iithdrawal of troops from South Vietnam," with
 "propping up" the Thieu government and directing the "farce of
 'presidential elections"' in South Vietnam, and with arming
 South Vietnamese troops through the "Vietnamizing" plan.  In a
 similar context, the 24 November 1970 PRO Foreign Ministry
 statement had accused "the Nixon government" of "continuously
 expanding the war" while "glibly talking" about seeking peace in
 Indochina and respecting the Geneva agreements.  (That statement
 had been preceded by a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on the 22d.)
 *  Events connected with the Laotian incursion early this year
 brought foreign-ministry-level statements on 25 January and 4 and
 8 February and a PRC Government statement on 12 February.  Those
 statements portrayed a more serious threat directed toward China
 itself and used stronger language than did either the current
 foreign ministry statement or that of 24 November 1970.

 29 SEPTEMBER 1971
 The current statement, like the one last November, did not raise
 the notion of a threat to China.  But both reaffirmed that the
 Vietnamese people's struggle is "our struggle," that the
 Chinese government "has been closely watching the moves in the
 U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam," and that as long
 as that aggression continues the Chinese people will "go all
 out in giving support and assistance" to the Vietnamese
 comrades "until complete victory."
 MOSCOW RADIO. PRESS CONDEMN STRIKES AGAINST DRV. PROMISE AID
 Moscow has denounced the 21 September bombings of the DRV with
 routine-level press and radio comment and some protest statements
 by public organizations.  It had similarly condemned the
 21-22 March 1971 raids with only routine-level comment, although
 a TASS statement had scored the bombings of 21 November 1970.
 Criticism of the 1-2 May 1970 bombings was included in the 4 May
 USSR Government statement--read by Kosygin at a Moscow press
 conference--which was directed chiefly at the U.S. operation in
 Cambodia.
 Soviet commentators assert that the bombing does not square with
 the President's promises to scale down the war and undermines the
 commitments undertaken by the United States in 1968 to end the
 bombing.  On 24 September TASS and Moscow radio reported that
 White House spokesman Ziegler that day said President Nixon personally
 took part in the decision on the bombing.  The reports repeated the
 line that the bombing violates commitments undertaken by the United
 States in 1968, and TASS quoted Ziegler as saying the raids do not
 mean that the United States has altered its decision to end the
 bombing.
 Moscow has reported the Vietnamese communist reaction, including
 the DRV and PRG Foreign Ministry statements and the statements by
 the two communist delegations at the Paris talks.  Moscow comment
 has not brought up the cancellation of the Paris session on the
 23d in protest against the bombings, but on 22 September TASS did
 cite the New York TIMES as saying that "the resumption of full-scale
 air war against North Vietnam destroys all the existing chances at
 the talks in Paris."  An IZVESTIYA article by Ilyinskiy, reported
 by TASS on the 28th, says the bombings "inflict an undoubted blow
 on the real possibilities of a political settlement of the Vietnam
 problem" and indicate new U.S. attempts "to hold up progress" at
 Paris.

 29 SEPTEMBER 1971
 A 25 September PRAVDA article by Kuznetsov says the bombing
 shows U.S. unwillingness to respond to the PRG's seven-point
 plan and determination to adhere...to its "old stand" on troop
 withdrawal.  Aleksey Leontyev in RED STAR on the 26th,
 denouncing the "lie" that the purpose of the bombing is to
 protect American troops in South Vietnam, once again suggests
 that the simplest way to protect the troops would be to
 withdraw them.  The "crux" of the matter, Leontyev adds, is
 that the United States still hopes for a military victory.
 SOVIEi  `iD     Some of the propaganda on the bombings,
 including the statements by public organizations,
 reaffirms that the USSR will continue to give the Vietnamese
 support and assistance.  Other publicity for Soviet aid includes
 reports by TABS on 24 September and PRAVDA on the 25th of a
 message from the VWP Central Committee, the DRV National Assembly
 Standing Committee, and the DRV Government, thanking the CPSU
 Central Committee, the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium, and the
 USSR Council of Ministers for their "kind message and timely
 assistance" in connection with the recent floods in the DRV.
 This Soviet message had been sent on 30 August.  On 17 and
 18 September TASS and PRAVDA had similarly reported a message
 from Le Duan thanking Brezhnev for r. sympathy message of
 2 September and for the relief aid sent by the USSR.*
 ANTI-CHINA POLEMICS     Low-level attacks on Peking's Indochina
 policies continued in Radio Peace and
 Progress broadcasts in Mandarin on 25 September.  Pegged to the
 latest bombing of the DRV, the commentaries once again charged
 that Peking's splittist stand had encouraged U.S. aggressive
 action.  One broadcast said the United States felt sure that
 the bombing would have no "undesirable effects" on the President's
 projected visit to Peking because of "the change in Peking's
 stand" on the question of U.S. aggression in Indochina and on
 troop withdrawal.  The commentary said that demands for U.S.
 *  On 23 September NCNA reported a similar message from Ton Due
 Thang, Le Duan, Truong Chinh, and Pham Van Dong to Mao, Lin Piao,
 and Chou En-lai thanking them for their "timely aid" to the
 flood-stricken Vietnamese people.  This was Peking's only mention
 of relief aid since PRC leaders' message. of 2 September. , However,
 on 19 September VNA had announced thearrival.of both Chinese-and
 Soviet: relief shipments.

 withdrawal have gradually disappeared from Chinese leaders'
 speeches, and it noted a CPUSA comment that the question of
 troop withdrawal assumed "only minor importance" compared with
 other issues discussed by Chou En-lai in his interview with
 the New York TIMES' James Reston.  Another Radio Peace and
 Progress commentary that day said routinely in the context of
 the bombings that if Peking had accepted the Soviet proposal
 for a united front to support Vietnam, the Vietnamese people's
 struggle would have been more effective.
 More generalized calls for unity appear in the joint communique
 on the Japanese Communist Party delegation's 19-26 September
 visit to Moscow, as reported in the Moscow domestic service on
 the 27th.e  The communique does not specify socialist unity when
 it calls for a stepped-up international movement to aid and
 support the peoples of Indochina, adding that this requires a
 "broad international front" and "international cohesion of
 anti-imperialist and democratic forces."  However, it does call
 for "Joint actions" of the "fraternal parties" against the
 "forces of aggression and war, primarily against American
 imperialism," saying this is possible "despite the differences
 of opinion between indiv'.dual parties on these and other
 questions."

 SIHANOUK, RGNU MEMBERS ATTACK USSR ON AID, SETTLEMENT ISSUES
 Dissatisfaction on the part of Sihanouk's government (RGNU) with
 the results of the 1-10 September visit to the USSR of a delega-
 tion of Sihanouk's Front (F[WK)'seems to be reflected in pointed
 remarks made by RGNU Premier Penn Nouth and RGNU "special envoy"
 long Sary during a recent tour of northwest China.# In a
 22 September speech in Yenan reported by NCNA, Ieng Sary con-
 demned the "design of certain big powers to control Cambodia
 under the pretext of extending aid."  He complained that "they
 want us to negotiate with the enemy, to compromise with and
 capitulate to the enemy, and give up our struggle," and he went
 on to affirm that "we will resolutely refuse such aid."
 Commenting at a banquet in Yenan on 22 September, according to
 NCNA, Penn Nouth said that the Cambodian people are willing to
 accept "unconditional, sincere aid," both material and moral,
 but that "the highest and most important aid" is the recogni-
 tion of the RGNU._ He went on to assert that the Cambodian
 people "resolutely oppose the scheme of U.S. imperialism to
 work in collusion with one or two big powers to bring about a
 compromise, hatch a peace-talks fraud.and split Cambodia's
 territory."  The Cambodians are determined, he said, to
 decide their own destiny; "big powsa's absolutely are not
 allowed to manipulate Cambodia's destiny."
 Earlier, in a 12 September speech in Urumehi, reported by NCNA,
 Penn Nouth accused "some countries" of "seriously harming" the
 Cambodian people's struggle by refusing to recognize the RGNU
 on the pretext that It is a "government in exile" or somehow
 divided from the "government at home."  This "subversion and.
 interference" in the country's internal affairs is "intolerable,"
 he said.  Speaking in Lanahaw on the 18th, he charged that U.S.
 imperialism has been "working in collusion with certain powers
 which call themselves friends of the Cambodian people" to "make
 a bargain through negotiations to solve the Cambodian question
 by means of compromise."  He added that the United States and
 its "big-power collaborators" are also. resorting to "subversion"

 to "split our National United Front from the inside," trying
 to "dispatch enemy agents and plant them in our Front both in
 our country and abroad so as to create contradictions and
 confusion."
 Prior to these speeches in northwest China, the periodic RGNU
 rejections of the idea of a conference had apparently made
 no polemical reference: to "big-power collaborators."  The
 RGNU animadversions were directed against the United States
 and its Phnom Penh "lackeys," or against those Western or
 Asian states that had made proposals for a conference.  A
 10 October 1970 PRC Government statement denouncing the for-
 mation of the Khmer Republic in Phnom Penh had scored the
 efforts "of U.S. imperialism and its collaborator" to
 sabotage the Cambodian people's struggle through the United
 Nations or other means, but Sihanouk did not echo such
 remarks in his denunciations at the time of U.S. efforts
 to make sure the Lon Nol government represented Cambodia in
 the UN.
 SIHANOUK'S       In his 27th "message to the Khmer nation,"
 27TH MESSAGE     carried by NCNA on 24 September, Sihanouk
 once again rejected the notion of a new
 Geneva conference or any other international conference on
 Cambodia.  Peking supports this stand and the legitimacy
 of the RGNU, he stressed, in contrast to "certain European
 powers" who propose a compromise solution.  He denounced
 Sirik Matak for having said, while visiting Washington in
 mid-August, that Cambodia must be included in any Ir..dcchina
 settlement and that Peking would soon drop its support of
 Sihanouk.  Stressing continued PRC support, Sihanouk quoted
 the 10 October 1970 PRC Government statement's expression of
 opposition to the efforts "of U.S. imperialism and its
 collaborator" to sabotage the Cambodian people's struggle.
 As he had done in a previous message (his 24th), Sihanouk
 asserted that President Nixon's forthcoming trip to Peking
 will not cause the PRC to change its position on Cambodia.
 He recalled that Chou En-lai, in his interview with James
 Reston, had reiterated Chinese opposition to a new Geneva
 conference and pointed out that Sihanouk had rejected such
 a conference in his 24th message.  "Categorically refusing"
 any international conference once again in the current
 message, Sihanouk said that peace can be realized in Cambodia
 only by the installation in Phnom Penh of the legitimate RGNU,
 and he scored those "rightists" who "jump at the promise of
 a 'third solution' to the Khmer problem by certain European
 powers, accomplices of U.S. imperialism."

 HUNGARY AND KOREA
 HUNGARIAN PRESIDENT WARNS DPRK AGAINST SOCIALIST "DISSENSION"
 Against the background of intensified Soviet bloc efforts to
 counter Chinese diplomatic initiatives and concern over Peking's
 invitation to President Nixon to visit the PRC, Hungarian
 President Pal Losonczi used his 15-21 September "official
 friendship visit" to the DPRK to warn the North Koreans about
 the dangers of attempts to foment "dissension" among the
 socialist countries.  His warning came in the wake of Kim
 I1-song's characterization of the President's projected visit
 as a victory for the PRC in a speech at a 6 August rally for
 the visiting Prince Sihanouk.*  An indication that Losonczi
 may have been playing a surrogate role for Moscow in warning
 of divisive activity was reinforced by reports that the
 Hungarian president stopped off in the Soviet Union on his
 way to and from the DPRK, meeting with Podgornyy in Moscow
 on his way home on 22 September.
 In a banquet speech on the 20th Losonczi, according to MTI,
 the Hungarian news agency, said that the visit had been
 "successful" and that a communique had been prepared that
 "faithfully reflects the agreements of our aims."  Yet no
 communique on the visit has been made public, which may
 indicate that the results w~:re less than satisfactory.  And
 although KCNA's brief reports of Losonezi's talks with Kim
 II-song and'Choe Yong-kon characterized them as being "friendly,"
 they did not mention comradeship or fraternity.  KCNA also
 supplied only summaries of Losonczi's speeches--which MTI
 carried in full--omitting his polemical remarks, and the
 Korean speakers themselves similarly avoided polemics..
 The sequence of events during Sihanouk's 22 July to 11 August
 visit to the DPRK suggested that the Prince's trip had been
 designed, at least in part, to convey Peking's reassurances to
 Pyongyang in the wake of the invitation to President Nixon.
 Sihanouk, in his 24th "message to the Khmer nation" issued
 on 30 July in North Korea, made the first move in explaining
 that the invitation did not mean any wavering of Peking's
 support for its allies.  See the TRENDS of 11 August, pages
 13-15.

 In his first toast at a banquet on the 15th, as reported by
 MTI, Losonczi implied that the forthcoming talks would be
 ?               difficult:  "We should have an exchange on views on all
 problems regarding the unity of action of the world's
 anti-imperialist forces. The idea of proletarian inter-
 nationalism and our common struggle make it imperative for
 us to exchange ideas and make our stands clear."
 Speaking in Hamhung on the 18th, according to MTI, Losonczi
 said that socialist unity is "particularly necessary now"
 when "intern::tional reaction led by U.S. imperialism is doing
 everything to  weaken socialism and the forces fighting for
 national liberation and to foment dissension, thus trying
 to reverse the wheel of history."  He added that "the most
 striking example of all this" is U.S. aggression in Indochina.
 KCNA's summary blandly noted that Losonczi said that "we
 attach very great importance to the unity and mutual cooperation
 among the socialist countries based on the lofty principles of
 Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism," and that
 he "expressed support" of the Indochinese peoples' struggle
 against U.S. aggression.
 At a Pyongyang rally on the 20th, according to MTI, Losonczi
 noted that the Korean and Hungarian people are fighting shoulder
 to shoulder against imperialism, and pointedly added that in
 this struggle "a particularly important'role is played by the
 first and strongest socialist power in the world, the Soviet
 Union."  Referring to the need for socialist unity, he said
 that "our party does everything in its power to attain this
 goal and opposes every disrupting attempt which weakens our
 anti-imperialist struggle."  He reiterated that Indochina
 is now one of the "principal theaters" of the anti-imperialist
 struggle and remarked that Hungary and the DPRK are united by
 the fact that they "both are doing their utmost to support"
 the Indochinese people.  KCNA reported his assertion that the
 Korean and Hungarian peoples are fighting shoulder to shoulder
 against imperialism, but predictably omitted his reference
 to the Soviet Union as well as his warning against "disrupting
 attempts."  It did report his assertion that Indochina is the
 "main arena" of the struggle against irperialism and that
 Hungary and the DPRK are united in supporting the peoples
 of Indochina.

 MTI reported that at a Pyongyang banquet on the 20th Losonczi
 pointedly L,ought Korea's own security interests into the
 picture, saying that the. importance of strengthening, socialist
 unity "is underlined by the fact that not too far from your
 homeland, in Indohhina," U.S. aggression is in full swing.
 !CCNA reported only that Losconzi "underscored the importance
 of strengthening the unity of all the anti-imperialist forces."
 At the same time, while warning of the danger of socialist
 disunity in the face of imperialist aggression, particularly
 in Indochina, Losonczi took pains to defend the Soviet Union's
 moves toward a detente with the West.  In his speeches in
 Hamhung and at the Pyongyang rally as carried by MTI he
 recalled that both world wars started in Europe and asserted
 that the Soviet and Polish treaties with West Germany and the
 recent four-power agreement on West Berlii are important in
 preventing another such war.  He added that these treaties
 have also opened the way for convening a European security
 conference.  KC".:A's summaries omitted h :LE references to the
 agreements on Germany and Berlin and reported that at the
 Pyongyang meeting he "referred to the problem of the convocation
 of a European security meeting," thus couching his remarks

 CHINA
 PEKING REMAINS MUM ON REASON FOR NATIONAL DAY CHANGES
 Through the evening of the 29th (Pekin3-time) , there had'teenw
 confirmation in official Chinese media of the statements by
 Foreign Ministry spokesmen to Western newsmen regarding the
 less elaborate celebration of National Day this year.  Western
 press speculation, that a Canton TV annoimeement of an upcoming
 Peking relay presaged' important reibelatioas proved false when
 the-'relay only transmitted' a Chines-Albania. .igymnae:tics.*1neet
 Several military leaders who are Politburo members, and usually
 active, have still made no public appearances in the nearly
 three weeks since anomalies in Peking's usual behavior became
 evident.
 A 28 September NCNA account of preparations for National Day
 in the city of Peking indicates that a festive holiday, with
 rejoicing celebrants, is still planned--which makes it most
 unlikely that any grave announcement concerning the health of
 Mao or Lin is to be expected.  While the item makes no mention
 of the traditional parade, it does note that the Tienanmen
 rostrum has been newly painted and the usual collection of
 huge potraits of historical personalities from Marx to Mao is
 in place.  Theatrical performances to be given will include
 not only the old revolutionary classics such as "The Red
 Lantern" but also several new operas and a new ballet.
 MOSCOW'S     The anomalies in China drew no propaganda attention
 REACTION     from Moscow until 24 September when a TASS dispatch
 seized on rumors published in the Japanese press
 to accuse the Chinese oagain using the threat of a Soviet
 "attack on Chinese territory" to cover up "acute internal
 political problems."  TASS said that the campaign is a new
 tem t to "inflame anti-Soviet feelings among the population"
 and part of a new  pre~r_eyouurself for war" drive in the PR
 The only hard evidence given for the allegation is an ASAHI
 report that leave for servicemen had been canceled.  Soviet
 broadcasts to Southeast Asia and to China have also picked up
 the theme that the Chinese are using the Soviet threat to hide
 internal difficulties, but the Soviets have not initiated a
 major propaganda campaign around the issue.

 BREZHNEV  IN YUGOSLAVIA
 Brezhnev's 22-25 September "unofficial, friendly" fence-mending
 visit to Belgrade produced what Tito, at the airport departure
 ceremony on tie 25th, described as "a thorough review of our
 entire relations" and a joint statement registering both
 sides' desire to relegate their differences to the background
 in their mutual pragmatic interests.  The joint statement
 puts on record the two sides' readiness to develop interstate
 and, more cautiously, interparty relations--severely strained
 by the invasion of Czechoslovakia and, more recently, by Soviet
 pressures on Romania and by what Belgrade has viewed as Soviet
 meddling in Yugoslav affairs.
 On Moscow's side, the rapprochement goes hand in hand with a
 general effort to shore up relations with as many countries
 as possible in preparation for a European security conference;
 and the Soviet decision to grant ideological concessions, in
 form if not in substance, registers the depth of Moscow's
 concern over Chinese inroads in the Balkans.  At the same
 time, Brezhnev's visit served to demonstrate to Peking and
 its allies that the USSR can still exert leverage in the area.
 Belgrade gained a new--if watered down--assurance from Moscow
 that interparty cooperation must be based on equality, as well
 as a new--if qualified--Soviet reaffirmation of Yugoslavia's
 rigr+ to develop its own brand of socialism.  The visit opened
 up for Tito the prospect of improved economic relations with
 Moscow, as well as a lessening of Yugoslav-Soviet tensions
 that could enhance domestic stability during the critical
 period of phaseout of his personal leadership.
 BACKGROUND OF THE VISIT: THE 1955-56 DOCINIENTS AND AFTER
 Yugoslavia has consistently held that the documents signed
 in Belgrade in 1955 and Moscow in 1956 encompass its basic
 minimal conditions for the development of state and party
 relations with the Soviet Union.  Signed on 2 June 1955 by
 the then Soviet Premier Bulgsnin sndPresident Tito, the
 Belgrade declaration represented the first major fruition
 of IQirushehev's effort to patch up the relations of open enmity
 that had followed Stalin's expulsion of Yugoslavia from the
 Cominform in 1948.  The document pledged "reciprocal respect
 for sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and

 29 SEPTEMBER 1971
 equality of the states in their relations with each other and
 with other states."  It also called for "mutual respect and
 noninterference in one another's internal affairs for whatever
 reason, whether of an economic, political or ideological nature,
 inasmuch as questions of internal organizations, difference of
 social systems and difference in the concrete forms of socialist
 development are exclusively the concern of the peoples of the
 respective countries."
 The 1955 document made no mention of party relations, the basis
 for which was subsequently spelled out in the Moscow declaration
 signed by Tito and I4irushchev in their capacities as party
 leaders..  The key passage of the 1956 declaration reads:
 Believing that the ways of socialist development vary in
 different countries and conditions, that the wealth of
 forms of the development of soc.Lalism contributes to its
 strength, and proceeding from the fact that either side
 holds alien any tendency to impose its views with regard
 to the ways and forms of socialist development, both
 sides have agreed that the aforesaid cooperation should
 be based on complete voluntariness and equality, friendly
 criticism, and comradely exchange of views on the
 contentious issues between our parties.
 Dealt a sharp setback by the Hungarian upheavel in November
 1956, Soviet-Yugoslav relations were again on the upturn in
 the early 1960's, when Khrushchev reaffirmed the policy of
 noninterference during a visit to Yugoslavia in 1962. The
 policy was reaffirmed in behalf of the post-Khrushchev
 leadership after an official Tito visit to Moscow from
 18 dune to 1 July 1965:  Loyalty to principles of noninter-
 ference as enunciated in the 1955 declaration was repledged
 in a communique signed by Brezhnev as CPSU First Secretary,
 Mikoyan as chairman of the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium,
 and Tito as Yugoslav party secretary and president.
 Three years later, relations plummeted to their lowest point
 since 1948 after the intervention in Czechoslovakia.  Four
 months before the Warsaw Five moved into Czechoslovakia,
 during a period of blatant Soviet pressures on the
 Czechoslovaks, a Tito visit to Moscow--en route home from
 Iran--produced no formal communique; TANYUG noted
 cryptically that "viewpoints" on party relations were
 exchanged.  Yugoslav propagandists were vocal after the

 intervention in decrying what they, like the West, termed the
 "Brezhnev doctrine" of limited sovereignty enunciated as an
 ex post facto rationale for the invasion--the concept that the
 socialist community has the right to intervene when it sees
 socialism threatened in any socialist country.  At the highest
 level, Tito commented at the 11-15 March 1969 Yugoslav party
 congress:  "In the name of the alleged higher interests of
 socialism, attempts have been made to justify even the open
 violation of the sovereignty of a socialist country and to
 resort to military force to prevent its independent development."
 The USSR and all of its East European allies except Romania
 boycotted the Yugoslav congress, against the background of
 polemical exchanges between Moscow and Belgrade.
 Moves to dispel  the hostility began with a state visit to
 Yugoslavia by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko in- the fall of
 1969 which produced a joint reaffirmation that the 1955 Belgrade
 document--on noninterference at the state level--was still
 valid.  The then Yugoslav Premier Ribicic visited Moscow in
 June 1970, and a joint communique on that visit again endorsed
 the principles set forth in the Belgrade declaration.  But the
 issue of party relations was still avoided.
 Yugoslav propaganda over the past year has registered concern
 over Soviet pressures on the Romanians and in recent months
 has reacted sharply to what Belgrade viewed as Soviet moves to
 capitalize on the turmoil generated in Yugoslavia by Tito's
 governmental reorga,-ization.  In June of this year the Yugoslav
 Foreign Ministry lodged a formal protest against anti-Yugoslav
 activity by "Cominformist emigres" in the Soviet Union.  A
 measure of restraint in the media of both sides--dating from
 Gromyko's 1969 visit--persisted through the c,sriod of such
 incidents.  But the freewheeling unofficial press and radio
 organs in Yugoslavia, particularly Zags-eb media, continued to
 air comment critical of Soviet bloc attitudes and behavior.
 Virtually on the eve of Brezhnev's visit to Belgrade, a Zagreb
 radio commentator sharply attacked an East German party
 Politburo report of 16 September, which warned Balkan communist
 countries against trafficking with the Chinese, as symptomatic
 of efforts by the Soviet "camp" to interfere in the Balkans.

 JOINT STATEMENT SETS CURRENT BASIS FOR PARTY, STA'T'E TIES
 The 25 September joint statement signed by Tito and Brezhnev
 caps the gradual, uneven progress toward a Yugoslav-Soviet
 r.apprinhement in the wake of the Czechoslovak events with a
 qualifL.ed reassertion of. principles-of equality in party ae: yell
 as state relations.  But the new modus vivendi for the current
 period falls short of that outlined in the Moscow declaration
 of 1956.
 The new document emerges as a compromise worked out in
 accommodation to post-Czechoslovakia realities.  It defines as
 the basis for cooperation "the closeness of historic destinies,
 identity of the foundations of social order, proximity of
 approaches to many international problems, loyalty to principles
 of socialist internationalism, the general struggle for peace,
 independence, and equal international cooperation and the
 struggle against imperialism."  The bow to "socialist inter-
 nationalism"--a concession from the Yugoslav side; the term
 did not appear in the 1955-56 documents--is balanced from the
 Soviet side by an affirmation that the development of
 bilateral relations "is based on the principles set forth"
 in the 1956 document on party relations as well as in those
 of 1955 and 1965.
 But the statement backs into the question of party equality by
 saying that the two governments and parties "strive for
 developing broad cooperation based on equality between countries
 and peoples," where the 1956 document had forthrightly endorsed
 the view that cooperation between the two parties should be
 based on "complete voluntariness and equality."  And the new
 statement calls only for "exchanges of views and consultations"
 between the two parties on bilateral relations and foreign policy,
 where the 1956 document had provided expansively for "comradely
 exchange of views on contentious issues between parties and
 friendly criticism"--a proviso the Yugoslavs could cite as
 justifying their 1968 criticisms of the Soviet move into
 Czechoslovakia.
 In a tortuous passage straddling the line between Moscow's rigid
 ideology and Belgrade's more flexible approach, the document
 affirms that "the LCY and the CPSU proceed from the fact that
 only the teaching of Marx, Engels, and'Lenin,-applied creatively
 and developed in consonance with the'distinctive characteristics
 of each country, can be the indispensable foundation,' both now
 and in the future, for the policy of the cummunist:and workers'

 parties . . . ."  Where the 1956 Moscow Declaration referred to
 "the wealth of forms of socialist development," this one states
 in more measured language that "the methods [not "forms"] used
 in constructing socialism, which reflect the experience and
 the specific aspects in the development of individual countries,
 are a matter for the peoples and working classes in individual
 countries and need not contradict each other."
 Both sides register their desire to develop cooperation in the
 economic, scientific, and cultural fields.  Both also register
 their desire to develop relations "on a reciprocal basis" in the
 fields of press, radio, television, and culture--an earnest of
 intent to remove a major irritant in bilateral relations.
 FOREIGN POLICY     Capitalizing on long-standing areas of
 agreement on foreign policy, the statement
 supports the struggles of the Arab peoples against "Israeli
 aggression" and condemns U.S. "aggression" in Indochina.  It
 also registers both sides' support for a European security
 conference and for "lasting peace and security in the Balkans,
 an important element of which would be the establishment of a
 nuclear free zone in the area."  Soviet support for a nuclear-
 free zone in the Balkans dates back to 1959.  On 30 May 1959,
 Khrushchev stated in a speech in Tirana that the USSR "and all
 socialist countries believe it is from here, from the Balkans,
 that the peoples must start a struggle with a view to preventing
 the establishment of rocket bases and the siting of atomic
 weapons on Balkan soil and in the Mediterranean basin."*  Elite
 and routine Soviet propaganda has continued to endorse the idea,
 but with decreasing frequency in recent years.  Prior to the
 Soviet-Yugoslav statement, the last high-level USSR endorsement
 of a nuclear-free Balkans appeared in an 8 September 1969 message
 from the Soviet leadership on Bulgarian National Day.  The last
 joint Soviet-Yugoslav document to endorse the proposal was the
 30 June 1965 communique on Tito's visit to Moscow, which said
 both sides favored nuclear-free zones in central Europe  and
 the Balkans and--like the current statement--supported the idea
 of a European security conference.
 *  Romania has also long been on record as supporting a nuclear-
 free zone in the Balkans, as part of a package of measures to
 make the Balkans an "area of peace and cooperation."

 Glossing over areas of discord on foreign policy insues, the
 joint statement resorts to a stock Soviet formula on nonalint-
 ment:  "The Soviet side supports the anti-imperialist
 orientation of the policy of nonalined countries . . . and
 positively assesses their role in the struggle against
 colonialism and neocolonialism."  This is the theme Moscow
 customarily plays in its comment on nonalined summit meetings,
 while in comment on the behavior incumbent on socialist states
 it argues that there can be no neutrality in the class struggle.
 Beyond an expression of support for restoring the PRC's
 rights in the United Nations, there is predictably no mention
 of China, with which Yugoslavia has recently developed cordial
 state relations.
 TITO. BREZI-1EV SPEECHES REFLECT FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES
 Differences between the two countries were acknowledged and their
 differing concepts of socialist relations were brought into
 particularly sharp relief in an exchange of toasts between Tito
 and Brezhnev at a dinner on the 22d.
 TITO     The Yugoslav President reiterated Belgrade's desire for
 "friendly, all-round and permanently stable relations"
 with the Soviet Union despite past "misunderstandings and
 differences," but he made it clear that such relations could not
 be at the expense of Yugoslav's sovereignty or nonalinement.
 Noting that there are possibilities for developing economic,
 scientific, and cultural cooperation--pointedly leaving out
 "political," which Brezhnev just as pointedly said "could be more
 substantial and regular"--he said these relations could develop
 "above all on the basis of mutual respect for independence,
 sovereignty, territorial integrity and noninterference in inter-
 nal affairs..., principles embodied in the UN Charter... and deeply
 embedded in Yugoslavia's entity as an independent and nonalined
 country."
 In effect rejecting the Soviet view of "socialist internationalism,"
 Tito remarked that the current "ferment" in international relations
 points up "the untenability of monopolistic positions, outdated
 forms of economic and political relations."  With Romanian as well as
 Yugoslav interests clearly in mind, he went on call on the socialist
 countries to "set an example" in international relations through
 actions "in which the use of force, pressure, and interference in
 internal affairs will be eliminated, while the free development

 of peoples and countries and thea.r participation on an equal
 basis in the activities of the wider international community
 will be mane possible."  He added pointedly:  "International
 cooperation cannot make progress if based on any monopoly or
 negation of the legitimate interests and rights of individual
 countries," and he lectured that "all countries should take
 part in the affairs of the international community, irrespective
 of their strength or size, since this is their inalienable
 right. ..  ."
 Reaffirming the Yugoslav and Romanian view of European security,
 Tito declared:  "It goes without saying that lasting peace and
 security in Europe presuppose a system of relations which insure
 for all European countries full independence and inviolability
 of frontiers and protection against aggression, the use of
 force, pressure or the threat of force."  In this context, he
 went on to reaffirm Yugoslav support for a European security
 conference in which "all European countries should take part
 on an equal footing."
 Turning to the domestic scene, Tito assured his guest that
 Yugoslavia's self-management brand of socialism has been
 strengthened by. the recent coiititytiorial -,ehwges and?=that.:W
 party is in firm control in implementing them.  During the
 period of political turmoil preceding the governmental
 reorganization last summer, Brezhnev had told the 24th CPSU
 congress in March that "the Soviet people wanted to see
 socialism in Yugoslavia strengthened and her ties with the
 socialist community grow stronger."
 BREZHNEV     The Soviet leader remarked in his answering toast
 that "we would not be realists if we did not see
 that the heritage of the years when Soviet-Yugoslav relations
 were seriously clouded continues to affect certain things today"
 and that "the task.- facing us are not simple."  Alleging that
 unnamed "forces" were trying to exacerbate Yugoslav-Soviet
 differences, Brezhnev sought to counter the idea that the
 Soviet Union harbors aggressive intentions in the Balkans.  In
 line with earlier Soviet leadership statements, he said it was
 these unnamed forces that "circulated the fable about a so-called
 doctrine of limited sovereignty and spread rumors about Soviet
 armies allegedly being prepared to move into the Balkans and
 many other tales."
 Insistence that the Soviet Union adheres to a policy of
 noninterference has from the outset gone hand in hand with
 enunciation of what has come to be known in the West as the

 doctrine of limited sovereignty.  Advancing the concept in a
 speech to the fifth Polish party congress on 12 November 1968,
 Brezhnev declared that the socialist states stand for "strict
 respect for sovereignty and nonynterference in internal affairs,"
 and then went on to argue that "military aid to a fraternal
 country" is justified because "when a threat to the cause of
 socialism" in that country occurs, "it is no longer only a
 problem for the people of that country but also a common concern
 for all the socialist states."  Foreign Minister Gromyko engaged
 in similar semantic sleight of hhnd in his speech to the USSR
 Supreme Soviet on 10 July 1969:  Decrying the "slander" that
 the socialist states "advocate some kind of limited sovereignty,"
 he went on to argue that "the content of the term sovereignty"
 is fully expressed in "the people's right to lean on the support
 of their friends who are faithful to their international duty."
 The most recent denial by a Soviet leader came from Kosygin in
 a preelection speech on 10 June 1970, when he denounced "the
 inventions concocted by the bourgeois press and radio . . .
 about a rejection of other socialist countries' sovereignty."
 Brezhnev thus drew on a long-standing background of Soviet
 leader statements--echoed in routine propaganda--in his denial
 in Yugoslavia that the Soviet Union puts limits on sovereignty.
 Citing the same unnamed "forces" which he said had circulated
 the "fable" about the limited-sovereignty doctrine, he derided
 the view "that Yugoslavia is some sort of grey zone and that
 it is 'going over to the West,'" stopping short of calling
 Yugoslavia "socialist."  He declared:  "I do not think it is
 worth wasting time refuting all these slanderous concoctions;
 however, they remind us that the cause of Soviet-Yugoslav
 friendship needs to be defended . . . time and time again."
 He reaffirmed that "Soviet-Yugoslav" relations are based on
 the 1955 and 1956 joint documents, but he in effect qualified
 his support for the substance of the documents by stating that
 "what matters now is how these principles, under present
 conditions, can be implemented in a fuller and broader way."
 He did not generalize on the principles that should govern
 relations among all socialist states--the point of Tito's
 remarks in the toast to which he was replying.
 Addressing Yugoslav workers at a factory on 23 SepteLiber,
 Brezhnev made a stronger affirmation of party equality than
 was agreed to in the joint statement, declaring that cooperation
 between the Soviet and Yugoslav states and parties is based on
 "full equality and mutual respect."  And on the sensitive issue

 29 SEPTINBER 1971
 of differing types of socialism, he acknowledged in that speech
 that the Yugoslav variety "does not appear acceptable to the
 Soviet communists . . . because we have our own traditions and
 experience, and they suit both our concept of socialism and
 our conditions."  He went on in effect to qualify the formula
 on different approaches to socialism in the joint statement,
 referring to the "general laws" governing the building of
 socialism without which "there can be no socialism."*
 Granting that "the selection of concrete forms of organization
 of social life is, however, an internal affair of each
 communist party and people," Brezhnev assured the Yugoslav
 workers that the Soviet Union opposes anyone's effort to
 "impose his own concrete methods of development on others."
 But elsewhere in the speech he came close to reasserting
 the right to monitor socialism that is at the heart of the
 doctrine he denied existed:  Stating that the Soviet Union's
 foreign political line is clear, he said "we firmly protect
 the interests of socialism against all its enemies."
 In concluding remarks at the airport on the 25th, Brezhnev
 said "we have done some good and useful work" and pronounced the
 visit "a success."  The Yugoslav leader remarked less categorically
 that the talks had "cleared up many things," that "the documents
 adopted reflect the talks we held and much more," and that "we
 have reached a united view as to what we still must do . . . ."
 A brief communique on the visit issued simultaneously with the
 joint statement says Tito accepted an invitation to visit Moscow
 at an unspecified future date.
 *  He had gone on to enumerate the "laws" in addressing the
 Polish party congress on 12 November 1968.  Asserting the right
 of socialist countries to correct deviations from "the common
 laws governing socialism" wherever they may occur, he explained
 that socialism can only be victorious "if the communist party, as
 the guilding force of society, firmly carries through a Marxist-
 Leninist policy in the development of all spheres of public life;
 only if the party indefatigably strengthens the defense of the
 country, the defense of its revolutionary gains; if it maintains
 ittelf and propagates amidst the people vigilance with regard to
 the class enemy, irreconcilability to bourgeois ideology; only
 if the principle of social4.st internationalism is being sacredly
 observed and the unity and fraternal solidarity with other
 socialist countries is being strengthened."

 AFTERMATH OF THE VISIT:  REASSURANCE TO MOSCOW'S BLOC-ALLIES
 Brezhnev made unheralded stopovers in Budapest on 25-26 September
 and in Sofia on the 26th and 27th en route home from Belgrade,
 apparently to fill in his bloc allies on the Soviet interpretation
 of the new Belgrade statement and the discussions with Tito.
 Communiques issued after both visits were predictably vague on
 the substance of the talks, recording "full identity" of views
 on,"international" questions and unspecified questions relating
 to the world communist movement.
 Against the background of the strains in Belgrade-Sofia relations
 over the perennial question of Macedonia, which has recently
 resurfaced in the media of both countries, the communique on
 the Sofia visit refers twice to "complete unity" between the
 Soviet and Bulgarian parties.  It also contains what seems a
 gratuitous assurance, in view of Sofia's closeness to Moscow,
 that relations between the two parties are marked by "profound
 trust."  There is no reference to Brezhnev's Belgrade visit in
 either the Sofia or the Budapest communique.
 MOSCOW       Followup Soviet comment on the Brezhnev visit to
 COPWIENT     Yugoslavia has been restrained, pointing to the
 existence of past differences and forecastinga
 more "stable" basis now for the development of Soviet-Yugoslav
 cooperation.  The term most frequently used to characterize the
 visit is "useful." A low-keyed PRAVDA editorial on the visit
 on the 27th avoided the sensitive question of "limited-sovereignty,"
 rather stressing Moscow's dedication to "socialist internationalism"
 and cautiously describing the USSR and Yugoslavia as "two sovereign.
 states" belonging to "a single sociopolitical formation."  Other
 Soviet comment echoed Brezhnev's 23 September remark that "the
 principal thing is that our countries belong-to the same socio-
 economic formation"; a 27 September domestic service report on
 a Moscow meeting of the Soviet-Yugoslav commission:for scientific
 and technical cooperation saw enhanced. prospects for cooperation
 "in the CEMA framework" arising from the Soviet-Yugoslav joint
 statement.
 In routine-level radio comment, Moscow has repeated for the
 domestic audience Brezhnev's remarks on the 23d about "general
 laws" governing the building of socialism and has reiterated
 to domestic and foreign audiences--including the Romanians--
 denials of "cock-and-bull stories" about the limited-sovereignty

 ROMMIA LIBERA to the effect that the visit will "make a

 and international security."
 EAST EUROPEAN     Hungary and East Germany, the two countries
 COMMENTARIES      whose media have been the chief purveyors of
 warnings to Balkan communist countries about
 trafficking with the Chinese, have been vocal in denouncing
 inventions about "the so-called doctrine of limited sovereignty."
 One Budapest broadcast on the 23d, to Western Europe, said that
 in stressing the validity of the 1955 and 1956 Soviet-Yugoslav
 declarations, "Brezhnev with a single gesture swept away the
 favorite fabrication" of "imperialist propaganda"    limited
 sovereignty.
 East German propaganda includes attacks on the West Germans as
 authors of "fairy tales" about limited sovereignty.  An East
 German commentary by a correspondent in Belgrade on the 24th
 observed that the USSR's "correct attitude" on the question of
 sovereignty "has been appreciated from the Yugoslav side, and
 it is to be hoped that this objective assessment will be
 generally communicated."  The commentary went beyond PRAVDA
 and Brezhnev in observing that "Yugoslavia has its natural
 hinterland in the socialist community" and that "this is
 objectively independent of the degree to which the thinking
 of the Yugoslav leadership goes in this direction."  Echoing.
 Brezhnev at the 24th CPSU congress, the commentator concluded
 with a reference to Moscow's desire "to strengthen socialism"
 in Yugoslavia.
 Sofia's comment on the Soviet leader's Belgrade visit has been
 limited.  Comment from Prague and Warsaw has skirted the
 issue of limited sovereignty, indulging largely in platitudes
 about the failure of hostile elements to sow seeds of
 dissension in the Balkans.
 ROMANIAN           The major available comment on the visit from
 REACTION           Bucharest media was contained in an inter-
 national review by foreign affairs commentator
 Caplescu in SCINTEIA on the 25th, largely devoted to the UN
 General Assembly session.  The article restructured the emphasis
 in Brezhnev's factory ,3peech of the 23c , reporting that "the
 Soviet leader pointed out that taking into account the existence
 of general laws" of socialism "is an internal question of each

 It registered Romanian "satisfaction" with the visit as in
 keeping with 8U harest's advocacy of leader-to-leader discussion
 of differences on a basis of equality and "regardless of the
 diversity of stands,"  As reported by?AGERPREB,-the article did
 not relate Brezhnev's visit directly to the jituation in the
 Balkans but said it will serve "the general cause of peace."
 Romanian coverage reflected concern not to seem to overplay the
 visit.  AGERPRES' review of the Romanian press on the 27th
 mentioned only at the end of a long list of topics that "the
 newspapers carry passages from the Yugoslav-Soviet statement
 and report on Leonid Ilich Brezhnev's visits to Hungary and
 Bulgaria."

 GERMANY
 GDR. USSR SUSTAIN CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO FINNISH PROPOSAL
 971
 Very limited East German and Soviet comment on the 10 September
 Finnish Government proposal to establish full diplomatic relations
 with both German states continues to reflect caution.  East Berlin
 and Moscow both still avoid any reference to the call in the
 proposal for negotiations on settlement of damages caused by
 German troops in Finland in 1944-45, and both continue to ignore
 Helsinki's stipulation that its treaties with the two German
 states must come into force simultaneously.*  In keeping with
 the GDR Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement of receptivity
 to the proposal on 11 September, asserting East German readiness
 to enter into negotiations without: mentioning the FRG, both
 have also ignored Bonn's "provisional" reply on the 27th that
 the Federal Government will continue to study the proposal.
 Moscow has publicized the GDR reaction but has avoided committing
 itself.  A favorable official Soviet attitude was made known
 only indirectly in a 17 September Helsinki radio interview with
 Finnish Defense Minister Gestrin after his return from a five-day
 visit to the USSR, during which he met with Podgornyy.  Asked if
 they had discussed the proposal, Gestrin replied:  "This matter
 was also discussec.; President Podgornyy expressed his appreciation
 for thia initiative and mentioned that the Soviet Government takes
 a very positive stand on this."  Moscow media gave no details on
 the substance of the Podgornyy-Gestrin talk.
 An approach that would apparently be congenial to Moscow and
 East Berlin was enunciated at an 18-19 September plenary meeting
 of the Finnish Communist Party (SKP) Central Committee which,
 according to the Helsinki radio, called on the Finnish Government
 not to make normalization of relations with the GDR dependent on
 the stand Bonn takes toward the Finnish proposal and urged that
 each German state be dealt with separately.  Moscow's reluctance
 to get into any details of the Finnish Government proposal was
 manifest in its coverage of the party plenum:  Soviet reports
 highlighted the SKP stand on a European security conference and
 its pro-Soviet stand in the Sino-Soviet dispute, mentioning other
 international issues but leaving out the question of the Finnish
 proposal entirely.

 Two authoritative PRAVDA commentators, Yuriy Zhukov on the 14th
 and Viktor Mayevskiy on the 24th, referred to the Finnish proposal
 without indicating the issues involved.  In a discussion of
 prospects for European detente and East-West cooperation following
 the quadripartite agreement on Berlin, Zhukov merely said "a
 widespread response" had been aroused by the proposal to establish
 diplomatic relations between "Finland and the two German states--
 the FRG and the GDR--and to reach agreement on a number of other
 questions."  In a discussion of the Brezhnev-Brandt talks in the
 Crimea, Mayevskiy remarked in a similar vein that the Finnish
 "readiness to normalize fully relations with the GDR and PEG has
 had widespread repercussions" and that the GDR has agreed to
 begin such negotiations.  Only in two routine Moscow radio
 broadcasts--both in Finnish--has Moscow offered any actual
 comment:  One radio commentator on the 15th told Finnish listeners
 the proposal was a "very important event" corresponding to the
 reality of two German states; another on the 23d said Helsinki
 had made another "contribution" to the improvement of European
 relations in offering to establish diplomatic relations with the
 GDR.
 OFFICIAL GDR REPLY     Following up the GDR Foreign Ministry
 spokesman's statement of the llth, the GDR
 Council of Ministers on the 15th officially "welcomed" the
 Finnish decision "to enter into negotiations with the GDR
 Government on regulating relations between the two states" and
 said it had "decided to inform" the Finnish Government of the
 GDR Government's "official consent" to such negotiations.  NEUES

 course of a discussion of the German phase of the Berlin negotia-

 "territorial changes."

 FRG - CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 HUSAK REPEATS STAND ON MUNICH; THIRD EXPLORATORY TALKS HELD
 CPCZ General Secretary husak repeated the basic, long-standing
 Czechoslovak stand on the nonvalidity of the Munich agreement
 ab initio at a joint meeting of the CPCZ Central Committee and
 the CSSR National Front on 17 September--in a speech containing
 his first endorsement of the four-power Berlin accord signed on
 the 3d and his first public discussion of FRG-Czechoslovak rela-
 tions since the signing.  His formulation on Munich was in
 keeping with the pattern followed since the release of the
 2 August communique on the Soviet bloc summit talks in the
 Crimea, which modified the Czechoslovak call for West German
 recognition of "the nonvalidity of the Munich agreement
 ab initio and all the consequences arising therefrom" by
 dropping the underlined phrase.  A spate of Czechoslovak
 press articles since the signing of the Berlin agreement
 had either modified the formulation on the pattern of the
 Crimea communique or omitted any reference to the Munich
 agreement in discussing FRG-Czechoslovak relations.*
 Welcoming the "agreement on West Berlin" and the effect it
 may have on ratification of the Moscow and Warsaw treaties
 with Bonn, on a European security conference, and on relations
 between the FRG and the socialist countries, Husak said on the
 17th:  "We believe these circumstances could also favorably
 influence our talks with the FRG, which will be continued in
 Prague at the end of this month.  However, th, normalization
 of our relations with the FRG requires that the FRG Govern-
 ment adopt an unequivocal attitude with regard to the
 nonvalidity ab initio of the shameful Munich diktat."
 (Curiously, a TASS summary of Husak's speech, delivered
 while Brandt was meeting with Brezhnev in the Crimea, failed
 to mention the remarks on Munich and the Prague-Bonn talks,
 although it reported the other details of Husak's foreign
 policy comments.)
 In keeping with Husak's avoidance of the Munich agreement
 issue in his several previous speeches following the 3 September
 signing of the Berlin agreement, Strougal also ignored the
 issue in an 11 September speech in which he suggested that

 the agreement had brought an improved atmosphere for the develop-
 ment of FRG-Czechoslovak relations.  Noting that the talks with
 Bonn "on normalization of mutual relations" would resume at the
 end of September, Strougal added:  "We hope that the relatively
 hopeful attitude which has prevailed in Europe in the past few
 months will favorably influence the course of these negotiations
 as well."
 Following the Brezhnev-Brandt talks in the Crimea, the Czecho-
 slovak press has repeatedly expressed hope that the Crimea talks
 would help create "better conditions" for the exploratory talks
 with Bonn.  The Bratislava PRAVDA on the 20th hoped for a demonstra-
 tion of West German "realism" in the Prague talks on the lines of
 Brandt's approach in his meetings with Brezhnev.  MLADA FRONTA on
 the 22d looked forward to the next round in the exploratory talks
 "with a certain degree of optimism."  Only the Prague trade union
 daily PRACE on the 25th brought up the Munich issue:  It remarked
 that West German elements opposing ratification of the Moscow and
 Warsaw treaties--neglecting to mention that Brandt is holding up
 ratification pending implementation of the Berlin accord--are in
 the "front ranks of the defenders of Munich."  It argued that to
 recognize the Munich agreement as legal and valid under law, if
 only "at the moment of the signing," is to acknowledge that
 Czechoslovakia was "legally and validly smashed" and that the
 suffering endured by the Czechoslovaks at the hands of the Nazis
 was also legal and valid under law.  Maintaining that "a
 politician who wants to be regarded as realistic cannot demand
 such a thing," PRACE went on to say that Brandt "has repeatedly
 shown recently that he wants to be regarded as a realistic
 politician," as demonstrated by his trip to the Crimea.

 was held in "an open, businesslike atmosphere."  It noted both
 sides "affirmed their readiness to conclude a treaty on
 normalization of relations between the two countries," adding
 that a date will be set later for the next round.  The West
 German DPA reported on the 28th that Frank told newsmen the
 next meeting wouJri "probably" be held in Bonn at the beginning
 of November.  He also said the two sides had not found "a
 common formula" on the Munich agreement, although there was
 "a certain meeting of the minds."

 GROMYKO DRAWS ON STOCK THEMES IN FOREIGN POLICY REVIEW
 1971
 In his annual foreign policy review before the United Nations
 General Assembly (UNGA), Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko on
 28 September draws on stock propaganda themes in stressing the
 peaceful orientation of the USSR's "Leninist" foreign policy.
 (While text of the speech is not yet available, it has been
 summarized and excerpted by TASS.)  Gromyko observes that the
 general line of Soviet policy was most recently affirmed at the
 24th CPSU Congress last spring when "a broad program of peace
 and international cooperation, dealing with all the major facets
 of the task of preserving peace," was outlined.  He pays the
 usual obeisance to the policy of peaceful coexistence; at a
 later point in his address he stresses the importance of
 preventing a new world war, noting that this task is dependent
 on the state of relations among nations of all regions of the
 world.  And he points to the urgency of sustaining the struggle
 for disarmament and against the burgeoning arms race which is
 resulting in massive expenditures.
 On U.S.-Soviet relations, Gromyko says that the USSR is ready to
 develop contacts and to seek mutually acceptable solutions, but
 will not adapt its fundamental line in the international arena
 or its "firm policy of peace to various considerations of a
 temporary nature."  And he deplores the efforts of "powerful
 states to impose their will upon those whom they consider
 weaker," concluding that such actions are responsible for the
 events in Indochina and the Middle East.
 DISARMAMENT     Gromyko follows up his letter of 6 September to
 U Thant, in which he requested that the issue of
 a world disarmament conference be placed on the UNGA agenda, by
 introducing a draft resolution stressing the urgency of such a
 conference.  The draft document and Gromyko in his introductory
 remarks note the desirability of agreement on the date and the
 agenda for the conference before the end of 1972.  (In his
 24 September 1965 UNGA address Gromyko said that such a con-
 ference should be convened "in the middle of 1966.")  Going
 beyond his letter to U Thant, Gromyko suggests that the con-
 ference could be made "a permanent forum or . . . a forum
 operating over a long period of time.  Its sessions may be
 called periodically, say once in two or three years."  He urges

 that the conference be held outside the framework of the United
 Nations to assure its universality.  As routine propaganda has
 done over the past three weeks, Gromyko assures his audience that
 the convocation of the conference "should in.no way diminish the
 significance of the forums and channels for disarmament negotia-
 tions which are now being used," including the 26-.ration Geneva
 disarmament talks.
 In addition to his remarks on a world disarmament conference,
 Gromyko recalls the Soviet proposal formalized last June for a
 conference of the five nuclear powers to discuss nuclear disarma-
 ment.                   He notes that France supported the Soviet initiative but
 that "another nuclear power" took a negative position and the
 other two powers contended that under these circumstances the
 question of a five-power conference was academic.  Gromyko does
 not identify the PRC as the nuclear power taking the negative
 position although Soviet propaganda has not been reticent on
 this matter since release of the formal Chinese rejection of
 the proposal in early August.
 Gromyko mentions past arms control agreements, including the
 nonproliferation treaty and the partial test-ban treaty, observing
 that it would be wrong to believe that nothing has been done
 to curb the arms race.  He goes on to touch on partial disarmament
 measures which have been advanced by the USSR, citing specifically
 the call for a ban on underground nuclear tests, the creation of
 nuclear-free zones "in various regions of the world," the closing
 of foreign military bases, and the banning of bacteriological and
 chemical weapons.  Pointing to growing recognition of the need
 to take measures to prevent accidental or deliberately provoked
 incidents involving nuclear weapons, Gromyko notes that this
 goal "is served by a corresponding accord recently achieved
 between the USSR and the United States."
 While Gromyko does not acknowledge that the U.S.-Soviet agreement
 concerning incidents in which nuclear weapons are involved was
 reached at the strategic arms limitation talks (SALT) in
 Helsinki, he follows his remarks on this agreement with a
 brief discussion of SALT, now in recess until 15 November.*

 EUROPEAN     In his rundown of developments in Europe, Gromyko
 SECURITY     welcomes the 3 September signing of the four-power
 agreement on "West Berlin," the^.onclusion by Bonn
 of treaties with Moscow and Warsaw, and the developing under-
 standing between Francs and the USSR.  But he goes ?.)n state
 that what has been achieved in Europe and what is being done,
 while substantial, by no means solve all the problems.  Questions
 remain which should be solved by joint efforts and for this
 reason, he observes, the time is ripe for the calling of a
 European security conference, as proposed by the socialist
 states.  As he had done in his speech before the Assembly last
 year, he affirms that the United States and Canada could
 participate.
 Gromyko says convening of a conference would serve to hasten
 the disbanding of military blocs in Europe.  And he repeats
 the longstanding Soviet pledge of readiness to agree "without
 delay" to the liquidation of military blocs or, as a first
 step, "at least their military organizations."  Gromyko had
 affirmed this pledge just over two months ago in a 13 July
 letter to U Thant; and Brezhnev had stated it in his 30 March
 report at the 24th CPSU Congress.
 Gromyko briefly mentions the Soviet proposal -- surfaced by
 Brezhnev in his 30 March report -- for the opening of talks on
 troop and arms reductions in Europe, noting that "many agree"
 to this proposal.  Consistent with routine and elite propaganda
 since March, he does not  cite the proposal as an agenda item at
 a European security conference, thus leaving the question of a
 forum open.
 MIDDLE     Gromyko treats the Middle East situation in largely
 EAST       routine fashion and in far less detail than in last
 year's address.  He levels the customary attack against
 Israel and its "patrons" who stand in opposition to the "legitimate
 rights" of the Arab states and the return of the "forcibly
 seized" territories.  He charges that Israel is interested only
 in an "annexationist peace" and notes that it has gone "too far
 in baring its plans for the seizure of occupied territories to
 obtain support in the international arena."  And he declares
 that Israel has paralyzed the Jarring mission.
 Gromyko says that the United Nations is still in a position to
 make a contribution to a Middle East settlement "provided it does
 not limit itself to the adoption of yet another resolution

 expressing good desires without reinforcing them with effective
 measures, and provided it utilizes the full scope of its
 capacities" in accordance with its Charter. On the question
 of assuring Israel that its security would not be endangered
 by withdrawal from all occupied territories, Groniyko says that
 "appropriate guarantees, including guarantees by the Security
 Council, can be provided . . . .  These are the strongest
 guarantees conceivable in the modern world."  While Gromyko
 stops short of reaffirming Moscow's readiness to participate
 in such guarantees, routine propaganda has noted the USSR's
 willingness to take part.
 MEMBERSHIP     In line with current routine propaganda, Gromyko
 ISSUE          reaffirms Soviet support for Peking's representa-
 tion in the United Nations.  According to him,
 the USSR has opposed "unlawful actions with regard to the
 Chinese island of Taiwan," the denial of China's "lawful rights"
 in the United Nations, and the "so-called two China's concept
 and any concepts of 'double representation of China."'  This is
 .'a position of principle," he says, and the USSR will follow it
 at the UNGA session.*  Gromyko had called for the restoration of
 the PRC's rights in the United Nations in his speech last year
 and in all previous years except 1969.
 In addition to his call for PRC representation in the world body,
 Gromyko routinely repeats the long-standing call for the
 admission of both the GDR and the FRG.
 / to
 *  Extensive Peking propaganda on the Chinese representation issue
 focuses currently on the U.S. "maneuvering" to retain a seat for
 Taiwan.  The propaganda fanfare is highlighted by a widely publi-
 cized PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article on 25 September.  Taking
 up the theme of the 20 August PRC Government statement on the
 representation issue, it says flatly that the PRC "will absolutely
 have nothing to do with the United Natioais if a situation of 'two
 Chinas,' 'one China, one Taiwan,' 'the status of Taiwan remaining
 to be determined,' or any other similar situation should occur."

 KOREA     Judging by the TABS summary, Gromyko passed over the
 Korean issue briefly.  Calling for an end to inter-
 ference in the internal affairs of the Korean people, he said
 the United Nations should stop serving as a "screen to cover
 up the foreign occupation of South Korea."  His failure to make
 the usual demand for the withdrawal of "all foreign troops in
 South Korea" and the disbanding of UNCURK stems apparently from
 the pact that this year, in a departure from past practice, the
 item on the "Korean question" has been deleted from the UNGA
 agenda.

 STRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION
 USSR REPORTS HELSINKI ACCORDS. GROMYKO STRESSES ABM PROBLEM
 In keeping with its low-keyed.treatment of the negotiations over
 the past two months, Moscow has devoted limited propaganda to the
 wind-up of the fifth round of the strategic arms limitation talks
 (SALT) on 24 September.  Soviet media on the 24th promptly
 transmitted the text of the joint communique announcing that U.S.
 and Soviet negotiators in Helsinki, in accordance with the 20 May
 agreement,* studied the possibility of reaching an accord on
 ABM's as well as questions concerned with limiting offensive
 strategic weaponry.  The communique also stated that "other
 related questions" were studied and that the latest rc'lnd of
 talks, which began on 8 July, resulted in a clearer understanding
 of questions to be solved when the negotiations resume in Vienna
 on 15 November.
 A brief TASS dispatch on the 24th, some six hours after the release
 of the communique, noted without comment that the talks in Helsinki
 resulted in two understandings:  one concerning adoption by the
 two sides of measures to prevent accidental or unsanctioned use
 of nuclear weapons under their control, and the other concerning
 measures to improve the U.S.-Soviet hotline through the use of
 earth satellites.  These agreements, TASS said, will be signed on
 30 September when Foreign Minister Gromyko meets Secretary Rogers
 in Washington.  A domestic service commentary cn the 27th,
 reviewing the USSR's "peace program" outlined at the 24th CPSU
 Congress last spring, took brief note of the agreement aimed at
 preventing accidental use of nuclear weapons but said nothing
 about the one on the hotline.  Soviet propaganda had ignored a
 13 September New York TIMES report that U.S. and Soviet experts
 at SALT had reached agreement on the handling of nuclear
 accidents and the improvement of the hotline.
 Gromyko, in his 28 September, speech before the United Nations
 General Assembly, took note of a "recent" U.S.-Soviet agreement
 concerning measures to prevent accidental or deliberately
 provoked incidents involving nuclear weapons, but he did not
 *  Unlike the current communique, which was issued in Helsinki by
 the U.S. and Soviet delegations, the 20 May agreement in Vienna
 was read by President Nixon to a national radio and TV audience.
 The USSR routinely carried the agreement in its newscasts, and
 only on the following day did it acknowledge that the President
 had announced the accord.

 acknowledge that the accord was reached at SALT.  He did,
 however, promptly follow these remarks with a brief discussion
 of SALT, the first elite reference to the negotiations since
 Brezhnev's 11 June pre-election speech.  He said the negotiators
 are concentrating on an agreement on ABM's, warning that if an
 extension of this defensive system is not stopped now, a chain
 reaction of competition between offensive and defensive weapons
 will "inevitably" be triggered off.  As elite spokesmen have
 done in the past, Gromyko concluded that the talks must be
 conducted on the basis of "equal security."
 Chief Soviet negotiator Semenov, in his departure statement in
 Helsinki on the 26th reported by TASS, failed to mention either
 of the two agreements reached at SALT, confining himself to the
 general observation that "useful work" has been carried on and

 JAPAN  CP
 JCP ENDS MOSCOW VISIT AS QUARREL WITH CCP INTENSIFIES
 A joint CPSU-JCP communique, published on 28 September in PRAVDA
 and AKAHATA, marked the end of a week's discussions between
 delegations of the two parties.  The Moscow visit was the last
 leg of a six-week official trip which had already taken the JCP
 delegation, led by Chairman Kenji Miyamoto, to Romania, Italy
 and North Vietnam in an apparent effort to lessen the JCP'3
 isolation from major communist parties amid continuing
 deterioration of official relations with the CCP.
 Talks between Miyamoto and Politburo member Suslov were held
 from 19-26 September; Brezhnev met with the JCP delegation
 on 20 September.  The communique stated that the talks were
 held in a "frank and comradely atmosphere," the same phraseology
 used to describe talks held between the two parties last March
 when the JCP decided to attend the 24th CPSU Congress in Moscow.
 In keeping with the tone of recently issued joint statements
 with the Romanian, Italian and Spanish communist parties, the
 communique with the CPSU stresses the need for "independence,
 equality of rights and noninterference in each others internal
 affairs."  It also calls for "joint actions against the forces
 of aggression and war, and primarily against American
 imperialism"--which will in turn, it is argued, serve to
 strengthen "the unity of the international communist movement."
 (As reported in the TRENDS last week, the communique on the
 talks between the JCP and the Vietnam Workers Party failed to
 mention the issue of communist unity.)
 SPLIT BETWEEN    Just before the JCP delegation left Tokyo on
 CCP AND JCP      19 August, AKAHATA stepped up its attacks on the
 CCP.  On 16 August, for example, AKAHATA
 complained of continuing "great-power chauvinist intervention
 in the democratic movement in Japan by a certain group in the
 CCP."  On the 18th AKAHATA responded to the "slanderous"
 charges made against the JCP by Chou En-lai in his 10 August
 New York TIMES interview with James Reston and firmly argued
 against Chou's assertation that the JCP was the only Japanese
 opposition party refusing to recognize the danger of a revival
 of militarism in Japan.

 Just one day before the JCP delegation arrived in Hanoi, AKAIIATA,
 on 9 September, published a lengthy treatise, setting forth the
 thesis that full responsibility for the deterioriation of
 interparty relations rests with the CCP.  The article reviewed
 the beginning of the quarrel with the CCP in the spring of 1966
 when PRC media began portraying the JCP as "antirevolutionary"
 and a "revisionist gang" after Miyamoto refused to support a
 Chinese call for a "united anti-American, anti-Soviet front"
 made during talks held in February and March 1966.  The CCP's
 demand that "Japan's revolutionary movement take the armed
 insurrectionary line and accept Mao Tse-tung's deification"
 also contributed to the ideological gap which now separates the
 two parties, the article declared.  Not surprisingly, the article
 couples its refutation of CCP charges with a vigorous defense
 of the JCP's use of parliamentary means to achieve national
 power and buttresses its argument by pointing to the new Allende
 government in Chile.
 One of the issues raised in the 9 September AKAHATA article--
 Peking's support for the JCP (Left)--was underscored on
 20 September when a JCP (Left) delegaiton, led by party
 Chairman Masayoshi Fukuda, was feted at a Peking banquet
 attended by Chou En-lai, Chiang Ching, Chang Chun-chiao and Yao
 Wen-yuan, all full politburo members.*
 Reacting to this sensitive issue, AKAHATA on 23 September
 published a statement released by Ichiro Sunama, JCP Presidium
 member, which denounced Chou by name for meeting with "Japanese
 antiparty  elements, self-styling themselves the JCP (Left)."
 Sunama blasted the "Fukuda faction" as a band of "blind
 antiparty followers of a foreign power engaging in subversive
 activities under Mao Tse-tung Thought against the Communist
 Party of Japan."  Sunama concluded that "it is unpardonable
 big-power chauvisionistic interference toward the JCP for
 Chou En-lai to invite the antiparty band of the Fukuda
 faction to China."
 *  After ties between the CCP and JCP began to weaken in 1966,
 disatisfied pro-Maoists within the Yamaguchi Prefecture branch
 of the JCP organized a splinter group--the National Council of
 the JCP (Left)--in 1968.  AKAHATA charged this group with
 "mechanistically applying Maoism to a Japanese revolution" in
 an article reporting its assumption of the name JCP (Left)
 in December 1969.

 USSR  INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 YOUNG KAZAKH POET PROTESTS AGAINST CONFORMIST ATMOSPHERE
 In a speech Cilivered to the Kazakh writers congress last May,
 but not published until last month, a young Kazakh poet of some
 renown has criticized the current atmosphere of complete
 suppression of controversy in the literary field--something the
 Soviet regime has worked long and hard to achieve.  Rather like
 Yevtushenko, who at the USSR writers congress challenged the
 control of the older, conservative authors, poet 0lzhas
 Suleymenov decried the efforts to censor young writers and
 squelch all debate, and he called on the leaders of the writers
 union "to create an atmosphere of free criticism."
 Suleymenov's speech is one of only three Kazakh writers congress
 speeches selected for publication in the August issue of the
 unorthodox Kazakh literary journal PROSTOR--the other two being
 the main report by the writers union first secretary, Anuar
 Alimzhanov, and the speech of PROSTOR's liberal editor Ivan
 Shukhov.  Shukhov, himself a critic of dullness and conformity,
 evidently singled out the speech of Suleymenov from among the
 rank-and-file congress speakers in order to save his controversial
 message from being silenced by the censorship.  (The Kazakh press
 coverage of the 26-27 May writers congress had reduced
 Suleymenov's speech to two innocuous paragraphs.)
 Suleymenov makes clear his preference for the period of the early
 and mid-1960's before the authorities had managed to clamp on the
 lid.  He praises the previous heated debates over young poets
 Yevtushenko, Voznesenskiy and Rozhdestvenskiy--both the criticism
 and the rebuttals--as helpful to poetry, and he declares that
 literature, especially poetry, "cannot exist in quietness."  "I
 sincerely regret that in recent years no decadent or formalist
 [author] has appeared in Kazakh literature," he continues; "it
 is too positive and quiet," which is "harmful" and leads to
 "atrophy."
 Recalling that some young Kazakh literary critics had tried to
 imitate Russian critics and open sharp debates, Suleymenov says
 that they were attacked so harshly that they quit literary
 criticism altogether.  "All it took was for a young critic to
 offend some authoritative person, and he was declared a
 formalist . . . and they stopped publishing him."  The elders'

 -115-
 power to destroy young writers has left "the mark of this fear
 on all our young criticism and, c',nsequently, on literature,"
 and as a result "everything here is quiet, everything is on an
 even keel, everything is excellent, even the dullness."
 Suleymenov also criticizes the writers' dependence on the
 authorities, complaining that authors are writing not for the
 reader but mainly for the "bureaucrat on whom the fate of your
 book depends."
 One of the best-known of current Kazakh poets, Suleymenov is no
 stranger to controversy.  As Alimzhanov stated in his opening
 report, "His every book evokes lively debate both in our local
 press and in the central press."  Alimzhanov expressed,
 nonetheless, his personal support for Suleymenov:  "For my part,
 I am an admirer of his creative work, which is always searching"
 (KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA, 27 May).
 PROSTOR's version of first secretary Alimzhanov's report also
 contains interesting revelations about "unhealthy phenomena"
 within the Kazakh union.  Proclaiming that he is not afraid to
 wash dirty linen in public, Alimzhanov complained that Kazakh
 writers have been circulating anonymous letters containing
 gossip and threats in order to settle literary feuds.

 TOPICS  IN BRIEF
 BRfZHNEV VISIT TO CUBA
 Neither Soviet nor Cuban media have confirmed speculation on a
 planned Brezhnev visit to Cuba in December, prompted by Chilean
 Foreign Minister Almeyda's remark--in an interview published in
 the 21 September issue of the Chilean paper ULTIMA HORA--that a
 long-rumored Castro visit to Chile "must take place before
 December, since Brezhnev's visit to Cuba has been announced for
 that date."  PRENS\ LATINA's Santiago correspondent transmitted
 the text of the interview to Havana on 21 September, but PRENSA
 LATINA has not distributed any report on it.
 Moscow media have ignored the speculation, while Havana has
 mentioned the "rumors" in a single broadcast in the domestic
 service on 25 September.  In his feature program built around
 the device of a "letter from Freddy"--purportedly an itinerant
 journalist--Havana' commentator Guido -'Garcid,.Inclan'.g;uoted "Freddy"
 as writing from Miami:  "The rumore,.we..hear here have it that
 Fidel will go to Chile in November and that Brezhnev will visit
 Cuba in December."
 UK SPY CHARGES
 Available Moscow media reports and comment on the British Govern-
 ment's decision to expel a large number of Soviet diplomats for
 spying and espionage activities have not mentioned the
 25 September remarks made by Secretary Rogers to newsmen at the
 United Nations to the effect that Soviet espionage activities
 will be a "factor" in NATO's decision on whether to agree to a
 European security conference.  Several East European sources
 immediately picked up the remarks made by the Secretary to
 suggest that the United States was involved in a well-coordinates
 plan with the British Government to impose another "obstacle"
 in the way of convening a European security conference now that
 the NATO "condition" of  a satisfactory settlement on Berlin has
 been reached.
 Soviet media have charged, without referring to Rogers' remarks,
 that London is seeking with its "malicious anti-Soviet provocation"
 to increase tension in Europe and thus hamper the convening of a
 European conference.  This is an apparent response to the UK charge
 in its aide-memoire of the 24th that there is % contradiction between
 the level of Soviet operations against UK sec-city and the Soviet
 call for a conference on European security.
