 USSR-AFGHANISTAN: Treaty
 The Soviet-Afghan Treaty of Friendship,  Good Neigh-
 borliness and Cooperation signed yesterday in Moscow
 obliges the two sides to consult and take appropriate
 measures to ensure the security,  independence and terri-
 torial integrity of each and to continue developing co-
 operation in the military field,                              but there is no mutual
 defense agreement. A Soviet-Afghan treaty signed in 1931,
 however, prohibits Afghanistan from allowing its terri-
 tory to be used for actions inimical to the USSR,  and the
 two sides yesterday reaffirmed their commitment to the
 "aims and principles" of the 1931  treaty.
 The treaty is somewhat unusual because it contains
 a clause specifically endorsing Afghan nonalignment and
 because it does not call for closer political coopera-
 tion. The recent Soviet treaties with "socialist" Ethio-
 pia and Communist Vietnam contained clauses calling for
 such cooperation.
 The treaty also differs from the USSR's treaties
 with other Asian states in that it contains a clause
 calling for joint efforts to facilitate creation of an
 effective Asian security system. Although the previous
 Afghan Government had already gone further than any
 other Asian country except Mongolia in endorsing Soviet
 President Brezhnev's proposal in 1969 for an Asian col-
 lective security system, Kabul's neighbors will almost
 certainly interpret this clause as additional evidence
 that Afghanistan has fallen irretrievably under Soviet
 sway.        I
 Both countries clearly see advantages in having
 such a political document as the basis of their relation-
 ship.                           The Afghans may have been more anxious to conclude
 it at this time in hope that it will serve as a deter-
 rent to both domestic and foreign opponents. The USSR
 shares Afghan concerns about both Pakistan's and Iran's
 capabilities to "destabilize" the new government, but
 its interests in Afghanistan were already protected by
 the existing treaties, and Moscow is probably concerned
 that the treaty not give India additional cause to ac-
 celerate its moves to improve relations with China and
 the West.

 In his first public remarks about Romania's refusal

 ing,                           Soviet President Brezhnev last night said that the

 Brezhnev's formulation was clearly a rebuke to
 Romanian President Ceausescu, who made five public
 speeches last week arguing against the need for increas-
 ing Pact defense spending. The description of the
 speeches by the leader of another Pact country as "dem-
 agogic" is unusually harsh, but Brezhnev refrained from
 mentioning Ceausescu by name and did not threaten any re-
 taliatory measures against Romania. F77         I       25X1

 Zambian President Kaunda warned on Monday that Rho-
 desian and South African forces are planning to attack
 Zambia before the end of the week in order to disrupt
 the presidential election next week.  Kaunda is reacting
 partly out of longstanding fears of such an invasion and
 partly for domestic political reasons.
 Zambia's failure to respond to past Rhodesian in-
 cursions has surpassed the country's shaky economy as
 the main issue in the campaign. Kaunda, who was in
 southern Zambia, designed his remarks to deflect crit-
 icism from the population of that area--the hardest hit
 by the Rhodesians. He stated that his government is bol-
 stering its defenses and would not let further incursions
 go unchallenged.
 Yesterday, the acting Zambian Foreign Minister in-
 formed Western ambassadors that South African Prime Min-
 ister Botha had warned Kaunda that Pretoria is aware
 that guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organ-
 ization are concentrating in southwestern Zambia for
 attacks into Namibia to disrupt the elections now under
 way there. Botha hinted that South Africa might take
 measures to offset any such attacks.
 We have no information that either Rhodesia or
 South Africa is preparing any raids into Zambia anytime
 in the near future. Either country--particularly Rho-
 desia--would be tempted individually to attack if it saw
 a favorable military opportunity, but neither would make
 raids in order to disrupt Zambia's election. Although
 Botha hopes to induce Kaunda to restrain Namibian guer-
 rilla infiltrations from Zambia, his message may also
 have been intended to divert international attention
 from the arrest of SWAPO leaders in Namibia last weekend.

 General   ssem  y s committee              decolonization that the
 UK had kept its promise to work for the "early inde-
 pendence" of Belize. As we reported earlier, the UK is
 offering the Guatemalans an economic development package
 and a modest reconfiguring of territorial waters but no
 cession of Belizean territory--far short of Guatemala's
 expectations. The move reflects London's determination
 to resolve the issue as soon as possible and its view
 that Commonwealth nations and most nonaligned states
 would not oppose the refusal to cede land.//
 Guatemalan Foreign Minister Castillo Valdez re-
 sponded to the disclosure in a vitriolic speech that
 include a direct attack on UK Foreign Secretary Owen.
 Although Castillo Valdez categorically rejected the
 British proposals, he did note that his government is
 willing to continue negotiations with the UK and--in a
 new gambit--to have direct talks "with the people of
 Belize."
 Short of a precipi-
 tate, unilateral British move to grant independence to
 Belize, the Guatemalans--in part because of their pre-
 occupation with events in Nicaragua--are likely to avoid
 taking steps toward any major confrontation.//

 North Yemeni President Salih arrived in Saudi
 Arabia yesterday amid signs that Saudi confidence in
 him is waning. North Yemeni officials have noted the
 changes in Saudi attitude and are likely to seek renewed
 pledges of political support.  They probably will also
 urge speedier delivery of military items being obtained
 through the joint US-Saudi-North Yemeni military program.
 Foreign Minister Asnaj, who is accompanying Salih, has
 indicated he plans to raise with Saudi officials the
 possibility of a regional defense pact to include Oman
 and the United Arab Emirates, as well as North Yemen
 and Saudi Arabia.
 Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan, who bears
 the primary responsibility for his country's relations
 with the two Yemens, will probably question Salih
 closely about the continuing unrest in North Yemen and
 about recent personnel changes in the cabinet that dis-
 pleased Saudi leaders. The Saudis and North Yemenis will
 also closely review their current policies toward South

 The government hopes to lower the annual population
 growth rate substantially by the mid-1980s. The 10-year
 economic plan approved at the Fifth National People's
 Congress early this year stipulates that population
 growth be reduced to 0.9 percent by 1985.  Chairman Hua
 Kuo-feng stated at the same Congress that China should
 strive to lower the annual rate of growth to less than
 one percent within three years.  Either goal is signifi-
 cantly more optimistic than the current US estimate
 that the rate of growth will only decline to 1.3 percent
 by 1985.

 The Spanish electorate is almost certain to approve
 '=he country's new constitution by a wide margin in the
 referendum today.  Approval will culminate a peaceful
 Transition from authoritarian to democratic institutions
 by a process of political consensus that is unique in
 ?panish history. As one Spanish politician noted,  this
 is  the first Spanish constitution that has not been
 rammed down the throat of one-half of Spain by the other
 "calf.  Only one issue--Basque demands for special auto-
 anomy rights--proved impervious to consensus.  The Basque
 issue   is so contentious that it could in the Zong run
 =pose a significant threat to Spain's hard-won democratic
 Prime Minister Suarez' decision to let the entire
 parliament--the Cortes--participate in drafting the new
 constitution in part reflected the fact that his Demo-
 cratic Center Union did not have a majority in the
 Fortes, but subsequent events make it clear that Suarez
 was consistently willing to compromise in order to im-
 prove the prospects for acceptance of the new charter.

 King Juan Carlos played an important role during
 the early months of drafting, which began in August of
 last year. His success in projecting himself as a mod-
 ,'rating influence and symbol of unity, as well as the
 popularity he developed among the people, helped confirm
 the notion that important decisions should be reached by
 consensus. Perhaps even more important was the part he
 played in reconciling rightists, particularl   the
 Military to the need for democratic change.
 The constitutional committee in the lower house pro-
 ceeded slowly at first, largely because Suarez'                          reliance
 ,n votes from the rightist Popular Alliance triggered
 confrontations with the parties of the left.  In late May,
 however, Democratic Center Union and Socialist party

 leaders struck a pact that opened the way for compromise
 language on such controversial points as regional auto-
 nomy, the role of the Church, labor relations, divorce,
 abortion, and education. II
 The reasons behind the pact between Spain's two
 largest parties are complex. Suarez saw advantage in
 enhancing his left-of-center credentials by moving away
 from the Popular Alliance, and Socialist leader Gonzalez
 was looking for a way to break in on the cozy tactical
 arrangement that had developed between. Suarez and Com-
 munist leader Santiago Carrillo.  Both Suarez and Gonzalez
 share a belief that consensus is essential if democracy
 is to take root.
 With a few important exceptions, the pact held
 firm for the remainder of the constitutional committee's
 deliberations and during the subsequennt consideration of
 the draft constitution by both houses of the Cortes.
 When the leaders could not agree on a particular matter,
 they compromised by a general statement that left the
 details to future enabling legislation or judicial in-
 terpretation.
 Under the new constitution, executive power is
 centered in the prime minister. He chooses his ministers,
 and they are responsible to him; he in turn is respons-
 ible to the Congress of Deputies--the lower house of
 the legislature. The prime minister serves a four-year
 legislative term unless he loses a vote of confidence
 or censure, or decides for tactical reasons to dissolve
 the legislature early. The Congress'  abilit  to remove
 a government is sharply circumscribed.    II
 The lower house of the legislature is elected ac-
 cording to a modified system of proportional representa-
 tion; most of the Senate--the upper house--is directly
 elected. The assemblies in autonomous communities ap-
 point several Senators.
 The King remains Chief of State but his main func-
 tions will be consultative and ceremonial;  all of his
 important acts are subject to countersignature. Juan
 Carlos'  influence, however, is likely to be important,
 and with the military it could be critical.
 Reflecting demands for greater self-government
 from the Basques and from other "nationalities," the
 new constitution provides that those of the 50 Spanish

 provinces that so desire may form autonomous "communi-
 ties" and allocates certain powers to these "communi-
 ties." All major powers, however  are initially reserved
 to the central government. III
 Basque demands for special status under the auto-
 nomy provisions could yet undo the carefully built demo-
 cratic structure. Even the relatively moderate Basque
 Nationalists, who represent the majority of ethnic
 Basques, insisted on constitutional language that in
 essence would put their region's "historic rights" out-
 side the constitution. For various reasons--but primarily
 because the military would not tolerate such a potential
 threat to national unity--the  overnment could not ac-
 cept the Basque demands.
 The Basque Nationalists abstained on the final vote
 in both houses and are urging abstention in the referen-
 dum. The constitution is still likely to win approval in
 the Basque provinces, but a high rate of abstention
 possibly 50 percent in two of them--is probable.
 Nationwide, the government would consider approval
 by 70 percent of those casting ballots a victory. Opin-
 ion polls forecast a national abstention rate of 25 per-
 cent with 5 to 10 percent of those voting coming out
 against the constitution.
 Until recently, it had seemed that promulgation of
 the constitution would signal the end of the consensus
 era as the parties turned toward the next national elec-
 tion and pressures of partisan politics asserted them-
 selves. The major parties, however, have had second
 thoughts about the advantage of holding an early election
 and the resolution of significant remaining problems--
 the economy and the growin  Basque problem--still seems
 to require consensus. II
 Confronted with these challenges and faced with the
 prospect of tough legislative battles over enabling
 legislation for the constitution, Spain's politicians
 may decide to prolong their consensus approach.  If the
 tension persists, Suarez' Centrists and Gonzalez'  So-
 cialists may join in a coalition government. Even such
 ith

 a coalition, however, would have trouble cop
 the challenges looming beyond the referendum.

 IRAQ: New Regional Role
 The Baathist regime in Iraq,  after 10 years of
 self-imposed isolation,  is now projecting the image of a
 responsible party ready to play a positive role in Arab
 councils.  Whether the change is basic or tactical,  Iraq
 will almost certainly assume a more significant place in
 regional affairs in the next few years.  Its emergence as
 a regional power is a reflection of its own political
 stability as well as its growing economic and military
 strength,  and of the ZikeZy decline in in Zuence of two
 other regional powers,  Egypt and Iran.
 To Iraqi leaders, Egyptian President Sadat's peace
 initiatives and the Camp David accords probably mean
 that Egypt--an old competitor--is opting out of Arab
 politics and turning its attention to domestic affairs
 and toward Africa and Libya. The Iraqis see an opportu-
 nity to develop a major leadership role for themselves.
 This may explain their reconciliation with Syria in Oc-
 tober, their moves to strengthen ties with Jordan, and
 their decision to cool their feud with the Palestine
 Liberation Organization.
 The Iraqi initiative for reconciliation with Syria
 this fall followed a decade of hostility between the
 rival Baathist regimes. This time, the Iraqis did not
 demand, as they had in the past, that Syria abandon its
 acceptance of UN Security Council Resolution 242 and
 join the rejectionists.  In late October, the two regimes
 signed their reconciliation agreement, the National
 Charter for Joint Action.
 It is too soon to tell how far reconciliation will
 go, but it clearly does have some momentum. Iraqi Presi-
 dent Bakr and perhaps Deputy Chairman Saddam Husayn, the
 regime strongman, are scheduled to visit Syrian Presi-
 dent Assad in Damascus early this month to review the
 work of the joint committees formed in October to en-
 hance bilateral cooperation.  Iraqi and Syrian leaders
 were reported to be planning then to meet Soviet leaders
 in Moscow, but that trip now seems uncertain.

 II
 Thus far, there has been little of the woolly rheto-
 ric that Arab leaders often use to mask the absence of
 real progress in their endeavors.  Spokesmen for both
 .aides are taking a positive view of reconciliation, al-
 though the Syrian attitude seems a shade more reserved.
 The Iraqis stress that the new relationship with Syria
 should be a "unionist" one; the Syrians tend to emphasize
 dealing with easier bilateral problems before moving on
 A new Iraqi posture was also evident during the
 Baghdad summit early last month. Not only did Iraq play
 uu restrained role, but it also signed a communique con-
 taining a reference to conditions for a "just peace"
 with Israel.  Iraqi officials deny that they have made a
 policy shift, but only a year ago the Iraqi delegate
 stormed out of a meeting of the Arab "Steadfastness
 .Front" because Syria and the other hardliners would not
 renounce the goal of a comprehensive settlement in the
 Middle East.
 The troubles this year in Iran--Iraq's longtime
 rival for predominance in the Persian Gulf--probably
 have sparked conflicting reactions in Baghdad. On the
 one hand, the Iraqi regime fears that the reactionary
 sectarian resurgence in Iran could infect its own Shia
 Muslims, who make up about half of the Iraqi population.
 Relations with Iran have been good since 1975 when Iran
 stopped supporting Iraq's rebellious Kurdish minority.
 I=raqi leaders probably would be content to see the Shah
 remain in power and bring the disorders to an end.
 At the same time, Iraqi leaders probably see the
 possibility of benefiting from Iran's problems.  Iraq
 has long wanted to be the major player in Persian Gulf
 affairs.  In the past,  it has tried to spread its in-
 iluence--without much success--by military threats,  sub-
 version, and aid to local radicals. A corollary has been
 Traq's desire to exclude Iranian influence and military
 power from the Arab side of the Gulf.
 Although Saudi Arabia has been an Iraqi rival for
 paramount place among the Gulf Arabs, it has been the
 more powerful and aggressive Iran that has been Iraq's
 strongest competitor in the area.

 OD se-*
 The regime in Baghdad probably has concluded that,
 for the foreseeable future, Iran will be forced to look
 inward and focus on the socioeconomic problems made
 manifest by the unrest this year.  Iraq may now feel that
 it has the opportunity to gain in the Persian Gulf, and
 it would not be surprising to see Iraq revive proposals
 for a Persian Gulf security pact among the Arab states
 of the area. That goal would require a cooperative ap-
 proach and would probably deter Iraq in the near term
 from returnin  to the heavyhanded tactics it has tried
 in the past.
 Some Syrian officials who are skeptical of the
 sincerity of Iraq's professions of interest in recon-
 ciliation believe the Iraqis are motivated mainly by
 concern over Soviet intentions in the region. These
 Syrians suggest that Iraq feels threatened by recent
 Soviet gains in Afghanistan, South Yemen, and elsewhere.
 They believe that the troubles in Iran this year tipped
 the balance, and led the Iraqis to end their isolation
 and seek better relations with their neighbors.
 The "new look" in Iraq's foreign posture is moti-
 vated by a variety of factors, and concern about the
 USSR is undoubtedly one of them. The Iraqis are in fact
 nervous about Soviet intentions in Iran--despite their
 own arms and technical assistance relationship with the
 USSR.  Iraq would not want Iran to become another Soviet
 client. The USSR might then be able to play off Iranian
 and Iraqi ambitions to further its own strategic am-
 bitions in the Gulf.
