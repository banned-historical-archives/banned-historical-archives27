 BRIEFS AND COMMENTS
 UGANDA-TANZANIA:   Artificial Coalition
 Ugandan exile groups meeting in northern Tanzania
 have announced formation of a National Liberation Front
 headed by a 67-year-old former educator, Yusufu Lute.
 The Front appears to be a coalition of Longstanding ri-
 vals that will probably require constant outside support.
 The greatest effort seems to have gone into achieving
 spread in the group's executive council.                         25X1
 //In addition to Lule, the executive council is com-
 posed of five northerners and five southerners.   Former
 President Obote, a protege of Tanzanian President Nyerere,
 is not included, but the northern members,  including the
 vice chairman, are drawn from his supporters.   Lule, from
 the important southern Baganda tribe, was dismissed from
 his post at Makerere University while Obote was still in
 power.//
 The Front's Tanzanian sponsors and its Ugandan
 members probably envisage it as a device to win interna-
 tional acceptability for their joint effort to remove
 President Amin and to take over at least part
 ministrative burden in "liberated Uganda."
 25X1
 The military situation in Uganda remains unclear,
 and we cannot confirm the conflicting reports now cir- 25X1
 culating.   Amin frequently floats false or misleading re-
 ports on his status when he is threatened.   The Tanza-
 nian Army's advance apparently has not accelerated.

 OPEC:   Recent Production Trends
 Total crude oil production in January by members of
 the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was
 nearly 1.2 million barrels per day below the 1978 annual
 average of 29.6 million barrels per day.   Preliminary esti-
 mates for February indicate a small increase--about 350,000
 barrels per day--in OPEC output over the January Level.
 Production in March should show a larger increase as a
 result of the rise in Iranian output, which now appears
 to have reached the 3.5 million barrels per day mark.
 25X1
 //The supply outlook for the second quarter and be-
 yond will depend in large part on how other producers re-
 act to the resumption of Iranian exports.   The market wil5X1

 Iraq continues to produce at roughly 3 million bar-

 UN:   Indian Ocean Zone Of Peace
 A UN drafting group will soon begin work on a docu-
 ment that could provide an outline for making the Indian
 Ocean region a "zone of peace."  It undertakes its task
 in an atmosphere of heightened suspicion of the military
 activities of the su erpowers--especi.aZly the US--in the
 region.
 The document will be prepared for a meeting of
 Indian Ocean littoral and hinterland states in July,  the
 first such gathering since the UN General Assembly orig-
 inally endorsed the concept of an Indian Ocean zone of
 peace in 1971.   The drafting group will include Indo-
 nesia, Madagascar,  Sri Lanka, and either Ethiopia or
 Somalia, but other members of the ad hoc committee on
 the Indian Ocean are free to take part.
 Most states in the region would like the document
 to include a specific program of action, but serious
 differences between India and Pakistan will make it dif-
 ficult to reach agreement on one.   While India believes
 that the document should focus primarily on the need to
 limit great power presence and rivalry in the area,
 Pakistan favors a security formula that would require
 a "reasonable ratio of naval and military forces" amo
 the Indian Ocean states themselves.
 Recent US naval deployments to the Indian Ocean have
 stimulated increased agitation on the issue of superpower
 activity there.   At the ad hoc committee's session in
 March, Iraq unsuccessfully sought to call an emergency
 meeting of regional states to discuss the "deteriorating
 situation."   Outside the UN framework,  President Rene of
 the Seychelles has been writing letters to other heads
 of government to promote opposition to the establishment
 of any new US naval force at Diego Garcia.   Despite
 these developments,  the ad hoc committee's desire for
 full consensus will likely result in a document reflect-
 ing a middle position bet       the Indian and Pakistani
 views.  F7       T

 THE SPANISH ELECTION:   Appearance and Reality
 As the first reactions to the parliamentary election
 on 1 March subside, many Spaniards seem to be wondering
 if Communist leader Carrillo may not have been right
 when he branded the contest a waste of time and money.
 On paper,  the election made little difference to the
 balance of power.   Prime Minister Suarez again fell short
 of a majority and,  though he could govern with floating
 majorities,  he will probably continue to seek consensus
 on most important issues.   Nevertheless,  the relatively
 small shifts that did occur are significant and Suarez
 is clearly in a stronger position for dealing with his
 chief rivals,  the Socialists.   Suarez won this advantage--
 and a four-year extension of his mandate--at the cost of
 lengthy delays in implementing vital legislation--most
 notably on the economy and on rules governing regional
 autonomy.   Gains by regional parties,  especially in the
 volatile Basque provin       augur bitter confrontations
 ahead on this issue.
 Both major parties--Suarez' Union of the Democratic
 Center and Felipe Gonzalez'  Socialist Workers Party--
 emerged from the election with about the same popular
 vote and almost the same number of seats as they gained
 in the last election in June 1977.   The Centrists still
 have a plurality,  but they once again fell short of a
 majority in the crucial lower house.   Thus Suarez will
 have to choose between distasteful alternatives:   form-
 ing a coalition--with one or more of the regional par-
 ties--or depending on floating votes for ea h                    important
 piece of legislation.
 To a large extent,  the parties'  initial responses
 to the electoral results were colored by pre-election
 hopes or fears that were not realized.   The Centrists'
 elation owed more to their fear of a drubbing at the
 hands of the Socialists than to any real gains.   The
 Socialists' bitterness seemed to reflect dashed hopes
 rather than a significant defeat.   They had expected to

 win more votes than the Center, or at least enough to
 oblige Suarez to include them in the government.   The
 Socialists were also dazed by the abrupt halt to the
 seemingly inexorable forward momentum built up during
 and after the 1977 election.
 The Communists'  crowing is also hard to explain
 purely on the basis of election returns.   They showed
 more improvement than any other national party,  increas-
 ing their representation by three,  or possibly four
 seats,  and upping their share of the vote by almost two
 percent, but their elation seems to derive mostly from
 the discomfiture of their major rivals on the left,  the
 Socialists.
 Alone among the four major parties,  the rightist
 Democratic Coalition seems completely justified in its
 reaction.   Having fallen disastrously from 16 seats to
 nine,  party delegates are left with the choice of join-
 ing Suarez' party or trying to maintain their unity in
 hope of trading on their nine votes--which would give
 Suarez an absolute majority.
 25X1
 25X1
 On the Other Hand
 In fact,  these relatively small shifts are more
 significant than they might seem at first.   Suarez really
 is better off.   Defections had weakened his party in the
 months before the election.   Not only has he regained
 the lost ground and more,  he has taken the opportunity
 to weed out dissidents and strengthen party discipline.
 Also, by breaking the Socialists' momentum and reaffirming
 the ascendancy of the Center, he may have made an impact
 on the voters that will serve him well in the municipal
 elections a week from today.   Although Suarez will prob-
 ably still seek consensus on important issues, ~e will
 be dealing from a position of greater strength.                25X1
 The Socialists have been hurt,  not only by the dem-
 onstration of their fallibility, but also by their imma-
 ture reaction to defeat.   Their self-indulgent bitterness,
 their attempts to blame the outcome on Suarez' dirty
 tactics--charging that he scared Spanish voters into be-
 lieving that the Socialists would radically alter Spain--

 and their railing against the electorate's stupidity are
 all likely to damage the carefully nurtured         of a
 mature, responsible party.
 //Taking account of mergers last year with two
 splinter parties,  the Socialists actually lost four seats
 in this election.   The setback may encourage Socialist
 Party radicals to challenge Felipe Gonzalez' policy of

 an importance out of proportion to its vote totals.
 The Communists, who were least happy with Suarez'
 decision to call the election,  emerged strengthened.
 Though far behind Suarez and Gonzalez in electoral sup-
 port, Carrillo is once again in the position of being
 able to do Suarez a good turn--by supporting him on par-
 liamentary votes when the right,  the regionalists, and
 the Socialists oppose the government.   In exchange,
 Carrillo will seek enhancement of his party's reputation
 as a responsible actor on Spain's political stage with
 A key aspect of the Communists' bargaining leverage
 is their predominance in organized labor--as shown in
 the labor elections last year.   This strength could be-
 come crucially important to Suarez if the Socialists and
 their labor arm,  the General Union of workers,  veer to
 the left and refuse to cooperate on important
 25X1     economic and labor legislation.

 Basques Vote Defiance
 The most disturbing note of the election was struck
 in the troubled Basque region where nationalists of vari-
 ous stripes--ranging from those seeking some degree of
 autonomy to those demanding complete independence--

 garnered more popular votes than Centrists,  Socialists,
 and Communists combined.   The big gainer was not the
 relatively moderate Basque Nationalist Party--which has
 long spoken for the vast majority of ethnic Basques--but
 the more extremist separatists who won close to 20 per-
 cent of the vote in the two most volatile provinces of
 the region.
 The Herri Batasuna coalition, many of whose leaders
 spent the electoral campaign in jail and which openly
 supports the most violent wing of the terrorist ETA or-
 ganization, won nearly 200,000 votes--enough to elect
 three deputies.   This is a sharp message of defiance to
 Madrid that will be heard just as clearly by the Basque
 Nationalists.   As early as last December there were signs
 that the Basque Nationalists were undergoing an internal
 struggle between moderates and hardliners.   The election
 results seem certain to strengthen the hardliners within
 the party and bode ill for future negotiations
 Madrid over the region's autonomy statutes.

 making some potentially serious economic errors that
 Recent press articles and official statements indi-
 cate China is now reordering economic priorities and
 lowering some of the goals of Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping's
 modernization program.   Indications are, however, that
 party chairman Hua Guofeng and not Deng may be blamed for
 After prolonged and intense debate, which probably
 came to a peak at the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Cen-
 tral Committee last December, the Chinese leadership has
 apparently decided to:
 -- Give additional resources to agriculture
 and light industry in order to increase
 production, produce a faster return on
 investment, and raise the people's stand-
 ard of living.
 -- Reduce investment in the steel industry
 specifically and heavy industry in gen-
 eral.
 -- Increase imports of advanced technology
 for light industry so as to generate a
 rapid expansion of exports.
 25X1
 -- Take a close look at the overall import
 program,  the state of China's interna-
 tional financial situation, and reorder
 priorities if need be.
 The Chinese leadership appears to have made these
 decisions in order to guarantee improved living condi-
 tions and to meet its export goals without being con-
 fronted with large balance-of-payment problems.   Because
 the political fortunes of the new leadership are inextric-
 ably linked to the success of the modernization drive,
 much is at stake in scaling down the ambitious goals
 that have been ballyhooed for about a year.   Beijing must
 now correct earlier economic errors and deal with those
 responsible without jeopardizing widespread political

 industry and greater stress on agriculture and light in-

 The first signs of a major reassessment of China's
 modernization program were revealed in the communique of
 the Third Plenum, but were not amplified until late Feb-
 ruary when a series of authoritative People's Daily edi-

 on 24 February announcing reduced investment in the steel
 25X1
 named leaders for acting with "rashness" and "impetuosity"
 in economic planning.   It defended "conservatism," de-
 claring that China had suffered far more in the past
 from rashness than it had from caution.             25X1
 In early March, Vice Chairman Li Xiannian, himself
 an economic specialist,  supported the views presented in
 the People's Daily editorials and also told a group of
 Japanese journalists that the leadership is reviewing
 China's import program and will set priorities "after 25X1
 deliberating on solvency."
 //It is too early to tell. who within the Chinese lead-
 ership was guilty of "rashness," but many signs suggest                                 25X1
 that Hua Guofeng may be made the chief scapegoat.   Hua,
 in an apparent effort to improve his own political posi-
 tion by more closely identifying himself with Deng's
 "Four Modernizations," spearheaded a movement, beginning
 someti           spring,  to step up the tempo of moderniza-
 tion.
 Hua
 was quoted in a People's Daily editorial last Octo er as  25X1
 "instructing" cadres further to emancipate our minds, be
 bolder, devise more measures and quicken our step."//

 The editorial attacks on "rashness" were followed
 by a People's Daily article last month that included a
 thinly veiled criticism of Hua Guofeng's economic ex-
 cesses.                              The article appears to compare the situation at

 the start of the Third Plenum to that of the Lushan
 Plenum of 1959, where a number of Mao's opponents were
 purged for criticizing the disastrous Great Leap Forward.
 The article argues that after 1959 China pursued a left-
 ist economic line for 18 years,               in tremendous
 damage to the national economy.
 The article implies that by avoiding "rashness" and
 adjusting their modernization program at the Third Plenum,
 China's present leaders have avoided potentially serious
 economic losses, a recurrence of the excesses of the
 Great Leap Forward.   The article cites one example that
 has particular relevance to the political fate of Hua
 Guofeng.   By linking the overambitious 1962 steel pro-
 duction targets to Hua's "unrealistic" goal of producing
 60
 illi
 m
 on tons of steel by 1985,  the article implies
 that Hua is on the wrong side of an important issue.
 In addition to indirectly blaming Hua  Chinese
 media have also criticized middle and lower-level offi-
 cials for "blindly following the wishes of their superi-
 ors."   Failure to solve this problem could lead--as it
 has in the past--to unrealistically high production goals,
 or even to the falsification of production claims, at
 local levels.
 In short, Beijing's current leaders seem to be
 fully aware that a successful modernization program re-
 quires not only balancing economic aspirations and real-
 ity, but careful handling of a host of  oliti        oblems
 throughout the country as well.
