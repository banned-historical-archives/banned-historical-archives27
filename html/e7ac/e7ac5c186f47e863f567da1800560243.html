 PEACE AND PROGRESS IN EAST ASIA
 Mr Speaker, Mr President,  Distinguished Members of
 the US Senate and House of     Representatives
 I am greatly honoured by your invitation to address
 this Joint Meeting of the United States Congress.   It cannot
 be often that someone representing 2/ million people from a
 small country in the Third World is offered the opportunity
 to address the representatives of 240 million people who
 form the world's most wealthy, and most advanced nation.
 America is a great nation not just because of its power and
 wealth,  but mainly because it is a nation moved by high
 ideals.   Only the elevating power of her idealism can
 explain the benign manner in which America has exercised its
 enormous power since the end of world War II and the
 magnanimity and generosity with which it has shared its
 wealth to rebuild a more prosperous world.   This idealism
 which inspired the Founding Fathers of this nation has, down
 the ages, also affected and inspired free men and free women
 throughout the world.
 Decisions made in this august chamber,  especially in
 the decades since 8 December 1941, have determined the
 course of human history and settled the shape of the
 contemporary world.   If the era after the war has seen a
 world relatively at peace and accompanied by an
 unprecedented degree of human progress, much of the credit
 must go to American leadership.
 At a time of domestic disquiet over large imports
 and the possible loss of jobs,  the attention of America's
 legislators has been drawn away from the fundamentals.
 These fundamentals, which successive administrations and
 congresses have successfully pursued for four decades from
 1945 are: a world in which all peoples can seek to fulfil
 themselves without having to conquer or to dominate or to
 exploit other people.
 America has encouraged a world which respects the
 sovereignty and the dignity of all,  the great and the small,
 the mighty and the weak - a world which enables all to work
 and be rewarded for their efforts because what they produce
 is desired by others willing to pay for such goods and
 services under fair rules of exchange.

 ?                               -
 For many months now troubled voices are coming from
 the US Congress.
 I want to refocus your attention, distracted
 by
 the
 problems of trade imbalance,  job loss,      high value
 of
 the
 $,
 and budget deficits,  back on the basic issues of
 peace.
 war
 and
 Since World War II, the United States has been
 involved in two major wars,  both in the western Pacific:
 Korea,  1950-53, Vietnam,  1965-73.   This was not accidental.
 East Asian societies are on the move,  seeking to transform
 their ancient civilisations into modern industrial
 societies.   All are seething with restless energy.   Their
 people want to catch up with the rest of the world and have
 the better life.   If Japan can do it, they believe they also
 can.
 In the 1950's and 60's, trade with the US of all
 countries in the Western Pacific,  except communist China,
 North Korea and North Vietnam,  increased.   Many received US
 investments.   The US was the dynamo which hastened economic
 developments.   By the late 1960's, Japan had emerged as a
 second dynamo.   The countries of  East Asia,  ASEAN,  Australia
 and New Zealand list the US and Japan as either their first
 or second most single important trading partner with 10% to
 45% of their total trade.
 I suggest that the 40 years of relative peace the
 world has enjoyed since World War II is not just because of
 the atomic bomb.   The US had learnt the lessons of World
 Wars I and II, how the desire for the better life through
 industrialisation and trade had caused the squabbles over
 markets and the expansion of empires in order to build
 larger markets and acquire resources.   The end of World War
 II and the emergence of the Cold War made the US put
 determined pressure on the European empires to decolonise.
 More pertinent, when the war ended in 1945,  the US
 set out, with her European allies,  to establish an open and
 fair trading system under General Agreement on Tariffs and
 Trade (GATT)(in force since 1 Jan 1948), and a stable system
 of currency exchange under the original IMF agreement at
 Bretton Woods.   These agreements led to the huge growth in
 trade,  banking and finance throughout the world.,

 Indeed,  political leaders in the former colonial
 territories watched in wonderment as the British,  French,
 Belgian, and Dutch governments dismantled their empires from
 1945-65, and grew more prosperous in the 1960's and 70's.
 Their former subject peoples had expected them to decline
 into relative poverty after they lost their empires,  like
 Spain and Portugal.   The secret  lay in GATT and the IMF
 which ensured that trade and investments continued and
 expanded after decolonisation.
 The East Asian phenomenon of high growth has been
 well reported.   As Japan took off,  first South Korea,  then
 Taiwan,       then Hongkong followed in her trail, picking up
 steam in her wake.   They supplemented the Japanese economy,
 and followed the Japanese into the American and European
 markets.   With investments from both the US and Japan,  they
 exported their manufactures to Europe.   By the early 1970's,
 the ASEAN countries also joined in this fast growth group.
 These developments have had a most profound impact
 on the leaders of China after Mao.   After nearly three
 decades of Maoist seclusion and self-sufficiency,  Deng
 Xiaoping decided that closing China's doors on the world was
 the cause of her stagnation.   China needs to modernise.
 China has opened her doors to trade,  investments,
 technology, and tourism.   She wants to get the same economic
 uplift that Japan,  South Korea,  Taiwan,  Hongkong and ASEAN
 have had from the free market economies of the West by
 plugging into their trading and investments power grid.  In
 a few years after this decision, China's trade with US and
 Japan has gone up many times,  thirteen times from US$0.5
 billion in 1975 to a respectable US$6.4 billion in 1984 with
 the US, and three times from US$3.9 billion to US$13.2
 billion with Japan for the same period.   China is seeking
 growth through trade,  not territorial aggrandisement.   Her
 quest for a better. life for her people is through peaceful
 cooperation in trade,  investments and transfer of technology
 and knowhow,  not the use of force for territorial conquests.
 and the carving out of a sphere of influence or a trading
 bloc.
 The North Koreans too have been impressed by the
 market economies of the West.  They want to emulate the
 transformation of the South Korean economy.   They have
 borrowed an estimated US$1.4 billion from Japanese/Western
 banks in the 1970's.   The investments were not successful
 and their debts had to be rescheduled.

 China's decision is a most significant factor for
 peace,  stability and growth in Asia.  For nearly 30 years,
 from 1949 until Mao died in 1976, a poor but ideologically
 fervent China was a ceaseless spoiler of other countries'
 economic plans as she undermined their stability.   She was
 an exporter of revolution.             She provided arms,  ideology and
 radio support to guerilla insurgencies in Southeast Asia.
 China has,  for the present,  discontinued such support.
 Every Chinese schoolboy knows how China's
 civilisation began:  through the unification, over 2000 years
 ago, of the seven warring states by the emperor Qin
 Shihuang.   China knows from her own history,  that the
 time-proven method for a dynamic, vigorous people to
 achieve greater economic power is to carve out a larger
 territory with a larger population to form a greater base on
 which peace and order are established.   Then with a wide
 range of soil and climates and peoples,  there will be more
 weatlh from a greater diversity of goods and services for
 exchange.
 The Vietnamese also know this. Fortunately for
 Asia, Vietnam's attempt to carve out Cambodia and Laos for
 herself,  has resulted in Vietnam's economic stagnation.
 Vietnam gets no investments from the West.   Her trade is
 negligible.   She is bogged down. in guerilla war in Cambodia
 and will be worn down in a clash of wills on the
 Sino-Vietnamese border with an immensely larger neighbour.
 A younger generation of Americans may not know that
 it was the carving out of empire that Japan undertook when
 in 1931 she set up the state of Manchukuo in Manchuria.   In
 fact, Japan had embarked on a modern empire earlier in 1895
 when she annexed Taiwan, and in 1905 when she annexed Korea.
 The success of the countries in East and Southeast
 Asia has caused much of the Third World to rethink their
 policies.   Once infatuated with socialist economic policies
 of nationalisation and autarchy, Third World nations have
 now come to see that stagnation and decay have followed
 these policies.   More and more Third World nations are
 seeking a better life for their peoples by opening their
 doors to trade and investments.

 Putting up barriers to America's markets would halt
 the economic advancement of the free market-oriented
 developing countries.   It would send a signal that the model
 provided by the countries of East and Southeast Asia is no
 longer an available option.   It could set off a chain
 reaction which would result in a downward spiral of the
 world economy.
 China was a founder member of GATT.   The present
 government of the PRC abandoned its membership in 1950.
 Recently,  it has sent out feelers for re-admission as a
 developing country member of GATT.   If the US cuts down
 China's growing trade with her,  then China has to rethink
 her economic strategy.   Shutting out China's products,
 especially textiles,  from America's markets, will have
 far-reaching implications.   China must then look for other
 ways of getting foreign exchange to pay for modernisation.
 If,  as is likely,  she cannot get enough alternative markets
 to make up for the loss of America, her modernisation will
 slow down.   She will become restive.
 A Japan squeezed in such a protectionist trap, has
 few attractive options.  'After thrashing around looking for
 market extensions   in Latin America,  Africa and West Asia,
 Japan will turn back to her two major options: closer
 economic links with the Soviet Union, or closer ties with
 China.   She could try to do both and reconcile or postpone
 the conflicts inherent in the two options.   In the end,  she
 has to choose one of these two.   Either choice conjures up
 disquieting consequences for the rest of Asia, and the
 world.
 Singapore has been an independent country for only
 20 years.   Whether it will be allowed to remain so,  to work
 hard to thrive and prosper, depends on the rules under which
 the big and the small states are allowed to compete and to
 cooperate in trade and finance.   Forty-four years ago the
 British could not prevent the Japanese from capturing and
 occupying us and our ASEAN neighbours.   We were incorporated
 as part of Japan's "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere."
 The present multi-lateral economic cooperation offers so
 much more to Singapore.

 The irony is that it was the US and Europe that
 forced a reluctant China and a hermit-like Japan to open up
 their countries to trade with the West.     They were two
 oriental societies happy to be self-sufficient and to keep
 out the outside world.   It seems preposterous that because
 America has temporary difficulties with her balance of
 trade, due in part to an overvalued $,  resulting from high
 interest rates and a budget deficit,  that the US should
 begin to close her markets.   And now it is the Japanese and
 the Chinese instead who have to come knocking at America's
 door to get in to trade.   What a bitter-sweet irony of
 role-reversal.
 Whatever might have been the position had American
 policies been different since 1945, the rapid changes in the
 Western Pacific are already in train.   It  is the result of a
 resurgence of dynamism in these societies as they recover
 their balance and forge their will to compete and get on the
 move.   They are societies capable of organising themselves,
 of implementing and achieving high standards of universal.
 education, of mastering the skills and knowledge of the
 industrial societies, of acquiring new technology, of
 improving product design and marketing, and of carrying out
 research and development.   They have strong cultural bases
 to build a modern technological society upon.
 There are two scenarios for the 21st century.   The
 first is bleak:  if,  because of domestic problems,  the US
 loses the will to maintain free trade.   There are over 300
 bills in Congress dedicated to the protection of the US
 market.   Protectionism and retaliation will shrink trade and
 so reduce jobs.   Is America willing to write off the
 peaceful and constructive developments of the last 40 years
 that she had made possible?   Does America wish to abandon
 the contest between democracy and the free market on the one
 hand versus Communism and the controlled economy on the
 other, when she has nearly won this contest for the hearts
 and minds of the Third World?   Never in its history has the
 peoples of the world enjoyed such high standards of living.
 For 40 years the maintenance of the political boundaries was
 made possible because thrusting, and usually agressive,
 peoples have been able to fulfil their drive to better their
 lot through trade.   If this method for adjustment and
 accommodation between societies moving at different speeds
 is no longer possible,  then a return to the traditional ways
 of conquest or influence is likely.

 Therefore America will find that the putting up of
 tariff barriers is not enough.   She will have to go one step
 further: she will have to be the policeman,  to enforce order
 over her sphere of influence,  of the world outside the
 Soviet bloc.
 After World War I the US left the League of Nations
 and withdrew into isolationism.   Nevertheless,  inexorably,
 she was again drawn into the vortex of war by December 1941.
 The Soviet Union,  since World War II, dominates her'
 allies as satellites in Comecon.   The Soviets also maintain
 the balance between them and the other aspiring communist
 societies like Cuba, Vietnam and Ethiopia.   In like manner,
 without adjustments through open and fair trade,  the US must
 enforce some kind of dominance on her own allies in Europe
 and Japan.  'And America and Europe together must police and
 keep the peace between the other jostling and contending
 societies  in Asia,  Africa and Latin America.   The more
 dynamic countries, prevented from thriving through trade,
 must be prevented from re-channelling their energies towards
 expansion of their territory or of their influence to get
 assured markets.   Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately for
 the rest of the world,  the US Constitution enshrines a
 system of open government which does not allow its leaders
 to exercise such dominion over other countries and
 governments in the same way.that leaders of totalitarian
 states can.
 Let us not forget that protectionism and less trade
 means less growth for the developing countries.  This means
 debt burdens cannot be discharged.   Defaults may be
 unavoidable, with incalculable consequences for the
 international banking system.   Even if the banks survive the
 upheavals,  these developing countries will have to abandon
 all thoughts of liberalisation towards plurality and more
 democratic freedoms.   Severe or repressive government is the
 other side of austere or negative economic growth.
 An over-strong dollar has caused the huge trade
 deficits.   A volatile and speculative foreign exchange
 market has exaggerated the factors working towards a strong
 dollar.   The recent meeting in New York of the G5,  Finance
 Ministers of five largest industrial nations,  has given

 grounds for optimism that the over-valued dollar can be
 brought down by concerted actions of the G5 Finance
 Ministers and their Central Banks.   Congress should stay its
 hand and allow these efforts time to work.
 In case lobbyists for the Japanese believe they are
 going to be joined by one from Singapore who ought to
 register his interests,  let me add that I do not suggest
 that the Japanese should not be cajoled, and if necessary
 coerced, with all the powers at America's command,  to open
 up their markets.   America can legitimately and justly use
 all means to knock down Japanese barriers and obstacles to
 imports.   There was a time in the 1950's and 60's when
 America looked with amusement and tolerance at the
 ingeniousness of Japanese obstacles to imports.   But, after
 Japan has become the second largest economic power, as a
 result of open and fair trade,  it is right that she should
 be made to abide by the rules that have brought her to her
 present unprecedented prosperity.
 The rest of Asia will cheer with joy, for then their
 goods will also get into Japan without going through an
 obstacle course.   Let me add that 96% of US goods enter
 Singapore duty free and quota free.   And for 14 out of the
 last 15 years, that US has enjoyed trade surpluses with
 Singapore.   But for America to put tariffs or barriers to
 Japanese goods,  instead of tearing down Japanese barriers to
 American exports, will hurt the rest of Asia twice over.
 First by having these same tariffs and barriers to overcome
 to sell to America, and second,  by not being able to sell to
 Japan because Japan cannot sell to America.
 It is right to compel the Japanese, and others,  to
 help the system function better.   And if threatening
 retaliation for unequal access to markets is part of this
 process towards open and fair trade,  then so be it.   America
 has the right to also ask that those who have benefitted from
 America's markets, open up their markets.   Some countries,
 like ASEAN,  have supported the US initiative to have GATT
 begin a new round of discussions for lowering barriers to
 trade in goods and perhaps also regularise trade in
 services.   The answer to job losses is more,  not less trade.

 America can upgrade her declining low value-added
 industries or they will continue to decline whether America
 goes protectionist or not,  just as the ancient agricultural
 societies of pre-industrial China and Japan, with their
 self-sufficient,  subsistence economies based on buffalo
 power and manpower, had to change with the advent of the
 industrial age.   Rapid and profound change is the kind of
 world Americans have created by their inventiveness.
 American legislators have the awesome responsibility of
 deciding under what rules the peoples of so many different
 countries should undergo rapid changes in their ways of
 making a living, and yet avoid violent conflicts.
 In every age, the leading power has to carry the
 burden of encouraging the peaceful acceptance of the status
 quo.     This is done by punishing agression and rewarding
 peaceful cooperation.   The British carried this burden for
 over 100 years after they pioneered the industrial
 revolution.   This responsibility passed to America after
 World War II.
 It is inherent in America's position as the
 pre-eminent economic, political and military power to have.
 to settle and uphold the rules for orderly change and
 progress.   Americans are leaders in a marathon for
 technological. change and product innovation.   American
 enterprise is blazing the trail into the microchip and
 computerised world of tomorrow.   In the interests of peace
 and security America must uphold the rules of international
 conduct which reward peaceful cooperative behaviour and
 punishes trangressions of the peace.   A replay of the
 depression of the 1930's which led to World War II will be
 ruinous for all.   All the major powers in the West share the
 responsibility for not repeating this mistake.   But America's
 is the primary responsibility,  for she is the anchor economy
 of the free market economies of the world.   In your hands
 therefore lie the future of the world.
