 Summary           The population of China, which stood at slightly more than 1 billion as of
 Ir{/ormation avai/able   mid-1982, is increasing at the rate of 1.2 million persons a month. We be-
 ar of 6 December 1982    lieve that by the year 2000 the population will probably range between 1.25
 was used in then re?orr.   billion and slightly more than 1.3 billion, substantially above Beijing's goal
 of 1.2 billion.
 Despite a comprehensive family planning program targeted to slow
 population growth, the birth rate has surged in the past two years. The in-
 crease results, in part, from new rural economic policies that have not only
 weakened local authority essential for effective family planning efforts but
 have also put a premium on larger families by linking income to production
 and giving greater economic decisionmaking authority to peasant house-
 holds. Other reasons for the increased birth rate include the large number
 of young people who are now entering marriage and childbearing age and
 the 1980 Marriage Law that lowered the legal age of marriage and
 provided a legal basis for children to support their elderly parents.
 The massive population and its increased rate of growth have major
 domestic and international implications. At home these include:
 ? Increased demands for food and basic necessities.
 ? Growing unemployment and underemployment.
 ? Intensification of a number of social problems, including youth disaffec-
 tion, crime, overcrowded housing, inadequate medical and child care, and
 substandard educational training.
 ? Rising political tensions as a result of unfulfilled economic goals and
 festering social problems, leaving the leadership more open to criticism.
 Internationally, China will have to favor food over imports of capital goods
 and will probably continue its recent policy of expanding Third World
 market opportunities for its large pool of labor and skilled personnel.

 China's 1 Billion:
 Implications of Growth
 Over aBillion-25 More Each Minute
 Excessive population growth is an ancient problem in
 China. The problem is even more pressing today,
 threatening to jeopardize the painfully achieved eco-
 nomic gains of recent years and to thwart the full
 realization of an array of social and economic goals
 that form the objectives of Beijing's modernization
 efforts. The magnitude of the problem was highlight-
 ed by the recently released preliminary census for
 China which tallied the population as of mid-1982 at
 1.008 billion-a ffgure that represents roughly 22
 percent of the world's population (table 1). In addi-
 tion, the data indicate a recent upsurge in births. In
 1979 the Chinese stated that the population growth
 rate was 1.17 percent; preliminary census data indi-
 cate the 1981 growth rate at 1.45 percent.' Because of
 the size of the population base, even slight changes in
 growth rates translate into huge absolute numbers of
 people. The difference between a 1.45-percent growth
 rate and a 1.17-percent rate over the 1980-90 decade
 would amount to 30 million people.
 The leadership has been increasingly concerned over
 the implications of these trends:
 A recent People's Daily editorial complained that
 some individuals still lack "sufficient understand-
 ing" of the urgency of controlling population
 growth, a few are "even apathetic," and in some
 places population growth is "out of control."
 In January 1982 State Councilor Chen Muhua,
 former head of the State Family Planning Commis-
 sion, warned against a repeat of the baby boom of
 'Preliminary results of the 1982 census were released in late
 October. Population data used in the tables are based on the census
 and on statistics compiled by the Foreign Demographic Analysis
 Division (FDAD), Bureau of the Census. Population estimates from
 FDAD, Aird's Model 3, June 1982, fit closely with official Chinese
 census data for 1953, 1964, and 1982. Slight adjustments have been
 made. Chinese data are used for vital rates. Figures 1 and 6 have
 been constructed from data in Chen, Charles H. C., and Tyler,
 Carle W., "Demographic Implications of Family Size Alternatives
 in the People's Republic of China," The China Quarterly 89,
 March 1982, pp. 65-73. Chen and Tyler used an earlier 119801

 Note: Demographic analyses prepared by the Foreign Demographic
 Analysis Division, as well as those by many foreign demographers,
 argue that the  birth  and  death  rates  were considerably  higher
 during the 1950s than reported by the Chinese; differences between
 various estimates of vital rates from the late 1960 onward and
 Chinese figures are much smaller.

 Counting the Population
 The size of China's population has always been a
 mystery. Entering Beijing in 1644, the Manchus
 discovered that officials of the deposed Ming Dynasty
 already had the population returns completed for the
 year 1651 ! No modern census was undertaken until
 1953 when a population of 583 million was an-
 nounced-a~gure that exceeded earlier estimates by
 about 100 million. meter 1957 almost no population
 data were released, although another census was
 taken in 1964; in 1971 then Vice Premier Li Xiannian
 admitted in an interview that different government
 ministries used population estimates varying by as
 much as 80 million people.
 The nationwide census conducted 1-10 July 1982 had
 the benefit of assistance in the planning stages from
 .foreign demographers and the United Nations Mis-
 sion in China. Computers were imported from the
 West to assist the 5 million census workers with the
 collection and processing of data. Questionnaires
 were designed to ascertain 19 demographic factors;
 data on the number of children born last year and
 women of childbearing age in each household will be
 sign cant for gauging current and future population
 grc>wth rates.
 the 1960s, when China's growth averaged slightly
 more than 20 million people a year from 1964 to
 1973. Chen emphasized that "the hundreds of mil-
 lions who were born during the decade of uncon-
 trolled growth in the 1960s are now entering mar-
 riageable age. If they are not guided into the orbit
 of family planning, it will be almost impossible to
 keep our population within the limit of 1.2 billion at
 the end of the century."
 ? General Secretary Hu Yaobang in his report to the
 12th Party Congress in September 1982 warned
 that excessive population growth not only threatens
 modernization objectives but may even "disrupt
 social stability."
 The announced census, however, does not end specu-
 lation about its accuracy. One reason is that the
 census total is virtually identical (a less-than-l-
 million person difference) with previously published
 Chinese statistics based on household registration
 tabulation. Unresolved problems include reliance in
 the census enumeration on household registration
 tabulations that are updated yearly, the lack of                 a
 independent household lists compiled by a door-to-
 door survey, and the admission by officials that
 during the Cultural Revolution the registration sys-
 tem "turned into a mess. "Births in some rural areas
 may have been underreported to avoid penalties                25X1
 exacted for failure to meet one- or two-child family
 planning quotas. There is concern that the contradic-
 tion between the census results and population data
 previously submitted will expose earlier data ma-
 nipulations by local officials attempting to show
 "success" in family planning campaigns. More ques-
 tions also remain concerning previously published
 Chinese population data, particularly those on vital
 rates, that do not jibe, or seem plausible, with
 analyses made by Western demographers.
 ? Premier Zhao Ziyang in his 30 November report to
 the National People's Congress said that success of
 the current economic plan hinges on "strictly con-
 trolling" population growth.
 Family Planning Targets and Techniques
 The ticking of the Malthusian clock has caused the
 Chinese leadership to embrace increasingly stringent
 family planning policies over the past several years
 (appendix A). In 1979 Chen Muhua unveiled Beijing's
 population targets. The goals were ambitious: to lower
 the population growth rate from 12.05 per thousand in
 1978 to less than 10 per thousand by 1980, to five per
 thousand in 1985, and to achieve zero population

 Secret
 growth by the year 2000. The one-child family norm
 was introduced at this time as the means by which
 population growth could eventually be halted and
 reversed.
 The leadership has vacillated in its approaches to
 achieve these targets. As the birth rate began to rise
 in 1980, accounts of "remedial measures"-often
 meaning abortions-began to appear in the press.
 In some areas
 monetary penalties for noncompliance with family
 planning goals have been increased. Recent press
 reporting indicates that the harsher methods em-
 ployed in 1981-82 have also led to female infanticide
 by parents desiring a son. Premier Zhao Ziyang
 recently denounced this practice, demanding punish-
 ment for those responsible. Apparently, greater atten-
 tion and emphasis are to be placed on education of the
 people (appendix B). A national family planning prop-
 aganda work conference, convened in Beijing on
 1 November, developed materials for propagandizing
 more widely that "family planning is a national affair
 concerning the future of Communism."
 family-size projections (figure 1).
 Despite these efforts, optimism began to fade over
 reaching the original 1979 targets within a year after
 their unveiling. Although Chinese officials have pri-
 vately admitted to American officials that the~original
 population targets cannot be met, publically they
 continue to stress the 1.2-billion goal and its impor-
 tance as a target. According to recent Chinese projec-
 tions, if the present number of children (2.3) per
 woman is maintained, the population would reach
 1.282 billion by the end of the century-far in excess
 of China's goal. But if the family planning program
 has some success and the average number of children
 per woman of childbearing age is reduced to two, then
 the population forecast is 1.217 billion-a difference
 of 65 million. Even greater differences are apparent
 using different-and somewhat more unrealistic-

 Factors Behind Increased Growth Rate
 A number of factors have caused the resurgence of
 the birth rate and rate of natural increase in recent
 years:
 ? Rural economic policies that encourage individual
 initiative to spur production but weaken the author-
 ity of local officials.
 ? The effects of the new marriage law on the age of
 marriage and the large cohort of young people of
 marriageable age; in 1979, half the total population

 Rural responsibility systems were introduced in
 1978-79 as part of Deng Xiaoping's package of eco-
 nomic reforms. Although many variations of the
 responsibility system exist, all are designed to in-
 crease productivity by giving peasants a much larger
 role-and stake-in production and marketing deci-
 sions and by compensating individuals according to
 the amount they produce. Beijing claims that 90
 percent of the peasants have adopted some form of
 the production responsibility system; probably haUor
 more are using a system in which individual house-
 holds make some or all key agricultural decisions.
 Regardless of the system adopted, the state retains
 ownership of the land and requires a certain propor-
 tion of the output for tax and various collective
 needs. Part of'the rural reform package includes the
 reopening of free markets to sell above-quota output
 and an increase in procurement prices paid by the
 state for agricultural products.
 Because of the improved economic conditions in rural
 areas, the responsibility systems have also created a
 number of problems, rangingfrom a growing reluc-
 tance of young males to volunteer for military service
 to a decline in influence of state and local cadre
 attempting to implement national directives. The
 most serious in the long run, however, is an increase
 in birth rate in many rural areas, since in some of the
 more popular responsibility systems farmland is as-
 signed on the basis of family size.
 ? Several traditional factors, including old-age securi-
 ty fears.
 ? The general difficulty of implementing unpopular
 programs in the more remote and tradition-bound
 hinterland of China.
 ? A weakened system of rural control affecting family
 planning efforts.
 ? The political apathy of the population to govern-
 ment campaigns and distaste for its intrusion into
 family-size decisions.
 Government policies designed to spur agricultural
 production have had the unintended side effect of
 reinforcing traditional values toward children as an
 economic asset. Rural responsibility systems in which
 income is linked directly to production benefit fam-
 ilies with the most laborers. As rural family income
 increases, the economic incentives and disincentives
 associated with the one-child certificate become less
 useful methods to enforce compliance. In areas where
 individual households are the productive units, cadres
 have even less control over peasants who work their
 own land, raise their own food, and make their own
 decisions as to childbearing.
 Although it was intended to modernize, regulate, and
 stabilize marriage and family life, the 1980 Marriage
 Law undermines family planning goals. It raises the
 age of marriage to 20 years for women and 22 years
 for men, two years more than the 1950 Marriage Law
 but two to four years below the regulations estab-
 lished (though never based in law) in the 1960s and
 1970s and in regular use until 1980. As a People's
 Daily editorial recently stated, this has resulted in a
 "high tide of marrying younger and having children
 earlier."
 The new law also sends conflicting signals by estab-
 lishing children as the legal source of old-age support
 for their parents, while pressing for family planning.
 The traditional dependency relationship continues to
 motivate couples to have more than one child to
 ensure the survival of the family name and to relieve
 the burden on the single child. There is no national
 social security system or comprehensive rural retire-
 ment program. The few old-age homes widely publi-
 cized at earlier times by the media and Western
 visitors were built by the wealthier communes for old
 people without families. While generous pensions
 provide for about 8 million retired industrial and
 professional workers, the bulk of the working popula-
 tion-the hundreds of millions of agricultural work-
 ers-have no choice, but to devend upon their children
 for old-age support.
 The geographical remoteness of millions of peasants
 further impedes the progress of family planning. The
 static nature of peasant life, lack of mobility, poor
 transportation and communication, and distance from
 the cities contribute to the peasant's resistance to

 Figure S. A traditional rural family-three generations under one
 roof-will bent from rural reforms rewarding household units
 family planning, an idea that strongly conflicts with
 their tradition. There are also marked regional differ-
 ences in the acceptance and implementation of policy
 directives from the central government, particularly
 in those pr9vinces whe~e ethnic minority groups are
 numerous.
 Problems of implementing family planning policy are
 greater in rural areas, where bureaucratic administra-
 tion is often inefficient and where many cadres-
 party or government workers-are part of the com-
 munities in which they work. Cadres are torn between
 their responsibility to uphold and be models for an
 often unpopular governmental directive and their
 empathy for the economic and social perceptions of
 the peasants with whom they live. Beijing continues to
 pressure cadres to vigorously promote family planning
 goals as they did successfully in the 1970s and
 threatens to hold them personally responsible for
 achieving local targets with monetary or other penal-
 ties implied. Nevertheless, motivation and enthusiasm
 25X1
 25X1
 are lacking and the cadres' political clout is waning,
 according to Chinese press comments and editorials.
 Further resistance to family planning involves disaf-
 fection of the population at large, and of the younger
 generation in particular. According to Embassy re-
 porting and the views of scholars who have had lasting
 contacts, government policy vacillations and the nu-
 merous ideological campaigns of the past have trau-
 matized much of the populace; widespread indiffer-
 ence and cynicism exist toward the ideological
 pronouncements of the party. In addition, the official
 intrusion into family relationships, traditionally a very
 private matter, is much more pervasive than in the
 past and is resented by the conservative-minded peas-
 antry. Chinese media commentary have chided those

 Traditional values still persist. The heritage of a
 feudal patriarchal social system which permeates
 village life is a significant obstacle to family plan-
 ning. The expectation of living in an extended family
 situation surrounded by children and grandchildren
 is ingrained in the consciousness of the Chinese
 peasant. Although the government has long attempt-
 ed to stamp them out, ancient customs and traditions
 continue to give meaning to an otherwise monotonous
 and stolid rural l(fe. Peasant marriages, often ar-
 ranged and including the bride price, are still cele-
 brated with elaborate feasts as is the birth oja child,
 especially a son.
 The traditional preference for male children has
 rational justifications, especially in rural areas where
 males have greater economic value. Men produce
 more in the fields and so earn more because they are
 stronger and are uninhibited by child care. Although
 the 1980 Marriage Law gives women the right to
 work outside the home and guarantees equality for
 women, these new ideals have been selectively accept-
 ed. Women work in the fields, but they work fewer
 days than men because they are still responsible for
 overseeing the household and rearing children. Wom-
 en have less education-girls are often taken out of
 school to help with domestic chores-and less time to
 participate in community ctlfairs. Men remain with
 and support their parents all their lives; most women
 leave their parents when they marry to live with and
 help support their in-laws. Girls are considered an
 economic liability by their own parents; the incentive
 to have at least one son, preferably two, is still strong
 in rural areas.
 who feel that the party's mixing into family affairs is
 in opposition to the recently adopted legal code with
 its emphasis on the rights of the individual.
 Economic Implications: More Equals Less?
 China's leaders are committed to transforming the
 world's largest underdeveloped country into a modern
 industrialized state. The attainment of Beijing's eco-
 nomic development goals depends on the ability of the
 economy to generate the necessary amounts of invest-
 ment capital, the acquisition and effective absorption   25X1
 of a wide variety of advanced technologies, and
 consistency and coherency in economic planning.
 China's massive and growing population threatens
 modernization goals in numerous ways. At the most
 fundamental level, the demands of such a large.
 population for food and the bare essentials place a
 burden on the economy, making it extremely difficult
 to generate enough surplus funds for investment in
 modern industrial plant. Should the agricultural sec-
 tor be unable to increase food supplies apace with
 population growth, not only will limited funds be
 diverted to supply consumer needs, but precious for-
 eign exchange will be required to purchase grain.
 Premier Zhao Ziyang, speaking to the delegates at the
 Fifth National People's Congress, December 1981,
 bluntly stated the problem: if population growth is not
 controlled, the standard of living cannot be raised and
 "economic, cultural, and defense construction (that is,
 modernization) will not be carried out successfully."
 consequences are to be averted.
 The overabundance of labor relative to land, capital,
 and entrepreneurial expertise further hampers eco-
 nomic modernization. The agricultural sector has
 absorbed large increases of workers in the past, but its
 ability to continue doing so is limited; further in-
 creases in agricultural production will depend less on
 additional labor inputs and more on increased techno-
 logical inputs-mechanized irrigation, fertilizer, hy-
 brid seeds, and modern machinery. Furthermore, an
 increase in the cultivated acreage is unlikely. None-
 theless, the huge cohort of working-age individuals
 must be kept employed at wages adequate to satisfy
 their minimal consumer needs if social unrest and its
 Modernization goals are further threatened by the
 effect of the population factor on economic planning.
 The unpredictable and complex nature of demograph-
 ic projections complicates the planning process be-
 cause seemingly minor variations in growth rates
 translate into such large absolute numbers that the
 margin for success or failure of development plans is

 Note: The early years (1952-58) reflect rapid agricultural recovery
 and growth following restoration of peace and stability in 1950. The
 1958-61 period clearly illustrates the effects of the political
 extremism of the Great Leap Forward years, coupled with poor
 agricultural weather (1959-60). The period 1961-67 illustrates the
 subsequent economic recovery but overemphasizes growth ingrain
 output resulting from the abnormally low grain output levels
 recorded between 1959 and 1961. The effects of a high population
 growth rate on per capita output is shown in the data for the years
 between 1967 and iy73, despite continuing improvement in grain
 production. The impact of the family planning campaign on the rate
 of population growth is suggested by the compound rates of change,
 1973-82. The decline in grain output on a per capita basis since 1979
 coincides with the introduction of agricultural policies deemphasiz-
 inggrain targets and the shift of some cropland to growing profitable
 agricultural cash crops.
 very thin. In addition, the sociopolitical reactions to
 the policies required to achieve the population growth
 projections desired from an economic standpoint may
 themselves cause difficulty
 The population problem also impinges on moderniza-
 tion goals in the critical area of foreign trade and
 exchange. To keep the population employed, labor-
 intensive methods must be maintained and markets
 found for labor-intensive products. To move into the
 world of modern industrial technology and competi-
 tion, the foreign exchange so earned must be chan-
 neled into purchase of modern labor-saving industrial
 technology and plant rather than returned directly to
 the worker-consumer. To the extent that the agricul-
 tural sector cannot sustain personal needs, technologi-
 cal imports will be curtailed and grain imports in-
 creased.
 The Food and Population Dilemma. Improved agri-
 cultural performance is required not only to supply
 basic food needs and to improve living standards but
 also to make commodities available for export and 25X1
 otherwise release foreign exchange for investment
 capital. The leadership's awareness of the food prob-
 lem is exemplified by then Vice Premier's Li Xian-
 nian's 1978 statement-"the saying: `for the people
 the supreme thing is food, food comes first,' should
 never be forgotten. If we neglect the problem of food
 we shall have to face turmoil some day." Despite
 population growth that has nearly doubled in the
 more than three decades of Communist rule, grain
 production generally has kept pace and there has even
 been a slight improvement in grain production per
 capita (table 2). The improvement in the overall
 agricultural picture over the last 30 years, however
 masks several important features of the record.

 Primarily as a result of the political aberrations of the
 Great Leap Forward (1958-59), grain production de-
 clined precipitously, food shortages were widespread,
 and population growth virtually ceased. One result
 was the beginning of grain imports in 1961, mainly
 wheat, averaging between 2 and 5 percent of yearly
 grain output; since 1977 grain imports have been
 rising both in absolute and percentage terms. Al-
 though grain output increased steadily after 1961 and
 by 1965 reached the 1957-58 level, it was not until the
 mid-1970s that per capita production levels reached
 those achieved during the mid-1950s. During the past
 three years, production per person has virtually stag-
 nated. Whether this trend will continue is uncertain,
 but the implications are serious as to the realization of
 China's modernization goals (table 2, note).
 Severe physical limitations and nagging environmen-
 tal problems pose a major constraint to agricultural
 growth. According to Chinese statistics, only 10 per-
 cent of the total land area (99.4 million hectares) is
 cultivated; most of the little additional land suitable
 for agriculture is located in remote areas, is costly to
 develop, and is generally of comparatively low produc-
 tivity potential. The small amount of land added
 annually has been offset by land taken out of cultiva-
 tion-often in .highly productive areas-for urban
 expansion, new industry, and other agricultural uses.
 In addition, there is growing environmental deteriora-
 tion. The deforestation of key watersheds and destruc-
 tion of grasslands, attributed to poor management and
 political campaigns calling for growing more grain
 regardless of terrain conditions, has grieviously wors-
 ened erosion in many areas. Chinese officials and
 scientists have warned of the serious short- and long-
 term effects of environmental degradation on land
 availability, quality, and productivity.
 The Unemployment Drag. Until 1979 there was little
 mention of unemployment in China, and the general
 impression-fostered by Beijing and visitors to Chi-
 na-was that almost everyone was working happily
 and productively. Since then Beijing has admitted
 that unemployment and underemployment are serious
 problems. Although publicity has been focused on
 urban areas and on the plight of returned youth from
 the countryside, there is also a growing problem of
 unemployment and underemployment in rural areas

 as well. The problem is a major one, of both current
 and long-term concern to the Chinese leadership. The
 age structure of the population means that by the end
 of the century, the population will most probably
 increase between 20 and 30 percent, and the labor
 force will grow between 40 and 50 percent. The great
 surge in the birth rate from the mid-1960s through
 the early 1970s is the major cause of this rapid
 increase in the labor force (figure 6).
