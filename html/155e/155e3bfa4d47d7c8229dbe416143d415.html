 17 January 1964
 Chinese military doctrine, developed by Mao
 Tse-tung in the 1930s to meet pre-nuclear mili-
 tary situations, has been maintained almost intact
 into the 1960s.   The major problem facing the
 Chinese military forces--how to defend China against
 an enemy armed with nuclear weapons and other un-
 conventional arms--has not been met but has been
 side-stepped..  Although this is partly because the
 Chinese, with no nuclear capability, have no simple
 alternative,  it is also the result of the heavy
 influence of political ideology on military think-
 ing.
 Mao's decision to challenge the Soviet Union
 has affected military doctrine in two ways:  the
 cutoff of Soviet aid in modernizing China's armed
 forces requires adherence to a doctrine in many
 ways as antiquated as its instrument, and Mao's
 writings on military strategy are trumpeted so as
 to enhance the claim that he has creatively enriched
 Marxist-Leninist thought in this area as in others
 and thus deserves to lead the Communist world.
 Aside from its weakness as a defensive strategy
 for China today, Maoist revolutionary doctrine does
 have a major application in the 1960s--as an offen-
 sive doctrine to be used by Communists in under-
 developed countries as a guide in their attempts to
 overthrow established governments.
 Chinese Communist military
 doctrine is the product of more
 than 30 years of development.
 Although influenced by the mili-
 tary strategy of foreign coun-
 tries,  in particular that of the
 Soviet Union,  the Chinese have
 relied primarily on their own
 experience for their military
 strategy and tactics.
 As in every other aspect
 of current Chinese Communist
 thinking,  the seminal influence
 has been Mao Tse-tung.   His
 basic concepts were formulated
 during the days of the Chinese
 Communist guerrilla warfare
 and are still maintained.   Any
 attempt to separate out the
 elements which still have valid-
 ity and are consciously applied
 from those maintained for purely
 propaganda purposes must remain
 tentative because of the lack
 of available information.   Un-
 like the Soviet Union, China
 permits no open discussion of
 over-all military doctrine.   No

 Chinese reviews or journals
 dealing with military affairs
 are regularly available, and
 only scattered issues of the
 Liberation Army Daily have been
 obtained in the pas  five years.
 The single most valuable source
 has been the secret Chinese Com-
 munist military documents cap-
 tured by Tibetan guerrillas in
 October 1961.
 The Basic Doctrine
 These documents indicate
 that Chinese military doctrine
 still focuses on defensive war,
 and there is virtually no evi-
 dence that Chinese Communist
 leaders are preparing for or
 thinking in terms of an offen-
 sive strategy by their own
 forces outside Chinese terri-
 tory.   References to policy,
 preparedness and training are
 concerned with a defensive war
 fought on Chinese territory
 against an enemy, probably the
 US, employing nuclear weapons.
 Chinese doctrine thus re-
 mains centered on the means
 available to destroy any occu-
 pying force.   The strategy fol-
 lowed in the war against Japan,
 involving the use of both guer-
 rilla and regular warfare,
 would probably be modified and
 used in any war against another
 invader.   The Chinese acknowl-
 edge that nuclear weapons can
 destroy China's industrial ca-
 pacity, but they argue that the
 effectiveness of nuclear weap-
 ons used tactically will be
 reduced markedly by maintain-
 ing close contact with the
 enemy and by fighting at night.
 Mao's doctrine stresses
 the dominance of men and of
 politics, and maintains that
 the thoroughly indoctrinated
 and trained soldier will always
 be more important than the
 weapons he employs.   Another
 basic doctrine, that of the
 "people's war," in which "every
 man is a soldier," amounts to
 total mobilization in all areas
 under Communist control.   Faced
 initially with an overwhelmingly
 stronger enemy, Mao rejected
 "the completely groundless theory
 of quick victory" for either
 side, and formulated the strategy
 and tactics of a "protracted"
 war.
 These principles envisage
 an initial retreat before power-
 ful enemy forces until lengthen-
 ing supply lines and enemy dis-
 persion would permit the estab-
 lishment of defense positions.
 There would follow a period of
 stalemate as Chinese forces were
 concentrated to bring about the
 defeat and annihilation of
 enemy forces through superior
 mobility and a concentration
 of force in critical areas.   The
 theory calls for trading space
 for time, for a gradual build-
 up of forces, and for the dis-
 sipation of the enemy's will to
 fight by both military and psy-
 chological warfare.   During
 the stalemate stage there is
 to be heavy dependence on the
 militia and on guerrilla war-
 fare, and the major goal of the
 Communists is to change the
 balance gradually through a
 large-scale reduction of the
 enemy's armed forces and thus
 set up conditions for a counter-
 offensive.

 Chinese thought on the role
 of nuclear weapons in military
 doctrine is ambiguous and con-
 tradictory, reflecting the dif-
 ficulty in which the Chinese
 find themselves because they
 maintain a hostile world view
 without adequate arms to back
 up their hostility.   Although
 Mao Tse-tung and other Chinese
 Communist leaders have repeatedly
 downgraded  the effectiveness
 of nuclear weapons, the regime
 nevertheless tacitly acknowl-
 edges their importance by de-
 voting considerable effort and
 investment to develop its own
 nuclear weapons.
 In recognition of their
 vital role today, Chinese For-
 eign Minister Chen Yi stated in
 October 1963 that China would
 have to manufacture nuclear
 weapons, missiles and supersonic
 aircraft or degenerate into a
 second-class or third-class na-
 tion.   He expressed this deter-
 mination when he noted that the
 Chinese would develop nuclear
 weapons, even if it meant a
 reduction in consumer goods pro-
 duction, even if it meant they
 had to go without trousers.
 the effects of nuclear weapons,
 even in the classified Tibetan
 documents, might reflect an
 inadequate knowledge of their
 true effects, but it more likely
 is a recognition that a power
 without these weapons must
 ignore or derogate them if it
 is to continue to insist that
 it is a great power.   In addi-
 tion, as Mao has himself pointed
 out, any undue emphasis on the
 use or destructiveness of nu-
 clear weapons could only have
 a detrimental effect in China,
 frightening the people and
 undermining their morale and
 their will to fight.
 Thus Chinese doctrine con-
 tinues to maintain that weapons
 cannot be decisive in war, that
 the thoroughly indoctrinated
 and trained soldier will always
 be more important than the
 weapons he employs.   It is in
 this context that the Chinese
 claim that the "spiritual atomic
 bomb" is more important than
 the material one.   Such state-
 ments, made partly to maintain
 the morale of the Chinese fight-
 ing man, must be read in the
 light of the high priority
 given to the nuclear weapons
 program.
 Peiping's willingness to
 beggar itself in order to de-
 velop modern means of warfare
 suggests that the Chinese propa-
 ganda  debunking the power and
 role of these weapons in a future
 war is largely an effort by the
 Chinese leaders to rationalize
 the predicament in which they
 find themselves.  The Chinese
 refusal to discuss realistically
 In another notable contra-
 diction  between Chinese propa-
 ganda and Chinese action, Pei-
 ping claims that the US will
 never dare to use nuclear weap-
 ons, but it has been careful
 since the Korean war to avoid
 situations where a direct con-
 frontation with US military
 power would arise.   In this
 way the Chinese remain true to

 Marshal Yeh Chien-ying, at Military Training
 Conference, January 1961
 If there is a war in the next several years,
 what kind of weapon shall we principally rely
 on to defeat our enemies? Here we are con-
 fronted with a question concerning the rela-
 tionship between conventional and unconven-
 tional weapons. Atomic weapons are indeed
 very powerful but they can be used only to
 destroy strategic points and the economic
 potential of the country during strategic air
 attacks, and to prepare the way for an actual
 offensive attack.  However, the army and
 conventional weapons are necessary to solve
 the main problem of a war, to eliminate the
 enemy, to occupy battlefields, and to win a
 victory.
 To rely on the army and conventional
 weapons is to rely on manpower. Therefore,
 manpower still constitutes the main factor in
 war. We rely on manpower, and stress the
 political factor. US militarists know clearly
 that they cannot rely on manpower to win a
 victory over China and the Soviet Union.
 They have to rely on nuclear weapons.
 If there is a war within the next several
 years, we will have to rely on the weapons we
 hove on hand.  How can we defeat our enemy
 by using the weapons we have on hand? Our
 enemy is stronger than we are in distant fight-
 ing, but close fighting, especially face to face
 fighting, is more advantageous to us. In the
 event of war in the next several years, we can
 defeat our enemy by using close combat even
 though we have no unconventional weapons.
 Marshal of Aviation Vershinin, 1949
 The underestimation of the infantry reflects
 the fear of the imperialist bourgeoisie of their
 peoples, of mass armies.... Not having re-
 liable reserves of manpower at their disposal,
 the warmongers boom and exaggerate the role
 of air power out of all proportion. These ideas
 emanate from the completely distorted view
 that the outcome of war can be decided by
 some kind of weapon alone. History has proved
 the reverse more than once.
 Marshal Moskalenko, 1954
 Soviet military science decisively rejects
 any arbitrary fabrications of bourgeoisie mili-
 tary theorists that one could achieve strategic
 victory by employment of one or another new
 weapon. There are no such weapons which
 possess exceptional and all-powerful qualities.
 Historical experience teaches that with the
 appearance of new technology, new more power-
 ful and more destructive weapons, the signifi-
 cance of men on the battlefield not only does
 not decrease but increases all the more.
 From Military Strategy, 1962
 (Editor: Marshal Sokolovsky)
 Modern strategic weapons make it possible
 to achieve decisive results and at times even
 victory without utilizing the means and forces
 of the tactical and operational elements....
 Under modern conditions, if a state does not
 have nuclear weapons at its disposal, it could
 never achieve victory over an opponent that
 did.... The country that finds itself in a catas-
 trophic situation as the result of mass nuclear-
 missile strikes may be forced to surrender even
 before its armed forces have suffered any de-
 cisive defeat.

 Mao's dictum, "despise the enemy
 strategically, but respect him
 tactically."  They can continue
 to claim that the US is a "paper
 tiger" without testing whether
 or not it has teeth.
 In their propaganda, the
 Chinese have drawn a parallel
 between the use of poison gas
 and the use of nuclear weapons
 in war, declaring that nuclear
 weapons are no more likely to
 be used today than was poison
 gas in World War II.  They have
 in the past attributed US un-
 willingness to use nuclear
 weapons to fear of Soviet retal-
 iation.   The probable loss of
 their protected position behind
 the Soviet nuclear "umbrella"
 does not appear to weigh as
 heavily as might be expected
 with the Chinese leaders, nor
 do they profess to be as fear-
 ful of the prospect of general
 nuclear warfare as Moscow is.
 While the Chinese often
 publicly state that the likeli-
 hood of war is not high, the
 Tibetan documents make numerous
 references to the possibility
 of a surprise attack.   All in-
 formation available indicates
 that, though the Chinese believe
 a surprise nuclear attack would
 be enormously destructive, they
 have an equally firm belief
 that it would not be decisive
 or mean defeat for China in the
 initial stage of the war.
 Chinese statements regard-
 ing the impact of nuclear weapons
 in a future war are similar to
 those of the Soviet Union before
 it became a major nuclear power.
 During that period statements
 made by Soviet political and
 military leaders discounted the
 effectiveness of nuclear weapons,
 and there was little stress on
 nuclear warfare in Soviet strategy
 and tactics.
 Now, however, Soviet mili-
 tary thinking, which in the
 past has concentrated on the
 problems of waging war in the
 European land theater, has been
 broadened to include the strategic
 problems of intercontinental
 warfare.   It considers the
 initial nuclear exchange de-
 cisive in the sense that if one
 loses it, all is lost.   But it
 continues to stress the possi-
 bility of a long war, conducted
 by large armies and won by the
 destruction of the enemy's armed
 forces and the seizure and oc-
 cupation of his territory.
 In contrast, Chinese doc-
 trine, concerned primarily with
 defensive warfare, has not
 delved into the problem of de-
 feating and occupying the home-
 land of a potential aggressor
 such as the US.   Considering
 the capabilities of the Chinese
 armed forces, such a discussion
 would be wholly academic.
 The Tibetan documents do
 not reveal any concentrated ef-
 fort to prepare for nuclear at-
 tack, or even for large-scale
 conventional bombing attacks.
 The few surface-to-air missile
 sites available are insufficient
 to act as a real deterrent to
 an attack by a modern bomber
 force.   There have been isolated
 reports that atomic training,

 mostly of the passive defensive
 type, is being given to Chinese
 troops.  There have been scat-
 tered reports of air-raid drills.
 A few army officers were assigned
 in 1960 to scientific research
 organs and specialized technical
 units, indicating preparations
 for integration of advanced
 weapons as they become avail-
 able.
 A campaign was initiated
 in 1959 to disperse military
 bases and to carry out future
 construction near or under hills
 and cliffs in order to reduce
 the effects of a nuclear attack.
 The Tibetan documents indicate
 that this plan was unsuccessful
 in 1960 and 1961, and implementa-
 tion since then seems unlikely
 in view of the sharp reduction
 in all construction.   A June
 1961 directive claimed that
 failure to carry out this plan
 resulted from general apathy
 and lack of awareness of the
 destructiveness of nuclear
 weapons.   So long as Peiping's
 lack of nuclear weapons requires
 it to downgrade their effective-
 ness, this situation can be ex-
 pected to continue.
 The Policy of "Self-Reliance"
 As is the case with Chinese
 rationalizations on the effects
 of nuclear warfare, Peiping's
 insistence on the need for mili-
 tary, as well as economic, self-
 reliance is more a justification
 than a policy.   Until 1959, the
 Chinese were more than willing
 to accept Soviet assistance in
 modernizing their armed forces,
 as they accepted economic assist-
 ance to modernize their entire
 economy.   Their open refusal to
 accept less than an equal status
 in the Communist bloc, however,
 precipitated a Soviet decision
 to halt military assistance, as
 well as to apply economic sanc-
 tions, in an effort to curb Chi-
 nese independence.   Because
 there was no simple alternative
 open to the Chinese short of
 surrendering this independence,
 they adopted a policy of self-
 reliance.
 The Tibetan documents showed
 the severe setback which the pro-
 gram for modernizing the armed
 forces suffered in 1960 and 1961
 and the concomitant steady de-
 terioration in their capability
 to fight an enemy well equipped
 with advanced' conventional and
 unconventional arms.   The scat-
 tered information available since
 then indicates continued decline
 in 1962 and 1963, particularly
 the air force and the navy.   Even
 in the army,  items of heavy ord-
 nance, including armor, are not
 being increased, and a serious
 question of its ability to main-
 tain even its present armored
 capability has arisen.  The cut-
 back in the supply of new weapons
 has forced the military to place
 renewed emphasis on maintenance
 and economy.
 This is a situation which
 no professional military leaders
 could accept with equanimity and
 the Chinese were no exception.
 The policy of military self-re-
 liance was vigorously opposed
 by many military leaders, led
 by Peng Te-huai,  then minister
 of national defense.   Peng argued

 for the continuing need for So-
 viet military and economic
 assistance, even if this meant
 some degree of Russian control
 over Chinese military-economic
 policies.   Mao, however, had
 already made the decision to
 be independent of Soviet con-
 trols even if it cost the re-
 maining Soviet assistance, and
 in mid-1959 Peng and a number
 of his followers were purged.
 This drastic move apparently
 has stopped open expression of
 disagreement within the mili-
 tary with Mao's present policies,
 but it could hardly have erased
 all military dissension.   Dis-
 satisfaction in high military
 circles over the delays in
 modernizing the armed forces
 still exists, particularly in
 the air force, where some ele-
 ments are reported to favor a
 political accommodation with Mos-
 cow as a means of restoring
 Soviet military aid to China.
 There are no indications, how-
 ever, that disgruntled military
 men are willing to take on the
 party leadership in regard to
 the dispute with the USSR or
 the schedule of priorities
 established in over-all economic
 development.
 In the Chinese adoption
 of a policy of "self-reliance"
 in military affairs can be seen
 the direct impact of political
 thinking on military affairs.
 It is a clear illustration of
 how political decisions shape
 military doctrine over the pro-
 tests of the military hierarchy
 and to the detriment of China's
 military posture.  The loss of
 outside aid in modernizing
 the Chinese military machine
 condemns the Chinese for some
 time to come to make do with
 what is essentially an anti-
 quated force.   They are forced
 thereby to maintain a military
 doctrine developed during a
 different time and fitting a
 different situation, because
 it takes into account the type
 of military forces they still
 have and the only type of war
 they would be able to fight.
 This is likely to be a tempo-
 rary expedient and the Chinese
 can be expected, when they are
 able, to modernize their armed
 forces and then adjust their
 military doctrine to meet their
 new capabilities.
 The Chinese point  to
 their own successful revolu-
 tion as an example for revolu-
 tionaries in Latin America,
 Africa, and Asia, and believe
 that in conflicts that have
 taken place in Indochina,
 Cuba, and Algeria, and in the
 one now under way in South
 Vietnam, Maoist revolutionary
 doctrine has considerable appli-
 cability.   These claims have
 much more validity than the
 views of the Chinese that Mao's
 doctrine is applicable to the
 defense of the mainland against
 armed forces equipped with nu-
 clear weapons.
 Leaders of the revolutions
 in Cuba, Indochina, and Algeria
 have acknowledged their debt
 to Maoist strategy and the Chi-
 nese experience.   Castro,

 speaking of guerrilla warfare
 in December 1961, referred. to
 the precedent of the Chinese
 struggle.  Vo Nguyen Giap,
 minister of defense of North
 Vietnam and commander in chief
 of the Viet Minh Army,  in his
 book, People's War, People's
 Army, referred to thessons
 learned "from the valuable ex-
 perience of the Chinese rev-
 olution, which have enriched
 the theories of the national
 democratic revolution, of rev-
 olutionary war, and of the
 army in a semicolonial country."
 Algerian leaders have referred
 to the "vast influence" of the
 Chinese revolution on their
 revolution and on other revolu-
 tionary movements in Asia and
 Africa.
 Maoist doctrine--as re-
 stated in 1963--calls for using
 the peasants as the main force
 in this type of war and for the
 establishment of rural base
 areas protected by peasant armies
 as the "only way to surround the
 cities" and finally take them.
 Politically, Mao stresses the
 use of the united front as a
 means for Communists to gain
 control of nationalist move-
 ments in underdeveloped areas.
 His doctrine emphasizes the
 necessity of building up pop-
 ular support before victory can
 be won in such a war, but
 denies the need for such support
 to begin one.
 During 1963 the Chinese
 placed an increased emphasis on
 Maoist revolutionary doctrine.
 This is indicated by the publi-
 cation of the Selected Military
 Writings of Mao Tse-tung, by
 the extend nEservance of the
 25th anniversary of the publi-
 cation of Mao's On Protracted
 War and by the concern of
 People's Daily, the English-
 language Peking Review, and
 other Chinese public Lions
 with the applicability of Maoist
 doctrine to "revolutionary
 struggle" in underdeveloped
 areas.  This concern with
 "national liberation" wars is
 due partially to the Chinese
 Communists' belief that the
 time is ripe for pushing Maoist
 revolutionary doctrine in under-
 developed areas and partially
 to their feeling that stress on
 guerrilla war and revolution will
 give them the edge'over the
 USSR in the struggle to gain
 control of Communist movements
 in these areas.
 The Chinese Communists'
 military doctrine is and will
 continue to be basically de-
 fensive, so long as they do not
 have nuclear weapons and a delivery
 capability.  Peiping, however,
 remains willing to use its armed
 forces in Asia in circumstances
 that Chinese leaders deem to,
 involve little risk of war with
 the United States.
 Mao's guerrilla concepts,
 adjusted to suit local condi-
 tions, will continue to be
 stressed by the Chinese as a
 guide to be used by revolutionaries

 in "national-liberation" wars.
 In Southeast Asia, for example,
 the terrain, the political sit-
 uation, and the logistical-com-
 munications problems would re-
 quire almost exclusive reliance
 on guerrilla warfare.
 The Chinese realize that
 nuclear weapons can cause im-
 mense destruction and appear
 determined to continue to give
 high priority to their own nu-
 clear weapons program.  However,
 until a nuclear capability is
 achieved, they are likely to
 continue to stress the dominance
 of men and of politics in war

 and to place heavy emphasis on
 the major role of the ground
 forces and reject any theory
 that use of nuclear weapons
 might bring quick and decisive
 victory.  They will also con-
 tinue to profess less concern
 over both the possibility of and
 disastrous effects of a nuclear
 war than the USSR and use this as
 partial justification for urging
 on the world Communist movement
 a hard line opposing a detente
 with the US and favoring mil-
 itancy and violence as a means
 of obtaining power.   (SECRET
