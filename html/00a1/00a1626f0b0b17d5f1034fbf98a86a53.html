 STUDENTS UNDER COMMUNISM
 At a certain moment the human intellect comes of age; and when it

 censorship nor in the leading-strings of prudence.

 STUDENTS UND'F?R COMPI1NISM--whatever t .eir aiation lit`yr---are disgruntled,
 restless, depressed, disaffected, fruetr^ated, riscouraged, indifferent and
 rebellious. They are united only in their diecont,erit and, sometimes, in
 their explosive actions to break the chains r): ' bondage.
 Their parades, rallies, strikes, deziionstrations, resistance, riots,
 boycotts, petitions, demands, manifestoes, skirmishes, etc., are testimony of
 their unrest. Such protests stem from youth who have been subjected to long-
 time Communist indoctrination as well as from those more recently subjected
 to Commmnist control;  they take place in Soviet Russia as well as in the so-
 called satellites.
 Nowhere has this unity off` disaffection been so dramaticall.yr revealed as
 in the student-stimulated Hungarian fteirolution.  P,eve,.: bora;a,tifons from that
 student battle with Soviet troops, were felt throughout the Communist world.
 Students in other Communist countries gave vent to their fi'eelings; and, as in
 Hungary, Communist leaders applied controls and force to quell the spirit of
 rebellion.
 STUDENTS UNDER COrIruNIS1A are subjected to riles and controls which are
 strikingly similar throughout the Co.r nuri,' world.  There are required political
 studies, forced indoctrination, controli d cutr iCua?-ur.a, regimented vacations,
 enforced tranfers, class quotas, directed et pioyraent, forced labor, censorship,

 But there is little evidence so far that the party leaders' new camraippxs

 A Communist counterattack is under -way againr?t China.' s restless students.
 Not only have several million students been induced to leave the classroom for
 the farm, but hundreds of Cara^.un.st ar an.zers are being slipped into top posts of
 institutions of higher learning to assure part--v- leadership over the educ tional
 f font.
 In an apparent effort to turn criticism into harmless channels, students and
 teachers are being encouraged to debate such burning topics as the supply of refer-
 ence materials and thrifty school management.  Meantime, pol.it ical studi s in the
 gchools are being. stepped up.  A timely course on  the correct handling of contra-
 dictions within the ranks of the people" is being introduced to new student
 audiences.
 These are among the device  announced by Chinese Communist sources to deal
 with a student body that rioted Vigorously a.grainst the goverrar;,ent last June in
 central China.  Other news Of str.t1e::at strik ss in V1u:har, Harbin and elsewhere caused
 Dr. Flu Shih, famed Chinese   .ilosopher, to assert that China :last June narrowly
 missed a.    A, 16,d. popllar?u-arising of the Fliusgarian type.
 Recent months, however, ,:pave brought a lull in reports of student unrest
 except for that generated by the  i_.nt tz-;.sv,r r of :i,udc its and. other groups into
 badly needed agricultural uz~rk.  Communist youth groups are trying to combat even
 this discontent by more indoctrination.  Youth is told to think abr_ait "pro(luctive
 labor and group spirit. .   and. to overcome the idea of overlooking toiling labor
 and belittling workers and peasan. ts.
 If the rebelliousus sit of Chinese students shown last June can be perrn.anentl.y
 broken, then the Communists will have achi3ved something new in recent Chinese
 history,
 For more than three decades Chinese student- have been an, important,
 independent --minded force in their count z 's a.ff'airs.  Political r:mcvenia.-rts have
 found them ardent but not wholly reliable allies.  Students traditionally have been
 mare loyal to policies than to politics,  ;rxd many governments before the Communists
 have been embarrassed by student activities.

 In recent decades, except when war or the Kuomintang Party of Chiang Kai-shik
 immobilized them, Chinese students used their collective stren:,th toQress _re:rorms
 on their govori-mr-nt.  Usually their aims were r tion,li_stic or anti-irnprial.istic:
 They led a protest movement that resulted in Chii-la's r:,fusal to sign the
 Versailles treaty.
 They led na ss action resulting in the re si  ati.ons of Chinese dov,ern ment
 "traitors" accused of selling out China's Shantung province to
 organized and directed a three-year boycott of Japanese goods.
 Japan; they also
 They headed a r cxt.ilar movement in. the 1920s against what they considered
 unfair treaties imposed on China by imperialist powers.
 By tens of thousands they pilgrimaged to Nanking headsuarters in. 1931 to beg
 Generalissimo Chiang to drive advancing Oapanese troops out of Manchuria.
 With these campaigns and many others Chinese students established themselves
 as _lea.der  of the people.
 When the Chinese Reds came to power, they did so with the support of students,
 part of China's intellectual class.  In return youth won a high place in the new
 government.  Young. Chinese got choice government jobs.  They became sleuths in the
 hunt for ideological inrotics.  Youth had an active role in the accusation meetings
 that sti.gm.ati.zed countless adults in the terror-ri den years of 1951-52.  The young
 became aggressive, unnerving overseers of their parents' and        teachers"
 political consciences.
 The Communist regime's early attention to youth seemed to pay off.  At least
 as late as 1952 missionaries emerging fror7 Re-1 China, testified to youth's apparent
 unflinching loyalty to a party that provided it with prestige and opportunity
 unlimited.
 Once the indoctrinated younger generation was fully in control, malty experts
 predicted, the traditional individualism of the Chinese people would be lost beyond
 recovery.  Yet in last June's riots, the 800 reported rioters were middle-school
 youngsters indoctrinated in little but Communist ways.
 Many other signs point to mounting-; disillusionment of mtudents with the
 government .
 For years a trickle of youthful discontent has appeared in the'Communist press.
 After tho government started allocating  lobs to university P-raduates, complaints

 began appearing in 1952 and .1953.  These were directed against the type of job
 awarded or the distance of assignments from their families.
 The complaints still- were corning through in 1956 but seemed to have produced
 no real reforms.  Students trained as electrical engineers, it was charged at a
 'cuth group meeting, were assigned to machine--building jobs.  Those studying
 machine--build.ing were made storekeepers.
 The government has kept up a running battle, too, against young people who
 want to use their heads but not their bands.  As early as 1953 the Chinese press
 claimed that youth should be directed toward "glorious work" in the fields and
 factories.  This followed a government notice that lower level education would not
 be further expanded.
 A month before the recent riots the Communist Party Central Committee, in a
 message to a Peking youth conference, urged young people to "rcomba.t remaining
 tendencies to regard manual labor as contemptible."  Manual labor instead should
 be regarded as a "glorious obligation."
 This type of pep tall: has c::ntinued with the need for new fain workers to step
 up agricultural production and to replenish the supply of rural workers who migrated
 to the ciiti.es
 Student ideological troubles Inve been conceded, too, in Chinese press reports,.
 Some sty ents still have unhealthy thout.r,hts, it was reported last January after a
 Poking, conference on hi };her education.  A minority of students was said to ovrem-
 ghasize democracy sand personal freedom..  Some even wanted "the collective body to
 yield to the individual."  The suggested Communist treatment in this and similar
 cases was more indoctrination in collectivism., more political education. .
 The Communist Party is meeting the challenge typically:  By assigning high--
 level party and government Communists to top posts in schools, in scientific
 research institutes, and on newspapers. In the schools these Communists will serve
 as presidents, vice presidents, deans and in other high administrative places.
 A period of severe regimentation appears to be the price Chinese students will
 pay for their short-lived revolt.

 The student unrest which has been so noticeable recently in the Soviet Union
 .'s
 and Eastern Europe seems to be spreading as far afield as China.  The Peking People.
 Daily yesterday complained that some students hid no "clear understanding of the
 meaning of democratic freedom," while others failed to distinguish between "us and
 the enemy.". . ,
 The Chinese authorities have long had considerable difficulty in "re-educating"
 the old. intelligentsia and its children, but the present difficulty is of a new
 kind.  The reference to the students' misinterpretation of the meaning of democratic
 freedom suggests that the recent attempts at "democratisation" in China have led
 the students to demand more freedom than the scope of democratisation was intended
 to provide.      gas happened in the other Communist Countries.
 Last month, for instance, a Peking radio report referred to the desire among
 the students "to put individual interests above collective interests" --- which is
 an old complaint--but added that other "unhealthy thoughts" included "over-ei1~ Isis
 on democracy gnd individual freedom."  The party conference of Peking institutions
 of higher learning at which these unhealthy thoughts were noted attributed them to
 failure to strengthen ideological education. . . .

 Peking, Feb. 13 (Reuter) - The Peorle's Dail  said today that 80 per cat of
 Chinese university students were from non-proletari_an families and their way of
 thought must be criticised and put right "as we would cure a patient."
 The newspaper reporting a, recent meeting of the Youth League, said. . .
 Because of the lack of understanding of the class point of view, some students
 "fail to have a clear understanding of the meaning of democratic freedom and a mall

 to increase their courses in political theory as a result of the Hungarian events.
 High schools, colleges and universities are to devote an entire week to
 lessons in political. theory.

 Hongkong Standard, March 3, 1957, "Red China. Gives Hint of Unrest in Colleges"
 Tokyo, March 2 (UP) - Communist China today gave a strong hint of unrest among
 the college and university students it hopes some day will be the Red rulers.
 In a newspaper editorial reported t 3ay by Peking Radio "a mnall number" of
 college students were criticized for "divorcing their study f ro~~., the world around
 them."
 The criticism comes as reports leaking out of the Chinese Minland suggest
 that students there, as in almost all Communist nations including Russia itself are
 not completely saitsfied, with the Communist .ways of doing things,
 The criticism against the Chinese students appeared in 'the Kwan{s niYl  D .i.   which
 said. that "most students are interested in world event s and political science but a
 small number are divorcing their stuly from the world around them.'"
 "The paper reminds college students that t ie y will soon take part in building
 socialism and should intdrest themselves in political affairs," the radio said.
 The  anall.. portion of the editorial, reported by the radio gave no further clues
 as to what brought on the criticism.
 However, Western sources in the Far !past have reported that Con- unist China
 has launched a new "reeducation campaign"to combat repeated student questioning of
 the Peking version of recent developments in Eastern Europe where satellite upris-
 ings against Soviet rulers have taken place.
 Far Eastern Economic Review, March 7, 1957, "Despondency Among Communist Youth"
 It is significant that China as well as the other Comniunist countries have been
 compelled in recent weeks to take special pains to persuade even their own following,
 and especially the younger generation, that Communism is still the wave of the future.
 It is an admission that scepticism about this is now growing and general, that the
 old enthusiasm which has endured for half-a-dozen years or more is going as the
 youths of .1949 grow into maturity and their successors find life harder and harder.
 It has been said that the ferment in the Soviet Union has hardly begun to work.
 What is clear is that the overweening self-confidence of the early days has gone.

 Peking Radio admitted on January 22 that after more than six years of thorough-
 going indoctrination, students in Communist China still nurture "unr,ealth,-;,_ houa:hts"
 (which some observers translate as apt i-Communist feelings) even in the capital,
 where indoctrination has been pushed the hardest.  The broadcast criticised the stu-
 dents' "over-emphasis on democracy and individual freedom, and even the desire to
 put individual interest above national interest."  It is significant that the admis-
 sion  came after the closing of a four-day conference of Comm nist Party committees
 from the higher educational institutions in Peking. A month before the official
 organ of the Youth League admitted that a feeling of frustration had recently been
 engendered among some of the young cadres in the rural areas.  "When some young
 cadres,`. League members and young people, see the poor harvests and living difficul-
 ties of the masses, and when they see the improper job of recordning and distributior
 of income in certain agricultural producer co-operatives, they begin to doubt the
 prospects of APCs.  Some young people devote themselves to side occupations, losing
 interest in agricultural production.  Others try to find their own outlets."
 China News Analysis, April 19, 1957, "Unfriendly Youth"
 The cry of the young for freedom was universal last term.  In Harbin, Alanchuria,
 for example, the students wanted democracy and freedom and were unwilling to hear
 anything more about collective life or central guidance.  They refused to take part
 in criticisms and self-criticisms, astutely quoting the famous principles of Chou
 En-lai, "peaceful coexistence, mutual non-interference."  The situation became so
 serious that the kanpu in charge of organizations yielded, not daring to hold out
 against this demand for freedom.
 The reaction came.  The universities in Harbin. . . applied the method of in-
 doctrinations and meetings in all its rigour; with discussions on "Democracy and
 Centralism," axd "Freedom and Discipline." . . .
 The whole life of the students was changed.  Their days were filled with hard
 work - shovelling snow, etc., and daily gymnastics and other forms of collective
 l.fe.  Thus, kept busy from morning to night with study, gymnastics, meetings, and
 work, the students had no time left for dreams of Democracy and Freedom.
 Harbin was not the only centre of disaffection.  Numerous reports make it clear
 that the alienation of students from. Party life was universal.  Usually it is called
 "indifference towards politics".  Last February an editorial in the Teachers' Daily
 said "In 1"eking App rov ef or F 'e~eas~   A  C ~!$~ 16`~kobb` O kv0aa 0

 New York Times, Apiril 21, 1957, "Student Unrest 'Worries Peiping As Dissatisfac-
 tion Reports Rise," by Greg MacGregor
 Hongkong,April 20 - An increasing number of reports of civilian unrest trickled
 out of Communist China this week.  They dealt for the most part with student dissa-
 tisfaction, which has been building up since last fall.
 It was confirmed from several reliable sources here that the Peiping Government
 was gravely concerned over the problem of student unrest.
 Late last year students attending two institutions of higher learning sought
 to make their feelings known to the Government's leaders through mass demo strations
 similar to those held in Poland and Hungary, but were dissuaded by Government agents;
 it was reported.
 The two schools were named as the Chengting Technical School of Geology, situa-
 ted about 150 miles south of Peiping, and `I'singhua University, a neighboring
 institution.
 According to  reports, there is still tension on the campuses of the two schools
 and it. has spread to others.
 The reports indicated that the dissatisfaction was linked to the failure of
 Lraduates to Let jobs that were consistent with their educational backgrounds, and
 to independent thinking fostered by exchange student contac,s.   Also said to be
 a cause was the students' 1 dex~endent anal~Tsis of international news reports gath-
 ered surreptitiously from various outside publications and shortwave radio broad-
 casts.
 The difficulties with student circles are believed to have come as a shock to
 the Communist adr:Ainistration, whose long-range planning is built almost entirely
 upon technical and professional training of China's youth combined with thorough
 indoctrination in Communist ideology.
 Grave concern along similar lines was shown by the Communist leaders earlier
 this year when they acknowledged that an alarming number of students in institutions
 of higher learning were deviating from accented lines of thought.
 At that time, a report of a "conference on student work in higher institutions
 of Peiping" said to peeved    rl   ke8    c~~43  lPcTiB      eSLR~     4    ~   r

 Communist ideology),. while others failed to distinguish friend from enemy."
 The report made it plain that the teriils "friend" and "enemy" were used in
 allusion to sympathies in the students' ranks for the people of Hungary against
 the Soviet armed forces that crushed the uVrisin; there last fall.  The report
 added that students had become confused in distinguishing between "Social.ist
 democracy and bourgeois democracy," the western type and the type practiced in
 Communist countries.
 The reports of the narrowly averted demonstrations said that classes had been
 suspended at both institutions involved for a week and that all students had been
 compelled to attend new concentrated courses of  olitical :indoctri.nation.  The
 reports also indicated that ?ei;aing intended to quell. any demonstrations at all
 costs before they reached the stage of possible bl.ood.shed.
 Despite this, it was reported that .others reg^rded, by the Communists as both
 "dangerous and. imertirnt" had appeareck on the walls of the schools at regular
 intervals.
 As knowledge of the student unrest spread in areas near the two institutions,
 the Government said recently in partial explanation that about 82 per cent of the
 students in China's colleges Were from upper class families and consequently were
 still contaminated with "bourgeois" and "ixriperialist" ideas.
 Although independent thought has been emphasized over and over as one of the
 freedoms enjoyed under advanced Socialist leadership, it was reliably reported. that
 more severe restrictions on institutions, of higher learning were imminent.
 To control what it considers dangerus thinking by the students, Peiping will
 soon assign Communist party repro, sentative9 to individual schools to supervise
 instruction in current events ani policies, political theory and "ideological
 realities."  This plan was announced by the Peiping educational conference in
 February.

 institution, named Chueh Cheng, who was also an important Red cadre.           The bomb

 damage and brought great excitement to the neighborhood.  Later, the Communists

 liberty and democracy for all.  A lot of this literature was distributed amongst
 different universities and colleges of Tientsin, Shanghai as we1.7_ as Peking.  They
 often brought forth indictments against the Reds.
 More significant than the above is t l-- fact that even in the People's
 University, a Communist institution, there are students who are antagonistic to
 the Reds.  In accordance with a recent report in the People's_ Daily, two students
 of the Law Department, named Chen Hai-ko and Hung Yiu-chung, were very L gressive
 in their anti-Communist ca-mpai.gn.  They gathered more than 40 varieties of
 substantial materials to explain tI   necessity of thoroughly reforming the
 socialist system on the mainland of China at the present time.  It is s a,id that
 Hung Yiu--chunk=, was once a Red cadre, and he had 'been sent to the People's Univrersity
 by the government.  If even Communists undergo these ideological charfres the
 situation in Red China can easily be imagined.
 In the northwest part of Red Chia, the students of various colleges and.
 universities also appear t o be very restive
 rebellious.  The Communists say
 they are desirous of starting troubles wherever and whenever possible.  According
 to a report published in tho People's Daily of June 22, the students of Shensi
 Normal College in the southern suburbs of Si.n, the tTovi_=4al capital, put up
 numerous posters opposing the Communist rule and attacking the Red leadership.
 They criticized all cadres, too, branding them. as "r.i.nning dogs of the Soviet
 imperialism; but the leading members of the Chinese Corr nun: st Party received the
 severest assault from the students.  They also posted ten interpellations which
 the Reds could never answer.
 Not lon  ago, it was reported in the press that a number of students of
 Nanki nu University demonstrated against the Red administration.  The incident
 became so serious that the authorities had to call armed police to s,,-,        the
 unrest.  Though several youths were arrested and the situation was temporarily

 tiThen. criticism was called for by the Government, "they thought -their time was
 ripe and became more active in inciting teachers and students to riot and to
 attack party committees."

 came under instructions of the Chang-Lo alliance--the alleged alliance between
 the Ministers of Communications, Mr. Chang Po-chun and of the Timber Industry,
 Nr, Lo Lung-chi, to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party.

 Hongkong, Aug. 13 -- The Communist dictatorship in eight years of axle in
 China has failed to win the full support of the Chinese youth.
 Classroom revolts during the parb.:y's recent "rectification" campaign proved
 that the .youth, on whom the Red leaders always have counted for their strongest
 support, were not sold on Communism.
 Reports today from Communist publications reaching Hongkong indicate that the
 massive brainwashing so far has been a flop.
 Trouble started in May after the Communist Party's central committee a.. k d for
 criticism to rectify the party-'s errors in bureaucratism, secretarianism and
 subjectivism.
 Chinese students, who volunteered their help wit lout being asked, lambasted
 the entire structure of the Communist regime.
 A student of French at Nankin; University acidly commented: "In my opinion
 10 million out of the 12 million party n nbers should be killed during the present
 rectification. "
 A girl law student at the People's University in Peiping, in a speech to
 other students charged: "There is no genuine democracy in China."

 to "unmask" students, including Y. C. L. members, who  Z:Cead " ies" a a'_nst the

 Anti-Communist feelings among people in the party itself, and parti_cularlj,

 for greater efforts to fight such tendencies. . .
 . ? . it is known that recent literary and philosophical discussions have

 discuss new trends in Soviet literature students seized. the opportunity to    guest

 After taking over control of the meeting from the imiversity staff, the
 students called their :mUn representatives to the rostrum and r unc':1;~ a ula.~?_ded
 their sallies against some aspects of the Government's policy. The students
 stressed the need for more effective public control over Gover^-mrnt bodies and

 It is the spread of this attitude of skepticism amot    Soviet t,uth that has
 given rise to increasing Government concern.
 Only last Tuesday Prav    the official Co~rmunist paper, called for tighter
 arty discipline to end the spread af' non-Comrmunist ideas.    Pravda said only those
 "poisoned by political carelessness" could ignore the danger these tendencies
 present to the Soviet system.
 Awareness of these possibilities was believed to lie behind a series of recent
 steps designed to bring the situation under control.
 One of the first moves related to Hungarian students studying, at Moscow
 University and other leading Soviet educational centers.  So many disturbing ques-
 tion.s t^wTere originating  in this g oup that they were sent  back home, no masse,
 before the New Year's holidays.
 There were estimated to be more than 200 Hungarian students at Moscow Univer-
 sity.         They are said not to be expected back in Moscow, at least not this year.
 The removal of the Hungarian students was said to have been undertaken because
 of the disturbing effect they were having on Soviet students.  The Russi~~:ns,
 dissatisfied with official explanations of events in Eastern Europe, were tunai.n
 more and more to their Hungarian classmates for a realistic acc_oI nt.
 Students at Moscow 'University, it was said, continue to listen to sh-rt-wave
 news broadcasts, principally British Broadcasting Corporation programs in English.
 Many students are familiar vi-ith English from their studies.  The broadcasts are
 not jammed by Soviet authorities.
 University authorities have sought to discourage students from posting
 bulletins in classrooms, reporting a summary of B. B. C. news.  The practice con-
 tinues, however.  Voice of America broadcasts in Russian, travelers reported, are
 too heavily jammed to be heard in, big cities such as Moscow or Leningrad. . .
 University students also circulate news and. opinions in typewritten and
 mimeographed news letters.

 Mr. Khrushchev may exclaim that he is a Stalinis t, and proud of it, he may
 threaten, to ex2el rbel_liou.s stgdennts ai~.d~~lzt. them to w,-)rk i_n factories; but in
 fact the Stalin touch.. is entirely lacking.  The revolt continues, always sirm Bring,
 sometimes boiling utp, and all the Soviet government is doing for the time being
 is to try to keep it within bounds.  . .
 In the   ..st, the discrientationof Soviet youth (which existed also under
 Stalin) expressed itself among the majority in apathy, among a minority in
 extravagant gestures, in heave drinking, in a series of crazes--for flamboyant
 clothes. . . .
 There were always small groups of  students who entertained irioas  of  their
 on and formed the cells of a potential oppostion..  But, they were isolated ~.:nd
 until lately they dared not? apeak.
 That changed this was the de-Stalinization of a year a T._o.   Then K.hn ..shchev,
 by shattering the Stalin legend, not on
 gave the green  14 9,11A to th,,-)se who had
 already been thinking dangerous thcu-hts in secret, but also woke up countless
 thousands of Soviet young to a sudden realization that the real blame for the most
 ha ted features of Soviet life lay with the system itself
 individual bureaucrats and. bosses.
 They were told by Khrushchev, that the infallible teacher, whose wi.:rd. was
 never to be doubted, who pointed the only way to the li.. _ `t   was not only fallible
 but also a brute.  This was an invitation to the most inhensive g1,.esti :>r.inr   .nd
 self-questioning.  And the invitation was seized.  So that amon ,  the very 22
 of today the apathy and cy_ni_cism bred by the acceptance of a lie which was generally
 known to be a lie, has given way to a mood of constructive s1 et,ti_ci sm .  If Stalin
 can be debunked anything can happen.  Nothing is taken for granted by these
 youngsters. Ever%t'ning is being questioned. And every action of the present
 leadership is being examined in the light of Kha:u.shchev's revelations about Stalin.
 It is impossible to see where it will end.  Ta.t it is already clear that it
 cannot be stopped.  It nay be stifled; but it cannot be killed. . .

 ideolowy.  This is the decision reached by 3,000 social-science teachers and
 Communist party workers from all the bi  universities in European Russia who
 have just closed a conference here.
 In true Soviet fashion, they blame themselves for the errors of the youth,
 whose training is In their hands. . .  .

 Baltimore Simi, Nov. 24, 1957, "Soviet Operation of Schools Likened to Military
 Training," by Weldon Wallace
 Cambridge,, Mass., Nov. 23 -- The Soviet Union runs its educational system as
 other countries o j. r ate a military trainin ; pro g^m.  in time of war, according to
 Alexander G. Korol, whose book-Soviet Edu.cat:i_on for Science and Techno?..o,+ was
 published this week end.
 The Soviet Government s-?ecif _es the courses of training and limits the, quotas
 of students in each category to suit the specific needs of  =mcti_n:., Communist
 power; Mr. Kerol said today in discussing his find3xi gs.
 The best Russian facilities and resources are mobilized to supply the most
 crucial needs of Communist dictatorship, he added.
 The Government predetermines the size of freshman classes fc,r the country as
 a whole and for each school.  The planned enrollment must be met in every institu-
 tion.  If there are too many applicants, students :dll be turned down after the
 quota is filled.  if there are too few, additional anpl'_cants roust be found to
 make up the deficiency.
 Indirect evidence suggests that the student bocce  of colleges aid universities
 has become '" rogressivel y welted in favor of the chi:kP en of ?-arty ofi' ici.a_l_s,
 civil servants, military officers  and  other  rJ-o-1.7 s  occu.  yin   an  elite  pos tion in

 Quotas, of students are determined on one basis onl-y---the needs ofthe State.
