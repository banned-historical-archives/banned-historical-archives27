 EGYPT-USSR: ON THE ROCKS
 President Sadat's abrogation this week of the
 1971 Egyptian-Soviet friendship treaty indicates
 that he has virtually written off hope of putting his
 relations with Moscow on an even keel. There are
 also indications that he will soon terminate Soviet
 access to naval repair facilities at Alexandria. The
 Egyptian leader's advisers are publicly main-
 taining, however, that there is still room for con-
 tinued cooperation between the two countries.
 Sadat announced his desire to cancel the
 treaty during a speech on March 14, and the
 People's Assembly ratified the abrogation by an
 overwhelming 307-2 vote the following day. Sadat
 cited Soviet failure to supply Egypt with arms and
 spare parts as the prime reason for his move. He
 has been particularly angered by Moscow's re-
 cent refusal to continue overhauling MIG-21
 engines and its refusal to permit India either to
 overhaul the engines or to provide Egypt with
 spare parts for the aircraft. He is also con-
 vinced-although he did not mention this in the

 speech-that the Soviets are attempting to fo-
 ment unrest in Egypt in an effort to overturn his
 government.
 Until now, Sadat had refrained from tamper-
 ing with either the friendship treaty or the agree-
 ment that gives the Soviets access to naval
 facilities at Alexandria, probably in the belief that
 they gave him some leverage to press for a
 resumption of Soviet arms shipments. Sadat seems
 now to have given up any hope that more arms
 will ever be forthcoming. In recent months, he
 tried to make a tentative peace with the Soviets,
 even to the point of publicly affirming that he
 had stopped the propaganda war with them and
 of openly acknowledging the existence of some
 points of similarity in Soviet and Egyptian policy.
 Moscow's answer was to increase the pressure on
 the Egyptians by further restricting its arms flow.
 Sadat has long had a personal obsession
 about the Soviets, and he probably concluded
 that he had little to lose by abrogating the treaty.
 Any economic retaliation taken by Moscow
 would cause some disruption, but would do
 minimal real damage.
 At present, Egypt needs Soviet technicians to
 run the Hulwan steel mill, the Naj Hammadi
 aluminum plant, and the Alexandria shipyard, but
 this assistance could easily be replaced from the
 West. Egypt's principal trade with Moscow is in
 items that are difficult to market in the West; part
 of its export earnings from the USSR are used for
 debt repayment, but less than $150 million of the
 exports is bartered directly for Soviet goods.
 Financing for the purchase of substitute items
 from the West would have to be secured.
 Sadat will, of course, have to be alert to possi-
 ble unrest among the Egyptian military as a result
 of his virtual foreclosure of any hope for further
 Soviet arms. Some Arab commentators have taken
 a cynical attitude toward the treaty abrogation,
 viewing it as a move undertaken at US behest for
 little return, and there is some danger that Egypt's
 military establishment will take a similar view if
 further Western arms deals are not concluded.
 Sadat will be in considerable trouble if his military
 leaders come to the view expressed by one Jorda-
 nian newspaper that has blamed the Soviet-Egyp-
 tian impasse over arms solely on Sadat and ac-
 cused him of trading "thousands of tanks, planes,
 and rockets" for six US C-130 aircraft.
 The US embassy in Cairo has reported that
 large numbers of Egyptians are applauding Sadat's
 move as "long overdue." Foreign Minister Fahmi
 put the full weight of his support behind the trea-
 ty abrogation in a speech to the People's
 Assembly the day after Sadat's announcement. He
 cataloged a long list of grievances against Moscow
 as just grounds for the move and emphasized in
 particular the Soviets' constant carping at Egypt's
 alleged deviation from the "socialist path" and
 from the tenets of Nasir's "revolution."
 Fahmi emphasized, however, that continued
 cooperation is still possible and indicated that the
 Egyptians may now seek to avoid further damage
 to the relationship with Moscow. People's
 Assembly speaker Sayyid Mari, a close confidant
 of Sadat's, also stressed that the abrogation should
 not impede the growth of friendly relations. Both
 expressed the hope that trade relations will con-
 tinue, pointedly noting that it is through the Egyp-
 tian trade surplus that Cairo is currently paying off
 its debt to the Soviets.
 Israeli leaders have not commented on the
 Egyptian action, but Israeli press commentary has
 been extensive. An editorial in a daily with close
 ties to the ruling Labor Alignment mirrored the
 ambivalence that most Israelis probably share
 concerning the possible impact of Sadat's action
 on their country. On the one hand, the article
 welcomed Sadat's action as strengthening the US
 position in the Middle East at Soviet expense. On
 the other, it expressed concern that improved
 US-Egyptian relations might result in renewed
 US pressure on Israel for further territorial and
 political concessions to the Arabs in peace
 negotiations, as well as greater su port by
 Americans for US arms sales to Egypt

 move as another blow by the Egyptian leader to
 Arab unity.
 Sadat's abrogation of the treaty will
 nevertheless have important symbolic, and
 perhaps practical, consequences for Moscow. The
 Soviets place more stock in such treaties than
 their substance warrants; they regard a friendship
 pact as a tangible expression of the desire for, if
 not necessarily the fact of, a close and congenial
 relationship. Egypt's action will be interpreted not
 only as a declaration of current antipathy, but also
 as a bad omen for future bilateral relations. The
 Soviets will also be discomfited by the fact that it
 was Sadat, not they, who took the initiative, and
 the abrogation will revive memories of the ig-
 nominious expulsion of Soviet advisers from
 Egypt in 1972.
 Moscow's initial press reaction to Sadat's
 abrogation was confined to a short and straight-
 forward Tass statement issued on March 15; the
 statement appeared to be no more than a holding
 action until the Kremlin had determined how to
 respond.
 Tass put the blame on Sadat for the downturn
 in Soviet-Egyptian relations. It described the
 abrogation as a new manifestation of the "un-
 friendly" policy toward the USSR that Sadat had
 been pursuing for a long time.
 The Tass statement contained no threats, and
 included the platitude that Moscow will continue
 to work for friendly relations with Cairo and the
 Egyptian people.
 Subsequent Soviet press treatment of the
 abrogation has concentrated on replaying Arab
 criticism and Western satisfaction over Sadat's
 Foreign Minister Fahmi
 e A YY\ Q_,r*_    rJ2_ SS   LOY
 The Soviets may be withholding comprehen-
 sive comment until they see how far Sadat is going
 to push the deterioration in relations. If the
 Soviets are of a mind to avoid doing anything, at
 least publicly, to worsen the situation, they may
 have drawn some comfort from Foreign Minister
 Fahmi's mildly conciliatory remarks on future
 relations with the USSR when he was before the
 People's Assembly. Moreover, the Soviets
 evidently have not yet been told to end their
 naval repair activity in Alexandria.
 The Egyptian action will reinforce the view in
 Moscow that good Soviet-Egyptian relations are
 impossible as long as Sadat remains in power. The
 logical deduction would seem to be that the
 Soviets will do eveything in their power to bring
 Sadat down. This could cause Moscow to attack
 him openly and frontally, perhaps by ending
 economic relations and withdrawing its people
 from Egypt. But the Soviets may want to make a
 fresh and  redoubled effort to work covertly
 against Sadat, which might. necessitate keeping as
 many personnel as possible in the country. It may
 be that, in the end, the Soviets will try to hang on
 in Egypt, retain such influence over the situation
 there as they can, and hope that sooner, rather
 than later, the many problems of Egypt will prove
 fatal to Sadat.                                25X1

 ldwh~
 The Syrians took steps this week to wrest the
 initiative back from forces that supported the
 limited coup on March 11 by Brigadier Ahdab, the
 Muslim garrison commander in Beirut. Ahdab,
 proclaiming himself a "temporary military gover-
 nor" threatened to oust Christian President Fran-
 jiyah by force if he did not resign. After forceful
 new action by Damascus, however, Ahdab on
 March 17 publicly withdrew his threat and
 promised to await the outcome of Syrian-spon-
 sored negotiations.
 About a thousand Syrian regulars, disguised
 as Palestinian units, were sent into Lebanon last
 weekend to reinforce the Syrian-controlled Saiqa
 and PLA forces already there. These combined
 units moved quickly on March 15 to block an
 attempt by pro-coup forces, including elements
 of Lieutenant Khatib's renegade Muslim army, to
 storm the presidential palace at Babda. Franjiyah
 has holed up there, defying Ahdab's demand.
 Damascus was initially inclined to support
 Ahdab's power play because Franjiyah has been
 obstructing Syrian efforts to halt the disintegra-
 tion of the Lebanese army and to organize a
 broad-based cabinet to implement the Lebanese
 political accord Damascus arranged last month.
 The Syrians later concluded, however, that the
 forces backing the relatively obscure Ahdab-lef-
 tist leader Kamal jumblatt and Palestine Libera-
 tion Organization chairman Yasir Arafat-were
 working to reduce Syrian influence rather than
 support mediation efforts.
 Damascus remains primarily interested in
 restoring order and political stability in Lebanon
 and ensuring the support of the main Muslim and
 Christian groups for Syrian mediation. The Syrians
 also want to move the Lebanese politicians
 toward rapid implementation of the reform
 package they agreed to in mid-February.
 By midweek the focus of attention had
 shifted abruptly to Damascus where consultations
 were going on to devise a way for Franjiyah to
 step down gracefully and a successor to be
 selected. Various Lebanese and Palestinian
 leaders-including Arafat, a  Phalangist delega-
 tion, and Khatib-had responded to calls from
 Damascus to meet with President Asad. Only
 Jumblatt refused.
 One solytion being given serious considera-
 tion by the Syrians would have Franjiyah name a
 prominent Maronite Christian to head a caretaker
 government, thus paving the way for his resigna-
 tion and the election of a new president. This for-
 mula was used in 1952 to resolve a similar con-
 stitutional crisis.
 Ilyas Sarkis, the governor of the central bank,
 is apparently the front runner to replace Fran-
 jiyah. He reportedly has the support of Damascus,
 the Christian Phalanges Party and the Lebanese
 army high command. His candidacy, however, is
 likely to be strongly opposed by Jumblatt and
 some other Muslim and leftist leaders who sup-
 ported Ahdab's move. More Syrian arm-twisting
 is likely to be necessary to bring Jumblatt and his
 followers around.
 The Israelis reacted cautiously to reports of
 Syrian regulars intervening in Lebanon. Israeli
 military spokesmen maintained that they could
 neither confirm nor deny the presence of Syrian
 regulars, but professed to believe that these
 reports refer to Syrian-controlled Palestinian
 forces.
 Unless Damascus injects substantially more
 Syrian regular forces into Lebanon-which seems
 unlikely-the Israelis probably will remain con-,
 tent to issue warnings against outside interven-
 tion, while tacitly accepting the fact that some
 regulars are alre, iy there.
 The Israelis appear to recognize that ad-
 ditional Syrian pressure was necessary to stablize
 the situation. Their primary concern remains the
 security situation in southern Lebanon. Defense
 Minister Peres warned last week that although
 Israel will remain a   "passive observer" of

 SAUDI ARABIA - SOUTH YEMEN
 Normalizing Relations
 Saudi Arabia and South Yemen announced
 last week their intention to normalize relations.
 The move was the result of more than 18 months
 of negotiations in which the Egyptians acted as
 go-between. The two countries have been at odds
 since South Yemen became independent in 1967
 under the leftist National Front.
 In a communique issued on March 10, the
 two countries renounced interference in each
 other's internal affairs and held out the promise
 of cooperation in cultural and economic matters.
 The communique also called for an end to
 "foreign interference" on the Arabian Penin-
 sula-a reference broad enough to encompass
 the Saudis' objection to the extensive Soviet
 presence in South Yemen and Aden's opposition
 to Iran's military role in Oman. Normalization ap-
 parently will occur in stages and take three
 months to complete-if everything goes well.
 The Saudis, for their part, are apparently
 prepared to begin fairly soon to extend
 large-scale financial assistance to Aden. Riyadh
 evidently hopes that it can create a relationship of
 financial dependency; this would then be used as
 a lever to gain political concessions-the Saudis'
 main aim being the reduction of the Soviet role in
 South Yemen.
 Hard-line Marxists, however, are in impor-
 tant positions throughout the party, government,
 and military apparatus in South Yemen. The
 willingness of the National Front to negotiate the
 agreement was probably due largely to economic
 considerations. The National Front may have
 reasoned that it had little to lose and money to
 gain by making the deal.
 The governments of Oman and North
 Yemen, like some Saudi leaders, are skeptical
 about Riyadh's chances of bringing about any
 significant modification of South Yemeni policies,
 but they have publicly welcomed the reconcilia-
 tion. Sultan Qabus of Oman has responded by
 also announcing a 60-day amnesty during which
 Dhofari rebels in South Yemen may return
 without penalty to Oman.
 Aden, eager to find other sources of aid, will
 probably move in the near term to establish
 diplomatic relations with the small Arab states of
 the lower Persian Gulf. Until now, Bahrain, Qatar,
 and the United Arab Emirates have been slow to
 respond to overtures from South Yemen, arguing
 that they did not want to anger Riyadh by getting

 NIGERIA: SETTLING ACCOUNTS.
 Nigeria's military rulers no doubt hope the
 execution last week of 31 military officers and
 non-commissioned officers for their alleged roles
 in the recent abortive coup will wrap up the
 affair and allow the regime to ease its preoccu-
 pation with security. The events of the past
 month, however, have surfaced problems that are
 unlikely to dissipate quickly.
 The special military panel that investigated
 the abortive coup has asserted it grew out of plot-
 ting by two separate groups that were put in
 touch with each other by former chief of state
 Gowon, who has been in the UK since his ouster
 last July. Speaking for the ruling Supreme Military
 Council, Brigadier Shehu Yar Adua, now the
 number two man in the regime, announced that
 the plotters were angered by the recent
 promotions of top officers and entertained wild
 notions that Nigeria was "going communist." He
 said they wanted to restore Gowon to power and
 rehabilitate a number of discredited former state
 governors, and hoped to thwart any demobiliza-
 tion of Nigeria's 250,000-man army. Yar Adua
 went to great lengths to dispel fears of any rapid
 or indiscriminate demobilization, indicating that
 the council views this as a particularly explo-
 sive issue.
 The public executions were clearly designed
 to warn other plotters, but also seem aimed at
 placating the Muslim Hausa peoples of the north
 who had seen another of their prominent
 sons-the late chief of state Murtala
 Muhammed-killed by officers from other ethnic
 groups. The bloody riots in northern Nigeria that
 followed the killing of Hausa leaders by southern
 Christian Ibos in 1966 doubtless are still fresh in
 the minds of those who now run the country.
 Despite the surface appearance of decisive
 action by a unified leadership, the secrecy of the
 investigations and trials and the hasty executions
 suggest a degree of insecurity. The impression is
 reinforced by the council's near frantic effort im-
 mediately following the coup attempt to squelch
 any mention of ethnic or religious fears, and by its
 willingness to allow the press and students to raise
 the foreign scapegoat with allegations of UK and
 US involvement in the plot.
 The ethnic factor may well be the main con-
 cern in Lagos. The alleged coup leaders were all
 officers from the small Christian and pagan tribes
 of central Nigeria that provide about a third of the
 army's personnel. Dissatisfaction among these of-
 ficers apparently had been building in the weeks
 prior to the coup. Some of them had come to
 believe that Muhammed was deliberately
 weakening the position of political pre-eminence
 these tribes had enjoyed during the nine years
 General Gowon was the country's leader. One
 prominent  minority  officer,  Major  General
 Bisalla-who was executed as one of the
 ringleaders of last month's coup plot--had com-
 plained bitterly about being cut off from
 deliberations of the Supreme Military Council.
 Mutual suspicions among Nigerian military
 officers undoubtedly have grown as a result of the
 coup and executions. The brigade of guards, the
 primary military security force in Lagos, which is
 composed mainly of soldiers from minority tribes,
 has been sent out of Lagos on maneuvers; many
 of its personnel reportedly will be reassigned to
 other units. The brigade's security duties in the
 capital reportedly have been assigned to army un-
 its from other parts of Nigeria, including two from
 the north that are predominantly Hausa.
 Within the military council, officers from the
 small tribes are said to be lying low until the feel-
 ing against them dies down. Hausa members of
 the council, on the other hand, reportedly are
 asserting themselves, especially Brigadier Yar
 Adua. Lieutenant General Obasanjo, who
 accepted the top job reluctantly, has maintained a
 relatively low profile since he took over. Obasan-
 jo, a Christian Yoruba from western Nigeria, is
 regarded by some officers from central Nigeria as
 easily manipulated by the Hausas.
 Meanwhile, the Nigerian press has eased up
 somewhat on its anti-Western rhetoric, although
 this may change if the government pushes for the
 extradition of Gowon from the UK. Nigerian
 spokesmen say they are seeking Gowon's return,
 but Lagos has not filed a formal request with Lon-
 don. The British seem certain to reject any such
 request.

 FRENCH TERRITORY OF AFARS AND ISSAS
 independence Timetable
 French President Giscard appears to have
 decided to speed up the timetable for granting in-
 dependence to the French Territory of the Afars
 and Issas. He also seems prepared to relinquish
 French base rights there -rather: than become in-
 volved in a potential military conflict.
 The French gave no timetable last December
 when they announced their decision to grant in-
 dependence to the territory, but French officials
 then implied that the process could take up to
 two years.
 According to several French diplomats
 stationed in east Africa, Paris now plans:
 ? To make clear to local leaders that
 permission for French forces and facilities to
 remain is not a precondition for in-
 dependence.
 ? To call a meeting of the two local
 political parties and rival liberation
 movements, one backed by Ethiopia and the
 other by Somalia, to plan for independence.
 ? To hold a referendum, possibly
 supervised by observers from the UN, the
 Organization of African Unity and the Arab
 League, as soon as this June to elect a new
 government.
 A personal representative of Giscard will visit
 Somalia, Ethiopia and, apparently, some Arab
 capitals in the next few weeks to discuss the com-
 position of a local government and problems
 relating to the territory's security after in-
 dependence.
 Paris' policy shift began taking shape several
 weeks ago. France had hoped to transfer power to
 a government led by Ali Aref Bourhan, the
 pro-French leader of the territorial council. As
 Aref's political weakness became increasingly evi-
 dent, however, France strengthened its contacts
 with the only legal opposition group in
 Djibouti-the African People's Independence
 League-and began pressing Aref to reach an ac-
 commodation with it.
 France has apparently drawn further away
 from Aref by suggesting a willingness to withdraw
 all troops after independence. Aref is still calling
 for a French military presence, which he believes
 is essential if the territory is to maintain its in-
 dependence.
 Somali and Ethiopian Positions
 Neighboring Somalia is determined to pursue
 its long-standing aim of annexing the territory.
 Ethiopia is equally determined to prevent the
 Somalis from dominating the territory and its port
 of Djibouti, the terminus of Ethiopia's only impor-
 tant rail link to the sea.
 Paris obviously hopes that talks among the
 four local political groups will produce an agree-
 ment that will last at least long enough to allow a
 peaceful transition to independence.
 President Siad of Somalia has reacted
 favorably to the French initiative because he
 believes the withdrawal of French troops would
 enhance Somalia's ability to gain control of the
 territory.
 Ethiopia, on the other hand, will consider the
 French plans as favorable to Somalia, and will
 almost certainly begin giving serious con-
 siderations to means of forestalling a Somali
 take-over in Djibouti.
 Djibouti is France's only major naval base
 remaining in the Indian Ocean. Its strategic loca-
 tion near the entrance to the Red Sea enables the
 French to protect key oil supply routes to the
 West and monitor Soviet naval activity in the Gulf
 of Aden. Operating out of Djibouti, the French
 Indian Ocean flotilla is the largest Western naval
 force in the ocean and is nearly the same size as
 the Soviet contingent.
 If the French are forced to relinquish the
 base, they almost certainly will have to increase
 the number of supply and support craft assigned
 to the area-at least for the near term. They also
 will be forced to rely more heavily on their
 limited support facilities at La Reunion, an island
 east of Madagascar.

 LIBYA-EGYPT. AT IT AGAIN
 The feud between the Sadat and Qadhafi
 regimes, relatively quiet in recent months, has
 flared again, bringing this time a threat to the
 many Egyptian workers in Libya. Cairo's concern
 for the safety of its citizens may provide it with
 new incentive to try to overthrow the
 troublesome Libyan government.
 The latest contretemps began two weeks ago
 over unsuccessful attempts by some of Qadhafi's
 agents against two Libyan Revolutionary Com-
 mand Council members who have been living in
 exile in Cairo. On March 6, three Libyan agents
 boarded a plane in Cairo that they believed was
 carrying one of the council members, Abd
 al-Munim al-Huni, to Rome, intending to hijack it
 to Libya and kidnap al-Huni. Al-Huni, who has
 been living in Egypt since August, had switched
 planes, however, after being advised to do so by
 Egyptian authorities as a precautionary measure.
 When the three Libyans arrived in Rome they
 were arrested for carrying arms and grenades.
 Almost  simultaneously,  the  Egyptians
 arrested seven Libyan commandos allegedly sent
 to Cairo to assassinate Umar Muhayshi, another
 exiled command council member. Muhayshi fled
 Libya in August after failing in an attempt to
 overthrow Qadhafi. Twenty more Libyans, all
 allegedly involved in the effort to assassinate
 Muhayshi, were rounded up during the following
 week.
 The defection of the two members of his rul-
 ing clique is a continuing embarrassment for
 Qadhafi, and he was apparently ready to go to
 great lengths to silence Muhayshi and force
 al-Huni to return. The move against Muhayshi
 was probably prompted by Cairo's threat several
 weeks ago to publish what were billed as lurid
 memoirs  of Muhayshi's experiences under
 Qadhafi. Al-Huni is not so anathema to Qadhafi
 -in fact, he is still officially Libya's foreign
 minister-and Qadhafi evidently wanted only to
 get him to return to the fold, even if under duress.
 Efforts to cajole him into returning in January had
 been to no avail.
 Qadhafi     CRS
 Although the issue is essentially an internal
 Libyan one, the Libyans have infringed on Egyp-
 tian sovereignty in pursuing errant members of
 their flock, and the Egyptians have used this, with
 no small measure of glee, as an excuse to pullout
 all stops in a new anti-Qadhafi propaganda
 barrage. Among other commentary in the press,
 Cairo began a week ago publishing the Muhayshi
 "memoirs." Although they hardly constitute the
 lurid fare that had been promised, they provide
 an interesting and somewhat embarrassing ac-
 count of Qadhafi's idiosyncracies.
 Libya has retaliated by expelling over 12,000
 Egyptian workers who the Libyans claim, probably
 with some justification, include illegal residents
 and some "spies." Were it not for the fact that
 some of those expelled have apparently been
 mistreated in the process and that the welfare of
 the almost 200,000 Egyptians remaining in Libya is
 threatened, Cairo might be willing to let the feud
 subside again. The danger to the remaining Egyp-
 tians, however, will cause Cairo considerable con-
 cern. Qadhafi can hold them hostage to Egypt's
 good behavior, but the threat to their safety could
 increase Sadat's inclination to find a wa to get rid
 of Qadhafi

 USSR: READING THE RETURNS
 Moscow is rapidly moving away from its
 cautious, low-key coverage of the US presidential
 election campaign to relatively extensive, partisan
 commentary. The Soviets, who continued to pull
 their punches until emboldened by the results of
 the early primaries, were evidently prompted to
 join the fray by the growing debate in the US over
 relations with the USSR.
 The Soviet media assure their audience that
 the policy of "detente" enjoys the overwhelming
 support of the US public. At the same time,
 however, Moscow warns of intensified attacks on
 that policy. In the Soviet view, popular will in the
 US runs a constant risk of being submerged by
 those "certain circles" (e.g., military industrialists,
 Zionists, monopolists) whose interests are served
 by anti-Soviet policies.
 In the aftermath of the Florida vote, Moscow
 began to inform the Soviet people in some detail
 of the course of the US campaign. In particular,
 Moscow reported the consensus of "US
 observers" that after Florida President Ford was
 almost certain to win the Republican nomination.
 Governor Reagan's defeats were attributed in
 large measure to his opposition to the ad-
 ministration's policy toward the USSR.
 Moscow found the Florida Democratic
 primary equally heartening. The media have
 pointed out that in that state, a "bulwark of con-
 servatism," no candidate holding "extreme right"
 views won. In contrast to their total silence on
 Senator Jackson's first-place finish  in
 Massachusetts, the Soviets noted his and Gover-
 nor Wallace's "defeat" in Florida.
 Senator Jackson, nevertheless, remains a
 serious concern to Moscow. On March 11, the
 military organ Red Star published a long and un-
 usually vituperative attack on him. Governor
 Carter has also begun to draw criticism from
 Moscow, although not of the same order as that
 directed at Jackson, Reagan, and Wallace. Little
 has been said of the other Democratic candidates.
 Moscow has in the past normally preferred
 continuity in Western capitals to the uncertainties
 associated with a change of leadership. For this
 reason, it probably prefers to see President Ford
 returned to office.
 The Ford administration has nevertheless
 been subject to considerable criticism; much of it
 sharp and explicit. Secretary Rumsfeld, for exam-
 ple, has been taken to task recently for his "cold
 war views." The Soviets are also suspicious of the
 implications of the administration's dropping of
 the term "detente," although publicly they
 profess indifference. In a Pravda commentary this
 week Moscow observed that the strengthening of
 peace is too serious a matter to be subordinated
 to "any tactical considerations in the sphere of
 domestic activity."
 PORTUGAL: ELECTIONEERING UNDER WAY
 The campaign for legislative elections is
 swinging into full gear with election day still five
 weeks away. Fourteen parties have entered can-
 didates in the race on April 25, but the bulk of the
 vote will go to just four parties-the Socialists, the
 centrist Popular Democrats, the conservative
 Social Democratic Center, and the Communists.
 The shift to the right since last November is
 expected to work to the advantage of the Popular
 Democrats and the Social Democratic Center,
 which polled 26 and 8 percent respectively in last
 year's constituent assembly election. The
 Socialists, who last April won with 38 percent of
 the vote, are expected to lose some of their sup-
 port to the more conservative parties since they
 are no longer viewed as the only effective
 safeguard against a Communist take-over.
 The biggest battle of the campaign appears to
 be shaping up between the Socialists and the
 Popular Democrats for first place and the possible
 selection of the winning party leader as the next
 prime minister. Socialist leaders are discounting
 the possibility of post-election cooperation with
 the Popular Democrats-or with any other par-
 ty-in an effort to establish themselves as the

 alternative to a coalition of the two leading con-
 servative parties. The Socialists also want to dispel
 any fears that they would invite the Communists
 to participate in the government.
 The Popular Democrats, who expect to widen
 their margin of support with ex-Socialist sup-
 porters on the left and conservative Angolan
 refugees and northern farmers on the right, have
 left open the coalition question until after the
 elections. They believe the Socialist pledge to
 "govern alone or not at all" is probably no more
 than campaign rhetoric and realize that Socialist
 participation may be necessary for an effective
 government. A coalition of conservative parties
 only would have no effective line of communica-
 tion to labor, thus opening it to anearly challenge
 from that sector.
 The growing rivalry between the two parties,
 however, promises to make future cooperation
 more difficult. The Socialists were first off the
 mark when party leader Soares hosted a
 star-studded meeting of West European socialist
 and social democratic leaders last weekend in the
 northern  town  of  Porto.  The  par-
 ticipants-including Brandt from West Germany,
 Mitterrand from France, Kreisky from Austria,
 Palme from Sweden, and party leaders from five
 other countries-promised to work for more
 economic aid from the EC and the European Free
 Trade Association, as well as increased bilateral
 governmentand party assistance.
 The show of West European support gave the
 Socialist campaign a boost in the north, but in-
 furiated  the  Popular  Democrats.  Popular
 Democratic leader Sa Carneiro, who has failed to
 attract support from abroad for his party, tried to
 diminish the impact of the conference by charg-
 ing foreign interference in a domestic political
 campaign and by holding a rally to coincide with
 the first day of the Socialist meeting. Popular
 Democratic pressure succeeded in convincing
 Prime Minister Azevedo to cancel plans to attend
 the Socialist gathering, but Sa Carneiro's obstruc-
 tionist tactics may have tarnished his image with
 undecided voters.
 The Communists also criticized the Socialists
 for inviting the European leaders as an election
 ploy, but chose their words carefully to avoid an-
 tagonizing the Socialists, whom they still hope to
 coax into an alliance. The Communists realize
 they will not do well in the balloting and are try-
 ing to preserve a role in Portuguese politics either
 through association with the Socialists or by main-
 taining some capacity for creating civil unrest.

 FRANCE: SOCIALISTS GAIN
 Sharp gains posted by the Socialists in the
 two-round French cantonal elections that con-
 cluded Sunday have caused both the governing
 coalition and the Communists of the opposition
 left alliance to reassess their political strategies.
 The left won at least 907 departmental coun-
 cil seats to about 870 for President Giscard's ma-
 jority coalition, with the Socialist Party collecting
 498, more than twice the number of any other
 party. Although the balloting affected only about
 half the electorate, the left appears likely to in-
 crease the number of departmental advisory
 councils it controls from 30 to over 40 of the 95
 total.
 The left appears to have benefited from
 growing public discontent over France's con-
 tinuing high rates of inflation and unemployment,
 from the fact that this was the first election in
 which 18 year-olds were eligible to vote, and from
 a record 68-percent voter turnout.
 Socialist Party leader Francois Mitterrand,
 who campaigned hard, hails the election results as
 a sign of "great progress for the left." Communist
 Party leader Marchais sees the vote as a "serious
 warning shot for the government,". but is con-
 cerned over the continuing reluctance of Socialist
 voters to back Communist candidates in run-offs
 against centrist or conservative parties. The party's
 efforts to develop an image of greater respon-
 sibility and cooperation were not successful in in-
 creasing the votes it received.
 Government leaders, on the other hand, are
 saying publicly that the results are only a "light
 warning," as Justice Minister Lecanuet put it, and
 continue to emphasize the local nature of the
 contests. They point out that the opposition has
 traditionally done well in cantonal elections and
 that these contests have been notoriously poor
 signs of voter sentiment in legislative elections.
 Both observations are true to some extent,
 but the Giscard government is taking the results
 more seriously than it is indicating in public. The
 government admits that its strategy of playing
 down the significance of the elections and of
 keeping government leaders out of the campaign
 was a mistake.
 The cantonal results are likely to spark in-
 creased debate within the governing coalition.
 Giscard's Independent Republicans made sub-
 stantial gains at the expense of the Gaullists, and
 this is likely to engender increased defensiveness
 and suspicion of Giscard's political maneuvering
 among the Gaullists. The government will also be
 concerned by the clear swing of Gaullist voters to
 the Socialists in many areas.
 Within the victorious left alliance, the Com-
 munists have already shown concern over
 Socialist gains-many of them at the expense of
 the Communists-and are likely to step up efforts

 UK: SEARCH FOR A SUCCESSOR,
 The sudden resignation of Prime Minister
 Wilson on March 16 triggered intense political
 maneuvering in the Labor Party over the selection
 of a successor.
 Wilson's resignation came without warning,
 although he reportedly advised the Queen last
 December that he intended to step down at this
 time. Wilson's professed reasons were his long
 service in Parliament and as prime minister and
 his desire to give others a chance to seek the
 Labor leadership. He also cited his belief that his
 anti-inflation program is off to an impressive start.
 There is no evidence that ill-health or other
 personal problems played a role. Wilson intends
 to remain in Parliament as an ordinary Labor
 backbencher.
 The opposition Conservatives responded by
 calling for an immediate election, but Labor is not
 required to do so as long as it maintains its majori-
 ty in Commons. The new Labor leader will be
 tested almost immediately, however, by a
 parliamentary vote of confidence. Members of
 the leftist Tribune Group, whose defection last
 week led to an embarrassing parliamentary defeat
 for Wilson, have been warned by powerful trade
 union leaders not to endanger "the gains secured
 for workers by the present government." The un-
 ion leaders also called for an end to the divisive
 personal invective that has characterized recent
 intra-party debate.
 Labor's search for a successor will focus on
 finding a new leader acceptable to all elements of
 the party and may require two or three weeks.
 Nominations are being made this week and
 results of the first ballot will become available on
 March 25. Wilson will remain Prime Minister dur-
 ing this process.
 The initial favorite is James Callaghan,
 Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and long
 considered to be the number-two man in the par-
 ty. In his political views, Callaghan is identified
 with the broad center of the party; he has a strong
 pro-American outlook. Like Wilson, Callaghan
 has a talent for forging the political compromises
 Denis Healey        aim
 that are so necessary to keep the fractious Labor
 Party united. He also has the backing of several
 powerful union leaders.
 Callaghan's major drawback is his age-he
 will be 64 next week-but this is not necessarily a
 fatal flaw. Indeed, Wilson may have been trying to
 give Callaghan a subtle boost when in the course
 of his resignation statement, he pointed out some
 of his most distinguished predecessors as prime
 minister were over sixty upon coming to office.
 Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey
 will also be a front runner. His post has been a
 traditional springboard to the top and his
 economic policies have strong backing from most
 Labor members of Parliament and the trade union
 leadership. A significant obstacle to Healey's am-
 bitions, however, is his unpopularity with leftist
 MPs. This would not be a handicap if Labor had a
 healthy parliamentary majority, but given the par-
 ty's present one-vote margin in that body, the
 objections of left-wing Laborites could ruin
 Healey's chances.
 Whoever succeeds Wilson will probably feel
 compelled to seek an endorsement of his
 leadership by calling a national election before
 the end of the year. It may occur in early fall to
 precede the usually disruptive annual party con-
 ference. Labor's election prospects would appear
 to be relatively good as the British economy
 seems to be emerging from its deep recession.
 Although unemployment will remain at excep-
 tionally high levels, Labor would still benefit from

 the sharp decline in the rate of inflation as well as
 a public perception that better times are in store.
 These potential gains, however, could be wiped

 that would prevent a Labor majority at West-

 CANADA: DRILLING ACTIVITY RISES
 Petroleum exploration in Canada is showing
 some signs of recovery following a nearly
 two-year decline brought on in large measure by
 adverse federal tax and pricing policies. The
 revival is based almost entirely on gas drilling in
 western Canada. Activity on the western Cana-
 dian oil front is still under a cloud, and Arctic ex-
 ploration this year will remain nearly 40 percent
 below the 1973 level. East coast offshore activity is
 also languishing, largely because of disappointing
 results to date.
 A more broadly based revival in exploration
 will depend on policy decisions in the next few
 months. In the case of western oil, much depends
 on how domestic pricing and tax policies evolve
 from federal-provincial meetings currently under
 way. Activity in the promising Arctic regions will
 probably remain stagnant, until Ottawa firms up
 long-delayed land, tax, and royalty regulations.
 Final decisions on these matters will not be made
 until well into the year. With the vigor of the ex-
 ploration movement still to be tested, Ottawa
 shows no inclination to alter near-term energy ex-
 port policies.
 The nearly two-year decline in Canadian
 drilling continued throughout most of 1975.
 Despite an upturn toward the end of the year, the
 total number of wells drilled was only 15 percent
 above the previous year and 8 percent below the
 1973 level. Total drilling activity is expected to
 recover to about the 1973 level this year. So far
 this year, gas well completions are running 50 per-
 cent above the same period a year ago, but oil
 well completions are down, running about 17
 percent below a year ago.
 About 225 drilling rigs are currently operating
 in Canada, compared with about 170 a year ago,
 when exploration activity was at rock bottom.
 During the 1973 and 1974 winter drilling season
 about 250 to 260 rigs were in operation. Some two
 dozen rigs are still inactive; half of this equipment
 is located in the Arctic where rig utilization is run-
 ning at only 50 percent of capacity. So far the up-
 turn in drilling has not been strong enough to at-
 tract the return of more than a few of the rigs that
 left Canada in 1974 and 1975.
 In western Canada gas wells have accounted
 for 82 percent of well completions so far this year,
 compared with the normal 72 percent. Most of
 the exploration has been in Alberta, where atten-
 tion is being focused on shallow gas deposits in
 the eastern part of the province. Most of these
 deposits were delineated several years ago, but
 were not profitable to exploit at the time. The
 only relatively new area being explored is the
 Rocky Mountain  foothills region in western
 Alberta.
 Recent increases in gas prices have made
 these fields profitable to drill. Wellhead gas prices
 currently run 72 cents per thousand cubic feet,
 nearly double the 1973 level. Although tax and
 royalty payments take a large bite out of
 producer's revenues, returns have improved
 enough to spur drilling. Moreover, because ac-
 tivity is concentrated in fairly well-established
 areas, firms are running relatively few risks of dry
 holes.
 Drilling for oil in western Canada appears less
 active. Limited data suggest that the net return to
 oil producers has not improved nearly as much as
 it has for gas. Oil prices have risen sharply, but the
 cash flow for an oil producer in Alberta now
 amounts to $2.60 a barrel, only a nudge up from
 the roughly $2.00 per barrel average return in
 1973. Inflation has wiped out most or all of the in-
 crease.
 Although the Trudeau government an-

 drilling in the Beaufort Sea. The $120-million
 Dome Petroleum program centers on drilling two
 deepwater wells beginning next summer. The
 Dome program has been in the planning stage
 since 1973. The major firms operating in the
 Mackenzie Delta-Imperial Oil (Exxon), Shell
 Canada, and Gulf Canada-have indicated that
 they plan to scale down their drilling activity until
 land regulations are decided on.
 Panarctic Oils-the major firm operating in
 the Arctic Islands region-is cutting back explora-
 tion outlays this year to $35 million compared
 with $55 million in 1975. The firm's 1976 drilling
 program will concentrate on adding to 13 trillion
 cubic feet of already proven gas reserves and es-
 tablishing the extent of a recent promising oil
 strike on Cameron Island.
 Industry interest in the offshore east coast
 area has waned since 1973 because of soaring
 costs of offshore operations and the lack of major
 oil and gas finds. A continuing dispute between
 Ottawa and the Maritime provinces over sharing
 petroleum revenues has also dampened company
 interest. The provinces have repeatedly rejected
 federal offers to split future oil and gas revenues
 on a 50-50 basis.
 Only a handful of wells will be drilled off the
 Labrador coast this year. Eastcan Exploration plans
 to deploy two, and perhaps three, drilling vessels
 in hopes of completing five to seven wells. Activi-
 ty is limited to the summer months because
 weather conditions off the Labrador coast
 deteriorate rapidly by September. Shell Canada,
 which has accounted for about a third of the 125
 wells drilled off the east coast in the past few
 years, is planning a small effort in 1976.
 The increase in gas exploration, if sustained,
 should improve the supply situation somewhat
 over the next year or so. This, together with a
 slowdown in domestic gas consumption, would
 improve chances that the National Energy Board
 will back off from its earlier view that supply cut-
 backs to the US market should begin as soon as
 1977. Over the longer term, however, supplies of
 Canadian gas to the US market will depend
 primarily on Arctic production.
 The near-term oil supply outlook remains
 gloomy. Even if the gas exploration revival carries
 over to oil, a far more vigorous program will be
 needed to reverse the steady decline in Canada's
 proven reserves that has occurred since 1969.
 Without a sharp reversal of its proven reserve
 situation, there is no chance that Canada will
 modify its schedule for phasing out oil exports to
 ARGENTINA
 Facing the Opposition
 c
 The administration mounted another cam-
 paign this week to deflect criticism and discredit
 its opponents by attacking chief Peronist dissident
 Vittorio Calabro, unionist and governor of
 Buenos Aires Province. Calabro has been accused
 of seeking to undermine the latest economic
 stabilization program and of plotting against the
 government.
 Peronist party Secretary General Rocca made
 the strongest claims, calling Calabro a plotter who
 seeks to bring down the government by
 orchestrating labor opposition to the new
 economic austerity program. Interior Minister
 Ares, who only recently sought to arrange a
 reconciliation with Calabro, told the press he now
 feels that his efforts to bring the governor back
 into the Peronist fold have failed. He hinted that a
 more drastic solution might be needed.
 Both Ares and the presidential press secretary
 have subsequently denied any intention to
 remove Calabro from office, an action the ad-
 ministration has taken in a number of other
 provinces. The denials ring hollow, however, in
 the current situation. The complete eclipse of
 Calabro is the chief goal of labor confederation
 head Lorenzo Miguel, who is once again backing
 President Peron.

 Calabro is clearly working to torpedo the
 austerity program. He has already denounced it in
 public, saying it unfairly penalized workers.
 Calabro undoubtedly sees an opportunity to
 renew his drive to unseat the current national
 labor leadership, closely identified with the ad-
 ministration. This has been his goal for some time.
 It is questionable whether the government
 would risk an attempt to remove the powerful
 Calabro from the governorship; he clearly has
 significant worker support or at least sympathy
 and may have some backing among military of-
 ficers anxious to facilitate the splintering of
 Peronism. This realization by the administration,
 as well as the recurrent shifting of political
 alliances, suggests that yet another effort to make
 peace with Calabro will be undertaken at some
 point.
 The loyalists' fight with Calabro is the most
 dramatic of the continuing splits within Peronism
 that are leading to the disintegration of the move-
 ment. President Peron, although easily re-elected
 as head of the movement at a recent party con-
 gress, now leads an organization radically reduc-
 ed in size. The US embassy estimates that the
 Peronist movement is about one third the size it
 was less than two years ago when its founder was
 still alive.
 The prospect of Peronism's disintegration
 may be an important factor staving off a military
 coup. Many officers have consistently claimed
 that they would move only when Peronism had
 thoroughly discredited itself and been repudiated
 by the public.
 Debt Financing
 Argentina may soon be forced to ask for
 renegotiation of part of its foreign debt payments
 for 1976. Such a move would further erode its
 already weak international credit standing.
 Despite rumors that Buenos Aires will request a
 moratorium on debt payments, we do not think it
 will go that far because of the greater harm it
 would do its standing abroad.
 About $2.5 billion in debt amortization is due
 this year, and foreign exchange resources are
 meager in comparison. Foreign reserves stood at
 only $620 million on December 31,1975, almost all
 of it in gold and bilateral clearings, neither of
 which is available for general foreign settlements.
 The current account, swollen by interest
 payments, is expected to be in deficit by $400
 million.
 Nearly four fifths of the debt payments, in-
 cluding private obligations that make up more
 than half the total can doubtless be deferred as
 the were last year
 Debt service poses an immediate problem
 because large payments are due in March and
 April, before the major portion of receipts from
 grain sales from the 1975-76 harvest comes in. The
 strict austerity program announced by the
 government last week was designed in part to
 reassure foreign lenders and thus facilitate im-
 mediate borrowing.
 Chances of obtaining the needed funds short
 of renegotiation are slim, however, because
 rapidly mounting opposition to the austerity
 measures makes it unlikely they can be carried
 out. Labor, which was responsible for destroying
 last July's program, has been sharply critical of the
 new measures. New strikes and threats of strikes
 already have been reported as workers demand
 wage hikes four times as large as those allowed
 under the program.

 PHILIPPINES
 Looking to Eastern Europe
 President Marcos over the past few weeks has
 been pushing his campaign to develop a more
 nonaligned image by establishing ties with com-
 munist states.
 The Philippines signed a trade agreement
 with Poland on February 12 with considerable
 fanfare. Trade pacts have also been signed recent-
 ly with Bulgaria and Romania, and similar
 agreements will probably soon be concluded with
 Yugoslavia and Hungary. Marcos pursues these
 agreements ostensibly to diversify markets, but he
 is also using them to balance Manila's traditionally
 close ties with the US.
 Marcos says he will travel to Moscow in late
 May, and we expect that he will announce the es-
 tablishment of diplomatic relations during this
 visit. Marcos seemed ready to make this journey
 last summer, but it was postponed reportedly
 because Moscow would not guarantee meetings
 with the three top Soviet leaders.
 Since last summer the Soviets have urged that
 ties be established before the visit but Marcos has
 refused. Several considerations probably con-
 tributed to Manila's deliberate pace. Filipino
 security officials oppose the opening of several
 communist embassies at the same time, fearing
 that this will make it much more difficult to cope
 with espionage activities, particularly from the
 Soviet embassy. They prefer that the embassies be
 opened gradually one after the other..
 The two sides have been haggling for several
 months over a trade pact; Marcos clearly ex-
 pected an agreement on this before establishing
 diplomatic relations. The Soviets in early March
 went a long way toward meeting Manila's needs
 by agreeing to purchase between 200,000 and
 400,000 metric tons of Philippine sugar-a
 welcome development in view of the Philippines
 unsold sugar stocks of around one million tons.
 Marcos may also have been holding out for
 assurances from Moscow that he will be given a
 p cT
 red carpet reception this summer. A highly
 publicized visit would be far more useful in
 boosting his nonaligned image than a simple an-
 nouncement of the establishment of relations. In
 Marcos' view, the trip to Moscow might also help
 balance any new agreements on US base rights in
 the Philippines that are scheduled for renegotia-
 tion this spring.
 JAPAN: INDUSTRIAL MERGERS
 Two years of recession has further concen-
 trated economic power in the hanes of the larger
 Japanese companies. The disappearance of
 smaller firms through merger or business failure
 has been under way for some time in several ma-
 jor industries. Although prompted by financial
 problems stemming from depressed sales, this
 further consolidation of industry will strengthen
 the market power of Japanese firms abroad and
 help minimize foreign competition at home. The
 last major industrial revamping, wh.ch occurred

 SECRET
 following the 1965 recession, was specifically aim-
 ed at strengthening Japan's international com-
 petitive position.
 Mergers involving companies that account
 for at least 5 percent of Japanese industrial output
 have taken place over the past six months or are
 actively under discussion. The largest regrouping
 has occurred in the textile industry, where three
 of the five largest manufacturers have combined
 into the world's largest textile exporting com-
 pany. In 1974, these firms accounted for one sixth
 of Japanese textile exports.
 The three major specialty steel producers also
 have merged and discussions are reportedly un-
 der way among three of the top six auto manufac-
 turers. The proposed auto combine would turn
 out half as many cars as General Motors. The six
 largest computer manufacturers are merging into
 three groups to compete more effectively with US
 manufacturers.
 The spurt in business mergers in large
 measure is an outgrowth of recession, as firms
 that have emerged in good financial position see
 opportunities to expand their market power. Mit-
 subishi reportedly is taking the lead in talks that
 could involve the take-over of two auto manufac-
 turers that were hurt by the slump in foreign auto
 demand last year.
 Since late 1973, more than 30,000 firms have
 gone under, including 15,000 industrial com-
 panies. The failure of small-scale textile and elec-
 tronics producers has helped the top 10 manufac-
 turers substantially increase their market share
 over the past two years. The giant trading com-
 panies, which handle 70 percent of Japan's
 foreign commerce, are also becoming increasing-
 ly dominant. The merger of C. Itoh and Co. and
 the financially troubled Ataka and Co. will com-
 bine the fourth and ninth largest trading firms to
 make the third largest.
 Tokyo so far has taken a positive attitude
 toward industry consolidation, actively promoting
 mergers in some instances. The government is
 anxious to avoid the failure of larger firms. When
 necessary, it presses financially stronger firms to
 bail out weaker rivals through merger. In this ap-
 proach the government has been helped by the
 major commercial banks and trading firms, which
 wield substantial influence within the major
 Japanese conglomerates.
 The Ministry of International Trade and In-
 dustry is considering an overall review of how in-
 dustry might be restructured over the longer
 term. One key issue concerns the adjustment of
 the industrial structure to deal with the slower
 economic growth anticipated for the future. The
 ministry wants above all to assure a strong inter-
 national competitive position for major Japanese
 industries. In this vein, the ministry has been the
 prime mover behind plans to restructure the
 computer industry before Tokyo's controls on
 foreign investment are lifted. The ministry is also
 the driving force behind plans to reorganize
 Japanese-owned oil companies to put them on an
 equal footing with the major international oil
 companies.
 Tokyo seems able to waive antimonopoly
 laws to smooth the way for mergers or other
 forms of industry reorganization. In the past, the
 law has been circumvented to permit the es-
 tablishment of temporary market-sharing and
 price-fixing cartels. In the last 18 months, formal
 cartels have been organized among manufac-
 turers of various textile and steel products with an
 eye toward avoiding excessive competition dur-
 ing the recession. Although the cartels are being
 gradually phased out as demand recovers, infor-
 mal market-sharing is likely to linger.
 While the Ministry of International Trade and
 Industry is largely responsible for overseeing in-
 dustry reorganization, it faces opposition from
 the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, which is
 responsible to the prime minister. In the past
 three years the commission has been pushing for
 more vigorous implementation of antimonopoly
 statutes and has had some support from the Diet.
 The ministry nonetheless clearly retains the upper

 NORTH KOREA: ANTI-US CAMPAIGN
 Pyongyang is attempting to exploit recent US
 moves in support of Seoul to build a case for its
 own policies at the nonaligned summit in Colom-
 bo this summer and at the UN in the fall.
 Pyongyang's new anti-US propaganda cam-
 paign has focused on the deployment of F-111
 fighter-bombers to South Korea by the US last
 month. The campaign also features the usual
 charges that the US has sent additional troops and
 nuclear weapons into South Korea and hits hard
 on the theme that military cooperation among
 the US, South Korea, and Japan has been
 strengthened. Pyongyang described these
 developments as having created a "grave
 situation" in which "war may break out at any
 time."
 The North Koreans have used similar
 language periodically in the past, but since late
 February such warnings have been featured
 almost daily in Pyongyang's propaganda.
 Moreover, Pyongyang assailed the F-111 deploy-
 ment in a formal Foreign Ministry statement, the
 highest level North Korean protest of a US action
 in South Korea since 1971, and the Supreme
 People's Assembly in Pyongyang has sent an open
 letter to sympathetic governments around the
 world calling for support.
 The Third World is an important target for
 Pyongyang's campaign; there is considerable
 sympathy there for North Korea's claim that the
 Korean problem is a colonial issue and that the
 source of tension on the peninsula is the con-
 tinuing presence of US forces in the South.
 Pyongyang has been successful in winning the
 support of nonaligned militants, but many Third
 World countries remain reluctant to become in-
 volved in the Korean dispute. This search for
 Third World support strongly suggests that
 Pyongyang will press for another confrontation at
 the UN General Assembly this fall.
 Both Peking and Moscow have been cir-
 cumspect in replaying Pyongyang's attacks on the
 US. The Chinese have given them a bit more
 coverage than the Soviets, but both have exclud-
 ed the more inflammatory comment. Peking's
 counterpart to the North Korean Assembly-the
 National People's Congress-has responded to
 Pyongyang's appeal for support, emphasizing
 Chinese solidarity with Pyongyang but playing
 down North Korean charges about US actions in-
 creasing the level of tension. The. Soviet backed
 World Federation of Trade Unions and the Soviet
 media have issued brief, low-keyed comments on
 the North Korean appeal, but so far Moscow has
 made no official response.
 CHINA: MARKING TIME ON TENG
 The new campaign in China has appeared to
 mark time in the past week. Media attacks on
 Teng Hsiao-ping remain at a high level but have
 not gone beyond calls to criticize, rather than
 overthrow him. The official Chinese news agency
 hinted on March 15, as the media have done in
 the past, that Teng can still redeem himself if he
 repents, but the propaganda as well as statements
 by Chinese officials indicates that he has thus far
 refused to do so. The impression that there is
 something of a stalemate among China's con-
 flicting political forces appears strengthened by
 this relative inactivity.
 Acting Premier Hua Kuo-feng is the only
 national leader to speak publicly on the cam-
 paign. At a dinner for the visiting Laotian premier
 on March 15, Hua characterized the campaign as
 a "debate" in the fields of education, science,
 literature and art. Hua's remarks were similar to
 those he made at a dinner for former President
 Nixon in February and were generally milder than
 some of the more blunt media attacks on Teng. As
 was the case in February, Hua refrained from
 making a personal reference to Teng or from us-
 ing the term "capitalist roader," the media's
 codeword for Teng.
 In the provinces, most provincial leaders
 seem to be staying in the background. Only one

 province chief has gone on public record with a
 criticism of Teng. Although the party's left wing
 undoubtedly would like to broaden the attacks
 on Teng to include a number of other officials
 who may have been associated with him, thus far
 wall posters in the provinces have attacked only
 about five provincial leaders by name.
 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS
 Currency markets remained unsettled this
 week as speculators attempted to evaluate the im-
 pact of the French decision to withdraw the franc
 from the European joint float.
 The French decision came after Paris failed in
 an attempt to achieve a general realignment of
 parities at a special meeting of European finance
 ministers. Paris wanted to couple a franc devalua-
 tion with revaluations of some other float curren-
 cies, including the Deutsche mark and Dutch
 guilder. Bonn, reversing an earlier stand, was
 reportedly willing to go along with a small
 revaluation, but the Dutch refused.
 The immediate cause of France's decision was
 the heavy cost of supporting the franc within the
 float's narrow limits-roughly $5 billion since the
 beginning of the year. Speculative pressure on
 the franc began in January as investors bought
 traditionally strong European currencies in reac-
 tion to problems with the Italian lira and the
 devaluation of the Spanish peseta. The
 resurgence of pressure two weeks ago was
 triggered by a run on the British pound that sent
 sterling below the $2.00 level.
 France's failure to bring inflation down to a
 rate close to those of its major trading partners in
 the float and prospects for a substantial French
 current account deficit this year have been the
 underlying cause of the franc's weakness. French
 prices are rising at roughly two to three times the
 West German rate. After achieving balance in its
 current account last year, France faces a deficit of
 roughly $4 billion in 1976.
 The decision to pull out of the float further
 damages Giscard's image at home. He was per-
 sonally responsible for the decision to re-enter
 the joint float last July despite opposition from his
 advisers who felt the franc was overvalued. The
 left will point to the decision to leave the float as a
 further indication of the government's inability to
 deal with the country's economic problems.
 France's exit from the joint float has again
 demonstrated the difficulty of proceeding with
 currency integration in the EC before economic
 policy is harmonized. Widely varying inflation
 rates will continue to block a comprehensive
 currency union, and it remains doubtful that true
 policy coordination among the nine will be possi-
 ble for some time. With France out of the float,
 some voices may be heard to advocate "two-tier"
 economic planning within the Community, per-
 mitting advances by the countries remaining in
 the float. Never very attractive in political terms,
 such notions seem likely to garner even less sup-
 port with France and Germany on opposite sides
 of the "float line."
 Speculative pressure on West European
 currencies continued this week in the wake of
 France's decision. The French franc traded as low
 as 4.78 on Monday and closed at 4.71 on Thursday,
 down nearly 3.5 percent from the close on Friday,
 March 12. The lira fell to a record low of 888 to the
 dollar on Wednesday. According to press reports,
 the Bank of Italy helped precipitate the decline by
 selling lira on Monday. The lira sales were ap-
 parently designed to preserve the lira's com-
 petitiveness with the French franc. The Benelux
 countries, also under speculative pressure, ended
 their narrower band within the joint float.
 Speculators continued to put pressure on the
 joint float, forcing the Danish krone and Belgian
 franc to the bottom of the band and the Deutsche
 mark to the top. If the French franc declines 25X1
 further against joint float currencies, as seems
 likely, pressure will mount for a Belgian franc
