 OF IMMEDIATE. INTEREST
 SUEZ DEVELOPMENTS   .  .     . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .     Page   1
 As the UN Security Council prepares to debate the
 Suez issue, Britain and France seem assured of support
 from Australia and Belgium, but there is some doubt re-
 garding the attitudes of Peru, Cuba, and China.                                       Iran,
 as spokesman for the Near East on the council, will
 probably follow a cautious course.  Egypt is likely to
 receive full support from the USSR and probably from
 Yugoslavia.   In Egypt, about half the old force of
 pilots continues to operate the canal with only minor
 interruptions.
 Israel's attack on Jordanian military positions
 southwest of Jerusalem on 25-26 September will probably
 be followed by a period of tension comparable to that
 which followed a similar raid against Egyptian forces
 in the Gaza strip just over a year ago.  Neither side
 appears ready to expand this incident--or series of
 incidents--into an all-out war.

 SOVIET POLICY SPLIT RUMORED
 OVER TITO AND SATELLITES .:t .    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  .      Page   1
 As a result of Khrushchev's trip to Yugoslavia,
 reports have been circulating that the rapprochement
 with Tito and his influence in the Satellites have
 caused a rift in the Soviet leadership.          It is probable
 that the consequences of recent "liberal" Soviet
 policies toward the Satellites and Yugoslavia are a
 cause of real concern to the Soviet leaders but that
 they have not led to a split among them.  Khrushchev's
 return to the USSR on 27 September, accompanied by
 Tito, his wife, and Yugoslav vice premier Rankovic,
 indicates that discussions on Soviet-Yugoslav relations
 will continue.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY

 DIVERGENT SATELLITE ATTITUDES
 TOWARD THE USSR   .  .  .  .    .  .  . ..  .  .  .    .  .  000. , .0     Page  2
 The frank and often critical treatment of the USSR
 in the Polish press is completely different from articles
 on the USSR appearing elsewhere in the Satellites..  While
 Polish papers are stressing the "independence of countries
 in the socialist camp" and playing down references to
 the USSR, articles in Albania and Czechoslovakia are
 virtually attacking the doctrine of "many roads to
 socialism" and are hailing close relations with the USSR
 as the indispensable foundation of the Satellite regimes.
 HUNGARIAN WRITERS DEMAND
 FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page  3
 Hungarian writers, who have spearheaded the drive
 for moderate policies, have resumed their offensive
 against the Communist regime following a two-month
 period of relative restraint.      They met in Budapest in
 mid-September to rally support for their cause and to
 re-endorse as their leaders those individuals who have
 led them in their fight for freedom of expression.
 Although viewed with varying degrees of disapproval by
 government leaders, the writers' program is more apt
 to be met with compromise than with repression.
 CHINESE COMMUNIST STATEMENT
 ON GENEVA TALKS   .  .  .  .  .  .  .
 In its fourth official statement this year on the
 Johnson-Wang talks at Geneva, Communist China on 21
 September repeated previous warnings against "dragging
 out the talks."   The tone of the statement was moderate,
 and Peiping's expression of its desire to move on to a
 new subject suggests that the Chi
 break off the talks at this time.

 Speeches at the Chinese Communist eighth. party
 congress, which was to end on 27 September, continued
 to place major emphasis on collective leadership and
 "democratic" m6thods at all levels.  The special
 praise Mao Tse-tung received was extended, in some
 degree to Liu Shao-chi, who has apparently been chosen
 by Mao as the leader of the group that is to succeed
 him.

 CHOU EN-LAI PLANS
 MAJOR ASIAN TOUR .  .  .  .     .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .    .  .  .  .     Page  7
 Chinese Communist premier Chou En-lai will leave
 Peiping in late November for a tour through South and
 Southeast Asia which may take him to the capitals of
 ten Asian nations.  Chou's general objective probably
 is to repeat his success at the Bandung conference of
 1955 and renew the image he created then of Communist
 China as a peace-loving great power.
 Should President Somoza of Nicaragua die as a result
 of the assassination attempt of 21 September, a long
 period of political uncertainty and violence may follow.
 The National Guard, Nicaragua's only armed force, would
 be a decisive factor in the post-Somoza political scene,
 and the defense minister, Colonel Francisco Gaitan,
 would probably play a leading role.
 SOVIET BLOC CULTURAL CENTERS

 Soviet bloc countries are having some success with
 cultural and friendship societies in Latin America.
 These organizations are important in providing means
 through which bloc contacts with Latin America may be

 Pakistani president Mirza's desire to join the Suez
 Canal Users' Association and Prime Minister Suhrawardy's
 unwillingness to do so may result in a dispute between
 the two men which could end in Suhrawardy's dismissal
 or resignation.   In this event, President Mirza would
 probably attempt to govern by direct rule.
 JAPANESE POLITICAL DISPUTES
 OVER RELATIONS WITH USSR .  .  .  . .  ...  .  .  .  .  .    .    .  .       Page 12
 A new series of political disputes has been touched
 off in Japan by Soviet premier Bulganin's ambiguous
 note of 14 September agreeing to resume negotiations on
 the basis of the Japanese "five-point" proposal.  The
 anti-Hatoyama movement within the Liberal-Democratic
 Party is growing and some elements have threatened to
 split the party if the prime minister goea  to Mnsnnw
 bef ore the Soviet position is clarified.

 Major difficulties still block early reunification
 of the Socialists in Italy despite recent expressions
 of optimism by Democratic Socialist and Nenni Socialist
 spokesmen.   Sentiment.for reunification seems to be
 strong among the rank and file of both parties.
 Moscow is taking a cautious attitude on the reunification
 move.                                                                                      25X1

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 PROSPECTS FOR THE MOLLET GOVERNMENT  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .     Page 1
 When the French National Assembly reconvenes on 2
 October, Premier Mollet will face mounting political
 opposition as a result of growing frustration over the
 Suez crisis, the Algerian problem and domestic.inflation,
 Mollet will not take a merely defensive attitude toward
 these problems.  He may in any event be overthrown in
 his attempts to deal with them.
 PROSPECTS FOR THE SOCIALIST PARTY OF JAPAN .
 The Japan Socialist Party has gained sufficient
 strength to worry seriously the dominant conservatives,
 but it is not expected to gain power in the near future.
 Although 'the party suffers from immaturity and faction-
 alism, its influence will affect Japan's domestic and
 foreign policies.   It will continue to oppose many
 American objectives and push for greater "independence."

 THE DE-STALINIZATION CAMPAIGN IN SOVIET GEORGIA.  .  .  . .                Page 7
 In the face of the unexpected popular resentment in
 Georgia to the attack on Stalin at the 20th Soviet party
 congress, de-Stalinization was delayed there but has
 now begun in earnest.  The effect of the incident on
 Georgian nationalism will probably color relations
 betwee                          cow government for years to
 come.

 SUEZ DEVELOPMENTS
 As the UN Security Council
 prepares to debate the Suez
 issue, support of Britain and
 France from Australia and Bel-
 gium appears virtually certain,
 but there is some doubt re-
 garding the attitudes of Peru,
 Cuba, and China.   Iran's posi-
 tion as spokesman for the Near
 East on the council will prob-
 ably lead it to take an ex-
 tremely cautious approach.
 Egypt, attending as an in-
 terested party, is likely to
 receive full support from the
 Soviet Union and probably Yugo-
 slavia.   For the Soviet Union,
 the deliberations will serve
 as a propaganda forum for re-
 asserting the similarity of
 Soviet and Arab po'icies on
 colonial matters, and an op-
 portunity to draw out negotia-
 tions for a peaceful settle-
 ment on Egypt's terms.
 The USSR's position prob-
 ably will hew closely to the
 Soviet statement of 15 Septem-
 ber, defending nationalization
 of the canal and Egyptian com-
 petence to operate it and sup-
 porting Nasr's call for a 45-
 nation conference as a means
 of achieving a peaceful solu-
 tion to the problem.   Moscow
 is likely to attack very
 strongly Western economic pres-
 sure on Egypt as economic sanc-
 tions without UN authorization.
 Moscow radio on 25 September
 stated that the Western appeal
 to the United Nations "is hard-
 ly likely to bring success."
 Through amendments voted
 on separately and possibly
 paragraph by paragraph, any
 resolution introduced by
 SECRET
 Britain and France maybe so
 modified as to compel them
 to vote against it themselves.
 Any amendment eschewing the
 use of force would be as dif-
 ficult to oppose as to defeat.
 Some elements in both
 Britain and France hope that
 an inconclusive UN debate will
 "prove" the necessity for more
 direct action.   Despite this
 and recent minor additions to
 the military build-up, London
 and Paris probably do not in-
 tend the UN appeal to be merely
 a preliminary step to the ap-
 plication of military force
 against Egypt.
 While attention centers
 on the United Nations, Britain
 is proceeding with its plans
 to set up a Suez Canal Users'
 Association (SCUA) at meetings
 in London beginning on 1 Octo-
 ber.   France's grudging ac-
 ceptance of the plan dramatized
 the widespread  lack of enthu-
 siasm among the 18 London con-
 fereesfor the project that
 many had initially hoped would
 show the way to forcing a set-
 tlement on Egypt.
 Only seven have indicated
 they definitely will join:
 Britain, the United States,
 Italy, France, the Netherlands,
 Denmark,  and Sweden.   Accept-
 ances from six others--Austra-
 lia, New Zealand, West Germany,
 Portugal, Turkey and Norway--
 are anticipated.

 that Pakistan would not as-
 sociate with the users' as-
 sociation, and the ambassador
 believes that no pressure from
 the West or from President
 Mirza will change the prime
 minister's mind (see Part II,
 p..  11)..   Japan evidently in-
 tends to reject. membership.
 Of the remaining three,
 Iran is hesitant to align it-
 self publicly against Egypt.
 Spain's joining is doubtful,
 in view of its continued
 pressing of its own proposal
 for negotiations with Nasr.
 Ethiopia's position is uncer-
 tain.
 Even among those most
 favorable toward the users'
 association, little agreement
 on SCUA's precise function is
 evident.  The 18-nation dis-
 cussions at London that'ended
 on 21 September showed far too
 great differences to support
 any such a firm plan as sending
 a test ship through the canal
 to try Nasr's intentions.
 Britain and France still seek
 an active role for the organ-

 Disillusion and discour-
 agement with the results of
 the second London conference
 have been most marked in France.
 Blame has fallen principally
 on the United States.   Foreign
 Minister Pineau has reiterated
 that direct force is not ex-
 cluded.
 Premier Mollet will prob-
 ably be forced into a debate
 on Suez when the National As-
 sembly reconvenes on 2 October.
 The government will be sub-
 jected to bitter attacks as a
 result of the mounting opposi-
 tion to its Suez policy,
 conbined with frustration over
 the Algerian situation and
 domestic economic and social
 problems.   (See Part III, p.
 1.)
 In Britain, the turn of
 events has centered attention
 on conflicting pressures with-
 in the Conservative cabinet.
 There are no indications that
 Eden's hold on the party leader-
 ship has been shaken.  The Con-
 servative Party conference on
 11-13 October should give some
 indication of Eden's standing
 with the rank and file, and
 also the relative prestige of
 Chancellor of the Exchequer
 Macmillan and House of Com-
 mons leader Butler, respective
 champions of toughness and con-
 ciliation.   Parliament recon-
 venes on 23 October.
 Egyptian Developments
 Egypt continues to main-
 tain canal operations without
 a major interruption.   For the
 first time since the Western
 pilots walked out, three ships
 were held up for lack of pilots
 on 23 September when the high-
 est total of ships since the
 walkout--44--transited. Three
 convoys a day is likely to re-
 main standard procedure until
 more pilots are trained.
 About 100 pilots are now
 available--approximately half
 the number before nationaliza-
 tion.  More than 40 new foreign
 pilots have arrived, including
 15 from the Soviet Union, 12
 from Poland, and 11 from Yugo-
 slavia.
 President Nasr sought to
 demonstrate solidarity within
 the Arab bloc by going to
 Dammam with Syrian president
 Quwatli for talks with King
 Saud of Saudi Arabia.  The

 Syrian and Saudi chiefs could
 hardly do less for Egypt at
 this time than the communique
 they issued reaffirming their
 support.   Nasr evidently was
 concerned lest Saud?s preceding
 talks with King Faisal of Ira
 suggest Arab differences.
 Nehru?s statement
 criticizing Nasr's method of
 Suez nationalization almost
 certainly has also given the
 Egyptian president some worry.
 Numerous press reports
 and rumors of the presence of
 British and French military
 units in Israel reflect ex-
 treme Arab nervousness and
 suspicion--reinforced by re-
 cent Israeli raids on Jordan
 and the sale of Canadian-built
 jet fighters to Israel--that
 the West will take advantage
 of Egypt's preoccupation and
 move on the Arab states in
 concert with Israel.
 Sino-Soviet Support
 Apart from pilots, Egypt
 continues to receive economic
 support from the Soviet Union,
 Israel's attack on Jorda-
 nian military positions south-
 west of Jerusalem on 25-26 Sep-
 tember will probably be fol-
 lowed by a period of high ten-
 sion comparable to that which
 followed a similar raid against
 Egyptian forces in the Gaza
 strip just over a year ago.
 Neither side, however, appears
 ready to expand this incident--
 and has had offers from Com-
 munist China.  A delegation of
 Soviet cotton production spe-
 cialists arrived in Egypt on
 19 September for a three-week
 visit.   The group is led by
 Deputy Minister of Agriculture
 Rasulov, and,  in addition to
 other high agricultural of-
 ficials, includes the minister
 of light industry of the Tadzhik
 Republic.   Chou En-lai, in re-
 porting to the Standing Com-
 mittee of the National People's
 Congress,  stated his govern-
 ment's complete support of the
 Egyptian position.
 Over the last two weeks,
 Soviet propaganda attacks on
 the American position on Suez
 have steadily increased,
 especially in broadcasts to the
 Arab states, which say the
 United States is no better than
 Britain and France, label as
 American all "colonial" plans,
 and claim that American policy
 is hostile to Egypt, the Arabs,
 and peace and security.   A
 Pravda editorial on 24 Septem-
 er pointed to the "failure"
 of the London conference and
 called Western introduction of
 the Suez dispute into the
 United Nations another colonial
 maneuver.
 or series of incidents--into
 an all-out war.
 As: usual after the Israelis
 inflict a serious blow, Arab
 propaganda sought to minimize
 the political impact of the
 raid by asserting that Jorda-
 nian forces made a strong de-
 fense and were overrun only by
 "overwhelming" Israeli numbers.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE 'WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 September 1956
 It seems that in this case, at
 least, there may be some sub-
 stance to the claims.
 Israel reportedly suffered
 substantial losses, since its
 attack was launched against
 prepared positions in full
 moonlight, and because the
 Jordanians had anticipated that
 an Israeli reprisal would come
 despite Amman's apologetic
 assertion that "temporary in-
 sanity" seized a machine gunner
 who killed four Israeli archae-
 ologists two days before.
 With Egypt still preoc-
 cupied with the Suez situation,
 the Arab reaction is likely to
 be confined mainly to com-
 plaining and biding time, al-
 though there almost certainly
 will be further minor Jorda-
 nian incursions into Israel,
 either centrally directed or un-
 controlled by the Amman au-
 thorities.
 The initial attitude of
 Jordan's leaders was indicated
 by an appeal from Chief of
 Staff Nuwar, who stated short-
 ly after the Israeli attack
 began that unless it were
 stopped by morning there would
 be very serious consequences.
 These were not the words of a
 military leader seeking an op-
 portunity to attack the enemy.
 King Hussain's immediate
 reaction was to consult with
 Arab and Western diplomats, and
 to consider making a complaint
 to the UN Security Council.
 The effect of the Israeli
 raid is likely to be greatest
 on the internal situation in
 Jordan.   It seems doubtful that
 Hussain will want to repeat on
 this occasion the tactic he
 adopted in regard to earlier
 Israeli actions--an appeal to
 the people for calm on the
 ground that Jordan should not
 let itself be drawn into an
 Israeli trap.  Such an implicit
 confession of weakness would
 further erode his prestige,
 even if his opponents were
 unable to suggest a better
 course themselves.
 Hussain may, however, use
 the incident and the ensuing
 tension as an excuse to post-
 pone the parliamentary elec-
 tions scheduled for 21 October.
 Under present conditions, such
 elections would probably re-
 turn a majority of extremists
 indifferent or hostile to the
 monarchy.  The king may also
 use the incident to justify a
 new flurry of visits to Arab
 countries with the object of
 establishing closer Arab unity
 and obtaining additional fi-
 nancial support for Jordan's
 military forces.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 SOVIET POLICY SPLIT RUMORED
 OVER TITO AND SATELLITES
 As a result of Khrushchev's
 trip to Yugoslavia, reports
 have been circulating that the
 rapprochement with Tito and
 his influence in the Satellites
 have caused a rift in the So-
 viet leadership.
 The American embassy in
 Belgrade, reports that a high
 Yugoslav official recently
 said that Khrushchev is "alone
 in the more liberal approach
 to Yugoslavia" and that the
 other Soviet leaders, includ-
 ing Bulganin and Mikoyan, would
 turn on him "at the first false
 step."  Yugoslav vice president
 Vukma.novic-Tempo has also hint-
 ed that Khrushchev may be in
 trouble a
 This Yugoslav hypothesis
 argues that Khrushchev, having
 sponsored the rapprochement
 with Tito, now finds that Tito,
 is endangering the Soviet sys-
 tem of making trouble in the
 Satellites, and went to Yugo-
 slavia to get Tito to "call
 off the dogs."
 It is likely that the
 consequences of recent Soviet
 policy toward the Satellites
 and Yugoslavia. are causing
 varying degrees of concern to
 all Soviet leaders.  Tito's
 continued pressure for lib-
 eralization in the Satellites
 and the results of some of the
 liberal policies already being
 enacted in Eastern Europe may
 have forced the Soviet leaders
 to decide to toughen up.
 Khrushchev's return to the USSR
 on 27 September, accompanied
 by Tito, his wife, and Yugoslav
 vice premier Rankovic,, prob-
 ably indicates that discussions
 on Soviet Yugoslav relations
 will continue.

 DIVERGENT SATELLITE ATTITUDES
 TOWARD THE USSR
 The remarkably frank and
 sometimes critical treatment
 of the USSR in the Polish press
 is completely different from
 articles on the USSR appearing
 elsewhere in the Satellites.
 While Polish papers are stress-
 ing the "independence of coun-
 tries in the socialist camp"
 and playing down references to
 the USSR, articles in Albania
 and Czechoslovakia are virtually
 attacking the doctrine of "many
 roads to socialism" and are
 hailing close relations with
 the USSR as the indispensable
 foundations of the Satellite
 regimes.
 Poland
 According to at least one
 Polish author, writing this
 month in testimony to Polish-
 Soviet Friendship Month, Polish
 relations with'the USSR "are
 only being formed" and have as
 yet to "find their equilibrium."
 The same.writer suggests that
 the "tragic element of truth"
 heading an effective opposition
 to Khrushchev.   Khrushchev's
 successful "packing" of the cen-
 tral committee last February
 also militates against the
 chances of a leadership upheaval.
 Finally,  it is unlikely
 that the figures most intimately
 concerned would be away from Mos-
 cow if, in fact, a major split
 did exist in the leadership over
 the Yugoslav issue. Khrushchev,
 however, was on vacation for
 more than two weeks before he
 left for Belgrade.  Bulganin has
 been vacationing in the Caucasus
 since 1 September.  Mikoyan was
 away between 14 and 24 September
 as the leader of the Soviet dele-
 gation to Peiping.
 about Soviet-Polish relations
 during the war has been con-
 cealed and that the full story
 should now be told.
 A Polish radio commentator,
 speaking to a domestic audience
 on 19 September, stated that the
 appearance of critical comments
 "shows the evolution of our
 friendship with the USSR--from
 sugar-coated, lacquered glorious
 descriptions of everything that
 was Soviet to the present sober
 evaluations."  Admitting that
 the present period of franker
 discussion of the USSR is caus-
 ing "considerable difficulties"
 because of "conservative" oppo-
 sition both in Poland and in
 the USSR, the same speaker
 nevertheless claimed that the
 "new atmosphere is spreading
 with varying speed" throughout
 the bloc.

 least two other members of the
 bloc--Albania and Czechoslovakia.
 An Albanian editorial, on the
 occasion of Albania's Soviet
 Friendship Month, claimed that
 "only the enemies of socialism"
 try to deny the international
 importance of the USSR.   The
 Albanian party has "always based
 its activities on the valuable
 and tested experience of the
 Soviet Communist Party."
 The Czech party daily,
 Rude Pravo, took a similar line
 on    September.   The Czech re-
 gime, the paper declared, is
 based on its alliance with the
 USSR; consequently, attitudes
 toward the USSR are not a fit
 subject for discussion.   Every
 "slander" against the Soviet
 Union is aimed against the very
 existence of Czechoslovakia.
 All of these statements
 were made after 3 September,
 when the USSR reportedly warned
 the Satellites that the Soviet
 Union, not Yugoslavia, was the
 correct socialist model and
 attacked the Yugoslav concept
 of genuinely "independent roads
 to socialism."  The reaction in
 Albania and Czechoslovakia,
 apparently to this warning, re-
 flects loyal, unquestioning
 subservience to the latest line
 from Moscow.
 Irritation Over Warning

 FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
 Hungarian writers who have
 spearheaded the drive for moder-
 ate  policies have resumed their
 offensive against the Communist
 regime, following a two-month
 period of relative restraint.
 They met in Budapest in mid-
 much in line with their apparent
 irritation over an earlier Soviet
 warning, delivered by Bulganin
 in Warsaw last July, about the
 limits of de-Stalinization and
 freedom from Soviet control.
 The chief of the Polish parlia-
 mentary delegation in Yugoslavia,
 for example, declared on 20
 September that what had struck
 him most during his visit was
 the Yugoslav "independence of
 views" and a "boldness for in-
 dependent experimenting in
 building socialism."
 A great many Polish Com-
 munist officials apparently
 see a real need for a modifica-
 tion of Polish-Soviet relations,
 within the framework of an al-
 liance with the USSR.  They
 seem bent on gaining this, re-
 gardless of the attitudes in
 the other Satellites and re-
 gardless of signs of disapproval
 from Moscow.
 Specific official statements
 concerning Soviet-Satellite re-
 lations have not been observed
 in recent weeks from Hungary,
 East Germany, Rumania and Bul-
 garia.   On the basis of their
 over-all policies, however, it

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 September. 1956
 within the regime, the writers'
 program is more apt to be met
 with compromise than with re-
 pression.
 Renewed Attack
 The uneasy cease-fire dur-
 ing the first weeks of the Gero
 regime between the government
 and the writers, who play a
 strong political role in Com-
 munist nations, was brought to
 a dramatic close on 8 September
 by Gyula Hay, a leading Hun-
 garian Communist writer.   Hay,
 in a magazine article, demanded
 complete freedom of expression
 for "both Marxists and non-
 Marxists, the right to believe
 in God or not to believe in
 God, the right to criticize
 anybody or anything, and to
 like or not to like any of
 Hungary's leaders."  Hay's posi?
 tion was democratic in tone
 and concept and, in, effect, rep-
 resents  a public denial of
 Communist omnipotence.
 This attack,  described by
 the American legation in Buda-
 pest as the clearest challenge
 to Communism yet publicized,
 set the stage for the general
 meeting of the Hungarian Writ-
 ers' Association which opened
 on 17 September.   Speaker after
 speaker, inspired by Hay's
 words and angered by two antag-
 onistic  Szabad Nep editorials
 on the eve of the meeting, in-
 dulged in defiant speeches
 against Hungarian regime poli-
 cies and regime "reactionaries."
 The writers, as a body,
 vigorously re-endorsed their
 leadership and also elected to
 high office in their associa-
 tion a number of members who
 had been censured for "anti-
 party" views during Rakosi's
 tenure in office.   Hay was
 elected vice president and
 several non-Communist writers
 were elected to the presidium.
 The writers repeatedly
 asserted their unwillingness
 to compromise on any points.
 As one writer stated,  "We can-
 not enter into a 'gentlemen's
 agreement' with anybody, we
 must go straight to our goal."
 As a group, the writers
 appeared sensitive to the fact
 that some of their attitudes
 are known only in literary cir-
 cles and hence do not have wide-
 spread popular support.   To
 rectify this, one literary
 leader proposed that groups of
 writers visit factories to en-
 sure that their point of view
 is received by working groups.
 Party Reaction
 Since Rakosi's ouster, the
 new party leadership, headed by
 doctrinaire party first secre-
 tary Gero but including a num-
 ber of moderate Communists, has
 moved steadily toward moderate
 domestic policies, including a
 significantly more concessionary
 attitude toward the intellec-
 tuals. Reaction within the party,
 however, to the present sweep-
 ing demands of the writers will
 be mixed.   The natural response
 of party first secretary Gero,
 who personifies the doctrinaires,
 presumably would be to resist.
 The regime as a whole, however,
 which includes a significant
 number of party moderates, ap-
 pears to have little inclina-
 tion to crack down on the writers
 for their beliefs at this time
 and may grant added concessions
 in an effort to appease the in-
 telligentsia.
 But the "moderate" forces
 in the party are not unanimous
 in their views.   One group, in-
 cluding a significant number
 of party intellectuals and
 activists who support former
 premier Imre Nagy, is undoubt-
 edly sympathetic to and active
 in support of the demands of
 the writers.

 Members of this group are

 a direct challenge to the prin-

 in effect, the primacy of the

 CHINESE COMMUNIST STATEMENT
 ON GENEVA TALKS
 In its fourth official
 statement this year on the
 Johnson-Wang talks at Geneva,
 Communist China indicated on
 21 September that it regards
 further discussion of the US
 proposal on a renunciation of
 force in the Taiwan area as
 fruitless and repeated previous
 warnings against "dragging out
 the talks."  The tone of the
 statement was moderate, however,
 and Peiping's expression of its
 desire to move on to a new sub-
 ject  suggests that the Chinese
 do not intend to break off the
 talks at this time.
 The Chinese comments on
 the renunciation-of-force ques-
 tion indicate that Peiping will
 not agree to any declaration
 which might compromise its
 position that the "liberation"
 of Taiwan is an internal problem
 to be settled by peaceful means
 if possible, but by force if
 necessary.   Peiping evidently
 expects no concessions from the
 United States on this question,
 and believes that continued
 exploration of the issue will
 yield no further propaganda
 advantage.
 Peiping charges that al-
 though the Communists have "time
 and again" put forward propos-

 ment of disputes--including a
 conference of foreign ministers
 --the United States has made
 agreement impossible by per-
 sisting in its demands for a
 declaration on the renunciation
 of force which would infringe
 on China's "sovereignty."  In
 order that the Geneva meetings
 may not be further "dragged

 which was to end on 27 Septem-

 collective leadership and "demo-
 cratic" methods at all levels.
 Mao Tse-tung still received
 special praise, and Liu Shao-
 chi was included in this treat-
 ment to some extent.
 Collective Leadership
 Further changes in the
 organization and operation of
 the party have been disclosed
 which appear designed to en-
 hance the "democratic" features
 of party life.   Under the new
 party constitution, national,

 Peiping's statement makes
 no mention of the ten American
 prisoners still held in Commu-

 released after the expiration
 of their sentences.   If the
 Chinese continue this practice,
 which suggests they still re-
 gard the prisoners as having
 some value as hostages, no fur-
 ther releases can be expected

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 September 1956
 Peng's speech confirmed
 that in the Chinese Communist
 system, party committees at
 all military levels are superior
 to both the military commanders
 and the political officers.   As
 the political officer is usually
 the head of the party committee,
 in most cases the political of-
 ficer is more powerful than the
 commander.
 While hailing China's re-
 cent strides toward increased
 modernization of the armed
 forces, Peng referred only once
 to his air force--fourth largest
 in the world--declaring that it
 is "no longer a very weak one."
 Chinese air defense forces,
 which have consistently demon-
 strated general ineptness, were
 said by Peng to have received
 "modern technical equipment,"
 but Peng made no claim of air
 defense capability.
 Both Liu Shao-chi and
 Teng Hsiao-ping stressed the
 need for party control of gov-
 ernment affairs, which are
 directed by Premier Chou En-7,ai.
 Teng stated that party members
 in government organs must obey
 the party, and that the party
 must regularly discuss and
 decide all policy and impor-
 tant organizational matters
 relating to government work.
 He also said the party must
 exercise regular supervision
 over the work of government
 organs and that no comrades
 should be permitted to make
 their own departments into "in-
 dependent states."
 Treatment of Mao and Liu
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 continues to be the subject of
 laudatory references.   The
 party's successes are attrib-
 uted  "particularly" to Mao,
 although Peiping's comment por-
 trays Mao as a modest personal-
 ity..   Teng said that Mao him-
 self was responsible for pro-
 hibiting the offering of birth-
 day greetings to party leaders
 and the use of their names for
 places, streets and enterprises.
 Liu Shao-chi is now being
 accorded a small share of the
 special propaganda treatment
 previously reserved exclusively
 for Mao.  Teng Hsiao-ping de-
 scribed Liu's report to the
 seventh congress in 1945 as
 being, like Mao's report, a
 "brilliant elucidation" of
 doctrine.   Peiping radio has
 described a new Chinese Commu-
 nist film as depicting the caves
 where "Mao Tse-tung, Liu Shao-
 chi and other leaders" lived
 during Yenan days.   This line
 supports other evidence that
 Mao has chosen Liu as the
 leader of a collective to suc-
 ceed Mao.
 CHOU EN-LAI PLANS
 MAJOR ASIAN TOUR
 Chinese Communist premier
 Chou En-tai will leave Peiping
 in late November for a tour
 through South and Southeast
 Asia which may take him to the
 capitals of ten Asian nations.
 Chou's general objective prob-
 ably  is to repeat his success
 at the Bandung conference of
 1955 and refurbish the image
 he created then of Communist
 China as a "peace-loving" great
 power.  He will undertake ne-
 gotiation of the Sino-Burmese
 boundary dispute while in Ran-
 goon.
 Chou's itinerary apparently
 is not yet firm, but he reportedly

 Cambodia, Burma, India, Pakistan
 and possibly Indonesia, Ceylon,
 Nepal and Afghanistan.   Sou-
 vanna Phouma has denied inviting
 Chou to visit Laos but has in-
 dicated that if he sought an
 invitation, it could not be re-
 fused.
 Chou is tentatively sched-
 uled to arrive in Cambodia in'
 late November, which suggests
 that the first leg of the tour
 will cover North Vietnam, Laos
 and Cambodia, where Peiping has
 apparently been working to es-
 tablish a "southern tier."  A
 dramatic final settlement of the
 Pathet Lao insurrection could
 spell success for this venture..
 Pathet strength derives directly
 from the Viet Minh and indirect-
 ly from Communist China.   Chou
 may thus be in a position to
 arrange a final settlement.   In
 Cambodia, where a Chinese eco-
 nomic aid mission is momentarily
 expected, Chou will meet once
 again with Prince Sihanouk, who
 took over as premier on 15 Sep-
 tember, and may take this oppor-
 tunity to press for formal
 Should President Anastasio
 Somoza of Nicaragua die as a
 result of the 21 September as-
 sassihation attempt, a period

 violence may ensue.   The Nica-

 closer relations with Nepal.
 At the same time, Chou will
 probably try to undercut pos-

 in the Sino-Burmese.boundary
 dispute.
 The main item of business
 during Chou's visit to Rangoon
 will be the boundary question.
 Chou will need all his skill
 as a negotiator to quiet Ran-
 goon's outcries--which jeopard-
 ize  Communist China's pose as
 a "peaceful" power--while tem-
 porizing on substantive issues.

 on his itinerary, Chou will

 and chief of the air force.
 Together, the two brothers can
 probably hold the fort for their
 father if he lives.   Somoza,
 who is in a Panama Canal Zone
 hospital, can constitutionally
 continue as president for up
 to three months as long as he
 remains somewhere in Central
 America or Panama.
 If Somoza dies, any at-
 tempt to maintain the regime
 by force alone would lead to
 serious violence.
 A solution offering the
 best chance of political sta-
 bility would be agreement on a
 new government among the op-
 posing political factions.
 Such an agreement would be pos-
 sible, since the most irrecon-
 cilable issue--Somoza's dicta-
 torship--would no longer exist.
 There are prominent members of
 Somoza's Liberal Party, among
 them Luis Manuel Debayle and
 Alejandro Abaunza Espinosa, who
 opposition  Conservative Party
 leaders have previously indi-
 cated would be acceptable as
 a compromise for president.
 Such an agreement would prob-
 ably require the postponement
 of the February election and
 guarantees of free elections
 later.
 A political solution ac-
 ceptable to the national guard
 would almost certainly have to
 include the replacement of the
 32-year-old "Tachito" as head
 of the guard.   He is hated by
 many officers and known for his
 cruelty and impulsiveness.
 Luis Somoza, an easygoing
 gentleman farmer of 34, might
 be more pliant.   However, the
 actions of the Somoza brothers
 will be dictated by their esti-
 mate as to how they can best
 protect the tremendous wealth
 amassed by their father.
 would be a decisive factor, if
 not directly, then. as a behind-
 the-scenes political referee.
 The minister of defense, Colonel
 Francisco Gaitan, a stanch friend
 of the United States who came
 up through the ranks and enjoys
 wide popularity in the guard,
 would probably be able to con-
 trol the guard.   If political
 leaders are unable to reach an
 acceptable solution on a post-
 Somoza government, or if "Tachi-
 to" attempts to act independent-
 ly, guard leaders would probably
 assume direct control of the
 government.
 The danger of violence
 will be heightened if the re-
 gime carries out widespread
 reprisals against the opposition.
 Although most present evi-
 dence suggests that Somoza's
 attacker acted on his own, the
 Somoza brothers seem to be try-
 ing to implicate Conservative
 leaders or Somoza's enemies in 25X1
 exile.   Over 200 opposition
 leaders were arrested within
 hours of the attack and are now
 undergoing interrogation
 It is still possible that
 evidence may be found--or manu-
 factured--to link the assassi-
 nation attempt with Nicaraguan
 exiles in Costa Rica and, through
 them, with Costa Rican presi-
 dent Figueres.   If so, the Nic-
 caraguan government could be
 expected to react strongly,
 possibly to the extent of in-

 SOVIET BLOC CULTURAL CENTERS
 IN LATIN AMERICA
 Soviet bloc countries are
 having some success with cul-
 tural and friendship societies
 in Latin America.  These organ-

 viding means through which bloc
 contacts may be expanded.  The
 centers have increased in num-

 and several have become more
 active.
 The greatest activity has
 taken place in Argentina, where
 the Argentine-Soviet Institute
 of Cultural Relations has opened
 even  new    branches outside
 Buenos Aires, bringing the to-
 tal of such branches to 11.
 The institute's lecture program
 has been intensified this year,
 and its showings of Soviet bloc
 films reportedly have increased

 interior.  New bloc binational

 NEW POLITICAL CRISIS THREATENS
 IN PAKISTAN OVER SUEZ
 Pakistani president Mirza's
 desire to join the Suez Canal
 Users' Association and Prime
 Minister Suhrawardy's unwill-
 ingness to do so may result
 in a dispute between the two
 men which could end in Suh-
 rawardy's dismissal or resigna-
 tion.
 Mirza only reluctantly
 accepted Suhrawardy as prime
 minister.  He has several times
 indicated his intentions to
 get rid of him if he fails to
 support a pro-Western policy.
 Mirza. seems inclined to press
 Suhrawardy to join the users'
 association and might take this
 opportunity to take drastic ac-
 tion against Suhrawardy.
 Suhrawardy's government
 has already publicly opposed the
 users' association.   Suhrawardy
 has also told the American am-
 bassador that while he did not
 denounce it during the second
 London conference to avoid
 embarrassing Pakistan's West-
 ern allies--his country would
 not associate-itself with the
 association under any circum-
 stances.
 the new prime minister
 faces a particularly tricky
 problem on Suez,  His pre-
 decessor, Chaudhri Mohammad Ali,
 was shouted off the platform at
 a public meeting a. month ago be-
 cause of Pakistan's pro-Western
 policy on Suez, and popular pro-
 Egyptian opinion has mounted
 since then.
 Suhrawardy probably feels
 that if  he gives in to Mirza
 and the West on the users'
 association, he will lose his
 popular support and become just
 another one of Pakistan's "pup-
 pet prime ministers."  Conse-
 quently,  if Mirza forces the
 issue, Subrawardy may resign
 instead of forcing Mirza to
 dismiss him.
 Since the Suhrawardy
 government constitutes the only
 representative political
 grouping now available in Paki-
 stan, his downfall would prob-
 ably mean the establishment
 of direct rule by Mirza with
 the backing of the army and
 civil service.

 JAPANESE POLITICAL DISPUTES
 OVER RELATIONS WITH USSR
 A new series of disputes
 and maneuvers among Japanese
 government and conservative
 party leaders has been touched
 off by Soviet premier Bulganin's
 ambiguously worded note to
 Japan's prime minister Hato-
 yama on 14 September that the
 USSR is willing to use Japan's
 "five points" as a basis for
 the normalization of relations.
 While a special emissary is now
 in Moscow to clarify the Soviet
 position, Japanese press and
 business community criticism
 of the Hatoyama government's
 ineptness has been mounting,
 and former prime minister
 Yoshida's followers are threat-
 ening to split the ruling
 Liberal-Democratic Party if
 Hatoyama goes to Moscow as
 planned in early October.
 The Japanese five-point'
 proposal envisaged an agreement
 calling for the termination of
 the state of war, an exchange
 of ambassadors, the immediate
 repatriation of Japanese detain-
 ees in the USSR, implementation
 of the fishery agreements, and
 the USSR's unconditional support
 for Japan's admission to the
 United Nations.   Japan also
 wants to continue the negotia-
 tions for the return of the
 Southern Kurils and to have
 Shikotan and the Habomai Is-
 lands turned back immediately.
 Official Japanese reaction
 to Bulganin's letter is that
 the Soviet position is too
 vague.   It apparently made no
 mention of the territorial is-
 sues and, moreover, did not
 give assurance that the USSR
 is ready to drop its insistence
 on the simultaneous accession
 of Japan and Outer Mongolia to
 the United Nations.  On 21
 September, Special Ambassador
 Shunichi Matsumoto was sent
 to Moscow to determine the
 Soviet position on these points.
 Business leaders who fi-
 nance the Liberal-Democratic
 Party have become impatient
 with the government's inability
 to conclude the negotiations
 with the USSR successfully.
 They regard Hatoyama's weak
 leadership as the primary diffi-
 culty and have demanded that he
 retire before further negotia-
 tions are undertaken.
 The Japanese press, which
 earlier had been instrumental
 in forcing the government to
 stop Foreign Minister Shigemit-
 su from signing away the disputed
 islands, now has objected to
 Hatoyama's trip until the So-
 viet position is clear and in
 agreement with Japanese demands.
 The press seems fearful that
 Hatoyama, given any room for
 negotiation, will be inveigled
 by the USSR into selling out
 Japanese interests.
 The anti-Hatoyama movement
 within the Liberal-Democratic
 Party is gaining strength, and
 224 of 423 party members in both
 houses of the Diet have support-
 ed the formation of the "Situa-
 tion Discussion Council," which
 has the avowed purpose of pre-
 venting Hatoyama's trip to Mos-
 cow and forcing his retirement.
 Hatoyama continues determined to
 make the trip and fulfill his

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 September 1956
 The Singapore government's
 move to suppress Communist ac-
 tivity in the British crown
 colony, which began on 18 Sep-
 tember, was well planned and
 deliberately executed.   In the
 initial action, seven Communist-
 front leaders were arrested and
 three organizations ordered
 dissolved.
 One of the groups was the
 3,000-member Chinese Middle
 School Students' Union, prob-
 ably the most thoroughly in-
 doctrinated front in the colony.
 It was banned on the grounds
 that although it had registered
 as a nonpolitical organization,
 it had "persistently flouted"
 its pledge to abstain from
 political activity.
 Chief Minister Lim Yew
 Hock says he intends to press
 his challenge and to eliminate
 SECRET
 as an effective political force
 the pro-Communist People's Ac-
 tion Party.  The Action Party
 has been the most vigorous
 political party in Singapore
 and the chief co-ordinating
 body for Communist activity.
 Lim set the stage for his crack-
 down on 6 September when he
 demanded a vote of confidence
 from the Legislative Assembly
 for his government's entire
 program, which specifically in-
 cluded the antisubversion cam-
 paign.
 With attention centering
 primarily on the negotiations
 with London for more independence,
 he won a unanimous vote of con-
 fidence and has since rejected
 a demand by the People's Ac-
 tion Party for a special as-
 sembly debate on the arrests,
 claiming that he already has
 clear-cut support for his actions.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 September 1956
 The People's Action Party
 and its affiliates were caught
 off guard by the government's
 sudden moves.        Reaction so far
 has involved a one-hour pro-
 test strike by the leftist Fac-
 tory and Shopworkers' Union on
 24 September and a "stay-at-
 school" strike by nearly 1,000
 Chinese students.
 Left-wing unions have
 threatened to use a "peaceful
 secret weapon," and various
 front organizations have ac-
 cused the government of arrest-
 ing "ardent" independence sup-
 porters and of being led by
 "colonialist stooges."  The
 People's Action Party has pub-
 licly limited itself to a
 statement that the government's
 action was "sudden and arbi-
 trary," giving rise to "grave
 concern," and that the party
 would investigate the matter
 and "pursue it to the end."
 Although at the moment it
 appears. unlikely that the Peo-

 a major showdown, the possibil-

 REUNIFICATION PROBLEMS OF THE
 ITALIAN SOCIALISTS
 Major difficulties still
 are likely to block early re-
 unification of the Socialists
 in Italy, despite recent public
 expressions of optimism by
 spokesmen of both the Democrat-
 ic .Socialist Party and the
 Nenni Socialists.
 The chief obstacles to
 the creation of a unified party
 are trade union problems, the
 Nenni Socialists' undemocratic
 internal organization, and
 their strong pro-Communist
 faction,,   The merger outlook
 is further complicated by re-
 ported opposition from the
 Nenni Socialist left wing in
 the face of the apparently
 favorable attitude of the Ital-
 ian Communists.
 Both Socialist parties call
 for a single labor union free
 from domination by any political
 SECRET
 party, but the Nenni Socialists
 endorse the Communist-controlled
 General Confederation of Labor
 as the basis for unity in the
 trade unions.  The Democratic
 Socialists, however, seem in-
 clined to compromise by post-
 poning this issue.
 In an obvious bid for
 Socialist: support, Giuseppe di
 Vittorio, the General Labor
 Confederation's secretary gener-
 al,                                                                declared in August his
 organization would be apoliti-
 cal.   According to a rumor re-
 ported in the Italian press of
 25 September, Di Vittorio may
 announce his resignation as
 president of the Communist-
 dominated World Federation of
 Trade Unions at that organiza-
 tion's congress now meeting in
 Sofia..   Such a move could be
 a Communist tactic to make the
 General Labor Confederation

 TURKISH PRIME MINISTER MOVES
 TO SUPPRESS OPPOSITION
 In the face of mounting
 economic difficulties, Prime
 Minister Menderes has insti-
 tuted increasingly authoritarian
 measures rather than agree to
 economic reforms.   He will
 and Pravda on 13 September       25X1
 carried summaries of a speech
 by Togliatti in which he said
 the Communists could not be op-
 posed to a restoration of
 Socialist unity, but warned that
 enemies of the working class
 were trying to win over the
 Socialists  to the anti-Communist
 front.   Moscow thus appears to
 be endorsing Togliatti's cau-
 tious attitude of approving
 Socialist reunification.   Nenni
 himself has said reunification
 would not impair and might bene-
 fit his party's relations with
 Communists.   The Communists may
 hope to exploit a merged Social-
 ist Party, even if an open break
 with Nenni results.
 The Nenni Socialist central
 committee is to meet from 27 to
 29 September to consider the
 unity question, and the Social-

 been the main factor in the
 government's decision to insti-
 tute controls over all means of
 public expression.   Menderes
 is committed to a continued
 high rate of industrial and
 agricultural expansion, al-
 though these policies have pro-
 duced a critical economic situ-
 ation, including a heavy foreign
 debt and trade deficit, sharp
 inflation and domestic short-
 ages.   An economic stabilization
 program which the prime mini.s-
 ter, agreed to reluctantly
 after a cabinet crisis in late
 1955 apparently has now been
 abandoned.   Menderes reportedly
 brought about the resignation
 of two key cabinet ministers
 responsible for carrying out
 the program so that he could
 appoint men personally loyal
 to him.
 The opposition Republican
 People's Party is exploiting
 the government's handling of
 the economic situation in its
 attack on the government.
 Menderes has responded by in-
 stituting repressive measures,
 reminiscent of the Ataturk era.
 With an overwhelming par-
 liamentary majority, Menderes
 has had little, difficulty in
 obtaining approval for laws
 restricting assembly, silencing
 press criticism of the govern-
 ment, and lifting the' parlia-
 mentary immunity of opposition
 deputies.
 Several High Court judges
 who were known to oppose the
 government have been retired,
 and newspaper editors have
 been arrested for "journalistic
 sabotage"--criticism of govern-
 ment officials or policies.
 An example of the operation of
 the press law is seen in the
 case now being tried in an
 Ankara court-of a 15-year-old
 newsboy, arrested for shouting
 the headline that the minister
 of finance had resigned.
 Opposition leader Kasim
 Gulek, who is already under a
 six-month suspended sentence
 for violating the law restrict-
 ing assembly, appears to be con-
 tinuing to try to goad the gov-
 ernment into further action
 against him.   It is not yet
 clear if his attempts at politi-
 cal martyrdom will win widespread
 public sympathy.
 The opposition parties--
 the Republican People's Party,
 the Republican Nation Party

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 September 1956
 PROSPECT OF
 LABOR UNREST IN SPAIN
 Spanish industrial workers
 may strike again shortly after
 1 October in protest against
 the meager wage raise which
 will be effective on that date.
 The steady rise in the cost of
 living during the past year is
 a source of mounting concern to
 labor, which blames the govern-
 ment for its precarious economic
 status.  Moreover, the workers
 still resent the harsh measures
 employed by the regime against
 the strikers in northern Spain
 last May.
 Although the upward trend
 of living costs leveled off
 somewhat during the summer, it
 will probably advance again in
 the autumn, particularly in
 view of last spring's wage in-
 crease and the salary raise
 granted on 1 June to civil serv-
 ants  and the armed forces.
 A 16-percent wage increase
 on 1 April brought walkouts in`
 northern Spain because the in-
 crease neither offset the rise
 in prices nor improved the liv-
 ing standard of low-income
 groups.  Labor had been led to
 expect a 30- to 60-percent
 increase, but in most cases the
 April hike amounted to only 6
 or 7 percent of take-home pay.
 The wage boost for industrial
 workers scheduled for 1 October
 amounts to an additional 6 per-
 cent.
 Labor resents the small
 contribution to the pay increase
 to be made by employers during
 a period of high profits for
 industry.  An additional irri-
 tant is the discrimination evi-
 dent in the considerable raise
 given civil servants, amounting
 to as much as 60 percent on the
 lowest salaries.
 Genuine economic relief
 would require the government
 to improve the workers' living
 conditions,. provide a more flex-
 ible wage policy, raise the
 minimum wage rates, and place
 adequate controls on prices.
 I The government, however, has
 not yet shown any intention of
 repealing the punitive measures
 taken in May against strikers
 which have deprived them of sen-
 iority rights and, in some cases,
 resulted in their transfer to
 other cities at lower pay.

 27 September 1956
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 PROSPECTS FOR THE MOLLET GOVERNMENT
 When the French National
 Assembly reconvenes on 2 Octo-
 ber, Premier Mollet will face
 mounting political opposition
 as a result of growing frus-
 tration over a number of do-
 mestic and foreign issues, any
 one of which could lead to
 Mollet's overthrow.  Despite
 the difficulties over Suez, his
 failure to achieve a settlement
 in Algeria, and strong infla-
 tionary pressures in the French
 economy,  Mollet will continue
 to press for enactment of a
 positive program.
 Parliamentary Picture
 Many deputies who
 voted Mollet's in-
 vestiture on 31 Jan-
 uary are now ready to
 risk his overthrow
 because of the dead-
 lock on an Algerian
 settlement and disil-
 lusionment and dis-
 couragement over the
 Suez crisis.  Many
 right and right-center
 deputies acquiesced in
 his minority govern-
 ment's program for
 social welfare, eco-
 nomic expansion and
 European integration
 only in the hope of
 seeing Mollet saddled
 with an unpopular settlement in
 Algeria.   Regardless of whether
 or not he gets a settlement
 there, the assembly is unlikely
 to continue subordinating every-
 thing else to this problem.
 Radical leader Mendes-
 France left the cabinet last May,
 and will probably become increas-
 ingly critical of the govern-
 ment's economic and social pol-
 icies.                     Some of Mollet's fellow
 Socialists are irritated at the
 slow pace of reforms in Algeria;
 and when the second London con-
 ference on Suez ended, one of
 his Gaullist ministers called
 on the cabinet to resign.  The
 center Popular Republicans are
 reported negotiating with the
 Socialists with an eye toward
 entering the cabinet.  This
 step would greatly strengthen
 Mollet's position and would
 make him less susceptible to
 pressure to rely on the Commu-
 nists, who backed him until the
 Suez issue arose, and who still
 seem eager to "co-operate" with
 the Socialists.
 While Mollet is under no
 strong domestic pressure to
 forge ahead on EURATOM and the
 common market, European in-
 tegration has broad
 Socialist backing, and
 the government seems
 prepared to press for
 simultaneous assembly
 approval of both.
 The authority of
 the regime may be
 threatened by antitax
 leader Pierre Poujade's
 call for a massive
 demonstration in mid-
 October in Paris to
 serve as the "legal
 parliament" of France.
 Poujade hopes to at-
 tract half a million
 adherents to the meet-
 ing, which apparently
 is to be his long-heralded States
 General.    Mollet may feel it
 necessary to prohibit this
 gathering because of the danger
 of violent countermanifestations.
 Despite unprecedented
 assembly support for the gov-
 ernment's strong position a-
 gainst Egyptian nationalization
 of the Suez Canal,  this issue
 may precipitate Mollet's over-
 throw.  The effect of the dead-
 lock on France's already tight
 budget is becoming increasingly

 apparent.  The requisitioning
 of commercial ships and the
 transfer of troops to Cyprus
 have already boosted expenses
 considerably, and any rise in
 oil prices would have an ad-
 ditional deleterious effect on
 the economy, particularly on
 the government's wage-price
 stability campaign.
 There is growing sentiment
 in France against military ac-
 tion in Egypt.   In general, the
 right. and right-center is less
 enthusiastic than the government
 on using force.  French disil-
 lusionment at the outcome of the
 second London conference has
 unleashed the first attacks on
 Mallet's Suez policy and is
 likely to lead to a bitter and
 prolonged debate.  The premier's
 failure to obtain a satisfactory
 solution undermined his prestige
 and may deal the final blow to
 France's position in North
 Africa.

 might be led to consider it.
 However, Mollet is in no po-
 sition to agree now to complete
 independence, the nationalists'
 goal.
 The impact of increased
 expenses resulting from the
 Algerian and Suez crises has
 forced the French economy from
 a period of price stability and
 economic growth to a period of
 strong inflationary pressures.
 The damage to agricultural
 production from-last winter's
 freezing weather, a major mil-
 itary effort imposed on a full-
 employment economy, increased
 wages and consumption, the ex-
 pansion of industrial production,
 and the effort to maintain a
 high level of investment have
 already brought. about an upward
 movement in prices and costs of
 production, speculation against
 the franc-", labor restiveness,
 and a deterioration in the
 French balance of payments.
 To contain the inflation-
 ary movement, the Mollet gov-
 ernment has instituted price
 controls and has been manipu-
 lating the price index to keep
 it below the point that would
 make a general wage increase
 mandatory.   In the fiscal sphere,
 the government reportedly intends
 to practice a policy of selective

 Labor Unrest
 25X1
 25X1
 While the fall tradition-
 ally is a time for working-
 class unrest, the non-Commu-
 nist labor federations do not
 seem inclined at the present
 to launch agitation that would
 cripple the government's
 stability program.   They seem
 temporarily mollified by.Mol-
 let's reaffirmation on 11 Sep-
 tember that the escalator wage
 law will be allowed to operate
 and by his promise to continue
 technical discussions of the
 wage-price problem, despite his
 firm opposition to a general
 wage increase.
 The Communist-dominated
 General Labor Confederation
 (CGT) offers the most serious
 threat to labor stability,
 but it has reacted relatively
 mildly.   In the mid-September
 discussions, it contradicted
 the government's analysis of
 inflationary pressures and
 announced its intention to
 agitate for a 15-franc  increase
 in the hourly minimum wage and
 replacement of the consumer
 price index with the budget in-
 dex as a more accurate reflec-
 tion-of the cost of living.
 Many non-Communist labor lead-
 ers also favor the latter move.
 Communist press comment indi-
 cates that the CGT intends to
 use protests and strike actions
 in the factories on the local
 level, with an appeal for the
 unity of workers, rather than
 1g1tation.
 PROSPECTS FOR THE SOCIALIST PARTY OF JAPAN
 The Japan Socialist Party
 won almost one third of the
 seats in the Japanese upper
 house elections in July.   In
 the more important and repre-
 sentative lower house elections
 in February 1955, the Socialists
 had garnered 29.2 percent of
 all votes cast to the conserva-
 tives' 63.2 percent.  The con-
 servatives, although down from
 .their postwar high in 1952 of
 66.2 percent, still hold ap-
 proximately two thirds of the
 seats in both houses of the
 Diet.
 Despite this disparity,
 there has been a discernible
 trend toward the Socialists
 since their postwar low in
 1949, when they received only
 13.5 percent of the vote.   The
 Socialists point out that at
 their present rate of growth
 of about 1,000,000 votes a
 year, their support should
 match that of the conservatives
 within three years.
 The conservatives have
 been considerably disturbed by
 this trend, however.   In calling

 for Prime Minister Hatoyama's
 early retirement recently, 90
 Japanese businessmen, described
 as the "pillars" of Japan's
 economy, were motivated by the
 fear that if new leadership
 were not provided soon, the
 Socialists would head the gov-
 ernment in Japan.
 Socialist optimism was
 given a boost by the results
 of a nationwide public opinion
 sampling by Tokyo's largest
 newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun,
 published on 7 September,  The
 poll found that 33 percent of
 those interviewed supported
 the conservatives while 30 per-
 cent favored the Socialists,
 a 6-percent drop and 4-percent
 gain, respectively, since No-
 vember 1955.
 Party Program
 The Socialists are active-
 ly moving to increase their
 following.    A campaign is
 under way to gain 100,000 new
 party members by the end of
 November and each Socialist
 officeholder has been assigned
 a quota to recruit.   The mem-
 bership drive aims at broaden-
 ing,the party's support beyond
 labor's ranks, with emphasis
 on new farmer and small entre-
 preneur members.
 At the same time, a "prac-
 tical" economic program--a five-
 year plan to begin in 1957--
 is to be mapped out by mid-Oc-
 The Socialists, as avowed
 "neutralists," have indicated
 they will still call for the
 return of Okinawa to Japan,
 and the early restoration of
 relations with the USSR and
 Communist China, and will op-
 pose American bases in Japan,
 nuclear weapons, a constitu-
 tional revision to "legalize"
 rearmament and the US-Japan
 Security Treaty.
 Views on US and Bloc
 The Socialists' domestic
 program emphasizes protecting
 "the people's livelihood" and
 safeguarding "human rights,"
 which particularly appeals to
 Japanese labor.   Their foreign
 policy, stemming from their
 "humanistic" attitudes, appeals
 to the widespread pacifist sen-
 timents among Japanese women,
 youth and intellectuals.   In
 practice, the Socialists oppose
 practically every American ob-
 jective in Japan and emphasize
 the necessity for "independence"
 from the United States.
 Most Socialists accept
 the leftist caricature o
 America.
 Pacifist and neutralist
 sentiment leads the Socialists
 to welcome the Communist "peace
 offensive," and they attribute
 America's "hard"policy to a
 "pathological" fear of Commu-
 nism.   One party leader says
 Socialist dislike of America
 springs from an inferiority
 complex resulting from the
 knowledge that Japan is depend-
 ent, on the United States and
 must cast its lot with America.
 Regardless of the reasons,
 the Socialists can be expected
 to continue vocal opposition to
 American policies, at least as
 long as they are outside the
 government.   Should the Social-
 ists themselves form the govern-
 ment, the responsibilities of
 office would force a more prac-
 tical consideration of politics.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUN"=
 27 September 1956
 The Socialists are split
 on their views of the Commu-
 nist bloc... A very small fac-
 tion sees the Communists as
 the "camp of peace."        The
 dominant group tends to equate
 the "sins" of capitalism and
 Communism--both are said to
 be systems in which "man ex-
 ploits man"--and to see social-
 ism as the middle road.  An-
 other relatively small faction
 is realistic in its appraisal
 of Communism and, while avoid-
 ing actions which could be in-
 terpreted as "pro-American,"
 recognizes the advantages
 accruing to Japan as a result
 of its ties to the West.
 Labor Support
 The Japanese labor move-
 ment is the main source of
 Socialist strength and, in
 the estimation of one high
 Socialist, delivered roughly
 one half of the 11, 200, 000
 Socialist votes in the recent
 upper house elections.   While
 this support is vital to the
 party, the drive to broaden
 the party's popular base re-
 flects concern that such sup-
 port will not be sufficient
 to bring the Socialists to
 power.
 In addition, labor's
 influence on Socialist policy
 has, in some cases, been embar-
 rassing.   In one instance,
 labor insisted that the Social-
 ists include provisions in a
 Socialist budget proposal for
 the payment of minimum wages
 even though it was known reve-
 nues were not available and
 that labor's objective was to
 dramatize its call for a na-
 tional minimum wage.  A party
 official said that although
 this action added substance to
 charges of Socialist "unreal-
 ism," the party had to include
 the provision for fear of
 losing labor votes in the next
 election.
 Labor's support may also
 complicate the Socialist stand
 vis-a-vis the Japan Communist
 Party.   The Socialists have
 maintained, since their merger
 in 1954, a clear distinction
 between themselves and the Com-
 munists.   They maintained this
 stand during the July election
 despite repeated Communist
 overtures for a "united front"
 and the temptation posed by a
 few more possible Socialist
 victories if Communist support
 were accepted.   Three prefec-
 tural parties did accept Com-
 munist support against the
 central leadership's advice.
 On the whole, the party has
 avoided becoming a Communist
 captive and the small pro-
 Communist group within the
 party has been virtually iso-
 lated.
 One of the best avenues
 for Communist influence on
 Socialist policy would seem to
 be through the labor movement,
 in which awareness of the dan-
 ger of Communist infiltration
 is not so strong.   Sohyo,
 Japan's largest labor federa-
 tion, showed signs of serious
 Communist infiltration at its
 convention in late August and
 adopted an action policy which,
 among other things, follows
 the line of the Communist-
 dominated World Federation of
 Trade Unions and calls for
 joint action with the Commu-
 nists in "nonpolitical" matters.
 Just what this will mean in
 practice is, as yet, unclear.
 That the Socialists will
 be able easily to break away
 from their espousal of labor's
 interests seems doubtful in
 view of the party's heavy de-
 pendence on labor.   The unions
 have demonstrated their ability
 to deliver votes and funds to
 the Socialists and, in the re-
 cent election, to elect labor-
 backed candidates. Of the
 Socialist Diet seats, almost
 one third ate held by former
 Sohyo members and 10 percent
 by former members of one union,
 the Communist-dominated Japan
 Teachers' Union.

 general is urging union mem-
 bers to join the party.   Modi-
 fications in the Socialist plat-
 form to gain wider appeal--
 for example, by revising the
 call for a national minimum
 wage, which small entrepreneurs
 find unpalatable--probably will
 be objected to by the labor
 element, however.
 In addition,  the Social-
 ist leadership itself is split
 on the-issue, with the Marxists
 favoring a labor-dominated pa.r-
 ty.   Serious attempts to weaken
 labor's influence, therefore,
 could precipitate an intra-
 party factional struggle which
 would be as likely to split the
 party as win it added support.
 In expanding their in-
 fluence among the farmers,  the
 Socialists are faced with the
 difficulty of breaking the
 association between Socialism
 and radicalism in the minds of
 many rural voters.  This belief,
 fostered by the prewar govern-
 ment, has not been weakened
 by Socialist-inspired riots in
 the Diet.

 Socialist Chances
 Socialist prospects for
 attaining power in the next
 few years remain limited, ex-
 cept in the case of a prolonged
 economic crisis, gross conserva-
 tive ineptitude,  or a major
 split in the conservative party.
 Public support of the party will
 probably continue to grow gradu-
 ally as the. Socialists exploit
 the labor field more intensely,
 "enlighten" more pacifist  wom-
 en  voters,  and hold the votes
 of intellectuals and youths,
 There are some signs that
 'the party is becoming increas-
 ingly mature and realistic on
 certain issues.   On the problem
 of restoring relations with the
 USSR, for example, the Social-
 ists have recently eased indis-
 criminate attacks on the govern-
 ment for failure to secure an
 "early settlement" and, for the
 moment at least, have agreed to
 co-operate with the Hatoyama
 administration in bringing
 about an agreement which does
 not sacrifice Japan's terri-
 torial claims permanently.
 While decrying "American inter-
 ference in Japan's internal af-
 fairs" during the debates on
 Japan's policy in the negotia-
 tions,Socialist secretary gen-
 eral Inijiro Asanuma even ad-
 mitted it might be proper to
 seek American views, "for ref-
 erence.  only."
 Socialist influence on
 Japan's national policy is like-
 ly to be somewhat greater than
 the party's vote-getting ability
 or Diet representation might
 indicate. The conservatives'
 fear of the Socialist "trend"
 has prompted them to appropriate
 certain Socialist campaign planks
 and to attempt to avoid creating
 clear-cut issues on others.   The
 conservative setbacks in the July
 election, following blatant at-
 tempts to rig the election mecha-
 nism against the Socialists, may
 make the conservatives more
 cautious in their efforts to
 contain the Socialists.
 In addition, the vocal in-
 tellectuals and much of the press
 are sympathetic with the Social-
 ists, and few conservatives have
 so far been willing to explain
 vigorously the rationale behind
 their willingness to see Japan
 go along with certain American
 policies,  This assures wide
 publicity, without refutation,
 of Socialist charges of "sub-
 servience" to America.   The
 political climate makes a
 showing of "independence" from
 America politically valuable,
 even to conservatives.
 Japan's basic alignment
 with the United States is not
 likely to be broken either by
 Socialist influence on a con-
 servative government or even by
 a Socialist government.  At the
 least, however, the Socialists
 can be expected to push to in-
 crease Japan's maneuverability
 in its international relations.

 In the face of the unex-
 pected popular reaction in
 Georgia to the attack on Stalin
 at the 20th Soviet party con-
 gress in February, de-Stalin-
 ization was delayed there but
 has now begun in earnest.  The
 effect of the incident on Geor-
 gian nationalism will probably

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 27 September 1956
 March Demonstrations
 The details of what took
 place during the four days of
 disorder in Tbilisi can now be
 pieced together
 The students went ahead
 with their plans to read poems
 and lay wreaths at Stalin's
 statue in Stalin Park.  The
 police apparently took no
 action.  An air of excitement
 developed because of the semi-
 illegal nature of the activity,
 and crowds drifted into the
 city from outlying towns.
 At the same time, resentment
 mounted as word leaked out of
 Khrushchev's secret speech at
 the party congress.
 Apparently there was no
 violence until 8 March, when
 students rioted through the
 town shouting anti-Soviet, anti-
 Russian slogans, smashing win-  25X1
 dows and overturning street- 25X1
 cars.  Other citizens jointed
 Although many of the dem-
 onstrators were undoubtedly
 motivated by genuine hero worship
 of Stalin, the prevailing senti-
 ment seemed to have been one of
 outraged national pride.  There
 are indications that over the
 past several years, Georgians
 have grown resentful at losing
 the prestige they had enjoyed
 under Stalin and his fellow
 Georgian, Beria.
 In an unusual gesture of
 deference to public opinion,
 the authorities on 8 March of-
 ficially authorized commemorative
 meetings, probably in the hope
 of ending the disorder.   Zarya.
 Vostoka, the Georgian party news-
 paper, appeared the next day
 with a front-page picture of
 Stalin and Lenin and an edi-
 torial commemorating Stalin's
 death.  The paper announced the
 scheduling of mass meetings
 that day in factories, schools
 and other institutions.  These
 moves did not placate the people.
 Disorders continued throughout

 from loudspeakers that people

 On the evening of 9 March,
 crowds gathered in Stalin Park
 shouting, "To the post office!"
 The idea reportedly was to send
 a telegram to Molotov and the
 United Nations protesting the
 denigration of Stalin and dis-
 criminatory treatment of
 Georgia.   Army troops, which
 had apparently been moved into
 the city the night before, were
 drawn up in front of the govern-
 ment buildings.   As the people
 converged on the post office,
 troops opened fire, first into
 the air and then into the
 crowd.   Reports of the number
 killed have ranged from 10 to
 100, with many others wounded.
 There apparently was no
 further violence.   More troops

 show of nationalism.         There
 was probably considerable re-
 luctance to push the campaign
 in the face of such opposition.
 It is probable, furthermore,
 that Georgian officials re-
 quested Moscow for permission
 to slow down the campaign to
 allow more time for propa-
 ganda groundwork.
 In the uneasy period that
 followed, the Georgian papers
 struck out against propaganda
 organizations, hooliganism,
 and "collective" cutting of
 courses on dialectical materi-
 alism.   They referred menac-
 ingly to "enemies of the peo-
 ple who are trying to weaken
 the friendship of people and
 restore bourgeois nationalism
 and national exclusiveness."
 Two Komsomol central committee
 secretaries and the first sec-
 retary of the Tbilisi city
 party committee were removed.
 The de-Stalinization cam-
 paign was virtually halted and
 praise for Stalin continued in
 the press.   In reporting the
 May Day parade in Tbilisi,
 Zarya Vostoka observed that
 demonstrators carried portraits
 of Stalin    which described him
 as "one of the most outstanding
 figures of the Communist move-
 ment"  and included a reference
 to a number of institutes named
 after him.   The press also re-
 ported that the Georgian govern-
 ment had received approval from
 Moscow to complete the construc-
 tion of a museum dedicated to
 Stalin.
 After publication of the
 central committee's resolution
 of 30 June, however, the de-
 Stalinization campaign was re-
 sumed in Georgia, probably as
 a result of impatience in
 Moscow over foot-dragging by
 Georgian officials.   In early
 August, P. V.  Kovanov,  a deputy
 head of the all-Union central
 committee's Department of
 Propaganda and Agitation, was
 .transferred to Georgia as party
 second secretary--the first non-
 Georgian to serve in the top
 leadership since the early
 thirties.
 During the first two weeks
 in August, an intensive propa-
 ganda campaign was launched with
 a series of articles in Zarya
 Vostoka which indicate tit the
 aim was to interpret the
 "evils" of the personality cult
 in terms of specific local
 problems.  The alarming extent
 of bourgeois nationalism in
 Georgia was the principal devi-
 ation blamed on the Stalin cult.
 The goal is to eliminate both
 deviation and its cause.
 The burden of blame was
 placed on Beria, but it was
 made clear that Stalin was re-
 sponsible for Beria's regime in
 Georgia.   The unpopular Beria
 image is thus being used as a
 means of discrediting the still
 revered Stalin.
 Because of the influence
 of Beria and Stalin, the arti-
 cles explained, a "barrier ex-
 isted between the Georgian
 leadership and the central
 committee" of the Sovie c Commu-
 nist Party,   and thus for many
 years Georgia remained outside
 the effective control of Moscow.
 As a result, "foreign, anti-
 party practices" sprang up, and
 literary works saturated with
 ultranationalistic, anti-
 Russian feeling were allowed to
 run into many editions.   His-
 torians, it was said, belittled
 the importance of the union of
 Georgia and Russia and concen-
 trated on the distant past.   No
 serious studies of problems of
 Marxist philosophy were published
 for ten years, and ideological
 indoctrination, particularly of
 the youth, was almost non-
 existent.
 Party boss Mzhavanadze ad-
 mitted at the party plenum in
 August that the "central com-
 mittee of the Georgian Commu-
 nist Party underestimated how

 deeply the Stalin cult had be-
 come rooted in the consciousness
 of the people of Georgia, or
 its excessive proportions and
 nationalistic character."  It
 "failed to give an adequate
 explanation to the people" or
 take any effective action.
 Although Mzhavanadze
 placed the blame on the Geor-
 gian central committee, it is
 clear that Moscow did not
 take a firm stand on what course
 should be pursued.   Georgian
 officials, lacking definite
 directives, perhaps disagreeing
 as to approach, and differing
 in their degree of enthusiasm
 for the de-Stalinization cam-
 paign, allowed the situation
 to drift, and this led to
 Moscow's action in early
 August.
 Moscow faces a real problem
 in the existence of strong na-
 tionalist sentiment in Georgia.
 Never far below the surface,
 this sentiment has now been
 aroused by a direct and open
 clash with Moscow.   Although
 the regime is apparently de-
 termined to employ every means
 to overcome this attitude, it
 will probably continue to be a
 source of trouble for some
 years to come.
