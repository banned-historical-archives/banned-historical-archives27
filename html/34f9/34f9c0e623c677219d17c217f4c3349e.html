 USSR: BREZHNEV REPORTS
 General Secretary Brezhnev opened the 25th
 Soviet party congress in Moscow on February 24
 before some 5,000 party delegates and 103
 delegations of communist and leftist parties from
 96 foreign countries-the largest domestic and in-
 ternational audience ever assembled at such a
 conclave. The congress, though a well-orches-
 trated ritual not expected to produce surprises,
 nevertheless serves to review the party's perform-
 ance since the last such session in 1971, and
 sets benchmarks and goals for the next five
 years. While Brezhnev will stay at the helm, the
 elections of the party's ruling bodies at the end of
 the meeting may provide glimpses of relative
 movement among the rest of the leadership.
 Brezhnev gave an impressive performance;
 his stamina, enunciation, and aura of command
 seemed better than at any time in the past two
 years, according to US embassy observers. He
 paid unusual attention to the foreign policy por-
 tion of his report, which was realistic and tough-
 minded in substance. His essential theme was
 continuity-that the USSR's detente policy has
 been successful and will continue into the future.
 Brezhnev pulled few punches regarding the
 "complications" of Soviet policy, particularly the
 difficulty detente has run into in the West. There
 were few aspects that he addressed in which he
 did not mention the negative side of the ledger.
 Brezhnev offered a measured assessment of
 relations with the US, balancing the ac-
 complishments of the past five years with
 reminders of problems clouding prospects for the
 future. The Soviet party chief cited a reduced
 danger of nuclear war as the "main outcome" of
 the "generally positive" development of relations
 in recent years. He rated the prospects for further
 bilateral progress, "provided realism prevails," as
 good.
 Brezhnev repeated the familiar Soviet com-
 plaint that "influential forces" in the US are seek-
 ing to hamper detente and derided the notion of
 a Soviet threat to the US. He gave no ground on
 Angola and even argued that it was US "interven-
 tion" there that had strained US-Soviet relations.
 His sharpest criticism was directed at
 "discriminatory" US trade measures.
 On SALT, Brezhnev pressed for implemen-
 ting the Vladivostok agreements of late 1974 but
 made no prediction on the outcome of the
 current negotiations. He attempted to portray the
 US as not fully committed to arms control because
 it rejected Soviet proposals to ban Trident, the B-I,
 and similar, unspecified Soviet systems. In like
 vein, he invited the US to join the USSR in not es-
 tablishing military bases in the Indian Ocean.
 Brezhnev's treatment of Peking was short and
 tough. He said almost nothing about bilateral
 relations and even omitted standard references to
 an eventual rapprochement, implying that the
 Chinese would have to make all the concessions.
 He went a step further in outlining the Maoist
 heresy, saying that it was no longer just "incom-
 patible" with Marxism-Leninism, but was now
 "hostile" to it.

 With respect to the rest of Asia, Brezhnev said
 the usual positive things about the "victory" in In-
 dochina, had many good words for India, and
 suggested that China has replaced the US as the
 main obstacle to better Soviet-Japanese relations.
 Europe
 Brezhnev's assessment of relations with the
 West European countries was generally positive,
 but far from euphoric. He spoke at some length
 about the contributions of the European security
 agreement, but without great enthusiasm. He
 pledged Soviet efforts to implement the agree-
 ment but alleged that the West is using it to make
 mischief in the "socialist" community.
 Brezhnev spoke at considerable length about
 MBFR, providing substantial details of the reduc-
 tion proposal presented by the Warsaw Pact on
 February 17. While expressing continued interest
 in reaching an agreement, he gave no hint of any
 willingness to modify the Pact's basic negotiating
 approach.
 notes Soviet leadership of the communist world.
 This clearly was meant as a retort to the French,
 Italian, and other parties that have been making
 increasing  efforts to emphasize  their
 "independence" of Moscow. Brezhnev also
 stated unequivocally that there can be no com-
 promise on views that contradict communist
 ideology, a probable reference to the French par-
 ty's abjuring the "dictatorship of the proletariat."
 The General Secretary indicated that Moscow
 intends to press ahead on the long-delayed Euro-
 pean communist party conference and even
 raised the idea of holding a world communist
 conference.
 On the controversial question of proper
 communist tactics, Brezhnev apparently
 attempted to keep both the hard and soft liners
 happy. Thus, he said that the "tragedy" in Chile
 should not be interpreted to mean that the
 peaceful route to revolution is not appropriate if
 conditions permit. Chile did demonstrate,
 however, that a revolution must know how to de-
 fend itself.
 In discussing the Middle East, Brezhnev in-
 troduced two long-dormant themes in an
 otherwise standard litany-
 @  He said a way should be found to
 end the arms race in the region, adding,
 however, that discussions on arms
 limitations could not precede a general
 settlement.
 ?  He said the UK and France could
 join the US and USSR as guarantors of any
 Middle East settlement. This may be an
 attempt to preclude having all the UN
 Security Council, including China, involved
 as guarantors.
 In domestic affairs, Brezhnev reasserted past
 policies, lauded leadership successes, and was low
 key in defending traditional ideological positions.
 He went into unusual detail about the activity of
 the Politburo and the party secretariat, focusing
 on difficult situations in which he had triumphed.
 Referring to the Central Committee meeting in
 May 1972, which approved a US-Soviet summit in
 Moscow despite events in Vietnam, Brezhnev
 hinted that there was opposition at this "turning
 point" and noted how correct the positive deci-
 sion proved to be. He also mentioned the Soviet
 agricultural difficulties of that year and his role
 and that of the party in overcoming many of
 them.
 Brezhnev gave considerable emphasis to
 "proletarian internationalism," a phrase that con-
 Brezhnev's review of economic performance,
 however, stressed themes that had been publicly
 aired before-a general disappointment in last

 year's results, especially in the agricultural and
 consumer sectors, and a promise to do better in
 the 1976-80 five-year plan period. He gave no
 evidence of new initiatives or changing priorities;
 instead, he re-emphasized modernization of
 plant, quality production, improved management
 and planning, better use of science and
 technology, and expansion of foreign trade.
 Brezhnev as usual took a centrist line on
 ideological matters that touch the ordinary
 citizen. He said detente requires more domestic
 vigilance and praised the secret police especially
 for countering hostile intelligence services. At the
 same time, he rioted that detente provides better
 conditions for spreading "socialist" ideas abroad,
 a theme reminiscent of his "victory through con-
 tacts" speech at Alma Ata in August 1973.
 He avoided criticizing the artistic intelligent-
 sia, praised their accomplishments, and warned
 against using "administrative methods," i.e., out-
 right repression, to deal with problems in this
 sphere. He also made a rare reference to the 20th
 party congress in 1956, the de-Stalinization con-
 gress, which led to the domestic "thaw" under
 Khrushchev. Lest he be misunderstood, however,
 Brezhnev rebutted domestic and foreign attacks
 on Soviet violations of human rights and, with
 domestic dissidents evidently in mind, labeled
 harmful anything that would weaken Soviet
 society.
 Finally, Brezhnev referred to the promised
 long-term (1976-90) plan and the new constitu-
 tion, saying that work was continuing on both but
 giving no deadline for completion.

 The congress has now settled into several
 days of "discussion" of Brezhnev's report, which
 was kicked off as tradition calls for by the party
 chiefs of Moscow, the Ukraine, Leningrad, and
 Kazakhstan. Interrupted only briefly by greetings
 from foreign delegates, the proceedings will give
 way next week to a report by Premier Kosygin on
 the five-year plan, followed by another discus-
 sion. Brezhnev will probably preside at the final
 session of the congress, where the results of the
 previous day's elections to the party's leading
 bodies are made public.
 As usual, Moscow has been spruced up for
 the congress, and most citizens including the
 delegates view the event as a festivity. Soviet
 authorities have taken steps, such as pre-emptive
 arrests, to keep Jewish activists and other dis-
 sidents out of sight through the congress, though
 apparently not on the scale of past congresses.
 Dissidents who remain at large are so far keeping
 their word              uring the meeting.
 USSR: ARMS TRANSFERS
 Over the past two decades, Moscow has
 successfully used military aid to expand its in-
 fluence in the Third World. Since 1956, the USSR
 has extended almost $15 billion in military
 hardware, support equipment, and ammunition
 to 38 third-world countries. More than 60 percent
 was provided in the 1970s as Moscow made
 available large quantities of advanced weapon
 systems, especially to the Middle East.
 Moscow has been willing to provide military
 equipment and training with a minimum of stated
 conditions and on attractive financial terms. It has.
 not turned down a single prospective arms client
 and has shown that it can move rapidly to exploit
 new  opportunities.  The  military  assistance
 program has enabled Moscow to establish a
 strong presence within recipient countries and
 given it an opportunity to influence the recipient
 through:
 ?  Reliance on the USSR for logistic
 support;
 ?  Use of military technicians as in-
 telligence operators; and
 ?  Use of training programs to in-
 troduce members of the recipient armed
 forces to Marxist-Leninist philosophy.
 Arab-Isaeli tensions, Indonesian territorial
 conflicts with the Dutch, Pakistan's disputes with
 India and Afghanistan, Nigeria's civil war, and
 North Yemen's conflicts with its neighbors and
 the UK are instances in which the arms supply
 program provided Moscow with an opportunity
 to establish positions of influence.
 Negotiating Procedures
 Negotiations between the USSR and the
 potential arms recipient normally start with visits
 by high dignitaries. During the discussions the
 Soviets set the political price for arms. With
 political matters resolved, the client's request is
 reviewed and both parties sign an agreement in
 principle. The review process includes a feasibility
 study of the client's economic, political, and
 military capabilities and provides the basis for ex-
 amining the client's request in detail.

 Although information on the Soviet review
 process is limited, we believe that several criteria
 affect the type and sophistication of equipment to
 be provided:
 ?  Political gains and consequences.
 ?  Availability of equipment from
 stockpiles.
 ?  Production schedules in light of
 Soviet and Warsaw Pact demands.
 ?  Soviet ability to provide technical
 support and training.
 In the case of the belligerent Arab states, external
 threat analysis and force comparability are also
 major factors.
 The USSR launched its military assistance
 program in 1955-initially using Czechoslovakia
 as an intermediary-when it began arms
 shipments to Egypt. We estimate that 85 percent
 of Soviet arms commitments had been delivered
 by the end of 1975. Deliveries averaged about
 $460 million annually during the late 1960s, then
 jumped to an average of $1.2 billion in the 1970s.
 Because the Soviet program is in part a
 response to available opportunities and i3 in-
 fluenced by the absorptive capacity of the
 recipients, the annual magnitude and direction of
 aid has been highly variable. Most commitments
 since 1966 reflect the continuing arms buildup in
 the Arab countries and new agreements with In-
 dia, Iran, and Libya. Egypt, India, Iraq, and Syria
 together have accounted for 65 percent of Soviet
 arms transfers since 1955. Five other coun-
 tries-Afghanistan, Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, and
 Libya-have received most of the rest.
 Soviet arms are priced lower than com-
 parable Western equipment. The list price
 appears to be based primarily on Soviet estimates
 of what the market will bear and averages 16 to 28
 percent below estimated US cost of production.
 The differences between Soviet list prices and es-
 timated US production costs are largest for newer
 and more advanced equipment. Recent informa-
 tion indicates that Moscow is raising the prices on
 some equipment.
 Moscow has generally sold its arms at
 favorable terms. Payment usually has been over 8
 to 10 years, after a grace period of 1 to 3 years, at
 2- to 2.5-percent interest. Moreover, the USSR has
 been willing to accept payment in commodities
 or local currency and has frequently reduced or
 postponed payments when the recipient was un-
 able to meet them.
 Discounts from list price-averaging about 40
 percent over the last two decades but dropping to
 less than 20 percent in the 1970s-are an intrinsic
 feature of the Soviet arms program. Discounting is
 probably determined on the basis of a client's
 ability to pay as well as political considerations.
 Afghanistan, for example, has received discounts
 approximating 75 percent, while Iraq has received
 about a 30-percent discount and Nigeria none.
 Cash sales have accounted for an increasing
 share of Soviet arms exports in recent years. They
 made up only 5 percent of total agreements in
 1955-69, jumping to 15 percent during the 1970s.
 The major cash clients are Libya and Nigeria.
 Spare parts and ammunition purchased outside a
 general agreement are usually handled as cash
 sales.
 Modern Equipment Featured
 The USSR has been the most accommodating
 of the major arms suppliers in providing modern

 to-surface missiles (1973) to third-world arms in-
 ventories.
 Moscow could easily increase exports of a
 wide variety of equipment. There is a surplus of
 arms production capacity, and production on
 current lines could be increased almost im-
 mediately by employing a second shift. Large
 quantities of reserve surplus equipment are also
 available.
 During the 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars
 the Soviets encountered difficulties in meeting
 client demands. In an attempt to maintain the
 flow of supplies-particularly tanks-equipment
 was stripped from Soviet units and sent to the
 Middle East. Soviet armed forces' reserve stocks
 of ammunition and spares may also have been
 tapped. On these occasions, Moscow successfully
 pressured its East European allies to make equip-
 ment available to the Arab countries.
 Arms exports have given Moscow con-
 siderable influence and leverage in the Third
 World. Soviet support of nationalist governments
 has contributed to the weakening or elimination
 of Western influence in many countries. Con-
 comitantly, Soviet influence in the Middle East,
 South Asia, and North Africa has expanded
 significantly. A number of countries-notably
 Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Somalia, South
 Yemen, and Syria-are largely equipped with
 Soviet weaponry and are dependent on the USSR
 for logistic and technical' support.
 Through its military technical assistance-in
 conjunction with general technical assistance and
 academic training-the USSR has exposed many
 of the nationals of these countries to Soviet ideas
 and techniques. Moreover, it has established im-
 portant relationships with military leaders, as well
 as junior officers who in the future may hold key
 government positions.
 While Moscow has not used its military
 assistance program to acquire formal base rights,
 it has obtained a variety of operating privileges. It
 has acquired the use of the ports of Alexandria in
 Egypt and of Latakia and Tartus in Syria to support
 its Mediterranean fleet operations. Port facilities
 in Berbera, Somalia, and in Umm Qasr, Iraq, have
 enabled the Soviet fleet to operate more ef-
 ficiently in the Indian Ocean. Moscow has ap-
 parently used military aircraft landing rights in
 Guinea, Somalia, and India for air and naval in-
 telligence operations.
 Moscow has gained some economic advan-
 tages from the program. Arms repayments have
 given the Soviets access to long-term commodity
 commitments. Most important are the natural gas
 arrangements with Afghanistan. The arms supply
 relationship may also lead to oil supply
 arrangements with Iraq and Libya. A few clients
 pay for their arms in hard currency.
 Moscow will likely continue to view its arms
 transfer program as a major foreign policy tool.
 The program's relatively small cost to the Soviet
 economy and high political payoff have been
 proved over time.
 The impact of the Soviet military assistance
 program, however, has not been completely
 positive from the Soviet point of view. Soviet
 military support for leftist regimes has frequently
 alienated  more  conservative  antagonists.
 Moscow's cool relations with the Shah and
 current difficulties with Morocco are cases in
 point. The program has also led to demands for
 increased support that the Soviets would just as
 well have avoided. Soviet clients, in turn, have
 become disillusioned when Moscow has not
 offered the types and quantities of equipment
 they thought they needed. Furthermore, the
 overbearing manner of Soviet advisers has
 repeatedly triggered resentment, and Soviet
 attempts to manipulate delivery schedules and
 shipments of spare parts for political purposes
 has often been a source of friction. In the case of
 Egypt,  unhappiness with Moscow's military
 assistance was a major factor leading to the ouster
 of thp Sovip- _rrl~ ry presence in 1972.

 CEMA: LOOKING TO THE WEST
 The Soviet-dominated Council for Mutual
 Economic Assistance made a bid to enlarge its
 role in European economic affairs last week by
 presenting the draft of an "umbrella" coopera-
 tion agreement to the European Community.
 Initial EC reaction has been largely negative,
 suggesting that any accord will come only after
 lengthy, difficult negotiations.
 Under the terms of the CEMA draft, the EC
 and CEMA would:
 ?  establish official relations and set up
 a mixed commission;
 ?  put trade on a most-favored-nation
 basis and eliminate some non-tariff barriers;
 ?  cooperate directly in such technical
 areas as standards, the environment,
 statistics, and economic forecasting; and
 ?  agree to extend credits at the most
 favorable rates.
 The proposal would allow individual East
 European states to negotiate directly with the EC
 both in implementing this agreement and on
 other issues. This is designed to accommodate EC
 and Romanian objections that CEMA might
 become the sole conduit for the CEMA countries'
 contacts with the EC.
 In return for this concession, the Soviets are
 clearly seeking EC acknowledgement that CEMA
 has a role to play in trade relations between
 CEMA and EC countries-without, however,
 spelling out the nature of that role. The proposal
 also tries to undercut the EC's common commer-
 cial policy by proposing that individual EC coun-
 tries be allowed to deal directly with CEMA and
 individual CEMA countries.
 The Soviets are calling the proposed agree-
 ment part of the bridge-building process en-
 visioned by the Helsinki accord, hoping thereby
 to make an outright EC rejection more difficult
 and to gain propaganda advantage on the CSCE
 implementation issue.
 The EC finds major parts of the CEMA draft
 unacceptable. The EC is unlikely to accept any
 deal that does not respect the Commission's sole
 competence in trade matters. The EC may try to
 underscore this point by announcing the
 already-planned trade talks with Peking, which
 has not questioned the Commission's mandate.
 The EC also could not accept the elimination
 of all restrictions on trade, although it would
 probably be amenable to the gradual elimination
 of quantitative  restrictions on imports.
 Nevertheless, it would like to regularize relations
 with the CEMA countries and can be expected to
 probe Moscow's intentions. The Foreign
 Ministers' Council will take up the matter next
 week.
 CEMA's International Investment Bank is
 reportedly arranging a $600-million Eurodollar
 loan to be managed by Dresdner Bank of West
 Germany. The loan, which the bank hopes to
 complete by mid-1976, would be the largest single
 Communist borrowing to date. CEMA obtained a
 $350-million Eurodollar credit last October.
 The loans are needed to finance construction
 of a natural gas pipeline being built from Oren-
 burg in the USSR to Eastern Europe. The East
 European CEMA countries, as part of their con-
 tribution to construction of the pipeline, have
 agreed to provide hard currency funds to the
 Soviet Union through the CEMA Bank. The
 Soviets are using the money to buy pipe, com-
 pressors, and other equipment from the West.
 Bank officials have said that they will borrow $1.3
 billion on the Eurodollar market for this purpose,
 implying that some $350 million more will be
 sought. The bank, in fact, has tentative plans to
 negotiate another loan of $200-300 million late
 this year.
 The International Investment Bank may have
 been encouraged to seek such a large loan at this
 time by the success it had with the October loan,
 originally set at $240 million and subsequently

 oversubscribed. The previous credit carried an in-
 terest rate of 1.25 percent over the London Inter-
 bank Offer Rate and a five-year repayment
 period. The present loan will be a six-year credit
 with an interest rate spread of from 1.25 to 1.375
 percent over the London Interbank offer rate.
 Colombia is negotiating an economic
 cooperation agreement with CEMA, according to
 a Colombian Foreign Ministry official. An agree-
 ment with Colombia would be CEMA's fourth
 bilateral accord with a non-communist country. It
 now has agreements with Finland, Iraq, and Mex-
 ico.
 The agreement-to be signed before the end
 of the year-would be largely for show. Moscow
 views expanded CEMA ties as a means to
 demonstrate that the organization is more than a
 Soviet-dominated group oriented toward Eastern
 Europe and to support the argument that CEMA
 should be considered an equal of its rival, the EC.
 The Colombians view an agreement with
 CEMA as an opportunity to show that they will
 not be limited solely to a Latin American
 economic grouping. At the same time, Colombia
 is expanding its bilateral economic ties with in-

 ICELAND: PONDERING THE NEXT MOVE      25X1
 The Icelandic government, which broke
 relations with London on February 23, continues
 to ignore efforts to find a peaceful solution to the
 cod war with the UK. Despite attempts to get the
 feuding parties back to the bargaining table,
 Reykjavik has given no sign that it is ready to
 resume talks.
 Prime Minister Hallgrimsson's faction-ridden
 coaltion won a vote of confidence on Tuesday
 when the Icelandic parliament supported his
 handling of the cod war thus far by a vote of 41 to
 18. The vote split along government-opposition
 lines, suggesting that internal differences over the
 issue are not so great that the coalition members
 are ready to end cooperation.
 The vote was clearly a victory for
 Hallgrimsson and the uncompromising attitude
 he has taken toward the British.. The governing
 parties may still disagree over the next step,
 however, and the increase in incidents at sea this
 week between Icelandic patrol boats and British
 frigates would probably not allow Reykjavik to
 take new diplomatic initiatives at this time. For
 their part, the British protection vessels have also
 become more aggressive and London has dis-
 patched another frigate to the area. The earlier
 threat to withdraw from NATO was tempered by
 Hallgrimsson, who told parliament that the ques-
 tion of Iceland's membership is solely related to
 defense interests, not the fishing issue. Barring a
 serious incident involving the loss of life or a ship,
 the government has numerous steps it can take to
 show its displeasure with NATO short of pulling
 out of the Alliance.
 A clue to Reykjavik's strategy toward a settle-
 ment with the British appeared in Hallgrimsson's
 remarks during the debate on the confidence
 motion. He implied that his government expects
 the UN Law of the Sea Conference this spring to
 vindicate the Icelandic position on a 200-mile
 limit. By winning the vote of confidence,
 Hallgrimsson may still be able to agree to another
 round of talks, especially since the British have
 again reduced their demands. The attitude
 reflected in the debate, however, suggests
 ] Iceland would be unlikely to concede much, and
 any agreement would probably not extend much

 beyond the UN conference expected to end in

 The Hallgrimsson government also is plagued
 with the largest general strike in Icelandic history.
 The strike, which has idled more than half of the
 country's work force of 80,000 since February 16,
 was joined by other unions this week.
 Negotiations between employers and union
 leaders continue, but the fishing industry has
 already suffered considerable economic loss due
 to the idling of the fishing fleet. Strikers are
 attempting to involve the US in their dispute and

 manned Keflavik base. US authorities in Iceland
 will protest the move        celandic govern-
 ment.
 ITALY: COMPROMISE BUYS TIME
 Economic matters will be the central
 parliamentary issue now that Aldo Moro's minori-
 ty Christian Democratic government has won its
 vote of confidence. Severely diluted by com-
 promises, Moro's economic stabilization program
 seeks to reduce inflation, shield jobs, and halt the
 erosion in the value of the lira. Although it will
 probably be further weakened by amendments
 proposed during the debate, the program is ex-
 pected to be approved if the Socialists and
 Republicans keep their promises to abstain in the
 final voting.
 The stabilization program is intended to lay
 the groundwork for economic recovery by get-
 ting Italians to live closer to their means. Over the
 past few years, the government and its agencies
 have been borrowing to cover current spending
 as well as investment. Treasury borrowing re-
 quirements rose from 8 percent of gross national
 product in 1972 to nearly 15 percent last year, the
 highest level in Europe. The escalation in public
 financial needs occurred, moreover, at a time
 when businessmen were encountering cash flow
 problems resulting from an explosion in
 wages-up 80 percent in the last three years. Part-
 ly as a result of these factors, investment slumped,
 productivity flagged, and inflation averaged 19
 percent in 1974 and 17 percent in 1975.
 To reduce public borrowing requirements,
 the new program proposes improved revenue
 collection, curbs on public spending, and some
 rate adjustments for public utilities. The second
 major element in the program is a compromise
 effort to control the rise in wages and incomes.
 Top managers might see their salaries frozen, and
 high-level government workers could have their
 wage increase withheld this year. All other
 workers, many represented by strong labor un-
 ions, escaped wage controls of any kind.
 The stabilization plan comes on the heels of
 several measures to discourage capital flight and
 soak up excess liquidity. The political crisis and
 shaky economic conditions had led to a 15 per-
 cent slide in the value of the lira over the last
 month. The discount rate has been raised two
 percentage points-to 8 percent-and the gov-
 ernment issued a decree reducing bank lend-
 ing power by $1 billion. Rome also stiffened
 controls over export. payments and import in-
 voices in an effort to limit illegal currency out-
 flows. On March 1 the Bank of Italy will resume
 support of the lira in international markets.
 The economic plan will be most valuable for
 its psychological effect. Given the traditional
 resilience of the economy even in the face of
 gross mismanagement, the new government with
 a new program should prop up the low level of
 confidence at home and abroad. The stabilization
 program nonetheless is far too compromised by
 attempts to buy Socialist support and to avoid
 labor union retaliation-ironically still a live
 possibility. We expect the rate of inflation to drop
 some, but still average a worrisome 15 percent
 this year.
 The budget measures alone will not ap-
 preciably cut the massive borrowing needs of the
 Italian government. Promises to improve tax
 collection and curb spending growth have
 seldom materialized in the past; implementation
 of such measures by a weak minority government
 is particularly suspect. Treasury borrowing needs
 are apt to remain close to last year's record high.
 The incomes policy is likewise too watered
 down to be effective. Upper-income workers ac-
 count for only a small part of industrial wage

 costs. More important, 10 million workers-in-
 cluding 80 percent of those in industry and 70
 percent of civil servants-will have their contracts
 negotiated during the next six months. Most
 observers expect unions to resist government
 jawboning and to secure hefty pay raises.
 The cheaper lira will also contribute to infla-
 tion by raising the price of imported goods. Loss
 d
 in purchasing power of the lira alone is expecte
 to raise domestic prices by 3 to 5 percent.
 SPAIN: WOOING CATALONIA
 King Juan Carlos appears to have made a
 favorable impression during his official visit to
 Catalonia February 16-21. He used the occasion to
 announce some modest measures to deal with
 regional pressures and Catalan complaints of
 neglect by Madrid.
 Beginning with his arrival statements, which
 included a paragraph in the Catalan language, the
 King played the role of a politician bent on selling
 himself. Although Catalan leaders obviously feel
 that Madrid has proceeded too slowly with
 political reforms, the local populace responded
 enthusiastically. Stressing the theme of Catalan
 aspirations, the president of the Barcelona
 assembly said in his welcoming remarks that the
 visit came at a time when the Catalans are hopeful
 of having their "cultural, administrative,
 economic, and political personality recognized."
 In a religious service at the Monserrat abbey-the
 Catalan  national religious shrine-the abbot
 delivered a sermon in Catalan which dealt with
 the need for national reconciliation in peace,
 amnesty, and mutual understanding.
 The visit to Catalonia took place against a
 background of widespread labor unrest, notably
 in the construction industry and among municipal
 employees. The national government responded
 on February 18 by placing striking traffic police
 and firemen in Barcelona under military jurisdic-
 tion, employing the same tactics that were
 successful against striking railroad workers and
 Madrid postmen a month ago. The situation calm-
 ed after police broke up several demonstrations,
 gP
 Juan Carlos speaking at the start of his. Barcelona tour
 but some 150,000 still remain on strike in
 Catalonia.
 In a move to demonstrate the government's
 interest in Catalonia, the King presided at a
 special cabinet meeting in Barcelona on February
 20. The cabinet appointed a commission to con-
 sider establishing a special administration for the
 four Catalan provinces, a cautious gesture toward
 some form of home rule. The commission will be
 dominated by government officials, however, and
 the gestures toward autonomy are unlikely to
 satisfy the opposition parties who want to regain
 the degree of federalism the region enjoyed un-
 der the Second Republic in the 1930s.
 The cabinet also took, immediate steps to
 decentralize power by transferring some
 decision-making to local representatives of the
 ministries of public works, industry, education,
 labor, and housing. The government announced
 that Catalonia will receive $1.3 billion in funds for
 public works projects.
 The government also acted to remove some
 of the irritants in relations between Madrid and
 the various regions by authorizing birth
 registrations in any of the regional languages and
 released a progress report on teaching of Catalan
 in the public schools. The government took the
 first step in this direction last November when it
 recognized the various regional languages as
 national languages for use in all but official
 deliberations, th   removing earlier restrictions
 on use in public.                           25X1

 CYPRUS: NO BREAKTHROUGH
 The fifth round of the current cycle of
 Cypriot intercommunal talks ended in Vienna last
 Saturday without producing a breakthrough on
 major issues. Unlike the last session, however, the
 atmosphere was reasonably positive.
 The negotiators, Greek Cypriot parliamentary
 leader Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
 Denktash, had been committed to an exchange of
 views on all issues at stake-including the
 territorial question, which the Turkish Cypriots
 had refused to consider in earlier rounds. These
 issues were discussed, although the five-day
 meeting produced few concrete results. UN
 Secretary General Waldheim did succeed in
 securing agreement on a compromise formula for
 future negotiations, which commits both sides to
 exchange written proposals on pending issues
 through Waldheim's special representative in
 Nicosia within the next six weeks.
 The generally positive atmosphere at the talks
 in large part reflected the Turkish desire to deflect
 international pressure and the Greek realization
 that they must maintain contact with Denktash
 and the Turks if they are to recoup any of their
 losses. Both sides have sought to cast a positive
 light on the proceedings. Clerides, for example,
 was quoted in the Viennese press on Sunday as
 saying that this round was the most successful of
 any held so far. The negotiators will meet again
 with Waldheim in Vienna in May to establish
 agreements in principle on the various issues. The
 texts then will be referred to mixed committees in
 Cyprus to iron out details.
 Earlier attempts to shift the negotiations to
 Cyprus have failed, however, and-the positive
 atmosphere in Vienna notwithstanding--the
 prospects for progress in the period before the
 next  round  in Vienna are poor. Mutual
 suspicions, the reluctance of either side to be the
 first to make concessions, and domestic political
 considerations-particularly on the Turkish
 side-will probably prevent the presentation of
 reasonable proposals that could form         or
 successful negotiations.

 JAPAN: THE LOCKHEED CONNECTION
 13
 The Miki government is working overtime to
 dispel public suspicion that a coverup of the
 Lockheed bribery scandal is under way.
 Last week's Diet hearings failed to shed new
 light on the identities and roles of Japanese of-
 ficials allegedly involved. This week the govern-
 ment took several new steps to give the
 appearance of forward movement:
 ?  Both houses of the Diet unanimously
 passed resolutions calling for US release of
 relevant Lockheed data, and scheduled ad-
 ditional hearings.
 ?  Prime Minister Miki sent a personal
 letter to President Ford calling for full US
 cooperation in clearing up the scandal.
 ?  Miki also announced he was con-
 sidering sending a special envoy to the US,
 possibly Foreign Minister Miyazawa, to
 follow up the request for data.
 ?  Police and tax authorities launched a
 joint investigation of the case by staging
 raids at 26 locations to obtain evidence.
 There are mixed emotions throughout
 Japanese political circles on whether to pursue
 the investigation to the point of revealing names
 of those officials allegedly involved. Uncertainty
 over what names might emerge and concern that
 the scandal might not be confined to the
 Lockheed affair are complicating factors. Most
 members of the ruling Conservative Party ap-
 parently would prefer to limit the investigation,
 but Miki may not be averse to full disclosure. He
 presumably was not involved in the payoffs and
 may believe that some of his rivals in the par-
 ty-possibly including former prime minister
 Tanaka-could be directly implicated.
 Defense Complications
 The Lockheed scandal has also forced Tokyo
 to review plans for acquiring a new antisubmarine
 warfare aircraft. The choice of a new ASW aircraft
 Japanese police search for evidence in connection with
 has been a major issue facing Japanese defense
 planners since the late 1960s.
 Until the Lockheed revelations earlier this
 month, Tokyo was well on the way to announcing
 its official choice of the Lockheed P3C aircraft
 sometime later this year and hoped to begin
 deployment in 1978. The scandal has rein-
 vigorated the lobbying campaign of the domestic
 arms industry, which has begun again to press
 hard for domestic development despite the
 government's preference for the superior US air-
 craft.
 Even before the scandal, the Japanese were
 exploring the possibility of domestic production,
 but such a decision now would not allow them to
 meet the 1978 deadline and would also be much
 more expensive. Indeed, Japanese plans for
 developing a patrol aircraft similar to the P3C

 reportedly have been pushed back another year
 for lack of sufficient funding.
 Tokyo has been careful to avoid any implica-
 tion that the P3C deal has been killed outright; it
 will probably be some time before the govern-
 ment announces its final decision. Given the
 problem surrounding domestic production,
 Tokyo may again pursue the P3C, but probably
 through a government-to-government arrange-
 ment rather than through direct dealings with
 Lockheed. Antisubmarine warfare is the major
 focus of Japanese naval operations, and any ap-
 preciable delay in acquiring the next generation
 of ASW aircraft could seriously set back Japan's
 '
 rv   modernization  program.

 JAPAN: NEW EXPORT DRIVE
 Japanese firms are taking advantage of
 economic recovery abroad with another export
 push. Tokyo sees foreign sales as an important
 means of bolstering domestic output and demand
 at a time when recovery at home is flagging.
 Japanese industries have set ambitious export
 targets for this year. The auto industry hopes to
 boost its overseas sales by at least 20 percent, and
 steel wants a 5- to 10-percent increase, following a
 12-percent decline last year. Sales of complete in-
 dustrial plants to communist and OPEC countries
 are expected to boost machinery exports
 significantly. Exporters of chemicals and in-
 termediate textile products expect only small
 gains, while some exports, such as ships and fer-
 tilizer, will decline.
 If targets are met, export volume will increase
 10 percent in 1976, double the expected growth in
 world trade. Volume is already on a sharp upward
 trend, gaining 20 percent since its low in June
 1975. Most of the increase occurred in the fourth
 quarter of 1975 and has been concentrated in the
 US market. Gains in the US market this year are
 likely to be 9 percent, while increases of 15- to
 20-percent are anticipated in the expanding com-
 munist and OPEC markets. OPEC countries now
 take 15 percent of Japan's exports, up from 5 per-
 cent in 1973.
 Many Japanese industries are slashing export
 prices to help strengthen their world market posi-
 tion, although production costs in most industries
 are rising. Exporters are willing to see profit
 margins shrink in order to accelerate the export
 push and maintain production levels. Most major
 industries now export one fourth or more of their
 output.
 The government is moving on a number of
 fronts to assist Japanese exporters. Tokyo is plan-
 ning to increase government sponsored loans for
 overseas sales this year by a record 80 percent.
 Interest rates on certain official credits are also
 being shaved. In another move to protect export
 gains, Tokyo is intervening to keep the yen from
 appreciating above 300 to the dollar.
 The government, like industry, sees export
 growth as essential to even moderate economic
 recovery. In the second half of 1975, growth in ex-
 port volume accounted for nearly 40 percent of
 the estimated 3.5 percent gain in gross national
 product. The proportion is likely to remain high
 in the first half of 1976, when gross national
 product is expected to             ual rate of 4
 percent.
 CHINA: LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE CONTINUES
 In his speech on February 22 welcoming
 former president Nixon, acting Premier Hua
 Kuo-feng became the first Chinese official to
 comment publicly on the current leadership
 struggle. Hua's remarks were relatively mild and
 omitted any reference to "unrepentant capitalist

 LAOS: ASKING FOR HELP WITH BANGKOK
 The Lao are now asking Asian and third world
 countries to intercede with Bangkok to reopen
 more of the border with Laos. While it is unlikely
 that any of the governments will approach
 Bangkok, the Lao probably hope the initiative will
 put Thailand on the defensive and create indirect
 pressure for reopening the border. A Lao official
 made similar overtures to several non-communist
 diplomatic missions in Vientiane last December
 when the entire border was closed.
 The border restrictions are causing the Lao
 severe economic difficulties, and they are also
 asking the countries for humanitarian aid. Vien-
 tiane is clearly willing to accept badly needed
 economic assistance from any quarter, but con-
 tinues to rely on its communist allies for the bulk
 of foreign aid. Late last month a Lao delegation to
 Moscow signed an aid agreement with the USSR
 for 1976-77. Shortly thereafter, in an apparent ef-
 fort not to slight Peking, the Lao held a ceremony
 for the turnover of Chinese aid, much of which
 had been Previously announced.

 Bulgaria and Albania.
 Lao-Thai border talks are stalled. The Lao fail-
 ed to respond to an offer by Thai Foreign Minister
 Chatchai to visit Vientiane earlier this month and
 are still insisting that the Thai reopen the entire
 border before new talks begin. Moreover, Lao
 Prime Minister Kaysone Phomvihan has hinted
 that any substantial negotiations cannot be held
 until after the Thai elections in early April.
 The Thai also apparently see little reason to
 negotiate seriously with the Lao until after the
 elections. Aware that any concessions to the Lao

 SPANISH SAHARA: NEW MASTERS
 Spain's role as co-administrator of Spanish
 Sahara under the tripartite agreement it conclud-
 ed with Morocco and Mauritania formally ends
 on February 28. The legal status of the territory
 remains a contentious issue, however, as Spain in-
 sists that its transfer of administrative control does
 not resolve the question of sovereignty. Algeria,
 which has rejected the tripartite agreement en-
 tirely, continues to  demand a referendum on
 self-determination and to support Polisario Front
 guerrillas seeking independence for the territory.
 Morocco has set up an extensive ad-
 ministrative apparatus to demonstrate its control
 as Spain completes its withdrawal in the Sahara.
 After February 28, Morocco will divide the
 northern Sahara into two provinces; the ad-
 ministrative center along the coast will be El
 Aaiun, while the northeastern portion will be
 governed from Semara. The Mauritanians will ad-
 minister their southern sector from
 Dakhla-formerly Villa Cisneros.
 Spain has consistently maintained that the
 sovereignty issue can only be decided in "con-
 sultation" with the people of Spanish Sahara.
 Although the tripartite agreement provided for
 such consultations through the territorial general
 assembly, a Spanish official recently indicated
 Madrid no longer supports this approach. The of-
 ficial attributed the change to the lack of provi-
 sion for a UN role and to Rabat's selection of
 tribal leaders loyal to Morocco to replace the
 considerable number of assembly members who
 joined the Polisario Front. The official did not
 elaborate on how the will of the Saharans should
 now be determined.
 This week, Morocco, which had argued
 earlier that the Saharans were consulted via the
 territorial assembly last November, called a
 special meeting of the assembly for February 26 to
 "express the will of the people." Rabat is now in-
 sisting that this session of the assembly will meet
 the requirements for consultations called for in
 the resolution adopted by the UN General
 Assembly last December that in effect endorsed
 the tripartite agreement. In an obvious public
 relations maneuver, assembly members "outside
 the Sahara"'-a reference to those members who
 defected to the Polisario Front-were invited to
 participate in the session.
 Algerian pressure on Spain is largely respon-
 sible for Madrid's second thoughts about the con-
 sultation process. Earlier this month, Algiers sent
 messages to Spain and the UN laying out its case
 that Spain cannot avoid its legal responsibility as
 the administering state of a non-self-governing
 territory.
 The Algerians want to delay international
 recognition of the Moroccan-Mauritanian
 take-over of the Sahara by reopening the Sahara
 dispute at the UN. A UN envoy recently visited
 the Sahara and has apparently submitted his fact-
 finding report to Secretary General Waldheim.
 Although the envoy's mission was limited in

 scope, Algiers will try to exploit his findings to
 push once again for a referendum on self-deter-
 mination.
 The Algerians are striving in every available
 forum to enhance the political standing of the
 Polisario Front. This week, they were expected to
 lobby at the Organization of African Unity
 ministerial meeting in Addis Ababa for recogni-
 tion of the Front as the national liberation move-
 ment of the Sahara. The OAU liberation com-
 mittee, which is dominated by African militants,
 recommended such recognition when it met last
 month. The more politically balanced ministerial
 body may be more sensitive to Moroccan and
 Mauritanian objections and defer action.
 Arab League Secretary General Riad con-
 tinued his peacemaking mission to Algeria,
 Morocco, and Mauritania this week. He arrived in
 Rabat on February 22 following a three-day visit to
 Algiers; he is expected to visit Mauritania later
 this week. Algerian commentary after Riad's
 departure claimed he met with Polisario
 representatives. If this is true, he is likely to
 receive a cold shoulder in Morocco and
 Mauritania.
 There were no confirmed clashes between
 Moroccan and Algerian forces in the Sahara this
 week. Polisario guerrillas continued to harass the
 Moroccans in a few scattered areas,  however,
 and they may step up the pace of their activity on
 the eve of the Moroccan-Mauritanian take-over.
 ANGOLA: BEGINNING TO GOVERN
 With the end of the conventional war, the
 victorious Popular Movement regime is moving
 quickly to impose its authority in the areas from
 which it recently displaced its rivals and to get the
 economy moving again. Early this  week, the
 foreign minister of the Movement's People's
 Republic of Angola was seated at the Organiza-
 tion of African Unity ministerial  meeting that
 convened in Addis Ababa. The Luanda govern-
 ment has now won wide international accep-
 tance, including an invitation from the EC to join
 its association with 46 other developing countries.
 Party officials, technicians, and policemen are
 following Popular Movement and Cuban military
 forces into the major urban and economic centers
 the troops have occupied. In each locale, com-
 mittees have been established to handle local ad-
 ministration. The Movement has also announced
 universal military conscription and stricter re-
 quirements for admission to the Movement,
 which has become the country's sole legal party
 with the outlawing last weekend of the rival
 National Front and National Union.
 In the economic field, President Neto's
 government has assigned high priority to getting
 the Benguela Railroad back in operation. The
 most serious problem is the rebuilding of several
 bridges-one at the Zairian border. The line
 carries better than half of the imports and exports
 of Zaire and Zambia and brought in about $45
 million in revenues in 1973. The government has
 not yet indicated how it will deal with the
 British-Belgian consortium that owns 90 percent
 of the railroad.
 Negotiations are under way with the com-
 bine of South African, Belgian, British, and
 American interests that has controlled diamond
 mining in Angola. Prospects for Gulf Oil's return
 to its concession in Cabinda improved last week
 when the company obtained permission from
 Washington to release royalty payments to the
 Luanda regime. Gulf's operations have been the
 largest single source of government revenues in
 recent years.
 The Popular Movement also launched a ma-
 jor campaign last week to revive agricultural
 production. Profitable coffee plantations in the
 north and commercial agriculture in the central
 highlands were almost completely disrupted by
 the civil war.

 The continued presence of some 13,000
 Cuban troops in Angola is likely to complicate
 Luanda's foreign relations. Many African coun-
 tries, and especially neighboring Zaire and Zam-
 bia, have made it clear they are anxious to see the
 Cuban soldiers depart, and even some staunch
 African supporters of the Popular Movement are
 becoming uneasy that the Neto regime will begin
 to look like a Cuban puppet. The Movement's
 statements that Angola is not under foreign in-
 fluence seem increasingly defensive in tone,
 suggesting that Popular Movement officials have
 become more sensitive to criticism of the Cuban
 presence.
 South Africa apparently has pulled out most
 of the troops it has been keeping on the Angolan
 side of the border with Namibia. It is maintaining
 several small garrisons to protect the Cunene
 hydroelectric project, however. For now, the
 Luanda regime appears willing to overlook their
 presence.
 The Neto regime's major external concern
 continues to be Zaire, even though President
 Mobutu is himself on the defensive and appears
 to have no intention of becoming involved either
 directly or indirectly in further military ventures
 in Angola. At the OAU meeting this week, Neto's
 foreign minister charged Zaire with violating the
 OAU charter by having sent Zairian troops into
 Angola to support the National Front. The state-
 ment was probably a warning to Mobutu that the
 Movement can muster political as well as military
 support if Zaire attempts any future aggression.
 Despite the minister's attack, there are indications
 work out an accommodation.

 ETHIOPIA: MORE ARRESTS
 The arrest of at least 350 prominent
 Ethiopians

 r                   power struggle within the
 ruling military council. There are indications that
 Major Mengistu Hailemariam, the regime's op-
 portunistic first vice chairman, ordered the arrests
 on his own with a view to regaining his former in-
 fluence through the support of council radicals
 and their civilian allies. A countermove-perhaps
 bolstering the authority of Chairman Teferi Ben-
 ti-by opponents of Mengistu and the radicals
 could follow.
 Among the persons imprisoned in the recent
 roundup were a number of retired generals,
 businessmen, high-level civil servants, and even
 some widows of the senior military officers and
 aristocrats executed in November 1974. They
 were accused of having engaged in subversive ac-
 tivity. The corrupt patriarch of the Ethiopian
 Orthodox Church was also detained; he had lost
 the support of much of the Christian community
 earlier because of his failure to stand up to the
 council.
 Mengistu has been looking for a way to make
 a political comeback, after realizing some months
 ago that his position was eroding. He and his chief
 rival-second vice chairman Lieutenant Colonel
 Atnafu Abate-had both lost favor with other
 council members because of their constant
 maneuvering against each other. With their
 decline, Teferi Benti's influence had increased.

 Mengistu's actions are said to have angered
 many council members, although some of the dis-
 content probably stems more from resentment
 over his failure to consult them than from the
 arrests themselves. Few members are willing to
 make an issue of the detention of additional
 wealthy conservatives. Others may have mis-
 givings about the seemingly indiscriminate nature
 of the arrests.
 On the other hand, the council as a whole
 has felt increasingly threatened by its many op-
 ponents, and most members probably believed
 some action was needed to intimidate their
 critics.  The military rulers are particularly con-
 cerned about the Ethiopian Democratic Union, an
 organization led by well-known members of the
 country's former aristocracy. Some of the new
 detainees are suspected of collaborating with the
 Democratic Union, which has conducted guerrilla
 operations in western Ethiopia and is believed to
 have supporters elsewhere in the country. The
 council believes the Union is gaining support in
 the provinces.
 Although the radicals' opponents on the
 council and in the armed forces have not
 attempted a counter move, they are not likely to
 remain passive if Mengistu and the radicals
 appear to be consolidating their power. Most
 council members realize the council's support has
 declined because of the socialist measures it has
 already  implemented,  particularly the
 nationalization of urban and rural land. They
 would be reluctant to accept a further move to
 the left, which would narrow the council's pop-
 ular support and make it even more dependent
 on repression to survive. Key military units out-
 side Addis Ababa, which have been dissatisfied
 with the ruling group's policies and
 authoritarianism for some time, might break
 openly with the council if the radicals clearly
 become the dominant force.
 The council unveiled a major government
 reshuffle this week that appears largely unrelated
 to the arrests and internal maneuvering. Seven
 ministers were fired and 55 new officials were ap-
 pointed, including four new ministers, three
 provincial chief administrators, and six permanent
 secretaries.
 The changes were presented as part of a cam-
 paign against bureaucratic timidity and inaction.
 Most of the new officials are younger and more
 committed to change than their predecessors,
 many of whom held office under the old regime.
 It is questionable, however, whether the new ap-
 pointees will exercise more initiative than the of-
 ficials they replaced. They will not be encouraged
 by the latest arrests of civil servants, and there are
 no indications that the council is prepared to Rive
 BANGLADESH-INDIA: STILL UNEASY
 Relations between Bangladesh and India
 continue to be marked by frictions and mutual
 suspicions, although tensions have eased con-
 siderably since late, last year when the turmoil in
 Bangladesh and the threat of Indian military in-
 tervention peaked. Dacca, still troubled by the ac-
 tivities of Indian-based Bengalee dissidents, has
 now become exercised over a water-sharing dis-
 pute. India, for its part, remains unsure of the
 martial law administration in Dacca and continues
 to maintain pressure on the Bengalees to prevent
 a further shift away from the close collabora-
 tion that existed under the former Mujib regime.
 Late last month, Bengalee officials publicly
 charged that Bengalee insurgents coming from
 India had again raided several border outposts in
 Bangladesh. The Bengalees claimed that the in-
 surgents were supported by Indian paramilitary
 forces in violation of assurances given in meetings
 held last December between officials of the two
 countries after a similar series of border incidents.

 New Delhi denied the charges and, in turn, ac-
 cused Dacca of attempting to revive anti-Indian
 feeling in Bangladesh.
 Recent meetings between Bengalee and In-
 dian border security officials helped ease the con-
 troversy. A three-day conference in Dacca
 produced an agreement to establish a joint team
 to investigate the border incidents and report
 back to the two governments. The two sides also
 agreed to hold periodic meetings to resolve local
 issues.
 Despite the outwardly positive tone of the
 sessions, more border problems are likely. Rein-
 forced Indian paramilitary units remain in the
 border area, and an Indian official has admitted
 that, in the past, New Delhi has given aid to
 Bengalee dissidents. With or without Indian sup-
 port, the dissidents are probably capable of caus-
 ing more trouble for the Dacca government.
 The dispute over water sharing-a problem
 with a long history-has been brought to the fore
 by the approach of the March-May dry season.
 The Bengalees claim that Indian diversion of the
 waters of the Ganges at Farakka, where India
 opened a new dam last year, has sharply lowered
 the level of the river as it crosses into Bangladesh.
 They predict navigational problems, a decline in
 their crop production, and increasing salinity in
 the delta. The Bengalee predictions appear ex-
 aggerated. Bangladesh last week rejected an In-
 dian proposal for talks on the issue. Dacca says it
 sees no purpose for such talks until India halts
 diversion of the water. The Indians, in turn, have
 rejected this condition.
 The public charges by Bangladesh on border
 clashes and the diversion of the Ganges represent
 a departure from Dacca's policy since last
 December of generally avoiding statements likely
 to irritate New Delhi and, at least in part, they
 probably reflect sincere concern. Bengalee leader
 General Zia ur-Rahman may also see a need,
 however, to exploit an external threat to keep his
 army behind him; his shaky martial law ad-
 ministration has been troubled by military in-
 discipline and rifts in the ~ officer corps. Zia
 probably realizes the possible danger inherent in
 whipping up the considerable anti-Indian senti-
 ment in the army, but he may hope his popularity
 among the enlisted men will allow him to channel
 any reaction into support for the government.
 The Bengalees may also have foreign policy
 motives in publicizing their charges against India.
 To the extent that their fears of Indian intentions
 have been rekindled, they may be attempting to
 elicit support from friendly countries, as they did
 in a diplomatic campaign last fall when they were
 most fearful of the possibility of Indian interven-
 tion. Dacca may also believe that its emphasis on a
 threat from across the border will -help it in its
 quest for new military equipment from potential
 suppliers.

 ARGENTINA: LAST CHANCE FOR PERON?
 President Peron faced mounting pressure this
 week from within her party for more changes in
 her cabinet and the removal of her controversial
 advisers. A number of top Peronist leaders finally
 joined other civilian groups in the belief that only
 by purging her administration can Peron avert a
 military take-over that could well eliminate
 civilian participation in the top ranks of govern-
 ment.
 Early in the week Peronist leaders met with
 the President to demand the removal of her ad-
 visers and the adoption of new economic policies.
 They stressed to her the urgent need for a
 "change of direction" by the government.
 The national council of the Peronist par-
 ty-the group's policy-making body-supported
 the demands, but only after a bitter debate that
 resulted in the resignations of six members loyal
 to the President. The six, along with other top
 Peronists still backing the President, heaped scorn
 on their colleagues for betraying the chief ex-
 ecutive and advocating "deceitful questioning of
 the cabinet and government policies." The US
 embassy calls the Peronist party "virtually frac-
 tured" as a result of the dispute.
 Peron subsequently displayed her now
 familiar defiance by publicly rejecting the
 proffered resignations of all the cabinet members
 and reiterating her full confidence in them.
 Nonetheless, it has since become apparent that at
 least one, and probably more, cabinet shifts are in
 the offing. Indeed, press accounts indicate that
 Defense Minister Guardo is already preparing to
 leave.
 Cabinet shuffles have bought time for Peron
 on many previous occasions and could again. It
 seems more likely that only a purge of her inner
 circle, which she consistently refuses, can satisfy
 her massed opponents. Continued resistance on
 this issue could impel congress, which reconven-
 ed late Wednesday, to take up again a motion to
 declare Peron unable to discharge her duties. For
 several months military commanders have been
 repeatedly warning civilian politicians that they
 must resolve the political and economic chaos or
 face a long period of military rule. The President's
 stubbornness could spark the armed forces, now
 more than ever oised to take over, to make their
 move.

 Geisel has repeatedly ordered security forces
 to curb such abuses as torture and illegal deten-
 tions, but his demands have been largely ignored
 by military conservatives who argue that strong
 measures are necessary to prevent a recurrence of
 the disruptive political activity and subversive
 violence that characterized Brazil before 1968.
 After the internationally publicized death of news
 correspondent Vladimir Herzog in an army jail
 last fall, however, Geisel committed his prestige
 to a strong stand against abuses of human rights.
 The President's initiatives have not met with
 direct opposition and are unlikely to do so, but
 there are indications that a whispering campaign
 has begun against liberals and alleged subversives
 who occupy prominent government positions.

 employed against petty criminals-to include

 in taking on the conservatives, Geisel is trying
 to roll back an influential sector of the military
 that has exerted strong pressure on every presi-
 dent since 1964. If he succeeds, he will greatly
 enhance his personal authority and ease the way
 for further relaxation of political controls, a goal
 Geisel has long professed but which he has made
 little progress toward achieving. Failure, however,
 would only add to his already considerable
 political and economic difficulties, and could tie
 his hands on more issues for the remaining three
 years of his term.
 COLOMBIA: VIOLENCE INCREASES
 A sharp increase in terrorism, guerrilla activi-
 ty, and common crime has forced President Lopez
 to drop plans for lifting the nine-month-old state
 of siege in time for the midterm elections in April.
 The current unrest runs the gamut from
 strikes to civil disorders and kidnapings. A variety
 of causes, economic and political, and adherents
 of both the right and left are involved. The con-
 tinuing unrest has raised doubts that the country's
 civilian leaders are sufficiently aware of the
 potential gravity of the security situation or are
 sufficiently concerned to take the necessary
 measures to restore public order and confidence.
 Not only is the government plagued by student
 strikes and clashes with the police but a work
 stoppage in Buenaventura, Colombia's leading
 Pacific port, has crippled commercial activity in
 that city. Civil strikes by bank employees and tax
 collectors, serve only to confirm the general
 public impression that the government is not
 responding as vigorously as it should to the crisis
 it is facing.
 Adding to the increased concern has been
 the highly publicized kidnaping of the veteran
 head of the Colombia Workers Federation. His
 abductors are claiming he will be "tried" for
 crimes against the working class. Leaders of the
 federation have threatened a massive strike to
 protest the kidnaping, raising the threat of further
 disorders.
 Against this backdrop, the country is
 preparing for departmental and municipal elec-
 tions on April 18, usually an important barometer
 of popular sentiment for the presidential election
 two years later. There are tentative indications
 that the voter turnout will be light even for an off-
 year election. Party rallies have been sparsely
 attended and voter registration is down. This
 situation could favor extreme leftist candidates,
 particularly in Bogota, at the expense of the two
 major parties. Embassy sources blame the
 widespread apathy and disaffection on the
 government's inability to stem inflation or deal
 with well-publicized scandals and corruption.

 CIEC: FIRST ROUND ENDS
 Representatives of both the developed and
 the developing countries are saying some
 progress was made in Paris last week during the
 first round of meetings of the four working com-
 missions of the Conference on International
 Economic Cooperation. Serious differences in ap-
 proach and expectations remain, however, which
 are likely to become more pronounced when the
 second round of talks begins on March 18.
 Discussion at this round centered almost en-
 tirely on questions of procedure and agenda,
 although talks were begun in the development
 commission on two substantive issues-trade and
 balance-of-payments problems of the developing
 countries. Important differences on energy and
 financial issues did not prevent agreement on the
 future work programs of these two commissions,
 but the commission on raw materials was less
 successful; it will continue to debate an agenda
 when it reconvenes next month.
 The developed countries, citing the uncer-
 tain economic outlook in the near term, were
 generally unwilling to make any long-term com-
 mitments. Lack of coordination of developed
 country positions was a major problem, especially
 in the raw materials and development com-

 Agency to fall back on.

 Lopez will have to handle the issue with care.
 He recognizes that the luster of his election vic-
 tory has long since worn off, that economic
 problems are mounting, and that the public's
 sense of security is being eroded by daily
 violence. If the situation continues to deteriorate
 the military will almost certainly demand a larger
 role for itself in putting an end to the disorders.
 The EC and the Japanese, in particular, were
 unprepared to begin substantive talks during this
 round, seeking instead to postpone debate at
 least until next month. EC internal decision-
 making processes were also very cumbersome in
 this session, although this will probably prove less
 of a problem later.
 Pressure will grow on the developed states to
 show some progress in Paris before the Fourth UN
 Conference on Trade and Development opens in
 May in Nairobi, if only to temper an attitude of
 confrontation which otherwise might arise there.
 The developing countries appear determined
 to use the talks in Paris to reach agreement on
 specific and constructive proposals before the
 UNCTAD meeting. This was most apparant in the
 development commission which covers the topic
 most critical to developing country in-
 terests-trade.
 While the developing states represented in
 Paris may have been content to use the first ses-
 dis-
 sion of the commissions for procedural  eel
 cussions, some of them, at least, probably feel
 they cannot afford to let the March session
 proceed in the same way. An unproductive
 meeting in March could discredit the argument
 they made to other developing countries that the

 smaller Paris forum can be effectively used to ex-
 tract concessions later from the developed coun-
 tries at the UNCTAD meeting in Nairobi.
 The developed states accomplished a major
 objective when the energy commission agreed to
 begin substantive discussions next month with a
 general review of the world energy situation. The
 developed states view such an analysis as fun-
 damental to building a broad and factual
 framework that can be drawn upon in future
 sessions when specific topics are discussed. The
 oil-exporting states had been pushing to begin
 work immediately on specific topics to avoid any
 discussion of the impact of high oil prices on
 developing countries that must import oil.
 The finance commission's discussions last
 week focused on the causes of the world-wide
 recession and the developing states' desire to shift
 attention to basic structural problems in the world
 economy. Both sides finally agreed to continue
 next month a general discussion of the world
 situation, placing specific emphasis on longer
 term prospects.
 In the commission on raw materials the
 developing states continued to push for accep-
 tance of the UNCTAD secretariat's integrated
 program on commodities, which stresses specific
 remedies such as buffer stocks, a common fund,
 and indexation. The developed states, particularly
 those in the EC, argued for a commodity-by-com-
 modity approach, which could entail a discussion
 of substantive commodity problems before
 general agreement is reached on an overall ap-
 proach to raw rn aterials trade.
