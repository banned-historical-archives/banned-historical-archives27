 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENA`I;E          August 23, 1965
 t11 sums necessary would be more than $2
 million higher under a license policy than
 under a title policy.  Since the original ap-
 propriations for developing the PKU test are
 estimated to be about $1 million, it can be
 seen that,a failure to take title would result
 in the taxpayers' being charged $21/s million
 every year for something they had already
 bought for $1 million.
 The details of this story are more fully
 set forth in appendix VII, attached, as I be-
 lieve they are especially pertinent in view of
 the members of the Judiciary Committee who
 have taken an interest in this particular
 matter.
 I realize that S. 1809 contains a special ex-
 ception for "fields which directly concern the
 public health, welfare, and safety."  But this
 is a limited field, where less than 5 percent
 of R & D funds are spent.
 If it makes sense, to safeguard the tax-
 payers' investment in this area, where his
 .Government puts up an estimated 15 per-
 cent of the research money, does not it make
 even more sense in'scientIfic instruments,
 where the taxpayer furnishes 57 percent, or
 electronics and communications equipment,
 where the taxpayers' share is' 67 percent, or
 aircraft, where the share is 89 percent.  (See
 Federal Bar'News, November 1963, p. 357).
 What about education?  What about hous-
 ing?
 How many taxcuts could be paid for by
 the sale or reservatiQn o4 royalties on some
 of this extremely valuable patent property
 areas?  Far from assisting the taxpayer in
 this respect, S. 1809 would prevent agencies
 now sharing royalties to continue to do so.
 (Letter to the chairman of the Judiciary
 Committee by Federal Avaition Agency, June
 5, 1965 (p. 2).
 From the foregoing, it does not appear
 that S. 1809 gives the taxpayer an even
 break.  I, therefore, urge the Subcommittee
 to seek testimony from qualified fiscal ex-
 perts the effects of a general sale or royalty
 system.
 CONTENT OF GENERAL PATEN'.{' LEGISLATION
 Now, Mr. Chairman, let me comment fur-
 ther as to the ppecifics of the legislation now
 before the, cosrmittee.  I have noted that
 the Departents of Justice and Health, Edu-
 catl.on, and Welfare, have both expressed the
 opinion that further experience should be
 aceyisnulated  tncier . the, President's patent
 'policy of 1963 before it Is embedded per-
 manently in the form of statutory law, and
 the, Atomic. Energy Commission opposes en-
 actment of S. 1809.  If the subcommittee
 does report a bill, I believe that these res-
 ervations and this lack. of experience and
 -empirical data should be recognized by mak-
 ing the legislation quite general and provid-
 ing for collection of the needed informa-
 tion.  I believe that a bill on the subject
 at this time should be governed by the fol-
 lowing six principles:
 1. A clear policy statement that Federal
 research and development property is a na-
 tural resource belonging to the people of the
 United States, and must, therefore, be safe-
 guarded accordingly.
 2. Plain and.certain penalties for the give-
 away or unauthorized disposition of Federal
 R. & D. property.
 3. Provision for preserving the many con-
 gressional patent protections that have been
 ordered into law over the past three decades.
 4. Practical means for discouraging monop-
 oly and concentration, and thus protecting
 the intere is of small business and an "open
 econotlic sp tem "-
 -5.. Clear and unambiguous standards sepa-
 rating and providing for private interests
 and the public interest in the commercial
 development of the, property.
 6. A system whereby Federal It. & D. prop-
 erty sought by private companies for com-
 inertial development could be sold or licensed
 to them for an amount equivalent to fair
 market value, and the same property sought
 by other public institutions for dedication
 to public purposes 'could be sold or licensed
 for half of the fair-market value, wherever
 practicable.
 The language of the policy declaration as
 you are aware is taken from the October 10, -
 1963, memorandum.  In my judgment, it is
 consistent with settled law and sound pub-
 lic policy. A summary of the applicable law
 is attached as appendix V.  The absence of
 such a declaration or the adoption by ex-
 pression or Implication of a contrary policy,
 would be, I believe, an historic failure by
 the Congress.
 PROCEDURAL SECTIONS ARE AS IMPORTANT AS
 POLICY
 Several of these provisions, pertain to mat-
 ters of procedure and standards.  These are
 the vehicles by which any policy would be
 carried into effect, and are fully as.important
 as the policy sections.
 S. 789 is a fine example for a procedural
 trap.  As stated by the Department of HEW,
 "the entire thrust of the bill is thus to im-
 pede the Governments taking and retaining
 of ownership In inventions derived from fed-
 erally financed research, by making this a
 long aruous and exceedingly difficulty and
 in many cases impossible task." As Dr. Horn-
 ing stated: "In short, I think it leaves too
 few rights to the Government." 4
 As to an appropriate standard for waiver,
 I would recommend the one put forward by
 the  1947 Justice Department report,  that.
 there might be waiver under "emergency con-
 ditions" where the head of the agency certi-
 fied this was so.  I believe that this standard
 would cover the equities fo all contractors
 adequately, but I would be willing to change
 my view in the face  of enough concrete
 evidence that it would not.
 There are several standards set forth in S.
 1809, under which contractors would be able
 to acquire exclusive rights.  The principal
 one of these is "exceptional circumstances."
 The use of this phrase in connection with
 patent administration by a Federal agency
 has been specifically considered by a Mem-
 ber of this body, the Senator from Connecti-
 cut, Senator RreicoFF, when he was Secre-
 tary of Health, Education, and Welfare.  He
 Warned of the dangerous ambiguities in the
 use of this standard in the following terms:
 "The phrase in 'exceptional circumstances'
 is relatively vague and indefinite and in the
 absence of any indicated criteria in the policy
 itself would appear to leave considerable lati-
 tude to each agency head to determine what
 constitutes such circumstances.  While this
 does have the advantage of flexibility, it does
 have the disadvantages of exposing agency
 heads to the pressures of those contractors
 who would urge that each circumstance of
 hardship, however slight, represents an excep-
 tional circumstances calling for more gen-
 erous allocation of invention rights."
 The phrase "special circumstances" in sec-
 tion 4(c)  of the bill is open to the same
 criticism which  I  consider  to  be  wholly
 persuasive.
 As a matter of fact, the report of the Patent
 Advisory Panel upon which U. 1809 and S.
 789 are based, admits, and I quote:
 "The working experience of the subcom-
 mittee has revealed that various agencies
 have placed different interpretations on cer-
 tain key phrases found throughout the policy
 statement.  It is believed that unless addi-
 tional guidance is given, this problem of
 proper  interpretation  would  only  become
 exaggerated if left to the unguided judg-
 ment of the hundreds of contracting officers
 throughout the Government.     The follow-
 ing are examples: '? ' ' 3.  The phrase 'ex-
 ceptional circumstances.' "
 Mr. Chairman, I believe this confession is
 the best evidence the subcommittee can have
 to establish two propositions:
 1. That the disposition of these billions
 of dollars worth of patent properties should
 be placed by Congress, once and for all be-
 yond the power and discretion of "hundreds
 of contracting officers' throughout the Gov-
 ernment"; and
 2. That the phrase "exceptional circum-
 stances" is not an appropriate standard to
 be used in this legislation.
 It is my strong feeling that the power of
 disposition should be given into the ultimate
 responsibility of the head of any agency
 who is responsible to the President of the
 United States.  Every effort should be made
 to preserve the actuality of responsibility
 for the disposition of Federal patent prop-
 erty, rather than perpetrating a misleading
 appearance of responsibility.
 In S. 2160, I have suggested additional pro-
 visions for public licenses and royalties, and
 procedures which would result in written
 findings by the head of an agency as to both
 public versus private interests and value of
 patent interests.  These proposals might be
 helpful to the subcommittee in formulating
 the necessary standards, and I commend
 them to the subcommittee's consideration.
 If I can further assist the subcommittee
 during its deliberations, I would be glad to
 do so.

 UPRISING AND THE DIVISION IN
 THE  AMERICAN  PRESS
 Mr. DODD.  Mr. President, 3 months
 after the outbreak of the Dominican up-
 rising, a debate still rages over the wis-
 dom of President Johnson's decision in
 sending in the U.S. Marines.
 This debate has found a reflection in
 the hearings that have recently been
 conducted by the Senate Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee.
 In advance of these hearings, the For-
 eign Relations Committee published a
 brochure entitled "Background Informa-
 tion Relating to the Dominican Repub-
 lic," which was described as "a compila-
 tion of material deemed useful in any
 discussion dealing with the present situ-
 ation in the Dominican Republic."  In
 addition to official documents and state-
 ments dealing with the Dominican crisis

 Yet, what do we find?
 As, you know, S. 1809 has no such small
 business provision.  The President's Science
 Adviser admits at page 26 of the transcript
 that patent questions are "especially impor-
 tant" to Small businesses.  He admits at page
 27 that the patent right problems of sub-
 contractors, are unresolved.. Mr. Chairman,
 in the name of the ,9Q .percent of American
 firms  which  are  sn;all  business,  and the
 30Q,000 manufacturers which are small busi-
 ness, we ought to give small business an even
 break in any patent bill.
 I am_not asking for preferential treatment
 for small, business.. But when, year after
 year, the 2 or 3 dozen largest companies in
 sell, or be driven out of business.  It also
 means that many men of initiative would be
 denied the rights of going into business, or
 seeing their own businesses grow and flourish.
 The philosophy of this proposal thus strikes
 at the heart of our free enterprise system.
 Accordingly, Mr. Chairman, I recommend
 that there be a mechanism by which small
 businesses Can gain access to public research
 and development patents done by the giant
 corporations with public funds.  Retention
 of title and a flexible system of licensing ac-
 cording to the equities involved seems to me
 an avenue that should be explored.

 National Observer,
 While some of these correspondents
 and observers were more sympathetic to
 the junta, some less sympathetic, and
 while there were other differences be-
 tween them, they were all essentially
 agreed on one basic fact: That the Com-
 munists had seized complete control of
 the revolt at the point where President
 Johnson decided to intervene, and that,
 had the President delayed or attempted
 to handle the situation otherwise, the re-
 sult would have been another Castro re-
 gime in the Americas.
 In the remarks that follow, I intend to
 say a few words by way of establishing
 the credentials of the more prominent of
 these correspondents, and quote briefly
 from their writing on the Dominican Re-
 public crisis.
 In doing so I shall quote first from the
 writings of the two Pulitzer Prize win-
 ners, Miss Marguerite Higgins, and Mr.
 Hal Hendrix.
 MISS MARGUERITE
 Miss Higgins, now a correspondent for
 Newsday Syndicate, served as a Herald
 Tribune foreign correspondent for more
 than 20 years. She covered World War
 II, the Korean war, and the war in Viet-
 nam, and she served as Herald Tribune
 bureau chief in Tokyo, Berlin, and Mos-
 cow.
 Among other things, Miss Higgins
 wrote that:
 The Bosch-Caamano argument (which be-
 littled the Communist role) is in total con-
 trast in both its parts to the portrait brought
 back by the OAS Special Committee to Santo
 Domingo.
 According to Ambassador Ilmar Penns, Ma-
 rinho, of Brazil, "The whole Committee (the
 OAS Special Committee) agreed that the Ca-
 amano movement could be rapidly converted
 to a Communist insurrection that was sus-
 ceptible of gaining the support of the Marx-
 ist-Lenin powers."
 As to conditions in Santo Domingo in May,
 "It was a no man's land," said*the Brazilian
 Ambassador.  "There had been a complete
 collapse of public authority.  The Dominican
 Republic had disappeared as a legal and polit-
 ical entity-arms had been given to a disor-
 iented nation of fanatics and adolescents who
 were in a frenzied state egged on by subver-
 sive broadcasts-anarchy reigned-any orga-
 nized group that made a landing in the Do-
 minican Republic could have dominated the
 situation."
 Miss Higgins quoted the Ambassador
 of Colombia as stating at the OAS special
 committee:
 What were we to do when blood was run-
 ning in the streets-what happens when a
 state in this condition is so close to Cuba?
 Are we to sit silently on balconies and watch
 the end of the tragedy as if we were watch-
 ing some sort of bullfight?
 Miss Higgins said:
 It is important that these judgments on
 Communist  penetration  and  chaos  were
 made by Latins, because Latins are tradition-
 ally the most apprehensive about Yankee
 intervention.
 HAL HENDRIX
 Mr. Hendrix, of the Miami News, won
 the Pulitizer Prize for his coverage of the
 Cuban missile crisis.  He serves as Latin
 American editor of the Miami News as

 Wrote from Santo Domingo: _

 By Tuesday it was over.  The extremists
 had gained control behind the 5cenee, using
 Col. Francisco CaamanoDeno as rebel chief-
 tain and new cover. Caamano_wias installed
 as "co,i stitutionalist President."
 The Communist design was to create chaos
 and anarchy.  Now using Caama.no's "con-
 stitutionaiist" movement, as a s:91eld, they
 engineered distribution of weapons to thou-
 aands of Civilians--probably as many as
 16,000 were armed in 1 day.

 ,Mr. DuBois also reported that on
 March 16, just 5 weeks before the April
 24 revolt, the Dominican Communist
 Party (PSP--D) issued a manifesto call-
 ing for the "return of Prof. Juan Bosch
 to legitimate control of the government."
 The manifesto incited the people to vio-
 lence to.restore Bosch in these words:
 The entire population must fight in the
 streets, in the squares, in the factories, in
 the fields, for the return of Juan, Bosch as
 the head of the constitutional government.
 ROWLAND EVANS AND ROBERT NOVAK
 Rowland Evans and Robert Novak, the
 distinguished columnists for the Herald
 Tribune syndicate,  were among the
 many who did not arrive at the se.me
 conclusions  as  Bernard  Collier,  the

 As of mid-May, Caamano was still in con-
 tact with the Dominican Reds, according to
 reliable  informants.   Hard  evidence  that
 prominent Communists continued to play a
 leading role in the rebel military command
 up until the third week in May, is the fact
 that four of them were killed. at that time in
 the heavy fighting around the national pal-
 ace.
 How many Communists there were, or still
 are in Caamano ranks, is relatively unimpor-
 tant.   A  "numbers  game,"  unfortunately
 started by the State Department when it is-
 sued a hastily prepared list of 58 Reds con-
 spicuous in the revolt's early days, is being
 played by `ignorant or dubious writers who
 are thus obscuring the real significance of
 the Communist role.
 First of all, many of the leading Commu-
 nist participants have been trained in Cuba
 and/or Russia.  The State Department named
 18.  Sources here put the total at nearer 50.
 That is more than enough to seize the leader-
 ship of a surging mass with little or no mili-
 tary experience and no knowledge whatso-
 ever of the strategy and tactics of. revolu-
 tions.
 JEREMIAH A. O'LEARY
 Mr. O'Leary, of the Washington Star,
 won the first prize of the Washington
 News Guild for his report on President
 Kennedy's assassination.  After his re-
 turn from Santo Domingo, Mr. O'Leary
 wrote the following:
 There are no Communists in the rebel high
 command, officials believe, nor is Caamano
 himself a Communist.
 As one official put it: "What is the use of
 being minister of interior or foreign minister
 in a government that only controls a few
 acres of a poorer section of Santo Domingo?
 Those with the real power are the Com-
 munists who control the armed civilians, the
 roughly disciplined youths who owe alle-
 giance to the three main Communist groups.
 "These groups are the PSPD, or othrodox
 Moscow line party; the MPD, which adheres
 to the philosophy of Peiping, and the Ha-
 vana-line APCJ or June 14 movement."
 MISS VIRGINIA PREWETT
 Miss Prewett has for many years been
 an expert on Latin American affairs.
 She is a syndicated columnist, the edi-
 torial director of the Latin American
 Times, and the author of several stand-
 ard works on Latin America.  Among
 other things Miss Prewett"s coverage of
 Latin American affairs have been cited
 for excellence by the Overseas Press Club,
 and she has several times served as the
 Press Club's chairman for inter-Ameri-
 can affairs.
 Miss Prewett wrote:
 If Mr. Johnson had taken the consultation
 gamble and lost it, the American people
 would never have forgotten that Americans
 were massacred and the Caribbean fell to
 communism while their President talked to
 the OAS over the phone.
 JOHN T. SKELLY
 Mr. Skelly is associate editor of the
 Latin American Times. He reported for
 UPI in Havana until January of 1959.
 He knew Castro as a boy, and because of
 his  strong  anti-Batista  convictions,
 served without pay as press coordinator
 for the so-called revolutionary govern-
 ment of Cuba, set up by Castro in
 January-February of 1959.
 In a recent article published by the
 Latin American Times, Mr., Skelly wrote

 TIME, MAOAL''INE
 This is what the Latin-American team
 at. Time magazine had to say about the
 Dominican revolution:
 What had happened, in its baldest terms,
 was an. attempt by highly trained Castro-
 Communist agitators and their followers to
 turn an abortive comeback by a deposed
 Dominican. l'regident into a "war of national
 liberation."

 nized as one of our most distinguished
 columnists and commentators.. Indeed,
 I think it is no exaggeration to say ,that
 there are very few commentators who
 command such broad respect in all sec-
 tors of the, political community.
 This is what Mr. Sevareid wrote;
 For me it is impossible to believe that the
 Communist threat was a myth, impossible
 to believe that a democratic pnd stable gov-
 ernment could have been formed, by the
 impassioned people, a vast number of them
 'youngsters.  It is hard for me to believe that
 we could not have prevented the -tragic fight-
 ing in the northern part of the city, easy to
 believe that we did prevent an even more
 awful bloodletting in the congested down-
 town region.
 DICREY CIIAPELLE
 Miss Dickey Chapelle has for many
 years now been a frequent contributor
 to. Reader's Digest, the National Geo-
 graphic magazine, and other leading
 American periodicals.  She has covered
 virtually every important conflict since
 World.'War 11-the I oreall,, V5J'A, the land-
 ing of the marines in Lebanon, the Hun-
 garian Resolution, the Castro takeover in
 Cuba, the war in Laos, the Chinese inva-
 sion of India, the Vietnam war, and more
 recently the Dominican uprising, which
 she covered for the weekly newspaper, the
 National Observer.
 ,Miss Chapelle is a'- front yline. cprre-
 spondent rather than a rear echelon,cgr-
 respondent. Because she believes iu see-
 ing things with her own eyes, she has
 made frequent parachute jumps with the
 Vietnamese and Laotian forces, and she
 has been ' exposed to fire countless times.
 In one of lrer artiples, Miss, Chapelle
 told a very revealing story..  She had
 heard that an old-time,Castro, stalwart,
 Ramon Pichirilo. Mejia, a man whom she
 had met in Cuba during the Castro take-
 over, was active in the Dominican revolt.
 She, decided that she would try to find
 him. Entering the rebel quarter, she re-
 ceived permission to iive with the rebels
 or   period of seygral days.  And_ it
 tur  out tit the rgtlel ,conunandante
 in her district was,thevery man she was
 looking for.  Let me quote_ from.'Miss
 Chaplie's account of her encounter with
 the conlmandapte
 For the first time in the brightening morn-
 ing light, I looked squarely into his face.
 Was it truly familiar, or was my judgment
 suspect after the night's misadvantures?
 Standing amid the nibbled slum, I drew a
 deep breath.
 ."Were you in Cuba then?  I mean, were
 you Castro's boatman?"
 The eyes narrowed and the answer came
 by reflex-proudly.
 "I was the commander of Fidel's Gramma
 and later, in the mountains, where you were,
 Americana, a leader of a battalion for him."
 "Are you Pichirilo?"
 "My name is Ramon Pichirilo Mejia."
 "Did you remember who I was?"
 Ile looked pitingly at me, "Si si, Ameri-
 cana," he grinned and spoke slowly as if the
 words tasted good.
 "Are you then well after what happened to
 you in Cuba?"
 "Well enough to have led people against
 their oppressors In Bolivia and Colombia and
 Venezuela and Costa Rica and Guatemala
 since last I saw you," he nodded.
 He posed.  I shot fast.  He raised his hand.
 "Now do not say I am a Communist, Ameri-
 cana.  If I were truly a Red, I could have a
 good life staying in Cuba.  But you see I am
 here instead, where I was born."
 Because I have endeavored to limit
 myself to the best known correspondents
 I have quoted from only a partial list of
 those who reported in a manner which,
 despite minor differences, generally au-
 thenticated and endorsed the basic deci-
 sion to intervene in the Dominican crisis.
 THE ATTITUDE OF THE A.Z-C10 AND OF LATIN
 AMERICAN UNIONISTS
 Finally, I wish to point out that the
 statements of the AFL-CIO Executive
 Council which was missing from the
 chronological summary, welcomed "the
 prompt and energetic measures taken by
 the President to prevent the Communist
 attempt to seize control of the Dominican
 democratic revolutionary movement and
 to foist a Castro-type dictatorship on
 Santo Domingo."
 The Inter-American Regional Orga-
 nization of Workers-ORIT-an orga-
 nization which embraces most of the im-
 portant labor unions in the hemisphere,
 adopted a resolution, couched in similar
 terms, supporting American interven-
 tion :
 We must point out that the unilateral
 action of the U.S. Armed Forces in this grave
 Dominican conflict has, on the one hand,
 served to save thousands of lives and, at the
 same time, under the guidance of the OAS
 Commission, has  been  able to  contribute
 toward making the horrors of civil war less
 cruel.
 THE REPORT OF THE OAS SPECIAL COMMITTEE
 I have already referred to the report
 of the OAS Special Committee.          The
 minutes of the meeting at which the Spe-
 cial Committee reported to the fourth
 plenary session is a document of such
 importance that I hope all of my col-
 leagues will find the time to read the
 complete text. Let me quote two state-
 ments that were made at this meeting.
 Ambassador  Carrizosa,  the         special
 delegate of Colombia, told the meeting:
 With regard to the sector led. by Colonel
 Francisco  C.aaAaapo,_ many  diplomats  ac-
 credited in the Dominican Republic, and I
 cah-friclude my country's diplomatic repre
 sefitative, feel that, if not Colonel Francisco
 Caamano, whom I do not know to be per-
 sonally  a                                                           Communist,  there  are    indeed
 numerous persons on his side that, If they
 are not members of the Communist Party,
 are actively in favor of Fidel Castro's system
 of government or political purposes.  There
 20507
 is such a tendency in the opinion of many
 diplomats I spoke to, and I do not mention
 other countries in order not to commit coun-
 tries represented here.  They are firmly con-
 vinced that on that side there are many per-
 sons, I do not say members registered in an
 officially  organized  Communist party,  but
 persons who do have leanings toward a well-
 known trend which is prevalent in Cuba.
 Mr. Carrizosa's remarks were corrob-
 orated by the other members of the
 Special Committee.  Summarizing the
 views of the Committee, Ambassador
 Yodice of Paraguay made this state-
 ment:
 The Government of Paraguay, as I stated
 clearly when approval was given to the es-
 tablishment of the collective inter-American
 force, believed from the beginning that con-
 tinental security was at stake.  The replies
 by the Ambassadors composing the Commit-
 tee reporting today on certain questions re-
 garding these delicate aspects of the Domin-
 ican situation have been categorical.                                                                                                                                   My
 government was right.  Continental security
 is threatened.  The danger existed, and still
 exists, that chaos and anarchy will permit
 international communism to transform the
 Dominican  Republic  into  another  Cuba.
 With his customary clarity, courage,  and
 energy, the Ambassador of Colombia, Mr.
 Alfredo Vazquez Carrizosa, has categorically
 mentioned the highly political nature of the
 problem we are facing. In reply to a ques-
 tion of the Ambassador of Uruguay, he has
 rightly said that the peace of America is
 threatened, that the security of the hemi-
 sphere is threatened, and that there is a pos-
 sibility that another Cuba, another Com-
 munist government in the hemisphere will
 arise out of the chaos and anarchy in the
 Dominican Republic.
 OTHER LATIN AMERICAN VIEWS
 There were also many other Latin
 Americans of stature who made com-
 ments supporting the action taken by the
 administration. For example, the Balti-
 more Sun on June 9 carried a statement
 by Dr. Rupo Lopez-Fresquat, first sec-
 retary of the treasury in the revolution-
 ary regime set up by Castro after he came
 to power.  Let me quote from the inter-
 view with Dr. Lopez:
 The Organization of American States has
 stated that communism is incompatible with
 the democratic principles of Latin America.
 The United States has a right to intervene
 against  the  Communists-the  enemy.
 Dr. Lopez believes that Communists were
 involved in the Dominican disorders.
 "They are everywhere," he says, "and they
 are trained to infiltrate popular movements."
 "Their number is  immaterial," he says,
 "for ' 53 trained Communists working with
 an armed civilian militia would be plenty
 under the chaotic conditions that prevailed
 early in the revolt."
 In the light of all these statements,
 Mr. President, I think it is clear beyond
 challenge that the American press was
 not unanimously critical of the admin-
 istration's policy in the Dominican Re-
 public, that the President's decision was,
 in fact, supported by a very substantial
 section of the press corps as well as by
 independent authorities, both Latin and
 American.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to insert into the. RECORD some of
 the writings of the American correspon-
 dents to whom I have referred, in the
 order in which I have mentioned them.
 I think it is also clear beyond challenge
 that the administration's decision en-
 joyed. the endorsement of responsible

 MARGUERITE HIGGINS "ON THE SPOT"
 (By Marguerite Higgins)
 SANTO DOMINGO.-The authoritative rattle
 of automatic weapons was mixed with the
 occasional ping of a light rifle and the rebels
 kept firing on the U.S. marine company for
 a subborn hour and 20 minutes.  The firing
 came from a block away and the rebel snipers
 stretched about two-thirds of a mile along
 the demarcation line between their zone and
 the international area held by. U.S. forces.
 The marines kept their heads down-behind
 sandbags, stone walls, fences, cars-and re-
 turned fire on the infrequent occasions when
 they could get a decent look at their rag-
 tag enemies.  Finally, the firing stopped, as
 inexplicably as it had started and the long
 lines of cars started moving through the
 marine checkpoints at the intersections, ap-
 parently unconcerned that the road they
 were traveling had been a no man's land a
 few minutes before.
 And that's how it is with the crazy cease
 fire that is supposed to be prevailing around
 here.
 But there is one good thing about it ac-
 cording to U.S. Marine Capt. Charles Barstow,
 of Dunellen, N.J.
 "Those, rebels fire high and wild," said
 Captain Barstow, grinning reassuringly as
 another round pinged in somewhere down
 the block.
 And    in  this  case,  he was  right.    For
 Barstow's marine company has not sustained
 any injuries despite what the marine cap-
 tain-a practitioner of the art of understate-
 ment-describes laconically as rather inten-
 sive fire.
 So the fracas would not even have been
 reported on the incident sheet and his ma-
 rine -company's  luck-and remarkable  re-
 straint in the face of provocation-would
 have gone unsung if this reporter and Howard
 Handleman of U.S. News & World Report had
 not happened to stumble into the tail end of
 the fire fight while trying to make our way
 to rebel headquarters in the sniper zone.
 Was there any pattern or purpose in these
 rebel  sniper  attacks?  I  asked  Captain
 Barstow.
 "Militarily there is no sense to it," said the
 young captain.  "They never try to rush us.
 They hide up there on the roofs or sometimes
 dart in the middle of an intersection to fire
 and run.  What I think they are really doing
 is trying to get some martyrs.  And we are
 doing our best not to give them any martyrs.
 We only fire back when a sniper is getting
 awfully close to target and awfully aggres-
 sive."
 We were standing in the front yard of a
 home which had a stone wall in front.  The
 wall gave good cover against incoming fire
 and so several marines had their pup tents
 in it.  A couple more were on the porch of
 the house itself which was heavily sand-
 bagged.
 Catching my glance, the marine said rue-
 fully: "Of course we are a nuisance to those
 people.  But so help me we try to make it up
 to them by courtesy and gifts of coffee and
 such.  It's bothersome to be in a fire light.
 But it is a whole lot more bothersome to
 have tommygun-toting rebels setting fire to
 your house and looting as was happening
 around here when we came.  And these peo-
 ple have been absolutely wonderful to us.
 I heard that some of the press say they hate
 us.  If so, these are some of the best actors
 I have ever seen."
 Later, over In the rebel zone, we could see
 closeup the scary results of the indiscrimi-
 nate distribution of guns after they had been
 looted from police and military armories by
 the rebelling mobs.  It seemed for several
 blocks as if no man was without a rifle or
 automatic weapons slung over his shoulder.
 Few were in uniform.  A great many simply
 had, on open white shirts and slacks.

 military leaders                 supporting  the civilian-
 military junta government created by the
 United States only 10 days ago have turned
 down flat a U.S. proposal 'to replace it with
 another provisional government                 ' '
 The White House and State Department
 officials sent here Sunday bypassed 'Geis.
 Antonio Imbert Berrera, the junta president,
 and his four associates to meet with the ntili-
 tary leaders.                                      ..,
 Some of these members of the military
 hierarchy were the very same` officers -*ho
 20 months ago overthrew the leftist govern-
 ment of President Juan Bosch alter conclud-
 ing he was "soft" on communism in the
 Dominican Republic and was an incompetent
 administrator-an opinion then shared by
 Washington.
 Yet yesterday the U.S. diplomats asked the
 Domin1cai Army, Navy and Air Porce Brass to
 withdraw support from the stanchly anti=
 Communist  Imbert-led ' ~ unto  an
 themselves, with    ' Washin ton-suggested
 pro-Bosch provisional coalition government.
 The n}iiitary hierarchy refused to'buokle
 under thp pressure' and countered with a
 proposal that consideration be given to for-
 mation of a government "of "national har-
 mony," composed of all di'.ino6ratie parties
 in the country and includini the Imbert
 junta.
 The Dominican officers, rejected as totally
 unacceptable the Washington-drafted scheme
 for a government to be headed by' Antonio
 Guzman, who was "flown by the U.S. _ Air
 Force to Washington for secret conferences

 Armed Forces Secretary, said after the meet-
 ing the military establishment solidly sup-

 certain of the names of the American offi-
 cials at the conference.
 The Washington task force includes Mc-
 George Bundy, ' Special Assistant to Presi-
 d'6h _Johnson on' National Security Affairs,
 Under Secretary of State Thomas C. Mann,
 Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus R. Vance,
 and Jack Hood Vaughn, Assistant Secretary
 of State for Inter-American Affairs.  Mann
 flew back-to Washington yesterday.
 "I don't understand why the Americans
 came to talk with us about this instead of
 discussing it with the President of the Na-
 tional Reconstruction Government," Rivera
 Caminero commented. "We do have a Presi-
 dent.now, you know, General Imbert."
 Imbert and` his junta associates said their
 goverritnent  rejects  any attempt by the
 United  States to pressure `acceptance  of
 "persons of Communist affiliation or sympa-
 thizers."  He said he supported the idea of
 a national harmony government composed of
 "all capable and honest Dominicans- regard-
 less of their political affiliation-except for
 the Communists, of course."
 The military leaders and Imbert also sug-
 gested to the American representatives that
 it would be helpful for the Organization of
 American States to maintain a peacekeeping
 force here for at least 2 months after hostili-
 ties end and supervise a referendum so Do-
 minicans can decide by ballots whether they
 want to live under the 1963 or 1962 con-
 stitution.
 The rebel or constitutionalist forces led
 by Col. Francisco Caamano Deno have been
 clamoring for return to the 1963 constitution,
 prepared by the Bosch government.
 In opposing Guzman as a provisional pres-
 ident, Imbert and the military refer to him
 as a puppet of Bosch.  "When the National
 Reconstruction    Government   was   being
 formed," Imbert said, "we called Guzman
 and asked him to be a member. He declined,
 saying he was in ill health and added that
 since he was a close friend of Professor Bosch
 he would have to consult with him."
 Other members of the U.S. proposed coali-
 tion government are reported to be Milton
 Messina,  currently  an  economist  for  the
 Inter-American Development Bank in Wash-
 ington and a former ambassador to Canada
 during  the  Trujillo  dictatorship,  Hector
 Garcia Godoy, Bosch's foreign minister, Dr.
 Alejandro Grullon,  a bank president,    and
 Marcos Cabral,  a Santiago businessman.
 Guzman, Garcia Godoy, and Cabral are
 said to be members of' Bosch's Dominican

 VANCE DENIES U.S. TROOPS ASSISTING
 DOMINICANS
 (By Hal Hendrix)
 SANTO DOMINGO, May 21.-UU.S. Deputy De-
 fense Secretary Cyrus R. Vance, has cate-
 gorically denied allegations that American
 20511
 troops are assisting either of the two battling
 forces in the bitter Dominican civil war.
 He said such allegations are "not correct."
 "President Johnson's instructions are for
 the U.S. forces here to observe strict im-
 partiality and these instructions are being
 carried out," he said at a news conference
 here.
 In reply to a question about reports that
 troops of the civilian-military junta govern-
 ment of national reconstruction are prepar-
 ing to strike at the heart of the Communist-
 infiltrated  rebel  resistance . in  downtown
 Santo Domingo, Vance said:
 "What happens in the future will be gov-
 erned by events and circumstances at the
 time."
 Presumably, if such an attack is launched
 by the loyalist forces they would either have
 to cross the U.S.-controlled east-west security
 corridor across the city or land fighting unite
 from the sea.
 Presently, as emphasized by Vance, the pol-
 icy of the American troops is to prohibit
 crossing of the corridor by any armed Domin-
 ican forces, rebel or loyalist.  Also, U.S. nava'
 vessels are patrolling the Santo Domingo arer
 from close offshore.
 Earlier,  Gen.  Antonio Imbert  Barreras
 junta president, said the loyalist forces wil
 "very  soon"  launch                                                                                                                                  a cleanup offensive
 again the downtown rebel stronghold.
 Vance said some armed members of the
 Dominican police force, loyal to the Imberl
 government, have been permitted in the
 corridor to help maintain law and order.
 Some of the police wear army uniforms
 since men in police uniforms were targets of
 the rioting rebel  extremists  early  in th(
 conflict here.  Vance said the police now ar(
 changing back to the regular attire,
 He also denied published reports that the
 U.S. forces were supplying arms to the junto.
 `troops.
 Vance acknowledged that two small U.S
 military radio units had been with the troop:
 in the northside battle and at the nationa
 palace to help prevent the loyalist gunner;
 from firing into American installations in-
 side the corridor when shooting at the rebe
 forces..
 He also said the United States provided n(
 helicopter assistance to the junta forces, al-
 though two U.S. helicopters were used tc
 transport some civil officials of the junta of
 a survey trip outside the Santo Domingo area
 Vance said published reports of Americar
 troops firing without provocation from th(
 corridor into the rebel zones are not true
 "American troops have returned fire when
 fired upon," he said.
 Asked why U.S. forces referred to the rebelr
 as "unfriendlier," Vance replied:
 "Well, there have been 426 violations (retie"
 fire into the U.S. corridor or safe zone) of the
 cease-fire agreement since it was made anc
 to the best of my knowledge the (junta)
 forces have not fired into the U.S. line of
 communication."
 Vance could have added that rebel sniper:
 have killed 19 American soldiers and Ma-
 rines and wounded more than 100.
 He added that "U.S. trucks are interpose(
 in front of the (junta) air force planes a'
 San Isidro (air force base about 20 miles easi.
 of the capital) and they are not taking off.
 The trucks were placed near the planer
 after five of them last week strafed Radice
 Santo Domingo, then held by the rebels
 The  station  now  is  occupied  by  loyalist
 troops.
 Gen.  Bruce  Palmer,   commander  of  the
 U.S. military forces here, said all necessary
 steps would be taken to prevent any bom-
 bardnient by air or sea of downtown Sant(
 Domingo.
 Imbert and Armed Forces Secretary Com-
 modore Francisco J. Rivera Caminero said
 they expected to finish the battle against re-
 bel forces north of the U.S. corridor by this
 week end.

 men and their families.  The Communists
 would slaughter them.  The United States
 must also transport out of the country all
 Dominican    families ? who want to  leave.
 Where would pe  obpdy left."
 Saturday, May 22, Bundy held an un-
 attributed background press conference for
 a select few journalists "personally known
 to him," as a spokesman later revealed.  He
 told them that he w.ps rather optimistic that
 a "spilutipn" .would? be found to install a
 "consensus government."
 Ha implied that Oaamano had agreed to
 step down in favor of Guzman and rather
 believed that Imbert would do the same.
 Later, a high U.S. Official in Santo Domingo
 said that the United States was prepared to
 exert economic pressures against Imbert to
 force him out.
 . The story of the Bundy conference leaked
 out.  Reporters who had not been invited
 were not bound to the no-attribution rule.
 Newspapers reported that Imbert was on his
 way out.
 Imbert was furious.  The next day, Sun-
 day, he blasted  "malintentioned" reports
 (meaning certain reporters whom he felt
 were representing him and his junta as a
 rightist threat). He said that the people
 of the Dominican Republic knew that he was
 no dictator.  They knew he had risked his
 life to rid the country  of  the Trujillo
 dictatorship.
 ihbert Barreras and his staff were also
 incensed at efforts by reporters of thr-ie
 Influential U.S:`dellies`to prove that no Com-
 munist menace existed in the country.  He
 said privately 'that these reports apparently
 quickly enough."   The official  continued:
 "We were gambling-hoping that Imbert
 could form a government that could win
 public approval quickly."
 When queried regarding that statement, a
 junta member angrily replied: "You seem to
 want instant democracy.  How can a junta
 which was installed by you 10 days ago expect
 in that period of time to win a wave of
 popular support?"
 He went on: "Don't your negotiators from
 Washington know that there are no news-
 papers being published, no mass media com-
 muhications we can resort to, to explain our
 position and develop public understanding
 of the issues?"
 My Washington source also said that even
 if Imbert managed to defy the United States
 and remain in power, the result would be
 civil war.  Arms would be cached, plots
 hatched, and the revolt would spread.
 An officer of the Dominican counterinsur-
 geney force said that Cuban arms had been
 cached over a period of several years. He also
 said that in the sweep by Imbert forces across
 the northern part of the city, "tons of cached
 arms had been found."  He continued: "If
 our forces had not made the sweep, those
 arms would never have been found"  The
 counterinsurgency officer was trained In the
 United States.
 Regarding the lack of real support for
 Imbert, I asked my Washington source:
 "What about the fact that the 130,000-mem-
 ber National Confederation of Free Workers
 (CONTRAL)  is supporting Imbert?"  Here
 he got a little vague, and fell back on his
 earlier statement that Imbert did not win
 popularity fast enough.
 The inescapable conclusion is that Presi-
 dent Johnson's advisers are sensitively at-
 tuned to "world opinion."  They were in-
 fluenced by initial press reports which dog-
 gedly refused to recognize the Communist
 menace and tended to romanticize rebel
 leader Lt: Col. Francisco Caamano Deno.
 Thus influenced, Johnson's advisers went
 looking for compromise rather than solution.
 As of this writing, the rebels still control
 the center of Santo Domingo and have
 launched a potent propaganda campaign
 from their festering pocket of resistance.
 What started out as a vigorous and just
 action by President Johnson has bogged
 down in a mire of International and na-
 tional bureaucrats.  It could end in a dip-
 lomatic defeat as disasterous as our failure
 to follow through at the Bay of Pigs 4 years
 ago.  For the lesson of the Dominican Re-
 public to Latin American Communists and
 leftists is this: seize territory, no matter how
 much, and force the United States and the
 OAS to negotiate.

 REVOLT BY LEF'risTs TAKES 400 LIVES
 (By Jules Dubois)
 SANTO   DOMINGO,   DOMINICAN   REPUBLIC,
 April 29.-A band of rebels dressed in civilian
 clothes fired on the U.S. Embassy today.
 American marines fired back and repelled the
 attackers in a 30-minute fight.
 At least two of the attackers and possibly
 four were killed by the marines.  There were
 no casualties on the U.S. side.   Three other
 attackers were killed by Dominican Army
 troops as the leftists fled marine gunfire.
 Later,.other leftist bands that have been
 roaming the city fired sporadically at the
 Embassy but the attacks ended as night fell.

 I interviewed the tired general-who had
 .not'elept or eaten a solid meal since Satur-
 day night and wore a stubble beard-in his
 office at the army training center several
 miles from the San Isidro air base.  Wessin's
 telephone lines had been cut by the Com-
 munists and he had to use the air force head-
 quarters as a command post.
 -Wessin is no longer the strong man of the
 -military here, but he remains the most out-
 spoken  anti-Communist.   He  was  s:aoved
 into the background because he refuses to
 compromise with the leftists.
 He told me that he hoped to resign from
 the army soon, at the age of 41, and become
 a farmer. Wessin was educated at the mili-
 tary academy In Venezuela and at the Los
 Chorrillos Military School  in Lima, Peru,
 when Gen. Nicholas Lindley was comman-
 dant.  In 1962, General Lindley headed the
 military junta in Peru.
 Wessin blamed deposed President Donald
 J. Reid-Cabral for ignoring reports that an
 Army 'conspiracy was brewing against his rule.
 "The conspiracy was`very big," Wessin: said.
 "We saved the country by only a hairpin.
 There were conspirators even here at the
 training center.
 "The great majority of the people here did
 not know what was really happening.
 "I had reported the conspiracy to President
 for .I.5 or 2P eo   ut Ave days," Wessin
 11     but he did " not pay any attention'to'
 me rr
 Wessin had bitter words about Gen Marco
 Rivera-Cueata,' at the time array chief -of
 staff. Wessin said Rivera also was lax about
 the conspiracy.  The rebels captured Rivera
 last Saturday and" held hint hostage at the
 16th of August fortress, 18 miles from here.
 The air force blasted that fortress into use-
 lessness, Wessin said.
 TELLS THEIR AIM
 "This conspiracy was not an isolated one,
 nor was it exclusively military," Wessin said.
 "The conspirators were in league with the
 tron'r}muniat$ from the beginning.  As part
 plantation.   he fires there, alone caused $7
 million damage."
 Wessin said the primary objective of rebel
 officers was to restore former President Juan
 Bosch to power.
 "I consider this conspiracy was directed
 by him from Puerto Rico and that Fidel
 Castro [Communist premier of Cuba] also
 participated in it. Both have caused so much
 damage.  The Dominican people must now
 have come to realize that," Wessin said.
 While I visited diplomatic friends at the
 Argentine Embassy today, where eight rebel
 officers had received asylum, four of them
 asked permission to leave the Embassy. Em-
 bassy officials told me the officers wanted
 to return to rebel command - posts.  They
 were allowed to leave the Embassy.
 CONFIDENT OF VICTORY
 ''1e Argentine, diplomats  said that the
 rebel officers, who were dressed in civilian
 clothes, were confident that their side would
 ultimately win in the capital because the
 junta had up to now been unable to wipe
 them out.  They want to be on the winning
 side.
 "Wessin charged that Fidel Castro is in-
 volved In the revolution.  He said the armed
 forces intercepted a call to Castro that was
 made from the presidential palace after the
 Communists took possession Sunday after-
 noon.
 Wessin said leaders of the Communists
 entered the palace Sunday afternoon with
 Bosch's candidate for the interim presidency,
 Jose  Rafael-Molina-Morina.   Among  the
 leaders were Dato Pagan, who was one of the
 prisoners released from La Victoria by the
 military rebels, and the Ducoudray-Juan and
 Felix Servio, old guard members of the Com-
 munist party.
 I asked Wessin why he did not attack on
 Sunday morning as ordered by President
 Reid.
 "The navy started in this with us," Wessin
 said, "and then-decided to be neutral.  The
 same happened with the air force.  Then a
 group of the officers of the air force were
 ready to surrender and accept the conditions
 of the rebels."

 PURGES  DOMINGO  MILITARY-JUNTA  OUSTS
 Top BRASS IN PEACE EFFORT-SEEKS SUR-
 RENDER OF REBEL CHIEF
 (By Jules Dubois)
 SANTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, May
 9.-The government of national reconstruc-
 tion, headed by Brig. Gen. Antonio Imbert
 Barrera today purged the military forces of
 ranking officers.  It indicated that it will
 exhaust every peaceful effort to get the rebel
 forces of Col. Francisco A. Caamano to capit-
 ulate before trying to blast them out of the
 10 percent of this city which they hold.
 That 10 percent is almost the entire busi-
 ness district.  Imbert emphasized that his
 government controls the rest of the country's
 27 provinces.
 Imbert held a press conference with the
 four other members of the government.  He
 announced that six of the officers purged al-
 ready have been shipped out of the country
 in the best interests of the nation.
 NAMES OF OFFICERS
 They  were:  Belisario                 Peguero-Guerrero,
 former chief of police;                Salvador Augusto
 Montas-Guerrero, former army chief of staff
 and commander of the Operation Cleanup
 that never materialized here; Miguel Atila
 Luna-Perez, former chief of staff of the air
 force; Marcos River-Cuesta, former chief of
 staff, of the army; and Felix Hermida, Jr.,
 former director of intelligence.   All  were
 brigadier generals.
 Also shipped out was Commodore Julio
 Rib"Santamaria, former chief of staff of the
 navy.

 WON'T RESIGN DOMINGO JOB, GENERAL SAYS--
 Vows To CONTINUE FIGHTING REDS
 (By Jules Dubois)
 SANTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, May
 11.-This country's leading anti-Communist
 military commander will not resign from the
 service until the Reds are wiped out.
 This is the determined and uncompromis-
 ing position of Brig. Gen. Elias Wessin y Wes-
 sin, commander of the army training center.
 He so told me today in an exclusive interview
 at his headquarters outside the perimeter
 of the San Isidro Air Base.
 The U.S. Embassy had announced yester-
 day that Wessin had resigned in a move to
 bring peace to this embattled Republic but
 said earlier today that he had changed his
 mind.
 ---'  -   - -   STILL  IN  COMMAND
 "Wessin was in command at the base and
 his morale and that of his officers and men
 were high.
 "I have not resigned," he said.  "I do not
 intend to resign, and nobody is going to pres-
 sure me into resigning."
 Wessin said that both American Ambassa-
 dor W. Tapley Bennett, Jr.,  and Lt. Gen.
 Bruce  Palmer,  Jr., commanding  all  U.S.
 forces In the Dominican Republic, were very
 courteous to him yesterday. But, he added,
 he resisted pressure by them to quit and to
 leave the country.
 "I  did give Ambassador Bennett, at his
 request, a letter in which I certified that I
 would be willing to resign as soon as peace
 was restored to the country and the new
 government was on its road to reconstruc-
 tion," Wessin said.
 - -Wessin said that he has not been asked to
 resign by Brig. Gen. Antonio Imbert Barrera,
 President of the Government of national re-
 construction.
 WOULD HELP REDS
 "The. morale of my troops was at a low ebb
 yesterday," Wessin said.  "My resignation, or
 my enforced retirement, would not only be
 a major victory for the rebels but would in-
 vite the disintegration of the army."
 Wessin said that he was certain that his
 troops here at the army training center, who
 total about 2,000, and those in garrisons in
 the provinces, would, on learning of his
 resignation from the army, immediately lay
 down their arms and go home.
 "There would be no fight left in them," he
 added.
 "It would be the delivery of the country to
 the Communists on a golden platter."
 TIED UP BY TRUCE
 Wessin said that his troops are ready to
 clean up the rebel city but that the hands
 of the loyalist forces are tied by the truce of
 the Organization of American States.
 "While the rebels freely attack American
 troops along the corridor and the entire in-
 ternational security zone," Wessin said, "we
 are not even allowed to move."
 President Imbert said today that he has
 received no resignation from Wessin, but that
 he would be "glad to accept one."
 Imbert was reluctant to issue a decree
 yesterday that would have sent Wessin into
 enforced retirement.  He does not plan to do
 that unless he gets a signed resignation from
 Wessin.  Neither does he plan, at this time,
 to ask Wessin for his resignation.
 The move to force out Wessin was intended
 by the Embassay to placate rebels led by Col.
 Francisco A. Caamano, who calls himself the
 cgn$titutional president.

 FIDEL FOILED  IN DOMINGO--REDS  REMAIN
 DUBOIs TELLS OF MOVEMENT
 (By Jules Dubois)
 SANTO  DOMINGO,                     DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.-
 Fidel Castro had plans to be                    welcomed
 here as a conquering hero of a second Cuba
 on June 14, it was learned today.  Those
 plans have been dashed, but the Communist
 predominant Communist command of Col.
 Francisco A. Caamano's forces, had planned
 to have Castro present to help them celebrate
 another victory for the master planner's of
 Moscow and Peking.
 Castro was to arrive on June 10, by which
 time the 14th of June ' movemen t (known
 here as the A.P.C.J.) hoped. to be ruling the
 country.  They were going to dump both
 Caamano,and ex-President Juan Bosch.
 TWENTY IN ACTIVE ROLES
 Twenty of the top leaders of the 14th of
 June movement played active roles in the
 near takeover, a month ago. ? All of them
 were trained in the Soviet tTnfon, Red China,
 and Cuba.  One of them, Juan Miguel Ro-
 plan-Diaz, was killed last week in a com-
 mando assault on the presidential palace.
 Another casualty in the same attack' and
 from the same party was Rafael Mejfa-Llu-
 beres, who was gravely wounded.
 The 14th of June movement has what the
 members call its "Joan of Arc" ' She is Emma
 Tavares-Justo, 25, sister of Manuel`Tavares-
 Justo, who led the Communist guerrillas into
 the hills in November 1963 to fight "for the
 return of constitutional government."  Ta-
 vares was killed in a battle with the army.
 TO MARK' ANNIVERSARY
 The Communist plans called for a great
 rally on the 14th of June to commemorate
 the sixth anniversary of the Castro-mounted
 invasion that was dispatched from Cuba to
 overthrow the late dictator, Rafael Leonidas
 Trujillo.

 COMMUNISTS  HAD  ROLES  OF  LEADERS  FROM
 START    OF      DOMINICAN  REVOLT,  HERO
 CHARGES
 (By Jules Dubois)
 SANTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, June
 13.-The myth has been shattered that the
 Communists jumped on the bandwagon and
 took over after a revolt erupted here last
 April 24.  At least a dozen Reds were identi-
 "fled in leadership roles from the start.
 This has been documented in an interview
 with Col. Manuel'D-espradel, commander of
 the 16th century Ozama fortress the day the
 revolt began and hero of its siege before the
 rebels captured it at noon April 30.
 'WALL, ISB EACHED:
 Despradel lost the fort when a 75-mm. gun
 fired from a French tank which rebel Col.
 Francisco A. Caamano had captured from the
 troops of Brig. Gen. Elias Wessin y Wessin

 the rebel militia to pour into the courtyard
 and   subdue   the   demoralized,     starved
 defenders.
 Despradel has been recovering from wounds
 at the San Isidro air base hospital.  Per-
 mission for the interview was obtained from
 Commodore  Francisco J. Rivera-Caminero,
 secretary  of  the  armed  forces.    Colonel
 Despradel's story follows:
 "I know that on the night of April 24-25,
 Caamano    was with. Dr.   Daniel     Ozuna-
 Hernandez, a known international Commu-

 saw Caamano driving his car with his uncle,
 Capt. Deno Suero, seated beside him.  In the
 rear seat behind Caamano was Ozuna,

 Pedro Julio Istir Valention is reputed to be
 a close friend of Castro's.  His travels to
 Communist countries go as far back as 1947.
 With such well-trained Comniurl),ists head-.
 ing the way, the Dominican rebels quickly set
 up a Military headquarters and armed strong
 points.
 AN EDITOR Ik: KILLED
 They overran a police station, captured and
 shot policemen, seized police wgapons.,  An
 anti-Communist newspaper editor was ma-
 chinegunned to death.
 They stormed the Kates of the National
 Palace.  Newspaper buildings were sacked
 and their equipment' was used to put out
 propaganda  leaflets.   Banks  were  looted.
 Rebels took over the goternmen 's radio and
 television stations.
 U.S. officials describe the operations of the
 rebel leaders as being in "ty'?ical Castro
 style.  The rebels paraded captured loyalists
 before TV cameras. They haraniued'tV and
 radio and ences witl} Communist. slogans and
 denunclatons "oi  the bourgeois reaction-
 aries" and "Imperialists."
 Violence spread, and; American officials say,
 the character of the revolution changed.
 Co.ntinixhtsts and their extrenie leftist al-
 lies soon made up a significant pDrtion of the
 rebel forces.  The Communists were also
 decisively Influencing the political leadership
 of the"rebellion, which in the beginning had
 bean fun the hands of the boschparty leaders.
 . OBS COMMUNISTS COVET
 The' provisional government that had been
 set up by the rebels were induced to appoint
 several persons whose Communist sympathies
 and associations have .been wellestallished. 11 The positions they got were ones which are
 Important to Communists-such as attorney
 general and director of investigations.
 The original leaders of the revolt soon
 realized, th t their movement hehd beeii Cap-
 tured by L"ommunists.  So they gave up the
 fight and sought asylum.
 No important civilian leaders of that orig-
 inal group now remain with the rebels, ac-
 cording to U.S. officials. Martinez Francisco,
 PRD secretary general, summed up ' the sit-
 uation in a radio address to the nation on
 April 28:  He said:
 `I beg all to lay down their arms, because
 this is. no longer a fight between political
 parties."
 It was on that date, April $tii that U.S.
 marines moved in.  A political revoH? in just
 4 days, had been turned into a Communist
 takeover.
 The story of those 4 days, now revealed by
 U.S. officials, is what caused President John-
 son to act.
 [From U.S. News & World E.eport,

 AFTER THE BATTLE IN THE CA:IDD.EAN
 (It will be an uneasy peace, at best, for a
 long time in the Dominican Republic.  U.S.
 troops who rushed in won't rush out so fast.
 Howard HandleTrian,of the stair of U, $S. flews
 & World tepoi'{, 'tells why in taiIs.3lspateli
 from the scene.
 SANTO DOMINfo.-very sign here is that
 Americans will be saddled with, a ` policing
 job in this republic for a long time to come.
 A new government, when one can be estab-
 lished, will need time to prove :Itself.  Ten-
 aions are oo deep-seated for a conglomerate
 force of,  stir-American military -.snits to
 provide t' he stabilizing element needed.
 As many as 20,000 civilians now carry
 arms. Many arms will be hidden away. It is
 not going to be easy, either, to track down
 and immobilize the Copn unist ,leaders-a
 good many of them trained in Cuba or in
 Eastern Europe.
 WHAT VIOLENCE PROVED
 Some conclusions seem clear to one who
 knows the island and who has gone through
 the recent days of violence.
 The first is that there is no real base on
 which political Stability can rest in a country
 with            a  rapidly rising  population  and  an
 economy depending for the most part on
 sugar, the price of which  is severely de-
 pressed.
 The United States is probably going to be
 forced to make a sharp increase in aid.
 Another point being made is that there is
 no room for a "dreamer" at the head of any
 new government.   When Juan Bosch  was
 President, people got  the idea that there
 was pie in the sky, when actually the out-
 look without sizable U.S._ help would seem to
 be hopeless.
 A firm, conclusion is that U.S. military
 intervention was unavoidable if slaugh-`,er of
 foreigners was to  be prevented.  It is re-
 garded as a good thing that U.S. power was
 adequate to deal with heavily armed, Com-
 munist-organized mobs.  If action had not
 been fast and in force, loss of life would have
 been much heavier, and a takeover, by Reds
 an accomplished fact.
 With slower action, experts say, there read-
 ily could have been another Castro-type base
 for Reds in the Caribbean.
 When US. troops had been on Dominican
 soil,   days, President Johnson, on May 3,
 officially stated that the role of those troops
 was to prevent a Communist takeover  as.
 well as to save lives.  In a speech, Mr.'Johnson said:
 "The American nations cannot, must not,
 and will not permit the establishment of an-
 other Communist Government in the West-
 ern Hemisphere."
 The President with those words reaffirmed
 U.S. policy justifying intervention in Com-
 munist  revolutions  anywhere  In   Latin
 America the United States chooses to Move.
 That policy was not in effect in January 1959,
 when Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba.
 FOR U.S. TROOPS, NO ENEMIES
 The performance of U.S. military services
 In Santo Domingo was a model of restraint.
 Marines of the Second Division and soldiers
 of the 82d Airborne Division have not been
 permitted to shoot unless shot at first.  On
 the night of 1Vfay 4, troops were ordered to
 end combat patrols outside their lines. This
 was Considered a risky restraint in the midst
 of heavily armed guerrillas. Idea was to keep
 U.S. troops from appearing aggressive.
 Rebels have not been referred to as the
 enemy. 'An airborne division spokesmen, to
 avoid using the word enemy, even went so far
 as to describe snipers who machinegtinned
 U.S. paratroopers as people who are anti-
 82d Division.
 Americans have big guns and tanks but
 have  not  been  permitted  to  use  them.
 Troops were cautioned, also, to avoid a nor-
 mal practice of'blowing up' houses filled with
 snipers. Officers said that marines and para-
 troopers were limited to hand-held weapons

 fired against boats that sailed into the mouth

 from Cuba.
 By May 6, the number of American service-
 men here, either ashore or afloat, was more
 than 30,000. ' The Army had 14,345 ppara-

 keeping force set up by the Organization of
 American States. Others will be replaced by
 Latin-American troops.
 U.S. DEATH TOLL
 Casualties among U.S. forces between April
 28, when first marines came ashore, and May
 6 included 13 dead, more than 60 wounded.
 That tall was mounting despite a so-called
 firm cease-fire.                             On May 6, four marines were
 killed when their patrol made a wrong turn
 into the rebel-held zone of Santo Domingo.
 Rebel machineguns cut themdown without
 warning.
 Refusal of the rebels to observe the cease-
 fire was taken as new evidence of Commu-
 nists' taking over what started out as a popu-
 lar revolt against the military junta that had
 been in power.
 A semblance of order was restored here
 only after U.S. troops established an Im-
 penetrable cordon around rebel-held terri-
 tory                                                                                                                                     in  the  heart  of  downtown  Santo
 Domingo. In effect, American servicemen
 bottled up the rebels.
 Until that cordon was established, danger
 was great that the capital would fall to the
 insurgents. More than  1,000  citizens lay
 dead in the streets.  Rebels had broken the
 back of Government resistance and captured
 the police stronghold of La Fortaleza Ozana
 after a 4-day siege.  Large quantities of guns
 and ammunition were captured.
 When the truce was signed, rebels held an
 area of about 2 square miles in the teeming
 heart of this city of 400,000.  U.S. marines
 had carved out and are holding an Interna-
 tional refugee zone to the west of the rebels,
 and are linked by a 3-mile corridor to U.S.
 paratroopers to the east of the rebels and at
 San Isidro Air Base.
 RICE IN THE CORRIDOR
 This 3-mile corridor is a busy place now.
 A large part of it includes the gay quarters
 of the town, and as long as American soldiers
 stay clear of diehard rebels they do not seem
 to be unwelcome to Dominicans.  Stores are
 open, and the troops are making purchases
 and many are making friends.
 On an average day, at 10 points along the
 "armed corridor," U.S. troops handed out
 20 tons of rice to civilians-all comers, no
 questions asked-as well as tons of beans and
 powdered milk.
 In U.S.-held  areas, Dominicans seem to
 respond warmly to the idea that U.S. civil-
 ians, as well as they, are stopped at check-
 points for identification.
 American troops are trying to overcome
 Initial fear and resentment.  They are seek-
 ing to leave a good impression with local
 citizens.
 At first there was fear the Americans would
 charge into the city to wipe out the rebels.
 In that  case,  thousands  upon  thousands
 could have been slaughtered.
 Instead, U.S. troops went swiftly about the
 job of evacuating more than 4,000 foreign
 civilians, including 2,694 Americans   and
 1,373 from 41 other nations.  Anyone who
 wanted to leave got a hand from the United
 States.
 ,RELIEF: WILL IT BE REAL?
 American officers have been waiting for
 the first Latin American military contin-
 gents to start showing up in force, after an
 OAS vote of May 6 to pitch in with truce-
 keeping chores.
 There was skepticism, however, about any
 idea that the United States would be able
 to cut back in its own commitment substan-
 tially, in any case.
 Some Latin American states voted against
 the peacekeeping idea altogether, and some
 big  countries-Mexico, for one--indicated
 they Wouldn't  send any troops.  Intense
 jealousies and rivalries among Latin Ameri-
 cans raised further doubts in the minds of
 some U.S. officials about the ability of many
 OAS members to pull their weight. For now,
 Americans here agree, It will be the United

 ing the country from going down the drain.
 What Latin limericanpeacekeepers will
 find is a, situation that U.S. diplomats de-
 scribe as "an unholy mess."
 The republic Is drifting without a leader-
 and two sides claiming power.
 The United. States Is officially neutral but
 has granted a sort of "working recognition"
 to a military junta backed by Brig. Gen.
 Elias Wessin y Wessin.  It was General Wes-
 sin y Wessin who kept the rebels from power
 until U.S. forces arrived.
 Rebels are led by Col. Francisco Caamafio
 Deflo, who was Inaugurated as "provisional
 President" by his supporters on May 4.  Be-
 hind Colonel Caamafio and 400 other mili-
 tary rebels are between 10,000 and 20,000
 armed civilians who now appear to be under
 the control of foreign-trained Communists,
 intent on keeping the revolt going at any
 cost.
 Colonel Caamano, ,although a U.S.=trained
 career officer, does not stand high with the
 United States.  He is not known to be a
 Communist, but U.S. officials say Caamafio
 "seems to be moving closer to the Commu-
 nists."  One of his chief advisers is Commu-
 nist leader Fidelio Despradel, a Castroite.
 U.S. officials here report that Caamafio
 conferred with Despradel and. other Red lead-
 ers who asked for jobs in his government if
 he ? won power, and that he assure their es-
 cape from the country if he lost.  Caamafio
 was said to have agreed to this in return
 for Red backing.
 CONTINUING THREAT
 Danger of a Communist takeover still ex-
 ists.. American officials here sad they have
 ,,no doubt of that.          The whole rebellion is
 said to At into a blueprint for subversion
 that'was drawn up in Havana last November
 at a secret meeting of '22 Latin American
 Communist parties.
 > As U.S. officials reconstruct the revolution
 here, the Castro-Communist influence stands
 out in a striking way.
 When 18 rebels took over the government
 television station on April 24, to start things,
 the two announcers who were used were
 chosen because they were easily recognized
 as Communists.
 The whole Communist organization here
 was geared to move on short notice, and the
 three main Red groups, previously split,
 united to move together.
 Known Communists stood on trucks and
 passed out guns and ammunition to any
 Dominicans who wanted them.  At the Na-
 tional Palace,  16 well-known Communist
 leaders were deliberately conspicuous in the
 way they gave orders' to rebel elements.  On
 television, in those first days, Reds wore
 Castro-type fatigue caps' to give a Castro
 flavor to the revolt.
 American officials believe the Reds did all
 this to make the point that this was "their
 revolution."
 WHAT UNITED STATES WANTS
 Trouble with the Communists, piled on
 top of the country's natural problems, adds
 up to a formidable chore for-the United States
 in the period ahead.  Getting the OAS to
 sllare peacekeeping  tasks--even in  token
 form-is the first step toward a solution.
 What the United States would like to see, be-
 yond a durable armed truce, is ' a political
 compromise that would bring a moderate
 provisional regime to power until free elec-
 tions, can be held-preferably under. OAS
 auspices.
 The big U.S. problem is to find a politician
 capable of running the Dominican Republic
 wi ix, a firm hand-even an iron hand, if
 necgSgary=and enable the United "States to
 withdraw its troops soon.
 Assurance of any lasting `political settle-
 meat ip regaided as dim.  Fighting, it is
 felt, has solved"nothing, merely deepened old
 resentments:
 Now,  with  Reds  committed  to  action,
 there's prospect of prolonged guerrilla-style
 war in the countryside.
 U.S. occupation of the Dominican Repub-
 lic once before was undertaken with hopes -
 of getting out quickly. That occupation,
 started in 1916, lasted for 8 years.
 Once again, the United States is finding
 that getting in is a lot easier than getting
 out.
 [From U.S. News & World Report,
 May 17, 19631
 WHO WILL RULE Now IN DOMINICAN
 REPUBLIC?
 (Next big job: finding the man who can
 put the Dominican Republic back together
 again and still keep  Communists at bay.
 United States wants no part of present rebel
 leader  or  former  President Juan  Bosch.
 Both have been tainted by the Reds.)
 SANTO DOMINGO.-American  offlicals here
 are convinced beyond any  possible doubt
 that the man who rose to the top of the
 Dominican rebellion-Col. Francisco Caam-
 afio Defio-is only a front for the real con-
 spirators, the Communists behind his move-
 ment.
 Colonel Caamafio was sworn in by the
 rebels  as  "provisional  President"  of  the
 Dominican Republic on May 4.
 To reach that point, according to evidence
 in U.S. hands,  the colonel was forced to
 make a marriage of convenience with the
 Communists.  And now an old-line Commu-
 nist, Fidelio Despradel Roques, is his key
 PROMISE TO REDS
 This, say U.S. investigators, is what hap-
 pened:
 Early in the second week of the rebellion,
 Caamano met with half a dozen of the top
 Communist leaders in Santo Domingo.  They
 were men who represented the three Com-
 munist parties on this island-followers of
 the Chinese Reds, the Kremlin Communists,
 and Fidel Castro's Cubans.
 Caamafio made a deal:
 If the revolution succeeds, the Commu-
 nists will have key positions in his Govern-
 ment.
 If the revolution fails, Caamano has agreed
 to insist that the Organization of American
 States guarantee safe passage for the Red
 leaders so they can get out of the country.
 . Despite Caamafio's claims and activities,
 the United States says there is no effective
 government  in  the  Dominican  Republic.
 Americans here are determined, as one puts
 it, "to help the Dominicans find a democrat-
 ic solution to their problems."  But finding
 it is going to be difficult, indeed.
 The United States is opposed to accepting
 either Caamafio or former President Juan
 Bosch as the political leader of this troubled
 country.  While neither is considered a Com-
 munist, each owes big political debts to the
 Reds.   Of Bosch, one American said, "He
 has done things that favored the Commu-
 Dominicans not involved in the
 Thoughtful
 current disorder are casting about now for
 a man who can lead their nation back to
 order.
 Former President Joaquin Balaguer, pres-
 ently in exile in New York, is sometimes
 mentioned as a possibility.   He has been
 keeping his political image alive here through
 taped broadcasts for a year or more.  He is
 believed to retain a good deal of popularity.
 Ggn, ,A,l}toni,Q  njiZert?one of the two_sur-
 viving members of the group that assassi-
 nated former dictator Rafael Trujillo, also is
 being mentioned.  He too is considered po-
 litically popular.
 THE REAL VILLAIN
 There is no easy solution to today's chaos.
 The more                         you hear  about what's  been
 going on in the Dominican Republic, the
 more you come to this conclusion: The real
 20525
 villain is dictator Trujillo, even though he
 is 4 years dead. Every line you follow seems
 to lead, in the end, to the old dictator. Under
 Trujillo, graft became a privilege of the gen-
 erals.  One reason for the downfall of Presi-
 dent Donald Reid Cabral 1s that he tried to
 take this privilege away.  He got rid of
 two generals and fired the powerful chief of
 the  national police.  But it was  enemies
 within the armed forces who toppled him
 from office.
 Among the things Reid Cabral wanted to
 eliminate was a contracts racket operated
 by top military men.   Until Reid Cabral took
 office, military contracting officers had a free
 hand in buying supplies from abroad.  The
 standard practice was to buy only from sales-
 men who would give the contracting officer a
 kickback of 10 or 12 percent.
 This is but one example of  the kind of
 widespread corruption that has riddled the
 country in recent years.  The Dominican Re-
 public had no foreign debts at the time
 Trujillo was assassinated.  Four years later,
 its debts totaled almost half a billion dollars.
 As President, Reid Cabral ended the con-
 tracts racket, but the fact he did so helped
 bring him down.
 SON OF "THE BUTCHER"
 The  Trujillo  era  even  casts  a  shadow
 over the new rebel leader, Colonel Caamano.
 He  is the                            son of the  late  Gen. Fausto
 Caamano, known to Dominicans as El Car-
 nicero-"The Butcher"-In the days of Tru-
 jillo.                                                                                                                               Like most professional Army men in
 the Dominican Republic, Colonel Caamafio
 has a Trujillo background-one he has tried
 to Qbscure-and he has powerful enemies.
 You don't have to be on this island long
 to sense the conflicts and bitterness that
 permeate the place.
 These conflicts ousted Bosch in 1963.  They
 brought the downfall of Reid Cabral at the
 start of the current rebellion, even before the
 Communist elements came to the surface.
 They persist now, leaving many powerful Do-
 minicans hating each other.
 That is why it will be a long, long time
 before a stable government can be set up, to
 guide this troubled country.

 CARIBBEAN RIDDLE: How To LET Go
 SANTO  DOMINGO.-Communists  remain a
 very real threat to the Dominican Republic,
 4 weeks after the U.S. Marines moved in to
 block a Red takeover here.
 Known Communists are commanding an
 estimated 80 to 90 percent of the rebel posts,
 even though they are not always the men
 who appear publicly to be in charge.
 There is some danger-presently calculated
 as slight-that the Communists will move
 out into the countryside and try to spread
 the revolt, even if it is choked off here in
 the capital.
 What heightens the Communists' oppor-
 tunities for troublemaking is the almost im-
 possible job of putting together a broad-
 based coalition government.  Several times
 in recent days negotiators have been on the
 brink of getting a cabinet organized, only to
 have everything collapse because of prema-
 ture publicity.
 Under the circumstances, it is clear now
 that it probably will be a long time before
 the bulk of the 30,000 U.S. troops on the
 scene can go home.
 U.S. officials were heartened by the decision
 of Brazil on May 21 to send a substantial
 force-probably as many as 1,250 men-to
 join a Latin American peacekeeping mission
 here.  By that date, only token forces were
 on the ground, and they had not been orga-
 nized.
 Even when the U.S. goal of a broad-based
 coalition government is attained, Dominican
 problems remaining will seem insurmount-

 Mi'. BoNrr,zA ATI ES. Mr. incident, Dele-  The PRESIDENT. Ambassador Ricardo Co-
 gates: I think that of all the delegates pres-                        lombo has the floor.
 Mr.  COLOMBO. Mr. President, with deep
 feeling the Delegation of Argentina wishes
 to add to the words of the Ambassador of
 Brazil concerning the outstanding -work of
 the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, that mes-
 senger of peace in the Dominican Republic.
 The only tribute-because everything has
 already been said-that I can pay under the
 circumstances, is to repeat here, Mr. Chair-
 man, before the entire meeting, his. final
 words of good-bye to us: Take--he said to
 me-my blessing to the Meeting of Foreign
 Ministers that they may achieve the high
 objectives of peace; the peace that, at all
 costs, must be preserved in this Republic
 where I hold this apostleship.  Nothing more,
 Mr, President.
 The PRESIDENT. Ambassador Vazquez Car-
 rizosa, Special Delegate of Colombia, has the
 about the future of the Dominican Republic
 without speaking of him who so perfectly
 represents the ideal of Pope John XXIII con-
 cerning the coexistence of men of good will.
 But I have asked for the floor to speak on a
 point which may not be appropriate at this
 time but would be at another.  Our report
 ends with several recommendations, which I
 .do not propose to discuss at this session, but
 I do want to point them out, to the Chair
 so that at the time and in the way provided
 for in the regulations or when it is consld-
 ered opportune, they may be submitted to
 the Tenth Meeting of Consultation for dis-
 cussion, because they do not deal with po-
 litical questions, such as those we have dis-
 cussed intensely, but specific points on the
 future organization of activities in the Do-
 minican Republic.  They are specific points
 of the greatest urgency, such as supervision
 of the cease-fire, the appointment of a group
 qualified to organize the relief measures for
 the Dominican people and evaluate their
 needs, the study and planning of an Inter-
 American Force and the coordination of all
 its services. Detailed, careful, and. immediate
 consideration of these points seems to me
 absolutely necessary.  Thank you very much.
 The PRESIDENT. The Special Delegate of
 Guatemala, member of the Committee, has
 the floor.
 Mr. GAScfA BAUER. At this time I only wish
 to refer to the tribute that my colleagues,
 the members of the Committee, have Already
 paid to the Papal Nuncio and Dean of the
 Diplomatic Corps in Santo Domingo, Monsig-
 nor Emmanuel Clarizio, for the great work
 that he has performed since this grave con-
 flict began in the Dominican Republic.  The
 Papal Nuncio was exceptionally kind to the
 Committee, offering it every facility within
 his power, and it was through his great serv-

 the purposes for which the Organization of
 American States was in Dominican territory

 authority was in power.  He is a person who
 has the confidence of the different parties
 and through his good offices, because of the
 great collaboration he rendered, the Commit-
