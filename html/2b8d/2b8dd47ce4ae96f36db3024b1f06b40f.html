 PREFACE
 The leading role and internal power position of the Communist Party of China
 c.cpj
 fONWLj was defined by Mao Tee -tung in his opening address to the First National
 People's Congress in Sept. 1954 when he stated that "the core of our strength which
 CaP
 leads us in our cause is the Communist Party of China. "But what are !     objectives
 44      east .Asia? At the Peking Trade Union Conference of Asian and Australasian
 COP
 countries in November 19491. Liu SbaWwc'hi, vice chairman of the 4109. advocated
 that "the path taken by the Chinese people to defeat imperialism and its lackeys"
 should be followed "by the peoples of the   r 'us colonial and semi-colonial countries
 in their fight for national independence and people democracy." While the Manifesto
 of this same conference advised the "workers of the oppressed countries of Asia"
 to adopt the China way orestsblishing a territorial base and an army "when you
 can no longerearry on youi action in the cities under the white terror" there wade
 no clear mention made of whether or rot Peiping would assume direction of the
 national liberation movement. That the Chinese revolution is to be a       is
 however, indicated by two Communist announcements.  The Cominform Journal in
 January 1954 accords Mao Tse-t
 CPYRGHT
 prestige as an original strategist who
 ttcreatively and   a new way, characterized
 as a revolution of a special type, now typical for revolution in colonial
 and sernicolonial countries."
 The article quoted Malenkov's statement that the
 CPYRGHT
 "victory of the \ese revolution opened up a new page, not only     e
 history of the people of China but of all the peoples of Asia."
 The role of Chinese practice as the standard for Asian, African and South
 American Communist parties is given in a Daily Worker Article of 5 August 1955,
 ntitle+ The Indonesian National Liberation Movement and
 fi
 .published 'for consumption in Indonesia
 In this article, William Z. Foster, Secretary General of the Communist Party of
 the U.S., describes
 CPYRGHT
 of
 ttPeoples China, co-partner with the Soviet Union, as the great leader
 of the world national liberation movement.  With its world Marxist-
 Leninist fighter Mao Tse-tung at its head, it is the Race setter for the
 A SA p&    W  4nnrt  f 'f ?~'A ` 'i   =ni iA~M8 e's democracy

 CPYRGHT
 and Socialism, the road that all other peoples of Asia and eventually
 also of Africa and Latin America will finally travel."
 Communist sources thus make it clear that whether the direction of Asian,
 African and South American CPs lies in Peking or Moscow or is divided between
 them, the role of the Chinese Party in Asia will be a large one, and its practices
 are to serve as the model which Asian "national" parties are expected to copy.
 What sort of men do leaders of this influential Party want as their followers?
 What are some of the practices which the national parties of Asia and Africa are
 expected to follow?
 A clue to both these questions comes from a study of the training and
 indoctrination given new party members and from examination of the standards,
 ideals, principles and practces expounded by present Party leaders for those
 on whom they rely to carry out their policies.  The Chinese Communists are
 remarkably frank about the rigid uncompromising standards of performance
 and discipline which a party member is expected to attain, and this collection
 of articles describes also how they have perfected a technique which applied to
 ordinary human beings turns them into disciplined, militant activists, un-
 questioning in their execution of the Party Line.
 Already Chinese Communist doctrinal exhortations are required study for
 members of such Asian parties as those of Japan and Indonesia; given the
 opportunity, the techniques used by the Chinese Communist Party, "pace setter
 of the entire colonial world" can be expected to become a part of the arsenal
 of organizational weapons of each Communist Party in Asia and Africa.
 A note on the nature of this publication
 This pamphlet is composed chiefly of a collection of three selections on
 Communist methods of recruitment, indoctrination and discipline which were
 prepared separately as parts of other works.  They are brought together here
 for the light they throw on what is expected of a Chinese Communist Party member.
 The first selection gives a general description of      methods of recruitment,
 training and discipline.  In the next section are given the Party's ideals for the
 performance of individual members, as described in exhortations by two of the
 Party's leading theoretician-propagandists.

 The final section is a description of how the Chinese Communist Party
 leaders brought ordinary men to fit the ideal during a critical period of Party
 history; just after coming to power.  As such,  it is in a sense a case study of
 techniques used to meet particular circumstances, but it has a broad application
 to the present and future.

 The first selection of this pamphlet describes the party's post-war
 approach to the problems of recruitment, training and reform.  In reading
 this selection special attention should be given to the continuous process
 of ideological remoulding which is characteristic of CCP discipline and the
 various forms which this process takes at different stages of the party
 member's care.~re
 of Chinese Communism by Brandt, Schwartz and Fairbank, de-
 scribes the ideal of Communist behavior in speeches which were
 given by two of the party's leading theoriticians in 1939.  Chen Yun,
 the author of How to be a Communist Party Member, is a member
 cP
 of Politburo and Secretariat of the 006 and is also a vice -Premier
 specializing in economic affairs.  Liu Shao-chi, who wrote On the
 Training of a Communist Parma -Member, is vice -Chairman of the

 Central Committee of the , in addition to being a member of the
 Politburo and Secretariat and the party's leading theoritcian.  The
 chief significance of these articles is that they reaffirmed the
 Leninist foundations of the party at a time when the propaganda line
 occadmned by the anti-Japanese United Front created the impression
 that the CPC, in attending to the more immediate national peril had
 coxnpromieed its ultimate oar Communist aims.  The articles were
 emphasized during thet1period and after the switch in the party line,
 during the civil war in China and the intense "cold war" with the
 West.  They continue to be used as major indoctrinatiMa tools, even
 though once again in 1955 the United Front tactic hat been resurrects

 use of these articles through these diffe rent periods illustrates the
 uncompromising nature of party disciplinary requirements.  The
 central theme of both articles is the need for members "to subordinate
 their individual interests to those of the party; to carry out party
 resolutions not only in the time of victory but also in the hour of
 defeat. +'

 and is concerned with the methods
 by which the Chinese Communists insure execution of their domestic
 policies through the use of "Psychological Control".
 Cc P
 After assuming power in 1949, the      found itself with a vast
 area to govern and few trained and disciplined people to administer
 it according to the rigid and tough-minded policies they had adopted.
 For this reason they established a series of camps and schools in
 which they segregated and indoctrinated almost one million potential
 cadres per year for over three years.  The article which is based
 primarily on party documents and personal interviews in Hong Kong
 with refugees who had actually attended these schools, describes
 the indoctrination principles followed and the adaal training process.
 The techniques of coercion beginning with physical control of the
 trainees and proceeding through progressive stages of physical
 and mental fatigue, tension, uncertainty, study of Marxist-Leninist
 documents etc. , until an emotional crisis is reached, are described
 here in accurate detail.  According to the testimony of these refugees,
 "the soul becomes public property" and ultimately the subject
 discards his "reactionary" past for an entirely new or Communist
 set of values.  Thorough inculcation of absolute loyalty to the party
 and absolute acceptance of party discipline were placed ahead of
 any training in the practical arts of government administration.
 Specifically designed to speedily indoctrinate large numbers of
 cadres during a period of tremendous party expansion and increase
 of responsibility. some features of the program may have been
 discarded, but it is assumed that the various techniques are still

 The COP,  with  an official membersp of six and one-half
 millions in 1954, and an extimated 6,800,000 members in 1955,  is almost

 The party/expeeieneed a tremendous expansion between 1945
 and 1955, particularly during the first 6 post war years when membership
 rose from 1,200,000 to  5,800,000, or three-quarters of a million per
 year.   Because of this expansion,  the rank and file membership is
 composed largely of relative newcomers.   Less than 20%  have over
 10 years service in the party.   Assimilation of these millions of
 new members into the party has posed many problems for the party
 ley.dership .  Many new members were poorly educat*d and many more

 undesirable and of training and indoctrinating the remainder of the
 recruits  has  been given constant and recurring attention by the

 party xi mm 1951, when a three-year. profram of party consolidation
 and reform was begun,, thru 1955, when      party organs were
 included among the groups into which counterrevolutionaries had found their
 way. (See below, under Pa'ty Personnel).
 Another striking t'eature  of the  CCP is the high percentage of
 women and youth.  As of June 1951,  about one tenth of the membership
 was female and about 1 of every six was under -:25.
 In true orthodox fashinn, the COP claims to be the " organized
 vanguard of the working class" , but most of its membership is derived
 from vnral?origins.  As  of 1948, over 90% of the rank and file membership
 considted of persons recruited in rural areas.  Even as late as July 1951,
 two years after taking over urban areas, almost 80%~ of the total wera
 persons with pensant backgrounds, and the percentage has not dropped below
 at that time,

 Chinese flommuni-t theoreticians have re orted to many devious x  kDIds
 rationalizations to reconcile theory with reality .   One expedient has
 been to describe the peasants xxdxm as members of the ,-rural proletariat".
 Another has been to discount social factors and emphasize ideological
 and orgauizatl-onal factors.  Thus party leader Lit "hao-ch'i argued that:
 "`..Phe social origins of party membership are not all-important.
 The true determining factors are our party's political struggles
 and its political and ideo&gical leadership.  Our party's
 program will guaran`ee the predominance of the proletarian
 outlook.    " (On the Party, 1945).

 attention to building the urban-worker component of the part,: base.

 Now that we are victorious, It Is possible that some
 party members may choose to Indulge in a life of
 ease rather than live the old life of hirdship....
 It is possible that some of our members who were
 invulnerable to the real bullets of the enemy may
 now be vulnerable to the sugar-coated bullets of the
 bourgeoisie.
 As later developments proved, these fears were
 not unfounded.  During 1950 and :1951 there was
 increasing concern with the danger of "bourgeois
 corrosion" of the party.  Party leader Kao Kang,
 speaking in January 1952, declared that:
 gly c4 'e warnings, the party has been in
 creasin      kded by bourgeois Ideologies and In-
 fluences.
 The campaign against waste, corruption, and red
 tape In government launched during the winter of
 19pi-52  revealed fairly  widespread  corruption
 among nilddle-ranking party officials In - many of
 the larger urban centers such as Tientsin and
 The danger of "bourgeois corrosion" was hot en-
 tirely an urban phenomenon; It had a counterpart
 in the villages.  After the completion of land re-
 1        the first stage of the agrarian revolution,
 there was a natural tendency for the rural party
 cadres to relax and to feel that ,the revolution

 tendency toward soft living, and "arrogant atti-

 in addition to the dangers of "bourgeois corro-
 sion," the party also had to face the personnel
 problems created by the establishment of a vast
 bureaucratic apparatus.  Many party members de-
 veloped "bureaucratiic tendencies" that sorely per-

 that   ??  many   ?        cadres" in the central  ?
 flees were content to sit in their offices and merely
 issue directives, without making any attempt to
 check upon their implementation.            Other reports
 from party leaders noted that local cadres were
 using Illegal methods to carry out party programs
 and were violating laws.  The problem ? Ing such "bureaucratic tendencies" Is viewed as a

 Another aspect  ?                                              discipline and morale causing
 borne the party leadership considerable trouble is the

 It was aimed in part at eradicatin

 The fourth party reforn,Iwas completed in the spring of 1954, was launched at a
 national conference on party organization held in March 1951.  This reform movement
 was ostensibly designed to consolidate the party branches, to raise the general quality
 of party membership,and to strengthen the party organization as a whole for the forth-
 coming tasks of industrializat.iin.  Other underlying considerations probably prompting
 the reforms were: 1) a desire on the part of the party leadership to prevent the rank
 and file from relaxing; 2) a desire to discipline those party veterans who were showing
 signs of discontent and insubordination; and 3) a concern with growing corruption among
 the party membership and a general falling off of revolutionary zeal.
 The specific aims and objectives of this reform program varied somewhat from time
 to time and from area to area.  One of the basic aims was to familiarize the member-
 ship with the new and stricter standards of performance adopted in 1951 and then to
 appraise each member in terms of those standards.  Members who fell hopelessly short
 of meeting the standards were expelled from the party; those, however, who evidenced
 a willingness to reform themselves were given a chance to do so.  According to 1952
 party directives the reforms were also aimed at eradicating corruption and "rightist"
 deviations (such as usury-and exploitation), improving party control over rural
 organizations, andk giving the rural party cadres a better understanding of Communist
 policies and objectives.
 According to official Communist statements, this reform movement passed through
 four major stages   In the first stage-preparation and mobilization--party reform
 cadres were trained through conducting "experimental" reforms in key areas, and reports
 in the Communist press during December 1951 indicated that experimental reforms in
 two or three large cities had resulted in the`             'on of 8% to 10% of party
 members.  By early 1953 the preparation and mobilization stage had been completed in

 most areas.  Raidaudx  This initial phase was followed by a "study" stage, in which
 party members received indoctrination on party objectives and goals and were expected
 to study assigned works on Communist theory and policy.  The third stage was one of
 "rere istration " in which each                                     +0-Ce.~upt
 g          ,                  party member made a detailed    mort of his political
 and social background and decided for himself whether he felt qualified to continue
 as a party member.  The fourth and probably the most important phase was one of
 "appraisal," and it was centered in the party branch.  The past history and performanne
 of each party member was discussed individually by the branch meeting.  Then, under the
 direction of specially assigned party reform cadres, the branch prepared a written
 report on each member, including recommendations for disciplinary action if needed.
 This report ix was forwarded to a higher party committee, which decided whether or
 not the party member shall remain in good standing.  These appraisals were supposed
 to be conducted in accordance with the higher standards of performance adopted in
 March 1951.
 During the period from January 1952 to June 1952, the party reform movement was
 closely integrated with the so-called "Three Anti" movement, which was aimed at
 eradicating corruption, waste and red-tape from the ranks of the governmental
 btac bureaucracy.  The "Three Anti" movement, which was directed by a national
 committee headed by party leader Po I-po, resulted in the expulsion or demotion of
 a fairly large number of party members holding middle-ranking positions in govern-
 ment and with about 10 to 15 years of service.  Only about half the defendants were
 accused of "corruption."  Other alleged crimes included insubordination, sabotage of
 party policies, hepotism, suppression of criticism from lower levels, empire
 building, and "bourgeois decadence" (soft living).
 "Because of the paucity of available information, it is difficult accurately to
 gauge the effect of the "Three Anti" movement on the party organization.  The number
 of party members actually expelled from the party appears to have been well under 5%
 of the total party membership, and perhaps as low as 1% or 2%.  However, the stern-
 ness with which the reforms were conducted arrarently caused a considerable loss of
 morale among lower- and middle-ranking party bureaucrats.  Information from fairly
 reliable sources has indicated that there was an epidemic of suicides among party
 members in certain areas of South China during the early part of 1952.  Many party
 members have tried to avoid being assigned to responsible positions in government, Jug
 lest they becc#e vulnerable to attack.  The reforms may also have created a general
 inertia and apathy among the lower levels of the party, especially in urban areas.
 As the "Three Anti" movement drew to a close after June 1952, the party reform
 campaign was increasingly oriented toward the party's national economic planning
 program and the development of precollective types of rural organization.  An important
 editorial in the party press in July 1952 stated that "the work of consolidating the
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-00915R000500010021-6
 party must go hand in hand with the basic construction work of the state, and in
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-009'  R000500010027-6
 particular with construction work centered on industrialization...."  In September
 1952 party organizations at the regional level issued directives stressing the need
 for i "strengthening party leadership in various fields of national construction and
 urging party members to master technical skills and industrial management procedures.',
 From about October or November of 1952, the tempo of party reform activity
 apparently increased, especially in rural areas.  Official reports indicated that
 "a general adjustment of Party organization and of the ideological levels of Party
 members" was launched among rural ground-level organizations of the party in November
 1952, and stated k  that this had the result of "pushing the rural economy along
 the path of collectivization."  Subsequent reports indicated that party reforms in
 rural areas of Northeast China would be completed by the spring of 1953.  In January
 1953 it was officially announced that the "streamlining" of party organizations in the
 northeast had been virtually completed in rural areas.  In February it was announced
 that party organizations in North and Northwest China had "completed the first stages
 of party reform" and were starting on the second stage.
 An important report by An Tzu-wen, Deputy Director of the Party Organization
 Department, released in February 1953, stated that party reform had been completed in
 40,000 out of a total of 180,000 rural party organizations in China.  Results to date,
 said An, indicated that about 90% of the total party membership measured up to standards
 set by the party leadership.  Of the 10% who did not measure up, about 3% to 5% or
 less than 1% of the total party membership, had been expelled from the party as "un-
 desirable elements."  The remainder had withdrawn on the grounds that they had become
 "passive" or "backward".

 The fourth and current reform movement, the Party Unity Drive, was launched at a.
 Central Committee meeting in February 1954.  The general line for transition to socialism
 had been opposed by KAO Kang, head of the State Planning Commission, and other leading
 cadres who apparently split from the party xntz center's pro ram of gradual transition.

 to those who "regard the region or department under their leadership as their individual

 attacks o8"local nationalism, unprincipled disputes and controversies over personal aims,"
 all of which were regarded as serious threats to party unity.          abrwxft     txwxdxmi

 the Communists iaagxx launched a nationwide campaign against HU Fang and his "counter-

 member of the CCP, had made a vehement attack on communist exploitation of literature

 targets for this educational program: "-6xisting evidence indicates that HU Feng's followers

 Why is it that ever since the CCP siezed power in 1949 China has been in the grip
 of a series of nationwide drives to eliminate anti-Communist opposition?  Is it because
 the Com-unist system itself does not admit of tranquility and that consequently the fine
 edge must be maintained even after the opposition has been eliminated or have the
 Communists failed to achieve the unity for which they have been given credit?  Their own
 explanation for the frequency and intensity tax of the reform movements is typically
