 China's Policy Toward Vietnam:
 Tightening the Screws F__]
 intentions toward the region.
 Over the past five years Beijing has patiently and persistently pursued a
 strategy designed to force a Vietnamese withdrawal from Kampuchea and
 to weaken the Soviet-Vietnamese alliance. To keep Vietnam from consoli-
 dating its position, Beijing has exerted direct military pressure to tie down
 Vietnam's best troops along the Sino-Vietnamese border and backed the
 Khmer resistance. At the same time, Beijing has sought to isolate Hanoi
 diplomatically and to deny the legitimacy of the Vietnamese-backed
 government in Kampuchea. China has looked mainly to ASEAN to take
 the lead in this effort, hoping in doing so to forge close ties with Thailand
 and eventually to overcome other ASEAN states' fears of Chinese
 policy.
 In the short run, the Chinese acknowledge that pressure and isolation will
 increase Hanoi's dependence on the Soviet Union and, in all likelihood,
 draw the Soviet Union even deeper into Indochina. But Chinese officials
 also argue that the growing Vietnamese dependency will eventually and
 inevitably lead to serious strains in the Soviet-Vietnamese relationship.'
 We have seen no concrete signs of the tension Beijing predicts-only signs
 of growing cooperation between Hanoi and Moscow. But Beijing, in our
 view, remains committed to a long-term policy that purposely increases
 Vietnam's dependence on the Soviet Union as the best way of eventually
 producing a rupture of that relationship and a reorientation of Vietnam's
 to pursue it somewhat more aggressively.
 We believe events over the past year have reinforced Beijing's determina-
 tion to pursue this policy. In fact, modest gains by the Khmer insurgents as
 well as increased Soviet and Vietnamese cooperation are prompting Beijing
 The Chinese realize that sustaining this long-term strategy will require the
 continued cooperation of the ASEAN states-some of which still regard
 China as more of a long-term threat to their security than Vietnam.
 ASEAN's strong opposition to Pol Pot regaining power complicates
 China's efforts to ensure this cooperation. To assuage ASEAN, the
 Chinese balance their strong support for Pol Pot's forces with a mix of po-
 litical and military backing for the Sihanouk-led Coalition Government of
 bout a change in Vietnamese policies.
 ' China rejects the argument that Vietnam could be weaned from the Soviets if the West
 provided alternative sources of aid. Beijing contends that the relief of the Soviet burden
 would actually serve the joint interests of Hanoi and Moscow without necessarily bringing

 Democratic Kampuchea (DK). A dramatically stronger showing by DK
 insurgents ironically could prove troublesome for China, if it leads to an
 erosion in ASEAN solidarity that Hanoi could exploit.
 Chinese policy could shift if Moscow decides to adopt a more accommodat-
 ing position on Vietnam, if Thai support for the Khmer resistance
 collapses, or if there is a dramatic leadership change in Beijing or Hanoi.
 None of these scenarios, however, seems likely soon.
 The record to date also suggests that the Chinese will need to keep
 increasing the pressure on Vietnam over the next several years in order to
 achieve their goals. If a process of escalation does develop, appeals from
 ASEAN states and China for more direct US involvement are likely to
 grow.

 Secret
 China's Policy Toward Vietnam:
 Tightening the Screws
 Military Pressure
 On the Border. Every year since 1980 the Chinese
 have begun limited military action along the Sino-
 Vietnamese border to coincide with Vietnam's dry-
 season operations in Kampuchea (November-May).
 For the 1983-84 dry season, however, China began
 shelling Vietnamese positions well before the start of
 Hanoi's campaign in Kampuchea and responded
 promptly to Vietnamese incursions into Thai territory
 in late March 1984. Then, in late April and May, the
 Chinese increased their ground and air forces opposite
 Vietnam to their highest level since the 1979 invasion
 and seized several strategically located hilltops just
 inside Vietnamese territory. Chinese naval forces also
 held an unprecedented exercise in the South China
 Sea in early May.
 The shelling in February and March probably was
 intended to reassure the Thai, who had complained
 about the belated Chinese response to Vietnamese
 military pressure along the Thai border last year. But
 the unusually large ground and naval deployments in
 April and early May appear to have been prompted by
 a joint Soviet-Vietnamese amphibious operation in
 mid-April-which coincided with a major Vietnamese
 push against Kampuchean resistance camps on the
 Thai-Kampuchean border.
 A senior Chinese naval officer told the US defense
 attache in Beijing that China recognized the message
 the USSR was sending and would not give in to such
 intimidation. We believe Beijing wanted to demon-
 strate that its threat of a second lesson was still very
 much alive, in spite of the substantial improvements
 in Vietnamese forces opposite China and growing
 Soviet-Vietnamese military cooperation.
 Support for the Kampuchean Resistance. The in-
 creased Chinese pressure on the border may have
 been influenced in part by the change in Hanoi's
 tactics against the insurgents in Kampuchea. The
 insurgents were notably more successful last year and
 early this year in expanding their operations. The
 Communist Democratic Kampuchea (DK) resistance
 in particular has boosted its capabilities and activity,
 allowing it to move additional guerrillas into the
 interior provinces and to step up attacks. As a result,
 during this wet season (May to November) the Viet-
 namese have kept pressure on the resistance's major
 bases along the Thai-Kampuchean border instead of
 withdrawing to the interior as they usually do. This
 has prevented the resistance from regaining its cus-
 tomary rainy season tactical advantage.
 The DK's improved performance is largely due to
 generous Chinese support. Since 1979, China has
 provided the DK with an estimated $100 million
 worth of arms, ammunition, food, and medicine.
 The Chinese clearly regard the Communists as the
 most militarily effective resistance element and are     25X1
 doing their best to bolster Pol Pot's military capabili-
 ty. More important, the Chinese for over a decade
 have considered, and in our view continue to consider,
 the Khmer Communists as a primary vehicle for
 blunting Vietnamese influence and extending the
 Chinese role in Kampuchea.                        25X1
 This year's fighting along the Sino-Vietnamese border
 seems likely to persist for some time, in contrast to the
 seasonal cycles of hostility in previous years. Vietnam-
 ese leaders are determined to retake the hilltops
 China seized in April, and the Chinese are just as
 determined to hang on.

 Secret
 The unwillingness of the ASEAN states to see the DK
 and Pol Pot regain power in Kampuchea and their
 effort to build up the non-Communist coalition ele-
 ments to a point where the Communists are eclipsed
 represent at least a potential dilemma for Beijing. But
 whether Beijing will ever be forced to abandon Pol
 Pot in favor of a non-Communist alternative re-
 mains-fortunately for the Chinese-an academic
 question. For the time being, the disparity between
 Communist and non-Communist coalition capabilities
 provides plenty of latitude for the Chinese to finesse
 the contradictory elements of their policy and, in
 effect, to work both sides of the street.
 In addition to maintaining its strong material and
 political backing for the Khmer Communists, Beijing
 has been able to assuage the concerns of its Thai allies
 and the other ASEAN countries by providing materi-
 al aid to the non-Communist groups as well.' China
 has provided the majority of the arms and ammuni-
 tion now in the hands of the non-Communists. F_
 Beijing also has sought to allay ASEAN fears by
 giving its full diplomatic backing to the Sihanouk-led
 clearly intended to please ASEAN, China also for the
 first time endorsed ASEAN's joint proposal for a
 government of national reconciliation in Kampu-
 chea-after Vietnam withdraws-which would in-
 clude the Heng Samrin faction.
 Isolating Vietnam
 Beijing realizes, of course, that it needs ASEAN
 support to keep Hanoi and the Heng Samrin regime
 in Phnom Penh diplomatically isolated. ASEAN has
 been instrumental year after year in rallying opposi-
 tion at the United Nations to Vietnam's challenge to
 the credentials of the Coalition Government of Demo-
 cratic Kampuchea. The votes have been so lopsided
 that Vietnam did not even try last year.
 ' The two non-Communist insurgent, groups are the Khmer People's
 National Liberation Front (KPNLF) and the Sihanoukist National
 Army (ANS), under Son Sann and Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
 respectively
 ASEAN solidarity, therefore, remains a constant
 source of concern to China-especially since Indone-
 sia and Malaysia in particular continue to distrust
 China and favor a compromise settlement that would
 accommodate at least some of Vietnam's security
 concerns. Not surprisingly, Chinese Foreign Ministry
 officials were upset last fall when ASEAN first issued
 its proposal for a government of national reconcilia-
 tion in Kampuchea, complaining it smacked too much
 of a compromise. Beijing undoubtedly was also irritat-
 ed and disturbed when the Indonesian Armed Forces
 Commander visited Hanoi in February and was
 quoted by the Vietnamese media as saying China-
 not Vietnam-posed a military threat to the region.
 Beijing has made it very clear that it opposes any
 compromise that does not conform with the provisions
 of the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and
 the International Conference on Kampuchea (ICK) in
 1981:
 ? Complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from
 Kampuchea.
 ? Free elections under international supervision. F_
 To underscore its position, Beijing has rebuffed Ha-
 noi's calls for Sino-Vietnamese talks until Hanoi
 accepts these conditions and has also opposed third-
 party mediation efforts that might legitimize Viet-
 nam's hold on Kampuchea by compromising the
 UN/ICK formulas. Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang,
 for example, headed off French and Australian com-
 promise proposals in 1982 and 1983 by warning both
 countries about the negative effects their proposals
 would have on relations with China.
 To counter Vietnamese charges last year of intransi-
 gence, Beijing did publicize a "new" five-point pro-
 posal for the solution of the Kampuchean issue. But
 that proposal deviated from China's standard formula
 only in stating that Beijing would resume the Sino-
 Vietnamese dialogue after Vietnam began a phased
 withdrawal from Kampuchea. Beijing had previously
 insisted on full Vietnamese withdrawal prior to re-
 suming the talks.

 Fortunately for the Chinese, their own rigidity has
 been matched by the Vietnamese. For example, Viet-
 namese Foreign Minister Thatch last March rejected
 offhand Indonesian President Soeharto's compromise
 proposals on the Kampuchea issue, which tried to
 accommodate some of Vietnam's basic security con-
 cerns. This persuaded the Indonesians-the most
 accommodationist of the ASEAN countries-that
 pressure must be maintained on Hanoi.
 Closer Cooperation With Thailand and ASEAN
 The Chinese regard Thailand's cooperation as espe-
 cially crucial to their overall regional strategy. With-
 out sanctuaries in Thailand, the Khmer insurgents
 could not operate effectively. Nor could China easily
 resupply the guerrillas without Thai help. Any soften-
 ing of Thailand's hard line toward Vietnam, more-
 over, would probably be immediately adopted by

 ASEAN as a whole.
 As a result, the Chinese have sought to-forge particu-
 larly close ties with Thai leaders since the mid-
 1970s-with some success. Sino-Thai cooperation has
 increased as the fighting in Kampuchea has intensi-
 fied. Over the past year in particular, there has been a
 flurry of visits by Thai and Chinese military and
 political leaders designed to underscore China's com-
 mitment to Thailand's security and the growing close-
 ness of the relationship:
 ? Foreign Minister Wu visited Bangkok in August
 1983 and again in February 1984.
 ? In late July 1984, Foreign Minister Siddhi and the
 head of Thai intelligence visited Beijing.
 ? In May and June, the chiefs of staff of all three
 Thai military branches, including Supreme Military
 Commander Athit, visited Beijing.
 According to Thai officials, the Chinese have offered
 to sell Thailand heavy military equipment including
 aircraft, submarines, and armor. If accepted, it would
 mark a new phase in Sino-Thai relations. The Thai
 military's preference for US weapons and its unwill-
 ingness to become dependent on Beijing will limit the
 purchase of Chinese weapons. Nevertheless, accord-
 ing to Thai officials, Bangkok is considering these
 By capitalizing on a common interest in resisting the
 Vietnamese, the Chinese are seeking to establish a
 firmer basis for relations with other ASEAN nations
 through trade, diplomacy, and the exchange of high-
 level visitors. Malaysian Foreign Minister Ghazali
 held talks in Beijing with Chinese leaders in late May
 and early June. Although differences persist between
 Beijing and Kuala Lumpur-especially over China's
 refusal to sever all ties with the Communist Party of
 Malaysia-the fact that the visit took place at all is
 an indication of Malaysian interest in improving the
 relationship.
 On the economic side, two-way trade with Singapore
 topped $1 billion in the last two years. Singapore is
 also playing an increased role in China's search for
 petroleum in the South China Sea. The Philippines
 recently signed a new trade protocol with China
 aimed at increasing the markets for its nontraditional
 exports. Even Indonesia, which severed ties with
 China in 1967, has substantial unofficial trade with
 China-over $400 million last year-much of it
 through Hong Kong (see figure 1).
 Chinese offers.
 China probably hopes that improved relations with
 Thailand will serve as a bridge to the rest of ASEAN.

 Secret
 Superpower Involvement
 Beijing's initial attempt to use the Sino-Soviet talks in
 1982 to sow distrust between Hanoi and Moscow did
 not produce the desired results. If anything, Soviet-
 Vietnamese relations appear to have grown closer, as
 illustrated by their joint amphibious exercise last
 spring. The Soviets, in fact, have repeatedly reassured
 Hanoi that Moscow would not sacrifice Vietnamese
 interests in Kampuchea in order to improve relations
 with Beijing.                           Moscow
 even canceled the Arkhipov visit to China last May, in
 part, to avoid appearing to acquiesce to Chinese
 military attacks on its ally. Hanoi in turn has allowed
 Moscow greater access to Vietnamese military facili-
 ties in Cam Ranh Bay-a move noted with concern in
 the Chinese media.
 Growing Soviet-Vietnamese military cooperation may
 have been one factor, among many, that influenced
 Beijing's decision last year to improve relations with
 the United States. Beijing has privately expressed
 support for the US military buildup in the region as a
 counterweight to the Soviet presence and probably
 hopes that the United States will stiffen ASEAN
 resolve to oppose Vietnam's continued occupation of
 Kampuchea. The Chinese also probably hope that
 improved Sino-US relations will make it easier for
 Beijing to portray its regional posture-both for
 ASEAN and for Soviet and Vietnamese consump-
 tion-as having US backing. It is no accident-in our
 judgment-that China timed its escalation of the
 fighting along the Sino-Vietnamese border last spring
 to coincide with President Reagan's state visit. In
 doing so, we believe, Beijing also hoped to remind US
 officials of the common security interests of the
 United States and China.
 Continued Stalemate
 The Chinese remain committed to the long haul and
 do not expect Vietnam's economy, political will, and
 morale to crack soon. Party Chairman Hu Yaobang
 told Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi in July that he
 expected the fighting to continue in Kampuchea for
 another seven to 10 years. The Chinese Ambassador
 in Bangkok also recently indicated that the Chinese
 do not believe the insurgents will ever be able to
 defeat Vietnamese forces in Kampuchea. At most,
 Beijing hopes to make their occupation so costly that
 the Vietnamese will agree to negotiate a political
 This Chinese assessment of Vietnamese determina-
 tion, to us, seems on the mark. The Vietnamese, for
 their part, believe a friendly regime in Phnom Penh is
 essential for their security. Vietnam recognizes that
 an outright victory is beyond its reach and has
 apparently settled on a strategy aimed at minimizing
 the gains of the Kampuchean resistance. Although
 Hanoi has been unsuccessful thus far on the diplomat-
 ic front, it has demonstrated increased tactical flexi-
 bility on political issues and may believe ASEAN will
 eventually accept the status quo in Kampuchea. The
 Soviets seem willing, in turn, to continue to foot the
 bill-currently about $5 million a day in military and
 economic aid to Vietnam-to ensure their continued
 access to Vietnamese military facilities.
 ASEAN also seems prepared to wait patiently for
 Vietnam to show greater flexibility. We believe that
 despite differences over tactics the other ASEAN
 capitals will continue to defer to Bangkok on the issue,
 with slight modifications, to prevent a split between
 ASEAN hardliners and moderates.
 Alternate Scenarios
 Although we expect no fundamental change in the
 situation over the next year or so, events could take an
 unexpected turn if one or more of the key factors in
 the present equation change.
 ASEAN Seeks a Compromise. The weakest link in
 Beijing's strategy of pressure against Hanoi remains
 its dependence on ASEAN, and especially Thailand.
 Most ASEAN countries harbor deep suspicions about
 Chinese intentions and are concerned that prolonga-
 tion of the conflict in Kampuchea will increase Chi-
 nese and Soviet opportunities to expand their influ-
 ence in the region. Indonesia in particular appears
 more concerned about the long-term Chinese threat
 than the danger of Soviet-backed Vietnamese expan-
 sion.
 It is possible-but not likely soon-that Indonesia
 and some of the other ASEAN states could seek a
 compromise settlement. Such a shift would be most
 likely to occur if the DK were to score unexpected
 settlement.

 secret
 gains on the battlefield and seek to weaken its non-
 Communist coalition partners. Nervous at the pros-
 pect of a return of a Chinese-supported Pol Pot
 regime, some in ASEAN might seek to work out an
 agreement with Hanoi that sought to cut the DK out
 of a power-sharing formula.
 Such a split in ASEAN ranks would seriously weaken
 China's diplomatic efforts to keep Vietnam isolated,
 but, in our view, China's strategy would not be
 irreparably damaged as long as Thailand continued
 its confrontational policies toward Vietnam. Thai
 policy, however, is closely associated with a few senior
 officials. A change in government in Bangkok could,
 therefore, affect the Thai stand.
 If a new government opted to cut off Chinese supplies
 to the Kampuchean resistance and to seek a compro-
 mise with Hanoi, Beijing's options would be limited.
 In our view, China would find it impossible to main-
 tain its current level of support to the resistance. F_
 With
 current stockpiles and whatever assistance China
 managed to get to the rebels, the resistance could hold
 on for a while. But without Thai sanctuaries the
 resistance would be dangerously exposed to Vietnam-
 ese attacks and its effectiveness, in our view, would
 gradually erode.
 Leadership Changes. China's hardline approach to
 Vietnam is closely associated with Deng Xiaoping,
 who personally crafted the policy after his return to
 power in the late 1970s. A post-Deng leadership in
 Beijing might calculate that the present strategy has
 been counterproductive-pushing the Vietnamese
 closer to the Soviets without producing the frictions
 intended-and opt for a soft approach designed to
 wean Hanoi away from Moscow. Thus far, however,
 there is no evidence of leadership differences on this
 point.
 Vietnamese interests in the region will survive any
 leadership changes in Beijing or Hanoi. Vietnamese
 dominance over Indochina represents one of Hanoi's
 few accomplishments since reunifying the country,
 making it that much more difficult to give up. It is
 precisely Vietnam's insistence on maintaining its posi-
 tion in Indochina that the Chinese oppose, prompting
 Hanoi to rely on Moscow as a counterweight.
 Given Moscow's growing strategic interest in close
 ties to Vietnam, we believe a change in leadership in
 Moscow would be even less likely to produce a more
 accommodating Soviet approach to China on Kampu-
 chea.

 The Longer Term
 Whether Beijing's strategy will succeed in the longer 25X1
 term remains an open question at this juncture. The
 record of events to date, however, suggests that the
 Chinese will need to up the ante-perhaps several
 times-in the coming years if the intended rift be-
 tween the Soviets and Vietnamese is to materialize.
 And until that rift occurs, Moscow's military involve- 25X1
 ment and presence in Vietnam is likely to grow,
 thereby adding to the stakes involved for both sides.  25X1
 There are inherent dangers in such a process of
 escalation. For one thing, the increasing dimensions of
 the struggle will sorely test ASEAN's current re-
 solve-probably well before any basic policy change
 in Hanoi or Beijing. The Thai, for example, may one
 day question the wisdom of supporting ever larger
 resistance forces, especially if they are unable to
 extend their bases of operation throughout Kampu-
 chea and remain tied to enclaves along the Thai-
 Kampuchean border. Forces concentrated in this area
 would be a potential threat to Thai security and would
 probably draw additional Vietnamese forces to the
 border as well. However it came about, a reappraisal
 of ASEAN strategy would almost certainly entail
 strong appeals from the ASEAN states for more US
 assistance and direct involvement. In view of the    25X1
 larger stakes, Beijing also could be expected to urge
 the United States in the same direction.
 We believe, moreover, that the history of ill will and
 the fundamental differences between Chinese and
