 The Sixth World Festival of Youth and Students, held
 at Moscow 28 July - 11 August 1957, was the largest, costliest
 and most spectacular youth gathering in history and as such
 must be regarded as a world political event of major signifi-
 cance.                        A critical review of the event leads to the conclusion
 that it probably achieved most of the propaganda and organi-
 zational aims of its Communist sponsors.  Nevertheless,
 Soviet youth - and presumably the Moscow citizenry as well -
 had been exposed, as the head of the Komsomol, Alexander
 Shelepin, admitted, to the "penetration into our midst of an
 ideology, morals and habits that are alien to us. "
 After several months of hesitation, while the results
 of the Moscow Festival were assessed, the International Com-
 muni.st youth front organizations canvassed a number of pos-
 sible sites in both the Bloc and the Free World and finally
 decided to hold the Seventh Festival in Vienna from 26 July
 to 4 August 1959.  This will mark the first occasion on which
 the Youth Festival has been held outside the Soviet Bloc. Ap-
 parently sensitive to the criticism that the Moscow Festival
 was too ambitious and long-drawn-out, the sponsors have
 decided to reduce the length of the gathering by five days and
 the size of the delegations by approximately 50 percent, i.e.
 to a total of about 17, 000.  There is no reason to believe that
 the Communists attach any less importance to the 1959 Festi-
 val than to previous ones, but they probably have concluded
 that Communist control could be better maintained in a non-
 Communist setting if the size of the delegations is not too
 large.  The attitude of the Vienna authorities who requested
 that the Festival be kept within modest limits so as not to
 interfere too much with the normally heavy midsummer tour-
 ist traffic may also have affected the sponsors' decisions.
 Finally, the need for reducing the cost, as compared to the
 heavy expenses of the Moscow event, may also have been a
 factor.

 In weighing the risks involved in holding the Festival
 outside the Iron Curtain, the sponsors presumably have faced
 the fact that although the official delegates will mostly be under
 tight Communist discipline, there will undoubtedly be present
 a larger percentage of non-Communist youth as visitors and
 observers than on previous occasions.  While this dilution
 will support the pretence that the Festival is "non-political,  "
 it will also raise serious problems of maintaining Communist
 control over the proceedings.  Furthermore, the Festival will
 be exposed in all likelihood to hostile criticism and even to
 attempted sabotage by anti-Communist elements, especially
 ernigr6 groups.
 Recently (Fall 1958) the initial self-assurance of the
 Festival organizers appears to have given way to moods of
 anxiety over the extensive opposition encountered from Austri-
 an youth organizations, non-Communist political parties and
 the local press.  There is no clear indication at this time,
 however, that the Communists will be sufficiently discouraged
 to pack up their tents and move to a Bloc site, the most logical
 of which would seem to be Prague.  Nevertheless, the possibil-
 ity of such a switch should not be ruled out.  On balance it
 appears probable that the Communists will continue to count
 on the discipline and manipulative skill of their youth cadres
 to contain the Festival within acceptable limits even in the
 traditionally relaxed atmosphere of Vienna. Whether or not
 developments between now and July 1959 will vindicate the
 judgment of the Communist leaders, they are surely aware
 that they are assuming unprecedented risks.
 The selection of a neutral Western country for the site
 of the Festival provides a counter-propaganda opportunity to
 the Free World which should not go unchallenged.  It is the
 purpose of this paper, through an analysis of the Sixth Festi-
 val, to point toward a concerted course of action which might
 turn the Vienna Festival to our advantage.

 BETWEEN TWO COMMUNIST WORLD YOUTH FESTIVALS:
 Moscow 1957   Vienna 1959
 I .      INTRODUCTION
 A.  Scope and Cost of 1957 Festival
 1.   Contrived as a spectacular advertisement of
 the Kremlin leadership's "new look" of benign political toler-
 ance and reasonableness, the Sixth World Festival of Youth
 and Students, through its endlessly repeated theme of universal
 "pease and friendship, " was also designed to serve as a proto-
 type for peaceful coexistence on a mass scale.  It was, in fact,
 the largest international gathering ever held in Moscow and
 the first of its kind within the Soviet Union (all previous Festi-
 vals were held in satellite capitals).  It provided fourteen
 event-packed days for 35, 000 delegates - more than half from
 outside the Soviet Bloc - for an additional estimated 70, 000-
 100, 000 youthful "guests" mostly from within the USSR,, and
 for great crowds of enthralled Muscovites.  In size and scope
 it surpassed even the epochal 40th Anniversary celebration of
 the Bolshevik Revolution, held in Moscow some three months
 later.  According to an experienced Western observer, the
 latter event would have been a "mere anti-climax" to the Festi-
 val had it not been for the glamor of the Sputnik successes.
 Z.  The 1957. youth fete was probably as impres-
 sive a success as its sponsors had hoped and as its Free World
 opponents had anticipated. 1 In evaluating its significance, we
 must recognize that the Festival was not an isolated event,
 designed to achieve a single impact.  Like all major Commu-
 nist undertakings, it must be envisaged as part of a political
 and propaganda continuum, a never-ending series of efforts
 conducted by the vast network of "International Fronts." The

 sponsoring organizations, the World Federation of Democratic
 Youth (WFDY) and the International Union of Students (IUS)
 play interacting roles with the other adult fronts, especially
 the World Peace Council (WPC) and the World Federation of
 Trade Unions,(WFTU).  Within this centrally directed frame-
 work, the Moscow Festival provided the impetus for a new
 series of regional and local follow-ups which exerted a stim-
 ulating effect on Communist organizations throughout the world,
 especially in the Afro-Asian and Latin-Anican countries.
 3.   The money, time, and effort expended on the
 Festival by the Soviet Government, by the two international
 Communist youth fronts and their affiliates were of a colossal
 order. 1  Estimates of the cost run between a minimum equiv-
 alent of 100 million and a maximum of 150 million US dollars. 2
 The bulk of this sum was provided by the Soviet Union, with
 token funds raised by local contribution campaigns, lotteries,
 and other special events.  The global organizing efforts for
 the Festival covered the better part of a year and involved
 varied and complicated operations and logistics.  The assem-
 bling, transportation to, within and from the USSR; the hous-
 ing, feeding (including the preparation and serving of a great
 variety of national dishes) and other care of thousands of young
 visitors from almost every part of the earth presented a man-
 1The Italian Communist Party Organ L'Unita admitted the
 high cost of the Festival in a front-page story August 6, 1957,
 headlined:  'The Festival Costs Many Millions of Rubles but
 Much less than a Single Day of War. rt
 2
 Such estimates are necessarily somewhat impressionistic.
 They may not take account of the fact much of the outlay result-
 ed in permanent improvements of the city, such as stadia,
 concert halls, and other buildings.

 agement problem of major proportions.  Arrangements for
 the hundreds of daily cultural events, sports, entertainments
 and exhibitions were carried out with remarkable precision.
 4.   The massive publicity barrage for the Festival
 by Radio Moscow exceeded that for any event since Stalin's
 death, with the single exception of the 20th CPSU Congress
 (February 1956).  During the period of the Festival, 56% of
 Moscow's broadcasts in all languages were devoted to the
 general lneetings and other events, and to interviews with
 participants and the press.  This was a much higher percent-
 age than for previous Festivals.  In all, some 1, 966 extensive
 Soviet radio items were broadcast as compared with only 279
 during the 1955 Warsaw Festival.    o:scow's broadcasts were
 beamed worldwide.  Foreign audiences heard, in addition to
 the more general coverage, detailed reports on the particular
 activities of their own delegations.
 B.  Propaganda Aims of theFestival
 5.   The major propaganda aims of the Commu-
 nist .sponsors of the Festival were:
 a.  To impart a benign 'New Look" to. the
 Soviet Union..   The foremost propaganda objective
 was to impress the world with the new course of the
 Soviet leadership in the warmth of the post-Stalin
 "thaw, " a movement away from dogmatic orthodoxy
 and intractability toward a seemingly benevolent polit-
 ical tolerance, objectivity, and "reasonableness" which
 would permit opposing views to be expressed even in
 the citadel of Communism itself.  The creation of this
 impression was essential in making friends and influenc-
 ing people, particularly in the vast uncommitted areas
 of the world.  The unprecedented permission for thou-
 sands of young non-Communists to swarm over Moscow

 and give vent to "alie.n " opinions and ideas probably
 never heard before within the USSR would also serve
 as vivid demonstrations of the confident strength of
 Khrushchev and his associates.
 b.  To help recoup Soviet prestige  among those
 youth of the non-Communist world, who in the past had
 been amenable to Communist influence but who had be-
 come disillusioned by the ruthless repression of Hungar-
 ian youth in the uprising of 1956.  Ever-conscious of the
 role of youth, particularly students, in the development
 of World Communism, the Kremlin regarded the re-
 winning of the cadres of leftist youth groups in other
 countries, particularly underdeveloped areas, as a
 prime objective in its effort to stabilize the Communist
 movement, preparatory to new international initiatives.
 c.  To induce mass support of Soviet foreign policy
 by the youth of non-Communist countries, in particular
 of (1) "peace" and disarmament programs advantageous
 to the Soviet Union, and (2) the extension of Soviet influ-
 ence in the main target areas, i. e. the Middle East,
 Africa and Latin America.
 d.  To curb dissent, bolster the faith and spur the
 efforts of Soviet youth on behalf of the Party and the
 Soviet state.  The intellectual ferment and resentment
 among a sizeable sector of youth within the USSR had
 given the Kremlin admitted cause for concern.  The
 Soviet leadership hoped that by showing its ability to
 attract thousands of youth from Free World countries
 to Moscow, despite the unpleasantness in Hungary,
 and by permitting relatively free contacts and exchanges
 with them, it would impress Soviet youth with the wis-
 dom and strength of the Party.

 II.     SOME BASIC FACTS ABOUT THE FESTIVAL
 A.  Size and Political Make-up of Delegations by
 Areas.
 6,   Estimates of the total number of youth and
 student delegates at the Moscow Festival are obtained from
 two sources:  the "official" counts and estimates of the Festi-
 val managers, and the separate reports from Free World
 sources of the number going from each country.  The figures
 from both sources are generally consistent as to the world
 total; about 35, 000 attending` delegates (as distinguished from
 "guests, it many of whom were invited onlookers from within
 the. USSR, totalling some 120, 000).  Approximately half of
 the delegates were fromthe 12 Soviet Bloc countries.  There
 is some discrepancy in the figures for woxfd-areas and individ-
 ual countries which, if added up, amount to- more than the
 overe.a1htita1. Thus, in some of the figures cited below it is
 necessary to indicate maximum and minimum estimates..
 7.   West European and non-Bloc East. European
 representation at the Festival totaled between 14, 00.0 and
 15, 500.  A discrepancy between this and the several country
 totals is. attributed to the number of persons who at the last
 moment filled vacant slots in the original allocations, or who
 went to Moscow not from their home countries but from other
 countries where they were studying or traveling.  The largest
 of the European delegations were:  France (2, 000), Italy,
 (1, 900-2, 300), Finland (1, 6.00-2, 000), Great Britain (1, 650),
 West Germany (1, 100-1, 300) and Austria (1, 000). In each
 instance these numbers were as great as, or greater than had
 been. targeted by the Festival sponsors, as were those of most
 of the other European delegations. The Greek delegation was
 one of the most disappointing to the Festival planners.  Only
 80 Greek youth participated, compared to an original target
 of 2, 000 and a later much revised estimate of 250.  The Yugo-

 slav delegation, numbering about 200 as anticipated, was the
 first group from that country to attend a World Youth Festival
 since 1947.
 8.   The Middle Eastern delegates, especially
 sought after in the light of the Festival's propaganda objectives,
 numbered 2, 300 to 2, 800.  They came from 18 countries and
 included a minimum of 1, 500 Arabs.  African representatives
 (all parts of the African continent) totaled 440 to 460 from 40
 countries and territories.  India sent 450-600, 250 of whom
 were students in Europe.. Seventeen Far Eastern non-Commu-
 nist countries sent a total of 520-660.                 Latin American delegates
 numbered 850-1, 000 from 32 countries or regions.  North Amer-
 ican participants numbered 360, of whom 200 were from Canada
 and 160 from the United States.
 The Soviet Bloc Delegates
 9.   The delegations from the Soviet Union and the
 satellites (17, 000 total) were, as usual, representatives of the
 various official Communist youth and student organizations of
 their countries.   However, perhaps because it played the role
 of host, the Soviet contingent appeared to be far less politically
 sectarian, more cordial, and often more open-minded than at
 other Festivals, although the regime issued several sharp warn-
 ings against too much camaraderie with Westerners.  The Pol-
 ish delegation (1, 250) turned out to be one of the most pleasant
 surprises - from the Western point of view - of the entire pro-
 ceedings.  It was in many ways the liveliest, the most inquiring
 and searchingly critical of any Bloc group that has ever appeared
 at a. Festival.  The Czechs, (1, 200), Rumanians (1, 000), East
 Germans (1, 200) and other Eastern European satellite delega-
 tions were generally dutiful and quiescent, according to form.
 The Hungarians (over 1, 000), largely young secret policemen
 and Kadar stooges, formed the n ost orthodox and puppet-like
 Communist delegation.  The Chinese Communist delegates,
 estimated at about 3, 000, were described by the Chinese Corn-

 munist press. as the largest and most representative group
 ever togo abroad from China.
 Organizational and Professional Representation
 Among other statistics cited by the sponsors, the
 following are of particular interest:
 10. More than 22 international and over 1, 000
 national organizations (many of them "'paper" groups) were
 represented, about half of which were not affiliated with WFDY
 and IUS. Some 4, 150 athletes from 49 countries took part in
 the Third International Friendly Youth Games and some 2, 000
 from 40 countries in the Festival sports program.  There were
 two separate series of athletic events held during the period of
 the Festival.  About 2, 000 newspapermen - according to Soviet
 claims - twice as many as expected, including 743 foreign cor-
 respondents (many of whom were from Bloc countries) repre-
 senting 200 newspapers for 47 countries and all major news
 agencies, radio and television networks from all over the world -
 covered the events at the Festival.  More than 7, 000 representa-
 tives from all continents attended the 23 professional and trade
 meetings. . More than. 2, 000 young artists from 47 countrces
 took part in the International Art Exhibition in which 3, 500 paint-
 ings and objets d'art were exhibited.
 Political Make-up of Free World. Delegations
 11.  The 1957 Festival had a far larger proportion
 of non-Communist official participants in attendance than had
 ever appeared before.  This was -undoubtedly the result of the
 special effort made by the sponsors to persuade youth groups
 in the Free World that this was to be an open, non-political
 event.  Many young people who had not the slightest interest
 in .Communism but who were curious to see Moscow, looking
 forward to a. good time for two weeks at very small expense,
 -7-

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 decided to attend.  In addition, some anti--Communists saw
 the first real chance ever offered at any international Com-
 munist youth gathering to carry out some effective counter-
 Communist propaganda.  In the past, delegations to the Festi-
 vals had been overwhelmingly made up of young Communists
 or fellow travelers.
 12.  The WesternEuropean delegations contained
 a large number of non-Communists.  British sources estim-
 ated that almost two-thirds, or over 1, 000 of the 1, 650 Brit-
 ish delegates, had little or no sympathy for Communism.  The
 French and Italian groups (about 2, 000 each), representing
 the Western countries with the most powerful Communist
 Parties, included one-third to one-half non-Communists. The
 Italians were reported to be the most ill-behaved of the Free
 World delegates.   The West German delegation (l", 200) was
 heavily non-Communist, or certainly behaved as though it
 were.  Its one mission appeared to be to undercut or at least
 to neutralize the Communist-dominated East German delega-
 tion.  In the opening parade, when the East Germans appeared
 with a. "Germania" banner, the West Germans did likewise; in
 generalthey gave their Communist co-nationals little opportun-
 ity to assert any claim that they were the "true" German repre-
 sentatives.  It was reported that both of these delegations were
 quartered and dined together and that the West Germans suc-
 ceeded in doing some effective propagandizing, while them-
 selves remaining immune--to Communist- appeals.
 13.  The US  Participants (they refused to let them-
 selves be described as "delegates, ") who as discussed later
 became the focus of attention of the people of Moscow, num-

 The Italians were said to have refused to pay taxi fares, to
 have complained about food and service, and to have taken
 many items in their hotel rooms as "souvenirs. "

 be-red a mere 160.  On their own initiative they had come to
 the Festival in spite of the strong official discouragement of
 the Department of State.  The remarkable fact about them -
 in the- light of the Communist domination of such groups in
 the past - was that not more than 2-0% were Communist-
 oriented, and.. even the greater part of those were reported
 to have- acted like !'good Americans" by the time the Festival
 ended.  They had an effect on the Muscovites and the Soviet
 youth with whom they came in contact far in excess of their
 numerical strength and in spite of the lack of political sophis-
 tication of the large majority who were primarily interested
 in the opportunities for a good time.
 14.  The Middle Eastern delegations varied widely
 in their size, composition and attitudes toward the Festival.
 The Egyptians and other Arab delegations, the favored protegbs
 of. the Festival sponsors, received the most .care and adulation
 in the parades and other big events, in. their privileged housing
 and feeding, and in their leading positions on the various porrm-
 mittees and sub-committees.  In addition, they were provided
 with official. Soviet Government sea transportation to and from
 the Festival.. Estimates of the number of Egyptians who showed
 up at the Festival range between 550 and 663, including 150 girls,
 students at the University of Moscow, and several newspaper
 correspondents.  The Syrians numbered 450-500, including a
 member of the Syrian parliament and ten news reporters.  The
 delegation was led by a senior official of the Syrian Ministry of
 Education.  On the other end of the scale, the Israeli contingent
 was -composed of two delegations of about 100 representatives
 each, one Communist and the other non-C.ommuni.st.  Both were
 united in their loyalty to Israel and were equally discriminated
 against by the Soviet authorities.  The Festival managers did
 almost everything conceivable to subordinate and block off, by
 obvious intent and by subterfuge, the activities of the Israelis
 in. Moscow.  Nevertheless the response of the Moscow Jewish
 community was so fervent in seeking out the young Israelis
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001000220001-5
 that the Soviet Festival leadership was taken aback and
 appeared not to know quite how to cope with the situation.
 The Iraqi and other Arab delegations, although courted by
 the Soviet sponsors, were offered fewer inducements and priv-
 ileges than the Egyptian and Syrian groups, and their reaction
 to the Festival was less enthusiastic.
 15. ,African delegations, also prime targets of the
 Festival planners, were the objects of about as much attention
 - and perhaps even more public curiosity - asthe Arabs.  Mos-
 cow propaganda featured the meetings, dances, tete-a-tetes,
 between African negroes and white delegates from all over the
 world.  One humorous note for Westerners was the exhibition
 of black clothing dummies in the Moscow shops to demonstrate
 Communist racial "equality. " The actual number of delegates
 from each African country or territory is difficult to ascertain.
 It is known that from several of the colonial African countries
 few- if any delegates appeared, largely as a result of the local
 governmental restrictions placed upon them and the difficulties
 experienced by the Communists in reaching the kind of youth
 and students who would be "representative. " Free World
 sources estimated that no more than 460 delegates came from
 the entire African continent.  Nevertheless, the WFDY claimed
 officially that a "great number" of African representatives
 came to the Festival and that the "number of participants from
 Africa, Asia and Latin America is almost twice as big as that
 of previous Festivals S"  The WFDY claim is inflated and
 probably overlooks the fact that a large part of the Afro-Asian
 delegations consisted of students who were studying in Europe
 (including the USSR).
 16.  The delegates from non-Communist Far
 Eastern countries numbered less than half the number anti-
 cipated by the Festival organizers.  The regional target was
 between 1, 950 and 2, 000 but as previously indicated the
 estimate of actual attendance was 520-660.  The largest

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Asian delegation was the Indonesian, totaling 200 (of whom
 about 50 were students in Europe) as against a Communist t.
 target of 190-350.  The second largest was the Japanese del-
 egation (155-260), one of the greatest disappointments to the
 Soviet sponsors who had made plans. for 500.  The Burmese
 representation was even worse from the Communist point of
 view, numbering only 12 as against an original target of 500
 and the much lowered anticipation of 50. Actually Australia
 (110-150) and New Zealand (25-40) were the only countries in
 the area to send about as many delegates as had been antici-
 pated.
 17.  The Latin American delegations, in the view
 of Western observers at the Festiva., were generally more
 "unenthusiastic" than the delegates from other areas, except-
 ing possibly the Middle East, and certainly more than those of
 Western Europe.  In general the Central and South American
 representation included the largest proportions of Communists
 or Communist-sympathizers of any non-Bloc groups at the
 Festival., even though there were highly articulate critics of
 the Soviet Union. among the delegates.  The largest delegations
 from Latin America were Brazil with 225 members; Chile,
 195; Argentina, 165;  Mexico, 85;  and Uruguay, 71.  Total
 participation from all Latin American countries was- claimed
 by the Festival sponsors to have numbered 958 or nearly twice
 the number who attended the Warsaw Festival in 1955.
 B.  The Physical Setting and Main Events
 18.  Advance notices of the preparations for the
 Festival indicated that the Soviet sponsors were so eager to
 put on an impressive show for the mass of expected delegates
 and visitors that they had transformed Moscow into a vast
 Potemkin village,  As far as possible, the usually drab ap-
 pearance of the Soviet capital was dressed up to look shiny
 and gay.  But the facade thus created was not altogether false
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001000220001-5
 and temporary.  It is true that the quickly-potted plants and
 hastily dug-in trees, and the thin veneer of new*paint on some
 old landmarks did, in fact, provide a Potemkin touch.  But
 much of the face-lifting of Moscow, and certainly the building
 of new stadia, concert halls and housing facilities and the re-
 moval of antique traffic bottlenecks were of a more solid and
 lasting character.  Reports from correspondents and other
 observers indicated that the Moscow citizenry was quite en-
 chanted not only with. the gay and colorful festivities of 14 days,
 but with the cleaning up and modernizing of whole sections of
 the city, such as had never been seen before.  Many Musco-
 vites expressed the wish to visitors that the Youth Festival
 could be repeated every year.
 19. To foreign visitors, particularly Westerners,
 however, the bare, drab and slummy spots showed through
 and exposed the generally unappealing aspects of the city.
 Yet even the most critical were willing to grant that an ef-
 ficient job had been done in housing, feeding and transporting
 the delegates.  The Americans reported that their qularters,
 although not the choicest - the best were saved for the Arab
 and African delegates - were adequate and compared not un-
 favorably with older college dormitory space in. the United
 States.  Bus transportation was frequent and free to all parts
 of the city and to all Festival events.  Haircuts, laundry and
 cleaning were also free.  Food was plentiful and adequately
 prepared with attention given to the preparation of national
 dishes, especially for the more exotic tastes of the Arabs,
 Africans and Orientals.   Pocket money was provided many
 of the delegates.

 III.     SOME SIGNIFICANT EXPECTED AND UNEXPECTED
 HAPPENINGS
 20.  The organizing ability and painstaking care of
 the Communists in creating and engineering international polit-
 ical activities are nowhere more evident than in their planning
 and carrying out the world gatherings of their international
 front organizations.  In the youth and student areas, the Festi-
 vals have always been notable, and the Sixth was, as the Com-
 munists intended it to be, "the greatest ever. " As already
 noted, the programming and scheduling down to the last detail
 were a striking performance, even from the point of.view of
 critical Westerners.  However, what made this Festival dis-
 tinctive in comparison to others was the proportion of happen-
 ings which were probably unexpected, or at least different than
 expected, by the Communist sponsors.  The planned events
 illustrate the true political and propaganda nature of the Festi-
 val.  Most of the unexpected. events demonstrated the -ways in
 which Free World youth on their own initiative were able to
 take advantage of the temporary lifting of the Iron Curtain to
 deliver some telling thrusts against Communist theory and
 practice.
 A.   The Ideological Oveature to the "I%bn- Political
 Festival
 21.  Behind the elaborate trappings, the ingratiat-
 ing arrangements, lay the hard political realities.  These
 were disclosed as early as the great opening sgssion in Lenin
 Stadium, 28 July, at which 60, 000  spectators were present
 and which followed the vast parade of all delegations to the
 Festival.     At this ceremonial overture, virtually all the lead-
 ers of the Soviet Communist Party were present to give com-
 plete Party sanction to the proceedings.                                   Led by Khrushchev
 and Voroshilov (who was the main speaker), the following mem-

 bers or candidate-members of the CPSU Presidium officiated:
 Belyayev, Brezhnev, Bulganin, Voroshilov, Zhukov, Ignatov,
 Kirichenko, Kuusinen, Suslov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, Shvernik,
 Mukhitdinov, Pospelov, Kirilenko, Mazurov, Mzhavandze and
 Pervukhin.  Moscow Radio in an international broadcast report-
 ed that these leaders were greeted by the crowd with "tempestu-
 ous and prolonged applause.''
 22. Voroshilov, on behalf of the Party and Soviet
 governmental hierarchy, made a.fully orthodox. Communist
 (i.e. Marxist-Leninist) ideological opening speech.  After a
 formal note of welcome and the usual platitudes about the "con-
 tribution to . . . the cause of consolidating peace and friend-
 ship on earth . . ., " and emphasizing that "we have never im-
 posed nor are we going to impose our ideas or our views on
 anyone; " Voroshilov concluded:  "And if the great ideas of
 socialism triumph in the course of historic development and
 even more countries and peoples take the road of socialist
 development, that of course, is not a matter of propaganda.
 It is a law governing toe historical development of spciety,
 for socialism is the most progressive social system, the one
 most suited to satisfy the needs and aspirations of the peoples
 B.    The Vocational Meetings, Seminars and Special
 Get-togeethers
 23. Apart from the great parades, pageants,
 sports events, concerts and dances, much greater stress was
 laid in the 1957 Festival than in previous ones on the get-
 togethers of delegates on the basis of common vocational,
 hobby and intellectual interests.  The vocation or "profession-
 al" meetings embraced a large number of trades and profes-
 sions, including dockers, miners, journalists, builders, rail-
 roadmen, engineers, printers, teachers, salaried workers and
 other groups.  Agenda  were prepared in advance and a vast

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 amount of pre-Festival literature was mailed out describing
 details of these meetings.  Similarly, meetings of different
 hobbyists   stamp collectors, radio amateurs, hikers, photo-
 graphers                                       were held.  The number and variety of student
 seminars in 1957 exceeded that of any previous Festival.  At
 the close, the International Committee stated that there had
 been 24 vocational and professional meetings, hundreds of
 meetings between delegations, numerous regional and nation-
 al meetings, and 2.0 student seminars.
 24.  This battery of meetings represented the
 serious program of the Festival.  In them the political and
 propaganda purposes of the Communist leaders were speci-
 fically but subtly developed.  The vocational meetings pro-
 vided the opportunity for influencing the younger people in
 the various arts, crafts and professions which are practiced
 in most countries.   These were part of a continuing program
 of the WFDY and IUS, followed up by a number of other voca-
 tional meetings organized during each year between the Festi-
 vals to tie the work of the youthful auxiliaries into that of the
 adult international fronts.  The student seminars, organized
 by the IUS, are designed to appeal to' the particular intellec-
 tual, economic and social interests of students as against
 those of youth generally, who are the province of WFDY.  As
 one Soviet writer remarked: "Festival meetings have not been
 arranged solely to allow the delegates to embrace one another,
 exchange badges, and sing songs and dance.  They are arranged
 so that they can talk things over soberly, debate and discuss
 problems. 11                          i
 1The elders in the various vocational fields are approached
 through the various specialized Communist front organizations
 such as those covering scientific workers, lawyers, doctors,
 journalists, skilled and unskilled labor.

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 25. At past Festivals and other international youth
 group meetings, the Communist propaganda content and tactics
 had often been obvious and heavy-handed.  At the 1957 Festival
 there was a much greater appearance of objective discussion.
 In several instances, since more non-Communists had come
 to the Festival than had probably been anticipated, there were
 some surprisingly forthright exchanges of views.  In a number
 of notable instances the Soviet positions on an issue were open-
 ly attacked by Free World delegates.  To this extent the Soviet
 sponsors exposed their youth to the "contamination" of non-
 Communist ideas.  Having declared that these meetings were
 "open to all" regardless of political orientation, the Commu-
 nists often found themselves faced by embarrassingly strong
 counter-arguments.  In such cases they had to marshal their
 forces quickly so as to prevent the dissemination of facts and
 ideas which might become subversive to the Communist cause.
 Two examples of such meetings were the Philosophy Seminar
 and the Economic Seminar.
 The Philosophy Seminar
 26.  This seminar, held at Moscow University, was
 attended by 500 delegates and was presided over by the Secre-
 tary of the Festival Preparatory Committee, an indication of
 the importance of the event.  Advance copies of the lecture by
 T. I. Oyzerman, Moscow University Professor of Philosophy,
 were handed out, together with propaganda pamphlets present-
 ing the Soviet line on Hungary.  The introductory speaker was
 another Soviet professor who summarized the main speaker's
 thesis that the development of human society is based on sci-
 entific laws and can accordingly be predicted.  Professor
 Oyzerman then summarized his opus orally.
 27. In the morning session, anti-Marxist speakers
 predominated and were applauded spontaneously by the audience,
 a majority of which seemed to be non-Marxist. The Commu-
 nists apparently went into a huddle during the noon recess, for
 the temper of the afternoon session was decidedly different.

 Communist speakers heavily outnumbered non-Communists
 only a West German and a Pole held forth against ten pro-
 Communist speakers.  The latter also dropped their intellec-
 tual or pseudo-intellectual armor in, favor of.highly-charged
 emotional appeals aimed principally at the non-European
 audience.  The Communists were well-dispersed in the aud-
 ience and used the organized-claque method of applauding the
 demagogic. utterances of party-line speakers and of showing
 disapproval of opposition speakers.
 28.  Of the apparently anti-Communist speakers,
 the most effective were two Poles, an East German professor,
 an Italian and a West German.  A non-Communist speaker
 from the Cameroons served to belie the appearance of mono-
 lithic Afro-Asian solidarity with the Soviets.  The East Ger-
 man speaker provided the greatest surprise, even though his
 heretical views were properly coated with Marxian sugar.  The
 Poles were the best prepared and in their quiet way the most
 dangerous to the Communists.  One of the Poles argued that
 the questions posed by Professor Oyzerman demanded certain
 set answers, which was not a proper philosophical approach.
 After six straight party line speakers had all but turned the
 '(seminar". into an apparent Communist propaganda victory,
 one of the Poles had the temerity to challenge the validity of
 Marxism itself as the basis for interpreting events.  Accord-
 ing to an official Western report the Pole stated:
 The theory of Marx'.is inadequate because
 it does not indicate how one can tell which theory,
 which prediction, is really proletarian.  Both Yugo-
 slavia and the Soviet Union, for example, claim to be
 Marxist, but who can deny that contradictions exist
 between them.  In the past, it sufficed to call any
 theory bourgeois in order to preclude discussion.  If
 a new theory was to be introduced, it was labeled
 proletarian and had to be accepted by them as scien-

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 tific theory.  After the war, the accepted theory was
 that an economic collapse would occur in the West,
 but this did not happen.  Some people say that only
 their theory is scientific but this is not true.  Science
 consists of the interaction of many conflicting theories.
 . . . In a creative discussion, the scientific truth (or
 lack of truth) of a statement would be determined on
 the basis of objective scientific examination.   Dog-
 matic, literal interpretation of Marxism cannot be
 valid.  Marxism may remain valid for the future if it
 is taken as a general undogmatic approach, but not
 otherwise.
 The Economics Seminar
 29. During the International Seminar for students
 of Economics, a British delegate told Communist participants
 that their use of the word "capitalism" was completely emo-
 tional.                             He said that they judge British public opinion by such
 papers as the Daily Worker, whose readers. represent only
 one-half of one percent of the British population.  The dele-
 gate went on to discuss the merits of the British economic
 system, which he termed. "dynamic. " Britain, he said, had
 found a happy mean between the power of the state and the
 individual.
 30. Another speaker, a French delegate, de-
 plored the tendency to emphasize only the negative aspects
 of "colonialism. 't He pointed out that colonial powers had
 contributed a great deal in laying the foundations for further
 advance in underdeveloped countries.  Both the British and
 French delegates were applauded by the seminar participants.

 C.   The U. S. Participants - Surprise of the
 Festival
 31. About 160 Americans (ages late teens to late
 201s) arrived in Moscow for the Festival, despite official dis-
 couragement by the Department of State.  The Department's
 policy had been based on the position that the event was patent-
 ly a Communist propaganda show and that the presence of young
 Americans would tend to lend dignity to the occasion and would
 be exploited by the Communists as evidence of tacit US approv-
 al of the Festival.  This, it was felt, would be undesirable,
 particularly after the recent violent suppression of youth in
 Hungary.  It was not foreseen at the time that the propaganda
 intent of the Soviet sponsors would backfire in two important
 respects- (a)  that Soviet youth and large sections of the Mos-
 cow public would be exposed to facts and truths about the. US
 and the West which they had not known before, and (b) that
 the discussion and contacts with the Americans would dis-
 close in the full glare of world publicity some of the genuine
 doubts and questionings of Soviet youth,
 32.  The American group was. not trapped into hav-
 ing itself labeled as a. "delegation. !'  The Festival managers
 wanted the group to carry a banner in the big stadium parade
 reading "US Delegation for Peace and Friendship, "  but the
 majority insisted that the banner should read "US Participants
 Salute World Youth. " Aside from being definitely "unofficial, "
 the small American representation was also largely unorgana ;

 ously, despite the fact that the preparations for the Festival
 were under Communist-front auspices, knowledgeable observ-
 ers estimated that no more than 15%Q of those who arrived in
 Moscow were young Communists or sympathizers.  The re-
 maining 85% were non-Communist and some were militantly
 anti-Communist.  They came from varied backgrounds, and
 from widely diverse educational and social levels. Most of

 them admittedly went for the sheer curiosity of seeing the
 famed capital of the "major enemy" and for the fun provided
 by the vast carnival of parades, dances, sports shows, con-
 certs, and exhibitions, not the least aspect of which was the
 opportunity of meeting and observing young people from strange
 and exotic lands.  This large majority were as politically un-
 sophisticated and as unaware of the subtleties of Communist
 propaganda as most people of their age who have not paid par-
 ticular attention to the world ideological conflict or who have
 not been especially briefed on the subject.
 33.  There were, however, a few - perhaps a
 dozen or more - who had chosen to go to Moscow for more
 serious purposes.  Among these were graduate students of
 Soviet affairs and Russian language, of history, political
 science and economics, and some who were interested in
 music, fine arts and other cultural aspects of the USSR.  It
 was this handful of advanced students and observers who, on
 a voluntary and individual basis, took advantage of every
 opportunity to present effectively and directly to Soviet audi-
 ences the Free World and the US point of view on a host of
 previously "forbidden" issues.  They also observed and re-
 ported publicly for the benefit of Free World readers many
 significant discuslsions with Russian students and other Sov-
 iet young people.
 34.  The extent and variety of the many unexpect-
 ed experiences of the undirected American participants may
 be illustrated by the following:
 a.  They had no trouble in meeting and talk-
 ing to large numbers of the "men-in-the-street" in
 Moscow.  In fact, most of them wherever they went
 were the objects of special attention and at times
 were engulfed by crowds of eager, curious and
 friendly Muscovites of all ages.  Usually the conver-

 sations would begin with two or three questioners,
 with more and more people joining in until large
 gatherings had assembled.  The type of questions
 and of responses are illustrated in an appendix to
 this study.
 b.  The more knowledgeable of the American
 visitors made a special point, whenever opportunity
 offered, of communicating to the listeners the content
 and sometimes the specific language of the report of
 the UN Committee on Hungary.  This condemnation
 of the Soviet Union was previously unknown to the
 listeners, since communications relaying the Report
 had been jammed or censored.  In one dramatic
 instance an American graduate student who ventured
 into Red Square on the rainy first night of the Festi-
 val was buttonholed by curious Soviet youths and
 asked a number of rapid-fire questions.  When he~be-
 gan to read the UN report the crowd grew to about a
 thousand.  "We began to block traffic in Red Square, "
 he reported, "and the police moved us on, so I went
 over to the Lenin Mausoleum and began talking to the
 crowd below.  At least a thousand people were there
 and I had four or five volunteer interpreters from
 the crowd going at once.  People would rush up with
 coats to protect me from the rain.  I talked for hours.
 They disputed many of the things I said about Hungary
 but at the same time they wanted to hear more and
 more.  They wanted to listen to what I had to say.
 This was really the beginning.  We suddenly realized
 how important this was and how much we could really
 accomplish by such conversations.  How anxious, how
 incredibly, insatiably curious the Soviet citizens were,
 how desirous to talk to Americans to find out all there
 was to know about the outside worldl"

 c.  On another occasion the Moscow crowd
 kept the speaker talking until about 2:00 AM.  When
 the gathering broke up, the American found that since
 all streetcars and buses had stopped running, the only
 way he could get to his quarters (some miles away
 from the center of Moscow) was by taxi.  He discov-
 ered that he had no money with him.  When the linger-
 ing crowd learned of this, they "passed the hat" and
 collected more than enough rubles to pay his fare
 home !
 d.  Similar responses were experienced by
 other American students in Red Square, at Moscow
 University, and in other parts of the city.  On sever-
 al occasions they were heckled by young party activ-
 ists but these in turn were told in more than one in-
 stance by others in the audience to "shut up, we want
 to hear what he has to say." The only police interfer-
 ence they encountered (and the Moscow police was out
 in full force to maintain order during the Festival)
 was when the crowds caused traffic jams, as in the
 case mentioned previously, and the Americans were
 merely told to move along to some other less crowded
 spot.  In one case a tired policeman in the late even-
 ing -stood patiently by and asked "Don't you Americans
 ever get tired of talking?  I'm working over-time and
 want to get home. "
 e.  Various US visitors were approached by
 informal groups of Moscow University students for
 discussions on many important issues, in particular
 those concerned with controversies in the field of
 literature,   the fine arts, and music.
 The Americans reported that the Soviet students of Amer-
 ican literature knew only a relatively few American

 35. As against the tangible success of the informed
 young Americans in "getting through" to the Soviet youth and
 general public either by speeches or by answering questions,
 the Soviet authorities made many quite obvious attempts to
 exploit the presence of the Americans for their own purposes.
 These took the form of planted radio and press interviews
 with the few American participants who were pro=Communist
 or with those who were especially naive in their reactions to
 the doings in Moscow, and of sharp denunciations of state-
 ments by non-Communists.  Likewise, small or trivial inci-
 dents were exaggerated to "show ups' the contrary Americans.
 36.  Examples of the arranged interviews were:
 a.  Several broadcasts from Radio Moscow
 for home consumption, for broadcast in English to
 North America and, selectively, in other languages
 to other countries quoting American participants as
 being "impressed" with the Festival and with Moscow,
 thanking their hosts for the privilege of being present
 and repeating the need for "peace and friendship";
 one 19-year-old American student was quoted as des-
 cribing Khrushchev as "fatherly."
 b.  Special broadcasts on pin-pointed subjects
 such as "US Youth says USSR Right on Hungary" and
 excerpts from the speech of an American participant
 in the Hiroshima Day rally, in which the American
 was quoted as saying "we readily join with all the
 youth of the world who denounce all the horrors of
 war" and who argue in favor of the elimination of
 atomic weapons.
 authors.  Among those mentioned several times were Mark
 Twain, Jack London, Dreiser, Hemingway, Steinbeck and
 Howard Fast.  The latter had been extolled to the students as
 a great American "proletarian" writer.  The Soviet listeners
 were apparently amazed to find out that Fast had parted com-
 pany recently with the Communist Party, USA.

 c.  Great radio and press play was given the
 incident of a young theological student with a camera
 who, attempting to shortcut his way to a Festival
 gathering, climbed over a factory fence and walked
 across the factory grounds.  He was arrested and de-
 tained for several hours by the Soviet security police.
 In a broadcast of August 10, Moscow Radio gave a
 lengthy account of the incident, alleging that the young
 ''priest" had taken pictures of a replant working for
 defense" and quoting him as saying that he had taken
 the photographs at the behest of the "consular Section
 of the American Embassy.'"
 37. Other Soviet broadcasts and press stories
 announced that "US Press Admits the Youth Rally a Success"
 and -quoted liberally from a number of prominent American
 newspaper and news services.  They did not fail, however,
 to denounce certain American correspondents (including
 Mr. Daniel Schorr of the Columbia Broadcasting System) for
 "distorting" the news about the Festival and they claimed
 that the Americans participating in the Festival were "annoyed"
 by ways in which activities were treated by the American core
 respondents.
 38.  The concern of the Communist leaders over
 the disturbing influences brought into the Festival by the Amer-
 icans and others from capitalist countries was vividly demon-
 strated by the statement of Alexander N. Shelepin, secretary
 of the Central Committee of the Komsomol (Young Communist
 League).  Writing in Komsomolskaya Pravda after the closing
 of the Festival on August 17, Shelepin said:
 The task of Komsomol organizations, of all lead-
 ing Komsomol organs is now in an organized manner
 to assess the results of the festival, to examine what
 was good and what was bad, thoroughly to analyze

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 everything that took place at the Festival and to draw
 the proper conclusions.  We must be critical of what
 we saw at the Festival for we cannot agree with and
 fully accept what some delegations from the capitalist
 countries showed at the festival.  Komsomol organiza-
 tions must in the future also struggle against the pen-
 etration into our midst of an ideology, morals and
 habits that are alien to us . . .
 Summary of the Soviet Public Reactions to the Amer-
 icans.
 39. A wide variety of reports indicates that the
 reaction of the Moscow public to the American delegation
 must have given the Soviet authorities considerable grounds
 for concern.
 a.  The citizens of Moscow and the youth of
 the city appeared completely genuine in the warmth
 of the welcome which they gave the American's.  While
 this cordiality was extended to other Western delega-
 tions (notably the British) and while there was probably
 greater curiosity concerning the more exotic delega-
 tions from Asia and Africa, the Americans seemed to
 be the focus of the greatest interest.  This may be
 attributable primarily to the fact that these were the
 youth from "the other great power, ' the great - and
 envied - rival of the Soviet Union, the major target
 of incessant hostile Communist propaganda.  The
 Muscovites visibly enjoyed the Americans and ap-
 peared to admire their frankness: even when some of
 the visitors made statements highly critical of the
 Soviet regime.  They wanted to be "liked" a,md res-
 pected by the Americans, and many times expressed
 the wish that more Americans had come to the Festi-
 val.

 b.  Soviet University students were search-
 ingly curious about the United States, culturally and
 economically as well as politically.  By and large they
 were deeply ignorant of this country, reflecting the
 biased teaching and information they have received
 about it; but they showed an eager desire to learn more
 of the fact and realities about the United States, its way
 of life, its outlook and its policies.
 c.  On a more superficial level, many young
 Russians appeared enthusiastic about the "gayer"
 aspects of American life, in particular American jazz
 and other popular music.  All Soviet listeners were
 pleased when an American spoke Russian, even poorly.
 There were very few evidences of animosity and a great
 manifestation of personal friendliness toward Ameri-
 cans in general.
 The China Visit of the US Participants
 40.  One of the largely unanticipated results of the
 American groulh's participation in the Festival was thee invita-
 tion extended by the Chinese delegation on August 9 to all the
 Americans present to visit Communist China.  Free trans-
 portation with all expenses paid for 15 Americans was part of
 the offer; others were asked to pay a token of $100. 00 each.
 41. The invitation caused a bitter rift among the
 American visitors to Moscow.  They were well aware of the
 policy of their government toward the travel of any US citizens
 to Communist China and the invalidity of their passports for
 such a tour.  Reports from participants indicate that the 160
 Americans debated the proposition all night.  The official pos-
 ition was reemphasized by the American Embassy in Moscow
 when one young American delegate on August 10 reported to it
 the nature and circumstances of the offer.  Nevertheless, 41
 of the 160 Americans present in Moscow chose to go despite
 26-

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 the disapproval of their government.  Reports indicate that
 virtually all of those known to be pro-Communist (about 25)
 were among those who elected to go.   Thus more than half
 of'-the delegation to China, were presumably favorably dis-
 posed toward the regime of the country they were visiting.
 The rest were merely curious and gripped by a sense of ad-
 venture in the presence of an opportunity to see the legendary
 and forbidden Communist China at first hand (and at small
 cost).  Several amateur photographers and professional news
 correspondents saw a rare opportunity to make names for
 themselves and earn money.  A number actually did obtain
 assignments from newspapers, wire services, magazines,
 or television networks, but two or three were expelled from
 China on the grounds of improper activities.
 42. Aside from a dozen-or so "impartial," non-
 politically oriented tourists, the group which went to China
 included some three or four militant anti-Communists who
 were motivated by the idea that they could help to offset the
 pro-Communist or "leftish" majority by rendering an objec-
 tive report of the visit.  Two of these walked out on the dele-
 gation, as' a sign of protest before the group's tour was com-
 pleted.  These and a number of other members of the group
 were interviewed by Free World press representatives after
 they left China two of them exited at Hong Kong) and after
 they got home.  The Communist press. and radio, both Chin-
 ese and Soviet, as might be. expected, played up the activities.
 of the group to support Sino-Soviet Bloc propaganda lines..
 43. Among the highlights of these interviews
 may be mentioned:
 a.  The group's itinerary included Peiping,
 Changchun, Dairen, Tientsin, Wuhan, Nanking,
 Shanghai, Canton, and back to Peiping.  All travel
 was by train except for a boat trip from. Wuhan to
 Nanking.  Altogether the group covered 7, 500 miles
 and stayed in China six weeks.

 b.  The whole trip was a conducted "Cook's
 Tour, "" although the Americans were given the im-
 pression at the start they could "see anything they
 wanted. " In fact, they saw a great variety of cities,
 towns, and villages; they talked to hundreds of work-
 ers, farmers, students, intellectuals, and the alleged-
 ly "richest capitalists" in the country who gave parties
 for them.  They visited many Chinese industries
 including steel, auto, textile and silk factories.
 c. The entire group had an interview with
 Chou En-lai.  They asked many questions and received
 what purported to be "frank" answers, coupled with
 some obvious "brain-washing" propaganda.  All the
 Americans who reported this interview felt that Chou
 was "smooth" and would be most persuasive to the
 naive or to those who know nothigg about the back-
 ground of the Chinese Communist regime.
 d.  They received a "warm welcome" wher-
 ever they went but it was not comparable to that given
 by the Muscovites.
 e.  The pro-Communists regarded the living
 conditions of the people and industrial progress as
 "much higher than you might expect";  the non-
 Communists as generally "no worse than was expected. "
 All agreed that there was no comparison with the stand-
 ard of living in the West.
 f.  From the point of view of the Chinese Com-
 munists, the tour was a fairly effective propaganda
 show, although the consensus appeared to be that no
 new "'converts" were made.  Thus, those already
 oriented in favor of Communist China may have been
 confirmed in their views but those unfavorable to it
 did not have their basic opinions changed.

 g.  Non-Communists agreed that greater
 efforts should be made by the Free World to reach
 and to influence the students and other young intellec-
 tuals of Communist China.  Some believed that the
 educated young Chinese are more amenable to values
 and concepts of political and social freedom than their
 Russian counterparts who have been under a Commu-
 nist regime for a much longer period, although there
 were others who were ready to dispute. this view.
 Cooperation Among--Nan-Communist"English. Speak-
 ing Participants..
 44.  The non-Communist American participants
 at. the Moscow Festival found ready and friendly collabora-
 tion not only from their fellow North Americans, the Cana-
 dians, but from the large British delegation and to some ex-
 tent from the Australians and the New Zealanders.  Without
 advance preparation, these unregenerated youth, who enjoyed
 a common bond of language and traditions of free speech and
 debate, formed a tacit and useful alliance.  They lent moral
 and- vocal support to each other in the large public meetings
 and, wherever opportunity offered, in the smaller get-
 togethers and seminars.  There was general agreement.
 among these participants that far more effective results
 could have been achieved if collaboration among the non-
 Communists in all Free World delegations had been planned
 and organized in advance.
 45.  The British delegation, 1, 650. strong, was
 one of the largest and seemingly the most articulate Western
 group at the Festival.  British. reports indicate that more. than
 a thousand were neither Communists nor .fellow-travelers.
 Of these a large number were university graduate students,
 instructors, and other mature young intellectuals, and as
 many as 50 or 60 were especially well-briefed on the Soviet
 Union, on International Communism, and on the intent and
 program of the Festival.  These and other British visitors
 29-
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 demonstrated that they could debate effectively with Soviet
 speakers at pre-arranged meetings, and with questioners and
 hecklers in the Moscow crowds.  At the close of the Festival
 the leader of the British delegation expressed the view that
 . . . while it is recognized that the Government must
 condemn the Youth Festivals . . . (it is hoped) that if
 there is another . . . their expressions of condemna-
 tion will be framed in a way calculated to have a less
 discouraging effect on non-Communists who wish to
 go, and that the organization of parties of briefed
 individuals will be carried out on a bigger scale and
 more comprehensively . . .
 D.  The Intrepid Polish Delegation:  Effective Critics
 of the Kremlin Orthodoxy
 46.  The large Polish delegation (1, 250 members)
 was the surprise of the youth rally on the Bloc side.  It was
 well led, well organized, and highly articulate.  It had been
 expected that the Poles, reflecting the relative liberalization
 which followed the events of the Fall of 1956, would be less'
 rigid and orthodox toward the Party line set for the Festival;
 but it was not anticipated that they would so openly and deftly
 thwart the immediate intent of the Soviet sponsors, nor that
 they would so repeatedly "needle" their hosts.
 47. Among other manifestations of independence,
 the Poles showed continual friendliness to the Americans
 whenever they met.  They arranged for a joint meeting of
 the US, British, Canadian and Polish delegations on August
 10, which the Americans attended in force.  The Russian
 interpreters assigned to this - and indeed all - interdelega-
 tion meetings repeatedly tried to break up conversations be-
 tween the Poles and the Westerners, particularly the Amer-
 icans; but apparently much friendly and informative conver-
 sation,got through.

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 48.  The United States Information Agency reportedl
 that the Polish press wrote extensively on the subject of ideo-
 logical discussions between the Polish youth delegation and the
 Russians.     One article frankly noted:  "The discussion was
 ardent and sharp." One meeting between Polish delegates and
 the representatives of the new French "left-wing" People's
 Movement was devoted to a discussion of workers' councils
 and trade unions in Poland.  This discussion proved difficult
 to control, and Polish reporters indicated that whenever the
 current political situation in Poland was debated, the Poles
 were usually challenged not only by the Russians but also by
 other Bloc participants.
 49.  Polish and Soviet'Writers Meet -  The USIA
 also commented on the fact that among the Polish delegates
 were a number of young writers, who were invited to: an in-
 formal meeting of the Soviet Writers' Club under the chair-
 manship of its secretary, S. Surkov.  The meeting, despite
 the friendly informality stressed by the hosts, revealed a.. deep
 ideological cleavage, rendered all the more striking by.the fact
 that the two groups represented two generations.  The Poles
 were in their 20's; the Russians mostly belonged to an older,
 middle-aged group.     The latter evidently expected that their
 guests would follow the Party line in spite of recent articles
 wh.ich.hadbeen published in the Polish press indicating dis-
 illusionment with Communism.
 50.  The following points emerged at the meeting:
 a.  The rift existing between the Poles and
 the Russians was recognized by both camps.
 b.  The Russians voiced vigorous objection
 to Polish assertions that no creative literary work

 c.  The Soviet writers tried to defend the
 theory that Socialist realism as a base for literary
 work was fully compatible with free development of
 creative writing.
 d.  The Russians accused some of the Poles
 of having nothing in common with Marxism.
 e.  One of the Polish delegates said plainly
 that in his opinion the theory of class struggle is in-
 compatible with full freedom of artistic creation.
 f.  The Poles and the Soviets disagreed on the
 analysis of the works of Gorki.
 51.     The meeting ended on a note of apparent recon-
 ciliation introduced by the Soviet writers.  The leader of the
 Soviet delegation expressed his approval of the discussion and
 its frank nature.  Similar exchanges of views, if started earli-
 er, he declared, could have avoided misunderstanding between
 the Poles and their Soviet colleagues.
 52.  Surkov wound up the proceedings with the
 announcement that he intends to write a book on the recent
 events in Poland.    Yet, in spite of the conciliatory tone of his
 remarks, the observers of the meeting reported that both the
 Poles and the Russians left with a feeling of embitterment.
 It was difficult, if not impossible, to find a common ground
 between the young Poles, who were enjoying a period of polit-
 ical and cultural liberalization at home, and the old-time Com-
 munists who accepted the rigidity of the Party line in literature
 as a matter of fact.  The Poles invoked Mao Tse-tung's doctrine
 of "a hundred flowers" in building their case.

 53.  The activities and attitude of the Polish dele-
 gation seem to have evoked a responsive chord among some
 of the other satellites.  The Czech monthly Kveten in its post-
 Festival issue (October 1957) carried a 3, 000-word article by
 Jiri Sotola reviewing the artistic performances of Cizecho-
 sl.ovaks and others.  Commenting on the contribution of Polish
 youth to literary discussions during the Festival, Sotola
 observed:
 They did not always speak cleverly, but their
 passionate defense of and propaganda for the young
 and younger Polish writers such as Ro.szewicz, Hlasek,
 Drozdowski, Bialoszewski and Harasymovicz not only
 was sincere and won sympathy but also was evidence
 of the fact that young Polish writers are well known in
 their country (at least among students` and that they
 have .many ardent defenders.
 54.  The Soviet press and radio either did not
 report the controversies involving the Poles or, if it did,
 passed them off as examples of "true freedom" and inters .:.
 change of ideas at the Festival.  After the Festival, however,
 when the `thaw " began to give way to a new intellectual freeze,
 Soviet journals leveled attacks on Polish writers in. varigns
 fields, alleging, "unhealthy tendencies" and "revisionist " in-
 fluence.  Although much of the propaganda against the Polish
 revisionists seemed intended to press them to mend their ways,
 it also appeared designed to counteract the attraction of Polish
 views. for those Soviet intellectuals who' were aspiring toward
 greater freedom in their respective fields.  For example, the
 Soviet philosophical journal Questions of Philosophy in an
 article entitled "Is this Marxism?" offered an elaborate crit-
 icism of Polish views in the fields of philosophy and natural
 and social science.

 55.  On October 3, Moscow, broadcast in Polish
 a Komsomolskaya Pravda article by Ktidryavtsev attacking
 the Polish writer Slominski for throwing "a whole bucket of
 dirt" on Soviet literature and art while on a visit to Japan.
 Along with implied warnings to Soviet intellectuals not to
 imitate the Poles, Pravda and Moscow radio gave renewed
 publicity to the intensified Chinese drive against "rightists,
 the sequel to Mao Tse-tung's "contending schools" policy.
 This publicity was probably intended to discourage Soviet
 intellectuals who were looking upon Mao"s doctrine as a
 counter to the regime's demands for strict adherence to
 orthodoxy.
 E.  The Hungarian Delegation:  Most Puppet-Like
 at the Festival.
 56.  In sharp contrast to the Polish delegation,
 that of the new repressive Kadar regime of Hungary appears
 to have been composed largely of young security policemen
 and hard-core young Communists.  By all accounts, it was
 the most obedient and orthodox of any group at the Festival,
 including the Soviet delegation itself.  The Hungarians were
 highly organized and had been intensively briefed for two
 weeks before leaving for Moscow. They were equipped with
 literally truckloads of printed propaganda upholding the new
 regime rand ' the Soviet intervention at the time of the up-
 rising, and denouncing the "Fascist counterrevolutionaries.
 57.  The Hungarian Party daily Nepszabadsag
 on July 23 indicated that the delegation of 1, 100 members was
 well prepared for any difficulties which might arise during the
 Festival.  The Party paper reported that a "dress rehearsal"
 was held in Budapest before their departure aad that the mem-
 bers were in a camp for five days "where they were informed
 about the detailed program of the great event. " It added that
 "the Hungarian youth prepared, themselves also politically for
 the Festival since already the delegations of 50 countries have
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 expressed their desire to meet the members of the Hungarian
 delegation. " The article also mentioned that;
 The delegation will take to Moscow 22-112 tons
 of information pamphlets in view of the great interest
 expected.  Not only do the members of the delegation
 want to tell people what happened in our country in
 October of last year, but also with the help of books
 in many languages, they want to show the truth about
 the counter-revolution and how we continue to build
 the country after the great shock.
 58..  On August 6, a pre-arranged meeting was
 held with the American participants.  According to reports
 from Americans, the Hungarians engaged in a "filibuster"
 which was intended to prevent the Americans from voicing
 any opinions in favor of the young Hungarians - students and
 workers - who had led the revolt against the regime and been
 so bloodily suppressed.  The Hungarian delegates handed out
 large numbers of pamphlets and pictures of the "atrocities"
 committed by the rebels, in particular pictures taken from
 LIFE magazine, showing the shooting ofAVH (secret police)
 members by the rebels.   Two of these AVH men, who claimed
 to have "miraculously" recovered from their wounds, were
 paraded as the heroes of the Hungarian delegation.  The Amer-
 icans present at the meeting became so disgusted with the
 'roffensive" propaganda and manners of the Hungarians that
 they walked out in protest.  Had the Americans been prepared
 and, skilled in debate, they probably could have held their own
 much better against the carefully indoctrinated Hungarians.
 F. , The Israeli Delegation:  Jewish Solidarity Spot-
 lights Dilemma of Soviet Hosts.
 59.  Of the two Israeli delegations of about 100
 members each, one was definitely Communist sponsored.
 The other was equally clearly non-Communist and was com-
 -35-
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 posed of nationalistic, Zionist youth organization representa-
 tives.  This situation presented two dilemmas for the Soviet
 authorities:  First, in view of the intensive propaganda effort
 being made by the Soviet sponsors to show special favor to the
 Arab delegations, the presence of a.nX Israeli representatives
 offered a ticklish problem, particularly in such matters as the
 place and status of the Israelis in parades and other big events,
 and housing and feeding arrangements.  Too much cordiality
 shown the Israelis might offset the red-carpet treatment which
 was reserved for the Arabs.  Second, while it might be rela-
 tively easy to control a Communist delegation or even a mixed
 political group in which the Communists could play a leading
 role, it would be difficult if not impossible to keep a strong
 non-Communist delegation in line.  To suppress it, on the
 other hand, would be to negate the propaganda boast of the
 sponsors that the Festival was intended to be truly open to
 all regardless of their political, racial and religious nature.
 60.  The welcome accorded the Israeli delegates
 by their co=religionists surpassed probably anything antici-
 pated by the Soviet leaders and caused them to take stringent
 measures which served to expose their hand far more than
 they probably desired.  Although the Communist press. of other
 countries (L'Unitl in Italy, L'Humanitiin France, The Daily
 Worker in the USA, and others) reported that in the great par-
 ades                     rab and Israeli. marched "arm in arm, '' the Soviet press
 kept silent on the subject; and well it might, for the Israeli re-
 ported that they were at all times kept away from the Arab youth
 and rigidly segregated in their housing and feeding arrangements.
 Fervent Response of Moscow Jews
 61.  On the other hand, wherever they went the
 Israelis were besieged by fervent. Soviet Jews who wanted to
 know the facts about Israel and Jewish culture and progress.
 Many of them asked if they could be helped to emigrate to the

 "homeland. 1'   Eyewitness reports state that there were emo-
 tional scenes on the Moscow streets and that spontaneous
 demonstrations occurred repeatedly.  "From dawn till well
 after midnight, " a first-hand report from British sources
 states;
 groups of Jews crowded around the living quarters
 of the Israeli delegation although it was far out of town,
 at the 'Timiriazev Academy'. It was a virtual siege and
 every young Israeli leaving the building was immediately
 surrounded by throngs of Jewish youth, with innumerable
 questions about Israel.  The same performance repeated
 itself again and again in the streets of Moscow.  The peak
 of this experience was reached when the Israeli delegation
 visited the Moscow Synagogue.  Many of its members were
 asked to read the weekly portion from the Bible, and the
 thousands of worshippers, with tears of joy in their, eyes,
 gave vent to their emotions and expression of happiness
 which overwhelmed them at the sight of these young men,
 who came to them from. tIe Jewish state, and at .the sound
 of their Hebrew as a. living language     .
 62.  Another report published in the London
 Observer on August 9, 1957, stated that:
 At the first Israeli concert of the Festival, performers
 and listeners alike broke into, tears over the music, and
 afterwards the applauding audience refused to disperse.
 It ended with a triumphal march around the hall with the
 Israeli flag in the lead.  It is clear that it took only the
 general license permitted during the Festival and the
 presence of genuine Israeli representatives to unleash
 that deep-rooted nationalist sentiment simmering just
 beneath the surface of Soviet Jewry.

 63. Apparently fearing the spread of the "Zionist
 danger, '' the Soviet authorities during the second week of the
 Festival took a number of measures to minimize or neutralize
 the effect of the presence of the Israelis.  These included:
 a.  Last minute shifting of scheduled perform-
 ances to out-of-the-way places;
 b.  Arbitrary issuance of tickets to cultural
 events where the Israeli delegation were likely to appear;
 c.  Assignment of extra contingents of police
 to control crowds which gathered around the delegation;
 d.  A request to the delegation to stop distrib-
 uting information pamphlets on the ground that they
 constituted "Zionist propaganda";
 e.  Deceptive measures to conceal the time
 of departure of the Israeli delegation and police control
 At the railway station to avoid any demonstrations.  At
 the end of the Festival, all the Israeli delegates were
 hurriedly shepherded out of the country.  They were
 placed aboard "sealed" trains in the middle of the night
 at isolated stations.  It is reported that somehow, even
 here, a sizeable crowd of Moscow Jews showed up to
 bid them farewell.
 Some Significant Afro-Asian Delegations
 64.  The Egyptians and Syrians:  The Favored
 Become Troublesome.  As was anticipated, the intensified
 Soviet drive - both political and economic - to achieve great-
 er influence in Egypt and Syria led to the delegations from
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 those countries being both the largest and the most specifically
 privileged of any from the Middle East and Africa.  The Egypt-
 ian representation is estimated, according to various reports,
 to have been between a minimum of 550 and a maximum of 663,
 including 21. Egyptian students, at Moscow University.  Fifteen
 Egyptian correspondents- covered the Festival.  The Syrians
 numbered between 450 acid 500.  Ten Syrian correspondents
 accompanied the delegation.  According to reports from ob-
 servers of various nationalities the Egyptians and Syrians were:
 a.  Transported to and from the Festival in
 Soviet ships (at least 8 in number) and provided with
 all accommodations free of charge while they were in
 Moscow.
 b.  Given favored and spotlighted positions in
 the parades and major Festival events.
 c.  Placed in positions of leadership and prom-
 inence in many committees. and organized activities of
 the Festival.
 d.  Given especially prominent notice in the
 Soviet press and broadcasts.
 e.  Given "red-carpet" treatment in housing,
 feeding, entertainment.
 Generally speaking, most non-Communist observers at the
 Festival were of the opinion that the majority of the Egyptians
 and Syrians appeared thoroughly taken in by the Soviet flattery
 and, among all the groups, were the most ardent .and infatuated
 in their emotional pro-Soviet reactions.
 65.  However, a. number of reports indicate that
 there were sour notes even within this Communist-induced
 harmony.      Thus, the Egyptians embarrassed their Soviet hosts
 -39-
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001000220001-5
 at the start of the Festival by carrying a huge picture of Nas-
 ser in the big parade in the Lenin. Stadium.  According to the
 practice dictated by the Communist sponsors of previous Festi-
 vals, national delegations were not supposed to feature the
 names or pictures of their leaders unless they were Commu-
 nists, and even these were proscribed at the Sixth Festival in
 order to maintain the non=political illusion. The Egyptians
 also were reported to have acted like precocious and spoiled
 children, demanding favors, and complaining repeatedly.  One
 of the leaders of the group protested because he had to share
 a room with two other members of the group and also objected
 because the hotel to which he was assigned was "primitive and
 not very clean. "
 66.  Indications of more serious criticism of the
 Soviet Union were reported, by one of the Egyptian delegates
 after he left Moscow.  He was of the opinion that the propa-
 ganda effects of the Festival were considerably offset because
 of the dismal living conditions which were so evident in Moscow.
 He felt that Egypt, although a very poor country, had achieved
 a generally higher standard of living than the "mighty" social
 ist state.  He attributed this backwardness primarily to the lack
 of "liberty" in the USSR.  He further commented that many vis-
 itors to the Festival sold their clothing in the black market
 before they left, even shabby clothes bringing high prices; that
 the people of Moscow were truly hospitable and that he could
 not understand how the Soviet people could continue to endure
 their poor economic conditions.  Noting that Communism is
 illegal in. Egypt he wrote home after leaving the Soviet Union
 that Communists now in prison should be released and deport-
 ed to Moscow.  How much this delegate's views reflect those
 of others in the Egyptian delegation has not been ascertained,
 but he implied that a goodly number shared his opi., iorn.  A re-
 port from another source indicated that the Egyptian delegates
 expressed mass d5.ssatisfa Lion. with the conditions and accom-
 modations on the Soviet ships which took them home.

 67.  The Iraq,:  Young Communists Defy their
 Government's Ban.   The Iraq government, conscious of the
 fact. that plans for sending delegates to the Festival were
 under the direction of the local Communist Party, prohibited
 its youth from attending,  Nevertheless, a considerable num-
 ber of Iraqi appeared.  Observer estimates vary as to the
 actual number, ranging from 35 to 130; the Festival sponsors
 claimed 165.  Perhaps the most reliable report was contained
 in a Baghdad broadcast of September 9, 1957, which stated
 that the Iraqi security authorities had revealed that, the Soviet
 Embassy in-Damascus had recently furnished visas to 98 per-
 sons: who went to the Soviet Union from Iraq via Syria and that
 the Embassy had arranged for the Russian ship "Azaria" to
 take them to the USSR via: Latakia.  The broadcast. stated that
 17 of this group had been arrested upon their return to. Iraq.
 68.  According to observers, the Iraqi delegation
 was predominantly made up of young Communists or pro-
 Communists.  They did not distinguish themselves particularly
 at the Festival but served to strengthen the numerous Arab and
 H`'anti-colonialist" gatherings.  According to the Arab News
 Agency, the Iraqi government felt strongly. enough about the
 flouting of its prohibition against attendance to try 12 of the
 delegates before the Baghdad Criminal Court on October 19.
 The Court gave them sentences ranging from fines of 200
 dinars to a year's imprisonment.  Three of them had con-
 fessed that they went to Moscow with the aid of the Soviet
 Embassy in Damascus.  Five others accused were discharged
 for lack of evidence.  On October 26 the head of the Iraqi dele-
 gation and three other members were arrested.
 69.  The Iranians:       Some Sharp Questions about
 the Soviet Regime. The Iranian government, also, banned
 attendance of its youth at the Festival, yet some ten Iranians
 arrived in Moscow, certainly not all Communist sympathizers.
 Two 'Iranian students, one of whom spoke Russian, manifested
 -41-

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 a sharply critical attitude toward the Soviet regime.  At their
 meeting with the Soviet writers, the Iranians taxed the latter
 with the crimes of Stalin and demanded to know how the cult
 of personality could have arisen in a Marxist-Leninist society.
 The replies to this and subsequent questions asked by the
 Iranians merit verbatim repetition:
 A - The cult of personality was a deviation from Marxism-
 Leninism, and had resulted from the strained interna-
 tional and domestic political situation of the time.
 Q - Why was Stalin denounced only after he had died?  Were
 those who had worked with Stalin in leading positions
 not cowards for having failed to oppose him during
 his lifetime?
 A - During the war Stalin had personified the Russian nation
 and it was impossible to take any action against him.
 Q - And after the war?
 A - The International situation again became strained.
 What are Soviet writers doing now to fight the cult of
 personality?
 A - This is not a subject on which one can write a disserta-
 tion.  However, the film. "The Fall of Berlin, " which
 portrayed Stalin as a genius responsible for winning
 the war  inglehanded and ignored the role of the Party
 and the Army, has been taken off the screens and
 nothing like it can appear again.
 70.    The questioning mood reflected in this ex-
 change probably cannot be taken as symptomatic of the gen-
 eral attitude of Iranian youth toward Communism but it is
 significant that at least two of the delegates had the courage

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP7.8-00915RO01000220001-5
 to express themselves so openly.  Recent reports indicate
 that the Communists are still trying to win converts among
 Iranian youth but that they are not making notable progress.
 A report from a Baghdad Pact committee on Communist sub-
 version among students states that:
 .   . pure Communist ideology has lost much of its
 power among students, at least for the time being,
 and the Tudeh Party is trying to regain it. by various
 means, the main one being. nationalism of the extreme
 and negative type.  The connection between Commu-
 nism and this kind of nationalism is not obvious, but
 it is a fact that International Communism is relying
 very much on it, probably because of its strongly
 anti-Western tendency and also because of its nega-
 tive and destructive character.
 The report estimates that among Iranian students in Europe
 as a whole not more than 10% should be regarded as Commu-
 nist sympathizers.  This does not mean, however, that the
 Communists may not make further headway .among Iranian
 youth in the future, and the fact remains that Iran is regard-
 ed as a priority target country for Soviet propaganda.
 71.  The Black Africans:. Mixed ,Reaction.s.
 No precise count or reliable estimate of the total number of
 delegates from Black Africa - like the Middle East, a major
 target of the Communists - is available.,  Even the totals
 claimed by Festival sponsors are contradictory.  In late June
 1957 the International Preparatory Committee claimed to have
 established "direct contactxi with 18 of the 20 countries in
 Africa and that U289 youth and student organizations" had ex-
 pressed their desire to send representatives to the Festival.
 .Komsomolskaya: Pravda of July 13, 1957, claimed that 305
 delegates from Black Africa and the French Antilles would
 attend.  However, subsequent Soviet broadcasts admitted
 r- n9jarb O
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RQP78-00915R001000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 that little information was available about preparations in the
 ``African colonial countries and that political restrictions made
 it "tremendously difficult" to establish. contact with youth and
 student organizations in Africa and stated that 11126 lads and
 girls from colonial countries of Africa are expected to arrive"
 at the Festival.  Scattered reports from individual Free World
 observers at the Festival indicate that the total number of par-
 ticipants from Black Africa turned out to be somewhat more
 than the low estimate of 126, but considerably less than the
 305 originally targeted.
 72.    The Black Africans were accorded royal
 treatment in public, on TV and radio, and in the Soviet axld
 foreign Party press.  Photographs were featured showing the
 negro delegates arm-in-.arm dancing with.Caucaasian girls,
 swapping autographs, and otherwise intermingl.ng cordially.
 A large exhibition was opened in Moscow devoted to African
 literature.  The relatively few Black Africans were, as might
 be expected, given conspicuous positions in one of the Festi
 val''s major political shows, the "Rally in Solidarity with the
 Youth of Colonial Countries" (August 2).
 73.  The Sudanese were by far the largest dele-
 gation from the area.  It is estimated that they numbered at
 least 100, including some 60 who were students in Western
 Europe and in Soviet satellite countries (East German youth
 sponsored the travel of several of the Sudanese delegates).
 The Sudanese Government decreed that participants in the
 Festival would be prosecuted under the law, although the
 Ministry of Education had alRowed five students to accept
 scholarships offered by Soviet universities.  The Arab News
 Agency reported in November 1957 that the Sudanese govern-
 ment was taking measures against 60 persons who had defied
 the government's prohibition. against attendance at the Festi-
 val.  According to various reports, the Sudanese and many
 of the other Black Africans who did attend were impressed
 by the treatment they were accorded.  An official American

 observer noted that "the impact on the individual delegate
 from these countries must have been considerable," In this
 connection an African representative remarked that "In the
 West children run from me, whereas here they run to me
 asking for my autograph. or just wanting to touch. me.
 74.  The Ghana delegates numbering a mere three
 showed, however, that not all African representatives at the
 Festival were taken in by Communist propaganda.  According
 to a reliable British report, the Ghana trio '''behaved admir-
 ably. ?" At the anti-.colonialist meeting they defended Britain
 against attacks from other delegations and said that "Ghana's
 .independence proved that Britain voluntarily gave independence
 to its colonies when they were ready for it. "The report also
 stated that the Ghania.ns became "thoroughly disgusted" with
 the continued Communist propaganda and went home two days
 before the end of the Festival.
 75.  The l          delegation numbering no more
 than. ten did not speak up as. did the Ghanian.s: but, according
 to an official Nigerian report, they also were not taken in by
 the Communist. appeals.  A warning by Nigerian Federal.
 Commissioner, Mr. M. T. Mou, concerning the exploitation
 of students from overseas who took part in the Festival, was
 quoted in the Nigerian West African Pilot (August Z6).  He
 declared uncompromisingly:
 The Soviet campaign to exploit young people in
 the non-Communist world for its own ends is one of
 the most sinister aspects of Moscow's longterm
 strategy.  Young people who went from Nigeria
 realized that a, special ovation is given to delegates
 from colonial and underdeveloped countries, whose
 sympathies. the Communists are anxious to enlist,
 and were not deceived.

 IV.           GAINS AND LOSSES FOR INTERNATIONAL COM-

 ings of Propaganda Aims, set forth in Section I. B.
 A.  In Imparting a Benign  New Look" to the Soviet
 Union.
 The Soviet View.
 76.  Official Soviet publications leave little doubt
 that the Soviet leaders felt that the Festival had been a success.
 Shelepin, head of the Komsomol, despite his previously quoted
 warning to Soviet youth, said after the close of the Festival:
 The Festival answered the slanderous inventions of
 reactionary propaganda about our country and will
 undoubtedly contribute to the spreading, among the
 youth and population of foreign countries, of the truth
 about . . . the truly popular nature of the Soviet social
 and state order . . . of the flourishing of culture.
 The Festival's International Committee, summing up the re-
 sults of the Festival, stated:
 We met at the Festival in order to discuss in a friend-
 ly manner many vital problems which are agitating
 young people, wherever they may be, whatever polit-
 ical and religious views they may have, and whatever
 nationality they may belong to.
 77.  An even more explicit affirmation of the pos-
 itive achievements of the Festival was set forth by Khrush-
 chev. 1                            In response to the question "Do you consider Youth

 Festivals the ideal way for young people of East and West to
 meet?" Khrushchev replied in part:
 . . The World Youth Festivals have very great
 merits     . One still hears that the World Youth Fe$tii-
 vals are a 'Communist undertaking'.  It is said that
 many of the participants in the Moscow Festival were
 at first inclined to be wary, but on closer acquaint-
 ance they understood that there was. nothing to fear.
 No one wants to impose his ideas or way of life on
 anyone, all want only one thing - to live in peace and
 friendship, enjoy the benefits of science and culture
 and help peoples to move along the road of progress
 and prosperity.  People of different countries have
 different ways of life and thought.  Two different
 systems exist today - socialist and capitalist.  And
 for people living in these states there is no way out
 except to live peacefully side by side with one another,
 to respect each other's opinions.  It seems to me that
 the World Youth Festivals, in bringing together repre-
 sentatives of the younger generation of different na-

 78.  Hundreds of reports giving impressions and
 evaluations of the Moscow Festival, both from official observ-
 ers stationed in Moscow and from the vast press corps, present
 a widely divergent picture of the propaganda effects.  There was
 a large measure of agreement, nevertheless, that the "new face"
 of the Festival was highly specious.  Thus, the Hamburg inde-
 pendent journal Die Welt noted (August 13, 1957):
 this year's magnificent Youth Festival, in Mos-
 cow, which would be impossible anywhere else in the
 world on this scale, and with this make-up served,
 not least, to advertise the Soviet Union and its Com-
 munist social system . . .

 The London News-Chronicle (August 7) in an editorial head-
 ed "The Moscow Circus, "   commented:
 The high jinks in Moscow make agreeable reading.
 Hatred seems to have taken a back seat and the young
 people drawn from nearly all the nations of the earth
 appear to be finding a unity which their elders seek
 in vain.  The underlying tension and hostility between
 the West and the Communist worlds persist.  The
 Youth Festival has a political purpose to fulfill.  The
 News Chronicle believes that contacts between those
 living under Communism and people from the outside
 world does more good than harm, even if the intention
 of the meetings is to make Soviet propaganda.  But we
 must not ignore the fact that to the Kremlin the Youth
 Festival is a weapon in the cold war.
 The London Socialist Commentary (September 1957) wrote:
 . . . The reasons for the generosity of the Soviet
 Government are not far to seek.  After the perform-
 ance of Soviet tanks in Hungary, a far greater price
 would have been worth paying to make of Moscow the
 Mecca of a Peace and Friendship pilgrimage.  The
 Kremlin needed this sign of support not only to break
 through the ring of disgust with which events in Buda-
 pest had surrounded Russia, but also to present to
 their own youth the picture of a world which sees in
 Moscow one place where Peace and Friendship blos-
 som.  This the Soviet leaders achieved.  But they
 paid for it not only with roubles.  Among the 'dele-
 gates' from the democratic West were some who were
 determined to tell the Russians how people really live
 when they are free, and from all accounts it appears
 that the Muscovites eagerly listened to them.  For all
 the noise of the official propaganda,trumpets these

 small voices of truth may have left a lasting effect
 on the minds of those Soviet people who came in con-
 tact with non-Communists from the West.
 Soviet Gains
 79.  The Soviet leadership's desire to create an
 atmosphere of liberality and friendliness was greatly facil-
 itated by the genuine enthusiasm and cordiality of the Moscow
 citizenry. The manifest spontaneity of their welcome to fora
 eigners evoked a warm response even from seasoned non-
 Communist observers, and perhaps served to modify some-
 what their conviction that the Festival wasintended to be
 entirely a rigged Communist show.  The whole show of rela-
 tive moderation and tolerance exhibited during the Festival
 probably created a number of "missionaries of goodwill" who,
 even though not Communists or consciously influenced by
 Communist appeals, would speak well of the Soviet Union
 upon their return home.
 80.  The appearance of open-mindedness and
 "humaneness" probably did far more than any direct propa-
 ganda about Hungary to dull the memory of the agony of
 youth in Budapest.  The ways in which the Poles spoke up
 and generally were permitted to behave in, unorthodox ways
 was also impressive to many Free World as well as Bloc
 participants.
 81.   Above all, the new air of freedom kindled
 hopes among many sincere, idealistic, non-Communist youth
 (and perhaps even among Soviet and Bloc youth) that they were
 truly observing an augury of better things' to come.  The will
 to believe the best about the Soviet regime, and to live peace-
 fully with it, and the hope that it will ultimately achieve con-
 sistence between its professed ideals and. its- evident prac-
 tices, are still strong among many people, serious adults

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 as well as youth.  Americans are not alone among well-
 meaning Westerners in hoping that the Soviet Union will
 become "more like us" and develop into a freer society
 and a force for peace in the world.
 Soviet Los se ,s
 82.  In some aspects the show of liberality was
 rather heavy-handed.  Although the police did not interfere
 with non-Communist speakers, they did conduct surveillance
 and interrogation of a number of Soviet citizens who. had con-
 tacted Westerners.  It was quite apparent in some of the
 specialized meetings that the Communists would permit
 free discussion to proceed just so far and then would use
 their customary tactics of taking over and shutting off any .
 undesirable speeches or questions.  Some of the student
 seminars and the meetings with Soviet writers and econom-
 ists did much to dispel the myth of the new freedom and open-
 mindedness within the Soviet Union which the Festival spon-
 sors had tried to create.  However, only a relatively small
 number of delegates attended these meetings..
 83.  On. balance, and considering the effects on
 the great mass of attendants at the Festival, it would appear
 that the gains for the USSR exceeded the losses and. that the
 "new look" propaganda aim was probably advanced more
 successfully than any of the other propaganda objectives.
 B. To Help Recoup Soviet Prestige Among Commu-
 nist Oriented Youth of All Countries as Part of
 the Campaign to Stabilize International Com-
 munism.
 84.  The achievement of this aim may be con-
 sidered from three points of view, i. e. the extent to which
 the Festival helped the Soviet Party leadership to (1) rewin
 -50-
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 the loyalty, devotion and respect of youth, within other Corn-
 munist countries; (2.) re-establish itself as the leader, guide
 and mentor of Communist-oriented youth in the Free World,
 and (3) bolster the sagging status among world youth of the
 controversy-ridden major international youth front organi-
 zations, the WFDY and the ITJS.  The gains and losses listed
 below are set forth in terms of these three objectives.
 Soviet Gains
 85.  The record-breaking attendance of some
 35, 000 youth from 131 countries and the world publicity
 given the more glamorous aspects of the Festival undoubted-
 ly succeeded in creating within the Communist world an im-
 pres.sion of resourceful initiative and organizational mastery
 on the part of the Soviet leadership.  The', fact that more than
 half of the visiting delegates were from Free World countries
 - and that a high percentage of those were non-Communist -
 created an added impression of confident strength.  The Sov-
 iet leaders demonstrated that they were willing to take the
 chance, unprecedented in Communist circles, of allowing
 the political heathen to express themselves openly within the
 shadow of the Kremlin itself.  The fact that the Poles were
 allowed previously unimaginable leeway in criticizing certain
 aspects of Soviet life and tendencies within the Communist
 movement must likewise have eased - at least momentarily
 some of the tensions which have been building up among sat-
 ellite youth since the Polish break from Stalinist orthodoxy.
 The great show of camaraderie at the Festival also probably
 tended to black out memories of the agonized cries of Hungar-
 ian youth.
 86.  The impact of the Festival on the Western
 European delegations appears to have been neither better nor
 worse than the Communist sponsors probably expected. Quite
 clearly few new converts were made from the ranks of the
 -51-
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RQP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release CIA-RDP78-009158001000220001-5
 non-Communists but on the other hand, judging by post-
 Festival reactions and events, few of the faithful were lost
 to the cause.  More positive gains were evidenced among the
 Arabs, Asian and Latin American delegates.
 87. The WFDY, which had shown signs a?f a
 weakening in its hold over youth, particularly among its Free
 World affiliates, was no doubt reinvigorated by the outward
 success of the Festival.  Of all the Communist fronts, the
 WFDY had perhaps suffered the greatest losses in prestige
 and membership in the latter days of Stalin.  After Stalin's
 death it had attempted by various tactical innovations to ap-
 peal to non-Communists without changing its highly central-
 ized and authoritarian character.  In the aftermath of the
 20th Party Congress it had "liberalized" itself and loosened
 its hold over its national affiliates.  The reverberations of
 the Hungarian revolt threatened an irreparable split In the
 organization, forcing the WFDY to adopt an unprecedented
 policy of decentralization, placing greater emphasis upon
 bilateral or regional liaisons initiated by national org!aniza-
 tions and subordinating its own role as the dictating, central
 authority.  This reflection of the general "thaw" in world
 Communism, however, was only temporary.  The WWDY's
 role in organizing the "non-political, open to all" Festival
 probably helped restore its standing in international youth
 circles.  The IUS, which had been torn by inner dissent
 particularly after the Hungarian revolt, also must have found
 a badly needed restorative in the activity of the Festival.
 88.  The continuing process of exploiting the
 Moscow Festival was demonstrated by the follow-up meeting
 of the Fourth World Congress of the WFDY held in Kiev
 (16-23 August 1957).  One of the directives of this Congress
 prescribed that correspondence contacts, be maintained with
 all persons who had attended the Moscow event or taken part
 in any of its preparatory activities.  The special emphasis

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 placed by the Communist leaders on the need for extending
 the influence of WFDY and IUS in the Afro-Asian area is
 further evidenced by the decision of the Cairo Afro-Asian
 Solidarity Conference (December 1957-January 1958) to estab-
 lish a regional organization for youth with affiliates through-
 out the area.  The WFDY and IUS were officially represented
 at this conference and have subsequently contributed to the
 implementation of the Conference ?s decisions.  The WFDY
 now claims that it has a total of 94 affiliates in Afro-Asian
 countries with a combined membership of! 35 million young
 people.  (It is assumed, however, that the Communist coun-
 tries of the Far East are included in this total and probably
 provide the major part of the total).
 89.  Preparations for the next, Festival in Vienna
 are likewise being utilized by the WFDY and IUS to strength-
 en themselves organizationally.  Many local, national and
 regional ttpreparatory" committees for the Moscow Festival
 have been kept in being and are now renewing their efforts
 as committees for the Seventh Festival.  It is quite likely
 that these have, in effect, become permanent bodies.  It is
 significant that the WFDY and IUS began their organization-
 al preparations for the next Festival much sooner after the
 last one than ever before in the history of their co-sponsor-
 ship of these events.
 90.  The success of the Moscow Festival as a
 stimulant to future organizational efforts among world youth
 - and also, significantly, as a source of recruitment of
 activists for the International Communist youth movement -
 was proclaimed explicitly) by N. Mikhailov, USSR Minister
 of Culture:
 1
 Novy Mir, No. 10, October 1957.

 From the results of the 6th Festival, from its scope
 and breadth, there must also be drawn the conclusion
 that among the young people there we trained remark-
 able cadres of organizers and propagandists capable
 of rallying millions of young people for unity under
 the banner of a fight for peace and friendship' among
 the peoples.  (Underlining added).
 91.  Complaints were heard from satellite dele-
 gations (in particular the Bulgarians, the Rumanians, and to
 some extent the Czechs) that they were discriminated against
 at the Festival, i. e. given positions of less promineztice than
 they deserved, less favored housing, food, etc.  This is not
 the first time that the "captive" satellite delegates have been
 slighted at Festivals.  It appeared to be a necessary,conse-
 quence of the major effort to court so many other delegations,
 notably those from the Asian-African areas.      Another com-
 plaint - from the Bulgarians at least - was that they were
 'Pput through the wringer" by their own security forces before
 they were permitted to go to Moscow, and were made to feel
 like political suspects rather than faithful supporters, of the
 regime.
 92.  The Poles, while perhaps breathing more
 freely for the moment, because of the leeway given them in
 Moscow, certainly did not become any more convinced of the
 need for a return to orthodoxy.  They. much publicized riots
 over the suppression of the Polish student newspaper Po
 Prostu - which occurred about two months after the festival
 - suggest that the open show of tolerance at the Festival may
 have stimulated the already seething heterodoxy of Pjolisa
 youth.

 C.  In Obtaining Support for Soviet Foreign Policy Aims
 For the "Peace"Campaign
 94.  The most obvious political objective of the
 Festival centered in the theme of "peace and friendship.
 The end purpose was to persuade world youth that the Soviet
 Union was the true champion of peaceful coexistence, nuclear
 disarmament and the cessation of nuclear tests, that the United
 States aggression is the major threat to peace, and that youth
 in all countries should campaign militantly against Western
 air and missile bases and the collective defense arrangements
 between the Free World nations.  The peace motif had pre-
 dominated in past Festivals but in Moscow, it was intensified
 and dramatized by endless repetition.  The opening speeches
 of the Communist leaders, the banners carried and the slo-
 gans: chanted in every parade, the major mass meetings such
 as the Hiroshima Day rally, the ubiquitous white doves - real
 and symbolic - and the massive publicity in print and over the
 radio and television, all proclaimed the peace theme.
 95.  This saturating propaganda effort strikingly
 illustrated the ways in which the International Communist
 front organizations supplement each other.  In this case, the
 WFDY and IUS as organizers of the Festival effectively car-
 ried out on a large scale among youth the, program primarily
 assigned to the World Peace Council.
 96.  The impact of this effort would appear to
 have been greatest among the Communist-influenced youth
 of the uncommitted countries.  Their will-to-believe in the
 Soviet Union as a force for peace, as against the allegedly
 imperialistic and war-mongering Western powers, was prob-
 ably reinforced temporarily by the Moscow display.

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-009158001000220001-5
 97.  It is probable that the peace propaganda also
 affected some of the non-Communists at the Festival, !even
 among those who readily recognized the appeals to youth as
 Soviet political propaganda.  Many indicated that they ;were
 bored by the trite and repetitious slogans.  However, the
 yearning for peace and for surcease from the anxiety over
 nuclear war probably caused some of the more naive and
 idealistic to leave the Festival with the feeling that, after all,
 the Free World powers should make stronger attempts to
 ''meet the USSR halfway. "'   The achievement of even this mixed
 effect would be a gain from the Soviet point of view.  The Com-
 munist leaders do not expect to make full converts to their
 ideology through the Festivals; partial persuasion is a, suffi-
 cient accomplishment.
 D.            Extension of Soviet Influence in the Afro -Asian
 and Latin American Areas
 98.  The pervasive anti-colonialist and anii-
 imperialist programs and the special treatment accorded the
 Arab, Black African and Asian delegates and as a close second,
 the Latin American representatives, were carefully p,anned
 phases of the intensified campaigns to extend Soviet influence
 in the under-developed areas.
 99.  The major Soviet objectives in the Afro
 Asian area are to give support to national liberation move-
 ments; to foster political neutralism; to encourage the'I kind
 of Afro-Asian unity in which the Communist Bloc countries
 of Asia (including the USSR which claims to be an Asian coun-
 try) would be accepted as full and equal partners, entitled to
 preferential political, cultural and economic treatment; to
 promote nationalization of foreign-owned enterprises, to
 create suspicion and if possible outright enmity toward the
 West and particularly the United States, and to develop eco-=
 nomic and, cultural ties with the Soviet Union.  In middle

 Eastern and African countries the youth front organizations
 are of major importance, supplementing the activities of the
 World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU)', the World Peace
 Council and the organizations it inspires such as. the Afro-
 Akan Solidarity Conference (Cairo, December 1957-January
 1958)..  The Soviet purposes in. Latin America are essentially
 the same, although the fostering of suspicion and enmity is
 even more specifically aimed at the United States.
 100.  Since the Moscow Festival, renewed efforts
 have been. made by WFDY and IUS to increase the effective-
 ness. of their programs. in Latin America.  The programs,
 exploiting the recent student demonstrations against the United
 .Staten in several countries, call for solidarity between the
 Latin American and Afro-Asian areas in resisting. "colonial-
 ism" of the United States.  This theme will undoubtedly be
 stressed at the Seventh Festival in Vienna.
 Soviet Gains.
 101.  Upon return to their homelands the Afro-
 Asian, in particular the Egyptian and the Syrian delegates to
 the Festival, agitated for greater efforts on the part of their
 local youth organizations on behalf of Soviet political objec-
 tives, particularly the exacerbation of anti; -Western national-
 ism.  The WFDY Congress at Kiev, after stressing the import-
 ance of the Moscow Festival, outlined as one of the "main pathsr"
 for the activities of the WFDY the rendering of "assistance to
 young people of the colonial countries, " and called for "common
 action" in favor of "rights of self-determination, freedom and
 national independence.'' The Congress, reaffirming its adher-
 ence to "the principles of the Bandung Conference, " empow'
 6redits Executive Committee to organize collectives in all
 countries for the enlargement of the international solidarity
 fund and otherwise to "lend assistance to youth organizations
 in. the colonial countr:ie s.. "

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 102.  Bruno Bernini, Communist President of
 WFDY, summing up the results of the Festival and the Kiev
 Congress, stated that one of the distinguishing features of
 these gatherings "was the high activity displayed by the dele-
 gates from the newly independent countries and colonies"
 (New Times No. 35).
 103.  The Latin American delegations, upon their
 return home, redoubled their efforts to expand or create new
 units of the WFDY and IUS, soliciting the membership of non-
 Communist individuals and organizations.
 104.  Propaganda themes of the Soviet Union, of
 a kind not ordinarily printed in the local non-Communist
 press, were published extensively in the newspapers ,and mag-
 azines of many Afro-Asian and Latin American countries as
 a result of the world focus on the Festival.  News reports
 and interviews with: returning delegates frequently stressed
 the "great progress" of the Soviet Union, the "great" city of
 Moscow and the "magnificence" of the Festival.  Among the
 other post-Festival WFDY-IUS activities in the Asian-African
 area were the sponsoring of ;youth and student conferences,
 congresses, seminars and local "festivals" variously', in such
 countries as Egypt, the Sudan and Senegal.  Meetings, of this
 type are regarded by the WFDY and IUS as important, `bridges"
 enabling them to make contact with leaders of non-member
 organizations in target areas and as a means of propagandiz-
 ing the "identity" of WFDY-IUS objectives and policies with
 those of the bona-fide national youth organizations, thus pav-
 ing the way for the kind of united front desired by the Commu-
 nists.
 Soviet Losses
 105.  Despite extensive Communist penetration
 of the delegations from. the "underdeveloped" areas, there
 was a strong note of anti-Communism.  We have mentioned
 -58-
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 above the critical, sometimes caustic, comments of delegates
 from Egypt, Iraq, and Iran; and the questioning attitude of the
 Ghana delegates dramatized by their walkout from the Festival.
 Several of the Latin American delegates, previously regarded
 as pro-Communist, upon their return expressed sharply crit-
 ical. views.  Thus, a Brazilian state deputy - a delegate to the
 Festival who had been regarded as pro-Communist - in a speech
 before the Sao Paolo Assembly, criticized the Soviet economic
 system, citing the long hours of work and the lack of consumer
 goods.  Another deputy said that after visiting the Soviet Union
 ?'I am today more convinced than ever that '!Brazil despite every-
 thing is still a paradise. " The President of the Pernambuco
 Assembly and three others, annoyed by the pre-Festival propa-
 ganda and pressures upon the Brazilian delegation, gave up the
 trip in Prague, returned to West Germany and then went home.
 Another deputy, returning to Sao Paolo, gave a.. series of half-
 hour broadcasts on the local radio uncomplimentary to the Festi-
 val and its sponsors.  Members of the Brazilian Bach Chorale
 Society publicly criticized the Soviet regime after their return.
 A Sao Paolo political columnist known for ''leftist" views ad-
 mitted. that he was disillusioned with the "marvel" of the Soviet
 Union after attending the Festival.
 106.  The flattering attention and the repeated
 protestations of Soviet friendship and concern for their coun-
 tries, undoubtedly evoked a considerable emotional response
 in the delegates from the underdeveloped areas.  However,
 the realities of life in the Soviet Union which were readily ob-
 servable behind the glittering Festival fa7ade must have raised
 doubts in the minds of visitors who, though from countries
 which are "backward" from a West European or American
 point of view, in many respects still enjoy! a standard of living
 .superior to that of the average Soviet citizen.  To the delegates
 from the more advanced Latin American countries the contrast
 must have been even sharper.

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-0091 6RO01 000220001-5
 107.  Many delegates from the underdeveloped
 areas talked and made friends with Western non-Communist
 delegates, perhaps for the first time in their lives.  These
 person-to-person contacts. were in sharp contrast to the rigged
 meetings and the staged propaganda of the Communists.
 E.   To Curb Dissent and Bolster the Faith. of Soviet
 Youth in the Strength and. Wisdom of the Party
 Soviet Gains
 108.  The Festival provided a colorful, glamor-
 ous and "harmonious" environment in which to deliver special
 exhortations to Soviet youth not only to act as. exempt ,ry hosts
 at the Festival and as leading participants in the various events
 but also to press on to greater work achievements.  In this res-
 pect the Festival was designed to have the same inspiriting
 effect as a gala convention in the Free World.  The speeches
 of Voroshllov (and later Khrushchev), Shelepin and other Com-
 murdst leaders were directed as much to Soviet youth as to
 the delegates from foreign countries.  Throughout the Festi-
 val the Soviet delegates were under strict discipline and guid-
 ance.
 109.  The ability to attract some 35, 000 young
 people from more othan 130 countries was calculated to - and
 probably did - impress the Soviet Union's own youth. with the
 lasting appeal that the regime has abroad (despite the ugly
 Hungarian business), with the aplomb of the leaders in',going
 ahead with the Festival in a time of troubles and with the con-
 tinuing efficiency and dispatch of the party in orgathzin+g, and
 conducting such a vast and varied enterprise.
 110.  The show of bonhomie toward so many young
 men and women from all over the world, the unprecedented
 freedom given non-Communists to speak their minds and to
 mingle with the crowds in Moscow (although it was knew: n that

 the police were always. lurking in the background) must have
 at least momentarily confused some of the questioning Soviet
 youth.. and caused them. to wonder if this was truly a sign of
 better things to come.
 1.11.  Soviet patriotism rode high from the initial
 great opening ceremony at Lenin. Stadium through the ballets,
 concerts, exhibits and the big sports events:.  The Soviet lead-
 ers must have attached great weight to this manifestation of
 national pride and to its after-effects.
 Soviet Losses
 112.  As indicated in _ Shelepin's strong warning to
 Soviet:. youth against contamination of "alien ideas, habits and
 customs, ft afd in subsequent admonitions by other Communist
 spokesmen,    the regime itself admitted the incursion of some
 'LOne of the most explicit admissions by the Soviet regime that.
 dissent exists within the ranks of its, students is contained in an
 article "An Important Political Task - Upbringing of Students"
 by Professor A. D. Alexandrov of the USSR Academy of Sciences
 and rector of the A. A. Zhdanov Leningrad State University in
 Vestnik Vyshei Shkoly No. 3, March 1958.  Repeating the.theme
 that "this intelligentsia must be completely devoted to the cause
 of Communism" and that "criticism of defects in our work" is
 essential in achieving that goal, the university rector admits
 that "the general enthusiastic activity of the students is some-
 times, accompanied by unhealthy phenomena. indicating insuffi-
 cient social consciousness on the part of some of the students
 . . . Such students often . . . raise political questions without
 trying to acquire a serious grasp of them; when they talk of
 literature and art, they chase after originality; and they pass
 ,judgment on matters left undone without any idea of the work
 already accomplished to overcome the omissions.. Extremes
 are encountered - the grossest violations of carder, amoral

 unwelcome and "dangerous" manifestations at the Festival.
 The counter-infection, spread primarily by the Western dele-
 gates, but also by those from such countries as Iran and Ghana,
 was of a cultural and social as well as a political character.
 The strictures of the Party, Komsomol and educational lead-
 ers during and after the Festival appeared to have been as much
 directed against the potentially subversive impact of freedom in
 the arts (abstract modernism versus "socialist realism") and
 of individualism in literature as against "bourgeois" concepts
 of political freedom.  It also reflected alarm over the'' corrupt-
 ing influences of American jazz and natty Western clothing
 styles upon the "stilyagi, rr who are constantly denounced as
 "idlers, loafers, hooligans and delinquents. "1
 113. Soviet youth were also exposed to corrosive
 effects of apathy and ideological impertinence manifested by
 some of the other Bloc delegates.  The Bulgarians, Ruman-
 ians and Czechs appeared to be strikingly indifferent.  The
 Poles, as noted above, were bold, independent, sharp ques-
 tioners whose views at times bordered on heresy.  While the
 behavior of their satell.te neighbors may not have been dam-
 agingly subversive to Soviet youth, it could scarcely have
 passed unnoticed and may well have remained in the c. nscious-
 ness of the more perceptive individuals.
 acts.  Such instances it must be said are uncommon (and)
 one can deal with harmful talkers and violators of order by
 administrative measures.  The chief thing is that the students

 114.  On balance, it would appear that the Festival
 as a force for bolstering the morale and loyalty of the Soviet
 younger generation was less effective than desired by the Com-
 munist leadership.  Indeed, the generally negative results
 might have been far more apparent had they not been offset
 by the burst of pride which resulted from the post-Festival
 scientific and technological successes symbolized by the sput-
 niks.
 V.         PREVIEW OF THE 1959 FESTIVAL
 A.  Vienna as the Setting for the First Festival to be
 Held in the Free World.
 115.  After considerable vacillation the Commu-
 nist leadership of the WFDY and its partner the IUS have de-
 cided to hold the Seventh World Youth Festival in Vienna from
 26 July to 4 August 11959.  Peking and Prague had previously
 been proposed, and Colombo, Ceylon, was considered as the
 first Free World capital for the event.  Subsequently Vienna
 was selected, and negotiations were opened with the Austrian
 Federal Government in order to make the, requisite plans and
 arrangements.  The City of Vienna objected strenuously on
 the grounds that the mass influx of youth delegates in mid-
 summer would adversely affect the prosperous tourist trade.
 The views of the Federal Government seem to have prevailed,
 however, and preparations are now being made for the hold-
 ing of the event in Vienna.
 Why Was Vienna Chosen?
 116.  Apparently the Communist leadership of the
 international youth front organizations first promoted Vienna
 as the scene for the Seventh Festival through the affiliated
 Austrian Communist youth organization ('OEJ) which held its

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Fifth Federal Congress in Vienna on 7-8 December 1957.
 Subsequently the WFDY held a conference in Vienna, decided
 to accept the "invitation" of the Austrian youth organization,
 and recommended that an already-scheduled meeting i a Stock-
 holm in March 1958 discuss the preparatory work and select
 an international festival committee to be responsible for the
 preparations.
 117.  Experienced Western observers of Commu-
 nist sponsored youth festivals offer the following reasons why
 Vienna was preferred for the 1959 Festival:
 a.  The Communists want to "legitimize" the
 festivals and their sponsoring front organizations by
 maintaining the impression that they are cultural and
 nonpolitical in nature and are "open to all. " 'the Kiev
 Congress of the WFDY urged "cooperation with all youth
 organizations, both national and international, ra stated
 that the activities of the WFDY Pare open to all forces
 desiring to take part in them" and instructed its Execu-
 tive Committee to continue or undertake during 1958-9
 measures that would promote "acquaintance and cooper-
 ation between youth organizations of countries with dif-
 ferent economic and social systems. " The Communist
 leadership undoubtedly feels these aims can be achieved
 with greater plausibility if the next Festival is held
 within the Free World.
 b.  A neutral country will provide a suitable
 psychological environment for the repetition of the
 "peace" themes which are predominant in Soviet j6reign
 policy propaganda.
 c.  For the Soviet view a small neutral and
 nearby country such as Austria is amenable to Soviet
 pressures and t iere.fbre`is_zi,ot Hkely?a tie, or to per--
 mit, any strong actions against the Festival.

 rTT1TT Mi A'f
 d.  More youth representatives from uncom-
 mitted countries may be induced to come to a free,
 neutral country like Austria than would be the case if
 the Festival were again held behind the Iron Curtain.
 There would also probably be fewer' restrictions placed
 by Free World governments on the travel of their youth
 to Vienna as against a Bloc capital..
 e.  The danger of contamination by Free World
 ideas will be limited to the relatively few official and
 well-indoctrinated delegates from Bloc countries, where-
 as larger masses of youth might be affected - as in
 Moscow - if the Festival were again held in a Commu-
 nist country.
 f.  Vienna of all Free World capitals has been
 willing to permit the maintenance of the headquarters of
 Communist front organizations, and has perhaps been
 more amenable than any other to Soviet pressures.  If,
 however, the Austrian authorities   influenced by polit-
 ical parties and youth organizations opposed to the Festi-
 val - should decide to cancel the invitation, the Commu-
 nist sponsors could readily shift the event to nearby
 Prague.
 Austrian Opposition to the Seventh Festival
 118.  Since the Government's decision to permit
 the holding of the Festival in Vienna, Austrian political parties
 and youth groups have expressed strong opposition.  The Social
 Democratic Party has forbidden its members to participate: in
 the event.  Deputies of the Freiheitliche Partei Oesterreichs
 criticized the Government in Parliament for permitting Vienna
 to become the site for the event.  In reply the Austrian Chan-
 cellor said that as a free and democratic state Austria could
 not have refused.

 119.  At its Congress on 6 May 1958, the Austrian
 National Union of Students voted to maintain strict avoidance
 of contacts with Communist-dominated youth organizations and
 not only to boycott the Seventh Festival but also to undertake
 definite steps against it.  Subsequently the NUS formed a united
 action committee with the various Conservative and Catholic
 youth groups to plan for peaceful but positive counteraction.
 120.  Despite these sentiments, there appears to
 be the same kind of difference of opinion among non-C smmu-
 nists in Austria about the wisest course to be taken toward the
 Festival that is evident in other parts of,the Free World. While
 the Catholic newspapers of Graz and Innsbruck were demanding
 in "indignant tones, B' according to the Communist Volk~stimme
 of 18 May, that the Government should throw out the o: i gathze r s
 of the Festival, the more important Catholic journal,   ie Furche,
 editorialized that the West ought to be glad td the oppo4tunity
 afforded by the Festival to show Western achievements to the
 tens of thousands of youth coming to Vienna from Eastern coun-
 tries.
 121.  The Stockholm conference selected a; prepar-
 atory committee (list of names of members is given ini the Ap-
 pendix).  Perhaps the outstanding feature of this preparatory
 committee is the strong emphasis once again placed on repre-
 sentation from the Afro-Asian and Latin American areas.  The
 proportion from these areas is considerably higher than was
 the case in 1957.  Of the 115 committee members of all nation-
 alities, 63 or about 55% are from the African, Asian, and Latin
 American countries combined, as against a total of 73 ', or
 slightly less than 50% of the 150 on the Moscow Festiv V''s prep-
 aratory commission.  On the 1959 commission, 27 of .15, or
 about 23%, are Latin Americans, whereas in 1957 there were
 25 out of 150, or only about 17%, from South and Ce nt7al Amer-
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 ica.  The percentage from the Afro-Asian' countries remains
 about the same for the Sixth and Seventh Festivals.  This
 representation would appear to indicate that appeals to the
 underdeveloped areas will be as much or more a feature of
 the Vienna as of the Moscow Festival.
 Fewer Delegates, Fewer Student Seminars.
 122.  While the general pattern of past youth festi-
 vals will undoubtedly be followed in the forthcoming one, there
 may be some changes in its scope and emphasis.  As previously
 noted, the 1959 Festival will be shorter and smaller than the
 Moscow event (nine days as compared with fourteen; 17, 000
 delegates from 124 countries instead of approximately 35, 000
 from 131 countries).  The Communists have not as yet offered
 an explanation for this reduction.  As previously indicated,
 however, it can be conjectured that the complaint of many del-
 egates at the Moscow gathering - including some from the Bloc
 countries - that the events in Moscow were over-extended and
 produced a feeling of ennui among the participants has been
 heeded by the sponsors.  Repetition and dragging out of the
 same themes, slogans and stimulated enthusiasm can defeat
 their own purposes if carried too far.  The cut in delegates
 is probably in part a .response to the plea of the Austrian author-
 ities that the Festival not be the cause of crowding out any more
 of.the regular summer visitors than is absolutely necessary.
 The decision to reduce the numbers is also probably the result
 of the Communists' belief that they can now easily control and
 manipulate the fewer delegates in a foreign environment.
 Recent information indicates that the Western delegations will
 be cut more than. proportionately in order to make room for
 larger groups from the underdeveloped areas.  Finally, it is
 believed that finances must be a factor. . Even if the estimated
 cost of the Moscow Festival of about 100 million dollars is re-
 garded as somewhat high, nevertheless the expenditure by the
 Soviet Union was still a huge one.  Since much of the expense
 of the Vienna event will probably have to be paid in Austrian.

 currency rather than in rubles, it would put an added Strain
 on the Communist treasury unless the total cost were to be
 substantially reduced.
 123.  The commission has also decided that the
 experience of the past Festival shows the need to reduce the
 number of seminars.  (It will be remembered that the 'student
 seminars in Moscow proved particularly troublesome to the
 Communist leaders).  The committee at present intends to
 limit the student seminars in 1959 to the following:
 a.  On methods of higher education.
 b.  On the problems of technical progress
 and its relation to social development and technical
 education.
 c.  On the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
 d.  On. the problems of the economy of colonial
 and under-developed countries.
 e.  On the role of students and their organi-
 zations in the public life of independent and colonial
 countries.
 The only one of these topics that is similar to those at'the
 1957 Festival is the one on the peaceful uses of atomic: energy.
 It would appear significant that such outstandingly well-
 attended seminars as those in Economics, Philosophy,', and
 Literature at the Moscow Festival will not be repeated in
 Vienna, presumably because these were the "controversial"
 fields which gave too much opportunity for challenging' the Com-
 munist line.  The faculty meetings included in the Moscow pro-
 gram have been re-named "study tours, " and while recom-
 mended by the commission, the terms betray hesitation and a
 -68-
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 deliberate vagueness of approach.  There is a long list of
 seminar topics which include biology, mining, electricity,
 astronomy, music, films and others, but there are no indi-
 cations of the form or length of the meetings, people who
 would conduct them, or their purpose other than to facilitate
 an exchange of ideas between students engaged in the same
 type of studies.
 124.  According to USIA, the growing importance
 of the seminars as propaganda vehicles is evident fron the
 proposed agenda for Student Day. 1 It is to reach a climax
 at the opening of the seminar on the role of students and their
 organizations in the public life of independent and colonial
 countries. Besides perennial anti-colonial slogans, the sub-
 j.ects. will probably include the condemnation of Anglo-Amer-
 ican intervention in the Middle East and the role of stud.nts
 in the anti-Nixon demonstrations in Latin America.  Two
 other seminars, described as "important" without further
 speci.ficati.on, are also to be initiated on that day.
 125.  The IUS is. in charge of planning all the
 student activities.  The seminars and study tours are to be
 held in the International Student Club, which the preparatory
 committee envisages ag-a permanent center, presumably to
 be left in Vienna as a memento of the Festival.  The club is
 to include a special student restaurant, a, lecture hall, an
 information center and rooms for private, discussions.  The
 program does not indicate whether IUS contemplates erecting
 a new building for this purpose or acquiring an existing prop-
 erty.  In either event, the Austrian authorities, who in the
 past have taken pains to expel other front', organizations, will
 have the final word.  The establishment of a permanent IUS
 center in Vienna, under whatever auspices or lab.( . .11, may

 prove to be more than neutral Austria would see fit to tolerate.
 The Vocational and Study Interest Meetings Proposed.
 126.  The committee has proposed that the! voca-
 tional meetings be arranged so as to attract more students and
 not merely the journeymen practitoners in the various fields.
 Meetings between students engaged in the same studie  or tak-
 ing an interest in the same questions are stated to be                        very
 desirable. " The commission suggests that the IPC shs!uld
 consider, in the light of the possibilities at the venue of the
 Festival, organizing the following vocational and professional
 meetings:
 Biology
 Geology
 Chemistry
 Agriculture
 Medicine
 Mines
 Electricity
 Mathematics & Physics
 Architecture & Building
 Astronomy
 Inter-space Travel
 Organization of Economy
 Theology
 Philosophy
 Law
 History and Archaeology
 Teaching
 Literature and' Philology
 Music
 Plastic Arts
 Film
 Foreign Trade,
 Physical Culture
 and Sport
 Student Cooperation
 127'.  Preparations for the cultural and sports
 events appear to be following the programs of past Festivals
 very closely.  The Soviet Government will send the Bolshoi
 Ballet and other dance troupes.  Thee will be exhibitions i r
 the fine arts and the usual contests in all the arts.  Hobbyists
 will again be provided with special attractions.

 1Z&.  The program planners can be counted on to
 assure the customarily large number of regional and inter-
 delegation                              meetings.  At the Warsaw (1955) .and Moscow Fezti-
 vals, the Soviet delegation performed the formidable feat of
 calling in person on practically every non-Bloc delegation.
 The Chinese delegation performed similarly in Moscow, and
 other :Bloc delegations were also assigned to call on Free World
 representatives.  Much of the important political business of the
 Festivals is conducted by means of the inter-delegation meetings.
 A striking example at Moscow was the visit of the Chinese dele-
 gation.to the American participants at which time the invitation
 to tour Communist China was extended.  The acceptance of this
 invitation and the subsequent events, were cited by the Soviets as
 constituting one of the real "successes" of the Festival.  (The
 Americans were also called on. by the Soviet, the Hungarian,
 and the Polish delegations).
 129.  It should be emphasized that all meetings at
 the Festival, no matter how innocuously non-political they may
 appear to be - such as the vocational, artistic, hobby and even
 the sports get-togethers. - are designed by the Communists to
 have an ideological and propaganda content', and to lead to the
 adoption of proposals for action.  Free World participants in
 such get-togethers should be aware of this Communist intent
 so that they will not be taken in.. At the same time, they
 should be prepared to take advantage of any of the open dis-
 cussions or question periods which occur at such meetings.
 The smaller meetings, in fact, offer far greater possibilities
 for opposing voices to make themselves heard.  They are not,
 and probably cannot be, so completely rigged and controlled
 as the large mass meetings at which few or any get a chance
 to speak.
 The Propaganda Aims and Probable: Themes of the
 Vienna Festival.
 130.  At this time there are indications that the
 organizers of the Vienna Festival are still somewhat uncertain
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 about the precise content of the program for the event,' and
 they appear to lack their usual confidence regarding its. ultimate
 success.  As late as September 1958, dispatches of the IPC to
 organizing committees throughout the world betrayed concern
 about existing opposition, particularly that of the Austria  youth
 organizations, pled  for stronger support, and implied that plans
 have not progressed as well as they should have.  Thel risks in-
 volved in choosing a Western country for the Festival apparent-
 ly are making themselves evident early in the planning phase.
 131.  From the propaganda standpoint, it is clearly
 the. intent of the organizers to serve essentially the same aims
 and to- repeat the same basic themes as in the case of the Mos-
 cow Festival., although there will probably be several changes
 in emphasis and refinements in detail.  The language Of the
 preparatory committee's early general announcements sounds
 almost identical with that of the Sixth Festival.  The committee
 in March 1958 stated that there was unanimous agreentent that
 "The Seventh Festival must be an event devoted to friendly
 meetings and mutual understanding for 'peace and friendship"'
 and that it "should be open to all organizations and to All young
 people without discrimination as to their religious or political
 opinions, race or nationality.  No political, philosopht'cal or
 religious tendency should dominate the Festival. " This also
 echoes almost verbatim the language of the directives of the
 WFDY's Kiev Congress and is very similar to the s-, b Lance
 of the CPSU's. most recent slogans directed at united front
 efforts and at the role of youth.  Tho statement con.f sins the
 view that. the major motifs of the Moscow gathering - 1'peace"
 and the attempt to create an atmosphere of open-minded inter-
 national togetherness - will continue to predominate in Vienna. 1
 1That the "hard" and the "soft" line represent a continuu.urn of
 tactics in the youth, as in other fronts, was sharply demon-
 strated by the IUS Congress at Peking, 4-13. September 1958, -

 132.  The more specific propaganda themes of
 the Vienna Festival will. also be in large part a repetition of
 those of the 1957 Festival, updated and tailored to serve the
 current Soviet and Communist Chinese political ends.  In
 view of the resolutions of the WFDY Congress and of the
 recent statements about preparations for the Seventh. Festival,
 the major Communist propaganda efforts in Vienna will be
 directed toward well established targets.
 (I)     "Solidarity" with Youth of the Colonial Countries
 133.  Appeals to the young people of the colonial
 and other underdeveloped areas (including the Middle East,
 Africa, Asia and Latin-America) will be one of the most in-
 sistent features of the Vienna Festival.  The WFDY Congress
 proclaimed that "the existence of colonialism is dangerous to
 all humanity and there is need for agreemOnt between all
 youth organizations for the purpose of expediting its abolish-
 ment." The Congress instructed the Executive Committee
 "to support or launch measures to advanc' the struggle of
 the young people in all colonial countries. r' As previously
 stated, the Executive committee was also directed to organ-
 ize collections in all countries for the international solidarity
 fund to help finance WFDY activities in the Afro-Asian area.
 Undoubtedly WFDY expects a substantial amount to be col-
 lected at the Festival for this purpose.
 the most shrill, blatantly political IUS meeting since the 1950
 Congress: in Prague.  Most of the time waa spent in denounc-
 ing American "imperialism, p' calling for the "liquidation" of
 Western military bases and the withdrawal of Western troops
 from foreign soil, propagandizing for such immediate Com-
 munist Chinese aims as the evacuation of the offshore islands
 and organizing noisy mass demonstrations, against US Secre-
 tary of State Dulles, the US Seventh Fleet and the American
 convoying of supplies to the offshore islands.

 134.  Current issues of WFDY and IUS publica-
 tions, looking toward the Vienna Festival, place primary
 emphasis upon the colonial issue, WFDY's official journal
 World Youth (No. 7, August 1958, in its lead article 'East is
 East and West is West") states:
 The world has changed considerably since Kipling
 cynically wrote:  'East is East and West is West,
 never the twain shall meet.''' It was, of cour$e, im-
 possible for the twain to meet in friendship when col-
 onialism came to the East as master - not friend.
 However, it was and still is wrong to think that this
 West would always be master and the East wo'pald eter-
 nally remain slave.  Also, the barrier between the two
 people could not continue forever . . . The Youth Festi-
 vals are now one of the best accepted forums for youth
 from all countries to sing, dance, play and meet each
 other in an atmosphere of cordiality - a place', where
 thousands of young people from all over the world
 gather together.  East and West meet here - if not in
 the geographical sense, in the spirit of it.  It is the
 duty of all of us to see that they meet this time in
 Vienna - at the Seventh Festival being held there in
 1959 - in an atmosphere which would surpass all
 previous meetings of this kind.  Youth dreams of a
 situation where it will not be East remaining east
 and West as west but the 'twain' meeting in a friendly
 embrace with joy and love - with no shadow of, gurgp,
 and slavery. " (Underlining added).
 135.  Inextricably interwoven with the cause of
 colonialism will be, as in the past, the playing up of racial
 intolerance in the West, particularly in the United States.
 It is hardly likely that mention will be made by the Cammu-
 nists of the recent US Supreme Court decisions ordering de-
 segregation but it can be expected that the Festival p11ogram-
 mers will make every effort by word, print and picture to

 emphasize the unpleasant incidents surrounding attempts to
 integrate the schools in some parts of the United States. The
 recent and unusual race riots in London will probably like-
 wise be featured.
 (2)     Campaign against The:;"Atomic Menace, " for "Secur-
 ity. as rmarae~Aa,and Peace''
 136.  The "peace" line in, Vienna, probably re-
 garded by the Festival sponsors as especially appropriate
 for world meeting in neutral Austria, willlbe a continuation
 and perhaps an intensification - of the type of peace propaganda
 seen in Moscow.. The WFDY Congress' number one resolution
 indicated the nature of the peace motif:  "The basis for cooper-
 ation can be agreement between all youth organizations for
 joint action for the immediate cessation of tests and for -Pro-
 hibition of thermonuclear weapons. "  Although attacks on the
 United States. and other Western powers and on such treaty
 organizations as NATO and the Baghdad Pact may be toned
 down because of the general Communist intent of creating a
 friendly, urbane impression in Vienna, the peace propaganda
 will probably include at least oblique references to the need
 for eliminating Western air and missile bases, the elimina-
 tion of the "`aggres.sive" treaty organizations and the with-
 drawal of foreign troops.
 (3)     To "Disseminate Culture'' Among Youth
 137.  A propaganda aim more clearly defined
 than at the Moscow Festival is to promote seminars, study-
 groups and exchange programs in and for all countries, for
 the ostensible purpose of improving the culture of youth.  At
 the Vienna Festival, the WFDY and IUS, according to the
 directives of their Congresses, will presumably initiate a
 large amount of organizational work looking toward (a) "ex-
 change of delegations and experience between cultural
 -75-

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001000220001-5
 organizations of youth of various countries, and bilateral
 agreements for international tours of artists, for exchanging
 scholarships to academies, institutes, art centers, "and
 (b) "international contests in creative endeavor and perform-
 ance, in various fields of art and culture. " This stepped-up
 ,cultural campaign represents the more sophisticated approach
 of the Communist youth front organizations in appealing to
 students and other youth with cultural interests.  The ideo-
 logical and political purposes are basically the same, as in
 the more forthright propaganda appeals, but they arel clothed
 in academic and artistic garb in order to make them appear
 to be impartial, non-political, and humanistic.  (Throughout
 the current appeals of the WFDY and IUS the "spirit of
 humanism" is emphasized as underlying the purposes of
 their programs).
 138.  Thus it becomes quite apparent that, al-
 though in Vienna the Communists may encounter more oppos-
 ition than they did in their Moscow Festiva,, they will',work
 unremittingly for essentially the same propaganda purposes.
 If anything, they will drive harder and more trencha*tly,
 combining direct attack with more subtle approaches to
 achieve success.
 VI.    SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
 A.  Success of Festival from Soviet Point of 'View
 139.  In sheer number of participants and in the
 amount of world attention accorded it, the Sixth World Festi-
 val of Youth and Students was probably all that the Commu-
 nist sponsors expected it to be, although they were probably
 disappointed that they did not get more mandated delegates
 from Free World youth organizations and from some, of the
 African and Asian nations.  As the largest international meet-

 ing of any kind ever held within the Communist Bloc it called
 for the heaviest expenditure of effort and money ever devoted
 by the Soviet Union to a mass gathering.
 140.  The extent to which the Soviet leadership
 really felt that its. large ii*estment paid adequate returns is
 a matter of conjecture.  The fact, however, that the Commu-
 nist Youth leaders are going full speed ahead with plans for
 the next Festival in. 1959 would indicate that on the whole they
 were satisfied with the results of the 1957, event.  Officially,
 leading Party spokesmen such as Khrushchev, Shelepin and
 Voroshilov have proclaimed the Moscow event an unparalleled
 success.  N. Mikhailov, Minister of Culture of the USSR,
 stated that there was "no doubt that Sixth. World Festival of
 Youth and' Students was one of the greatest events of our time,
 and that among other favorable results it had proved to be a.
 fruitful recruiting and training ground for young. "propagand-
 ists and organizers.. "   Somewhat more specifically, V.I.
 Popov, First Deputy Chairman of the Committee of Youth
 Organizations of the USSR, in a public lecture. at. the Poly-

 a.  Moscow was spotlighted as the center of
 the world peace movement;
 b.  The freedom given foreigners, including
 Americans, of all shades of political opinion was proof
 of the liberality of the Soviet regime;

 the Peking regime,

 e.  The Festival demonstrated that "there is
 no need to fear Communism. "
 141.  The real propaganda aims of the Festival
 were readily determinable prior to the event.  The happen-
 ings at the Festival and their aftermath have confirmed the
 nature of those aims.  In a balance of the gains and lasses
 for the USSR in attempting to achieve its four major p,ropa-
 ganda goals, the following conclusions are reached:
 a.  The Festival was instrumental in 'convey-
 ing to many of the delegates and onlookers in Moscow,
 and to some extent to the outside world, an impression
 of a new political and cultural liberality on the' part of
 the Soviet Union.
 b.  The show of more tolerance than would
 have been imaginable in the past, and its implication
 of confident strength on the part of the Soviet regime,
 also helped partially to restore Soviet prestige, among
 the youth of the Communist world and thus to aid in
 stabilizing the International Communist mover', ent.
 While the reverberations of the Hungarian uprising
 were not entirely stilled, they were effectively damp-
 ened by the Festival.  Youth from the satelli.tel, coun-
 tries - except for the Poles - were generally passive
 and obedient, although there were some grum lings
 that Bloc youth was discriminated against in favor of
 delegates from uncommitted areas.  Polish question-
 ing and dissent, while a striking feature of the' Festival,
 was kept within the tolerable bounds of ideological
 family differences.
 c.  The propaganda aim of enlisting foreign youth
 and youth organizations on behalf of Soviet foreign
 policy objectives was achieved only in part.  The trans-
 parent and often heavy-handed attempts to obtain mass

 youth support at obviously Communist dominated
 "peace" rallies, and the constant dinning of the "Peace
 and Friendship" theme tended to repel rather than to
 attract the non-Communists..  They also appear to have
 bored large ntynzbers of the faithfulparty-line followers.
 The Hiroshima Day anti.-nuclear-weapons rally (a fix-
 ture at youth festivals) may have made some impres-
 sion on newcomers. but according to foreign observers
 did not evoke the fervent response hoped for by the
 sponsors.
 d.  The second Soviet foreign propaganda
 objective, the extension of Soviet influence in the Afro-
 Asian and Latin American areas, appears to have met
 with considerable, but by no means uniform, success.
 The Afro-Asians as a whole responded favorably to the
 welcome accorded them in Moscow and to Soviet blan-
 dishments, but there were several' instances of dis-
 content and criticism.  Furthermore, the Communist
 organizers must have felt a sense of frustration that
 so many of the                      of the A sian "dele-
 African and . some o
 gates'I had to be co-opted from among students resident
 abroad rather than being genuinely mandated represen-
 tatives of the youth of their countries.  The walkout of
 the Ghana delegation was symptomatic of the fact that
 not all black Africans were taken in by the studied
 flattery.  Furthermore some of the Arab delegations,
 notably the Egyptian and the Syrian, embarrassed their
 hosts by exaggerated nationalistic behavior in an environ-
 ment primarily intended to idealize a world "brotherhood"
 f youth.  The adulation shown the ',Israeli delegates, Com-
 munist and non-Communist alike, by the Jewish community
 of Moscow was also embarrassing to the Soviet hosts. The
 regime's sharp discrimination against the young Israelis
 (because of the need to curry favor with the Arabs) served
 perhaps more strikingly than any other aspect of the Festi-
 val to cast doubt on Moscow's claim to impartiality in its

 treatment of all participants from abroad.  In fact
 these incidents show that the Communists do not always
 possess the unerring foresight often attributed to them
 in organizing their propaganda shows, for if they had,
 they would have taken steps to prevent such embarrass-
 ments.
 e.  The domestic propaganda intent of the
 Soviet leadership to utilize the Festival as a means of
 bolstering the morale and curbing the dissent of Soviet
 youth appears to have resulted in at least as many neg-
 ative as positive results.  The gala events no doubt
 evoked sentiments of national pride and patriotism
 among the young Soviet participants and on-lookers.
 This tonic effect, however, was probably more than
 offset by the exposure to forbidden "bourgeois's ideas
 and beliefs expressed by scores of visiting non-
 Communists, by the evidences of apathy among many
 of the satellite youth, and by the near-heresy of their
 young Polish comrades.
 142.  One of the greatest Soviet gains from the
 Festival's Afro-Asian program was the stimulus it gave to
 new organizing. efforts in that area on the part of the WFDY
 and IUS affiliates.  Their cooperation with the Afro-Asian
 Solidarity Conference in Cairo at the end of 1957, them assist-
 ance in implementing its decisions and their setting in',motion
 of other meetings and activities among African youth demon-
 strated vividly the tactic of following up the Festival w,i~th sup-
 porting operations.
 143.  The Latin American delegates were predom-
 inantly seasoned young Communists or fellow- travele ris but a
 few dissenters were present, making themselves heard, if not
 at the gathering itself, then Immediately after their return
 home.  No significant regional youth conferences followed the

 Festival but there is strong evidence that Communist organi-
 zation and infiltration efforts among the students of Latin
 America were intensified and that they have played an effec-
 tive role in the wave of recent student demonstrations in Argen-
 tina, Uruguay and Panama.
 B.  Lessons: for the Free World Bearing on the Next
 Festival
 144.  The Moscow Festival offered convincing
 proof of the USSR's continued mastery of publicity and man-
 agement.:techniques applied to mass political activity.  To
 attract and to monitor approximately 35, 000 young people
 from more than 130 countries at a time when the Soviet pres-
 tige among vior7ld youth was at. its lowest ebb since the signing
 of the Nazi-Soviet pact and. the Soviet invasion of Poland, was
 no small accomplishment.  It demonstrated in other respects,
 however, that the CPSU is not infallible and that its propaganda
 is not always as effective as. it probably likes to believe or as
 the Free World tends to fear.
 145.  The Moscow Festival conclusively pointed
 to the need for greater perceptiveness on the part of Free
 World countries, East and West, of the true aims and objec-
 tives of the international youth festivals, and for the develop-
 ment of a common attitude and carefully planned counterac-
 tions if the Communists are to be prevented from utilizing
 such occasions to score repeated political propaganda suc-
 cesses..  The deadly .serious purposes of these gatherings
 held in an atmosphere of combined carnival. gav#ty, c-i lttt..ral
 enlightenment and simulated peace and friendship, must be
 more fully recognized and. publicized, particularly in coun-
 tries where a considerable part of the youth may be naively
 impressed with the specious idealism of the Festival's aims.

 146.  The experience of the Moscow Festival and
 the evidence concerning the nature and aims of the 1959 gather-
 ing point to a number of considerations which should be taken
 into account in the formulation by Free World countries of
 sound policy and effective action against the Vienna. Festival:
 a.  Since all previous festivals have' result-
 ed in net propaganda gains for the Communists and
 since the specific propaganda aims of the forthcoming
 Seventh Festival are readily discernible, it would be
 better for the Free World if the event could be'~ pre-
 vented altogether, or at least if the Communists could
 be denied the advantages of holding it in a Free World
 country.  Since, however, it does not at this time ap-
 pear likely that either of these desiderata will be real-
 ized, the Free World must proceed on the assumption
 that the next Festival will be held as planned iii Vienna
 and determine what kind of measures will be most
 effective against it.  The fact that this will be the first
 youth festival ever held in a Free World locale, while
 offering some propaganda advantages to the Commu-
 nists, will also open up unparalleled opportunities for
 exploiting Communist vulnerabilities.
 b.  Whatever measures are devised ':by Free
 World countries must be designed to steer between two
 extremes, either of which would redound to the benefit
 of the Communists:  The first would be to take', action.
 which, instead of deflating or debunking the Festival,
 would tend on the contrary to play up or build up the
 event.  Such actions would include encouragenl.ent of
 Free World youth and student organizations to ,send
 official, mandated representatives to Vienna.  Any
 attempt to organize large scale caaT. ter-attrac'-ions
 a "competing" youth festival in effect - would only add
 luster to the Communist-sponsored gathering.   To the
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RPP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 delegates, and the spectators, prominent events intend-
 ed to serve as counter=attractions might well be indis-
 tinguishable from the planned Communist program and
 would serve to add to the entertainment and glamor of
 the occasion, thereby benefitting the Communists. The
 featuring of noted Free World singers, actors and other
 artists, of large shows and musical productions, or of
 prominent athletes. and sports teams, would all probably
 be welcome grist for the Communist mill.  On the other
 hand, militant counter-demonstrations or any forceful
 attempts to "take over" the Festival also would proba-
 bly boomerang against the Free World, giving the Com-
 munists the basis for a propaganda claim that hooligan
 "reactionaries" were disrupting a peaceful, friendly,
 non-political gathering of youth.  T'he other extreme
 to be avoided by the Free World is Ito do nothing or to
 take measures so relatively weak and ineffective that
 the Communists could laugh them off.
 c.  Thus it would appear to be a wise course
 of action for Free World countries to urge an organiza-
 tional boycott of the Seventh Festival by youth and stu-
 dent groups whose presence in Vienna would add pres-
 tige to the occasion.  On the other hand, the experience
 of the Moscow Festival indicates that it would also be
 the better part of wisdom not to prohibit or discourage
 "unofficial, " voluntary attendance at the Festival by
 well-motivated, politically sophisticated, articulate
 young people who could ably express the points of view
 of the Free World in the discussiot.s on international
 political issues which will inevitably be raised by the
 Communists at the Festival.  The Moscow Festival
 demonstrated the effectiveness of such person-to-person
 debates and contacts.  The personal meetings proved to
 be an effective means of "reaching" the Communist Bloc
 youth.  It is much more difficult to impede individual
 conversations during a large and "open" gathering than
 to jam radio broadcasts or censor ,readin.g matter.  In
 Vienna it should be even more difficult for the Commu-
 nists to control such contacts than, it was in Moscow.

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 d.  The need for well-grounded, politically aware
 Free World youth will be even greater in Vienna than
 in Moscow.  The reduction by about 50% in the total
 number of delegates will, according to announced Festi-
 val plans, fall most heavily on the Bloc delegations,
 This means that the Soviet Bloc representatives will be
 a smaller, tighter, more cohesive group than in Moscow
 and will undoubtedly be selected from among the best-
 indoctrinated and the most reliable young activists in
 the entire Communist orbit.  Thus it will require great-
 er skill and better preparation on the part of the non-
 Communists to cope with them.                                         It should be remembered
 that the delegations from the Afro-Asian and L.tin Amer-
 ican countries, even if not preponderantly pro-Communist,
 will contain a sizeable proportion of youth with biases of
 anti-imperialism, neutralism and militant nationalism.
 Hence, it is important that not only Western nations but
 the uncommitted countries make every effort to! assure
 that of those who do go to the Festival, as large a pro-
 portion as possible are aware of the Communist aims,
 organization and modus operandi,  and are ready and
 willing to expose and counter them. It should be re-
 membered, also, that the effect of reasoned counter-
 statements by non-Communists at the Festival will be
 felt not merely by the participants but by the youth and
 general citizenry back in their own countries.  Broad-
 scale international newspaper and radio coverage will
 undoubtedly be given to the Vienna festival.
 e.  The Moscow Festival also demonstrated that
 the presence of qualified Free World individuals could
 be effective not only in the informal contacts but in the
 important and pre-planned vocational, professional and
 regional get-togethers and in the interdelegatiomeet-
 ings.                               There was little advance planning for the'Free
 World participation in such meetings in Moscow!, and
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RQP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 a number of opportunities for effective counter-
 activity were probably lost.  Nevertheless, the spon-
 taneou,s expression of dissenting views by individuals
 from Free World countries was apparently so disturb-
 ing to the Communists - especially in the cases of the
 Philosophy and Economic seminars' - that the planners
 for the Seventh Festival have eliminated all sessions of
 this type.  As indicated above, the preparatory commis-
 sion for the Seventh Festival has reduced the total num-
 ber of seminars and intends to limit them to seemingly
 innocuous subjects which, of course, still have their
 political purposes.  The other types of get-togethers,
 however, remain essentially the same as those held in
 Moscow.
 -f.  For these reasons, it would appear that the mis-
 sionary value to the Free World in permitting politically-
 conscious youth to attend the next Festival would out-
 weigh the limited propaganda advantages the Communists
 might gain by claiming that their presence is proof of
 Free World approval of the Festival.  At the same time,
 every effort should be made by Free World countries,
 particularly those of underdeveloped areas, to limit the
 attendance of impressionable and susceptible participants
 who , by swelling the numbers of their delegations, would
 add to claims of Communist success in their ability to
 appeal to the youth of the world.
 116.  In addition to measures designed to. assure that
 Free World youth who do attend are knowledgeable and compe-
 tent, other counter-activities in Vienna could include:  (a) book
 exhibits and giveaway programs, featuring paper-back editions
 of books which have been proscribed by the Communist author-
 ities in their own countries (e. g. Pasternak's Dr. Zhive.go and
 Dj.las?'s The New Class) and free copies of! magazines of special
 interest to youth and students; insofar as time and expense would

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915R001000220001-5
 permit, the book giveaways should be translated into the more
 important Bloc languages; they should also be made available
 to youth of the underdeveloped areas in languages known to
 them; (b) film showings, especially pictures not normally per-
 mitted behind the Iron Curtain; (c) concerts, particularly of
 the smaller chamber-music and  "jazz-combo' type, in con-
 siderable numbers at various locations in and around the Festi-
 val, making sure that they are identified not as part of the
 Festival program but as a contribution from Free World youth;
 likewise in as large numbers as possible, Western recordings
 to be provided in listening booths and some also to be given as
 gifts or sold at a very low price (in Moscow these were avidly
 sought by Bloc youth and commanded large prices on the black
 market);  (d) organization of "Kaffeeklatsch" meetings in the
 Vienna cafes, open to all Festival delegates but again'Iclearly
 earmarked as Free World youth's contribution.
 117.  Such efforts would have the distinct !advan-
 tage of appealing to youth both from the Bloc and from the
 remoter parts of the Free World without being either !,exces-
 sively expensive or creating too much of a publicity bviilt-up
 for the Festival.   They would represent the kind of subdued
 but effective measures which could help to offset the massive
 Communist propaganda efforts at the Festival and to exemplify
 the Free World's interest in honestly informing and trying to
 help the youth and students of the world.  Insofar as possible
 these should be undertaken on a private basis, enlisting the
 aid and the contributions of business firms, foundations and
 other organizations in order both to avoid any implication of
 governmental participation and to demonstrate to world opin-
 ion the willingness of voluntary groups not directly involved in
 the cold war to help thwart the hugs Communist propaganda
 effort.
 118.  In summary, any policy and measures of the
 Free World countries in relation to the Seventh Festival should
 be governed by the following aims:

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 (1) They should serve to counteract or neutralize
 the propaganda impact which the Communists hope to
 achieve through the Festival.  In so doing they should
 avoid playing up And adding prestige to the Festival.
 (2)  They should exploit to the maximum the vul-
 nerabilities inherent in the location of the Festival in
 a Free World city and should utilize the Festival's
 platforms and meetings to propagate positive Free
 World values, principles and ideas; rather than nega-
 tive anti-Communist themes.
 (3)  They should serve to discredit the Communist
 leadership of the Festival and of the two international
 youth, front organizations which are its immediate spon-
 sors.  The experience of the Moscow Festival indicates
 that effective Free World counteraction at Vienna is
 feasible provided imaginative planning and energetic
 effort are developed well in advance.

 APPENDIX
 MOST FREQUENT QUESTIONS ASKED THE AMERICAN
 PARTICIPANTS IN MOSCOW, AND TYPICAL AN?WERS
 The questions asked the American participant's on the
 streets, in the parks and at the various meetings, whether
 challenging, inimical, or relatively friendly, gradually fell
 into a repetitive pattern.  It is believed that these questions
 and the kinds of answers given them by the Americana are of
 sufficient general interest to merit repeating as composites
 of the current thinking, state of knowledge and curiosity of
 the young Soviet questioners.  Some of these questions will be
 recognized immediately as typically provocative Communist
 propaganda queries, usually asked by a party activist assigned
 to the task.  Others, parroting the party line, may have been
 asked innocently by young Russians who knew no better or who
 sincerely wanted an answer to what had been taught them for
 years.  The answers were not always as clear-cut or' as suc-
 cinct as they are put down here.  Some of the less sophisticated
 Americans simply did not know the right answers.  The answers
 cited are essentially and "typically" those given on several occa-
 sions and at various places.  The Americans at the Festival had
 not in any planned way anticipated the questions or worked out
 any standard replies.  Yet among the best of them there grew
 out of their separate experiences a remarkable unanimity about
 what to say and how to say it.
 Q - Will you be punished by your Government for coming to
 the Festival?
 A - No.  Our Government did not want us to come in View of
 the Soviet actions against youth and students in Hungary.
 But since we chose to come on our own, we will not be
 punished in any way.

 Q - When did you learn to speak Russian?.
 A - At the university.  (Some learned Russian at home).
 - How do you like Moscow?  How does. it compare with New
 York?
 A   We enjoy being in Moscow. It is difficult to compare it
 with New York which has a much larger population and
 which has its unique individuality even among American
 cities.  (Some of the Americans had brought picture
 postcards of New York and other American. views which
 they would pass out among the audience).
 Economic Questions
 Q - How much does an unskilled worker earn?
 A   That. depends upon the type of work and the strength of his
 union.  There is a minimum wage law in the United
 States. On the :average an unskilled worker would earn
 $50-$75 per week (astonishment when the listeners trans-
 lated this into, rubles).
 Do the workers have real unions?
 A - Yes, indeed.  Some of the unions are very powerful and
 have succeeded time and time again,.in getting higher
 wages and shorter hours for the workers.
 Q - How much does a skilled worker earn?  An engineer?
 A - Again, that depends on the type of work, the strength of
 the union. and demand.  In general a skilled. worker
 gets about $80-$100 per week.  Engineers are very
 much in demand and are paid an entrance salary of

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915F001000220001-5
 $5, 000-$6, 000 per year when they are just out' of col-
 lege.  From there on they range to $10, 000-$1'115, 000
 and more, depending on type of engineering, and the
 individual ability of the engineer.
 Q - How much does a teacher earn?
 A   This depends on the individual states and communities.
 In the USA there is no uniform national system of pub-
 lic schools but each locality determines its own pro-
 gram, teachers' salaries and curricula.  Most Amer-
 icans feel. that their teachers are still relatively under-
 paid.                               At present the average for the country is probably
 in the neighborhood of $3, 000-$5, 000 for elementary
 teachers and about $5, 000-$8, 000 for high school teach-
 ers.  Other questions in the pay-and-price field which
 received varying answers from the Americans were:
 How much does a meal in a restaurant cost?
 How much does a week of meals cost?
 How much do you pay for living accommodations?
 What proportion of a person's earnings go for! an
 apartment?
 Do most people live in apartments?
 How much does a television set cost?
 How many people are unemployed in the United States?
 Does a person get paid for his days off?
 Does he get paid more for overtime work?
 How much does an automobile cost?
 How much is a pair of shoes?
 (One of the American interlocutors, well-versed in American
 consumer economics, bewildered his audience of Soviet stu-
 dents and workers when he told them the average monthly pay
 of an industrial worker in the United States would be', enough
 to buy about 10 suits of clothes or 47 pairs of shoes.: Mem-

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 bers of the Soviet group admitted that the average Russian
 industrial worker has to work about two to three months to
 buy one mediocre suit and could buy no more than 5 or 6 pairs
 of shoes with one month's pay).
 Political Questions
 Q - Why is the United States against elimination of nuclear
 testing and disarmament?
 A - We do not and cannot represent the US ',Government in any
 way so we cannot,speak for the official policy of our
 country.  But it is our impression that the United States
 does want nuclear disarmament, including an end to
 nuclear to sting, and the establishment of an effective
 inspection system.  But this action cannot be unilateral.
 There has to be agreement on many, matters involving
 world disarmament.  You must know and believe that
 the American people and our Governament genuinely
 want world peace and have proved it by their actions
 in the past.
 Q - If you really mean that you do not want war with us, why
 do you maintain a ring of air bases all around the Soviet
 Union?  Why don't you take your troops. out of Europe?
 A   The US maintains its bases only because of the constantly
 menacing attitude of your Government.  You have elim-
 inated Latvia, Esthonia and Lithuania as independent
 states; you have maintained troops in Poland, Czecho-
 slovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria since the war.  You
 tried to blockade Berlin.  You instigated the Korean
 war and your leaders still want to communize the world.
 This is why the United States and the rest of the Free
 World regard the Soviet Union with apprehension and
 why we maintain a defensive perimeter around you.

 Q - If America is not really imperialist what does she want?
 A - The United States wants a peaceful and free world.  By
 peace we mean a state of affairs in which no country
 wants to conquer or dominate another, or generally to
 use force to settle international disputes.  By',, "free"
 we mean that every country should decide for itself by
 free voting the kind of government it wants.  You do
 not permit the Eastern European countries under Sov-
 iet control to decide for themselves the political and
 social system they want but impose upon them] a Soviet
 Communist regime.
 Q - Is there any ideological difference between your two major
 parties in the United States?
 A - As you think of ideology as meaning a set of "class" ideas
 and purposes opposed to those of another clas',s, no.
 The Republicans and the Democrats are both committed
 to the idea of democracy within a republic.  They both
 have moderately "left" and "right" elements.  But on
 important national and international issues they offer
 strong opposition, one to the other.  The absence of
 bitter class struggle between the two is what provides
 the relative peace and stability of American politics.
 If, in recent years, there has been a basic ph ilosoph-
 ical difference between them it is that the Republicans
 are somewhat more in favor of allowing as much lee-
 way as possible to free enterprise while the Democrats
 are more' inclined to advocate governmental regulation
 or control of the economy.  (Several variations of this
 answer were given by various young Americas who
 were asked the same question but the one cited above
 appears to be the most typical).

 The case went all the way to the Supreme Court before
 the final decision.  (Two or three American speakers
 who had learned to anticipate this question compared
 the Rosenberg's trial with the purge trials in the Soviet
 Union and with the more recent execution of Lavrenti
 Beria.  Apparently this comparison helped carry con-
 viction with the Soviet audiences who seemed to be im-
 pressed).
 Q - Why don't you permit people from the Soviet Union to
 travel in the United States?
 A - Who says we don't permit them?  We have delegations
 from the USSR coming all the time, such as agricul-
 tural workers, technicians, cultural groups.  The rea-
 son that more don't come is that your government won't
 let them.
 Q - Isn't that because you insist on fingerprinting our visitors?
 A - That is probably an excuse.  It is true' that we require
 fingerprinting but it is also true that once in the coun-
 try the Soviet visitor, like any other, can go anywhere
 he pleases without constantly showing, or turning over,
 his passport at hotels or reporting to the police.  Fur-
 thermore, we have no internal passports as you do here.
 (This answer was given before the fingerprinting require-
 ment was eliminated by the US Government).
 Q o In general, what do the American people think of the Soviet
 Union?
 A - This, of course, is the most difficult kind of question to
 answer.  It is not possible for any one of us to speak

 for 170 million of our countrymen.  There are many
 different views and feelings among so vast a popula-
 tion and there are undoubtedly large numbers of people
 who are so preoccupied with the daily business ofmak-
 ing a living that they don't give much thought to the
 problems of world politics.  But if one could generalize
 about the opinions of the more interested and aware
 Americans who follow world events, their views might
 be expressed as follows:  First, there is a tremendous
 reservoir of good will for the Soviet people.  Thee has
 never been a serious conflict between Russians and Amer-
 icans; historically we have been friends, not enemies,
 although we have never known enough about each other.
 The heroism and sacrifices of the Soviet people during
 World War\II are still fresh in American memories.
 Second, there is a tremendous desire to live in a friend-
 ly and peaceable way with the Soviet Union.  The enthusi-
 asm and cordiality shown the few visiting groups you have
 sent should be proof of that.  It is a positive kind of friend-
 liness, not mere courtesy or formal politeness.  The vast
 majority of Americans would cheer if there could be sin-
 cere genuine collaboration between our countries, not only
 to prevent the horrible mutual destruction of a nuclear war
 but to work together for the benefit of the rest of the world.
 Third - and this is the other side of the question they do
 not trust the motives and the aims of your Government,
 particularly in view of its role as being the "vanguard"
 of World Communism.  They wish your leaders could
 genuinely adopt a policy of "live and let live" instead of
 what seems to Americans a constant stirring up o~ trouble
 and a menacing attitude.  (This question and its a ewer
 would often be made up of several sub-questions and with
 respect to particular aspects of US-Soviet relations).

 Questions on Hungary
 Q - Why hasn't the United States been willing. to accept the
 Soviet Union's policy of international conciliation?
 A - Because, frankly, it does not believe that it is a true
 policy of conciliation.  For instance, the Soviet policy
 toward Hungary was hardly conciliatory, even though
 Mikoyan promised Imre Nagy that it would be so.
 Q - What do you mean?
 A - Do you mean to say you know nothing of Mikoyan's visit
 to Nagy during the Hungarian uprising?  (Murmurs
 from crowd:   No, tell us about it. 11)
 Q    Well, what is your version of how the uprising began?
 A - It was the same way as in the Soviet Union when Dudintsev
 andother writers began to protest against ideological
 restrictions. I&Hungary the writers of the Petbfi Club
 called a meeting to demand freedom for writers.  They
 were joined by students and were supported by the indus-
 trial workers who chose the occasion to protest their
 miserable living conditions.  What was at first a mild
 protest blossomed into a real revolution.
 Q - Why did the counter-revolutionaries join them?
 A - There were no counter-revolutionaries in the sense that
 you use that term.  The only counterrevolutionaries
 in the true sense were the AVH (secret police).  The
 students, workers and other people were unarmed.
 They marched to the broadcasting studio unarmed.
 Not a shot was fired at first.  Not even the Soviet
 soldiers fired.  Later many of the Soviet troops gave
 their arms to the people after the AVH started firing
 on the crowd.    Did you know that?  (Apparently the
 crowd did not).

 Q - If this demonstration was spontaneous, how is it that they
 marched with such deliberate intent to storm thel radio
 station?
 A - Do you know who taught them'-to march on the radio 'sta-
 tion?  You did.  You compelled them to read Lenin and
 to learn Communist revolutionary tactics.  The actions
 of the Hungarian insurgents were right out of Lenin's
 "What Is To Be Done" and "A Tale and Revolution. "
 Q - Didn't the Hungarians obtain arms from the Americans?
 The Americans sent balloons ostensibly with medical
 supplies but these really were used to parachut' guns.
 A - That's a lie.
 Q - Didn't the Hungarian government request Soviet armed
 assistance?
 A - This is the truth of the matter-  When the Soviet Govern-'
 ment saw that it was losing control of Hungary it sent
 Mikoyan with proposals to Nagy for a compromise sim-
 ilar to that reached in Poland.                                An agreement was signed
 with Nagy, officially recognizing the Nagy government as
 legal.  After Mikoyan left, the Soviet government be-
 trayed its agreement and ordered fresh Soviet troops
 into Hungary to replace the less reliable troops on duty
 there.  Nagy fled to the Yugoslav Embassy in $t}dapest.
 Kadar was installed in his place and the Soviet army
 proceeded to drown the Hungarian uprising in blood.
 Nagy was lured out of the Yugoslav Embassy by prom-
 ises of immunity and was then seized by the Soviet
 secret police.  This is the way the Hungarian revolution
 was suppressed and the way in which Nagy was betrayed.
 (After this statement, there was an extended back-and-
 forth discussion but no especially new points were made

 by either side.  The Soviet listeners appeared quite
 amazed at the speaker's. recital of the facts about Hun-
 gary
 Social Questions
 Q - Why do you discriminate against negroes in the United
 States?
 A - It.is true that there still is discrimination against negroes
 in some parts of the United States; but, for the country
 as a whole, great strides have been made in lessening
 discrimination and in some places and occupations it
 has disappeared entirely.  The Supreme Court of the
 United States has repeatedly reaffirmed the basic, equal
 rights of negroes, notably in its recent decisions calling
 for an end to sega gation in the schools.  (Some of the
 American speakers took advantage of this question to
 raise the issue of anti-semitism in the Soviet Union.
 Most of the Soviet listeners denied that there was any
 discrimination against Jews but some tacitly admitted
 that there was, "at least. in Stalin's day. H
 Q - How can: you have so much class discrimination in the
 United States and claim to be a democracy?
 A - We have relatively little "class" discrimination in the US,
 perhaps less than anywhere else in the world, includ-
 ing the USSR.  In fact, we don't tend to think in terms
 of "classes." Economically the spread between the
 bottom and the top people is constantly narrowing and
 we have a great majority of middle-income people.
 What you would call our "working" class is generally
 enjoying a comfortable "middle-class''' way of life.
 You in the Soviet Union, on the other hand, have been
 developing more and more of class differentiation.

 (The class question, asked many times in various
 forms, gave several of the more knowledgeable Amer-
 icans an opportunity to "take off" on the relative class-
 structure of the USSR and the USA, much to the enlight-
 enment and surprise of the listeners).
 Q - Can a poor youngster get a university education?
 A - He certainly can.  We have many virtually free state
 universities and our big, rich private universities are
 heavily endowed so that they offer many free scholar-
 ships to able and deserving persons no matter how poor.
 (Some Americans turned the question to ask how and by
 what criteria university students are selected in Russia).
 Q - How much is the scholarship or "stipend" of a university
 student?
 A - (Answers varied, according to the college experience of
 the speaker).
 Cultural Questions
 Q - Do Americans read Russian literature?  How about Soviet
 authors ?
 A - Of course, as part of the world's great literature:  Tolstoy,
 Dostoyevsky, Turgenev, Pushkin, Gogol, Chekhov,
 Soviet authors are perhaps known to fewer people,' but
 Sholokhov's And Quiet Flows the Don is very popular,
 and among the well-known are Leonov, Gladko,v, Pan-
 ova and Zoshchenko.
 Q - Do you listen to Russian music?
 A - And how 1  Many of the most-played, best-known. pymphon
 ies , concertos, and other compositions, are',Russian

 such as those of Tschaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Glinka,
 Mussorgsky and Charkovsky.  Also, there are the
 works of Soviet composers such as', Prokofiev and
 Khatchaturian.
 Q - Why didn't you bring an American jazz band?
 A - Because we came as individuals.      We could not "bring"
 orchestras or bands with us. Do you like American
 jazz.?
 Answers from the listeners - We certainly do, and rggard it
 .as the "original" jazz..  We know Armstrong, Elling-
 ton, Benny Goodman, Stan. Kenton.  We listen to your
 jazz over the Voice of America.  We now are getting
 a lot of "'rock and roll." (A young American college
 instructor was approached one evening on the streets
 of Moscow by a friendly group of young Russian. stil-
 yagi - "zoot- suite r s" or "he.pcats'"- and asked if the
 American jazz. band leader, "Dizzy" Gillespie, was
 coming to Moscow.  When the American said he didn't
 know the name the Russian youths were amazed at his
 ignorance, and began to suspect that he wasn't an
 American after all!
 The Russian listeners did not.seem to know much, if anything,
 about more serious American music.
 Questions on CPUSA
 Q - Why do you persecute the Communist Party in the United
 States ?
 A - Who says we persecute it?

 Sanitized - Approved For Release : CIA-RDP78-00915RO01000220001-5
 Q - Well, why did they arrest the leaders of the Party?
 A - The leaders were convicted of conspiracy to overgrow
 our form of government.  Still, under our Constitution
 the Communists had the right to appeal, which they
 exercised.  The Supreme Court, ever zealous to pro-
 tect fundamental constitutional liberties, reversed the
 lower courts and ruled in favor of the defendants.
 Q - Then why did they remain in prison so long?
 A - They stayed in prison only long enough for the appals
 process to be followed.  Even when they were in jail
 they continued to write articles, and the Party jcon-
 tinued to exist.  Didn't you receive the Daily Worker
 for all that period of time?  The Communist press
 continued to function and Dennis even completed a book
 while in prison.
 Q - Is the Communist Party popular in the United States?
 A - No, hardly anyone pays attention to it.  Why should they?
 The Communists raise false issues, alter the facts to
 suit themselves, and talk a language largely incom-
 prehensible to the American public, particularly to
 the workers. to whom they try to address themselves.
 They talk about mass unemployment when there isn't
 any, or when unemployment is relatively small. They
 try to worsen race relations when the Government and
 the mass of the people are trying hard to find peace-
 able and evolutionary solutions to the problemsli of
 racial discrimination which we frankly admit still
 exist in some parts of our country..  They call the
 United States "imperialistic" when we all know from
 the simple facts. of the record that this is not so.  They
 try to persuade people that all parties but their own in

 the United States are creatures or puppets of Wall
 Street, which we all know is an antique and unfounded
 clichb .  They work to reduce the defenses of the
 United States in the name of "peaces" but which, by
 weakening our position, would only make war more
 likely.
 Q       What do you mean by saying that the Communist Party of
 the United States takes orders from Moscow?  It is an
 independent though "fraternal" party.
 A   It is, no secret to anyone that all Communist parties are
 subordinated to the CPSU Central. Committee in Mos-
 cow.  Don't take my word for it.  Read Lenin.  Read
 his speeches at the Eighth through the Eleventh Party
 Congresses.. It's all there.  He sets forth very clearly
 the lines of organization and subordination.  That is
 why there have been repeated schisms in the CPUSA
 and why there is a particularly bad break now. This
 is why even so ardent a ,Communist as Howard Fast
 left the Party, although in his case it was not merely
 his disgust with Moscow domination but his. revulsion
 against the growth of anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union.
 (Knowledgeable American speakers never lost an oppor-
 tunity to tell their Soviet listeners about Fast's defection
