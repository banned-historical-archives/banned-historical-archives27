 MEMO TO
 Re. Fifth Estate
 1.  The recent murder of Richard S. Welch, CIA station chief at Athens,
 Greece, has focussed attention on Fi.f&4 Estate, a radical group apparently
 working to sabotage various US intelligence operations.     Fifth Estate is
 ed with fingering Welch for assassination,wittingly or unwittingly, by
 char
 g
 listirg his name in the two latest issues of its quarterly publication, "Con-
 ter-Sp, on Page 50 of its Summer-Fall issue and on Page 26 of its Winter is-
 sue.                        (See copies of both issues attached and Fifth Estate explanation.)
 2.  Fifth Estate  bluntly states its primary current objectives as (1)
 "abolishment of the CIA" and (9) "support for CIA defectors", on Page 5 of
 the Summer-Fall issue of "enter-Spy".
 3.  Other Fifth Estate objectives, as ascertained from the above two
 and other issues of "Counter-Spy appear to be to hamper or destroy the ef-
 fectivnesss of the FBI and other US Intelligence and security agencies.
 4.  From a brief evaluation of available material and other evidence fran
 Fift Estate sources, inoludipg interviews with two of Its five principals
 Winslow Peck and Eda Gordon), it is apparent that Fifth Estate, and its spin-
 offs, not only are targeted to damage or destroy US security operations, but al-
 so that they are probably under Marxist control or operation.  In addition, it
 appears that the wholeh Estato setup has close ties with other leftist or
 radical groups, some of them, at least, Communist controlled or Infiltrated.

 liKE YOU
 The Intelligence Documentation Center (IDC), an independent re-
 search group on the intelligence community, is accepting appli-
 cations for five intern positions this Spring.   The session will
 be-in January 30 and terminate April 30.   If you are-interested
 in ~,aining research experience in a politically conscious environ-
 ment, the IDC program may be what you're looking for.
 To assist you in your decision, the following explanation of the
 IDC 1976 intern project has been prepared by five student interns
 who worked at IDC this past fall.  We think students should re-
 ceive school credit for the three-month project, but we expect
 you to initiate a credit agreement with you school or professor(s).
 Most students have found they can receive a full semester's credit
 for working full time at IDC.
 The program is designed to train young people in highly specialized
 areas of research methodology.   Sociology, history, political
 science, and economics are all areas in which you can expect to
 gain much knowledge from your work with IDC.

 THE
 INTELLIGENCE
 DOCUMENTATION
 CENTER
 IDC is a non-profits tax-exempt library and research group which was
 founded_   members of the Organizing Committee for a Fifth Estate.   IDC
 now functions as an independent organization.
 IDC was established as a direct result of people's growing concerns
 over government security agencies and their activities.   Recent rev-
 elations which have exposed illegal wiretapping, mail surveillance,
 and dossier files on thousands of American individuals have led many
 people to believe that such activities threaten the basic principles
 on which our country was built.   If these fundamental rights establish-
 ed in the Bill of Rights are indeed crumbling, IDC believes the public
 has the right to know.   We think our primary responsibility is to in-
 crease public awareness in this area, and  we believe the intern pro-
 gram is one way of accomplishing this goal.. We hope to build our IDC
 resource center, to be utilized by all, with the knowledge and exper-
 iences gained by students and staff during this program.
 We recently received a grant from a New York foundation to conduct a
 ear-long study o  tee  ects of re ression and surveillance on move-
 ments for social change in the U.S.   We have determined certain sec-
 tors of society which we think require special attention and we approach
 our research within a framework of class-analysis.  We are trying to
 determine what movements exist now or have existed in the past, what
 the goals and tactics are or were, and how or whether government and
 corporate efforts were made to suppress or coopt such movements.   This
 is the area in which interns will do most of their  research.   IDC
 hopes that, after we evaluate the effects of  such  activities, a book
 will be published combining much of the research.
 The five IDC staff members offer a wealth of experience, not only in
 research methods, but in government agencies as well.
 i,1 Ds.ow Peck worked in the National Security Agency for four years and
 has been actively researching the intelligence community for five years.
 Doug Porter has done extensive research in the areas of intelligence and
 right-wing terrorist organizations.
 Eda Gordon was Senior Editor for four years of  Trial magazine, published
 by the Association of American Trial Lawyers.   She was also an investi-
 gator for the Wounded Knee Offense/Defense Committee in South Dakota in
 1974-75.
 Tim Butz brings his experience in Viet Nam Veterans Against the War and
 the Winter Soldier Investigation to IDC.   lie was a military intelligence
 expert for the Wounded Knee Offense/Defense Committee.   He has done ex-

 tensive inquiries into the numerous Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT)
 teams around the country.
 Margaret Van Houten, who has a degree in Sociology from the, University
 of Buffalo, has researched the intelligence community for the past year
 in Washington.   She is presently coordinating a public education project
 on intelligence agencies which includes dozens of campus teach-in pro-
 grams around the country, at which the IDC staff members often speak.
 THE
 INTERN
 PROGRAM
 Although IDC is a research center on the intelligence arena, one of the
 most valuable experiences for the intern is participation in the collec-
 tive.   The IDC does not function as a hierarchy, which makes it necessary
 for all members to guide and help each other, yet develop self-direction
 and to maintain an honest and open attitude towards criticism and advice.
 The idea of a collective is that it functions as a unit;  we work together
 to combine all our skills into one.
 The following is a rough outline of the three-month spring schedule.  It
 is only an outline, because we want to invite input from the interns
 themselves.
 This is a two-week period in which everyone can adjust to one another and
 read the basic works on the intelligence community.   It's also a good time
 to arrange living situations for those who need them.   The first readings
 on the list will be discussed.  (See enclosed reading list.)
 The staff will present  seminars on the intelligence agencies and related
 topics such as Red Squads, investigative techniques or current events.
 Weekly visitor seminars will he presented by individuals studying differ-
 ent areas in different research organizations.  We have invited individuals
 who research such areas as the Middle East, Africa, and the JFK assassina-
 tion to come and explain their findings to us.   If interns show interest
 in any such areas, experts can be invited  to speak.
 Projects
 While the interns are familarizing themselves with the subject, they will
 be asked to choose a specific sector of society, on which to focus their
 attention.   In the time remaining, interns research their area using all
 types of  research methods.
 An intern, for example, focusing on labor would talk to authors of books on
 labor, trade union officials, labor supporters, and workers.   Books on the

 ,Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000200470001-4
 history of labor and labor unions would need review.   Periodicals publish-
 ed by both management and labor  as well as government would require
 examination.   One might even venture out into the factories or docks and
 talk to workers on the job.   There are many different angles and sources
 the intern must examine.
 Guidance from the staff, as well as mutual assistance from the other in-
 terns, builds the cooperative spirit we want to maintain.   These projects
 not only serve to enhance one's research techniques, but provide rare
 opportunities to meet people of varying backgrounds and political per-
 suasions.   At the same time, the intern program serves to train students
 in leadership skills.  You'll find it is a course  in assertiveness as
 well.
 TO
 APPLY
 FOR THE
 INTERNSHIP
 Send us a list of your job experience, travel, education (both formal
 and informal), and any organizations in which you have worked.  Out-
 lining those experiences which have influenced you the most, write us
 a letter tracing the evolution of your political thought.    Be sure to
 include an explanation of why you want to work at IDC, as well as your
 present academic status.
 SCHOLARSHIPS                                                  /"/            / r  ? <
 IDC offers scholarships for those who feel they need financial
 assistance during the program.   If you are interested in applying for
 this $600 fellowship simply explain your financial status in your letter
 to us.   Paid internships are rare and therefore, we feel it necessary to
 offer  a scholarship to those students who otherwise couldn't consider
 such programs in Washington DC.
 With careful budgeting, we have found that one can live in this relative -
 ly expensive city for aproximately $200-$275 a month.   The first month, if
 you need to find housing, is likely to cost more.
 Though not impossible to find, housing usually means a tedious and difficult
 search.   IDC staff will find a place for you to stay temporarily when you
 arrive and will assist you in finding permanent living quarters.
 If you can be partially financed during the program, tell us what you feel
 you need to supplement your income.   If you can get no financial assistance
 from your school or home, explain those circumstances too.

 Annual Repor
 This past year has witnessed great and sudden changes in world politics. Aside from the recent changes in the
 Federal government the most obvious effect of these changes has been spiraling inflation and now massive
 unemployment. Most Americans, according to the latest polls, fear this depression will be as terrible as the great
 one of the thirties. No one knows for sure what 1975 will bring for American pocketbooks. But the portents are
 for even more dramatic changes than in 1974.
 In this atmosphere of economic depression and constant political change, the Fifth Estate has managed to
 achieve substantial results. There hasn't always been enough money-there still isn't-nor has public support for
 our effort been vigorous. But with hard work and a little faith in our knowledge and approach, we have managed
 to overcome the obstacles of 1974. In many ways the Fifth Estate has grown in numbers and influence; it has
 monitored the most dangerous trends in the security community; it has provided the public with information on
 these trends and has joined with them to oppose abuse of power in government. With your support, 1975 can be
 as equally effective and gratifying.
 GROWTH
 Despite severe funding limitations, members of the Fifth Estate toured the nation this fall, ooveringover 25
 cities coast-to-coast. The Fifth Estate multi-media presentation was followed by workshops in many c t s for
 those interested in initiating local projects. The Fifth Estate also sought to establish liaison with organizations and
 individuals in other localities whose work is related to the focus of the Fifth Estate. Among the many conferences
 attended by the Fifth Estate were: the National Committee Against Repressive Legislation NCARL) conference
 in the spring; the National Lawyer's Guild Conference (with whom we work closely); the International
 Association of Chie s o  o ice       ; an  the American Industrial Security_Association (AISA). The Fifth
 Estate also participated in a conference on covert action sponsored by the Center for National Security Studies.
 RESEARCH and EDUCATION
 Throughout 1974, the Fifth Estate attempted to collect data in as many areas as was possible, concentrating
 on those areas of vital concern. Most of this work was performed by two of the autonomous, independent and
 non-profit groups within the Fifth Estate; the Intelligence Documentation Center, and Fifth Estate Security
 Education. Both are located in the nation's capital.                                             -~
 R rch has concentrated on the following issues:
 The Terrorist Information Proiect (Tie) was launched with the rise of the SLA. Working with reporters and
 other investigators, our investigation revealed that SLA member Donald DeFreeze, aka Cinque, had, in the past,
 been a police informant and agent provocatuer. This phenomenon raised the spectre of government agencies using
 terrorism as a catch-all for repressive domestic operations. Additionally, we examined the activities of two less
 well-known groups-the Natio~eus ofl.abor Committees (NCLC), which claims to be a left wing group; and
 IDENTITY, a paramilitary right wing group using a church as a cover. Although lacking funds, TIP will continue
 to receive the attention of the Fifth Estate, due to the increased focus of security groups on countering terrorism.
 The Fifth Estate also undertook a painstaking analysis of the FBI COINTELPRO memos released through the
 Freedom of Information Act, and we are working with several attempts to discover how widespread
 COINTELPRO operations were and if they are still continuing. COINTELPRO was the FBI plan to disrupt and
 neutralize various political groups. COINTELPRO authorized illegal actions.
 We initiated a major research effort into the relatio   os of international labor organizations with the CIA.
 The Fifth Estate also uncovered an intelligence network operating in thg_United_St~tes run by_the Saigon
 ,government, gathering information on both Americans and Vietnamese citizens in this country opposed to this
 obvious y corrupt dictatorship.
 We explored the role of the Defense Intelligence Agency in the coup which overthrew Salvadore Allende in
 Chile.
 Memos obtained by the Fifth Estate revealed that local utilities were sponsoring intelligence gathering
 operations aimed at foes of nuclear pow er plant co~nn.
 e a so exposed a cot f1den is study prepared for LEAA on methods of stopping the flow of illegal aliens into
 the United States, suggesting a variety of Orwellian methods and blaming aliens for virtually all of the social ills of
 the United States.
 We also explored the incidents of cooperation between the CIA and Soviet KGB which have come to our
 attention.   -'- _"-----.-.'_                                                                 -.

 helped to procure at the trials were more important than the Pentagon Papers.
 In disseminating our research and providing educational materials for the public, the Fifth Estate worked with
 Canadian Broadcasting or`poration, the British BroadcastingrCorQoration, an  tFroaasting Corporation of
 .a.wide range of the Fourth Estate (media). We were either interviewed on, helped produce, or otherwise aided
 news stories on over 25 radio stations: 10 -local television stations, all the national networks (as -well as-the
 we have successfully stimulated response by the public on many important issues.
 PROSPECTUS FOR 1975
 During 1975, the Fifth Estate hopes to initiate and work with already'existing groups, to continue to build a
 nationwide network of citizen's research and educational groups on questions of security. Contacts and key
 organizers for such groups already exist in over 30 cities
 At the present time, there are two research and educational projects being conducted by Fifth Estate Security
 Education. The Labor Education Project hopes to conduct extensive research into the ways in which labor
 organizations have been targeted by various intelligence agencies. The project will concentrate on providing
 information to rank-and-file workers on CIA-labor operations. For more information contact: Winslow Peck.
 During 1975, we hope to begin a pilot training program to train para-legal workers in basic investigative
 techniques. This program grows out of our experiences working with the Wounded Knee trials. For more
 information contact: Margaret Van Houten.
 TbLo  roblem for the Fift Estate is, as we have said, financial. We have an adequate analysis of the ways
 and means power is abused in the security community.  a have an enormous potential human force. And we
 have a successful program. But we just do not have enough money.
 Some of our financing has been provided by a few foundations and concerned individuals, such as Norman
 Mar,  eVl  have also raised fun s~tirough several events, and subscriptions f3Zounter- py are increasing. But
 this is just not enough.
 Therefore we wish to encourage all citizens concerned with the problems we raise to investigate us and our
 program, and if you then believe that we are providing a vital service to you and your neighbors, please pledge a
 regular donation for a specific area of Fifth Estate work, on either the national or local level.
 With your participation in the Fifth Estate, 19.75 can prove to be even more successful than 1974.

 2000 P Street, NW. Suite 403 Washington, D.C. 20036 202-785-8385
 In order to bring issues related to the intelligence-gathering
 agencies into the public arena and to create a climate conducive
 to legislative change during this year of Congressional invest-
 igations, a nation-wide teach-in effort has been growing on
 campuses throughout the country.   Programs focusing on such inter-
 related topics as multinational corporations and their relationship
 to the American economy, political assassinations both foreign and
 domestic, police repression including the growing utilization of
 7.W.A.T.  teams, the continued 5ubver iori o" activi.s,t organization,
 and the invasion or individual privacy via surveillance and computer
 technology have been presented on campuses in Los Angeles, Berkeley,
 ^an Francisco, Ann Arbor, Virginia, and '.Vashington, ').C, The ser_ie
 will continue through the 197  academic year and build towards the
 coming presidential elections. The overwhelming concern on the part of
 college students with the systematic violations of civil and human
 rights by the intelligence gathering agencies is reflected in a
 recent article about the Ann Arbor Conferences
 8,000 at U-Mteach-in
 ANN ARBOR, Nov 10 (MFP) -
 In the largest mass political event
 here in recent memory, thousands
 of students and working people
 and more than 25 speakers took
 part in a three-day teach-in here
 last week, "The Bicentennial Di-
 lemma: Who's in Control?"
 Although the keynote speaker of
 the teach-in - Pakistani emigre
 and anti-imperialist intellectual
 Eqbal Ahmad - appeared at the
 end, not the beginning, of the
 three-day gathering, the teach-in's
 functional theme emerged clearly
 as broad-based opposition to US
 imperialism in America and in
 the Third World.
 In his closing statement Egbs.l Ahmad said:
 Speakers on virtually every topic
 were enthusiastically applauded
 as they stressed that each instance
 of CIA subversion or police vio-
 lence is not an isolated issue, but
 one aspect of the larger system of
 US imperialism.
 And each of the speakers was
 again warmly received for their
 emphasis on the importance of
 following up the information and
 analysis set in motion through
 the teach-in with sustained, de-
 termined political action.
 The university is like a mini-corporate-government,
 where there has been a huge amount of training in how
 not to deal with relevant issues.   But a good educat-
 ion should make manifest the organic, living links
 between abstract principles and individual and group
 behavior.   7o when you talk of democracy, you practice
 it.   When you talk of freedom, you live it.   Because
 the function of good intellectual work is to apprehend
 reality, in order to change it.

 Why is a Public Education Project Needed?
 The CIA and other components of the intelligence com-
 munity have come under Congressional scrutiny a number
 of times, but never before have the abuses of power been
 brought so clearly to light. As the pattern of violations of
 civil and human liberties has begun to emerge, from the
 Rockefeller Commission Report to the forthcoming findings
 of the House and Senate Select Committees on Intelligence,
 concerned observers have greed that it is a time for in-
 formed public discussion about our intelligence agencies at
 home and abroad. Only the pernicious or the foolish could
 now suggest that the CIA and other intelligence agencies
 can continue to operate on trust.
 The U.S. Intelligence Community which includes:
 Central Intelligence Agency
 National Security Agency
 Defense Intelligence Agency
 Army Intelligence
 Naval Intelligence
 Air Force Intelligence
 State Department (Bureau of Intelligence and
 Research)
 Federal Bureau of Investigation
 Atomic Energy Commission (Intelligence Division)
 Treasury Department
 And 63 other agencies with intelligence gathering functions
 must be studied and discussed in the public arena in order
 to determine public opinion in the following critical areas:
 ? The legitimate governmental purposes that intelligence
 both foreign and domestic should serve.
 ? The viability of a joint oversight committee of Congress
 in view of past performances.
 ? The investigations of the House and Senate Select Com-
 mittees on Intelligence to determine their thoroughness
 and the possibilities of their leading to positive legislative
 change.
 ? The massive abuses of civil and human rights and their
 implications for people in free society.
 ? The cooperation that continues to exist between agen-
 cies on federal, state, and local levels.
 During this critical year of revelations a climate conducive
 to legislative change can and must be created in Apppved
 and community forums.

 A BASIC UNDERSTANDING of U.S. intelligence operations can be gathered from a number of books available
 it .libraries or in paperback format: Books such as CIA and the Cult of Intelligence by Victor Marchetti and John
 Marks, The Invisible Government by David Wise, and The Secret Team by Fletcher Prouty are three important
 books that will give the reader a sense of the depth, form, and history of U.S. intelligence operations. For a more
 complete listing of books available, write the Fifth Estate, Box 647, Washington D.C. 20044.
 FORMER. CIA OFFICER PHIL AGEE's book Inside the Company: CIA Diary is a firsthand account of CIA
 operations in Latin America. The book is currently unavailable inside the U.S., but can be legally sent to you by
 friends in Canada or Great Britian. CIA Director William Colby has threatened to bring criminal charges against
 Agee because of the accuracy and content of this important and informative book.
 ORGANIZED TEACH-INS AND SEMINARS sponsored by student-faculty groups,  labor unions, and
 community organizations have occurred throughout the country this spring with thousands of people partici-
 cpating. Just as the teach-in effort was an integral part of building the civil rights and anti-war movements, they
 clan also be valuable in marshalling public sentiment against repressive police and intelligence agencies operations.
 Respurces for one to three day conferences are plentiful, and a partial listing of resource organizations is
 included in this pamphlet.
 LOCAL RESEARCH/ACTION TEAMS can conduct investigations and political work around a number of
 crucial areas. Campus based teams, for example, could begin to identify the CIA recruiting officer/professor at
 their school, or the ties between collegate institutes and the CIA. Community based teams could begin to
 investigate the workings of local "red squads" and political intelligence units. The Fifth Estate stands ready to
 help with the formation and training of such groups when help is requested. It is our hope that every intelligence
 unit, no matter how "small" will experience a thorough "citizen's examination" of their operations.
 ..TQ.BUILD FOR ACTION
 EXPOSE AND CONFRONT INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY RECRUITERS when they appear on your
 campus: both the CIA and the National Security Agency have adopted a policy of "open recruitment", although
 the CIA also maintains a network of "old boy" recruiters on major campuses. Just as confronting Dow Chemical
 and other war profiteers was a successful tactic for raising the question of government-corporate-academic
 cooperation during the '60s, confronting CIA and NSA recruiters can raise these same points of government-
 corporate-academic cooperation during the '70s.
 ORGANIZE COALITIONS TO WORK FOR POLICE 3UDGET CUTS. Recent exposes of illegal operations by
 local police departments can provide a fulcrum for forcing the city council to cut funding to police departments
 for spying activities. As has been shown in New York, Chicago, and Washington D.C., the targets of police
 intelligence have been-a broad spectrum of liberal and radical organizations. Perhaps the abolition of police
 political intelligence work is one area that these groups can unite upon.
 A LEGISLATIVE FOCUS ON INTELLIGENCE: The Congress currently has four separate committees working
 on intelligence investigations. Additionally, state and county legislatures are conducting similar investigations, or
 can be pressured to do so. We suggest that you write or visit your local representatives and express your
 viewpoints on abuses of power by the intelligence community. For a complete listing of Congressional investi-
 gative committees and their members, write the Fifth Estate or the Center for National Security Studies.
 WRITE FOR YOUR FILE: Under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, you can now contact the
 FBI, CIA, or other Federal agencies and request copies of files they may have on you. Although certain items
 May be legally deleted from your file prior to its release, you can get an idea of the depths of government spying
 on your life. Different agencies require different pieces of information in order to search their files, and further
 information on procedures can be obtained from the Fifth Estate, Center for National Security Studies, The
 Freedom of Information Clearinghouse, or your local ACLU.
 MOBILIZE FOR THE FALL: Plans are now underway for demonstrations against the CIA and transnational
 Corporate intervention in the sovereign affairs of other nations. Suggested sights for the demonstrations are
 Washington D.C., Chicago, and a west coast city: the most probable date for these actions will be Sept. 11th, the
 second anniversary of the coup d'etat in Chile. For further information concerning these mobilizations, contact
 the Fifth Estate. Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000200470001-4

 K. Barton Osborn
 Having worked for years in illegal intelligence programs for
 the Army and the CIA, K. Barton Osborn speaks from experience.
 The former director of political agent operations for the infamous
 Phoenix Program brings a wealth of expertise to the platform. A
 witness before House and Senate Committees, founder of the
 Intelligence Documentation Center, and analyst of the Intelligence
 Community (articles in Harper's and Playboy), the thirty-one year
 old Osborn believes the best way to bring government spying
 under responsible control is to publicize it.
 Anthony J. Russo
 Anthony Russo earned a national reputation for helping
 Daniel Ellsberg photocopy the Pentagon Papers... and for going
 to jail for it. Work with the RAND Corporation's Viet Cong
 Motivation and Morale Project gave him a first-hand view of
 inte!!iget?ce activities. His opposition to the war after his return to
 the U.S. in 1968 made him the object of intense government
 surveillance and general harassment. An expert on American
 intelligence methods, he has been personally wiretapped, beaten
 up, and jailed.

 REPRINT AND DISTRIBUTE THIS LEAFLET
 Mr. Clarence Kelley, Director
 Federal Bureau of Investigation
 10th and Pennsylvania, N.W.
 Washington, D.C. 20535
 This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act as amended (5 U.S.C. Sec.552).
 I write to request a copy of all files in the Federal Bureau of Investigation indexed
 or maintained under my name and all documents returnable by a search for documents containing
 my name.  To assist you in your search.  I have indicated my social security number and date
 and place of birth below my signature.
 As you know, the amended Act provides that is some parts of a file are exempt from release
 that "reasonably segregable" portions shall be provided.   I therefore request that, if you
 determine that some portions of the requested information are exempt, you provide me immed-
 iately with a copy of the remainder of the file.  I, of course, reserve my right to appeal
 any such decisions.
 If you determine that some or all of the requested information is exempt from release,
 I would appreciate your advising me as to which exemption(s) you belive covers the infor-
 mation which you are not releasing.
 I am prepared to pay costs specified in your regulations for locating the requested files
 and reproducing them.
 As you know, the amended Act permits you to reduce or waive the fees if that "is in the
 public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as primarily benefiting
 the public."  I believe that this request plainly fits that category and ask you to waive
 any fees.
 If you have any questions regarding this request, please telephone me at the above number.
 As provided for in the amended Act, I will expect to recieve a reply within ten working
 days.
 Sincerely yours,
 Social Security No.     Date of Birth

 Index" which has named up to 15,000 people targeted for arrest in case of a national
 emergency.   Started in the 1950's and ruled unconstitutional, the list is still maintained
 by the FBI.   The FBI has also admitted to breaking into people's homes, establishing mail
 covers, and launching disruption and harrasment campaigns against individuals and political
 organizations under its infamous COINTELPRO operations.
 CLARENCE KELLEY SAYS, "KEEP THOSE CARDS AND LETTERS COMING, FOLKS."
 The FBI says its is recieving only 1400 requests a month from citizens asking for
 thier personal files.  Actions in court by many Americans who faced the full force of FBI
 repression many help to force FBI compliance with these requests.   But at this point in
 the struggle, it is apparent that the FBI is only partially fullfilling its obligations
 under the Freedom of Information Act.  What is needed now is a mass movement of tens of
 thousands of citizens requesting their files.   FREE YOUR FILE!  By writing for your file
 you can actively demonstrate your opposition to FBI wrong doing.  You can say NO to FBI
 harrasment.   You can say NO to FBI crimes.  You can say no more FBI political files.
 And from the coorespondence and files you recieve you will have tangible proof of your
 struggle against repression.   If tens of thousands of Americans write for their file,
 the FBI will be forced to change its proceedures for handling the requests.  We can make
 it so costly and unmanageble for the FBI to maintain political files that the practice
 may be curtailed.   Write Clarence Kelley today!
 Reprint ( both sides ) and distribute this leaflet by the thousands on your campus or in
 your community.   You can construct a Freedom of Information Booth on your grounds or your
 neighborhood corner.   The booth can just be a table with a frontpiece displaying copies
 of files you have obtained, pictures of FBI agents, documents, etc.   Copies of this leaflet
 and other liturature can be handed to passerbys who can be encouraged to write for their
 files.   Just file in the form letter on the other side and mail it today to the FBI.

 The FBI requires the name, address, date and place of birth, and social seucrity number
 of a requestor.  You may also include other data which you consider helpful.  As of May 1,
 1975, the FBI had recieved some 2,500 requests of which eighty percent were for personal
 files.   This is not enough.   But about 450 of the requests have been processed, with a
 backlog weeks overdue.   The Bureau is routinely requesting extensions beyond the 10 day
 limit.   If this campaign grows, we can expect even longer backlogs and extensions.   FBI
 spokesmen state that they conduct a torough search of all Bureau files.   They also claim
 that all data compiled in field offices is automatically included in records kept at
 national headquarters.   It is advisable, however, to state that you would like a search
 conducted in the field offices of any cities in which you may have lived.   For this purpose,
 you should include the names of the cities in which you resided and the dates of residence.
 You should also request the FBI to conduct a search of its Electronic Surveillance Index
 for information on you.   The FBI will estimate the number of pages to be duplicated upon
 location of the records.   If the cost exceeds $25.00, the requestor is so advised.   The FBI
 will accept payment of one-fourth the total amount and release the records upon agreement
 to pay the remainder as soon as possible.   The FBI has refused to waive fees in the public
 interest and is charging some of the highest rates of any agency of department.   For more

 Former CIA director Richard Helms is appointed
 ambassador to Iran in 1973.
 Tibet-From 1959 through the mid 1960's, CIA
 equips and trains Tibetan exiles in their struggle
 against the Chinese.
 Viet Nam-CIA helps consolidate Diem's power in
 1955, launches sabotage and guerrilla raids against
 the North and pacification programs in the South.
 After the overt escalation of the war upon the Tonkin
 Gulf incident (in which a CIA raid likely played a
 role), the CIA starts its Counter-Terror program in
 1965 in imitation of Viet Cong terror tactics, begins
 its Phoenix Program in 1967 which kills tens of
 thousands of innocent persons as well as Viet Cong,
 and continues political manipulation and other
 covert action after the cease-fire agreement.
 Laos-CIA organizes and directs a Secret Army
 (secret from the U.S. Congress and the American
 people) from 1962 to 1973, employing 35,000 Laotian
 and 17,000 Thai mercenaries and having control over
 a large part of the U. S. military within the country
 for bombing and other support.
 Phillippines-CIA helps put down the communist
 Huk insurgency in the early 1950s.
 Cambodia-CIA plays a role in a coup which topples
 Prince Sihanouk in 1970, which paves the way for the
 U. S. military invasion of Cambodia in the same year
 and which results in the civil war being waged to this
 day.
 Indonesia-CIA, through the supply of money,
 arms and a secret airforce of B-26 bombers, is un-
 successful in attempt to overthrow Sukarno in 1958.
 Greece-CIA's massive and continuous political

 CIA is offered "cover" and returns the favor by
 teaching informal classes in illegal intelligence
 techniques such as break-ins and wiretapping; CIA
 participation in civil disorder planning and opera-
 tions. CIA ownership of hundreds of "proprietary",
 or front corporations. CIA operatives on over 1U0
 U.S. college campuses for recruitment of foreign
 students and other clandestine purposes.
 Cuba-CIA organized military invasion in 1961 at the
 Bay of Pigs fails to overthrow the Castro government.
 Throughout the 60's, the CIA sponsors regular armed
 incursions by Cuban exiles directed out of Miami.
 Guatemala-CIA  directed  invasion  overthrows
 Arbenz government in 1954, establishing a quasi-
 military dictatorship. Heavy CIA manipulation of
 domestic Guatemalan  politics continuing until
 present.
 Equador-Extensive CIA covert political interven-
 tion in the early 60's destabilizes two civil govern-
 ments which refused to break relations with Cuba.
 The resultant political chaos leads to military rule.
 Peru-CIA trains a secret counter-guerrilla force in
 the mid-60's which wipes out the local insurgency
 movement.
 Bolivia-CIA counter-insurgency advisors organize
 and direct the tracking down of Che Guevara and his
 guerrilla force in 1967.
 Brazil-CIA funds unsuccessful candidates in op-
 position to President Goulart who moves to expro-
 priate ITT and maintain relations with Cuba. CIA
 then orchestrates anti-government operations by
 labor, military, and middleclass groups, including
 courses in "labor affairs" in Washington D.C. The
 resultant coup in 1964 establishes the repressive
 military dictatorship still in power.
 Chile-CIA secretly funds anti-Allende political
 forces in 1958, 1964, and 1970 elections. Having failed
 to block Allende's election to the presidency in
 1970, CIA directs a destabilization of the economic-
 political order which leads to the military coup in
 1973. A half century of democracy is ended, and one
 of the most brutal Latin American military dictator-
 ships installed.
 Uruguay-CIA  manipulates  Uraguayan  politics
 throughout 1960s and, according to the first-hand
 testimony of ex-CIA operative Phillip Agee, pres-
 sures the government to accept an AID police train-
 ing mission which provides cover for CIA case

 The following highlight the repressive features of
 S. 1:
 WIRETAPPING. Reaffirms the 1968 law, including
 the ambiguous Presidential authority to wiretap do-
 mestic activities where a "danger to the structure" of
 the government is involved. By virtue of incorporat-
 ing the multiple changes in existing statutes, S. 1.
 expands the areas where wiretapping is permitted as
 part of the investigatory processes. Directs telephone
 companies and landlords to cooperate "forthwith"
 and "unobtrusively" with government wiretappers,
 and provides for compensation for such cooperation.
 (Chapt. 31, A; pp. 206-18)
 DEATH PENALTY. Attempts to circumvent the 1972
 (Furman v. Georgia) Supreme Court decision which
 held that capital punishment was cruel and unusual
 punishment because it had been "so wantonly and so
 freakishly. imposed." (Mr. Justice Stewart, concur-
 ring.) Would provide mandatory executions for cer-
 tain crimes under certain conditions. (Italics mine.)
 (Chapt. 24; pp. 194-98)
 "LEADING" A RIOT. Redrafts 1968 law. Provides for
 up to three years in jail and/or up to one-hundred-
 thousand-dollar fine for "movement of a person
 across a state line" in the course of execution or con-
 summation of a "riot." A "riot" as defined could in-
 volve as few as "ten" participants whose conduct
 "creates a grave danger of imminently causing" dam-
 age to property. Invokes comprehensive federal juris-
 dictional involvement down to the level of barroom
 affrays.
 (Sec. 1831; p. 173)
 F,NTRAPMENT. Permits conviction of defendants for
 committing crimes which they were induced to com-
 mit by improper pressures of police agents. Puts
 burden on defendant to prove that he was "not pre-
 disposed" and was subject to "unlawful entrapment,"
 (Sec. 551; p. 59)
 CONTEMPT.  Penalty for refusal to cooperate with
 congressional committees, e.g., Senate Internal Se-
 curity Subcommittee, is increased from one year in
 prison and a thousand-dollar fine to three years and/
 or one hundred thousand dollars. (Sec. 1333; p. 93)
 SECRECY. Reverses democratic decision-making un-
 der the Constitution by substituting government
 secrecy for the freedoms guaranteed by the First
 Amendment. Provides for penalties ranging from up
 to three years' imprisonment and/or up to one-
 hundred-thousand-dollar fine to death penalty to
 prohibit public access to "national defense informa-
 tion." S. 1 would vastly expand the scope and sever-
 ity of criminal sanctions to enforce the administra-
 tive classification of documents. There are more than
 fifteen thousand federal employees in forty-seven
 executive departments authorized to classify docu-
 ments, and an estimated billion pages of data already
 classified. With the definitions provided under Sec.
 1128 for "classified information" and "national de-
 fense information" so vague as to defy precise de-
 scription, S. I codifies what can best be described as
 an official secrets act. Sec. 1121 provides for life im-
 prisonment, or the death penalty, "in time of war or
 during a national defense emergency" for collecting
 or communicating "national defense information"
 with the knowledge that it "may be used to the prej-
 udice of the safety or interest of the United States,
 or to the advantage of a foreign power." (p. 69)
 (Would the exposure of government corruption ren-
 der a government employee or a news reporter subject
 to the law? )
 Sec. 1122 provides from seven to fifteen years in
 prison and up to one-hundred-thousand-dollar fine
 for communicating "national defense information" to
 a person "who he knows is not authorized to receive
 it." (Daniel Ellsberg and Tony Russo?)
 Sec. 1123, under the euphemism "Mishandling
 National Defense Information," provides for up to
 seven years in prison and/or up to one-hundred-thou-
 sand-dollar fine for a person who receives "national
 defense information" and "fails to deliver it promptly"
 to a federal agent. (pp. 69-70) (The New York Times
 or Unitarian-Universalist Beacon Press re Pentagon
 Papers?)
 Sec. 1124 would extend the suppression of infor-
 mation to its ultimate length, providing three to seven
 years' imprisonment and/or up to one-hundred-
 thousand-dollar fine for passing "classified informa-
 tion" to a person who is not authorized to receive it."
 (p. 70)
 SEDITION. Redrafts 1940 Smith Act, made inoper-
 ative by 1957 Supreme Court decision (Yates v. U.S.).
 Provides up to fifteen years' imprisonment and/or up
 to one-hundred-thousand-dollar fine for allegedly in-
 citing "other person to engage in imminent lawless
 conduct that would facilitate" the destruction of the
 federal or any state government; and, up to seven
 years' imprisonment and/or up to one-hundred-thou-
 sand-dollar fine for participation as an active mem-
 ber in a group that the defendant "knows" has such
 a purpose. (Sec. 1103; pg. 64) When combined with
 the criminal conspiracy and solicitation sections, the

 jeopardy to protected speech is further increased.
 (Secs. 1002-1003; pp. 60-61)
 MARIJUANA. Possession of the slightest amount for
 personal use entails thirty days' imprisonment and/
 or ten-thousand-dollar fine; second offense increases
 to six months and/or ten-thousand-dollar fine.
 ILLEGAL EVIDENCE. S.  I incorporates provisions de-
 signed to make "voluntary" confessions admissible
 even if obtained by secret police interrogation in the
 absence of counsel and warning prescribed in the
 Miranda case, and provisions designed to assure ad-
 missibility of eyewitness testimony regardless of prior
 police  irregularities  in  suggesting  identification.
 (Sees. 3713-14; pp. 273-74)
 HANDGUNS.  In  line with President Ford's recent.
 message on crime, S. 1 eschews the Brown commis-
 sion's recommendation to establish effective national
 control of handguns. Instead, the bill makes the use
 of a dangerous weapon in committing a crime a sep-
 arate offense entailing penalties in addition to those
 provided for the underlying crime. Such a proposal
 might make sense in connection with a system that
 did not otherwise contemplate more severe treatment
 of armed offenders.
 It is absurd to add a mandatory five-year penalty
 to a life sentence or to ten or twenty years, and to
 suppose that this will have any noticeable effect on
 the use of weapons by individuals who have already
 demonstrated their defiance of much greater threat-
 ened punishment. (Sec. 1823; pp. 171-72)
 NURENBERG DEFENSE. Would inhibit prosecution of
 wrongdoing by "public servants" if illegal conduct is
 result of "mistaken" belief that it was "required or
 authorized," or based on "written interpretation
 issued by the head of a government agency" (e.g.
 from a President?).
 (Secs. 542, 544, & 552; p. 57-59)
 OBSCENITY. Freezes into statutory law recent re-
 strictive decisions of the Supreme Court in this area.
 S. 1 would permit the invocation of federal law en-
 forcement against the most trivial local transactions.
 It precludes as a defense that the material in ques-
 tion might be lawfully produced and distributed
 under the relevant state laws.
 (Sec. 1842; pp. 177-78)
 INSANITY.  S.  1  represents  an important regression
 from existing law. It admits insanity as a defense
 'f the insanit cg used a la  of " h state   mind
 n
 I
 required as an element of the offense charged. Mental
 disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a de-
 fense." To fail to accord such a defense is to ignore
 the relevance to guilt of moral responsibility and
 power to choose.
 SENTENCING.  Contrary to the  Brown  Commission's
 recommendations,   S.  1  provides  for  very  high
 maximum penalties, a parole component in addition
 to the prison maximum, and fewer limitations on
 the use of consecutive sentences. S. I also makes
 parole and probation harder to obtain and requires
 mandatory minimum sentences in certain instances,
 thereby eliminating judicial discretion and exacer-
 bating the problems resulting from high maximum
 sentences.
 (Part III, pp. 182-194, also Sec. 1811, p. 166 & Sec.
 1823, p. 171.)
 SABOTAGE. Provides the death penalty or life im-
 prisonment in some cases, up to twenty to thirty
 years in prison and/or up to one-hundred-thousand-
 dollar fine in others, for activity that "damages,
 tampers with . . ." almost any property or facility
 "used in or particularly suited for national defense"
 or service that is or might be used in the national
 defense, with intent to "interfere with or obstruct the
 ability of the U.S. or an associate nation to prepare
 for or engage in war or defense activities." Clearly,
 such language would make every public demonstra-
 tion, no matter how peaceful and orderly, subject to
 potential criminal sanctions.
 (Sec. 1.1 11; p. 64 )
 DEMONSTRATIONS.  Virtually  every kind of civil
 rights, peace, and other protest action would be
 threatened with severe penalties under a series of
 vaguely drafted infringements on the right of assem-
 bly, including restrictions on the right to demon-
 strate adjacent to wherever authorities may declare
 to be the "temporary residence" where the President
 may be staying. (Sec. 209; p. 391. For other sections
 see: Sec. 1112, 1115, 1116, & 1117 - pp. 65-68;
 Sec. 1302 - p. 82; Sec. 1311 - p. 83; Sec. 1328 -
 p. 91; Sec. 1334 - p. 94; Sec. 1861 & 1863 - p.

 Legislative History of the Bill
 To understand the repressive features summarized
 below of S. I (H.R. 3907) it is necessary to review
 its legislative history. The present U.S. Criminal
 Code is an archaic collection of laws, replete with
 contradicting redundancies. It was last updated in
 1909. The problem has been long recognized by legal
 scholars, and in 1966 a National Commission on
 Reform of Criminal Laws was appointed by President
 Johnson pursuant to a statute that required it.to be
 bipartisan. The Commission of twelve consisted of
 three senators, three representatives, three federal
 judges, and three members at large. Former Cali-
 fornia Governor Pat Brown was named chairperson.
 An advisory committee of fourteen with wide ex-
 perience in criminal law was also named. It was
 headed by former Associate Justice of the Supreme
 Court Tom C. Clark.
 The Brown commission, as it became known,
 labored for five years and achieved a remarkable de-
 gree of consensus. Significantly, the three Senate
 members of that commission - McClellan, Hruska,
 and Sam Ervin - frequently found themselves out-
 voted.
 The Brown commission completed its study draft
 in 1970, and submitted its final report on January 7,
 197 1, to President Nixon and the Congress. In the
 ensuing two years, two critical developments oc-
 curred. First, in their capacity as the leadership of the
 Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures of
 the Senate Judiciary Committee, the outvoted Senate
 members of the bipartisan Brown commission had
 their way, and on January 4, 1973, introduced their
 dissenting views as S. 1 of the ninety-third Congress.
 In the judgment of Louis B. Schwartz, Benjamin
 Franklin Professor of Criminal Law at the University
 of Pennsylvania and director of the Brown commis-
 sion, their legislation represented "an outright rejec-
 tion of the commission's basic approach to criminal
 law."
 Second, President Nixon, in disagreement with
 both the Brown commission and the dissenting sena-
 tors, called upon Attorney General John Mitchell
 and later, his successor, Richard Kleindienst, to re-
 write the bipartisan commission's Final Report, and
 on March 14, 1973, he called upon Senators McClel-
 lan and Hruska to introduce the Administration's
 "Criminal Code Reform Act of 1973," as S. 1400.
 According to Professor Schwartz's judgment at the
 time, "The Nixon program contradicts in every re-
 spect ... the recommendations of the National Com-
 mission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws....
 The President has taken a position far to the right of
 the Senate subcommittee's proposal ... widely re-
 garded as `very tough' . . . a program of primitive
 vengefulness."
 Thereafter, Senators McClellan and Hruska held
 hearings to consolidate S. 1 and S. 1400. Altogether,
 some eight thousand pages of testimony, much of it
 critical, were taken before the subcommittee termi-
 nated its hearings in August, 1974. With the nation's
 attention focused on the scandals of Watergate and
 then the articles of impeachment, the press all but
 ignored the developing issue. On October 21, 1974,
 with assistance from the Department of Justice under
 President Ford, the consolidation was announced as
 complete. With minor amendments, it was this legis-
 lation which was then introduced with such broad
 and powerful sponsorship on January 15, 1975, as
 S. I - the "Criminal Justice Reform Act of 1975."
 "S. 1 expresses the view that the crime problem
 can be solved by extending government's power over
 individuals. This extension can take the form of wire-
 tapping and other secret surveillance, of giving broad
 discretion to officials in decisions about punishment,
 of authorizing exceptionally severe sentences, or of
 restricting access to critical information about gov-
 ernment operations. The other school of thought,
 represented by the Brown commission, is skeptical
 about the gains in law enforcement that can be ex-
 pected from such measures, and more concerned
 about impairing the quality of civic life by needless
 restraints on liberty."

 Mat Con stiIU LIV11QIaMt1'1e~. -LYII~IZ~t~I'~C Bill!
 "In our judgment the enactment of S. 1, the pend-
 ing bill to revise the Federal Criminal Code, would
 constitute an unparalleled disaster for the system of
 individual rights in the United States. Furthermore,
 we believe that the bill is inherently unamendable
 and should be recommitted for complete overhaul
 and redrafting.
 "Our conclusion that S. I cannot be satisfactorily
 patched up by the amendment process is based pri-
 marily upon two essential features of the present bill:
 "(1) The bill contains too many chapters, sections,
 subsections, clauses, words, and definitions that
 would have to be changed. It is impossible to enum-
 erate all the danger points in S. 1, but some idea of
 their extent can be seen from a partial listing of these
 areas that urgently need revision. They include pro-
 visions dealing with the handling and publication of
 "national defense information," advocacy of over-
 throw of government by force (the Smith Act), ob-
 structing government functions by fraud, statements
 impairing military effectiveness, riots, disorderly con-
 duct, contempt, and obligation to give testimony, en-
 trapment, wiretapping and electronic surveillance,
 the death penalty, conspiracy, [criminal] attempts,
 the insanity defense, obscenity, responsibility of
 public officials for violation of law, penalties for
 criminal offenses, probation and parole, and com-
 plicated problems of federal jurisdiction.
 It would be naive to believe that these countless
 provisions could be restructured and redrafted, one
 by one, through the procedure of motion to amend,
 amendments to the amendment, debate, and vote,
 either in committee or on the Senate floor. Long be-
 fore such a process could be completed the pressures
 would be irresistible to make a few changes and let
 the rest go through.
 "(2) S. 1 was designed and drafted upon the basis
 of philosophical, ethical, and political goals that
 were repudiated by the American people in the
 Watergate scandals. The bill is the product of the
 Nixon Administration, prepared under the aegis of
 Attorneys General Mitchell and Kleindienst, and put
 into concrete form by a group of lawyers in Nixon's
 Department of Justice. The objective of the drafts-
 men was to incorporate into the criminal code every
 restriction upon individual liberties, every method
 and device, that the Nixon Administration thought
 necessary or useful in pursuit of its fearful and cor-
 rupt policies. As such, the bill is permeated with as-
 sumptions, points of view, and objectives, finding
 expression in numerous overt or subtle provisions,
 that run counter to the open and free spirit upon
 which American liberties are based. This pervasive
 taint cannot be amended out.
 "Inherently Unamendable"
 "We do not oppose revision of the Federal Crim-
 inal Code. It must be recognized, however, that the
 task is an enormously complex one, involving deci-
 sion on literally thousands of provisions of law that
 vitally affect every citizen. Congress should start
 with a bill that has been drafted by people who are
 committed to preserving American rights. It can then
 effectively proceed to debate and amend those par-
 ticular parts of the legislation where policy changes
 are thought desirable. But it must have a solid foun-
 dation, firmly fixed in the tradition of American
 democracy, to begin with. S. I does not supply such
 a foundation."

 Here's what you can do:
 1   Urge your U.S. Senators to work to defeat S. 1 and send it back to
 committee for total redrafting!
 WARNING: Reacting to mounting national protests against this legislation, some
 Senate sponsors of S. 1 are submitting amendments: while purportedly aimed at
 answering the criticisms raised, they do not substantially alter the repressive thrust
 of the legislation; others do attempt genuine corrections. However, constitutional
 authorities state that these belated efforts at this stage in the legislative process
 bear out their charge that S. 1 is inherently unamendable.
 2   Urge your U.S. Representative to be alert against S. 1 and those who
 under the guise of reforming the archaic U.S. Criminal Code, would
 turn back the clock of justice!

 THE ORGANIZING COMMI'I'I'EE FOR
 A FIFTH ESTATE
 HON. LARRY McDONALD
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, March. 19, 1975 -
 Mr.           McDONA.LD  of  Georgia.  Mr.
 Speaker, on March 13, 1975, my colleague
 Mr. DEI.LUMS entered into the RECORD a
 letter from an organization known some-
 what obscurely a.s the Organization Com-
 mittee for a Fifth Estate,-OC-5-which
 I had on February 20 characterized, with
 two other groups, as being among those
 attacking the security services of the-
 United States.
 In their somewhat hysterical "Dear
 Ron" letter, the OC-5 attempted to throw
 out a smokescreen of denial based on
 misquotations, evasions and lies. Because
 of this, I believe that it is desirable to
 add some specifics to my earlier state-
 ment.
 The OC-5 letter states Perry Fellw-ock
 has been using the alias of Winslow Peck
 'to protect himself from potential har-
 assment from Government intelligence
 agencies." This is in direct contradiction
 to Peck's January 16, 1972 statement to-
 the New York Times which quoted him
 as saying:
 I know the FBI knows who I am. I'd like
 to  avoid  publicity  but  I'm  willing  to  go
 through trial, and, if I have to, I'll go to
 jail.   . But I no longer feel the oath that
 I made when I was released from duty to
 alias for such juvenile activities as past-  Committee for a Fifth Estate Is a poten-
 ing up posters in the Capitol Bill area 'tial threat to both internal and interns-
 during July 1973, entitled "Colby, W.E."
 which read, "Wanted for crimes in con-
 nection with the Phoenix murder plan
 which resulted in the first-degree mur-
 der and/or torture of 49,565 Vietnamese.
 Consider him dangerous."
 And I notice with interest that Fell-
 wock/Peck does not deny that at about
 '
 23,
 .2:15 p.m. on Saturday, October
 '1971,  at  the  First  Congregational
 Church, 10th and G Streets NW., Wash-
 ington, D.C., he was prevented from
 speaking about his alleged NSA activi-
 ties because he was exhibiting many
 symptoms of drug abuse. In the words .
 of his peer group, which at.that time
 included Bill Kittridge, Karen Men-
 coneri, John Boldt, Joel Beatty, Gordon
 Finch and others, Fellwock/Peck was .
 "stoned out of his mind." -
 In the OC-5 letter,' Timothy Charles
 Butz, ? a native of Munroe Falls, Ohio,
 states he was not an organizer for Kent
 State SDS. I agree, and stand by my
 original  statement that Butz was  an
 "SDS activist at Kent State," and an
 organizer for Vietnam Veterans Against
 the War/Winter Soldier Organization
 In Washington, D.C..
 Mr. Butz must know that the leader-
 ship cadre at Kent State University in-
 cluded Colin "Sunshine" Neiburger, later
 a "gay Mayday" activist in Washington
 in -1971;  Joyce Cecora;  Mark Lencl;
 Terry Robbins, killed in the explosion of
 an SDS Weatherman bomb factory in
 New York in March, 1970; Howie Em-
 mer; and Lisa Meisel, now the wife of
 Robert "Bo" Burlingham, a former editor
 of Ramparts magazine indicted in 1970
 and 1972 on Weatherman bombing con-
 spiracy charges and now with the Cam-
 bridge Policy Studies Institute. Butz
 must still recall that he was not invited
 into the SDS leadership cadre.
 OC-5  also seeks  to explain 'away a
 Berkeley Barb article relating to OCG5
 representative.  Douglas  Ethan  Allen
 Oliver Porter, Ji.'s claim of OC--5 pos-
 session of stolen documents. Attached at
 the end of these remarks is the full text
 of the news item. -
 OC-5 also paid me a dubious compli-
 ment by alleging I was in receipt of either
 CIA or FBI files on their organization.
 This is not true. The OC--5 cabal forget
 that earlier in their letter they admit
 that "the history of the Fifth Estate is
 a matter of public knowledge." That is
 true, and the founding members of OC-5
 li ust know that all my statements relat-
 ing to their actions and words are In ref-
 erence to their public, albeit scandalous,
 behavior. I have made no mention of

 urge my colleagues on the House Judici-
 ary Committee who now have jurisdic-
 tion over matters of Internal security, to
 invite the OC-5 group to, testify under
 oath on their activities. At such a hear-
 ing I would be happy to present a docu-
 mented history of their endeavors in
 detail-.

 SPYING  ON BIG BROTHEa-
 (By Steve Long) . .
 " \ve want a classified memo  it  day to
 leak." The speaker was Doug Porter, a young
 bearded former underground reporter who is
 now   with                                the  Washington-based Fifth
 Estate.             -        .
 The Fifth Estate was described by Doug
 Porter as a "non-prpft, non-partisan, non-
 polluting organization dedicated to spying
 on Big Brother, the American    intelligence
 community. Our only consumers of informa-
 -
 tion are the American public."
 Doug Porter was recently in Berkeley to
 present  a  slide show  on  US  foreign  and
 domestic strategy, and this reporter tall:ed
 with him    about the   origins of  the  Fifth
 Estate. The parent organization out of which
 the Fifth   Fst.ate grew was known   as  the
 Committee for Action/Research on the In-
 telligence Community (CARIC).     -
 CARIC was the source for one of the first
 Watergate stories by Bob Woodward and Carl
 Bernstein of The Washington Post. CARIC
 also  provided  opposition  witnesses  to the
 confirmation hearings of CIA Director Wil-
 liam Colby, thereby bringing out new in-
 formation                                                                                                                                                on   the   infamous    Operation
 Phoenix (a CIA program to destroy the NLF
 infrastructure In South Vietnam). A flnat
 accomplishment of CARIC was the sin Wishing
 of  the  Washington,   D.C.  "red  Squad"  In
 1973.    CARIC  convinced a  D.C.  police in-
 former, Bob Merritt, to "turn over"--to quit
 the police and talk about his 'experiences,
 thus exposing the key agents In the D.C.
 red squad.
 At the same time that CARIC u' as operat-
 ing  early  in  1973  author  Norman                                                                                                                                           Metier
 established  another organiz.^.tlon  with  the
 same purpose. Mailer announced at his 50th
 birthday party, attended by New York's elite,
 that as his birthday present to the American
 people he was going to do something about
 the  level of paranoia  In  the    US--he  was
 going to create an organization, to be called
 "the Fifth Estate," t4' watch the other four
 estates (the three branches of the Federal
 government plus the media).  .
 Mailer proceeded to speak on college carn-
 puses for the next six months about his new
 organization, at the end of which time be
 had a mailing list and little else except a
 paper organization.
 CARIC and Mailer's Fifth Estate merged
 as a result of a "Dear Noonan" letter by
 Nat Hentoff  in  the Village Voice. Hentaif
 wrote, that CARIC was doing effective work,
 so  why not merge the two organlzatlons?
 Mailer agreed, and the merger was effected
 in March, 1974. The name of Mailer's organi-
 zation, the Fifth Estate, was retained after
 the merger. -                                 -
 "The effect of the merger is that Norman
 gives us money and uses his good name on
 our  behalf,  and  we  do  the  work,"        Doug
 Porter said.                 .
 Doug said that there are currently three
 major projects of the Fifth Rdtate. The first
 project is "mass outreach," oriented toward

 for a book to be published next, year on
 the labor project.    -
 The third on-going project Is the building
 of  the  Intelligence Documentation  Center
 (IDC). "It is a library--a data base--located
 in Washington, D.C., so that researchers can
 have it readily available for their use. It
 always has more materials available on the
 -Intelligence community than the Library of
 Congress." The ID-C, consists not only of
 hooks, but flies-"press clippings, debriefings
 we have done, government reports, corporate
 reports, and stolen documents," Doug said.
 A book to be published next year will 'be
 based on the IDC. The book is The Whole
 Spy Catalog, doscribed by Doug as "a com-
 pendium of everything we know about the
 Intelligence community,  and some helpful
 hints on how people can fight back."
 The Fifth Estate Is very conscious that the
 government might conduct counter - Intelli-
 gence operations against It, so It has an

 In Northern Ireland. The CIA has recently
 increased the number of its agents In Great
 Britain with the hope of undermining the
 strikes of British industrial workers. The CIA
 is currently aiding proto-fasclst groups In
 Italy, and U.S. military intelligence agencies
 are being used to spy on German and Jap-
 anese citizens.
 The recruit coups In Cyprus and Greece
 .were CIA-sponsored, Doug believes. In Africa,
 retiring U.S. Green Berets are now being re-
 cruited  to  fight  liberation  movements  In
 Mozambique and Rhodesia. The CIA, In spite
 of a recent public relations campaign, Is still
 up to its old "dirty tricks."

 A few of my colleagues in the House
 and in the other body have called for
 resumption of normal relations between
 the United States and Cuba. In fact I
 recently read an article which summa-
 rizes events between the United States
 and Cuba which point toward normaliza-
 tion. The article Is entitled "Our Men in
 Havana?" It is written by Peter Hughes
 and Chris Hughes. Peter Hughes is a
 legislative assistant to Senator HARRY F.
 BYRp, Jr., who concurs with my opposi-
 tion to normalization of relations with
 Cuba. The article was written for the
 April 1975 issue of the Alternative:

 Since 1971 a number of Senators, includ-

 Speculation that a change in U.S.-Cuban
 relations was imminent lncrcased further in

 The pundits suggested that President FL,rd
 might want to initiate some major foreign
 policy overture of his own; he needed to es-
 cape from the shadows of Nixon's diplomatic
 legacy, and Cuba was the logical choice. The
 new chairman of the Senate Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee, John Sparkman (D.-Ala.),
 has recently added his voice to those calling .
 for such overtures. Moreover, other countries

 It's high time to put an end to the Central Intelligence Agency's
 meddling around the world. The secret armies, pacification programs,
 coupF d'etats, assassinations, and manipulations of the CIA are
 actually working against our national interests.
 Tens of thousands of people have been killed, millions have been
 denied the right of self-determination, and people throughout the
 world--rightfully so-- think of us as "ugly Americans". History
 will record the CIA as being the most henious gang of liars, thieves,
 cutthroats, and fascists since Hitler's SS.
 Ab,olution of the CIA's clandestine operations function is not
 enough.  The men and women of that agency will not stop plying
 their trade simply because there is not official government
 support of their operations. Through private and corporate enter-
 prises, these individuals will continue their clandestine activities.
 Others will find work as mercenaries for foreign dictatorships.
 Currently, CIA officials are helping soldiers displaced by the
 disbanding of Special Forces get jobs with the racist governments
 of Rhodesia and South Africa.
 The personnel of the CIA must be neutralized if the dirty tricks
 are to be stopped. The records of the CIA need to be examined for
 evidence of criminal activity. CIA personnel implicated must be
 brought to justice, through a Special Prosecutor or other appropiate
 legal mechanisms.
 The end of the CIA is inevitable. If the people of the United
 States do not act, then history will record that the CIA was
 neutralized by other means.  American citizens will find themselves
 in a position similar to that of the German people after World
 War Two.
 History is watching.'The Whole World is watching. We must act.

 which--such as section 314(d) funds and

 others, but we must continue funding
 this vitally needed item. Recently the
 Seattle clinic expanded, and they have
 hopes of offering more complete services
 to urban Indians. This of course takes
 money.
 As one member of the Seattle Indian
 Health Board said:
 It's working and we just want it to work
 more.
 Such a successful program certainly
 deserves more congressional support.
 BIG BANKERS ARE GETTING REST-
 LESS AGAIN AND WANT EXCUSES
 TO EXORBITANT INTEREST RATES
 RETURNED NOW
 ., HON. WRIGHT PATMAN
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, July 18, 1975
 Mr. PATMAN. Mr. Speaker, the big
 banks are apparently getting ready to
 head out for another year of record-high
 porfits while the. Nation struggles to re-
 cover from the worst recession since the
 Great Depression and 8.5 million people
 are without jobs.
 First National City Bank of New York,.
 the Nation's second largest, announced
 on July 11 that it was raising its prime
 rate from 7 percent to 71/4 percent. Three
 days later, First National Bank of Chi-
 cago, Continental Illinois of Chicago,
 Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh, Crocker Na-
 tional Bank of San Francisco, and Union
 Bank of Los Angeles quickly' jumped on
 the old, familiar bandwagon by announc-
 ing they too were raising their, interest
 rates for their best customers, the big
 corporate borrowers. All the other large
 commercial banks across the country will
 undoubtedly play "follow the leader"
 again in what will be another round of
 inflation pumping Interest rate. Increases
 applied to small as well as big borrowers.
 It is axiomatic that when the prime
 rate climbs, other types of loan rates-
 automobile, consumer, residential mort-
 gage, small and medium size business-
 either remain at intolerably high levels
 or move In that direction. It Is a phe-
 nomena. that coupled be called "The
 bankers Rule of Maximizing Profits Re-
 gardless of Cost to the Economy."
 The cold reasoning by which many
 leaders of the banking industry rational-
 ize their actions was articulated a few
 days ago by Richard L. Thomas, vice
 chairman of. the board of the First Na-
 tional Bank of Chicago. In reporting this
 current round of prime rate increases,
 the New York Times quoted him as
 saying:
 BIG BANKERS  ARE  GETTING  RESTLESS  AGAIN
 AND WANT EXCUSES TO EXORBITANT INTEREST
 RATES RETURNED NOW
 "We are confident that this a forerunner"
 of further interest rate increases. He told
 the Times that his bank raised Its prime
 rate because of recent increases in interest
 rates paid by the bank for short term funds.
 But he added that the prime rate was also
 raised because of "pretty good loan demand."
 In other words, First National of Chicago is
 not going to betray Its principles by failing'
 to capitalize on the struggle to Increase In-
 vestments and develop some strength In what
 has been and still is a sick economy.
 Mr. Thomas frosted the bankers cake, as It
 were, by going on to say that If the economy
 strengthens over. the rest of the year, "we
 think the trend [in interest rates] will be
 'upward."
 Mr. Speaker, the bankers are obviously
 growing restless again. It's been more than
 a year since the prime rate was at an his-
 toric high of 12 percent and they have been
 away from that level too tong.
 On the same day that the Times was
 reporting this new'round of prime rate in-
 creases, ? the Wall Street Journal disclosed
 that "more large banking concerns reported
 sizeable earnings gains for the second quar-
 ter."
 These Included BankAmerica Corporation,
 parent bank holding company of Bank of
 America of San Francisco, the nation's larg-
 est bank, which had second quarter income
 Increase of 25.7 percent over the correspond-
 ing period of 1974; Chase, Manhattan Cor-
 poration, holding company for Chase Man-
 hattan Bank of New York, with an increase
 of 38.7 percent; Manufacturers Hanover Cor-
 poration, parent bank holding company of
 Manufacturers Hanover Bank, which had an
 18.0 percent increase in net operating in-
 come; the Charter New. York Corporation,
 bank holding company for Irving Trust, with
 an 18.7 percent Increase; Mellon National
 Corporation, parent of Mellon Bank, with an
 8.4 percent Increase; and First Chicago Cor-
 poration, parent of First National Bank of
 Chicago, up 10.6 percent.
 The Journal reported that "as with other
 banks that previously have reported first
 half results, the latest gains chiefly reflect
 an improvement in interest net Income."
 Mr. Speaker, It looks as though the big
 banks can look forward to even better profits
 in the third quarter and fourth quarter of
 the year at the expense of slower economic
 recovery and high unemployment.

 Mr.    McDONALD  of  Georgia.  Mr.
 Speaker, among the most vociferous crit-
 ics of the Central Intelligence Agency
 and other branches of the American in-
 telligence community is the Organizing
 Committee for the Fifth Estate-OC-5---
 which describes itself as "dedicated to
 spying on Big Brother, the American In-

 The OC-5's current campaign demands
 the total abolition of the CIA; its corol-
 lary aim Is to provide support for defec-
 tors from that and other Federal and
 local agencies,
 OC-5's current staffers include Tim-

 Agee has admitted to the mass media
 that he made some half dozen trips to
 Cuba during the writing of his expose?,
 and that he frequenly was in touch with
 officers from Cuban embassies in Europe.
 Agee has stated, "Quite frankly, I don't

 or not;" and has expressed the hope that

 his disclosures "will provide the first

 In his acknowledgements section In
 ."Inside the Company," Agee stated his
 book could not have been written without
 the encouragement of representatives of
 the Communist Party of Cuba, the re-
 sources of the Cuban Government, and
 information provided by staffers of the
 North American Congress on Latin Amer-
 ica, an anti-U.S. research group with
 close ties to the Cuban Government.
 Frederick Robert Branfman, 33, was
 active with the International Voluntary
 Service In Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
 Upon his return to the United States in
 1971, Branfman Immediately took a lead-
 ership role in the ranks of the so-called
 "antiwar" propagandists supporting the
 North Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Lao-
 tian Communist Insurgents. On May 4
 In Washington, D.C., Branfman joined
 with Arthur Kinoy, David Dellinger, and
 other leaders of the revolutionary Na-
 tional Interim Committee for a Mass
 Party of the People for a'Lafayette Park
 "celebration" to honor the bloodstained
 Communist victory In Vietnam.
 Sylvia E. Crane was one of the foun-
 ders and is currently a national officer
 of the National Committee Against Re-
 pressive Legislation, formerly the Na-
 tional Committee To Abolish the House
 Un-American  Activities  Committee/
 House Internal Security Committee. Un-
 der Its original name, this organization
 was cited, after extensive investigation,
 as a Communist front. The organization
 is still headed by Identified Communist
 Frank Wilkinson.
 David Dellinger, who described himself
 In an SDS radical education project bro-
 chure In 1969 as a "Communist, although
 not of the Soviet variety," has however
 clearly demonstrated his supp6rt of the
 Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Cuban va-
 rieties of Marxism-Leninism. His Insti-
 tute for New Communications is the pub-
 lisher of a new radical newsweekly, Seven
 Days, currently In the "preview" edition
 stages.
 Frank J. Donner, in addition to his
 present position as head of the ACLU's
 political surveillance project at Yale Law.
 School, has the dubious distinction of
 having been thrice Identified as a mem-
 ber of the Communist Party, U.S.A. He
 was identified twice as a member of a
 Communist Party cell In the National
 Labor Relations Board In Washington,
 ? D.C., which employed him in its litigation
 section from 1940 until 1945.
 Called before the House Committee on
 Un-American Activities In 1956 and con-
 fronted with a Civil Service Commission
 questionnaire on which he had answered
 "no'." to membership in a Communist
 organization, Donner invoked the fifth
 amendment privilege against self-in-
 crimination when asked if his statement
 had been truthful.
 In 1959, Donner was a member of the
 law firm of Donner, Sacher, Perlin &
 Freedman, as was Arthur Kinoy. Harry
 Sacher has also been Identified as a mem-
 ber of the Communist Party. During the
 1960's, Donner was general counsel for
 the United Electrical, Radio & Machine
 Workers of America, a Communist con-
 trolled union expelled from the CIO In
 1950. He has been associated with such
 Identified  CPUSA fronts  during  the
 1950's and 1960's as the National Law-
 Yer's Guild, the American Committee for
 the Protection of the Foreign Born, and
 the National Emergency Civil Liberties
 Committee.
 Since the late 1950's, Frank Donner has
 devoted much of his energy to counter-
 security activities. His 1961 book, "The
 Un-Americans," served to create major
 publicity for the initial stages of the
 Communist Party's Operation Abolition
 attack on the House Committee on Un-
 American Activities-HCUA-and later,
 the House Internal Security Committee.
 The HCUA report, "Communist Legal
 Subversion: The Role of the Communist
 Lawyer," in 1959 noted that "Speaking on
 such topics as 'Informers as a Means of
 Suppression,' and 'Informers as Tools,'
 Donner has excoriated all Individuals
 who have been of assistance to congres-
 sional committees."
 During more recent years, since head-
 ing up the ACLU's antisurveillance oper-
 ation. Donner has used such left-leaning
 forums as the Nation, a magazine char-
 acterized by HCUA as "Communist-line"
 in 1961 and whose editor the California
 Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-
 American Activities noted, has partici-
 pated "in the activities of the Communist
 Party Itself"; ACLU's the Civil Liberties
 Review; and the New York Review of
 Books; to argue for the dismantling of
 the American intelligence community.
 It was Frank Donner who was sought
 for comments-of it scatological nature-
 on my CONGRESSIONAL RECORD reports on
 current U.S. revolutionary activity by the
 rock music and counter-culture maga-
 zine, Rolling Stone. To avoid an impres-
 sion of partisanship, Rolling Stone might
 obtain comments from other than Com-
 munists and National Lawyers Guild
 members; no matter what other" positions
 they may hold.

 Mark Lane, an attorney and activist
 since the early 1950's with the National

 In view of his more serious activities
 with the National Lawyers Guild, "legal

 be needled for his "Investigation" of the

 in addition to his OC-5 advisory board
 role-that of Washington, D.C., editor
 of Genesis, the "magazine for men."
 Spread over many pages of that porno-
 graphic publication was Prouty's April

 to lend some semblance of social signifi-

 what It can to hasten the demise of the
 present one. Raskin, long a disarmament
 advocate, was the founder of the New'
 Party in 1968, now called the People's
 Party, a self-stated Socialist organiza-

 of not only the Armed Forces, but of
 police and civilians; and an end to U.S.
 opposition to foreign guerrilla insur-

 In an editorial letter, OC-5 writes:
 As spring approached and the thaw devel-
 oped around the once invlncable fortress of
 national security, we were fighting for our
 very existence. A series of financial pledges
 withered away simultaneously with attacks
 from the far-right, elements of the Intelli-
 gence community and other government
 agencies. Slanderous and distorted informa-
 tion was placed in the congressional Record
 by Georgia Congressman Larry McDonald, a
 member in good standing of the John Birch
 Society, and a leader of that outfit. McDonald
 was challenged by us to make the same al-
 legations in a forum where Congressional
 Immunity from lawsuits did not apply, but
 like other demagogues in the past, he prefers
 to hide in the pages of the Congressional
 Record. During the same week of McDonald's
 ravings we were red-baited to a few of our
 friends In the press by some of the 'old boys.'
 Rumors reached us that the CIA considers
 us 'Cuban agents', an unbelievably absurd
 charge. And then our financial base was all
 but destroyed during the same period.
 Taking Into account OC-5's contacts
 with foreign intelligence operations, such
 as Philip Agee's membership on the OC-5
 advisory board, the "Cuban agents"
 charge may be taken as an investigative
 lead as to the true operation of the
 Organizing Committee for the Fifth

 PROPOSED CHANGE IN THE SOCIAL
 SECURITY QUARTERLY DEPOSIT
 PROCEDURE  FOR  STATE  AND
 LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
 HON. JOEL PRITCHARD
 OF WASHINGTON
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Friday, July 18, 1975
 Mr. PRITCHARD. Mr. Speaker, as you
 may be aware, the Social Security Ad-
 ministration-SSA-has made clear it
 'intends to require States and local gov-
 ernments to make monthly, instead of
 quarterly, deposits of social security con-
 tributions for their covered employees,
 The voluntary agreements between the
 States and SSA under section 218-of
 the Social Security Act-were made with
 the mutual understanding that social
 security contributions were to be paid
 quarterly, as they have been without
 question since public employees were first
 covered in 1951.
 Under the terms of each joint Federal-
 State agreement, each State is respon-
 sible for administering its own social
 security program and must bear the cost
 of  Its  administration.  The  proposed
 change promises to greatly increase each
 State's administrative costs while elimi
 nating any opportunity the States have
 to offset the costs of administration with
 interest earnings from the funds. In the
 aggregate, the States will lose about $120
 million in interest annually-at a time
 when they will be required to incur even
 greater administrative expenses.
 Each State now files form OAR-Si
 with SSA each quarter to report social
 security tax information. In addition,
 each State must also file a form OAR-
 S3 somewhat equivalent to form 941-A
 of MS-each, quarter containing wage
 Information on each employee. When you
 realize  that  there are  about  62,000
 State and local government reporting
 entities with almost 9 million employees,
 you can readily appreciate the concern
 of State and local administrators that
 money and paperwork have to be handled
 three times more often.           .
 Because of the proposed change, sev-
 eral States have considered terminating
 their Federal-State compact-denying
 social security coverage to their public
 employees. The States justifiably view
 the  joint  agreement  as  a  two-way
 street-and they have made it clear that
 they will resist attempts to have added ,
 expenses unilaterally thrust upon them
 by moving for termination. The proposed
 shift, which was never agreed to by the
 States, surely violates the spirit of the
 section 218 agreements if not the actual
 language.
 Prior to their entrance into the State-
 Federal agreement, many States had to
 obtain enabling legislation from their
 legislatures. Because this legislation con-
 tained the guidelines under which the
 State agency would operate, including in
 some cases the quarterly deposit pro-
 cedure, the Implementation of SSA's pro-
 posed regulation would require action
 by the State legislature in some States.
 In order to add .on new employees to
 handle the monthly deposit procedure,
 Sonic State administrators will have to
 go to their legislatures to obtain excep-
 tions to budget ceiling laws or to statu-
 tory ceilings on the hiring of new per-
 sonnel. Compounding this problem is the
 fact that many State legislatures oper-
 ate on a biennium-- and meet once every
 2 years.
 If deposits are made monthly and re-
 ports  filed  quarterly-or annually as
 proposed by the SSA-further problems
 arise. Many State and local. financial
 procedures-in order to comply with
 State statute and constitutional pro-
 visions-will not allow money to be paid
 out of the State treasury which is based
 upon estimates.
 Making a switch to a quarterly deposit
 procedure even more complex is the fact
 that all but two States have institution-
 alized the quarterly deposit procedure
 for their  State  retirement  syystems..
 Under the current system, the coinci-
 dence of deposit dates substantially re-
 duces the cost of administration of the
 State retirement systems. A monthly de-
 posit procedure for social security con-
 tributions promises to Impose addition-
 al costs on the administration of State
 retirement systems.
 The Federal proponents of stepping-up
 the periodic deposit procedure do not
 believe that they are Imposing any addi-
 tional burden on State and local govern-
 ments, because, in the words of the
 Treasury Secretary:
 Most  local  units  of  government  have
 highly sophisticated accounting procedures
 . and equipment.
 In fact, the majority of local govern-
 ments-towns, cities, and counties-in
 most States do not have centralized pay-
 roll systems, do not have modern ac-
 counting equipment, do not have full-
 time paid officials, and ill many cases do
 not even have actual office quarters. One
 State social security administrator in-
 formed me that many-times he receives
 quarterly written-out on notebook pa-
 per and even on a brown paper sack in
 a few instances,
 The SSA argues that the - current
 deposit system is no longer justi
 fled in that large sums- of money are lost
 to the Social Security Trust Fund
 and      this loss must be made up by
 all ,    taxpayers, Economists have told
 me that because taxpayers pay both
 State and local taxes, the net effect is
 zero. The issue is clearly whether the
 Federal Government will reap windfall
 interest Income-about $120 million-at
 the expense of the States.
 No further action by SSA will be taken
 until both they and the Subcommittee
 on Social Security have had an oppor-
 tunity to review the results of an SSA
 questionnaire and a State-by-State anal-
 ysis                                                                                          of statistics being assembled by
 the National Conference of State Social
 Security Administrators.
 However, the SSA-at the behest of
 the Office .of Management and Budget,
 the HEW Secretary and the Treasury
 Secretary-have made clear that they

 the  federal  government  and  intended  to
 benefit bona fide family farmers.
 Westlands,  the country's largest water
 district, will receive a total of $638 million
 in federal subsidies according to a present
 value computation of. the 40-year, 83 billion
 subsidy. That calculation was contained in
 en earlier GAO report to Senators Nelson
 and Haskell.
 Private  landowners  who receive  federal
 water and own more than 160 acres must
 contract with  the federal government to
 dispose of all land in excess of 160 acres
 within 10 years. The 1926 Omnibus Adjust-
 ment Act provides that such excess lands
 "shall be appraised in a manner to he pre-
 scribed by the Secretary of the Interior and
 the sale prices thereof fixed by the Sec-
 retary on the basis of its actual bona fide
 value at the date of appraisal without ref-
 erence to the proposed construction of the
 irrigation works."  GAO found that "the
 Bureau does not adequately support its basis,
 or give consideration to all appropriate fac-
 tors, in establishing land values without
 project benefits."
 Critics of the Bureau contends that it
 has allowed excess land holders to inflate
 approved sale prices by including as a con-
 dition of sale farm facilities and equipment,
 leasehold rights, corporate stock, and in one
 ((eeztseme case, an airplane landing strip'.
 k= GAO report said that the Bureau should
 evaluate the value of these extras on the
 basis of their usefulness to the purchaser,
 particularly one who chooses to operate a
 small farm.
 Haskell and Nelson stated, "The GAO
 findings on the Bureau's price approval prac-
 tices substantiate our concern that family
 farmers  Interested  in  actively  operating
 their own farms are being precluded from
 obtaining low cost excess land. Congress
 never intended the benefits or federal ir-
 rigation projects to go to groups of paper
 farmers who purchase large blocks of excess
 land and lease it to large operators."
 Nelson and Haskell noted that they are
 currently drafting legislation which would
 Include the major provisions recommended'
 by GAO to assure that the benefits of fed-
 eral irrigation go to family farmers.

 DIGEST
 (Appraisal  Procedures  and Solutions to
 Problems Involving the 160-Acre Limita-
 tion Provision of Reclamation Law, De-
 partment of the Interior)
 Reclamation law limits to 160 acres the
 land on which any one owner is entitled to
 receive water from a Federal water resources
 project. Owners of more than 160 acres in
 the Westiands Water District may receive
 water on such excess land from the Bureau
 of Reclamation's Central Valley Project If
 they sign recordable contracts agreeing to
 sell such excess lands within 10 years to
 eligible buyers at prices based on the actual
 bona fide value of such lands without refer-
 ence  to  the  construction  of - the Federal
 project.
 GAO reviewed Bureau appraisal techniques
 for assessing the value of excess land without
 project enhancement and believes such tech-
 niques need improvement. The Bureau does
 not,
 Adequately support Its basis, or give con-
 sideration to all appropriate factors, in estab-
 lishing land values without project benefits,

 Adequately document the basis for its in-
 dependent evaluations.
 In addition, GAO believes that to Improve
 management control there Is a need for writ-
 ten Bureau guidelines, and for periodic in-
 ternal reviews, applicable to the Bureau's
 excess land appraisal activity.
 To improve the management of the ap-
 praisal activity and to insure that appropri-
 ate factors are considered In establishing the
 sale price of excess lands without project en-
 hancement, the Secretary of the Interior
 should require the Bureau to:
 Undertake a formal study in the Westlands
 Water District designed  to ascertain' the
 value of excess lands, by class and location,
 without project enhancement, giving con-
 sideration to the decreasink ground water
 supply that would have resulted if the Fed-
 eral project had not been constructed.
 Obtain from the seller supporting data for
 values assigned by the seller and to docu-
 ment in the sales file the basis for the valu-
 ations assigned by the Bureau's appraiser.
 Issue detailed Bureau guidelines setting
 forth the criteria and procedures for evalu-
 ating excess land sales.
 GAO recommends also.that the Secretary
 have his internal audit staff schedule re-
 views of the appraisal activity In the various
 I3ureau regional offices.
 GAO also evaluated the practicality of
 three proposed solutions to the following
 problems.    -
 Bureau-approved sales of large minimum
 acreages of excess lands which are sold in
 units to groups of purchasers with require-
 ments to buy all facilities and equipment
 reportedly hamper small family farmers in
 their attempts to buy excess lands.
 Various arrangements such as trusts, part-
 nerships, corporations, and leases reportedly
 allow one farm operator to receive low-cost
 Federal water for large tracts of land he does
 not own and hamper small family farmers
 from owning and operating land in the West-
 lands Water District.
 The three proposed solutions to these
 problems were reinstituting a residency re-
 quirement, establishing a commission to in-
 sure that family farmers are given priority
 In the purchasing of excess land, and estab-
 lishing a system for purchase of the excess
 land by the Government for resale to family
 farmers.
 GAO believes that all of the proposed solu-
 tions could contribute to a reduction in the
 magnitude of the problems. The solution,
 however, that probably has the potential for
 being most effective is establishment of a
 system for purchasing the excess land by the
 Government. for resale to family farmers.
 This solution would be more effective if the
 180-acre limitation provision were made ap-
 plicable to an owner-operator of land receiv-
 ing water from a Federal project rather than,
 as present, being applicable only to the owner
 of the land.--
 Because of the time that would be re-
 quired, the lack of basic data, and the sub-
 jective considerations Involved, GAO did not
 attempt to ascertain the Federal costs that
 might be required to Implement the three
 proposed solutions to certain perceived prob-
 lems in administering the 160-acre limitation
 provision.                            -
 GAO discussed Its findings and conclusions
 with Bureau of Reclamation officials, but as
 requested. GAO did not obtain written com-
 ments from the Bureau or for the Department
 of the Interior.
 TRIBUTE TO INTERNAL SECURITY
 SUBCOMMITTEE
 Mr. STONE. Mr. President, for many
 years, the present ,Cuban regime has been
 In the habit of aiding terrorism and vio-
 lence throughout the world. The United
 States has always opposed such activities,
 and Secretary Kissinger's warnings to
 the Cuban regime would seen to make
 the administration's position clear on
 this subject. However, more disturbing
 than Castro's subversive interference in
 the domestic affairs of foreign countries
 is his fomenting of underground terror-
 ism in our own country. Leading the ef-
 forts to expose and document such ac-
 tivities is the Internal Security Subcom-
 mittee of the U.S."-Senate. As the sub-
 committee has demonstrated, the Castro
 regime uses Puerto Rico as an infiltration
 base into our country. Agents trained by
 Cuba operate in major U.S. cities such
 as Chicago and New York, where Cuban-
 trained terrorists cause the January 24,
 1975 bombing explosion of. Fraunces
 Tavern, killing five persons and injuring
 56 others. Facts such as these would not
 be known by many people were it not
 for the diligent efforts of subcommittee
 investigators like Al Tarabochia and
 Dave Martin.
 Exemplifying the opinion. held of the
 subcommittee by Jaw enforcers through-
 out the country, is a recent resolution
 adopted by the International Association
 of Bomb Technicians and Investigations,
 expressing "the appreciation of our or-
 ganization to the Senate Subcommittee
 on Internal Security for the valuable in-
 formation on terrorism which it has com-
 piled and published and for Its efforts to
 promote better public understanding of
 the importance of adequate-. law en
 forcenient  intelligence  in, combating
 terrorism."
 I ask unanimous consent  to  have
 printed in the RECORD a letter which
 Capt. Tom Brodie, advisory commit-
 tee member of the IABTI and a leading
 Dade Coulnty, Fla., law enforcement of-
 ficer, wrote to me, enclosing a copy of the
 resolution along with an accompanying
 letter to Chairman EASTLAN D.  Captain
 Brodie expresses his concern and that of
 fellow law enforcers over reports of ef-
 forts to eliminate the Subcommittee on
 Internal Security. IABTI officers and
 members believe that the information
 published by the subcommittee has been
 extremely useful to law enforcers In their
 work against terrorism. As is pointed out
 in their letter to the chairman, it is es-
 pecially important that the subcommit-
 tee continue Its investigations , du ing
 these troubled times, when terrorism is
 on the rise at home and abroad.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 MIAMI, FLA.
 DEAR SENATOR .STONE: As you know, I have
 for a number of years now, served as bomb
 expert to the Dade County Public Safety De-
 partment. I am still grateful to you for the
 very generous introduction you gave me
 when I testified before the Senate Subcom-
 mittee on Internal Security last September,
 together with three other bomb experts from
 different parts of the country.
 I also serve as a member of the Advisory
 Committee of the International Association
 of Bomb Technicians and Investigators and
 that is why I am writing this letter. The
 purpose of this letter is to convey to you
 the text of a resolution unanimously adopted
 by the IABTI at its recent convention in

 It began, in February of 1973, at the 50th birthday
 party of Norman Mailer. There were 500 people at
 the Four Seasons in New York and they paid $30
 each and some very stiff drinking was in evidence.
 Mailer stood up and told the crowd where its money
 was going. The money would create a ,tax - free
 foundation called "The Fifth Estate,'.' he said.
 The Fifth Estate would be "a democratic secret
 police, a people's FBI and a people's CIA to inves-
 tigate those two,". he said. "If we have a real
 democratic secret police to keep tab on Washing-
 ton's secret "police, .,which isn't democratic, but
 bureaucratic, we'll then be able to see how much of
 our paranoia is justified," he said.
 Wednesday night, Tim Butz of The Fifth Estate
 sat in a lecture room at Western Michigan Univer-
 sity and talked about how the work is going. "The
 .CIA now .is on the run," he said. But the job is not
 ,.dotie, he said. "We have one hell of a job on our
 hands," he said.
 This has all.become a matter of newspaper head-
 h nes.'Butz is co - editor of The Fifth Estate's
 quarterly newsletter, Counter = Spy.. When CIA
 station chief Richard Welch was gunned down last
 month in .Greece, the newsletter was blamed for
 blowing his cover.
 Butz is 28, a veteran of 19 months in Vietnam who
 came home in 1966 to Kent State University in Ohio
 and the antiwar movement. He is a stocky guy with a
 light brown beard. On Wednesday night, he wore a
 blue leisure suit. A red: tie was pulled loose at the
 collar:, His right hand waved a pencil in small arcs as
 he spoke.
 He said the CIA has a 30 - year record of "murder,
 carnage, infiltration, subversion and 10,000 other
 forms of horror throughout the world." The record is
 continuing in the war in Angola, he said.

 basketball game.'Butz spoke to 66 persons at Room
 2302, Sangren Hall.
 ,The..talk was sponsored' by two campus groups,
 The Committee for a Democratic Foreign Policy
 and the Southern African Liberation Committee.
 Chris Root, a Washington, D.C, 'lobbyist, and Bar-
 bara Marsh, of the Michigan Free Press, a counter-
 culture newspaper in_Ann Arbor, also spoke.'
 Miss Root recited the history of Angola. "The
 history of oppression, and its result in Angola, is
 indeed a very. long one,  she said. "Colonialism
 means different things in different countries, and in
 Angola, it was an especially harsh one.
 The war in the African country is between those
 that would have "neo - colonialism" and those that
 want "true independence," she said. She said the
 MPLA (the Popular. Movement for the Liberation of
 Angola) is fighting. for the "self-determination of
 Angola."
 The MPLA has Soviet backing. The U.S. monies
 have been going to 'the other side, she said. For the
 CIA, Butz said, "Angola is just going to be one more
 along a long,, long list." For the CIA, Butz said, it is
 another attempt to make the world safe for the
 "multinational corporations."
 . The talk went for. more than two hours and then
 there were audience questions and Butz said there
 was a big job of pu''lic education to do.
 He spoke to a le ture room of students who grew
 up with a war on`n ghtly television. We must work,
 Butz said, to' clear 'way "the bleakness that we see
 in our lives in the 1970s.".

 SUBJECT         An  Interview With  Peck,  Marchetti, Marks                and  Stern
 RENE CARPENTER:   Let me   introduce my guests  to you:
 Winslow Peck,  the editor of Counter-Spy.                           Victor Marchetti,
 former high-level CIA official and coauthor of "The CIA and
 the  Cult of        Intelligence,"  along with  John Marks.   And  Larry
 Stern, national affairs writer covering the  Church                        Committee.
 Winslow, maybe we   could  start out with Counter-Spy maga-
 zine.   What                         is  it?   What's it link to the                 Fifth  Estate? What
 is  the Fifth Estate?
 WINSLOW PECK    Counter-Spy is  the organ of                   the organi-
 zing committee for the Fifth Estate.                            The Fifth Estate is a
 community of citizens that are concerned about abuse of power in
 our national security bureaucracy.
 CARPENTER:   Who are  they?
 PECK: Well,  the center of the community is a network
 of researchers who are on cdtlege campuses across the country
 that are looking  into    abuse of power on the national  as well as
 the local level.   And we are opposed to abuse of power  in several
 areas:      first,  the massive corruption and criminality that we
 see, not only in the security bureaucracies, but in many levels
 of our government.
 CARPENTER:   Why do you publish the names of CIA agents?
 PECK:   We publish the names of CIA agents to reinforce
 the  political     fact of what  the  CIA is and what  they do  in our
 name, that they are a secret police force that has never acted
 in the interests of the American people.   Publishing the names
 demystifies the power of the CIA.

 'Beleaguered Amateurs or 'Almost ? ro- essio za

 By Robert W. Merry
 Fiao>i WAsmNccoN, D.C.
 SST .GET REALLY upset," says Tim
 Butz, his jaw taut and his voice
 firm, "that the American people
 don't understand that the CIA has seen
 fit to unilaterally-exercise some of the
 most serious violations of their rights..
 Well, it the agency wants to break the
 law, they will simply-have the whistle
 blown on them."
 -  He pauses just a second, relaxes just
 a bit.."That may sound like boisterous
 talk, given -the resources of the Fifth
 Estate, but we know what effect we've
 had and. we know what effect we will
 have."
 That might indeed sound like boister-
 ous talk; then again, it might not. After
 all, Tim Butz is a top organizer at the,
 Fifth Estate, the dissident organization
 that publishes a once-obscure quarterly
 magazine called Counter-Spy. And some
 people believe that Counter-Spy is at
 least partly responsible for the death
 of Richard S. Welch, the Central Intel-
 ligence Agency's Athens station chief,
 who was gunned down outside his home
 jr.>t before Christmas.
 ,Antiwar Remnant',
 The Welch -assassination came less
 than a year after Counter-Spy identified
 Welch, who normally worked under a
 State Department cover, as CIA station
 Chief - in  Lima,  Peru.. Subsequently
 transferred to Greece, he. was fingered
 by an English-language newspaper in
 Athens about a month before his death.,
 The Incident immediately' yanked
 the Fifth Estate, Counter-Spy, and Butz
 from the closet of obscurity in which
 they had been operating quietly the past
 three years. And it quickly became
 clear that they represent one of the
 most significant remnants from those
 fervid antiwar years of the 1960s and
 early '70s.
 "The Fifth Estate has been passing
 Itself off as a beleaguered amateur
 group," says David Atlee Phillips, for-
 mer CIA agent and one of the country's
 leading defenders of the agency, "but
 the degree and depth of their efforts to
 Identify CIA people have shown them
 to be almost professional, in my view."

 of the antiwar legldns, 'vigorously re-

 But the Fifth Estate's critics aren't
 confined to traditional CIA defenders.
 Some of the' severest criticism was
 found last week on the editorial page
 of the Washington Post, that tribunal
 of tough-minded liberalism. Declaring
 that disclosure of Welch's name was
 "tantamount to an open invitation to
 kill him," the Post added: "Here are
 some American foes of the CIA adopt-
 ing the morality and even abetting
 the technique-indirect assassination-
 which they have so often described as
 ing bartending, the GI Bill (Butz him-
 self is an-undergraduate student),-and

 The  Counter-Spy  controversy left
 many wondering just what this Fifth

 what It does, and who finances it. The
 group's most important patron, it turns
 cut, is Norman Mailer, the author and.
 gadabout of leftist causes, who began
 supporting Butz's efforts In early 1973.
 At that time, Butz and a friend
 named Winslow Peck were trying to
 initiate  an organization  to heighten
 awareness of U.S. security agencies.
 Butz, "an idealistic Kennedy liberal"
 when he first shipped out to Vietnam
 as an Air Force enlisted man in 1966,
 had been an antiwar activist since,
 1969. Peck's background, which was

 MARTIN AGRONSKY:   Yesterday,  about a mile  from this  public
 broadcasting studio,     the body of Richard S.  Welch was buried with
 full military honors  in  the   Arlington National  Cemetery.   President
 Ford,  his Secretary  of  State,  Mr.  Kissinger,  and  the  CIA Director,
 Mr.  Colby,  all honored Welch's memory by personally attending his
 funeral.
 Welch  was the CIA's   top man  in  Greece.  He  was  gunned
 down by  three masked assassins  outside  his     home  in Athens during
 Christmas  week.   Mr. Welch's    name and  CIA connection were    dis-
 closed,                     among  other  places,  in     a magazine  called Counter-Spy  pub-

 Vthe an
 brigade turns on the heat'
 POLICE  surrounded  a  seven-
 storey office block in central
 Washington on Friday after an
 anonymous   telephone  caller
 threatened to speed past in his
 car ;and spray the fourth floor
 with bullets.'
 His  ambitious  aim  was          to
 liquidate seven people working
 in  Suite  403  for  the Fifth
 Estate,  an Organisation active
 in America's growing "alterna-
 tive  intelligence           movement.
 The Fifth Estate is currently
 accused -by the CIA of aiding
 and abetting the assassination
 of  Richard  Welch,  the  chief
 undercover agent in Athens, by
 publishing his name in their
 quarterly magazine Counterspy.
 The caller did not appear, as
 was  expected,  and  the  Fifth
 Estate and the police logged the
 incident with a growing number
 of death threats made to it-
 and several        liberal  senators-
 since the CIA's accusations. But
 the event illustrates the extreme
 reaction now building up against
 the   anti-intelligence groups,
 including Congressional commit-
 tees, that have =been nibbling
 away at the CIA::
 Retired  intelligence officers
 have - formed  ap. '.' old boys "
 association, to,prom.0te and pro-
 Richard Welch
 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000200470001-4
 Peter Pringle reports
 from Washington
 tect their still active colleagues.
 In Welch the association has its
 first martyr. President Ford will
 attend the burial in Arlington
 Cemetery on Tuesday.
 The people prising open the
 CIA's  dirty  tricks  bag  have
 made the .running so far against
 others who would keep-it shut.
 The old - boys association has
 made   little impact  since its
 formation in July. But in the
 wake of Welch's death and CIA
 Director William Colby's plea
 to Congress to help turn the
 heat off his men, the work of
 tiny  groups  like  the  Fifth
 Estate and its hitherto little-
 known publications (Counterspy
 has a circulation of only 3,000).
 are under inspection, too.
 But who is the Fifth Estate
 and what did it do with Welch's
 name? It is a group of people
 of Left-wing views, some of whom
 used to work in intelligence and
 are now regarded by their for-
 mer colleagues as, at best rene-
 gades,  and  at worst Russian
 spies. One of the group's men-
 tors, for example, Philip Agee,
 an ex-agent in Latin America
 Philip Agee         William Colby
 agents from their foreign service
 records were named, of whom 59
 were in London. Richard Welch
 was listed at attache in the US Embassy in Lima. It was the first
 and last time Counterspy men-
 tioned his name. The editors of
 the magazine did not know he
 had  moved  before  the  news
 broke that he had been gunned
 down in Athens.
 In the winter issue of the
 magazine Philip Agee explains
 the policy behind naming the l
 agents. "The. most effective and
 important systematic efforts to
 combat CIA that can be under.
 taken right now are. I think, the
 identification, - exposure   and
 neutralisation  of  its   people
 working abroad." Mx Agee was;
 working on past experience. In!
 October 1974 he revealed the
 names and addresses in Mexico
 City oT 35 official (embassy) CIA,
 agents  and  two  non-embassy
 ones. Within a few days two of
 those named, the station chief
 and his deputy, were withdrawn.
 An-editorial in the magazine
 expresses regret over the locus;
 on  the  CIA, particularly  over;
 the  current  wave of  " myopic
 rage " about the agency.    " We
 believe that the whole system,
 not merely its most mystifying
 appendage is worthy of exami-
 nation," it declared.                                                                                                            But of the
 list of 150 station chiefs printed
 inside it said "'T'his is certainly
 information that the American
 public should have in order to
 understand how the CIA works."
 The Fifth Estate, says that it
 has not been difficult to compile
 these lists: one of the simplest
 ways is tc note all those foreign
 service officers who have been
 attached  to  the  " Office   of
 Special Assistance -to the Am-
 bassador.". That is diplomatic
 language for the CIA, it says.
 But  spotting US  " spooks "
 abroad is not a new pastime.
 A small volume entitled Who's
 Who in the    CIA. appeared in
 Germany in 1967, but no one
 took it very seriously.
 Senator Frank  Church.  the
 champion CIA exposer of the
 Senate intelligence committee,
 was listed. So was Lyndon John-
 son.   But  so                                                                                                         was  Richard
 Welch. Then in November 1974
 in  the  Washington 'Monthly
 John Marks, a  former State
 Department intelligence officer,
 wrote an article uncompromis-
 ingly entitled. How to Spot; a
 Spook.
 who has written a book  about
 his  intelligence  work called
 Inside the Company: CIA Diary,
 is seen by the old boys as an
 agent of Russia's KGB.
 The group's aim is to foster
 a new force " capable of pene-
 trating  the  excessive  secrecy
 rampant in politics today,"
 a  phenomenon  which they
 call   " technofascism," cover-
 ing  any clandestine govern-
 ment or corporate   action-by
 the White House, the army or
 the police. Since it was formed,
 three years ago, however, the
 group has concentrated on the
 more extreme activities of the
 CIA.  '
 This is fully approved of by
 backers like the writer Norman
 Mailer. Be says: .,In this con-
 text the Fifth Estate is homeo-
 pathic   medicine-one   small
 drop for a large disease, but at
 least it is  an instrument by
 which people interested in a par-
 ticipatory democracy may begin
 to  create  the  possibility of
 centres of alternate intelligence
 staffed by citizens for the use of
 citizens."

 spy, almost 100 people the Fifth

 By. Our Staff Correspondent in Washington
 the Justice Department to inves-
 tigate the Fifth Estate. His staff
 conceded  yesterday  that  the,
 Government has no power to.
 keep the magazine quiet.
 "We have checked and found
 there is nothing illegal about
 publishing the names of C.I.A.
 agents," said Mr. Kenneth Mac-
 kenzie, Mr. McDonald's legisla-
 tive assistant. .
 Protecting sources
 " If you leak information about
 Agriculture  Dopartrnent  crop'
 reports it is a criminal offence,
 but there is nothin?d in the law
 about naming peopre who work
 for the C.I.A. The C.I.A. director
 is charged with responsibility to
 protect the  agency's methods
 and sources but is given no cor-.
 responding authority.
 "In effect, the protection that
 has been afforded C.I.A. agents
 so far is honorary."'
 Mr.  William  Colby, the
 agency's Director, is envious of
 the British Official 'Secrets act
 and has urged Congi-ess several
 times to pass similar, legislation
 to protect the C.I.A. . But con-'
 ress has been more interested
 n exposing the agency's covert
 activities and Mr. Colby's pleas
 have been disregarded.
 Mr. McDonald thinks the'mur
 der of ?,fr. Welch may have
 changed the mood in Congress,
 which.is now'in recess. He plans
 to offer legislation to include
 intelligence matters under exist-
 ing laws prohibiting.. disclosure
 of defence secrets.

 Douglas Porter, co-editor of the
 magazine.
 Mr.   Larry  McDonald,  a
 Georgia Democrat in the House
 of Representatives, has urged
 prevent  an  organisation
 opposed  to  the  Central
 Intelligence - Agency going
 ahead with plans to publish.
 the   names  of  about 70
 C.I.A. agents in Europe and
 Africa.
 The  group,  galled Fifth
 Estate, says it will include the
 names in the February issue of
 its magazine Counterspy.
 The magazine first 'disclosed
 the  identity  of Mr. Richard
 Welch!? head of the C.I.A. opera-
 tions in Greece, who was shot
 dead ? outside his ' home ' in
 Athens on Dec. 23. President
 Ford has said that publication
 of Mr. Welch's name was partly
 responsi4le for Phis assassina-
