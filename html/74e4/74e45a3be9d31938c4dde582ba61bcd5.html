INTELLIGENCE REPORT 
Peking and Environs  
Introduction 
1. Peking has been the capital of China for 
most of the past 700 years, but its political 
significance has never been as strong as it is 
today. The origins of the city date back much 
farther into history, possibly to around 2,000 
B.C. Much of Peking's importance is derived from 
its site; it was first a northern rampart against 
outside invasion and later the fortified home of 
the Imperial Court. The basic plan for Peking was 
laid out by the Mongol (Yuan) Dynasty about 1268, 
and the core of the present city, established during 
the early Ming Dynasty, is situated approximately 
on the ruins of the Mongol city. Peking had. a long 
and glorious reign as the Imperial Capital, but 
fell into moderate disrepair after the demise of 
the Manchu (Ch'ing) Dynasty in 1912. The present 
regime has been engrossed in the revival of Peking 
-- now at its apex as the cultural, political, and 
communications center of China.

Basic and Geographic Intelligence and coordinated

. 2. Much of Peking today is new, but the old 
city remains, and its splendid remnants provide 
the Communist leaders of China with an impressive 
backdrop for the display of their political and 
cultural pro-grams. The population has increased 
in the last 22 years from about 2 million to more 
than 7 million, and the city has burst out of its 
original area to spread for miles in every direction. 
Much of the population increase is the result of 
the annexation of sizable tracts located some 
distance from the built-up area. The city is still 
in the throes of a construction boom, and the 
formerly low silhouette of the city is now sporad-
ically disrupted by multistory apartments, hotels, 
and office buildings. Open excavations, casual 
large piles of building materials, and throngs of 
workers are �frequent sights in the area, and 
suburban industrial smoke contributes to a small 
but growing pollution problem. 
3. Travelers have always been strongly 
attracted to Peking. Marco Polo spent the latter 
part of the 13th century here, when the city was 
known as Ta-tu or Khanbalic, before returning to 
Europe to spread tales of Peking's fantastic 
beauty and richness. His accounts appealed to 
the adventurers of that day, and commerical 
interests began to look with fondness on the 
potentially vast and untapped Chinese market. 
Relations with the Chinese developed very slowly, 
however, and by the conclusion of the Mongol 
Dynasty in the 14th century, Chinese rulers had 
begun to look with disfavor on the further-expan-
sion of contacts with foreign countries. Although 
a few foreigners managed to live or .to travel in 
China, the Capital City of the legendary Cathay 
was inaccessible for most non-Chinese in the 
ensuing centuries. 
4. The barriers restricting the entrance 
of foreigners eventually weakened, and by the 19th 
century a sizable body of non-Chinese were living 
in Peking. By this time the Empire was in decay, 
and Peking's grandeur was deteriorating. Xeno-
phobic inhabitants cowered in semi-seclusion 
behind the myriad walls of the hu-t'ung (street

The history of Peking is the story of at least six 
town sites designated by eight place names, and like 
most old Chinese things, the city has its true origins 
shrouded in the myths and legends of the distant past. 
No one can say when the site of Peking was first 
occupied, but it seems reasonable to assume that, the 
area was settled about 2000 B.C. 
Chi was the first known town on the site of modem 
Peking. Located near the northwest corner of the old 
walled city, it became the capital of the Yen state 
under the Chou Dynasty in 723 B.C. Chi was destroyed 
in 221 B.C. by Shih Huang Ti. founder of the Ch'in 
Dynasty. The Peking area was of little importance 
until 70 A.D., when a new city. about 3 miles south of 
the site of Chi. was built under the Han Dynasty. 
Called Yen-ching, it was the capital of the independ-
ent state of Yen. During the Three Kingdom Period 
the name was changed to Yu-chou. The city was des-
troyed by the Khitan Tartars (Liao Dynasty) in 936, 
and a larger city was built on the same site. The 
new town was called Nan-ching (ssuthern capital) 
to distinguish it from a northern capital in Man-
churia, but the alternate name. Yen-ehing (swallow 
capital), was more commonly used. 
The Liao were defeated in 1125 by the Chin (Golden) 
Tartars, and Yen-ching underwent important modi-
fications. It eventually became the Chin capital, 
acquired a new name, Chung-tu (central capital), 
and was considerably enlarged. 
The magnificence of Chung-tu disappeared in 1215 
when it was destroyed by the marauding hordes of 
Genghis Khan. In 1260, Kublai Khan became the 
Mongol Emperor, and he ultimately moved his capi-
tal to Chung-tu. Some of the city was rebuilt, but 
later abandoned as Kublai devised a grandiose plan 
for a completely new city just to the north of the site

of Chung-tu. Work apparently began about 1268. 
The new city was named Ta-tu (Great capital), or 
Khanbalie (home or the Khan), and was declared to 
be the capital of the Yuan Dynasty in 1272. This was 
the first time that central control over China was 
exercised from what is now Peking. and it was Ta-tu 
that greeted Marco Polo, who lived in the court or 
Kublai Khan and later wrote vividly of the wonders 
of the city. 
The Mongols were overthrown by the Ming Dynasty 
and driven from Ta-tu in 1369. The new dynasty 
stayed in the south at Nanking, which served as its 
capital, and changed the name of Ta-tu to Pei-p'ing 
(northern peace). Pei-pIng became the seat of the 
very ambitious Prince of Yen, the fourth son of the 
founder of the Ming Dynasty. After the death of his 
father, the prince usurped the throne and precipi-
tated a civil war for power, with the south divided 
against his northern rule. After he defeated the south. 
he became the Emperor Yung Lc in 1403. For a few 
years he divided his time between Nanking and 
Pei-Wing, but esentually he decided to move the capi-
tal back to the north, and for this move, he began a 
lengthy and comprehensive reconstruction program 
in Pei-Wing. By 1421 the program was well underway, 
and Yung Lo moved into the new capital, which he 
renamed Peking. 
Peking was the Imperial Capital of China from 1421 
until the end of the Manchu Dynasty in 1912, and it 
served until 1929 as the capital of most of the country 
under the Republic of China. In 1928 the Nationalists 
changed the name of the city back to Pci-p'ing and 
moved the capital to Nanking. Peking became the 
scat of government again in 1949, when it was pro-
claimed capital of the People's Republic of China.

or -alley) compounds, and the Emperor and his retinue 
remained hidden from view in the Forbidden City. 
Foreigners were shocked at the level of filth and 
poverty in Peking, but most of them became fond of 
the city nonetheless, and in the process learned 
to respect the Chinese with whom they came in 
contact. Perhaps more than the Chinese, who were 
mainly deprived of any contacts with the court, 
the foreigners in Peking loved to revel in images 
of the city's past pageantry and splendor. 
S. In June 1879, President Grant visited 
Peking on a round-the-world trip following his 
term of office. Denied a visit with the Boy-
Emperor or entrance to the Forbidden City, the 
former President was received by the Prince-regent 
in the Tartar City. Later, Grant climbed the 
Tartar Wall, just south of the buildings then being 
occupied by the American Legation, for a better 
look at the gracefully sloping roofs of the For-
bidden City. Another former American President, 
Herbert Hoover, became familiar with Peking while 
he served in China as a mining engineer. 
6. The shadow of seclusion that has largely 
hidden Peking since 1949 now appears to be lifting. 
During most of this period only a few selected 
visitors were permitted to take tightly regulated 
tours of the city, and those who were accredited 
to the small diplomatic communities lived an 
almost contemplative existence within their com-
pounds. Visits and travel by outsiders virtually 
ceased during the Cultural Revolution. Sine-that 
time foreigners have been welcomed at an unprec-
edented rate. Travel visas are much easier to 
obtain than formerly, and a sprinkling of tourists 
are now permitted to visit the city. Movement 
within Peking, however, remains carefully controlled. 
7. What do visitors see today in Peking? 
Certainly some of the splendor of the past is 
there, but the destruction of the old city walls, 
the incongruous new buildings and wide streets, 
and the blare of revolutionary propaganda has 
eroded the charisma of the city, which in these

respects seems strangely shorn of oriental mystery. 
Peking resembles any number of other large Asian 
cities, but it has fewer shopping centers, little 
night life, and a drabness that seems almost 
manufactured, "as many of the new buildings, like 
modern antiques, appear old. But the city today 
is cleansed of its filth, and many of the earthy 
street smells of the past are gone. Beneath the 
revolutionary facade, the regime has taken care 
to preserve whatever does not directly clash with 
construction plans for the city, and although some 
of the shrines, palaces, and relics of yesterday 
have disappeared, most of those that remain have 
been restored to their best state of repair since 
the time of the Manchu Dynasty. 
The Geographic Setting  
8. Peking occupies a site on the northern 
edge of the North China Plain, a few miles from 
the mostly barren mountains that wall it in on 
the north and west. An oddity among major cities, 
it is not located along a stream; the major river 
in the area, the Yung-ting Ho, flows across the 
plain a few miles to the west. The city occupies 
a slightly elevated portion of the plain and is 
thus protected from the major floods that have 
historically devastated large areas in this part 
of China. The predominant soils of the area are 
deep, fertile, and of loessial origin. 
9. Although the climate of Peking is usually 
considered healthful or invigorating because of 
its changeability, tourists often complain that 
the weather is too hot, cold, wet, or dusty. 
Nevertheless the city enjoys nice spells, and if 
one stays long enough, he may find the weather 
delightful. While Peking and Washington, D.C., 
are at approximately the same latitude, the former 
is hotter in summer, colder in winter, and does 
not have the equivalent of the US Capital's usually 
long and pleasant spring and autumn. 
10. The longest season, winter, is dry and 
clear, with little snowfall. Cold permeates the 
city, which generally lacks central heating, and

everyone bundles into extra clothing, even when 
indoors. Temperatures at this time of the year 
may drop below 0�F. The ground and vegetation 
dry up, and by late winter, brisk winds begin to 
swirl the Peking dust -- fine yellow loessial 
silt that seeps into everything. Spring finally 
arrives in April, but dust storms are also most 
likely to sweep out of Central Asia at this time 
of the year. Dust control measures involving 
reforestation and the planting of grasslands and 
shelter belts have proven only partially success 
ful, largely because of the widespread nature of 
the storms. Locally, however, some progress has 
been made by planting grass and shrubbery and by 
paving streets. 
11. A pleasant but short spring gives way 
quickly to hot weather, and the normal summer is 
characterized by spells of.oppressive heat inter-
spersed with periods of heavy rainfall. Temperatures 
in the summer occasionally exceed 100�F. Rainfall 
is usually insignificant until June, but seasonal 
distributional patterns and amounts are highly 
vatiable. Sometimes the rains start later in 
summer; worse, in some years, it hardly rains at 
all. Normally, however, the rains begin in June 
and build up to a maximum in July, when almost 40 
percent of the total annual precipitation occurs, 
much of it in downpours associated with violent 
thunderstorms. Most foreigners living in Peking 
prior to 1949 made it a habit to flee the city in 
early summer and to spend as much time as possible 
on the cool wooded slopes of the Western Hills. 
12. Probably the best time of the year to 
visit Peking is late September and early October 
after the summer rains lose their intensity. 
During this short and pleasant period Peking 
remains green and cool, prior to an abrupt tran-
sition into winter.

Overview of the City  
General Plan  
13. When the Communists assumed control of 
Peking in 1949, the slightly tattered city was 
essentially the same Imperial City that served 
the Ming and Manchu Dynasties. Most of it was 
confined within an imposing outer wall-, 
by only 13 gates and a few railroad lines. Inside 
the walls, the city was divided into two main 
sections -- the Tartar City in the north, and the 
Chinese City in the south. This division had its 
crigin during the Mongol period. At that time the 
Chinese were not permitted to live inside the 
walled city, which was reserved for Mongol princes 
and officials. This situation continued even after 
the Ming walls were built. The Chinese town re-
mained outside until 1353, when Emperor Chia

Ching* finally completed the long-planned enclosure 
of the Chinese City. 
14. The Tartar City contained three walled 
enclosures the Imperial City (Huang Ch'eng), 
the Purple Forbidden City (Tzu-chin Ch'eng), and 
the Legation Quarter. The Imperial City, the 
housekeeping organ of the palace and the Govern-
ment, was located in the center of the Tartar City 
and completely enclosed the Forbidden City, the 
seat of the Emperor. High walls and a wide moat 
further insulated the Forbidden City, even within 
the Imperial City. The newest walled division 
within Peking -- the Legation Quarter -- housed 
most of the foreign legations and was built in 
1901 after the Boxer Uprising. The systems of 
walls are now mostly destroyed, and the Forbidden 
City, referred to as the Palace Museum, is the 
only unit that survives intact. 
Suburban Expansion  
15. The buildings and streets of the old 
city are in sharp contrast with those in the newer 
suburbs, although everywhere the street patterns 
are square. In the residential sections of the 
old city the squat, gray, mostly tile-roofed 
buildings are huddled closely together behind 
nondescript walls; in the suburbs, on the other 
hand, buildings are more widely spaced and taller. 
The tremendous suburban growth of Peking has 
apparently followed orderly guidelines. New 
residential, institutional, and governmental 
*Emperors in China had at least three names: a 
personal name, a dynastic reign title, and a 
posthumous name. The personal name was used before 
the ascendency, the reign title during the period 
of rule, and the posthumous name after the death of 
the emperor. Throughout this text, emperors are 
referred to by their best known name -- the reign 
title -- a common practice among western writers.

complexes are generally located either in or 
close to the old city, and new industrial plants 
and agricultural communes are situated in the 
far suburbs. Most universities and research 
and governmental institutions are concentrated 
in the northern and western suburbs -- a planned 
institutional growth that was originally conceived 
in the 1930's. The eastern outskirts are heavily 
industrial, but the largest major industrial 
complex is in the far western suburbs near the 
Shih-ching-shan Iron and Steel Plant along the 
Yung-ting Ho (River). The scope of development 
in the southern suburbs has been relatively limited.

Industry  
16. Industrial growth has placed some emphasis 
on the production of communications and electrical 
equipment, electronics equipment, and advanced 
military weapons. Although industrial development 
has been highly diverse, Peking still ranks con-
siderably below such other industrial centers as 
Shanghai, Mukden, Dairen, Lan-chou, and Wuhan. 
Nevertheless the city is now a significant producer 
of textiles and synthetic fibers, petrochemicals, 
automotive and agricultural equipment, and light 
and heavy machinery. It has a large and growing 
skilled labor force, and its position in most 
enterprises is supported by the presence nf the 
nation's leading technical research facilities and 
personnel.

assigned to large agricultural communes in the

the agricultural advances of China and to experi-

large communes, especially those visited by foreign 
dignitaries, are of the "showcase" variety and 
probably are not typical of those in other sections 
of the country. Impressions of Chinese agriculture 
gained from visits to them could be misleading. 
One commune, for example, features milk cows, a 
rarity in China. 
Transportation  
18. Although Peking is a very busy city, it 
is relatively unencumbered by the traffic jams and 
the usual rush-hour patterns of other major cities, 
mainly because of the lack of privately owned 
automobiles and the absence of a principal central 
business district that would concentrate traffic 
flow toward one sector of the city. Furthermore, 
the distances traveled are reasonably short, and 
most people either walk or use bicycles; workers 
in Peking's factories usually live in dormitories 
or apartments near their work. Still, Peking's

streets are filled with a conglomeration of 
pedestrians and vehicles -- buses, trolleys, and 
bicycles -- and everyone seems to be "on the go." 
Few are idle in this city where even mothers of 
young childen hold full-time jobs, leaving their 
offspring in nurseries during working hours. 
19. The monumental project of today is the 
subway system that will eventually link all of 
the major portions of the enlarged city. The 
first completed segment connects the main rail-
road station in the eastern portion of the old 
city, via 16 subway stations along a 23-kilometer 
route, with the Shih-ching-shan Iron and Steel 
Plant to the west. 
20. The role of Peking as a major trans-
portation center has changed little, except that 
the airplane is now more frequently used for 
intercity passenger travel and the haulage of 
small, light goods. Most intercity transport --
freight and passengex -- is accomplished by train, 
and major railroad lines radiate from the city. 
Although growing in importance, the truck transport 
industry is still in its infancy, there being a lack 
of both good roads and large vehicles. Water 
transport, which was formerly a significant 
carrier of goods into Peking, especially via the 
Grand Canal, is now regaining some of its former 
importance. 
21. There are a number of airfields in the 
Peking area, but most of them are for military 
use. Nearly all civil traffic uses the Peking 
Central Airport (Capital Airport), one of the 
few international airfields in China; it is 
located about 10 miles northeast of the city. 
The Chinese civil airline is growing, but its 
equipment, judged by international standards, is 
outdated. Accordingly, flights are programmed to 
take advantage of good weather and daylight hours.

Two notable water-supply projects completed by 
the Communists are the Yung-ting Ho Aqueduct and 
therPeking--Mi-yun Canal. The Yung-ting Ho Aqueduct 
brings water from an intake dam on the Yung-ting 
River through a combination canal and tunnel along 
a 21-kilometer course. The Peking--Mi-yun Canal 
carries water to Peking from the Mi-yiin Reservoir, 
about 70 kilometers to the northeast on the Ch'ao-pai 
Ho. This wide canal follows a circuitous 110-kilo-
meter route along the base of the mountains to the 
north and west of Peking, and reportedly, it can 
accommodate vessels of up to 1,000 tons. The

completion of both of these very impressive projects 
undoubtedly required tremendous inputs of labor. 
23. Trash is no longer dumped into the 
hu-t'ungs (streets or alleys), which are now 
carefully swept by the inhabitants, whether paved 
or not. Underground sewers have replaced most of 
the large open ditches that in the past drained 
sewage from the residential sections.

The canal passes through a typical small agricultural 
village in the suburbs of Peking. 
24. Air pollution is a concern in Peking, 
but it is much less of a problem here than it is 
elsewhere in cities of comparable size. Industrial 
plants add smoke to the atmosphere, of course, but 
most industries are situated in the eastern and 
southern suburbs, where the prevailing northwesterly 
winds help to move it away from the city. Other

are situated far enough from the city that the 
smoke they generate is dissipated somewhat before 
it can reach Peking. Home heating systems are the 
main polluters of the atmosphere in Peking, where 
practically all heating depends on coal. The smoke 
of home heaters all over the city can contribute 
to the massive pollution of the air during the long 
cold winter. 
Security  
25. Soldiers and military vehicles are in 
evidence on the streets of Peking, but only in 
small numbers. Military installations in the city 
are either so unobstrusive that they warrant little 
attention or they are located in remote suburban 
sites, protected from the scrutiny of visitors. 
Probably the most sensitive military areas are in 
the western suburbs -- the site of important state 
agency and military headquarters. Certainly, the 
Chinese are excessively secretive, and in addition, 
they wish to present only favorable images of their 
country. Thus the movements of visitors in Peking 
have been controlled in an effort to demonstrate 
the economic and sociological advances of the 
regime, while minimizing the flow of intelligence 
to "imperialistic" countries. 
26. Large numbers of military personnel move 
into Peking's streets during visits by prominent 
foreign officials. At these times the street 
corners are well patrolled, and the normally 
light traffic is completely controlled. Since 
1969, Chinese crowds have usually been docile 
and friendly -- responsive to the wishes of the 
Government. Visitors are permitted considerable 
freedom of movement, but only under the watchful 
eyes of helpful guides, who provide translation 
services and act as buffers to minimize visitor 
contact with the Chinese people. Normally, the 
Chinese do not like to be photographed without 
permission.

the Kuo-chi (formerly Grand Hotel des Wagon Lits). 
The Peking has been enlarged and completely 
renovated, but the current status of the Wagon 
Lits is unknown. Most of the recent foreign 
visitors have been accommodated at the Hsin-chiao 
Hotel, located near the southeast corner of the 
old Legation Quarter. The Min-tzu (Nationalities) 
Hotel, on West Ch'ang-an Boulevard, just west of 
the Cultural Palace of the Nationalities, has 
usually been reserved for Afro-Asian visitors. 
The Overseas Chinese Hotel is located northeast of 
the Forbidden City, adjacent to the Museum of Fine 
Arts and the nearby Ho-p'ing (Peace) Hotel. The 
Chien-men, to the west of the Altar of Heaven, is 
the only large hotel in the old Chinese City. Most 
of the smaller hotels, hostels, and guesthouses in. 
the city do not accommodate foreign guests. 
28. Foreign dignitaries are usually accom-
modated in their respective embassies or at one of 
the better government guesthouses. Some of the 
finest guesthouses are located in a parklike 
compound in the western suburbs, just east of 
Yu-yuan T'an, about a mile west of the old city. 
The former site of an Imperial residence known as 
Tiao-yu T'ai (Fishing Terrace), this pleasant, 
secluded compound contains some of the finest 
modern residences in the Peking area, and it has 
been used by only the most distinguished guests. 
Patterns of Life  
29. Living habits among the Chinese in_ 
Peking have changed only moderately, even though 
most of the people may be living in an apartment 
or dormitory for the first time. Facilities are 
crowded, but crowding is accepted by the Chinese, 
who are accustomed to living in small places. 
Family apartments often consist of one room, with 
toilet and kitchen facilities being shared with 
other families. Dormitories usually house four 
people to a room. 
30. Most people still wear blue clothing as 
they always have. While other colors are not un-
common, especially among the women and the young,

all clothing seems to have a unity of style that 
is depressingly austere. Most of the women wear 
pantsuits, which are masculine, pajama-style 
outfits that do little to identify the sex of the 
wearer. Recently, women have been encouraged to 
wear clothing that is more feminine. 
31. Lacking private refrigeration, the 
Chinese buy food on an almost daily basis. They 
make many of their purchases in markets and small 
shops, however, instead of relying on street 
hawkers as they did in the past. The people still 
spend much of their time on the streets, particu-
larly when the weather is good, and peddlers 
continue to hawk their wares, but at a pace that 
is much reduced from that which prevailed when 
practically all the necessities of life could be 
purchased-et the doorstep. The once popular pastime 
of haggling is almost unheard these days, and it 
is hardly needed as food prices are set low by the 
Government. There are no supermarkets or self-
serve stores. 
32. Food in Peking is now in better supply 
than ever before, and beggars and emaciated 
individuals are no longer observed in the streets. 
While eating out is a favorite pastime, the average 
person cannot afford to patronize the better 
restaurants. The Chinese tend to dine in low-
priced cafeterias, and in most neighborhoods small 
food shops offer simple meals at reasonable prices. 
Food stands and tea shops are also popular. For 
those with ample funds, the gustatory delights of 
Peking have not changed. Foreign visitors are 
usually impressed by the variety and quality of 
the food served in Peking restaurants, and are 
amazed by the relatively low prices. 
33. Recreation in Peking now stresses whole-
some athletics, and the illicit pleasures and much 
of the night life of pre-Communist days have 
disappeared. The numerous large sports complexes 
are in almost constant use, and most organizations 
have athletic fields or facilities to accommodate 
workers and students. Calisthenics are engaged in

34. Although the former significance of 
the old Imperial City as home of the Emperor and 
seat of the Government is gone, this section of 
the Tartar City retains its importance. No longer 
existing as an entity, the outlines of the Imperial 
City are nevertheless still traceable. Many of the 
state arid�military offices are located here and 
political control still seems to emanate from this 
quarter of the city. 
35. Almost every tour of Peking begins at 
T'ien-an Men Square, said by the Chinese to be the 
largest square in the world. Comprised of some 
100 acres of granite slabs, it is large enough to 
contain about 75 American football fields. T'ien-an 
Men (Gate of Heavenly Peace), with its portrait of 
Mao Tse-tung, overlooks the square on the north, 
and during the massive parades and celebrations that 
are held here, it serves as a reviewing stand for 
the Party hierarchy. At the south center of the 
square is the Monument to the People's Heroes, a 
pine and cypress park, and a bus station. Flanking 
the square on the west is the National People's 
Congress Building, and on the east is the building 
that contains the Revolutionary and Historical 
Museum. Both of these massive stone buildings 
were completed in a flurry of construction in 1958. 
36. Prior to 1949 the square in front of 
T'ien-an Men was much smaller. At that time it 
was included within an extension of the walls of 
the Forbidden City, the site of the Imperial Palace, 
which it served as an outer courtyard. Behind 
T'ien-an Men, the gracefully curved, yellow-tiled 
roofs of the city peep over the walls, although

three more gates and courtyards bar entrance to 
the former palace of the Emperor. 
37. After the fall of the Manchu Dynasty, 
the walls of the Imperial City were gradually 
removed to facilitate east-west movement, and 
today only the southern wall along Ch'ang-an 
Boulevard remains standing. While the functions 
of the old Imperial City have changed, most of 
the original structures remain, and it is still 
possible to appreciate their relative role in 
Imperial China. 
38. Two parks -- Chung Shan (Sun Yat-sen) and 
People's Cultural Park -- are located just inside 
the walis_of the old Imperial City behind T'ien-an 
Men. Chung Shan Park, also known as Central Park, 
is to the northwest of T'ien-an Men. It was a 
palace playground and the site of the Altar of the 
Earth and Harvests (She-chi T'an). Only the Emperor 
was entitled to sacrifice at this altar, which he 
did on prescribed days in the spring and the autumn. 
Near the entrance of the park is a marble p'ai-lou 
(commemorative archway), on which is inscribed 
characters that transliterate "Kung-li Chan-sing" 
("Right Triumphs Over Might"). This p'ai-lou was 
erected by the Chinese Government in memory of 
Baron Ketteler, a German killed during the Boxer 
Uprising. Following World War I, it was dismantled 
and moved from its original location near the 
Legation Quarter to its present site; at that time 
the new inscription was added. Numerous statues, 
small pavilions, a pedestal to Sun Yat-sen, and a 
roofed, open-air theater are some of the features 
of the park. Shaded walks and peony beds around 
the p'ai-lou attract large numbers of people. 
39. The People's Cultural Park, formerly 
T'ai Miao (Temple of Ancestors), is to the north-
east of T'ien-an Men. Under the Emperors, this 
was the most sacred spot in Peking, except for 
the Altar of Heaven. The spirit tablets (simple 
strips of lacquered wood in which the spirit of 
the departed was supposed to reside) of the 
Emperors and their consorts were kept hare.

Sacrificial ceremonies were performed periodically 
by the Emperors, and homage was paid to the ances-
tors on special occasions, such as weddings or 
coronations. -Years ago, prisoners of war were 
sometimes marched into the courtyard in order that 
they might be viewed by the spirits of the departed 
Emperors. The Temple of Ancestors also contained 
the spirit tablets of important princes, dukes, 
and ministers. Some of the tablets are those of 
Manchu ancestors who were canonized as Emperors 
with posthumous honors. Today the temple is used 
as a place of recreation and amusement, and 
cultural and industrial exhibitions have sometimes 
been held here. Table tennis is often played in 
the buildings. The beautiful gardens and the 
cypress trees add to its general appeal. 
40. A small, man-made hill (Ching Shan or 
Prospect Hill) dominates the northern edge of the 
Forbidden City. This hill has traditionally been 
called Mei Shan (Coal Hill), but during the 
Cultural Revolution, the name was officially 
changed to Red Guard's Park. The hill was con-
structed for geomantic reasons to guard the 
Forbidden City against evil influences that might 
blow in from the north. It is recorded that during 
the Liao Dynasty a large amount of coal and 
charcoal was stored here for emergency use; this 
fuel laid the foundation for the present hill, 
hence the name Coal Hill. Recent excavations have 
not :evealed any evidence to verify the story. 
Ching Shan was a place of rest and recreation for 
the Emperor, and a system of paths leading to five 
pavilions are laid out among the trees on its 
slopes. Until the recent addition of high buildings 
in Peking, Ching Shan provided the best vantage 
point for observation of the city. 
41. On West Ch'ang-an (Hsi-ch'ang-an) 
Boulevard, about 1 kilometer west of T'ien-an Men, 
is a two-story building usually identified as the 
official residence of Mao Tse-tung. This is the 
Hsin-hua Men (Gate of New China), the front 
entrance to what is probably the most beautiful 
part of the Imperial City -- the area around the 
three "seas" (lakes) -- Nan (South), Chung (Central)

originally as a pavilion by Emperor Ch'ien Lung 
for his Mohammedan concubine, known as Hsiang Fei 
(Fragrant Concubine), but more commonly referred 
to as K'o Fei (Stranger Concubine). 
42. Inside the wall, to the north of the 
Hsin-hua Men, the three "seas" provide the setting 
for beautiful buildings that were known in Imperial 
times as the Sea Palaces. This area was a resort 
for most of the Emperors and it served as a source 
of relief from the formalized ceremonial living 
that prevailed inside the walls of the Forbidden 
City. 
43. The lakes date back to the 12th century, 
when one of the Chin Emperors diverted water into 
the Pei Hai (North Sea) from a spring near the 
present Summer Palace. Kublai Khan enlarged the 
lake and the park, built the hill on which the 
White Dogoba (Pai T'a) now stands, and planted 
trees from various parts of the country-so the

hillside would be green throughout the year. The 
Ming Emperor Yung Lo dug out all three lakes and 
added considerably to the parks and buildings. 
Succeeding rulers continued the work, but none was 
as energetic as the Empress-dowager Tz'u Hsi, who 
spent much of her time in the Sea Palaces and 
loved the winter carnivals that were held here. 
44. The areas adjacent to the Central and South 
lakes are traditionally more secluded and restricted 
from public use than the Pei Hai, which is now a 
public park. Most of the Imperial residences and 
audience halls were located around Chung and Nan 
lakes. When the Chinese Republic was founded in 
1912, the area was selected by President Yuan 
Shih-k'ai as his home and executive offices. Later 
presidents and some of the warlords also stayed 
here. Mao Tse-tung's official residence, if not 
in the Hsin-hua Men, is probably somewhere near the 
Nan Hai. Some visitors have been told that Mao 
lives on the Ying T'ai, the island in the middle 
of the Nan Hai. This small compound of beautiful 
Chinese-style buildings was the prison home of 
Manchu Emperor Kuang Hsa during the last years of 
his reign.

. 45. The park and shrines around the Pei Hai 
probably comprise the most popular recreation area 
in the Imperial City. Boating, swimming, ice 
skating, and basketball are among the most common 
sports enjoyed in the park. The long promenades 
and the restaurants and refreshment stands accom-
modate large numbers of people who flock to the 
park on weekends. Some of the shrines and 
pavilions are very old, but most are relatively 
new or have been rebuilt. The White Dogoba dates 
to 1651, when it was built to commemorate the first 
visit to Peking of the Dalai Lama. The wall that 
encloses the Circular City (T'uan Ch'eng) dates to 
1417, but the present buildings were erected in 
1746. The marble arch bridge (Imperial Canal 
Bridge, Yu-ho Ch'iao) that marks the boundary 
between Pei Hai and Chung Hai was built in 1956 
to replace a similar bridge that proved much too 
narrow for the current heavy volume of traffic. 
A very prominent complex of multistoried buildings 
just to the west of Pei Hai Park is occupied by 
the Ministry of National Defense. 
46. On the north side of the road just west 
of the marble Imperial Canal Bridge is the National  
Library (Peking Library); It was built on the old 
site of a temple and of a palace in which the 
Emperor Hung Chih was born in 1486. The library 
is a popular place for study and is the repository 
of many cultural works. 
47. A few blocks west of the library, and on 
the same side of the street, is the land that, leads 
to the North Cathedral (Pei T'ang). On of the last 
relics of the Roman Catholic faith in Peking, it 
is still open to the public. The cathedral was 
originally situated just outside the wall to the 
west of the Central Lake on a site presented to 
the Jesuits in 1693 by Emperor K'ang Hsi. The 
cathedral was closed and demolished in 1827 during 
a period of persecution under the Emperor Tao 
Kuang. The property was given back to the Catholic 
missions in 1860, and a new church was built in 
1867. In 1883, however, Empress-dowager Tz'u Hsi 
moved into her new palaces on the Central Lake and 
objected to the cathedral that overlooked her

residence. Negotiations led the Jesuits to accept 
the present site, well to the northwest of the 
palace, for a new church. The existing cathedral 
was completed. in 1837. 
48. within the Imperial City is the Forbidden  
City, first opened to the public on August 28, 1900, 
after the Boxer Uprising, when the a11ies staged 
a victory parade across the main courtyards. The 
Forbidden City was closed again in 1902 when the 
Emperor resumed his residency. Royal occupation 
of the palaces finally ceased on November 5, 1924, 
when Emperor Hsilan T'ung (Henry P'u-i) was sum-
marily evicted from the palaces by Feng Yu-hsiang, 
the "Christian General." The palaces were later 
opened to the public, and visitors were permitted 
to visit parts of them until 1966, when they were 
closed. Today much of the Forbidden City is open 
again to the public. 
49. The Forbidden City is surrounded by a 
moat 160 feet wide and by walls more than 3-5-feet 
high. Covering a 250-acre expanse in the geo-
graphical center of Peking, it comprised about 
one-sixth of the former Imperial City, which 
housed the administrative and maintenance organi-
zations, graneries, stables, orchards, parks, 
residences of officials and princes, and some of 
the palaces and pleasure gardens of the Emperor. 
50. The fabled magnificence and inaccessi-
bility of the Forbidden City has promoted interest 
in it for centuries, but the palace proves a mild 
disappointment for many visitors. Unquestionably, 
the concept and layout of the palace is very 
impressive, but it is difficult for people today to 
appreciate Imperial accommodations in these some-
what crude buildings. The Palace consists of a 
large number of detached single-storied buildings, 
one behind the other; they are separated by 
British, French, Russian, German, Japanese, and 
Americans.
