 ARGENTINA        I Army Mutineers Challenge Alfonsin
 An Army regiment in Cordoba is harboring an active-duty officer
 who refuses to testify on human rights violations; President
 Alfonsin has ordered military police to arrest the officers
 involved.

 About 17 officer are involved, inc u ing
 some assigned to other III Corps units, and they are supported by
 other officers posted throughout the Army.-According to the press,
 the III Corps commander and other senior military leaders have tried
 unsuccessfully to persuade the mutineers to surrender, forcing
 Alfonsin to direct federal police to cordon off the regiment and to         25X1
 send in Army police to stand by to arrest them on his order0                25X1
 at least three and possibly four            25X1
 additional Army regimental commanders probably have promised to
 grant asylum to officers who refuse to report to civilian courts.)          25X1
 25X1
 25X1
 Thousands rallied outside the National Congress building es
 to denounce the military's actions. Alfonsin and other political leaders
 may travel to Cordoba to deal directly with the mutineers.
 Comment: This first instance of overt defiance of judicial authority by
 an active-duty officer challenges both the civilian leadership and the
 military high command. The rebellious officers probably hope to force
 Alfonsin to end the human rights trials by declaring an amnesty for
 military personnel. The President, however, will be reluctant to make
 such a politically unpopular move before the Congressional elections
 in September unless he has legislative backing from both his own
 party and the Peronist opposition
 Declaration of a state of siege endorsed by Congress, however, would
 send a strong signal to the military that the Alfonsin administration
 enjoys broad support and that the mutineers would be politically
 isolated if they move against the government. Alfonsin probably
 would prefer a peaceful settlement rather than resorting to force, but
 he may have to act quickly to prevent other Army units fro
 similar actions and to preserve the government's authority

 Comment: The Chinese Foreign Ministry official's reference to new
 patrolling-and lack of interest in immediate negotiations-suggests
 that Beijing may move to increase tensions. The departure of the
 Chinese Ambassador from New Delhi at this time sends another
 signal of rising tensions, but the intention to send a border expert

 Beijing may choose to begin aggressively patrolling Indian-controlled
 areas near the Chinese outpost on Wangdung Ridge. This probably
 would be intended to draw Indian troops into a provocation that
 China could use to portray India as the aggressor and to demonstrate

 hostilities are possible if a peaceful solution is not found. There is no
 evidence of any troop movements to reinforce its exposed position in
 the disputed sector, where Chinese forces are badly outnumbered,
 and Beijing is unlikely to provoke hostilities without being ready to
 cope with Indian retaliation. Forces garrisoned in the area are not
 sufficient to counter a large Indian response, and it would take
 approximately three weeks to move additional forces into the region,
 not including acclimatization of the troops to the high altitude. Any
 hostilities before the summer monsoons are therefore unlikely. If
 Beijing chooses to increase patrolling, it would send a signal that New
 Delhi might regard as provocative but would "t necessaril
 a deliberate effort to precipitate an incident.

 KUWAIT: Progress Toward Protecting Shipping
 The Kuwait Oil Tanker Company is moving rapidly to implement its
 plan to protect shipping in the Persian Gulf. According to the US
 Embassy, an initial inspection of the three ships that will be put under
 the US flag identified few problems
 China will probably provide one to three tankers as a token gesture.
 France has no tankers available to lease and does not want Kuwaiti
 ships under the French flag.
 Comment: Kuwait is eager to finish the reflagging inspections. It
 probably expects the US to overlook minor deficiencies in the Kuwaiti
 ships. Although local officials were hopeful that all five permanent UN
 Security Council members would participate directly in protecting
 Gulf shipping, the absence of France will not impede Kuwait's
 strategy. Kuwait has agreed to lease three ships from the USSR; a
 similar agreement with the UK is being negotiated. US offers of
 assistance continue to win praise from Gulf leaders

 Foreign Minister Shevardnadze told Soviet party members in East
 Berlin last month                                  Moscow's 25X1
 international prestige would suffer unless the Soviet presence in
 Afghanistan were reduced in the near future. He said that Soviet
 military involvement was costly and that troops should be withdrawn,
 but only after Soviet civilian advisers had been recalled to allow the
 Kabul government to become more independent. He claimed Moscow
 would agree to the establishment of a neutral Afghanistan.
 Comment: Shevardnadze's remarks accord with many recent
 statements by Soviet officials that Moscow is increasingly concerned
 about the various costs of involvement in Afghanistan and intends to
 end or reduce it. He and other Soviets, however, have told Pakistan
 and the US that any political compromise will have to be built around
 the current regime and that, without such a settlement, the Soviets
 will stay the course. The Kabul regime would be unable to survive a
 Soviet withdrawal in the near term

 MAURITANIA-MOROCCO: Friction Growing
 The dispute over Western Sahara may lead to a-realignment of
 Mauritania's foreign policy and the fall of President Tava.
 25X1
 25X1
 The US Embassy in Nouakchott says senior Mauritanian 25X1
 officials are concerned that Morocco will try to occupy the Western
 Saharan town of Guera, currently held by Mauritanian troops.
 Nouakchott says it will use force to resist Moroccan encroachments.
 Comment: Taya's two-year-old regime had favored Morocco rather
 than the Algerian-backed Polisario guerrillas challenging Rabat for
 control of Western Sahara. An attempt by Morocco to seize Guera,
 which is near Mauritania's principal economic center of Nouadibou,
 might force Taya to seek military support from Algeria and the
 Polisario. Mauritania has no capability to confront Morocco militarily.
 POLAND: Shakeup in Leadership
 Warsaw announced yesteFday several leadership changes intended to
 revitalize its stalled economic reform program. Zdzislaw Sadowski,
 chairman of an important economic advisory commission, replaced
 Zbigniew Gertych as Deputy Premier. Janusz Pawlowski was named
 to succeed labor minister Stanislaw Gebala, and Aleksander
 Legatowicz, who is not a Communist Party member, was appointed to
 the State Council. Both Sadowski and Legatowicz are members of the
 Social Consultative Council, an advisory body created by General
 Jaruzelski last year to air alternative views.
 Comment: Sadowski, the new Deputy Premier, is a longtime
 proponent of reform who earlier this month announced broad new
 reform proposals being considered by the regime. He was brought in
 to overcome resistance to reforms within the Council of Ministers. In
 appointing Legatowicz-a leading lay Catholic activist-Jaruzelski is
 the first Bloc leader to heed Soviet General Secretary Gorbachev's
 injunction to appoint competent people irrespective of party
 membership. The appointment of Sadowski and Legatowicz to top
 policymaking positions increases the legitimacy and influence of the
 Consultative Council. Legatowicz's elevation may also be a further
 signal of the regime's willingness to entertain the Catholic Church's
 calls to broaden the political dialogue; it could serve to isolate
 opposition figures not willing to work within the system

 CHINA-UK-HONG KONG: Harsh Words From Deng
 Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping yesterday cautioned the joint
 Y",
 Chinese-Hong Kong committee, which is drafting Hong Kong's future
 constitution, that any move toward greater democracy in Hong Kong
 should be implemented gradually to ensure stability. Qualifying
 Beijing's earlier pledge not to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs,
 Deng asserted that China would reserve the right to intervene in
 certain unspecified matters. The current meeting of the constitution
 committee in Beijing is focusing on which Chinese laws will apply to
 Hong Kong after 1997, a subject of controversy in the territory.            25X1
 Comment: Deng probably wants to warn the British to move
 cautiously with their plans to introduce greater democracy. Beijing
 views such plans, which are expected to be announced next month,
 as interference in the drafting of the constitution. Although Deng
 affirmed that Hong Kong would retain its current political and
 economic system, perhaps even beyond the 50 years guaranteed in
 the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, his statement implying
 possible Chinese interference may create new unease in Hong Kong's

 GREECE-TURKEY:      Tension Over the Aegean
 Greece and Turkey, shaken by their brush with war last month
 over mutual misperceptions about exploration for oil in disputed
 Aegean waters, are taking steps to tone down their rhetoric and
 to improve communication. Prospects for a solution to the
 emotional and complex dispute, however, remain slim. The
 recent f/areup underscores the vulnerability of US and NATO
 bases in the region to Greek-Turkish rivalries.
 Greek and Turkish intransigence regarding their Aegean and Cyprus
 disputes is such that the possibility of a miscalculation leading to
 conflict is always present. The risks may even be increasing; although
 the relationship has been marked for years by alternating periods of
 crisis and relative calm, tensions have remained high since last
 summer. The main issues over the past year have been the
 delineation of the continental shelf, continued militarization of the
 Greek island of Limnos, designation of air corridors, normalization of
 Turkish-EC relations and modernization of Turkish tanks on Cyprus.
 Greek Prime Minister Papandreou rejects the Turkish demand that
 Aegean issues be settled in bilateral talks; Ankara is equally set
 against the Greek proposal to submit the dispute to the International
 Court of Justice. An ostensible agreement in the 1970s that tried to
 combine these approaches foundered because the Greeks wanted to
 discuss only terms of reference for submitting the issue to the Court
 while the Turks wanted a bilateral accord that the Court would
 essentially ratify
 The recent crisis has led to mildly encouraging exchanges between
 Turkish Prime Minister Ozal and Papandreou about international
 adjudication, but without substantial outside pressure the talks
 probably will quickly grind to a halt. Already, hardliners in Ankara
 appear to be backing down from Ozal's offer to go to the Court, while
 Papandreou is again hinting strongly that any dialogue must be
 limited to drawin u terms of reference for international
 adjudication

 The Aegean Dispute
 Greece argues that history, precedent, and its possession of about 2,800 Aegean islands
 entitle it to the lion's share of sea, air, and continental shelf rights in the Aegean. Athens finds
 support for its claims in the 1958 and 1983 Law of the Sea Conventions, which enshrine the
 principles that nations have a right to a 12-mile territorial sea and that islands have a
 continental shelf. The Greeks' main fear, in addition to being deprived of the shelf's presumed
 resources, is that Turkey would eventually parlay any rights to the shelf beneath Greek islands
 into limits on Greek sovereignty. The Turks contend that the eastern half of the Aegean shelf
 is a natural prolongation of the Turkish mainland and that a 12-mile territorial sea around
 Greek islands would effectively cut off the Turkish Aegean coast from the high seas.
 Both sides can find ample legal basis to defend their positions credibly, but the Greeks believe
 that the general thrust of existing law favors them, and they have therefore continued to insist
 on international adjudication. The Turks have favored trying to resolve the case bilaterally,
 presumably because they fear they would be shortchanged by the International Court.

 Top Secret
 Turkey's application to the EC may provide the next flashpoint in
 Aegean relations. Papandreou will doubtless use the threat of
 blocking Turkey's entry into the EC-which is frought with difficulties
 even without Greece's opposition-to press Ankara for agreement to
 international adjudication or other major concessions. Ozal may have
 broached the idea of going to the Court as a maneuver in preparation
 for Ankara's EC bid. The combination of domestic political pressures
 and the two sides' inherent inflexibility, however, may lead them to
 another major confrontation, particularly if the Turks see Athens as
 the sole obstacle to EC membership.
 Implications for the US and NATO
 Athens apparently still wants to negotiate a new base agreement to
 replace the one expiring next year, but Papandreou's distrust of the
 US executive branch and the latest Greek-Turkish flareup will incline
 Athens to take a particularly tough line on control of the bases and of
 US activities on them. Moreover, the Greeks will probably insist on
 explicit assurances by the US to maintain the military balance in the
 region and on a substantial increase in aid to guard against US
 circumvention of the traditional, Congressionally mandated
 7-to-10 ratio of US military assistance to Greece and Turkey,
 respectively
 Ankara, meanwhile, has responded to growing domestic outrage over
 US Congressional efforts to cut back and to condition aid to Turkey
 by suspending implementation of the recently renewed defense
 cooperation agreement- pending an "improvement" in relations.
 This decision will not affect the current level of US military operations
 in Turkey, but, if Ankara believes the US has not sufficiently
 addressed its concerns, it might lead to the blocking of further
 military cooperation as provided in the new accord or ultimately to its
 renegotiation

 CHAD-FRANCE:         Continued Military Dependence
 N'Djamena remains dependent on massive US and French
 assistance in its effort to drive the Libyans out of Chad, despite
 the bonanza of Libyan equipment recently captured. Supply lines
 are lengthening as the action moves farther north, and foreign
 material and logistic support-crucial to Chadian victories at
 Fada and Oaudi Doum-will become critical as Chad begins its
 offensive to recapture the Tibesti region and the Aozou Strip.
 Nearly all of Chad's military budget comes from external sources, and
 combat, severe environmental conditions, and long supply routes
 take a heavy toll on N'Djamena's equipment, sustaining the demand
 for more. The US Embassy reports that Chad needs additional heavy
 trucks, spare parts, technical services, ammunition, and fuel to
 conduct operations in Tibesti and to preserve gains in the north.
 France delivered to Chad almost $82 million worth of equipment and
 supplies, including antitank weapons and transport vehicles, before
 the attack on Oaudi Doum. France continues to maintain bases at Bir
 Kalait and Abeche that provide mechanical and medical services to
 Chadians at the front. French technicians
 equipment,
 N'Djamena will be able to use some of the vehicles, ammunition, and
 light arms left by the retreating Libyans,
 that the government lacks the support facilities, trained
 personnel, ammunition, and spare parts to take advantage of
 captured armor. Chad hopes to move the Libyan tanks and armored
 cars to N'Djamena for display and to defend strategic points in the
 capital, according to the defense attache, and may seek training from
 Egypt and Iraq
 Chad will become increasingly dependent on French logistic support
 during the planned offensive in Tibesti. The French were heavily
 involved in rapidly airlifting equipment, fuel, and supplies to Chadian
 bases along the 16th parallel before the attacks on Fada and Oaudi
 Doum. Chad's new US-supplied C-130 transport aircraft will give it
 only limited airborne resupply capabilities, and the French may
 increase resupply sorties to Siltou-a Chadian convoy staging area
 144 miles (90 kilometers) above the 16th parallel. Despite his heavy
 dependence on the French, Habre appears determined to proceed
 with his planned offensive to take Aozou, even though French
 opposition to such a move may slow resupply and push back his
 timetable for a full-scale offensive

 SOUTH KOREA:         New Focus on Succession
 South Korea's President Chun appears to be linking his abrupt
 abandonment of constitutional revision to public efforts to
 suggest that ruling party chairman Roh Tae Woo will succeed
 him, but informed opinion in Seoul is skeptical that Chun has
 settled on a successor. Opposition politicians are obviously off
 balance because of Chun's postponement of constitutional
 reform, but security officials and other Korean observers believe
 his action has increased the chance of organized protests this
 spring. Progovernment media efforts to portray US support for
 Chun'                     hat any protests will have an anti-US
 cast.
 The press is giving wide play to Chun's commitment to make other
 "reforms," including changes in the election law and the basic press
 law, and to hold a convention of the ruling party in June to select
 a presidential candidate, but many in Chun's camp and in the
 opposition remain deeply skeptical of his intentions. Some members
 of the ruling party have told the US Embassy that Chun's haste in
 taking action may scuttle Roh's chances, despite stories in the
 progovernment press promoting Roh as a "shoo-in" to succeed
 Chun.
 The manner in which Chun scrapped constitutional revision has
 reinforced these doubts
 contacts of the Embassy report Chun's decision to act now was
 closely held. Only a few around Chun-not including Roh-evidently
 were privy to his thinking,
 If Chun wants to maintain political influence after 1988, electing a new
 president under the current Constitution would make it more difficult
 for him to do so. Without a declaration by the new president that he
 would serve a shortened term, the new leader would serve seven
 years and wield virtually unfettered authority. Under those
 circumstances, Roh's personal following in the military and his
 reputation as a leader would make him less attractive to Chun than
 other choices such as Prime Minister Lho Shin Yong, who is
 susceptible to manipulation by Chun.

 Zeroing in on the Opposition's Disarray
 The breakup of the main South Korean opposition party last week
 appears to have accelerated the timing of Chun's move. According to
 the Embassy, many South Koreans view Chun's action as a step to
 prevent opposition leaders Kim Young Sam and
 using constitutional revision to rally their forces.                        25X1
 the government is trying to hinder the new party's efforts       25X1,
 to organize by harassing the party's members and by attempting to
 undercut Kim Young Sam through public smears.                               25X1
 Chun's decision was accompanied by an intensified crackdown on his
 opponents, including the "indefinite" house arrest of Kim Dae Jung,
 which has isolated him from virtually all outsiders. Press reports say
 the government is again arresting dissidents and has ordered riot
 police to prevent demonstrations
 Internal squabbling in the new opposition party is aiding the
 government's efforts.
 backers of Kim Dae Jung are clashing with Kim Young Sam's more
 moderate faction over whether to admit dissidents groups into the
 new party
 Public reaction to Chun's move-including a thinly veiled rebuke
 by Catholic prelate Cardinal Kim-suggests there will be more
 antigovernment activities. The US Consul in Pusan reports the move
 will probably increase the turnout at coming student protests. The
 security services are worried about the potential for domestic turmoil.
 The government's attempt to suggest that the US supported Chun's
 decision seems likely to aggravate anti-US sentiments. The Consulate
 in Pusan reports dissident activists and radical students have voiced
 suspicion of Washington's role. The new opposition party is likely to
 shy away from a strategy that centers on street rallies, fearing its
 vulnerability to charges by the government that it was responsible for
 clashes between protesters and riot police.
