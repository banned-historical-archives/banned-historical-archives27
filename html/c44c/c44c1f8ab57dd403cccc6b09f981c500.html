 INDOCHINA
 Western press reports detailing instances of direct U.S. air
 ?               support to Cambodian ground troops prompt.a flurry of
 VietnamesN .?ommunist.comment, including articles in the army
 paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN on the 7th and in the party paper
 NHAN DAN on the 8th.  Commentators say that this has exposed
 the President's "hypocrisy" in declaring in his 30 June
 report on the U.S. operations in Cambodia that U.S. air strikes
 would be continued only to interdict communist supply lines.
 Maintaining the fiction regarding the Vietnamese communist
 i.ole in Cambodia, Hanoi says that by "communists" the United
 States means the "Cambodian patriotic armed forces."
 Peking's NCNA briefly reports the Hanoi press commentaries,
 stressing direct air support and ignoring the issue of
 interdicting supply lines.  Moscow follows Hanoi's lead in
 deploring the air action as a further indication of U.S.
 intent to pursue the war.
 The first session of the Paris.talks attended by Ambassador
 Bruce--on 6 August--was marked by the usual diatribes against
 U.S. "aggression" and obstruction of a peaceful settlement.
 The communist delegates also reviewed evidences of their
 "goodwill" since the bilateral talks started in May 1968 and
 denigrated--without detailing---the proposals advanced by
 the United States and Saigon.
 Peking continues to publicize. Sihanouk statements, and on
 9 August NCNA releases his "open.letter to kings, heads
 of state, and heads of government of nonaligned countries."
 Not yet available in its entirety, the letter reviews the
 provisions of the Cambodian constitution to prove the
 illegality of Sihanouk's overthrow and of his replacement with
 the new regime.
 Peking again publicizes criticism of the USSR for its failure
 to recognize Sihanouk's government, in a 10 August NCNA
 summary of an article in a Japanese leftist monthly.  Moscow
 for its part continues its routine-level polemic, answering
 Peking's charges of U.S.-Soviet collusion with countercharges
 of Sino-U.S. coll.'tsion.

 12 AUGUST 1970
 Vietnam--repeated on the 8th--says that despite Western press
 reports of direct U.S. air support for the Cambodians, the
 Nixon Administration continues to insist that U.S. planes
 "attack only the supply routes and concentrations of
 communist troops--that is, the Cambodian liberation troops--
 who might become a menace for U.S. and allied troops--that
 is, satellite troops in South Vietnam."  The broadcast then
 juxtaposes reiterations by White House and Pentagon spokes-
 men that the air strikes are aimed at interdicting supply
 lines  to  press accounts, including AP's report of the
 5 August battle near Skoun, and quotes officers on the
 scene as confirming that the air strikes are directly
 supporting the ground troops.*
 The Hanoi broadcast cites REUTERS for the report that Defense
 Secretary Laird at his 6 August press conference "was forced
 to admit" that U.S. planes r' port the Lon Nol "puppet troops."
 It goes on to say that he argued that the strikes are protect-
 ing ordinary people, and that when asked about direct support
 of Cambodian troops "he was embarrassed and nonsensically said
 that these flight missions were being carried out in accordance
 with the battlefield commanders' decisions."  A brief reference
 to Laird's press conference along similar lines also appears
 in a 7 August Hanoi English-language broadcast.
 Western press reports giving eyewitness accounts of direct
 U.S. air support are also reviewed in a QUAN DOI NHAN DAN
 article, broadcast in Hanoi radio's domestic service on the
 7th, and in a NHAN DAN article, carried by VNA on the 8th.
 The army paper echoes the Hanoi broadcast earlier that day
 in recalling the U.S. guidelines that the air strikes are
 aimed at interdicting communist supplies and troops.  And it
 also maintains the fiction. regarding the Vietnamese communist
 role in Cambodia by inserting the editorial explanation that
 "communist troops" means "Cambodian patriotic armed forces."
 NHAN DAN, on the other hand, merely refers to "air interdiction
 missions" aimed at "protecting U.S. forces in South Vietnam."
 NHAN DAN also explicitly recalls that the guidelines had been
 *  Comment before the 30 June withdrawal of U.S. ground forces
 from Cambodia suggested that the U.S. air strikes were aimed at
 "shoring up" the Lon Ncl regime.  In July there were more charges
 of air attacks and, at least .once, Hanoi cited Western reports of
 U.S. air support fcr troops as refuting U,S. claims that air
 strikes were limited to supply routes.   (See 22 July TRENDS, p. 13.)

 enunciated by President Nixon in his 30 June report, on the
 withdrawal of U.S. ground troops from Cambodia, but the army
 paper does not mention the President's report.
 The party paper quotes Senator Mansfield as saying that the
 sending of aircraft to support the Fhnom Penh administration
 would result in an ".allsided war."  And it goes on to say-that
 the fact that "Nixon has gone back on his 30 June statement
 by ordering brazen bombing and strafing of the Cambodian
 territory once again evidences the U.S. criminal policy of
 aggression" against Cambodia.
 Both NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI PHAN DAN insist that U.S. support
 cannot save the Lon Nol "clique" from defeat, but the army.paper
 is more explicit in documenting this claim.  It cites as an
 example of U.S. air ineffectiveness the fighting around the
 city of Skoun, Kompong Cham Province, where government forces
 allegedly still sustained high casualties and ?led in spite of
 American air support.
 Liberation Radio commentaries on the 6th and 8th commented on
 U.,3. air action in Cambodia. in routine terms, like Hanoi
 referring to "daily" B-52 and other air strikes and saying
 that this would not help the Lon Nol "puppets."  Apparently
 the first reaction to the recent flurry of news reports and
 Administration spokesmen's statements about direct support
 comes in a commentary on the 9th entitled "Nixon's New Trick.
 Is Exposed."  It makes a passing.reference to Secretary Laird's
 press conference on the 6th, saying that he "admitted that U.S.
 aircraf-,; have bombed in support.of Lon Nc1. troops but that this
 support is but indirect, and that U.S. p,.icy toward Cambodia
 will not change."
 PEKING     On 1.0 August, Peking's NCNA carries accounts of the
 NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI.NHAN DAN commentaries.on
 direct U.S. air support for the.Cambodi,~,:, forces.  NCNA notes
 that the party paper ci.ted Western.press reports that large
 numbers of aircraft have been dispatched, and that this is
 another "escalation" of the war, but it ignores NHAN DAr's
 reference to the President's 30 June exrlanation.tLat U.S..air
 strikes would be used for interdiction of-communist supply.lines.
 The only known Peking acknowledgment of the President's
 reference to interdiction came in an NCNA commentary on 3 July,
 it that distorted his remarks when it reported that he said "air
 interdiction would be continued. against the Cambodian Liberation
 Army struggling against the rightist clique."

 12 AUGUST 1970
 Peking's only other attention to the U.S. strikes comes in an
 NCNA dispatch on the 11th which condemns the U.S. "escalation."
 This item similarly ignores the controversy between reporters
 and Administration spokesmen on the nature of the strikes.
 MOSCOW     Soviet media first note reports of direct U.S.
 air support for Phnom Penh troops on 4 August,
 when TASS cites the French CP of-gan L'HUMANITE as quoting a
 Cambodian colonel as saying the.t American planes had been
 supporting Cambodian troops fo'c a week.  The L'HUMANITE
 item added that this is occurring "despite the fact that
 President Nixon had assured the American public that the
 American Air Force would not provide cover to the Saigon
 army and the Phnom Penh troops in Cambodia."  However, neither
 this nor subsequent items recalls the President's statement on
 interdiction of communist supply lines.*
 On the 5th TASS reports that White House spokesman Ziegler
 the day before said that American aircraft "make raids on
 Cambodian territory" but that U.S. policy has "remained
 unchanged," since on 30 June the President said that the
 United States would carry out "air operations" in Cambodia.
 TASS notes that Pentagon spokesman Friedheim said that
 American planes "'sometimes' help Phnom Penh and Saigon troops
 in their military operations," and says that this "actually
 confirmed" reports by American news service that U.S..planes
 have raided the Kirirom area for over a week.  And a 6 August
 IZVESTIYA article says that although Washington has been
 trying to cover up the fact that U.S. planes continue "barbaric
 bombing" of Cambodia, Ziegler, confronted with "irrefutable
 facts," "cynically declared that there was no change of policy."
 On the 7th TASS reports Secretary Laird's press conference of
 the previous day, asserting that he "admitted" that the United
 States is waging an "air war" in Cambodia, "confirming" press
 reports that the United States is "rendering active assistance"
 to the Phnom Penh troops when he said that the bombing raids
 are "of use" to those troops.
 r  Moscow propaganda has generally avoided reference to air
 interdiction in commenting on Presidential statements.  React-
 ing to the President's 30 June report, commentators cited him
 as saying that "bombing raids," "air raids," or "air operations"
 over "Cambodian territory" would continue.

 Other reports also stress that the air operations mean an
 extension of the war.  On the 5th.TASS cites the New York
 POST as saying that there are all indications;tnat'the
 United States is conducting in Cambodia a "secret aerial
 war similar to that waged in Laos," and another TASS report
 that day cites Senator Mansfield-as expressing alarm over
 the air support, saying that it could lead to U.S. involve-
 ment in a "new full-scale war."
 VNA SAYS AMBASSADOR BRUCE "REHASHED OLD ALLEGATIONS" P..T PARIS
 The VNA account treats Ambassador Bruce's debut statement at
 the 78th session of the Paris talks on 6 August in typical
 cryptic fashion, and interjects rebuttals of his remarks.
 Observing that Bruce "rehashed shopworn allegations of the
 U.S. President" and said that Nixon wanted to solve the c
 conflict through negotiations, VNA adds that "as everybody
 knows, Nixon is going ahead with his policy of prolonging
 the war of aggression in Vietnam and expa'.iding the war to the
 whole of Indochina. in the hope of securi?,a a military victory."
 VNA says that Bruce "claimed" the United States wants the
 South Vietnamese people to determine their own future, and
 comments that "as everybody knows," it is the United States
 and nobody eloe that has undermined the South Vietnamese
 people's right to self-determination.  After reporting that
 Bruce "evoked the question of 'troop withdrawal,'" VNA
 remarks that he did not touch on "the South Vietnamese and
 world peoples' demand" for an end to the U.S. "aggression"
 and a rapid, total, and unconditional U.S. troop withdrawal.
 VNA fails to report, among other things, Bruce's urging that
 an effort be made to narrow the differences between the two
 sides' proposals, and that both sides take another look at
 each other's positions; neither does the account acknowledge
 his remark that the "central issues" a'e troop withdrawal,
 political settlement, and -drisoners of war.
 VNA dismisses the statement of GVN delegate Pham Dang Lam--
 who spoke first at the session--with the remark that he "again
 took up the fallacious allegation" made at the previous
 sessions concerning the "'re-establishment of the DMZ,'
 'mutual troop withdrawal,' free elections organized by the
 Saigon puppets and so on."

 COMMUNIST      Both PRG delegate Nguyen Van Tien and the DRV's
 SPEECHES       Nguyen Minh Vy delivered lengthy, polemical
 statements discussing the origins of the war,
 reviewing the various communist proposals, questioning U.S.
 sincerity, and charging U.S. escalation and spread of the war
 to all Indochina.
 The PRG delegate's statement--which Liberation Radio broadcast in
 full on 10 August'--recalls the NFLSV 10-point solution and its
 basic provisions, namely, a U.S. troop withdrawal and the
 establishment of a provisional coalition government.  Nguyen
 Van Tien also recalled the PRG proposal--first advanced last
 December--that if the United States agrees to unconditionally
 withdraw its troops within six months, then the parties will
 discuss measures concerning the safety of the withdrawing
 troops.  Tien added that had the United States engaged in
 serious negotiations and- responded seriously to the 10-point
 solution, peace would have been restored in Vietnam, "or at
 least this conference would have made a long step forward."
 Tien reiterated the standard charge that the United States is
 seeking a position of strength on the battlefield and at the
 conference table.  And he claimed that President Nixon's
 eight-point program and President Thieu's political solution
 stand "simply aoil down to schemes aimed at maintaining
 American neocolonialist domination over South Vietnam."
 He added that "they contain absurd and arrogant demands we
 have severely criticized and rejected many times."
 The VNA report of DRV delegate Nguyen Minh Vy's statement
 notes that he explained "why" the Paris talks were stalemated
 and "why" the United States is prolonging the war in South
 Vietnam and extending it throughout all Indochina, but it
 does not report his de?cailed.argumentation in this regard.
 In noting that Vy charged the Nixon Administration with
 stubbornly rejecting the DRV-PRG demands for settlement, the
 account fails to report h?is critique of the allied settle-
 ment position.  Thus, it ignores his saying that since the
 onset of the talks, the United States has insistently maintained
 *  In the past three months Front media attention to the
 sessions has been confined to brief LPA summaries of the PRG
 statement.  Prior to that Liberation Radio had usually broad-

 session.

 its "arrogant" demand for a mutual troop withdrawal, "although
 termed as 'mutual withdrawal of-all external forces' or
 'withdrawal of all non-South Vietnamese forces.'"
 VNA also omits Vy's remarks.on the manifestations of goodwill
 of the DRV and PRG in getting the bilateral May 1968 talks
 started and in solving the procedural matters so.that the
 present four-party talks got under way.  VNA does report Vy's
 urging that the Nixon Administration change its policy and
 respond seriously to the NFLSV/PRG 10-point solution, but
 it ignores his lengthy exposition of the 10 points.

 PRESS CONFERENCE       President Nixon's 30 July press. conference
 remarks opposing a coalition government,
 be it negotiated or imposed, along the lines of earlier
 propaganda.  For example, PRG delegate Tien said the President's
 remarks again disclosed "more. clearly his obduracy" in opposing
 the Vietnamese people's demands, and that his reaffirmation of
 the non-negotiability of the South Vietnamese people's right
 to self-determination is "simply a signboard" to avoid
 renouncing the GVN and engage in serious negotiations for a
 correct political solution.
 MOSCOW SCORES U.S. "REJECTION" OF COALITION, BRUCE STATEMENT
 Commentator Yuriy Zhukov, writing in PRAVDA on 6 August, makes
 the first substantial comment on President Nixon's 30 July
 press conference remarks on the issue of a coalition. government.
 Zhukov cites the President's remarks that.Thieu's position
 concerning talks "fully corresponds with ours" and that "we
 are against a coalition, government whether  it  is created
 through talks or imposed," and goes on to note that Nixon
 sent Ambassador Bruce to Saigon to make sure that there
 would be no divergences , in positions at the Paris talks.
 Zhukov observes that the President's stand is harder than
 that taken by Secretary Rogers on 13 July when, speaking in
 a "completely different tone," Rogers said that     United
 States holds "an extremely flexible - position" an,    "ready
 to do everything we can in the course of the talks" to end
 the war.  Zhukov further cites an AP commentator on 23 July
 as recalling that Rogers stated that the communists could

 power in the country.*  Zhukov says that people in Washington are
 waiting with interest to see if the President will support his
 Secretary of.State or Thieu and adds. that Thieu's position is the
 position of the American generals in Saigon, of the Pentagon, and
 of the White House itself.  In this connection he quotes Washington
 POST commentator Marder and New York TIMES commentator Smith as
 asserting that the press conference shows that the U.S. position
 has become "more rigid."**
 A panelist in the 9 August domestic service roundtable discussion
 comments similarly and briefly refers to subsequent efforts in
 Washington to mute the thrust of the President's remarks.  The
 commentator says that no sooner had "one American source"
 mentioned the possibility of "forming a coalition government
 removing from the scene the odious puppet figures," than the
 White House denied it, the President in his press conference
 giving "special emphasis" to opposition to a coalition govern-
 ment.  The commentator adds that subsequently "observers" in
 Washington began to assert that the President "had not intended
 to say this," the Washington POST asserting that Ambassador
 Bruce "had some new proposal to make."  But he notes that Bruce
 himself said that his presence "will not open a, new phase,"
 but will simply be a "continuation."
 BRUCE IN    Routine-level radio comment on Ambassador Bruce's
 PARIS       participation in the 6 August session of the Paris
 talks takes him to task for offering nothing new
 in spite of the U.S. effort to portray his presence as a
 demonstration of a desire for a peace settlement.  Commentators
 say that he merely restated the U.S. Government's position as it
 Moscow propaganda is not known to have previously acknowledged
 such remarks.  The 15 and 16 July TASS reports of Rogers' comments
 upon his return from Asia, for example, reported only remarks to
 the effect that the end of the war was not near and that the
 United States was trying to get its allies to assist the Phnom
 Penh regime.
 **  Moscow media have not reported the substance of a Kosygin
 interview with the editor of the Indian paper PATRIOT in which,
 according to a brief AFP report on the 10th, Kosygin criticized
 the United States for rejecting the "Just proposal" to create
 a coalition government, calling this "a step back from the
 previous U.S. position."

 had been stated by President Nixon in his 30 July press
 conference--expressing unwillingness to withdraw troops,
 to stop-all military operations, and to agree to a coalition
 government.  A 9 August PRAVDA article says without
 elaboration that the session showed that not only has
 nothing changed but that the U.S. position has ber:ome "even

 PEKING, MOSCOW TRADE CHARGES ON INDOCHINA POLICIES
 PEKING     Peking currently does not originate comment critical
 of Soviet policies on Indochina.  But on 10 August
 NCNA in Chinese summarizes an article in the July issue of a
 leftist Japanese monthly MAO TSETUNG THOUGHT which attacks the
 Soviet stand with regard to U.S. aggression in Indochina a
 the revival of "Japanese militarism."  It includes the
 assertion that the Soviet "revisionist" government's failure
 to recognize Sihanouk's government and its maintenance of
 diplomatic relations with the Lon Nol regime is "absurd."
 Peking has previously picked up third-party criticism of the
 USSR for failing to recognize the Sihanouk government; the
 first instance was a 10 May NCNA report of a statement by
 the Burmese CP.  On its own authority Peking has not gone
 further than implicitly criticizing the Soviet Union by
 pointedly noting the number of regimes which recognized the
 government--as Mao Tse-tung did in his 20 May statement.
 The article in the Japanese organ, as reported by NCNA,
 also attacks th'.:i USSR for having proposed through its UN
 representative "the convening of a new Geneva conference."
 It notes tha,%; 1 is proposal was later "withdrawn," but
 points to Soviet-Japanese "accord" when it juxtaposes a
 reference to the subsequent Japanese proposal for "a new
 international. conference" at the Djakarta conference.  An
 *  Moscow's East European allies, except for Romania, have
 also failed to recognize the new government.  On 10 August
 Prague's CTK reports that Cambodian sympathizers with Sihanouk
 occupied the Cambodian embassy in Prague and that the second
 secretary announced the FUNK takeover of the embassy.   Hamburg's
 DPA on the 10th reports that CTK later "withdrew" the above
 report, but FBIS has monitored no such "withdrawal."

 12 AUGUST 1970
 NCNA English version of the item, carried on the.llth, omits
 the references to a Geneva conference and the Djakarta
 conference, although it does include the attack on the Soviet
 Union for failing to recognize Sihanouk's government.
 MOSCOW     Moscow's continued routine-level attacks on Peking's
 Indochina stand include a 7 August Mandarin-language
 commentary which again takes issue with the 1 August Peking
 joint editorial.  The broadcast cites the editorial's "slanders"
 of the USSR for "collaboration with U.S. imperialism" as an example
 of "rece:it" statements from Peking which have "shocked and provoked
 concern" among those people who really cherish the interests of the
 Indochinese peoples.  It Ic not necessary to refute these statements,
 says the commentary, since "official statements of the DRV leaders
 and leaders of other countries in Indochina" have highly praised
 Soviet aid.  The commentary responds to Peking's charges by
 countercharging Sino-U.S. collusion, saying that Peking's attack
 brought "Joy" to the American imperialists who have been talking
 about improving Sino-U.S. relations.
 A Mandarin-language broadcast on the 8th does not mention Peking
 explicitly when it says that Soviet aid is "a fact no rumormonger
 can deny," and that all "genuine fighters" against oppression will
 understu'id that "any provocative statements opposing the Soviet
 Union will be advantageous to the imperialists."
 ESTABLISHMENT OF SIHANOUK GOVERNMENT PRESS AGENCY ANNOUNCED
 On 9 August the Cambodian Front radio cites the information bureau
 of the FUNK for the announcement that the News Agency of Kampuchea
 (AKI) will be established on the 10th as the "formal spokesman" of
 the FUNK and Sihanouk's government.  According to the announcement,
 AKI will replace the information bureau in releasing news items
 on the struggle of the Khmer people and all documents issued by the
 FUNK and government.  Also on the 9th, the radio carries a state-
 ment by Hu Nim, minister of information and propaganda'in Sihanouk's
 government, that AKI will release "genuine information" to rebut
 the "fallacious propaganda" of the U.S. "imperialists" and the
 "puppet" administrations in Phnom Penh, Saigon, and Bangkok.  Nothing
 emanating from the new press agency itself has thus far been
 monitored although, beginning on the 10th, VNA and Liberation
 Radio carry battle reports which they attribute to AKI.
 Hanoi's VNA promptly carried both announcements on the 9th, and on

 Foreign Minister Firyubin saw 'i'hiounn Mumm, "minister of national

 no mention of Firyubin's earlier meeting with Thiounn Mumm on

 CCNWiENT ON THE WAR IN THE SOUTH, U. S. STRATEGY
 Recent alleged conununist military achievements in South Vietnam
 are cited in a 1 August GIAI PIIONG commentary which acclaims
 insurgent efforts In the first days of the rainy season.  The
 commentary, broadcast by Liberation Radio on It August, claims
 that. "exploits" at the start of the rainy season "have invalidated
 the U.S.-puppets' deceitful arguments about their recent
 imaginary victories in Cambodia, such o.s :  'fhe Viet Cong--that,
 is, the liberation armed forces--were driven far from the border'
 and that 'the udversary cannot recover his strength for six more
 months."
 DNV military commentator Chien 'Mang (victor) in a 7 August QUAN
 1)01 NIIA14 DAN article entitled "U.S. Strategy Is Confused," deals
 with U.S. failures throughout Indochina.  Ile calls the allied
 Cambodian operation the "Liggest political and strategic mistake
 of the Nixon clique" and says the "counteroffensive to nibble
 at and occupy the Plain of Jars in Laos" was the biggest U.S.
 "military setback" in Laos.
 The article, broadcast by Hanoi on the 7th, begins with the
 claim that U.S. stirate&y has basically shifted from fighting
 rapidly for a quick solution to the strategy of fighting
 protractedly.   It maintains routinely that "time does not
 work In favor of the U.S. aggressors."  Ridiculing U.S.
 measures to carry out its strategy, the article cites
 the role of British expert Sir Robert `Thompson as an
 adviser to President Nixon and derides him for "nonsensically"
 saving that the revolution in South Vietnam is "merely a
 guerrilla war" and for "mechanically" applying his Malaysian
 experiences to South Vietnam.  Chien Thang claims that, on the
 contrary, in South Vietnam "there have not only beer steadfast
 revolutionary bases and strong guerrillas but also powerful
 main forces" and there have been "armed struggles, political
 struggles, a guerrilla war, and a conventional war."

 LE DUAN MEETS WITH "HIGH-RANKING" ARMY PERSONNEL
 Hanoi radio and VNA on 6 August report that VWP First Secretary
 Le Duan "recently called on and talked to high-ranking officers"
 of the Vietnam People's Army, and the VNA press review on the
 same day notes that the meeting was prominently featured in
 NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN.  Available reports do not
 indicate if c,ther DRV leaders were present, but VNA does note
 that "stanuing members" of the "central commission of the party
 .in the army" were there.  The "commission" is presumably the
 high party organization in the army which is usually referred
 to as the Central Military Party Committee.  Such high-level
 figures as Vo Nguyen Glap, Song Ilao, and others have, at
 various times, been identified as members of the committee.
 Precedent for the current meeting was set last year when,
 according to a 22 May 1969 Hanoi broadcast, Ho Chi. Minh
 addressed a "recent" meeting of "high-ranking cadres of
 the eriLire army."*  Last year Hanoi reported that the
 meeting was also attended by Le Duan, Pham Van Dong, and
 Giap.  Truong Chinh was not appearing in public duffing
 this period in 1969.

 by VNA.  But judging by the VNA report, he touco,ed on many
 points raised in his lengthy lh February article on the 40th
 anniversary of the North Vietnamese party.  VNA says that
 Le Duan recalled experiences of the party in developing a
 correct strategic line.  It notes that he stressed the party's
 leading role and the role of the worker-peasant alliance
 and that he cited the party's ability to take advangagc of
 "enemy contradictions."
 VNA reports that Le Duan "encouraged the officers to sum up
 their experiences from the practical as well as the critical
 points of view" in order to develop a Vietnamese military
 science.  And it notes that he recommended to the officers
 "to see clearly the current situation and tasks," charging
 that the United States still "nutures its scheme" to prolong
 and expand the war and quoting Ho that the war "may drag
 out" and the compatriots "may have to undergo new sacrifices
 to terms of property and human lives," but the Vietnamese
 people must be resolved to fight until total victory.

 MIDDLE  EAST
 MOSCOW WELCOMES CEASE-FIRE AS STEP TOWARD PEACE
 TARS on 7 August In a brief triple?-datelined item from Cairo,
 L,ondorr, and Washington promptly reported the respective
 Egyptian, Israeli, and U.S. announcements that the UAR-
 israeli cease-fire would go Into effect at 2200 GMT that day.
 Moscow's first comment comes in a domoutic service report
 from its Cairo correspondent on the 8th which credits the
 agreement on the three-month cease-fire to the "UAI{ pence
 initiative," and says that the Arab world considers the
 "temporary" cease-fire a victory for the UAR's constructive
 foreign policy.  Also on the 8th, TASS says the Egyptian
 press points out that the UAR accepted the ceauc?-fire
 suggestion only "after agreement was reached" that during
 the three months "the enemy will not try to damage the
 security" of Egyptian troops on the Suez front or the
 positions of Arab troops on other fronts.
 Moscow has given minimal attention to subsequent military
 action on the Jordanian and Lebanese fronts:  A brief TASS
 item on the 10th reports from Beirut that the Israeli air
 force made several raids into southern Lebanon on the 9th.
 And Moscow's domestic service, also on the 10th, notes
 Beirut press reports on an Israeli raid and observes that
 while Israel has undertaken a three-month cease-fire in
 the Suez Canal zone, to judge by latest eventa it is not
 prepared to cease "aggressive activity" in other regions.
 TASS has carried no reports of fedayeen operations since
 the 7 August cease-fire; the last such brief report, as
 usual attributed to the Joint Palestinian Command, was on
 3 August.  An average number of such _?eports--between
 12 to 17 per month in the past three months--was transmitted
 by TASS in July.
 Propaganda has noted that the Suez front remains quiet; TASS
 correspondent Trushin reported on the 9th that daring a visit
 by correspondents to the front that day four Israeli planes
 flew over and UAR defenses fired warning shots.  According
 to Trushin, the UAR military spokesman later told journalists
 that the Israeli planes were making a "reconnaissance flight"
 but almost entered the air defense zone.  (Cairo media are
 the only sources for a report that Nasir on the 7th received
 Soviet air force commander Marshal Kutakhov, who arrived from
 Moscow on 1 August.)

 REPORT     7 August report to the Security Council on the
 reactivation of the Jarring mission.  The TASS
 account notes that the Secretary General's report included a
 letter to him from Jarring stating the agreement of the UAR,
 Jordan, and Isra!1 to hold discussions "under my auspices"
 aimed at the estitblishment of peace based on mutual
 acknowledgment oi' each other's soveriegnty, territorial
 integrity, and political independence, and on Israeli with-
 drawal from "territories occupied in the 1967 conflict."
 TASS does not, of course, acknowledge that the language of
 the Jarring letter is identical to that proposed in the U.S.
 initiative of 19 June.

 Isracl'u reaction to the U Thant report is noted but riot detailed
 by Moucow's domestic service in a report from its Cairo correspondent;
 on 10 August.  The UAR Government, the report says, has drawn the
 attention of the United Nations to "To) Aviv's maneuvering" on
 the interpretation of the November resolution.  Correspondent
 Itasuad:iri adds that U 'c'hant's report contains demands for the
 withdrawal of Israeeli troopu frcm the occupied Arab territories,
 and It iu "precisely this point that has aroused irritation and
 dissatisfaction among the Tel Aviv leaders."  (Jerusalem radio
 on the 10th noted that the Secretary General's report omitted
 the conditions on which Israel based its acceptance of' the U.S.
 Initiative.  Israel's reply called for withdrawal from occupied
 territories "to secure, recognized, and agreed boundaries.")
 ISRAELI GOOD FAITH IN ACCEPTING U.S, INITIATIVE QUESTIONED
 Moscow has glossed over Israel's 4 August official acceptance of
 the U.S. initiative:*  A Turkish-language commentary on the 5th,
 for example, notes in passing that after the UAR's agreement
 with the American proposals, Israel, "hithough making certain
 provisos, was forced to declare .t s agreement" with the U.S.
 initiative, and thus "some progress" has been made toward a
 peaceful settlement.  The acceptance is also acknowledged in
 the course of a Radio Peace and Progress broadcast in Yiddish
 on the 5th dealing with Prime Minister Meir's Knesset statement.
 Limited comment touching on the statement singles out Mrs. Meir's
 refusal to return to the 4 June 1967 borders and her insistence
 on secure frontiers, and asserts that "Israeli ruling circles"
 thus intend, "during the first steps leading to a settlement,"
 to create cbstacles and ultimately frustrate a solution.
 In reporting the statement on the 6th, TASS fails to mention
 that Mrs. Meir was responding to, the. V"B  initiative when it cites
 her as saying Israel is ready to conduct talks and send a
 representative to r;iscuss with the UAR and Jordan, "'with
 Gunnar Jarring's mediation,' questions that 'fall within the
 framework of the Security Council resolution."  At the same
 time, TASS adds, she repeated "aggressive" Israeli claims,
 *  The text of Jordanian Foreign Minister Atallah's 26 July
 reply to Secretary Rogers approving the U.S. proposal,
 broadcast by Amman radio on 5 August, is identified by TASS
 in a short report the following day as an official Jordanian
 Government statement "in support' of the peace initiative of
 the UAR."

 .,p 7ceciCLcally declaring that Israel would not withdraw to the
 pre-5 June 1967 borders.  TASS comments that "Israeli ruling
 circles refuse to give up their methods of blackmail and
 backstage maneuvers," which create difficulties for political
 normalization of the Middle East situation.
 Mrs. Meir'o remarks on borders are similarly singled out in
 a 6 August foreign-language commentary by Tsoppi, which asserts
 that the United States "compelled" the Israeli Government to
 "formally .ccept" its proposal.  But Israel does not intend
 to revise its policy of military expansion, Tsoppi says, and
 even its consent to the U.S. plan, "which in fact does not
 :,et., any obligations for it, was only given after receiving
 the U.S. assurance that it would continue to supply modern
 offensive weapons."
 A broadcast in Arabic on the 7th sets Mrs. Meir's statement
 in the context of "desperate maneuvers" by Tel Aviv in the
 .light of its "total isolation" as a result of prospects for
 a political settlement.  The broadcast says this was the
 first time the word withdrawal was heard in the Knesset
 since June 1967, and that Mrs. Meir was "also compelled
 to declare" Israel's agreement to hold talks through Jarring
 and within the framework of Resolution 242.  It too, however,
 believes the statements on borders signify an Israeli
 intention to create obstacles to a settlement.
 USSR BUILDS UP ITS PEACE IMAGE, REJECTS JOINT BIG-TWO ROLE
 While playing up the UAR's "farsighted and consistent" position
 and giving Cairo credit for its "peaceful initiative," Moscow
 at the same time takes pains to enhance its own image as a
 promoter of a political settlement "from the very start."
 But Soviet propaganda rejects any notion of a "special role
 by two major powers" in pursuing a peaceful solution.
 Comment emphasizes that "as long ago as 1967" the Soviet
 Union put forward proposals aimed at a peaceful settlement,
 and propagandists present the adoption of Resolution 242
 as resulting from the activity of the USSR and other socialist
 countries.  A Soltan commentary broadcast in Arabic on the
 10th, for example, finds it "worth mentioning" that the USSR
 "was one of the first countries in 1967 to submit proposals"
 for effecting a just peace.  And Radio Peace and Progress

 broadcasts in English to Africa and in Yiddish to Israel en
 the 10th, also recalling Soviet proposals "back in 1967," say
 that the cease-fire dispells "American myths" that the Arabs
 plan to liquidate Isra-~cl as a state, and that the Soviet
 Union has "some sort of special aims" in the Middle East
 and is interested Jn preserving tension there.
 A broadcast in Arabic on the 6th complains of "imperialist
 propaganda" attempts to "disfigure the aim of the USSR's
 present attitude, plaoing both the Soviet Union and tI.e
 United States on the same level regarding the efforts
 made for a Middle East settlement."  It argues that the
 two countries' attitudes toward the essence and form of
 a settlement are "totally contradictory," the United States
 pursuing imperialist aims while the Soviet Union as a
 socialist state opposes oppression, exploitation, violence,
 and expansion in international relations.
 Declaring that the USSR strives to enable "the Egyptians,
 Syrians, Pales~i,;fans, and other people" of the Middle
 East "to determine their destiny by themselves," the
 commentary repeats the 15 July Supreme Soviet statement's
 formulation that the people and governments of the Middle
 East alone should be masters of the situation.  And it
 recalls that in June 1967 Kosygin "refuted the statement
 that the two major powers" should lead the world and
 dictate their conditions to it.  (In response to a question
 at his 25 June 1967 press conference at the United Nations
 regarding suggestions that peace in the world could be
 established by the two superpowers, Kosygin said that such
 a view, in the Soviet opinion, "is completely erroneous
 and certainly runs counter to our outlook, our doctrine,
 our plilosophy.  We believe that all nations, big and
 small, can and should participate in the discussion and
 solution of all world problems, in particular in the
 General Assembly.  We can never share the view that
 there can be any kind of dictatorship of two states--
 the United States and the Soviet Union--over the world.")
 A broadcast in Arabic on 9 August also recalls that
 Kosygin said in June 1967--this time in his 19 June
 address at the special session of the General Assembly--
 that the USSR did not recognize Israeli usurpation of
 territories and would work for the establishment of
 peace.

 U.S.,-SOVIET      An Arabic broadcast on 7 August contains
 PEACEKEEPING      Moscow's only monitored reaction to the idea
 of a joint Soviet-American peacekeeping force
 in the Middle East, as suggested in a 4 August, Washington POST
 editorial.  Noting the efforts of "some imperialist circles"
 to impose their ways of solving the Middle East problem, the
 commentary observes that the POST proposed a plan "to use
 Soviet and U.S. forces in this respect."  It rejects the
 idea as "an attempt to drag the c.oviet Union into U.S.
 diplomatic ways and methods which are alien" to the USSR,
 and asserts that the Soviet Union "resolutely denounces and
 condemns such ways and methods."  A just Middle East
 settlement can be guaranteed by eliminating the causes
 of the conflict, it says, not by bringing in foreign forces.
 MOSCOW RESTRAINED ON ARAB OPPOSITION TO.POLITICAL SOLUTION
 Propaganda touches only indirectly on militant Arab--primarily
 Palestinian and Iraqi--opposition to Cairo's acceptance of
 the U.S. initiative, portraying the UAR action as meeting
 with growing approval in the Arab world.  Moscow gave limited
 attention to the 5-6 August conference in Tripoli, Libya,
 of foreign and defense ministers of the "frontline states,"
 TASS on the 5th noting the presence of delegates from the
 UAR, Syria, Jordan, Sudan, and Libya.  The main topic on
 the agenda, TASS added, was discussion of fulfillment of
 the "joint action plan against Israeli aggression" approved
 by the conference of heads of a number of Arab states in
 Tripoli 21-22 June.  Iraq and Algeria, which attended the
 June meeting, were not present at the August conference.
 Assessing the results, TASS blandly cites UAR, Jordanian,
 and Libyan press comment to the effect that the "successful"
 meeting brought "full agreement on unity of action of the
 Arab states" against Israel.
 Moscow widely publicizes the speech by Mazurov at a 5 August
 luncheon for a party-government delegation from dissident Iraq*
 *  Budapest's NEPSZABADSAG in a 5 August article called Iraq's
 "negative attitude" on the question of a negotiated settlement
 "definitely harmful to the cause of peace in, the Middle East."
 Such a stand, it said, "only adds grist to the mills of the
 aggressive imperialist policy, against which the progressive
 forces of Iraq" are waging a "long and hard war."  Articles
 in Budapest's ESTI HIRLAP on 28 July and MAGYAR NEMZET on the?
 31st had similarly taken "Arab extremists" to task for refusing
 to act responsibly.

 in which he pledged continued Soviet aid to the Arab states
 and pointedly added that the Soviet Government, at the same
 time, "will do everything within its power to facilitate the
 attainment of a just political settlement."  He characterized
 such a settlement as entailing "first of all," withdrawal of
 Israeli troops from all occupied Arab territories and
 "satisfaction of the just rights of the Arab people of
 Palestine."  Other propaganda also stresses these dual
 aims proclaimed by Cairo.
 TASS on 11 August reported that Kosygin received the head of
 the Iraqi delegation that day and that "the discussion of
 questions of mutual interest passed in a friendly atmosphere."
 The delegation left for home on the 12th; no communique has
 as yet been released.
 PALESTINIAN      Again indicating sensitivity on the Palestinian
 QUESTION         question, Moscow in a 5 August broadcast to
 Arab listeners assails Peking for its opposition
 to a political settlement, and complains that Peking depicts
 the Palestinians' struggle "for their lawful rights as though
 it contradicted the possibility of peacefully liberating the
 occupied Arab territories."  The commentary rhetorically asks
 if liberation of the lands occupied since 1967 does not serve
 the basic interests of the Palestinian people.  And it
 maintains that realization of the November 1967 Security
 Council resolution, which provides for liberatic  of the
 occupied territories and insures the Palestinian refugees'
 lawful rights, "would be an important step along the path
 of completely solving the Palestinian question."
 A Petrov article in LIFE ABROAD, signed to press 29 July,
 argues along the same lines in stating that Palestinian
 "national rights" can only be implemented within the
 framework of the general Arab "liberation struggle."
 Given the possibilities inherent in the 1967 Security
 Council resolution and other UN decisions, he says,
 Palestinian rights can undoubtedly be ultimately
 guaranteed "without infringing on the Israeli people's
 rights."  In a lengthy article contrasting the "class"
 'rersus "national" approaches to the Arab-Israeli
 conflict, Petrov says that Arab leaders are experiencing
 difficulties in convincing the working masses of the
 correctness of a political course to a Middle East

 settlement. Considering that "not all Arab countries" agree
 with Cairo's decision regarding a political solution, the
 UAR leadership faces a diffictit task in explaining its
 policy to the Arab public, Petrov concludes.
 PEKING EXTOLS PALESTINIAN STRUGGLE, ASSAILS ;I SUPERPOWERS "
 Predictably, Peking fails to ac'".-o Tledge Nasir's acceptance
 of the U.S. initiative, and ignores the UAR-Israeli cease-
 fire instituted on 7 August.  Long a voluble exponent of
 Palestinian armed struggle, Peking exploits the opposition
 of militant Arabs to the U.S. initiative for a peaceful
 settlement in the Middle East, at  he same time obliquely
 attacking the Soviets for betrayal of the Arab cause.  NCNA
 depicts the U.S. proposal as meeting with "strong condemnation
 and resolute opposition by the 100 million Arab people,"
 quoting from Palestinian, Iraqi, and Syrian statements, but
 carefully avoids mentioning any criticism of the UAR, whose
 revolution anniversary on 23 July was duly saluted by Chou
 En-lai in "warm" greetings to Nasir.  Thus NCNA on the 8th,
 summarizing Iraqi President al-Bakr's interview with the
 GUARDIAN, reports his rejection of the American proposal
 and his vow to continue the struggle against Zionism,
 but omits his charges, as published in the GUARDIAN, that
 Egypt is incapable of leading the Arabs or his critical
 comment regarding the "Nasirites."
 In keeping with present Chinese policy of not attacking
 Moscow directly, an NCNA commentary on 30 July accused
 the United States and "another so-called superpower"
 of planning a Middle East Munich* "in a vain attempt
 to force the Palestinian people and the people of the
 Arab countries to give up their just struggle."  An NCNA
 commentary on 7 August described the cease-fire proposals
 as "a trick" designed to enable the "U.S. and Israeli
 aggressors to reinforce their base for aggression."  It
 went on to assert that President Nixon had enlisted "certain
 people of the no-called superpower" to aid him in his Middle
 East "plot."
 *  Prague's RUDE PRAVO on 6 August took a swipe at the Chinese
 in noting that NCNA's charges that the United States and the
 USSR are preparing a new Munich in the Middle East closely
 parallel the Munich charges made by rightwing "chauvinists"
 in the Israeli Government.

 AIeco cii '( August, NCNA publicized the reply of FATAH, the
 ,,.organ of the leading fedayeen organization, to PRAVDA's
 rit..1cism of the guerrillas' stand on the U.S. proposal.
 G'ATAII, NCNA said, had enjoined Moscow to be silent if it
 could not offer the fedayeen "internationalist support."
 Two days later, in a dispatch from Damascus, NCNA reported
 that FATAH had charged the Soviet Union with assuming the
 right to decide the fate of Palestine and with supporting
 decisions that were against the will of the Palestinian
 people.  (Chou in late May had sent a warm message of
 support to Fatah leader Yasir Arafat, on the occasion of
 the Israeli incursion into Lebanon, pledging the support
 of the PRC people and government for the armed struggle
 of the Palestinian revolution.)  A Palestinian "special
 envoy," according to the Syrian news agency on the 11th,
 left the previous day for a tour of the PRC, DRV, and
 DPRK to hold "important talks" with officials on the
 "present situation and the necessary measures to counter
 the recent plot."
 Concurrently, Peking has given a warm welcome to a delegation
 from the hard-line People's Republic of South Yemen, and is
 now feting a delegation led by Presiuent an-Numayri of Sudan.
 In a speech at a 7 August reception for an-Numayri, PRC
 Vice Chairmen Tung Pi-wu, according to NCNA, warned
 against attempts by the United States and its "collaborator"
 to split the Arab countries and to stamp out revolutionary
 struggle in the Middle East.  He confidently noted that the
 Arab people are "well tempered" in revolutionary struggle
 an-1 added that "so long as the goal of the national
 liberation movement of Palestine and other Arab countries
 remains unrealized, the so-called Middle East question
 cannot possibly be settled."  It is the Palestinian and
 other Arab peoples, he said, "and not one or two 'super-
 powers' who will decide the destiny of Palestine and the
 Arab world."
 TIRANA SUPPORTS PALESTINIAN REJECTION OF U.S. INITIATIVE

 member of the "upper central committee" of Fatah, was

 ZERI I POPULLIT on 30 July, in an article marking the

 Union for their "plans" to "lay their hands on the riches

 Israeli Government from political and military disaster."
 The article acknowledged, without comment, that the UAR

 adding that "the Arab people are fully entitled to liberate

 FRG-SOVIET TREATY
 ACCORD HAILED BY MOSCOW AS "MILESTONE" FOR EUROPE
 The. 12 AuE;uut signing in Moscow of the Soviet.-Went German
 treaty is promptly hailed by TAGS commentator Orlov au it
 "milestone" in Europe's poutwar history which will facilitate
 an improvement in that continent's political climate and may
 facilitate an Improvement in the general international
 situation.  According to Orlov, the spirit of "realism"
 Is evident in the recognition of the inviolability of
 European frontiers, including the Oder-Neiuac line and the
 frontier between the FRG and the GD11, and in the commitment
 of the USSR and the FRG not to solve disputes through force
 or the threat of force.  The common point of departure in
 the treaty, Orlov says, is the desire to help reduce
 tension and to promote the development of peaceful relationu
 for the sake of consolidating security in Europe.   Orlov
 routinely takes note of the fact that there are "forces"
 in West Germany which do not r,pprove such developments as
 the treaty, "but, judging by everything, such quarters
 enjoy ever less support."
 At thin, writing, Soviet media have not released the text of
 the treaty and the accompanying letters to the USSR and the
 FRG's Western allies; nor are they known to have acknowledged
 the premature release of the documents by the Springer press.
 Consistent with treatment of the negotiations with Bonn since
 cneir resumption in the Soviet capital on 27 July, Moscow
 devoted only a low volume of prop,.ganda to the 7 August
 initialing of the FRG-Soviet treaty.  TASS and Radio Moscow
 on the 7th promptly reported the fact of the initialing, and
 subsequent dispatches took note of favorable world reaction
 to the treaty.  TASS on 9 August, for example, drawing heavily
 on the East European press, pointed up the importance of the
 agreement for the cause of European security.  In the period
 between the initialing and the formal signing, TASS items
 briefly reported Brandt's arrival in Moscow for the 12 August
 ceremony and his activities in the Soviet capital, including
 his meeting with Kosygin.
 Gromyko's remarks at the 7 August airport departure
 ceremonies for Scheel had highlighted Moscow's minimal comment
 on the treaty initialing.  As reported by TASS, Gromyko said

 on Lhc 8th, reviewed by PAP, said that the initialing of the
 treaty "huu certainly produced a favorable climate" for other
 negotiations.  A CTK-reviewed article in the Bratiulavrs
 PRAVDA on 8 August made a similar point but went on to warn,
 however, that the CUU/CSU opposition in West Germany remains
 intent on "torpedoing" the accord before .ratification.  The
 Prague daily ZEMEDELSKE, NOVINY, in an article on the 10th,
 observed that the treaty could become "a springboard into
 the future of Europe" if Bonn continues to pursue the Polish-
 West German talks, seeks to resolve the "open issue" with
 Czechoslovakia, and "expresses its positive relation" to
 the GDR.
 *  Soviet media have not reported the substance of a Kosygin

 to AFP on the 10th, he said that the treaty was a "major
 political event" which should serve to stabilize the situation

 In it related development, East German media on the 9th
 sutnrnari;:ed Ulbricht'c letter to the heads of state of various
 NA'.1'O and nonaligned countries on the need for developing
 relations with the GDR.  Accordirg to the letter, the
 "fundamentally new situation" in Europe demands this.
 While the letter does not specify the FRG-Soviet treaty as
 an clement in the "new situe ;ion," an East Berlin broadcast
 on the 10th says that the successful Bonn-Moscow talks as well
 as the Polish-West German talks "belong to the factors of
 European politics which Walter Ulbricht, in his message to
 various heads of state, said has led to a new sit?iation."

 USSR SAYS BASES AGREEMENT LINKS SPAIN TO NATO
 Soviet comment: oil the 6 August; uigoirig of the military bases
 agreement between thn tinIte(l StatCtl and  ')pa.In utresucu that
 the agreement .links t;pain more closely with the NATO defense
 system to the detriment of ii:uropctui security, fills the
 "breach" in the NATO front created by the French withdrawal,
 and provides the Pentagon with new footholds in the
 Mediterranean.   :;ovict media also point. out the risks of
 the new agreement to the ;Spuuish people and claim the
 agreement's "new obligations toward Madrid" are provoking
 domestic U.S. opposition to the Nixon Administration's
 use of the executive agreement.  Commentators  ;rnerally
 opined that, the Administration rushed the signing of the
 agreement i:r order to present the Senate and the country
 with a fait accompli, asserting that the agreement involved
 "the expansion of American military commitments" and should
 have been referred to the Senate for ratification.
 A commentator on the 9 August doriestic service roundtable
 program declared that the agreement binds Spain "to the
 NATO military system by the bac,' door."  This theme was
 embellished by PRAVDA's Strelnikcv who rioted, according to
 a TASS review of the 10th, that U.S. military considerations
 have assisted Spain to realize, in affect, its "old dream"
 of membership in NATO despite continued opposition to Spanish
 membership by several NATO members.  Strelnikov attributed
 tae conclusion of this "dangerous deal" to Pentagon efforts
 to strengthen and expand "the military beachhead in the
 Iberian Peninsula."  RED STAR on 8 August, according to TASS,
 said that Spain has become the only place where the Pentagon
 can "somehow compensate the loss of its bases first in France
 and then in Libya."  TASS correspondent Melikyan on 7 August
 claimed that the agreement's establishment of a high-level
 joint committee on defense matters creates "a bridge between
 Spain and the NAIJ military bloc" and represents "the first
 step" in Pentagon designs to "strengthen the NATO rear."
 Melikyan also asserts that nuclear-armed U.S. planes flying
 from bases in Spain will "create daily and hourly the danger
 of a new Palomares for the Spanish people," recalling the
 17 January 1966 incident.  Several other Sovicc. commentaries
 also raise the spectre of Palomares in stressing that the
 agreement "contradicts Spain's national security and the people's
 interests."
