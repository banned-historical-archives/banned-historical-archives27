 The Lloscow radio and press and Soviet-controlled radio stations
 have referred to Ho as a Communist.  Ho himself, has not attempted to
 make this point clear nor is there any evidence available which would
 completely prove this point one way or the other.         However, Moscow's
 adoption of Ho as a Communist and the fact that the key positions in
 his goverment are occupied by avowed or known Communists argue for
 CIA's present assumption that Ho also is a Communist.

 Indochina, "Among the 21 million people of leading united front,, the -          _.
 almost four years has been the revolutionary by the Commu4dst leadeyp Ho Chi Minh."
 AO               _
 DB 4975; 16 July 1947
 Origin: Canton
 Canton Comment to Para 1:  One of the greatest puzzles in regard to Indochina is;
 "How Communist is Ho Chi Minh and to what extent does he follow Moscovils orders "
 Various sources differ radically on      point. this          French, Vietnam Nationalist, and
 most Chinese Nationalist sources take it for granted that Ho is privately just as
 Communist as ever; but these sources have so far failed to produce concrete
 evidence to that effect.  Pro-Vietminh sources, however, maintain that Ho has
 abandoned his    ?ui,    ism.      .                 neutral invites          journa    -      and observers
 to inspect
 for themselves.  Even CHANG Fa-ktuei         that he has become convinc,,d that Ho
 states
 logic, is no longer much of a CommunIst and certainly does not follow Yoscow's orders.
 The         however.-remains: once a man has ?:     through     Moscow training and
 has acted for a lengthy period as an agent of Moscow, there are only two possible
 sources -- either a clear and public renunciation of Communism la Krivetsky., which
 Ho has not made, or continuance of Moscow-directed activities).
 Canton Comment to kara 2:  Ho is constantly trying to a)nvince the outside world
 of his non-Communism, but has so far refused to commit himself to a definite and
 open renunciation of Communism.  Conseqq ently, except for duly authorized
 official pronouncements., minor officials find it safer to avoid the subject),

 Party) appear on the banner.          The hammer and sickle appears on the
 flag with the Viet Minh star,
 The Ho Chi Minh Government does not ignore the existence of
 the Party*  On the contrary., a few of the more recent events will prove
 that there are Vietnamese Communists in the ranks of the Viet Minh who
 influence the acts of the rebel government*
 A recent circular ordered all echelons of the nation to
 celebrate the USSRs October Revolution*  On this oocasionq Viet Minh
 propagandists were to make aparallel between that revolution and the
 present fight against the French.  Among the slogans to be used weres
 "Complete support to the USSR,," "Long Live the success of the October
 Revolution," "Long live the victory of the antifascist Democratic
 ?
 A sort of camouflage was still maintained,, however; only
 the official circles of the 4Association for the Study of Marxism"
 could organize public demonstrations,  In Viet Minh circles., members
 already known as "former Communists" could celebrate the October
 Revolution "privately."
 The following circular was distributed in October to all ranks
 of the Viet Minh administrative machinet  *The Government of the
 Demooratic Republic of Viet Nam regrets to announce that Zhdanov,
 Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party and member of the Current

 Another circular indicates the recent attitude toward the
 US,  It was addressed to all the "comrades" of the Viet Minh:  *We
 are faced with a situation which forces us to instigate against the
 profound US a           and extended movement which-will reach all levels of
 the massese  As for those who propagandize in favor of the US, arrest

 Here is a personal description of Ho Chi Minh by a high French official
 who on many occasions during Franc o-Vietnamese relations talked "several times a
 dair" with the Vietminh party president:
 "Ile is a very attractive and difficult personality.  He is most in-
 telligent and possessed of a broad spirit.  While he has been a
 nolitical party chief, I do not think he has ever been chief of
 a government.  There is no one chief of the Vietnam Government
 but several members - as in Russia.  I do not think Ho has ever
 been a free man. Ile is a very good propagandist - in many ways
 a genius in this respect.  In his real mind he may be a conspirator
 - lie has lived a long time in China and Siam.  He is very cunning
 and a first class actor.  I believe that while No has always had
 the same desire as other members of the Darty - total independence
 wid the destruction of France's position in Indochina - he is
 more moderate."

 with the Coujnuniat Party.
 During 1944 the Dan Chu Dang, or Democratic Party., was forled.  -Lhere is

 no circumstances would oppose him on any fundamental issue.

 With the Chinese troops in occupation of Indochina and a civil war brewing
 in northern China, Ho apparently decided theword Communist was extremely unpopular
 Therefore, on Nover ber 30, 1940)~ the Dong Duong Gong San Dang dissolved itself.
 Its members were distributed among the various leagues and parties which formed
 the Viet Minh Front. '~'ince that date, the Communist Party as such has not functioned

 were aiding Vietminh forces, particularly in the Hanoi area have brought forth
 a strong denial from local Vietnamese News Service Representatives.  On April 9

 Around 1 Dee 48 according to                           a Mr, SIMOVICH., of
 JUGOSLAV nationality', formerly a USTASHI member., was present in PRXHA acting as
 a representative for Ok~WIPOLJ the official buying and selling agency for

 VIET NAM forces.   According to the source., SD~OVICH, was recently the OMNIPOL
 representative in KARACHI., INDIA, and was returned to PRAHA by unknowh persons to
 make the arms purchase.  A separate source                             reported
 substantially the same information at the same time., only adding that the arms to
 be brought were small arms of several types all coming from the ZBROJOVKA BRNO
 factories.

 I C(TUNT: Sales here to the VIE7 UVARSE WGULD probably be countenanced by the
 SOVIETS, and.it is knomn that CZMHOSLOVAKIA has arms available for purchase.
 However'.,the sale of such arms has usually been contingent on the purchaser's
 ability to pay hard currency.  No further information is available but details
