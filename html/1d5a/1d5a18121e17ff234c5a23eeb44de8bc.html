 20 July 1971
 MEMORANDUM
 SUBJECT: International Implications of the Presidential Trip to China
 1. The President's journey to Peking will be regarded by almost
 all governments as the beginning of a new phase in Sino-American rela-
 tions which will profoundly affect the future balance of international
 power and influence.  Most will welcome the development, applauding it
 as an act of realistic statesmanship and a move toward peace.  But all
 will view it from the perspective of their own interests and, on this
 ground, some will be apprehensive.
 2.  The fact that Peking was moving to resume an active role in
 world politics has been evident for some time.  What will surprise many
 will be the radical acceleration of this development signaled by a will-
 ingness to enter into direct contact with the United States at the

 highest level.  The result may be a tendency in some quarters to exaggerate
 the significance of China's world role and the flexibility with which that
 role will be played.
 3.  The expectations and apprehensions of the major states concerned,
 as discussed below, will probably be tempered as the Sino-American dialogue
 proceeds.  Peking's concrete aims -- to increase deterrence of pressures
 by the USSR, to gain a voice in the Indochina settlement, to isolate and
 weaken the Nationalist regime on Taiwan, to hedge against a revival of
 Japan's power and ambition -- will emerge in perspective and tend to be
 taken eventually as part of the normal landscape of world politics.
 4.  Peking is able and willing to contemplate the possible advantages
 to be gained by a more flexible approach to the United States at this
 time, in part because it perceives United States power in Asia, and par-
 ticularly its military presence in Indochina, as being on the wane.
 Given this perception which has now existed for a year or more, it was
 no longer essential to hold to a rigid and totally uncompromising position
 toward the United States and there emerged the possibility that Peking's
 interests could be advanced as a consequence of contacts with the United
 States.

 5.  Closely linked in time to this perception of the United
 States posture was China's emergence from the chaos of the Cultural
 Revolution.  This audacious gamble had its costs and many problems
 remain to be solved.  While upsets are still possible, China now
 seems to be firmly on the move.  The net result appears to be a
 new confidence on the part of the top leadership -- Mao Tse-tung,
 Lin Piao, and Chou En-Lai -- and a new dynamic in domestic and
 foreign affairs.  With its people hard at work, China is preparing
 -- on the basis of economic growth, military potential, and moral
 force -- to reclaim its age-old role as the dominant and central
 power in Asia.  It expects recognition of this role to come by
 .right, which means that Japan, the states of Southeast Asia, and
 the Western world must pay an appropriate price to earn China's
 favor and good will.  Nonetheless, Peking is acutely aware of the
 distance it has to go in making good its claims and of the many
 obstacles which remain in its path.

 II.      EAST ASIA
 6.  In those parts of Asia which have long experience in dealing
 with Imperial China, the President's visit may have a unique impact.
 Asians have been accustomed over the centuries to. seeing their rulers
 travel to Peking; in more recent times the flow has included friends and
 worshipers of Mao from all corners of the.earth.  Against this background
 and tradition, it will be difficult for the Asians to comprehend the pur-.
 pose of the leader of the world's strongest power in making the long trip
 to Peking.  While accepting and welcoming it as a move toward peace, they
 will tend to believe, in the absence of obvious contrary evidence, that
 the United States President has paid the higher price.  As realists, these
 countries will move to adjust their positions to what they perceive as the
 evolving growth in Chinese power and influence.
 NationaZiet China
 7.  As could be expected, initial reactions by officials of the
 Republic of China indicate that they have been badly shaken by recent
 United States contacts with Peking.  The GRC's more ,emotional statements
 have questioned United States credibility and the National Assembly has
 described the United States action as a "betrayal of allies".  Official
 spokesmen have described the present crisis as the most serious to hit
 the government since it was evicted from the mainland in 1949.

 8.  Once beyond the immediate period of shock and bitterness,
 however, Taipei is likely to turn to more sober reassessments of its
 position.  Even though it may continue to vent its anger against the
 United States in public, the government is likely to conclude in pri-
 vate counsels that actions taken against the United States are likely
 to damage the GRC far more than the United States.  Even under emotional
 stress, the GRC is not likely to forget that it has nowhere else to
 turn; no other government is willing or able to replace the United States
 as the guarantor of Taiwan's security.
 9.  Thus, beyond the impassioned rhetoric, Taipei is likely to
 concentrate on efforts to pin down United States intentions.  It will
 probably seek explicit reassurances on United States defense commit-
 ments toward Taiwan.  The military, in particular, will hope to carry
 on as usual.  In this way, and by trying to exact public guarantees of
 United States support, it will hope to place a limit on any United
 States concessions to Peking.
 10.  Internally, the Nationalists will be especially alert for any
 hints of evolving security problems.  Any activity by the small Taiwan
 Independence Movement will be harshly suppressed.  There will be height-
 ened concern over the possibility of dissidence among students and

 Approved ForQMease 2006/039   mP79R0096WO0400010013-3
 even among the top ranks of the military.  The GRC will probably take
 the prudent action of rechecking its carefully selected and strategically
 placed security forces.  During this traumatic period, the GRC will prob-
 ably show even less tolerance than usual for criticisms of its leadership.
 In the circumstances, a "spontaneous" demonstration aimed at United
 States installations on Taiwan cannot be ruled out.  But Taipei will pro-
 ceed with caution in this area, fearing not only United States reactions
 but also the possibility that such a demonstration might get out of control
 and turn against the government.
 11.  The United States move toward improving relations with Peking
 will probably not cause an immediate major upheaval on Taiwan.
 Nevertheless, there will be many who will read United States actions as
 marking the beginning of the end for the Nationalist regime.  This will
 be especially so. if, as now seems likely, the GRC loses or gives up its
 seat in the UN this year.  Native Taiwanese will see new hope for an
 independent government, or at least one in which they can play a larger
 role.  Within the GRC there is likely to be covert consideration of other
 options, not excluding a change of government.  Some may even examine
 the idea of tentative feelers toward Peking.  But for all the agitation
 that may shake the GRC, it is difficult to picture any drastic reorienta-
 tion of policies as long as Chiang Kai-shek remains active.

 Japan
 12.  In Tokyo, the United States announcement has been something of
 a bombshell.  The Sato government is greatly disturbed on three counts.
 Politically, it is considerably more vulnerable than before to charges
 of stalling in building a viable Japanese relationship with Peking.
 There is also genuine concern -- at least in the Sato-Kishi wing of the
 conservative party -- that Washington may have taken a giant step toward
 abandonment of the GRC and the island of Taiwan; the Japanese themselves
 had counted on much more time to develop and experiment with a de facto
 "Two Chinas" policy, and may well view the United States move as pre-
 maturely foreclosing this option.  Finally, and perhaps most important
 in the long run, Japan's cherished policy objective of becoming the
 West's "bridge" to China would appear to have suffered major damage.
 13.  The consequences may be most apparent in Japanese domestic
 politics.  Sato's increased vulnerability on China policy will substan-
 tially increase intra-party pressures for his retirement this year
 (rather than next) and will also harm the prospects of his designated
 heir, Foreign Minister Fukuda (who is equally vulnerable on the issue).
 To meet the attack, Sato may agree to new concessions to Peking on such
 issues as trade credits and official political exchanges.  In this way --

 Approved For'-iirlease 2006/0kt4DP79R0096700400010013-3
 and as the dust settles in Washington and Peking -- he may gain time to
 restore party discipline on the overriding issue of full diplomatic rec-
 ognition.                             But Sato has always been anathema to Peking and it seems
 likely that any persistent Japanese tide in favor of Peking will eventu-
 ally carry Sato out of office.
 14.  Tokyo's foreign policy planners are certain to return to the
 drawing board in pursuit of ways to adjust to the new uncertainties
 opened up by the announcement -- for both the long and short term.
 Whatever tactics the Japanese adopt, there will be emphasis on projecting
 a more positive image of Japan as a factor on the Asian political scene,
 and seeking a more independent stance than before toward both Taipei and
 Peking.  But United States and Japanese interests in Asia remain, after
 all, basically congruent, and for all its pique with the United States
 move, there remain distinct limits on Japan's freedom of action.  It is
 not in the long run going to want to be too far out of step with Washington
 in dealing with the march of events in Asia.  There are no doubt great
 differences of view in Tokyo about how to go about adjusting, and uncer-
 tainty about how far things will go.  But the question will be under
 much more intensive study from now on, and Japan may have to define its
 long term role earlier than it had anticipated.

 15.  It is by no means clear at this time that the recent move will
 have appreciable effect on the course of the Indochinese war; Hanoi
 rather than China calls the communist tune in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
 Traditionally suspicious of Chinese motives, the North Vietnamese are quite
 obviously concerned that their interests may be subordinated in any
 across-the-board Sino-American deal.  They may, for instance, anticipate
 that the Chinese, in an effort to avoid upsetting the budding detente
 with the United States, will now urge Hanoi to exercise restraint in the
 war.  Hanoi would resent and resist any such advice.  Indeed, it is doubt-
 ful that Peking has either the leverage or the inclination to force Hanoi
 down any road it does not want to travel.  But it is likely that, despite
 any assurances from Peking, Hanoi will become increasingly wary of
 Chinese intentions in the area and increasingly inclined to question the
 scope and direction of Peking's new activist foreign policy.
 16.  As for the South Vietnamese, there will be greater concern
 than before that United States disengagement will be conducted ultimately
 on terms negotiated with the communists.  And, on the military side, there
 will be concern that additional constraints will be placed on the employ-
 ment of United States air power.   In the political realm, some in

 Saigon are already interpreting the United States initiative as an election
 boost for "Big" Minh, the "peace" candidate.  As for Phnom Penh and
 Vientiane, convictions will be reinforced that the war will eventually be
 resolved in ways beyond their control by powers greater than themselves.
 17.  Elsewhere in East Asia, the United States move is also seen
 largely through the prism of local security needs.. While virtually all
 governments applaud in principle the approach to China, there is concern
 that it may imply a relatively rapid and -- in their view -- premature
 United States withdrawal from security responsibilities in the region.
 The Malaysians, who have increasingly staked their security on some sort
 of regional compact between the major powers, appear least worried.  Nor
 are the Filipinos, from their safe distance, particularly upset.  Indonesia
 and Singapore, however, tend to take a more ominous view of the Chinese
 threat; they are likely to seek United States reassurances.  All this
 and more can be said regarding the Thai despite their own persistent
 overtures to Peking.  In all these states, it seems clear that existing
 tendencies toward accommodation with Peking will be accelerated.

 18.  The Korean situation could obviously be greatly affected by
 any full-scale United States-Chinese rapprochement, and this possibility
 is much on the minds of the Koreans -- North and South.     Pyongyang would
 resent any moderation in Peking's support of its brief against the United
 States; and will be watchful of any reluctance to offer military aid.
 Peking must be aware of North Korean unease; a few days ago, it supplied
 some high-level condemnation of the United States on the Pyongyang
 banquet circuit.  Negative reactions in the South arise from apprehensions
 over the possibility of reduced United States military support for the
 ROK.
 19.  In Australia, recent events have clearly embarrassed Prime
 Minister McMahon.  McMahon spent much of recent weeks criticizing his
 Labor opponent's alleged softness toward Peking and is now busily back-
 pedaling, while Labor -- which in any case has a good shot at power in
 the next general election -- stands to gain in the exchange.  A similar
 situation in New Zealand has been resolved without damage to the incum-
 bent conservative leadership but both countries seem certain to move
 more quickly than before toward diplomatic relations with Peking.

 III.  SOUTH ASIA
 20.  The Pakistani military regime, feeling estranged from most of the
 world and fearful of war with India, has seen only two major countries --
 China and the United States -- as actually or potentially helpful to it.
 Pakistan has never been comfortable with the fact that its two best friends
 have been enemies.  A change of any degree here would obviously be welcome
 because it might strengthen Pakistan's security against India at a time
 when it badly feels it needs it.  Beyond this, it is doubtful that the
 heavily preoccupied Pakistani Government has given much thought to the
 United States-Chinese move.  It will judge the unfolding process of United
 States-Chinese relations almost entirely in terms of whether it promises
 to hurt or harm Pakistan with respect to the threat it feels from India.
 21.  The news clearly caught India by surprise; public remarks to
 date indicate considerable uncertainty amongst officials, newspapers, and
 the general public.  But anti-Chinese sentiments are strong in India; the
 United States too has come in for widespread and bitter criticism for its
 recent policies toward Pakistan.  The danger of Indo-Pakistani war, imme-
 diately precipitated in this case by the Indians  is now greater than at
 any time since 1965.  Thus the prospect of a United States-Chinese detente
 -- even marginally facilitated by the Pakistanis -- must give New Delhi
 considerable pause.  In these circumstances the Indians are likely to
 seek further support and assurances from the USSR.

 IV.  EUROPE
 The Soviet Union
 22.  Though they may not feel free to say so publicly, the Soviet
 leaders can view the announcement of the President's forthcoming trip
 only as a piece of bad news which might get worse.  It is not merely
 that they regard the implications of the journey as distinctly unpleas-
 ant; or only that they fear that cooperation between the United States
 and China would impinge on many Soviet interests and concerns in many
 areas.  It is also that they are afraid that their opportunities to
 respond effectively are few.
 23.  First thoughts in Moscow will thus reflect apprehension and
 resentment; the suspicion will be strong that old fears of Sino-United
 States collusion have now been confirmed.  There will thus be a strong
 element of emotionally tinged distrust in the USSR's initial reactions.
 This may manifest itself in the general atmosphere of United States-
 Soviet relations -- in the manner of Soviet diplomats and negotiators,
 in the tenor (though perhaps not the specifics) of Soviet propaganda,
 and in the content of private Soviet remarks.

 24.  Moscow is not likely, however, to proceed in anger to revise
 drastically the main lines of its current foreign policies.  These
 latter have been conceived in full awareness of the possibility of shifts
 in Chinese attitudes and positions.  And the national interests and
 objectives that Soviet foreign policies are intended to serve -- as in
 the Middle East, in Europe, and toward the United States -- are not
 likely in the Soviet view to be greatly altered (though they certainly
 will be complicated) by improvements in relations between the United
 States and China.  In Western Europe, for example, the Soviets seek
 through essentially moderate policies to gain acceptance of their
 position in Eastern Europe, to reduce United States influence and expand
 their own, and to avoid risks and problems which would complicate their
 posture toward China.  None of these goals is likely to change solely
 as a consequence of Sino-United States cooperation.  Similarly, the
 USSR's motives in SALT will probably remain basically unaffected.
 25.  For tactical purposes, and in the short term, however, the
 Russians might indicate less urgent interest in negotiating with the
 United States.  They might, for example, conspicuously drag their feet
 in the Berlin talks (where they do not seem to be in a great hurry in
 any event); they might hope that this, in addition to distressing the
 United States, might stimulate apprehensions about Washington's policies

 Approved Forllease 2006/~DP79R0096?AQ00400010013-3
 among its West European allies.  But Moscow is not likely on this
 account to completely disrupt the Berlin talks; to do so would
 jeopardize its policies in Western Europe as a whole.
 26.      There are, however, two major questions about possible
 Soviet responses which must be left partly open.  One concerns the
 shape of domestic Soviet politics, the other bears on the USSR's
 relations with China itself.
 -- There may be arguments within the Soviet establishment
 concerning the wisdom of the USSR's present foreign policies.
 The Brezhnev regime's vaguely conciliatory line toward Western
 Europe; its public defense of the need to negotiate agreements
 with the United States; and its clearly implied hope to restrain
 defense spending and concentrate on the problems of the civilian
 economy, all these positions are presumably controversial.
 (Indeed, there have been hints of controversy in the press and
 in the defensive tone of some of the leader's remarks.)  Setbacks
 to Soviet policies abroad -- and the President's journey will
 be interpreted as a setback of sorts -- have an inevitable impact
 on politics at home.  Some of the leadership will argue that an
 excessively harsh response to the United States move might only

 drive the Americans farther into the arms of the Chinese.  But,
 on the whole, concern about the meaning of the United States
 turn toward Peking will tend to strengthen the arguments of
 those who distrust the United States the most or who are the
 most skeptical about a broad policy of moderation toward the
 West.  There is very little prospect, however, that the
 Brezhnev regime will be forced by such arguments to change
 its policies in major ways.
 -- Inevitably, if the President's visit to China creates
 concern among the Soviet leaders about Washington's motives,
 it also produces anxiety about Peking's.  Moscow's dislike
 and distrust of China are perhaps more intensely felt than
 even its dislike and distrust of the United States.  It is of
 course the spectre of the two countries' acting together,
 against the USSR, which forms the most chilling image in
 Soviet minds, and it is the actuality of such concert which
 the Russians are most anxious to forestall.  The notion
 might occur that one way to accomplish this would be to con-
 vince Peking that its interests would be better served by
 an improvement in Sino-Soviet relations than by a move

 toward the United States.  But it would be grossly out of
 character for the Soviets to adopt a truly conciliatory
 stance vis-a-vis China -- they have so far preferred in-
 stead to emphasize their military strength in dealings
 with the Chinese.  Moscow could not in any event be sure
 that Peking would not interpret Soviet concessions as
 signs of weakness -- indeed, as the fruit of Peking's
 dalliance with Washington and thus as an incentive for
 even greater Sino-United States cooperation.

 Eastern Europe
 27.  The East European countries no doubt regard the prospect of
 improved relations between the United States and China with some hope
 and some anxiety and considerable uncertainty.  Hope will rest on the
 broad position that all moves toward peace in the world are good for them
 because they may ultimately persuade the USSR to relax its policies in
 general and relax its hold on Eastern Europe in particular.  But anxiety
 will arise from the possibility that the Sino-Soviet conflict will inten-
 sify and that -- as has happened in the past -- this will lead to greater
 Soviet pressures for conformity within the empire. Finally, there will
 be uncertainty because a variety of questions of major interest to the
 East Europeans cannot now be answered:  what, if anything, do the new
 developments portend for United States policy in Europe and toward the
 USSR; how does Peking's new posture affect its attitudes toward the USSR
 and the Soviet position in Eastern Europe?  And what does it all mean
 for Romania, the special object of both Chinese and United States interest
 and of Soviet concern?
 28.  Most.official East European reactions to the President's journey
 and what it implies will of course reflect the Soviet view in greater or
 lesser degree.  Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany may only

 paraphrase Pravda; Poland and Hungary may provide hints of independent
 appraisals, but these are likely to be subtle.  On the other hand, Romania
 will probably cheer, though nervously.  Yugoslavia will be pleased but is
 likely to explore all the angles with some candor.
 Western Europe
 29.  As indicated by the initial response to the Presidential
 announcement, the West Europeans view the development favorably.  Most
 responsible newspapers regard the move as a spectacular and momentous
 action, possibly signifying an important turning point in world affairs
 -- even a redistribution of world power.  Britain and France see the
 United States move as confirming policies they have advocated for years,
 especially those associated with?efforts to bring Communist China out
 of isolation into the mainstream of world affairs.  The Italian Government
 sees _the announcement as confirming the wisdom of its own recent decision
 to recognize Peking.
 30.  Despite this generally positive view of the United States move,
 there are some uneasy stirrings about its implications.  Some West European
 officials, for example, are resentful that they were not consulted before-
 hand.  And, some West Europeans, particularly the West Germans -- anxious
 about the course of Ostpolitik -- will be apprehensive about the Soviet
 response and the effect the move may have on the process of East-West detente.
